All Hands on Deck - NOW!

Key takeaways from the IPCC report on Physical Science Basis (AR6 WG1)

9 August 2021

_____________________________________________________________________

Climate change is no longer a future threat. It is here and it’s rapidly getting worse.
The unprecedented heatwaves and wildﬁres, heavy rains and ﬂoods, dying sea-life, melting
polar ice and collapsing ecosystems provide painful reminders of just how far into the
danger zone we have already plunged. What matters now is where we go from here.

In the Paris Agreement, governments agreed to pursue a warming limit of 1.5°C, and to
act accordingly, with national targets and plans that are to be revised every ﬁve years. In
2018 world’s leading scientists provided governments with further clarity on the target, with
an IPCC Special Report, and established the global benchmarks for suﬃcient action: by
2030 global CO2 emissions would need to be halved and by mid-century, at the latest,
brought to net zero, with substantial reductions in other gases in all sectors.

Now scientists zoom back to the very big picture on climate change. The report on
Physical Science Basis, published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change
(IPCC) Working Group 1 on 9 Aug 2021, provides an update on what’s happening to our
warming planet and why. The report forms the ﬁrst part of the IPCC’s regular assessment
reports, now the 6th, the remaining parts of which (on human impacts and ways to limit
warming), will be published next year. It distils the advances in physical climate science
since the previous assessment report, AR5 WG1, published 8 years ago.

The report advances what we already knew, with further detail, depth and certainty.
Understanding of the climate system’s fundamental elements is already robust and well
established. The ﬁve IPCC assessment cycles since 1990 have comprehensively and
consistently laid out the rapidly accumulating evidence of a changing climate system.
Overall, observed warming is broadly consistent with projections in the past decades, since
systematic scientiﬁc assessments began1.

Below we summarise some of our key takeaways from the latest IPCC report,
drawing from its Summary For Policymakers and the underlining chapters. For the exact
IPCC wordings and context, see the references in brackets.2

Where we are today, and why

It is unequivocal that human inﬂuence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.
Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere (frozen parts of the
globe) and biosphere have occurred. (SPM A1)

Multiple lines of evidence indicate the unprecedented nature of recent large-scale
climatic changes in the context of all human history. In 2011-2020 global surface
temperature was about 1.09°C above pre-industrial levels, and temperatures are now
comparable to levels last experienced about 125,000 years ago during the Last Interglacial,
when the Greenland ice sheet was smaller and sea-level likely 5-10 meters higher than
today. The concentration of atmospheric CO2 (410 ppm) has not been this high in at least 2
million years. (Ch 1, page 5; SPM A.1.2; SPM A.2.2; TS, p. 43, 44; SPM A.2.1)

SPM = Summary for Policymakers; TS = Technical Summary; Ch = Chapter

Since the previous Assessment Report (WG1/AR5) global surface temperature has
warmed strongly, with the past ﬁve years (2016-2020) being the hottest in the record since
at least 1850. (TS,Cross-Section Box TS.1. Previous WG1/AR5 was released in 2013)

The rates of sea-level rise and ice loss have accelerated. The rate of sea-level rise has
nearly tripled compared to that in 1901-1971, while the average mass-loss rate for the
Greenland ice-sheet was about six times faster over the period 2010–2019 compared to the
period 1992-1999. The Antarctic Ice Sheet was losing mass on average three times faster in
2010-2019 compared to 1992-1999. (SPM A.1.7; Ch 9, page 7)

We’re witnessing more and worse weather extremes, and we have stronger evidence
of their attribution to human inﬂuence. Evidence of observed changes and their
attribution to human-induced emissions has strengthened for several types of extremes
since the previous Assessment Report (AR5), in particular for extreme precipitation,
droughts, tropical cyclones and compound extremes (including dry/hot events and ﬁre
weather). (SPM, section A.3; Ch11, page 6)

Where we are heading from here

The more greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, the worse it will get, with
every additional increment of warming, as many changes in the climate system become
larger in direct relation to increasing warming. More warming brings more frequent and more
intense hot extremes, marine heatwaves, droughts in some regions, heavy rains, ﬂooding
events, intense tropical cyclones and worsening climate impact-drivers such as melting ice
and snow, rising sea-levels, changing ocean circulation as well as acidifying, warming and
deoxygenation of oceans. (Figure SPM.10; SPM B2 Figure SPM.5; Figure SPM.6; Figure SPM.8; B.5.1; SPM C2)

There will be an increasing occurrence of some extreme events unprecedented in the
observational record, even at 1.5°C of global warming, but more so with higher levels.
For example, hot extremes will increase in frequency and intensity even if warming is
stabilized at 1.5°C. But with 2°C warming the changes in the intensity would be at least
double, and with 3°C quadruple, compared to changes at 1.5°C. [Nearly 3°C is where we
are heading with current policies, according to CAT.] (SPM, B.2.2; Ch 11, p 7)

The Arctic is likely to be practically sea ice free in September at least once before
2050 in all assessed scenarios. While in high CO2 emission scenarios ice-free gradually
becomes the norm, in a 1.5°C compatible scenario about half of the current summer sea-ice
extent would remain and even a slow recovery could start. ( SPM B.2.5; Figure SPM.8)

Low-likelihood outcomes, such as ice sheet collapse, abrupt ocean circulation
changes, compound extreme events and substantially larger warming cannot be ruled
out and are part of risk assessment. The probability of low-likelihood, high impact
outcomes increases with higher global warming levels. Abrupt responses and tipping
points, such as strongly increased Antarctic ice melt and forest dieback, cannot be
excluded. If warming increases, some compound events with low likelihood in past and
current climate will become more frequent, and there is a higher chance of historically
unprecedented events and surprises. (SPM, section C.3; Ch 11, Box 11.2)

There’s now only a “medium conﬁdence” that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation will not abruptly collapse before 2100. The AMOC is very likely to weaken
over the 21st century for all emission scenarios. But while IPCC AR5 assessed it to be “very
unlikely that AMOC will undergo an abrupt transition or collapse in the 21st century for the
scenarios considered”, AR6 now sees only a “medium conﬁdence that there will not be an
abrupt collapse before 2100”. (SPM C.3.4; AR5 WG1 SPM p. 24)

Diﬀerent regions are facing diﬀerent combinations of climatic impact drivers, which
are also modulated by natural drivers and internal variability. Understanding regional

climatic drivers is important for risk assessment and preparedness. The scientiﬁc
community is now enabling governments to explore this information, with an interactive
online regional atlas. (SPM Section C.2, and The Interactive Atlas at https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch)

Some very long-term changes are already locked in, regardless of what we do, resulting
in continued worldwide loss of ice, sea level rise and changes in the ocean (ocean warming,
deep ocean acidiﬁcation and deoxygenation). But the scale and speed of these changes
varies substantially depending on emissions we release from here on. (SPM section B5; SPM
Figure SPM.8)

Melting ice-sheets could leave a legacy of very high sea-level increases. Deep
uncertainty remains regarding ice-sheet-related processes and resulting sea-level rise. As a
new feature since AR5, the IPCC now extends sea-level rise estimations to 2300, assuming
diﬀerent emission pathways. The likely ranges in 2300 span from less than 0.5 meters to
about 7 meters, acknowledging that, assuming a very high emission future, even sea level
rise greater than 15m cannot be ruled out, due to ice sheet processes. (Figure SPM.8)

What it takes to limit further impacts and extremes

Warming will continue until carbon emissions reach net zero. Limiting human-induced
warming to any speciﬁc level requires reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions and strong
reductions in other warming gases. The eﬀects of emission cuts would emerge earlier as
slower growth of greenhouse gas concentrations, slower warming rates and improved air
quality. (Figure SPM.10, SPM sections D1 and D2; TS, page 28)

Meeting the Paris Agreement long-term goal of 1.5°C would mean less of everything –
sea-level rise, worsening weather extremes and harshening living conditions in both land
and ocean -– compared to higher warming levels. It would reduce the risks of crossing key
tipping points, facing abrupt changes and crippling with compound events. The diﬀerences
between current warming, 1.5°C and 2°C are signiﬁcant, and speciﬁed already in more
detail by the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C in 2018. (SPM Section C.2 Figure SPM.5; Figure SPM.6;
Figure SPM.8; B.5.1; SPM C.3.2 and C.3.3)

1.5°C warming limit is still within reach, from a physical perspective, but only with rapid
emission cuts that bring carbon emissions to net zero and beyond. The report reaﬃrms the
ﬁndings of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C on 1.5°C scenarios, anticipated time of
reaching 1.5°C (when apples are compared to apples), and the remaining carbon budget
which, after methodological improvements, is of the same magnitude. (Hence the emission
reduction benchmarks established by that report, of halving global carbon emissions by
2030 and bringing them to zero by 2050 are still valid). (SPM B.1.3; SPM D.1.3; footnote 27)

Failing to cut global emissions from current levels could eat up the remaining carbon
budget for 1.5 °C by 2030. To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels with
either a one-in-two (50%) or two-in-three (67%) chance, the remaining carbon budgets
amount to 500 and 400 billion tonnes of CO2 respectively, from the beginning of 2020.
Currently human activities are emitting over 40 Gt CO2 in a year (about 39 Gt in 2020 but
the IEA projects a rebound to near pre-covid levels, so near to 42 Gt). (SPM Table SPM.2)

Strong, rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are also needed, and
would come with the co-beneﬁt of improved air quality, by reducing global surface ozone.
However, CH4 emissions have grown faster since the AR5. (SPM D1; Ch 6, p 7)

Carbon removal methods have potential to remove residual CO2 from the atmosphere,
but can have potentially wide-ranging eﬀects on biogeochemical cycles and climate, and
inﬂuence water availability and quality, food production and biodiversity. If net negative
emissions were reached and sustained, it would gradually reverse surface temperature
increase, but it wouldn’t reverse other climate changes, such as sea-level rise, triggered by

then. (SPM, D.1.4-D.1.6. A comprehensive assessment of the ecological and socio-economic dimensions of CDR
options is left to the WGII and WGIII reports that will be published next year.)

Greenpeace conclusions for action

The IPCC does not have the mandate to make policy recommendations. Nor does the report
discuss ways to mitigate climate risks, as that will be covered in their reports next year. Below
we present Greenpeace conclusions for action.

The science is clear, the situation is serious, and now it’s all hands on deck. We must
do everything faster and bolder, at all levels, leaving no sector behind.

Heading for zero global emissions, through halving them by 2030, as established by the
IPCC in its 1.5°C report, provide clear benchmarks for action. Those with more capacity and
responsibility must lead the way and support others in their journey.

Governments must align their targets and plans with 1.5°C by the COP26 climate
conference in Glasgow this year. With current policies we are still on track to an apocalyptic
2.9°C future. Even if all pledges were backed with suﬃcient policies, we’d be heading
towards roughly 2.4°C warming, with nearly 80% chance of exceeding 2°C.

Strong green recovery measures from COVID-19 oﬀer a make or break opportunity, so
let’s grasp it! Strong recovery measures could slow-down warming rates, avoiding 0.3°C
warming by 2050 and give a good chance of keeping the 1.5°C target within reach.

There can’t be any new fossil fuel investments anywhere, and the phase out of existing
fossil fuel infrastructure must align with the 1.5°C budget. Smart, eﬃcient and sustainable
solutions are ready to deliver and meet all our energy needs, if allowed to.

We must protect and restore ecosystems to build resilience. Healthy ecosystems are
more resilient in the face of inevitable climatic changes. We must protect 30% of our land
and oceans and reduce all pressures to our ocean ecosystems. We must end deforestation,
restore forests and other terrestrial ecosystems, and adopt agroecology along with a
reduced production and consumption of animal products and more plant-based diets.

Carbon dioxide removal oﬀers no silver bullet. It is fundamental that we protect and
improve the ability of our forests and soils to sequester more carbon. But additional carbon
removal on a large scale comes with many challenges and risks. Our utmost priority must
be in stopping further emissions from entering the atmosphere right now, rather than relying
on theoretical large-scale removals far in the future.

Financial institutions - banks, asset managers and insurers, as well as the companies
to whom they lend and whose shares they own, must align their business with the
objectives of the Paris Agreement, to pursue limiting global average temperature increase
to 1.5°C as shifting investment will be key to avoiding high-carbon lock-in. Greenwash with
empty net-zero pledges relying on imaginary oﬀsets only add fuel to the problem.

We must prepare for the unavoidable - with justice. All future development and water
management plans, infrastructure projects and food security programmes must factor in
climate reality. The ‘polluter pays’ principle must be at the heart of adaptation and
compensation eﬀorts between and within countries.

We must deliver in solidarity. Today the true costs of climate change are paid
predominantly by those who have caused it the least. Rich governments must deliver on
their Paris climate ﬁnance commitments and get serious with addressing loss and damage.

And we can!

The challenges are huge, but so are opportunities. Since the IPCC AR5 (published in
2013-2014), the world has already changed a lot, and not only for the bad. We now have a
truly global climate agreement with a 1.5°C goal, and a lot more.

• Solar and wind have become the cheapest forms of new electricity in most of the

world, and costs continue to decline. This has the potential to change everything, if only we
allow it to, by making sure that oil, coal and gas are phased out at the speed required.

• Even the International Energy Agency now sees a pathway to 1.5°C, into an energy
system dominated by solar and wind, coming with “huge beneﬁts”. There should be no
investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further ﬁnal investment decisions for
new unabated coal plants, and by 2035 no sales of new cars running on oil, says the IEA -
a body created to ensure the security of oil supplies, and one with big inﬂuence on
investment and business strategies.

• The ﬁnancial sector has ﬁnally started to wake up, with some of the world’s largest
bond purchasers and asset owners now pursuing to align their strategies with the Paris
Agreement and 1.5°C limit, and some top global investors moving away from the massive
climate-related risks associated with fossil fuels, into building renewable energy.

• Some of the business strategies are starting to sound diﬀerent, with car companies
announcing combustion engine phase outs, energy utilities early coal phase outs and an
oil giant cuts in their oil and gas production.

• People are winning in courts: Movement-led climate court cases are bringing justice to

those most impacted, and an increasing number of judges and courts are applying the law
to hold polluters accountable. In just three years climate litigation cases have nearly
doubled, and only last year, an unprecedented number of key judgments with potentially
far-reaching impacts were issued, including on the cases against Shell and against
Germany. Now, more than ever, climate litigation has become a real threat for laggard
governments and big polluters.

• Most importantly: People power is forcing justice and action. In recent years we’ve

witnessed a growing wave of citizen action, from mass demonstrations to climate
elections and blooming court cases for justice. And it is forcing change! New climate
targets have been adopted, and a wave of victories in courts is changing the game. (For
Greenpeace supported court cases, please see here.)

None of this is enough. Not even close. But all of it points to new potential for change.
Most of these developments would have been deemed impossible just a few years ago.
Now we must speed up and scale up for good, with massive public pressure.

This is our moment of truth, a time for radical honesty. With incremental action we are only
fooling ourselves. Big polluters must stop doing better and start doing enough. This is the
moment to rise up, be bold and think big. And there’s a role to play for everyone.
