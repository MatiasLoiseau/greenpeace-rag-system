The Lewis Powell Memo: Corporate Blueprint to Dominate Democracy
Greenpeace has the full text of theLewis Powell
Memo available for review, as well as
analyses of how Lewis Powell’s suggestions have impacted the realms of
politics, the
judiciary,
communications and
education.
Forty years ago today, on August 23, 1971, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., an
attorney from Richmond, Virginia, drafted a confidential
memorandum for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce that describes a strategy
for the corporate takeover of the dominant public institutions of American
society.
Powell and his friend Eugene Sydnor, then-chairman of the Chamber’s education
committee, believed the Chamber had to transform itself from a passive
business group into a powerful political force capable of taking on what
Powell described as a major ongoing “attack on the American free enterprise
system.”
An astute observer of the business community and broader social trends, Powell
was a former president of the American Bar Association and a board member of
tobacco giant Philip Morris and other companies. In his memo, he detailed a
series of possible “avenues of action” that the Chamber and the broader
business community should take in response to fierce criticism in the media,
campus-based protests, and new consumer and environmental laws.
Environmental awareness and pressure on corporate polluters had reached a new
peak in the months before the Powell memo was written. In January 1970,
President Nixon signed the National Environmental Policy Act, which formally
recognized the environment’s importance by establishing the White House
Council on Environmental Quality. Massive Earth Day events took place all over
the country just a few months later and by early July, Nixon signed an
executive order that created the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA). Tough new amendments to the Clean
Air Act followed in December 1970 and by April 1971, EPA announced the first
air pollution standards. Lead paint was soon regulated for the first time, and
the awareness of the impacts of pesticides and other pollutants– made famous
by Rachel Carson in her 1962 book, Silent Spring was recognized when DDT was
finally banned for agricultural use in 1972.
The overall tone of Powell’s memo reflected a widespread sense of crisis among
elites in the business and political communities. “No thoughtful person can
question that the American economic system is under broad attack,” he
suggested, adding that the attacks were not coming just from a few “extremists
of the left,” but also and most alarmingly — from “perfectly respectable
elements of society,” including leading intellectuals, the media, and
politicians.
To meet the challenge, business leaders would have to first recognize the
severity of the crisis, and begin marshalling their resources to influence
prominent institutions of public opinion and political power — especially the
universities, the media and the courts. The memo emphasized the importance of
education, values, and movement-building. Corporations had to reshape the
political debate, organize speakers’ bureaus and keep television programs
under “constant surveillance.” Most importantly, business needed to recognize
that political power must be “assiduously cultivated; and that when necessary,
it must be used aggressively and with determination without embarrassment and
without the reluctance which has been so characteristic of American business.”
Powell emphasized the importance of strengthening institutions like the U.S.
Chamber — which represented the interests of the broader business community,
and therefore key to creating a united front. While individual corporations
could represent their interests more aggressively, the responsibility of
conducting an enduring campaign would necessarily fall upon the Chamber and
allied foundations. Since business executives had “little stomach for hard-
nosed contest with their critics” and “little skill in effective intellectual
and philosophical debate,” it was important to create new think tanks, legal
foundations, front groups and other organizations. The ability to align such
groups into a united front would only come about through “careful long-range
planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite
period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint
effort, and in the political power available only through united action and
united organizations.”
Before he was appointed by Richard Nixon to the U.S. Supreme Court Powell
circulated his call for a business crusade not only to the Chamber, but also
to executives at corporations including General Motors. The memo did not
become available to the public until after Powell’s confirmation to the Court,
when it was leaked to Jack Anderson, a syndicated columnist and investigative
reporter, who cited it as reason to doubt Powell’s legal objectivity.
Anderson’s report spread
business leaders’ interest in the memo even further. Soon thereafter, the
Chamber’s board of directors formed a task force of 40 business executives
(from U.S. Steel, GE, ABC, GM, CBS, 3M, Phillips Petroleum, Amway and numerous
other companies) to review Powell’s memo and draft a list of specific
proposals to “improve understanding of business and the private enterprise
system,” which the board adopted on November 8, 1973.
Historian Kim Phillips-Fein describes how “many who read the memo cited it
afterward as inspiration for their political choices.” In fact, Powell’s Memo
is widely credited for having helped catalyze a new business activist
movement, with numerous conservative family and corporate
foundations (e.g. Coors, Olin,
Bradley, Scaife, Koch and others) thereafter creating and sustaining powerful
new voices to help push the corporate agenda, including the Business
Roundtable (1972), the American Legislative Exchange
Council (ALEC – 1973), Heritage Foundation
(1973), the Cato Institute (1977), the Manhattan Institute (1978), Citizens
for a Sound Economy (1984 – now Americans for Prosperity), Accuracy in Academe
(1985), and others.
Because it signaled the beginning of a major shift in American business
culture, political power and law, the Powell memo essentially marks the
beginning of the business community’s multi-decade collective takeover of the
most important institutions of public opinion and democratic decision-making.
At the very least, it is the first place where this broad agenda was compiled
in one document.
That shift continues today, with corporate influence over policy and politics
reaching unprecedented new dimensions. The decades-long drive to rethink legal
doctrines and ultimately strike down the edifice of campaign finance laws
breaking radical new ground with the Roberts Court’s decision in Citizens
United v. the Federal Election
Commission continues apace.
Although many new voices have emerged in the 40 years since it circulated
Powell’s memo, the U.S. Chamber has expanded its leadership position within
the corporate power movement, leading dozens of judicial, legislative and
regulatory fights each year. Measured in terms of money spent, the Chamber is
by far the most powerful lobby in Washington, DC, spending $770.6
million
since 1998, over three times the amount spent by General Electric, the second-
largest spender. At the same time, the Chamber has reinforced its lobbying
power by becoming one of the largest conduits of election-related
“independent
expenditures,”
spending over $32.8 million on Federal elections in 2010. The Chamber sponsors
the Institute for Legal Reform, which has spearheaded the campaign for tort
“reform,” making it more difficult for average people who have been injured,
assaulted, or harmed to sue the responsible corporations. Along with well over
a dozen legal foundations, the Chamber has also helped shape the powerful
“business civil liberties” movement that has been a driving force behind the
Citizens United decision and other judicial actions that have handcuffed
regulators and prevented Congress from putting common-sense checks on
corporate power.

In December, 2009 Greenpeace established aclimate crime
scene in front of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for
their ongoing obstruction to global warming solutions.
