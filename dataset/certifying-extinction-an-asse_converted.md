This used to be an important reindeer
grazing forest. Areas of old-growth forest,
like this one in Inari (Sámi region), have been
logged by the Finnish Government’s logging
arm, Metsähallitus, under the Finnish Forest
Certification System.

FOREWORD

Finland’s forests are among the most intensively managed
in the world. Over 50 million cubic metres of wood are
harvested every year from the country’s 20 million hectares
of commercial forests. The Finnish forest management model
has resulted in the rapid conversion of natural forests into
monotonous industrial forests that lack many key features
of boreal forest ecosystems. Forestry is the most serious
threat to species survival in Finland. Unless there is a
significant increase in the amount of protected forest
area and a parallel improvement in the standards of forest
management, hundreds of species face extinction within
the next 50 years.

Sustainable development and protection of biodiversity
are now popular phrases in the public communications of
the Finnish forestry sector. But there remains a huge gap
between rhetoric and reality.

Forest certification could be an effective way to improve
the ecological and social sustainability of forest use. However,
95% of Finland’s forests have been certified according to the
inadequate Finnish Forest Certification System standard,
with the result that there has been little change to the
destructive practices that have caused the current
degradation of forest biodiversity.

With this report, the undersigned Finnish environmental
organisations want to emphasise the urgent need for
better forest management and better protection for
the remaining old-growth and high-conservation-value
forests in Finland.

AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REVISED STANDARDS OF THE FINNISH FOREST CERTIFICATION SYSTEM

1. INTRODUCTION

The Finnish forest sector prides itself on its
reputation for sustainable forestry, trading
on the national certification standard, the
Finnish Forest Certification System (FFCS),
under which 95% of Finland’s forests are
managed. The FFCS standard is endorsed
by the Programme for the Endorsement
of Forest Certification schemes (PEFC).
However, as this report confirms, there
are serious problems with the FFCS and
the standard cannot guarantee that timber
comes from environmentally and socially
responsible sources. Logging under the
FFCS threatens Finland’s biodiversity and
the traditional rights of the indigenous

Sámi people. The FFCS continues to
allow logging in unprotected old-growth
forests and other high-conservation-
value forests.

This report compares key environmental
criteria of the FFCS to those of the
internationally recognised Forest
Stewardship Council (FSC) certification
scheme. The FSC is the only certification
system that is supported by environmental
organisations such as Greenpeace, Friends
of the Earth, WWF, the Finnish Association
for Nature Conservation (FANC) and the
Finnish Nature League. Indigenous peoples’

groups and progressive companies
within the timber industry also support
the FSC system.

The report makes clear that
companies sourcing from Finland need
to exert pressure for positive change
in forest management practices,
through the implementation of
environmentally and socially responsible
timber procurement policies. It concludes
that in the absence of such change
progressive companies will increasingly
turn their backs on the FFCS and
Finland’s forest products.

More logging is currently planned by Metsähallitus in this area, upon which many
red-listed species such as the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) depend.

2. FINLAND’S FORESTS

2.1.  From natural forests to an

2.2.  Forest legislation

industrial landscape

Forests (including scrub land) cover 23 million hectares (76%)
of the land area of Finland.1 Forests are the primary habitat
of almost half of the country’s species diversity.2 The most
common tree species of these boreal forests are pine (Pinus
sylvestris), spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula spp.).

Over half of Finland’s forests are in small private holdings
(54%), while a significant proportion is owned by the state
(33%). Only a small amount is owned by companies (8%) and
by other owners such as municipalities and the church (5%).3

Since early in the 20th century the state has strongly promoted
intensive forestry in Finland with the aim of maximising the
flow of timber to Finnish mills. Forest policies have resulted in
the conversion of old-growth forests to industrial forests that
lack key features of natural boreal forest.4

Industrial forestry and in particular the creation of monoculture
forests have significantly changed the structure, dynamics and
species composition of the forest ecosystem.5 Species such as
the flying squirrel (Pteromys volans), three-toed woodpecker
(Picoides tridactylus), Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) and
hundreds of plants and invertebrates have been unable to
sustain their populations in commercial forests. Altogether
564 forest species are classified as threatened in the Finnish
assessment of threatened species (the Red List), a majority of
them as a result of modern forest management.6 A further 416
forest species are classified as near-threatened. In reality, the
number of threatened species is probably much greater, since
the status of 65% of all forest species could not be assessed at
all because of insufficient information on their populations.

Around a quarter of the threatened forest species are entirely
dependent on old-growth forest, and many others depend on
particular features of boreal forest that are now only to be
found in old-growth forests.7 The number of species entirely
dependent on old-growth forest that have become extinct or
are threatened or near-threatened has reached 260, according
to the latest assessment of threatened species (2001)8 – an
increase of over 40A from the previous assessment (1991).9

Finland’s forest policies are formulated by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry, which spends over ¤100 million annually
on subsidising private forestry.12 Regional Forestry Centres
(government bodies under the administration of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry) have a central role in the implementation
of forest policies – they promote forestry, create Regional
Forest Programmes and supervise the implementation of forest
legislation (see Section 2.3).

Several pieces of legislation regulate Finnish forestry, the most
important being the Forest Act,13 which focuses on the harvesting,
management, economic sustainability and regeneration of
commercial forests. Under the Forest Act biodiversity protection
in commercial forests is regulated in only seven specifically defined
rare habitats, the Habitats of Special Importance.B These habitats
are mapped by the Regional Forestry Centres and delineated so
strictly that they cover only about 0.36% of private commercial
forestry land in southern Finland.14 Many of the most important
habitats of threatened species, such as old-growth forests, are
not even mentioned in this legislation and can be legally harvested
without restrictions.

Due to strict definitions, the Habitats of Special Importance omit
the largest occurrences of the defined habitat types and only
protect small areas.15 In fact, the average size of areas of habitats
preserved by the Forest Act is approximately 0.5ha.16 Larger areas
continue to be fragmented and destroyed by logging operations.
Those habitats that are demarcated by the Forestry Centres are
usually too small-scale to remain viable and consequently, often
lose the species that depend on them within a few years of
surrounding areas being logged.17

Whilst most operations in commercial forests are regulated
by the Forest Act, the protection of threatened species is the
preserve of the Nature Conservation Act,18 which also allows for
the establishment of protected areas. The Nature Conservation
Decree (an annex to the Nature Conservation Act) lists specially
protected and threatened species, along with species prioritised in
the EU Habitats19 and Birds20 Directives. Of all threatened species
in Finland, 32% are listed as specially protected in the Nature
Conservation Decree.

Currently only about 4% of the country’s forest area (7%
including scrub land) is strictly protected.10 The vast
majority of this is situated in areas where many of the
threatened species are unable to survive. Unless the area of
forest and of rare habitats under protection is significantly
increased, hundreds of species are expected to face
extinction within the next 50 years.11

Under section 47 of the Nature Conservation Act, it is illegal to
exploit habitats of specially protected species once they have
been demarcated by Regional Environment Centres (Government
bodies under the administration of the Ministry of Environment).
However, due to the fact that few resources have been allocated
to this process, only 15 individual habitats of specially protected
species have been demarcated in the past seven years.21

A  Some of the changes in categorisation, from one level of threat to another, are based on new IUCN criteria used for the 2001 assessment, which

may affect this estimate.

B  Habitats of Special Importance as defined in the Forest Act are: 1) immediate surroundings of springs, streams, wet hollows and small pools; 2)
  herb-rich and grassy spruce swamps/mires and eutrophic fens south of Lapland province; 3) fertile patches of herb-rich forest; 4) heathland
  forest islets in undrained wetlands; 5) gorges and ravines; 6) steep bluffs and underlying forests; and 7) a group of habitats of low productivity
  – sandy soils, exposed bedrock, boulder fields, wetlands with sparse tree cover and those flood meadows that are less productive than nutrient-
  poor heathland forests (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 1997).

This tree, which died in 1692, had been standing
for nearly 700 years in the Sámi region, before
Metsähallitus recently logged it. The Sámi
region contains some of the largest ancient
forest areas in Western Europe. Standing dead
trees are important habitat for several red-
listed species. They are increasingly rare due to
modern forest management methods.

6

According to section 49 of the Act, the destruction or degradation
of breeding sites or resting places of the species referred to in
Annex IV of the EU Habitats Directive is also prohibited. Annex IV
lists 42 species, of which about half are forest species.

Today, the most optimistic estimate concludes that only about
a million hectares of old-growth forest remain (less than 5%
of Finland’s total forest cover), with approximately half outside
existing protected areas.26 The vast majority of these forests are
situated on state lands in the north and east of the country.

The habitats of the threatened species not listed as specially
protected under the Nature Conservation Decree or included
in Annex IV of the Habitats Directive have no legal protection,
although individual specimens of some animals and plants are
protected from killing, capturing or picking. The habitats of the
majority of threatened forest species whose habitats continue to
be destroyed legally.

In the south, old-growth forests exist only in extremely small
fragments. However, high-conservation-value forests that have
retained some of the features of old-growth forests and thus
support populations of threatened species do still exist, mostly
outside protected areas. These fragments are usually too small
to remain viable and need to be enlarged and restored.

2.3.    The supervisory role of the

Regional Forestry Centres

2.5.   Old-growth forest

protection programmes

Regional Forestry Centres have a problematic double role,
being both supervisors of forest legislation and FFCS certificate
holders. As supervisors of forest legislation, the role of the
Forestry Centres is supposed to be impartial. However, the
centres receive subsidies from the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry obliging them to take part in FFCS certification,
meaning that this impartiality could be undermined.22

Section 22 of the Forest Act requires Forestry Centres to
report suspected violations of the Act to the police. However,
according to recent research from the University of Joensuu,
they only report a third of the violations they investigate.23
The research concludes that some Forestry Centres seem to
have a unwritten policy not to report certain forest crimes at
all. Although Forestry Centres are expected to specify a reason
for not reporting a violation, in several cases studied they
failed to do so.

2.4.  Old-growth forests and high-
conservation-value forests

One of the major impacts of the Government’s policy of
promoting intensive forest management has been the rapid
reduction in the size of Finland’s ancient or old-growth forest
areas, some of the last fragments left in Europe.

Four protection programmes for old-growth forests were carried
out in Finland during the 1990s, two in the south and two in
the north. Whilst the programmes attempted to preserve some
valuable examples of natural forests, their impacts were limited,
not least due to the lobbying efforts of the forestry sector and
the perceived economic value of allowing logging to continue.
Decisions about protection were primarily based around political
considerations rather than on scientific analysis.

In total the programmes set aside 343,000ha, although much of
this land was already protected, had logging restrictions in place
or had been classified as unproductive land.27 Taking existing
decisions into account, an additional 80,000ha of old-growth
forest were protected in the north  and an additional  28,000ha
in the south. This represents less than 0.5% of Finland’s forest
land area. Since there are so few old-growth forest fragments
remaining, some of the land protected included clearcut or
secondary forest adjacent to old-growth areas.

The protection programmes left hundreds of thousands of
hectares of old-growth forest available for industrial use,
including some of the largest areas of old-growth
forest in the northernmost part of the country, the Sámi
homeland, which was arbitrarily excluded from the programmes.C
Moreover, many unprotected old-growth forest areas outside of
protection have since been shown to hold significant populations
of threatened species.28

Old-growth forests differ from industrial forests in terms of
their multi-layered canopy structure, the presence of dead trees
of various ages and the occurrence of species that are no longer
found in abundance in industrial forests.24 These forests are
therefore essential for maintaining forest biodiversity in Finland.25

Ecological research now indicates that the amount of
old-growth forest remaining in Finland may already be
too small to ensure the long-term survival of many old-
growth forest-dependent species.29

C  The old-growth forests of the Sámi area were not assessed in the course of the old-growth forest protection programmes. However, within the
  Sámi area there are a number of forest protection areas such as national parks and wilderness areas based on earlier political decisions.

2.6.    Forest protection

in south Finland

‘The amount of strictly protected forest in south
Finland and Ostrobothnia must be increased in
order to protect rare habitats and threatened
and specialised forest species.’
Ministry of Environment working group, 2000

Only 1% of the forests of south Finland have been
protected despite this region containing the largest
number of forest-based species in the country. Most of
the forests have now been converted to monotonous
industrial forestry. As a result, the number of species
threatened in the south has significantly increased.

Recognition of the urgent need for greater forest
protection led to the establishment in 2000 of a working
group including scientists and government representatives.
This group concluded that the state of forest biodiversity
in south Finland was inadequate and that timely and
adequate protection measures, including new protected
areas and restoration plans, were needed in all forest types
to stop biodiversity loss.30

In the same year a committee of interest groups,
with a majority of representatives from the state
forestry administration (including the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry and Metsähallitus), forest
industries and forest owners, was set up by the
Government and assigned to prepare a protection
programme for the area. In 2002 the committee published
its action plan, the so-called METSO programme (‘metso’
means ‘capercaillie’ in Finnish), which postponed the
decision on the need for a protection programme until
2007. It was also decided that the next assessment should
be carried out by relevant government ministries rather
than by scientists.

The METSO programme, which has since been
endorsed by the Government, includes a small
number of experimental, small-scale regional conservation
projects for the years 2003–15. In the best-case scenario,
these projects will result in the increased protection of
less than 5,000ha of forest with current funding. This may
have positive local impacts but will have no effect on the
general decline of forest biodiversity in south Finland.
The programme includes no actions to stop the destruction
of the majority of high-conservation-value forests.

There are still many old-growth forests left in
the north of Finland, but they are under threat
of logging by Metsähallitus. One of the biggest
unprotected, threatened old-growth forest areas
is Peurakaira in Sodankylä, in the Sámi area.

3.  DEVELOPMENT OF CERTIFICATION

SYSTEMS IN FINLAND: FFCS AND FSC

3.1.  History of the FFCS

In August 1996 representatives of 29 different stakeholder groups,
including some environmental NGOs, met to create a Finnish
standard for forest certification. It was intended that the scheme
would later be adopted by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).
However, when during 1997 most members of this group failed
to show significant commitment to ecologically sound forestry,
the environmental NGOs left the process. The forestry sector and
forest owners then went on to develop their own standard called
the Finnish Forest Certification System (FFCS).

There are no rules setting out requirements for the
representation of different interest groups under the FFCS or
the PEFC. NGOs, for example, can only participate in the PEFC
Council as associate members with no voting power.

A dispute settlement body exists to deal with any complaints
made under the FFCS, but there is no provision for complaints
to be filed by interested parties such as environmental
organisations or reindeer herders. It is therefore unsurprising
that no complaints have ever been filed.

The FFCS was endorsed by the Programme for the
Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) in May 2000.D
Since then, the PEFC logo has been used on FFCS-certified
products. The FFCS never gained NGO support because of its
weak environmental criteria and insufficient consideration for
social concerns. Both the FFCS and the PEFC have also been
criticised for their industry-dominated governance and non-
transparent processes.

3.2.  Certification process under the FFCS

Certification of Finnish forests by the FFCS began in 1999
and within a year 95% of all Finnish forests had been certified.
The certification was carried out at a regional level via
the 13 Regional Forestry Centres (see Section 2.2) who applied
for the certificate. All forests automatically became certified
via their owners’ membership of a Forest Management
Association (FMA), unless they specifically opted out by
sending a written notice to the FMA.E In practice this led
to some individual forest owners not even being aware
that their forests had been certified.

3.3.  Decision-making and complaints

procedure in the FFCS

The FFCS is governed by the Forest Certification Council,
the Working Group on Forest Certification Standards and the
Working Group on the Development of Forest Certification.
The majority of seats on all these bodies are reserved for forest
industry and forest owners’ representatives.31

3.4.  Development of the FSC

The Finnish FSC standard was drafted by the Finnish FSC
Working Group, including representatives from NGOs, social
interest groups, small forest owners and forest industries. It was
accepted by the Finnish FSC Standard Committee in 2002. The
standard has been sent to the FSC International Secretariat for
approval and is expected to be endorsed by the end of 2004.

However, with 95% of Finland’s forests already certified by the
FFCS, the forestry sector has shown limited interest in the FSC
and its progressive criteria. The development of the Finnish FSC
standard has therefore been slow. Furthermore, because of the
involvement of FMAs and the Regional Forestry Centres in the
FFCS, FFCS certification is free to forest owners. The state thus
provides a competitive advantage to the FFCS.

3.5.  Decision-making and complaints

under the FSC

As of 2004, only a few experimental sites in Finland are being
assessed to FSC standards. When the FSC system becomes
operational in Finland decision-making power will be divided
equally between three interest groups – economic, social and
environmental. Furthermore, all FSC-certified forest operations,
certification bodies and national FSC initiatives have a system
for managing and responding to complaints. If these mechanisms
prove insufficient to resolve a disputed issue, all interest groups
will be able to use their respective chambers (economic, social
or environmental) to submit complaints to the FSC International
Secretariat for dispute resolution.

D  At the time the PEFC was called the Pan-European Forest Certification Scheme.

E  Under the FFCS, local FMAs apply for certification on behalf of their members, allowing for the simultaneous certification of all forest holdings in a
  Forestry Centre. Most Finnish forest owners are obliged by law to belong to an FMA.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA

4.1.  Revision of the FFCS standard

The FFCS standard was revised during 2002–03 and was
accepted by the FFCS Working Group in September 2003. The
revised standard includes 28 criteria. Three new criteria have
been created, eight have been removed and some have now
been combined.32 No improvements have been made in the most
seriously flawed environmental criteria such as those concerning
old-growth forests and threatened species.

4.2.   Revised FFCS criteria compared

with those of the FSC

Fourteen criteria in the FFCS standard concern environmental
targets. The most important of them are analysed below with
emphasis on their actual environmental impacts. Each criterion
is compared with the corresponding criterion of the Finnish
FSC standard.33

The criteria with the most potential to influence forest
management are those based around performance standards in
the forests, as opposed to systems-based criteria. (Performance-
based criteria set specific targets to improve forest management
on the ground, whereas systems-based criteria set out processes
that certified companies must follow.) Consequently, this critique
focuses largely on performance- related criteria.

FFCS Criterion 1. Legislative
requirements are complied with

Under this criterion all certified forest operations must
demonstrate compliance with a number of Finland’s laws, but,
strangely, not with all of them. For example, whilst FFCS-
certified holdings are obliged to comply with the Forest Act,
they do not have to provide evidence of compliance with the
Act on Financing Sustainable Forestry.34

One of the important roles of the Act on Financing Sustainable
Forestry is its regulation of the ¤60 million worth of subsidies
given annually to forest management operations by the Ministry
of Agriculture and Forestry. Recent inspections of 5% of these
subsidised operations (in young forest stands), carried out
by the Regional Forestry Centres, revealed that 20% of the
operations studied were not legally entitled to subsidies they
had received.35 In some cases the forest management operations
had not spent the money as had been stipulated, and in others,
forestry operations were not entitled to the subsidies they had
received. Operations caught falsely claiming subsidies, or shown
to be misusing them, are expected to return the money, but
given that Forestry Centres are obliged to inspect only 5% of
the subsidised operations, it is likely that many of the illegally
subsidised operations are never revealed.

Moreover, in the FFCS standard there is no requirement for
certified forests to comply with the provisions of binding
international agreements signed by Finland, such as the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species,
International Labour Organisation conventions, and the
Convention on Biological Diversity.

The corresponding FSC criteria (Criteria 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5
on compliance with laws) require all FSC-certified operations
to comply with national and local laws and administrative
requirements. Each certification candidate is checked for
violations of all relevant laws. Unlike FFCS certifiers, FSC certifiers
check the bookkeeping of each certified holding to ensure that ‘all
applicable and legally prescribed fees, royalties, taxes and other
charges’ have been paid. The draft FSC standard also requires
certified forests to be managed in accordance with the provisions
of all binding international agreements signed by Finland.

FFCS Criterion 6. Forest management planning
promotes sustainable forest management

The FFCS standard only requires forest management plans for
50% of the forest holdings in a certified area. The plans are
required to include environmental targets related to national
legislation, which itself has serious environmental shortcomings
(see Section 2.2), and to Criterion 10, which is also largely based
on the same legislation (see below).

The system contrasts strongly with the FSC’s approach,
which requires management plans for all certified holdings.
According to the Finnish FSC standard, management plans will
have to include provisions for identification and protection of
endangered species, important reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)
pastures and religious sites of the Sámi; for demarcation of
forests to be restored and high-conservation-value forests;
and for harvesting restrictions during the bird nesting season.
None of these provisions is required by the FFCS, or under
Finnish legislation.

Management plans under the FSC standard will have to include
environmental impact assessments and monitoring and will be
periodically revised to adjust them to the results of monitoring
and relevant scientific information.

FFCS Criterion 9. Conservation value of
protected areas is not endangered

This criterion prohibits destructive activities inside the borders
of protected areas (which would be illegal in any case). However,
it does not go so far as to protect the buffer zones to these
areas, which are crucial to prevent loss of ecological value

12

within the areas themselves. Thus, the FFCS standard offers
no additional environmental protection beyond that demanded
by legislation. Ecological research has shown that forest
management activities (such as ditching) in the proximity of
protected areas have, in several cases, resulted in environmental
degradation within those areas.36

Under the Finnish FSC standard, operations that are harmful to
protected areas will be controlled, even when taking place outside
the protected areas: ‘Construction of forest roads, delineation of
logging sites or renewal of drainage systems shall not harm the
sites protected under this criterion [Criterion 6 on set-aside areas
and protected habitats] or other protected areas.’ Compliance
with the criterion will be checked by field inspections and these
aspects will also be monitored in the management plan.

FFCS Criterion 10. Typical features
of important habitats are preserved

Most of the habitats listed in this criterion are already protected
by legislation.

Important habitats to be protected are classified in three
different categories:

1)  habitats protected by the Nature Conservation Act

2)  habitats protected by the Forest Act (Habitats of

Special Importance)

3)  habitats whose preservation is recommended by

forestry guidelines and the FFCS standard.

Finnish law already protects habitats in categories one and
two. Regional Environment Centres carry out demarcation
and protection of the habitats protected by the Nature
Conservation Act. However, of the nine habitats protected by
the Act only three are forest habitats. These are: ‘wild woods
rich in broadleaved deciduous trees, hazel woods and
common alder woods’. All of these three habitat types are
extremely rare and occur mainly in southernmost Finland.

The Forest Act requires the preservation of seven Habitats
of Special Importance, which are mapped by the Regional
Forestry Centres (see Section 2.2).

The habitats listed in category threeF – including old-growth
forest – are not protected by legislation in commercial forests.
The habitats listed in this category should therefore be subject
to protection under the FFCS, and according to the standard
‘the characteristic features of the majority of these habitats
should be preserved.’ However, logging is allowed in most of
the habitats, with the exception, theoretically, of kettle holes
and old-growth forests. Unfortunately, at least for old-growth
forests, the habitats are then defined in such a way that means
that logging can still take place.

The problem of definition is common to all three categories of
important habitat. The ‘typical features’ of the habitats have
been defined very strictly in legislation (for categories 1 and 2)
and under the FFCS (for category 3). As a consequence, in most
cases only the most representative areas qualify for protection.
Moreover, if a habitat exceeds 1ha it nearly always falls outside
the stipulations for protection.

The FFCS standard goes further, stipulating that the
important habitats of category 3 ‘do not exceed [a size of]
one hectare’. There is no logical explanation as to why the
size is limited in this way.

OLD-GROWTH FORESTS
IN THE FFCS STANDARD

'With the pace of old-growth logging in Finland today
it seems clear that many endangered species as well as
species typical of old-growth forests will continue to
decline.’ Mariko Lindgren, Finnish Biodiversity Research
Programme (FIBRE), University of Helsinki, 2002.

Old-growth forest is one of the habitats ‘protected’ by
Criterion 10 of the FFCS standard. However, the reality
is that the FFCS has set thresholds in such a way as
to make protection of any more old-growth forests
extremely difficult. Most remaining old-growth forests
are found on state land, where more than 5% of all forests
are already protected in some form. Conveniently, the
FFCS standard states that if more than 5% of a forest
owner’s land is already protected, no further additional
protection is required. By defining the standard in this way,
the FFCS manages to evade one of the most significant
ecological problems in Finland – old-growth forest
logging on state lands.

Even in forests owned by private landowners, protection
can only be granted to areas 1ha in size or less, drastically
limiting any potential for greater protection for old-
growth forests. The situation is further exacerbated by
the strict qualitative criteria that have to be met for an
area to be classified as old-growth.G Forest areas 1ha or
under in size are simply not able to meet these criteria.

The Finnish FSC standard will require at least 5% of all
commercial forests to be permanently set aside from all
logging operations.H In addition, 10% of commercial forests will
be permanently protected from clear cutting, only allowing
for selective logging. Furthermore, valuable habitats and their
buffer zones (minimum width of 20 metres) will be protected
in all cases, even if their area exceeds the 5% set-aside quota.
The habitats protected under the FSC standard will include the
important habitats as listed in national legislation and those
protected under the FFCS, as well as a number of other valuable
habitats that are not protected by FFCS or national legislation
(such as certain spruce mires). The definition of Habitats of
Special Importance given by the Forest Act will be extended

F  Habitats listed in category three of protected habitats under the FFCS are: alluvial forests and flood meadows; herb-rich swamps; fens in Lapland
  province; sunny slopes of ridges and kettle holes; and old-growth forests.

G  The FFCS criteria for old-growth forest are: ‘The dominant tree stand is usually significantly older (more than 1.5 times) than the recommended

forest rotation age in the area; the stand usually consists of trees of different sizes and species forming several canopy layers, or the forest is a spruce
stand of a late succession stage; the tree stand has not been treated by selective logging, intermediate thinning or preparatory felling in the last 60 years;
the stand is composed of [includes] old broadleaved trees, plenty of (at least 20% of the tree stand) decaying trees, snags and ground [fallen] trees.’

H  The set-aside area can include legally protected areas, areas in official protection programmes, and areas designated for protection in official land-use

plans, provided that the landowner has not received compensation for the protected land.

so that the qualitative requirements are less strict and these
habitats are protected regardless of their size. Old-growth and
‘near-natural’ forests and other high-conservation-value forests
will also be protected regardless of their size or owner.

FFCS Criterion 11. Known habitats
of threatened species are safeguarded

Criterion 11 does not protect threatened species or require
their mapping. Instead it requires their preservation only if their
habitats have been ‘demarcated by Regional Environment Centres’,
as required under the Nature Conservation Act (see Section 2.2).
As the Environment Centres have demarcated only 15 individual
habitats of specially protected species in the past seven years, and
have very limited resources for further demarcation and mapping,
this is clearly not an adequate state of affairs.

In their evaluation of compliance with Criterion 11, FFCS certifiers
are required to check that none of the habitats demarcated
by Environment Centres have been destroyed. However, with
so few demarcations having been undertaken,  it is reasonable
to assume that Criterion 11 will rarely be violated. Examples of
this problem have been encountered during field inspections by
environmental NGOs in FFCS-certified state forests. In dozens
of cases old-growth forests with reported occurrences of
threatened species have been clearcut. However, none of these
cases can be classified as a violation of FFCS Criterion 11, as
Environment Centres had not demarcated the habitats.

A prime example of the inadequacies of the current situation
involves one of Finland’s best-known threatened species, the

Finland and Estonia are the only European countries where the
IUCN red-listed flying squirrel is found.

flying squirrel. In April 2004, The European Commission has
referred Finland to the European Court of Justice for its failure
properly to protect this species. The revision of the FFCS provided
an opportunity for forest certification to move beyond inadequate
legislation and to ensure greater protection for the species, but no
action was taken.

The FSC standard, in contrast to the FFCS, will demand the
protection of all ‘known populations of both nationally and
regionally threatened species’ and their habitats and associated
buffer zones (FSC Criteria 6.3 and 6.4). Thus, forest owners and
loggers will be expected to preserve all known populations of
threatened species, not only those demarcated by Environment
Centres. The FSC standard also has provisions which will protect
regionally threatened species that are omitted by both the FFCS
and national legislation.

FFCS Criterion 12. Trees are
retained in regeneration areas

Criterion 12 focuses on the number of trees that need to be
retained following logging operations. Retention trees can be a
mix of living and dead trees and their main purpose is to provide
a supply of dead wood (immediately or in the near future, in
the case of living trees) for species that use dead wood as their
habitat or source of food.

One of the most serious negative impacts of industrial
forestry on biodiversity in boreal forests is the decrease in the
amount and quality of dead wood. Dead wood is a vital habitat
for many fungi, invertebrates and birds. The amount of dead
and decaying wood in a commercial forest is only a fraction
of the amount found in a natural boreal forest, because in
commercial practice trees are usually logged before they begin
to decay. In good forest management practice dead trees
should be preserved as a matter of course, but this is not the
case with FFCS.

In the revised FFCS standard, the number of living and dead
trees required to be retained is ‘at least 5–10 per hectare’ instead
of the ‘at least 5 trees per hectare’ specified in the original
standard. This could be seen as an improvement in the standard,
but it is undermined by allowing very small trees to be classified
as retention trees, since smaller trees have a lesser ecological
value. Further, trees left in the buffer zones of water bodies
(Criterion 16) can also be counted towards the total number
of retention trees, again undermining any potential ecological
benefit from changes to this criterion.

According to the Finnish FSC standard, all dead trees will be
preserved unless the total exceeds 10m3/ha. In addition, 10–
20m3/ha of living trees will be saved as retention trees (including
a minimum of 10 trees per hectare with a trunk diameter of at
least 20cm). The FSC standard will also require that, when it
does not already exist, dead wood should be created by killing
living trees by ring-barking or other methods.

Under the FSC standard, bird-nesting trees and trees over 200
years old will not be allowed to be logged, whereas in FFCS-
certified forests nesting trees can be felled and the logging of
ancient trees, of whatever age, is also allowed.

14

FFCS Criterion 13. Genetically modified seed and
plant material is not used

This criterion requires that ‘genetically modified material or
other material which is not approved by the national authority
[the Inspection Centre for Plant Production] should not be used
in seeding and planting.’ Thus the FFCS standard would allow
the use of genetically modified trees if the Inspection Centre for
Plant Production were to accept them.

The FSC standard will prohibit the use of genetically
modified organisms.

FFCS Criterion 15. Prescribed burning promotes
diversity of species dependent on burned areas

A number of threatened species in Finland require naturally
burned areas, and in particular burned wood material, for
their survival (burning caused by lightning is part of the
natural dynamic of boreal forests). In the FFCS, the target
area prescribed for burning after logging is about 6,700ha
across the whole country over a five-year period. Prescribed
burning carried out with government funding in protected
areas is also included in the evaluation of this criterion,
although this activity has no connection to FFCS certification,
which is focused on commercial forests.

In FSC-certified forests of more than 1,000ha at least
5% of ‘Myrtillus’ (according to the Finnish classification of
forest types) and less productive forest areas will have to
be burned after logging during a five-year period. This will
lead to a significant increase in the amount of burned wood
as the FSC requires more standing trees to be left in the area
after logging than does the FFCS. Indeed, the FFCS standard
does not specifically define how much timber is to be retained
after logging in areas to be burned. The burned areas can be
normal clearcuts, in which case the operation results in very
little burned wood being left behind. Under the FSC standard,
at least 20m3/ha of wood (trunk diameter at least 20cm)
will have to be left on logged sites that are to be burned
(Criterion 6.3.8.).

FFCS Criterion 16. Buffer zones are left along
watercourses and small water bodies to capture
nutrient run-off
Buffer zones alongside watercourses and water bodies have
two important functions for the protection of biodiversity.
Firstly, habitats close to water are valuable in their own right
for a number of species. Secondly, buffer zones protect aquatic
ecosystems from nutrient run-off that results from forest
management operations.

This criterion has been weakened further in the revision of
the FFCS standard. The new buffer zone width required is only
3–5m (instead of 5–10m in the previous standard) and even this
zone can be logged. The only requirement is that on this strip
90% of the soil surface is protected from scarification (such as
ploughing) or fertilisation.

The Finnish FSC standard will require untouched buffer zones
at least 20m in width. In exceptional cases, ‘for restoration or
scenic reasons or in order to improve the nutrient-absorbing
capacity of the site’, cautious selective logging may be applied
within the buffer zones (Criterion 6.5.2).

FFCS Criterion 17. Peatland nature is preserved

This criterion is weak because of the number of exceptions
allowed to its implementation. First-time draining is not
supposed to be carried out in peatlands which are still in a
natural state. However, such peatlands are defined in such a
way as to make their identification difficult. Moreover, ‘single
ditches’ can be drained even in peatlands in a natural state
– thereby potentially ensuring that they will no longer be in
such a state. The criterion further allows for supplementary
ditching in ecologically valuable wooded mire types such
as some spruce mires, which are high in biodiversity. These
habitats are not protected from any of the forestry operations
harmful to their ecological value (draining, soil scarification
and clearcuts are all allowed).

J  The use of pesticides and herbicides is prohibited in classes 1 and 2 of the classification of Finnish groundwater areas. Groundwater areas have been
  classified according to their importance as fresh water sources and their need for protection.

CERTIFYING EXTINCTION?
AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REVISED STANDARDS OF THE FINNISH FOREST CERTIFICATION SYSTEM

15

Ditching of forests and swamps has not only
caused a decline in species dependent on
natural ecosystems, but it also has severe
effects on water quality.

The Finnish FSC standard will not allow any ditching
of rare peatland habitats; furthermore, it will require
implementation of a restoration plan for valuable habitats
that have been drained but still show some characteristics
of their natural state (Criterion 6.2). The draft standard
stipulates that ‘undrained peatlands, marshy sites, or
even parts of such sites shall not be drained.'

FFCS Criterion 19. The quality of important
groundwater areas is not degraded with
chemical pesticides or fertilisers and
Criterion 20. Use of chemical herbicides and
pesticides is avoided in forest management

In the FFCS standard the use of chemical pesticides and
herbicides is only prohibited in important groundwater
areas J and important habitats as defined in Criterion 10.
Elsewhere, they can be used ‘for the control of ground
vegetation in forest regeneration areas, for stump
treatment of broadleaved trees, to control pine weevil,
and for treatment of coniferous timber stores in the
vicinity of forests’. As for the use of chemical fertilisers,
no buffer zone is required between fertilised areas and
watercourses or water bodies.

The FSC standard will allow the use of fertilisers only
in forests with nutrient imbalances that have been
confirmed in chemical analyses. A buffer zone of at least
50m will have to be left between fertilised areas and
watercourses or water bodies. Furthermore, according
to the FSC standard, ‘biological or mechanical methods
shall be used for pest and weed management instead of
chemical pesticides.’

5.  SOCIAL CRITERIA IN RELATION

TO REINDEER HERDING

In recent years there has been increasing concern
among both indigenous Sámi and non-Sámi reindeer
herders at the destructive logging practices of the state
forest enterprise Metsähallitus in traditional reindeer
grazing forests.37 Most of these are old-growth forests.
The logging damages reindeer grazing areas and reduces
the availability of tree lichen,38 a valuable winter food
source for reindeer.39

5.1.   Sámi culture and reindeer

husbandry in the FFCS standard

The aim of FFCS Criteria 27 and 28 is to safeguard Sámi
culture and to integrate the traditional livelihood of reindeer
husbandry with forestry. Criterion 27 requires that ‘in the
Sámi homelands the management, use and protection of
natural resources administered by Metsähallitus should
be integrated in co-operation with the Sámi parliament,
reindeer herders and other representatives of traditional
livelihoods to safeguard the facilities for Sámi culture and
traditional livelihoods.’ Criterion 28 requires Metsähallitus
to integrate forest management activities with reindeer
husbandry ‘so that the conditions for reindeer husbandry
are safeguarded’.

Considering these criteria, it is hard to see how the
Forestry Centre of Lapland could have been certified
according to the FFCS. Virtually all reindeer herding
co-operatives in the Sámi area have published written
statements denouncing Metsähallitus’ logging plans.
Most of the co-operatives have produced maps of
important grazing forests and demanded an end to
destructive logging in these areas – with few tangible
results.40 One co-operative has a complaint pending to
the United Nations Human Rights Commission concerning
the destructive effects of planned logging. The case has
not yet affected logging plans in the area, and logging
operations will remain FFCS-certified.

The major problem with these FFCS criteria is the
failure to define ‘co-operation’ or effectively to evaluate
whether this has taken place. Criterion 27 is defined in
such a way that actual agreement between Metsähallitus
and the Sámi is not expected; instead the certification
body ‘assesses conformity to the criterion on the basis
of the co-operation that has been carried out’. Without a
definition of what that co-operation should consist of, the
assessment of whether this criterion has been met appears
to be entirely arbitrary, and left moreover in the hands
of certifiers who primarily represent the interests of the
forestry industry.

According to reindeer herders, ‘co-operation’ mostly
consists of informing communities of where and when
logging will take place.41 In the few cases where there have
been negotiations, the herders have been informed that
logging volumes will not be reduced as a result. At best, the
herders have been able to influence which area within their
co-operative is logged first. The situation is exacerbated by
the absence of a transparent and independent complaints
procedure. As they are unable to make complaints, reindeer
herders are powerless to influence whether the timber
logged within their herding area is certified by the FFCS.

5.2.   Sámi culture and reindeer

husbandry in the FSC standard

The corresponding criteria of the draft FSC standard (3.1,
3.2, 3.3) require that ‘forest management shall not threaten
or diminish, either directly or indirectly, the resources or
tenure rights of indigenous peoples’ and that sites of ‘special
cultural, ecological, economic or religious significance’ to the
Sámi must be identified with the Sámi and recognised and
protected by forest managers.

The greatest differences between the FSC and FFCS
criteria lie in their respective indicators. While the FFCS
only requires that there has been co-operation, regardless
of its results, the draft FSC standard requires that
reindeer herders must accept and officially approve all of
Metsähallitus’ logging plans in their area. Moreover, the FSC
standard stipulates that forest management plans must
protect sites important to the Sámi culture, and that the
relevant maps and management plans must be endorsed by
the Sámi parliament.

Thus, both standards deal with the issues of Sámi culture
and reindeer husbandry, but only the FSC standard includes
assessment with performance-based indicators that will
truly verify that consensus between loggers and the Sámi
people or other reindeer herders has been reached.

Kalevi Paadar, a Sámi reindeer herder, has already lost most
of the old-growth forest his reindeer used to range in.

6.  THE EXCLUSION OF

CONTROVERSIAL TIMBER

Certification standards, as well as addressing forest
management issues, should also include a system for dealing
with uncertified forest products that enter the certified supply
chain. The aim of such a system is to ensure that timber from
‘controversial’ sources (such as illegal logging or uncertified
high-conservation-value forests) cannot enter that supply
chain at any stage of processing.

materials or products do not contain any wood raw material
from illegal sources’. No reference is made to other types of
controversial source, and the system relies on self-declaration
from suppliers to ensure legality. Consequently, it is possible that
large amounts of illegal timber from Russia are entering Finnish
mills for processing, with the resulting timber products still being
labelled as from FFCS or PEFC certified forests.K

This issue is particularly relevant in Finland given the amount
of uncertified timber that is imported each year from Russia
to meet the capacity of the country’s paper mills. Illegal logging
remains a major problem in Russia’s forestry system, with up
to 50% of all timber estimated to come from illegal sources.
In 2002 Finland imported approximately 13.3 million cubic metres
of industrial roundwood from Russia, which equates to nearly
one-fifth of all timber consumed in Finland during that year.4 2

The FFCS chain of custody policy43 states that companies must
provide ‘at least a signed self-declaration that supplied raw

In the FSC policy44 the definition of ‘controversial sources’
goes much wider, including illegal timber, timber from uncertified
high-conservation-value forests, timber from GM trees and
timber from areas where traditional or civil rights have been
violated in the course of timber extraction. Companies have
to take ‘reasonable measures’ to exclude any timber from
these sources. Current revision of the FSC’s chain of custody
requirements means that verification of supplier claims
regarding potentially controversial sources will have to be
undertaken to confirm that such sources are completely
excluded from the supply chain.

Russian logs being loaded for transport to Finland.

K  Beyond the issue of legality, forest management standards in north-west Russia, which is the major supply area for Finnish importers, are the
  poorest in Europe. Clearcuts predominate all over this area, with cutting blocks of up to 50ha. Effective reforestation takes place on less
  than half of the area clearcut annually; the tending of young secondary stands happens only occasionally. Poor forestry standards continue to
  degrade accessible forests and pose a growing threat to the last ancient forests and protected areas in the region.

7.  CONCLUSIONS AND

RECOMMENDATIONS

We further call on the companies who continue to buy Finland’s
forest products to:

•   implement environmentally and socially responsible

procurement policies, which specify FSC-certified timber
and paper that contains FSC and/or recycled fibres

•   ensure suppliers are not receiving timber products from
old-growth or potential high-conservation-value forest
areas (as mapped by environmental NGOs)

•   encourage Finnish timber companies to certify their own
forests according to the Finnish FSC standard and to start
demanding FSC-certified timber from their suppliers.

The FFCS has failed to provide any credible guarantee that
Finnish timber products originate from forests managed in an
environmentally or socially responsible fashion. Old-growth
logging continues, inadequate protection is given to habitats of
threatened species and social conflicts remain unresolved. The
situation is exacerbated by the failure of the FFCS effectively to
regulate the use of the uncertified imported timber that is relied
upon to meet the capacity of Finland’s sawmills.

Poor forestry practices in Finland have been rewarded in the
market place by retailers and other companies keen to obtain
certified timber and paper products. These companies are
given the impression either that the FFCS can provide credible
guarantees of forest management standards, or that standards
will improve over time. Yet the reality is that with recent
revisions the FFCS standard has actually been weakened in
two key criteria. Other weaknesses have remained unchanged.
The likelihood is that unless practices change in Finland,
endangered species will be pushed to extinction and the
traditional livelihoods of indigenous communities will be lost,
all with the FFCS or PEFC stamp of approval.

But this is an economic as well as an environmental and social
issue. Progressive companies are beginning to change their
procurement practices in response to consumer demands
for timber products that can genuinely be said to come from
well-managed forests. The UK-based retailer B&Q, part of the
Kingfisher group, has this year revised its timber procurement
policies so that products originating from Finland will be phased
out. Meanwhile, the German postal service, Deutsche Post,
has implemented procurement guidelines to prevent the use of
pulp from mills in the north of Finland which are linked to timber
from old-growth forests, and has started to offer FSC-certified
envelopes in its post offices. Given such developments the
question is how the Finnish logging industry will respond to the
continued damage that is being inflicted, not just on Finland’s
biodiversity and the livelihood of indigenous communities, but,
increasingly, on its own reputation and market share.

The environmental organisations which co-authored this report
want to see positive change in Finland’s forests. In order to
achieve that change we call on Finland’s timber companies to:

•   FSC-certify their own forest holdings and encourage their
major suppliers (Metsähallitus, Tornator) to move towards
FSC certification

•   phase out all timber that comes from high-conservation-

value forests, working in conjunction with Finnish
environmental organisations, the scientific community and
reindeer herding co-operatives to identify these areas

•   take an active role in pushing for timely and adequate

political solutions to stop the degradation of biodiversity.
