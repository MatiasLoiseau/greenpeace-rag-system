‘For too long, the world
acted as if the oceans were
somehow a realm apart – as
areas owned by no-one, free
for all, with little need for
care or management. The
Law of the Sea Convention
and other landmark legal
instruments have brought
important progress over the
past two decades in
protecting ﬁsheries and
marine ecosystems. But this
common heritage of all
humankind continues to
face profound pressures.’

‘The law of the sea seemed to unite humanism, the attempt to
build a human law and order, and romanticism, the love of nature
and of the oceans as part of nature. It offered a starting point for
a new philosophy – an “ecological worldview” – and a new
economic theory – sustainable development, the economics of
the common heritage.’

Elizabeth Mann Borgese, in Freedom for the Seas in the 21st Century
(1993)

Scientists and corporations are increasingly interested in the genetic
specialisations of marine organisms. Emerging activities like
bioprospecting are developing at the cutting edge of science and
outside of any regulatory framework. New evidence of the threats to
marine life from climate change, invasive species and ocean noise may
also have signiﬁcant impacts on ocean life. A recent report by the Royal
Society, the UK's national academy of science, suggests that if global
emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities continue to rise at
current rates, the average pH of the oceans could fall by 0.5 units -
equivalent to a rate of change one hundred times that of past millennia.
The magnitude and scale of this change is enormous and biological
effects are inevitable. Calcifying organisms such as corals, which rely on
calcium carbonate to generate supporting life structures, are thought to
be most at risk.1 Other known consequences of climate change are
increased storm surges and wave activity, an increase in sea
temperatures and ultimately, a shift in ocean currents.

The crisis facing marine life now looms larger than at any time in
the past. If we are serious about food security, particularly for
the millions of people dependent on the marine environment in
developing countries, then there is no time to lose in revisiting
Pardo’s proposal by closing the gaps in oceans governance,
establishing an international insurance policy for marine life
through a global network of no-take marine reserves, and
building capacity to ensure that monitoring, control and
enforcement of existing and emerging activities are strictly for
the beneﬁt of future generations and the planet as a whole.

Part 1:
Freedom for the Seas in the 21st Century

When Hugo Grotius expressed the notion of Freedom of the Seas
– mare liberum – in 1609, ﬁshing was done with wooden
sailboats and it was presumed that the oceans were limitless
and inexhaustible. Most of the world’s oceans were too far, too
deep, too rough, too cold or too dangerous to ﬁsh. In practice,
this meant that ﬁshing was only possible in the 10-12% of the
world's oceans that are now viewed as coastal waters. In other
words, almost 90% of the oceans were no-ﬁshing zones: de
facto marine reserves. Today, with the increase in technological
and industrial efﬁciency, ﬁshing vessels are able to ﬁsh from the
Arctic to the Antarctic and to depths of 2.5 km. With the ever-
increasing evidence of collapsing ﬁsh stocks, it is clear that the
oceans’ resources are not inﬁnite and, as a result of human
activities, are diminishing at an alarming rate. The marine safe-
havens of Grotius’ day no longer exist, and the oceans are no
longer boundless.

The challenges facing our oceans in the 21st Century require that the
primacy of the concept of “Freedom for the Seas” (Libertas Mari) be
restored. The international community must act now on its
commitments to protect the marine environment, so that future
generations have the freedom to enjoy the beneﬁts of this last remaining
global commons sustainably and equitably.

Almost four decades ago, Arvid Pardo, the UN Ambassador for Malta,
developed the concept of the common heritage of humankind in relation
to ocean resources. In 1967, Pardo limited his explanation of this
concept to the seabed, ocean ﬂoor and subsoil thereof, which was later
encapsulated in Article 136 of the Law of the Sea Convention and led to
the creation of the International Seabed Authority. However, Pardo
expanded on the notion of the common heritage of humankind in his
1971 ‘Draft Oceans Space Treaty’, acknowledging that while the
concept should apply to mineral resources because their exploitation
was imminent, it should eventually be expanded to ﬁsheries as they
could be similarly exploited in the future. Pardo argued that all ocean
space beyond areas of national jurisdiction – through the water column
to the seabed – must be managed in such a way as to ensure that its
resources are viewed as the common heritage of humankind and its
beneﬁts sustainably and equitably shared.

Part II: The Final Frontier:
Filling The Voids in Deep Ocean Space

The United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS) provides the
fundamental framework – the constitution – for global oceans
governance. To date, the Agreements in Part XI of UNCLOS regarding
seabed mining and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA)
have implemented a number of the key principles contained within
UNCLOS. Greenpeace believes that the time is ripe for a third UNCLOS
implementing agreement – a comprehensive, legally binding agreement
which will implement the UNCLOS provisions relating to the duties of
States to cooperate in the protection of the marine environment of the
high seas. In addition to harmonising institutional mandates and
improving coordination, this implementing agreement would facilitate the
establishment of a global network of high seas marine reserves. It would
further establish an “Interpol for the oceans” – a centralised monitoring,
control and enforcement agency. These components are essential to
ensure that the living resources of the high seas global commons are
sustainably and equitably managed for now and for the future.

The existing international oceans regulatory system does not cover
biodiversity protection on the high seas explicitly and comprehensively:

• Even where a patchwork of commitments exist, there is often a lack
of political will to secure the long-term well-being of ocean life over
short-term self-interest;

• there is little sanction against non-compliance;

• the membership of States to international agreements is limited and
non-members are not required to comply with conservation and
management measures;

Building on the existing provisions and set within the broad framework
of UNCLOS, any revised regime should principally:

• Provide a clear mandate and legal duty to protect biodiversity on the

high seas, based on ecosystem-based management and the
precautionary principle;

• promote coordination and harmonisation between relevant

international and regional instruments;

• clarify the rules governing access to, and the sharing of beneﬁts

derived from, high seas genetic resources;

• provide adequate implementation tools, including a mandate to

establish and manage marine reserves in areas beyond the limits of
national jurisdiction; and

• establish an effective centralised monitoring, control and surveillance

mechanism for human activities on the high seas.

Modelled on the 1995 UNFSA, a new implementing agreement under
the auspices of UNCLOS should be drawn up to address these ﬁve
principle objectives through a list of detailed provisions.

The new implementing agreement would elaborate on and provide for
the implementation of existing provisions of UNCLOS Part XII on the
Protection and Preservation of the Marine Environment and Parts VII
and XI concerning the high seas and the seabed, subsoil and ocean
ﬂoor beyond areas of national jurisdiction (the Area), obliging States to
take speciﬁc measures to protect biodiversity.

• there is insufﬁcient coordination among and between the different

relevant instruments;

Box 1
Short-term conservation measures

• there is a lack of clear rules governing access to and the sharing of

beneﬁts derived from high seas genetic resources;

• there is a lack of adequate implementation tools such as a mandate
to establish marine reserves (no-take zones) in areas beyond the
limits of national jurisdiction; and

• monitoring, control and surveillance of extractive and potentially

polluting activities, particularly ﬁshing on the high seas, is inadequate.

The current piecemeal approach and voluntary measures for the
conservation of high seas biodiversity are simply insufﬁcient to ensure
that States take action to effectively protect the unknown treasures of
the open ocean. In addition to adopting immediate short-term
measures (see box 1), it is necessary to revise the current oceans
governance system in order to achieve the conservation objectives of
the UNCLOS and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in the
medium to long-term.

Without immediate action to protect marine biodiversity from the most
acute pressures, many of the deep secrets of our oceans will be lost
before we can secure their long-term protection. Short-term
measures that the international community must take now are:

• Immediate implementation of United Nations General Assembly

(UNGA) Resolution 61/105 on high seas bottom trawling to ensure
that States meet their obligations under the CBD, UNCLOS, the
World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Programme of
Implementation and the UNFSA to effectively conserve the benthic
marine environment;

• The establishment of a centralised monitoring, control and
surveillance authority to regulate the activities of high seas
ﬁshing vessels;

• The deﬁnition of the term ‘genuine link’ for ﬁshing vessels; and

• A prohibition on all at-sea transshipments of ﬁsh and ﬁsh products.

sustainable manner, and based on the ecosystem approach and
precautionary principle as stipulated in the UNFSA and Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible
Fisheries;

• build on existing inventories to develop a list of priority areas for

biodiversity protection;

• establish a centralised monitoring, control and surveillance agency

with a register and database of all high seas ﬁshing vessels;

• encourage information and knowledge sharing on high seas

biodiversity through the creation of a central list of high seas species
available to all;

• provide for the management of as yet unknown emerging activities;

• establish a secretariat and a scientiﬁc committee in order to carry out

the terms of the agreement;

• support shared and collaborative scientiﬁc research for the
identiﬁcation of areas and species of special concern;

• secure long-term funding for the management and enforcement of
marine reserves as well as sustainable oceans management across
the high seas;

• secure long-term funding for capacity building to address the

common but differentiated needs of developing country coastal
States and their key roles in management and enforcement;

• set a timetable for review of implementation of the agreement.

Greenpeace International Black Holes in Deep Ocean Space 5

The advantages of using UNCLOS rather than the CBD or other
agreements as the legal basis for such an agreement are:

• UNCLOS is regarded as the framework agreement that delimits

ocean areas and details state rights and duties in the high seas and
the ‘Area’;

• UNCLOS’s broad remit already covers most or all activities that
impact on marine biodiversity, including, for example, emerging
activities such as bioprospecting, noise pollution and the introduction
of alien species; and

• UNCLOS provides a binding dispute settlement mechanism.

Such an agreement would not require any amendment to the text of the
Convention. It would further be consistent with Article 22(2) of the CBD,
which already obliges contracting parties to implement the Convention
“with respect to the marine environment consistently with the rights and
obligations of States under the Law of the Sea.”

In addition to the more general objectives mentioned above, the new
implementing agreement must include a list of detailed provisions,
including:

• recognition of the high seas as an area of scientiﬁc value for peaceful
purposes, as well as a natural reserve that is part of the common
heritage of humankind;

• lay down the general principles of the precautionary and ecosystem
approach as the core components for the conservation of marine
biodiversity on the high seas;

• consolidate existing provisions, such as those included in the

UNFSA, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) framework etc,
and bring them into the context of biodiversity protection;

• prohibit highly destructive practices in areas beyond the limits of

national jurisdiction;

• give a clear mandate for the identiﬁcation, selection, establishment

and management of high seas marine reserves;

• identify ecological and practical criteria and guidelines for the

establishment of high seas marine reserves;

• oblige the establishment of a management plan for marine reserves;

• oblige States to establish regional environmental management
organisations in high seas areas to regulate human activities in
speciﬁc regions of interest;

• require prior environmental impact assessment (EIA) and approval for

all activities planned to occur on the high seas;

• require that all high seas ﬁsheries are managed in a responsible and

Part III: Conclusions
Charting the way towards comprehensive regulation
for the conservation of high seas biodiversity

The international waters of the high seas are our common heritage.
Most of the resources of this global commons are non-renewable. The
high seas must therefore be considered off limits to extractive and
disposal activities unless and until it can be shown that these activities
do not cause harm to the surrounding environment. The protection of
marine biodiversity on the high seas requires a collective approach and
a clear political commitment from all States.

A new UNCLOS implementing agreement needs to ﬁll the gaping void in
the current regime for the protection of marine biodiversity by
establishing a strong institutional framework for high seas biodiversity
protection. Building on existing structures and, where necessary,
reforming or creating new bodies, coordination, cooperation and
compliance with existing provisions must be improved. It must also be
ﬂexible enough to allow for potential future activities to be brought into
the regulatory framework. Particularly important is the consideration of
implementing tools and enforcement mechanisms.

The implementing agreement should further provide a clear mandate for
the establishment and protection of high seas marine reserves as well
as the tools necessary to enforce reserves and other high seas
conservation measures. To this end it must put in place an effective
monitoring, surveillance and control system for all high seas ﬁshing
vessels, including a mandate to protect the integrity of high seas marine
reserves.

Short-term interim measures must be taken to protect the deep-sea
from its current most serious threats – particularly destructive practices
such as high seas bottom trawling. But if nation States are serious
about protecting the marine biodiversity of the high seas, then
negotiations must start now for a new UNCLOS implementing
agreement that can ensure that the duties to protect and conserve high
seas biodiversity are spelled out for all States, and that the pressures
being faced by this ﬁnal frontier that is the common heritage of all
humankind can be sustainably and equitably managed for now and for
the future.

Appendix 1
Existing mechanisms for governing the high seas

UNCLOS and the CBD provide the international legal framework
governing the protection of the marine environment. However, there is no
overarching legally binding agreement that effectively and
comprehensively addresses the protection of biodiversity on the high
seas, and is able to effectively implement the relevant provisions
contained in these conventions. A brief summary of some of the key
elements of these conventions vis-à-vis biodiversity conservation follows.

1 UNCLOS

While UNCLOS offers States the right to use our oceans as well as the
duty to conserve them, it fails to provide explicit tools for the
implementation of environmental protection provisions. One exception is
the obligation for States to cooperate in determining the total allowable
catch for living resources being exploited on the high seas (Article 119).
In addition, ﬁsheries management measures for straddling and highly
migratory stocks are further elaborated in the UNFSA. However, to date
this agreement does not apply to discrete deep-sea stocks, and thus
leaves a huge gap in the international management regime for a number
of deep-sea ﬁsheries.

Box 3
Gaps in governance of high seas biodiversity

• No formal recognition of the need to protect biodiversity on the

high seas and no mechanism with a mandate to do so.

• No mandate for the protection of areas on the high seas for

conservation purposes.

• No conservation enforcement mechanism and competent

enforcement body.

• No framework for access to, and beneﬁt sharing of, living marine

resources on the high seas.

• Insufﬁcient geographic coverage and lack of competent ﬁsheries

management.

• Emerging activities, such as bioprospecting, remain outside the

regulatory framework.

• Lack of regulation of ocean noise and its potential impacts on

marine life.

• No regulation of discrete deep-sea ﬁsh stocks.

2 CBD

In addition to responsible ﬁsheries management, an important tool to
help comprehensively protect marine biodiversity is the establishment of
a global network of marine reserves. The UN Millennium Project calls for
10% of the oceans to be covered by marine reserves in the short to
medium-term, with a long-term goal of 30%. In 2004, echoing pledges
taken at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), the
CBD’s 7th Conference of the Parties (CoP 7) committed to the
establishment of a global network of marine protected areas by 2012
(Decision VII/28). According to Decision VII/5, such a network should be
composed of:

“comprehensive, effectively managed, and ecologically representative
national and regional systems of protected areas that collectively…
contribute to achieving the three objectives of the Convention and the
2010 target to signiﬁcantly reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss”.

The CBD is the primary instrument providing direction to States for the
establishment of marine protected areas and marine reserves in waters
under their jurisdiction. The CBD further holds States responsible for the
regulation of activities and processes within and beyond the limits of
national jurisdiction, irrespective of where their impact may be felt,
provided they occur under the control of a Contracting Party2. This
obliges Parties to apply the Convention to all its activities either in the
EEZ or on the high seas, and acknowledges the need for protective
measures in areas beyond national jurisdiction. It does not, however,
oblige States to take collective measures to protect the high seas.

Greenpeace deﬁnition of Marine Reserves

Marine reserves are one type of Marine Protected Area. In terms of
protecting the marine environment, they offer the highest level of
protection - much like national parks in the sea. They are closed to all
extractive uses, such as ﬁshing and mining, as well as to industrial
and disposal activities. Greenpeace calls for a network of large-scale
marine reserves to cover around 40% of the ocean surface. Within
these areas there may be core zones where no human activities are
allowed, for instance areas that act as scientiﬁc reference areas or
areas where there are particularly sensitive habitats or species.

Greenpeace International Black Holes in Deep Ocean Space 7

3. Regional Fisheries Management Organisations

Articles 5 and 6 of the UNFSA require the application of the ecosystem
and precautionary approach to ﬁsheries through the mechanism of
Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs). Of the 30
RFMOs mandated under the UNFSA to regulate and protect straddling
or highly migratory stocks, only ﬁve are competent to manage all or
most of the living marine resources falling within their regulatory areas.
The mandate of the others is limited to cover certain speciﬁc species,
such as tuna. Almost all of the existing RFMOs fail to explicitly provide
for the application of the ecosystem approach or precautionary principle
in ﬁsheries management. Only the Commission for the Conservation of
Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the Southeast
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) are speciﬁcally mandated in
their constitutional agreements to implement the ecosystem approach
to ﬁsheries management. SEAFO has yet to adopt and implement any
measures applying this approach to its convention area. Even CCAMLR,
with its proactive mandate and conservation measures, struggles to
deal with the scourge of illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) ﬁshing
by ﬂag-of-convenience vessels, non-parties, and in some cases its own
parties, who fail to abide by its rules.

In both its 2002 and 2004 review of the state of the world’s ﬁsheries, the
FAO noted this lack of an explicit mandate in RFMOs for ecosystem-
based ﬁsheries management. The review suggests that extending the
number of RFMOs with a mandate to adopt an ecosystem approach, as
well as forging closer links between environmental and ﬁsheries
organisations, will facilitate better and more effective implementation3.

Fundamental change and reform of RFMOs is urgently needed if they
are to adapt to the governance challenges of this century. These must
go hand in hand with innovative developments in high seas oceans
management if the oceans governance challenges of today and the
future are to be met.

Even if RFMO management was adequate to protect high seas
biodiversity, the limited geographical coverage of RFMOs with the
competence to regulate deep-sea ﬁsheries and their impacts on the
benthic environment, leaves approximately three-quarters of the high
seas completely unregulated. The UN Secretary-General has reported
the gaps in coverage as being the southeast Paciﬁc Ocean for all ﬁsh
stocks, and the southwest Atlantic, southeast Paciﬁc, west-central
Paciﬁc, Indian Ocean and the Caribbean for straddling ﬁsh stocks and
discrete high seas ﬁsh stocks.4 Negotiations are ongoing for new
RFMOs for the South and North Paciﬁc.

8 Greenpeace International Black Holes in Deep Ocean Space

Institutional weaknesses of RFMOs

• Decision-making is often weak and driven by a need to reach

consensus rather than based on ecological or scientiﬁc grounds.
The small number of States party to RFMOs and the possibility of
opting out of decisions by lodging a reservation further weakens
decision making.

• Many RFMOs are not required by their constitutions to apply the
precautionary approach or ecosystem approach to ﬁsheries, so
scientiﬁc advice and uncertainties are not adequately translated
into the decision-making process.

• Member States fail to take action against non-Members and

Members acting in breach of agreed measures. Member States
may continue to issue licenses to vessels that have breached
RFMO provisions.

• Constitutional and institutional incapacity means many RFMOs
have a single species focus and do not account for impacts on
associated and dependent species.

• Lack of international direction and inadequate coordination among

RFMOs weakens their ability to tackle IUU ﬁshing.

In addition to the provisions of UNCLOS, the UNFSA and related
instruments, and the CBD, there are also a number of voluntary,
species-speciﬁc or sectoral agreements that collectively set out a
piecemeal governance structure for managing human activities on the
high seas.

The FAO’s 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and 2001
International Plan of Action (IPOA) to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU
ﬁshing attempt to address some of these issues. Although these
agreements apply to all ﬁshing activities, including those ﬁsheries not
covered by the UNFSA (i.e. discrete stocks), both the Code of Conduct
and IPOA-IUU are voluntary agreements and therefore lack the weight
and the ‘teeth’ (i.e. ability to impose sanctions for violations) of legally
binding agreements. Their ineffectiveness is compounded by the lack of
the necessary political commitment by States to achieve implementation.

The Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) sets up a framework of
protection for certain species groups such as cetaceans, seals, sea
turtles and sea birds. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has
continued to uphold a politically fragile moratorium on commercial
whaling since 1982, despite a year-on-year struggle to maintain support
for such a measure. However, more positively, the IWC has succeeded
in designating two whale sanctuaries in high seas areas5.

As for the signiﬁcant proportion of high seas biodiversity that is
sedentary, i.e. living on and/or attached to the sea ﬂoor, the regulatory
system is considerably weaker. Whereas coastal States have the right
and obligation to control the exploitation of such ‘living resources’ on
their continental shelf and margin, or up to a distance of 200 nautical
miles from the coast (whichever is furthest), the responsibility for the
conservation and management of sedentary species in areas beyond
the continental shelf, and thus in most areas of the high seas, remains
unclear under UNCLOS. Their exploitation is thus unregulated. This
leaves another huge vacuum in the protection of such species, many of
which are currently of most interest to bioprospectors. UNCLOS further
contains no explicit provisions regulating the use or equitable beneﬁt
sharing of genetic resources derived from marine organisms living in
either the water column or seabed of the high seas.

4. IMO

The IMO, established in 1958 under the UN umbrella, regulates all
activities related to shipping and, as part of its mandate, introduces
environmental protection measures to address pollution and other
adverse effects from shipping. Although its mandate does not explicitly
cover biodiversity protection, the IMO has established a number of
relevant instruments including the International Convention for the
Prevention of Pollution from Ships (as modiﬁed by the MARPOL
Protocol 73/78), the International Convention on the Control of Harmful
Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (not yet in force) and the International
Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water
and Sediments (not yet in force).

The IMO regime provides the possibility to deﬁne certain sea areas as
“special areas” and Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA), which are
provided with a higher level of protection than other areas of the sea.6
The control of maritime activities in PSSAs is designed to give permanent
protection and can include routing measures, strict application of
MARPOL discharge and equipment requirements for ships, such as oil
tankers; and installation of Vessel Trafﬁc Services (VTS). Far too often,
however, provisions to control the impacts of the shipping sector are still
initiated reactively and in the face of disasters, or designed to protect
near shore waters of greatest interest to coastal States.
