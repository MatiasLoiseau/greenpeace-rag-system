CRUNCH TIME
FOR CLIMATE
COMMITMENTS

Immediate action worldwide to halt deforestation and restore
extensive areas of natural forest is key to limiting climate change and
biodiversity loss. Halting and beginning to reverse the destruction
of the world’s forests for agriculture is the cheapest, quickest and
most equitable option to stabilise the climate and buy time for a just
transition to a low-carbon economy.4 However, although there is
widespread agreement on the need for rapid and far-reaching action,
political and corporate commitments are failing to translate into
measurable results on the ground.

Agricultural commodities such as palm oil continue to drive deforestation
and emissions – and push endangered species like orangutans and tigers
ever closer to extinction. Time is running out. Global brands must not
walk away from the agreed milestone – an end to the link between
deforestation and globally traded commodities by no later than 2020.

In 2010, members of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF)
pledged to do their bit to protect forests and limit climate
change, with a clear commitment to clean up global
commodity supply chains by 2020.5 World governments,
emboldened by this pledge and in the knowledge that
stopping deforestation was the easiest and most cost-
effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
incorporated action to address forest destruction into the
Paris Agreement on climate change as a key part of their
strategy to mitigate global temperature rise.6 2020 targets
for halting deforestation and biodiversity loss and for
restoring degraded forests also figure in the United Nations
(UN) Sustainable Development Goals, to be implemented
by ‘all countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative
partnership’ in order to eliminate poverty and ‘to heal and
secure our planet’.7

Yet with less than two years to go until 2020,

deforestation to produce commodities such as palm oil
shows no sign of slowing down.8 Corporate commitments
and policies have proliferated, but companies have
largely failed to implement them. As a result, consumer

brands, including those with ‘no deforestation, no peat,
no exploitation’ (NDPE) policies, still use palm oil from
producers that destroy rainforests, drain carbon-rich
peatland and violate the human rights of workers and local
communities – making their customers complicit in forest
destruction, climate change and human rights abuses.

At the start of 2018, Greenpeace International challenged

16 leading members of the CGF to demonstrate their
progress towards a clean palm oil supply chain. We called on
them to disclose publicly the mills that produced their palm
oil, and the names of the producer groups that controlled
those mills. If disclosed, this information would show whether
brands had forest destroyers in their supply chains. Eight CGF
brands – Colgate-Palmolive, General Mills, Mars, Mondelēz,
Nestlé, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Reckitt Benckiser and
Unilever – were prepared to hold themselves accountable
prior to publication of this report. The others – Ferrero,
Hershey, Kellogg’s, Kraft Heinz, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo,
PZ Cussons and Smucker’s – refused to reveal who produced
their palm oil, thereby concealing the extent of their
complicity in rainforest destruction.9

Brands have failed to clean up their supply chains

– and the people and environment of palm oil-
producing countries are suffering the consequences.
Decades of deforestation for plantations has created
the ideal conditions for the raging forest and peatland
fires – often deliberately set by companies clearing
the land – that regularly threaten the health of
people across Southeast Asia and imperil our global
climate.10 Exploitation of workers, including the
use of child labour, remains endemic in the sector.11
Meanwhile, Indonesia, at the heart of the industry’s
expansion, has more threatened and endangered
species than any other country on the planet, in
many cases as a result of loss of habitat;12 leading
conservationists now talk about when,
not if, orangutans and other iconic species will
become extinct.13

Palm oil is a high-risk commodity. Palm oil traders

(typically corporations that also have plantation
interests) continue to allow oil from rainforest
destroyers into their mills, refineries and distribution
systems, and neither governments nor the main
industry body – the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm
Oil (RSPO) – can currently be relied on to prevent
producers from engaging in deforestation or clearing
peatland. Accordingly, brands must adopt NDPE policies
if they have not already done so, and take responsibility
themselves for ensuring that the producer groups14 in
their palm oil supply chains comply with those policies
as soon as possible, and no later than 2020. Equivalent
policies should be enforced across all their commodities.

The first step towards achieving this is for each
brand to publish a clear, time-bound plan, including
an explicit commitment that by 2020, 100% of the
palm oil it uses will come from producers whose entire
operations have been verified as compliant with its
NDPE policy – even if that means using less palm oil
than it is using today.

Next, brands should open themselves up to public
scrutiny by publishing complete lists of the mills and
producer groups in their supply chains. Then they must
take responsibility for investigating these producer
groups to identify any that are clearing rainforests or
peatlands, or exploiting workers or local communities.
Brands must work with traders to get concession
maps, and other data necessary to enable successful
monitoring, into the public domain. Ultimately, brands
and traders must exclude any producer that refuses to
reform, even if the palm oil it is supplying to them comes
from different concessions to those it is clearing.
By 2020, a responsible brand should be able to
demonstrate that all the palm oil it uses comes from
reputable producer groups whose operations have
been verified compliant with its NDPE policy. At the
same time, brands should support the transformation
of the entire industry by sourcing only from traders
and other suppliers that can show that all the palm oil
they sell comes from producers that have been verified
compliant with NDPE standards.

‘ Jakarta is now highly vulnerable to the
impacts of climate change. The greatest
climate and disaster-related risk facing
Jakarta is flooding, which imposes very high
human and economic costs on the city. Forty
percent of the city’s area, mostly in the
north, already lies below sea level, and is thus
vulnerable to tidal flooding, storm surges,
and future rises in sea levels.’15

ALAN KNIGHT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE,
INTERNATIONAL ANIMAL RESCUE (IAR)

Palm oil offers brands a cheap vegetable oil that is well
suited to industrial manufacturing processes. Over the last
20 years, global demand has skyrocketed as companies
reformulated their products to use palm oil instead of animal
fats such as butter or other vegetable oils and fats.17 Today
palm oil is the world’s most widely used vegetable oil.18
Approximately half of all products on supermarket

shelves now contain palm oil, including shampoos,
cosmetics, chocolate, bread and spreads.19 Palm oil has also
become a major component of biofuels: 46% of palm oil
imported into the European Union is destined for biodiesel.20
The industry’s growth is being stoked still further by new
demand for byproducts: for example, the world’s largest
processor of dairy products, Fonterra,21 has a joint venture
with the world’s largest palm oil trader, Wilmar International,
to supply animal feed made from palm kernel expeller (PKE),
a byproduct of the palm kernel milling process.22

This explosion of global demand has fuelled the rapid
expansion of the palm oil industry, particularly in Indonesia:
since 1990, Indonesia’s palm oil production has increased
more than fourteen-fold, and in 2005 it became the largest
producer of palm oil in the world.23 In 2017, Indonesia
produced 55% of the world’s palm oil; neighbouring Malaysia
produced a further 30%.24

Palm oil may be cheap, but the environment and
the people of producer regions are paying the price.
According to figures released by the Indonesian Ministry
of Environment and Forestry (MoEF), around 24 million
hectares of the country’s rainforest were destroyed
between 1990 and 201525 – an area almost the size of
the UK.26 In several years during the last decade, Indonesia
officially surpassed Brazil as the country with the largest
loss of rainforest,27 in spite of Indonesia having a much
smaller total area of forest. The plantation sector – palm
oil and pulp – is the single largest driver of deforestation
in both Indonesia and Malaysia.28 The MoEF has reported
year-on-year falls in net deforestation since 2015,29 but
these are based on figures that perversely count newly
planted industrial plantations as forest,30 and the ministry
has not yet published full statistics or downloadable maps
for 2015–2017, so the true extent of recent natural forest
loss is not in the public domain.

As they destroy the forest, the plantation industries
are wiping out biodiversity. Deforestation for pulp and oil
palm plantations has devastated lowland forests in Sumatra
and Borneo, destroying vital habitat for tigers, elephants,
rhinoceroses, orangutans and other endangered species.
Scientists estimate that just two robust breeding populations

of Sumatran tigers are left in the wild.31 All three species of
orangutan are now critically endangered; if the current rate
of population decline continues they will be extinct within
our lifetime. According to the latest assessment, Bornean
orangutan numbers fell by over 50% between 1999 and 2015,
with no more than 70,000–100,000 individuals remaining.32
Over 69% of potential habitat for the Sumatran elephant has
been destroyed within just one generation.33 The Sumatran
rhinoceros is said to be ‘hanging on by a thread’34 with fewer
than 100 left in the wild.35

The destruction of rainforests is also a major source of
greenhouse gases, making it a crisis with a truly global impact,
while the illegal use of fire to clear land before planting has
catastrophic public health effects at a regional scale. In July
2015, devastating forest and peatland fires spread across
large areas of Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. In addition to
the resultant greenhouse gas emissions, the fires produced
a haze that grounded flights and closed schools and offices
across Southeast Asia, forcing millions of people to breathe
toxic air for months on end. The World Bank calculated
the cost of the disaster at US$16bn,36 while researchers at
Harvard and Columbia Universities estimate that 100,000

people died prematurely from respiratory diseases linked to
the haze.37 Such crises can be expected to recur, particularly
in dry El Niño years, when fires spread more rapidly through
drained peatland and the debris of recent deforestation and
into surrounding still-forested areas.

Palm oil lobbyists talk up the sector’s contributions

to Indonesia’s economy and present it as a lifeline to
smallholder farmers. In reality, the economic benefits of the
palm oil boom have fallen on the handful of already wealthy
individuals that control the big plantation companies.38 By
contrast, many of the costs have been borne by workers
and communities. Social conflicts between local people and
plantation companies – including many owned by major
traders – are widespread, brutal and unresolved.39 Non-
governmental organisations (NGOs) and unions report that
even plantations that have been certified as ‘sustainable’
often show signs of child labour and forced labour.40
Workers in the palm oil industry are routinely exposed to
hazardous pesticides, paid below the minimum wage and
deterred from forming unions to seek redress41 – a far
cry from the pictures of smiling plantation workers that
dominate brands’ sustainability reports.

On the first day of the Cancun Climate Summit in 2010,
the CGF acknowledged that deforestation for agricultural
commodities is a major contributor to the global climate
crisis, and made an an unequivocal commitment to eliminate
rainforest destruction from palm oil and other high-risk
commodity supply chains by no later than 2020.49 In
September 2014, governments, traders, NGOs and brands
signed the New York Declaration on Forests, thereby pledging
their support for the goal of eliminating deforestation from
the production of agricultural commodities such as palm oil by
2020.50 By the end of 2016, 447 companies, including both
brands and traders, had made public commitments to address
deforestation in their supply chains.51 Some companies have
enshrined these commitments into commodity-specific NDPE
policies that also have explicit 2020 deadlines.

2020 is now less than two years away. Yet much of the
palm oil that brands (including those that have made such
commitments) use in their products still comes from producers
that are destroying rainforests.

Part of the reason for this is that brands have outsourced
much of the responsibility for implementing their NDPE policies
to their suppliers, including global commodities traders such
as Wilmar International, Cargill, Golden Agri-Resources (GAR)
and IOI. Brands and NGOs told traders to adopt NDPE policies
of their own and to screen their supply chains for destructive
or exploitative palm oil producers. However, many brands
have subsequently chosen to measure progress in terms of the
percentage of their suppliers with NDPE policies, rather than in
terms of successful implementation of those policies.

There is the world of difference between having a policy
and implementing it. A more meaningful metric would report
the share of palm oil supply that comes from producers whose
operations have been verified as compliant with NDPE policies.
In 2017, Greenpeace assessed the actions palm oil traders

were taking to ensure that they were not buying from
producers that were destroying rainforests, draining peatlands
or exploiting workers and local communities.52 Although
most traders had published NDPE policies, there were serious
problems with their implementation: inconsistent standards,
questionable enforcement and non-existent deadlines. Not
only was the palm oil industry not working to the 2020
deadline set by brands, it did not even have a common timeline
for delivering a palm oil supply free from deforestation and
other social and environmental harms.

10

None of the traders that supply the world’s biggest brands

with palm oil had any way to keep destructive growers out
of their supply chains. They lacked adequate data and the
monitoring systems needed to ensure that producers are not
clearing forests or draining peatlands. Specifically, none of the
traders required their suppliers to provide them with concession
maps. Without these maps, it is almost impossible for traders
to carry out the geospatial monitoring needed to determine
which producers have stopped clearing rainforests across their
operations and which have not.

Instead, most traders admitted focusing on geospatial mill

analysis, designed to detect deforestation near mills from
which they source. This approach, which is promoted by
implementation partners such as The Forest Trust (TFT) and
ProForest, pays insufficient attention to the frontiers where the
industry is expanding most rapidly. Producer groups frequently
supply the market with palm oil from established concessions
while simultaneously destroying rainforests to develop new oil
palm plantations in frontier regions, such as Indonesian Papua
and Papua New Guinea, that are far from their established
operations. For monitoring to be comprehensive, companies
need to be monitoring their suppliers at ‘group level’ – i.e.
monitoring the operations of all producers within the parent
groups to which each of their suppliers belong, including in
concessions that are not yet productive.

None of the traders assessed had a robust system to monitor

all the producer groups in its supply chain at group level. Nor
could they demonstrate a systematic approach to enforcing
their policies. Indeed, traders regularly claimed to be unaware
that the producers supplying them were responsible for forest
destruction until NGOs brought it to their attention, and they
then treated each breach as an isolated incident, with remedial
measures decided on a case-by-case basis.

Most traders publish so-called ‘grievance lists’ that detail

breaches of their NDPE policies by suppliers. But these are
incomplete, generally listing only cases identified through third-
party sources such as NGO reports, RSPO complaints or media
articles, and omitting cases identified through traders’ own
monitoring programmes. Moreover, in most cases traders appear
to have engaged with the producers concerned for months or
even years with little evidence of reform. Exclusion remains a
tool of last resort. Supply chain data published by the traders
themselves indicates that they have continued to trade palm oil
from producers they know are destructive or exploitative.53

2018 the US-based commodities trader Bunge completed the purchase of a majority stake in Loders Croklaan, which has been
merged with its own palm oil division to become a new corporate entity, Bunge Loders Croklaan. Greenpeace has not yet assessed
Bunge Loders Croklaan’s NDPE commitment or its implementation.

CONFRONTING
THE BRANDS
WITH
EVIDENCE

Throughout 2017, Greenpeace presented some of
the world’s leading brands with a series of bulletins
containing evidence of seven cases of producers
violating traders’ and brands’ NDPE policies.

Brands – and the traders that supply them – should

have identified these producers through their own
supply chain monitoring and taken steps to reform or
exclude them. In each instance, most of the evidence
we relied upon was already in the public domain: sources
included NGO reports, complaints to the RSPO and
international media articles. However, supply chain data
from traders showed that palm oil from all but one of
these destructive producers entered the global market
in 2017 (the sole exception being POSCO Daewoo,
whose plantations were not yet producing palm oil,
although trade may now have started). Further, the lists
of top suppliers disclosed by some brands indicated that
there was wide market exposure to these problematic
producers. Accordingly, Greenpeace asked each brand
to confirm whether these producers were in its supply
chain and to specify the corrective actions it had taken
concerning them.

Some brands refused to respond to our inquiry.
However, every one of the brands that did respond
confirmed receiving palm oil produced by one or more
of the destructive producers. Taken together with the
findings of other NGOs,54 which have also identified
numerous producer groups involved in deforestation in
brands’ supply chains, this suggests a systemic failure by
brands and their suppliers to enforce their NDPE policies.

After Greenpeace had presented them with the

evidence of the destruction caused by the seven
producers in question, some brands did exclude one or
more of them from their supply chains. But laudable as
this response was, brands should not be reliant on NGOs
to raise cases with them. Instead, they need their own
systems to detect and exclude destructive producers
from their palm oil supply chains.

Three of these producers – FELDA/FGV, Salim
Group and Samling Group/Glenealy Plantations – are
considered in detail below. The other producers –
Goodhope, Korindo, Noble and POSCO Daewoo – are
involved in comparable environmental and human
rights abuses.55

MAPPING ANALYSIS
FOR GREENPEACE OF
DEFORESTATION IN PT
TAA, 2015–2017.

DEFORESTATION AND
PEATLAND CLEARANCE

In April 2016, consultancy Aidenvironment published analysis
indicating that FGV had cleared peatlands in two concessions in
West Kalimantan, Indonesia: PT Citra Niaga Perkasa (PT CNP)
and PT Temila Agro Abadi (PT TAA).62 Four months later, FGV
published a sustainability policy pledging ‘no conversion of
HCV [high conservation value] areas, peat soil, and/ or areas
with High Carbon Stock (HCS)’.63 However, analysis of MoEF
official landcover maps and satellite imagery indicates that
FGV continued to clear forest and develop peatland in PT TAA
until at least June 2017, despite its new policy. Regardless
of the visual evidence, the company denied that this was
deforestation, citing an unpublished independent assessment
which it said had found ‘no deforestation of natural forest’
because the ‘natural forest has been completely destroyed
by massive forest fires in the 1980’s and in 1997, and also by
continuous logging operations by logging companies and by the
local communities’.64

In January 2018 FGV published an action plan for restoring

the cleared peatland, but it is not clear whether this involves
restoration to forest or merely reversing drainage.65 At the
same time, consultants Chain Reaction Research reported that
development without HCV or HCS assessment had been going
on in an FGV concession in Sarawak, Malaysia, since September
2017. FGV applied a stop work order after it was challenged over
the development, offering further evidence that the company’s
sustainability policy exists only on paper unless it is forced to
comply by other organisations.66

EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS AND
WITHDRAWAL OF RSPO CERTIFICATION

In July 2015, the Wall Street Journal published an in-depth

investigation into FGV concessions in Malaysia, reporting
workers’ claims that they were not paid for long periods,
had their passports confiscated and were using hazardous
chemicals without being given appropriate protective
equipment.67 Following an RSPO investigation, FGV
voluntarily surrendered certification for all 58 of its RSPO-
certified mills in May 2016.68 At the time of writing it has
regained eight of these certificates.69

LINKS TO GLOBAL TRADE

FGV has a joint venture with P&G, FPG Oleochemicals,70
and is P&G’s top supplier of palm products.71

Between January 2016 and December 2017 (the most

recently available trade data for all traders that provide
such data), traders that received palm or palm kernel oil
from FGV’s mills included Archer Daniels Midland (ADM),
Bunge, Cargill, Fuji Oils, IOI, Keck Seng, Mewah, Musim
Mas, Olam, Sime Darby and Wilmar.72 These traders all
supply major brands. It is likely that other traders that do
not have transparent mill-level traceability data on their
dashboards (see footnote) were supplied with FGV oil
during this period as well.

Traders listed above whose grievance lists mention

FELDA/FGV include Cargill73 (with four separate
grievances since December 2015), IOI,74 Musim Mas75
and Olam.76 Wilmar does not include FELDA/FGV in its
grievance list,77 and ADM, Bunge, Fuji Oils, Keck Seng,
Mewah and Sime Darby do not appear to have publicly
available grievance lists. In addition to these, Apical’s
grievance list includes two grievances against FELDA/FGV,
in October 2015 and July 2017, with the current status
given as ‘monitoring’; it is not clear if the absence of FGV
oil in Apical’s traceability summaries represents
a suspension of trade.78

conglomerate Indofood, which includes agribusiness group
IndoAgri and IndoAgri’s palm oil subsidiaries PT Salim
Ivomas Pratama (PT SIMP) and PT PP London Sumatra (PT
Lonsum – itself a subsidiary of PT SIMP).79 PT SIMP holds
a landbank of over 360,000ha80 and the Salim Group also
holds extensive palm oil concessions via other companies,81
making it one of Indonesia’s largest plantation groups.
While PT SIMP and PT Lonsum are RSPO members, other
Salim Group palm oil companies are not, putting the Salim
Group in breach of RSPO rules requiring membership at

DEFORESTATION

In February 2013, the Centre for Orangutan Protection filed
an RSPO complaint against PT SIMP alleging destruction
of orangutan habitat in the PT Gunta Samba Jaya (PT GSJ)
concession in East Kalimantan.83 Indofood denied owning any
share in PT GSJ, but more recent investigations by Greenpeace
have shown clear links between PT GSJ and the Salim Group.84
Another Salim Group concession, in West Kalimantan, has
been shown to have cleared around 1,900ha of forest, mostly
on peatland, between July 2015 and October 2017.85 The
Salim Group also controls and has recently begun to develop
an extensive landbank in Papua, much of which is mapped as
primary forest.86

EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS
AND CHILD LABOUR

A 2015 investigation by OPPUK, Rainforest Action Network
and the International Labor Rights Forum into two PT Lonsum
plantations in North Sumatra found evidence of a range of poor
labour practices, including:
•   use of child labour
•   workers being paid below the minimum wage
•   workers using pesticides without proper safety equipment

and in violation of RSPO Principles & Criteria

•  quota systems that encouraged increased use of informal
workers (including workers bringing along their wives and
children to help them meet their quotas).87

A subsequent independent audit for the RSPO confirmed
many of the allegations.88 The complaint is still in the RSPO
process at the time of writing, with PT Lonsum’s parent company
IndoAgri repeatedly demanding more evidence but not providing
any counter-evidence or plans to address the issues.89

LINKS TO GLOBAL TRADE

Between January 2016 and December 2017 (the most recently
available trade data for all traders that provide such data),

traders that received palm or palm kernel oil from IndoAgri mills
and/or the Salim-associated PT GSJ included AAK, ADM, Apical,
Bunge, Cargill, Fuji Oils, GAR, IOI, Musim Mas, Olam, Sime Darby
and Wilmar.90 These traders all supply major consumer brands. It
is possible that other traders that do not have transparent mill-
level traceability data on their dashboards received IndoAgri/
Salim Group oil during this period as well.

As is often the case when producer groups obscure the full

extent of their empire, it is unclear how traders are handling
the Salim Group and what actions they are taking to address
its noncompliance with their NDPE policies. Specifically, where
sanctions have been applied, it is unclear whether they cover the
whole group, or whether the trader is treating the part of the
group that is publicly listed (i.e. the Indofood division) and the
concession clusters that Indofood denies being associated with as
separate entities, despite clear management overlap.91

In its grievance list update of December 2017, IOI states
that having listed a grievance against Indofood in September
2016, in the following February it informed traders that supply
it with IndoAgri oil that the company was non-compliant with
its policy.92 Regardless, Salim Group palm oil continued to enter
IOI’s supply chain from these traders as recently as September
and October 2017.93 Apical also has Indofood/Salim Group
in its grievance list and states that it has had no commercial
relationship with the group since 2015,94 despite receiving oil
from PT Lonsum at its Tanjun Balai refinery between April and
June 201795 and its Sari Dumai Sejati refinery between October
and December 2017.96 (Apical’s mill data omits PT Lonsum or
IndoAgri ownership, suggesting that the company may not be
monitoring procurement at the group level.) Cargill,97 GAR,98
Musim Mas,99 Olam100 and Wilmar101 have IndoAgri/Indofood
on their grievance lists, but updates do not indicate any trade
suspension. Of the other traders listed above as receiving palm or
palm kernel oil from IndoAgri mills and/or PT GSJ, ADM, Bunge,
Fuji Oils and Sime Darby do not appear to have publicly available
grievance lists.

PepsiCo and Nestlé have joint ventures with Indofood to
manufacture their products in Indonesia.102 PepsiCo has recently
announced that it has suspended sourcing palm oil from IndoAgri
but is maintaining its business relationship with Indofood.103

DEFORESTATION
IN KALIMANTAN

DEFORESTATION AND FIRE
IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Glenealy operates PT Tunas Borneo Plantations (PT TBP) in
North Kalimantan. A Greenpeace comparison of best available
concession information for PT TBP with official landcover maps
and satellite imagery suggests that 2,867ha of forest was
cleared within the concession between 2015 and June 2017.
Of this, 308ha was land classified as Limited Production Forest.
Palm oil development in such areas is illegal.

HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND
DEFORESTATION IN MYANMAR

Glenealy holds one concession in Papua New Guinea, the
Ome Ome project in Central Province. Greenpeace mapping
analysis suggests that between August 2015 and April 2017,
1,016ha of forest were cleared in this concession. Satellite
analysis of fire hotspot data suggests a strong correlation
between forest clearance and outbreaks of fire. Between
2014 and 2017, 74 fire hotspots were recorded in the
concession, almost all within recently deforested areas. This
suggests that the company may have used fire deliberately to
finish clearing the land before planting.

Glenealy operates Myanmar Stark Prestige Plantation (MSPP),
a plantation covering at least 5,700ha.105 According to a
report by the NGO Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA),
a large share of the concession is community land, including
farmland incorrectly classified as ‘vacant land’ by the Myanmar
government.106 The EIA report states that MSPP has ‘violated the
indigenous Karen community’s right to Free Prior and Informed
Consent (FPIC) enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on
the Rights of indigenous Peoples’, and goes on to record that
it ‘has cleared more than 6,000 acres [2,400ha], including ...
orchards villagers depend on for their livelihoods. Families who
have lost their productive land have fallen into high levels of
debt or been forced to work as day laborers for low wages ...
Furthermore, run-off from chemical fertilisers and pesticides
used by MSPP has polluted local water sources, causing livestock
to die and villagers to fall ill ... MSPP has never offered villagers
fair compensation for these impacts.’107

LINKS TO GLOBAL TRADE

Between January 2016 and December 2017 (the most recently
available trade data for all traders that provide such data),
traders that received palm or palm kernel oil from Samling’s
Glenealy mills included ADM, Bunge, Cargill, Fuji Oils, IOI, Louis
Dreyfus, Olam, Sime Darby and Wilmar.108 These traders all
supply major consumer brands. It is possible that other traders
that do not have transparent mill-level traceability data on their
dashboards received the group’s oil during this period as well;
for example, Louis Dreyfus’ receipt of Glenealy oil is only visible
through Olam’s mill list.109

Traders listed above whose grievance lists mention Samling or
Glenealy include IOI110 and Olam,111 which have engaged with the
suppliers that provided Glenealy oil, and Wilmar,112 which states
that it is currently ‘engaging’ with Samling directly. Cargill113 does
not list Samling or Glenealy in its grievance list. ADM, Bunge, Fuji
Oils, Louis Dreyfus and Sime Darby do not have publicly available
grievance lists.

Despite corporate commitments to reform a dirty
industry, palm oil remains a high-risk commodity. This
poses a considerable problem for brands that use palm oil,
including household names such as Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo
and PZ Cussons. Given that the leading suppliers to the
global market all source from destructive producers, the
onus is on brands to prove that they are not sourcing
– inadvertently or otherwise – from producers that
are harming the environment and local communities.
Accordingly, brands must begin by being transparent about
where their palm oil comes from and who produced it.
At the start of 2018, Greenpeace challenged 16
leading members of the CGF to disclose publicly the
mills that produced their palm oil, and the names of the
producer groups that controlled those mills. At the time
of going to press, eight brands – starting with Nestlé
and Unilever, and quickly followed by Colgate-Palmolive,
General Mills, Mars, Mondelēz, Procter & Gamble and
Reckitt Benckiser – had shown that they were prepared
to hold themselves accountable by disclosing this
information. As expected, the supply chain information
that these respondents published included problematic
producers who are actively clearing rainforests, but at

26

least these brands were prepared to allow independent
scrutiny of the progress they were making towards their
2020 NDPE commitments.

By contrast, other brands that Greenpeace
approached – Ferrero, Hershey, Kellogg’s, Kraft
Heinz, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, PZ Cussons and
Smucker’s – have so far refused to reveal what mills
their palm oil comes from. Instead, they continue
to hide behind commercial confidentiality and non-
disclosure agreements, signed with direct suppliers or
implementation partners such as TFT, or else to refer
to their corporate policies as a sufficient guarantee
of sustainability – all of which serves to conceal from
their customers the extent of their complicity in forest
destruction. Some brands, including Kellogg’s and
Hershey, publish lists of their direct suppliers.

As has already been made clear, none of the major
traders can yet be relied upon to supply brands with
palm oil that meets their NDPE standards; indeed, they
are all known to source from forest destroyers, including
the producers profiled in this report. It follows that by
sourcing from these traders brands are buying palm oil
contaminated by forest destruction.

...AND TAKE
CONTROL OF THEIR
SUPPLY CHAINS

Vital as it is, transparency will not lead in and of itself to a clean
palm oil supply chain. In addition to publishing details of the
palm oil mills and producer groups in their supply chains, brands
must conduct their own due diligence on those producers to
confirm compliance with their NDPE policies.

A key plank of any due diligence programme is geospatial
monitoring to identify producers that are clearing forest or
developing peatlands. This monitoring must go beyond assessing
the catchment area of the mills from which companies are
actually sourcing: brands must seek to verify policy compliance
across all concessions controlled by the producer groups in their
supply chains, including concessions from which they do not
themselves source and concessions that are not yet productive,
as well as the operations of the third-party growers who supply
those producers. What this all boils down to is that by 2020,
brands must ensure that their suppliers do not buy palm oil from
any non-compliant producers, regardless of whether that oil
currently enters the brands’ own supply chains.

Such monitoring depends on reliable data on corporate
structures and landholdings. Unfortunately, the governments
of Indonesia and Malaysia still refuse to make concession maps
publicly available, although the government of Indonesia has now
conceded that there are no legal barriers to their publication.114
The private sector must address this deficiency; traders should
obtain concession maps from the producer groups who supply
them with palm oil and make them available for all stakeholders to

review, analyse and download on an open-access platform such
as Global Forest Watch.

If brands want to have ensured by 2020 that their palm oil
supply is free from deforestation, they will need time to identify
all the rogue producers and either reform or exclude them. To
do so, they will have to have concession maps at their disposal.
The longer it takes to get a comprehensive dataset of concession
maps into the public domain, the less time brands will have to act
on the information they contain. Therefore, brands must take
responsibility for ensuring not just that traders publish concession
maps for the producers they source from, but that they do so as
quickly as possible. To ensure that traders respond to the urgency
of the situation, brands will need to stop sourcing from any trader
that fails to publish maps for all the producer groups in its supply
chain by the end of 2018.

Further, brands will need to put pressure on traders (and
other direct suppliers) to demonstrate that non-compliant
producers have been excluded from their supply chains. By
2020, a responsible brand must be able to demonstrate that
all the palm oil it uses comes from reputable producer groups
whose plantations have been verified compliant with its
NDPE policies. At the same time, brands should support the
transformation of the entire industry by sourcing only from
traders and other suppliers that can show that all the palm
oil they trade comes from producers that have been verified
compliant with NDPE standards.

COUNTDOWN
TO
2020

‘ It’s not surprising that people don’t
know where things come from. That’s
not the point of a commodity. You
just buy it. But now we’re asking the
commodity markets to change and
start to care about where things
come from, and it’s changing how
companies do business.’115

MARCO ALBANI, DIRECTOR,
TROPICAL FOREST ALLIANCE 2020

To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, world
governments signed the Paris Agreement in 2015. This aims
to limit the average global temperature increase by the end
of the present century to significantly less than 2°C above
pre-industrial levels. The commitment includes explicit
recognition of the role that forests play as sinks, stores and
sources of carbon, and thus their potential either to help
limit or to add to greenhouse gas emissions, depending on
whether they are protected or destroyed.

The most achievable, and at the same time non-

negotiable, milestone towards meeting the Paris Agreement
objective depends on concerted action by companies to
cut the link between deforestation and globally traded
commodities such as palm oil and soya by no later than
2020. To date, companies are failing. This is not just about
trees and orangutans, it is about planetary survival.

As global temperatures rise, and as populations of

endangered species dwindle, companies using palm oil can
expect to come under increasing pressure to ensure that
it does not come from growers involved in clearing forests
and peatlands. Indeed, public opinion in many major
markets is already turning against palm oil altogether.
In opinion polls worldwide, respondents consistently
rate palm oil as the most environmentally destructive
vegetable oil,116 even though other oils such as soya oil are
equally problematic.117 Calls for companies to stop using
palm oil will only get louder unless brands and traders
prove that they can reform the palm oil industry by
working together to exclude destructive producers from
the global market.

At the same time, all the conditions are in place to
make NDPE the new normal for the palm oil industry.
The overwhelming majority of Indonesian and Malaysian
palm oil passes through companies that have committed
to environmental and human rights protection: recent
analysis by Chain Reaction Research suggests that
companies with NDPE policies operate 74% of the total
refinery capacity in Indonesia and Malaysia.118 This
means that lasting and meaningful reform of the palm oil
industry is entirely possible – if only brands, traders and
producers are prepared to put the work in between now
and 2020.

There are many business reasons for brands to use palm

oil, including its high yield per hectare of plantation and
versatile properties. But their efforts to reform the industry
have failed. Palm oil companies have concluded that brands
are more concerned about maintaining a secure supply of
palm oil, even if some of it is produced unsustainably, than
about meeting their NDPE commitments. Brands need to
counter this perception by making it explicit that from 2020
onwards, they will use only palm oil that has been verified
as coming from responsible producers – even if that means
using less of it.

The most efficient way to meet this commitment would
be for all sectors involved with palm oil, including producers,
traders and consumer brands, to act together. However,
traders and other companies have shown no inclination to do
so. Accordingly, brands must lead the way and drive change
throughout the palm oil sector by taking control of and
responsibility for their own supply chains.

APPENDIX 1:
HOW COMPANIES
PERFORM ON
TRANSPARENCY

In January 2018, Greenpeace
challenged sixteen of the world’s
largest users of palm oil – all members
of the CGF – to ‘take urgent and
measurable action to finally end
deforestation for palm oil’, starting
by coming clean about the extent
of deforestation currently in their
supply chains. Specifically, we called
on them to publish a list of direct
palm oil suppliers, the palm oil mills in
their physical supply chains and the
producer groups owning those mills.

To date, eight leading global brands
have responded positively to our challenge
and published data revealing where and
from whom they ultimately buy palm oil.
Four other brands were only willing to
publish the traders supplying their palm

oil. Other brands refused to provide any
information about their palm oil supply
Many, though not all, traders now
have so-called dashboards, which also
reveal from which mills and groups they
buy. However, global traders including
Astra Agro Lestari, Hayel Saeed Anam/
Pacific Inter-link, Louis Dreyfus and Sime
Darby are not currently disclosing which
producers supply their palm oil.

Transparency and accountability –
including the publication of explicit details
about who produces the palm oil that
companies use – create the conditions for
sectoral reform. They are not an end in
themselves, but lay bare the extent of the
problem.

The quality and extent of brands’
disclosures vary dramatically: none is

32

complete, and group information and
other data are often inaccurate. In some
cases, it is unclear whether brands are
simply listing all the producers and mills
that their direct suppliers source from or
the specific subset that actually produced
the palm oil they have received.

Nonetheless, by publishing these lists,
brands are asserting that these companies
produced the palm oil they received.
As such, they are responsible for what
happens in those producers’ concessions
and other operations, including those from
which they are not sourcing.

APPENDIX 2:
LITERATURE
REVIEW

Greenpeace monitoring has identified
significant recent or continued
deforestation in the operations of major
producer groups trading to the global
market. The vast majority of these cases
have long been in the public domain
through NGO reports, RSPO complaints or
trader grievance dashboards. A review of
2016–2017 dashboards for major traders
shows the extent of market exposure to
these producer groups.
