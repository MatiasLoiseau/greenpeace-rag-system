Ray Hilborn: Overfishing Denier
A Greenpeace investigation shows that a prominent American fisheries scientist
took millions of dollars in funding from fishing industry groups without
publicly disclosing it.

fisheries worldwide. Now, documents recently obtained through the Freedom of
Information Act show that Dr. Hilborn has received more than $3 million from
commercial fishing and seafood interests. Photo via Wikimedia Commons.
Update, February 2019:
Back in 2016, Greenpeace called out a well-known scientist named Ray Hilborn
for failing to disclose the funding he’d received from the fishing industry in
several of his publications. Conflict of interest doesn’t necessarily mean
that it affects your conclusions, but studies have shown that it often does —
and that is why disclosure is important. (For similar reasons, Greenpeace does
not accept funding from governments or corporations. We value our
independence, which ensures our ability to say what needs to be said.) Some
fisheries biologists were outraged that we had the gall to point out these
conflicts, claiming that we were just doing it because we didn’t agree with
what he was saying. Meanwhile, quite a few other scientists quietly said they
really appreciated our effort. Finally, the journal PLOS ONE wrote to say
they’d posted a
correction,
noting his industry funding. As part of their investigation into our appeal,
the journal also posted a
correction
noting that several authors of a paper defending the Marine Stewardship
Council were actually employed by the MSC – and Ray Hilborn had received
funding from certifiers employed by the MSC. Small victories, perhaps, but
in an era where we need strong scientific advice more than ever, we cannot
afford to have research clouded by undisclosed conflicts of interest. While
PLOS ONE is to be commended for investigating this matter and posting
corrections accordingly, other journals have yet to follow suit.
Warming and acidifying waters. Massive bleaching of corals. Collapsing
fisheries. Pollution from oil, chemicals, plastics, and human waste. The
oceans and ocean life are in trouble, and most scientists in the field agree.
To begin to turn it around, civilization needs to look at the state of the
oceans with sober and clear eyes.
Now, a Greenpeace investigation shows that a prominent scientist — one who has
presented a rosier picture of the oceans than most of his peers — has accepted
millions in research funding and additional consultancy payments from fishing
industry groups without disclosing it to the public or the venues that publish
his work.
Dr. Ray Hilborn, a professor at University of Washington’s School of Aquatic
and Fisheries Sciences, has made a career of contradicting the science that
shows increasingly declining fish stocks across the globe. His maverick
position has earned him a unique status within ocean science.
And, unsurprisingly, it has won him many fans within industry. Dr. Hilborn’s
work has often been promoted when the industrial fishing industry has sought
to defend its worst practices, including bottom trawling. And as someone often
cited in industry-funded public relations efforts, he has become the go-to
scientist for contrarian opinions on fishing impacts.
Dr. Hilborn’s extensive catalog of publications has propelled him to wide
recognition. They also seem to have insulated him from criticism. The results
of Greenpeace’s recent Public Records Act
requests to Hilborn’s employer the University of Washington will
undoubtedly force the science community to reassess the latitude they have
shown the professor for years. Records show that Dr. Hilborn has taken more
than $3.5 million in corporate funding for research. He has also received an
untold sum from a long career as a consultant to industry.
And while some of his peers suspected, few if any of them knew for sure.
While inquiries into Dr. Hilborn’s conduct are still ongoing, a number of
ethical concerns have been brought to light. Dr. Hilborn’s failure to disclose
funding sources violates the policies of many of the journals in which he has
published — the journals that have effectively made his career. Failure to
disclose that funding is also a violation of the ethical standards of academic
science, as it creates an inaccurate perception among scientific peers and the
public that Dr. Hilborn’s research has no potential financial bias.
Documents show that between 2003 and 2015, Dr. Hilborn received $3.56 million
from 69 distinct fishing or seafood companies and corporate interests,
including Trident, the South African Deep Sea
Trawling Association, and the International Seafood Sustainability
Foundation, which, despite its name, is the trade
association for the industrial tuna fleet. Documents also show that in the
same period, Dr. Hilborn received payments as a consultant from a number of
industry groups, including FishAmerica
Foundation, the New Zealand Seafood Industry
Council, At-Sea Processors
Association, the BC Underwater Harvesters
Association, and
ExxonMobil.
Dive deeper into the documents detailing Dr. Hilborn’s connections to the
fishing industry:
Dr. Hilborn has earned a reputation — and a lot of money — as a critic of the
widely held views that unsustainable fishing is harming our ecosystems. He has
also been a vocal critic of efforts to strengthen regulations.
By presenting himself as a
scientist
without conflicts of interest, rather than a well-paid advocate for the
fishing industry, he has hindered effective policy discussions and delayed
urgently needed reforms. Among some of the most egregious public examples
include:


In a 2014 op-ed in the New York Times titled “Let Us Eat Fish,” Hilborn called scientific data on overfishing “exaggerated.” The piece advocates for revisions to the Magnuson-Stevens Act, an effective piece of legislation that has helped rebuild American fish stocks from New England to California. Dr. Hilborn calls for turning over a greater share of management to fisheries councils, which are overwhelmingly populated by representatives of industry. Dr. Hilborn’s byline states that he is a professor at University of Washington but makes no mention of his ties to industry.


In 2010, Dr. Hilborn co-wrote correspondence in the esteemed journal Nature, in which he advocated for the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). In 2012, he co-authored a paper in the highly-regarded PLOS One saying that the MSC “accurately identifies healthy fish stocks and conveys reliable information on stock status to seafood consumers.” In previous years, Dr. Hilborn received outside income from TAVEL Certification Inc. and Scientific Certification Systems, both certification companies employed by the MSC. In neither cases were his ties to MSC-related companies revealed, clear violations of both journals’ policies — and the standards of academic science.


A 2013 piece in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science ( PNAS ) makes the case that dams are not a cause of Chinook salmon decline in the Columbia River. Dr. Hilborn disclosed no conflict of interest, despite having received income as a consultant for the San Luis Delta Mendota Water District, a powerful water agency representing agribusiness downstream of the Columbia that benefited from those very dams. Again, neither Dr. Hilborn nor the article disclosed this conflict of interest.


Dr. Hilborn has repeatedly been a detractor of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and the widely held belief that global overfishing is devastating fish populations worldwide. In articles in PNAS and Science on the respective issues, Dr. Hilborn does not disclose any conflict of interest. However, Dr. Hilborn received income as a contractor from private industry groups to “evaluate alternative designs for marine protected areas,” and has, as mentioned, been the recipient of much funding from fishing industry groups. In the case of the article in Science, extensive acknowledgments of foundation and public funding were made, yet there was no mention of Dr. Hilborn’s industry ties.

There are many more examples of failures to disclose conflicts that we know
about, and our researchers are continuing to investigate. Additionally, Dr.
Hilborn’s violations may extend past his own science to compromise his
extensive work as a reviewer and editor for scientific journals. As gatekeeper
of knowledge and scientific understanding, we believe conflicts of interest
such as the ones documented should be automatic grounds for disqualification.
Dr. Hilborn served as a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors for Science
for nearly eight years. He was also associate editor of the Canadian Journal
of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences from 2002-2013. He is currently a Guest
Editor at PNAS, and on the Editorial Boards of the journals Fish and
Fisheries and Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries.
Greenpeace expects further revelations in the weeks to come.
In the meantime, we are filing letters with each of the journals for which we
have evidence of Dr. Hilborn’s failure to disclose conflicts of interest. We
are also pushing the University of Washington to conduct its own investigation
of Dr. Hilborn.
In the grand tradition of harmful industries buying science to support their
destructive practices — from tobacco to the fossil fuel industry — Dr. Hilborn
and the fishing industry have peddled in doubt for too long. It is time for
them to be stopped and real science to prevail.
