20 argum ents in Defendants’ Motion for Sum mary Judgm ent and Reply Mem orandum , including  
Defendants’ standing and f inality argum ents.  
I. Defendants’ New  Affidavits are Not Material to this Court Inquiry and 
Should be Struck as Extra-Record Evidence Offering a Post-Hoc  
Rationale. 
 
In response to Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Defendants now rely on three new affidavits in a 
last-m inute effort to contest Plaintiffs’ standing.  See Declaration of Thomas Schehl (Att. A to 
Def. Reply); Declaration of James Mahoney  (Att. B to Def. Reply); Declaration of Dr. David 
Legates  (Att. C to Def. Reply).  These m ost recent affidavits are im material to the Court’s 
inquiry at this stage of litigation and are inte rposed as a back-door m ethod of providing a new 
agency rationale separate from , and in conflict with, the agencies’ own determ inations on the 
Record.  They should be struck. 
 
Plts’ Mot. to Strike 
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  2Both the Suprem e Court and the Ninth Circuit have m ade clear that, for purposes of 
summary judgm ent, facts averred by the Plaintiff with  respect to standing m ust be taken as true.  
Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (in response to a sum mary judgm ent 
motion challenging a plaintiff’s standing to bri ng suit the plaintiff need only “set forth by 
affidavit or other evidence ‘specific facts’ . . . which for purposes of the sum mary judgm ent 
motion will be taken to be true.”); Alaska Wildlife Alliance v. Jensen , 108 F.3d 1065, 1068-69 
(9th Cir. 1997) (“At the sum mary judgm ent stage, factual allegations in support of standing are 
taken as true.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  Plaintiffs need only plead facts that, taken as true, would 
show that [governm ent authorized activity] caused their injuries.”).  Plaintiffs in this case have 
set forth specific facts relevant to their standing, see Pls.’ Exhs. 1-16, and for the purposes of 
Defendants’ m otion for sum mary judgm ent, these facts m ust be taken to be true.  Lujan21

27 U.S. at 561.  Defendants’ m ost recent declarations  contesting facts averred by Plaintiffs thus are 
not m aterial to the Court’s consideration of the Defendants’ m otion for Sum mary Judgm ent.  
Furtherm ore, Defendants’ new affidavits are nothing m ore than an attem pt to provide a 
new rationale f or the agencies’ f ailure to com ply with NEPA.  Judicial review of an agency 
decision is lim ited to the adm inistrative record in existence at the tim e of the decision and does 
not include any part of  the record that is  made initially in the reviewing court.  Camp v. Pitts , 411 
U.S. 138, 142 (1973).  Extra-record evidence m ay only be considered under lim ited 
circum stances – none of which are claim ed by the Defendants.  See Southwest Ctr. for Biological 
Diversity v. United States Forest Serv. , 100 F.3d 1443, 1450 (9th Cir. 1996).  Thus, the agency 
may not advance new rationalization for sustaining its action.  Id. 
we em phasize[ ] a sim ple but fundam ental rule of adm inistrative law.  That 
rule is to the effect that a reviewing court, in dealing with a determ ination or 
judgm ent which an adm inistrative agency alone is authorized to m ake, m ust 
judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the 
agency.  If those grounds are inadequate or im proper, the court is powerless 
to affirm the adm inistrative action by substituting what it considers to be a 
more adequate or proper basis.  To do so would propel the court into the 
domain which Congress has set aside exclusively for the adm inistrative 
agency.

Plts’ Mot. to Strike 
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  3The Records here fully support Plaintiffs’ claim s: the agencies concluded that increased 
greenhouse gas em issions were a reasonably foreseeable im pact of their actions; they concluded 
that anthropom orphic greenhouse gas em issions c ould contribute to global warm ing; and they 
concluded that global warm ing could result in a series of significant im pacts, including those 
now alleged by the Plaintiffs.  See generally Ex-Im Bank’s Role in Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
and Climate Change  and OPIC’s Climate Change: Assessing Our Actions .  The agencies’ only 

rationale for not conducting any NEPA analysis was that their contribution to global warm ing 
was insignificant.  Id.   1

                                           Dr. Legates’ affidavit is extra-record evidence that offers a post-hoc  rationale that is 
inconsistent with the agencies’ conclusions in the Adm inistrative Record, and it m ust be struck.  
Chenery , 332 U.S. at 196.  Defendants have affirm atively argued to this Court that the current 
matter is a “record review” case, and likewise have affirm atively argued that expert testim ony 
outside the record is inappropriate.1  Yet now, when forced to confront their own Record 
conclusions that increased GHG em issions are a reasonably foreseeable im pact of their actions, 
that such em issions contribute to global clim ate change, and that clim ate change m ay result in 
the type of  impacts alleged by Plaintif fs, Def endants are scram bling to substitute their record 
with expert testim ony that actually contradicts their own conclusions. 2  Defendants m ay not 
 
1 Attorney Navaro stated at hearing on the Governm ent’s Motion for Change in Venue 
that:  
[b]oth the Expert/Im port (sic) Bank and the Overseas Private Investm ent 
Corporation considered CO2 em issions fr om relevant projects, and, in fact, 
both have looked at clim ate change im plications, and both have determ ined 
that their contribution, or the arguable contribution of projects in which they 
are involved, of CO2 has a negligible im pact on clim ate and therefore would 
have no Dom estic Im pact.  So there is an administrative record that contains 
all that consideration and that would be the evidence and there would be no 
need in this situation for experts.

Plts’ Mot. to Strike 
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  42 For exam ple, while Dr. Legates now suggests that the role of anthropom orphic carbon 
emissions contribution to clim ate change is “uncertain,” the agencies, in fact, expressed a 
different opinion.  See, e.g. , OPIC’s Assessing our Actions Report at 7  (“there is a strong and 
growing scientific consensus that these steady additions of GHGs have tipped a delicate balance 
and begun to im pact our clim ate and m ay be the dom inant force driving recent warm ing 
trends.”); id. at 49 (“Clim ate change represents a serious global environm ental challenge.  Since 
the dawn of the industrial age, m an has been em itting increasing quantities of heat-absorbing 
GHGs prim arily through the com bustion of fossil fuels.  As a result, atm ospheric concentrations 
of CO 2 – the m ost im portant GHG – are now at their highest levels in m ore than 160,000 years 

withhold their determ inations on the Record from  this Court, and substitute those determ inations 
with a new rationale.1

Defendants also rely on two affidavits from  agency personnel purporting to offer an 
alternative m ethod of accounting for greenhouse ga s (GHG) em issions from  projects financed, 
insured, or otherwise financially supported by Ex-Im  and OPIC.  See Declaration of Thomas 
Schehl (Att. A to Def. Reply); Declaration of James Mahoney  (Att. B to Def. Reply).  As with 
 
and global tem peratures are rising.  W ith em issions of CO 2 and other GHGs expected to increase 
– especially in developing regions – current forecasts suggest that atm ospheric concentrations of 
CO 2 could double by 2060 with a resulting global average tem perature increase of as m uch as 2º 
to 6.5º F over the next century.  Such rapid tem perature increase could have potentially grave 
econom ic and environm ental im pacts.”); see also , Ex-Im  Banks’ Our Role in Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions and Climate Change Report  at 3 (“available data would suggest that the increase in 
GHG, caused predom inately by the anthroprogenic em issions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane 
(CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), has begun to trap additional heat 
within the atm osphere, due to the associated altering of the energy balance of the atm osphere.”); 
id. at 4 (“the inform ation presented … leads one to conclude that GHG concentrations have 
indeed risen and that there is a reasonable likelihood that the increased concentrations of these 
gases will result in increased average global tem peratures during the com ing decades.”). 
 
 
Plts’ Mot. to Strike 
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  53 The Governm ent suggests that the Court need not consider the Record in its inquiry into 
Plaintiffs’ standing.  Def. Opp’n to Pls’ Mot. to  Strike at 2, 6-7.  Case law, however, does not 
support this position.  As explained further in Plaintiffs’ Reply to Defendant’s Opp’n to 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike, courts quite clearly begin an analysis of standing with the Record 
produced by the agency.  See Seattle Audubon Soc'y v. Espy , 998 F.2d 699, 703 (9th Cir. 1993) 
(“In short, our review of the record  supports the district court's conclusion that [plaintiff] has 
standing to challenge the Forest Service' s action.”) (em phasis added); Sierra Club v. EPA , 352 
U.S. App. D.C. 191 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (noting that a court’s assessm ent of standing is “based upon 
the application of [the plaintiff’s] legal theory  to facts established by evidence in the record. 
Consistent with Defenders of Wildlife , therefore, t he [plaintiff] must  either identify in that record 
evidence sufficient to support its standing to seek review or, if there is none because standing 
was not an issue before the agency, subm it additional evidence…”); s ee also Sierra Club v. 
Patterson , 185 F.3d 349, 365-366 (5th Cir. 1999) (finding that where no agency record actually 
existed , district court’s decision to develop a factua l record to consider standing issues was not 
an abuse of discretion), rev’d & vacated on other grounds en banc , 228 F.3d 589 (5th Cir. 1999).  
Here, Defendants affirm atively argue that each agency has a Record em bodying each agency’s 
consideration of clim ate change.  See Transcript of Proceedings at 27-28, 30 (April 4, 2003) 
(Att.A).  The standing inquiry, therefore, m ust begin with that Record – and the Court should 
strike Defendants’ extra-record evidence because  Defendants have not filed the Adm inistrative 
Record or even attem pted to dem onstrate that it needs to be supplem ented.   

Dr. Legates’ declaration, both Mr. Schehl’s a nd Mr. Mahoney’s declarations should be struck. 
The agencies’ Records docum ent their analysis of direct greenhouse gas em issions – an analysis 
that m ore than adequately supports Plaintiffs’ reasonable concerns over each agencies’ 
contribution to clim ate change, even without an  accounting of indirect im pacts as required by 
NEPA.  See Central Delta Water Agency v. United States , 306 F.3d 938, 947-48 (9th Cir. 2002) 
(concluding that plaintiffs successfully alleged a cred ible threat of future injury based, in part, on 
the fact that the governm ent’s own studies conf irmed plaintiff’s allegations); 40 C.F.R. § 1508.8 
(requiring consideration of indirect e ffects such as downstream  GHG em issions);  see also  Border 
Power Plant Working Group v. DOE , 260 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1015 (S.D. Cal. 2003) (evaluation of 
proposed power line on U.S./Mexico border violated NEPA because, am ong other things, the 
Departm ent of Energy failed to consider the indirect greenhouse gas em issions of a 500 MW  
gas-turbine power plant located in Mexico that would be connected to the power line).  To the 
extent that the m ethodology and results offered by the Schehl and Mahoney declarations differ 
from  each agency’s determ ination in their respective Adm inistrative Records, they m ust be 
struck.  Defendants cannot use standing to ignore their Adm inistrative Records and offer a post-
hoc rationale.1

II. Defendants’ Standing and Finality Arguments Should be Struck Because 
They Refuse to File the Record and Now  Argue That the Record Provided 
to the Plaintiffs May Not Be Appropriate.

should be also be struck, or in the alternativ e, Defendants should be estopped from  making such

Pls’ Mot. to Strike at 2 & 6, n. 2 &7.  Sim ply put, the Defendant agencies cannot characterize 
their actions as not contributing to clim ate cha nge or not final, but refuse to provide the 
administrative record – the basic evidence on which such argum ents m ust be founded.  As 
explained above and in Plaintiffs’ Surreply, the Adm inistrative Record is the starting point of 
such inquiries.   
“Where justice and fair play require it, estoppel will be applied against the governm ent.”  
Watkins v. United States Army , 875 F.2d 699, 706-707 (9th Cir. 1989) (quotations and citations 
omitted).  Estoppel is appropriate when: (1) the party to be estopped knows the facts; (2) the 
party intends that his or her conduct will be acted on; (3) the claim ant must be ignorant of the 
true facts; (4) and the claim ant must detrim entally rely on the other party' s conduct.  Id.; 
Salgado-Diaz v. Gonzales , 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 4015 (9th Cir. 2005).  Two additional 
elem ents m ust be m et to estop governm ent.  First, “affirm ative m isconduct going beyond m ere 
negligence” m ust be established.  Watkins , 875 F.2d at 707.  Second, the governm ent's wrongful 
act will cause a serious injustice, and the public' s interest will not suffer undue dam age.  Id.   
First addressing estoppel against governm ent, there is no dispute that Defendants are 
purposefully withholding the Adm inistrative Record despite the fact that Local Rules require its 
filing.  Letter from Ann D. Navaro, Esq. to Ronald A. Shems  (Decem ber 30, 2004) (Att. B); Civil 
L.R. 16-5 (“In actions for District Court review  on an adm inistrative record, the defendant m ust 
serve and file an answer, together with a certified copy of the transcript of the administrative 
 
 
Plts’ Mot. to Strike 
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  75 In particular, Plaintiffs m ove to strike  page 8, line 4 though page 23, line 17 and page

also m ove to strike page 2, line 3 though page 10, line 17, and page 11, line 1 though page 20,

And only after Defendants’ realization that the Adm inistrative Record am ply supports Plaintiffs’ 
claim s (and nearly two years after  its April 29, 2003, transm ission to Plaintiffs), did Defendants 
assert that it m ay be inadequate.  Def . Opp’n to Pls’ Mot. to Strike at 2 & 6, n. 2 & 7.  Until this 
point, Defendants strenuously asserted that  the Defendant agencies had developed 
comprehensive adm inistrative records.  See Transcript of Proceedings at 27-28, 30.  
Plaintif fs will suf fer injustice if  Defendants’ post-hoc  rationale is considered in lieu of  the 
record.  See Chenery , 332 U.S. at 196 ( post-hoc  rationale m ay not be used to support agency 
decision).  Any finality determ ination necessarily starts with the record.  Northcoast Env. Ctr v. 
Glickman , 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22845 (N.D. Ca. 1996) (“It is not necessary to go beyond the 
administrative record subm itted by def endants to determ ine whether the POC Program  
constitutes final agency action.”) aff’d  Northcoast Envtl. Ctr. v. Glickman, 136 F.3d 660, 665 
(9th Cir. 1998) (District Court properly struck ex tra-record evidence and determ ined finality only 
on adm inistrative record); Northwest Resource Inf. Ctr. v. P.U.D. No. 2 , 25 F.3d 872, 874-75 
(9th Cir. 1994) (“Only where what petitioner challenged was not a final agency action based 
upon an administrative record  have we found against jurisdiction in this court.”) (em phasis 
added).  The public interest is also served by following established norm s for public-interest 
litigation.  
 
Plts’ Mot. to Strike 
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  8The traditional elem ents of estoppel are also m et.  First, the Defendants know the facts.  
They hold the record and adm it that they are responsible for its certification.  Def. Opp’n to Pls’ 
Mot. to Strike at 2, n.2.  Second, Defendants intended their conduct to be acted on.  They 
produced an adm inistrative record and affirm atively stated that it would be adequate to guide this 
matter.  Transcript of Proceedings at 28 (“but given what I expect the contents of the record will

13 be that Mr. Shem s will have in just a couple of weeks, I don’t expect that [extra-record evidence] 
would be necessary.”).  Indeed, it is entirely expected that NEPA litigants rely on an 
administrative record.  Third, only Defendants know why the Record they produced m ay be 
inadequate.  Plaintiffs have not objected to it.   
Fourth, Plaintiffs rely extensively of the Adm inistrative Record.  Indeed, the Record 
memorializes Defendants’ assessm ent (or lack thereof) of their contributions to clim ate change.  
Likewise, Defendants concede that any determ ination of final agency action is dependent on “the 
character of the underlying action.”  Def. Reply at 12.  The Adm inistrative Record em bodies the 
underlying action.  Reliance on the Record would be  detrim ental to Plaintiffs if Defendants 
withhold the Record and Defendants’ post-hoc  rationale is instead considered by the Court.
