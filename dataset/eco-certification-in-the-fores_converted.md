Eco-certification is not
just about ‘how to log’
it’s also about ‘where
to log’. Greenpeace
believes that intact

should remain intact.

Eco-Certification in the Forest Industry:
A revolution in the marketplace

What eco-certification means
Increasingly, customers of wood products around the
world are asking for guarantees that the products they
buy — whether they are kitchen tables, paper products,
or 2 x 4s — come from forests which are managed and
logged according to ecologically-responsible standards.
This trend towards responsible consumerism is backed
up by independent certification and labeling, in order
to ensure the credibility of claims in the marketplace.

Certification is a process by which an independent
audit is conducted of a forestry business to assess
whether it meets internationally recognized guidelines
of responsible forest management that protect the
ecological integrity of the forest and respect the rights
of workers, local communities and indigenous peoples.
Companies passing the certification assessment are
eligible to have their products sold with an eco-logo
which tells customers that the product they are buying
comes from a well-managed forest.

Why eco-certification is needed
According to the World Resources Institute, 80 per cent
of the world’s ancient forests are already gone or are
severely degraded. Of what remains, logging, much of it
for international markets, has been identified as the
biggest single threat. If destruction of forests continues,
scientists warn we will create a species extinction crisis
the likes of which have not been seen since the disap-
pearance of the dinosaurs. Forests contain two-thirds of
all the world’s species. Increasingly, consumers want to be
certain that their timber, paper imports and purchases do
not contribute to ancient forest destruction nor the
extinction of species.

Who’s demanding it?
Environmental concern and awareness about logging
practices and forests burgeoned in the late ‘80s and
consumers began pressuring retail chains to provide
them with assurances that the wood they were purchas-
ing did not contribute to forest destruction, not only in

groups of buyers supporting the FSC system have now
been established in the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria,
Switzerland, Germany, Brazil and Japan.

Who’s doing it?
A number of forms of certification exist. Some assess
companies’ internal management systems, but tell little
about the environmental performance of the company.
These have low credibility in the marketplace with
environmentally concerned consumers. The forestry
certification system that has gained the most credibility
in the international marketplace, the Forest Stewardship
Council, assesses the environmental performance of
the company, in the forest, against the FSC’s global
performance standards.

The FSC is the only international forestry certification
and labeling system that does this, the principal reason
for its success to date. The FSC’s internationally recog-
nized guidelines for responsible forest use were devel-
oped through the co-operative efforts of professional
foresters, forestry companies, major consumers and
retailers, environmental and social organisations, indige-
nous peoples, community forestry groups and certifiers.

With such a broad-based range of stakeholders whose
values and concerns were given equal weight in develop-
ing the FSC standards, international consumers of wood
products have increasingly been requesting that the wood
products they buy come with an FSC stamp of approval.

INTERNATIONAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE FSC
are based in Mexico, and national and regional FSC offices
exist in countries around the world, including Canada. The
FSC approach is based on 10 Principles and Criteria for
forest management that have been developed and agreed to
by the international membership.

The FSC is appropriately taking a precautionary
approach towards certifying logging in ancient forests,
given that so much of the world’s ancient forests are
already gone. FSC’s standing policy states only small-
scale logging of ancient forests should be considered for
FSC certification. Large-scale intensive logging opera-
tions in ancient forests, such as clearcutting, cannot
presently be certified under the FSC. To do so would
require that the FSC change its fundamental principles
and criteria. To date, the FSC has certified over

the tropics, but in temperate and boreal regions as well.
The need for a credible, verifiable, independent forestry
certification and labeling system soon became apparent
when increasing numbers of suppliers began placing
unsubstantiated and un-verified claims about “sustain-
ability” on their wood and paper products as a market-
ing tool. As no independent international forestry
certification and labeling system existed to turn to, the
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was created to fill the
institutional gap.

The first Buyers Group in the world was formed in the
UK. The Buyers Group consisted of retailers who were all
being asked for these eco-guarantees by their customers.
In 1994 they banded together and committed to preferen-
tially buy wood products that had been certified by the
FSC. Today in the United Kingdom, the Buyers Group
consists of approximately 80 companies with annual sales
of wood products totaling almost $6-billion Canadian.

In November 1997, the Certified Forest Products Council
was launched in the United States, representing 140 cor-
porate members, including the Turner Corporation, the
nation’s leading general builder, and Habitat for
Humanity, one of the largest US home builders. Other

10 million hectares worldwide in tropical, temperate
and boreal forest regions. None of the forests in the FSC
portfolio involve clearcutting in ancient forests.

FSC accredited certifiers set relevant standards using
FSC approved procedures. Once regional standards have
been developed and approved by the FSC, certifiers use
those. An FSC working group has been set up in Canada
with regional sub-groups, including one in British
Columbia. The Silva Forest Foundation, a British
Columbian organization, is active in certification and
ecological forestry and is a member of the FSC.

It’s important that certification be conducted by a body
that is objective and independent in order to avoid con-
flicts of interest in the outcome. For this reason, the
most reliable and credible forms of certification are con-
ducted by certifiers not directly connected to the logging
industry, or to government bodies that may derive
income from the logging. This is the approach followed
by the FSC.

Another system has been developed by the Canadian
Standards Association (CSA), through funding supplied
by a coalition of forest company interests headed by
the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association. Unlike the
FSC model that audits and then certifies on-the-ground
logging practices, the CSA model audits the processes
by which a logging company makes its decisions con-
cerning forest management.

The FSC Challenge
For a logging company to have its operations become
FSC certified, they must meet stringent environmental
and social standards. Logging practices must more
closely mimic natural disturbances that occur in the
specific forest ecosystem.

The Forest Stewardship Council advocates that all func-
tions of a forest ecosystem remain intact after it is
logged. This requires that a mix of different tree species
of different ages still remain standing after the forest is
logged. In addition, the functions that those tree and
other plant species provide, such as habitat or food for
insects, birds and animals, also remain intact. Large-
scale clearcutting eliminates or irrevocably changes the
forest structure and dynamic.

Currently, the average size of openings created by log-
ging companies in B.C. is approximately 26 hectares and
is allowed to be up to 40 hectares — perhaps even larg-
er, depending on the discretion of the Ministry of
Forests District Manager. This size opening is signifi-
cantly larger than that created by a natural disturbance.

Until B.C. companies implement radical and real
changes to their practices on the ground, they will not
comply with FSC standards and will not be certifiable.
The FSC does not certify vague “commitments”. The FSC

While the two models are extremely
different, logging companies have
promoted the CSA model as though it
does provide a guarantee of responsi-
ble on-the-ground logging, which is
clearly not the case. Concerned about
potential for misleading and confusing
CSA claims in the marketplace about
Canadian forestry practices, 56 envi-
ronmental groups, unions and First
nations from across Canada expressed
grave reservations and opposition to
the CSA process.

To date, the only wood certification
model enjoying widespread support
from environmental groups, labour,
First Nations and the marketplace is
that of the Forest Stewardship Council.

The FSC is a membership organization. Greenpeace
International is only one among several hundred mem-
bers of the Forest Stewardship Council, which also
includes some large forestry companies among its mem-
bers. Greenpeace supports the development of certifica-
tion and labeling as a tool to accelerate the implementa-
tion of ecologically responsible forest management by
mobilizing the power of the marketplace.

Greenpeace participates in the FSC system in order to pro-
mote the development and application of ecologically
responsible FSC standards of forestry management at all
levels. Greenpeace Canada has been involved in the FSC
process to develop standards for B.C. since this process was

initiated, and has actively supported certification initiatives
in B.C. even prior to the advent of the local FSC process.
In November 1995, Greenpeace Canada supported the
launch of Canada’s very first eco-certified logging opera-
tion, a certification that was conducted by B.C.’s Silva
Forest Foundation. The logging program that achieved
certification was developed by staff from the Small
Business Enterprise Program near Vernon, British
Columbia using single-tree selection logging with small-
scale equipment, employing more people than by mecha-
nized clearcutting operations. After logging, 70 per cent of
the forest remained standing. A global shift to sustainable
ecologically-based forest management is the best way to
protect biological diversity and endangered ecosystems.
