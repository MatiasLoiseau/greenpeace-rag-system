For decades, we have relied on oil, coal and gas to meet
our ever-increasing energy needs, and now we are facingthe consequences of our actions. Global warming hasbecome a threat that we can no longer ignore, with over60 percent of Americans living in areas with unhealthy air.  
America needs an energy policy makeover. Renewable
energy is affordable and available now. A national commitment to clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency would reduce pollution, create millions of hightech jobs, diversify our nation’s energy sources, enhanceour national security and save Americans billions of dollars. 
Despite the benefits of clean energy, the Bush adminis-
tration insists on keeping our nation tied to the dirty ener-gy industry. By catering to special interests likeHalliburton, Enron, ExxonMobil, Sempra and Shell, theBush administration has compromised our health andspoiled the environment for future generations to come. 
The Bush Administration’s Track Record
Clean Air Act: The Bush administration let the coal indus-
try off the hook by gutting the New Source Review provi-sions of the Clean Air Act.  This industry payback allowsdirty coal plants to emit more smog and other pollutants,causing acid rain and global warming.  
Mercury: Another dangerous toxin produced by coal plants
is mercury.  The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA)top scientist recently warned that one in every six childrenis born each year with potentially unsafe levels of mercury in their blood. Yet a component of the Clear Skies
Initiative recommends delaying the mercury cleanup mandated by current law for 10 to 20 years.  
Drilling on Public Lands: Greenpeace and the American
public keep reminding President Bush that public landsbelong to the public, but the administration does not seemto get the message. President Bush tried to drill the pristine Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and proposed avariety of other development projects.
Energy Bill: President Bush’s energy bill could have been
the legislation that built a clean energy economy; it isinstead laden with favors for the administration’s friendsin the dirty energy industry.  If passed, it will direct billionsof dollars toward the coal, nuclear and oil industry, yetAmerica’s Energy Future

does little to fight global warming, protect public health, 
conserve public lands, create sustainable jobs or promotenational security. 
Kyoto Protocol: President Bush also refused to sign the
Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce globalwarming emissions. 
A Vision for Clean Energy 
Not only is clean energy the morally sound and environmentally friendly choice, in many cases it is also theeconomical one. Clean energy has reached a point where itis cost-competitive with fossil fuels. With a strong federalcommitment, renewable energy prices will fall even further,and America will regain its role in the world as the leadingtechnological clean energy innovator.  
Greenpeace is proud to endorse the "Apollo Alliance," – a
broad coalition of labor, environmental, business, urbanand faith communities in support of good jobs and energyindependence. Apollo’s 10-point plan centers around a$300 billion investment in clean, renewable energy that willcreate over three million jobs, reinvest the savings fromclean energy back into the economy and decrease ourdependence on foreign fuels.  
Wind Power: Wind power is the fastest growing source of
power in the world and is quickly becoming the lowest costenergy source across the country. Studies show that windpower can supply 10 percent of the world's electricity within two decades. The Great Plains states have beendubbed the Saudi Arabia of wind energy – indeed, the windpotential there can supply our nation’s current energyneeds three times over.
Solar Power: Solar power has been growing in a global
capacity by 33 percent annually and can compete with localelectricity costs in several regions across the country.Greenpeace and industry research shows that with somegovernment support, the solar industry could supply electricity to over two billion people globally in 20 years. 
Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency is the easiest and
least expensive way to reduce our reliance on dirt energysources. New energy-efficient products, like light bulbs,refrigerators and hybrid cars, prove that we can drastically
reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil.
Through the use of these products, Americans savedenough energy to power 15 million homes, saving $7 billionlast year.Get Active
Greenpeace calls on the next president of the UnitedStates to create a new initiative for renewable energy inAmerica within the first 100 days in office. This standardshould mandate that 20 percent of our nation's energycome from renewable sources like wind and solar by 2020.In addition, the federal government should install 250Megawatts of solar power by the end of the first term, providing a huge boost to the U.S. solar industry.
Join Greenpeace in our nationwide campaign to make the
next four years the golden era for clean energy development in the United States. This commitment wouldslow global warming, reduce health risks like childhoodasthma and mercury contamination, while creating thousands of jobs and improving national security.
