 Department of Energy used gas industry insiders and consultants to build
 the case for soaring LNG exports

 ANALYSIS

 Overview
 For roughly the past decade, in the absence of a specifically articulated policy for reviewing liquefied
 natural gas (LNG) export applications, the Department of Energy (DOE) has adopted a  de facto  rubber
 stamping policy via standards that have not been fully explained to the public.

 To justify its track record of universally approving LNG export applications, DOE has relied on a series
 of economic and environmental studies commissioned by the agency and prepared with support from gas
 industry insiders and consultants.

 DOE’s most routinely cited economic studies, published in  2012  and  2018  ,  1  were authored by a NERA
 Economic Consulting team that included W. David Montgomery and Paul Bernstein, who have been
 called the oil & gas industry’s  “go-to” economists  .  Montgomery and Bernstein were hired by the
 American Petroleum Institute throughout the 1990s to write studies used to weaken, defeat, and delay
 climate policy. One of their  studies from 2017  was  even used by former president Trump to  justify exiting
 the Paris Agreement  .

 DOE has also routinely cited an environmental study, published in  2019  , that was supported by a team
 from KeyLogic Systems that did overlapping business with the gas industry between 2017 and 2020
 (exact dates unknown).  Of the five total authors, three others are now employed by the gas industry
 including one at Cheniere, the largest U.S. LNG exporter.

 Both the economic and environmental studies are severely flawed. The economic studies have been
 challenged by advocacy organizations for using  unrealistically  high gas demand projections  ,  failing to
 account for the projected benefits of climate policy  ,  and  concluding that the burden of higher energy costs
 for U.S. consumers would be offset by increased income from holding shares in LNG companies  . The
 2019 environmental study, as well as a  2014 DOE-commissioned  study  preceding it,  has been challenged
 for using very low estimates of methane leakage in the LNG supply chain, which underestimate the
 climate impacts of LNG, and for failing to consider the manner in which increased LNG exports can drive
 up total fossil fuel use.

 These deficiencies, combined with DOE’s choice to commission the studies from contractors with
 apparent conflicts of interest, suggest that DOE’s public interest determinations pertaining to approved
 LNG projects rest on a foundation of biased information.

 1   See, for example, citations in  Sabine Pass  (2015),  Freeport LNG  (2016),  Corpus Christi  (2016), and  Magnolia
 (2022).

 For ten years, DOE routinely dismissed  calls for transparency and updated rulemaking  , which
 conservation groups first submitted  in 2013  . The Biden Administration’s LNG pause indicates a new
 understanding that the past system was inadequate, and now is the time for DOE to close the door on
 these outdated studies.

 Throughout the process of re-evaluating its LNG policy, DOE must prevent the gas industry and its
 network of consultants from unduly influencing its new analysis, and ensure that this analysis fully
 accounts for the broad climate, equity, and public health impacts of LNG. Moreover, it is essential for
 DOE to require full participation from DOE offices beyond Fossil Energy & Carbon Management
 (FECM), such as the Office of Energy Justice and Equity and the Office of State and Community Energy
 Programs, and to facilitate an inclusive process with participation from environmental justice
 communities and other stakeholders outside the gas industry.

 Behind the NERA economic studies

 ●

 Since 2012, DOE FECM has commissioned three studies that focus on the macroeconomic
 impacts of LNG exports.  The first of these studies  ,  published in 2012, was performed by a NERA
 Economic Consulting team led by W. David Montgomery;  the second study  , published in 2015,
 was performed jointly by the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University’s Baker Institute and
 Oxford Economics; and  the third study  , published in  2018, was again performed by NERA
 Economic Consulting through DOE’s  support contractor KeyLogic Systems Inc.

 ○

 KeyLogic, which also supported DOE’s 2019 environmental study, is investigated further
 in the next section.

 ●

 NERA has a long history  of working for the gas, coal,  and tobacco industries, and has
 produced numerous reports that have been characterized as “inaccurate” and
 “misleading.”

 ○

 ○

 In the 1990s  , NERA published a report claiming there  was no connection between
 tobacco advertising and smoking levels.
 President Trump  cited negative economic statistics  from a 2017 NERA report  sponsored
 by the oil industry-funded  American Council for Capital  Formation think tank  and the
 U.S. Chamber of Commerce  in his speech announcing  that the United States intended to
 withdraw from the Paris climate accord

 ●

 Cheniere, the top U.S. LNG exporter, paid NERA to publish an  updated version of its DOE
 study  in 2014.

 ○

 In that year, W. David Montogery, one of the report authors,  testified before a Senate
 committee  that “unlimited” LNG exports benefit the  U.S. economy and “the less
 regulators restrict U.S. exports, the greater the benefits from natural gas production.”

 ●

 Montgomery, the 2012 project lead and author on NERA’s three LNG studies, and Paul
 Bernstein, another prominent author on the studies, have been called  the oil & gas
 industries “go-to” economists  by  Benjamin Franta  ,  an expert in oil & gas industry
 disinformation and climate delay.

 According to a  2022 peer-reviewed article  authored  by Franta, these economists played a
 “key role helping to undermine carbon pricing, international climate agreements, and
 other climate policies from the early 1990s onward.” More specifically, Franta identifies
 Montgomery and Bernstein as prominent examples of economists hired by the fossil fuel
 industry to produce “biased” economic analyses that inflate the predicted costs of climate
 policies while ignoring their benefits in order to weaken, defeat, and delay climate policy.
 In a  2017 blog post  , Franta highlighted the frequency  with which Montgomery and
 Bernstein accepted work from the American Petroleum Institute in the 1990s. “Whenever
 the threat of climate policy arose, the American Petroleum Institute hired one or both of
 these economists to pen a report claiming high costs and recommending policy delay.
 This strategy was used in  1991  against carbon dioxide  control, in  1993  against the
 Clinton Administration’s proposed BTU tax, in  1996  against the goals of the U.N.
 Conference of Parties in Geneva, in  1997  against the  goals of the U.N. Conference of
 Parties in Kyoto, and in  1998  against the Kyoto Protocol’s  implementation.”
 Montgomery, Bernstein, and two of their three co-authors on the 2018 study also jointly
 authored the  2017 NERA report  that  Trump used to justify  exiting the Paris Agreement  .

 ●

 The NERA studies use incomplete models and problematic assumptions that are inherently
 biased toward showing that any limitations on LNG exports hurt economic growth.

 Several methodological flaws are pointed out  in a  public comment on the 2018 study
 submitted by Oil Change International and Food & Water Watch on behalf of more than
 60 concerned organizations. These flaws include failing to estimate the economic  costs
 associated with global warming and air pollution, which are necessary to assess whether
 LNG exports are economically beneficial overall; using unrealistically high gas demand
 projections; and failing to account for renewable energy growth.
 The NERA studies have been challenged by  Sierra Club  and  Public Citizen  for
 concluding that the burden of higher energy costs for U.S. consumers would be offset by
 increased income from holding shares in LNG companies. (The absurdity here is
 underscored by the fact that,  as of January 2024  ,  10% of the U.S. population own 93% of
 stock wealth.)
 According to  Franta (2022)  , the models that Montgomery  and Bernstein used in the
 1990s relied on the “illogical” assumption that emissions reductions were achieved
 primarily by reducing energy use (as opposed to switching to renewable energy sources).
 Similarly, it is unclear whether the newer LNG-focused studies account for the potential
 for economic losses in the LNG sector to be substituted with gains in other sectors (such
 as renewable energy).

 ●

 The economic metrics used by the DOE and NERA (e.g., net economic impact) are
 insufficient for making a public interest determination because they do not account for
 consumer well-being, environmental justice, or other distributional impacts.

 ○

 The  DOE has acknowledged the importance of distributional impacts before  , stating that
 “there may be circumstances in which the distributional consequences of an authorizing
 decision could be shown to be so negative as to outweigh net positive benefits to the U.S.

 3

 economy as a whole.” But it has not adopted a framework that considers distributional
 impacts in practice.
 DOE’s own research, including the NERA studies and  a study performed by U.S. EIA  ,
 shows that LNG exports raise household energy costs.
 Peer-reviewed research  indicates that pollution associated  with the oil and gas supply
 chain disproportionately impacts communities of color and low-income communities.

 Behind the KeyLogic/Booz Allen Hamilton environmental studies

 ●

 The LNG life cycle emissions studies commissioned by DOE FECM were published in 2014 and
 2019. Both studies were prepared by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) with
 support from a team of consultants led by Joe Marriott (2010–2017) and Greg Cooney
 (2017–2020). This team started at Booz Allen Hamilton, which was contracted for the 2014 study,
 and moved to KeyLogic Systems in 2016 after KeyLogic was  awarded a $112 million NETL
 contract  , which paid for the 2019 study and other  projects.  2

 ●

 In between co-authoring the 2014 study with Booz Allen Hamilton and leading the
 KeyLogic team that supported the 2019 study, Cooney took a full-time position at the gas
 company EQT Corporation for 11 months.

 ○

 EQT is one of the companies that is  most actively  opposing the LNG pause  .

 ●

 The KeyLogic team was doing business with the gas industry while KeyLogic was fulfilling
 the DOE/NETL contract that paid for the 2019 study.

 ○

 ○

 According to  LinkedIn  , Cooney led business development  for KeyLogic Inc. to “expand
 services into the commercial market and successfully contract[] with two major oil and
 gas clients to provide LCA support,” in addition to leading his team’s work for
 DOE/NETL.  3  Competing interest disclosures from a later project suggest that these
 clients were Cheniere and Saudi Aramco.  4
 The same former KeyLogic employees who disclosed this commercial work were also
 heavily involved with the DOE/NETL 2019 study.

 2  The authors listed on the  2014 study  are Timothy  J. Skone (NETL) and  Gregory Cooney  ,  Matthew Jamieson  ,
 James Littlefield  , and  Joe Marriott  (then employed  by Booz Allen Hamilton). Jamieson, Littlefield, and Marriott
 moved to KeyLogic in July 2016, about two months after it was announced that KeyLogic was awarded the
 five-year mission execution and strategic analysis (MESA) contract with NETL. Cooney first took a position at the
 gas company EQT Corporation in August 2016 and then joined the KeyLogic team as its principal engineer and
 team lead in June 2017. The listed authors on the  2019 study  are Selina Roman-White, Srijana Rai, Littlefield,
 Cooney, and Skone (all employed by KeyLogic except for Skone). Don Remson (NETL) and Marriott (KeyLogic)
 are acknowledged for their “overall guidance and review of draft versions” of the 2019 report.
 3  Based on Cooney’s tenure at KeyLogic, it can be concluded that these commercial contracts were active between
 June 2017 and December 2020 (exact dates unknown). This timespan fully overlaps with  KeyLogic’s DOE/NETL
 contract  , which was ongoing from July 2016 through  March 2023.
 4  Greenpeace USA has concluded that Roman-White and Littlefield were likely consulting for Cheniere and Saudi
 Aramco while working at KeyLogic between 2017 and 2020 based on their professional histories and information
 from Cooney’s LinkedIn profile.

 Of the five total authors of the 2019 study, three are now employed by the gas industry, and
 Cooney is now employed by DOE FECM.

 The first listed author,  Selina Roman-White  , took  a full-time position at Cheniere in May
 2021. Another one of the authors,  Littlefield  , took  a full-time position at Aramco
 Americas in June 2021. These are the same former KeyLogic employees who disclosed
 that they consulted for Cheniere and Saudi Aramco before taking full-time positions at
 the companies.
 In March 2022, their co-author Srijana Rai took a position at GTI Energy, a think tank
 representing the gas industry  .
 In December 2020, Cooney left KeyLogic to work as an independent consultant for the
 chemical company DuPont. In September 2021, he took a position at DOE FECM as
 Senior Engineer  supporting life cycle assessment efforts  for the Policy & Analysis team  .

 ●

 The studies use very low estimates of methane leakage in the LNG supply chain, which
 likely underestimates LNG's true climate impact.

 ○

 The 2019 study estimates that cradle-through-transmission methane emissions for U.S.
 gas delivered to liquefaction terminals are only 0.7%. This value is taken from EPA data
 that have been shown to systematically underestimate methane emissions from oil and
 gas.  5  The report focuses on data from 2016 and also  cherry-picks EPA data from a
 lower-emissions basin, ignoring the recent surge in gas production from regions with
 much higher methane emissions that are supplying gas for LNG exports.  The most
 advanced study to-date  , which incorporated nearly  a million aerial measurements of
 methane emissions, concluded that the methane leak rate across six U.S. regions was
 2.95% (95% CI 2.79%, 3.14%).
