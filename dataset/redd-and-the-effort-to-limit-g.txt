The Economics of 2°C and REDD 
in Carbon Markets  
Greenpeace summary of KEA3 report: “REDD and the effort to 
limit global warming to 2°C: Implications for inclu ding REDD 
credits in the international carbon market” 
30 March 2009 
 
Background  
 
To avoid catastrophic climate change, global temper ature rise must be kept as far below 2°C as 
possible. 1  To achieve this goal, a strong and stable carbon price is needed to drive necessary 
investments in clean and renewable technologies wor ldwide. 2   
 
Climate change discussions have increasingly focuse d on the need to reduce emissions from 
deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD), which account for about 
20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  While ther e is ongoing debate on the best means of 
financing REDD, three primary options have been pro posed:  
• market-offset approaches (where fungible credits f rom REDD are included in the carbon 
markets and used by industrialised countries to off set their emissions);  
• market-linked and “hybrid” approaches (e.g. auctio ning of carbon permits; Greenpeace 
Forests for Climate (TDERM) proposal; CCAP Dual Mar kets approach); and  
• non-market approaches (such as levies, taxes, and fees)  
 
Purpose of Research  
 
Questions have been raised about the extent to whic h including REDD credits in the carbon 
markets would reduce incentives to invest in clean and renewable technologies and affect our 
ability to stay well below 2°C. Greenpeace therefor e commissioned the economic modelling 
experts at KEA 3 to examine the impacts of includin g REDD in the carbon markets.   
 
Key Report Findings  
 
• Including forest offset credits in the carbon mark ets would crash the price of carbon up to 75% 
under currently stated reduction targets 3 and 70% for the reduction target most consistent w ith 
the 2°C goal (40%). 4  If a lower potential supply of REDD credits is as sumed, the price of 
carbon would still fall by 60%. 5   
 
• Under either scenario, REDD credits would signific antly reduce investments in clean and 
renewable technologies in both  developed and developing countries. 6  In delaying such 
investments, REDD credits could cause a “lock in” e ffect, keeping high-carbon technologies 
and infrastructures in place for many years to come .  The sunken costs associated with 
carbon-intensive economies could increase the overa ll costs of mitigation. 7  
 
• Including REDD credits in the carbon markets would  reduce investments in clean technologies 
in developing countries, such as China, India, and Brazil, as there would be less demand for 
credits generated by emission reduction policies in  energy and industry sectors. 8  For 
example, China alone would lose an estimated $10-10 0 billion per year in clean energy and 
technology investments. 
 
• By integrating forest credits in carbon markets, d eveloped countries could significantly overpay 
for reducing emissions from deforestation, due to t he difference between the costs of REDD to 
developing countries and the international price of  carbon. This could come at the expense of 
additional mitigation opportunities in developing c ountries. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
Greenpeace Conclusions  
  
• World leaders must find a way to provide significa nt and reliable financing for REDD which is additio nal to deep 
emission reductions in industrialised countries and  ambitious renewable energy and energy efficiency 
investments in developing countries.  Among availab le financing options, the direct inclusion of fores t offset 
credits in the carbon markets carries the greatest risks to both the climate and the forests.  REDD cr edits could 
depress and cause major fluctuations to the price o f carbon thereby preventing the investments in clea n and 
renewable technologies needed to keep global temper ature rise well below 2°C.   
 
• Including REDD credits in carbon markets would cau se countries – both north and south – to “lock in” dirty 
technologies, such as coal-fired power stations, in  the next decade. Such a scenario could significant ly increase 
the overall costs of long term mitigation and imped e the ability to stay well below 2°C.  To prevent s uch 
unintended consequences, governments must focus on providing a strong and stable price of carbon as we ll as 
providing strong overall reduction targets.  
  
• While certain developing countries with tropical f orests could initially benefit financially from sel ling REDD offset 
credits, the resulting delay in stopping global emi ssions would mean their forests could ultimately be  destroyed 
due to the impacts of failed mitigation of climate change, which is likely to increase as a result of REDD offset 
credits.  According to recent modelling by the Met Office Hadley Centre (UK), the probability of irrev ersible loss 
of much of the Amazon forest increases dramatically  above a 2°C rise in temperature. 9   
 
• The report shows the negative impacts of REDD cred its while assuming they are of comparable quality t o 
energy credits.  However, significant questions of permanence, leakage, and additionality have been ra ised 
about potential REDD credits; as well as the abilit y of countries to accurately measure, monitor, and report on 
such emissions.   Issues of quality need to be addr essed for any REDD mechanism to succeed, but cause 
significant problems when REDD is used to offset in dustrialised country emissions.    
 
Greenpeace Recommendations 
 
• Carbon markets must provide a strong and stable pr ice of carbon to drive the development of clean and  
renewable technologies and should therefore remain focused on the more easily quantifiable and compara ble 
fossil fuel emissions.  A separate mechanism is nee ded to deal with the complexities and risks associa ted with 
REDD.   
 
• A successful REDD mechanism cannot be based on the inclusion of REDD offset cre dits in the carbon 
markets  but should rather have the following characteristi cs: 
o Contain the goal of ending gross deforestation  and associated emissions in all countries by 2020,  and 
achieve zero deforestation in priority areas (such as the Amazon, the Congo Basin, and in Indonesia an d the 
Archipelagos) by 2015.  
o Require national-level reductions  in forest emissions in order to avoid the problem of leakage (i.e. 
deforestation shifting from one area to another), w hich would inevitably result from project-based (i. e. “sub-
national”) approaches.  
o allow for the broad participation of countries  with tropical forests  
o benefit biodiversity protection consistent with international convention s and objectives to avoid perverse 
incentives and outcomes   
o fully respect the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities  and provide a forum where their 
issues may be raised  
o ensure that  benefits are equitably shared  among and within countries  
o provide for independent monitoring and verification  of activities and results.  
 
• Greenpeace has put forward its own proposal for a hybrid market-linked fund mechanism that would meet  these 
requirements, avoid the problems associated with ma rket-offset mechanisms for REDD, and become part of  the 
next phase of the Kyoto Protocol.  To learn more ab out the Greenpeace Forests for Climate (TDERM)

About the authors 
 
The KEA 3 principals involved with the report “ REDD and the effort to limit global warming to 2°C:  Implications 
for including REDD credits in the international car bon market (30 March 2009)”  had previously collaborated 
with the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW ) on a REDD analysis for the New Zealand government .  
The report has been peer reviewed by Dr. Jayant Sat haye, an internationally-recognised authority on cl imate 
change, forestry and energy issues, leader of the I nternational Energy Studies Group at the Lawrence B erkeley 
National Laboratories (Berkeley, California) and a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Clim ate Change 
(IPCC) since 1990.  
 
Report Methodology 
 
KEA 3 utilised a numerical partial equilibrium mode l of the global carbon market in the year 2020, inc luding energy-
intensive and non-energy intensive sectors for both  Annex I and CDM regions, to quantify the impacts o f including 
REDD offset credits in the carbon market.  The mode l focused on reductions in the 25-40% range identif ied by the 
IPCC as being necessary for keeping global temperat ure rise to 2.0-2.4°C. A broad number of scenarios for 
incorporating REDD credits into the carbon markets were modelled (unlimited REDD, 50% and 20% limitati ons on 
REDD).  A sensitivity analysis was then conducted w here the potential supply of REDD credits was both doubled 
and halved to provide for a more comprehensive anal ysis of impacts.

4  KEA 3 results based on an estimated baseline defo restation rate of 5.798 GtCo2-eq, largely consisten t with the baseline rates of 
deforestation only (not including degradation) of 5 .8-7.2 GtCo2-eq found in the following sources: UNF CCC Report on the analysis of 
existing and potential investment and financial flo ws relevant to the development of an effective and appropriate international response to 
climate change, at 18 (2007); IPCC Fourth Assessmen t Report, Working Group III, Chapter 9: Forestry (2 007); Stern Review, the 
Economics of Climate Change, part III, at 176 (2006 ); Carbon Sunk: The Potential impacts of Avoided De forestation Credits on Emissions 
Trading Schemes, Paul Leach, Rainforest Foundation (2008) (based on FAO figures).  
 
5  The base model used by KEA 3 assumed a baseline d eforestation rate of 4.5 GtCo2-eq per year, less th an the sources above, but more 
than that contained in certain other studies.  The estimation of baseline deforestation rates and the potential supply of REDD credits can 
vary in such studies and yield significant changes in modeling results.   
 
6  Most studies on REDD to date have focused exclusi vely on impacts on investments in industrialised co untries. 
 
7  “Sunken costs” are costs that cannot be recovered  once they have been incurred.  For instance, the K EA 3 report points out that once a 
coal fired power plant has been built, it will like ly be allowed to continue to operate for an extende d period of time despite large increases in 
the price of carbon.  
 
8.  KEA 3's model is based on existing available data and therefore assumes the CDM remains the same as i t is right now.  However,  
Greenpeace believes that from 2013 onwards, the Cle an Development Mechanism (CDM) as a project-based m echanism should be 
limited to least developed countries and other deve loping countries with little capacity to act. For o ther, more able developing countries, the 
post-2012 deal needs to provide new crediting mecha nisms, such as sectoral and national no-lose target s, which incentivise long-term low-
carbon development planning on a sectoral and econo my-wide level, deliver additional emissions reducti ons and reduce transaction costs.
