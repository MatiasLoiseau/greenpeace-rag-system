Allocation Design and I ncentives 
 
The carbon pri ce is the main vehicle for generating emissions red uctions in cap and trade 
programs. The carbon price signal in broad terms do es not depend on the primary method of 
allocation. The carbon price is primarily a functio n of the stringency of the cap and the 
eligible emission reduction options. These factors remain unaffected by the decision whether 
allowances are allocated for free or auctioned by g overnment. 
 
However, there are numerous specific provisions und er each allocation method that may impact
emitter behavior by either enhancing the effectiven ess of the price signal or impeding it. 
Unfortunately, much of the debate surrounding cap a nd trade programs focus on the wealth 
distribution issues related to allocation and less attention is devoted to 
effects of the “small print”.  
 
One of the main advantages of cap and trade is that  it exposes all covered emitters to a uniform 
price signal thereby making sure that reductions ar e introduced and capital allocated according

Impact of Allocation on Consumer Behavior 
 
Climate legislation cannot be effective unless the true causes of climate change are exposed to 
the true cost of emissions. While a cap and trade p rogram levies the burden on the emitters, the 
cost needs to be passed on effectively to consumers  so that the 
changes. There is ample evidence of substantial ene rgy efficiency potential and alternative 
ways of behavior at consumer level that can be assi sted by a price signal. 
 
However, it is equally important to contain the cos t for consume 
emissions and hence preventing the consumer from fi nancing the potential windfall profits that 
may occur under cap and trade type programs. It is a legitimate political aim to prevent 
excessive cost to be passed on to consum 
those cost while maintaining an efficient incentive  to reduce emissions. These ways may include 
tax reductions or other cash transfers or it may be  achieved through various forms of allowance 
allocations. In an auction based cap and trade program, gov ernment could return some of the 
auction revenue to the consumers, whilst in a syste m based on free allocation of allowances a 
certain share of the allowances can be set aside to  consumer groups. 
 
However it is also possible to design a consumer refund pro gram in a way that jeopardizes the 
efficiency of the cap and trade system. This happen s if money or allocations are returned to the

Efficiency of Allocation Provisions

(LDC’s), merchant coal generators, long 
vulnerable industries, refineries, natural gas LDC’ s, carbon capture and 
efficiency programs, and early compliance actors.  The main allocated segments that will be 
discussed are electric LDC’s, coal generators, trade vulnerable industries, refin eries, small 
LDC’s, and general early actors.  
 
1. Electricity Local Distribution Companies (LDC’s) 
 
The single largest group receiving allowance alloca tions is the group of LDC’s.  
Electricity LDC’s are granted roughly 40% of allowa nces in 2012 ($23.2 B), decreasing 
to 0% by 2030. These allowances are divided among t he ex

The provisions specifying the allocation formula fo r LDC’s interfere with the cap and 
trade program in two ways, by muting the incentive for consumers to change 
consumption behavior, and by providing incentives f or LDC’s to gam 
order to get a higher baseline rating.  
 
The main intention of the allocations to LDCs is 
due to the cap and trade program.  While the bill d oes specify that any reductions should 
be made toward s the fixed cost portion of the bill, so consumers would still respond to 
the variable cost portion of their bill, this will still result in reduced incentive for 
consumers to reduce consumption since consumers do not readily differentiate between 
fixed an d variable cost portion.  Thus by returning money t o consumers through bill 
rebates, the program directly interferes with custo mer efforts to reduce consumption, 
which is one of the core mechanisms for reducing em issions under a cap and trade 
program. This approach also would require the involvement and pos sibly disparate 
implementation rules of some 50 state utility regul ators

through a cash r efund mechanism or tax cuts.

served in the base year.  The base year is a 3 year  period from 1999 and 2008, or 2012 
for an LDC that acquires or purchases power from a new coal unit after the base year.  A 
provision of the bill prohibits the EPA from granti ng allowances in excess of the LDC’s 
cost increases due to cap and trade program.  Addit ionally, the allowances are to be 
used exclusively for consumer benefit or reduction of  customer bill increases.  
The provisions specifying the allocation formula fo r LDC’s interfere with the cap and 
trade program in two ways, by muting the incentive for consumers to change 
consumption behavior, and by providing incentives f or LDC’s to gam e the system in 
order to get a higher baseline rating.

due to the cap and trade program.  While the bill d oes specify that any reductions should

In terms of the LDC base year, under normal circums tances the LDC’s must choose a 3 
year period from 1999 through 2008 as their base ye ar period.  However, the base year 
choice has an exception, which could increase emiss ions

year period in the past to 2012 if the LDC purchase s or

a direct increase in emissions in 2012,

Under the LDC allocation: 
• Customer behavior changes are directly counteracted  by customer rebates on 
utility bills.  Customer rebates are acceptable for  limiting political fallout, 
rebates should be detached from power consumption i n order to maintain 
conservation incentives.  One commonly suggested al ternative is to provide 
rebates on taxes. 
• As a general observation, rules for allocation of f ree allowance should be 
designed in such a way that they do not create incentives to  increase emissions.

generation.  The existing baseline provision overly incentivizes  coal facilities. 
any provisions are made for new facilities, the adj ustment should be based solely 
on the portion of emissions attributable to the new facility. 
 
2. Coal Power Plants 
 
Traditional coal power facilities are eligible for incentives as merchant power generators, 
or indirectly through the electric LDC allocation.  Additionally, coal facilities that employ 
carb on capture and storage are eligible for significant  incentives which ramp up over 
time.   In terms of the LDC base year, under normal circums tances the LDC’s must choose a 3 
year period from 1999 through 2008 as their base ye ar period.  However, the base year 
choice has an exception, which could increase emiss ions  and allow LDC’s to game the 
allocation system.  Under the LDC allocations, an L DC’s base year is changed from a 3 
year period in the past to 2012 if the LDC purchase s or buys electricity from a new coal 
facility.  Under such a program, an LDC could delib e rately inflate the emissions from the 
electricity sources in 2012 and then purchase a coal facility or enter a long term power 
in order to maximize their emissions allocation. Th is would result in 
a direct increase in emissions in 2012, and would also increase the demand for new coal 
power facilities.  To avoid manipulation all baseli ne years should be in the past. 
due to a new coal facility  should account for the emissions from 
the new facility alone, and not for t he emissions footprint of an entire LDC.  These coa l 
facilities would still be subject to a performance standard which we discuss below.  
One additional consideration is the allocation to s mall LDC’s, which receive an extra 
allowance allocation under the  provisions of the bill.  The amounts allocated to L DC’s 
are relatively small, so they are not significant o n the larger scale.  However, the 
allocations to small LDC’s are made solely on the b asis of emissions , which means they 
are provided to those small  LDC’s with a disproportionately emissions intensive
