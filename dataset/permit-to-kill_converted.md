SIERRA CLUB & GREENPEACE EXPLAIN

PERMIT TO KILL:
WE ANALYZED THE IMPACT OF
AIR POLLUTION FROM LNG
TERMINALS

IN ADDITION TO COSTING OVER
$957 MILLION IN HEALTH
COSTS AND 60 AVOIDABLE
DEATHS PER YEAR...

...HERE’S WHAT WE FOUND

On average, Black and Hispanic
Americans would experience air
pollution from LNG terminals at
110-170% the rate of white
Americans, if all projects slated
for 2030 are built.

FAILURE TO STOP THE BUILDOUT
LEADS TO AVOIDABLE DEATHS

See How Many People Are Dying Early
Based off Each LNG Terminal:

Our analysis covered all 32 operating, under
construction, and planned onshore LNG
export terminal projects in the lower 48 states
with draft or final Clean Air Act permits.

PREDICTIVE MODELING:
3 SCENARIOS  OVER THE 2023–2050 TIMEFRAME
UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS

The Full Buildout scenario assumes that all 32
of the projects in our report come online. This
reflects a policy of returning to unrestricted
LNG export approvals.

The No New Permits scenario assumes that
all projects with DOE export authorization are
brought online, but no new export
applications are approved for pending
projects.

The Operating Projects Only scenario
assumes that current operating projects
continue operating, but no new projects,
including under-construction projects, come
online.

TO RECAP:

Overburdened, climate-vulnerable, and
already-poor-air-quality parishes and
counties in Texas and Louisiana would feel
the effects of the air pollution the most.

Terminals are just one of many aspects of
the broader LNG industry that leads to
deaths, health harms, and costs.

Department of Energy (DOE) and other
government agencies can look at the long-
term health impacts of LNG export facilities
and decide that LNG projects are not in the
public interest, saving thousands of lives
and billions of dollars!
