HOMELAND SECURITY REGULATIONS (CFATS) ARE WHOLLY INADEQUATE

COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION IS ESSENTIAL TO SECURITY

INHERENTLY SAFER TECHNOLGIES
WILL ELIMINATE THE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES OF AN ATTACK

March 3, 2010

"There are other ways to reduce risk that need to be part of the
equation. Specifically, by employing safer technologies, we can
reduce the attractiveness of chemical plants as a target."
--- Senator Barack Obama, March 30, 2006

“It’s time for the big chemical companies to do their part to help protect America.
They should stop manufacturing dangerous chemicals when safer substitutes are
available.  And if they won’t do it, Congress should do it for them...”
--- Association of American Railroads, February 27, 2008

CONVENTIONAL SECURITY IS NOT ENOUGH

The September 11th terrorist attacks successfully used our own infrastructure against us
with tragic results. They also demonstrated that tight perimeter security, such as in the
case of the Pentagon, is incapable of preventing such attacks. Should a chemical plant
be targeted, a truck bomb, a small plane, helicopter or a high powered rifle would easily
render the industry’s current reliance on fence-line security totally useless. In fact, U.S.
chemical facilities have been referred to by then Senator Obama on the Senate floor as
“stationary weapons of mass destruction.”

The recent domestic terrorist attack on an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) office building
in Austin is a sobering reminder of the nearly nine years of neglect following the 9/11
attacks. The vulnerability of U.S. chemical plants to terrorism and serious accidents such
as the 1984 disaster in Bhopal, India and in 2008 in Institute, West Virgina have been
widely recognized. The potential magnitude of these risks far surpasses the 9/11
attacks. Once released these chemicals and gases can remain dangerous for up to 14
miles in an urban area (20 miles in a rural area) and put the lives of millions of
Americans at risk. A December 2009 Congressional Research Service analysis of
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data identified 91 chemical facilities that each
put 1,000,000 or more Americans at risk.

The nature of these risks meets any definition of a weapon of mass destruction. The
manner in which people would be killed and injured is terrifying. Poison gases such as
chlorine will literally melt the lungs of its victims causing them to drown in their own lung
fluid (pulmonary edema). Survivors could be left with life long disorders.

Following the 9/11 attacks it was reported that 9/11 ringleader, Mohamed Atta, visited a
Tennessee chemical plant asking lots of questions (December 16, 2001 Washington
Post). In the first six months of 2007 at least five successful terrorist attacks in Iraq used
relatively small (150 to 250 pound) cylinders of chlorine gas to kill dozens of people. As
a result the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began briefing local bomb squads
and chemical plants across the country. (April 24, 2007 USA Today) In February and
April of 2007 thefts of 150 pound cylinders of chlorine gas occurred in California
prompting questions by members of this Committee to the DHS about their response to
these thefts, any other thefts and plans to eliminate these vulnerabilities by using
inherently safer technologies.

U.S. chemical facilities were not built or designed to defend against terrorist attacks. And
predicting where an attack will take place is a fool’s errand. No one predicted that
Timothy McVeigh would attack the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168
innocent people.

On June 25, 2007, duPont Chairman Charles O. Holliday Jr. told the media that he
worries most about a computer system failure or a security breach at one of the
company's chemical plants around the world. "I feel very comfortable that we've taken all
the reasonable steps, but obviously if someone wants to fly an airplane into a plant, it's
very hard to guard against it," said Holliday.

Stephen Flynn, Senior Fellow in National Security Studies at the Council on Foreign
Relations warned in his 2007 book, The Edge of Disaster, " "...While attacks on the
electric grid, oil and gas facilities, major ports, and the food-supply system have the
potential to create the greatest cascading economic effects, it is chemical facilities near
urban population centers that have the potential to inflict the greatest casualties. Placing
them at the top of the list of priorities is obvious...In most cases, chemical plants that
threaten nearby populations can switch to less dangerous substances. This practice is
known as “inherently safer technology,” or IST…Without a strong mandate from the
federal government, it’s unrealistic to think they ever will. Yet voluntary compliance is the
premise of the legislation Congress passed last fall [2006]; the new rules rest on the
assumption that companies will now suddenly begin taking steps they have so far
refused to contemplate.”

The Result Could be Catastrophic:

--- In July, 2004, the Homeland Security Council estimated that an attack on a single
chlorine facility could kill 17,500 people, severely injure an additional 10,000 and result
in 100,000 hospitalizations and 70,000 evacuations.

--- In January, 2004, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory testified before the
Washington, D.C. City Council warning that 100,000 people could be killed or injured in
the first 30 minutes of a catastrophic release of a tank car of chlorine or similar chemical
within blocks of Capitol Hill. They further estimated that people could “die at rate of 100
per second.”

--- In June, 2003 FBI specialist on weapons of mass destruction, Troy Morgan, in a
speech at a chemical industry conference warned, “You’ve heard about sarin and other
chemical weapons in the news. But it’s far easier to attack a rail car full of toxic industrial
chemicals than it is to compromise the security of a military base and obtain these
materials.”

THE CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE FATALLY FLAWED:

The best that can be said for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chemical
security regulations, "Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards" (CFATS) is that they
represent an official recognition of the widespread vulnerability of U.S. chemical plants to
terrorism. The new DHS rules are based on a 744 word “rider,” Sec. 550 of the
Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2007. Sec. 550 authorizes “interim” regulations
that will expire on October 4, 2009. The Obama Administration subsequently asked for
and received a subsequent extension until October 4, 2010 explicitly to allow Congress
to enact comprehensive legislation that will “supersede” Sec. 550’s regulations.

The DHS rules finalized on November 20, 2007 fail to provide adequate protection for
the nation and communities living in the shadow of thousands of U.S. chemical plants.

3

Specifically, the interim chemical security law and DHS rules (CFATS):

--- Prohibit the DHS from requiring any “particular security measure” including safer
technologies that can reduce or eliminate the magnitude of an attack at virtually any
chemical facility. To satisfy the chemical lobby, this was added to Sec. 550 (a) to prevent
the use of safer technologies as a security measure but it also undermines the
effectiveness of the entire statute by undercutting the DHS to credibly require ANY
“particular security measure.”

--- Fail to ensure priority protection of the 3,400 to 4,391 facilities each of which put
1,000 or more people at risk according to the DHS estimates. The DHS reports that they
now have approximately 6,023 facilities in one of the four risk tiers with 793 in risk tiers 1
and 2. This leave approximately 5,230 in the lower two tiers with risk profiles that likely
put 1,000 or more people at risk. Furthermore, Sec. 550 gives the Secretary of the DHS
full discretion in determining which facilities will be considered to “present high levels of
security risk.” Clearly more guidance is needed in prioritizing high-risk facilities.

--- Fail to protect approximately 2,400 U.S. water treatment plants as well as several
other exempted categories. Approximately 73 water treatment plants each put 100,000
or more people at risk. This exemption, also in Sec. 550 (a), covers public water systems
regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. In
June 2007 Secretary Chertoff spoke to water facilities operators warning them that even
though they are exempt under the interim law they are “on the hook because you’re
going to have to do this yourselves because the consequences of ignoring risks…will be
quite severe.” Once again this gap needs to be closed with comprehensive legislation.

--- Fail to protect 400 to 600 facilities regulated under the Maritime Transportation
Security Act of 2002 also exempted by Sec. 550 (a).

--- Fail to protect the public’s right-to-know by asserting authority to classify previously
public information as secret, including information used in civil or criminal enforcement
actions. Sec. 550 (c) and resulting new DHS regulations overreach by going beyond
protecting common sense security plans and vulnerabilities into undermining
enforcement and covering up governmental incompetence or corporate liability.

--- Fail to require meaningful involvement of plant employees in developing Security
Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans. The DHS responded to comments
saying “there is nothing in the rule that prohibits chemical facilities from involving
employees in their security efforts.” While we should be thankful for that, such a policy
fails to tap the expertise of a workforce that is formally trained in chemical hazard
protection, accident prevention and emergency response. Employees are the first line of
defense and the eyes, ears and noses of chemical facilities. The failure to formally
involve employees in developing vulnerability assessments and security plans is foolish
from both a security and scarce resource perspective.

--- Fail to include whistleblower protections that would enhance enforcement. The DHS
rules promise to set up an anonymous tip line but ignores the long history of
whistleblowers who have exposed waste, fraud and abuse. In this case they could save
thousands of lives.

4

--- Fail to enhance enforcement by allowing citizens to sue to enforce the law, while
allowing companies liberal appeals procedures to challenge DHS orders and decisions.
Sec. 550 (d) prevents anyone but the DHS from suing a plant owner or operator to
enforce any provision of this law. Once again, the law is balanced in favor of protecting
the rights of recalcitrant facilities and/or violators and leaving innocent citizens facing
overriding lethal risks with no legal recourse.

--- Prohibit the public from knowing which facilities are regulated under CFATS, if they
are in compliance. Both DHS and corporate credibility will be in jeopardy if communities
cannot determine if local chemical plant that pose these risks are being made safe or if
they are in violation or is resisting orders by the DHS. Nor will communities even have
the peace of mind of knowing whether a plant has voluntarily converted to safer
technologies and no longer poses a threat to their community.

S. 2996 is a Continuation of the Same Flawed Program:

On February 4th Senator Collins (R-ME) introduced a bill (S. 2996) that would do nothing
but extend this flawed law for five more years. We strongly oppose this bill and any
further delay in comprehensive chemical security legislation.

Until now, Senator Collins has consistently said, on the Senate floor and in public
statements, that the 2006 law (Section 550 which authorized CFATS) was “NOT” a
comprehensive statute.

For a full copy of Senator Collins’ floor statement, please visit:
http://thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?r109:10:./temp/~r109SJf200::

21b3f6-62c9-4b63-985d-6a41bbeb00e4&Region_id=&Issue_id=

She elaborated extensively on this point in her formal February 7, 2007 comments to the
DHS on CFATS in which she criticized the Bush administration for suggesting that they
could extend the temporary law without approval by Congress.  Below are few examples
of her comments DHS about the interim nature of CFATS and the intent of Congress to
revisit comprehensive legislation:

“In drafting Section 550, the intent of Congress was clear and unambiguous – this
statutory provision provides the Department strong, interim authority for up to
three years until permanent, comprehensive authority can be enacted.

 “Section 550 was a streamline version of chemical security legislation; it was not
the comprehensive authorizing legislation that Congress intended to be the final
authority on this matter.

“This period also provides Congress an opportunity to oversee implementation of
the Department’s interim program, to examine what works under the program and
what can be improved, and to revisit the complex issue of chemical facility
security within three years to enact more comprehensive authorizing legislation
based on the Department’s experiences.

5

“The Department does not have broad discretion to regulate beyond the interim
three-year period without a comprehensive authorization from Congress.  Any
contrary interpretation of the ‘sunset’ provision is plainly wrong.”

For a full copy of Senator Collins’ formal comments, please visit:
http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/assets/binaries/collins-letter

We agree with Senator Collins 2006 and 2007 statements that CFATS is “NOT”
comprehensive and that the “interim” law was passed to give Congress time to enact
comprehensive legislation.  However, merely adopting an extension of the current law,
as Senator Collins suggests with the introduction of S. 2996, without incorporating
lessons learned and new authorities that DHS is requesting, as the House passed bill
(H.R. 2868) does, would in no way be comprehensive or responsible legislation.

The interim law has already been extended for one year until October 4, 2010. It would
be irresponsible to postpone action any longer on permanent, comprehensive legislation
that would eliminate catastrophic risks and close the gap on thousands of exempted
facilities such as ports and water treatment plants.

SMART SECURITY IS SAFER MANUFACTURING PROCESSES ELIMINATE THE
CONSEQUENCES OF AN ATTACK AND THEY ARE IN WIDESPREAD USE

In February 2008, the CEO of Association of American Railroads said, “It’s time for the
big chemical companies to do their part to help protect America. They should stop
manufacturing dangerous chemicals when safer substitutes are available.  And if
they won’t do it, Congress should do it for them….”

There are commercially available safer alternatives for virtually all of the poison gas or
toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) substances that pose the greatest risks to hundreds of urban
areas. The Center for American Progress (CAP) conducted an analysis of EPA’s Risk
Management Program data and identified 284 facilities that have converted since 1999.
See full report at:
http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2006/04/b681085_ct2556757.html

Examples of conversions from TIH chemicals and continuing threats include:

--- More than 550 water treatment facilities (including Washington, D.C.) converted to
safer alternatives such as ultraviolet light, eliminating the use of chlorine and sulfur
dioxide gas. At least 73 water treatment plants still threaten more than 100,000 people.

--- Ninety-eight petroleum refineries use safer alternatives to hydrogen fluoride (HF).
But 50 refineries still threaten millions of people with the use of HF.

--- At least 36 electric power plants use safer alternatives to anhydrous ammonia gas
such as dry urea. But 166 power plants still use anhydrous ammonia gas each
threatening an average of 21,506 people.

--- The Blue Plains sewage treatment plant (like more than 550 other water treatment
plants all over the US) in Washington, D.C. halted its use of chlorine and switched to
safer chemicals just eight weeks after the 9/11 attacks due to fears of another attack.
The plant had seven rail cars of chlorine on sight following the 9/11 attacks. The

6

conversion only cost approximately $0.50 per year for each water customer. In other
words, by using safer technologies we can neutralize and eliminate targeting by
terrorists and prevent catastrophic accidents as well at negligible costs.

--- In November 2009, the Clorox Company announced plans to convert all seven of its
U.S. facilities. This conversion will eliminate Clorox’s bulk use of chlorine gas and risks
to more than 13 million people in nearby communities.

--- In December 2008 Dow Chemical and K2 Pure Solutions announced an agreement in
which K2 Pure would supply Dow’s Pittsburgh, California facility with small quantities of
chlorine gas produced in just-in-time batches by K2 Pure, thus eliminating the risks
associated with bulk on-site storage and transport of chlorine gas.

This CAP analysis shows that 87% of the converted facilities spent less than $1 million
and one third expected to save money, particularly from reduced liability costs and
reduced regulation compliance costs. Clearly these conversion costs pale in comparison
to the cost of disaster response, relocating communities, defending against personal
injury law suits or resolving environmental clean up liability or even conventional security
costs.

While the CAP analysis also proves the feasibility of safer alternatives, CAP estimates
that at this rate of conversion, without any new regulatory requirements, it will take 45
years to eliminate hazards that pose the highest risk to America’s hometowns. A 2008
CAP analysis identified 300 chemical facilities that together put 110 Million Americans at
risk. The DHS needs the authority to prioritize the conversion of the highest risk plants
first.

A 2006 GAO report (GAO-06-150), Homeland Security DHS Is Taking Steps to Enhance
Security at Chemical Facilities, But Additional Authority Is Needed, concluded,
“Implementing inherently safer technologies potentially could lessen the consequences
of a terrorist attack by reducing the chemical risks present at facilities, thereby making
facilities less attractive targets.”

A Government Accountability Office report (GAO-05-165) identified chlorine gas and 90-
ton chlorine rail cars as "among the top five terrorist-related wastewater system
vulnerabilities." Among the top three recommendations: "Replacing gaseous chemicals
used in wastewater treatment with less hazardous alternatives." In addition, the largest
majority of experts gave replacing these chlorine facilities the highest priority for federal
funding.

The Benefits of Safer Technologies:

The use of safer technologies offers a more competitive and stable business plan with
fewer regulations, potentially zero liability, sustainable profitability, better relationships
with workers and neighboring communities and no threat of a catastrophic attack or
accident. Specifically, the use of safer technologies will likely result in a facility no longer
being subject to DHS’s CFATS regulations.

Obviously, chemical facilities located on site at nuclear power plants, water treatment
works, iconic facilities such as Disney World, Camp David, etc. also need to be
considered for priority protection. However, using safer technologies as a

7

countermeasure at these facilities will lessen the lethality that an attack on them would
pose. Given DHS’s finite resources and the late start the nation has in addressing
chemical security it is urgent that we use safer technologies to mitigate the consequence
of an attack. By doing so we eliminate risks, safeguard communities and save scarce
money and resources to protect targets that cannot be so neutralized (airports, U.S.
Capitol, etc.).

COMPREHENSIVE CHEMICAL SECURITY IS NEEDED

On June 21, 2006 then Senator Obama said, "But there is one thing we can all agree on:
any chemical plant security legislation must be comprehensive and rational.  It should
balance the need to keep us safe with the need to continue producing chemical products
that are essential to our economy.  I believe the IST approach needs to be a part of
rational comprehensive security legislation."

To truly protect employees and surrounding communities, a comprehensive law should:
1)  Use “smart security” to prevent the catastrophic consequences of an attack by
implementing cost-effective safer and more secure chemicals and processes at all of the
highest risk facilities.
2)  Include all categories of facilities such as port facilities and water treatment plants.
3)  Involve plant employees in developing plant security programs, including participation
in workplace inspections, and provide employees with both an appeals and a waiver
procedure to protect against excessive background checks.
4)  Allow citizen suits to enforce the law by chemical facilities and government agencies
and require reporting measures that strengthen accountability.
5)  Allow states to set more protective security standards.
6)  Require collaboration between the DHS, EPA and other agencies to avoid regulatory
redundancy or inconsistency.

To correct the flaws in the interim law and enact comprehensive legislation, we urge you
to support companion legislation in the Senate to legislation passed in the House of
Representatives on November 6, 2009, the “Chemical and Water Security Act of 2009”
(H.R. 2868).  H.R. 2868 is a compromise that builds seamlessly on CFATS.  It maintains
the DHS as the lead agency regulating privately owned chemical plants, including port
facilities, and authorizes the EPA as the lead agency regulating publicly owned water
and wastewater treatment facilities and provides funding for publicly owned water
facilities to adopt the most protective security measures.

While H.R. 2868 exempts more than 90 percent of distributors of agricultural fertilizers, it
also provides $3 million each year in compliance assistance grants to the very largest
wholesalers. In addition it makes no changes to the indefinite exemption that the DHS
has given to agricultural “end users.” (e.g. all farms and growers)  H.R. 2868 also
requires the DHS to assess the regulatory impacts on small businesses.

In addition H.R. 2868:
--- Requires high risk facilities to “assess” safer chemical processes and conditionally

8

requires the highest risk plants that pose a catastrophic gas release scenario
(approximately 107) to use safer chemical processes where feasible and commercially
available and includes a technical appeals process to challenge DHS decisions;
--- Provides up to $100 million in the first year to assist privately owned plants to use
safer and more secure processes, $125 million for drinking water facilities and an
unspecified portion of $200 million for wastewater facilities to use safer more secure
processes;
--- Involves plant employees in the development of security plans and provides
protections for whistleblowers and limits background check abuses;
--- Preserves state’s authority to establish stronger security standards;
--- Bars citizen suits against private facilities but allows suits against DHS to enforce
non-discretionary duties.

Greenpeace believes H.R. 2868 is a valuable piece of compromise legislation, and looks
forward to working with the members of this Committee and their staffs in passing
legislation at least as strong.

March 1, 2010

Dear Senator,

On November 6, 2009, the House of Representatives passed the Chemical and Water Security
Act of 2009 (H.R.2868) a comprehensive chemical security bill. The undersigned organizations
supported this legislation and would like to work with you to pass even more protective legislation
in the U.S. Senate this year before the interim law expires on October 4, 2010.

Chemical plants and other chemical facilities remain one of the most vulnerable sectors of
America’s infrastructure to terrorist attacks. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has
identified approximately 6,023 “high-risk” U.S. chemical facilities. In 2004, the Homeland Security
Council planning scenario projected that an attack on a chemical facility would kill 17,500 people
and send an additional 100,000 people to the hospital.  A December 2009 Congressional
Research Service review of EPA data shows that 91 chemical facilities each put 1 million or more
people at risk.

The current interim statute enacted as a rider to the 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill
temporarily authorized the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) to give Congress
time to enact comprehensive legislation.  As a security program CFATS was only an interim first
step.  It fails to protect the millions of Americans at risk by eliminating preventable catastrophic
hazards.

The interim statute:

a.  Prohibits the DHS from requiring any specific “security measure” whatsoever.
b.  Fails to develop the commonsense use of safer and more secure chemical

processes that can cost-effectively eliminate catastrophic hazards posed by poison
gas.

c.  Explicitly exempts thousands of chemical and port facilities, including approximately

2,400 water treatment facilities and 400-600 port facilities.

11

d.  Fails to involve knowledgeable employees in the development of vulnerability

assessments and security plans, or protect employees from excessive background
checks.

e.  Denies the public the information needed to ensure an effective, accountable

program.

On February 4th Senator Collins (R-ME) introduced a bill (S. 2996) that would do nothing but
extend this flawed law for five more years. We strongly oppose this bill and any further delay in
comprehensive chemical security legislation.  In fact, Senator Collins’ own comments to the DHS
in 2007 were clear. She said, “The Department does not have broad discretion to regulate
beyond the interim three-year period without a comprehensive authorization from Congress.  Any
contrary interpretation of the ‘sunset’ provision is plainly wrong.”

In their October 1st testimony before the House, both the DHS and the EPA called for
comprehensive legislation to include water treatment plants and port facilities as well as
conditional requirements to use safer available chemical processes where feasible at the highest
risk facilities.

To correct the flaws in the interim law and enact comprehensive legislation, we urge you to
support companion legislation in the Senate to H.R. 2868.  H.R. 2868 is a compromise that builds
seamlessly on CFATS.  It maintains the DHS as the lead agency regulating privately owned
chemical plants, including port facilities, and authorizes the EPA as the lead agency regulating
publicly owned water and wastewater treatment facilities and provides funding for publicly owned
water facilities to adopt the most protective security measures.

While H.R. 2868 exempts more than 90 percent of distributors of agricultural fertilizers, it also
provides $3 million each year in compliance assistance grants to the very largest wholesalers. In
addition it makes no changes to the indefinite exemption that the DHS has given to agricultural
“end users.” (e.g. all farms and growers)  H.R. 2868 also requires the DHS to assess the
regulatory impacts on small businesses.

In addition H.R. 2868:

-  Requires high risk facilities to “assess” safer chemical processes and conditionally requires
the highest risk plants (approximately 107) to use safer chemical processes where feasible
and commercially available and includes a technical appeals process to challenge DHS
decisions;

-  Provides up to $100 million in the first year to assist privately owned plants to use safer and

more secure processes, $125 million for drinking water facilities and an unspecified portion of
$200 million for wastewater facilities to use safer more secure processes;
Involves plant employees in the development of security plans and provides protections for
whistleblowers and limits back ground check abuses;

-

-  Preserves state’s authority to establish stronger security standards;
-  Bars citizen suits against private facilities but allows suits against DHS to enforce non-

discretionary duties.

Passing comprehensive legislation this year is vital to our national security. Since 1999, more
than 500 facilities have used “smart security” to eliminate these risks to more than 40 million
Americans. In a March 2006 floor statement, then Senator Obama said, "by employing safer
technologies, we can reduce the attractiveness of chemical plants as a target...Each one of these
methods reduces the danger that chemical plants pose to our communities and makes them less
appealing targets for terrorists." In November 2009, the Clorox Company announced plans to
convert all seven of its U.S. facilities to eliminate the bulk use of chlorine gas and inherent risks to
nearby communities.

12

The Association of American Railroads issued a statement in 2008 saying, “It’s time for the big
chemical companies to do their part to help protect America. They should stop manufacturing
dangerous chemicals when safer substitutes are available.  And if they won’t do it, Congress
should do it for them...”

To truly protect employees and surrounding communities, a comprehensive law should:

1)  Use “smart security” to prevent the catastrophic consequences of an attack by implementing
cost-effective safer and more secure chemicals and processes at all of the highest risk facilities.
2)  Include all categories of facilities such as port facilities and water treatment plants.
3)  Involve plant employees in developing plant security programs, including participation in
workplace inspections, and provide employees with both an appeals and a waiver procedure to
protect against excessive background checks.
4)  Allow citizen suits to enforce the law by chemical facilities and government agencies and
require reporting measures that strengthen accountability.
5)  Allow states to set more protective security standards.
6)  Require collaboration between the DHS, EPA and other agencies to avoid regulatory
redundancy or inconsistency.

We look forward to working with you and your staff on this urgently needed legislation.

The Clorox Company News Release

Clorox Announces Plans to Begin Transitioning U.S. Operations to High-Strength Bleach
OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 2, 2009 – The Clorox Company (NYSE: CLX) today
announced that it plans to modify manufacturing processes in its U.S. bleach
operations. The initiative calls for Clorox to begin transitioning from chlorine to
high-strength bleach as a raw material for making its namesake bleach.
“This decision was driven by our commitment to strengthen our operations and add
another layer of security,” said Chairman and CEO Don Knauss.
Clorox will start with its Fairfield, Calif., plant. The company expects to complete the
transition there within six months, followed by a phased, multiyear transition for six
additional plants.
“This process requires significant expertise, training, and changes in infrastructure and
equipment,” Knauss said. “Our plant-by-plant approach will also enable us to apply what we
learn along the way, ensure supply availability, minimize business disruptions and help
make sure the transition is undertaken in the most effective manner possible.”
“Clorox leads our industry in safety and security,” Knauss said. “Our bleach plant
employees are experts at handling chlorine, and we’re proud of the fact that we’ve used
it responsibly for our entire 96-year history. Even so, we’re pleased to begin
implementing this process change to make our products using high-strength bleach.”

Appendix C:

Chronology of Legislation on Chemical Security

1999:  Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ)  introduces S. 1470, The Chemical Security Act
of 1999.  In April 2000 he calls on Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) to hold hearings on the
bill which was never adopted.

October 31, 2001:  Senator Jon Corzine (D-NJ) introduces the "Chemical Security Act of
2001" (S. 1602), requiring chemical facilities to use safer available technologies where
available to prevent catastrophic attacks.

May 16, 2002:  An internal EPA briefing document entitled “Proposal for Chemical
Security  Legislation” says that new legislation is needed because security of industry
cannot be assured under current law.

June 11, 2002:  EPA proposes White House roll out of chemical security policy through
new guidance and regulations saying, "EPA is not seeking legislation on chemical
security at this time."  Guidance was to be issued in July 2002 along with an inspection
of 30 high-risk chemical facilities.

July 25, 2002:  The Senate EPW Committee unanimously adopts a compromise version
of Senator Jon Corzine’s (D-NJ) bill (S. 1602) to require safer technologies or chemicals
where available to prevent catastrophic attacks.

October 23, 2003:  The Senate EPW Committee adopts a flawed bill (S. 994) on a close
party-line vote.  The bill has no enforceable provision to prevent catastrophic attacks by
requiring safer technologies or chemicals and rubber stamps industry’s voluntary
programs and never makes it to the floor.

March 30, 2006:  Senators Lautenberg (D-NJ), Obama (D-IL),  Kerry (D-MA), Menendez
(NJ), Durbin (D-IL), Biden (D-DE) introduces a broad chemical security bill (S. 2486) that
requires  safer technologies when feasible at chemical plants, protects state authority to
adopt stronger protections, gives plant employees meaningful participation in security
programs and ensures a role for the EPA in oversight of facilities.

May 18,  2006:  Senators Biden (D-DE), Jeffords (I-VT) and Boxer (D-CA) introduce the
Community Water Treatment Hazards Reduction Act of 2006 (S. 2855) which requires
high risk water facilities to identify safer technologies to eliminate hazards posed by the
use of chlorine gas.  The bill also authorizes $125 million a year over five years in grants
to the highest risk facilities for capital costs needed to convert plants to safer
technologies, including ultra-violet light, ozone or bleach.

May 19, 2006:  Senator Inhofe, chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee,
schedules a Committee vote for May 23rd on his wastewater security  bill (S. 2781).  The
bill will squander millions of dollars on outdated security measures instead of funding the
elimination of hazards posed by chlorine gas through the use of safer technologies as
recommended by a 2005 Government Accountability Office report.

June 14-15 2006:  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
votes out  weak chemical security legislation (S. 2145).  Senator Voinovich (R-OH)

proposes 14 weakening amendments.  A Voinovich amendment to preempt states is
rejected by a 9 to 7 vote.  A Lieberman (D-CT) amendment to add cost-effective safer
technology requirements is rejected 11 to 5.

July 28, 2006:  House Homeland Security Committee completes mark up of H.R. 5695.
The Committee embraces a compromise requiring the use of safer technologies at high
priority facilities offered by Representative Markey (D-MA).  An amendment by
Representative James Langevin (D-RI) improves the right of state and local
governments to set stronger security standards but falls short of a similar provision in S.
2145.

September 25, 2006:  In a rush to show voters they have done “something”  the
Conference Committee on DHS Appropriations approved  a 740 word unenforceable 3
year chemical security amendment supported by the chemical industry.

October 4, 2006: President Bush signs temporary chemical security statute which will
expire in October 3, 2009.

June 12, 2007:  President Bush threatened to veto a Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) spending bill.  Among their objections was “strong” opposition to a chemical plant
security provision that would have restored the authority of states to set stronger security
standards at chemical plants than the federal government.  The chemical industry began
lobbying for federal preemption to overrule state authority in 2005 when New Jersey
announced stronger chemical security regulations.  The bill was vetoed and the
provision was eliminated in the final DHS spending bill.

December 27,  2007:  President Bush signs $500 billion omnibus spending that includes
an amendment by Senator Lautenberg  (D-NJ) to the DHS funding bill that will allow
states to set more stringent security standards.

March 6, 2008:  House Homeland Security Committee adopts H.R. 5577 which requires
high risk facilities to use safer more secure technologies as long as they are feasible,
cost effective and do not shift risks to other facilities.

June 15, 2009:  Representatives Bennie Thompson, (D-MS), Henry Waxman (D-CA),
Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-TX), Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced H.R. 2868 which is even
stronger than H.R. 5577.

June 23, 2009: House Homeland Security Committee rejects the most crippling
amendments but adopts several weakening amendments to H.R. 2868.

October 1, 2009: Homeland Security Department and EPA officials testified before
House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment calling for legislation that conditionally
requires the use of safer chemical processes at the highest risk chemical plants where
feasible and cost-effective.

October 21, 2009: House Energy & Commerce Committee rejects crippling amendments
and adopts a stronger version of H.R. 2868 on chemical plant security and also adopts
H.R. 3258 on drinking water plant security.  Both bills conditionally require the use of
safer chemical processes at the highest risk plants where feasible and cost-effective.

November 6, 2009:  In a vote of 230 to 193, the House of Representatives passed a
compromise bill, the Chemical and Water Security Act (H.R. 2868), which conditionally
requires the use of safer chemical processes at some of the highest risk facilities where
feasible and cost-effective.  The bill also puts the EPA in charge similar regulations over
publicly owned water treatment facilities.

Appendix D:

Q&A on the Inherently Safer Technology (IST) & Citizen Suits Provisions In "The
Chemical and Water Security Act of 2009” (H.R. 2868)

Does H.R. 2868 require ALL chemical facilities to adopt “methods to reduce the
consequences (MRC) of a terrorist attack” or inherently safer technology (IST)?

No. This requirement is conditional and covers a narrow universe of approximately 107
facilities in the highest-risk tiers (1&2) that pose a risk of catastrophic “release” to
densely populated areas.  It will NOT cover facilities in tiers 1&2 that pose a risk only
from chemical “theft.”

The conditions for implementing safer methods and technologies are:
***  They must significantly reduce the risk of death or injury in a terrorist attack
***  They must not shift risks to another location
***  They must be technically feasible
***  They must not impair the plant’s ability to do business at that location
***  Water treatment systems must also meet state and federal safe drinking water
standards

Can facilities challenge the requirement to implement safer chemical
technologies?

Yes.  All facilities must conduct a feasibility assessment of their ability to utilize safer
chemical technologies.  For those facilities subject to conditional requirements to
implement safer technologies in risk tiers 1 & 2 because they pose a catastrophic
“release” risk to nearby communities, they will also submit a feasibility assessment. If the
DHS disagrees with a facility’s assessment that they are NOT subject to the
implementation requirements, the facility has 120 days to appeal. In making a ruling on
the appeal, the DHS must consult a wide range of experts and must include those expert
opinions in their ruling.

Will H.R. 2868 burden farms and agricultural facilities?

No. In January of 2008 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) indefinitely
exempted all “end-users” of regulated chemicals used in agriculture, including family
farms, ranches and other crop, feed or livestock facilities from Chemical Facility Anti-
terrorism Standards (CFATS). 1   The new legislation does nothing to change DHS’s
regulatory deferral of these facilities.  In the agricultural sector, only manufacturers of
agricultural chemicals and large wholesalers remain in CFATS and only 7 of these
facilities are in risk tiers 1 or 2.  The rest are in tiers 3 and 4 and are only responsible for
assessing safer chemical processes.  In addition, Representatives Ross (D-AR) and
Space (D-OH) added an amendment to H.R. 2868 that requires the DHS to provide
assistance to agricultural chemical wholesalers, including technical assistance grants to
conduct assessments of safer technologies. It also requires the DHS to assess potential
impacts on the agriculture sector for complying with the new statute.

1 73 FR 1640 (January 9, 2008).

Will this requirement hurt jobs or the economy?

No. Plants that invest in the safety and security of their infrastructure invest in American
communities, reduce or eliminate their liability and regulatory costs, and improve
workplace safety and long term job security.  Major trade unions, such as the United
Steelworkers, United Auto Workers, International Chemical Workers/UFCW,
International Association of Fire Fighters, Teamsters, SEIU, AFSCME and
Communication Workers of America support H.R. 2868.

Does H.R. 2868 allow citizens to sue private parties to enforce the law?

No.  The compromise bill eliminates citizen enforcement suits against private parties.
Only suits against government agencies except the Department of Defense are
permitted.  The bill does, however, allow for a citizen petition process that can trigger a
government investigation into potential violations by a chemical facility.

Are water treatment facilities treated differently?

Yes. The EPA, not DHS, will have the lead authority in regulating drinking water AND
waste facilities. Drinking water systems that serve more than 3,300 people are covered,
smaller systems are exempt. Waste water systems serving approximately 25,000 or
more people are covered. The States have the lead authority to require the use of safer
chemical processes. Smaller water systems will also be eligible for technical assistance
to conduct assessments of safer technologies. The highest risk systems will be eligible
for assistance to implement safer technologies based on risk and need.  The bill makes
available $125 million a year for three years to assist implementation of safer
technologies for drinking water systems and $200 million a year for waste water
systems.

Can facilities save money by using safer and more secure chemical processes?

Yes, in some cases, and in other cases costs are manageable. Surveys by the Center
for American Progress identified 284 facilities that switched to safer methods since 1999.
They found that 87 percent spent less than $1 million, and one half reported spending
less than $100,000 on the conversion.  Additionally, 34% of facilities expected “cost
savings or improved profitability.” Twenty large city water utilities adopted safer and
more secure options at a maximum cost of $1.50 per customer per year – less than a
bag of potato chips – and often much less. Washington, D.C. converted its sewage
treatment plant within 90 days after the 9/11 attacks for less than $0.50 per water
customer per year. H.R. 2868 provides up to $225 million and H.R. 3258 provides up to
$375 million for assistance in implementing safer chemical processes over a three-year
period.

Will requiring the use of safer chemical processes shift risks locally or nationally?

No. H.R. 2868 specifically prohibits requirements that shift these risks to other facilities
in the U.S. or to facilities outside of the United States and prohibits EPA or states from
requiring facilities to adopt changes that shift chemicals to interim storage off-site.

Does H.R. 2868 mandate the use of specific technologies or can facilities choose
which safer and more secure technologies to use?

Each high-risk facility is free to choose the most appropriate “feasible” and cost-effective
technology or process identified in the facility’s own assessment.

Should government require safer design and technologies to be used in the
private sector?

Yes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has required airplane security and
safety standards for decades.  The feasibility and cost-effectiveness are balanced
against security and safety needs.  After 9/11 all commercial airliners were required to
harden cockpit doors and X-ray machines for airline baggage were installed at hundreds
of airports.

Are safer design requirements appropriate for security legislation?

Yes. In 2006 the GAO (GAO-06-150), concluded that “Implementing inherently safer
technologies potentially could lessen the consequences of a terrorist attack by reducing
the chemical risks present at facilities, thereby making facilities less attractive targets.”
And a June 2006 National Academy of Sciences study endorsed safer technologies as
"the most desirable solution to preventing chemical releases" from a terrorist attack.

In a February 27, 2008 statement the Association of American Railroads said, “It’s time
for the big chemical companies to do their part to help protect America. They should stop
manufacturing dangerous chemicals when safer substitutes are available.  And if they
won’t do it, Congress should do it for them in the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act
2008.”

Can different types of chemical facilities use safer methods to reduce the
consequences of risks at more than 6,000 regulated facilities?

Yes. Many types of facilities are among the 284 facilities that have already converted
since 1999.  Most facilities (89%) are “users” of chemicals rather than chemical makers.
These plants can often switch to safer methods even faster than chemical makers.

Types of facilities that are already using safer and more secure technologies include
bleach manufacturers, water utilities, petroleum refineries, paper mills, power plants, and
diverse manufacturers of products that include soaps and detergents, fuel additives, and
polyurethane foam.

Four substances account for 55 percent of the processes that pose a catastrophic risk to
communities according to the EPA.  These substances are chlorine, ammonia, hydrogen
fluoride and sulfur dioxide.  They are also among the hazards eliminated at 284 plants
that have converted since 1999.

Of the 238 chemical facilities that have already transitioned to safer chemicals or
technologies, "of respondents that provided cost estimates, roughly half reported
spending less than $100,000 to switch to safer alternatives and few spend over $1
million."
p.3

"Facilities cut a variety of costs and regulatory burdens by switching to less hazardous
chemicals or processes.  These facilities need fewer physical security and safety
measures and can better focus on producing valuable products and services"
 p.3

"Unfortunately, more than four years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the White House and
Congress have failed to act.   Currently, no federal law or regulation requires hazardous
chemical facilities to review or use readily available alternatives. "
p.4

"Many chemical facilities have already taken this step thereby protecting millions of
Americans.  Millions more could be taken out of harm's way within a concerted national
effort to convert other high-risk facilities to safer chemicals and processes."
p.4

"Numerous federal agencies and other observers have warned that terrorists could turn
hazardous chemical facilities into improvised weapons of mass destruction.  These
agencies include the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice,
Government Accountability Office, Environmental Protection Agency, Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry, Army Surgeon General, and Naval Research
Laboratory, among others."
p.6

"Some 284 respondents in 47 states reported they had switched to less acutely
hazardous chemicals or processes or moved to safer locations.  As a result, more than
38 million Americans no longer live under the threat of a harmful toxic gas release from

an off-site gas release...These manufactures represent diverse industries and made an
array of changes...  Notably, the majority of these facilities reported neutral costs or
anticipated cost savings from their changes."

"A catastrophic chemical release at just one of the nation's most dangerous facilities
could kill, injure or sicken tens of thousands.  Adopting less acutely hazardous chemicals
or processes is the only certain way to protect the public from a toxic gas cloud."
p.20

“Coined ‘inherently safer design’ by British chemical engineer Trevor Kletz in the late
1970s, the concept seems simple: It is better to design processes that eliminate
chemical plant hazards at the beginning than to engineer ‘add-on’ technologies later to
try to control them.”
p.1/9

“Kletz, who is retired after 38 years with ICI [Imperial Chemical Industries], puts it like
this, ‘The very best way to prevent an explosion is to simply replace the material that
explodes with one that does not or at least keep the stock down so low that it hardly
matters if it all leaks out.’”

experience say industry, academia, and government should do much more to encourage
the spread of what may ultimately be the safest, cheapest way to make chemicals.”

“’In many companies, the gut reaction to an accident is to reroute procedures,’ he [Kletz]

"...In many cases, alternative production processes do exist...  We know that when
chlorine is used as a feedstock in a manufacturing process, one cannot necessarily
predict or control which chlorinated organics will result, and in what quantity.
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the use of chlorine and its compounds
should be avoided in the manufacturing process.  We recognize that socio-economic
and other consequences of banning the use of chlorine--and subsequent use of
alternative chemicals or processes--must be considered in determining the timetable."
p.29

"The Commission also recognizes that certain other uses of chlorine are of special
concern because of the overwhelming public health benefits from their use.  Disinfection
of drinking water and sewage (as well as production of certain pharmaceuticals) are
uses for which public health has been protected and for which, it is claimed, there are
limited or no alternatives.  Yet, there is evidence that chlorinated organics are created in

estimates, that it was conceivable that as many as 2.4 million people could request
medical treatment if a terrorist caused a release of a toxic chemical.”

“While industry recognizes the contribution that inherently safer technologies can make
to reducing the risk of a terrorist attack, industry officials noted that decisions about
inherently safer technologies require thorough analysis.”

“While some attention has focused on the potential for terrorists to use chemicals to
build chemical weapons, national security experts have asserted that the enormous
complexity of creating a chemical weapon makes such a scenario less likely than an

provide relatively easy access to chemicals at locations from which a significant
chemical release could harm large numbers of people. Amy Smithson, director of the
Chemical and Biological Weapons Non-Proliferation Project at the Henry L. Stimson
Center, testified in a House of Representatives committee hearing:

‘Although assembling from scratch an unconventional weapons capability that could
cause mass casualties is not that elementary, there are tangible routes whereby
terrorists could inflict considerable harm with chemical and biological substances. One

shortcut involves foul play with industrial chemicals….  Logic dictates that if the same
result [mass casualties from a chemical release] can be achieved through a less
arduous route, terrorists intent on causing mass casualties with chemicals would
probably engineer the intentional release of industrial chemicals rather than wrestle with
the complexities of making large quantities of the classic chemical warfare agents.’”

“As hard as it is to believe, the chemical industry has refused to take adequate
precautions to safeguard its facilities and surrounding communities. Some plants have
strengthened on-site security by adding guards, building fences or installing surveillance
cameras. Others have committed to reducing or phasing out their use of highly
hazardous processes or chemicals in favor of safer ones. Unfortunately, however, it is
still business as usual at most plants. They continue to deal with high volumes of
dangerous chemicals -- even when safer materials or processes are readily available.
That is why the government must require industry cooperation in homeland security.”

“But there are other ways to reduce risk that need to be part of the equation.
Specifically, by employing safer technologies, we can reduce the attractiveness of
chemical plants as a target.
This concept, known as Inherently Safer Technology, involves methods such as
changing the flow of chemical processes to avoid dangerous chemical byproducts,

reducing the pressures or temperatures of chemical reactions to minimize the risk of
explosions, reducing inventories of dangerous chemicals and replacing dangerous
chemicals with benign ones.  Each of these methods reduces the danger that chemical
plants pose to our communities and make them less appealing targets for terrorists.”

Statement at Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing
June 21, 2006

“For instance, we've heard that IST is in "the early stages of development," even though
it's been used in the chemical industry for nearly 30 years.  Saying IST is in its infancy is
a little like saying the personal computer is in its infancy.”

“We've heard that IST is an environmental issue, not a security one, even though the
Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, and even the American Chemistry
Council have embraced IST as part of chemical plant security in the past.  And most
recently, a National Academy of Sciences study, commissioned by DHS, endorsed the
adoption of IST as "the most desirable solution to preventing chemical releases" from
terrorist attack.  Time and again, experts have agreed that IST is the most effective
approach to eliminating terrorist threats at chemical facilities.”

“…But there is one thing we can all agree on: any chemical plant security legislation
must be comprehensive and rational.  It should balance the need to keep us safe with
the need to continue producing chemical products that are essential to our economy.  I
believe the IST approach needs to be a part of rational comprehensive security
legislation.”

a major chemical facility in a major metropolitan area go up and there'd be hell to pay
politically," says Rudman. "People will say, 'Well, didn't we know that this existed?' Of
course, we knew."

To:

Honorable Edward Markey
   Attention: Michal Freedhoff

From:

Dana A. Shea, Specialist in Science and Technology Policy, x7-6844

Subject:

RMP Facilities in the United States as of December 2009

December 11, 2009

This memorandum responds to your request regarding facilities submitting risk management plans
(RMPs) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). You requested an analysis of RMP facilities
within the United States by potentially affected population. You also requested an analysis of facilities
that were required by regulation to resubmit their information to the EPA but had not done so.

Under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r), the EPA established a program requiring facilities possessing
greater than certain threshold quantities of 140 chemicals to provide risk management plans to the EPA.1
As part of this reporting requirement, facilities are required to determine the worst-case scenario release
from a single chemical process, using EPA criteria and guidelines.2 Facilities are also required to estimate
the population potentially at risk from this worst-case scenario release by calculating the population that
resides within a circle surrounding the facility. The distance the worst-case scenario release might travel
determines the radius of the circle.3

The population potentially affected under an EPA worst-case scenario release is calculated in a circle
around the facility. In the event of an actual catastrophic chemical release, meteorological effects would
determine the direction of the release and therefore those potentially affected. Furthermore, how such a
release would affect those exposed would vary depending on many factors, such as the demographics of
the population and the surrounding geography and weather. In addition, worst-case scenarios do not take
into account emergency response measures that facility operators or others might take to mitigate harm.
Therefore, it is unlikely that this entire population would be affected by any single chemical release, even
if it is a result of a worst-case accident.

Facilities may register and deregister from the RMP program as their chemical processes and the amounts
of chemicals they store and use change. If a facility no longer possesses a regulated chemical above the

1 The list of 140 chemicals, including 77 toxic and 63 flammable chemicals, and their threshold quantities is found at 40 CFR
68.130.
2 The criteria and guidelines for determining the worst-case scenario release are found at 40 CFR 68.25. Some facilities have
submitted information on multiple worst-case scenario releases.
3 This requirement is found at 40 CFR 68.30. The criteria for determining the distance a worst-case scenario release might travel
are found at 40 CFR 68.22.

threshold quantity, it is required to inform the EPA and deregister from the program.4 Facilities are
required to review and update their RMP plans filed with the EPA at least once every five years.5 For the
purposes of this memorandum, facilities that have not reviewed and updated their RMP plan within five
years of their submission will be termed facilities with overdue updates. The deadline for submissions
under the RMP program was June 21, 1999.6 The EPA maintains this information in the RMP*National
Database.

In 1999, Congress passed the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act
(CSISSFRRA).7 This act removes from RMP program coverage any flammable fuel used as fuel or held
for sale as fuel by a retail facility. In implementing this act, the EPA allowed facilities that had previously
filed under the RMP program the options of withdrawing from the program, which would delete the
information from the EPA database, or taking no further action, which would leave the information in the
EPA database as a voluntary submission.8 Facilities exempted under CSISSFRRA that voluntarily
submitted information are not required to update these submissions.

The data available in the RMP*National Database is not sufficient to determine the full scope of actual
compliance or noncompliance with the RMP program. Facilities that were required to, but did not, submit
an RMP plan to the EPA would not be present in the RMP*National Database, but would be out of
compliance with the RMP program. As a result of the EPA’s implementation of CSISSFRRA, some
entries in the EPA database that have not been updated within the five year requirement are likely to be
facilities falling under CSISSFRRA that opted to take no action. These facilities are not identified as such
in the RMP*National Database.9 Thus, the number of facilities identified in this memorandum as having
overdue updates is likely not equal to the total number of facilities not complying with the RMP program.

At your request, CRS has searched the December 2009 update of the EPA RMP*National Database (with
off-site consequence analysis (OCA) data) for facilities that have registered under the RMP program.
Facilities that have deregistered from the RMP program were excluded. You requested that the facilities
be classified by state according to the population potentially affected by a worst-case release, according to
the EPA worst-case scenario criteria, using thresholds of 1,000 people, 10,000 people, 100,000 people,
and 1,000,000 people. Additionally, you requested that facilities with overdue RMP updates be identified
for each population category. Facilities with an RMP filing due to be updated by December 1, 2009, that
had not been updated were considered overdue for the purposes of this analysis. These facilities include
CSISSFRRA-exempted facilities as well as facilities that are covered by the regulation. All of the
information in this memorandum is drawn from the EPA RMP*National Database (with off-site
consequence analysis (OCA) data). This information is presented in Table 1.

Since facilities may register and deregister from the RMP program as chemical processes and amounts of
chemicals stored and used change, the number of facilities listed in Table 1 should be considered as
illustrative of the current industry profile, rather than absolute.

4 This requirement is found at 40 CFR 68.190. Facilities must deregister from the program within six months.
5 This requirement is found at 40 CFR 68.36. Facilities not excluded by the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels
Regulatory Relief Act (P.L. 106-40) that do not review and update the RMP plan are not in compliance with the RMP regulation.
They may be subject to enforcement actions by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, Section 113.

December 1, 2009.

Notes: Facilities due to update their RMP filing by December 1, 2009, that had not done so are categorized as “update
overdue.” Some of those facilities may be exempted from regulation by CSISSFRRA. In cases where facilities report
multiple worst-case scenario releases, the worst-case scenario potentially affecting the most people has been considered.

You also requested that facilities with overdue RMP updates be classified by EPA region according to the
population criteria described above. The EPA has ten regional offices, each of which is responsible for
several states and, in some cases, territories.10 This information is provided in Table 2.

Source: CRS analysis of the EPA RMP*National Database (with off-site consequence analysis (OCA) data), updated
December 1, 2009.

Notes: Facilities due to update their RMP filing by December 1, 2009, that had not done so were considered as “update
overdue.” Some of those facilities may be exempted from regulation by CSISSFRRA. In cases where facilities report
multiple worst-case scenario releases, the worst-case scenario potentially affecting the most people has been considered.

Facilities might not review and update their filed RMP plans for several reasons: the facility is out of
regulatory compliance; the facility is no longer in business; the facility has reduced the amount of
reportable chemical to below threshold levels, but neglected to inform the EPA; or the facility falls under
CSISSFRRA and is no longer covered by the RMP requirement. Any user of this data should use caution
when drawing further conclusions from this analysis.

memorandum, please contact me at 7-6844.

power plants could eliminate or significantly reduce dangers that accidents or acts of
terrorism pose to surrounding communities.”
p.7

“Agencies that have issued such warnings include the Department of Homeland
Security, Department of Justice, Environmental Protection Agency, General Accounting
Office, Congressional Research Service, Agency for Toxic Substances an Disease
Registry, Naval Research Laboratory, and Army Surgeon General.”  … (list continues)

“The power industry should curtail unnecessary dangers by: converting high hazard
power plants in populated areas to readily available safer alternatives to anhydrous
ammonia and chlorine gas.”
