PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO STRIKE DECLARATIONS ATTACHED TO
DEFENDANTS’ REPLY MEMORANDUM AND PORTIONS OF DEFENDANTS’
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND REPLY MEMORANDUM.

Plaintiffs hereby move to strike declarations attached to the Defendants’ Reply to

36

Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, and portions of

37

Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Reply Memorandum.  Specifically, Plaintiffs

38

move to strike the: (1) Declaration of Thomas Schehl; (2) Declaration of James Mahoney; and

39

(3) Declaration of Dr. David R. Legates.  In addition, Plaintiffs move to fact-dependant

arguments in Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment and Reply Memorandum, including

Defendants’ standing and finality arguments.

I.

Defendants’ New Affidavits are Not Material to this Court Inquiry and
Should be Struck as Extra-Record Evidence Offering a Post-Hoc
Rationale.

In response to Plaintiffs’ Opposition, Defendants now rely on three new affidavits in a

last-minute effort to contest Plaintiffs’ standing.  See Declaration of Thomas Schehl (Att. A to

Def. Reply); Declaration of James Mahoney (Att. B to Def. Reply); Declaration of Dr. David

10

Legates (Att. C to Def. Reply).  These most recent affidavits are immaterial to the Court’s

11

inquiry at this stage of litigation and are interposed as a back-door method of providing a new

12

agency rationale separate from, and in conflict with, the agencies’ own determinations on the

13

Record.  They should be struck.

14

Both the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have made clear that, for purposes of

15

summary judgment, facts averred by the Plaintiff with respect to standing must be taken as true.

16

Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (in response to a summary judgment

17

motion challenging a plaintiff’s standing to bring suit the plaintiff need only “set forth by

18

affidavit or other evidence ‘specific facts’ . . . which for purposes of the summary judgment

19

motion will be taken to be true.”); Alaska Wildlife Alliance v. Jensen, 108 F.3d 1065, 1068-69

20

(9th Cir. 1997) (“At the summary judgment stage, factual allegations in support of standing are

21

taken as true.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  Plaintiffs need only plead facts that, taken as true, would

22

show that [government authorized activity] caused their injuries.”).  Plaintiffs in this case have

23

set forth specific facts relevant to their standing, see Pls.’ Exhs. 1-16, and for the purposes of

24

Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, these facts must be taken to be true.  Lujan

U.S. at 561.  Defendants’ most recent declarations contesting facts averred by Plaintiffs thus are

not material to the Court’s consideration of the Defendants’ motion for Summary Judgment.

Furthermore, Defendants’ new affidavits are nothing more than an attempt to provide a

new rationale for the agencies’ failure to comply with NEPA.  Judicial review of an agency

decision is limited to the administrative record in existence at the time of the decision and does

not include any part of the record that is made initially in the reviewing court.  Camp v. Pitts, 411

U.S. 138, 142 (1973).  Extra-record evidence may only be considered under limited

circumstances – none of which are claimed by the Defendants.  See Southwest Ctr. for Biological

Diversity v. United States Forest Serv., 100 F.3d 1443, 1450 (9th Cir. 1996).  Thus, the agency

10

may not advance new rationalization for sustaining its action.  Id.

we emphasize[ ] a simple but fundamental rule of administrative law.  That
rule is to the effect that a reviewing court, in dealing with a determination or
judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make, must
judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the
agency.  If those grounds are inadequate or improper, the court is powerless
to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a
more adequate or proper basis.  To do so would propel the court into the
domain which Congress has set aside exclusively for the administrative
agency.

SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).

The Records here fully support Plaintiffs’ claims: the agencies concluded that increased

23

greenhouse gas emissions were a reasonably foreseeable impact of their actions; they concluded

24

that anthropomorphic greenhouse gas emissions could contribute to global warming; and they

25

concluded that global warming could result in a series of significant impacts, including those

26

now alleged by the Plaintiffs.  See generally Ex-Im Bank’s Role in Greenhouse Gas Emissions

27

and Climate Change and OPIC’s Climate Change: Assessing Our Actions.  The agencies’ only

rationale for not conducting any NEPA analysis was that their contribution to global warming

was insignificant.  Id.

Dr. Legates’ affidavit is extra-record evidence that offers a post-hoc rationale that is

inconsistent with the agencies’ conclusions in the Administrative Record, and it must be struck.

Chenery, 332 U.S. at 196.  Defendants have affirmatively argued to this Court that the current

matter is a “record review” case, and likewise have affirmatively argued that expert testimony

outside the record is inappropriate.1  Yet now, when forced to confront their own Record

conclusions that increased GHG emissions are a reasonably foreseeable impact of their actions,

that such emissions contribute to global climate change, and that climate change may result in

10

the type of impacts alleged by Plaintiffs, Defendants are scrambling to substitute their record

11

with expert testimony that actually contradicts their own conclusions. 2  Defendants may not

1 Attorney Navaro stated at hearing on the Government’s Motion for Change in Venue

that:

[b]oth the Expert/Import (sic) Bank and the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation considered CO2 emissions from relevant projects, and, in fact,
both have looked at climate change implications, and both have determined
that their contribution, or the arguable contribution of projects in which they
are involved, of CO2 has a negligible impact on climate and therefore would
have no Domestic Impact.  So there is an administrative record that contains
all that consideration and that would be the evidence and there would be no
need in this situation for experts.

Transcript of Proceedings at 27 (April 4, 2003) (emphasis added) (Att. A) [hereinafter
“Transcript of Proceedings”].

2 For example, while Dr. Legates now suggests that the role of anthropomorphic carbon

emissions contribution to climate change is “uncertain,” the agencies, in fact, expressed a
different opinion.  See, e.g., OPIC’s Assessing our Actions Report at 7 (“there is a strong and
growing scientific consensus that these steady additions of GHGs have tipped a delicate balance
and begun to impact our climate and may be the dominant force driving recent warming
trends.”); id. at 49 (“Climate change represents a serious global environmental challenge.  Since
the dawn of the industrial age, man has been emitting increasing quantities of heat-absorbing
GHGs primarily through the combustion of fossil fuels.  As a result, atmospheric concentrations
of CO2 – the most important GHG – are now at their highest levels in more than 160,000 years

withhold their determinations on the Record from this Court, and substitute those determinations

with a new rationale.

3

Defendants also rely on two affidavits from agency personnel purporting to offer an

alternative method of accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from projects financed,

insured, or otherwise financially supported by Ex-Im and OPIC.  See Declaration of Thomas

Schehl (Att. A to Def. Reply); Declaration of James Mahoney (Att. B to Def. Reply).  As with

and global temperatures are rising.  With emissions of CO2 and other GHGs expected to increase
– especially in developing regions – current forecasts suggest that atmospheric concentrations of
CO2 could double by 2060 with a resulting global average temperature increase of as much as 2º
to 6.5º F over the next century.  Such rapid temperature increase could have potentially grave
economic and environmental impacts.”); see also, Ex-Im Banks’ Our Role in Greenhouse Gas
Emissions and Climate Change Report at 3 (“available data would suggest that the increase in
GHG, caused predominately by the anthroprogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), has begun to trap additional heat
within the atmosphere, due to the associated altering of the energy balance of the atmosphere.”);
id. at 4 (“the information presented … leads one to conclude that GHG concentrations have
indeed risen and that there is a reasonable likelihood that the increased concentrations of these
gases will result in increased average global temperatures during the coming decades.”).

3 The Government suggests that the Court need not consider the Record in its inquiry into

Plaintiffs’ standing.  Def. Opp’n to Pls’ Mot. to Strike at 2, 6-7.  Case law, however, does not
support this position.  As explained further in Plaintiffs’ Reply to Defendant’s Opp’n to
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike, courts quite clearly begin an analysis of standing with the Record
produced by the agency.  See Seattle Audubon Soc'y v. Espy, 998 F.2d 699, 703 (9th Cir. 1993)
(“In short, our review of the record supports the district court's conclusion that [plaintiff] has
standing to challenge the Forest Service's action.”) (emphasis added); Sierra Club v. EPA, 352
U.S. App. D.C. 191 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (noting that a court’s assessment of standing is “based upon
the application of [the plaintiff’s] legal theory to facts established by evidence in the record.
Consistent with Defenders of Wildlife, therefore, the [plaintiff] must either identify in that record
evidence sufficient to support its standing to seek review or, if there is none because standing
was not an issue before the agency, submit additional evidence…”); see also Sierra Club v.
Patterson, 185 F.3d 349, 365-366 (5th Cir. 1999) (finding that where no agency record actually
existed, district court’s decision to develop a factual record to consider standing issues was not
an abuse of discretion), rev’d & vacated on other grounds en banc, 228 F.3d 589 (5th Cir. 1999).
Here, Defendants affirmatively argue that each agency has a Record embodying each agency’s
consideration of climate change.  See Transcript of Proceedings at 27-28, 30 (April 4, 2003)
(Att.A).  The standing inquiry, therefore, must begin with that Record – and the Court should
strike Defendants’ extra-record evidence because Defendants have not filed the Administrative
Record or even attempted to demonstrate that it needs to be supplemented.

Dr. Legates’ declaration, both Mr. Schehl’s and Mr. Mahoney’s declarations should be struck.

The agencies’ Records document their analysis of direct greenhouse gas emissions – an analysis

that more than adequately supports Plaintiffs’ reasonable concerns over each agencies’

contribution to climate change, even without an accounting of indirect impacts as required by

NEPA.  See Central Delta Water Agency v. United States, 306 F.3d 938, 947-48 (9th Cir. 2002)

(concluding that plaintiffs successfully alleged a credible threat of future injury based, in part, on

the fact that the government’s own studies confirmed plaintiff’s allegations); 40 C.F.R. § 1508.8

(requiring consideration of indirect effects such as downstream GHG emissions); see also Border

Power Plant Working Group v. DOE, 260 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1015 (S.D. Cal. 2003) (evaluation of

10

proposed power line on U.S./Mexico border violated NEPA because, among other things, the

11

Department of Energy failed to consider the indirect greenhouse gas emissions of a 500 MW

12

gas-turbine power plant located in Mexico that would be connected to the power line).  To the

13

extent that the methodology and results offered by the Schehl and Mahoney declarations differ

14

from each agency’s determination in their respective Administrative Records, they must be

15

struck.  Defendants cannot use standing to ignore their Administrative Records and offer a post-

16

hoc rationale.

arguments because they refuse to provide the Court the administrative record, and now

remarkably assert that the Record provided to Plaintiffs may not be appropriate.

5  Def. Opp’n to

Pls’ Mot. to Strike at 2 & 6, n. 2 &7.  Simply put, the Defendant agencies cannot characterize

their actions as not contributing to climate change or not final, but refuse to provide the

administrative record – the basic evidence on which such arguments must be founded.  As

explained above and in Plaintiffs’ Surreply, the Administrative Record is the starting point of

such inquiries.

“Where justice and fair play require it, estoppel will be applied against the government.”

Watkins v. United States Army, 875 F.2d 699, 706-707 (9th Cir. 1989) (quotations and citations

10

omitted).  Estoppel is appropriate when: (1) the party to be estopped knows the facts; (2) the

11

party intends that his or her conduct will be acted on; (3) the claimant must be ignorant of the

12

true facts; (4) and the claimant must detrimentally rely on the other party's conduct.  Id.;

13

Salgado-Diaz v. Gonzales, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 4015 (9th Cir. 2005).  Two additional

14

elements must be met to estop government.  First, “affirmative misconduct going beyond mere

15

negligence” must be established.  Watkins, 875 F.2d at 707.  Second, the government's wrongful

16

act will cause a serious injustice, and the public's interest will not suffer undue damage.  Id.

17

First addressing estoppel against government, there is no dispute that Defendants are

18

purposefully withholding the Administrative Record despite the fact that Local Rules require its

19

filing.  Letter from Ann D. Navaro, Esq. to Ronald A. Shems (December 30, 2004) (Att. B); Civil

20

record, within 90 days of receipt of service of the summons and complaint”) (emphasis added).

And only after Defendants’ realization that the Administrative Record amply supports Plaintiffs’

claims (and nearly two years after its April 29, 2003, transmission to Plaintiffs), did Defendants

assert that it may be inadequate.  Def. Opp’n to Pls’ Mot. to Strike at 2 & 6, n. 2 & 7.  Until this

point, Defendants strenuously asserted that the Defendant agencies had developed

comprehensive administrative records.  See Transcript of Proceedings at 27-28, 30.

Plaintiffs will suffer injustice if Defendants’ post-hoc rationale is considered in lieu of the

record.  See Chenery, 332 U.S. at 196 (post-hoc rationale may not be used to support agency

decision).  Any finality determination necessarily starts with the record.  Northcoast Env. Ctr v.

10

Glickman, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22845 (N.D. Ca. 1996) (“It is not necessary to go beyond the

11

administrative record submitted by defendants to determine whether the POC Program

12

constitutes final agency action.”) aff’d Northcoast Envtl. Ctr. v. Glickman, 136 F.3d 660, 665

13

(9th Cir. 1998) (District Court properly struck extra-record evidence and determined finality only

14

on administrative record); Northwest Resource Inf. Ctr. v. P.U.D. No. 2, 25 F.3d 872, 874-75

15

(9th Cir. 1994) (“Only where what petitioner challenged was not a final agency action based

16

upon an administrative record have we found against jurisdiction in this court.”) (emphasis

17

added).  The public interest is also served by following established norms for public-interest

18

litigation.

19

The traditional elements of estoppel are also met.  First, the Defendants know the facts.

20

They hold the record and admit that they are responsible for its certification.  Def. Opp’n to Pls’

21

Mot. to Strike at 2, n.2.  Second, Defendants intended their conduct to be acted on.  They

22

produced an administrative record and affirmatively stated that it would be adequate to guide this

23

matter.  Transcript of Proceedings at 28 (“but given what I expect the contents of the record will

be that Mr. Shems will have in just a couple of weeks, I don’t expect that [extra-record evidence]

would be necessary.”).  Indeed, it is entirely expected that NEPA litigants rely on an

administrative record.  Third, only Defendants know why the Record they produced may be

inadequate.  Plaintiffs have not objected to it.

Fourth, Plaintiffs rely extensively of the Administrative Record.  Indeed, the Record

memorializes Defendants’ assessment (or lack thereof) of their contributions to climate change.

Likewise, Defendants concede that any determination of final agency action is dependent on “the

character of the underlying action.”  Def. Reply at 12.  The Administrative Record embodies the

underlying action.  Reliance on the Record would be detrimental to Plaintiffs if Defendants

10

withhold the Record and Defendants’ post-hoc rationale is instead considered by the Court.

III.

Conclusion.

This Motion to Strike should be granted for the above reasons.
