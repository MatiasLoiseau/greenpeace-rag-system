fact: investing
in wind power
is far more
profitable than
investing in
nuclear power

Introduction

Greenpeace has calculated the Net Present Value (NPV) of an
investment in a new nuclear power plant in the Netherlands
using a methodology developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers for
the report ‘A financial and economic comparison of coal, gas
and wind options for Dutch electricity generation’1. The results of
Greenpeace’s calculations show that losses can be as high as
€3 million per installed MW capacity and are highly dependent
on market electricity prices and investment costs.

PwC calculated for Greenpeace the NPV of an investment in a
new coal-fired power plant, gas-fired power plant and wind park
in the Netherlands. Investing in a coal-fired power plant would
lead to losses of €250,000 per MW; investing in a gas-fired
power plant is profitable (NPV of €7,000/MW)2; the NPV of wind
power is slightly negative (-€37 000 per MW)

The climate crisis has provided the nuclear industry with a new
argument in promoting nuclear power plants. CO2 emissions
from nuclear power are limited, and so it is presented as a
‘clean’ source of energy. However, nuclear power plants are the
source of various forms of radioactive pollution and therefore
never clean. As this report shows, alongside the problem of
nuclear waste and the safety of nuclear power plants that can
never be guaranteed, the costs of nuclear power are so high
that - without a set of governmental subsidies and guarantees -
a company would have no interest in investing in new nuclear
power capacity.

Methodology

Defining the Net Present Value (NPV) of an investment is a way
to determine the current value of money that is invested in
long-term projects. A positive NPV means that the return on
an investment is higher than the required rate of return. An
investment with a positive NPV is therefore profitable in the
long term. A negative NPV means that the investment will lead
to losses in the future and should therefore be rejected.

The (NPV) of an investment in a new nuclear power plant
in the Netherlands was determined using a methodology
developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers – referred to herein
as the ‘PwC-2008’.

Three scenarios were developed to cover the range in data found for
the various parameters. The three scenarios are based on data
retrieved from three studies on nuclear economics, by Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT, 2003)3, Moody's Investors Service4
(2008) and The Keystone Centre5 (2007) respectively. These studies
were selected as they represent the view of an academic technology
institute, a corporate finance institute, and an independent not-for-
profit organisation. Steve Thomas, professor in Energy Policy at the
Public Services International Research Unit (PSIRU) of the Business
School of the University of Greenwich has verified that the data used
by these studies has been accurately transcribed to the model.

The NPV was determined by generating cash flows until 2030, which
were subsequently discounted to obtain a NPV for the investment in
2007. The NPV answers the question of how much cash an investor
would need to have today as a substitute for making the investment.
If the NPV is positive, the investment is worth taking on because
doing so is essentially the same as receiving a cash payment now
equal to the NPV. If the NPV is negative, taking on the investment
today is equivalent to giving up some cash today.

The results of the calculations are presented in figure 1. The NPV of
the investment in nuclear power is only positive (€395,000 / MW) in
the MIT scenario. The Keystone and Moody’s scenarios show highly
unprofitable investments (€829,000 loss per MW and €2,976,000 loss
per MW, respectively).

For the discounting of the cash flows, the same cost of capital
(WACC) was used as in PwC-2008 on investments in coal, gas or
wind power. This assumption does not take into account that the risk
factor for investment in nuclear power plants is considered higher
than that of the other investment options. The discount rate used was
5.28%, based on the assumption that the power plant is financed
with 30% debt and 70% equity. The cost of debt was set at a pre-tax
rate of 7% while a post-tax nominal equity rate of 12.2% was used.
The nominal post-tax WACC with these assumptions is 7.31%. The
assumed inflation rate was 2% resulting in a real post-tax WACC of
5.21%11.

Electricity prices

IPA, an economic consultant in infrastructure, provided electricity
prices for the Dutch electricity sector for the period 2007-2030. The
electricity price in 2008 is assumed to be between €59.2 and €64.1 /
MWh and changes to values between €42.4 and €65.1 / MWh in
2030. The low scenario (in line with the nuclear MIT scenario)
assumes a decrease of the electricity price to €42.4 / MWh, the base
scenario (in line with Keystone) assumes a decrease to €53.7 / MWh
and the high scenario (in line with Moody’s) assumes an increase to
€65.1 / MWh.

The investment costs for new build nuclear capacity are a very
uncertain yet decisive factor in the total costs of nuclear power.
In this study, values are used ranging from €1,674 / kW installed
capacity to €5,241 / kW. Recently, investment costs for a new build
have increased sharply, making the assumptions of the 2003 MIT
study outdated. More recent experiences with the construction of
new nuclear power plants show investment costs closer to the
Moody’s scenario than the MIT scenario. The costs for the new
European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) currently under construction
in Olkiluoto, Finland, have risen to almost €3,000 / kW12 and are
expected to increase even further. EDF, the French constructor of
the EPR, declared that the costs of future EPRs will be as high as
€4,000 / kW13.

Figure 2 shows the effect of different investment costs assumptions
on the NPV of an investment in nuclear power. Nuclear power
becomes a profitable investment if investment costs are below
€1,034 / kW for the Moody’s scenario, below €1,470 / kW for the
Keystone scenario and below €2,030 / kW for the MIT scenario.

Figure 2 NPV of investment in nuclear power in the
Netherlands with different investment costs

The capital costs of the investment in nuclear power are annualised
using an annuity method. It is assumed that, after the power plant is
depreciated, a new one is built with exactly the same real costs as in
2007. Therefore, in this model a longer lifetime does not influence the
profitability of the nuclear power plant. However, a longer depreciation
time does make a plant more profitable.

The Moody’s study uses a depreciation period of 50 years. Both the
MIT and the Keystone study choose an accelerated depreciation time
of 15 years. Changing the depreciation period to 50 years in the
Keystone scenario would bring the NPV just out of the red figures; in
the MIT scenario the NPV would increase threefold. However, in a
liberalised competitive energy market such as Europe, a 15-year
depreciation period is very reasonable, while a 50-year depreciation
period will only be reasonable for a government-controlled energy
market. Figure 3 shows the effect of different depreciation periods on
the NPV of the investment.

Hidden costs of nuclear power

Electricity price

Insurance of nuclear power plants not included

Sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential factor on the NPV
is the market electricity price, as this price determines the income of
the power plant. Market electricity prices are hard to predict and
therefore often debated. IPA assumes a conservative electricity price
development. An increase in market electricity prices will benefit the
investors of a nuclear power plant. Figure 4 shows the effect of a
change in the electricity price on the NPV of investing in nuclear
power in the Netherlands.

In order to be profitable, the wholesale electricity price should be
higher than €43 / MWh in the MIT scenario, €70 / MWh in the
Keystone scenario and €100 / MWh in the Moody’s scenario. Energy
prices in the Netherlands are, at time of writing, around €60 / MWh,
meaning that only under the MIT scenario, which includes
unreasonable low assumptions on investment costs, could a nuclear
power plant make a profit.

Figure 4 NPV of investment in nuclear power in the
Netherlands with different baseload power prices

The costs of insurance of a nuclear power plant were not included in
this study because of the absence of reliable data. The insurance
costs for operating nuclear power plants are, under current
conditions, not very high and will therefore not influence the NPV
calculations significantly. However, current insurances of nuclear
power plants cover just a fraction of the potential damage; the rest is
covered by the state. No insurance company is willing to fully cover
the disastrous effects of a nuclear accident. If owners of nuclear
power plants were fairly forced to cover the whole risk of a nuclear
accident, this would have a very negative impact on the NPV.

Permanent storage of nuclear waste not included

In this study only short-term costs of storage of nuclear waste were
included. Long-term costs – nuclear waste should be stored safely for
millions of years – are very hard to determine because no single, final
solution for waste storage is available worldwide. Therefore, the state
is responsible for the costs related to the final disposal of nuclear fuel.
If owners were forced to cover these costs, this could have a negative
impact on the NPV.

Construction time

The methodology used in this report assumes overnight construction
costs, which means that the model assumes that the plant is
constructed overnight and will start generating electricity and income
from Day 1. Construction of a nuclear power plant can take up to 10
years14 and delays are common practice; the Olkiluoto power plant in
Finland is already 2.5 years behind schedule, after only 3 years of
construction. Therefore, the NPV of nuclear power plants calculated
according to this model – using construction periods of 5 to 6 years -
is likely to be an underestimation of the real costs of construction in
the European market.

Conclusion: invest in wind-power and
gas fired power plants

This study shows that investing in nuclear power under the current
investment costs and electricity prices in the Netherlands is highly
risky and is likely to lead to the loss of substantial amounts of money.
This leads to the conclusion that nuclear power only can be profitable
in the unlikely event of a sharp decline in construction costs or with
the help of government subsidies and guarantees.

Figure 5 shows that investment in coal-fired power plants – taking into
account the price of CO2 – is also an unprofitable investment,
whereas investment in gas-fired power plants can be profitable. The
investment in onshore wind parks has a slightly negative NPV.

The difference in the predicted NPV of a new nuclear power plant
between the MIT and the Moody’s is around €3.5 million / MW, while
the difference between low and high scenarios of coal-fired and gas-
fired power plants is no more than €200,000 / MW.

This shows that there are far more
uncertainties and higher economic risks
involved in nuclear power plants than in
other power options.
