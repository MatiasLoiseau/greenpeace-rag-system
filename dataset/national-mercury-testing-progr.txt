Mahogany – the ‘Green Gold’ of Amazon destruction
Over the past 30 years 15% of the Brazilian Amazon has been completed destroyed, reaching over
590,000 square kilometres – an area larger than France. One of the main driving forces behind thisdestruction has been the dramatic increase in predatory and illegal logging. In 1970, the Amazonsupplied just 12% of Brazil’s production of tropical wood. Today it supplies 90% of the country’sproduction of tropical wood, estimated at 30 million cubic metres per year

In particular by one species - Brazilian mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) - makes the destruction of
the Amazon possible by opening the door to destructive logging and development. This  “green gold”of the Amazon fetches up to US$1,600 per cubic metre (m3) in the international market, where asmuch as 70% ends up
2 3.
The Mahogany Belt is a region of dry land forests rich in valuable wood species and areas of
ecological conservation. It covers some 800,000 square km of the Brazilian Amazon and stretchesfrom the south of Pará to the State of Acre, crossing the north of Mato Grosso, Rondônia and thesouth of Amazonas states. Not by coincidence, the Mahogany Belt is known today as the“Deforestation Belt”.
In Pará State, the largest remaining concentrations of mahogany are largely found on Indian Lands.
The high price of mahogany in the international market and the lack of sufficient control by theBrazilian authorities have only served to encourage the illegal exploitation on Indian Lands.
Two years ago, the Kayapó Indian chief Megaron was quoted by the newspaper ‘O Estado de S.
Paulo’ as saying that Indians receive R$ 50,00 (U$ 20) to allow harvesting of a mahogany tree. The
few logging companies controlling the market will export the same tree, reduced to 3 m3 of sawn
timber after processing, for some US$ 2,400 at the port of Belém. This incredibly large margin of netincome explains why loggers are invading Indian Lands. Megaron, who is a strong critic of the system,said in the same article ‘Indians must ask loggers for more money’.
Roads to destruction
The relentless search for precious mahogany stocks, loggers have opened up thousands of kilometresof illegal roads in Pará State, now the largest producer and exporter of Amazon timber.
Very intensive and predatory logging practices have depleted of the mahogany stocks of the South of
Pará.  Illegal loggers have invaded Indian territories surrounding the Middle Land. In 1985, loggers
opened more than 500 km of road leaving north from the town of Tucumã, invading Apyterewa Indian
land.
4 This road brought thousands of settlers to the area and the total area of Indian territory was
reduced in size by the government.

Many violent conflicts have been registered in Indian lands. “An unknown number of Indians have
been murdered as a result of their opposition to logging in their reserves. Indians have been forced totake direct, sometimes violent action themselves in their attempts to halt the illegal incursions into their
territories by loggers”, according to the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.

Recently loggers and miners also crossed the Xingu River heading west, invading public lands in the
Middle Land.
Even the worldwide famous leader of the Amazon garimpeiros (gold prospectors), José Altino
Machado, is bewildered by the speed of the invasion. In an interview published in August 2001, he
said that loggers and farmers had opened 600 km of roads between São Félix do Xingu and Itaitubasince 1995. “These roads are not at the edge of the Amazon Forest”, he claims. “They are in the heartof it.” José Altino became famous for leading an “army” of 40,000 ‘garimpeiros’ who invaded theYanomami Indian land in the 1980s. Today he is using his personal wealth and airplanes amassed
from mining to help farmers and loggers to invade the Middle Land. According to José Altino, another
400 km of roads are currently being opened up.
Campaign History
Since the Earth Summit held in Brazil in 1992, Greenpeace has been campaigning for protection ofmahogany and the Brazilian Amazon. The organisation campaigned to get mahogany listed on the
Annex II of CITES (Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species) but the Brazilian
Government has always led the opposition to this measure, arguing lack of evidence that the stocksare depleted.
In 1996, after the release of alarming data about deforestation by the Brazilian Institute of Space
Research, and a strong campaign led by Greenpeace and other NGOs, the Brazilian Government put
in place a two-year moratorium on new projects to exploit mahogany. The moratorium has been
extended and is now valid until June 2002.
The Government also decided to fix annual quotas for exportation. The volume to be exported is
determined every year and has been reduced progressively. In 2000, the quota was 50,000 m3 . For
2001, the quota is limited to 30,000 m3.
In 1997, Greenpeace asked the Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to undertake an
extensive inventory of the remaining mahogany stocks, promised by the Government since 1992. Theinventory has still not been carried out.
In 1998, Greenpeace asked the Government to undertake an inspection of the forest management
plans authorised to log mahogany. We are still repeating this demand today.

Greenpeace investigations
2000
In July 2000, Greenpeace investigated the S. Felix do Xingu region and found illegal mahogany
operations in the same region of Kayapó Indian Lands we investigated again in 2001. Videodocumentation of the findings was delivered to environmental authorities. In September 2000, IBAMA
and Brazilian federal law enforcement authorities undertook Operation Xingu, which involved 22
IBAMA (the Brazilian environmental agency) inspectors and 16 Federal police agents.
According to inspectors who participated in operation Xingu, the investigation was very difficult and
dangerous to undertake. For example a government helicopter was sabotaged when somebody
placed diesel in its fuel tank and local petrol stations refused to provide service to government agents
7.
On Tuesday, the 26 September 2000, agents in two helicopters landed in the log-yard called
“Camaçari” on Kayapó Indian Lands. The agents couldn’t find the loggers, who had disappeared. Intheir place, armed Kayapó Indians seized the group. After a long negotiation, chiefs Krekretum andPykararankr, leaders of the village Cocraimoro, released the agents who left behind 1,900 m3 of
mahogany they had tried to seize in the log-yard inside the Reserve. Funai’s (the Indian representative
body) local agent was appointed as a ‘legal guardian’ of the timber. The government tried to deny theseizure of its agents, but journalist Nicolau Farah, who was in one of the helicopters, confirmed this ina story published in Jornal do Brasil on 28 September 2000.
IBAMA and the Federal Police moved their base to Sao Felix do Xingu and inspected sawmills of the
region of S. Felix, Xinguara and Tucumã. During this period, 15,917m3 of logs and 237m3 of sawn
timber were seized. The companies involved received fines totalling R$ 6 million (some US$ 2.4million).  Of this total, 7,924 m3 of logs and 123 m3 of sawn timber were of mahogany.
In January 2001, three of the companies – Serra Dourada, Pirizina and Ouro Verde – received from a
local judge a provisional decision allowing them to trade the mahogany. It was an extraordinary
authorisation, as illegal timber is a federal crime, out of the jurisdiction of a local judge.
2001
In September 2001 a Greenpeace investigation team surveyed illegal logging operations in the Middle
Land and in the Indian lands surrounding it. This is the third Greenpeace expedition to the area,
following land and aerial surveys in 1999 and 2000.
Using GPS,8 digital video cameras and photographic equipment, Greenpeace found logging roads and
airstrips on the Arawetê and Apiterewa Indian lands, as well as in the Middle Land itself.
However, the most significant finding was located at the position S 07o 26’802” and W 052o 41’169”.
Greenpeace found and documented a large log-yard in the Kayapó land, on the left bank of the Xingu
River, full of trucks, cars, bulldozers and hundreds, maybe thousands, of logs. A large road leavesfrom a log-yard into the Kayapó Menkragnoti forest, heading west. At the log yard, also used as theport, boats wait to take the logs to sawmills. An aerial survey of the log-yard exposed large log-rafts ofmahogany heading down river in the direction of Sao Félix do Xingu, an important logging town at theedge of the Middle Land. Another smaller log-yard was documented at the edge of the Kayapó land,

on the right bank of the Xingu, north of the Kayapó and Gorotire land. Again, a logging road was found
heading from the yard into the forest.
The Brazilian law forbids logging in Indian reserves.9 Greenpeace has delivered a copy of the video
and photographs to the Federal Prosecution office and to IBAMA in Brasilia, to ask for further
investigation on who is trading mahogany and other valuable species illegally harvested in Indianlands.
Summary
Today, there are only 13 remaining mahogany Forest Management Plans (FMPs) under ‘legal’
operation in the Amazon. All of them are in Pará State, inside the Middle Land or in its surroundings.
The owners of 8 of these 13 projects have being involved in illegal logging, according to official data.
Greenpeace believes that ‘legal’ papers delivered by IBAMA, covering the few remaining FMPs, are
being used to launder illegal mahogany exploited on Indian lands.
Recent Greenpeace investigations have flown over some of these FMPs and found little sign of any
logging activity. Previous interviews with local people and loggers in the mahogany logging centres(Sao Félix do Xingu, Tucumã, Xinguara, Rio Maria, Redencão etc) – as well as with governmentalauthorities and independent researchers
10 – have convinced our investigation team that there are very
limited commercial stocks of mahogany outside of Indian Lands and federal reserves. Many articles inthe Brazilian press confirm the invasion of Indian lands by mahogany loggers.
The continuous reports of illegal mahogany exploitation undermines the credibility of responsible
traders in the international marketplace and of the Brazilian environmental authorities. Yet it can easilybe solved if decisive action is taken by both the Brazilian government and in the marketplace.
Greenpeace call for action:
Greenpeace is calling on the Brazilian Government to:
! Undertake an immediate in-depth investigation of all current mahogany Forest Management
Plans. This investigation should be carried out by Ibama with the participation of NGOs and thescientific community (The only exception should be the existing project on Xicrin land.Greenpeace believes that the involvement of NGOs and government technicians with this project,
which aims to be FSC certified, is sufficient for insuring transparency and credibility).
! Permanently revoke all FMPs held by companies found laundering illegal mahogany logs or other
species.
                                                          
9 There is only one exception: a project of sustainable logging in the Xicrin Indian Land, which is authorized by
the government. The project is being monitored by NGOs and aims to be FSC certified.
