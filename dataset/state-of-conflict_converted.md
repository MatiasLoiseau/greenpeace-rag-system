FOREWORD
In 1992, Greenpeace began to investigate illegal and predatory
logging in the Brazilian Amazon. In October 2001, it released a
report introducing the actors and accomplices in the illegal trade in
mahogany – Partners in Mahogany Crime – which gave crucial
information to the Brazilian government’s environmental agency,
IBAMA, in support of suspending the logging of, and trade in,
mahogany.

This latest report is the result of an investigation into the timber
sector in Pará State, the largest producer and exporter of wood
products in the Brazilian Amazon. Pará is also the site of one-third of
the region’s total deforestation.

State of Conflict concentrates on the two most aggressive logging
frontiers in Pará: the regions of Porto de Moz and Prainha, on the left
bank of the Xingu River, and the Middle Land, a large area of
relatively intact forest, between the Xingu and the Tapajós rivers. The
Transamazon Highway and the legally protected Indian lands, south
of the Highway, separate these two regions.

Logging and cattle ranching are now the main driving forces behind
the illegal assault on land in these regions. The development of these
industries is surging ahead, leaving the law behind. In both regions
local communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
sectors of the Brazilian government are engaged in a fight for an
alternative model of land-use based on community ownership of land
and protected areas.

This report exposes an alarming picture of land invasions and illegal
occupancy of public land, of violence, murder and modern-day
slavery that is the secret face of Amazon destruction. Considered in
isolation, each of these cases is an offense against human dignity
and human rights. Combined, they create a dramatic picture of a
Brazilian region that appears to be forging its way into a future
without law.

During our investigations it became clear that the economically
aggressive logging sector in Pará cannot be fully understood in
isolation and must be framed in a broader context of forest
destruction in this region – the process of invasion and conquest of
remote and pristine areas of this immense territory. This rapid
process of development has been fuelled by the actions of economic
groups operating under little or no control from the Brazilian Federal
government or Brazilian society.

As more and more high-value timber species are exhausted in older
logging frontiers, the remaining unprotected frontier areas, including
Porto de Moz and the Middle Land, are increasingly under threat.
More and more loggers are migrating into these areas in search of
the last remaining commercial stocks of high value timbers in Pará,
and more and more cattle ranchers are eager to increase the size of
their herds and the land to raise them. Soya farming is now adding
to the deforestation equation. The cycle of predatory logging and
deforestation therefore continues.

Almost half of all known species live in the
Amazon Basin. Among them are 353 species
of mammals, 3,000 fish species, 1,000 species
of birds, 60,000 plant species and an
estimated 10 million species of insects.

government’s antislavery Mobile Enforcement
Team.”

values nothing and death costs R$100.”

In many cases this destruction has been the result of government
initiatives, such as road-building, tax incentives for rural projects,
settlements and dams, aimed at bringing a pattern of economic
development to the region. Both scientists and economists have
shown that this predatory pattern of development is wholly
inappropriate for the Amazon, a region with poor soil and intense
levels of rainfall.

As with many other areas of the Amazon, environmental problems in
Pará are often associated with social injustice and the lack of law
enforcement. The victim is not only the forest, commonly seen as a
cheap source of valuable commodities or as a barrier to ‘economic
development’. It is also the traditional communities and indigenous
people, for whom the Amazon is their home and their way of life.

To date, Federal and State authorities, lacking funds and
infrastructure, usually react to the problem on a case-by-case basis.
Environmental enforcement agents are sent to fight illegal operations
here and there; the Federal Police raid farms that are using slave
labor to clear the forest and make cattle ranches. Necessary as they
are, these limited operations do not begin to solve the overwhelming
set of problems facing Pará. The roots are too deeply embedded in a
perverse model of boom and bust development and in the structural
deficiencies of the Brazilian public sector.

To refer to Pará in terms of warfare, as a ‘State of Conflict’, is no
exaggeration: there is an undeclared war going on – over land, over
forest resources and over rapid profit at any price. If the conflict is
not brought under control, the weaker side, local communties and
indigenous groups, will pay the highest price. Ultimately, Brazil
stands to lose hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of the
Amazon, along with millions of animals and plants, with some
species becoming extinct. Not only Pará State, but Brazil may lose
the opportunity of opening the way to a better and sustainable future.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Around 40 percent of the world’s remaining tropical rainforest is
found in the Amazon Basin, a place of enormous ecological
importance in sustaining global water and climate systems. Despite
decades of intense focus in the spotlight of international
environmental concern, the Amazon is today, more than ever, under
siege from the loggers, farmers, and politicians who view it as a
modern Eldorado to be plundered for profit.

Of all Brazil’s Amazon regions, it is Pará State that has suffered the
worst impact from logging. The largest timber exporting region of the
entire Amazon, Pará has lost an area of rainforest the size of Austria,
the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland combined.

Pará’s story is one that resonates throughout the Amazon. It tells of a
‘boom and bust’ cycle whereby loggers exploit the land, strip it of
forest cover and abandon it to cattle ranchers or other large-scale
farming ventures. The period of boom, fuelled by the extraction of
high-value species such as mahogany and cedar, quickly gives way
to decline as lesser species of timber are exhausted in their turn, and
the land is transformed into nutrient-poor grazing or farmland,
providing little economic opportunity for the community.

Fuelling this cycle is a state of lawlessness in which land invasions
and illegal occupancy of public land are backed by violence and
even murder. Pará has Brazil’s highest rate of assassinations linked
to land conflicts, and these are hardly ever investigated. As local
forest dwellers who depend on the land for hunting, fishing and
small-scale farming are forced away from their territory, the gulf
between rich and poor in Pará widens.

In remote, hard-to-police areas of the forest, deforestation is
frequently driven by slavery. Workers are lured into forest areas with
promises of well-paid farm work, and become trapped in debt
bondage, working under dangerous and inhumane conditions for
little or no pay. Those who try to escape are sometimes killed.

The variety of methods of land title falsification that enable loggers
and others to lay claim to the rainforest are described by the term
grilagem. Grilagem is made possible by the legal quagmire which
characterizes land ownership in the Brazilian Amazon, with little
checking by land registration authorities. Loggers exploit the legal
and bureaucratic vacuum to seize land using a mixture of grilagem
and physical force. Greenpeace produced a detailed map showing
grilagem linked to Forest Management Plans in Porto de Moz. This
map – the first of its kind – was submitted to IBAMA in October
2003 along with a demand for action.

The conflict for land and forests today is raging most intensely in two
key frontiers in the west of Pará, the Middle Land and Porto de Moz.
Here, the Federal Police force has been cut to a quarter of its size
twenty years ago, and an illegal assault on the rainforest is underway.
Assisted by their political allies, a number of companies which have

of Amazon destruction.

exploited the legal and bureaucratic tangle to seize land, using a
mixture of grilagem and physical force, are leading the charge.

In the face of the threat to their traditional lands, local inhabitants are
joining forces to propose the creation of Extractive Reserves, areas
protected by Federal law for conservation and sustainable use by
traditional communities. The proposed Verde para Sempre (Green
Forever) and Renascer (Reborn) reserves have become the target of
angry opposition from logging and political interests, particularly
since 400 community members took direct action in late 2002 to
blockade barges loaded with illegal timber destined for export.

Greenpeace has investigated and documented many cases of illegal
and predatory behavior by logging interests. Yet the landholders who
have already devastated large swathes of the forest are now
demanding that the government authorize new areas for exploitation,
arguing that they create jobs and contribute to the economic
development of regions like Pará. Under pressure from these
powerful interests, the Federal and State governments are
discussing a new system of concessions.

While the debate is reaching the press, and the public to some
extent, Greenpeace recently discovered that the first ‘authorization of
use of public state property’1 has been issued by Pará State to a
logger in Porto de Moz. Nothing in the contract obliges the logger to
do even basic regeneration of the forest after exploiting its
resources.

Greenpeace believes that the real long-term future of Pará lies in a
new social and economic model of sustainable use of the forests
combined with areas of protection. Logging companies committed to
truly legal, sustainable and certified operations have a place in this
future, but the main effort must be concentrated on bringing
governance and environmental and social justice to the Amazon. The
only way to achieve this is through the strong commitment of the
Brazilian Federal and State governments, backed by international
cooperation, to empower the traditional communities and other forest
dwellers to become the driving force for economic development and
environmental protection in the Amazon.

Brazil stands to lose hundreds of thousands
of square kilometers of the Amazon, along
with millions of animals and plants, with
some species becoming extinct.

SECTION 1

PARÁ UP FOR GRABS
The Amazon Basin covers five percent of the land surface of the
planet, extending over some 7.8 million km2. It has 25,000 km of
navigable rivers and contains around 20% of the Earth’s fresh water.
Its forests represent one of the most important ecosystems on Earth,
accounting for 45% of tropical forests and storing 40% of the carbon
residing in terrestrial vegetation.3 Almost half of all known species live
in the Amazon. Among them, 353 species of mammals, 3,000 fish
species, 1,000 species of birds, 60,000 plant species and an
estimated 10 million species of insects.4 The Amazon plays a vital role
in maintaining biodiversity, regional hydrology and climate.

This region has long been regarded by those wishing to exploit it as a
latter-day Eldorado, a place of fabulous wealth and opportunity and the
last frontier on Earth to be conquered. Short-term political and
economic interests have fuelled boom and bust predatory
development in the region, which has undergone rapid deforestation in
recent years.

According to a report published in 2002 by IMAZON (Institute of
Man and the Environment of the Amazon), around 95 percent of the
timber exploited in the Brazilian Amazon (Amazon)5 is produced by
predatory logging.6

The Amazon has one the world’s highest absolute rates of forest
destruction, currently averaging around 18,000 km2 per year.7 The
latest data shows a forty percent increase in deforestation, reaching
25,476 km2 in just one year.8 Today, loggers, farmers, private
enterprises and many politicians, local public administrators and
legislators still view the Amazon as a vast territory to seize, occupy
and exploit.9

Pará is the second largest Brazilian state, covering an area over
1.2 million km2, about twice the size of France. Today it is the largest
timber producing and exporting region in the Amazon, accounting for
40% of production10 and 60% of all exports from all Amazon States.11
An estimated one-third of timber produced in Pará is now exported,
making it the second most valuable commodity exported from the state
(after minerals).12 In 2002, Pará exported at least US$312 million in
timber products, to markets in the USA (34.9%), France (13.7 %),
Spain (8.1%), the Netherlands (7.4%), China, Portugal, the Dominican
Republic, Japan and the UK, amongst others.13 (See Markets of timber
and timber products from Brazil, Amazon and Pará State, page 7)

At the same time Pará accounts for over one-third14 of the total
Amazon deforestation in Brazil amounting to an area larger than the
size of Austria, Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland combined.15
Satellite images released by INPE – the Brazilian Institute of Space
Research – in 2003 show that the majority of the illegal deforestation
occurred in areas surrounding Pará’s Middle Land.

Deforestation in Pará has been driven by over four decades of
predatory and unsustainable logging. Land-use is largely a question
of the illegal seizure of public lands, which are exploited for logging,
then turned over to cattle ranching.16

The Amazon region is of critical importance to
forest dwelling communities and to wildlife,
sheltering numerous species including jaguars,
giant alligators, spider monkeys and anteaters.

Pará accounts for over one-third of the total
Amazon deforestation in Brazil. Deforestation
for timber and cattle ranching is commonly
linked with the employment of slave labor.

“Essentially, the dynamic of destruction
and pillage of natural resources
attempts to make unfeasible another
kind of project to the region, based on
the sustainable use of environment and
its resources”.

Brazilian National Report to the UN High
Commissioner on Human Rights, April 2003.2

This development has been an environmental disaster and has had a
lasting detrimental impact on indigenous people who have lived in
the region since colonial times, and forest dwelling communities who
migrated to the region during various waves of occupation of the
Amazon. This short-lived cycle of forest destruction, often justified by
those who defend it in the name of economic development,
concentrates lands in the hands of a few landlords, resulting in a
situation of poverty for those communities who live in the region as
their means of subsistence is degraded, affecting hunting, fishing
and other traditional resources.17

In 1997, over one-third of the rural population, who depend on the
Amazon were considered to be living in a situation of “critical
poverty.”18 The value of the land diminishes once it has become
degraded so that the ‘economic development’ is short-lived even for
those exploiting it.

GRILAGEM - USING FALSE LAND TITLES TO EXPLOIT PUBLIC LAND

Illegal land grabs have become one of the most powerful means of
land-based domination in the Amazon – resulting in a major social
disparity.20 Known as grilagem in Brazil, the falsification of land titles
is the method employed by a large number of loggers, cattle
ranchers and land speculators to exploit public land. Illegal
landholders take over public lands by forging titles of ownership with
the complicity of land registration offices, and by using violence to
expel informal settlers and Indian communities who have legitimate
rights to the lands.21 (See Methods Commonly Used by Land
Grabbers, page 20.)

The legal quagmire of land ownership in the Amazon was
characterized by the prominent Pará legal expert Professor Otávio
Mendonça, in a debate on land ownership in May 1980.
“Unfortunately, with very few exceptions, the Amazon Cartórios
[private offices authorized by the government to legally register
documents] registered every paper and claim that any prospective
landowner brought forward.”22 Due to multiple claims and the lack of
a central registry in Brazil, the total area of land registrations
recorded in one region can exceed the size of the region itself.23

In Pará, the main economic motives for grilagem have shifted with
time, according to the availability of natural resources and the market.
Between the 1960s and 1980s, gold, bauxite and tin ore mining
were the primary motives. From the 1990s onwards, the motive was
logging and the vast expansion of large-scale cattle ranching, which
supplies the timber sector.

In 1999, the Federal government carried out an initial investigation
into grilagem and concluded that at least 100 million hectares had
suspicious documentation. After the investigation INCRA, the
agency in charge of regulating tenure on federally held land in Brazil,
cancelled the registration of over 70 million hectares. One-third of
this area was in Pará, some 20.8 million hectares in 422 farms.24
Cancellation of INCRA registration prevents public funds from being
used for development, but does not lead to the land title becoming
void as, in many cases, claimant owners started suing INCRA. The
legal battles are far from over.

The INCRA investigation was followed up with a more detailed
investigation into grilagem in the Amazon by a special Parliamentary
Commission of Inquiry (CPI), set up by the Federal House of
Deputies.25 It should be noted that both the CPI and INCRA
investigations failed to include the region of Porto de Moz, which has
a high incidence of grilagem by logging companies.

One of the extraordinary cases documented by both the INCRA and
CPI investigations was of land in Pará registered under the name of
‘Carlos Medeiros’. According to the CPI investigation a gang of
grileiros (land-grabbers) used documents under the name Carlos
Medeiros to seize about 12 million hectares of land, some 10
percent of Pará. However, the CPI report concluded that, based on
the ambiguous documentation, “the total area controlled by
Medeiros could span 35 million hectares.” This would represent
some 30% of Pará. Medeiros’ lawyers and representatives broke this

massive area of land into parcels and sold them to dozens of third
parties, with both real and invented identities.26

Lawyers claiming to represent him stated that Medeiros, in the
1970s, received land from the heirs of two Portuguese settlers who
had claimed ownership of large sections of Pará. A Pará judge in
1975 recognized the legitimacy of the claim of Medeiros, but was
later removed from office for irregularities.27

Carlos Medeiros has never come forward. His lawyers said they
could not locate him to bring him to the CPI investigation. His
existence has never been confirmed. He is almost certainly a ‘ghost’.

Medeiros was not the only huge case that the CPI investigated in
Pará. They also looked closely at land acquired by one large Brazilian
company, C.R. Almeida S.A., established by Mr. Cecílio do Rego
Almeida, who was listed by Forbes magazine in 1992 as one of the
richest men in the world, and considered by Veja magazine to be the
largest landholder. Almeida is a self-made businessman who claims
ownership to some 7 million hectares of forest, almost the size of
Belgium and Holland together, in two large farms (Fazenda Curuá
and Fazenda Xingu) in the Middle Land.28 (See Cecílioland, page
22–23.)

Both the Federal and State authorities contest his legal ownership.
“The CPI considered illegitimate the ownership and property of
Fazenda Curuá… registered in the name of Sr. Cecílio do Rego
Almeida,” at the Cartório Moreira land registry office in Altamira as
4.7 million hectares.29 After analyzing the documents and maps, Dr.
Cândido Paraguassu Élleres, former director of ITERPA (the Pará
State Land Institute), declared that he had personally found a larger
area – 5.7 million hectares30 — controlled by the company C.R.
Almeida. “The CPI states that it is clear that a lease contract for
30,000 hectares made possible the registration of almost 6 million
hectares [in the region of the Middle Land] in the Book of Properties
in the name of the company C.R. Almeida.”31

The tangled web of land ownership in Pará is being further
exacerbated by offers of millions of hectares of land for sale over the
internet. For example, www.imoveisvirtuais.com.br offers dozens of
‘farms’ for sale, including one of 306,000 hectares in the Middle
Land. The advertisement offers “all virgin forest, at the right margin
of the Iriri River, with excellent documentation” for R$60 (around
US$20) per hectare. Despite the large area of land on offer, the ad
makes clear that only 4,356 hectares have escritura – or a legal land
title. According to the Procuradoria Jurídica do Instituto de Terras do
Pará, the legal department of ITERPA, the sales are illegal. “The
lands of this region belong to Pará State and can’t be sold unless
by the state itself”, says the Procuradoria Jurídica.32

THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL QUAGMIRE OF LAND OWNERSHIP

“Only by integrating the Amazon with the
Brazilian territory through developing the
region and increasing its security will we be
free from the threat of international control.”

General Rodrigo Otávio, former Director of the
Superior Academy of War, 1971.34

The process of grilagem has historical roots: “In Brazil
all lands were originally public in that they belonged to
the Kingdom of Portugal by right of conquest. Later
they were transferred to the Brazilian Empire, and then
to the Republic, but always as dominion of the
nation.”35 With the dissolution of the Brazilian Empire,
the 1891 Brazilian Constitution of the Republic
transferred all terras devolutas (public lands lacking
official documentation) from Federal dominion to the
dominion of individual states, except for land along
Brazil’s international frontiers. The new Republican
constitution recognized previous documents of land
use, and effective private occupation of lands registered
at paróquias (churches) and municipalities.36 Proof of
payment for the land, as well as demarcation of the
borders and proof of occupation were required to
obtain final legal private ownership of an area, even for
land that had previously been registered.

Throughout the entire country, fewer than 10% of the
properties complied with the new law.37 The immense
majority of properties in private hands therefore
continued to be based on titles that didn’t prove legal
private domain. The transfer of authority from Federal to
State level made it very difficult, if not impossible, to
confirm private land use and occupation as the states
had neither the infrastructure nor, in many cases, the will
to check that land registrations were legitimate. These
precarious land titles were later registered in Livro 3
(Book 3), the public registry for land title transfers – i.e.
for sales and purchase of land between private owners,
and transfer through inheritance. In remote areas such
as the Amazon, it became common to increase the area
of land on paper by thousands of hectares, or to have
more than one claimant for the same area.

Despite the lack of definitive proof, and the precarious
nature of the land titles, areas larger than permitted
under the new law were recorded in Livro 3, resulting in
thousands of hectares of public lands being transferred
illegally to private ownership.

In the 1960s and the 1970s the military government
pushed forward with large scale development plans for
the Amazon – roads, railways, dams and other
infrastructure projects, aided by incentives such as low-
interest loans for farming and ranching. This caused an
increased demand for land, and an influx of
entrepreneurs keen to exploit the riches of the Amazon
using government loans and grants to fund their
enterprises. It also triggered a massive immigration from
other regions of poor people who were promised small
landholdings by the military government, under the
banner “A land without people for people without land”.

The overall situation was further aggravated by a
Military Government decree on April 1, 1971, Decreto-
Lei N° 1.164, transferring back to the Federal
government ownership of all land 100 km on either side
of existing and planned Federal roads and highways.
Under this decree, two-thirds of the entire area of Pará
State reverted to Federal government ownership. The
confusion over land ownership increased, with the State
and Federal governments disputing who had the right to
issue land titles. This legal vacuum has been used, and
is still being used, by grileiros to access new areas or
force traditional communities to renounce their land
rights.

However, the decree was considered crucial to the
military dictatorship’s ambition of integrating the
Amazon with the rest of Brazil by means of rapid
development. In June 1970, the military announced the
construction of 12,000 km of roads in the Amazon, the
most important one being the Transamazon Highway,
crossing the Amazon from east to west. The road has
been one of the main vector for the development of the
region. To attract companies, farmers and settlers, the
military dictatorship ordered INCRA to create
settlements along the Highway. Between 1971 and
1975, 100,000 families were transferred from poor
regions of Brazil to INCRA settlement areas of 100
hectares each in size.38 The ambitious highway remains
unpaved, with large areas now eroded and reclaimed
back by the forest. Abandoned by the State, those
settlers who remained in the region support themselves
by subsistence activities, or work for cattle ranchers
and loggers.

11

WOOD FOR BLOOD
Grilagem, along with logging, is often accompanied by the use or
threat of physical violence. Loggers and large landowners pressure
powerless traditional communities to leave their land and, in some
cases, simply expel the residents by destroying their crops, burning
houses, firing at them or even by killing them.40

Pará has the highest rate of assassinations linked to land conflicts in
Brazil. Between 1985 and 2001 nearly 40 percent of the 1,237 rural
workers killed in Brazil were killed in Pará, according to the Pastoral
Land Commission (CPT), a Catholic organization campaigning for
landless people and the poor.41 An inventory conducted by the Pará
State government during the same period reported that there were
804 victims of assassination.42 In 2002, the number of victims
increased by almost 50 percent compared to the previous year, and
half were killed in Pará.43

Although numerous cases of violence, including murders, are
reported, they are hardly ever properly investigated. Those
responsible are rarely if ever punished, often because witnesses are
intimidated or killed. Public intervention is unstructured, sporadic,
partial and fragmented. Different levels and sectors of government
do not converse or interact. Some organized communities, who
refuse to accept ruin and devastation and have proposed alternative
development projects based on the sustainable use of natural
resources, live under frequent threats and the risk of being killed.44

In August 2001, Ademir Alfeu Federicci (known as ‘Dema’) was
assassinated inside his house in front of his family. Dema, a
coordinator of the Movement for the Development of the
Transamazon and the Xingu Area (MDTX), had voiced numerous
condemnations of corrupt politicians and illegal logging inside Indian
lands in Pará, including mahogany logging.45 Federal Police officers
and the MDTX believe his murder was a contract killing. However,
the civil police claimed that Dema was killed during a bungled
burglary, and obtained a confession from Julio Cesar dos Santos
shortly after the event. Santos has since claimed that he only
confessed to the burglary after being tortured by Pará State Civil
Police officers. The people believed to been behind the murder of
Dema reportedly attempted to silence Santos.46

In the town of São Félix do Xingu, the main frontier for the Middle
Land, 30 people have already been murdered this year in cases
related to disputes for land and mahogany. The Brazilian newspaper
O Estado de S. Paulo reported in late September – under the
evocative title: “Where the law values nothing and death costs
R$100” – that at least three groups of gunmen are operating in the
area. According to O Estado, the violence was related to the dispute
for wood stocks, in particular mahogany, and is linked with other
illegal activities.47

A week before the article was published, eight rural workers were
assassinated by gunmen on a farm in São Felix do Xingu. According
to preliminary investigations, the massacre was related to the dispute
over land and rich wood stocks.48 Mario Lúcio de Avelar, the Federal
Prosecutor who was leading the investigation into crime in the region
and its relation with drugs and money laundering, was on the

In August 2001, Dema, a coordinator of the
Movement for the Development of the
Transamazon and the Xingu Area (MDTX),
was assassinated inside his house in front of
his family. He had voiced numerous
condemnations of corrupt politicians and illegal
logging inside Indian lands in Pará, including
mahogany logging.

In July 2002, a rural worker’s leader known
as Brasília was assassinated one month after
sending a letter to the authorities denouncing
threats he and local families were receiving
from loggers and farmers.

loggers into the region, because logging
activities capitalise, directly or indirectly,
the actual and potential cattle ranchers.”

receiving end of a death threat and was moved to Brasília, the
Federal capital, for his protection.49 In his report, Avelar states:
“According to preliminary data from Customs, the existence of
much financial movement of groups, persons and companies was
identified… Some of those people, due to ‘grilagem’ activities and
the establishing of farms, were denounced as responsible for the
crime of keeping their workers under conditions similar to
slave work”.50

VICIOUS CYCLE OF PREDATORY LOGGING,
DEFORESTATION AND ‘CATTELIZATION’ OF
THE AMAZON

In 2003 Brazil became the largest exporter of beef in the world.51
Around 80 percent of Amazon deforestation areas currently in use
are occupied by the cattle-ranching industry – much of it in the
hands of large landowners.52 In the 1990s almost all of Brazil’s
expansion of cattle farming took place in the Amazon – in Pará the
herd was increased by nearly six million.53 This rapid expansion has
led some analysts to adopt the term ‘cattelization’ to depict the
extraordinary increase in the Amazon cattle herd.54

In the boom and bust cycle of predatory logging and deforestation,
madeireiros (loggers) exploit the land, deplete it of forest cover and
abandon it to the fazendeiros (farmers). On average, ranching
requires the clearing of 1.4 hectares of Amazon forest to support one
cow; it generates very limited revenue and employment.55

13

The short-lived economic booms of predatory logging are created by
the extraction of high value timber species – including mahogany
and cedar – which finances the pioneer roads that cut through
previously unavailable frontier areas. Thousands of kilometers of
illegal logging roads have been opened across Pará by those in
search of high value timber species, which have helped facilitate a
process of colonization. The ‘boom’ economy begins to decline after
several years, when the supply of high value timber has been
depleted and a second round of logging begins.56

Once the second or third wave of loggers starts to exploit the
medium-value timber species – including jatobá, tauari and ipê –
farmers or cattle-ranchers come in search of land to transform into
grazing areas, profiting from the existing roads created by loggers.
Where buyers are available, farmers or cattle ranchers sell remaining
logs resulting from the final clearcutting of land to timber companies
to finance the transformation of forest into grazing land.57 For the
timber companies it is easier and less expensive to buy logs from
areas of illegal deforestation than to obtain them through authorized
Forest Management Plans (FMPs).58

Approximately 20 years after the start of the ‘boom’, the complete
exhaustion of marketable wood occurs, and the local economy
enters a crisis. Loggers abandon the region, leaving behind only low-
productivity land for ranching.59

Over three-quarters of a million hectares of
soya had been planted within the Amazon
deforestation belt by the end of 2001. Cargill
has built a huge granary and a shipping
terminal in Santarém, which is now a strategic
port for accessing the external market.

This unsustainable pattern of an illusory rapid economic growth
followed by a severe decline in forest resource, revenues and
employment has led to a drastic reduction in timber production in the
old logging frontiers in the east and south of Pará, also the main
areas of deforestation (see Pará Battlefield, inside front cover).60

“Impunity and lack of control make
possible that most of the wood is
illegally exploited, with no concern
about the reproduction and
conservation of the species.”

Brazilian National Report to the UN
High Commissioner on Human Rights,
April 200380

Today a new cycle of deforestation is emerging in the Amazon region
with the expansion of Brazil’s soya market. Soya farmers are
increasing their foothold on more valuable areas of land in the
Amazon, within reach of export facilities in Pará. Cattle ranchers are
now starting to sell their existing pastures and simply migrating to
open up new areas of the Amazon. Over three-quarters of a million
hectares of soya had been planted within the Amazon deforestation
belt by the end of 2001.61 In Santarém, where the Tapajós and the
Amazon rivers meet, Cargill has built a huge granary and a shipping
terminal, and the town is now a strategic port for accessing the
external market.

THE BALANCE OF TIMBER LEGALITY IN PARÁ STATE – 2001

The trade in timber is only legally permitted where it
originates from authorized Forest Management Plans
(FMPs) or authorized deforestation for the purpose of
land settlement. Both have to be approved by IBAMA.62

words, in 2001 only one percent of the total area was
authorized for deforestation – and the figures in
previous years are similar.67 The authorized volume of
timber produced from deforestation was 121,751 m3.

(1) Total log production in Pará – 10,800,000 m3 63
The exact figure of log production in Pará is almost
impossible to determine due to rampant illegality in the
timber industry. The above figure is based on
conservative statistics from IMAZON for 2001.

(2) Log production in Pará from authorized FMPs
– 4,665,383 m3
In 2001 the total authorized log production from valid
FMPs in Pará amounted to 4,665,383 m3.64 It is well
known in the Amzon that many FMPs are only
instruments for legalizing illegal logs through documents
issued by IBAMA.

(3) Log production in Pará from authorized
deforestation – 121,571m3
The vast majority of timber coming from deforestation in
Pará is illegal. In 2001, for example, the area approved
by IBAMA for deforestation was only 5,342 hectares,65
whereas the actual area of deforestation detected by
INPE was a staggering 523,700 hectares.66 In other

Balance of legality 2001
An initial analysis of IBAMAs authorized log prodution in
Pará for 2001, shows that the total volume of logs from
both FMPs and deforestation was 4,786,954 m3, or 44
percent of the total production estimated by IMAZON.
This is, an incredible 66 percent of all timber produced
in Pará would be illegal.

However, the majority of the FMP holders do not
respect the legislation for harvesting or the FMPs are
located in forest areas that are in fact public land, as
confirmed by Greenpeace in the Porto de Moz region
(see page 35–37). According to an initial assesment
carried out by IBAMA-Pará in 2003, some 88 percent
of all FMPs in the state have been inappropriately
planted on public land. IBAMA is now giving all
companies one year to present valid land title
documents or their FMPs will be suspended. Until these
companies can prove the legality of their properties,
their legal production cannot be considered without
suspicions.

SLAVERY – ALIVE AND WELL IN PARÁ

Slavery in the Amazon is a more covert process than the one which
provided forced labor for the plantations of the New World in past
centuries, but it is equally inhumane. Thousands of impoverished
people are lured away from squalid city slums or small villages of
Maranhão State, east of Pará, and other poor states of the northeast
of Brazil, by hopes of making their fortunes. However, they end up in
very isolated areas of Pará, generally at gunpoint, clearing areas of
forest to make way for enormous cattle ranches producing beef.
Between 1995 and 2001, 49% of the cases of slavery in Brazil
occurred in cattle ranches and 25% were related to deforestation.
The expansion of the soya frontier into the Amazon is drawing on
slave labor – already six percent of all known cases.69

Pará leads the way on slavery, a rampant problem that is affecting
many other Amazon states. During the first half of 2003, Pará
accounted for over 60 percent of all the workers liberated in Brazil
by the government’s antislavery Mobile Enforcement Team.70 The
Ministry of Labor has concluded that for every enslaved person who
is freed, a further three remain in a state of servitude.71 Of the 116
cases located by the Mobile Enforcement Team in Pará in 2002,72
the majority originated within the timber-producing and cattle-
ranching region in the south of Pará. Forty-nine of the workers were
children. The region of Iriri in the Middle Land is also known to have
a major concentration of slave workers.73(cid:19)

According to CPT, the Pastoral Commission on Land, Pará has more
than 25,000 rural people working in slavery or semi-slavery
conditions in 167 farms in the south and southeast of Pará.74 In 2001,
CPT found 45 cases involving 2,416 slave workers: this increased to
147 cases involving 5,559 workers in 2002. São Félix do Xingu
municipality, on the eastern border of the Middle Land, leads the way
in these perverse statistics.775

Workers fall into the trap of slave labor most commonly by being
recruited for fazendas (farms) by their agents, known as gatos
(literally meaning cats), on the basis of fraudulent promises of well-
paid work, accepting a verbal contract without knowing their real
future. They are then taken to areas deep within the forests and
become indebted with the expense of travel to the area, then
through having to pay exorbitant prices for accommodation, clothes,
medicine and food.76 They receive very little or no salary and become
trapped in debt bondage – defined as a form of slavery under
Article 1 of the UN Supplementary Convention on the Abolition
of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar
to Slavery, 1956.77

16

In 2002, the majority of cases of slavery
originated within the timber-producing and
cattle-ranching region in the south of Pará.

“Three of Brazil’s most important exports
are steel, timber and beef. They account
for billions of dollars in foreign earnings.
All three are tainted with slavery.”

Dr Kevin Bales, Consultant to the UN Global
Program on Trafficking in People, 2003.68

Workers fall into the trap of slave labor on
the basis of fraudulent promises of well-paid
work. They are then taken to areas deep
within the forests and become indebted with
the expense of travel to the area, then
through having to pay exorbitant prices for
accommodation, clothes, medicine and food.
This picture illustrates that people are given
numbers, not names.

They are forced to live in inhumane sanitary and health conditions,
sleeping under a canvas and under constant surveillance by armed
guards.78 Those who try to rebel against the subhuman conditions or
to escape are sometimes simply killed.81 A few lucky ones do
escape. In 2002 the BBC carried out an investigation into slave
labor and deforestation in Pará. They interviewed Evandro Rodrigues
who had spent most of his life logging mahogany. “We were cutting
mahogany deep in the rainforest you cannot reach by plane. The
power saw slipped and went into my leg. I was bleeding and
couldn’t walk. But the foreman said you’ll have to walk 30 km to
the farm or die. So I walked all night, with the shirt tied around my
legs. My boots were full of blood.” The BBC concluded that when
“Evandro reached his village after a week there was a man who
was sent to shoot him: they were afraid he would denounce their
logging to the authorities”.80

17

Satellite images released by the Brazilian
Institute of Space Research in 2003 show that
the majority of the illegal deforestation occurred
in areas surrounding Pará’s Middle Land.

“In our region there are so many
families that don’t have any land left
because big logging companies have
taken everything.”

SECTION 2

LAND WITHOUT LAW - THE MIDDLE LAND
AND PORTO DE MOZ

The struggle for land has become most significant, and often violent,
in two key frontiers in the west of Pará – the Middle Land and Porto
de Moz regions. Having plundered much of the rest of Pará, loggers,
cattle ranchers and land speculators, amongst others, are turning
these regions into the new lawless frontiers.

Brazil has far-sighted environmental laws, but policing them has
proved almost impossible. The lack of governance and law
enforcement has led to a situation where murder, violence, slavery,
land invasions and illegal occupancy of public land are characteristic
of this region of Pará. This complete lack of the rule of law makes it
easy for the logging companies or large-scale farmers to seize and
exploit public lands.

There is often little financial support for the Federal or State law
enforcement agencies, or what support there was has been almost
entirely withdrawn by cuts in the government’s annual budget. This is
a disastrous consequence of an agreement between the Brazilian
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which made
reducing public expenditure a precondition to continuing to receive
international financial aid.82 Brazil currently contributes around 10.53
percent of its Gross Domestic Product to honoring the interest
payments on its external debts.83 Brazil is one of many countries in
the Amazon region that remains in ‘debt-bondage’ – slaves to
the IMF.

Cuts in the Federal budget have affected the whole administration,
including IBAMA and the Federal Police. Over 20 years ago, with
fewer crimes than today, the Federal Police in Santarém employed
48 agents, five marshals and five lawyers. In September 2002, the
Federal Police office was reduced to a dozen people (most of them
involved in administration), who have to cover more than half of Pará,
an area the size of France. There was no fuel for the police cars.
Electricity, water supply and telephones were cut off at the beginning
of the year due to lack of payment, but were kept working by judicial
orders. The situation became so dire that the Chief Marshall started
paying bills out of her own pocket.84 Conditions at IBAMA’s office in
Santarém were no different.

Even when there is funding for a handful of inspection agents, bribes
become an important source of income for those who work in
remote regions.85 The new IBAMA administration is investigating
various cases of corruption among its own agents in the Amazon.
Recently, the new manager of IBAMA-Santarém, Geraldo Pastana,
created a commission to investigate agents accused of receiving
bribes and having a better lifestyle than their salaries would allow.
On September 16, 2003, the Federal Police arrested three IBAMA
inspectors and ten loggers in the Amazonian state of Rondônia
during an operation against this corruption.86

METHODS COMMONLY USED BY LAND GRABBERS87

The name grilagem comes from a traditional process to
give forged documents the patina of age. Papers were
placed in a box of crickets (grilos). The crickets would
chew and foul the documents, making them appear
worn and older than they actually were. A grileiro is a
land-grabber who “pretends to have legitimate title to
the land through a vast repertoire of deceptions.”88
Below are some common methods used by grileiros to
become ‘owners’ of public land in the Amazon.

Step 1. Grileiro identifies the land for grilagem

Step 2. Grileiro gets control of land, commonly
by the following four methods:

Method A – using invalid rubber concessions
(seringais).
During the 1940s and 1950s, prompted by the
demands of the Second World War, Brazil required
a large production of rubber and granted rubber
concessions that were valid for only one year (i.e. now
illegal). However decades later – mainly during the
1980s – these concession documents were still being
used as a basis for applying for a land title. Most of the
time, the imprecise description of land limits in the title
facilitates the registration of areas much larger than
the original concession. Large areas of the Middle
Land have been illegally privatized based on these
old seringais.

Method B – physical occupation of an area without
any previous physical occupants.
Grileiro arrives in a forest area, demarcates this new
land and guards the area with gunmen.

Method C – use of invalid concessions (sesmarias)
Between 1531 and 1822, concessions of uncultivated
lands called sesmarias89 were assigned to settlers to
work on these lands.90 Recently these old concession
rights have occasionally been used as a basis for
registering land titles, despite the fact that the system
was abolished when Brazil became independent from
Portugal in 1822.91

Method D – occupation, purchase or ‘false renting’
of land occupied physically by others (traditional
settlers, such as ribeirinhos).
When there are several traditional small communities
occupying a chain of small posses92 along a river or a
road, a grileiro purchases all of the posses, or only
some, including those posses at edge of the
communities. He then marks a large area with paths
around communities, claiming the entire area. Those

20

who don’t accept the grileiro’s claims of ownership of
their land are frequently expelled from the area with the
use of violence.

Step 3. Grileiro selects a municipal ‘‘cartório”
(local notary’s office) to declare ownership of
the land.

Normally the grileiro forges papers stating that he has
occupied the area for a long time – or he depends on
the complicity of notaries who declare so. Municipal
Cartórios register the limits of properties located
hundreds of miles away in the forest. Normally they do
not check the validity of the grileiro’s claim, or cross
check the application with existing land titles registered
at other offices.

Step 4. Grileiro submits the Cartório document
to the official land agencies and the Federal
Tax Authority.

Government land agencies93 usually agree to register
the title of uncontested land based on Cartórios’
documents. In theory, a map should be submitted along
with a description of the land, proof of the origin of land
title and testimonies, etc. The official agencies usually
accept these questionable documents from Cartórios
and issue a certificate of registry showing that the
institution is in the process of analyzing the ownership
of land (a precarious document which in theory
recognizes that the grileiro is in possession of the land
until further decision). Therefore, overlapping land claims
are very common. The land agency can issue a
possession title, can sell or even donate the land in the
cases of ‘relevant economic or social interest’. In the
two last cases, the land will have a definitive title
(escritura definitiva) of property. By law, if the total land
area is greater than 2,500 hectares, its purchase or
donation must be approved by the Congress. To avoid
this complication, the grileiro registers multiple posses
of less than 2,500 hectares each under the names of
multiple people, some of whom may be ‘ghosts’, saying
he is leasing the land for a project, such as logging (see
Crime File 3 – Grupo Madenorte, page 43).

Usually, the grileiro registers the documents at the State
agency (which is ITERPA in the case of Pará), as well
as at INCRA (the Federal agency) and even at the
Receita Federal (the Brazilian Tax Authority). The
objective is to cross-register the fraud giving the
consistent appearance of legality.94

MIDDLE LAND UNDER SIEGE BY LAND
GRABBERS, LOGGERS AND FARMERS

Situated between the Xingu and Tapajós rivers, the Middle Land is
one of the largest relatively undisturbed areas of rainforest in the
eastern Amazon. Surrounded by Indian lands, the Middle Land
covers over 8 million hectares, an area about the size of Austria.95
Most of the Middle Land is located in the municipalities of Altamira
and São Félix do Xingu, with a small part in the municipality of
Trairão.

The presence of indigenous groups, natural geographic barriers such
as rivers with strong variations in water level and the inaccessibility of
the area have contributed to making the Middle Land one of the
most biologically unknown regions in the Amazon.96 The best studies
available are still those carried out by the RADAM project in the
1970s, when the Brazilian government mapped the whole Amazon
by satellite. In the same decade, some scientific expeditions explored
the Tapajós river valley. In 1990, more than 100 scientists and
researchers participated in “Workshop 90” in Manaus to define
priority areas for conservation in the Amazon. As a result, two large
areas in the Middle Land, showing a very high level of endemism
(species only found in this area) and many rare or threatened
species of fauna and flora, were considered “very high priority” for
conservation.97

The region is of critical importance to Indian communities and to
wildlife, sheltering numerous species including jaguars, giant
alligators, spider monkeys and anteaters. The largest remaining
concentrations of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) in Brazil are
located inside the Middle Land and the surrounding Indian Lands.

The Indian Lands and the Middle Land were invaded by miners in the
1970s and loggers in the 1980s. Even though not all Indian Lands in
the region are demarcated, they have some status of legal
protection. The Middle Land is, however, currently legally
unprotected – either on paper or otherwise. Various parties have
claimed the vast majority of the area by using invalid rubber
concessions (seringais) granted in the 1940s and 1950s.98

Most of the Middle Land is under the jurisdiction of the Pará State
land institution, ITERPA, but part is regulated by INCRA. With the
Brazilian government’s suspension of the exploitation and trade in
mahogany in October 2001, there are no FMPs are currently legally
authorized in the Middle Land.

According to a private map drawn up in the 1980s, a total area
covering 6.1 million hectares was based on 21 individual seringais.99
A number of these and other properties in the region have since
been sub-divided or sold on to third parties and have been under
investigation by INCRA since 1999.100 The investigation has dealt
with a total area on paper covering some 118,000 km2, equal to
around three-quarters of the municipality of Altamira, and suspected
of being illegally held.101

21

According to a private map of the Middle Land
drawn up in the 1980s, land ownership
covering 6.1 million hectares was based on
21 invalid rubber concessions (seringais).

Step 5. Grileiro applies for a permit to
exploit the area
When the grileiro wants to log the land or raise
cattle, he has to apply to IBAMA, the Federal
environment agency, to get approval for a Forest
Management Plan (FMP) or a Deforestation
Permit, providing proof of land ownership. Prior
to 2000, IBAMA used to issue authorizations
based on either a declaration (Declaração) from
ITERPA or INCRA, or a contract of sale or
purchase between individuals (Escritura de
Compra e Venda) from a Cartório.

Since August 2003, IBAMA, due to rampant
forgeries, no longer accepts precarious
contracts of sale or purchase issued by
Cartórios and ‘ITERPA declarations’’ as
legitimate proof of final land title and does not
authorize deforestation or FMPs based on these
documents.

CECILIOLAND

Two of the properties in the Middle Land, which have been under
investigation by INCRA are Fazenda Curuá and Fazenda Xingu,
covering some 7 million hectares claimed through the company C.R.
Almeida,102 which was founded by Cecílio do Rego Almeida.103 In
1995, Cecílio obtained control of a company named INCENXIL,104
whose owners, according to him, had a mortgage on 4.7 million
hectares of land with the Bank of Pará.105 After analyzing maps and
documents, ITERPA stated that the area, named Fazenda Curuá,
had in fact 5.7 million hectares.106

In August 1996, ITERPA launched a lawsuit in the local court in
Altamira to cancel the registry of Fazenda Curuá107 but Cecílio’s
lawyers issued a counter-attack. However, the long legal battle has
been complicated by the fact that Fazenda Curuá includes three
indigenous lands (Xipaia, Curuaia and Kayapó-Baú-Mekragnoti), one
National Forest, four settlement areas (two under ITERPA and two
under INCRA) and one area belonging to the Brazilian Armed
Forces. There are also about 200 families of ribeirinhos and
extractivists who have lived in the area since the 1940s.108 In March
2003, the Federal Prosecution office in Belém asked the Federal
Justice in Santarém to cancel all land titles and registries of Fazenda
Curuá claimed by C.R. Almeida at the Cartório de Altamira (4.7
million hectares).109 In the same document he also laid criminal
charges against the seven people involved, including the Cartório de
Altamira’s notary and her brother.110 According to the newspaper O
Liberal, Cecílio was excluded on the grounds that he was older than
70 (i.e. protected by the Brazilian law).111

Veja magazine, which dedicated a feature story to Cecílio, stated
that the price of the land was R$6 million (some US$1 per hectare
at the time). According to Veja, the size of ‘Cecíloland’ increased in
1997 when he bought several continuous areas of original seringais
totaling 1.2 million hectares. The seringais were inherited by the
brothers Moura along the Xingu River and were later registered as
Fazenda Xingu. Veja accused Cecílio of being the largest grileiro in
the world, controlling an area with billions of dollars worth of
mahogany. Cecílio brought a court case against Veja, attacking the
publication in an interview with Istoé magazine a week later,112 in
which he said that Fazenda Curuá was owned by his son, Roberto
B. Almeida, and the company Rondon Projetos Ecológicos,
controlled by C.R. Almeida.113 Cecílio told Istoé that he wants to
develop ‘ecological projects’ in the region. Rondon commissioned a
consultancy company named Phorum to produce a substantial study,
called Amazônia: Floresta para Sempre (Amazon: Forest forever).114
This has not, however, been implemented.115(cid:19)

In October 2001, Greenpeace visited and investigated Cecílioland,
and, during a joint operation with IBAMA, seized, outside the area
claimed by C.R. Almeida, 7,165 m3 of mahogany and 1,169 m3 of
cedar illegally extracted in the Middle Land. At the time, Cecílio’s
company INCENXIL had received a mandate from the judge of
Altamira to seize timber stolen from Fazenda Curuá.116 INCENXIL
accused the mahogany king Osmar Ferreira of being responsible for
the illegal harvesting.117 Greenpeace and IBAMA landed their planes
on an airstrip at the region known as Entre Rios, property of C.R.

22

Veja magazine have accused Cecílio of being
the largest grileiro (land grabber) in the world,
controlling an area with billions of dollars worth
of mahogany.

Almeida, and were well received by a C.R.
Almeida lawyer, who stated that the company
was protecting a large area of Pará from being
invaded by grileiros and loggers. Later, through
his lawyers, C.R. Almeida claimed ownership
of all timber – those logs seized by his team
and those seized by IBAMA. The judge of
Santarém, however, decided in favor of IBAMA
and ordered the timber to be donated to
local communities.118

THE ASSAULT

Despite numerous investigations and legal proceedings being
initiated by various government departments against grilagem, the
illegal assault on the Middle Land has long since begun, leaving the
law behind. Logging and cattle ranching are the main driving forces
behind the five advancing frontiers into the Middle Land.

Southeast frontier – São Félix do Xingu

•
Invasion 1: From the southeast, loggers and cattle ranchers are
leading the advancing frontier towards the heart of the Middle Land
from the town of São Félix do Xingu, on the right bank of the Xingu
River. This is by far the most aggressive of all the advancing frontiers.

São Félix is a traditional mahogany logging town at the end of a
250 km section of unpaved road which connects it to the town of
Xinguara on the state road PA-150. Cattle farms have replaced the
rich forests alongside the Xinguara-São Félix road following many
years of intensive logging for mahogany. For many years, the Xingu
River has contained the advance of the farming frontier.

In response to the decreasing availability of high value species and
new land for cattle farming in other areas, the natural barrier of the
Rio Xingu has been crossed. An ex-mining road, linking the Rio
Xingu to Vila Canopus, a mining settlement on the Rio Iriri, has
become a principal route of the invasion for loggers and large
fazendeiros into the heart of the Middle Land.119 From this main road,
loggers have opened over 600 km of illegal roads to reach
mahogany trees.120 The majority of loggers came from the logging
region covering Redenção, Rio Maria, Xinguara, Tucumã, Ourilândia
and São Félix do Xingu, all of them traditional mahogany towns until
a few years ago. Many are linked in some way to the mahogany
kings – Osmar Alves Ferreira and Moisés Carvalho Pereira – who
are notorious for logging inside indigenous lands.121

These illegal logging roads form an extensive secondary road
network between the Rio Xingu and Rio Iriri, offering entry points for
loggers and farmers.122 During late August 2003, Greenpeace
conducted aerial monitoring – between Itaituba, in the northwest of
the Middle Land, and Vila Canopus in the center of the Middle Land
– and documented massive areas of large-scale illegal deforestation.
A number were already burned or ready to be burned, but others
were already in green pasture with cattle. At the current rate in the
region, illegal deforestation is soon likely to cross Rio Iriri to the
BR-163, the Cuiabá-Santarém Highway at the west of the Middle
Land.125

In July 2003, an agent of IBAMA and the Federal Police
apprehended a truck transporting 3,500 liters of herbicide in 175
barrels. According to the manager of IBAMA-Pará, Marcílio Monteiro,
the toxic chemical,126 similar to the ‘Agent Orange’ used by the
Americans during the Vietnam War, was to be used to deforest an
area of the Middle Land near São Félix.123

Western frontier – Novo Progresso

The illegal assault on the Middle Land has long
since begun, leaving the law behind. Logging
and cattle ranching are the main driving forces
behind the five advancing frontiers into the
Middle Land.

23,000 inhabitants 750 km south of Santarém. Companies moved
to the town of Novo Progresso along the Cuiabá – Santarém
highway (BR-163) during the late 1990s with the expectation that it
would be paved. In 1998, there were nine active sawmills,
consuming around 300,000 m3 of logs a year. In 2001, the industry
was in boom as the consumption of timber increased to 700,000 m3
of logs a year, with around 60 sawmills operating.128 There are now
around 200 mills in the region,127 a number which will surely only
increase when the road is paved.

Conflict over land and the rich forests of the Middle Land is rampant
in this area. In July 2002, a rural workers’ leader known as ‘Brasília’
(Bartolomeu Morais da Silva), was assassinated one month after
sending a letter to the authorities denouncing threats he and local
families were receiving from loggers and farmers. In the letter,
entitled Revolt of the settlers, Brasília described in detail how the
local police were colluding with farmers and gunmen to threaten and
expel families that denounced grilagem.128

In late 2002, a group of French journalists who went to Novo
Progresso were expelled by armed loggers and farmers, arriving at
their hotel in seven pickup trucks. The pilot of the chartered airplane
and their guide were threatened with death. According to one of the
journalists, a farmer told them that the “BR-163 is not yet paved
because of pressures from Greenpeace and WWF”. Another of the
gang, mistaking the French journalists for Americans, stated: “You
already killed all your Indians. Leave us in peace to kill ours”.131

The paving of the BR-163, yet to be decided by the new Lula
government, is predicted to induce massive deforestation in the
region, increasing the exposure of the Middle Land to destructive
logging and agriculture. In an article published in Science magazine,
it is forecast that up to 49,000 km2 of forest will be destroyed within
the next 25 to 35 years by the paving of the road, with a similar area
put at risk of fire.129

The asphalt will make it cheaper and quicker to transport timber to
the port of Santarém for export and to the domestic markets in the
south of Brazil, providing the motivation for a second and third wave
of loggers to exploit low-to-middle value timber species.130 Crop
producers from Mato Grosso State are also pushing for the Federal
government to pave the BR-163. This will provide easy access to the
port facilities in Santarém, which is becoming a major point of export
for ships accessing the Atlantic Ocean via the Amazon River.

The section of BR-163 already paved in Mato Grosso illustrates
what the future holds in store for the highway in Pará. Fifty-seven
percent of the area immediately along BR-163 in Mato Grosso is
already deforested, while the buffer along the unpaved road as far as
Santarém is only nine percent deforested. Novo Progresso, however,
has had the largest increase in deforestation rate between 2000 and
2001 – some 340 percent. In 2001, 225 km2 of forest was cut down
and in 2002, 767 km2.132

25

In response to the decreasing availability of
high value species, an ex-mining road has
become a principal route of the invasion for
loggers and large cattle ranchers into the heart
of the Middle Land. From this main road,
loggers have opened over 600 km of illegal
roads to reach mahogany trees.

Recent satellite data analyzed by Greenpeace shows that two illegal
logging roads from the BR-163 have extended across the Baú
indigenous lands and reached the Rio Curuá. Many other illegal road
networks are developing on the east side of the BR-163.

In 2000, Greenpeace investigated an illegal
road opened by the company Porbras on the
Xingu River.

From the northwest – Trairão

•
Invasion 3: This invasion of the Middle Land, from the Itaituba and
Santarém part of the Cuiabá-Santarém highway (BR-163),133 is
being led by the loggers and followed by large cattle ranchers.134

Already a network of illegal logging roads is developing, and during
Greenpeace’s aerial monitoring in the region in late August many
areas of deforestation were observed.

From the north – Transamazônica Highway

•
Along the Transamazônica Highway, loggers, cattle ranchers and
governmental settlement projects are leading the advancing frontier
from the north from the following two locations:

Ruropólis Municipality
Invasion 4: In Ruropólis Municipality – towards the mouth of Riozinho
do Anfrísio – the advance is from a mixture of governmental
settlement projects and also logging and cattle ranching.

Uruará Municipality
Invasion 5: In Uruará Municipality an illegal logging road, known as
the Trans-Iriri road, now crosses the indigenous land of the
Cachoeira Seca do Iriri and meets the Rio Iriri, which has become an
important route for smuggling illegal logs to feed mills in the region.
In Uruará there are powerful economic groups involved in logging in
the Middle Land, including Uruará Madeireira Ltda (considered by
IBAMA to belong to Osmar Ferreira, one of the mahogany kings)
and Vargas and Vargas Ltda.135

‘THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY IS BROKEN HERE’

The long-standing absence of any legitimate
government in the Middle Land region has the ultimate
irony. Much of the local population has become
dependent for their very livelihoods on an economy
rooted in illegal operations by loggers and farmers and
see no alternative but to stand alongside them in
opposition to government intervention.

In March 2003, the Minister of Justice, Dr Márcio
Thomaz Bastos received a dossier136 on organized crime
in the south of Pará, including the Middle Land. The
dossier, produced by the Institute of Amazon Studies
(Instituto de Estudos Amazônicos – IEA), showed the
connection between the violence in the region and
grilagem, the illegal extraction of wood in Indian Lands,
traffic of guns and drugs, and bio-piracy. The report
listed various large farms – Três Poderes, J. Veríssimo,
Santa Cruz, Tibórnia, Santa Cristina and Belauto,
“under the control of criminals and defended with
heavy weapons”. One of the cases reported was the
invasion by three gunmen of the farm Barra do Triunfo,
in São Felix do Xingu. During the invasion, the rural
worker Antônio Queiroz was murdered – shot 16 times.
Three other workers were wounded. “The wounded
and the dead were transported to São Félix, where no
help could be found, not from the police, not from the
local hospital.” The hospital director was threatened by
an anonymous caller stating that “none of the workers
injured would remain alive to tell the story”.137

This relationship between violence, farming and illegal
logging in Pará has attracted the attention of the
Brazilian press. O Liberal, reported the case of two
farms, Terra Roxa I and Terra Roxa II, composed of 35
contiguous plots of 4,356 hectares, totalling 152,460
hectares in São Félix do Xingu: “Men with heavy
weapons [were] hidden there.”138 The area was sold by
Madeireira Serra Dourada Ltda to the companies
Aluminal Com. e Participações and Agropecuária
Caraíbas Ltda, according to a contract of sale and
purchase obtained by the newspaper. O Liberal stated
that Serra Dourada belongs to the mahogany king
Osmar Ferreira. This company has record of numerous
infractions in IBAMA’s files for illegal logging and their
operations were suspended by IBAMA in 2001. The
area controlled by Serra Dourada technically could not
be sold as it is public land, grilada from Pará State,
INCRA and Indian Lands. In spite of this, the land was
sold. The contract between Serra Dourada and the two
companies obligated the buyers to “extract all trees of
the species mahogany and cedar in the area”.139 The
area was later invaded again by at least seven men,140

and the two companies, who had purchased illegal
land, went to the courts to demand the removal of the
invaders, and the return of the land to the companies.

According to ITERPA, however, the 35 plots were not
located in the places described in the sales contract.
“The grileiros got 35 areas spread throughout the
region and put them all together in a paper, and
registered them at the cartórios in Altamira and São
Félix ... these two cartórios are famous for supplying
false documents to grileiros and are now under the
control of the State Justice Tribunal.”141

According to O Liberal, Antonio Lucena Barros
(‘Maranhense’) has been under prosecution by the
Federal Court of Marabá since 1998 for illegal
mahogany logging inside the Kayapó Indian Reserve.
IBAMA suspects that he is linked to the mahogany king
Moisés Carvalho Pereira, a powerful man in
Redenção.142 Maranhense has a long criminal file. He
was arrested in Redenção on 26 February 2003 by the
Federal Police after being accused by five federal
prosecutors143 of numerous crimes, including slavery
and destruction of protected areas. His arrest was
ordered by the Judge of Marabá, Herculano Nacif.

In October 2002 the TV network, Record, aired a
special program about São Félix do Xingu and the
region of Porto de Moz. Record TV accompanied 70
agents of IBAMA and the Federal Police in a raid on the
logging towns on the Xinguara-São Félix do Xingu
Road, and discovered that bridges had been sabotaged
in an attempt to stop the official convoy from arriving in
São Félix. The agents inspected 8 sawmills along the
road and seized both mahogany logs and sawn
mahogany.144 The manager of one sawmill was arrested
and transported to Marabá. In São Félix, the agents
were received by a mob of angry farmers and loggers,
accompanied by some small landholders. Although they
were heavily armed, the agents were obliged to leave
the town after being trapped by the mob in a restaurant.
Record TV described the conflict as the fight between
‘the real Brazil’ (loggers and farmers) and ‘the official
Brazil’ (the government trying to enforce the law).

“What is happening here is that the principle of
authority is broken”, explained IBAMA agent Julio
Silva.145 His point was that because farmers and loggers
have become the only significant economic force in the
region, much of the populations in the towns have
become dependent on these industries, and fight
alongside them against the government.

GOVERNMENT FUNDED PROPOSAL
TO PROTECT THE MIDDLE LAND GATHERS DUST

In 2002, as a late reaction to the exposure of illegal
mahogany logging in the Middle Land, the Federal
government commissioned ISA – an important Brazilian
NGO – to produce a conservation proposal for the area.

The result was a proposal for a network of conservation
units throughout the Middle Land, including National
Forests, Indigenous Lands and Extractive Reserves. To
date, this proposal remains locked in a drawer in the
offices of the Federal government. NGOs and local

28

communities recently decided to take ‘ownership’ of the
maps and demand the proposal’s implementation with a
participatory planning process that would look at the
suggested zoning.

Greenpeace considers this proposal an important step
towards the objective of protecting the Middle Land
against predatory activities and grilagem. However, a
moratorium on all industrial scale activities in the area is
necessary until the zoning process is complete and the
protected areas are established.

29

Fearing the loss of their traditional lands, and desperate to put an end to illegal and predatory logging, the communities
from Porto de Moz are demanding the creation of an Extractive Reserve in the region.

STATE OF CONFLICT - PORTO DE MOZ

Known as Porto de Moz, the large area of the municipalities of Porto
de Moz and Prainha, on the left margin of the Rio Xingu, has become
the battleground between the forest communities who live in the
region and depend on its natural resources for their survival, and
logging companies who have invaded the area either with or without
official sanction from the authorities.

The area is the eastern part of an immense rectangle named ‘Low
Amazon’ that covers eight million hectares of forest and small rivers
between the Transamazon Highway and the Amazon, Xingu and
Tapajós rivers.148 The Porto de Moz rural area is home to 125
communities with a total population of around 20,000. The area was
first occupied during the rubber boom, which eventually collapsed in
1914. Nowadays, communities’ livelihoods are based on fishing,
hunting, subsistence agriculture and the extraction and sale of forest
products.149

In recent years, the arrival of loggers and disputes over the
communities’ resources have created a situation of violent conflicts.
Many cases of violence and death threats have been reported. The
Brazilian National Report on Human Rights and Environment,
presented to the United Nations High Commissioner on Human

30

Rights in April 2003, chose Porto de Moz as
one of three municipalities in Pará in which to
gather testimonies and accusations of victims
affected by grilagem and violence.150 A number
of the cases are associated with illegal logging,
by the timber industry or large-scale farmers in
these municipalities.

There are almost no local police in Porto de
Moz, and the Federal Police, who could protect
the community leaders and their families, are
285 km away in Santarém. Although they are
the most respected police force in Brazil, the
Federal Police don’t have enough agents to
accomplish their tasks, nor money to transport
agents to the scenes of crimes.

Loggers started to move into the Porto de Moz
region in the early 1990s, to take advantage of
the new markets in medium-value timber
species (such as ipê, jatobá, tauari, cedar, etc.),
and the development of the ports of Santarém
and Breves.151 Most of these logging companies
are small- to medium-sized Brazilian firms, which

supply traditional Amazon wood exporters such as DLH Nordisk,
Eidai, Curuatinga, Rancho da Cabocla and Madesa according to
contracts registered at IBAMA.

The Porto de Moz region has become a new Eldorado for the timber
industry. The rate of logging has rapidly increased in the region. By
2001, a staggering 50,000 cubic meters of logs per month was
being transported along the Rio Jaurucu, a tributary of the Rio
Xingu.152 The Jaurucu has become the principal route for smuggling
illegal logs to feed mills in Santarém as well as mills further away in
Altamira and Belém.153

Greenpeace has identified and mapped 50 FMPs in the region, and
found that between 2001 and 2003, 90 companies directly exploited
or traded timber from the region. Two of these groups are of special
interest due to the size of their operations, the fact that they are
exploiting large forest areas and the methods they use to ensure
their access to wood stocks. The groups are: Grupo Campos and
Grupo Madenorte.

It was in the late 1990s that communities here really started to feel
the impact of the logging companies’ invasion of their traditional
land. At this time the Grupo Campos became the biggest company
in the region, and also achieved political and economic power.
Gérson Salviano Campos was elected Mayor in 1996 and re-elected
in 2000. He appointed half a dozen relatives to positions in his
government, controlling all the institutional space of the municipality,
and dictating the rules in order to exercise local power in economic,
social and environmental planning.154 Led by the mayor, the Grupo
Campos is accused by IBAMA and the Federal Prosecution office of
many irregularities – including illegal logging, grilagem155 and misuse
of federal public funds.156

Also economically and politically influential is Madenorte and its
subsidiary, Marajó Island Business, controlled by the powerful
entrepreneur José Severino Filho. Local communities accuse
Madenorte employees of imposing a regime of fear in the region.157
Another important player is Porto de Moz Ltda, controlled by the
President of the influential AIMEX (the Pará association of timber
exporters).158 There are no reports of violence attributed to this
company. Politically less influential, but economically very aggressive,
is the Portuguese company, Porbras, which has a sawmill in Senador
José Porfírio, a town on the right bank of the Xingu River. In 2000,
Greenpeace investigated an unauthorized road opened by Porbras
on the left bank of the river for the exploitation of the rich stocks of
jatobá and other wood species in Porto de Moz’s forests.

31

“For every 100 families, an average 99
percent have problems with their lands
and the remaining one percent is
threatened with losing their land. Nobody
lives well. To have this life, I believe it is
better to die than live like this.”

Community leader, Porto de Moz Sustainable
Development Committee, September 2002.146

PROPOSED EXTRACTIVE RESERVES –
‘VERDE PARA SEMPRE’ AND ‘RENASCER’

Fearing the loss of their traditional lands, and desperate to put an
end to illegal and predatory logging, in 1999 community leaders
created a resistance movement160 called the Porto de Moz
Sustainable Development Committee.152 In April 2000, the Rural
Workers Union, representing the communities, sent a letter to
INCRA, IBAMA and SECTAM – Pará State’s Department of
Science, Technology and Environment – demanding the creation of
an Extractive Reserve.

The first seminar on the creation of the Extractive Reserve was held
in November 2001 in Porto de Moz and was attended by 300
community leaders who gave the reserve a name: Verde para
Sempre (Green Forever). Two years later, in a similar movement,
local communities of the adjacent rural municipality area of Prainha
(to the west of Porto de Moz) proposed the creation of another
reserve, Renascer.161 The proposed reserves are contiguous and
would together create the largest area of protected forest and river
under the collective control of communities in Brazil, covering around
1.6 million hectares.

The Federal government, through the CNPT (National Center for the
Sustainable Development of Traditional Populations), part of IBAMA,
agreed to initiate studies into the viability of the Verde para Sempre
reserve, but these have yet to be completed due to lack of money
and political will.162(cid:19) Meanwhile, executive powers of the state of Pará
and local mayors have been outspoken in their opposition to the
creation of the reserve. The President of ITERPA-Pará, Ronaldo
Barata, wrote to the then State Governor, Almir Gabriel, claiming:
“If an extractive reserve is established in the area, it would be a
serious impediment to the economic development of the region,
since the principles on which the idea of an extractive reserve are
based contain very restrictive measures.”163

Also opposing the Verde para Sempre reserve are the Mayors of
Porto de Moz and Painha, both from the PSDB political party, the
party of former Governor Almir Gabriel and of the new Governor
Simão Jatene, elected in October 2002. Gerson Campos, Mayor
ofPorto de Moz, expressed his opposition to the reserve in an
interview with Greenpeace in 2002.164 Gandor Hage, Mayor of
Painha, “incited scenes of violence” at a public meeting discussing
the creation of the reserve in February 2002, according to an IBAMA
press release.165 O Liberal newspaper reported that he tore up the
book of signatures of community members and delegates who had
attended the meeting.166 Hage had been officially invited to
participate in the meeting by CNPT/IBAMA as part of the
assessment process for the creation of the reserve.

At the time of writing this report, the Extractive Reserve remains only
an area defined on an IBAMA map and an incomplete set of viability
studies. What is missing is the political will of the Federal and State
governments to resolve their differences.

Tired of waiting, in September 2002 about 400 community members
blocked the Rio Jaurucu, to protest against the destruction of their

land rights and protect their natural resources.

forests and to ask for the creation of the Verde
para Sempre reserve. During the protest, metal
barges loaded with illegal logs exploited by the
Campos Group were stopped and later seized
by IBAMA. The company received two fines167
by IBAMA, totaling R$196,291.50 (around
US$67,000).168 A day after the blockade, some
community people, journalists and activists
received death threats and were physically
attacked on arriving in the city of Porto de Moz.
In a national TV broadcast, a journalist from the
Record TV network accused Mayor Campos of
inciting violence, which she and her crew had
suffered.169

Since the river blockade, the anger of the
loggers in the Porto de Moz region against local
communities and their leaders and the
opposition to the creation of Verde para
Sempre has increased – as have the risks for
social movements. For example, on the day a
public meeting was held to announce the
National Report to the UN High Commissioner
on Human Rights, a local leader, Mr Idalino
Nunes Assis, received a phone call warning him
not to go out of his house at night, or he would
run the risk of being killed170 (see Crime File 1:
Grupo Campos, page 38–41).

Tired of waiting, in September 2002(cid:19) about 400 community members blocked the Rio Jaurucu, to protest against the
destruction of their forests. Greenpeace supported their activities.

EXTRACTIVE RESERVES

“Today RESEX is the only judicial instrument
which recognises the right of ribeirinhos
to the land.”

Felício Pontes Jr., Pará Federal Public Prosecutor –
April 2003171

Extractive Reserves (RESEX) are areas protected by
law designated for the conservation and sustainable
management of natural resources by the traditional
communities inhabiting them. This model was
developed in the 1980s by forest dwellers under the
leadership of Chico Mendes and the National Council
of Rubber Tappers (CNS) and adopted by the Brazilian
Federal government in 1990.

These reserves guarantee local families the collective
right to land and its natural resources, allowing them to
support themselves by their traditional economic
activities, while preserving the environment.

The responsibility to create a RESEX lies with the
Federal government, but it is up to local communities to
team up and request its creation.

The murder of Chico Mendes by farmers in December
1988 led to his worldwide recognition as an
environmental martyr. In 1990, the Federal government
issued the Extractive Reserves General Decree164 which
established the legal basis for the creation of such
areas. In March 1990, the Brazilian government created
the ‘Extractive Reserve Chico Mendes’, covering
970,570 hectares in the Amazon state of Acre. Since
then, another 12 reserves have been created in the
Amazon, giving collective ownership and control to local
communities in a total area of 3.5 million hectares.

A further law from 2000, and a Decree issued in 2002,
proclaims that Conservation Units should be created
throughout the national territory as an instrument for
consolidating public environmental protection policies
established by the Ministry of the Environment.

33

“Declarations of posse (possession)
and other precarious instruments
supplied by state and federal land
agencies are vague and imprecise,
and do not offer legal security for
environmental authority decisions
on forest management plans or
deforestation authorizations.”

IBAMA’s President Marcus Barros,
August 2003.

SECTION 3

PARTNERS IN CRIME

Between 2001 and 2003, 90 companies were identified by
Greenpeace as trading in logs or sawnwood originating in the
proposed extractive reserves all directly exploiting the forests in
the region.166

Most of the 90 companies are small- or medium-sized national
companies. However, toward the end of the processing chain, there
are large exporters, such as Curuatinga, Rancho da Cabocla,
Madesa, Eidai and DLH Nordisk.174

Three of the identified companies, Grupo Campos, Comabil
(Madeireira Biancardi) and Grupo Madenorte, have been accused of
involvement in violence against local community members and
activists in the Porto de Moz region.175

Greenpeace’s investigation identified and mapped FMPs in the
region of Porto de Moz and Prainha. All areas have been mapped by
Greenpeace using information and data from IBAMA, and include
land titles and/or maps of the FMP as presented by the proponents
(see map on page 36–37). Not all of the FMPs show the full
delimitation of their area as some documents contain no
geographical reference perimeters: these projects are included on
the map, but the exact geographic limits are unknown (see case
study on page 35).

34

CASE STUDY OF PUBLIC LAND APPROPRIATION BY LOGGING
COMPANIES IN PORTO DE MOZ AND PRAINHA

In total, 54 FMPs were submitted to IBAMA between
1991 and 2003 in the region of Porto de Moz and
Prainha. Of these, 48 are located in the municipality of
Porto de Moz, and six in Prainha. However, another
FMP, located in Medicilandai, just outside Porto de Moz,
was identified and mapped as it was harvesting
timber176 inside the areas proposed by the local
communities for the Extractive Reserves Verde para
Sempre and Renascer, and their surrounding areas (see
Crime File 2: Comabil, page 41).177 The total number of
FMPs mapped is therefore 55.

Of these 55 FMPs, 26 were submitted between 1991
and 2000 and covered a total area of 92,879 hectares.
Since 2000, 20 more new FMPs were officially
submitted to IBAMA, adding 184,434 hectares to the
total area of proposed exploitation of 277,314 hectares.

All six FMPs in the region of Prainha were submitted to
IBAMA between 2000 and 2003, covering an area of
87,322 hectares. There are other FMPs in the area but
insufficient information exists to plot them on the map.

Of the grand total of 48 plans in Porto de Moz
Municipality submitted to IBAMA between 1991 and
2003, only four are outside the area requested by the
communities to become registered as an Extractive
Reserve. Three of these plans are on the right bank of
the Xingu River: the ones under the names of Rivaldo
Salviano Campos (brother of the Mayor of Porto de
Moz, Gerson Campos),178 Dilcilene Tenório de Souza
(wife of Mayor Campos)179 and Magebras (Madeiras
Gerais do Brasil),180 near the town of Senador José
Porfírio. The fourth plan, Madeireira Cruz Machado,181 is
near the village of Vitoria do Xingu.

All 26 FMPs submitted to IBAMA between 1991 and
2000 contain a copy of a ‘contract (escritura) of sale
and purchase’ registered by a Cartório (registry office)
as proof of land ownership. However, in 13 cases, the
escrituras did not supply sufficient proof of the chain of
custody of ownership, which is necessary to prove legal
title of the land, and therefore cannot be considered
‘legal’. Of the remaining 13 FMPs, Greenpeace is

awaiting additional information from ITERPA.

After 2000, the practice of showing land ownership
changed: only three of 29 FMPs submitted to IBAMA
contained an escritura as the land title document. The
other 26 FMPs, totalling 166,336 hectares, included an
‘ITERPA declaration’ as the land title document. One, in
the name of Francisco Cunha da Silva, covering 2,515
hectares, introduces an ‘innovation’: it is based on an
‘authorization of use of public state property’182 issued
by the President of ITERPA. Another one has no data
yet available. The remaining 24 FMPs are located within
public lands and therefore are not eligible for an IBAMA
authorization for exploitation, as confirmed by IBAMA’s
memorandum No. 001/Diref/Proge of 12 August 2003.183
The memo instructed executive managers not to
approve any FMPs or deforestation plans based on land
agency declarations, including those from ITERPA.184

Among 29 FMPs submitted between 2001 and 2003,
five were submitted by the company Madenorte in Porto
de Moz and Prainha, to harvest areas leased from 50
people claiming ownership of public land. Another three
are under the names of individuals from the same list of
Madenorte leasers. Three FMPs in Porto de Moz are
registered in the names of shareholders of the
Santarém based company Curuatinga, and one is in the
name of Rivaldo Campos (shareholder of Maturu
sawmill and brother of Mayor Campos). One FMP is in
the name of Elias Salame, president of AIMEX, the Para
Association of Timber Products Exporters.

In a letter to INCRA (the Federal land agency) IBAMA’s
President Marcus Barros states that “declarations of
posse (possession) and other precarious instruments
supplied by state and federal land agencies are vague
and imprecise, and do not offer legal security for
environmental authority decisions on forest
management plans or deforestation authorizations.”185
IBAMA also makes clear that documents “of lease or
other means of use and temporary possession of
public land contracted between individuals cannot be
accepted by IBAMA for authorization of deforestation
and forest management plans.”186

Salviano Campos. He is joint owner of the sawmill Exportadora
Cariny. Two of his brothers, Rivaldo Salviano Campos (a city
councilor in Porto de Moz) and Francimeire Saviano Campos (a
lawyer), are co-owners of Indústria Madeireira Maturu Ltda (Maturu).
The Campos brothers are also among the biggest cattle ranchers of
the municipality, holding around 5,000 to 6,000 stock.188

Maturu has contracts to purchase logs from at least two companies,
Marajó Island Business (Grupo Madenorte) and Acaraí Comércio e
Transporte Rodofluvial Ltda, both accused of involvement in illegal
logging.189 In 2001, Maturu supplied 5,167 m3 of sawn wood to
Nordisk Timber Ltda (DLH Group).190 In the same year, 150 sawmills
in Pará supplied Nordisk, four of which, including Maturu, were
involved in illegal operations in the Porto de Moz region.191

Mayor Campos is now one of the biggest landowners in the
municipality, with 100,000 hectares or perhaps two to three times
that area. He claims to own land that is considered to be federal
public land – a farm that invades the Caxiuanã National Forest and
the Pracupi settlement area, which was already demarcated by
INCRA. The Federal Public Prosecution Office has denounced
Campos for involvement in “fraud and grilagem”.192 He has also
received fines for deforestation.193

CASE IN POINT
The case which most illustrates the Campos family’s involvement in
forest crime is that of the trade between Maturu and Nordisk –
documented by an inspector from the Belém branch of IBAMA,
Formentini. Although there is ample evidence of crime in this case,
including documents and videos, the final report was never acted
upon by IBAMA itself.

In August 2002, an IBAMA inspection team discovered a sawmill
operating illegally, close to Rio Maruá, near the Caxiuanã National
Forest. The sawmill belongs to Rivaldo Campos, the joint owner of
Maturu.194 At the sawmill, the inspection team found 227 packages
of special gauge sawn timber (angelim vermelho and maçaranduba)
and 381 m3 of logs (cumaru and jatobá). A document bearing
Nordisk’s name was reportedly found with the sawn timber, which
was ready for export. In addition, 476 logs (around 853 m3) of jatobá,
maçaranduba, muiracatiara, angelim vermelho and angelim pedra
were located in the forest during the investigation.195

Although the timber and documents were seized by IBAMA and
Rivaldo Campos was fined R$212,583 (US$70,000), Formentini’s
report explains that when IBAMA agents returned to the area they
found that the confiscated sawn timber was gone and had already
been sent to Breves to be exported. Also the confiscated logs had
been loaded onto a barge, the Rainha de Rondônia, with a tugboat
Comandante Campos III, ready to be brought to the Maturu sawmill,
at the request of Rivaldo Campos. Three police officers were then
appointed to accompany the tugboat with the confiscated wood and
machinery, to transfer it to Breves. According to Formentini, Mayor
Campos intervened in the confiscation, with the intention of stopping

Mayor of Porto de Moz, September 2002.

In August 2002, an IBAMA inspection team
discovered an illegal sawmill belonging to
Rivaldo Campos, the joint owner of Maturu.
At the sawmill, a document bearing Nordisk’s
name was reportedly found with the sawn
timber, which was ready for export.

“So he [Mayor] sent a group of soldiers
to humiliate me so that I would sign a
document, probably so that I would
authorize them to pull down my fence,
as they did. His gangsters were all
armed, with revolvers, machine guns.
My son asked if [they] had brought any
judicial order for this. And they brought
four chainsaws to destroy my fence.”

of age from Colônia Majari, Porto de Moz.

its transfer to Breves. Also, an unknown woman came to inform them
that Rivaldo Campos would be “calling some armed people, to
lynch the team, topple the boat and, even, if it would be the case, to
reach ultimate consequences.”196

Ultimately, Mayor Campos managed to become the legal depository
of all the confiscated goods, according to the then Executive
Manager of IBAMA-Belém. According to Formentini, Mayor Campos
asked him “several times” how much he wanted to be paid to keep
quiet about the wood in Breves. The inspection team went to Breves
to identify the confiscated sawn timber. However they received an
urgent call from the Executive Manager of IBAMA to return to Belém.
Two days later, IBAMA-Breves office staff reported to the IBAMA-
Belém office that there were authorizations for some of the wood in
question. Two weeks later, Formentini was discharged.197 The then
head of IBAMA-Belém explained to Greenpeace that Formentini was
punished not because of the substance of his report but for his lack
of respect for authority as a manager of IBAMA. IBAMA-Belém
received a parallel report, written by agents of the state police who
were accompanying Formentini in the investigation to Porto de Moz
and Breves. The police document listed offensive comments made
by Formentini towards his boss.

In September 2002, a month after these incidents, both the metal
barge Rainha de Rondônia and the tug-boat Comandante Campos
III seized by Formentini’s team in August were stopped by a blockade
organized by 400 community people on the Jaurucu river. Both
vessels should have been out of commission pending further judicial
decisions. However, the metal barge was loaded with logs destined
for Maturu, according to the skipper, another brother of Mayor
Campos.198 The logs had no transportation documents (ATPFs).199
Greenpeace has video footage of the pilot saying to an IBAMA agent
that the wood was extracted “in a project up river owned by [José]
Biancardi” (see Crime File 2: Comabil, page 41). In the video, the
pilot states: “This wood is illegal, 100% illegal.”

by Pastor at him. Idalino Nunes Assis of STR stated:
“We came to court asking for a security mandate for
Mr Baiano, and asking also to keep him in his own
land, because he is threatened and people said that
they want revenge and to take him from his land.
Mr Baiano has been living on that land for more than
40 years.”

Farmers Cândido Pinheiro Sanches and Lucina Froes
Castro, residents of Rio Quati, Bom Jesus
Community, reported being prosecuted by Mayor
Gérson Campos, alleging invasion of property. The
Mayor is accused of hiring a man to open a trail in the
middle of their land and field, partially destroying their
crops, and threatening the couple’s young children
with death. According to the farmer, at the first
hearing on 27 October 1999, he received an arrest
warrant for refusing to sign a document that forced
him to leave his lands to the mayor’s wife. Eight days
later, a court order authorized the destruction of his
house. Mr Sanches tried to obtain a copy of the
documents to inform his lawyer and constitute it in the
lawsuit, however, the judge denied access to them. In
order to keep his house, the farmer said he signed a
document that forced him to leave the area
immediately. During the trial, the victim reported the
invasion by the Mayor’s loggers into the community
area (11 landowners) to IBAMA. IBAMA confiscated
chainsaws, but three days later the logging started.
The invasion of the other plots continues. According
to Mr. Sanches, João Leite is the person in charge of
carrying out the orders of the Mayor in the field,
including giving support to the court officials when
forcing court decrees, and is always armed. With the
help of the STR lawyer, the farmers won the first
verdict, thus temporarily keeping the land they have
owned for more than 20 years. However, an appeal to
the Tribunal has not yet been heard. The varzea
(flooded forest) area of Mr Sanches’ land is still being
disputed at court by a city councilor, the Mayor and
others. Mr Sanches tried to enroll his children in the
Bolsa Escola (school scholarship) project, but has not
received any reply from the government and suspects
that as an object of political persecution his
application is being kept at the city hall.

The Brazilian National Report to the UN High
Commissioner on Human Rights highlights many cases
of land invasion and violence by the Campos Group.188
The following cases are excerpts from this report:

•

•

João Pinheiro de Souza, a farmer, whose land –
100 hectares along the PA-167 – was reportedly
invaded by Gérson Campos. João tried many times to
discuss a solution with Gérson. However, according
to de Souza, at his last attempt, he was threatened
with death and impeded from working on his land and
getting sustenance for his family because the land
‘belonged’ to the mayor.

•

At Colônia Majari, Senhor Carnaci, a farmer of about
70 years of age, is said to have had his land violently
invaded by Gérson Campos, with participation by
military police. He testified, “On 29 December 2001
the mayor called me and said that from that day on I
cannot put even one nail on my land, which is 500
meters by 1000 meters. He entered 300 meters into
my area. I resolved to make a fence at the limit of my
land and his land. This was when he sent three
armed men to tear away my fence, more than 700
meters. My lawyer told me to put up a fence again.
I did that. So he [Mayor] sent a group of soldiers to
humiliate me so that I would sign a document,
probably so that I would authorize them to pull down
my fence, as they did. His gangsters were all armed,
with revolvers, machine guns. My son asked if (they)
had brought any judicial order for this. And they
brought four chainsaws to destroy my fence. The
mayor’s cows invaded my land and destroyed my
field. I was forced to rent another area…The case is
in the court, but nothing is solved. What I can do is
to stay quiet, wait for the court, for the good will of
the judge. I hope that they can resolve our situation.
I am Brazilian, I have a right to a piece of land. I was
born and grew up in the farm from where I get
sustenance for my family.”

•

In Nazaré Community, a man known as Santo Baiano
had his land invaded by order of Mayor Gérson
Campos. People entered his land to open trails, but
ended up leaving the area because of resistance by
Mr Baiano. The police were called to arrest him, but
STR (Sindicato dos Trabalhadores Rurais) looked for
a judge during the night to communicate the illegal
arrest and Mr Baiano was eventually released. Mr
Baiano accused a gunman known as ‘Pastor’ of
acting under orders of Gérson Campos and showed
as evidence the cartridge of a bullet which was shot

CRIME FILE 2: COMABIL
(MADEIREIRA BIANCARDI)

Separating Verde para Sempre from the Arara Indigenous Land and
the Middle Land, is the town of Medicilândia with 21,000 inhabitants,
14,000 of whom live in rural areas. José Biancardi claims ownership
to 14,173 hectares of forests in the municipality of Medicilândia,
which includes areas in the southern part of Verde para Sempre.

The town of Medicilândia, on the Transamazon Highway, was named
after former President Médici, a general who governed Brazil during
the military dictatorship and conceived the Transamazon Highway
under the banner of “a land without people for people without land”.

Biancardi, who trades with Maturu and other sawmills in the region,
is the owner of the ‘project’ with “100% illegal wood” mentioned by
the pilot of the Comandante Campos during the Jaurucu river
blockade in September 2002 (see Crime File 1: Grupo Campos,
page 38–40). According to the newspaper O Liberal, José Biancardi
is accused of many forest crimes in the region, including illegal
exploitation of timber in the Arara Indigenous Land, at the north of
the Middle Land. The newspaper accused Biancardi of being linked
with the murder of Ademir Federicci (Dema) and of receiving
personal protection from agents of Pará’s Military Police (State
Police).201

In 1999, Biancardi submitted a forest management project to IBAMA-
Santarém under the name of Comabil Ind. Com. Madeireira
Biancardi. He was hoping to exploit 12,000 hectares, producing
41,000m3 of wood in the first year in an area of 1,040 hectares. The
area is located between the Penentecaua and Jaurucu rivers, in the
Porto de Moz region. ITERPA document No.182, dated 9 December
1998, was presented to IBAMA as proof of ownership of the area to
be exploited. However, ITERPA declared on 12 November 2001 that
this document was false. On 30 April 2003, the Legal Department of
IBAMA recommended cancellation of the project. This gave Biancardi
enough time to exploit the land before being stopped by IBAMA.

In July 1999, IBAMA agents seized 140 mahogany logs being
extracted by Comabil in the Arara Indian Reserve. Biancardi and his
partner Constante Trezeciak were both fined.202 Prior to this, both
had been denounced by the Federal Prosecution office for
devastation of another area in the same Indian land.

CASE IN POINT
In October 2003, the police of Altamira arrested José Biancardi,
following the orders of the Judge of Medicilândia. Guns were seized
and a gunman accused of involvement with drug dealing was also
arrested. In an interview on local television, Biancardi claimed his
innocence and said he was a victim of Fetagri (the rural workers
union) and the social movements in the region. According to the
police, there was a large volume of logs in the place where Biancardi
was arrested, which came from the Verde para Sempre.203

“He has people with heavy guns
threatening residents… to protect a

other grileiros”.

Letter from the Rural Workers Union of
Medicilândia to the State Prosecutor Mauro
Mendes, accusing logger Biancardi,
18 September, 2003

A month before his arrest, the Rural Workers Union of Medicilândia
sent a letter192 to the State Prosecutor of Altamira, Mauro Mendes,
accusing Biancardi of grilagem and of closing a secondary road
(known as Travessão 75),205 asking local people for payments for use
of the road. Some 200 settlers live along this road, which departs
north from the Transamazon Highway. It is one of the three main
logging roads draining timber from the proposed reserve Verde para
Sempre area to sawmills in Brasil Novo and Medicilância
municipalities, according to Greenpeace’s own investigations.206

A month before being arrested, Biancardi had asked the Military
Police in Altamira to act against three other loggers who invaded the
forest area he claims to own. On 16 September 2003, four police
officers went to the region, accompanied by José Biancardi,
following the orders of the captain of the Military Police. In a report207
submitted to his commanders three days later, the sub-lieutenant in
charge of the operation claimed that “there is some doubt about the
ownership rights in the complex of properties that constitutes the
area”, mentioning the fact that the land title document submitted to
him by Biancardi was “a term of agreement without legal value”,
filled out by a lieutenant and signed by Biancardi and another man
named Claudio Goiano. The sub-lieutenant states that some
“100,000m3 of wood” was illegally extracted, including Brazil nut
trees which are protected by law. The report says that loggers
“devastated 20,000 hectares”. The police team seized two trucks,
four bulldozers and a chainsaw. According to the sub-lieutenant, his
group also found 546 logs illegally extracted by order of two loggers,
Erich Horst Peper (known as ‘Jiló’), and his brother known as
‘Pipoca’. He states that the logs were due to be transported by a
metal barge to “clandestine sawmills in Porto de Moz”.

The report exposes not only conflicts amongst individual loggers, but
bizarre behavior by the authorities. According to the sub-lieutenant,
Jiló went to the area the next day with a lieutenant and a soldier
under instructions from the Altamira’s captain to liberate “all the
seized equipment and leave the place” until he could get clarification
from IBAMA on the status of exploitation. He obeyed. The sub-
lieutenant also stated in this report that IBAMA had previous
knowledge of the problems as their agents fined Pipoc and Jiló in
2001. “Their embargo didn’t stand for more than a week”, he said in
the report.208

42

In September 2002, a barge loaded with
logs from Biancardi and destined for Maturu
(Grupo Campos) was brought to stand
still by 400 local communities during their
blockade of the Jaurucu river. The skipper,
a brother of Mayor Campos, confirmed with
an IBAMA agent that “this wood is illegal,
100% illegal.”

José Severino Filho, Group Madenorte
FSC Public Meeting in Belém,
3 September 2002

CRIME FILE 3 - GRUPO MADENORTE

Grupo Madenorte is one of the most important players in the area
proposed by the Porto de Moz and Prainha communities as future
extractive reserves.209 The group is controlled by Mr José Severino
Filho, and includes Madenorte S/A Laminados e Compensados,
Norte Madeiras Importação e Exportação Ltda and Marajó Island
Business Ltda.210 They produce sawn timber and plywood, 90% of
which is destined for export, mainly to the USA (55%), Europe
(30%) and Asia (10%).211

Madenorte claims to hold 200,000 hectares of forests in Breves,
Portel, Prainha and Porto de Moz municipalities.212 However, under its
Forest Management Plan (FMP),213 the company claims that the
group has a total area of only 144,700 hectares in three properties:
24,900 in Portel (Fazenda Sta. Catarina); 72,400 in Prainha
(Fazenda Uruará) and other of 47,400 in Porto de Moz, on the left
bank of the Juarucu River (Fazenda Jauruçu).214

Madenorte admits that it would need to have a total area of 360,000
hectares under management (in a 30-year harvesting cycle) in order
to supply their actual timber requirements of 240,000 m3. The group
consumes 175,000m3 of logs per year, of which 60 percent comes
from third parties.215

Documents issued by ITERPA and INCRA, which were submitted by
Madenorte to IBAMA requesting a permit to exploit Fazenda Uruará,
show that the company does not own the land. The areas are leased
from 31 individuals who do not own the land either. Between 2001
and 2002, they made declarations of ownership to the state land
agency ITERPA for various areas, all somewhat smaller than 2,500
hectares.216 Curiously, none of the individuals lives in Porto de Moz:
all have declared that they live in Breves, the town where Madenorte
has its mill. All share the profession of ‘industry worker’. The
coincidences grow: of four of the people, two share identical ID and
CPF (tax)217 numbers and addresses. Analyzing INCRA’s documents,
Greenpeace discovered another curiosity: two individuals born in
1977 declared to INCRA that they had begun occupation of their
area in October 1988 – when one was ten years old and the other
eleven. Greenpeace has checked the names of all 31 individuals to
see if they appeared on the list of more than 2,500 members of STR
– the rural workers union of Porto de Moz. However, none of them
was found to live in the area proposed for the extractive reserve.

Despite this bizarre situation, according to ITERPA documents, all of
these people have legal rights to the land.218 However, IBAMA did
not approve Madenorte’s FMP at the Fazenda Uruará “because land
cannot be leased out by someone who doesn’t own it”.219 Following
this rejection, a number of the individuals submitted new FMPs of
their own to IBAMA, all using the same forest engineer, an employee
of Madenorte, and these plans were approved.220

The various fines received by the group are proof that companies in
Grupo Madenorte have been involved in systematic illegal logging.
Between October 1999 and November 2002, IBAMA issued fines
to the value of at least R$1.1 million – around US$300,000 at
today’s exchange rates.221

43

For the period of October 2002 to April 2003, IBAMA’s records for
Madenorte S/A Laminados e Compensados show 340 sales
transactions between themselves and suppliers of timber.222 An
analysis of the records shows that 193 contain irregularities.

CASE IN POINT
In Rio Arimum, a tributary of Rio Acaraí, a communal area is in
conflict with Madenorte and residents say they suffer threats from
employees who pressure the families to sell their lands. In the
Itapéua Community, neighboring Caroçal (claimed by Madenorte),
people cannot hold a meeting, because the company’s employees
always arrive first to occupy the place, armed, to discourage
participation by the residents.223

Greenpeace, who attended the Porto de Moz community meeting,
observed that the company was accused of grilagem (illegal land
acquisition) and irregularities in their forest management. Roberto
Baunch, the representative of SCS in Brazil, confirmed to
Greenpeace a week later that the certification process was now
paralyzed until the company resolved some of the disputes
presented at the meeting. It remains paralyzed to this day.

Madenorte also claimed that, since July 2002, IBAMA had
authorized its FMP for the Fazenda Caroçal, which the company
claimed to be 56,000 hectares. However, at the Porto de Moz
meeting, representatives of Itapéua Community, adjacent to Fazenda
Caroçal, stated that this is a small area of land of less than 500
hectares, belonging to Mr Edson Tenório, and the lands behind this
fazenda are for his traditional use. Raul Porto, another director of
Madenorte, answered these accusations by saying that ITERPA sold
the lands to the company. However, this contradicts Severino Filho’s
statement at the Belem meeting: “...with the communities we do not
have problems.” Other loggers in the region and small wood
extractors also questioned the legality of these lands.

The National Report to the UN High
Commissioner on Human Rights
documented a number of testimonies
by community members in Porto De Moz –
a number of them involved violence, death
threats and even deaths.

TESTIMONIES BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS LOCATED WITHIN THE
PROPOSED EXTRACTIVE RESERVE VERDE PARA SEMPRE

São Francisco de Assis Community (Igarapé
•
Aí): This area, where 20 to 25 families live, was invaded
by two men, Deti and Nivaldo. In November 2002, the
residents discovered that more than 300 trees had
been logged. Nivaldo refused to pay any money for
these trees but told the farmer who owns the land to
look for another place to live and work. In 1999, the land
of another resident who had lived in the area for 26
years was invaded by a gunman, hired by Nivaldo, and
known to be the manager of his company.

São João Batista Community (Igarapé Juapi):

•
This land was illegally apprehended and sold to a
madeireira who exploits the adjacent region. The
company threatened and intimidated the residents by
invading their homes. They are hindered from working in
the area; in fact, there have been records of people
being killed for doing so.

São João do Cupari Community: A trade unionist

•
who cares for this 13,000 hectares community, where
the residents want to make a management plan, is
indignant to see the madeireiras rapidly snatching land.
The area was demarcated by piques (narrow trails in the
forest, informally accepted as land dividers) by residents
with the help of Laboratório Agroecológico da
Transamazônica (LAET). However, today the land is
surrounded by piques placed by the company Celvapi.
She has been threatened with death because of her
role as a community leader.

The National Report to the UN High Commissioner on
Human Rights documents a number of testimonies by
community members located within the proposed
extractive reserve Verde para Sempre. A number of
them involved violence, death threats and even deaths.

Benção dos Lares Community (Rio Jaurucu):
•
José Orlando Duarte Souto (known as ‘Ponga’) and his
brother invaded this community’s land, demarcated the
area and sold it to Sílvio Tadeu Coimbra, of Santarém.
Coimbra came to Porto de Moz in January 2002,
claiming to be the landowner. Death threats, without any
negotiation proposals, have hindered farmers from
working on their lands since December 2001.

Batata Community (Rio Jaurucu): A farmer, aged

•
76, who has been working on her land for 48 years,
testified that Sílvio Tadeu Coimbra “has personally
threatened me and also sent people to threaten me to
expel me from my land”. She resisted these threats and
her plantations were burned: she says she lost almost
everything.

José Orlando makes death threats to an entire family

who reside in the area named Vista Alegre or Casa
Queimada. The parents and eight children are all
farmers, working in an area which they can only reach
by boat at present, since José Orlando guards a road

the area goes to the company of Senhor Deti. The
family contacted the police and the chief police officer
summoned José Orlando; however, he did not show up
and no other action was taken.

CONCLUSIONS – WHERE IS THE NEW GOVERNMENT?

Although Brazil is the tenth largest economy in the world, it faces
enormous social and economic disparities. Highly sophisticated
upper and middle classes hold most of the assets and opportunities,
while millions of Brazilians are condemned to poverty and hunger.
Land is concentrated in the hands of a few, an inheritance from
colonial times, helping to keep Brazil near the top of world rankings
of inequitable revenue distribution: 10 percent of the population
controls 46.8 percent of the revenue and the bottom 20 percent
controls only 3.6 percent.226

Brazilian President Luís Inácio Lula da Silva was elected to power in
November 2002 on a platform of ending poverty, establishing social
justice and protecting the environment. But he also made a
commitment to keep Brazil attractive to foreign investors and to
recuperate economic growth in order to generate 7.8 million new
jobs. In the current reality of a country lacking strong currency and
weak in law enforcement, these objectives appear contradictory.

During the electoral campaign, the importance of the Amazon was
highlighted by Lula; it was the only region to be the subject of a
thematic paper227 published by the coalition of political parties.228 The
paper, The Role of the Amazon in Brazil’s Development, contains an
extensive diagnosis of the region’s historical problems and potential,
and concludes with a long list of initiatives to be undertaken after
Lula’s election. The promises in this paper helped the ‘left’ to win the
Presidential election for the first time in Brazilian history.

Lula’s coalition recognized that the Amazon’s potential and its vast
territory are vital to the development of the entire nation of more than
170 million people: “The country needs the opportunities offered by
the Amazon and that can’t be found anywhere else on the planet…
however, such opportunities will only exist if the region will be
conserved.”

Lula’s paper proposed a careful shift from the past economic model
of boom and bust cycles of development (“a predatory logic that
ignores the basis of natural reproduction of the ecosystems in the
region”) towards a new development paradigm geared toward social
and environmental justice that respects cultural diversity and
traditional knowledge. This aimed to reverse historical patterns of
unsustainable exploitation of the region’s natural resources that have
brought benefit to a minority of the population. The paper concludes
that the “challenge our government proposes to face in the Amazon
sees environmental investment and the sustainable use of natural
resources as an opportunity for development that encompasses
social concerns.”

46

According to Lula’s platform for the Amazon, “the region must
generate social and economic opportunities based on its rich
biodiversity and natural resources, on its population, and on the
environmental services the region provides to the rest of the country
and the planet. A priority is to manage, on a sustainable basis,
activities contributing to deforestation, including the use of fire for
land clearing, and logging extraction, whose impacts threaten
regional and global climate change, loss of biodiversity and
degradation of hydrological regimes affecting all of society”.

Despite the good intentions of the Presidential campaign, the new
four-year plan of government submitted to Brazil’s Congress in
September 2003 – Plano Brasil para Todos (Brazil for Everyone
Plan) – shows clear signs of heading in another direction. The plan,
known as PPA (Multi-Annual Plan), is the result of a series of public
hearings in all Brazilian states, coordinated by the Ministry of
Planning.

Lula’s government intends to invest R$1.85 trillion (US$620 billion)
from the Federal budget between 2004 and 2007 in programs
aiming to ensure social inclusion, reduce social disparities and kick-
start economic growth. The Plan aims for an annual economic
growth of 5% by 2007 (GDP), at the same time reducing inflation to
4%. This development will be “environmentally sustainable and will
reduce regional disparities”.229

The PPA commits R$595 billion (US$205 billion) to projects
generating revenue. Economic growth will be fuelled by the
generation of an additional 14,085 MW230 of electrical energy and
the construction of 12,425 km of new transmission lines.

Of this huge investment, only R$6.4 billion is allocated to the item
‘environment’. Balancing the disparity in the environmental debt
seems to be far from a real priority, as 60 percent of the total
investment in the Plan will be used to address social inequity
according to the item ‘Social inclusion and reduction in social
disparities’.

Lula’s PPA intends to increase annual national crop production (led
by soya) from the current 120 million tonnes to 150 million tonnes by
2007, and to triple beef exports from 1 million to 3 million tonnes per
year. Both the beef and soya exporting sectors are in the hands of
big land owners. Both sectors are shifting production more and
more into the Amazon. Both are linked to slavery, violence and
grilagem. Both are implicated in deforestation and have a direct
partnership with the logging sector, and are far away from being
considered examples of ‘social inclusion’.

To transport this massive production of crops and meat to export
ports and consumers, Brazil will build or improve 5,500 km of roads,
and repair another 43,000 km, as well as install 2,400 km of
railways, and implement 10,000 km of waterways.

“In the Amazon, the State is the
main driver for transformation of the
economy”.

Brazilian Presidential Candidate Luís Inácio da
Silva Lula’s Program of Government, 2002.224

“…[the Program of Government would]
create extractive reserves in areas
occupied by traditional communities
that use natural resources in a
sustainable way”

Brazilian Presidential Candidate Luís Inácio da
Silva Lula’s “Program of Government”, 2002.225

Pará State will benefit from numerous investments from the Federal
government. Among the roads to be paved or upgraded are BR-163
(Cuiabá-Santarém) and the Transamazon (between Marabá and
Altamira). The exporting ports of Belém and Santarém will be
dredged and modernized, the Tucuruí hydroelectric project will have
its capacity expanded, and feasibility studies will be completed for
Belo Monte – a controversial proposed hydroelectric project in
the Xingu River near Altamira, between Porto de Moz and the
Middle Land.

All these projects are bad news for both the environment and the
local communities in the Amazon. In the last 50 years, Brazil has
tried to fast-track development by attracting international investment,
speculative capital and transnational companies, offering in exchange
massive investments in transport and energy infrastructure. The result
of this model in the Amazon was a complex of roads that remain
partially unpaved and eroded (such as the Transamazonian Highway,
Cuiabá-Santarém, and Manaus-Porto Velho); large and destructive
hydroelectric dams such as Tucuruí (which supplies subsidized
energy to mineral exporting companies in Pará), a highly competitive
agribusiness sector that is destroying the cerrado (savanna) and the
Amazon rainforest itself, and the ever-increasing concentration of
land and revenues in fewer and fewer hands. Brazil’s resulting
immense financial debt has made the country even more dependent
on external funding – and more dependent on the export of natural
resources; primarily cheap commodities such as timber, beef, soy
and minerals.

The largest soya producer in the world, Mr Blairo Maggi, was
elected Governor of Mato Grosso in the same election that made
Lula the President of Brazil. Mr Maggi is campaigning for more
‘flexibility and malleability’ towards the logging sector and said in July
2003 that the 25,000 km2 deforested in the Amazon in one year
“represents absolutely nothing compared to the size of the region”.23(cid:19)1

Maggi has supplemented his economic power by adding the political
influence of a Brazilian governor. Meanwhile, the Minister of the
Environment, Ms Marina Silva, a former rubber-tapper whose
appointment brought immense hope when it was announced by
Lula, faces a struggle with powerful colleagues such as the Minister
of Agriculture, an aggressive defender of genetically engineered soya
and the expansion of agribusiness. At the same time as she
struggles to run a ministry handicapped by serious underfunding.

The risk is that the losers of this battle will once again be the
environment and the powerless communities and settlers scattered
throughout the Amazon. As is the case throughout the world for the
poor and disempowered, they are the people least able to compete
in the global economy, and the least able to prove ownership of the
land they have occupied for generations. They have no documents,
they have no lawyers, and they have no politicians or judges in their
back pockets.

They have only hope that one day both the social and the
environmental debts will be paid. Then they will gain the respect and
protection of their human and civil rights; then they will have the
Amazon, upon which they depend.

48

The physical integrity and security of
communities fighting for their forests in Porto
de Moz, Prainha and the Middle Land will
largely depend on whether the President Lula
will keep his election promise to create
Extractive Reserves throughout this region of
the Amazon.

GREENPEACE DEMANDS

Greenpeace calls on the:

Brazilian Federal and State governments to:

Guarantee the physical integrity and the security of communities
fighting for their forests in Porto de Moz, Prainha and the Middle
Land and all the communities demanding their traditional rights in
the Amazon.

Expropriate the farms where slave work occurs and designate the
land to sustainable use by communities.

Expropriate griladas (illegally held farms) and designate them as
National Parks, biological reserves, and areas for sustainable use –
as already proposed to the Brazilian Congress by nine civil society
organizations, including Greenpeace, on 19 April 2001.

Reinforce the operational and political capacity of the Ministry of
Environment and its agencies, in particular IBAMA.

Implement the three main objectives of the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD) – conservation, sustainable use and
equitable sharing of benefits – by immediately:

1. Creating Conservation Units to be used exclusively by the
extractive and riverside communities in the Municipalities of
Prainha and Porto de Moz. This will guarantee the survival of the
local communities and their development, and guarantee that the
forest will be used by its rightful residents – those who depend on
and care for it.

2. Suspending all industrial scale exploitation of timber in Porto de

Moz and Prainha.

3. Implementing a moratorium on all industrial activities that

threaten the integrity of the remaining large unprotected areas of
the Middle Land.

4. Establishing a network of protected areas in the Middle Land by
applying the prior informed consent principles for indigenous
peoples and local communities, and by applying the ecosystem
based approach to biodiversity protection.

Timber Sector to:

•

Stop buying timber and timber products derived from companies
exploiting the forests in Porto de Moz and Prainha until the
Extractive Reserves (Verde para Sempre and Renascer) are
agreed and implemented.

However, the number must be used as an indication only, as it is very difficult, if
not impossible, to estimate the real size of Pará’s logging sector due to the
rampant illegality that characterizes this industry.

11. The exact figures are higher as large volumes of wood harvested in Pará are
being exported through the ports of Paraná and Santa Catarina states, in the
south of Brazil.

12. Wood products, the second most exported products, represented 13.8% (by

60. In the east of Pará, the old logging frontier of Paragominas has witnessed a

steep drop in timber production. During its “boom” this region – the largest timber
producing region of Pará - used to process almost 10 percent of the Amazon total
production. In 2001, the rate was around 55% lower than at the height of activities
in the late 1980s. Paragominas’s boom was made possible by the paving of the
Belém-Brasília highway, which allowed easy access to export markets, through the
port of Belém, and to domestic markets. In the south of Pará, including Sáo Félix
do Xingu, which processed 10 percent of the logs produced in the region in
1998, logging practically eradicated mahogany stocks during the late 1990s. Now
the forest cover is drastically reduced and much of the remaining forest is
concentrated in legally protected indigenous lands, which are frequently invaded
by illegal loggers. (Veríssimo et al. 1995, Nepstad et al. 1999a, cited by Lima et al.

84. In a meeting between Greenpeace, the Head of Ibama (Santarem) and the Chief
Marshall of the Federal Police (Santarem) on 24 September 2002, the Chief
Marshall explained that nowadays the Federal Police office was reduced to 2
marshals (one was leaving), 2 notaries and 14 agents. Eight of these are in
bureaucratic positions - such as passport control, reception etc. The remaining 6
can only work in shifts of 8 hours. So, she has in fact two agents on duty at any
one given time  to control an area larger than most European countries

properties. Socially, “pique” – a narrow trail in the forests - is accepted as
divisions of lands. On average, “posses” at the riverbanks are 100 ha (500m along

valued species several logging companies moved into the region taking advantage
of the new situation
