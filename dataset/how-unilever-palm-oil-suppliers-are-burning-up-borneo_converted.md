NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS EXPANSION BY

PALM OIL SUPPLIERS IS DRIVING

SPECIES EXTINCTION IN CENTRAL KALIMANTAN
AND FUELING CLIMATE CHANGE

In November 2007, Greenpeace released Cooking the Climate, an 82-page
report summarising the findings of a two-year investigation that revealed how
the world’s largest food, cosmetic and biofuel companies were driving the
wholesale destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests and peatlands through growing
palm oil consumption.

This follow-up report provides further evidence of the expansion of the palm oil
sector in Indonesia into remaining rainforests, orang-utan habitat and peatlands
in Kalimantan. It links the majority of the largest producers in Indonesia to
Unilever, probably the largest palm oil corporate consumer in the world.

Unilever uses 1.3Mt of palm oil or palm oil derivative every year – about 3%
of global production.1 About half of Unilever’s palm oil supply comes from
Indonesia.2 As recently as 2005, Unilever purchased 1 in every 20 tonnes
produced in the country.3

Unilever has failed to use its power to lead the palm oil sector toward
sustainability, either through its own palm oil purchasing – its primary suppliers
in Indonesia represent over a third of the country’s palm oil production4 – or
through its role as leader of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),
whose members represent 40% of global palm oil production.5

Through analysis of maps, satellite data, and on-the-ground investigations
between February and April 2008, Greenpeace has mapped out how
expansion of the oil palm plantations in Central Kalimantan is fuelling
climate change and helping drive orang-utans to the brink of extinction. As
Greenpeace investigations show, this expansion into the Indonesian territory
of the island of Borneo has in large part been led by companies who are
Unilever suppliers and RSPO members.

3

This destruction is set to get worse. By 2030, demand for palm oil is predicted
to more than double that of 2000.6 Between 2006 and 2016 alone, palm oil
production is set to increase by close to 15Mt.7

To meet this growth in demand, major producers including Unilever suppliers
and RSPO members are expanding their plantation areas into forests and
peatlands in Indonesia.8 This expansion – often illegal9 and in breach of RSPO
principles and criteria10 – is not only bad for wildlife, it is also bad for the climate
and bad for governance.

Unilever itself is implicated in the impacts of this expansion through rapidly
growing brand platforms that use significant quantities of palm oil and palm oil
derivatives from companies operating in Indonesia. Product brands and brand
platforms include Dove, Dirt is Good (Persil, Omo, Surf Excel), Knorr,
HeartBrand (Walls) and HealthyHeart (Flora/Becel).

Greenpeace investigations provide new evidence that it is Unilever’s own palm
oil traders and producers (themselves RSPO members) who are leading
‘aggressive expansion’ of the sector that results in the devastation of the last
remaining orang-utan rainforest and peatland habitat in Borneo.

By failing to apply and enforce RSPO principles and criteria to both traders and
producers at group level, Unilever has failed to bring the rapidly expanding
palm oil sector under control. The growth of global brands and brand platforms
such as Dove and Dirt is Good is creating incentives for Unilever’s suppliers to
expand, ‘leading to the devastation of the last remaining rain forests in
Borneo’.11 As it stands, Unilever suppliers are driving species extinction, climate
change through the significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions linked to
deforestation and peatland destruction, and land conflict with forest-dependent
communities.

Given the urgent nature of the crisis, the only solution for the global climate,
the regional environment, the wildlife and the forest-dependent communities
relying upon Indonesia’s forest resources is a moratorium on oil palm
expansion into rainforest and peatland areas.

THE IMPACTS OF DEFORESTATION
IN INDONESIA

Indonesia now has the fastest deforestation rate
of any major forested country.14 Losing 2% of its
remaining forest every year, Indonesia has earned
a place in the Guinness World Records.15

According to World Bank estimates, between 1985 and
1997 alone, 60% of the lowland rainforest of Kalimantan
and Sumatra was destroyed.16 The United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) estimates that 98% of
Indonesia’s lowland forest may be destroyed by 2022.17

Indonesia also holds the global record for GHG emissions from
deforestation, which puts it in third place behind the USA and
China in terms of total GHG emissions from human industry.18
The destruction of Indonesia’s peat swamp forests alone is one
of the largest sources of GHG emissions in the world. The
largest portion of these emissions is associated with fires to
clear the land for agricultural development.19

Indonesia’s emissions from destroyed or degraded peatland are
around 1.8Gt CO2 per year,20 equivalent to 4% of total GHG
emissions,21 from less than 0.1% of the world’s land surface.22
If predicted expansion in oil palm plantations goes ahead, peatland
emissions of CO2 are set to rise by at least 50% by 2030.23

Orang-utans – one of our nearest biological relatives – survive
only in the dwindling tropical rainforests of Borneo and
northern Sumatra:25 they depend on the forest for food and
nesting sites.26 Cutting down forest for timber or conversion to
plantations is the main cause of their decline,27 and today
orang-utans are at high risk of extinction in the wild.

Recent Greenpeace analysis and investigations
confirm that expansion in oil palm plantations
by Unilever suppliers is having a serious impact
on their habitat.

ORANG-UTAN DISTRIBUTION IN CENTRAL KALIMANTAN:
IMPACT OF 2000–2007 DEFORESTATION AND PROJECTED
IMPACT OF CURRENT OIL PALM CONCESSIONS

Orang-utan distribution
Deforestation
Oil palm concessions

A 2007 UNEP report recognises that oil palm plantations are
now the leading cause of rainforest destruction in
Indonesia.33 Between 1991 and 2006, almost 5 million
hectares of new oil palm concession areas have been
established in Indonesia alone,34 equivalent to over 50
football pitches an hour. Much of this area was previously
forest or peatland. The Indonesian Palm Oil Research
Institute (IOPRI) estimates that two-thirds of all currently
productive oil palm plantations involved deforestation.35

On top of Indonesia’s existing 6 million hectares of oil
palms,36 the country’s central government has plans for
another 4 million hectares by 2015 dedicated to biofuel
production alone.37 Provincial governments are even more
ambitious in terms of oil palm expansion, planning for an
additional 20 million hectares.38

Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo,
which it shares with Malaysia and Brunei, has some of
Indonesia’s largest remaining areas of forest habitat. This is
home to most of the world’s remaining orang-utans.

While most current palm oil production is concentrated in
Riau and North Sumatra, oil palm groups are rapidly
expanding their landbanks and clearing new areas. In West
Kalimantan, by 2007 oil palm concessions had been
granted on more than 3.2 million ha.39 In Central Kalimantan,
by 2006 oil palm concessions had been granted on 1.1
million ha.40

As a 2008 Greenpeace investigation reveals, much of this
area – which overlaps critical orang-utan habitat – is being
cleared of valuable forest, the peatlands drained and the
land burned as oil palm plantation area expands.

As orang-utans and other species lose their rainforests to oil
palm plantations, they are deprived of their natural source of
food. Seeking to survive off young palm plants, hungry
orang-utans can become ‘pests’ to oil palm producers, and
plantation workers commonly kill orang-utans to protect the
crop.41 According to the Centre for Orangutan Protection, at
least 1,500 orang-utans died in 2006 as a result of
deliberate attacks by plantation workers.42

‘The Bornean orang-utan is classified as Endangered […] indicating that it has a
very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future. The Sumatran orang-utan
is classified as Critically Endangered […] indicating that it has an extremely high
risk of extinction in the wild in the near future. Since 1900, the number of
Sumatran orang-utans is thought to have fallen by about 91%, with a rapidly
accelerating loss towards the end of the twentieth century.’

Indonesian Ministry of Forestry. The first map shows 2004 orang-utan distribution in Central Kalimantan.
The second map projects the impact of 2000–2007 deforestation on orang-utan distribution. The third map
overlays this with oil palm concessions. The fourth map projects that all remaining orang-utan habitat
within concession areas will be lost.

PEATLAND DISTRIBUTION IN CENTRAL KALIMANTAN:
PROJECTED IMPACT OF 2006–2007 FIRE HOTSPOTS
IN RELATION TO CURRENT OIL PALM CONCESSIONS

Peatlands
Fire hotspots
Oil palm concessions

In Central Kalimantan, between 2006 and 2007, one orang-
utan rescue centre retrieved more than 200 orang-utans
from oil palm plantations.43 Greenpeace has evidence of
orang-utans found on concessions belonging to Unilever
suppliers.44

Oil palm plantation expansion takes place with little oversight
from central or local government. Procedures for
environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and
ensuring a proper process for development of concessions
are neglected.

Many new plantations are located on peat that should be
off-limits to development or degradation according to
Indonesian law.45 This stipulates that land should not be
allocated for oil palm plantations on peat soils deeper than
2 metres; in addition, activities that damage upstream natural
swamp forests with deep peat (more than 3 metres) are
prohibited.46 In other words, palm oil development on such
peatlands is illegal. Greenpeace has documented such
clearance on concessions belonging to Unilever suppliers.47

E

The use of fire to clear forest areas is the largest source of
GHG emissions in the world.48 The practice has been illegal
in Indonesia since 1999,49 yet remains commonplace among
palm oil producers. Greenpeace has identified thousands of
fire hotspots (areas visible on satellite images used to
monitor forest fires) on concessions belonging to Unilever
suppliers during the period 2006–2007.50

Social conflict, including land rights and resource conflicts,
is often associated with oil palm plantation expansion.51
Greenpeace has evidence of such conflicts resulting from
the establishment of concessions belonging to Unilever
suppliers.52

DATE

‘The main areas remaining for new
extensive plantations are the large
tracts of tropical peatlands – until
recently virgin rainforest areas.
Over 50% of new plantations are

PALM OIL SUPPLIERS ARE

LEADING AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION

UNILEVER SUPPLIERS SINAR MAS, IOI,
ADM-KUOK-WILMAR, SIME DARBY,
MUSIM MAS, ASTRA AGRO AND
ASIAN AGRI ARE PUSHING EXTINCTION
Unilever acknowledges that it has no idea where about 20%
of its palm oil comes from. Of the remaining 80%, it knows
the group supplying the palm oil, but not necessarily the
concession areas from which it originates.53

Palm oil producers linked to Unilever include Sinar Mas, IOI,
ADM-Kuok-Wilmar, Sime Darby, Musim Mas, Astra Agro and
Asian Agri.

Greenpeace analysis of deforestation maps, satellite data of
fire hotspots, and orang-utan distribution maps, as well as
field investigations of oil palm operations in Central
Kalimantan, show these Unilever suppliers laying claim to
large tracts of forest and peatland, with devastating impacts
on climate and biodiversity.

‘A scenario released by UNEP in 2002

suggested that most natural rainforest in

Indonesia would be degraded by 2032.

Given the rate of deforestation in the past

five years, and recent widespread

investment in oil palm plantations and

biodiesel refineries, this may have been

optimistic. New estimates suggest that 98%

of the forest may be destroyed by 2022,

the lowland forest much sooner.’

United Nations Environment

Programme, 2007

UNILEVER’S TRADERS ARE DEALING
WITH BAD COMPANIES
Many of the largest producers in Indonesia that supply
Unilever directly are also traders. This means that a
significant portion of the palm oil they sell may come from
third parties as well as their own operations. In this way,
the identity of groups heavily reliant on deforestation and
peatland clearance is lost in the supply chain. Producer–
traders include Sinar Mas, IOI, ADM-Kuok-Wilmar,
Sime Darby, Musim Mas and Asian Agri.

Another significant palm oil refiner and trader,54 RSPO
member,55 and supplier to Unilever is the agricultural
commodity giant Cargill. It is the largest privately-owned
company in the world.56

Industry sources confirm that roughly half of the palm oil
imported into Europe by Cargill comes from Indonesia.57
According to export data for 2007, Cargill’s Singapore
trading arm exported palm oil from 15 different oil palm
concession holders in Indonesia.58 These include some of
Indonesia’s largest palm oil producers: Sinar Mas, Wilmar,
Musim Mas, Astra Agro and Asian Agri.59

Greenpeace has traced palm oil from a Cargill refinery in
Europe to Knorr, one of Unilever’s high profile brands. Cargill
is also one of Unilever’s European suppliers of palm oil for
ice cream.60

13

SINAR MAS IS INDONESIA’S LARGEST
OIL PALM PLANTATION COMPANY

SINAR MAS IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE PALM OIL
SECTOR AND IS A MEMBER OF THE RSPO
Sinar Mas is a RSPO member through its oil palm plantation
subsidiary PT SMART.61

The Sinar Mas Group accounts for almost 10% of palm oil
production in Indonesia.62 The Group produces not just crude
palm oil, but also palm kernel oil and a wide range of refined
products for both food and industrial purposes.63

In 2008, Sinar Mas branded itself ‘No. 1 in Indonesia’64 for total
planted plantation area. This empire includes 360,000ha of
plantation: some 213,000ha in Sumatra, 135,000ha in
Kalimantan and 12,000ha in Papua.65

Sinar Mas claims to have ‘the largest land bank in the world
for new plantations’66 and has publicly announced plans to
expand its holdings by 1.3 million ha in the heavily forested
province of Papua and in Kalimantan.67 However, an internal
company presentation obtained by Greenpeace indicates that
the company plans to develop a rainforest area of up to 2.8
million ha in Papua.68

The Sinar Mas Group is involved in ‘aggressive plantations
expansion’69 – ‘the most aggressive new planting programme
among the plantation companies’70 – planting 53,000ha in
2007 with plans to plant at least 60,000ha in 2008,71
representing a growth in plantation area of over a third in a
two-year period.72 Judging by past operations and known
landbank, the vast majority of this will involve deforestation,
some on peatlands and in critical orang-utan habitat.

UNILEVER’S LINKS TO SINAR MAS
Despite Sinar Mas’ ‘legacy issues’73 – including defaulting on
most of the $13.4 billion debt of its APP subsidiary in 200174 –
Unilever has maintained a long-standing relationship with the
company. A 1999 Sinar Mas document states: ‘Our major
customers include Cargill and Unilever. These sales were
made through foreign brokers or directly to the importer
located in the countries to which the products were
exported.’75 The Sinar Mas 2004 and 2006 Annual Reports76
also indicate that Unilever has been an important client in
2003–2006, along with Nestlé and Carrefour.77

IOI AND UNILEVER’S LONG HISTORY

IOI IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE PALM OIL
SECTOR AND IS A MEMBER OF THE RSPO
The IOI Group has a plantation land holding of nearly
170,000ha in Malaysia (of which 149,000ha is planted) and
another 152,000ha in Kalimantan in Indonesia (of which
43,000ha is planted) via a joint venture,78 with 72% of its
Indonesian holdings yet to be planted. These holdings
include 63,000ha in Central Kalimantan.79

IOI has been involved in oleo chemicals since 1980.80 In
2006, IOI emerged as the world’s largest producer of oleo
chemicals – chemicals often derived from palm oil that are
used in cosmetics, laundry detergents and other household
products. IOI has a total fatty acid production capacity of
700,000 tonnes a year.81

In 2007, the Group produced 790,000 tonnes of crude
palm oil representing more than 2% of global production.82
It also produced 185,000 tonnes of palm kernel oil,83
representing more than 4% of global production.84

In 2007, IOI is estimated to have produced around 180,000
tonnes of crude palm oil in Indonesia,85 accounting for just
over 1% of Indonesian production.

UNILEVER’S LINKS TO IOI
IOI has had a long association with Unilever. In 2002–2003,
IOI bought the palm oil refining company Loders Croklaan
from Unilever86 at the same time as it acquired Unilever’s
Malaysian oil palm plantations.87 Announcing the deal,
Unilever stated: ‘Loders Croklaan will continue to supply
Unilever with specialty products.’88

In 2007 and 2008, IOI Rotterdam confirmed that it supplies
Unilever from its Dutch refineries.89

In 2008, Unilever named IOI as one of its principle
suppliers.90

‘The proposed Joint Venture is in line with
the Group’s strategy of growing its core
palm oil business […]. It will provide
immediate addition to planted hectarage
as well as substantial suitable land bank
for sustained business growth, hence
providing the Group with the opportunity
to capitalise on the very favourable
outlook for the oil palm industry. The
plantations […] shall be cultivated in
compliance with sustainable agricultural
practices and principles in accordance
with the principles and criteria of the
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.’

ADM-WILMAR-KUOK IS ONE OF THE WORLD’S
LARGEST PRIVATELY OWNED GROUPS

THE ADM-KUOK-WILMAR ALLIANCE IS A MAJOR
PLAYER IN THE PALM OIL SECTOR AND IS A
MEMBER OF THE RSPO
Wilmar is a RSPO member. It claims to be the world’s largest
producer of palm oil based biodiesel.91 The Group – effectively
a shareholder alliance between ADM92 and the Kuok family93 –
also controls about 570,000ha of concession area (just over a
third of this has been cleared and planted), palm oil refineries
and biodiesel plants across Indonesia and Malaysia.94 Of this,
some 493,000ha is in Indonesia.95

In 2007, Indonesian production for the Wilmar Group was
around 540,000 tonnes of crude palm oil, accounting for
more than 3% of Indonesia production.96 Although Wilmar
owns substantial concession areas, more than 55% of its
palm oil production comes from third party plantations.97

The Kuok Group was founded by Robert Kuok Hock-Nien,
the uncle of William Kuok, one of Wilmar’s founders.
According to Forbes, in 2005, Robert Kuok Hock-Nien was
the richest man in Asia.98

15

The US-headquartered ADM claims to be the world’s leading
processor of agricultural crops and Europe’s leader in
biofuels.99 The company also trades crude palm oil on the
Chicago futures market (meaning contracts are signed and
traded months ahead of delivery).100 ADM is one of Cargill’s
main competitors in the palm oil sector,101 although through
Wilmar, the alliance also trades with Cargill.102

UNILEVER’S LINKS TO ADM-KUOK-WILMAR
In a 2006 declaration to institutional investors, Wilmar
announced that its key international customers include Procter
& Gamble, Cargill, Unilever, Nestlé and China Grains & Oils
Group Corporation.103

In the UK, most if not all of Unilever’s palm oil is supplied by
ADM.104 The company operates a refinery immediately next
door to Unilever’s margarine factory outside London. Reported
as the largest margarine factory in the world,105 the Unilever
factory produces brands such as Flora and Bertolli.106 The
ADM refinery handles more than 300,000 tonnes of edible oils
a year, including palm oil.107 In addition to supplying products
to the Unilever factory, the company delivers products to a
wide range of food factories around the UK and overseas.108
Unilever also has trade links to the Kuok Group. For instance,
Unilever Pakistan purchased almost 100 tonnes of palm kernel
oil from the Group in August 2007.109 Kuok Group is known
to source palm oil from Astra Agro as well as other third-party
suppliers.110

In 2008, Unilever named Kuok-Wilmar as one of its
principle suppliers.111

SIME DARBY  – THE WORLD’S LARGEST
OIL PALM PLANTATIONS COMPANY

UNILEVER’S LINKS TO SIME DARBY
The Group is a major supplier to Unilever.122

SIME DARBY IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE PALM OIL
SECTOR AND IS A MEMBER OF THE RSPO
The 2007 merger of Sime Darby, Golden Hope Plantations
and Kumpulan Guthrie established Sime Darby Plantation as
the world’s largest palm oil producer, with the potential of
producing 8% of the world’s total palm oil output.112 This
publicly-listed group, which runs plantations, refineries and
biodiesel plants across Indonesia and Malaysia,113 is controlled
by the Malaysian government.114

Sime Darby is a RSPO member.115

The Group is focusing on Indonesia for expanding its
business.116

With total plantation assets of nearly 550,000ha, Sime Darby’s
nearly 200,000ha of oil palm concessions in Indonesia makes
up for more than a third of its total holdings.117 Prior to the
merger, Golden Hope controlled a total area of 60,000ha in
West Kalimantan, Indonesia, of which 13,000ha were planted
with oil palms.118 Kumpulan Guthrie owned and operated 56
plantation estates in Indonesia with a total land area of
220,000ha spread over Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi,119
of which 175,000ha had been planted.120

In 2007, Indonesian production for the Sime Darby Group was
around 800,000 tonnes of crude palm oil, accounting for
nearly 5% of Indonesia production.121

There is a long standing relationship between Unilever and
companies now part of Sime Darby Group.

In 2002, Golden Hope bought Unimills, Unilever’s oil refinery
in Rotterdam in The Netherlands.123 Unimills is the second
largest diversified oil and fats blend manufacturer in Europe124
– an industry that uses large quantities of palm oil. A recent
announcement by Sime Darby confirmed that Unilever is a
major customer of the Golden Hope (now Sime Darby)
Unimills refinery in Rotterdam.125

In 2008, Unilever named the Sime Darby Group, including
Golden Hope and Kumpulan Guthrie, as one of its principle
suppliers.126

The company seeks RSPO certification for all of its operations.
This includes certification of the Central Kalimantan
concession PT Globalindo Alam Perkasa in September 2009.
As of December 2007, 2,531ha of this concession (15%) was
reported planted.131 Greenpeace has evidence that in
December 2007, a baby orang-utan was captured in this
concession area, indicating that it has high conservation
values (HCV). The concession is located on peat,132 in some
areas over 4 metres deep, and had fire hotspots in 2006 and
2007,133 implying recent clearance.

TIME FOR ACTION: A MORATORIUM ON
OIL PALM EXPANSION INTO INDONESIA’S
RAINFORESTS AND PEATLANDS

to ensure the livelihoods of millions of people who depend
on forests.

WHAT DOES THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT
NEED TO DO?

Forest destruction is responsible for about one fifth of global
GHG emissions – Indonesia and the Amazon are by far the
two largest sources of GHG emissions from deforestation.
Emissions from Indonesia’s degraded peatlands represent 4%
of global GHG emissions, but the area of degraded peatlands
involved is relatively small – about 10 million hectares or less
than 0.1% of the Earth’s land surface.

If we are to prevent dangerous global climate change, we
need a global effort to halt forest destruction as well as
bringing about a drastic reduction in our use of coal, oil and
gas by using energy more efficiently and utilising cleaner
sources of energy.

In order to help protect the climate, Greenpeace is calling for
an end to deforestation in Indonesia – the largest source of
GHG emissions from deforestation.

A halt to further rainforest destruction in Indonesia is also
critical to ensuring the future for critically endangered species
such as the orang-utan.

STOP THE PROBLEM: ZERO DEFORESTATION
Establish a moratorium on forest clearance and peatland
degradation and ensure enforcement of the moratorium.

START THE SOLUTION: CLIMATE PROTECTION
Prioritise protection of remaining peat swamp forests and other
forest areas with high carbon storage capacity, biodiversity
values and benefits for indigenous peoples and other local
communities.

START THE SOLUTION: CUT ONGOING EMISSIONS
Rehabilitate degraded peatland areas with natural and
native flora.

WHAT DO UNILEVER AND THE PALM OIL
SECTOR NEED TO DO?

STOP THE PROBLEM: SUPPORT ZERO
DEFORESTATION
Support a moratorium on forest clearance and peatland
degradation.

START THE SOLUTION: CLEAN UP THE TRADE
Do not trade with those engaged in deforestation and
peatland degradation.

Inform suppliers that purchasers will no longer buy from
companies engaged in forest conversion and peatland
degradation.

‘A moratorium will be a strong signal. [It] can be a first step in countering peatland
degradation [,] to buy time to maximise the new opportunity of carbon finance.
A moratorium needs to be part of a longer-term strategy of land-use planning.’
Yogyakarta statement, endorsed by the Indonesian Minister of the
Environment, August 2007

‘The simplest and most effective measure to prevent a further increase
in fires and CO2 emissions is by conservation of remaining peat
swamp forests and rehabilitation of degraded peat swamp forests.’

Wetlands International, 2006

Accounting for continued deforestation at a rate
of 1.5%/year, the deforested peatland area in
2006 is around 45% of total peatland area, or
12.1 million hectares. 83% of 12.1 = 10 million

Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning
organisation that acts to change attitudes and
behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment
and to promote peace.

Greenpeace is committed to stopping climate change.

We campaign to protect the world’s remaining ancient
forests and the plants, animals and peoples that depend
on them.

We investigate, expose and confront the trade in
products causing forest destruction and climate change.

We challenge governments and industry to end their
role in forest destruction and climate change.

We support the rights of forest peoples.
