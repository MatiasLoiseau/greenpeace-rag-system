Briefing:
Department
of
Energy’s
Go-to
Firm
Helped
Prepare
Alaska
LNG’s
Bogus
Climate
Assessment
Previous
Greenpeace
USA
research
revealed
that
key
studies
used
by
the
Department
of
Energy
to
approve
liquefied
natural
gas
export
authorizations
were
prepared
with
support
from
gas
industry
insiders
and
consultants.
The
same
appears
to
be
true
for
Alaska
LNG's
flawed
life
cycle
analysis,
which
was
ordered
by
the
Department
of
Energy
partly
due
to
an
executive
order
mandating
federal
agencies
to
exercise
climate
leadership.
Supplying
the
Alaska
LNG
mega-project
will
require
up
to
3.36
billion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
production
per
day,
according
to
official
estimates.
1
The
gas
resources
on
tap
to
supply
this
production
are
not
commercially
viable
without
Alaska
LNG
and
its
accompanying
800-mile
pipeline,
which
would
carry
gas
from
the
remote
Northern
Slope
of
Alaska
to
the
planned
liquefied
natural
gas
(LNG)
terminal
in
Nikiski,
southwest
of
Anchorage.
Nevertheless,
a
key
analysis
ordered
by
the
Department
of
Energy
(DOE)
in
2021
concluded
that
Alaska
LNG
would
not
increase
greenhouse
gas
emissions
compared
to
a
scenario
where
the
project
does
not
get
built.
2
This
assessment
was
the
result
of
comparing
Alaska
LNG’s
projected
emissions
to
a
high
emissions
baseline
scenario
that
is
both
unlikely
and
inconsistent
with
stated
climate
policies.
Greenpeace
USA
research
shows
that
the
analysis
was
conducted
with
the
help
of
KeyLogic,
a
consulting
firm
with
commercial
ties
to
the
gas
industry.
KeyLogic
is
one
of
the
DOE’s
go-to
contractors,
and,
in
addition
to
the
Alaska
LNG
study,
it
was
heavily
involved
in
preparing
a
2019
LNG
analysis
that
the
DOE
has
used
to
justify
its
track
record
of
universally
approving
LNG
export
applications.
3
Some
KeyLogic
staff
have
worked
on
DOE
projects
while
simultaneously
working
for
gas
companies
that
the
DOE
is
tasked
with
regulating.
The
DOE’s
plan
to
update
the
environmental
analysis
of
LNG
that
informs
the
public
interest
determination
of
LNG
exports
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction—
improvements
to
this
analysis
are
urgently
needed.
4
But
the
Alaska
LNG
case
study
serves
as
a
warning
that
pro-fossil
fuel
bias
remains
a
risk
to
the
integrity
of
this
crucial
update.
Initial
approvals
of
Alaska
LNG
by
FERC
and
DOE
Because
of
how
the
federal
government
regulates
LNG
export
terminals,
Alaska
LNG
was
required
to
secure
approvals
from
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
(FERC)
and
the
DOE.
Although
FERC
was
the
lead
agency
responsible
for
Alaska
LNG’s
environmental
impact
statement
under
the
National
Environmental
Protection
Act
(NEPA)
between
2018
and
2020,
the
DOE
would
later
adopt
FERC’s
environmental
impact
statement
for
the
purpose
of
approving
Alaska
LNG’s
non-free
trade
association
LNG
export
application
under
the
Natural
Gas
Act.

Both
agencies—
but
especially
FERC—
are
notorious
for
using
deeply
flawed
reasoning
to
circumvent
credible
environmental
concerns.
One
of
the
many
flaws
in
FERC’s
assessment
of
Alaska
LNG,
as
pointed
out
by
the
Center
for
Biological
Diversity
and
Earthjustice
on
behalf
of
conservation
groups
including
the
Sierra
Club
and
the
Chickaloon
Village
Traditional
Council
in
June
2020,
was
that
it
did
not
even
mention
the
project’s
upstream
or
downstream
emissions.
5
These
typically
represent
the
vast
majority
of
lifecycle
emissions
associated
with
LNG
exports.
Although
the
DOE
adopted
FERC’s
environmental
impact
statement
in
August
2020,
6
it
subsequently
granted
a
rehearing
request
sought
by
the
Sierra
Club
to
further
assess
the
project’s
environmental
impacts
in
April
2021.
7
Consequently,
the
DOE
stated
that
it
would
prepare
a
new,
supplemental
environmental
impact
statement
(SEIS)
consistent
with
NEPA
that
would
include
a
life
cycle
analysis
of
Alaska
LNG’s
Asia-bound
gas
exports.
8
It
was
at
this
stage
that
KeyLogic
entered
the
picture,
as
a
support
contractor
for
the
life
cycle
analysis
that
DOE
would
commission
from
the
National
Energy
Technology
Laboratory
(NETL).
Factors
leading
DOE
to
order
a
new
Alaska
LNG
environmental
study
It
is
important
to
understand
why
the
DOE
granted
the
Sierra
Club’s
rehearing
request
in
the
first
place.
It
boils
down
to
two
factors.
First,
the
transition
from
a
Trump
administration
to
a
Biden
administration
in
January
2021
came
with
a
string
of
climate-focused
executive
orders,
and
meant
that
the
DOE
and
its
sub-agencies
would
be
under
new
leadership.
Most
notably,
Executive
Order
14008
of
January
27,
2021
(“Tackling
the
Climate
Crisis
at
Home
and
Abroad”)
committed
to
“organize
and
deploy
the
full
capacity
of
[the
federal
government’s]
agencies
to
combat
the
climate
crisis”
and,
further,
to
“drive
assessment,
disclosure,
and
mitigation
of
climate
pollution
and
climate-related
risks
in
every
sector”
of
the
U.S.
economy.
9
The
DOE
explicitly
referred
to
this
and
another
climate-focused
executive
order
in
its
rehearing
order
for
Alaska
LNG.
Second,
the
Sierra
Club’s
rehearing
request
demonstrated,
based
on
previous
authorization
decisions,
that
it
was
outside
the
DOE’s
usual
practice
to
dismiss
the
life
cycle
emissions
associated
with
LNG
exports.
10
Typically,
the
DOE
had
used
“general
studies”
assessing
the
life
cycle
emissions
of
LNG
exports
from
the
lower
48
states
to
inform
the
public
interest
determination
of
LNG
projects.
Due
to
Alaska
LNG’s
location,
however,
none
of
these
studies
would
have
been
relevant
to
Alaska
LNG.
Consequently,
the
Sierra
Club
argued
that
a
new
life
cycle
emissions
study
was
warranted,
and
the
DOE
acquiesced.

The
outcome
of
the
Alaska
LNG
study:
data-washing
and
defiance
of
common
sense
The
Alaska
LNG
study
that
NETL
prepared
with
support
from
KeyLogic
is
strongly
suggestive
of
“data-washing,”
a
practice
similar
to
greenwashing.
11
Oil
&
gas
companies
use
data-washing
to
make
credible-sounding
environmental
claims
that
rely
on
faulty
assumptions
or
incomplete
analysis.
With
data-washing,
there
is
often
a
sleight
of
hand:
complex
models
and
equations
are
used
to
distract
attention
from
how
the
underlying
study
design
has
been
carefully
crafted
to
produce
industry-favoring
results.
The
Alaska
LNG
analysis
has
the
telltale
features
of
data-washing.
Behind
a
smokescreen
of
emissions
estimation
methods
and
technical
jargon,
there
is
a
crucial
error:
the
authors
assume
(without
justification)
that
if
Alaska
LNG
is
not
built,
the
same
volume
of
gas
would
be
produced
and
exported
from
the
lower
48
states
instead.
12
There
is
no
evidence
provided
to
support
this
assertion;
and,
at
a
conceptual
level,
it
is
basically
a
license
to
pollute
based
on
the
assumption
that
“if
we
don’t
do
it,
someone
else
will.”
As
a
result,
the
study
maintains
that
even
though
Alaska
LNG
would
emit
up
to
2.7
billion
metric
tons
of
greenhouse
emissions
over
its
lifetime
(ten
times
the
amount
of
the
Willow
Project),
it
would
actually
save
on
emissions
compared
to
a
scenario
where
the
project
doesn’t
get
built.
A
2022
report
from
Earthjustice
and
the
Stockholm
Environmental
Institute
shows
that
this
type
of
approach
has
a
bevy
of
scientific
shortcomings;
and
although
there
is
a
history
of
agencies
using
similar
reasoning
to
assess
coal
and
oil
projects
under
NEPA,
over
time
this
reasoning
has
been
increasingly
rejected
by
the
courts.
13
One
problem
is
that
“the
inherent
uncertainty
of
estimating
the
counterfactual
for
a
single
project
–
what
will
happen
if
the
project
is
not
approved
[...]
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
conclusions
can
be
manipulated
by
project
proponents
to
reach
a
desired
result.”
Another
is
that
it
“centers
on
a
comparison
between
the
project
and
a
‘no
action’
alternative
reflecting
a
high-emissions
‘business
as
usual’
scenario
that
is
neither
likely,
nor
tolerable,
nor
consistent
with
stated
policies.”
In
other
words,
the
analysis
“pretends
as
if
the
nation,
and
other
nations,
have
not
made
a
commitment
to
stop
global
warming.”
Lastly,
the
authors
point
out
that
aside
from
greenhouse
gas
emissions
analyses
“it
is
hard
to
find
any
other
analytical
context
in
which
known
environmental
or
health
harm
is
dismissed
on
the
theory
that
‘if
we
don’t
do
it,
someone
else
will.’”
The
same
rationale
is
not
applied,
for
example,
when
federal
agencies
assess
water
pollution
or
species
disturbance
under
NEPA.
In
June
2022,
the
DOE
published
the
draft
SEIS
for
Alaska
LNG,
which
adopts
the
findings
of
the
flawed
life
cycle
analysis
prepared
by
NETL
and
KeyLogic.
14
During
the
public
comment
period,
multiple
commenters,
including
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA),
pointed
out
that
assumptions
underlying
the
life
cycle
analysis,
and
that
largely
drove
the
results,
were
incorrect..

the
final
SEIS.
Instead
of
concluding
that
Alaska
LNG
would
definitely
reduce
emissions
compared
to
the
baseline
scenario,
the
final
SEIS
presents
two
opposing
baseline
scenarios:
one
that
is
unchanged,
presenting
Alaska
LNG
as
a
net
climate
benefit
(“No
Action
Alternative
1”),
and
a
second
that
assumes
Alaska
LNG’s
life
cycle
emissions
would
be
100%
additional,
adding
up
to
1.9
billion
metric
tons
of
CO
2
e
to
the
atmosphere
cumulatively
(“No
Action
Alternative
2”).
17
Ultimately,
however,
the
DOE
granted
Alaska
LNG’s
export
authorization
based
on
the
reasoning
that
“while
both
[assumptions]
are
unlikely,
in
DOE’s
judgment
the
greenhouse
emissions
and
related
climate
impacts
associated
with
Alaska
LNG’s
exports
…
are
likely
to
be
closer
to
the
difference
between
No
Action
Alternative
1
and
the
project
scenarios.”
18
It
is
thanks
to
pushback
from
the
EPA
and
civil
society
groups
that
the
final
SEIS
presents
a
view
of
Alaska
LNG
that
considers
the
potential
for
LNG
exports
to
increase
global
emissions
at
all.
But
the
DOE’s
decision
to
present
two
radically
different
calculations
just
to
dismiss
both
of
them
is
illogical,
and
fails
to
achieve
the
goals
of
NEPA
and
the
Natural
Gas
Act.
In
future
analyses,
the
DOE
must
close
the
door
on
data-washing
to
prevent
decisions
that
set
us
back
from
achieving
our
climate
goals.
The
Alaska
LNG
analysis,
like
DOE’s
2019
environmental
study
of
LNG,
was
supported
by
a
KeyLogic
team
with
major
oil
and
gas
company
clients
What
makes
the
Alaska
LNG
life
cycle
analysis
even
more
interesting
is
that
it
fits
into
a
pattern
of
analyses
commissioned
by
the
DOE
and
supported
by
KeyLogic
that
are
biased
in
favor
of
the
LNG
industry,
including
the
2019
environmental
study
that
underpins
the
DOE’s
public
interest
determination
for
LNG
exports.
Since
the
early
2010s,
the
DOE
has
used
periodically
updated
economic
and
environmental
analyses
of
LNG
that
it
commissions
from
national
laboratories
and
private
contractors
to
help
determine
whether
LNG
export
applications
are
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
The
DOE’s
most
recent
environmental
analysis
of
LNG,
which
was
finalized
in
2019,
used
very
low
estimates
of
methane
leakage
in
the
LNG
supply
chain
and
failed
to
consider
how
increased
LNG
exports
can
drive
up
total
fossil
fuel
use.
19
In
a
previous
investigation
,
published
in
April
2024,
Greenpeace
USA
found
that
the
2019
study
was
supported
by
KeyLogic’s
life
cycle
analysis
team,
which
was
simultaneously
offering
services
to
oil
and
gas
industry
clients.
20
At
least
three
KeyLogic
employees
who
were
listed
among
the
authors
of
the
study
were
also
performing
commercial
work
for
Cheniere
and
Saudi
Aramco
between
2017
and
2020.
Moreover,
of
the
four
KeyLogic
authors,
all
had,
or
later
developed,
significant
connections
to
the
oil
and
gas
sector:
the
project
lead
had
previously
worked
at
EQT
Corporation—
a
company
that
has
actively
opposed
LNG
restrictions—
and
the
other
three
authors
went
on
to
full-time
positions
at
Cheniere,
Saudi
Aramco
Americas,
and
GTI
Energy,
a
pro-gas
think
tank.
KeyLogic
appears
to
have
also
played
a
large
role
in
the
flawed
Alaska
LNG
analysis.
Eight
KeyLogic
employees—
evidently
from
the
same
team
that
did
business
with
major
oil
and
gas
companies—
were
listed
among
the
ten
authors
of
the
analysis.
One
of
the
authors
was

ExxonMobil’s
major
stake
in
the
project
is
underscored
by
a
2019
statement
made
by
ExxonMobil
Alaska
President
Darlene
Gates:
“As
the
largest
holder
of
discovered
gas
resources
on
the
North
Slope,
we
have
been
working
for
decades
to
tackle
the
challenges
of
bringing
Alaska’s
gas
to
market.”

Conclusion
The
Alaska
LNG
case
study,
like
many
other
examples,
both
demonstrates
how
federal
analyses
are
vulnerable
to
data-washing
and
raises
questions
about
the
impartiality
of
the
DOE’s
record
of
LNG
export
authorizations.
Although
the
federal
government’s
announcement
in
January
to
update
the
LNG
studies
that
inform
the
public
interest
determination
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction,
stringent
integrity
and
oversight
measures
still
need
to
be
taken
to
prevent
the
updated
analyses
from
being
mismanaged.
These
measures
should
include
facilitating
an
inclusive
process
with
meaningful
participation
from
environmental
justice
communities,
experts,
and
other
stakeholders
outside
the
gas
industry.
Moreover,
under
NEPA,
FERC
and
the
DOE
should
downweight
and
avoid
the
usage
of
emissions
displacement
analytic
approaches,
which
depend
on
highly
uncertain
assumptions
and
are
vulnerable
to
manipulation.
If
and
where
baselines
are
needed,
FERC
and
the
DOE
should
use
baseline
scenarios
that
comply
with
global
and
domestic
climate
policies
and
agreements.
Lastly,
with
respect
to
the
DOE’s
forthcoming
updated
environmental
analysis
of
LNG,
as
well
as
NEPA,
the
DOE
should
yield
to
the
EPA’s
relevant
expertise
in
matters
that
concern
emissions
accounting
and
climate
change.
