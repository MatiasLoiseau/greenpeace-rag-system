Abstract 
 
Hair analysis provides a historical record of an individual’s exposure to mercury or 
methylmercury.  In this study hair analysis of mercury was performed on samples from self-selected volunteer participants from across the Un ited States.  Participants completed detailed 
questionnaires that included questions regarding their level of fish c onsumption (broken down by 
type of fish), as well as age, gender, race, hair  treatments, flu vaccinations , and dental amalgams.  
The responses to these questions we re then related to data regardi ng hair mercury concentrations  
to compare groups of interest and to use in an ANOVA statistical analysis.  Total hair mercury 
was found to be significantly associated with age, race, gender, geographic region, and fish 
consumption frequency.  The median hair mercur y concentration for participants who consumed 
eight or more servings of seafood per month (inc luding shellfish) was 0.83 ug/g more than those 
who reported consuming no fish, 0.68 ug/g more th an those who consumed 1-2 servings per 
month, and 0.43 ug/g more than those who consumed 3-7 servings per month.  There was not a statistically significant difference between the hair mercury concentration of those who had 
dental amalgams and those who did not or betw een those who had had a flu vaccination in the 
past year and those who had not, although the diff erence for dental amalgams was close to being 
statistically significant.  Mi dwesterners had substantially lower median hair mercury 
concentrations than those in othe r regions of the US, even after adjusting for other factors such 
as frequency of fish consumption. 
 1. Introduction  
 
Mercury is an element that cycl es through the environment.  It enters the environment naturally 
from volcanoes, mineral deposits and evaporatio n from soil and oceans.  Anthropogenic sources 
of mercury such as emissions from coal-fired ut ility boilers (the largest source), municipal waste 
combustion, commercial/industrial boilers, and medi cal waste incinerators increase the natural 
mercury levels in the air, water, and soil7.  Mercury is most often used in alloys, thermometers, 
batteries, and dental amalgams because it is the only common metal liquid1.   
   There are three types of mercury:  elementa l mercury, organic mercury, and inorganic mercury.  
Elemental or metallic mercury is the familiar metal liquid in thermometers and is one of the most 
common forms found in the environment.  Metallic  mercury is also used in silver dental 
amalgam fillings which contain approximately 50% mercury1.  Organic mercury compounds are 
combinations of mercury with carbon.  Orga nic mercury takes several forms as some 
microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) and natu ral processes change the mercury in the 
environment from one form to another; the mo st common form being me thylmercury.  Inorganic 
mercury compounds form when mercury combines w ith elements such as chlorine, sulfur, or 
oxygen; some inorganic mercury co mpounds are used as fungicides1. 
   In the United States, coal-fired utility boilers are the biggest source (33 percent) of 
anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere7.  Mercury eventually falls from the 
atmosphere or runs off the ground into water (stream s, lakes, rivers) and accumulates in the soil 
and bottoms of water bodies.  After the mercury deposits into water, microorganisms (bacteria 
and fungi) convert it to a form of organic merc ury.  Methylmercury, a highly toxic form of 
organic mercury, accumulates in the water and is then absorbed by fish and plants near the 
source.  This bioaccumulation process continues w ith levels of mercury increasing as it moves 
 2

up the food chain8.  Mercury builds up through the food ch ain until it reaches toxic levels, many 
times greater than levels in the surrounding water, in predator animals such as predatory fish and 
mammals.8 
   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set the Reference Dose 
associated with hair mercury concentration at 1.0 µg/g 7.  Mercury is primarily considered a 
health risk to children and wome n of childbearing age because of its effects on brain and organ 
development.  Mercury can pass from mother to  child through the blood stream or through the 
mother’s breast milk1.  The EPA warns, “Offspring born of women exposed to methylmercury 
during pregnancy have exhibite d a variety of developmental neurological abnormalities, 
including the following: delayed onset of walking, delayed onse t of talking, cerebral palsy, 
altered muscle tone and deep tendon reflex es, and reduced neurol ogical test scores”7.  Mercury 
also poses problems for adults.  In general, th e nervous system is very sensitive to mercury.  
Current studies are also explor ing the risks of continuous low levels of mercury exposure in 
adults and its effects on brain functions such as memory and attention.  A recent study found no association between number of dental amalgams, which contain mercury, and cognitive 
dysfunction
2.  The study did find, however, a linear a ssociation between th e total number of 
amalgams and the urinar y mercury concentration2.  Two other recent studies explored the 
relation between mercury and th e risk of heart problems in men.  One study found a direct 
association between the risk of myocardial infarction and mercury3, while the other study’s 
results on coronary heart disease were inconclusive9. 
   Tests for mercury exposure in humans can be  performed using analysis of blood, urine, nail 
clippings, or hair samples.  The different an alyses provide different information about the 
mercury levels in the body.  Blood and urine levels  are used as markers to determine if recent 
exposure has occurred.  They are more useful  for measuring recent exposures to mercury 
because blood concentrations decrease rapidly ov er a few days if exposure is stopped.  Hair 
samples are associated mainly with methylme rcury exposures and can be used to indicate 
exposures that occurred over the past  several months or a year.  Ho wever, hair concentrations are 
not able to detect recent expos ures such as a few days prior1.  Mercury is incor porated into hair 
during the growth of hair, which is about one centimeter a month7.  Hair is a simpler means by 
which to do large studies because the samples ar e easier to obtain from a large and varied 
sampling group.  The cost is also minimized because the hair samples are simply cut from the subject’s hair and placed in a small plastic bag.  Fewer individuals would be willing to draw a 
blood sample or return a urine sample than to provide a hair sample.  The EPA presumes that 
hair mercury concentrations reflect blood mercury concentrations at the moment of hair growth
7.  
A previous mercury-in-hair study conducted duri ng the 1999-2000 National H ealth and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) concluded, “Hair Hg  [mercury] analysis in national samples of 
U.S. children and women of childbearing age pr ovide a useful biomarker for long-term Hg 
exposure”4.  
  In this study, samples of hair  are analyzed from a nationally di stributed self-selected sample.  
Participants complete a questionnaire about demographic factors and potential exposure to mercury.  A statistical analysis is  performed to relate mercury con centrations in hair to potential 
factors such as fish consumpti on and having dental amalgams.   
 
2. Methodology 
 
Study participants were recruited by Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and other nonprofit or ganizations throughout the United States through national internet 
 3

notices, regional media coverage of the research  project, special local  awareness events, and 
other publicity efforts.  Although the study is on-going, this repor t is based on the 6,583 samples 
obtained from July, 2004 to September, 2005.  The study sample is not presumed to be 
statistically representati ve of the entire U.S. population, since participants were self-selected, and 
recruitment of study participants was focused more strongly in some areas of the country than 
others.  Particular geographic areas, individuals who might be  more concerned about this 
particular health issue, indivi duals with higher-than-average fi sh consumption, and individuals 
better able to afford the small fee to participate in the study are expected to be overrepresented in 
the sample.   
   Each volunteer was sent a hair sampling kit by the Environmental Quality Institute (EQI) 
consisting of gloves, plastic sample bags, labe ls, a cardboard weighing balance designed to tip 
when approximately 0.5g of hair was added, deta iled instructions for cutting, weighing and 
labeling hair samples, and a return postage-paid mailer.  After washing their hair, each volunteer 
participant was instructed (compl ete with illustrations) on how and where to cut and weigh their 
sample.  Each sampling kit also included a deta iled research questionnaire which requests 
information on age, gender, pregnancy status, hair color, occupation, dental amalgams and 
removal, flu shot history, and, several questions regarding specifics of fish consumption habits.  Upon receipt at the EQI laboratory, samples were given a laboratory identification number and 
questionnaire data was transferre d to a computerized database.  Hair samples were weighed to 
the nearest 0.0001 gram on an analytical balanc e and digested using EPA Method 3050B with 
concentrated nitric acid and 30% hydroge n peroxide on a SCP Science Digiblock
TM graphite 
block digestor.  Final volume  of the digestate was 50ml. 
   Mercury determination was performed using EPA Method 7470A. Either a Thermo-Jarrel-Ash 22 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectromete r (AAS) or a Thermo Elemental M6 AAS with 
a V90 continuous-flow vapor system were used to determine mercury concentration in the 
digestates.   Each volunteer partic ipant was sent a confidential le tter with their individual results 
along with explanatory information regarding USEPA advisory levels. 
 
3. Results 
 
A comparison of the percentage of 16-49 year -old women grouped by total servings of fish 
consumption in this study to that in the NHANES study (Table 1) indicates that participants in 
this study tend to be greater consumers of fish  than in the NHANES study, which came from a 
random sample of the U.S. population.  This differen ce may be due to the fact that participants of 
this survey are self-selected but  also may be caused at least pa rtially by a national trend towards 
increased fish consumption from 1999-2000 to 2004-2005.  Hair mercury concentration data 
were summarized by determining the raw me dians and the proportions above the EPA’s 
Reference Dose of 1.0 µg/g for each age group - gender combination (Table 2).  The 95% 
confidence intervals for the medians were calcula ted using non-parametric  confidence intervals 
based on ranks.  Because of the potential overrepre sentation of heavy consumers of fish in the 
current study, medians and proportions represent estimates for a higher-risk group rather than for the US population as a whole.  The medians indica te that children have approximately half the 
mercury concentration levels of  the adults.  Also, among the a dults, the mercury concentration 
levels for the females are lower than for the males.

   Slightly more than 10% of women of  childbearing age in the NHANES 1999-2000 study had 
mercury concentrations greater than those the RfD of 1.0 µg/g in hair4.  In this study 
approximately 23% of 16-to-49 year old women had hair mercury concentrations greater than or 
equal to 1.0 µg/g (Table 2).

   An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model wa s used to examine the relationship between hair 
mercury (Hg) and several poten tial predictor variables and de mographic variables.  The 
distribution of mercury concentrations was positively skewed, so a logarithmic transformation was used to improve normality.   Fish consump tion categories included: canned tuna servings, 
store- or restaurant-bought fish servings, local fish servings.  A standard serving was defined as 
six ounces, and fish consumption included shellf ish consumption.  Fish frequency data were 
grouped into four categories: no fi sh consumed, fish consumed one or two times per month, fish 
consumed three or four times per month, and fish  consumed more than five times per month.  
 5

Age was grouped into five categories: less than or equal to one year, two to five years, six to 
fifteen years, sixteen to forty-nine years, and fifty or more year s.  Participants’ residence was 
grouped by the U.S. Census Bu reau’s definition of region6.  Additional variab les investigated 
included gender, race, pregnancy status, existence of silver dental amalgams, amalgams recently 
removed, and recent flu vaccinations.  Other va riables involving hair treatments (dyed or 
permed) were disregarded because they were found earlier to be non-significant factors and 
dropped from the questionnaire.  Du e to the large number of potential  effects, interactive effects 
were not considered.  A check of the residuals for normality in the final ANOVA model yielded acceptable homoskedasticity, a skewness of 0.22, an (adjusted) kurtosis of 0.80, and normality 
tests with p-values less than 0.05.  Thus, the l og transform did not completely correct for non-
normality, but did improve normality enough for th e large sample hypothesis tests considered 
here to be valid.   The reported P-values are two-tailed, and the te sts of statistical significance 
used α = 0.05.  Statistical analys es were performed with SAS software (Release 9.1, SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC). 
  The ANOVA results for the 3,850 participants w ith fully-completed ques tionnaires, indicated 
that age category, gender, geographic region, local fish servings, race, store or restaurant fish servings, and tuna fish servings  were all highly statistically si gnificant factors at the 0.05 level 
(Table 3).    The factors:  have amalgams, amalgams recently removed, a recent flu shot, and 
pregnancy status were not statis tically significant in accounting for total merc ury concentrations, 
although having amalgams (P-value = 0.070) wa s close to statisti cal significance.

   The unweighted medians and 95% confidence interv als for each level of ea ch factor considered 
were computed using the methodolog y discussed previously from the raw data.  Each factor was 
analyzed separately to include the most number of responses for each question.  Because participants in this study  probably tend to consume more fish than the general public, the 
medians are more useful for comparing levels of  factors than for estimating representative US 
concentrations. Also, because these medians are not adjusted for other factors, the results are not 
necessarily consistent with those of the ANOVA model, whic h does consider statistical 
significance of a factor after adjusting each of the levels for other factors in the model.  
Therefore, adjusted median estimates, calculated by reverse-transforming the least-square means 
from the ANOVA analysis are also provided.  These adjusted medians provide an estimate of what the median mercury of the given group would be if the individuals in that group were 
 6

equally divided into the levels of all the othe r variables considered in  the ANOVA model.  In 
particular, since the adjusted medians for a ny group from variables not reflecting fish 
consumption would assume equal proportions of individuals in each of the fish-consumption 
groups for each type of fish c onsumption, and the tuna fish and local fish actually had much less 
people in the higher groups, then the adjusted medians tend to be higher than the raw medians for 
those variables.  Thus, adjusted means are us eful only for making comparisons between groups 
within a given variable. 
  Medians for total fish consumption groups indi cate a consistent and strong positive relationship 
between mercury in hair and total fish consum ption (Table 4).  The median for people that 
consume almost no fish is 0.06 ug/g, while the median for those who consume eight or more 
servings per month is appro aching the 1.0 ug/g RfD for pregnant women.  This striking 
difference indicates that fish c onsumption is clearly the primary source of hair mercury exposure 
for most Americans. Medians for the restaurant fi sh servings per month, tuna fish servings per 
month, and local fish servings per month follow the same pattern, althoug h the range in mercury 
concentrations between low and high consumption categ ories is not as great.  This indicates that 
statistically there is no segmen t of the fish consumption sour ces that does not contribute 
significantly to mercury exposure.

1 Raw medians and confidence intervals for pregna ncy status are only based on females aged 16 
to 49 years, while least square median estimates  for pregnancy status ar e based on all the data. 
2 Least square means were not calculated becaus e the factor: total fish servings per month, was 
not included in the ANOVA model. 
 
  The participants with dental amalgams had an approximately 0.1 ug/g  larger median value than those without dental amalgams.  The fact that  the difference between the two groups is not 
statistically significant is consistent with the re sult that the difference in estimated medians is 
only 0.03 ug/g when adjusted for other factors such  as fish consumption.  A better idea of the 
strength of the relationship betw een dental amalgams and hair me rcury concentration might have 
been obtained if the number of amalgams could have been quantified for each participant.  
Unfortunately, a large percentage of participan ts left the number of amalgams question on the 
questionnaire unanswered.   Consistent with the ANOVA results medians were approximately 
the same between groups for the factors:  amal gams removed recently (last 12 months) and flu 
shot recently (last 12 months). 
  The Midwest region had the lowest median Hg  value, while the West region had the highest 
median mercury.  The Northeast and Southeast re gions medians were similar.  The median for 
Asians was considerably higher than the medi ans for the other races, while African-Americans 
had the lowest estimate.  However, the number of  responses for races other than Caucasian was 
small.  The medians for pregnancy status were only based on females age 16 to 49 and were also 
approximately the same for pregnant and non-pregnant women. 
  Summaries of the results for states with at least 100 participants and cities with at least 50 
participants are provided in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively.  These summaries reinforce the 
findings that mercury concentratio ns in hair are closely relate d to seafood consumption.  With 
the exception of Utah, whose participants had very high seafood consumption and moderate 
 8

mercury consumptions, the states that had higher seafood consumption also had higher mercury 
concentrations in hair.  New York had the hi ghest hair mercury concentrations, followed by 
Colorado, California, Oregon, Florida, Massachuse tts and Washington.  A similar pattern exists 
for the cities.  The results for two cities stand out.  Masontown PA had a relatively very low 
median mercury concentration of 0.08 ug/g.  Masontown is close to a coal fired power plant, but 
participants consumed much less s eafood than participants at most locations.  This reinforces the 
idea that mercury concentrati ons in hair are caused by cons uming food contaminated with 
mercury.  New York City has the highest hair mercury concentrations of any city with 50 or more participants.  The 191 New York City participants had a median hair mercury 
concentration of 0.88 ug/g and 47% were 1.0 ug/g or greater.  Their median number of 6 seafood 
servings consumed per month was tied the second largest amount.  Other cities with higher-than-
average hair mercury concentra tions include Portland, San Francisco, and Seattle.  Except for 
San Francisco, which had lower than typical s eafood consumption, these ci ties had the highest 
seafood consumption.

4. Summary and Conclusions. 
 
There exists a strong relationship between mercury concentration in hair and seafood 
consumption.  In this study, participants who ty pically consumed 0, 1-2, 3-7, or eight or more 
servings of seafood (including sh ellfish) per month had median mercury concentrations of 0.06 
ug/g, 0.21 ug/g, 0.46 ug/g, or 0.89 ug/g, respectivel y.  In the NHANES 1999-2000 study females 
16-49 years of age who had consumed 0, 1-2, or th ree or more servings of fish (not including 
shellfish) per month had geometric means of 0.11 ug/g, 0.20 ug/g, or 0.38 ug/g, respectively.  
The results for the lower two groups of each stud y are very comparable, especially considering 
that the NHANES results quoted here included only women aged 16-49 and did not include 
shellfish consumption with fish consumption.  The fact that the medians for the upper two 
categories in the current study are higher than  the geometric mean in the NHANES may be 
partially due to those two factors as well as the possibility that pa rticipants in th e current study in 
the 3-7 servings group may be weighted more towa rds the higher end of the group than those in 
the three-or-more group in the NHANES group.  Thus, the current results do not provide 
evidence of an increasing or a decreasi ng trend from 1999-2000 to 2004-2005 in mercury 
concentrations for a given amount  of fish consumption.  An earlier (1994) study conducted by 
Schweinsberg in Germany, of the relations hip between fish consumption and mercury 
concentration in Germany, found that subjec ts who consumed 0-400 g, 400-1,000 g, or more 
than 1,000 g per month had mean hair mercury concentrations of 0.56 ug/g, 0.94 ug/g, and 1.60 ug/g.
5  Converting to 6-ounce servings, the cons umption groups would be 0-2.4 servings, 2.4-5.8 
servings, and more than 5.8, servi ngs respectively.  Because the mean of the positively skewed 
hair mercury concentrations would be expected to be 1.5 to 2.5 times the median or geometric 
mean, these results are consistent with those of the current study a nd the NHANES study, thus 
also providing no evidence of a tim e trend in hair mercury concentrations for a given amount of 
fish consumption. 
  The current study found very little evidence of  a relationship between dental amalgams and 
mercury concentrations in hair.  In the 1994 study by Schweinsberg it was found that among 
 10

individuals who had no fish consumption, individuals with no amalgams had mean blood 
mercury concentrations of approximately 0.3 ug/L, while individuals with more than six amalgams had mean blood mercury concentration of approximately 1.0 ug/L.  In a summary of 
several studies, ADSTR estimated  the exposure contributions from  those with dental amalgams 
to range from 3-17 ug/day.
1 One possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the 
current study and other studies is that the inorganic mercury obtained from dental amalgams 
accumulates less in hair and other tissues than the methylmercury obtained from consuming fish. 
  Several demographic factors were  found to be related to mercury concentrations in hair in the 
current study.  One of the stronger relationships  is the relationship be tween region and mercury 
concentrations.  The Midwest region has raw median  mercury concentrations that are much less  
than those for the other regions of the US.  This suggests that sources of mercury exposure other 
than fish consumption may be less in the Midwest such as chlor-alkali plants or mines.  Perhaps the ANOVA adjustment does not fully take out the effect of fish consumption.  It is also possible that fish consumed in the Midwest tend to be lo wer in the food chain or that mercury pollution is 
less in Midwest water than in other US waters.  Another demographic factor  that seems hard to 
explain is the higher con centrations in Asians than in othe r races, even after adjusting for the 
level of fish consumption.  There may be simila r explanations as those for different regions.  
Also, there were not many Asians (n=240) in th e current study.  The fact that adults have 
substantially higher mercury con centrations than children after adjusting for other factors may 
again be partially due to the fact that the statisti cal adjustments are not perfect or may also be due 
to the fact that adults have accumulated a long-te rm burden that shows up in hair samples.  Men 
tend to have higher concentrations  than women but the difference in  least square medians is only 
0.1 ug/g. 
  The study described here is an ongoing study.  Periodically, the questionnaire has been revised to gather more specific information.  Since the beginning of the study, questions have been 
added to allow us to break fish consumption down more precisely.  This should allow us to 
eventually compare the additional mercury burden  caused by consuming different species as well 
as to be able to better compar e the results of this study to othe r studies.  As more samples are 
received, we should also be able to obtain mo re precise information about exposure to smaller 
subgroups of our sample, such as minority  races, pregnant women and young children.
