1Ancient forests are defined here as the world’s 
remaining forests which have been shaped largely by natural events and which are little impacted by human activities.
2Destructive logging operations are now rapidly 
expanding in East Cameroon, northern Congo-Brazzaville and Gabon.
3The G8 countries France, Japan and  Italy are major 
importers of timber from Cameroon and Gabon.

WRI, Washington DC. According to Cameroonian law, each subsidiary logging company is recog-nised as its own legal entity and is entitled to a maximum of 200,000 ha of concession area. Three French subsidiaries, SIBAF (Bolloré), CFC (Thanry) and Coron each control logging concessions totalling well over 200,000 ha.

Cameroun Données statistiques. CED.In1998-9, Thanry’s subsidiaries held some 650,000 ha of forest 
concessions in Cameroon – 16 percent of the total concession area inthat period
13.
During the MINEF investigations, Thanry’s subsidiaries were found to
be logging ‘anarchically’ and “without the least respect for the loggingarea”. They were also found to be logging undersized trees, as well aslogging in some areas without legal permits. The subsidiaries SAB andSEBC were described as “flagrant examples of companies violating allkinds of forestry laws”. The report concludes that the kind of forestexploitation carried out by these companies is “putting at stake theentire forestry policies to promote sustainable forestry management inCameroon.”
Moreover, along with another French company, Coron, Thanry’s sub-
sidiary CFC has been severely criticised for obtaining concessions byirregular procedures and for owning forest operations which are largerthan the law currently allows
14. Both Coron and CFC obtained conces-
sions through an unlawful discretionary process: a presidential decreesigned by the Prime Minister in March 1996. This is in clear violation ofthe country’s new forest legislation that requires a public and competi-tive allocation process to grant new concessions
15.
In 1996-97, Thanry’s subsidiaries produced around 460,000 m3. Their
main markets include China and the G8 country, France16.

The remaining large ancient forests of West Africa are under
threat1. Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast have already lost almost
all of their natural forest. Liberia is the only west African coun-try where large areas of ancient forest remain. But since the endof the war in 1997, foreign logging companies have been rapidlydestroying vast forest areas, operating in an environment ofalmost total lawlessness. In Central Africa, where large areas ofrelatively intact forests still remain, destructive logging opera-tions are now expanding rapidly into the heart of the CongoBasin – an area famous for its rich biological and cultural diversi-ty
2. Most logging operations in this region are highly destructive
and a significant proportion are illegal, with corruption and theviolation of indigenous peoples’ rights widespread. Despiteclaims to the contrary by the G8 governments, a substantial partof the trade in illegal timber is fuelled by demand from the inter-national market
3. Greenpeace is calling on all governments to
stop their role in this trade.The Baka ‘pygmy’ communities of
Cameroon are under threat from a
logging industry in which corruption
and the violation of indigenous 
peoples’ rights are widespread.

illegal timber trade: 
CCaammeerroooonn
June 2000

In April this year, Greenpeace documented illegal activities in the
global timber trade in its report Against the Law: the G8 and the
illegal timber trade . The report summarised examples of illegal
activities in the African timber trade, including the unauthorisedtrade in CITES-listed species
4and the harvesting of trees below
the legal size for cutting.
The response of G8 governments to the report has been to play
down the role of the international timber market in drivingdemand for the illegal production and trade of wood, and to arguethat this is largely a domestic issue
5. Thus governments seek to
minimise their role in driving this trade and limit their responsibili-ty for its environmental and social impacts.
However, such arguments are inconsistent with the
trade figures. These show that, for example, all of theindustrial roundwood produced in Gabon and at least50 percent of that produced in Cameroon is exportedas logs, sawnwood or panels – and that around half ofthese exports go to G8 and EU countries
6. 
Since the release of Against the Law , a number of
leaked reports on the forest industry in Cameroonhave revealed major illegalities in almost all conces-sions, in what has been described as “the most cor-rupt country in the world”
7. There is much evidence to suggest that 
illegality and corruption within Cameroon’sforest industry are the norm rather than theexception. 
A recent study
8financed by the World Bank
reveals that the Cameroonian government islosing millions of dollars due to fraudulentpractices and illegal logging. The least regu-lated type of logging licence, the vente de
coupe
9, is currently the most prevalent. In
1998-99, ventes de coupes accounted for
almost 200,000 of the 350,000 ha of forestallocated for cutting in that period. Thestudy indicates that in some areas up to 90percent of these logging licences are operat-ed illegally. Harvesters were found to be log-ging without a licence, overlogging the des-ignated area, logging far beyond the definedboundaries of the licence and logging afterthe licence had expired. While most of thesecutting licences are owned by Camerooniannationals, they are commonly subcontractedto foreign logging companies, which thenexport the majority of this illegally harvestedtimber.
The donor community is finally becoming
increasingly concerned about the escalating
illegal logging practices inCameroon. Discussions arecurrently underway to deter-mine how best to improvemonitoring capacity on theground as a primary tool tocurb illegal logging.
In March 2000 the Cameroonian
Government published a communiquésummarising the illegal practices foundin logging concessions in the East,South and Central provinces ofCameroon in December 1999.Today, only around one fifth
of the world’s large ancient
forests remain, most having
already been destroyed by
human activity. In West
Africa almost all of the natur-
al forest has gone,while
Central Africa now faces
increasing threat from the
rapid expansion of destruc-
tive logging operations

Illegal loggers owned by companies 
in G8 countries
Following pressure from the World Bank, the Ministry of
Environment and Forests (MINEF) of Cameroon conduct-ed a series of field inspections in the country’s East,South and Central Provinces during December 1999. TheMINEF team inspected 26 concessions allocated in 1997.The result was two internal reports detailing major illegal-ities in almost all of the concessions visited
10. Illegalities
ranged from logging outside concession areas to fraudu-lent markings on logs in order to avoid payment of tax.Yet despite the seriousness of the infractions, the penal-ties
11allocated were far too low (only 4-20 million CFA12)
to discourage the logging companies from continuingtheir illegal activities.No less than four of the logging operations found to be
operating illegally have parent companies in G8 nations:these are Bolloré, Coron and Thanry (French), and VastoLegno (Italian). Together, these four companies controlmore than  a third of all logging activity in Cameroon. The inspected subsidiaries were SIBAF (Bolloré), SAB,CFC and SEBC (Thanry), EGTF (Coron) and SEFAC (VastoLegno).
Thanry (France)
Of the European-owned companies listed in the MINEFreport, the worst offender was the French-owned Thanry,with its three inspected subsidiaries fined a total of 41million CFA. 
Thanry has numerous forestry operations in West and
Central Africa. In Cameroon, Thanry is the largest loggingcompany, operating through six subsidiaries: CFC(Compagnie Forestière du Cameroun), CIBEC (CompagnieIndustrielle du Bois au Cameroun), J Prenant, Propalm,SAB (Société Africaine des Bois) and SEBC (Sociétéd’Exploitation Forestière des Bois du Cameroun).

to honour their commitment to combat the illegal production and trade of wood and wood products. It demands that these governments:
•DO NOT buy illegal timber products
•DO NOT fund forest destruction through aid for 
unsustainable forestry
•DO NOT allow G8 countries to be markets for illegal 
timber
•DO buy wood products from sustainable certified 
forests
•DO provide urgent assistance to forest countries to 
tackle illegal logging
•DO increase the capacity for monitoring and trans-
parency throughout the production and transport of wood and wood products globally
On the 6th April 2000 - the opening day of the G8 Environment
Ministers meeting in Okinawa, Japan - Greenpeace denounced therole of Italian company Vasto Legno in illegal logging in Africa. © Greenpeace
