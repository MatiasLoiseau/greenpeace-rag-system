In May 2007, Apple announced that all of its new products
would be free from brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and
the chlorinated plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) by the end of
2008.  The following month, Apple launched its latest
product, the iPhone, to an eager US market and is now
gearing up for its release in Europe in November this year.  In
order to see what progress Apple has already made towards
meeting its pledge on hazardous chemicals and materials,
Greenpeace purchased an iPhone in Washington, DC in June
and forwarded it to laboratories in the UK for deconstruction
and analysis.

The iPhone was carefully deconstructed at the Greenpeace
Research Laboratories, based at the University of Exeter (UK),
and a selection of 18 internal and external materials and
components were subsequently forwarded to an independent
laboratory elsewhere in the UK for analysis of chemical
composition.  This analysis focused primarily on those
substances regulated under the European Union's RoHS
Directive (2005/84/EC), which prevents the use of lead,
cadmium, mercury, chromium (VI) and certain brominated
flame retardants in electrical and electronic goods.  Additional
tests were also run for certain other hazardous substances
and materials, including PVC and the toxic phthalate
plasticisers they commonly contain.

• All components tested appear to be compliant with the

requirements of the EU RoHS Directive, to the extent that
1) no cadmium or mercury were detected, 2) lead and
chromium were detected in a small proportion of samples
and at relatively low concentrations and 3) there was no
evidence for the presence of the most toxic and regulated
form of chromium (chromium (VI)) in a range of other metal-
plated components tested.

• However, half of the components analysed did test positive
for bromine, in three cases at over 1% of the total surface
chemical composition of the material, suggesting continued
widespread use of either additive or reactive brominated
flame retardants.  Although none of the BFRs covered by
RoHS could be detected in the sample with the highest
bromine content (10% by weight, in the flexible circuit board
of the phone's antenna), all forms of BFR (even if
chemically-bound into polymers) can act as a significant
source of toxic and persistent brominated pollutants once
the iPhone handset enters the waste stream.

• The presence of antimony in four of the components raises
additional concerns.  Despite its well recognised toxicity,
antimony (often used to enhance brominated flame
retardant formulations) is not currently regulated under
RoHS.

• A high level of chlorine was detected in the plastic coating
of the headphone cables, along with phthalates plasticisers
at a total of over 1.5% by weight, both characteristic of
PVC.  Although the use of PVC and phthalate esters is not
currently prohibited or even regulated under RoHS, it is
worth noting that none of the four phthalates found in this
study are permitted for use in components of toys or
childcare articles sold in Europe.

• As we were able to analyse only a small selection of the
different components and materials, it is not possible
(without a lot of additional testing) to conclude that all
materials used in the iPhone currently on sale in the USA
would comply with EU law.

The fact that a product brought newly to the US market in
June 2007 still utilises PVC and brominated flame retardants
(even if not those BFRs regulated under the RoHS Directive)
suggests that Apple is not making early progress towards its
2008 commitment to phase-out all uses of these materials,
even in entirely new product lines.  Whether the iPhone model
due for release in Europe in November 2007 will also rely on
brominated internal components and PVC headphones
remains to be seen.

If Apple really wants to reinvent the phone, it needs to design
out all hazardous substances and materials from its handsets
and peripherals.

Missed Call: iPhone's
hazardous chemicals

Introduction

Materials and methods

Analysis of internal and external components from an Apple
iPod purchased in the UK during 2007 indicated that
brominated materials and PVC were still common to many
components1.  This current study focuses on a more recent
Apple product, the iPhone, released in the USA in June 20072
and due for release on the European market in early
November.

Under European law, all electrical and electronic goods
placed on the market in the EU from July 2006 onwards must
comply with strict limits relating to a number of specific
hazardous chemicals.  Under the so-called RoHS Directive3,
homogenous materials and components must not contain
more than 0.1% by weight of the heavy metals lead,
chromium (VI) and mercury or of the organic brominated flame
retardants (BFRs) PBDEs and PBBs, and no more than
0.01% by weight of cadmium.  These requirements under
RoHS do not, however, address all hazardous chemicals and
materials commonly use in electronics.  For this reason, the
current study of the iPhone focuses not just on issues of
RoHS compliance, but also investigates the presence of other
hazardous chemical additives and materials commonly
associated with electronics, including PVC and additional
BFRs additional to those regulated under the RoHS Directive.

An iPhone was purchased in Washington, DC on 29 June
2007 and forwarded to the Greenpeace Research
Laboratories at the University of Exeter (UK) for dismantling
and analysis.  The handset was dismantled in our laboratory,
taking care to avoid contamination with dust and grease and
cross-contamination between different components.
Individual components were placed in antistatic bags for
storage prior to analysis.

A total of 18 individual components and/or materials (listed
in Table 1 below) were forwarded to an independent analytical
laboratory for analysis of surface elemental composition using
XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometry).  This analytical
technique yields data on the composition of a number of
chemical elements (with a detection limit in the range of 20
parts per million, ppm, or 0.002% of the total composition),
with a focus on those of regulatory concern under the EU
RoHS Directive (i.e. cadmium, chromium, mercury, lead and
bromine.  Identification of bromine indicates the presence of
brominated additives or polymeric materials used for fire
retardancy purposes).  In addition, XRF gives an indication of
the presence of certain other elements of environmental and
toxicological concern, including antimony (frequently used as
a synergist in brominated flame retardant formulations4 and
commonly found in electronic wastes5) and chlorine (for which
high concentrations in plastic materials commonly indicate the
presence of PVC).

Results

Detailed results from the XRF analyses are provided at
Annex 1.  In summary:-

1) no evidence was found for the presence of the heavy
metals cadmium or mercury in any of the 18 samples
analysed (above the detection limit of 20 ppm);

2) low concentrations of total chromium (100-280 ppm) were
found in some of these materials, but there is no reason to
believe that any significant quantities of the chromium
present was in the most toxic form chromium (VI).
Although it was not possible to confirm the absence of
chromium (VI) in those components testing positive for
chromium, separate chemical analysis in our laboratories
of a range of other plated components in the phone
(especially screw heads) found no evidence of
chromium (VI);

3) lead was found in four of the components/materials, at

concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 ppm, well below the
compliance limits under RoHS  (1000 ppm).  These
included the black outer casing of the phone beneath
which the antenna was located (XRF-2), one of the internal
flexible circuit boards (XRF-5), an internal rubber
component in the region of the microphone (XRF-16) and
the Apple-branded rubberised base of the USB
cradle/docking station (XRF-36);

4) bromine was detected in half of the samples tested (9),
at levels ranging from 10 ppm to a high of 100 000 ppm
(or 10% of the total surface composition of the material).
The highest concentrations were found in the flexible circuit
board which makes up the antenna (XRF-4).  Next highest
were in the headphone socket (XRF-6, 41 000 ppm) and a
circuit board inside the phone (XRF-27, 14 000 ppm).
Both the flexible antenna and the headphone socket also
yielded positive readings for antimony (though levels of
antimony could not be quantified), probably arising from
the use of antimony trioxide as a synergist in the flame
retardant mix.  Antimony was also detected in surface
samples of two of the chips tested (XRF-21 and XRF-31),
again along with significant bromine concentrations (2 400
and 3 200 ppm respectively).  Although not currently
regulated under the RoHS Directive, there are substantial
concerns regarding the toxicity and carcinogenicity of the
form of antimony used in such applications6.  There is
evidence that the presence of antimony in some
brominated polymers can also enhance the formation
of brominated dioxins and furans during combustion7,
though without disclosure of the types of brominated
materials used in the iPhone, it is not possible to
determine the relevance of this mechanism in this case;

5) one sample, namely the white headphone cable (XRF-33),
showed a high level of chlorine, indicating that the cable
casing is made from PVC.

Based on the outcome of these XRF screening analyses, two
of the 18 materials were selected for more specific and
detailed chemical analysis (using gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry) at the same analytical laboratory:-

a) the flexible circuit board which made up the antenna of the

phone (XRF-4) was analysed for the presence of the
extractable (additive) brominated flame retardants PBDEs
(excluding the 'decaBDE' form, which is currently exempted
under RoHS) and PBBs;

b) the white casing of the headphone cable (XRF-33) was
analysed for the presence of a range of phthalate esters
commonly used as plasticisers in flexible PVC, including
those phthalate esters prohibited from use in toys and
childcare articles in the EU.

The flexible plastic of the headphone cable did yield high
concentrations of extractable additives, namely phthalate
esters (more commonly known as phthalates), comprising a
total of over 1.5% of the overall weight of the material.
In total, four phthalates were detected, dominated by DEHP
(at 11,400 ppm, or 1.1% by weight), followed by DnBP
(5,070 ppm, or 0.5%), DiNP (725 ppm, or 0.07%) and DiDP
(75 ppm, or 0.007%).  These figures, together with the
presence of high levels of chlorine, strongly indicate that the
headphone cable is made of PVC, plasticised with phthalates
including those banned for use in toys and childcare articles
in the EU10.  Furthermore, these results are similar (though
higher overall) than those found in previous analyses of
headphone cables sold with an Apple iPod, for which we
have confirmed the presence of PVC (DEHP 6,000-6,900
ppm; DnBP 2 200-2,700 ppm; DiNP 2 100-2,700  ppm).

The two most abundant phthalates in the headphone cables
of both the iPhone and iPod are those classified in Europe as
'toxic to reproduction: category 2’11, as a result of their ability
to interfere with sexual development in mammals, especially in
males.  These phthalates are prohibited from use in all toys or
childcare articles put on the market in Europe (with a limit of
0.1% by weight), according to Directive 2005/84/EC.  The
two other phthalates found in the headphones sold with the
iPhone (DiNP and DiDP) are prohibited under the same
Directive from use in toys and childcare articles if they can be
placed in the mouth by children.  Although it is unclear
whether headphones from an iPod or iPhone could ever be
classified as components of toys or childcare articles, it is
clear that the presence of high levels of phthalates in such
materials could contribute to overall levels of exposure to
such chemicals for the user, including children.

7

Further details of the methods employed can be provided on
request.

Despite the very high bromine content, the flexible antenna
circuit board contained no detectable residues of PBDEs
(<30 ppm), including octa- and nona-BDE, nor of PBBs,
(though the absence of PBBs is not unexpected given that
these are historically used chemicals that are now are largely
obsolete).  Two limitations to the analysis performed are worth
noting:-

i) the limits of detection are relatively high (as the method
is designed primarily to test compliance with the RoHS
Directive), such that any small traces of PBDEs (below
regulatory significance) would not have been detected;

ii) the exclusion of decaBDE from the analysis (also for
regulatory reasons) means that even high concentrations of
this flame retardant would not have been detected in this
study.  However, were decaBDE present at high levels, it is
likely that the analyses would have detected the presence of
nonaBDE and octaBDEs which are commonly present at
significant levels as contaminants in decaBDE formulations.

While these are significant limitations, it is possible to
conclude that the flexible antenna circuit board, at least,
would be in compliance with existing EU laws on the
presence of brominated flame retardants.  Although the
possibility cannot be ruled out that the high levels of bromine
detected in this component resulted from the presence of
decaBDE or another additive brominated flame retardant not
addressed by RoHS, it seems more likely (on the basis of
experience with similar components in various brands of
laptop computers8) that the bromine is present in a reactive
polymeric form (such as cross-linked TBBPA-based
formulations) or, at least, in poorly extractable oligomeric
forms which cannot be quantified using gas chromatographic
techniques.  Whether in additive or reactive form, the
presence of such high proportions by weight of bromine in
such materials is of concern with respect to the disposal or
recycling of end-of-life iPhone handsets, as even cross-linked
organic-bound bromine can contribute to the formation of
toxic chemicals, including persistent and bioaccumulative
brominated dioxins and related compounds during thermal
destruction or processing9.

Missed Call: iPhone's
hazardous chemicals

Conclusions

Of the 18 different internal and external components and
materials tested from an Apple iPhone purchased in the USA
in June 2007, all would appear to be compliant with the
requirements of the EU's Directive on use of certain
hazardous substances in electronics and electrical goods (the
RoHS Directive).  In particular:-

• no cadmium or mercury were detected;

• lead and chromium were detected in a small proportion of

samples and at relatively low concentrations;

• there was no evidence for the presence of the toxic and
regulated form of chromium, chromium (VI),  in a range of
other metal-plated components tested (primarily screw
heads).

Nevertheless, it should be noted that:-

1) despite efforts to include as wide a range of different

components and materials as possible in the analyses, the
study was inevitably limited in scope to those 18 samples
tested.  It is not possible, therefore, to conclude from these
results that all components and materials used in the
iPhone model currently on sale in the USA would be RoHS
compliant if brought to the European market.  This would
need to be the subject of more detailed investigation;

2) half of the components analysed tested positive for

bromine, in three cases at over 1% of the total surface
chemical composition of the material, suggesting
continued widespread use of either additive or reactive
brominated flame retardants.  Although none of the
PBDEs or PBBs covered by RoHS could be detected in
the sample that yielded the highest bromine content
(100,000 ppm or 10% by weight in the flexible antenna
circuit board), even chemically bound bromine  can act as
a significant source of toxic and persistent brominated
pollutants once the iPhone handset enters the waste
stream;

3) the presence of antimony in four of the components raises
additional concerns.  Despite its well recognised toxicity,
antimony (often used to enhance brominated flame
retardant formulations) is not currently regulated under
RoHS.

4) the presence of high levels of chlorine in the plastic coating
of the headphone cables, combined with that of phthalate
esters at a total of over 1.5% by weight, strongly indicates
that the headphones supplied with the iPhone model on
sale in the USA are made from PVC.  Once again, although
the use of PVC and phthalate esters is not currently
prohibited or even regulated under RoHS, it is worth noting
that none of the four phthalates found in this study are
permitted for use in components of toys or childcare
articles sold in Europe.

5) also of concern is the fact that the battery was, unusually,

'hardwired' (glued and soldered) in to the handset,
hindering replacement and rendering material separation
for recycling or appropriate disposal more difficult, and
therefore less likely to occur.

The fact that a product brought newly to the US market in
June 2007 still utilises PVC and brominated flame retardants
(even if not those BFRs regulated under the RoHS Directive)
suggests that Apple is not making early progress towards its
2008 commitment to phase-out all uses of these materials,
even in entirely new product lines.  Whether the iPhone model
due for release in Europe in November 2007 will also rely on
brominated internal components and PVC headphones
remains to be seen.
