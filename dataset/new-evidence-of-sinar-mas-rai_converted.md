NEW EVIDENCE
SINAR MAS -
RAINFOREST AND
PEATLAND DESTRUCTION

Greenpeace has new evidence proving that Sinar Mas
continues to destroy peatlands and rainforests, pushing
orang-utans closer to the brink of extinction and
accelerating climate change.

Sinar Mas is the largest palm oil producer in Indonesia,
supplying many food and cosmetic companies worldwide,
including Nestlé via traders like Cargill. It has a long history
of breaking its environmental commitments, both in the
palm oil and the pulp and paper-sector.i

Most recently, on 4 February 2010, Sinar Mas sent a letter
to its stakeholders stating that PT SMART, one of its
subsidiaries and a member of the Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil, would stop clearing on peatlands
and in High Conservation Value (HCV) Areasii, following the
release of Greenpeace’s December 2009 report Illegal
Forest Clearance and RSPO Greenwash: Case studies of
Sinar Mas.

One of the report’s documented examples of illegal forest
clearance features a concession owned by PT Agro Lestari
Mandiri (PT ALM) in Ketapang District, West Kalimantan.

Greenpeace has new evidence from the ﬁeld, showing that
Sinar Mas continued to clear peatlands and orang-utan
habitat in its PT ALM concession, despite its commitment
to stop (see satellite images and photographs on pages 3
and 4).

This, in addition to its past actions, shows companies like
Cargill and Nestlé, that Sinar Mas’ palm oil commitments
cannot be trusted.

Greenpeace is calling on the Indonesian government to
implement a full moratorium on forest and peatland
clearance.iii

New evidence
2010
A comparison of satellite images from 23 February 2010 and 19
November 2009, conﬁrms that peatland and forest clearance
continues in PT ALM concessions. It also shows that approximately
2,300 hectares (of the 6,252 hectares identiﬁed as HCV in 2006)iv,
has been cleared by PT ALM.

On 14 March, Greenpeace visits PT ALM and documents the
continuing clearance of peat and HCV areas in PT ALM’s concession.
Greenpeace conﬁrms that by continuing to clear this area, Sinar Mas is
destroying orang-utan habitat, identiﬁed by UNEP.v Testimonies from
local villagers conﬁrm that – before the land clearing started – orang-
utans were frequently seen in the area (see satellite images and
photographs on pages 3 and 4).

A history of destruction
2009
During a Greenpeace ﬁeld investigation in April 2009, a local employee
of PT ALM conﬁrms that there is an orang-utan nest within the
concession. The investigators document active forest clearing in the
company’s concession near Sihid village, Ketapang, West Kalimantan
in an area designated as HCV in 2006. The clearing of HCV violates its
commitments under RSPO Principles and Criteria (see page 4).

2007
Satellite imagery conﬁrms that approximately 4,000 hectares of land
had already been cleared in the concession by July 2007.vi The
company only gets the necessary approval of this Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA), required to obtain a plantation permit in
December 2007, by which time it has been illegally clearing forest for
nearly two years.vii

2006
In March 2006, the director of PT ALM signs a written declaration
stating that no land clearing for plantation development has taken
place in PT ALM’s concession area.viii However, a photo of the
concession in the local newspaper shows that an inauguration
ceremony for forest clearance took place in preparation for oil palm
planting in September 2005.ix

The same year, PT SMART commissions an HCV assessment of the
concession. The assessor produces a report in October that shows
that the PT ALM estate has an extensive peat dome up to seven
metres deepx, which according to Indonesian law, means it is illegal to
clear forests or develop a plantation in this area.xi

What needs to happen?
TO PROTECT INDONESIA’S REMAINING FORESTS
CONSUMER COMPANIES MUST:

• Stop trading with companies within the Sinar Mas group. This

includes Golden Agri Resources and its subsidiaries, as well as
Sinar Mas Forestry and Asia Pulp & Paper (APP).

• Stop buying Sinar Mas palm oil and pulp products from third-

party suppliers.

BE PART OF THE SOLUTION: SUPPORT ZERO
DEFORESTATION

• Engage with the Indonesian government and industry to protect

peatlands and deliver a moratorium on forest clearance.xii

GOVERNMENTS AND INVESTORS THAT FINANCIALLY
SUPPORT THE PALM OIL SECTOR MUST:

• Stop all ﬁnancing of the Sinar Mas group of companies until they

implement a moratorium on further forest clearance for
plantations.

MAP A: PT ALM CONCESSION AREA 2004 - FOREST STILL INTACT
The original PT ALM concession boundary shown in red1 and the final boundary in orange2
laid over a satellite image3 taken on 3 June 2004. The green line highlights the forest that
was still intact in 2004.

MAP B: PT ALM CONCESSION AREA 2007 - FOREST DESTROYED
The same PT ALM concession shown in map 1 laid over a satellite image4 from August
2007. Months before the environmental impact assessment was approved, extensive
clearance in previously intact forest areas had already taken place. The green line shows
forest that was intact in 2004, while the light brown areas show the extent of forest
clearance.

The PT ALM concession boundaries laid over a satellite image5 taken on 23 February 2010.
The yellow line demarcates orang-utan habitat6 and the green line the outer boundaries of

MAP D: PT ALM CONCESSION AREA 2010
Showing deforested versus forested High Conservation Value areas, resulting from a
comparison of the 2006 High Conservation Value Forest assessment8 and a satellite image
of February 2010. In this period, about 2,300 ha of High Conservation Value Forest were
cleared partially on peat more than 3 metres deep, and therefore illegal to clear.
