BRIEFING

U.S. Oil and Gas Companies Set to Make
Tens of Billions More from Wartime Oil
Prices in 2022

MARCH 2022

With oil prices rising to near-record levels due to
Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, companies
producing oil and gas in the United States are in line
to make tens of billions in additional profits. Using
Rystad Energy’s UCube database — a database that
tracks the industry’s production economics at the
well level — we can get an insight into how much
money the industry is set to earn simply as a result
of this massive price spike. Under conservative
estimates, we find the U.S. upstream oil and gas
industry will collect a windfall of $37 to $126
billion in 2022 alone.  1

Before the most recent phase of Russia’s war
against Ukraine began, the forecast oil price for
2022 used in Rystad Energy’s upstream database
was $70 per barrel, in line with the U.S. Energy
Information Administration’s December 2021
assessment.  On March 9th, Rystad updated its
2022 oil price to $88 per barrel. But oil prices
could remain elevated if Russia’s supply is severely
curtailed, represented by the $120 case. Some
analysts believe that prices could even hit $200 per
barrel this summer.  We ran two scenarios

comparing the pre-war price of $70 per barrel with
the updated base case of $88 per barrel and a high
case of $120 per barrel. These scenarios also
include similarly higher gas prices in their analysis of
companies’ cash flow.

We found that the U.S. upstream industry is in line
to earn an additional $37 billion if the current base
case ($88) holds. If prices spike this summer and
the 2022 average is closer to $120, earnings could
soar by $126 billion compared to the pre-war case.
Total projected free cash flow for 2022 would
nearly double from $128 billion in the $70
scenario, to a potential $253 billion in the $120
scenario.

We also looked at the top ten earners.
ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Occidental lead the
pack with the potential to earn an additional $6.5
billion to $7.5 billion each if prices average $120.

Together the top ten could earn additional profits
just shy of $50 billion.

Oil executives have recently signaled that high oil
prices may not lead to a rapid increase in domestic
production.  U.S. production is still quite high
historically but is recovering from the Covid-19
downturn in oil demand,  and U.S. drillers do not
5
have the ability to immediately spin up new
production. What’s more, pressure from Wall Street
to impose “capital discipline” could lead these
companies to pocket the gains from these high
prices and return them to investors via dividends
and buybacks.  6

Much of this excess free cash flow that is boosting
oil corporation balance sheets is flowing from the
pocketbooks of U.S. consumers. It is only right for
Congress to pass a windfall profits tax and return
some of these profits to consumers, as Sen.

Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. Ro Khanna recently
proposed.  Despite misleading talk of “energy
independence” from some politicians, the U.S. can’t
drill its way to lower gasoline prices. Thanks to the
lifting of the crude oil export ban in 2015, U.S.
drillers are fully integrated with the global market;
when crude prices increase globally, they also
increase in the U.S. Booming U.S. exports of
liquefied natural gas (LNG) also tend to drive up
domestic gas prices.   8

If Congress had taken decisive action on climate
change at any time in the last three decades the
U.S. economy would be more insulated against oil
shocks, and would be enjoying the benefits of a
renewable-powered economy that is healthier,
more affordable, and more just. The answer to high
gasoline prices is not to triple-down on a failed
system.

Methodology: We use the Rystad Energy Ucube database to query the production and economics of the upstream oil and gas
industry. Upstream refers to the exploration and extraction of oil and gas. Upstream proﬁt, or free cash ﬂow, is revenue ﬂowing from
oil and gas projects to these companies after taxes and royalties, capital expenditure and operating expenditure. Debt service or other
corporate costs, e.g. executive salaries, have not been extracted from these revenues. This free cash ﬂow is therefore the proﬁt
derived at the project level from selling oil and gas produced before corporate expenses have been paid. Much of it could be used for
executive bonuses, share buybacks, and investor dividends.
