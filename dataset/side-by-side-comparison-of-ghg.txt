greenpeace.orgGreenpeace commissioned ICF  International to analyze the Obama Administra-
tion’s proposed American Recovery and Reinvestment Bill of 2009 (H.R.1) debated 
and passed by the House of Representatives in January. 
Greenpeace  concludes from ICF’s analysis that the energy provisions of the 
stimulous package would have a net positive global warming impact, reducing green -
house gas emissions by at least 61.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. 
Spending money immediately on energy efficiency upgrades to homes and buildings is the most efficient use of stimulus money to solve global warming and create green jobs and reduce energy bills. Provisions like renewable energy loan guarantees will 
likewise provide good green jobs and long term climate benefits.
ICF was able  to do detailed analysis of two portions of the proposed economic 
stimulus package entitled Clean, Efficient, American Energy and Modernize Roads, Bridges, Transit and Waterways. We excluded from the analysis those portions of the 
stimulus package where the greenhouse gas impact was impossible to determine (e.g. homeland security, Medicaid, unemployment benefits).
Energy Funding
ICF was able to quantify the carbon footprint for roughly $24 billion of $51.9 billion 
detailed in the energy portion of the stimulus package. It was calculated that this $24 
billion investment would eliminate approximately 61.5 million metric tons of annual 
carbon dioxide emissions, about 1% of current annual US emissions.
page–1This is the same as:
• Eliminating the carbon dioxide produced by the electricity used by 7.9 million 
American homes, about 8 times the number of households in the city of Chicago.
• Taking nearly 13.3 million cars off the road.
For the remaining $28 billion in slated energy spending, the majority of the itemized 
provisions were determined likely to have a net positive global warming benefit, but 
could not be quantified with details provided in the legislation. For instance, several provisions provide for research that will likely deliver long term global warming ben -
efits (e.g. smart grid and battery research).  Some provisions would have less certain environmental benefits (like the GSA Federal Fleet- ethanol question).“GHG Impact of Economic Stimulus Package”Highlights of ICF International analysis:

page–2Weatherizing homes  and buildings and improving the energy efficiency of 
buildings provide the largest net greenhouse gas reductions and cost savings in the 
stimulus package.  These provisions also proved the easiest to quantify. Some ICF 
findings include:
• Smart Appliances  - Retiring old refrigerators would likewise deliver large carbon 
benefits and in turn, save consumers on electric bills.
• Helping consumers install florescent light bulbs would provide immediate payback 
in terms of carbon and energy savings.   
• Local Government Energy Efficiency Block Grants generates an annual $3 billion in 
energy savings with a $6.9 billion investment.
• Energy Efficiency Housing Retrofits generate $1.25 billion in savings on a stimulus 
investment of $2.5 billion and save 87.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over the life of the programs’ energy efficiency improvements.
• Home Weatherization spending of  $6.2 billion investment could reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions by at least 8 million metric tons annually and 131 million metric tons 
over the lifetime of the insulation improvements.
Transportation Funding
ICF analyzed the potential impact of $30 billion slated for highway construction under 
the provision entitled Modernize Roads, Bridges, Transit and Waterways.
• Spending all the stimulus money on new highways would have roughly 10-50 times 
the annual carbon impact of the same money spent on public transportation (light rail) 
or the repair of existing roads.  
• In the worse case scenario, new highways would generate over 250 million tons of  
net additional CO2 emissions over the lifetime of the road.  In contrast, public transit 
projects of the same capacity would generate only 4 million tons of net carbon dioxide 
over its lifetime
• After construction phase related emissions, public transit saves up to 15 million 
tons over its lifetime.“GHG Impact of Economic Stimulus Package”Highlights of ICF International analysis:
