IN THE PIPELINE

RISKS FOR FUNDERS OF TAR SANDS PIPELINES

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The tar sands in Northern Alberta are located
a long distance from major crude oil markets.
In order to proceed with a new project,
companies need to feel confident that they
will have affordable access to these markets.
Assuming other conditions are right, and in the
absence of oil prices consistently over $90,
building new pipeline infrastructure is the only
way that future tar sands expansion projects
would achieve rates of return high enough to
get a green light from investors.1

Three major new tar sands pipeline projects
are proposed: in Canada, Kinder Morgan’s
Trans Mountain Expansion project running
west to the British Columbia (BC) coast.
TransCanada’s Keystone XL is intended to run
from the Canadian town of Hardisty, Alberta
to Steele City, Nebraska in the United States,
passing through Saskatchewan and the states
of Montana and South Dakota.2 In parallel with
these efforts to build new pipelines, Enbridge
has pursued incremental expansions to its
existing Mainline system. Enbridge’s proposed
Line 3 Replacement Program (the Line 3
expansion) will run from Alberta to Wisconsin
and cross through Minnesota.

These projects carry many of the same
potential risks for banks and investors as
arose with the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL)
including a lack of and/or inadequate process
around Free, Prior, and Informed Consent
(FPIC) from all Indigenous Nations and Tribes
along or impacted by the proposed pipeline
routes and the risk of contamination of
drinking water in the event of a spill. However,
the willingness of many banks to arrange
or provide financing for tar sands pipelines
suggest that they have failed to learn from
the media, investor and consumer criticism
arising from DAPL and appear to be relying on
outdated or inadequate risk assessment and
mitigation frameworks.

construction and operation of any of the
proposed tar sands pipelines. It provides
information on the current status of the
regulatory approval process for each of
the proposed pipelines, outlines the extent
of the opposition from First Nations and
Tribes and local communities, and details the
potential climate and local environmental
risks associated with these projects. It also
examines the prospects for future growth
in tar sands production in light of shifting
market dynamics and the impacts of a lack of
expanded production on the financial viability
of the proposed pipelines.

The report makes a number of
recommendations for potential pipeline
financiers and proposes questions institutional
investors might ask in order to assess the
measures taken by banks to identify risks
and the ways in which these risks might by
mitigated and managed.

THE PIPELINES (Section 1)
Each of the proposed pipeline projects is now
facing growing public opposition. Much of
this opposition is driven both by concern for
the climate and environmental impacts of tar
sands expansion and concern for the direct

impacts on communities on the frontlines of
development. The Trans Mountain Expansion
project, Keystone XL and the Line 3 expansion
already face legal challenges.

APPROVAL PROCESS: STATE OF PLAY
Trans Mountain Expansion Project
The Canadian federal government granted
its approval for the Kinder Morgan Trans
Mountain Expansion project on 30 November
2016, subject to Kinder Morgan meeting or
exceeding all 157 of the binding conditions
set out by the National Energy Board (NEB).
These conditions address potential impacts
on Indigenous communities, the protection of
local wildlife and the offset of greenhouse gas
emissions during construction.3

On 10 August 2017 the provincial
government of British Columbia announced it
had secured external legal counsel to advise
the government in legal action related to Trans
Mountain Expansion project. The provincial
government has also indicated that it does not
believe that the Province has fulfilled its duty
of meaningful consultation with Indigenous
people concerning this project. The BC
government argues that duty must be fulfilled
as consultation relates to environmental
assessment certificate requirements, and

1

that until these consultations are completed
in a way that meets the Province’s legal
obligations, work on the project on public
lands cannot proceed.4 In the interim, Kinder
Morgan can proceed with preparatory work
that does not require any provincial permits
and takes place on private lands but cannot
undertake significant construction activity
outside of its Westridge terminal.

In September 2017, following a company blog
post5 stating that company representatives
were undertaking certain works, the regulator
– the NEB – ordered the company to cease
such works as they were not authorised.6
Kinder Morgan has asked for a waiver on the
grounds that being unable to undertake the
works might delay completion of the Trans
Mountain Expansion project.7

There are 17 current separate legal
proceedings against Kinder Morgan’s Trans
Mountain Expansion project.8 These cases
include 10 individual First Nations challenges
as well as cases from NGOs and the cities of
Vancouver and Burnaby.

Keystone XL
TransCanada, after being denied the
necessary cross-border federal permit by
President Obama in 2015,9 received the
relevant permit from the US Department of
State in March 201710 following a presidential
executive order signed in January.

TransCanada still requires a Nebraska state
permit from the Nebraska Public Service
Commission (PSC). The PSC expects to make
a decision on or before 23 November 2017.

The decision, regardless of outcome, will
likely be appealed – if approved, the permit
will be appealed by environmental and social
advocacy groups opposing the pipeline
construction through Nebraska. If denied,
TransCanada could appeal.

If the company receives the necessary
approval and decides to proceed, it will likely
be required to file eminent domain petitions in
Nebraska, a lengthy and contentious process
for the company which resulted in multiple
lawsuits during the first proposed Keystone
project from 2012 to 2015.11

TransCanada will make a final investment
decision on Keystone XL sometime later in
the year.12

A lawsuit has been filed by the Natural
Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club
and others challenging the State Department’s
approval.13 Dakota Rural Action, the Intertribal
Council on Utility Policy, and the Yankton
Sioux Tribe have filed an appeal with the South
Dakota Supreme Court challenging that state’s
permit for the pipeline.14

Line 3 Expansion
Enbridge has applied to the Minnesota Public
Utilities Commission (PUC) for a Certificate
of Need and a pipeline Routing Permit for
their proposed Line 3 expansion.15 These
two permit requirements are a necessary
step before Enbridge can commence
construction in Minnesota.16 Construction
of the pipeline has already begun in Canada
and Wisconsin. The PUC is expected to
make their final decision in April 2018.
The Minnesota Commerce Department
has issued a statement opposing the Line
3 expansion on the grounds that “serious
environmental and socioeconomic risks and
effects outweigh limited benefits.”17 In Canada
where construction has already commenced,
the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs has filed a
legal challenge to the approval of the Line 3
expansion.

FUNDING THE PIPELINES
In June 2017, a syndicate of banks signed a
credit agreement with Kinder Morgan which
included a CDN $4bn pipeline construction
loan. In addition Kinder Morgan raised £1.7bn
via an IPO of shares in its pipeline subsidiary.18
TransCanada (Keystone XL) and Enbridge Inc.
(Line 3 expansion) have yet to finalise funding
arrangements. The use of existing credit
facilities, the issue of bonds and the placement
of shares are potential funding mechanisms.

INDIGENOUS AND COMMUNITY
OPPOSITION (Section 2)
The proposed tar sands pipeline projects
face opposition from First Nations and Tribes,
local communities and landowners, and
environmental groups.

The proposed tar sands pipeline projects do
not have the Free, Prior, and Informed Consent
(FPIC) of all Indigenous Nations and Tribes
along or impacted by the proposed pipeline
routes as called for in the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples.19 Over 150 First Nations and Tribes
across Canada and the US have signed the
Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion.20
The Treaty is an expression of Indigenous
Law and opposes the use of the signatories’
Indigenous territories and coasts for new or
expanded pipeline infrastructure projects that
would facilitate the expansion of the tar sands.

130 First Nations and their allies have signed
the Save the Fraser Declaration21 outlining
their opposition to the (now abandoned)
Northern Gateway pipeline and to other
similar tar sands projects crossing their lands,
territories and waterways – which would
include Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain
Expansion project,22 also currently the subject
of 10 legal challenges from First Nations in
Canada alleging infringements of their rights.23

A recent Nebraska poll released by the Sierra
Club and conducted by Public Policy Polling
found that 58% of Nebraska voters believe
clean energy like wind and solar will benefit the
state more than investing in fossil fuel projects
such as the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.24

Active on-the-ground resistance to the
pipelines has already begun. Actions already
ongoing against the Line 3 expansion include
multiple, permanent, Indigenous-led spirit
camps and resistance camps25 as well as
direct action protest in Wisconsin, where
construction of the pipeline has already
begun.26 On 5 September, members of the
Secwepemc Nation constructed the first
of 10 tiny houses along the proposed pipeline
route for the Trans Mountain Expansion
project.27

Approximately 100 landowners in Nebraska
continue to resist Keystone XL and refuse
to agree to the company’s right-of-way for
the proposed route.28 They have consistently
voiced their opposition to the company
building the pipeline through their property.29
Several landowners have built large solar
installations on their property in the direct
path of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.30

CLIMATE RISK: PIPELINES ARE
KEY TO THE EXPANSION OF
THE TAR SANDS (Section 3)
An analysis of 27 of the tar sands projects
cancelled since 2010, found that 14 – including
BP’s Sunrise and Shell’s Carmon Creek – were
rendered uneconomic by the combination of
2015 oil price expectations and the additional
cost of rail. The lack of pipeline access pushed
them over the edge, as the additional cost of
rail saw these projects become unprofitable.
These 14 projects are associated with over
60% of the reserves held in all 27 projects.31
If no new pipelines are built there will be no
pipeline space available for tar sands production
growth beyond that which arises from some of
the projects already under construction.

Noting the role of pipelines in unlocking new
expansions in tar sands production, we can
estimate the cumulative emissions impact of
each pipeline.32

ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE
TAR SANDS PIPELINES (Section 4)
The success of the proposed new tar sands
pipelines which rely on producers committing
to multi-year contracts for pipeline capacity
will depend on the continued confidence of
producers in the expansion of the tar sands
themselves. Growth in the tar sands is in turn
dependent on market conditions (in addition
to market access infrastructure and a lack of
climate policy), including the global demand
for oil in the context of alternative supplies at
lower prices. At current oil prices of around
$50, new tar sands production will not expand
regardless of whether pipelines are built.

However, at oil prices in the range of $65-
70/bbl new pipelines can be a determinative
factor in unlocking new tar sands production.33
A number of factors impacting those market
conditions means that growth in the tar sands
is far from guaranteed.

Since late 2014 oil prices have fallen
dramatically and currently remain well below
the break-even price required for new tar
sands projects to go forward (see Figure 6 on
page 19). As a result, the Canadian oil industry
has not sanctioned construction of any major
new projects that would significantly increase
the overall supply of crude oil available for
export from Canada, since 2014.34 The high
prices of 2013 led to a level of optimism in the
industry which has rapidly eroded. Only one
small project was approved in 2015 and two
in 2016. Medium term price outlook does not
provide confidence that new projects will get
a green light.

Many industry analysts35,36 believe this is a
structural market shift driven in part by the
flexibility of US shale oil production and slowing
global demand growth, with Shell CEO Ben van
Beurden suggesting that the industry is now
operating in a “lower forever” oil price era.37

A flattening in demand (both globally and from
key markets) would limit production growth
in the tar sands, which in turn will necessarily
limit demand for crude oil transportation
services. In September, China’s vice minister
of industry and information technology
announced that China would set a deadline
for automakers to end sales of fossil-fuel-

powered vehicles.38 This announcement
raises questions for Kinder Morgan which
has pitched its Trans Mountain Expansion
project as a way to reach the rapidly growing
Chinese market. Kinder Morgan has publicly
stated that without a growing demand for
oil in key markets, its pipeline could suffer
from a reduced supply of crude oil and
other products.39

The exodus of international oil companies from
the tar sands supports arguments questioning
the province’s long-term prospects.

Expert evidence40 submitted to the State
of Minnesota Public Utilities Commission
regarding the Line 3 expansion argues that
there is no need to construct the project,
because crude oil supply from western Canada
is unlikely to expand in volume in the future.
Similar arguments have been made in relation
to Keystone XL in addition to issues around an
over-supplied refining market in the Gulf of
Mexico area.41 TransCanada recently extended
the bidding period for Keystone XL capacity
which suggests that for whatever reasons
they have not yet secured sufficient numbers
of commitments.42

Political unpredictability in the US around
crucial issues such as the North American Free
Trade Agreement and fears of a border tax
adjustment all provide reasons for bankers
and investors to closely scrutinise the financial
viability of the tar sands pipelines and the
wider corporate financial impact of their
commercial failure or underperformance.

LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISK
(Section 5)
SPILL RISK
The proposed tar sands pipeline projects
carry a risk of negative environmental impacts
including the contamination of drinking water
from leaks. Analysis of public data from the
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (PHMSA) for the period
from 2010 to date43 shows that the three
companies proposing to build three tar sands
pipelines – TransCanada, Kinder Morgan,
Enbridge, and their subsidiaries – have seen
373 hazardous liquid spills from their US
pipeline networks from 2010 to present.
These spills released a total of 63,221 barrels
of hazardous liquids during that time period
– including Enbridge’s 20,082 barrel diluted
bitumen (tar sands-derived product) spill into
the Kalamazoo River in 2010.

Over the past 10 years, the US crude oil
pipeline system as a whole has averaged an
annual total of one significant incident and
570 barrels released per 1,000 miles of
pipe. Assuming these rates, the Keystone XL
pipeline could see 59 significant spills over

a 50-year lifetime. TransCanada reported a
much a lower estimate of 11 significant spills44
but an independent scientific assessment
concluded that they relied upon overly-
optimistic assumptions.45 Similarly, the Line 3
expansion could see 51 significant spills over
a 50-year lifetime. An incident is considered
“significant” by PHMSA if it involved a fatality,
a hospitalized injury, $50,000 or more in
costs, more than 50 barrels of oil or >5 barrels
of highly volatile liquids (HVL) spilled, or
resulted in an unintentional fire or explosion.

In Canada since 1961, the existing Trans
Mountain pipeline has reported 82 spills to
Canada’s National Energy Board, including spills
of greater than 500 barrels in 2005, 2007,
2009 and 2012.46

CLEAN-UP COMPLICATIONS
Cleaning up oil spills in water is an inherently
difficult task. In typical situations only a
fraction of the spilled oil can be recovered by
deploying booms and skimmers, or by other
methods. Diluted bitumen (dilbit) spills pose an
especially difficult clean-up challenge due to
the properties of the oil. Laboratory tests and

real-world pipeline spills have shown that
the ultra-heavy bitumen separates from its
lighter diluents and can sink to the bottom
of waterways.47

A number of reports have criticized existing
federal standards for pipeline safety and
oil spill response, both for their general
inadequacy48 and the need for special
precautions related to dilbit.49 The US National
Academies report on dilbit highlighted the
inadequacies of existing regulations, calling on
the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration and Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to implement improvements,
stating: “Broadly, regulations and agency
practices do not take the unique properties
of diluted bitumen into account, nor do they
encourage effective planning for spills of
diluted bitumen”.50

DRINKING WATER
Safe, clean drinking water is fundamental
to public health. When an oil spill occurs,
communities may have to shut down existing
water supplies. In July 2016, for example, a
pipeline operated by Husky spilt 90,000 litres

4

(566 barrels) of heavy crude and diluent into
the North Saskatchewan River, jeopardizing
drinking water supplies for thousands of
people downstream. The spill forced the
communities of North Battleford, Prince
Albert and Melfort to shut their intakes from
the river and find other water sources for
almost two months.51

Proposed pipelines could threaten the
water supplies of many communities.

Trans Mountain Expansion Project
The proposed Trans Mountain Expansion
project has a total of 246 potential
watercourse crossings along the proposed
route in Alberta and 1,109 potential
watercourse crossings in British Columbia, of
which 354 are fish-bearing.52 It crosses over
aquifers which provide drinking water to the
communities of Abbotsford, Coldwater53 and
the city of Chilliwack.54

Keystone XL
The proposed route of the Keystone XL
pipeline would cross 1,073 surface bodies of
water, including 56 perennial streams.55 One
expert noted the Platte Valley and the Platte
River crossing as a particular “weak link” for
Keystone XL due to a high water table and a
shallow pipe depth.56 The Final Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) also
identifies a number of tribal and municipal
water resources downstream from Keystone
XL water crossings.57

In addition to threats to surface water, much
discussion has focused on Keystone XL’s
potential impacts to groundwater, particularly
the Ogallala (or High Plains) aquifer, which is
found under much of Nebraska and extends
southward to Texas. The Northern High Plains
aquifer provides 78% of the water supply and
83% of irrigation water in Nebraska. Overall
the aquifer holds 3.25bn acre-feet of water
and supplies water to 170,000 wells.58

Experts have pointed out that claims that a
pipeline spill would contaminate the “entire”
aquifer are overblown, although concerns
about significant local impacts to the aquifer
and wells are reasonable.59

The Stansbury assessment60 found that a
worst-case discharge of 189,000 barrels could
lead to an underground plume of carcinogenic
dilbit components such as benzene, with the
potential to contaminate billions of gallons of
water.61 Risks to the local aquifer would vary
depending on the local geology and the height
of the water table in the region impacted by
the spill. TransCanada has already re-routed the
pipeline once to avoid the Sand Hills region in
western Nebraska, an ecologically sensitive area
whose characteristics (high water table and
sand dune formations) make it particularly risky
for spills.62

Line 3 Expansion
The proposed Line 3 expansion would deviate
from the existing Line 3 route for one section
in Minnesota, and would use the existing route
for the rest of its length. The proposed route
would require 227 surface water crossings,
including 46 waters designated for either
state use or as sensitive surface waters, and
seven navigable river crossings.63

In Minnesota, the project would cross
25,765 acres of high vulnerability water table
aquifers, 26,382 acres of high groundwater
contamination susceptibility, 16,299 acres
of high pollution sensitivity, and 87 acres of
wellhead protection areas. 304 domestic wells
lie within the project’s ‘Region of Interest’.64

Minnesota’s natural wild rice fields,
representing an “important social and cultural
component for American Indian tribes and
rural Minnesota communities”,65 could be
threatened by a pipeline spill.

TANKER TRAFFIC
Trans Mountain Expansion Project
The expanded capacity of the Trans Mountain
pipeline could lead to as much as 590,000
additional barrels per day arriving at the
pipeline terminal in British Columbia. The
added oil would be loaded onto an additional
348 tanker ships per year, on top of existing
tanker traffic through the Salish Sea. The
tankers could head to refineries in Washington,
California, or across the Pacific to supply
markets in Asia.66

FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
As Enbridge’s 2010 Kalamazoo River disaster
has shown, a pipeline spill can bring with it
significant penalties, clean-up and settlement
costs. In 2016, the EPA settled with Enbridge
for $177 million in connection with that spill and
another incident near Romeoville, IL.67 The total
represented $61 million in Clean Water Act
fines, $110 million in spill prevention safeguards,
and $5.4 million in government costs.

That fine comes on top of at least $1.2 billion
in clean-up costs disclosed by Enbridge in a
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing.68 That total included “$551.6 million
spent on response personnel and equipment,
$227 million on environmental consultants
and $429.4 million on professional, regulatory,
and other costs.” The company estimated it
had an additional $219 million in costs yet to
be paid. Enbridge also spent nearly $1 billion
reviewing the safety of its pipeline network
and another $1.6 billion to replace the entire
Line 6B pipeline.69

The Kalamazoo River spill is not Enbridge’s only
regulatory violation. A database of US federal
enforcement actions contains a total of 30
penalty records totalling over $180 million in
fines since 2010. The majority of these (22)
were violations of environmental regulations,
but the total also includes workplace and other
safety violations. One notable example is a
$2.4 million fine from the US Department of
Transportation for a 2007 incident where two
Enbridge employees lost their lives responding
to a pipeline leak.70

The same database showed that Kinder
Morgan had 55 penalty records since 2010
(of which 27 were environmental violations)
totalling $4.3 million in fines.71 Kinder Morgan
was also fined $5.3 million for Clean Water Act
violations because of three spills in 2004-5
along its Pacific Operations unit in California,
and its subsidiary Plantation Pipeline was fined
$725,000 for four spills between 2000-6 in
the US Southeast.72

TransCanada had eight environmental
violations totalling $183,000 in fines.73

ALIGNING FUNDING DECISIONS
WITH CLIMATE ACTION AND
BANK POLICIES (Section 6)
Financial deals supporting tar sands pipelines
appear to be at odds with some of the banks’
own statements and actions on matters
including climate change, human rights
and World Heritage sites. Banks and their
investors run the risk that their short-term
lending decisions – on projects such as tar
sands pipelines – will, through the carbon
lock-in they enable, undermine their other
medium to long term actions on climate.
Facilitating the expansion of the tar sands is
incompatible with the ambitions of the Paris
Agreement and with an orderly transition to
a low-carbon economy.

JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Canada, TD,
Barclays and Wells Fargo are all signatories
to the Equator Principles74 which state that
projects with adverse impacts on Indigenous
peoples require Free, Prior, and Informed
Consent in line with the IFC (International
Finance Corporation) Performance Standards
on Environmental and Social Sustainability.
The Equator Principles allow banks to forego
this FPIC requirement in countries like the US
and Canada (which the principles define as
“Designated Countries”) assuming that in such
countries adequate protections exist under
law for rights of Indigenous peoples.

As the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy
demonstrated in stark and unacceptable
terms, national regulatory review processes in
Designated Countries do not provide a failsafe
guarantee that a project has obtained the FPIC
of communities impacted by a project. Bank
risk departments can no longer assume that
compliance with the Equator Principles will,
in itself, mitigate reputation risks for alleged
complicity by banks in potential human rights
violations. In line with both the spirit of the
Equator Principles and their role in determining
and mitigating risk, signatory banks should
refuse to fund projects lacking FPIC regardless
of the jurisdiction in which they occur. Ten
Equator Principles banks have recently called
for the IFC FPIC standard to be applied in
all countries.75

In light of the lack of FPIC from all potentially
impacted First Nations and Tribes as set out
in Section 2, providing finance to any of the
pipelines appears to contradict JPMorgan

Banks and their investors run the risk that their short-term
lending decisions – on projects such as tar sands pipelines –
will, through the carbon lock-in they enable, undermine their
other medium to long term actions on climate.

Chase’s human rights policy which states:
“For transactions where we can identify
that the use of proceeds may have the
potential to impact Indigenous Peoples, we
expect our clients to demonstrate alignment
with the objectives and requirements
of IFC Performance Standard 7 on
Indigenous Peoples, including with respect
to circumstances requiring Free, Prior and
Informed Consent.”76 This wording does not
draw any distinction based on the location
of the proposed project although there is a
separate requirement that transactions “that
fall under the scope of the Equator Principles
must demonstrate compliance with these
requirements”.77 JPMorgan Chase should
clarify the interplay between these two
statements and whether the bank requires
clients to obtain FPIC regardless of the
location of the relevant project.

Financing Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain
Expansion project appears to conflict with
TD’s policy which states that TD does not
finance transactions relating to activities
within World Heritage sites.78 Approximately
80km of the expanded pipeline will run
through Jasper National Park – a World
Heritage Site – and ‘reactivation’ activities
will possibly be carried out within the park.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
(Section 7)
POTENTIAL FUNDERS
We believe, given the range of potential
climate, human rights and local environmental
impacts associated with tar sands pipelines,
that financial institutions should not finance,
arrange and/or underwrite the provision of
finance for the construction, expansion and/
or operation of tar sands pipelines, whether
in the form of project-specific lending, general
corporate lending (without restrictions on
the purpose of facilities), corporate bonds
or shares to or in any of Kinder Morgan,
TransCanada, and Enbridge and/or their
subsidiaries.

EXISTING LENDERS
We believe existing lenders to the Kinder
Morgan, TransCanada and Enbridge corporate
groups should:

f  sell their existing stake in all or confirm
that they will not participate or arrange
the renewal of any of the existing credit
facilities provided to each of Kinder
Morgan, TransCanada, and Enbridge, and/
or their subsidiaries, if such facilities may
be used, directly or indirectly, to finance
the construction, expansion, and/or
operation of tar sands pipelines; and

f  confirm that they will neither participate in,
arrange, nor underwrite any future credit
facilities to, or any issue of securities by,
those companies and/or their subsidiaries
which may be used, directly or indirectly,
to finance the construction, expansion,
and/or operation of tar sands pipelines.

BANKS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS
IN TAR SANDS PRODUCERS AND
PIPELINE COMPANIES
We believe that banks and other financial
institutions should review their overall financial
exposure to tar sands companies – including
via pipeline companies – and take steps to
ensure the compatibility of their lending and
investment policies and practices for such
companies with:

i.  the prudent mitigation of climate risk and
the ambitions of the Paris Agreement; and
ii.  international best practice on human rights.

INVESTORS IN BANKS
We believe that institutional investors in banks
should engage with their investee companies
to understand whether the various risks
associated with financing tar sands pipelines
are being adequately assessed, mitigated and
managed. In Section 7, we suggest questions
that institutional shareholders may wish to
ask of banks.

INTRODUCTION

Pipelines give Canadian tar sands producers an
affordable, reliable means to get oil to market.
While there is ample pipeline capacity for oil
from existing and under-construction tar sands
projects, there is no room for new expansion
– this is why the industry lobbies so hard for
new pipelines, and is also an important reason
(alongside low oil prices) that no new tar sands
projects are being developed.79

It is estimated that the Keystone XL pipeline
and the Trans Mountain Expansion project
could add  capacity of 830,00080 and
590,00081 barrels per day respectively.
Enbridge’s Line 3 would initially increase
capacity from 390,000 to 760,000 barrels
per day, but in its filing with the Minnesota
Public Utility Commission,82 Enbridge
indicated that total capacity would ultimately
be 915,000 barrels per day, resulting in
an increase of 525,000 barrels per day.
Facilitating the expansion of the tar sands is
incompatible with the ambitions of the Paris
Agreement and with an orderly transition to
a low-carbon economy.83

Each of Kinder Morgan, TransCanada and
Enbridge has or will likely seek finance –
whether from dedicated project loans, the
renewal of general corporate credit facilities,
equity or bond issues – for the construction
and operation of their respective tar sands
pipelines. Lenders and investors will therefore
have to determine whether providing finance
for such projects presents an appropriate risk/
return profile.

In addition to the climate risks associated with
the proposed tar sands pipelines, they face
intense and organised opposition from local

communities and First Nations and Tribes
along the proposed routes. The companies’
track record on pipeline spills84 give rise to
concern in light of the thousands of water
systems potentially affected. The decline in
the anticipated unchecked growth of the tar
sands since 2014 also provides reasons to
scrutinise very closely claims regarding the
long-term economic viability of the pipelines.

This report is written for banks, their
institutional shareholders, and for those
financial institutions considering financing or
arranging finance – through the purchase

or underwriting of corporate bonds or
shares – the construction and operation of
any of the proposed tar sands pipelines. It
outlines the financial and reputation risks
that banks, their investors, and investors in
pipeline companies could face in arranging and
providing finance for companies intending to
build tar sands pipelines. We make a number
of recommendations for potential pipeline
financiers and we suggest questions for bank
investors to ask to understand whether the
various risks are being adequately assessed,
mitigated, and managed.

In addition to the climate risks associated with the proposed tar sands pipelines, they face
intense and organised opposition from local communities and First Nations and Tribes
along the proposed routes. The companies’ track record on pipeline spills give rise to
concern in light of the thousands of water systems potentially affected. The decline in
the anticipated unchecked growth of the tar sands since 2014 also provides reasons to
scrutinise very closely claims regarding the long-term economic viability of the pipelines.

Until 2010, pipeline expansions and refinery
conversions had marched in lockstep with
tar sands production growth. Having met the
capacity of the Midwest refineries, the tar
sands sector planned to redirect production to
the US Gulf Coast, the location of the largest
concentration of refining capacity in the world,
which Keystone XL was originally designed to
reach (via Cushing, OK) by 2012. As well as
Keystone XL, three other major new tar sands
pipelines were proposed: Kinder Morgan’s
Trans Mountain Expansion project and
Enbridge’s Northern Gateway, both running
west to the British Columbia coast, and
TransCanada’s Energy East to New Brunswick
on the east coast.

Keystone XL was repeatedly delayed due
to opposition from environmentalists,
landowners, Indigenous groups and
municipalities, and ultimately rejected
by President Obama in November 2015.
Although President Trump reversed President
Obama’s rejection of Keystone XL, the pipeline
faces strong opposition from a number of
stakeholders and doubts have been raised as
to its economic viability85 (See Section 4).

Just two weeks after Obama’s 2015 rejection
of Keystone XL, the recently elected Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a
plan to ban tanker traffic in northern BC,86
effectively ending the prospects of Northern
Gateway, which had been looking unlikely in
spite of receiving federal approval from the
previous Harper government, especially due
to First Nations concerns about damage to
the economy, culture and rights. The project’s
demise was confirmed in June 2016 when
the Federal Court of Appeal overturned
the original approval.87 Soon thereafter the
Canadian government confirmed that it would
not proceed with Northern Gateway.

On 5 October 2017 TransCanada announced
the cancellation of Energy East.88 It had faced
opposition from unions, First Nations and the
municipalities across Quebec.

In parallel with these efforts to build new
pipelines, Enbridge has pursued incremental
expansions to its existing Mainline system.
While some expansions have occurred in
recent years, new incremental additions
such as the proposed Line 3 are now facing
growing public opposition, especially in
the US Midwest. Much of this opposition
is driven by concern for the climate and
environmental impacts of tar sands expansion,
as well as concern for the direct impacts on
communities on the frontlines of development
(Section 2).

1.1: APPROVAL PROCESS:
STATE OF PLAY
TRANS MOUNTAIN EXPANSION PROJECT
Permitting process
The Canadian federal government granted
its approval for the Kinder Morgan Trans
Mountain Expansion project on 30 November
2016, subject to Kinder Morgan meeting or
exceeding all 157 of the binding conditions
set out by the National Energy Board (NEB).
These conditions address potential impacts
on Indigenous communities, the protection
of local wildlife, and the offset of greenhouse
gas emissions during construction.89

While interprovincial pipelines (such as this
project) are within federal jurisdiction, many of
the complementary requirements (construction
of access roads or transmission lines, for
example) lie within provincial jurisdiction. The
provincial government can attach conditions
related to areas of provincial authority that
go beyond those imposed by the federal
government in its approval of the project.
Furthermore, the provincial government has a
constitutional and moral obligation to fulfil its
duties to consult and accommodate potentially
affected First Nations before issuing provincial
approvals and permits required for the Trans
Mountain Expansion project, and it cannot
authorise an unjustifiable infringement of
Aboriginal title or rights.90

On 10 August 2017 the provincial
government of British Columbia announced
it had secured external legal counsel to
advise the government in the legal action
related to Trans Mountain Expansion project
and has indicated that it doesn’t believe
that the Province has fulfilled its duty of
meaningful consultation with Indigenous
people concerning this project, including
consultations regarding potential impacts to
Aboriginal rights and title – a responsibility
that has been identified in a number of court
cases. In particular, the government argues
that duty must be fulfilled as consultation
relates to environmental assessment
certificate requirements and that until these
consultations are completed in a way that
meets the Province’s legal obligations, work on
the project on public lands cannot proceed.91

Kinder Morgan – acting without authority
In a company blog post dated September
12, 2017, Kinder Morgan stated that its
representatives were “temporarily installing
snow fencing flat down onto some sections
of streambed that are intersected by the
pipeline construction right-of-way and
sections immediately downstream.”93 This
came to the attention of the NEB, who two
days later issued a letter which “orders the
company building the line from Edmonton to
Burnaby, B.C., to stop installing the mats until
it has obtained all approvals from the board
to allow the start of construction in those
areas.”94 According to a statement from the
NEB, it “considers this to be an activity within
the definition of construction which is set
out in the Project Certificate, and the start of
construction has not yet been authorized in
these areas.”95 It goes on to confirm that “all
field activity associated with the installation
of the five remaining deterrents scheduled for
fall 2017 has ceased” and that “all applicable
condition authorizations are required before
construction can commence.”96

Kinder Morgan Canada has asked NEB to
waive the condition, warning that to not do
so might delay completion of the project.97

Legal challenges
The Trans Mountain Expansion project is
opposed by the newly-elected provincial
government in British Columbia,98 the
municipal governments of Vancouver and
Burnaby, and the more than 150 First Nations
and Tribes across both Canada and the US that
have signed the Treaty Alliance Against Tar
Sands Expansion, and over 400 landowners
along the proposed route that have registered
statements of opposition.99

There are currently 17 separate legal
proceedings against Kinder Morgan’s Trans
Mountain Expansion project.100 These cases
include 10 individual First Nations challenges
as well as cases from NGOs and the cities
of Vancouver and Burnaby. In addition, two
Indian Tribes based in Washington State have
launched a legal challenge against the US Coast
Guard related to the impact of tanker traffic on
endangered southern resident orcas.101

The federal government could challenge a
refusal of a provincial government to grant
permits in court, but this would likely take
years to resolve.92 In the interim, Kinder
Morgan can proceed with preparatory work
that does not require provincial permits
and takes place on private lands but cannot
undertake significant construction activity
outside of its Westridge terminal.

According to the West Coast Environmental
Law Association, legal challenges similar
to those filed against the Trans Mountain
Expansion project resulted in the cancellation
of Federal approval of the Enbridge Northern
Gateway project in 2016.102

The Federal Court of Appeal ordered the 16
judicial review proceedings against the NEB

9

and Cabinet decisions to be consolidated;
one was withdrawn before hearing and the
remaining 15 were heard simultaneously in
October 2017 and judgements are awaited.
It is important to note that each First Nation’s
legal challenge is based on unique facts
relating to their specific territory, rights and
title; this raises an independent duty to consult
and accommodate. Success on any one of the
First Nation’s legal challenges could delay or
stop the project.

The legal challenges submitted by First
Nations highlight issues of constitutional,
administrative, procedural, and statutory law.
They allege, among other issues, that a) the
government failed to address concerns raised
repeatedly by First Nations, constituting a
breach of the constitutional duty to consult and
accommodate; b) the NEB report was flawed
due to breaches of the principles of procedural
fairness; c) the government unjustifiably
infringed claimed Aboriginal rights and title; d)
the government breached its fiduciary duty to
the affected First Nations; and e) that the NEB
and Cabinet failed to comply with the statutory
requirements of the Canadian Environmental
Assessment Act 2012.103

The cases taken by NGOs – Raincoast and
Living Oceans – argue, among other things,

that the NEB and Federal Cabinet failed to
uphold the Species at Risk Act with respect to
endangered southern resident orca whales.

The Cities of Vancouver and Burnaby argue in
their cases, among other things, that the NEB
process was deficient and could not be relied
upon by Cabinet or the BC government. Finally,
the PIPE Up and Democracy Watch case argues
that the BC decision was tainted by $750,000
in political donations by Kinder Morgan and
its customers to the BC Liberal Party, whose
government issued the approval.104

KEYSTONE XL
Permitting process
TransCanada, after being denied the
necessary cross-border federal permit by
President Obama in 2015,105 received the
relevant permit from the US Department of
State in March 2017106 following a presidential
executive order signed in January. This change
came about after a presidential executive
order signed in January invited TransCanada to
reapply for the permit, which it did.

TransCanada still requires a Nebraska state
permit from the Nebraska Public Service
Commission (PSC). This permit would not
only approve the route through the state, but

would also give TransCanada the power to
exercise eminent domain where landowners
are unwilling to grant the company the
easements they need for the pipeline’s right
of way.

The PSC hosted four days of intervenor
hearings (where persons granted formal
intervenor status give testimony in a trial-like
hearing with the presentation of evidence
and cross-examination) in early August, in
addition to multiple day-long public hearings
along the proposed pipeline route, and a
public commentary period. People opposing
the construction of the pipeline submitted
over 450,000 comments during the public
commentary period.107 The Ponca Tribe of
Nebraska and the Yankton Sioux Tribe of
South Dakota were both granted intervenor
status in the Nebraska hearings,108 along with
93 separate landowners.109 The testimony
before the PSC in some cases was limited
to cover only certain topics such as those
related to impacts on property values and
on cultural resources and social issues, rather
than all issues impacting the Tribes and
other intervenors. This led the Yankton Sioux
Tribe to issue a statement declaring it was
“outraged and flabbergasted at the restrictions
placed on its sovereign rights…”110 Risks from

10

potential pipeline spills were not considered
by the PSC. The PSC will now review the
evidence, intervenor testimony and public
comments, and is required to make a decision
on or before 23 November 2017.

The decision, regardless of outcome, will likely
be appealed. If approved, the permit will likely
be appealed by landowners, environmental,
and/or social advocacy groups opposing the
pipeline construction through Nebraska. If
denied or approved with a different route,
TransCanada could appeal. It is expected that
the appeals process could take multiple years.

If the company receives the necessary
approval and decides to proceed, it will likely
be required to file eminent domain petitions in
Nebraska, a lengthy and contentious process
for the company which resulted in multiple
lawsuits during the first proposed Keystone XL
project from 2012 to 2015.111

TransCanada will make a final investment
decision on Keystone XL sometime later in
the year.112

Legal challenges
Following the federal cross-border permit
approval by the State Department, the Natural
Resources Defense Council and the Sierra
Club and other allied groups filed a lawsuit
in the United States District Court for the
District of Montana. The lawsuit claims that
the State Department failed to update a
2014 environmental impact review and used
outdated and incomplete information that did
not adequately analyse the impacts of the
proposed pipeline. The permit approval, the
lawsuit argues, is therefore in violation of the
National Environmental Policy Act and the
Administrative Procedure Act.113 In June, the
State Department filed a motion to dismiss
the case, followed shortly by a similar motion
filed by TransCanada.114 A hearing in relation
to the motions to dismiss took place on 11
October, in Great Falls, Montana. It is expected
that a decision could be issued within a month
of the hearing.

Dakota Rural Action, the Intertribal Council on
Utility Policy, and the Yankton Sioux Tribe filed
an appeal with the South Dakota Supreme
Court in July challenging the state Public Utility
Commission permit for Keystone XL.115 The
South Dakota permit for the proposed pipeline
was previously upheld by the South Dakota
Sixth Circuit Judge in June.116

LINE 3 EXPANSION
Permitting process
Enbridge has applied to the Minnesota Public
Utilities Commission (PUC) for a Certificate
of Need and a pipeline Routing Permit for
their proposed Line 3 expansion.117 These two
permit requirements are a necessary step
before Enbridge can commence construction
in Minnesota.118 Construction of the pipeline
has already begun in Canada and Wisconsin.

The PUC will consider both public testimony
and testimony from people and groups
granted formal intervenor status to determine
if the replacement is needed and, if so,
whether to approve Enbridge’s preferred route
or an alternative route, which could cause
significant delays. Public hearings took place
across the state in September and October
while a period for public comment closes in
November. Moreover, there will also be several
days of formal evidentiary hearings held by the
administrative law judge in November where
the formal intervenors present their case in
a trial-like process. The administrative law
judge will make a final recommendation to the
PUC in February 2018. The PUC is expected
to make their final decision on whether to
approve or deny the Certificate of Need and
Routing permits in April 2018.119 While the
PUC is independent, all five commissioners
are appointed by Democratic Governor Mark
Dayton. The state of Minnesota requires
that no more than three commissioners may
belong to the same political party.120

Youth Climate Intervenors filed a formal
petition to legally intervene in the evidentiary
hearings.121 Enbridge filed a complaint against
the involvement of most of the intervenors,
including the Youth Climate Intervenors, but
the Minnesota judge ultimately granted full
status to the Youth Climate Intervenors.122
In addition to the Youth Climate Intervenors,
other intervenors include the White Earth
Band of Ojibwe, the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe,
the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior
Chippewa, Leech Lake Bank of Ojibwe, the
Red Lake Band of Ojibwe, Honor the Earth, the
Sierra Club, and Friends of the Headwaters.123

In September, the Minnesota Department
of Commerce released their testimony and
a statement against the Line 3 Certificate of
Need to the PUC stating: “Oil market analysis
indicates that Enbridge has not established a
need for the proposed project; the pipeline
would primarily benefit areas outside
Minnesota; and serious environmental and
socioeconomic risks and effects outweigh

11

limited benefits.”124 They added: “In light of the
serious risks and effects on the natural and
socioeconomic environments of the existing
Line 3 and the limited benefit that the existing
Line 3 provides to Minnesota refineries, it is
reasonable to conclude that Minnesota would
be better off if Enbridge proposed to cease
operations of the existing Line 3, without any
new pipeline being built.”125

In a separate process, the PUC is also
questioning and taking public comments
on the adequacy of the Final Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) for the Certificate
of Need and Routing permits. The comment
deadline concluded 2 October.126 An EIS is
required for this pipeline project following
a successful high-profile legal challenge by
Friends of the Headwaters.127 Following the
public hearings the Final EIS will be considered
by the administrative law judge and will inform
their report and recommendations to the
PUC.128 Problems with the adequacy of the
EIS could influence the recommendations of
the administrative law judge, and potentially
subject any approval to legal challenges.

Legal Challenges
No litigation has yet been initiated in the US.
However, in Canada, where construction
has already commenced, the Assembly of
Manitoba Chiefs in January 2017 filed a legal
challenge to the Line 3 approval, stating that
the Canadian government failed to adequately
consult Indigenous leaders as Canada’s pipeline
regulator, the National Energy Board, did not
consult the Great Binding Law before issuing
a decision on the permit.129 The matter is
currently before the Federal Court of Appeal.

1.2 FUNDING THE PIPELINES
In June 2017, a syndicate of banks signed a
credit agreement with Kinder Morgan which
included a CDN $4bn pipeline construction
loan. In addition Kinder Morgan raised $1.7bn
via an IPO of shares in its pipeline subsidiary.130
TransCanada (Keystone XL pipelines) and
Enbridge Inc. (Line 3 expansion) have yet to
finalise funding arrangements. The renewal
and use of existing credit facilities, the issue
of bonds and the placement of shares are
potential funding mechanisms.

Figure 3 outlines the current status of each of
the three major proposed tar sands pipeline
projects – Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain
Expansion project, TransCanada’s Keystone XL
and Enbridge’s Line 3 expansion.

opposition driven by concerns
related to tanker traffic. The
Trudeau government approved
the pipeline in December 2016,
but in August 2017 the newly-
elected provincial government
in British Columbia said it would
be illegal for Trans Mountain to
proceed with construction on
public land at this time, it having
not yet met existing conditions on
its BC environmental assessment
certificate related to Indigenous
consultation. Multiple First
Nations legal challenges could
block the project even if formally
approved.

Enbridge:
Line 3 Expansion

Initially increase capacity from
390,000 to 760,000 barrels
per day, but in its filing with
the Minnesota Public Utility
Commission, Enbridge indicated
that total capacity would
ultimately be 915,000 barrels
per day
Total Enbridge expansions
(including Line 3), if completed,
would equal some 1.1 million
barrels per day of tar sands
capacity.

The 18-mile cross-border section
is complete but currently in use
for the Clipper expansion; the
rest of the line’s permits are
being reviewed by the Minnesota
Public Utilities Commission and
the US federal government.
Opposition centres around the
sensitivity of the new route, plans
for abandonment of the old Line
3, and the lack of application of
climate criteria as per Keystone
XL. The National Energy Board
approved the replacement/
expansion on the Canadian
side in April 2016. The project
continues to face opposition from
First Nations communities and
environmentalists.

Trump administration’s approval
of the permit faces litigation by a
coalition of environmental groups.
Filed in federal district court in
MT, the first hearing has been

from the Nebraska Public Service
Commission, which held hearings
on the matter in August 2017.

in November 2017. If approved,
TC has said it will assess the
financial viability of the pipeline in
November and construction could
start six to nine months after that.

2. INDIGENOUS AND
COMMUNITY OPPOSITION

The proposed tar sands pipeline projects
face opposition from First Nations and Tribes,
local communities and landowners, and
environmental groups. This opposition already
includes legal action in the case of the Trans
Mountain Expansion project, Keystone XL, and
the Line 3 expansion (see Section 1).

The proposed tar sands pipeline projects do
not have the Free, Prior, and Informed Consent
of all Indigenous Nations and Tribes along or
impacted by the proposed pipeline routes as
called for in the United Nations Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Over 150
First Nations and Tribes across Canada and
the US have signed the Treaty Alliance Against
Tar Sands Expansion.138 The Treaty is an
expression of Indigenous Law and opposes the
use of the signatories’ Indigenous territories
and coasts for new or expanded pipeline

infrastructure projects that would facilitate
the expansion of the tar sands.

KINDER MORGAN
130 First Nations and their allies have signed
the Save the Fraser Declaration139 outlining
their opposition to the (now abandoned)
Northern Gateway pipeline and to other
similar tar sands projects crossing their lands,
territories and waterways – which would
include Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain
Expansion project,140 also currently the subject
of 10 legal challenges from First Nations in
Canada alleging infringements of their rights.141

On 5 September 2017, members of the
Secwepemc Nation constructed the first
of 10 tiny houses along the proposed
pipeline route.142

KEYSTONE XL
A recent Nebraska poll released by the Sierra
Club and conducted by Public Policy Polling
found that 58% of Nebraska voters believe
clean energy like wind and solar will benefit
the state more than investing in fossil fuel
projects like the proposed Keystone XL
pipeline.143 This comes at a critical time when
the Nebraska Public Service Commission
(PSC) must determine whether or not to
approve the necessary state permit for
Keystone XL. The PSC is comprised of five
elected commissioners.

Approximately 100 landowners in Nebraska
continue to resist Keystone XL and refuse to
agree to the company’s right-of-way for the
proposed route.144 They have consistently
voiced their opposition to the company
building the pipeline through their property.145

Indigenous women and allies involved in the tiny house build on Secwepemc territory, BC.

Several landowners have built large solar
installations on their property in the direct
path of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.146

The Keystone XL pipeline also faces vocal
opposition from First Nations and Tribes
across the proposed pipeline route and
beyond. Tribes and Nations signed onto the
Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion
include four from Nebraska (the Omaha
Tribe, Ponca Tribe, Santee Sioux Nation and
Winnebago Tribe). They were joined by seven
from North and South Dakota (the Cheyenne
River Sioux Tribe, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe,
Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, Oglala Sioux Tribe,
Rosebud Sioux Tribe, Standing Rock Sioux
Tribe, and Yankton Sioux Tribe).148 Keystone
XL would cut through the land of the Rosebud
Sioux of South Dakota, whose president Cyril
Scott said in 2014: “Authorizing Keystone XL is
an act of war against our people.”149

LINE 3 EXPANSION
Enbridge’s Line 3 continues to face opposition
from Tribes, First Nations, local residents
and various grassroots and environmental
organizations. Its proposed route crosses
territories referenced in the 1855 treaty
between the Anishinaabe (including the
Ojibwe) and the US government. A 1999
Supreme Court decision upheld the rights of
the Anishinaabe to hunt, fish and gather in
those areas.150  The Native-led organisation
Honor the Earth and the Sierra Club have
detailed the treaty violations they believe arise
from the proposed pipeline and its numerous
potential impacts on the treaty-protected
resources and rights of Indigenous people and
Tribes in the region.

According to Honor the Earth: “The proposed
Line 3 corridor would violate the treaty rights
of the Anishinaabeg by endangering primary

areas of hunting, fishing, wild rice, and cultural
resources in the 1855 treaty territory.[...]
Line 3 threatens the culture, way of life, and
physical survival of the Ojibwe people.”151

According to the Sierra Club: “[…] the
Anishinaabe have a legitimate stake in Line 3
decisions as it affects their traditional rights
to live off the land. Treaty rights are the law
of the land. Anishinaabe voices need to have a
primary say in pipeline decisions.”152

Active on-the-ground resistance to Line 3 has
already been established, including multiple,
permanent, Indigenous-led spirit camps and
resistance camps153 as well as direct action
protest in Wisconsin, where construction of
the pipeline has already begun.154

“Standing Rock was a dress rehearsal compared to what this will be. We are not
going to let an inch of foreign steel touch Nebraska soil.” Jane Kleeb147

3. CLIMATE RISK: PIPELINES
ARE KEY TO THE EXPANSION
OF THE TAR SANDS

Pipelines are the keys that open up untapped
reserves by giving producers an affordable,
reliable means to get oil to market. While there
is ample pipeline capacity for oil from existing
and some of the under-construction tar sands
projects, there is no room for new expansion.
Conversely, it is estimated that the Keystone
XL pipeline and the Trans Mountain Expansion
project could add 830,000155 and 590,000156
barrels per day capacity respectively.
Enbridge’s Line 3 would initially increase
capacity from 390,000 to 760,000 barrels
per day, but in its filing with the Minnesota
Public Utility Commission157, Enbridge
indicated that total capacity would ultimately
be 915,000 barrels per day, resulting in a
525,000 barrels per day increase. Facilitating
the expansion of the tar sands is incompatible
with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement
and with an orderly transition to a low-carbon
economy.158

Noting the role of pipelines in unlocking new
expansions in tar sands production, we can
estimate the cumulative emissions impact
of each pipeline159 (See Figure 4).

Figure 5 shows how new pipelines would be
needed to enable the industry’s expansion
plans. Building pipelines therefore is a vital
enabling factor in facilitating new tar sands
projects (unless oil prices exceed $90/bbl).

When pipeline capacity becomes tight,
sending tar sands crude by rail is an option.
But it is not an option that producers can
depend on enough to justify multi-billion dollar
investments in new tar sands production.
While the transport of tar sands by rail has
grown in recent years, its potential is severely
hampered by high costs, increasing pressure
for regulation and unreliable logistics.160

While the physical infrastructure of rail
terminals for loading and unloading is quicker
and cheaper to build than pipelines, the
per-barrel transport cost is nearly double
that of pipelines.

Even those in the business of transporting
tar sands crude by rail admit that rail cannot
substitute entirely for pipelines, but instead
acts as a stop-gap solution for insufficient
pipeline capacity. “Crude by rail is not a
panacea,” says Stewart Hanlon, President and
CEO of Gibson Energy Inc, a tar sands rail
terminal operator. “It’s not going to replace
pipe.”161 Part of the reason is that rail is less
reliable than pipe. Trains are often stopped
or delayed when the weather is bad, for
example. Crude oil also has to compete with
many other commodities for capacity on the
rail system – a challenge it does not face with
a dedicated pipeline. New safety regulations

aimed at addressing the explosive result of
crude oil train derailments are also posing
new challenges to the trade. The logistical and
market challenges of crude by rail are only
likely to lead to volatility and rising costs.

The question is whether producers will invest
in new production if rail is the only available
transportation option, that is, if pipeline
capacity is full and no new pipelines are being
built. While there may be a few exceptions,
where project costs are very low or where
an integrated company can play upstream
margins against refining, generally the
additional cost of rail eats too far into already
tight netbacks.

Lack of pipeline capacity, and the resulting
prospect of having to rely on rail, was a
key factor behind many of the delayed and
cancelled tar sands projects. An analysis of
27 of the tar sands projects cancelled since
2010, found that 14 – including BP’s Sunrise
and Shell’s Carmon Creek – were rendered
uneconomic by the combination of 2015 oil
price expectations and the additional cost of
rail. It was lack of pipeline access that pushed
them over the edge, as the additional cost
of rail rendered these projects uneconomic.
These 14 projects are associated with over
60% of the reserves held in all 27 projects.162

Assuming other market conditions are right
and in the absence of oil prices consistently
over $90, building new pipeline infrastructure
is the only way that future tar sands expansion
projects would achieve rates of return high
enough to get a green light from investors.163

4. ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF
THE TAR SANDS PIPELINES

As stated in Section 3, existing pipeline
capacity is sufficient to meet the needs of
the current conventional oil and tar sands
oil extraction in Canada.164 Accordingly,
the success of the proposed new pipelines
which rely on producers committing to
decade-long contracts for pipeline capacity
will depend on the continued confidence of
producers in the expansion of the tar sands.
Growth in the tar sands is in turn dependent
on market conditions (in addition to market
access infrastructure and a lack of climate
policy) including the global demand for oil in
the context of alternative supplies at lower
prices. At current oil prices of around $50,
new tar sands production will not expand
regardless of whether pipelines are built.
However, at oil prices in the range of $65-
70/bbl new pipelines can be a determinative
factor in unlocking new tar sands
production.165 A number of factors impacting
those market conditions means that growth
in the tar sands is far from guaranteed.

4.1 THE PIPELINE BUSINESS
MODEL UNDER THREAT
Building a pipeline to transport tar sands-
derived product – either syncrude or diluted
bitumen (dilbit) – from the tar sands projects

of Alberta to the tidewater coasts of British
Columbia, the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic
coast of Canada faces a variety of challenges.
Once built, however the business model for
a pipeline is fairly straightforward. Shippers,
usually producers, refiners or traders, sign
long-term contracts – known as “take-or-
pay” or firm transportation agreements – to
reserve pipeline capacity ahead of project
construction. The contracts are typically for
a period of 10-20 years. A pipeline project
will go ahead when enough capacity is
reserved to guarantee sufficient revenue to
project a return on capital invested. The costs
to the pipeline company are front loaded in
the construction phase of the project, with
the revenue spread over the lifetime of
the pipeline.

 The success of this model is dependent
on the shippers fulfilling those contracts.
Given that evolving market conditions raise
questions about the continued expansion of
tar sands production, the risk to the pipeline
companies is an oversupply of pipeline
capacity. Oversupply of pipeline capacity
could return the negotiating leverage to the
shippers, with the possible outcome being
the renegotiation of the favourable “take or

pay” contracts in favour of the shippers, with
reduced prices reducing the revenue of the
pipeline companies.

As Figure 5 shows, additional volumes from
tar sands projects already under construction
might exceed available existing pipeline
capacity only by about 250 kpd – well
below what is required to profitably fill a
new pipeline.

There is convincing analysis that the
medium to long-term prospects for growth
in the Canadian tar sands and other sources
of crude oil in Canada will not require
additional pipeline capacity, suggesting that
the optimism of the pipeline companies in
growth is misplaced. Market fundamentals
such as evolving supply and demand
dynamics and the resulting medium to long-
term prospects for oil prices have already
restricted the growth in tar sands and are
likely to continue to do so. Potential financiers
of the proposed pipelines and of pipeline
companies more generally should query
their resilience if the companies’ respective
pipelines prove uneconomic.

18

4.2 STALLED AMBITIONS
FOR THE TAR SANDS
A LOW PRICE ENVIRONMENT LEADING
TO A FLATTENING OF SUPPLY
Since late 2014 oil prices have fallen
dramatically. Currently they remain well below
the breakeven price required for new tar sands
projects to go forward (see Figure 6 below).
As a result, the Canadian oil industry has not
sanctioned construction of any major new
projects that would significantly increase the
overall supply of crude oil available for export
from Canada, since 2014.166 The high prices of
2013 led to a level of optimism in the industry
which quickly eroded. Only one small project
was approved in 2015 and two in 2016 (see
Figure 7 below). Medium term price outlook

does not provide confidence that new projects
will get a green light.

Many industry analysts167,168 believe this a
structural market shift driven in part by the
flexibility of US shale oil production and slowing
global demand growth, with Shell CEO Ben van
Beurden suggesting that the industry is now
operating in a “lower forever” oil price era.169

According to the United States Energy
Information Agency (USEIA) spot price data,
West Texas Intermediate (WTI – the price
at which tar sands production trades) has
averaged $51 since the beginning of the
2017.171 At this price, tar sands projects
under development now are likely to begin

production making a loss, and even some
currently-producing projects are operating at
little or no profit.172 While it is impossible to
accurately predict the future of oil prices, in
September 2017, WTI Futures for December
2025 were trading within a range of $40 to
$65, which does not signpost a rapid return to
anything like pre-2014 price levels.173

FLATTENING DEMAND
Flattening in demand (both globally and
from key markets) would limit production
growth in the tar sands; in turn this would
necessarily limit demand for crude oil
transportation services.

Graph devised by GP Canada from IEA World Energy Outlook 2015, New Policies Scenario and 2050 World and China Energy Outlook

In September, China’s vice minister of industry
and information technology announced that
China would set a deadline for automakers to
end sales of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles.175
This announcement raises questions for
Kinder Morgan which has pitched its Trans
Mountain Expansion project as a way to reach
the rapidly growing Chinese market. Kinder
Morgan has publicly stated that without a
growing demand for oil in key markets, its
pipeline could suffer from a reduced supply of
crude oil and other products.176

That admission came in response to
Greenpeace Canada’s challenge to Kinder
Morgan Canada’s draft IPO prospectus177
on the grounds that it contained inadequate
disclosure of climate change-related risks
and over-estimated the growth in global oil
demand, and Chinese demand in particular.

To make the case for rising demand in India
and China, the prospectus cited the Canadian
Association of Petroleum Producers’ (CAPP)
2016 Crude Oil Forecast, Markets and
Transportation,178 which in turn cites the
International Energy Agency’s (IEA) New
Policies Scenario, showing a significant growth
in demand for oil in China in the coming
two decades.

The figures provided in the CAPP report,
however, differ markedly from those issued
by the China National Petroleum Corporation
Economics & Technology Research Institute
(CNPC), the in-house research arm of the
state-owned oil company responsible for

informing long-term strategy development.
The CNPC’s 2016 report 2050 World and
China Energy Outlook179 is the most up-to-
date domestic source for projections of oil
demand produced in China.

graph above), but could also tilt the global
marketplace in favour of electric vehicles,
particularly in the context of India looking
to move to all-electric sales of new cars
by 2030.181

The CNPC’s ‘current policies’ scenario has a
much lower forecast for increased oil demand
than in the CAPP / IEA forecast (see Figure
8).180 The current policies scenario assumed
that ownership of electric vehicles would
account for a modest 1.3% of total vehicle
ownership in China in 2030, rising to 4.5% in
2040 and 11% in 2050.

The announcement of the intention to end
sales of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles suggests
that the Chinese government policy could
drive significantly higher rates of electric
vehicle adoption. This would not only lower
future Chinese oil demand (more in line
with the CNPC 2 degree scenario in the

“These factors could not only result in
increased costs for producers of hydrocarbons
but also an overall decrease in the global
demand for hydrocarbons. Each of the
foregoing could negatively impact the
Business directly as well as the customers
of the Business that are shipping through its
pipelines or using its terminals, which in turn
could negatively impact the prospects of new
contracts for transportation or terminalling,
renewals of existing contracts or the ability
of the Business’ customers and shippers to
honour their contractual commitments”.

4.3 KEYSTONE XL AND
LINE 3 VULNERABLE
The flattening of demand in key growth
markets along with the corresponding
tightening of supply from the tar sands could
impact the viability of at least two of the
proposed pipelines: TransCanada’s Keystone
XL and the Enbridge Line 3 expansion.

Expert evidence189 submitted to the State
of Minnesota Public Utilities Commission
regarding the Line 3 expansion argues that
there is no need to construct the project since
crude oil supply from western Canada is likely
to decline in volume in the future. The new
capacity provided by the Line 3 expansion
would only be needed if: (a) additional new
Canadian crude oil supply is economically
viable and available for export from Canada
for a substantial period of time into the
future; and (b) other more cost-effective
transportation options do not exist.

Expert evidence submitted to the Nebraska
Public Service Commission190 consultation on
Keystone XL highlights the conditions limiting
growth in the tar sands and thus limiting
the potential supply to the pipeline and the
potential economic impacts. In addition, there
are conditions specific to the Keystone pipeline
and the already over-supplied refining market
in the Gulf of Mexico area191 which, it is argued,
would impact the success of Keystone XL.

It appears TransCanada may not yet have
secured sufficient numbers of committed

SUNCOR SCENARIOS

In April 2017, Suncor reported203 on how
the company assesses climate risk and its
plans to build long-term resilience in a low-
carbon economy. Published in response to
a shareholder resolution passed at Suncor’s
2016 Annual General Meeting, the document
assessed how the company’s business
model would change in response to three
possible futures.

The lowest-carbon future was called the
Autonomy scenario. In this possible future, the

shippers: the open season, which allows
companies interested in shipping or receiving
oil on Keystone XL to bid to reserve space,
was extended from 28 September to 26
October. TransCanada had previously said
that final results likely wouldn’t be known
until November, a timeline which is also likely
to be extended with the new open season
schedule.192 The final investment decision on
the project will likely be made in November
or December.193

4.4 POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
The project economics of both Keystone XL
and Line 3 – which cross the border between
Canada and the United States – could
face uncertainty from questions regarding
international trade and the harmonisation
of government policy.

Although stated US priorities include
“North American energy security and
independence,”194 President Trump’s plan to
renegotiate the North American Free Trade
Agreement brings with it uncertainty, both
due to the different positions brought to
the table by the Canadian, Mexican and US
governments, and the possibility of resulting
significant shifts in trade policies.

President Trump and Congressional
Republicans have at times supported a “border
tax adjustment” (BTA) as a plank of their tax
reform goals. A BTA could have far reaching
effects on the the oil and gas sector; while the
winners and losers from the implementation

of such a policy remain unclear,195 oil industry
leaders have spoken out against such a
policy.196 Although the BTA has recently been
dropped from US tax reform plans, it could
return in various forms.197

4.5 INTERNATIONAL OIL
COMPANY EXODUS FROM
THE TAR SANDS
Disappointing prospects for tar sands projects
have also contributed to the decisions of
Conoco-Phillips, Shell, Marathon Oil, Murphy
and Statoil all to sell their tar sands assets,
with BP198 and Chevron199 contemplating
shedding their tar sands assets. Even pure
play tar sands companies like Suncor are
suggesting that they won’t be investing to
add to reserves.200

Suncor’s CEO Steve Williams has been explicit.
“Mining investments are coming to an end, not
just for Suncor but for the industry, I believe,
for a considerable period, probably in excess
of 10 years”, he has written, adding: “I want to
be equally clear: we have no plans to be going
ahead with major capital investment in either
mining or in situ in the foreseeable future” and
“We have nothing of any materiality in the
pipeline around mergers and acquisitions.”201
Suncor subsequently stated that they may
not even extract all of their existing assets,
preferring to voluntarily strand uneconomic,
high carbon projects.202

demand for oil drops and oil prices stay low
as renewable power generation fuels a largely
electrified energy system and breakthrough
battery technology supports the rapid
deployment of electric vehicles.

“high cost supply falls off fast.” As a result,
“new oil sand growth projects are challenged
and unlikely to proceed” and “no new export
pipelines are built out of the Athabasca Oil
Sands region.”

Suncor argues that because of their sunk
costs, existing tar sands assets would continue
to be operated in all three scenarios. But
in the low-carbon “Autonomy” scenario,
“oil exploration and production slows as
investment moves to other sectors” and

In a scenario that meets the Paris climate
agreement targets, Suncor’s strategy is to
maintain only the richest parts of their existing
tar sands operations and end expansion.

5. LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

5.1 SPILL RISK
The proposed tar sands pipeline projects
carry a risk of negative environmental impacts
including contamination of drinking water
from leaks. When oil spills happen, only a small
percentage of the oil released into water can
be cleaned up.204 This leaves a lasting legacy
of water, soil and sediment pollution that
means people and ecosystems are potentially
exposed to toxic hydrocarbon chemicals
for decades. Acute or chronic exposure to
hydrocarbon pollution can significantly impact
ecosystems and human health.205

Healthy ecosystems are a necessary
precondition for a healthy local economy.
A study undertaken by University of British
Columbia fisheries experts found that

estimated losses from four ocean-based
industries (commercial fishing, port activities,
ferry transportation and marine tourism) in
the event of a high-impact tanker spill could
be $9.6 billion CAD. Those costs do not
include the costs for spill response, clean-up
or litigation, or the economic value of social,
cultural and environmental damages.206

Analysis of public data from the Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
(PHMSA)208 for the period from 2010 to date
shows that the three companies proposing to
build four tar sands pipelines – TransCanada,
Kinder Morgan, Enbridge, and their subsidiaries
– have seen 373 hazardous liquid spills from
their US pipeline networks.

Indigenous peoples “have a cultural, traditional
and social connection to the land and many
communities continue to rely on traditional
food for their socio-cultural, economic,
and physical well-being.”207 Contaminating
water sources and ecosystems with
petroleum products could prevent Indigenous
communities from accessing important
sources of food, medicine and cultural values.

These spills released a total of 63,221 barrels
of hazardous liquids during that time period
– including Enbridge’s 20,082 barrel diluted
bitumen spill into the Kalamazoo River in 2010.
The US crude oil pipeline system as a whole
has averaged one significant incident and a
total of ~570 barrels released per year per
1,000 miles of pipe, over the past 10 years.

A HISTORY OF SPILLS

Across their US pipeline networks since 2010211:
f  TransCanada and its subsidiaries had 13 spills totalling 829 barrels of crude oil

(mostly from two significant 400 barrel spills in 2011212 and 2016).

f  Kinder Morgan and its subsidiaries and joint ventures had 213 spills totalling

21,598 barrels of hazardous liquids. In total, Kinder Morgan saw 22 significant
spills during this time.

f  Enbridge and its subsidiaries and joint ventures had 147 spills totalling 40,794

barrels of hazardous liquids. Around half of Enbridge’s total comes from a catastrophic
20,082 barrel diluted bitumen spill into Michigan’s Kalamazoo River in 2010.213
In total, Enbridge saw 17 significant spills during this time period, all crude oil spills.

In Canada
f  Since 1961, the existing Trans Mountain pipeline has reported 82 spills to Canada’s National
Energy Board, including spills of greater than 500 barrels in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2012.214

Assuming these rates, the Keystone XL
pipeline could see 59 significant spills over
a 50-year lifetime. TransCanada reported
a much a lower estimate of 11 significant
spills209 but an independent scientific
assessment concluded that they relied upon
overly-optimistic assumptions.210 Similarly,
the Line 3 expansion could see 51 significant
spills over a 50-year lifetime.

An incident is considered “significant” by
PHMSA if it involved a fatality, a hospitalized
injury, $50,000 or more in costs, more than
50 barrels (or >5 barrels of highly volatile
liquids, or HVL) spilled, or resulted in an
unintentional fire or explosion.

5.2 CLEAN-UP COMPLICATIONS
Cleaning up oil spills in water is an inherently
difficult task. In typical situations only a
fraction of the spilled oil can be recovered by
deploying booms and skimmers, or by other
methods. Diluted bitumen (dilbit) spills pose
an especially difficult clean-up challenge due
to the properties of the oil. Laboratory tests
and real-world pipeline spills have shown that
the ultra-heavy bitumen separates from its
lighter diluents and can sink to the bottom
of waterways.215

A 2015 study conducted by the National
Academies of Science216 identified unique
problems associated with a dilbit spill. The
dilbit mixture separates quickly after a spill,
with the lighter volatile diluents evaporating
and leaving behind the denser bitumen, which
will sink in water. This complicates most oil
spill response techniques designed to handle
oil floating on the surface.217 The study
concluded that special response strategies and
tactics are needed to respond and clean-up
diluted bitumen spills; however these have

yet not been developed in Canada or the US.
It’s open to question whether the pipeline
industry, government agencies and first
responders are prepared to deal with these
additional risks.

A number of reports have criticized existing
federal standards for pipeline safety and
oil spill response, both for their general
inadequacy218 and the need for special
precautions related to dilbit.219 The US National
Academies report on dilbit highlighted the
inadequacies of existing regulations, stating
“Broadly, regulations and agency practices
do not take the unique properties of diluted
bitumen into account, nor do they encourage
effective planning for spills of diluted bitumen”
and calling on PHMSA and EPA to implement
improvements.220

In July 2010, Enbridge’s Line 6B pipeline
ruptured, spilling 20,000 barrels of dilbit
into the Kalamazoo River near the town of
Marshall, Michigan.221 The spill impacted
hundreds of families, polluted 36 miles of river,
and only narrowly avoided contaminating Lake
Michigan. The spilled bitumen sunk to the
bottom of the river triggering a years-long,
billion dollar clean-up operation that required
dredging the river bottom. It is claimed that
it has left the river degraded years later.222 A
National Transportation Safety Board review223
of the incident offered a scathing critique of
Enbridge’s safety culture, and noted that the
company knew of problems with its pipeline
system but relied on weak regulations to
avoid taking effective action to fix them.224
Enbridge’s CEO failed to share accurate
information about the oil’s properties with
either first responders or the media in the
aftermath of the spill.225

23

5.3 DRINKING WATER
Safe, clean drinking water is fundamental
to public health. When an oil spill occurs,
communities may have to shut down existing
water supplies. In July 2016, for example, a
pipeline operated by Husky spilt 90,000 litres
(566 barrels) of heavy crude and diluent into
the North Saskatchewan River, jeopardizing
drinking water supplies for thousands of
people downstream. The spill forced the
communities of North Battleford, Prince Albert
and Melfort to shut their intakes from the river
and find other water sources for almost two
months.226 Many communities’ water supplies
are threatened by proposed pipelines.

TRANS MOUNTAIN EXPANSION PIPELINE
The proposed Kinder Morgan Trans
Mountain pipeline has a total of 246
potential watercourse crossings along the
proposed route in Alberta and 1109 potential
watercourse crossings in British Columbia,
of which 354 are fish-bearing.227 It crosses
aquifers which provide drinking water to the
communities of Abbotsford and Coldwater,228
and the city of Chilliwack.229

KEYSTONE XL
The proposed route of the Keystone XL
pipeline would cross 1,073 surface bodies of
water, including 56 perennial streams.230 One
expert noted the Platte Valley and the Platte
River crossing as a particular “weak link” for
Keystone XL due to a high water table and a
shallow pipe depth.231 The Final Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) also
identifies a number of tribal and municipal
water resources that are downstream from
Keystone XL water crossings.232

In addition to threats to surface water, much
discussion has focused on Keystone XL’s
potential impacts to groundwater, particularly
the Ogallala (or High Plains) aquifer, which is
found under much of Nebraska and extends
southward to Texas. The Northern High Plains
aquifer provides 78 percent of the water
supply and 83 percent of irrigation water in
Nebraska. Overall the aquifer holds 3.25 billion
acre-feet of water and supplies water to
170,000 wells.233

Experts have pointed out that claims that a
pipeline spill would contaminate the “entire”
aquifer are overblown, although concerns
about significant local impacts to the aquifer
and wells are reasonable. As one expert put
it: “Contaminating an entire aquifer over the
area of an entire county by a single pipeline
that is being maintained properly and the
hazards of which are being mitigated correctly
... is very unlikely. However, the possibility of

a contaminant plume affecting wells within
a comparatively short distance – hundreds
of meters – of an improperly maintained or
incorrectly mitigated pipeline is much higher.”234

The Stansbury assessment found that a
worst-case discharge of 189,000 barrels
could lead to an underground plume of
carcinogenic dilbit components such as
benzene, with the potential to contaminate
billions of gallons of water.235 Risks to the
local aquifer would vary depending on the
local geology and the height of the water
table in the region impacted by the spill.
TransCanada has already rerouted the pipeline
once to avoid the Sand Hills region in western
Nebraska, an ecologically sensitive area whose
characteristics (high water table and sand
dune formations) make it particularly risky
for spills.236

LINE 3 EXPANSION
The proposed Line 3 expansion would deviate
from the existing Line 3 route for one section
in Minnesota, and would use the existing route
for the rest of its length. The proposed route
would require 227 surface water crossings,
including 46 waters designated either for
state use or as sensitive surface waters, and
seven navigable river crossings.237

In Minnesota, the project would cross
25,765 acres of high vulnerability water table
aquifers, 26,382 acres of high groundwater
contamination susceptibility, 16,299 acres
of high pollution sensitivity, and 87 acres of
wellhead protection areas. 304 domestic wells
lie within the ROI of the project.238

Minnesota’s natural wild rice fields which
represent an “important social and cultural
component for American Indian tribes and
rural Minnesota communities” could be
threatened by a pipeline spill.239

5.4 WILDLIFE
Oil spills can negatively impact wildlife in a
number of ways:240
f  Oil destroys the insulating ability of

fur-bearing mammals, such as sea otters,
and the water repellency of a bird’s
feathers. Without the ability to repel
water and insulate themselves from the
cold water, birds and mammals will die
from hypothermia.

f  Many birds and animals also ingest oil when
they try to clean themselves, which can
poison them.

f  Fish and shellfish may not be exposed

immediately, but can come into contact
with oil if it is mixed into the water column.
When exposed to oil, adult fish may
experience reduced growth, enlarged
livers, changes in heart and respiration
rates, fin erosion, and impairment in their
capacity to reproduce. Oil also adversely
affects eggs and the survival of larvae.

JASPER NATIONAL PARK – WORLD HERITAGE SITE

The contiguous national parks of Banff,
Jasper, Kootenay and Yoho, and the Mount
Robson, Mount Assiniboine and Hamber
provincial parks, were together designated a
World Heritage Site under the title “Canadian
Rocky Mountain Parks” in 1984.241 Classic
illustrations of glacial geological processes —
including ice-fields, remnant valley glaciers,
canyons and exceptional examples of erosion
and deposition — are found throughout
the area.242 Extending over 11,000 square
kilometres, Jasper National Park is the largest
national park in the Canadian Rockies.243

The Trans Mountain pipeline has been in
operation since 1953. Its current capacity is
about 300,000 barrels per day. The proposed
expansion will create a twinned pipeline
increasing the nominal capacity of the system
from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000
barrels per day. The pipeline would carry
diluted bitumen from the tar sands through
Jasper National Park, into the Lower Mainland
of British Columbia, across the Vedder Fan
aquifer and the municipality of Chilliwack’s
protected groundwater zone, then across
the Fraser River and to the Westridge Marine
Terminal at Burrard Inlet for export.

Part of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline
passes through Jasper National Park. However,
in order to complete the expansion project,
Kinder Morgan needs to reactivate two
deactivated sections of the Trans Mountain
pipeline system. It is reported that the

expansion “will, when complete, triple the
amount of oil that moves through Alberta’s
Jasper National Park.”244

The Jasper reactivation is a 150-kilometre
segment from Hinton, Alberta to Hargreaves,
British Columbia, and the West Barriere
reactivation, a 42-kilometre section from
Darfield to Black Pines, BC.245 Approximately
80 km of reactivated pipeline will run through
the World Heritage Site. Kinder Morgan
has stated that reactivation activities will
be carried out over approximately two
years.246 These activities – some of which

will potentially be carried out in the World
Heritage Site – “typically involves: Mobilizing
excavation equipment, pipe, and infrastructure
(trailers) to support the work; Excavation to
expose existing line, cutting and welding to
the existing line; Non-Destructive examination
of the work; and Back filling.”247

The Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline
has spilled six times along its 158 kilometre
route through Jasper National Park since
1954.248 This includes the second-largest leak
in the Trans Mountain’s history.249

24

5.5 TANKER TRAFFIC
TRANS MOUNTAIN EXPANSION PROJECT
The expanded capacity of the Trans Mountain
pipeline could lead to as much as 590,000
additional barrels per day arriving at the
pipeline terminal in British Columbia. The
added oil would be loaded onto an additional
348 tanker ships per year, on top of existing
tanker traffic through the Salish Sea. The
tankers could head to refineries in Washington,
California, or across the Pacific to supply
markets in Asia.250

The propensity of dilbit to sink in water could
according to a study “trigger an ecological
catastrophe.”251 Despite this study, Kinder
Morgan’s proposal “assumed that dilbit spilled
from a tanker would all float and therefore
be completely recoverable.”252 253 It’s worth
noting that this claim – even if accurate –
appears to assume that the spilled bitumen is
recovered before it “’weathers’ on the surface
for too long”.254

If bitumen sinks to the ocean floor it is argued
that it would remain “unrecoverable for
decades, if not centuries, harming Dungeness
crab, rockfish, sand lance, and other bottom-
dwellers. It would also seriously threaten
migrating salmon and the totemic, endangered
Southern resident killer whales, which ultimately
depend on these members of the marine food
chain, especially Chinook salmon.”255

5.6 RISKS FROM PIPELINE
CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION
All pipelines have environmental effects.
Soils can be eroded, compacted and
mixed, contaminated, and removed, and
they can be acidified by local emissions
of chemicals causing acid rain. Possible
alterations of geology can cause landslides,
along with accompanying risks to safety
and environment, such as to fish habitat.
Vegetation (including old growth forests
and rare communities of plants) can be
affected by surface disturbance, changes
in water flows, the arrival of alien species
and air contamination.256

Risks to wildlife can be caused by the removal,
alteration and fragmentation of habitat, as
well as by noise, changing access and
sightlines for predators, and the creation of
barriers to movement.257

Water quality and quantity could be affected
by erosion and crossing excavations as well
as by herbicides applied to maintain a clearing
around the pipeline. Activities related to the
pipeline such as the clearing of vegetation,
and the grading and placement of structures
in water, have the potential to affect the
productive capacity of fish habitat, and fish
migration, health and mortality. Blasting,
grading and tunnel construction could
alter both surface and groundwater flow
and exposes rock formations, which could
potentially leach acid or metals.258

While there is a great deal of information on
how to mitigate the standard environmental
effects of a pipeline, such as those on fish
habitat associated with river crossings,
assessing the cumulative impacts of multiple
aspects of a pipeline project that may occur
in a single ecological unit (such as multiple
crossings throughout a river basin) is more
difficult. Accordingly, the necessary mitigation
efforts are less well understood.259

5.7 FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS
OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
As Enbridge’s 2010 Kalamazoo River disaster
has shown, a pipeline spill can bring with it
significant penalties, clean-up and settlement
costs. In 2016, the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) settled with Enbridge
for $177 million in connection with that
spill and another incident near Romeoville,
IL.260 The total represented $61 million in
Clean Water Act fines, $110 million in spill
prevention safeguards, and $5.4 million in
government costs. That fine comes on top of
at least $1.2 billion in clean-up costs disclosed
by Enbridge in a Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) filing.261 That total
included “$551.6 million spent on response
personnel and equipment, $227 million on
environmental consultants and $429.4 million
on professional, regulatory, and other costs,”
but did not include an estimated $219 million
in costs yet to be paid.262 Enbridge also spent
nearly $1 billion reviewing the safety of its

pipeline network and another $1.6 billion to
replace the entire Line 6B pipeline.263

The Clean Water Act authorizes fines of up
to $4,300 per barrel of oil spilled and gives
the EPA discretion to set higher penalties.
Although Enbridge’s settlement was the
largest Clean Water Act fine for an inland oil
spill (second only to BP’s Deepwater Horizon
disaster), it is far from the only pipeline to be
hit with multi-million dollar fines.264 Colonial
Pipeline Company paid $34 million for a
number of incidents in Georgia, Louisiana
and Tennessee, while BP paid $25 million for
two pipeline spills on Alaska’s North Slope.
ExxonMobil has been fined many times for
pipeline spills in Mayflower, Arkansas ($3.2
million), Valencia, California ($4.7 million)265
and the Yellowstone River ($12 million).266

Nor is the Kalamazoo River spill Enbridge’s only
regulatory violation. A database of US federal
enforcement actions contains 30 penalty
records totalling over $180 million in fines
since 2010. The majority of these (22) were
violations of environmental regulations, but
the total also includes workplace and other
safety violations. One notable example is a
$2.4 million fine from the US Department of
Transportation for a 2007 incident where two
Enbridge employees lost their lives responding
to a pipeline leak.267

The same database showed that Kinder
Morgan had 55 penalty records (of which
27 were environmental) totalling $4.3 million
in fines.268 Kinder Morgan was also fined
$5.3 million for Clean Water Act violations
because of three spills in 2004-5 along its
Pacific Operations unit in California, and
its subsidiary Plantation Pipeline was fined
$725,000 for four spills between 2000-6
in the US Southeast.269

In the same time period, TransCanada had
eight environmental violations totaling
$183,000 in fines.270

Assuming these rates, the Keystone XL pipeline could
see 59 significant spills over a 50-year lifetime.

6. ALIGNING FUNDING
DECISIONS WITH CLIMATE
ACTION AND BANK POLICIES

6.1 INCOMPATIBLE WITH
CLIMATE ACTION
Banks and their investors run the risk that their
short-term lending decisions – on projects
such as tar sands pipelines – will, through
the carbon lock-in they enable, undermine
their other medium to long-term actions on
climate. As detailed in Section 3, if no new
pipelines are built there will be no pipeline
space available for tar sands production
growth beyond that which arises from some
of the projects already under construction.

6.2 UNDERMINING BANK
POLICIES AND PUBLIC
STATEMENTS
Financial deals supporting tar sands pipelines
also appear to be at odds with some of the
banks’ own policies, statements and actions
on matters including climate change, human
rights and World Heritage sites.

CLIMATE CHANGE
It is difficult to reconcile Royal Bank of
Canada’s, TD’s and Barclays’ decision to fund
the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Expansion
project with their newly-announced work with
the United Nations to “develop analytical tools
and indicators to strengthen their assessment
and disclosure of climate-related risks and
opportunities.”271

Likewise Barclays’ lending decision on the
Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Expansion
project raises questions about the timing
and long-term effectiveness of its plan
“to develop a strategic approach that is
sustainable in the long-term” for its global
energy client portfolio.272

In its public statements, JPMorgan Chase has
acknowledged the responsibility of the financial
sector in safeguarding the global climate and
protecting human rights. While the bank’s
Environmental and Social Policy Framework

recognizes the global consensus supporting the
goal of the Paris Agreement to pursue efforts
to limit global warming to 1.5°C,273 it previously
acted as Lead Agent on two revolving
credit facilities provided to subsidiaries of
TransCanada, and on a revolving credit facility
provided to a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc. It also
participated as a lender in seven other relevant
credit facilities to TransCanada, Enbridge, and
Kinder Morgan. JPMorgan Chase was also
a member of the syndicate for the recent
construction loan for Kinder Morgan’s Trans
Mountain Expansion project.

HUMAN RIGHTS
JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Canada, TD,
Barclays, and Wells Fargo are all signatories
to the Equator Principles274 which state that
projects with adverse impacts on Indigenous
peoples require Free, Prior, and Informed
Consent (FPIC) in line with the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance
Standards on Environmental and Social
Sustainability. The Equator Principles allow
banks to forego this FPIC requirement in
countries like the US and Canada (which the
principles define as “Designated Countries”)

Banks and their investors run the risk that their short-term
lending decisions – on projects such as tar sands pipelines –
will, through the carbon lock-in they enable, undermine
their other medium to long-term actions on climate.

26

assuming that in such countries adequate
protections exist under law for rights of
Indigenous peoples.

As the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL)
controversy demonstrated in stark and
unacceptable terms, national regulatory
review processes in Designated Countries
do not provide a failsafe guarantee that a
project has obtained the FPIC of communities
impacted by a project. Bank risk departments
can no longer assume that compliance with
the Equator Principles will, in itself, mitigate
reputation risks for alleged complicity by
banks in potential human rights violations.
In line with both the spirit of the Equator
Principles and their role in determining and
mitigating risk, signatory banks should refuse
to fund projects lacking FPIC regardless of
the jurisdiction in which they occur. Ten
Equator Principles banks have recently called
for the IFC FPIC standard to be applied in
all countries.275

JPMORGAN CHASE’S HUMAN
RIGHTS POLICY
In light of the lack of FPIC from all potentially
impacted First Nations and Tribes as set out
in Section 2, providing finance to any of the
pipelines appears to contradict JPMorgan
Chase’s human rights policy which states:
“For transactions where we can identify

that the use of proceeds may have the
potential to impact Indigenous Peoples, we
expect our clients to demonstrate alignment
with the objectives and requirements
of IFC Performance Standard 7 on
Indigenous Peoples, including with respect
to circumstances requiring Free, Prior and
Informed Consent.”276 Although this wording
does not draw any distinction based on the
location of the proposed project, there is
a separate requirement that “Transactions
that fall under the scope of the Equator
Principles must demonstrate compliance
with these requirements”.277 JPMorgan
Chase should clarify the interplay between
these two statements and whether the bank
requires clients to obtain FPIC regardless of
the location of the relevant project. If the
requirement for clients to comply with IFC
Performance Standard 7 applies in the case
of loans for tar sands pipelines, JPMorgan
Chase should explain how it is satisfying itself
that this is being adhered to in the case of the
Trans Mountain Expansion project and any
other relevant projects.

TD BANK GROUP AND WORLD
HERITAGE SITES
Financing Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain
Expansion project appears to conflict with
TD’s policy which states that TD does not
finance transactions relating to activities

within World Heritage sites.278 Approximately
80km of the expanded pipeline will run
through Jasper National Park, a World Heritage
Site, and ’‘reactivation’ activities will possibly
be carried out within the park.

6.3 CONSUMER BACKLASH
Banks involved in DAPL, a project similarly
affected by these issues, faced intense
scrutiny from civil society, media, investor, and
consumers with the closure of bank accounts
with an estimated worth of $5bn.279 Investors
representing $653 billion in assets under
management, including New York City pension
funds and the California Public Employees
Retirement System, signed an investor
statement supporting a rerouting of the
pipeline citing a need to “protect the banks’
reputation and consumer base and to avoid
legal liabilities.”280

Any financial institution associated with tar
sands pipeline projects should expect to
meet similar scrutiny and opposition from civil
society around the world. Soon after President
Trump approved the federal Keystone
XL permit, the Seattle City Council voted
unanimously that it would not contract with
any banks that finance TransCanada.281 In May
2017, Native American leaders and activists
occupied a number of Chase bank branches in
Seattle, requiring them to close temporarily.282

27

7. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

POTENTIAL FUNDERS
We believe, given the range of potential climate,
human rights and local environmental impacts
associated with tar sands pipelines, that
financial institutions should not finance, arrange
and/or underwrite the provision of finance for
the construction, expansion and/or operation
of tar sands pipelines, whether in the form of
project-specific lending, general corporate
lending (without restrictions on the purpose
of facilities), corporate bonds or shares to or
in any of Kinder Morgan, TransCanada, and
Enbridge and/or their subsidiaries.

BANKS AND POTENTIAL
INVESTORS IN TAR SANDS
PRODUCERS AND PIPELINE
COMPANIES
We believe that banks and other financial
institutions should review their overall financial
exposure to tar sands companies – including
via pipeline companies – and take steps to
ensure the compatibility of their lending and
investment policies and practices for such
companies with:

f  the prudent mitigation of climate risk and
the ambitions of the Paris Agreement; and
f  international best practice on human rights.

EXISTING LENDERS
We believe existing lenders to the Kinder
Morgan, TransCanada and Enbridge corporate
groups should:

f  sell their existing stake in all or confirm
that they will not participate or arrange
the renewal of any of the existing credit
facilities provided to each of Kinder
Morgan, TransCanada, and Enbridge, and/
or their subsidiaries, if such facilities may be
used, directly or indirectly, to finance the
construction, expansion, and/or operation
of tar sands pipelines; and

f  confirm that they will neither participate in,
arrange, nor underwrite any future credit
facilities to, or any issue of securities by,
those companies and/or their subsidiaries
which may be used, directly or indirectly,
to finance the construction, expansion,
and/or operation of tar sands pipelines.

28

INVESTORS IN BANKS
We believe that institutional investors in banks
should engage with their investee companies to
understand whether the various risks associated
with financing tar sands pipelines are being
adequately assessed, mitigated and managed.
Below, we suggest questions that institutional
shareholders may wish to ask of banks.

QUESTIONS FOR BANKS
f  Does the bank have specific published
policies on tar sands finance, FPIC and
climate risk mitigation?

f  Does the bank intend to advance credit
facilities which might be used directly or
indirectly to fund the construction and/or
operation of any of the proposed tar sands
pipeline projects?

f  What changes has the bank made to
its due diligence and risk assessment
processes following the criticism suffered
by it or its peers following the DAPL
controversy?

f  Does the bank require enhanced due

diligence to be carried out for tar sands
projects including pipelines? If so, what
are the additional issues considered in an
enhanced due diligence process?
f  If the bank has provided, or intends to

provide, finance in connection with a tar
sands pipeline project, is the approval
by the Lead Banks of a thorough and
independent human rights impact
assessment of the project in line with the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights Reporting Framework a
condition precedent to financial close?

f  Will the terms of reference of the
independent human rights impact
assessment be finalised after consultation
with other stakeholders and will they be
published?

f  Does the bank have plans to engage
directly with potentially affected
Indigenous Nations and Tribes and local
communities along the proposed pipeline
routes, independent experts, and with
other stakeholders prior to financial close
to ensure the bank’s decision-making
is based on information from a range
of sources rather than just those of
the borrower?

f  If due diligence identifies the relevant
tar sands pipeline project as high risk,
what steps will be taken by the bank to
mitigate the potential legal, financial, and
reputational risks and to ensure that the
rights of the people potentially affected
by the pipeline project are protected?
f  Does the bank agree with the call by some
Equator Principles banks to apply the FPIC
standard in all countries?

f  If the bank has provided, or intends to

provide, finance in connection with a tar
sands pipeline project, is the approval
by the Lead Banks of a thorough and
independent environmental impact
assessment – including the impact of any
spills along the route – of the relevant
tar sands pipeline project a condition
precedent to financial close?
f  Will the terms of reference of the

independent environmental impact
assessment be finalised after consultation

with other stakeholders and will they
be published?

f  If the bank has provided, or intends to

provide, finance in connection with a tar
sands pipeline project, how does the bank
reconcile, from the perspective of climate
risk mitigation, both its decision to lend and
its various statements and initiatives?
f  Given the shifting fortunes of the tar

sands (as evidenced by the retreat of oil
majors including Shell) and the tar sands’
vulnerability from a wasted capital point
of view to the impacts of climate policy
and disruptive technology on global oil
demand, what steps has the bank taken to
assess its overall exposure to the sector?
Does the bank have plans to reduce that
exposure in the short-term?

f  Has the bank assessed the impact of

reduced oil demand from key projected
growth markets such as China and India on
the viability of the proposed pipelines?
f  If the bank has provided or intends to

provide finance in connection with a tar
sands pipeline project, what steps will it
take to mitigate the potential risk to its
reputation and consumer backlash?

f  How does TD reconcile its policy on World
Heritage sites with its role in financing and
arranging finance for Kinder Morgan’s Trans
Mountain Expansion project?

f  Given the wording of JPMorgan Chase’s
policy on Indigenous rights, can the
bank confirm its position on the need to
demonstrate FPIC prior to advancing any
funds for the construction of any of the
proposed tar sands pipelines?

29

CONCLUSION

A number of banks, including JPMorgan
Chase, Royal Bank of Canada, TD Bank Group,
Barclays and Wells Fargo risk opposition from
Indigenous communities, pressure from civil
society groups, and scrutiny from investors as
a result of their actual or potential involvement
in climate-damaging and controversial tar
sands pipeline projects in Canada and the US.

projects, banks and purchasers of newly
issued securities therefore risk exacerbating
climate change and climate risk. In addition
to the climate risks associated with the
proposed tar sands pipelines, the track record
of the pipeline companies on spills gives
rise to concern in light of the thousands of
waterways potentially affected.

The expansion of the tar sands is incompatible
with achieving the goals of the Paris
Agreement. If no new tar sands pipeline
projects are completed, there will be no
pipeline export capacity for tar sands projects
that have yet to break ground. In financing
the construction of tar sands pipeline

Lenders and investors must question whether
the pipeline companies are adequately
assessing and addressing the full range of risks
inherent in these controversial projects and
whether their decisions to lend or purchase
securities are in their long-term best interests.

This report outlines the financial and
reputation risks banks, their investors and
investors in pipeline companies could face in
arranging and providing finance for companies
intending to build tar sands pipelines. We make
a number of recommendations for potential
pipeline financiers and we suggest questions
for bank investors to ask to understand
whether the various risks associated with
these projects are being adequately assessed,
mitigated and managed.

range of $65-70/bbl, when existence of new pipelines
becomes determinative as to whether new production
proceeds. If prices stay around $50, the pipelines would
have no climate impact, because there would not be
enough oil to fill them (see Section 4).

33  As Figure 6 shows, modest new tar sands production

requires a WTI price of $65-70/bbl, and significant new
production (sufficient to fill a pipeline) requires $70-75.
These breakeven prices, estimated by Rystad Energy,
assume construction of new pipelines to transport
the product to market. In the absence of pipelines, the
additional cost of rail transportation generally adds
about $20 to the breakeven price of non-upgraded
projects (Greenpeace & Oil Change International.

Hence in the absence of pipelines, prices of $85-90 and
$90-95 are required for modest and significant new

31

production respectively. Therefore, if oil price is below
$65-70, negligible new production will be added, even if
pipelines are built. If oil price is above this level but below
$85-90, new production will be possible only if pipelines
are built ie pipelines become determinative of new
production.

131  In this report ‘Kinder Morgan’, ‘Enbridge’, and

‘TransCanada’ are used to refer to Kinder Morgan Inc.
Enbridge Inc. and TransCanada Inc. and to their relevant
subsidiaries. Likewise, the short-form name of a bank
is used to refer to the parent company and to their
relevant subsidiaries.

132  Credit Agreement dated June 16 2017 between
Kinder Morgan ULC as Principal Borrower, Trans
Mountain Pipeline ULC as NEB Reserve Borrower, and
the persons party thereto from time to time in their
capacity as Lenders, and Royal Bank of Canada as
Administrative Agent and with RBC Capital Markets,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Bank of
Nova Scotia and TD Securities as Co-Lead Arrangers

133  Caisse Centrale Desjardins has subsequently confirmed
in correspondence with Greenpeace that it has adopted
a moratorium on future financing of energy pipelines
until it completes a policy review.

134  In addition to this project credit facility, Kinder Morgan
Inc. has existing revolving credit and term loan facilities
under credit agreements dated 9 September 2014 and
26 January 2016 respectively which are scheduled to
mature in 2019. There are a number of additional banks
listed as lenders on one or both of those agreements
who have not participated in the the recent project
facility. Accordingly, we have not not listed them. One
of those is ING which has confirmed in correspondence
with Greenpeace that its oil sands exclusion policy will
extend to tar sands pipelines.

climate-on-the-line-why-new-tar-sands-pipelines-
are-incompatible-with-the-paris-goals/

159  This climate impact assumes oil prices recover to a

range of $65-70/bbl, when existence of new pipelines
becomes determinative as to whether new production
proceeds. If prices stay around $50, the pipelines would
have no climate impact, because there would not be
enough oil to fill them.

165  As Figure 6 shows, modest new tar sands production

requires a WTI price of $65-70/bbl, and significant new
production (sufficient to fill a pipeline) requires $70-75.
These breakeven prices, estimated by Rystad Energy,
assume construction of new pipelines to transport
the product to market. In the absence of pipelines, the
additional cost of rail transportation generally adds
about $20 to the breakeven price of non-upgraded
projects (Greenpeace & Oil Change International.
2016. Flawed Fundamentals: Shell’s and BP’s Stalled
Tar Sands Ambitions. September. Figure 11, p.25
(p.27 of pdf). www.greenpeace.org.uk/wp-content/
uploads/2017/06/FlawedFundamentalsTarSands.pdf.
Hence in the absence of pipelines, prices of $85-90 and
$90-95 are required for modest and significant new
production respectively. Therefore, if oil price is below
$65-70, negligible new production will be added, even if
pipelines are built. If oil price is above this level but below
$85-90, new production will be possible only if pipelines
are built ie pipelines become determinative of new
production.
