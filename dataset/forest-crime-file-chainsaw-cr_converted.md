Executive summary

“Wijma operates concessions in Africa and is committed to ensuring full compliance with all
relevant forest regulations.” Wijma website

“Wijma is also committed to achieving environmental best practice throughout its activity
whenever this is practical.” Wijma Environmental policy

In its company literature, the Dutch logger and timber trader Wijma has made many claims
about the environmental and social acceptability of its timber. However, Wijma not only
buys from some of the most notorious logging companies in Africa1, but is also itself
involved in illegal logging in Cameroon.

In April 2002, Greenpeace released information about Wijma’s illegal logging activities in
Cameroon. Greenpeace and Forests Monitor released additional information about Wijma
logging illegally in August last year. Wijma claims these cases were isolated incidents.

n o t e s

Yet, in March 2003, researchers from Centre pour l’Environnement et le Developpement
(CED), Forests Monitor and Greenpeace documented further evidence of the company’s
illegal activities. The joint field investigations revealed that Wijma has used its legally
allocated cutting permit, VC 09-04-59, to illegally access and log a much larger area, well
outside the official limits of this permit. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) co-ordinates,
the investigations have provided evidence of an illegal road network, log ponds2 and
abandoned logs over an area of about 14 km2.

1 Recent Greenpeace investigations reveal that

Wijma continues to buy timber from Liberia,

despite numerous written statements that it

had stopped. Profits made by the Liberian

logging industry are used to finance conflicts in

the region. Several Liberian timber companies

are themselves involved in illegal arms

trafficking.

2 Log ponds (parc à bois) are areas where logs

are temporarily stored prior to their transport.

Forest crime file: Chainsaw criminal Wijma

Some of the illegally cut logs were found to have been fraudulently marked with Wijma’s
legal logging title VC 09-04-59, which is a clear method of laundering illegal timber into the
marketplace. The investigations also revealed that Wijma’s illegal logging operation was both
destructive and highly wasteful, causing significant ecological damage.

Also, it caused significant economic damages to the Cameroonian government, and large
economic and social damages to local communities. Preliminary estimates indicate that the
illegally produced timber is worth (FOB value) in the region of  € 1,5 million (1 billion
FCFA)3. Road construction has destroyed agricultural and cash crops of at least 27 local
villagers. These farmers depend upon these plantations for food and cash incomes, and have
not been compensated at all. CED, Forests Monitor and Greenpeace believe that Wijma must
be held accountable for the damage it has caused, and that the Cameroonian government
and the local people must be fully compensated.

Box 1 - Ventes de coupe

“Ventes de coupe” (VC) are titles to log an area of 2,500 hectares in the non-
permanent forest estate over a three year period. These logging operations are
allocated at auction to the highest bidder, and are often exploited in a highly
destructive manner as no management plan is legally required. VC logging titles are
widely abused in Cameroon, and the titles are often used to organise illegal logging
operations in a much more extensive forest area than is allowed by the legal title.
One World Bank financed report revealed that up to 90% of ventes de coupe in
Cameroon’s East Province are operated illegally.4

To this end CED, Forests Monitor and Greenpeace call on:

• The Government of Cameroon – to urgently carry out a detailed inventory to calculate the

real economic damage this illegal logging operation has caused, to impose adequate
sanctions on Wijma, and to ensure full compensation for the local people affected by
Wijma’s illegal logging operation.

• The Dutch government and other Wijma customers – to stop buying from Wijma until
Wijma stops its illegal logging operations, stops buying from known criminals and
commits to moving towards certification at least to the standards demanded by the Forest
Stewardship Council (FSC).

• Governments - to adopt green procurement policies. Governments should only buy timber
from legal forestry operations, which are certified at least to the standards demanded by
the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).

• The Cameroon and Dutch governments and the European Union - to strengthen legislation
against illegal logging and the trade in illegal timber, and make sure these laws are fully
enforced.

THE COMPANY GEBROEDERS WIJMA EN ZONEN B.V. (GWZ)

The Dutch logger and importer Wijma (GWZ) specialises in
highly durable timber for marine engineering projects. An
important part of Wijma’s trading activity is focused on the
African species azobé. Wijma operates one of the world’s
largest azobé sawmills, located at the Wijma headquarters in
Kampen, the Netherlands. The company owns subsidiaries
and additional sawmills in Germany, Cameroon, Ghana and
Ivory Coast, and has sales offices in the US, France and the
UK. Wijma has been active in Africa for over thirty years.

Greenpeace first began exposing Wijma’s involvement in
illegal and conflict timber in November 2001. Since that
time, Greenpeace has been involved in ongoing discussions
with Wijma about a number of issues.

Timber from Liberia is not produced sustainably. Moreover, the profits made by the Liberian
logging industry have been used to finance conflicts in the region. Several Liberian timber
companies, such as OTC, are themselves involved in illegal arms trafficking.5 Over the past
1 1/2 years, Wijma has made several statements about ending its purchases of Liberian
timber in letters to Greenpeace.

Wijma statements about ending its purchases of Liberian timber

• In November 2001, Wijma claims it does not buy from the notorious Liberian

company OTC.

• In December 2001, Wijma claims it will stop buying from the company RTC,

which is linked to OTC.

• In January 2002, Wijma agrees to stop buying from the Liberian companies

LFCD, MGC and Forum.

• In April 2002, Wijma claims it stopped buying from OTC, RTC and SMI in the

late summer of 2001.

• In July 2002, Wijma claims it has stopped buying azobé from Liberia.

n o t e s

• In September 2002, Wijma claims it stopped buying timber from Liberia earlier

that year.

• In March 2003,Wijma claims there are no more wood transports from Liberia

to Wijma.

Yet, despite these repeated claims, Greenpeace investigations have revealed that Wijma has
received wood from Liberia several times in 2002, and as late as March 2003. Among the
logging companies Wijma bought from were OTC and RTC. The latest shipment, arriving
on the MV Liski in Nordenham, Germany, in March 2003, came from Inland Logging
Company. Wood species bought by Wijma from Liberian suppliers are usually Azobé, Abura
and Framiré with occasionally other typical African species like Sipo, Sapelli, and Iroko.
While Azobé is used by bridge builders and for marine construction, Abura and Framiré are
largely consumed by the door industry.

Box 2 - Wijma’s illegal timber on the European market

Is this timber legally produced?
Once Wijma’s sawn timber arrives on the
European market, it is impossible for the customer
to verify its legality. Logs from legal and illegal
sources are easily mixed and could be processed
together in Wijma’s sawmills in Cameroon or in
Europe.

Wijma and Hazim: Cameroon’s most notorious logger

The logging company Hazim has been involved in large scale illegal logging several years.6
After nearly a year of discussions between Wijma and Greenpeace, Wijma finally agreed, in
September 2002, to stop buying from Hazim. It is unclear whether Wijma is keeping this
written promise.

Wijma logging illegally in Cameroon

Wijma itself has been involved in illegal logging numerous times.

In July 2002, Greenpeace and Forests Monitor discovered Wijma logging illegally outside its
vente de coupe 09-02-132. Not only did Wijma destroy a large area of tropical rainforest by
its illegal operation, the company also destroyed many farms of the local population. Wijma
has publicly admitted logging outside its legal limits. To this day, Wijma is still not willing to
pay proper compensation to the local community for its losses.7

Before this case, Wijma had been caught in the act of committing fraud at least three times.8

On February 3, 2003, the Minister of MINEF suspended all Wijma activities in its
concession UFA 11-002. The reason for the suspension was the fact that Wijma said it had a
local sawmill, a requirement for attaining a concession. However, at the time Wijma applied
for the concession, it had already sold its sawmill.9

8 In January 2002, Wijma was fined FCFA
1,836,415 (+/- € 2.750) for cutting protected

trees without authorization and for cutting

undersized trees. In addition, the provincial

control brigade of Cameroon’s Ministry of

Environment and Forests (MINEF) proposed

that local Wijma director Mr. Bertein should
pay FCFA 2,500,000 (€ 3.750) for transporting

timber without legal documents. Also in

January 2002, MINEF notified Wijma’s

subsidiary STIK that all its activities were to be

suspended due to the company’s complicity in

fraudulent logging practices carried out in a

forest reserve by the company Helena Bois.

WIJMA LOGS ILLEGALLY AGAIN

In March 2003, researchers from Centre pour l’Environnement et le Developpement (CED),
Forests Monitor and Greenpeace documented further evidence of the Wijma’s illegal
activities. The joint field investigations have revealed that Wijma has seriously abused its
legally allocated logging title vente de coupe 09-04-59 to log a much larger area. The illegal
logging has caused substantial ecological damage.

Wijma was awarded the cutting permit VC 09-04-59 on 21-03-2000.10 The logging area is
located in the department of the Ntem valley (Ambam district) in the South province of
Cameroon. Using a GPS receiver11 to record geographic co-ordinates, CED, Forests Monitor
and Greenpeace documented two extensive road networks, 11 log ponds, abandoned logs
and stumps over an area of about 14 km2 outside Wijma’s legal VC boundaries (see Map 1).

East of its vente de coupe, Wijma continued its logging road outside the legal logging area.
The illegal portion of the road, composed of several branches to the north and south, had
been hidden by an enormous blockade of abandoned logs. The investigation showed five
illegal log ponds and a large number of abandoned logs, indicating Wijma logged in the
forest surrounding this illegal road. Moreover, south of its vente de coupe, Wijma built a
whole illegal road network, starting about 6 km to the south of the VC. Here, the
investigation showed six illegal log ponds. Only a small river separates the two parts of the
illegal logging operation.

Caught on the spot in Cameroon’s

rainforest: abandoned Wijma (GWZ) log

illegally cut outside Wijma’s valid cutting

permit. The log has been fraudulently

marked using the code of Wijma’s valid

cutting permit VC 09-04-59.

Abandoned logs carrying the markings of Wijma’s vente de coupe 09-04-59 and the
company’s markings (GWZ) were found in log ponds along tracks in both parts of the illegal
logging operation, indicating that Wijma had been operating illegally well outside their
official limits.

Interviews with inhabitants of the villages surrounding the logging area further indicated
Wijma hired the Cameroon logging company CUF to do the logging. Villagers further
revealed that Wijma had cut a range of valuable species such as Azobé, Moabi, Sapelli,
and Iroko12. Villagers said the wood was taken to Kribi, where Wijma has a sawmill. In
the whole area of the logging operation, large numbers of abandoned logs were found.

These field investigations additionally reveal that Wijma logged inside the unallocated forest
management unit UFA 09-02213
(see Map 1). These findings indicate that Wijma has illegally logged significant amounts of
timber from this unallocated forest management unit. Wijma’s illegal activities are likely to
have seriously undermined the potential for sustainable forestry in
this area.

Based on the road network, the log ponds and the abandoned logs that this investigation
uncovered, it is clear that Wijma has carried out an extensive illegal logging operation in this
area. Calculations, based on Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis and the
identification of illegal logging roads on satellite images, indicate that the area harvested in
this illegal operation by Wijma could be as large as 14 km2 – an additional area about two
thirds the size of their existing legal cutting permit.

Economic losses to the Government of Cameroon

Initial estimates indicate that the volume of Wijma’s timber logged illegally – and laundered
into the marketplace using fraudulent markings – may total around 9,800 cubic metres, with
an estimated FOB value of nearly 1 billion FCFA (€ 1,5 million)14. On top of the lost timber
value, there are additional losses worth tens of thousands of euro’s in tax revenues that the
Cameroon government has not received. For example, stumpage fees at 2.5% of the FOB
value of cut timber are among a number of taxes that are due on legally cut timber.

These calculations have been based on the following assumptions:
• that Wijma has logged illegally at least 14 km2 (1400 hectares) of rainforest;
• that on average, one hectare of forest yielded seven cubic metres of timber15;
• that the average FOB value of Cameroon timber is 100,000 FCFA (€ 150) per cubic meter.

forest is between 7 and 15 cubic metres per

hectare.

Increased poverty of rural people in Cameroon

In addition to its ecological damage and economic implications for the Cameroonian
government, Wijma’s illegal logging operation has also caused severe economic damage
locally, and many farmers interviewed expressed great anger regarding the destruction Wijma
and its subcontractor CUF have caused to the forest and to their agricultural crops.

In areas where Wijma was cutting illegally, the road construction and logging have destroyed
numerous agricultural crops and the small-scale plantations owned by the local farmers. At
least 27 farmers in three different villages (Ngom, Biyii, and Meyo-Elie, See Map 1) have
become victims of Wijma’s logging operation, losing both food crops such as manioc and
plantains, and small scale cash crops such as cocoa. The direct damage to people’s
livelihoods caused by the destruction of local farmers’ fields was considerable, since the
farmers depend upon their plantations for food and cash incomes. The son of one local
farmer said he had not been able to go to school in the year his father’s plantation was
destroyed, because his father was not able to pay the school.

Box 3 - The importance of Azobé

Dutch forestry companies in Cameroon, including Wijma,
have specialised in the production of Azobé, a species highly
prized in the Netherlands for marine construction, and,
throughout Europe, for the fabrication of railroad ties. With
markets world-wide, Wijma is an extremely important player.

The, for a vente de coupe required, 10% of the annual forestry fee was never paid to the
villages. Farmers who had their crops destroyed by Wijma’s logging operation have received
no compensation at all. Also, Wijma promised the local people a school and wells for
drinking water. The school was not built to the promised standard and the wells were never
built at all. The fourth village, Mfoulekok, where the illegal logging road entered the forest,
never received the money promised.

In Europe, Wijma presents its African logging operations as a positive contribution towards
development and poverty alleviation for the local population. However, this case study
clearly illustrates that Wijma’s illegal logging operation is, in fact, impoverishing the
livelihoods of the local people. CED, Forests Monitor and Greenpeace are calling on Wijma’s
European management to accept full responsibility for the damage caused to the livelihoods
of the local farmers, and to organise full and fair compensation for the victims.

RECOMMENDATIONS

CED, Forests Monitor and Greenpeace recommend that:

• MINEF16 urgently conducts an official investigation into this case, assessing the

ecological, social and fiscal damages;

• MINEF holds the company fully accountable for the ecological, economic and social

impacts of its illegal logging operations and ensures payment of all fines and taxes to the
government and full compensation for the local communities;

• MINEF prohibits Wijma from receiving further logging permits until they can demonstrate

they are willing to operate within their legal obligations;

• Wijma provides immediate and adequate compensation to the local communities for the

damages caused to their livelihoods by this and earlier operations;

• The Dutch government and other Wijma customers stop buying from Wijma until Wijma

stops its involvement in illegal logging operations, stops buying from known criminals and
commits to moving towards certification at least to the standards demanded by the Forest
Stewardship Council;

• Governments adopt green procurement policies. Governments should only buy timber

from legal forestry operations, which are certified at least to the standards demanded by
the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC);

• The Cameroon government establishes a clear procedure for processing and acting upon
third party findings of illegalities in the forestry sector in a rigorous and transparent
manner;

• The Cameroon and Dutch governments and the European Union strengthen legislation
against illegal logging and the trade in illegal timber, and make sure these laws are fully
enforced.
