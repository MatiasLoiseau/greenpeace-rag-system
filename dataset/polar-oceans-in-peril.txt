Introduction 
The Arctic and the Antarctic: two of the greatest wilderness areas on 
Earth, with ecosystems vital to the functioning of our planet. The 
snow-covered lands and icy waters of these polar regions are, for 
many people, the purest examples of true wilderness left on this 
planet. While the Arctic has been home to indigenous peoples for 
millennia, Antarctica has only played host to visiting explorers and 
scientists. Both polar oceans are, however, home to distinctive wildlife 
that has adapted to the extreme environmental conditions, such as the 
Arctic’s polar bears and the Antarctic’s penguins. Polar waters provide 
rich feeding grounds that sustain large populations of seabirds and 
marine mammals, including the majority of the world’s great whales. The Arctic and the Antarctic are under assault - from the impacts of 
rapidly accelerating climate change; from increased industrialisation; 
and from the unchecked consumption of our planet’s resources. 
Indicators of the planet’s health, the poles provide us with an early 
warning that we are compromising the Earth’s ability to sustain life as 
we know it. It is already too late to avoid profound negative changes at 
the poles. But, we can limit further impacts by establishing boundaries 
that stop the commercial ﬁshing ﬂeets and the oil and gas industries 
from plundering and polluting these already damaged ecosystems.

Climate change 
Some parts of the Arctic are among the fastest warming areas on the 
planet and consequently the Arctic is experiencing some of the most 
severe climate impacts - most notably, the rapid decline in the 
thickness and extent of sea ice. Some models suggest the Arctic 
Ocean could be ice-free in summer by 2030. Others suggest it could 
be as early as 2012. Permafrost is thawing, glaciers are melting, and 
the massive Greenland Ice Sheet is losing ice at record rates. Sea ice 
underpins the entire Arctic marine ecosystem. As it shrinks and thins, 
there are major repercussions and new challenges for the Arctic’s 
peoples and wildlife. 
In addition, many other stresses brought about by human activities 
are simultaneously affecting life in the Arctic, including air and water 
contamination, overﬁshing, increased levels of ultraviolet radiation 
due to ozone depletion, habitat alteration, and pollution due to 
resource extraction. The sum of these factors threatens to 
overwhelm the adaptive capacity of some Arctic populations 
and ecosystems altogether. Effect on the Arctic’s peoples and wildlife 
Coastal erosion caused by the rising sea level and a reduction in sea 
ice are allowing higher waves and storm surges to reach the shore, 
and some coastal communities are already being forced to relocate. 
Indigenous peoples will also be increasingly subjected to negative 
effects as reduced sea ice causes the animals on which they depend 
for food to become less accessible and to decline in numbers. Some 
species are already facing extinction. 
Polar bears are completely dependent on sea ice for their entire 
lifecycle – from raising their cubs to hunting seals that constitute their 
main prey. Researchers are reporting an increasing number of polar 
bears drowning because they have to swim longer distances between 
ice ﬂoes. Others are spending more time on land fasting as they wait 
for the sea ice to freeze up at the end of summer. Research has also 
found that, for the ﬁrst time, polar bears are cannibalising each other 
due to lack of food. 
Many other species, such as seals, whales and walruses, also 
depend on the sea ice. Ice-dependent seals, including the ringed 
seal, ribbon seal, spotted seal and bearded seal, are particularly 
vulnerable to the observed and projected reductions in Arctic sea ice 
because they give birth to and nurse their pups on the ice and use it 
as a resting platform. They also forage under the ice and near the ice 
edge. It is very unlikely that these species could adapt to life on land 
in the absence of summer sea ice.

Effects on the global climate 
The Arctic has been called ‘the world’s refrigerator’, and one reason 
for this is the role of sea ice in regulating global climate. Sea ice 
reﬂects heat from the sun back into space, whereas the dark open 
waters of the Arctic Ocean absorb it. As sea ice melts, more of the 
Arctic Ocean is exposed, meaning that more heat energy is 
absorbed. This causes more warming, which in turn causes more sea 
ice to melt and causes yet more warming to occur, continuing the 
process; an example of a highly dangerous positive feedback loop. 
Another positive feedback loop in the Arctic is melting permafrost. 
Permafrost is ground that is literally frozen solid, and it can be found 
throughout the Arctic land environment as well as the seabed below 
shallow parts of the Arctic Ocean. As temperatures rise, permafrost 
melts, releasing trapped methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - into 
the atmosphere; again, the warming is increased. 
The Arctic meltdown caused 
by runaway climate change will 
have grave consequences 
for the entire planet. 
Just as the receding ice is attracting the interest of those who hope to ﬁnd and extract more climate-changing fossil fuels, so too is it 
attracting the interest of the industrial ﬁshing industry. 
After having ﬁshed out many of the stocks in temperate waters, the industrial ﬁshing ﬂeets are now looking at the Poles for new stocks to exploit. 
In the Arctic, they have their eyes on the ﬁsh that have historically been protected in a ‘de-facto’ marine reserve underneath the Arctic sea ice. 
Arctic and sub-Arctic waters are among the most biologically productive in the world. At present, ﬁshing in the Arctic Ocean is limited by 
the sea ice that exists for most or all of the year. Climate change means warmer waters moving north, and with them, ﬁsh stocks. It also 
means longer periods and larger areas of open water, leaving the once protected Arctic breeding grounds open to industrial ﬁsheries. 
Marine life in the Arctic is already subject to massive pressure due to climate change and loss of sea ice; opening the area up to industrial 
ﬁshing would be an act of madness that would further damage the fragile ecosystem just at the time when it most needs protecting. 
Spurred on by concerns over the impacts of climate change on ﬁshing in the region, the North Paciﬁc Fisheries Management Council made 
the sensible decision in February 2009 to establish a moratorium on commercial ﬁshing in a vast zone off Alaska’s northern coast. This 
move was applauded by Greenpeace, and will help give marine life in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas a much better chance of surviving the 
loss of sea ice and the increasing ocean acidiﬁcation that are predicted for Arctic waters in the coming decades. Box 1 ‘De-facto’ Arctic marine reserve under threat from industrial ﬁsheries

Greenpeace believes that a ‘line in the ice’ should be drawn around this area, which has historically been protected under the ice,and a 
moratorium on all industrial activities should be put in place until a new overarching governance regime has been agreed and implemented. Figure 1.1 Map of the Arctic showing the average minimum sea ice extent from 1979 - 2000

© ØyVinD HaGen/statOilHyDrO Drilling for oil in the Arctic: the wrong answer 
The impacts of climate change in the Arctic underscore the urgency 
with which the world’s governments must seriously reduce CO 2
emissions from burning fossil fuels. Yet, many are instead racing to 
secure their ‘right’ to drill for the oil that may be found underneath the 
Arctic ice. They show little interest in preventing devastating climate 
change by enacting policies to reduce CO 2emissions and to increase 
the use of renewable energy resources. They appear to view the 
destruction of the Arctic ecosystem as an opportunity to pump out 
yet more climate destroying oil. 
The world’s leaders are facing an intelligence test. Should they drill and 
burn the fossil fuels reserves that are accessible only because climate 
change is causing the sea ice to melt? Or should they protect the 
Arctic and give it a chance to adapt to the already catastrophic 
changes taking place, while enacting policies that reduce national CO 2
emissions and putting in place renewable energy systems? 
So far, the melting sea ice has driven a rush of seabed studies, each 
aimed at showing the continuation of the continental shelf to the 
North Pole, and thus sovereignty over those parts of the Arctic. The 
US, Canada and Russia have dispatched icebreakers, submarines 
and prime ministers to pursue their sovereignty claims, and other 
Arctic states are also involved in the melee. The planting of a Russian 
ﬂag on the Lomonosov Ridge, a 1,200-mile underwater mountain 
range, and Russia’s claim that it had enough evidence to prove it is 
part of Russia’s continental shelf, made worldwide headlines in 2007. 
The ‘race’ to exploit the oil rumoured to be under the Arctic ice also 
threatens global security. It has been identiﬁed as a serious threat to 
global peace with the increased activity in the region leading to 
discussions at NATO and to increases in Arctic military spending by 
the US, Canada, Russia and other Arctic nations. 
We need to act now to prevent 
a new ‘cold war’ from 
developing in the Arctic.

image British Petroleum’s controversial Northstar oil production facility. Construction site, Alaska, USA. As the decline in Arctic sea ice causes historically closed routes 
such as the Northwest and Northeast Passages to open up, 
questions arise regarding security and safety. New access to 
shipping routes and new opportunities for oil extraction bring with 
them the increasing risk of environmental degradation caused by 
these activities. One obvious concern is oil spills and other 
industrial accidents. It is clear from studies and experience that the 
effects of oil spills in a high-latitude, cold ocean environment last 
much longer and are far worse than in other areas. Oil spill clean- 
up is rarely effective but in the Arctic conditions any clean-up 
attempt at all will be impossible for much of the year due to 
extreme darkness, temperature and solid or broken ice conditions. Box 2 Impacts of opening new sea routes 

Greenpeace International Polar oceans in peril and a planet at risk 9Current and Future Governance 
Unlike Antarctica, there is no single overarching treaty governing 
activities in the Arctic. 
With only a patchwork of different rules and regulations in place, most 
of which are not legally binding, the Arctic environment and its marine 
life are currently wide open to exploitation, bad practice and illegality. 
Set up in 1996, the Arctic Council - a high-level intergovernmental 
forum comprised of the eight Arctic nations (Canada, 
Denmark/Greenland/Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, 
Sweden, and the USA) and six Indigenous Peoples’ organisations - 
plays an important role. However it remains to be seen if it will be the 
protector of the Arctic or its exploiter. 
Despite recognising the vulnerable and unique nature of the region, 
and having now had many years in which to develop an appropriate 
governance regime, the Arctic Council has only managed to put 
forward non-binding recommendations with no enforcement. In the 
meantime, the agenda of the members of the Arctic Council appears to 
be moving towards opening up the Arctic Ocean for oil exploration and 
industrial ﬁshing, thus taking advantage of the melting ice instead of 
taking the action required to protect the already damaged ecosystem. 
Given the issues of global signiﬁcance affecting the Arctic and the 
many signiﬁcant gaps in the existing legislation, there is a clear need 
for an overarching Arctic multi-lateral agreement or treaty, in which the 
Arctic Council could play a leading role, which ensures the highest 
levels of protection for the Arctic and in particular for the areas of the 
Arctic Ocean that have traditionally been protected under the ice. 
While such a transparent, participatory and equitable agreement is 
being negotiated, nations and stakeholders must ‘freeze the footprint’ 
of growing industrial activities in the Arctic by establishing a 
moratorium on further industrial development in the areas made 
accessible by the retreating sea ice. Greenpeace calls upon the United Nations and governments around 
the world to commit to the following course of action to save the Arctic: 
• Establish an immediate moratorium on industrial 
development in the area of the Arctic Ocean that has 
historically been covered by sea ice year-round. This ‘line in 
the ice’ is the average minimum sea ice extent between 1979 
and 2000, the period before signiﬁcant sea-ice loss due to 
climate change was recorded. 
•Create a long-term solution by agreeing a permanent, 
equitable and overarching treaty or multi-lateral agreement 
that protects the Arctic Ocean environment and ecosystems 
and the peoples who depend on them.

10 Greenpeace International Polar oceans in peril and a planet at risk Antarctica – current and future threats 

Greenpeace International Polar oceans in peril and a planet at risk 11 Unlike the Arctic, for the past 50 years activities in Antarctica have 
been regulated by the Antarctic Treaty and the related agreements 
that make up the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). Together, these 
constitute the overarching governance regime that has set many 
important precedents over the years. In particular, the historic 1991 
agreement to prohibit all mineral extraction in Antarctica for 50 years 
set an example for a new relationship with planet Earth.  Agreed after 
many years of negotiation and campaigning, the moratorium provided 
the equitable and environmentally-safe solution to settling international 
claims to the oil reserves under the ice, a lesson that would be well 
applied to the current situation in the Arctic. Greenpeace played a 
major role in securing this moratorium and for bringing countries 
onside in support of the ‘World Park Antarctica’ campaign. 
Despite the existence of the ATS, Antarctica and the surrounding Southern 
Ocean are not safe from a range of current and emerging threats. 
Climate change 
Climate change is driving major changes in Antarctic, just as it is in 
the Arctic. Although some areas are apparently cooling, recent 
studies show that the continent as a whole appears to be warming. 
The most dramatic changes are happening around the Antarctic 
Peninsula, which is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. 
A recent review showed that over the last 61 years, 87% of the 
glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula have retreated. This retreat began 
at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and, over time, has 
moved southwards as temperatures have risen. Effects on Antarctica’s wildlife 
While there has been an increase in sea ice in some parts of 
Antarctica - a change linked to increased offshore winds resulting 
from the ozone hole - there has also been a signiﬁcant reduction in 
duration and extent of winter sea ice west of the Antarctic 
Peninsula. Just as sea ice is critical to the marine life of the Arctic, so 
it is to the marine life of the Antarctic. Krill, the basis of the Antarctic 
food web, use winter sea ice as a nursery and its loss leads to a fall in 
krill numbers the following summer. In turn, the fall in krill numbers has 
consequences for the whales, seals and penguins that feed on them. 
In addition, Adélie and emperor penguins rely on the sea ice in 
Antarctica for breeding and feeding, just like polar bears do in the 
Arctic. Polar bears and emperor penguins may live at opposite ends 
of the Earth, but it turns out they may have more in common than we 
realised - and not in a good way. Already, it appears that in some 
places ice-dependent Adélie penguins are being replaced by open- 
water species. According to a recent Woods Hole study, a large 
emperor penguin colony in Terre Adélie, Antarctica, could face the 
loss of 95% of its population by the end of the century.

12 Greenpeace International Polar oceans in peril and a planet at risk Antarctic krill are small shrimp–like crustaceans that are the principle 
food source for many Antarctic predators including seals, penguins, 
albatross, various ﬁsh species and the seven species of baleen 
whales that feed in the Southern Ocean. Occurring in vast swarms, 
krill have long been targeted by ﬁshing vessels from several nations. 
The advent of new technology that enables a single state-of-the-art 
trawler to vacuum up as much as 45,000 tonnes in a single season, 
together with growing markets for aquaculture feed and nutritional 
supplements, are likely drivers for a massive expansion of the krill 
ﬁshing industry in the near future. Even at current levels there are 
concerns that localised depletion of krill may be impacting on 
populations of krill predators. Factor into this the possible impacts of 
climate change and observed krill declines in some parts of the 
Southern Ocean and there is real reason to fear that the whole basis 
of the Antarctic food web is at risk. Box 3 Krill 
The devastation of whale populations due to commercial whaling in 
the Southern Ocean is well documented, with 95% of the biomass 
of whales lost and the blue whale being brought to the edge of 
extinction. The 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling and the 
subsequent 1994 designation of the Southern Ocean Whale 
Sanctuary should have stopped whaling in the Southern Ocean 
once and for all, but the government of Japan has continued its 
hunt, despite international opposition, under the guise of so-called 
‘scientiﬁc’ whaling. 
Whale populations are facing many other threats aside from the 
harpoon. These include climate change, ship strikes, underwater 
noise and expanded ﬁshing for krill. Although Antarctic blue whales 
have been ofﬁcially protected since 1965 there are no signs that 
this species has recovered, with only around 1% of an estimated 
original population of 250,000 remaining. The reasons for this 
failure to recover are unknown, but environmental factors are likely 
to be important. Box 4 Whales

Toothﬁsh can reach 2 metres in length and can weigh as much as 
100kg.  Living up to 35 years, they become sexually mature when 
they are 6 to 9 years of age. Because their populations recover 
very slowly they are highly vulnerable to over-exploitation, yet they 
are targeted by both legal and illegal vessels. 
Fishing for toothﬁsh is mainly conducted with longlines - ﬁshing 
lines tens of kilometres long, each one carrying hundreds of baited 
hooks - and has been responsible for very high levels of ‘bycatch’, 
the term used for ﬁsh and animals that are unintentionally caught 
and then thrown overboard, often dead or injured.  
Bycatch has been reduced to very small numbers in the legal 
ﬁshery but the pirate ﬁshing ﬂeets are almost certainly still catching 
high numbers of seabirds and other animals. Pirate ﬁshing, ofﬁcially 
referred to as illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) ﬁshing, 
remains a major threat to the Antarctic ﬁshery. As soon as the 
pirate ﬂeet has taken all the ﬁsh from one area, it moves on - it has 
been estimated that, in some areas, the illegal catch is 10 times 
greater than the legal catch.  
A recent development among the toothﬁsh pirates is the use of 
plastic monoﬁlament gillnets instead of longlines. No data are 
available on the birds, mammals and other marine species caught 
as bycatch in gillnets within the area, but it is known to be a ﬁshing 
method with high levels of bycatch. Additionally, lost nets may carry 
on ‘ghost ﬁshing,’ continuing to trap and kill ﬁsh and other species 
as they drift through the ocean. 
Both legal and illegal toothﬁsh vessels operate in the Ross Sea, 
one of the last areas of pristine ocean on our planet. The Ross 
Sea’s unique marine life gives it a biological and evolutionary 
signiﬁcance comparable to that of the Galapagos Islands. It is 
madness to lose this priceless treasure to the commercial interests 
of a handful of ﬁshing vessels. 
To preserve this unique ocean ecosystem, with its entire food chain 
and top predators intact, the Ross Sea must be protected as a 
marine reserve. This will also provide us a ‘living laboratory’ to help 
us further understand the impacts of climate change and how 
undisturbed ocean ecosystems function. Box 5 Toothﬁsh ﬁshing

14 Greenpeace International Polar oceans in peril and a planet at risk Effects on the global climate 
The most spectacular physical changes in the Antarctic environment 
relate to the ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula. These are ﬂoating 
extensions of a grounded ice-sheet and most of them are located in 
bays around the Antarctic continent. It has been estimated that 14,000 
square kilometres of ice have been lost from 10 ﬂoating ice shelves in 
Antarctica over the last 50 years. Although these ice shelves are ﬂoating 
- and therefore, their breaking off will not contribute to sea-level rise 
directly - their loss will accelerate the speed at which glaciers feeding 
into the ice shelves move towards and eventually dump ice into the sea. 
This will contribute to sea-level rise. 
The British Antarctic Survey lists seven ice shelves that have been 
seriously impacted by warming on the Antarctic Peninsula. In some 
cases dramatic collapses have occurred, such as the loss of the 
Larsen A ice shelf in 1995, which collapsed in a matter of weeks. The 
Prince Gustav ice shelf also collapsed in 1995, having retreated 
progressively during the late 20th century. This was followed in 2002 
by the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf. 
The Wilkins ice shelf is likely to be next. Its collapse has been 
predicted since it lost around 1000 square kilometres in 1998. Ten 
years later, in March 2008, a further 400 square kilometres was lost. 
In late November 2008, new rifts developed on the Wilkins ice shelf. 
In April 2009, the 25-mile long ice bridge connecting the Wilkins Ice 
Shelf to the Antarctic continent splintered, putting the entire ice shelf 
at risk of further disintegration. Current and Future Governance 
Although progressive in many ways, the Antarctic Treaty and its sister 
body, the Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources (CCAMLR) do not currently provide the protection that the 
Southern Ocean and its unique marine life needs in the face of the 
existing and emerging threats. Although all the legal and procedural 
mechanisms to establish a comprehensive and representative network 
of marine reserves in the Southern Ocean exist within the Antarctic 
Treaty System, progress to date has been pitifully slow. 
At the 50th meeting of the Antarctic Treaty in Baltimore in April 2009, 
parties agreed to work in conjunction with CCAMLR to establish a 
comprehensive and representative network of marine protected areas – 
but, crucially, no clear targets or timelines were set. Now that both 
bodies are united to work on identifying and establishing areas, it is vital 
that they make up for lost time and set at least 40% of the Southern 
Ocean as fully-protected marine reserves. 
Greenpeace calls upon the United Nations and governments 
around the world to commit to action to save Antarctica. 
Antarctic Treaty member states must honour their commitment to 
dedicate the continent to ‘peace and science’ and implement their 
obligations to establish a comprehensive and representative network 
of marine reserves in the Southern Ocean. To be effective, this 
network should be of sufﬁcient scale, covering at least 40% of the 
Southern Ocean . 
Antarctic tourism has been growing at a rapid pace for well over a 
decade, with more than 40,000 tourists visiting Antarctica in the 
2007/2008 season. However, alongside the increase in shipping 
trafﬁc comes an increase in the threats to the continent. The most 
serious of these is the potential for oil spills and the release of other 
toxic chemicals into the sensitive environment if ships have accidents. 
Unfortunately ships do occasionally have accidents. The sinking of 
the tourist vessel MV Explorer in November 2007 and the grounding 
of the Ocean Nova in February 2009 are two recent examples. Ships 
routinely carry fuel and toxic substances on board that could be 
released when they sink or run aground. Polar waters are less able to 
recover from spills due to short seasons for growth and reproduction, 
harsh temperatures, and limited or at times no sunlight. 
Strict regulations need to be put in place covering all vessels 
operating in the Southern Ocean, including ﬁshing and whaling 
vessels, and Antarctic Treaty members need to develop a 
comprehensive system for regulating tourism in Antarctica. Box 6 Shipping and tourism

Solutions 
Marine reserves provide the best potential solution at both Poles. 
The profound physical changes happening at the ends of the Earth 
are a wake-up call that we ignore at our peril.  How we treat the Polar 
Oceans has major consequences for the planet as a whole. Our 
generation has a unique opportunity and responsibility to take action 
to bring us back from the brink of runaway climate change, and to 
protect some of the most fragile and essential ecosystems on Earth. 
There is a compelling body of scientiﬁc evidence that demonstrates that 
setting aside large areas of the ocean from industrial activities, such as 
ﬁshing and oil and gas extraction, provides protection for valuable 
species and habitats, maintains important ecosystem functions and 
allows degraded areas to recover. This is even more important for the 
Polar Oceans, since the Arctic and Antarctic are warming faster than 
the rest of the globe and so are under increased stress.  
Creating marine reserves in the Polar Oceans will make them both 
more resilient to the impacts of climate change and will help prevent 
further, catastrophic, climate change.  Greenpeace calls upon the United Nations and governments 
around the world to commit to the following course of action 
to save the Arctic and Antarctic: 
•Establish an immediate moratorium on industrial development in the 
area of the Arctic Ocean that has historically been covered by sea 
ice year-round. This ‘line in the ice’ is the average minimum sea ice 
extent between 1979 and 2000, the period before signiﬁcant sea 
ice loss due to climate change was recorded. 
•Create a long-term solution by agreeing a permanent, equitable and 
overarching treaty or multi-lateral agreement that protects the Arctic 
Ocean environment and ecosystems and the peoples who depend 
on them. 
•Antarctic Treaty member states must honour their commitment to 
dedicate the continent to ‘peace and science’ and implement their 
obligations to establish a comprehensive and representative 
network of marine reserves in the Southern Ocean. To be effective, 
this network should be of sufﬁcient scale, covering at least 40% of 
the Southern Ocean.
