CARVING
UP THE CONGO


DESTRUCTION BY NUMBERS
LOGGING ROADS TO CLIMATE RUIN
UP TO 25% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COMES FROMTROPICAL FOREST CLEARANCE
Up to a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions are almost exclusively linked to tropical
deforestation, often for conversion to pastureland and agricultural plantations. The figureexcludes – because the numbers simply have not been calculated on the global scale –the emissions from forest fragmentation and degradation resulting from the creation oflogging roads and other industry related infrastructure. The area of forest cleared forthese roads can be wider than some of Europe’s major motorways.
34 BILLION TONNES OF CO2
Predictions for future deforestation in Central Africa estimate that by 2050 forestclearance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will release up to 34.4 billion
tonnes of CO
2,roughly equivalent to the UK’s CO2emissions over the last sixty years.
The DRC risks losing more than 40% of its forests, with transport infrastructure suchas logging r oads being one of the major dr ivers.
50MILLION HEC TARES OF R AINFORES TS BEING CARVED UP
50 million hec tares of r ainforests in C entral Africa are controlled by logging
companies. That is an area the size of Spain currently being carved up by logging
roads and o ther infr astructure. 30% (some 15 million hectares) of this is held by
logging c ompanies in the DRC whose logging contracts were signed after a 2002
moratorium on new contracts or the renewal or extension of existing ones.
8% OF GLOBAL CARBON STORES
8% of the earth’s carbon that is stored in living forests worldwide is stored in the forests of the DRC – that is more than any other country in Africa and makes the DRC the fourthlargest forest carbon reservoir of any country in the world.
CLEARANCE FOR LOGGING INFRASTRUCTURE CAUSES 2.5 TIMES
MORE EMISSIONS THAN SELECTIVE LOGGING ITSELF
Greenpeace’s calculations, based on analysis of one 170,000 hectare logged area, suggest
that emissions from logging roads and infrastructure will be 2.5 times greater thanemis sions resulting from the selective logging itself. The emissions for the area are
estimated at an average of 10 tonnes of CO
2per hectare.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


CARVING UP THE CONGO
WHAT A CARVE UP 
–KEY FACTS ABOUT DRC
RAINFOREST DESTRUCTION
AND KEY QUESTIONS FOR 
THE WORLD BANK
PUTTING IT ALL IN PERSPECTIVE
Climate change caused by atmospheric build-
up of greenhouse gases is the greatest threat
the world faces today. Global emissions from
tropical deforestation alone contribute up to25% of total annual human-induced CO2
emissions to the atmosphere. 
Predictions for future deforestation in Central
Africa estimate that by 2050 forest clearance
in the Democr atic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) will release a total of up to 34.4 billion
tonnes of CO2,roughly equivalent to the UK’s
CO2emissions over the last sixty years. The
DRC risks losing more than 40% of its forests,with transport infrastructure such as loggingroads being one of the major drivers.
Logging roads open up the rainforest allowing
access. With access comes commercial
poaching: the r ainforests arebeing emptied of
large mammals to feed the trade in commercial
bushmeat and ivory. And once the rainforest is
opened up by logging roads, the area becomesvulnerable to clearance for agriculture. Withroad cle arancecome CO2emis sions fr om
rainforest destruction. With CO2emis sions
comes further climate instability.
Logging titles across Central Africa already
cover some 50 million hectares of rainforest,
an area the size of Spain. Logging companies
areeffectively road engineers, laying down a
skeletal grid of arterial routes through intact
rainforests. The swathes cleared through the
forest for these logging roads can be wider
than some of Europe’s major motorways. 
Extensive logging roads and other logging
infrastructure are a significant source of
emissions through fragmenting and
degrading rainforests. As global emissionsfigures only take account of deforestation,
the emis sions r esulting fr om such
fragment ation ar ecurrently overlooked. ‘Industrial timber production
has a particularly poor trackrecord in Africa. Over the pastsixty years, there is littleevidence that it has liftedrural populations out ofpoverty or contributed inother meaningful andsustainable ways to local andnational development.’

CARVING UP THE CONGO 2
More than 20 million hectares of logging titles
are in the DRC, where due to war, therainforests has largely escaped destruction
until now. This rainforest is now at risk of being
carved up into logging concessions forcompanies to gain access to a handful of
valuable timber species.  
The recent return of peace in the DRC and the
new Government provide a unique opportunity
for the international community to supportgenuine development in one of the world’s
poorest countries and to take critical action to
protect the global climate.
The World Bank’s support for development
through extractive industries, including logging,
is set to compromise the future of the DRC’s
rainforests, its people, and the global climate.
WHAT’S AT STAKE?
The Congo rainforests of Central Africa are of
global importance. They form the second
largestrainforestblock on e arth af ter the
Amazon rainforest, covering more than 1 72
million hec tares. The Congo rainforests are
critic al tothe sur vival of our closes tanimal
relatives: the bonobo, the chimpanzee and the
gorilla. Yet only 8.5% of the remaining areas of
intact rainforests in Central Africa enjoy‘protected’ status.
Rainf orests represent important carbon
reserves, and their preservation is critical tomaintaining the balance of the global climate.
Two-thirds of the Congo’s remaining intact
rainforests lie within the DRC. The DRC alone
accounts for 8% of that part of the earth’s
carbon which is s tored in living forests. This is
more than any other country in Africa, and is
the f ourth highes tnational s tore of forest
carbon in the world. More than a quarter of the
country is still covered with large areas of intact
rainforest,covering some 60 million hectares.
The Congo Basin also has a significant
influence over the regional climate.
Representing the third largest region of deepconvection on earth after the Western Pacific
and Amaz onia, the C ongo Basin af fects rainfall
patterns ov er the Nor th Atlantic.
The DR C’srainforests are critical for its
inhabitants. Of the more than 60 million
people in the DRC, about 40 million dependupon the rainforests to provide essential food,
medicine, and other non-timber products,along with energy and building materials.
WHAT IMPACT HAS THE 
WORLD BANK HAD IN THE DRC?
The World Bank suspended financial assistance
tothe DRC in the 1990s, as war broke out
over control of natural resources. ‘Corrupt 
and criminal elites’, backed by foreign
multinationals, joined in a free-for-all to gaincontrol of natural resources. While timber
production was at a virtual standstill because
of the war, about 43.5 million hectares offorest – an area larger than California and
twice the size of the United Kingdom – came
under the c ontrol of the logging industry.
The World Bank resumed lending to the DRC 
in 2001. It is now by far the largest funder ofreconstruction in the country. This puts it inunique position to influence the country’sdevelopment, for good or bad. By August
2006, the W orld Bank Gr oup had appr oved
loans, credits and grants to the DRC worth
morethan $4 billion.
HAS IT BROUGHT THE LOGGING 
INDUSTRY UNDER CONTROL AND 
SLOWED ITS EXPANSION?
In May 2002, the World Bank convinced the
transitional DR Cgovernment t osuspend the
allocation of new logging titles and the renewal
or extension of existing ones. This moratoriumfollowed a World Bank-instigated tax review of
logging contracts: 163 non-compliant
contracts covering 25.5 million hectares of
rainforest were cancelled. Most were ‘dormant’
–that is, in ar eas not being logged.
In its online Ques tions & Ans wers the W orld
Bank celebrates the ‘cancellation of non-compliant
concessions [sic]’ as ‘an unprecedented move
anywher ein the w orld’, critic al to‘slow[ing]
the expansion of logging’ and ‘free[ing] up
space for potential new protected areas in the
rainforest part of the country.’
While few new forest areas have been
protected since the 2002 moratorium, by
April 2 006members of the tr ansitional DRC
government had signed 1 07 new contracts
with logging c ompanies c overing mor ethan
15 million hectares of forest. These include
contracts approved under the guise of‘Urgent intervention against
all forms of illegal naturalresource exploitation isrequired … The Group ofExperts recommends that the existing laws of theDemocr atic R epublic o fthe
Congo, particularly the
regulations gov erning natur al
resour ces and their or derly
exploitation, be used as a
baseline for a new sanctionsregime.’

remapping ,exchange, adjus tments and
relocations of old titles, as well as out-and-
outnew alloc ations.
In a context of corruption and poor governance
in the DRC, the World Bank’s attempts to
reform the forestry sector are currently failingto control the expansion of logging. 
The W orld Bank’s latest attempt to control the
expansion of the logging industry is a so-calledlegal review of titles. 156 logging contracts
covering 21 million hectares of rainforest are
currently being assessed against compliance
with some basic legal criteria. 
Greenpeace has investigated the actions 
of mos tof the major logging c ompanies
whose contracts have been submitted to the
legal review. Our findings expose serious
lapses of gov ernanc e, a mas sivelack of
institutional capacity to control the forestry
sector, widespread illegalities and social
conflicts, as well as clashes with established
conservation initiatives. As this reportreveals, foreign companies including Danzer
group (Sif orco), ITB, the NST group (CFT,
Forabola, Sodef or,Soforma), Olam, Sicobois
and Trans-M have all had new contracts
signed af ter the M ay 2002moratorium. The
majority have therefore benefited from the
World Bank’s failure to ensure that themoratorium it nego tiated with the tr ansitional
DRC government and other forestry sector
reforms hav ebeen enforced.
Greenpeace fears that the legal review could
become an exercise in laundering illegal
contracts. Do the World Bank and the DRCGovernment have the political will to crackdown on those who hav ebenefit ed fr om
such c orruption?
Areview of the 1 56 contracts under 
review – Greenpeace’s key findings:
1 07 out of 156 contracts were signed after
the May 2002 moratorium. Only 40 of those
signed prior t othe mor atorium appear to have
paid their area tax in 2004 (tax payment being
acriterion of the legal r eview ,2004 is the only
year for which government data, however
inaccurate, is publicly available).
Nearly half of the 156 titles are in intact forest
landscapes – critical for carbon storage and
very significant for wildlife protection.
Because comprehensive maps are not publicly
available, the loc ation of 1 3contracts covering
1.7 million hec tares (an ar ea the size of
Kuwait) cannot be determined.
All the contracts are in areas inhabited by
forest-dependent communities; two-thirds

overlap areas inhabited by pygmy 
hunter-gatherers.
Athird of the contracts are inside areas 
already identified as priority landscapes forconservation. Twenty of those contracts are
located wholly or partially within the Congo
Basin Forest Partnership’s Maringa-Lopori-
Wamba landscape, critical bonobo habitat.
Athird of the contracts are located in areas
with afrormosia, a protected tree species
whose international trade is supposed to 
be strictly regulated (listed under CITESAppendix II).
Challenges f or the Legal Review
Is the contract a straight violation of the 
2002 moratorium?
Greenpeace research shows:
sCompanies, including Trans-M, seem to
have taken over areas previously occupied
by ‘non-c ompliant titles ’cancelled in April
2002. Many of these contracts are located
within int actforest landscapes. 
The implications of these findings are 
serious: such violations would mean that the
cancellation of non-compliant titles in April2002 did little more than take logging rightsfrom speculativ eowners who did no tuse them,
freeing up space for new logging operations. 
Do logging contracts comply with ‘boundaries
as defined by the contract and the
topographical map attached to said contract’? 
AsGreenpeace research shows:
sBoth NS Tgroup c ompanies and the Danzer
group (Siforco) – which between them hold
more than 5 million hectares of rainforest
–redefined many of their c ontracts and
title boundaries after the moratorium was
decreed in 2002 and in advance of the
legal review. Only through detailed
comparison of old and revised maps andboundaries can it be assessed whether the
revised boundaries include new f orest areas
and ther eforewould be illegal under theMay 2002 moratorium. Yet, such pre- and
post-moratorium maps or contracts arenot publicly available.
sITB’s current forest holdings in Equateur
Province appear to be located in areas
formerly held by cancelled non-compliant
pre-2002 contracts and are larger then
the forests controlled by ITB before the
moratorium. Final conclusive analysis is
lacking because logging title maps bothpre- and post-moratorium are not
publicly available. 
Assessment of the legality of revisions to pre-
moratorium contracts (for instance, where a
company has returned forest area to the State)
should therefore include assessment of the
original contracts and maps as well as revised
documents to ensure there are no irregularities.
Will the legal review overlook issues of
corruption and failures of governance?
Greenpe aceresearch sugges ts that is sues of
corruption require close scrutiny for companies
including CFBC (a c ompany said t ohavelinks
with the f ormer r ebel le ader Je an-Pier re
Bemba), ITB, Trans-M, Danzer group (Siforco),
NST group (Sodefor) and Olam. Issues include:
sPayments to forestry officials;
sSubc ontracting (which is illegal, but
companies may use loopholes in theForestry Code);
sHistoric payment of funds to rebel-held
administrations;
sTitles issued in wartime; and
sPolitical protection afforded to 
certain companies.
Conclusion: the World Bank has so far failed
in its objectives of controlling the
expansion of industrial logging and
improving governance of the sector. In theabsence of enforcement, the moratorium
has been a c over for behind-the-scenes
jostling f or valuable f orest holdings. ‘We are seeing today an
emerging global consensusthat we must do somethingabout climate change. If wedo so, we have a chance toput the world on a path thatnot only reduces the damageto our climate, but also allowpoor countries to keep moreof their resources rather thanpay for growing fuel bills
–apath that allows them 
to preserve their forest fortheir own benefit and theworld’s benefit.’

HAS IT RAISED MONEY FOR DEVELOPMENT
AND PROVIDED PUBLIC SERVICES TO FORESTDWELLING COMMUNITIES?
Central to the World Bank strategy in the
DRC is the concept that by collecting taxbased on the surface area of logging
companies’ forest holdings, the Government
will obtain revenue to drive development,
including improved provision of public
services for rainforest communities.
Where has the money gone?
The World Bank-imposed Forestry Code of
2002 stipulates that 40% of area tax is to beredistributed to local authorities for
development projects. Not one dollar of the
area tax that has actually been collected
between 2003 and 2006 has been
redistributed to local authorities. Further, there
is gross tax avoidance: a DRC Ministry ofFinance list from 2005 reveals that 45% of thearea tax due from logging companies for theprevious year had not been paid; tax avoidance
through timber smuggling is also a serious
issue – there are estimates that actual timber
expor tlevels are as much as seven times
higher than of ficial figur es.
Has logging improved 
thelife of local communities?
Greenpeace research shows that all 156 titles
up for legal r eview ar ein areas inhabited by
forest-dependent communities – and some
two-thirds of these are known to be inhabitedby pygmy hunter-gatherer communities. 
The Forestry Code formalises a pre-existing
process whereby a logging company
nego tiates directly with communities as to the
services it will provide in exchange for logging
in their ar ea.
Greenpeace’s investigations show that in
exchange f or extracting wood worth many
hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies
may give communities gifts worth as little as
$1 00 in total. Once logging starts, the
provision of services negotiated for by thecommunity, such as school buildings, is often
either derisor yor no tdeliv ered at all.For example:
sSodefor’s (an NST group company) gift
package often comprises of two sacks ofsalt,18bars of soap ,four pack ets of
coffee, 24 bottles of beer and two bags of
sugar, in exchange for rainforest access. Asaresult the communities effectively sign
away their right to protest against the
company’s activities.
Greenpe ace’s investigations show how logging
can impact local community access to vital
forestresources. 
For example:
sITB has a built a log whar fin an impor tant
fish breeding ground. 
sLogging companies frequently log
community caterpillar trees. Caterpillarsare a vital source of protein for forest
dependent c ommunities. ITB and T rans-M
aretwocases.

CARVING UP THE CONGO 6
Greenpeace has also found that the
negotiation process itself often reinforces the marginalisation of pygmy hunter-
gatherer communities who are highly
dependent on forest resources. 
sIn ITB’s operations near Lake Tumba, a 
Twa pygmy community was initially
excluded from negotiations over access to
forest. The company then made the
community a take-it-or-leave-it offer towhich the local chief felt he had no option
but to agree.
In addition, Greenpeace has identified a
number of examples of the DRC’s authorities
using violenc eto repress public dissent where
logging companies have failed to fulfil their
commitments to local communities. 
sProtests by local people against CFBC,
Safbois, Sodefor and many othercompany operations have been met with
intimidation and arbitr aryarrests by loc al
authorities. Conflicts between villagers
and logging c ompanies ar ealmos t
universal, with loc al authorities of ten
taking the side of the companies.
Conclusion: the World Bank maintains the
illusion that logging companies will belargely beneficial t olocal communities
through their tax revenue and so-called
social responsibility contracts.
HAS IT ACHIEVED RAINFOREST 
PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE, WILDLIFE 
AND THE GL OBAL ENVIR ONMENT?
Greenpeace research shows that of the 156
titles up f or legal r eview ,nearly half are in
intact forest landscapes – the very landscapes
that are most critical for carbon storage for
the sak eof the global climat e, and of gr eat
significance for the DRC’s rich biodiversity.
While in some cases beyond the remit of the
legal review, many operations are in areasthat have already been identified as priority
conser vation landscapes. Logging is going
ahead in these ar eas prior t oany land use
planning to determine how best to conserve
and manage these critic al habit ats.
sCompanies such as Trans-M and the
Danzer group (Siforco) have contracts for areas inside Maringa-Lopori-Wamba
landscape, now a critical stronghold forsome of the last viable populations of wild
bonobos in the DRC. Bonobo populations
have been decimated by the illegal tradein bushmeat, and from being hunted as a
source of food during the recent wars. 
sTrans-M, whose contracts were signed
after the 2002 moratorium, and Safbois, a
company in conflict with localcommunities over its operations, are
logging in an uncontrolled manner large
volumes of afrormosia – a protected treespecies listed under Appendix II of CITES,
meaning that its international trade is
supposed t obe regulated. 
Greenpeace’s research exposes just what a
threat the selective logging practised acrossCentral Africa is to biodiversity and the globalenvironment. Selective logging requires anextensive road network. The impact of
logging infr astructureon the climat eis
significant but does not figure in global
calculations. Giv en that cr oss Central Africa,
50million hec tares of r ainforest are
controlled by logging companies – an area
the size of Spain – the total impact is likely to
be significant. Forty million hectares arelocated in areas of intact forests.
sUsing sat ellite images, Google Earth and
published scientific studies, Greenpeacehas calculated the predicted CO2
emissions from a 1 70,000 hectare area 
offorest formerly logged by the Danzer
group (Siforco). Our calculations show that
logging r oads and o ther infrastructure
(currently not part of international IPCC
calculations on ‘Land Use Change and
Forestry Emissions’) produce a level ofemissions 3.5 times greater than that
from the e xtraction of the c ommer cial
timber itself (currently the only aspect of
industrial logging operations included in
estimates of the DRC’s emissions).
Conclusion: There is still an opportunity to
protect large areas of intact rainforest, but
action mus tbe taken swiftly. A moratorium
on any new logging title allocation needs to
be enf orced until ther eis compr ehensive
national land use planning that prioritises
the needs of the DRC’s people and the
local, regional and global environment.

The legal r eview is a crunch point f or the
