Greenfreeze: from a snowball to an industrial avalanche
The cool story of the phase-out of CFC and HFC in refrigeration

The 1997 UNEP Ozone Award-winning Greenfreeze technology is the most environmentally sustainable domestic
refrigeration technology currently available. Developed by Greenpeace in 1992, Greenfreeze is now cost effective,
technologically mature and commercially accepted in most major markets. There are nearly 150 million Greenfreeze
refrigerators in the world today. Greenfreeze technology is produced by the largest appliance manufacturers in west -
ern Europe, China, Japan and India. Greenfreeze is also produced in Australia, Argentina and Cuba. It is only artifi-
cially created obstacles that have prevented the introduction of Greenfreeze on the North American market.

Until the early1990s, virtually all domestic refrigerators were manufactured with ozone-depleting CFC-11 in the
insulation, and using CFC-12 as the refrigerant. In 1990, the combined total of CFC-11 and CFC-12 used in domes-
tic refrigerators was approximately 40,000 metric tons. The extensive use of CFCs was identified as one of the pri-
mary causes of the depletion of the ozone layer. As a result, under the Montreal Protocol to Control Ozone Deplet -
ing Substances, governments agreed to an international phase-out schedule for CFCs, and on the need to replace
CFCs with new technologies.

Chemical companies and their corporate clients in the appliance manufacturing sector turned to HCFCs and HFCs as
the replacement substances for CFCs. These substances are not sustainable: HCFCs are also ozone depleting, and
both HCFCs and HFCs are potent global warming gases. HCFCs are scheduled to be phased out, like their predeces-
sors, under the Montreal Protocol. HFCs are included in the Kyoto Protocol's basket of greenhouse gases, whose
combined emissions must be reduced in order to protect the global climate.

A short history of Greenfreeze:

1992
To prevent these harmful CFC-substitutes becoming
entrenched in the global market, Greenpeace set out
to develop an alternative refrigeration technology.
Applying the precautionary principle, the organis a-
tion became convinced that the future of environ-
mentally safer refrigeration was with natural sub-
stances, such as hydrocarbons, CO2, ammonia, water
and air.

Greenpeace found an industrial partner in the East
German-based company FORON. FORON built the
first ten Greenfreeze prototypes. Greenfreeze refrig-
erators are entirely free of fluorocarbons, CFCs/
HCFCs or HFCs, in both the refrigerant cycle and the
insulation. Instead, Greenfreeze uses isobutane for
the refrigerant and cyclopentane for blowing the
insulation foam.

Within three weeks, Greenpeace amassed 70,000
sales contracts from the German public and proved to
the manufacturers that there was a demand for envi-
ronmentally safe refrigerators.

1993
On 15 March, the first Greenfreeze refrigerators
rolled off the FORON assembly lines. Within a year,
the technology spread throughout Germany and to
other European countries.

The same year, Greenpeace introduced Greenfreeze
technology to China and Japan.

1994
Greenpeace cooperated with China‘s largest fridge-
producer, Kelon, in the production of Greenfreeze
refrigerators. Greenpeace also facilitated cooperation
between Western appliance manufacturers and Chi-
nese refrigerator makers.

Swiss and German government agencies began to
promote hydrocarbon refrigeration technology in
India and Pakistan.

1995
Greenfreeze technology receives further attention
from Chinese companies and Greenfreeze is pro-
duced in Australia.

project is ongoing, with prototypes currently being
field-tested in Senegal, Indonesia and Cuba.

2002
Following several years of public campaigning by
Greenpeace, the largest Japanese refrigerator manu-
facturers began to produce and market Greenfreeze
refrigerators for the Japanese market.

2003
By the tenth anniversary of the first commercialised
production of Greenfreeze, over 100 million Green-
freeze refrigerators had been produced worldwide.
The first Greenfreeze refrigerators in South America
are produced in Argentina and Brazil.

2004
Commitment of three world-leading companies to
phase out HFCs and commercially introduce alterna-
tive technologies such as Greenfreeze “in the immi-
nent future".

Demands:

The Parties of the Montreal Protocol must

Governments must tax the use of HFCs

•
Governments must phase out HFCs imme-
diately. For the few exceptions, for which no imme-
diate substitutes exist, specific dates for their phase-
out must be fixed. None of the time frames ought to
exceed five years.
•
until phase-out. This tax is based on the global
warming potential and, consequently, on the envi-
ronmental impact of these applications.
•
stop the funding HFC projects through the Multilat-
eral Fund and dramatically accelerate the phase-out
of HCFCs.
•
satory fund into which HFC-producers must pay.
This fund would compensate for environmental and
human health costs arising from the extensive use of
HFCs.
•
mediate phase-out dates for HFCs in all applica-
tions in its proposed Fluorinated Gases Regulation.

1996
The second phase of the Greenfreeze initiative aimed
to convince large commercial users of refrigeration
and air-conditioning equipment to shift away from
fluorocarbons. The campaign initially focused on
European supermarkets. A number responded to the
Greenpeace campaign by deciding to shift from
fluorocarbon refrigeration and cooling to "natural
refrigerants" such as hydrocarbons and ammonia.

1997
The two biggest Chinese refrigerator producers, Ke-
lon (in southern China) and Haier (in northern
China), start producing Greenfreeze refrigerators. On
the tenth anniversary of the Montreal Protocol,
Greenfreeze was awarded the UNEP Ozone Award.

1998
In 1998, the campaign turned its attention to the ma-
jor corporate sponsors of the 2000 Sydney Olympics
– giant food and beverage companies such as Coca-
Cola, McDonald's and Unilever Ice Cream, whose
daily operations use millions of refrigeration units
worldwide.

2000
The campaign escalated in 2000 as the opening date
of the Sydney Olympics approached. Greenpeace
took various initiatives to convince the corporate
sponsors of the Games to adhere to the "Environ-
mental Guidelines" issued by the Olympic Commit-
tee.

June 28: Coca-Cola announced plans for a global
phase-out of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in refrig-
eration by the Athens Olympic Games in 2004. Coca-
Cola also announced its intention to expand research
into refrigeration alternatives. The Coca-Cola an-
nouncement was soon followed by similar commit -
ments from McDonald's and Unilever Ice Cream.

2001
Greenpeace, together with five other international
organisations (UNEP, WHO, UNICEF, GTZ, DTI)
began a project to develop a solar refrigerator and
vaccine cooler that is environmentally friendly and
bypasses the use of batteries (“SolarChill"). The
