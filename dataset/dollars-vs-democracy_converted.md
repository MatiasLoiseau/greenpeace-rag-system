Introduction and Key Findings

A healthy democracy is a precondition for a healthy environment . When everyone’s vote counts

and when everyone’s constitutionally-guaranteed right to peacefully protest is protected, our

government becomes more accountable and capable of meeting the demand for racial justice

and enacting solutions to the rapidly accelerating climate crisis .

Congress is currently presented with the opportunity to pass
two bills that would restore, strengthen, and protect our
freedom to vote, make sure average people have a better
chance of being heard by preventing billionaires from buying
our elections, and ensure we can elect leaders who govern in
our interests: The For The People Act (H.R. 1/S. 1) and The
John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4).

Yet today, conservative state lawmakers across the country
are attempting to block the path to progress by forcing
through legislation designed to criminalize and squash
public protests and disenfranchise voters — especially
voters of color .

Unhappy with the outcome of the 2020 election and following
the record-breaking turnout among Black voters in the Senate
runoff election in Georgia, extremist state lawmakers first
began to introduce a barrage of anti-voter laws in Georgia
and a few other states . But soon these bills spread across the
country . As of late March, according to the Brennan Center for
Justice, at least 361 anti-voter bills had been introduced in
47 states .1

At the same time, extremist lawmakers are also busy drafting
anti-protest bills with new draconian provisions designed to
criminalize and stifle protests. Over 80 anti-protest bills have
been introduced in 34 states so far this year — more than
twice the number in any previous year .2

The introduction of these anti-protest bills started to
accelerate noticeably in 2017 . The legislation came in
response to protests led by the Black Lives Matter movement
and the resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline led by
Indigenous land and water protectors from the Standing Rock
Reservation .3

It’s no surprise that these anti-protest bills are designed
primarily against these two movements since the struggles for
climate justice and racial justice go hand-in-hand; both are led
by communities of color that have borne a disproportionate
share of corporate harm and police brutality .

Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities began organizing
the movement for environmental justice decades ago, having
been most heavily impacted by pollution and illnesses
associated with fossil fuel extraction and use, petrochemical
production, and waste disposal operations .4 Many Black,
Brown, and Indigenous communities are now also on the
front lines of the climate crisis, trying to survive extreme
weather events and other impacts that will soon affect
everyone .5

Given these realities, it’s no surprise that opinion polls have
repeatedly found that Latinx and Black communities are more
likely to be alarmed and concerned about global warming
than white people, who are more likely to be doubtful or
dismissive .6

This year, demands for racial justice and climate justice have
also begun to expose the relationship between polluters
opposed to government action on climate change and the
recent racist attacks on democracy .

After white supremacists stormed the Capitol during the
failed insurrection of January 6th, it was revealed that fossil
fuel companies and other corporations and conservative
groups contributed to groups that helped organize and
promote the “Stop the Steal” rallies that led to the siege of
the Capitol .7 Later on January 6, when Congress reconvened,
the “insurrection caucus” that refused to certify the 2020
election results was led by many members who have taken
exorbitant amounts of money from the fossil fuel industry .8
According to a recent analysis by the Center for American
Progress, 82 members of the U .S . House of Representatives
and six U .S . Senators are both climate deniers and members
of the “insurrection caucus” — those who denied the certified
results of the 2020 general election, supporting President
Trump’s attempt to overturn the election .9 Many of these
same politicians have also spent years undermining voting
rights and campaign finance reform, opening the doors to
the plutocrats who have polluted our politics as much as they
have contaminated our air, water, and land .10

Republican politicians in Georgia, Texas, Arizona and other
states began introducing legislation directly designed
to quash the election rules and policies that led to an
unprecedented voter turnout .

Soon national attention was drawn towards Georgia, where
state legislators passed a new law signed by Governor Kemp,
which includes provisions that will have the effect of making
it more difficult for many voters to participate in upcoming
elections, particularly Black voters and others that turned
out in unprecedented numbers during the January Senate
runoff races.

Voting rights groups including the New Georgia Project, Fair
Fight, Black Voters Matter, and the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People immediately began
to respond, organizing legal challenges and calling out
the companies that supported the sponsors of these bills,
including Coca-Cola, Delta, Home Depot and Aflac.11

As other state 2021 legislative sessions began, Greenpeace
investigated corporate contributions to other state anti-voter
bills along with new and expanded anti-protest legislation .
The results of that research are discussed below, and
presented in the appendices to this brief report .12

Here are the key findings:

Dozens of state legislators are driving a two-
pronged attack on democracy, sponsoring both
anti-voter and anti-protest bills.

44 state legislators sponsored at least one anti-protest bill
and one anti-voter bill in the past year .13

Many companies back state legislators who
sponsored both anti-voter and anti-protest bills.

Of the top 100 corporate donors to state lawmakers who
sponsored anti-voter bills, 53 were also among the 100
top corporate donors to anti-protest bill sponsors .

Five of 10 companies that donated the most to sponsors
of state anti-voter legislation — AT&T, Comcast, RAI
Services, Phillip Morris/Altria and UnitedHealth Group
— also rank among the top 10 corporate donors to the
sponsors of state anti-protest bills .

DOLLARS VS.  DEMOCRACY   |  2

The ten companies that contributed the most to state
lawmakers sponsoring both anti-voter and anti-protest
bills are14:

AT&T
Dominion Energy
Zurich North America + subsidiaries
Berkshire Hathaway + subsidiaries
UnitedHealth Group
Mednax Services
Charter Communications
State Farm Insurance + subsidiaries
Philip Morris USA
Vistra Energy (FKA Energy Future Holdings) +
subsidiaries

Fossil Fuel companies stand out among companies
backing anti-protest legislation.

The 10 companies that invested the most in lobbying for
anti-protest bills since 2017 are all fossil fuel companies .

A growing number of companies have spoken out in
defense of democracy and voting rights. Yet many
of these same companies contributed to legislators
sponsoring state anti-voter or anti-protest bills
during their most recent election campaigns.

On April 14, well over 100 companies endorsed “We Stand
for Democracy,” a statement of clear opposition to “any
discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or
prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair
opportunity to cast a ballot .”15 We commend them for
doing so .

Unfortunately, this was after at least 12 of these
companies contributed to the sponsors of 43 state anti-
voter bills analyzed: Amazon, American Express, Bank
of America, Facebook, Ford, General Motors, HP, J&J,

Global Climate Strike in San Francisco © George Nikitin / Greenpeace

Merck, Microsoft, United Airlines, and Wells Fargo.16 We
urge these and other companies to adopt the policy
of immediately ceasing any support to politicians that
sponsor or vote for state anti-voter legislation .

Companies that ceased PAC contributions to
members of Congress who refused to certify the
2020 election contributed to groups that promoted
the “Stop the Steal” rally. Many are also sponsors
of state anti-voter legislation introduced after
January 6.

In the wake of the insurrection, at least 130 companies
“paused” PAC contributions to members of the
“insurrection caucus .” Some halted such contributions
altogether .17 During the last election cycle at least 47 of
these companies contributed to sponsors of state anti-
voter legislation introduced after January 6.18

Of the top 100 corporate donors to sponsors of anti-
protest bills 36 donated to the Republican Attorneys
General Association (RAGA). RAGA’s affiliate — the Rule
of Law Defense Fund — sent robocalls to promote the
January 6 march to the Capitol .19

Eight companies (including five oil & gas companies)
that support RAGA have lobbied for anti-protest bills in at
least 2 states .20

Many companies are also caught in a “chamber of
contradictions” because of actions taken by trade
associations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The U .S . Chamber of Commerce opposes the For The
People Act (H .R . 1/ S . 1), despite the fact that many
individual member companies oppose state anti-voter
legislation .21 Executives from six companies that have
spoken out against state anti-voter legislation — IBM,
Boston Consulting Group, United Airlines, Microsoft,
Deloitte and Ford — currently serve on the Chamber’s
board of directors, its principal policy-making body .22

At least six state and regional affiliates of the U.S.
Chamber have also lobbied in favor of anti-protest laws .23

The whole world is watching the unfolding test of America’s
continuing experiment with democracy . Corporate support for
legislators and organizations who sponsor and vote for anti-
voter and anti-protest bills poses a serious threat to America’s
standing in the world, including our ability to negotiate to
defend the climate and environmental boundaries that
science and justice demand of us all .

Dollars to Attack Our Vote

No matter our race, background or zip code most of us believe that for democracy to work for

all of us, it must include us all . Throughout our history, Americans have fought to expand voting

rights so that all voters are able to cast their ballot and have it counted .

Speak Your Mind and Cast Your Vote

Voter registration shot up in June amid nationwide protests
over the killing of George Floyd, according to a new analysis .
“Despite a full or partial lockdown in large swaths of the country
for much of the month, voter registration began to rebound
as people took to the streets to protest,” analysis conducted
by TargetSmart, a Democratic political data firm found.24

Some of the surge in voter registration during June was most
likely attributable to efforts by protest organizers to motivate
large numbers of protesters to register and vote in the
coming election, using creative means such as posting QR
codes on protest signs that allowed protesters to scan the
code and begin the registration process on their phones .25

Voting also gives people a key means of peacefully preserving
and strengthening other rights, including the right to healthy
air and clean water .

As Michael Latner of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Center
for Science and Democracy has said: “Healthy communities
require healthy democracy . When communities are disenfran-
chised or underrepresented, it becomes harder for them to
use democratic institutions effectively to solve their problems
and advocate for their interests .… This is the predicament
faced by many environmental justice (EJ) communities—com-
munities of color and low-income communities exposed to
disproportionately high levels of toxic pollution and other
environmental burdens .… [R]estrictive election laws, gerryman-
dering, and other factors combine to further reduce already
low voter turnout in these communities, weakening their
ability to protect themselves against environmental hazards .”26

The new wave of state anti-voting bills that followed the
conservative claims of 2020 election fraud gained national
media attention when Georgia Gov . Brian Kemp signed S .B .
202, a new law infamous for making it a crime to hand out
water or food to voters standing in line, among other anti-
voter provisions .27 Attention to this anti-voter bill can be
attributed to the response organized by civil and voting rights
groups, including the New Georgia Project, Fair Fight, Black
Voters Matter, and the NAACP .

These groups demanded Georgia-based companies like Coca-
Cola, Delta, Home Depot and others that “helped fund the
very authors of this regressive voting rights legislation” use
their lobbying clout to oppose it .28 Yet the companies were
slow to respond, publicly criticizing the legislation only after
the bill was signed into law .29

Georgia is just one of many states where lawmakers are
pushing to limit voting . By late March, at least 361 bills making
voting more difficult for millions of people — especially Black
and Brown voters — had been introduced in 47 states .30

What These Bills Do

	| Prohibit automatic voter registration or severely limiting or

prohibiting same-day voter registration .31

	| Repeal universal voting by mail and other safety provisions
(e .g . drop boxes) enacted in 2020 to make participation
safer during the Covid-19 pandemic .32

	| Bar people from voting by mail unless they provide an

excuse .33

	| Restrict types of IDs you can use to vote and when you can

apply for vote-by-mail ballots .34

	| Threaten voters who request an absentee ballot with prose-

cution if they cannot prove an excuse such as illness, active
military status, or will be out-of-state at the time of election .

	| Prohibit city or township clerks from providing prepaid

return postage for absentee voter ballots .35

	| Reduce the number of ballot drop box locations and times;
limit early in-person voting and allow election officials
to reduce the number of voting locations by raising the
number of voters within a specific precinct.36

	| Delete people from voter rolls if they miss voting in recent
elections, or require voters to re-register every three years
or be removed from the registration list;37

	| Shift election authority for partisan gain from local and
county officials to the Secretary of State or vice versa.38

	| Change the rules relating to voter registration drives in

ways that may make compliance more difficult.39

In many instances these restrictions disproportionately
impact Black and Brown communities, younger and elderly
voters, and poor communities — a growing portion of the
voting population, and one that tends to be more progressive
than average .40

As conservative lawmakers in other states followed
Georgia’s lead, some in the business community began
responding to the outcry against Georgia-based companies
by speaking out against what they saw as a racist and
partisan attack on democracy .

Georgia’s hastily enacted law has racist and partisan
impacts that are features, not bugs, of the many similar bills
moving through other statehouses . The original Georgia bill
would have prevented voting on Sundays, a provision that
was clearly targeted at Black communities, where church
congregations have mobilized large numbers of people to
join in “souls to the polls” caravans organized after church
services .41 Although that provision was removed before the
bill was signed into law, another infamous provision remains
that makes it a crime to provide food or water to voters
standing in line. This provision disproportionately affects
communities of color, where voters waiting to cast their votes
commonly experience long lines .

On March 31, business leaders from the Black Economic
Alliance proclaimed that “[t]he disproportionate racial impact
of these allegedly ‘neutral laws’ should neither be overlooked
nor excused .…The stakes for our democracy are too high to
remain on the sidelines . Corporate America must support our
nation’s fundamental democratic principles and marshal its
collective influence to ensure fairness and equity for all….
Corporate America should publicly oppose any discriminatory
legislation and all measures designed to limit Americans’
ability to vote . When it comes to protecting the rights of all
Americans to vote, there can be no middle ground . We call
upon our colleagues in Corporate America to join us in
taking a non-partisan stand for equality and democracy .
Each of us stands ready to work with you on what can and

must be done .”42 Following their lead, more corporate leaders
and companies began speaking out against the bills .43
On April 2, 2021, well over 200 top American business
executives released a statement in support of protecting
voting rights .44 Two weeks later, on April 14, over 500
companies and CEOs signed a statement published in the
New York Times and Washington Post, expressing their
opposition to “the 360+ state bills pending in 47 states that
contain discriminatory voting measures .”45

These statements by the corporate community are a welcome
development, but they are not enough .

For one, companies committed to voting rights should stop
contributing to any politician who authors, sponsors, or
votes for anti-voter legislation . At least a dozen companies
that endorsed the April 14 statement made campaign contri-
butions to the sponsors of 2021 state anti-voter bills during
the 2019-2020 election cycle: Amazon, American Express,
Bank of America, Facebook, Ford, General Motors, HP, Johnson &
Johnson, Merck, Microsoft, United Airlines, and Wells Fargo.46

When the outcry against anti-voter bills began to be directed
at companies that helped legislators who sponsored the bills
get elected, Greenpeace started digging into the companies
that contributed to anti-voter bills sponsors during the most
recent election cycle .47

The 10 companies that made the largest combined campaign
contributions to sponsors of the state anti-voter bills
examined are as follows48:

As corporate leaders increasingly understand, their
employees, shareholders and other stakeholders expect
companies to step up when political leaders fail to do so .
A 2020 poll of over 2,000 US adults conducted by JUST
Capital found that 3 in 4 Americans believe that large
companies “have a role to play in preserving and protecting
democracy .”49

And many companies have, to some degree, begun to do so,
however haltingly: After January 6, well over 140 companies
recognized the importance of aligning their campaign
contributions with their commitment to democratic norms
and rights, by suspending (at least temporarily) any campaign
contributions to members of Congress who refused to certify
the results of the 2020 election .50

Of the 100 companies that contributed the most to state
lawmakers who sponsored anti-voter legislation this year, at
least 32 suspended contributions to members of Congress
after the January 6 insurrection.51 Of the more than 130
companies identified that suspended contributions to
members of Congress who refused to certify the 2020
election results, 47 contributed to state lawmakers who have
introduced anti-voter legislation in 2021 .52

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce: The Corporate Club Beating Down Our Freedom to Vote

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, along with its state and local affiliates, allows companies to align around a common
agenda, including on taxation, energy policy, and regulations on corporate participation in elections . As the most powerful
and unifying voice of the business community, the Chamber also allows its member companies to avoid being directly
associated with positions that might otherwise create significant reputational risks or undermine the interests of companies’
own employees, shareholders, or customers .

The Chamber is currently not required by campaign finance law to disclose who their members are or how much funding
each company gives them for specific political purposes such as making contributions to specific candidates. The Chamber
is allowed to withhold this information even though its political expenditures can be significant.53 In the 2020 election cycle,
the Chamber reported making $903,063 in political contributions .54

More than anything else, however, the Chamber’s strength is in its investment in federal lobbying, which built its reputation
as the country’s most powerful “influence machine.”55 In 2020 alone, the Chamber spent nearly $82 million on lobbying the
federal government, more than any other group .56

Blocking the For the People Act has been one of the Chamber’s top priorities since it was first introduced in 2019.57 The
Chamber recently warned members of Congress that supporting the most comprehensive democracy reform bill in a
generation could adversely affect their standing on its annual ratings scorecard.58

The Chamber professes to be “deeply troubled by efforts at the state and federal level to enact election law changes on a
partisan basis,” which it acknowledges are “more likely to erode access and security and undermine public confidence and
the willingness of the American people to trust and accept future election outcomes .” But instead of supporting national
voter protection standards contained in H .R . 1 and H .R . 4, the Chamber has proposed a bipartisan commission on election
reform, an obvious attempt to kill the bill and delay reforms until beyond the 2022 election .

The Chamber also misrepresents specific provisions in the For The People Act that it claims are grounds for its rejection. It
characterizes disclosure requirements for contributions of $10,000 or more by single donors to independent organizations
as “severe … penalties .”59 But eliminating “dark money” contributions doesn’t stop anyone from making those
contributions — it just forces them to be disclosed . This is the exact kind of increased transparency that Koch operatives
have privately conceded are highly popular with people across the political spectrum, including a “large, very large, chunk
of conservatives .”60

Another of the Chamber’s arguments against the bill is that it uses “taxpayer” funds to match small-donor contributions .61
In truth, the matching funds would come from fees taken from civil and criminal financial penalties paid by companies that
commit tax crimes and other violations .62

Despite a growing chorus of corporate opposition to state legislative attacks on voting rights, so far there is no evidence
that members of the Chamber have petitioned it to change the group’s position on H .R . 1 .63 Nor is there any evidence that
they have threatened to quit if it doesn’t, as some companies did before the Chamber began to shift its position on climate
change .64

The Chamber’s Board of Directors, its “principal governing and policymaking body,” bears a particular responsibility to
support voting rights and change the Chamber’s position on the For the People Act .65 Members of the board that endorsed
the “We Stand for Democracy” statement released on April 14 include Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte & Touche, Ford,
IBM, Microsoft and United Airlines. Other high-profile Chamber members that have endorsed the statement include
Accenture, American Airlines, American Express, Bank of America, BlackRock, Estee Lauder, Facebook, Goldman Sachs,
Salesforce, Synchrony, Target and ViacomCBS .66

Dollars to Silence Protest

“Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for rights.”

— Martin Luther King, Jr ., April 3, 1968

Joseph Lowery, and John Lewis lead the march. © Bettmann / Contributor

The great movements of the past century — the Civil Rights
movement, the labor movement, the women’s suffrage
movement, the environmental movement — have all relied on
peaceful protest to confront injustices and win wider public
support . Greenpeace was itself founded 50 years ago by a small
group of activists committed to using nonviolent direct action
to stop nuclear weapons testing . Almost every day in America
people come together peacefully to demonstrate and raise
their voices about clean air and water, local land use, and other
issues they believe in because peaceful protest works . Without
the right to speak up, we wouldn’t have made significant gains
towards equal rights for women and people of color, fair wages
and working hours, or clean air and water .

In 2020, an unprecedented number of Americans joined the
Movement for Black Lives to protest racist policing and force

the country to begin to reckon with its long legacy of injustice
and structural racism . At the same time, Indigenous defenders
of sovereign land and water rights, climate activists, poor
communities, and property-owners continue to resist the fossil
fuel industry’s push to expand .

Today’s movements are facing responses similar to those
encountered by historic movements, including the introduction
of laws and policies designed to silence leaders and undermine
public support for their cause .67

Between May 2020 and January 2021, when massive protests
against racialized police violence swept the country, three
federal bills and 21 state bills “aimed at suppressing Black
Lives Matter protesters” were introduced, according to the
International Center for Not-For-Profit Law.68

DOLLARS VS.  DEMOCRACY   |  8

This was not the first time such legislation appeared.
A similar wave of anti-protest bills occurred in 2017,
largely in response to recent Black Lives Matter protests
and Indigenous-led protests against construction of
the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) at the Standing Rock
Reservation in North Dakota . In response to the DAPL
protests, lawmakers introduced so-called “critical
infrastructure” legislation designed to criminalize common
movement tactics. Soon after, similar bills were introduced
in other states, with support from fossil fuel lobbyists,
industry trade associations, and the American Legislative
Exchange Council (ALEC) .69

The 2020 surge in anti-protest legislation began after the
death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police
and the Black Lives Matter protests that followed .70 In just
the first four months of 2021, dozens of bills have been
introduced to restrict lawful assembly and speech, bringing
the total number of state anti-protest bills to at least 94 since
May 2020 .71

Assertions that last year’s Black Lives Matter protests justify
the new anti-protest legislation fall apart when the facts
are taken into consideration: A Washington Post analysis of
thousands of BLM protests that took place across the nation
last May and June found that 96 .3 involved no property
damage or police injuries, and in 97 .7 percent of events no
injuries were reported among participants, bystanders or
police. “These figures should correct the narrative that the
protests were overtaken by rioting and vandalism or violence,”
the Post’s analysts concluded .72

After January 6th, when white supremacists attacked the U.S.
Capitol with the intention of stopping the peaceful transition
of power, some state and federal lawmakers began pressing
for new legal powers to prosecute domestic violent extremist
groups .73 Yet critics warn that laws already exist for the crimes
committed on January 6th, and that historical precedents
suggest caution is required since those new legal powers
could be used not just against white supremacist groups
but also against Black and Brown communities already
disproportionately targeted by law enforcement .

What These Bills Do

The provisions in many anti-protest bills are intended to
penalize, marginalize and weaken protest movements in
multiple ways . They would:

ESTABLISH HARSH AND REDUNDANT PENALTIES
FOR PROTEST AND GIVE POLICE AND PROSECUTORS
ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.

Some bills expand the definition of what constitutes a “riot” or
“unlawful assembly,” thereby giving law enforcement expanded
authority to arrest and prosecute peaceful protesters .74

In Indiana, H.B.1205 would expand the definition of “unlawful
assembly,” requiring that only three people be engaged in
“tumultuous conduct,” defined as conduct that results in
the “obstruction of law enforcement or other government
function.” But “obstruction” is not defined in the bill, leaving it
open to interpretation .75 According to the International Center
for Not-For-Profit Law, “As a result of these changes, someone
in a 3-person, peaceful protest whose conduct is deemed
“likely” to interfere with a government hearing, for instance,
could be covered by the resulting “riot” statute” and charged
with a misdemeanor carrying a mandatory 30-day sentence .76

Most anti-protest bills include new or expanded sentencing
and/or fines for peaceful, nonviolent activity that is already
illegal, such as trespass, property damage or obstructing
traffic.77 Some reclassify misdemeanors, such as trespass,
as felonies .78

One aspect of this legislative trend has been to treat
alleged criminal law violations as akin to “terrorism,” a
linguistic smear used to justify cross-agency and federal
law enforcement involvement in what would otherwise
be state or local level prosecutions . Reports that federal,
state, and local law enforcement have collaborated across
jurisdictions against pipeline opponents, often describing
activists as “domestic terrorists,” and coordinating and
sharing information (sometimes with private security
companies working for the industry) through “fusion
centers” that were created after the 9/11 attacks to help law
enforcement collaborate against terrorist threats across
jurisdictions should concern anyone familiar with the history
of government activities intended to discredit and disrupt
previous movements .79

One egregious example of this new wave of anti-protest laws
was signed into law by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on April
19, 2021 . DeSantis initially proposed the bill in September
2020, in response to statewide protests for racial justice, to
immediate criticism by civil liberties groups and even a few
law enforcement officials.80 The law carries a sentence of up
to five years for peaceful protests, and could strip activists of
their voting rights even if they didn’t engage in any violent or
disorderly conduct . It also carries a threat of up to 15 years in
prison for even temporarily blocking traffic in a group of 25 or
more persons .81

Nancy Metayer, a prominent figure in South Florida’s
2020 summer protests and the first Haitian American City
Commissioner in Coral Springs history, denounced the law
as an “unequivocally unAmerican . . .assault on Florida’s
Black and Brown families .” Metayer said it should be clearly
seen and contextualized as a response to the millions of
people in the state’s most marginalized communities who
answered the moral call to combat systemic discrimination .82
Opponents are challenging the law as unconstitutional .83
Soon after DeSantis enacted the new law, the Broward County
Sheriff’s Office directed its precinct captains to not enforce
it without running the decision up the chain of command,
explaining that it threatened to diminish its ability to connect
with the community .84

A few weeks later, the Montana legislature passed a bill Gov .
Greg Gianforte is expected to sign, that some describe as one
of the most extreme anti-protest bills yet . The bill seeks to
penalize trespassing with intent to impede operations with
a sentence of up to eighteen months in prison . The bill also
includes financial penalties for organizations convicted of
“conspiracy” for supporting protesters .85

Many bills not only expand law enforcement’s ability to stifle
speech and stop dissent, they often include incentives to do
so . Indiana H .B . 1205, for example, allows businesses to sue
governments for failing to enforce the law against unlawful
assembly if the failure constitutes “gross negligence,” a
measure would encourage local governments to adopt
overly aggressive responses to protests in order to avoid
being sued .86

Another Indiana bill, S .B . 198, gives the state’s Attorney
General concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute any “criminal
offense” committed by members of an “unlawful assembly,”
allowing them to step in and charge protesters if local
prosecutors decline to do so .87 Other bills create new
penalties for government officials who try to “stand down”
police (North Carolina H.B. 321), undermining local officials’
ability to participate in decisions over policing of protests and
potentially incentivizing aggressive police responses .88

TARGET COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

Anti-protest bills are a direct response to Black Lives Matter
and other BIPOC-led movements, laying bare their racist
intent . In addition, many include provisions that would
disproportionately impact poor communities, especially
communities of color, by imposing massive fines and/or
making anyone convicted of specified protest-related charges,
ineligible for public assistance .

One example is Kentucky’s S .B 211, which would have barred
anyone convicted under an overbroad and vague definition of
rioting from receiving certain public benefits for up to a year,
and expose them to other penalties including mandatory
minimum prison sentences .89 If passed, this bill would have
effectively forced many Kentuckians to weigh their First
Amendment right to join a rally against their access to health
care, housing and nutrition assistance .

MARGINALIZE PROTEST MOVEMENTS AND
DISCOURAGE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

Bills that penalize bystanders who attend events where
criminal laws are allegedly broken have the intended effect of
frightening and discouraging people from attending protests .
Indiana’s S .B . 198, for example, seeks to creates a new Class B
misdemeanor offense, “enabling riot.” It applies to anyone
who knowingly witnesses the commission of a felony during

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY   |  11

an “unlawful assembly” and fails to “immediately” either
leave the location or report the offense to law enforcement.90

established for donors to any group that intends to commit
civil disobedience .92

When lawful protesters face massive fines and
disproportionately punitive criminal penalties, they may
choose to stay home instead of exercising their constitutional
right to free speech . As one scholar recently put it, “although
the state has an interest in ensuring respect for the rule of law,
the disproportionately harsh penalties…go far and above that
interest and are detrimental to democracy .”91

SANCTION AND BANKRUPT ORGANIZATIONS
THAT SUPPORT PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND
MOVEMENT BUILDING

Many anti-protest bills include “aiding and abetting” clauses
that allow any individual or organization to be charged with a
crime for providing support to peaceful protesters who break
the law .

Indiana’s S.B. 198 creates a new “financing an unlawful
assembly” Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to one
year in jail . It targets individuals who give “anything of value”
to another person knowing that they intend to commit civil
disobedience as part of an “unlawful assembly .” In addition,
felony charges with penalties of up to six years in prison are

TURN ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE REAL PROBLEM

These anti-protest laws use the cover of “public safety” to
expand law enforcement’s powers to criminalize peaceful
protest . By doing so, these bills divert attention away from
policies that would reduce police misconduct by removing
“qualified immunity” and other legal shields that protect
officers from accountability for violent and unjust actions.

Similarly, peaceful protests against oil and gas pipelines have
been deemed threats to “critical infrastructure” by a slew of
bills designed to quash those protests . These laws distort the
definition of a term originally used to safeguard communi-
ties from the risks associated with sabotage and attacks on
petrochemical plants and other industrial infrastructure . For
corporate polluters, these laws targeting peaceful protesters
help divert attention away from their own responsibility for
threats to community safety, including chemical accidents
and spills, along with the toxic pollution they spew across
nearby communities on a nearly daily basis . It also diverts
attention from operational and technological changes compa-
nies could implement to make the nation’s infrastructure and
surrounding communities inherently safer and more resilient .

SOW DIVISION AND ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE

Some anti-protest bills encourage vigilante violence by
shielding drivers from criminal and/or civil liability for
intentionally injuring or even killing protesters if they
can demonstrate that protesters were obstructing traffic
without a permit or engaged in a “riot,” a term often
loosely defined.

The protection of vigilantism — often in the name of public
safety — goes back to the days of slavery and post-Civil War
terrorist acts committed by the Ku Klux Klan and other white
supremacist groups . The deliberate vehicular homicide
committed by a neo-Nazi during the 2017 “Unite the Right”
rally in Charlottesville, Virginia is a more recent and infamous
example . But drivers have plowed into peaceful protesters
an alarming number of times since Charlottesville, and an
increasing number of anti-protest laws would shield them
from any legal consequences for doing so . From May 27
through September 5, 2020 drivers ran into demonstrators
at Black Lives Matter protests 104 times according to a
researcher at the University of Chicago’s Project on Security
and Threats . In 96 of these incidents, the drivers were
civilians; the other 8 involved police .93

Driver immunity provisions have been included in over a
dozen bills introduced in the past year . As of this writing,
two such bills - one in Florida and the other in Oklahoma -
have been enacted into law .94 These laws endanger public
safety by immunizing violence, just as the infamous
“stand your ground” laws have resulted in an increase
in firearm homicides.95

Susan Bro, whose daughter Heather Heyer was run over and
killed in Charlottesville, describes the new driver immunity
laws as the equivalent to “declaring open season . It’s a
hunting license, is what it basically is .”96

DIMINISH AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IN THE
EYES OF THE REST OF THE WORLD

International human rights observers have concluded that
the new wave of U .S . anti-protest laws also violate global
standards of democracy and civil liberties . In December, for
example, CIVICUS Monitor downgraded the United States’
standing on fundamental freedoms of association, peaceful
assembly and expression based on “concerns about restrictive
laws and excessive force used against protesters .”97

Under international law, the right of peaceful assembly is
protected by Article 21 of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which was ratified by the

United States in 1992 . In 2010, the UN Human Rights Council
created the position of Special Rapporteur on the rights
to freedom of peaceful assembly, to monitor and report
on threats to freedom of assembly throughout the world .
UN Special Rapporteur Maina Kiai conducted an official
mission to the United States in July, 2016 and reported
that America was “struggling to live up to its ideals .”98 Kiai
described rampant racism and exclusion, especially of
African-Americans, and unequal economic wealth distribution
following the 2007-08 financial crisis. These events, he
found, gave way to increased demonstrations . “There is
justifiable and palpable anger in the black community over
these injustices . It needs to be expressed,” he stressed . “This
is the context that gave birth to the non-violent Black Lives
Matter protest movement and the context in which it must be
understood .”

Fossil Fuel Companies and
Anti-Protest Bills

It’s no surprise that fossil fuel companies are among the
largest corporate contributors to sponsors of anti-protest
bills, since many of these bills directly target frontline
resistance to the industry’s expansion . Twenty-two of the top
100 companies — responsible for $1,257,974 in contributions
— are either directly or indirectly involved in producing,
transporting or distributing fossil fuels:

Five oil and gas companies:
Koch Industries (#2)
Marathon Petroleum (#21)
Chevron (#67)
Phillips 66 (#71)
ExxonMobil (#78)

The argument is often made that companies contribute to
political candidates for many reasons, and that campaign
contributions do not buy votes on specific legislation, even if
they might buy access to legislators in some cases .103 That’s
why companies spend even more money on in-house and
external lobbyists, “government affairs” consultants, think
tanks, PR firms, charitable groups, academic shills, trade
associations, and other players that comprise the powerful
networks of influence they operate in Washington and state
capitals across the country .104

An analysis of lobbying disclosure reports found that oil and
gas companies have directed by far the most resources to
lobbying for anti-protest “critical infrastructure” bills introduced
between 2017 and 2021, holding eight of the top 10 spots . The
other two are closely tied to the industry — companies that
transport and use fossil fuels for electricity generation .105

Eleven electric utilities heavily reliant on fossil fuels:

Marathon Petroleum Corp

Berkshire Hathaway100 (#4)
Duke Energy (#6)
Dominion Energy (#11)
AEP (#23)
Southern Company (#24)
Pinnacle West/Arizona Public Service (#33)
NextEra101 (#38)
FirstEnergy (#52)

The Fossil Fuel Industry
Lobbying Offensive

Greenpeace also investigated corporate lobbying for
anti-protest bills aimed specifically at restraining activists
that stand in the way of the fossil fuel industry’s aggressive
attempt to strangle the continent with a network of pipelines
and other fossil fuel “infrastructure .” These bills are a subset
of the larger list of anti-protest bills we analyzed above .102

ExxonMobil

Koch Industries / Flint Hills

Enbridge / Spectra / Alliance Pipeline

TC Energy (TransCanada)

Valero

CenterPoint Energy / Vectren

Energy Transfer

Magellan Midstream

Dominion Resources

Many of these companies are directly involved or invested in
projects fiercely opposed by the climate justice movement.

Enbridge: Indigenous rights activists in Minnesota and
Wisconsin have led resistance to the permitting and
construction of Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline in those states since
2013 .106 Private security companies working for Enbridge have
shared information about activists with local police, while
Minnesota’s federal “fusion center” — one of many created
to share counterintelligence information about terrorist
threats — has tracked Line 3 opponents by communicating
with police in at least three states .107 On February 25, Rep .
Shane Mekeland (R) and Rep . Eric Lucero (R) introduced
Minnesota HF 1558, which would hold anyone liable for aiding
or advising individuals who trespass on critical infrastructure
property. The legislation is similar to a bill that was first
introduced in 2018 .108

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY   |  14

Energy Transfer: The company’s Dakota Access Pipeline has
become a national and international litmus test of Indigenous
sovereignty and rights and of the nation’s commitment to
curbing climate change. Soon after a new anti-protest law was
passed in Louisiana, off-duty law enforcement employed by
a private security company retained by Energy Transfer used
the law to crack down on local protesters against the Bayou
Bridge pipeline, even arresting activists canoeing in public
waters outside the borders of the pipeline easement .109

Marathon Petroleum: Marathon bought a partial interest in
the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016, amidst growing opposition
to the project led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe .110
Environmental Justice activists say that Marathon’s Detroit
refinery is primarily responsible for making the neighboring
predominantly Black zip code the most polluted in Michigan .111

Dominion Resources: The company canceled its Atlantic
Coast Pipeline in 2020 after six years of persistent opposition
by landowners and climate justice activists .112

TC Energy (TransCanada): TransCanada is the owner and
developer of the Keystone XL Pipeline . For nearly a decade

the company has sought ways to criminalize opposition to
the project . In 2013, Bold Nebraska obtained documents
revealing that the Canadian company was providing security
briefings to Nebraska authorities advising them to explore
the viability of using “anti-terrorism laws” against pipeline
opponents .113 In 2019, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem
signed a bill with severe penalties for “riot boosting” that was
designed to weaken opposition to the pipeline’s construction .
The governor and the state’s attorney general later agreed not
to enforce the law after a settlement stemming from an ACLU
challenge to the law’s constitutionality .114

Valero Energy: Valero, the second largest oil refiner in the
country, was planning to be an “anchor customer” of the
Keystone XL Pipeline before President Biden canceled the
project on his first day in office.115 The pipeline was designed
to move Alberta tar sands oil down to the Gulf Coast, where
it was to supply Valero’s refineries in Texas and Louisiana.116
Emails obtained by Documented and published by The
Intercept indicate that Julie Klumpyan, Valero’s Director of
Government Affairs, called Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin
to encourage her to sign H .B . 1123, an anti-protest bill, which
Fallin eventually did .117

Koch Industries: Koch Industries is a leader among the
dozen fossil fuel companies that have persistently lobbied
for “critical infrastructure” legislation since 2017 . It’s also the
second largest contributor to anti-protest bill sponsors in the
most recent election cycle .118

Koch Industries has pushed aggressively for legislation that
creates new criminal offenses for acts of civil disobedience
and nonviolent protest . It backed a Texas law enacted in
2019 that criminalizes peaceful protests taking place near a
pipeline or other infrastructure, regardless of whether the
protests actually impair or interrupt the facility’s operations .119
The Texas-based Society of Native Nations opposed the bill in
the state legislature, emphasizing that the increased penalties
would inhibit free speech and unfairly criminalize Indigenous
people trying to protect their land .120

Interestingly, similar anti-protest bills have also been opposed
by a senior analyst with Americans for Prosperity (AfP), a
leading group in the network of politically active nonprofit
organizations funded by Charles Koch and his late brother
David . David Voorman, AfP’s senior policy analyst for free
speech and peace, denounced Georgia’s “Safe Communities

Act” and similar anti-protest bills as unconstitutional
infringements on free speech for requiring permits for
assembling on public property .121 Voorman’s opposition to
these bills is arguably in line with the libertarian principles
espoused by the Koch Brothers . And yet, when the Koch
Brothers’ principles conflict with Koch Industries’ profits, it’s
the bottom line that seems to win out .

The Insurance Journal asked Koch Industries spokesman
David Dziok about the anti-protest provisions in critical
infrastructure bills supported by the company . Dziok said
the bills “are necessary — not only for the safety of the
communities in which we operate, but also for the safety of
those exercising their rights to demonstrate .”122

However, the company’s professed concern for the safety
of its neighboring communities is belied by the major
role it played in the aggressive and successful effort to kill
chemical safety legislation introduced in Congress in the
years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks .123 The legislation
would have required companies to substitute safer materials
and inherently safer technologies for existing ones .124 Koch
officials argued that the safer standards weren’t needed

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY   |  16

since there hadn’t been another attack since 9/11 .125 But the
bills were designed to protect against both deliberate attacks
and catastrophic accidents, which have happened in the
years before and after 9/11. Because Koch Industries helped
kill the legislation, millions of Americans continue to be
threatened by the potential for chemical releases caused by
accidents or sabotage .126

Industry Trade Associations: Fossil fuel companies also
lobby for anti-protest bills through business associations
such as the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers
(AFPM)127, the American Petroleum Institute and state affiliates
of the US Chamber of Commerce .128 These groups often play
a critical role in coordinating legislative strategy . In 2019, for
example, The Intercept obtained a recording of AFPM lobbyist
Derrick Morgan explaining that model legislation distributed
to an audience of industry representatives had been drafted
in response to protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline:
“We’ve seen a lot of success at the state level .…We’re up to
nine states that have passed laws that are substantially close
to the model policy that you have in your packet .”129

The fossil fuel industry’s ties to law enforcement agencies
and state and local police raises additional concerns,
particularly since police associations have also lobbied
for anti-protest legislation .

Fossil fuel companies have donated to police foundations
and, in some cases, served on their boards .130 It is also fairly
common for companies to employ off-duty law enforcement
officers as plant security. With respect to anti-protest
legislation, this creates the potential for conflicts of interest
and situations in which officers could abuse their authority
on behalf of private-sector employers . In Louisiana, “extra-
duty” state corrections officers used air generated by their
boat’s propeller to blow the anti-pipeline activists from a
nearby bayou onto an easement owned by Energy Transfer
Partners (ETP); the “extra-duty” officers were employed at
the time by an ETP security contractor .131 In Pennsylvania,
off-duty police were hired by Kinder-Morgan, a pipeline
company, to “deter” protestors .132

Potential conflicts of interest involving lawmakers who
might personally benefit from anti-protest legislation they
sponsor or vote for is another valid concern . In Ohio, Sen .
Frank Hoagland (R) was the primary sponsor of S .B . 33,
a new “critical infrastructure” law that was passed and
signed into law by Governor Mike DeWine in January 2021 .133
Hoagland runs a private security firm that consults for
oil and gas companies .134 Hoagland met with a lobbyist
retained by Koch Industries to discuss “critical infrastructure”
in 2018 .135

Corporate Responsibility and Actions

In the summer of 2020, many companies responded to the
Movement for Black Lives protests by formally pledging to
address racial justice .136 Most of these pledges are internal
commitments to diversity and inclusion that involve hiring
and advancement practices, pay equity and other policies .
Some involve underwriting low-income housing and small
and medium-sized enterprises .137 A growing number of
companies are donating to policy initiatives involving
civil rights and criminal justice reforms, part of the larger
challenge of addressing structural racism .138

But addressing structural racism also means aligning corporate
political activities with the democratic values that many of
these same companies are committing to . Companies that don’t
continuously strive to align their political activities with the
values they espouse and commitments they make risk damaging
their own reputations, potentially hurting their bottom line .

Hundreds of companies themselves made that immediately
clear after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, suspending
contributions to members of Congress who flouted the

will of the electorate by refusing to certify the results of the
2020 election .139

But companies that profess a commitment to racial justice
and democracy must go further . They need to choose which
side they are on and end their support for politicians seeking
to restrict the constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of
speech and assembly, particularly when those restrictions
are targeted at or disproportionately enforced against
communities of color .

Companies cannot have it both ways: You cannot pretend
to be a climate champion by pointing to reduced carbon
emissions while contributing to politicians who block
climate policies or attack the rights of Indigenous land and
water protectors and climate activists . You cannot claim to
be committed to racial justice while supporting politicians
who sponsor bills designed to criminalize and strip away the
constitutional rights of Black and Brown protesters . What
follows are specific recommendations for companies to
take under consideration in determining how their actions
measure up to their commitments .

Conclusion and Recommendations

America is confronting an historic and overlapping set of challenges, including a climate crisis

that threatens to spiral out of control. We cannot effectively and equitably address these crises

in a democracy that excludes communities that are most impacted . When such is the case,

Americans lose the right to legitimately describe their government as a democracy .140

together to publish “We Stand for Democracy,” the statement
denouncing state legislative attacks on voters’ rights, in the
Washington Post and New York Times .143

These actions are welcome . But more action is needed at
both the state and federal levels . With 361 anti-voter bills
introduced in 47 states (as of late March 2021), and some
already passed and signed into law, the time has come for
companies to support the enactment of national standards
to overturn these laws and ensure that every American can
safely and freely cast their ballot .

Given its historical support for many of the most anti-
democratic politicians in the country, the corporate
community has a lot to answer for . Its commitment to
democracy will be measured in the weeks and months
ahead by the actions they take .

The same communities that bear the worst impacts of
pollution and poverty are also the targets of voter suppression
and the criminalization of protest . And that’s on top of the
many existing and ongoing related injustices they face,
including surveillance, deportation, mass criminalization,
incarceration, and police violence . Ultimately, the injustices
inflicted upon such communities affect the entire society.
Injustices so large cannot be ignored, even by those in the
most powerful perches of privilege .

Fortunately, some corporate leaders have begun to
acknowledge their responsibility to step up and join
the defenders of democracy and inclusion, inside and
outside of government .

After the violent insurrection on January 6, at least 130
companies suspended PAC contributions to members of
Congress who refused to certify the results of the 2020
Election .141 Days later, the
U .S . Chamber of Commerce,
the Business Roundtable and
the National Association of
Manufacturers called for a
peaceful transfer of power .142

Yet the attacks on democracy have
persisted after Trump’s exit from
office. The false flag of election
fraud has been carried to Georgia
and other states, where anti-voter
legislation has been introduced in
the name of election integrity .

Two weeks after a group of
prominent Black business leaders
called upon Corporate America to
“marshal its collective influence
to ensure fairness and equity
for all,” hundreds of companies
and individual executives joined

QUIT SUPPORTING POLITICIANS WHO
SPONSOR OR VOTE FOR ANTI-VOTER AND
ANTI-PROTEST LEGISLATION.

Americans expect companies to align their actions with
their values: A recent poll by Morning Consult found that
57 percent of Americans think companies “should cut
back on donations to elected officials who are working
to limit voting rights .”146

Companies must withhold and ultimately end all forms
of direct or indirect political spending for lawmakers who
introduce, sponsor or vote for legislation designed to
restrict people’s basic right to vote .147

BEYOND PAC CONTRIBUTIONS:
STOP ALL POLITICAL SPENDING

PACs account for only a fraction of the money that flows
from companies into politics .148 Companies contribute far
more to party committees, Super PACs and politically-active
non-profit “dark money” groups.149 In the 2020 cycle, for
example, companies and wealthy individuals were primarily
responsible for the over $2 billion spent by Super PACs .150
Ultimately, companies need to suspend all forms of direct
and indirect campaign spending .151

Big money in politics creates a structural form of discrimina-
tion that makes it much harder for Black and Brown people
to build and exert political power and effectively advocate for
their interests and community needs, including their ability
to run for and win elected office. Large donors skew sharply
white due to racial wealth disparities driven by historic and
current discrimination .152 It is time to build on the successes
of state and local models of publicly financed campaigns by
passing the For The People Act (H .R . 1/ S . 1) .

It is also time to ensure more transparency in political
spending to reduce corruption and increase accountability,
another important principle behind some of the disclosure
requirements contained in the For the People Act .153

Companies should also adopt a code of conduct for political
spending and disclosure, as recommended by many
shareholder groups and experts in corporate accountability
and governance .154

“CHANGE THE CHAMBER”

Companies that “stand for democracy” should withdraw their
support from the U .S . Chamber of Commerce so long as it
opposes the For The People Act (H .R . 1/ S . 1) or work within to
stop it from lobbying against “the greatest civil rights bill since
the civil rights movement itself .”155

Executives from six companies that endorsed the “We Stand
for Democracy” statement released on April 14 — IBM,
Boston Consulting Group, United Airlines, Microsoft, Deloitte
and Ford — serve on the Chamber’s board of directors, its
“principal governing and policymaking body .”156

These and other Chamber member companies that signed the
statement, bear a particular responsibility to either change
the Chamber’s position or demonstrate their conviction and
disagreement with the Chamber’s position by resigning .157

DEFEND THE RIGHT TO DISSENT

Companies must recognize the important role that peaceful
protesting has played in advancing the cause of democracy .
Companies that respect and support the constitutionally
protected right to peacefully protest should take the
following actions:

	| Stop supporting state lawmakers who sponsor or vote for

anti-protest legislation .

	| Stop supporting the American Legislative Exchange

Council (ALEC) along with state and regional affiliates of
the Chamber of Commerce, so long as they support anti-
protest legislation .158

	| Stop doing business with other companies that lobby in

support of anti-protest legislation .

	| Withdraw support for any police association or other

groups that lobby for anti-protest legislation .

	| Don’t hire individuals or contract with private security

companies with a record of surveillance and infiltration of
activist groups, or who are connected to violent extremist
and white supremacist groups .

62  Glenn Kessler, Fact Checker, “ Washington Post, March 18, 2019 . Link . The
text of the relevant section is here . It should also be pointed out that the
Chamber is hardly in the position to be lecturing members of Congress
about how taxpayer funds are used, given how many of its members
have paid little to no taxes in recent years . See Citizens for Tax Justice’s
analysis for 2018 and 2020 . A positive result of this provision is that it
would create a kind of virtuous circle that rewards candidates for being
less dependent upon wealthy individuals and companies for the funds
needed to run a viable campaign, and therefore less beholden to them
once they are in office, making them more likely to work to ensure that
laws holding companies accountable are strongly enforced .

63  Although the Chamber does not disclose its members, we were able to
determine that well over half of the top corporate contributors to state
sponsors of anti-voter legislation are members of the Chamber . To check
specific companies see companies’ own reports to shareholders, the
Public Citizen 2017 “Chamber of Secrets” report, and the Chamber’s
current and past list of members of its board of directors . Additional
evidence of membership can be deduced from participation in the
Chamber’s overseas business councils, as well as awards and news
references by the Chamber’s Foundation .

Review 53, esp . Footnote 23 . Link . As Nosek points out, whether or not
specific legislation violates the First Amendment, “taken together,” the
pattern of legislation and related activities, including lawsuits against
protesters and their supporters “threatens to profoundly chill free speech
and democratic engagement in a critical moment for climate action .
Indeed, some have argued that the intent behind many of these tactics is
the unconstitutional deterrence of climate protest .”

DeSantis on April 19, 2021, “creates a new affirmative defense in civil
lawsuits for personal injury, death, or property damage, such that a
defendant could avoid liability by establishing that the injury, death, or
damage they committed “arose from” conduct by someone “acting in
furtherance of a riot .” Oklahoma H.B. 1674, which was enacted into law,
shields drivers from civil or criminal liability who injure or kill someone
while “fleeing from a riot,” as long as they did so “unintentionally,”
were “exercising due care,” and held a “reasonable belief” that they
needed to flee to protect themselves. Another bill introduced in Florida
(S.B. 1096/H.B. 1419) would have eliminated driver liability for hitting
protesters . In Iowa, SF 534: would provide immunity from civil liability
for drivers who injures someone who is participating in a “protest,
demonstration, riot, or unlawful assembly,” engaging in “disorderly
conduct,” and blocking traffic, as long as the driver was exercising “due
care” and the protester did not have a permit to be in the street . A similar
bill (HF 251) was introduced in the Iowa House . As of this writing, similar
driver immunity bills are pending in Missouri (S .B . 66; H .B . 56), Nevada
(AB 168), Tennessee (H .B . 513/S .B . 843) and Washington State (S .B . 5456;

139  For an incomplete list of such companies go here . We know there are

many more companies than those on our list since a Conference Board
survey of executives found that “only about a quarter of companies
publicly announced their PACs’ response to the events of January 6th .”
The Conference Board reported that many companies explained that
they suspended their contributions out of concern for their reputation .

Suspending Political Contributions Following Capitol Riot,” The

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY   |  31

140  In 2014, two eminent political scientists published the results of an

examination of 1,779 cases of proposed changes in federal policy, including
369 in which “mass-based interest groups took a stand,” reaching the
conclusion that “majorities of the American public actually have little
influence over the policies our government adopts. Americans do enjoy
many features central to democratic governance, such as regular elections,
freedom of speech and association, and a widespread (if still contested)
franchise. But we believe that if policymaking is dominated by powerful
business organizations and a small number of affluent Americans, then
America’s claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened .”

Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens,” Perspectives
on Politics , Volume 12 , Issue 3 , September 2014 , pp . 564 - 581 . Link .
This was seven years ago, before the attack on such “features central
to democratic governance” described in this report had become the
legislative priority of one of America’s two major political parties .
