The oil spill involving the British Petroleum (BP) Deepwater 
Horizon is only the latest accident in BP’s long history of 
environmental and safety disasters. Despite a long rap sheet 
of environmental wrongdoing, BP touts itself as a “green” 
company, and spends millions of dollars attempting to 
rebrand itself as “Beyond Petroleum.” But in reality, it fights 
relentlessly for oil and gas exploration and drilling in environ -
mentally sensitive regions, including Alaska and the Gulf of 
Mexico. Multinational Monito r magazine named BP one of the 
“10 Worst Companies” in 2000 and 2005 based in part on 
BP’s poor environmental record (http://bit.ly/9drWPK) . 
BP’S ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD
BP has paid millions in civil and criminal penalties for violating 
major federal environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, 
Clean Water Act, and other laws designed to protect the 
environment and public health. From air pollution to leaky oil 
pipelines, BP has one of the worst environmental records in 
the industry. 
At BP’s Texas City oil refinery in Texas, BP pled guilty to 
violations of the Clean Air Act, and paid approximately $50 
million in penalties for polluting the air with harmful air emis -
sions such as benzene. The Environmental Protection Agency  
(EPA) also fined BP over $700,000 for violations of the 
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act at 
the Texas City refinery, and the State of Texas fined BP over 
$130,000 for illegally releasing air pollutants from the Texas 
City oil refinery. BP faced similar problems at its oil refinery 
in Carson, California, and paid over $30 million in penalties 
and fees when its refinery violated state air quality laws. The 
EPA also cited BP for multiple Clean Air Act violations at its oil 
refinery in Whiting, Indiana. 
In 2006, BP’s oil pipeline spilled 200,000 gallons of crude oil 
into the Alaskan tundra, and the company paid approximately 
$20 million in penalties to state and federal authorities to 
resolve these problems. Alaskan pipeline leaks are still being 
investigated, and as recently as November 2009, BP spilled 
another 46,000 gallons of oil in the North Slope of Alaska. 
In fact, BP failed to comply with its consent order to remedy 
the pipeline problems in Alaska, forcing the Department of 
Justice to file a civil lawsuit to force BP to take corrective 
action. BP also violated the Clean Water Act at its oil fields 
in Fremont County, Wyoming, and just two years ago was 
found liable for contaminating drinking water with MTBE, a 
gasoline additive.
BP’S SAFETY RECORD
Prior to the explosion on BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig, BP’s 
Texas oil refinery exploded, killing 15 workers and injured 170 
others. In 2009, the Occupational Safety and Health Admin -
istration (OSHA), a federal agency charged with protecting worker safety, fined BP $87 million for negligent operations 
at the refinery. In March 2010, BP paid another OSHA fine of 
$3 million, this time for violations of worker safety laws at its 
Husky oil refinery in Ohio. 
In addition to paying some of the largest fines in OSHA 
history, the U.S. Chemical Safety & Hazard Investigation 
Board found that BP had ignored warning signs at its refinery 
and failed to take measures to prevent the Texas refinery 
explosion. 
Even the Department of Interior’s Minerals Management 
Service (MMS), an agency heavily criticized for lax oversight 
of BP’s operations, found numerous safety violations at BP 
facilities. MMS fined BP in 2007, 2006, twice in 2004, three 
times in 2003, and three times in 2002 for unsafe practices 
that led to injury or accidents.
BP’S GREENWASH CAMPAIGN
To cover its environmental wrongdoing, BP actively engages 
in public relations campaigns to “greenwash” its business 
practices. But behind BP’s “Beyond Petroleum” slogan and 
renewable energy advertising lies a company firmly com -
mitted to exploiting fossil fuels at any cost, even if it means 
risking worker safety or violating environmental laws. In fact, 
BP has put little effort into renewable energy--instead, it 
has aggressively expanded its oil and gas exploration, often 
in environmentally sensitive areas in Alaska or the Gulf of 
Mexico.
THE SOLUTIONS
 »The Gulf oil spill and other catastrophes like it are predictable 
outcomes of our reliance on fossil fuels. We must change 
course. Congress must act NOW to: 
 »Put stricter regulations in place for the coal and oil industries to 
make them safer and more accountable for the damage they 
do.
 »Place a ban on new offshore drilling
 »There should be an immediate end to all subsidies for fossil 
fuels and nuclear energy and investments should be focused 
on clean renewable energy, efficiency technology, and infra -
structure development.
 »Pass legislation that jumpstarts a clean energy revolution in the 
U.S.
