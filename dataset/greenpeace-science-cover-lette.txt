October 20, 2004Greenpeace Cover Letter to the EQI Mercury ReportINTRODUCTIONA Statistical Analysis of Factors Associated with Elevated Hair Mercury Levels in the U.S. Population: AnInterim Progress Report, produced by the Environmental Quality Institute (EQI) at the University of NorthCarolina at Asheville (UNCA), presents the current results for an ongoing survey of mercury levels in hairin volunteers from across the United States.As of the release of this progress report, 1,449 hair samples have been analyzed for mercury content.  Ofthose, 597 represent women of childbearing age (16-49 years of age). Within that group, 126 women –approximately 21 percent - had mercury levels that were above the reference level for mercury in hair,which correlates to the reference dose designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) forchildren, women of childbearing age and pregnant women.  Given that the age structure of this sub-groupin the current study might differ from that in the general population, this percentage may not hold forwomen of childbearing age across the U.S. population as a whole.  In addition to the samples that havealready been analyzed, another 1,500 home sampling kits have been purchased, and it is expected thatseveral thousand more will be collected and analyzed for a final report to be released in early 2005.PURPOSEGreenpeace launched the Mercury Hair Sampling Project in order to draw attention to the global problemof mercury pollution, a major source of which is mercury emitted from coal-fired power plants, and toinform participants about clean energy alternatives that would reduce mercury emissions.  Greenpeacerecognizes that coal-fired power plants are not the only source of mercury pollution.  Nevertheless, they area substantial contributor to global pollution and represent one industry sector, namely power plants, thatcould contribute significantly to reducing mercury emissions by phasing out the burning of coal andintroducing clean energy alternatives such as wind and solar power.1The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES) from 1999 and 2000 assessed hair mercury levels in 838 children 1 to 5 years of age, and 1,726women 16 to 49 years of age.2  Based on these results, similar findings of mercury blood levels, and thenumber of births in 2000, it has been estimated that between 300,000 and 630,000 newborns each year inthe United States may be exposed in utero to concentrations of methyl mercury above the EPA limit that isconsidered to be without increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental effects.3  While the NHANES studyselected a representative sample of the United States population, the Greenpeace project does not limitparticipation to selected individuals, and therefore the results of the two studies cannot yet be statisticallycompared.  The Greenpeace project aims to test a larger study group of volunteers regardless of gender, ageor ethnicity.  This will ultimately provide new data about mercury levels in population sub-groups otherthan those studied by NHANES.  In addition to providing new data, Greenpeace is also providing access toan analytical service at cost, which is not routinely available on demand through government sources.                                                            1 Analysis of U.S. EPA’s 1999 National Emissions Inventory for Hazardous Air Pollutants as cited inNortheast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), Mercury Emissions from Coal-FiredPower Plants: The Case for Regulatory Action, October 2003.2 McDowell, Margaret A., et al. “Hair Mercury Levels in US Children and Women of Childbearing Age:Reference Range Data from NHANES 1999-2000.” Environmental Health Perspectives 112(11) (August2004): 1165-1171.3Mahaffey, Kathryn R., Clickner, Robert P. and Bodurow, Catherine C. “Blood Organic Mercury andDietary Mercury Intake: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 and 2000”Environmental Health Perspectives 112(5) (April 2004): 562-570.Mahaffey, K.

Additionally, Greenpeace is providing information to participants about the effects of mercury pollutionand the potential long-term solutions.COLLABORATIONGreenpeace has provided the Environmental Quality Institute at the University of North Carolina atAsheville with a grant to conduct a research study in order to assess mercury hair levels in volunteers fromthe United States.4  Through this agreement, EQI is responsible for the design, execution, analysis, qualitycontrol and reporting of results.  Therefore, all technical questions regarding the design and execution ofsampling and analysis should be directed to EQI (http://www.unca.edu/eqi/).  Through this agreement withEQI, Greenpeace has the right to use the project and its results to inform the public about mercury pollutionand potential solutions.  However, EQI owns the data collected and can use it for future research projectsand publications not sanctioned by Greenpeace.PARTICIPANTSThe participants in this ongoing study are volunteers who have chosen to be involved either by providing ahair sample at a Greenpeace event, at a participating hair salon, to a partner organization or by ordering thetest by mail for a nominal fee (which covers sample analysis and essential associated costs only).  Becausethe majority of participants paid a fee to be involved, Greenpeace and EQI did not limit participation in theproject to people of a specific age, gender, ethnicity or rate of fish consumption and accepted all samplesthat appeared to have been properly collected and had all paperwork completed.  Further information aboutparticipant self-selection and potential bias is addressed in the EQI report.EPA AND FDA REFERENCE DOSEThe reference dose (RfD) is a numerical estimate of a daily oral exposure to the human population,including sensitive subgroups such as children, which is not likely to cause harmful effects during alifetime. RfDs are generally used for health effects that are thought to have a threshold or low dose limit forproducing effects. The EPA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have jointly determined a referencedose for methyl mercury of 0.1 µg/kg body weight/day, which corresponds to a hair mercury level of oneµg/g (one microgram of mercury per gram of hair) for women of childbearing age, pregnant women,nursing women and young children.5 Because this reference dose was not set for the general population, itcannot be applied to people who do not fit into these specific categories.  There are no current healthguidelines or government reference doses for men or elderly women.  Health care professionals andscientists are concerned that chronic exposure to methyl mercury may also produce cardiovascular effectsthat would adversely affect any member of the population, however studies have not yet determined areference dose for these effects.6SOURCES OF MERCURYEmissions from coal-fired power plants account for the largest single source of industrial mercuryemissions in the United States – approximately 41 percent.7  However, mercury is a global problem withsources of pollution all over the world.  Coal is also burned heavily in Europe and Asia as a fuel for power                                                            4 http://www.unca.edu/eqi/5 U.S. EPA. Reference Dose for Mercury.

plants.  The U.S. consumption of coal is approximately 20 percent of the global total.8  Mercury is alsoreleased from a wide range of other sources, including waste incinerators and certain chemical industries,such as the production of chlorine.9  In addition, there are natural sources of mercury from volcaniceruptions and erosion of rocks and soils.The major source of mercury exposure for people is consumption of fish that contain mercury.  Undercertain conditions, elemental mercury is converted to a more biologically toxic form, methyl mercury, bybacteria in soils and water.  Fish concentrate this methyl mercury contamination as it is carried up the foodchain from bacteria to small organisms and on to smaller fish.   Large predatory fish consequently carry theheaviest mercury contamination.  At the same time, many fresh water fish in the United States are alsocontaminated with mercury. It is difficult to identify the specific source of mercury contamination in anyindividual person or fish. It has been shown, however, that reduction of point source mercury emissionslimits not only the global environmental impact of mercury pollution but can also reduce the potentialimpact of elevated localized levels of mercury (“hot spots”) near the point source.10  It is therefore possibleto begin to tackle major ongoing mercury emissions at the source, including reducing mercury emissionsfrom power plants by switching from coal to clean energy alternatives.HEALTH IMPLICATIONSOrganic compounds of mercury such as methyl mercury are considered the most toxic forms of theelement. Exposures to very small amounts of these compounds over time can result in accumulation inbody tissues and health effects including neurological damage.  For fetuses, infants and children theprimary health effects of mercury are on neurological development. Even the levels of mercury exposurewhich result from a mother's consumption of methyl mercury from dietary sources can adversely affect thebrain and nervous system of a developing fetus. Impacts on memory, attention, language and other skillshave been found in children exposed to moderate levels in the womb.11HAIR SAMPLINGHair sampling is one effective method of monitoring mercury in one’s body.  However, hair provides onlya snapshot of mercury consumption and contamination in the recent past. As one’s hair grows out, it carriessome of the mercury in the bloodstream acting like an indicator strip of ongoing blood levels.   Bloodanalysis is a more direct method to determine mercury levels in the body, though hair analysis - whenconducted to strict protocols - is widely accepted for large-scale studies and as a valuable indicator ofexposure over time.  However, hair mercury levels cannot be used to determine if a person has chronicmercury poisoning. Further testing and medical analysis is needed for such assessment.Hair sampling was chosen for this project because of the ease and relatively low cost of sampling manypeople, and to be as consistent as possible with the analytical methods used by the Center for DiseaseControl in the NHANES study detailed above.BREAST-FEEDINGAlthough methyl mercury can pass from mother to child when breast-feeding, Greenpeace believes that thebenefits of breast-feeding outweigh the risks of general population exposure to mercury.  If you havereason to believe that you have been exposed to unusually high levels of mercury, please consult a doctor.Recent studies have shown that mercury contamination in umbilical cord blood is even higher than themother’s general blood system suggesting higher risk to unborn children than may previously have beenestimated.12                                                            8 International Energy Annual, Key World Energy Statistics, 20049 United Nations Environment Programme.

FISH CONSUMPTIONFish is a food source that supplies the body with Omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reducerisks of cardiovascular disease and other heart problems.  There are other sources of these fatty acids suchas dark green vegetables like broccoli, spinach, lettuce and kale, and walnuts, flax seed, beans (mung, navy,pinto and kidney), peas, citrus, melons and cherries.  The EPA and FDA issued a joint fish advisory forsmall children, pregnant women, women who may become pregnant and nursing mothers.13  A number ofscientists have expressed concern about this advisory.14  The EPA and FDA considered multiple advisoryscenarios and opted to recommend fish consumption advice that may allow up to 5.9% of women ofchildbearing age, pregnant and nursing women, and small children to have mercury levels over thereference limit.15  Greenpeace makes the following fish consumption recommendations based on fish tissueanalyses done by the FDA, and advisories from the EPA and analysis from the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, and the Mercury Policy Project.1.  Do not eat grouper, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish becausethey contain high levels of mercury.2. Avoid (eat less than three 6 oz. servings a month) bluefish, croaker, halibut, lobster(American/Maine), rockfish, sea bass, sea trout (weakfish), canned albacore tuna, and tuna steaks.3. Eat sparingly (less than six 6 oz. servings a month) carp, cod, dungeness crab, blue crab, snowcrab, mahi mahi, monkfish, freshwater perch, skate, snapper, and chunk light canned tuna.4. Eat in moderation farmed abalone, anchovies, butterfish, calamari (squid), catfish, farmed caviar,clams, king crab, crawfish/crayfish, flounder, haddock, hake, herring, lobster (spiny/rock),Atlantic mackerel, farmed mussels, oysters, ocean perch, pollock, wild salmon, sardines, scallops,shad, shrimp, sole, farmed sturgeon, tilapia, trout, and whitefish.5. Check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local lakes,rivers and coastal areas. If no advice is available, eat up to six ounces (one average meal) per weekof fish you catch from local waters, but do not consume any other fish during that week.6. Fishing and farming practices of selected species have raised environmental concerns.  Refer to theOcean Friendly Seafood Guide to learn more at www.blueocean.org
