POLICY BRIEF
 
 
 
ExxonMobil stands to bene fit from the U.S. State Department’s approval of the
 
Keystone XL pipeline, and  consequently Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should
 
recuse himself from the pe rmitting decision.
 
 
Summary Findings
 
●
Secretary of State Rex Tille rson should recuse
 
himself from the decision to a pprove  or re ject the
 
Keystone XL pipeline.
 
●
Tillerson’s recent employer , ExxonM obil, is
 
heavily invested in high-cos t, environm entally
 
destructive tar sands produc tion that would be
 
served by the pipeline.
 
●
Canadian tar sands' producti on is projected to be
 
limited by a lack of pipeline  capacity. It trades at a
 
significant discount relative  to WTI crude when
 
pipeline capacity is constraine d -- a  probl em which
 
Keystone XL was proposed t o fix.
 
●
Approval of Keystone XL w ould increase the
 
value of tar sands oil sold on gl obal markets, and
 
hence the value of ExxonMobi l’s tar sands assets.
 
●
As such, ExxonMobil stand s to materially benefit
 
from the approval of the pip eline granted by i ts
 
former CEO Tillerson.
 
●
By handing over U.S. foreig n pol icy to an oil
 
industry executive, Trump h as created fertile
 
ground for extensive conflict s of interest.
 
●
Recusal in this case is keeping w ith the spirit of
 
government ethics laws and M r. Tillerson’s own
 
stated ethics commitments.
 
 
Trump Order Calls For Rapid A pproval of
 
Keystone XL
 
Upon taking office one of President T rump’s first actions
 
was to revive the controversial Keys tone XL pipeline,
 
which would increase the connectivi ty between Canada’s
 
tar sands production and U.S. refineri es.
 
 
 
In a January 24, 2017 Presidential Me morandum  he
 
directed the Secretary of State to “re ach a final permitting
 
determination” within 60 days of Tra nsCanada's renewed
 
application.

Canadian Tar Sands Are Environmentally
 
Destructive and Economically Questionable
 
Canadian tar sands were widely touted as a major asset for
 
international oil companies squeezed by de clining
 
produc tion from  existing oi l fields and a lack of access to
 
new discoveries. However, the tar sands have proven to be
 
both highly controversial and econom ically que stionable.

The mining and processing of tar sa nds is environm entally
 
destructive and highly carbon-intensi ve when compared to
 
conventional crude oil. When first p ropos ed in 2008, t he
 
Keystone XL pipeline provoked wid espread oppos ition
 
both in Canada and the U.S. eventual ly leading to
 
President Obama’s 2015 decision to  reject TransCanada’s
 
permit application.
 
 
Over 120 First Nations and Tribes on bot h sides of the
 
Canadian/U.S. border have signed a t reaty stating their
 
explicit opposition to tar sands pipel ines, trains and tankers
 
through their territorial lands and wa ters. The Treaty is an
 
expression of Indigenous Law and oppos es new, conve rted
 
or expanded pipeline infrastructure projects in Canada and
 
the U.S. that would facilitate the exp ansion of t he tar sands
 
-- including Kinder Morgan’s Trans  Mountain,
 
TransCanada’s Energy East and Keys tone XL, and
 
Enbridge’s Northern Gateway and L ine 3 pipelines.

Analysts have criticized tar sands pr ojects as highly
 
capital-intensive but yielding low ret urns.
 President
 
5
Trump’s proposed Border Adjustment  Tax could furt her
 
complicate the economics of these proj ects. A study
 
published in the journal 
​
Nature
​
 foun d that expanded tar
 
sands production was largely incompa tible with limiting
 
global warming to 2 degrees C. Und er such scenarios,
 
open-pit bitumen mining would end  after 2020, a nd 85%
 
of Canadian bitumen reserves would  be “unburna ble.”
 
6
 
All told, tar sands are among the oil a ssets most likely to
 
be “stranded” by stagnant oil deman d, pe rsistent low
 
prices, lack of infrastructure, or con certed global action to
 
limit carbon emissions. Since 2014, 42 t ar sands projects
 
have been put on hold, delayed or c ancelled.

The question of whether ExxonM obil was properly
 
valuing these assets drew attention from state attorneys
 
general and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
 
Com mission. J ust this month, ExxonM obil bow ed to
 
pressure and “de-booke d” 3.5 bi llion ba rrels of previously
 
prove n oil reserves at the Kearl project, admitting that the
 
oil was uneconom ic to produc e at today’s prices.
 Before
 
9
the write-dow n, tar sands represented 35%  of Exxon’ s
 
liquids reserves.
 ExxonM obil stated that produc tion at
 
10
Kearl will continue despite the reserve adjustment.
 
 
Canadian Oil Sands Production Is Limited By A
 
Lack of Pipeline Capacity
 
Over the past year Western Canadian Select (WCS, or tar
 
sands) oil has traded about $14/ barrel lower than West
 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices
 and ha s traded
 
11
by m ore than $30/ barrel lower in the past. This discount is
 
evidence of competition from lighter U.S. crude oil, as
 
well as an ongoi ng pi peline bottleneck which makes it
 
difficult and m ore expensive for tar sands produc ers to
 
transport their produc t to refineries and the global market.
 
 
 
A 2017 re port by the Canadian Energy R esearch Institute
 
(CERI) not ed that “constraints in pipeline capacity and the
 
lack of a ccess to existing and ne w demand centers have
 
deepened the discount between WTI and W estern
 
Canadian crudes” thereby gi ving “Canadian produc ers a
 
financial incentive to expand m arket access in the United

States, Canada, and beyond.”
 The re port also not ed that
 
12
refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast we re the “first target for
 
market access” for Canadian produce rs due to their
 
considerable heavy oil processing c apacity.
 
 
The Canadian Chamber of Commerc e estimated that this
 
tar sands price discount was costing  produc ers C$50
 
million per day.
 Future construction of m ore pipeline
 
13
capacity would add value to the tar sands produc tion and
 
bring prices closer to WTI levels. Thi s could create a
 
windfall in revenue for all tar sands  produc ers -- including
 
ExxonMobil and Imperial Oil.

A 2016 report by the Canadian Assoc iation of P etroleum
 
Producers (CAPP) showed that pipe line capacity issues
 
will only grow worse over time. Thei r report forecast a
 
growth of 1.5 million barrels per da y in Canadian crude oil
 
production by 2030, and yet the exis ting pi peline system is
 
already at capacity.
 
 
14
 
Keystone XL would add a proposed  830,000 ba rrels per
 
day of capacity to the system. Recent ly the Canadian
 
government approved two additiona l pipeline projects that
 
would similarly ease the tar sands bot tleneck -- K inder

expansion. If a ll three pipelines are built, the WCS
 
discount could shrink to $5- $7 pe r barrel.
 
15
 
ExxonMobil Would Materially Benefit from
 
Keystone XL Approval
 
Should the Keystone XL pipeline be completed,
 
ExxonM obil’s tar sands produc tion w ould be well-placed
 
to take advantage. ExxonM obil states the Kearl project is
 
“well conne cted to the substantial North American pipeline
 
system.”
 
16
 
It is not know n if ExxonM obil or
 
Imperial Oil have existing contracts
 
or agreements with TransCanada to
 
ship oil via Keystone XL. However,
 
ExxonM obil would clearly benefit
 
from any reduction in the WCS
 
discount should Keystone XL be
 
built, even if it does not directly
 
contract with the pipeline for
 
transportation services. If approved,
 
the benefit to ExxonM obil could be
 
measured in the tens to hundr eds of
 
millions of dollars each year.
 
 
The CAPP report also not es that two
 
expansion pha ses for the Kearl
 
project have been approved, but  are
 
not yet currently ope rating. K earl Phase 3 would bring
 
80,000 ba rrels per day onl ine and K earl Phase 4
 
Debottleneck would add 45,000 ba rrels per day.
 Overall,
 
17
Imperial plans to doubl e their tar sands produc tion to
 
600,000 b/ d by 2020.  E xxonM obil also has refineries in
 
the U.S. Gulf Coa st region that could benefit from the
 
Keystone XL approval.
 
 
During the debate around t he initial Keystone XL
 
approva l, Rex Tillerson and ExxonM obil both consistently
 
advoc ated for t he approval of the pipeline in speeches,
 
18
blog pos ts,
 and reports.

Trump’s Ethics Rules Do Not Go  Far Enough
 
Upon accepting President Trump’s nom ination to serve as
 
Secretary of State, Tillerson resigne d as ExxonM obil CEO
 
and negotiated a divestment of his p ension and de ferred
 
stock compensation amounting to $ 180 m illion.
 
 
 
Tillerson’s ethics agreement states: “For a period of one
 
year after my resignation from ExxonM obil, I will not
 
participate personally and substantia lly in any pa rticular
 
matter involving specific parties in w hich I know  that
 
ExxonMobil is a party or represents  a party.”
 Existing
 
22
ethics guidelines put in place by Pre sident Obama
 and
 
23
continued by President Trump require  appointees to recuse
 
themselves from any decisions regardi ng their form er
 
employer for a period of two years.
 
24
 
Tillerson further pledges to “recuse m yself on a
 
case-by-case basis” from any partic ular matter in which a
 
“reasonable person” would question hi s impartiality.
 
Tillerson also states that he will full y divest his stock in
 
ExxonMobil within 90 days of his c onfirmation and w ill
 
not participate in “any particular mat ter that to my
 
knowledge has a direct and predicta ble effect on the
 
financial interests of ExxonMobil” unt il he has divested or
 
received a waiver. This raises the que stion of w hether
 
Tillerson will have divested himself w ithin the 60 da y
 
timeframe given for the Keystone X L decision.
 
 
In sworn testimony before the Senate , Tillerson re iterated
 
his commitment to recuse himself from  “any m atters that
 
might come before the State Depart ment that deal directly
 
and specifically with ExxonMobil”
 but also stated that he

“wouldn’t expect to recuse himself from issues concerning
 
the oil and ga s indus try generally.”
 
26
 
The phra se “particular matter involving specific parties”
 
has been interpreted to refer to the “legal rights” of the
 
parties.
 In this case, ExxonM obil might not be considered
 
27
a “specific party” to the Keystone XL decision be cause it
 
would affect the legal rights of TransCanada, not
 
ExxonM obil. Tillerson could choos e to interpret this
 
phrase in an artificially narrow manner that might allow
 
his participation -- but any reasonable person w ould
 
clearly que stion hi s impartiality in that situation.
 
 
 
A gove rnmental decision that directly and pr edictably
 
enriches a form er employer is precisely the sort of
 
situation that should warrant recusal. To ignore the close
 
conne ction be tween ExxonM obil’s tar sands operations
 
and the Keystone XL pipeline would be a gross violation
 
of the spirit of government ethics laws and w ould lend the
 
strong a ppearance of corruption. R ecusal is the only
 
possible course consistent with Rex Tillerson’s ethics
 
commitments.
 
 
The global scope of ExxonM obil’s operations and the
 
broad remit of the U.S. Department of State indicate that
 
conflicts such as these will be the norm during Tillerson’s
 
tenure. Looming de cisions regarding the Paris climate
 
change accord a nd R ussian sanctions were discussed
 
during Tillerson’s confirmation he arings and raise many of
 
the same recusal questions.
 
 
 
These widespread and troubling conflicts only highlight
 
the perils of appointing an oil indus try executive to be the
 
public face of U .S. diplomacy.
