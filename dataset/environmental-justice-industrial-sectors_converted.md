The EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) provides data to the public regarding toxic air and water
emissions from a large number of industrial facilities and locations across the United States.1
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and the Political Economy Research
Institute (PERI) have long taken this data, combined facilities under the same parent company, and
assessed the share of their pollution that falls on low-income and communities of color. This
information is published in their annual Top 100 Polluter Indexes.2

This briefing takes PERI’s latest air toxics dataset3 (based on 2018 TRI data) and calculates toxic
air pollution and environmental justice metrics not across parent companies, but industrial sectors.

The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 established the
TRI, which has proven to be a key source of information for communities living near industrial sites.
Because the TRI tracks such a wide diversity of toxic chemical releases, EPA has also developed
the Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) data to synthesize TRI emissions data into
simpler risk indices.4

Different chemicals have different toxicity levels and different exposure pathways, and the
demographics of nearby communities vary from facility to facility. For each facility, the RSEI can be
thought of as combining (emissions) x (toxicity) x (exposed population) data into one “toxic score.”
PERI conducts further analysis using finer grained geographic microdata (RSEI-GM) to estimate
the percentage of each facility toxic score that is borne by minority and low-income populations.

Past studies of TRI data have found that facilities and industries that report to TRI have a
disproportionate impact on low-income and communities of color.5,6,7 This 2018 data confirms the
trend of widespread environmental injustice across TRI-reporting sectors. Considering the
aggregate toxic score across all 15,552 facilities analyzed here, the overall minority share is 47.8%
and the low-income share is 17.6%. Table 1 shows that pollution burdens for five environmental
justice groups are larger than the national averages for the U.S. population.

To perform our sectoral analysis we group facilities according to their reported North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.9 NAICS is the standard system used by the federal
government to classify business establishments for the purpose of collecting statistical data.

In this briefing, we provide analysis and discussion of sectors and sub-sectors responsible for the
pollution reported by TRI, and we also provide more detailed analysis of certain specific sectors
associated with the oil and gas, petrochemical, and plastics industries.

In this section we present toxic scores and environmental justice metrics from the full 2018 PERI
air toxics dataset, as grouped by industrial sector. The PERI dataset includes 15,700 records, each

representing a facility reporting under TRI. Each record contains the TRI ID, facility name, parent
company, TRI emissions data, RSEI toxic scores, and a 6-digit NAICS code. For each facility, PERI
uses the RSEI-GM data to calculate the share of the toxic score that is borne by five populations:
minorities, Hispanic, African-American, poor, and near-poor.10

NAICS is a hierarchical classification system and a 6-digit code represents the finest level of detail
among economic sectors. The smaller the number of digits in the NAICS code represents a
broader grouping of facility types, while a larger number of digits represents a more specific
gradation.

To give an example, NAICS 325211 represents “Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing”
facilities, and is a subset of:

● 32521 (“Resin and Synthetic Rubber Manufacturing”),
● 3252 (“Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments

Manufacturing”),

● 325 (“Chemical Manufacturing”), and
● 32, which is one of three general “Manufacturing” sectors.

It is important to note that not all sectors or facilities are required to report TRI data and so only a
selection of NAICS codes appears in the TRI and PERI data. TRI does not encompass some of the
most widespread and deadly forms of pollution, including criteria air pollutants such as particulate
matter, ozone, and nitrogen oxides. Many of the facilities included in this data are also significant
sources of this criteria air pollution.

We present results from aggregating the 2018 toxic score records at the 3, 4, 5 and 6-digit NAICS
levels. A full, sortable spreadsheet of the results can be viewed here. Full details of these
groupings and re-calculations are found in the Technical Notes section below.

Table 2 and Figure 1 show the top 10 industrial sectors by total toxic score at the 3-digit NAICS
level. There are 49 3-digit NAICS sectors in the PERI dataset, but these top 10 sectors represent
more than 95% of the total reported toxic score.

Table 2: Top 10 polluting sectors at the 3-digit NAICS level. Minority and Poor Share represent the percentage of the
total RSEI Toxic Score which is borne by minority and low-income people, respectively. Sectors with a disproportionate
burden (compared to 39% minority and 14% low-income population averages) are highlighted in red, while the others are
green.

Figure 1: Top 10 polluting sectors at the 3-digit NAICS level. Vertical black lines in the right hand panels represent the
proportion of minority and poor people in the 2018 U.S. population (39% and 14%, respectively). Sectors with minority
and poor shares lower than those national proportions are marked green.

The chemical manufacturing sector (325) accounts for over 40% of the total reported toxic score,
and various types of metal and equipment manufacturing are also top polluting sectors. The
Petroleum and Coal Product Manufacturing (324) sector is #7 on the list, which we will discuss in
greater detail below.

Among the top 10 sectors, we can see that 7 sectors have toxic burdens that disproportionately
impact minorities, and only one sector (Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing, 327) has a
lower-than-average burden for both minority and low-income people. Of these 10 sectors, Waste
Management & Remediation (562) has the highest minority and low-income shares. Petroleum and
Coal Product Manufacturing (324) has a minority share of 56% and a poor share of 19%.

Because these high-level aggregations combine very diverse industries, it is often useful to look at
finer levels of aggregation. Table 3 and Figure 2 show the top 20 industrial sectors by total toxic
score at the 6-digit NAICS level, the most specific level of aggregation. There are 406 6-digit
NAICS codes in the PERI dataset, and these top 20 sectors represent over 70% of the total
reported toxic score.

Table 3: Top 20 polluting sectors at the 6-digit NAICS level. Minority and Poor Share represent the percentage of the
total RSEI Toxic Score which is borne by minority and low-income people, respectively. Sectors with a disproportionate
burden (compared to 39% minority and 14% low-income population averages) are highlighted in red, while the others are
green.

Figure 2: Top 20 polluting sectors at the 6-digit NAICS level. Vertical black lines in the right hand panels represent the
proportion of minority and poor people in the 2018 U.S. population (39% and 14%, respectively). Sectors with minority
and poor shares lower than those national proportions are marked green.

The same general sectors are represented in this top 20, but with more fine-grained detail:

● Key sectors that contribute to the overall Chemical Manufacturing toxic score include,

Surface Active Agents, Petrochemicals, Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals, Plastics and
Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and two catch-all categories for Other Basic Organic and
Inorganic Chemicals.

● The Petroleum and Coal Products toxic score is largely due to emissions from Petroleum

Refineries.

● Other key sectors include Aircraft Parts, Electroplating, and Steel Foundries.

Again, most of these sectors show disproportionate impacts on minorities (17 out of 20 sectors)
and low-income populations (19 out of 20).

Oil & Gas Focus

Meeting the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C will require rapid reductions in coal, oil and gas
production11 and consumption, particularly in scenarios that don’t rely heavily on CCS or negative

emissions technologies.12 A managed phase-out of the fossil fuel industries,13 consistent with
climate limits, brings with it the potential for large co-benefits from air pollution reductions -- and the
potential to alleviate entrenched patterns of environmental injustice. To fully achieve the air
pollution, public health, and environmental justice benefits of decarbonization, policy makers will
need to explicitly include those goals in their policy design.14

For these reasons, we provide more detail in this section on a few segments of the oil and gas
lifecycle that report to TRI and appear in the PERI dataset, including:

● Petroleum Refineries (324110, 147 records)
● Petroleum Bulk Stations and Terminals (424710, 407 records)

We report top-level statistics for a few other oil and gas-related sectors, including:

● Asphalt Paving, Roofing, and Saturated Materials Manufacturing (32412, 325 records)
● Other Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing (32419, 76 records)
● Oil and Gas Field Machinery and Equipment Manufacturing (333132, 51 records)
● Motor Vehicle Gasoline Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing (336310, 31 records)

There are also several additional oil and gas-related NAICS codes that appear in the PERI dataset,
but which have only small numbers of records or are not comprehensive across the sector. We do
not analyze these sectors further, but they include the following:

● Petroleum and Petroleum Products Merchant Wholesalers (424720, 2 records)
● Natural Gas Extraction (21113, 5 records)
● Pipeline Transportation (486, 2 records)
● Support Activities for Oil and Gas Operations (213112, 5 records)
● Oil and Gas Pipeline and Related Structures Construction (237120, 4 records)
● Air and Gas Compressor Manufacturing (333912, 7 records)
● Fossil Fuel Power Generation (221112, 449 records) -- natural gas power plants are not
required to report TRI data, so this category comprises only plants that burn coal or oil.

In addition, some fraction of emissions from many industrial sectors may be ultimately the result of
on-site use of fossil fuels for energy and heat.

To gain a complete picture of the Petroleum Refining industry we need to re-classify a few records
in the dataset. Comparing against the EIA’s 2020 Refinery Capacity report,15 we note that six
petroleum refineries are listed under NAICS codes other than 324110, while some records in that
sector (with generally smaller toxic scores) are tank farms or other related facilities. To match our

dataset to the EIA report, we reassigned these facilities giving a revised refinery dataset of 133
records (full details on these reassignments included in the Technical Notes section below).

The added six facilities increase the overall toxic score for petroleum refineries (from 8.42 million
reported above to 9.40 million), but do not significantly change the minority (56.4%) or poor shares
(18.5%) of the sector from what was reported above. These changes would nudge Petroleum
Refineries into #8 on the list of top polluting sectors, and put Petrochemical Manufacturing into
#9.16

To visualize the environmental justice impact of this sector, we plot minority share vs. poor share
for refineries in Figure 3. The area of each circle is proportional to the total toxic score for the
facility, and the top 10 most polluting refineries are labeled. Facilities located to the right of the
vertical red line (representing the 39% of the country who are minorities) have a toxic impact that
falls disproportionately on minority communities. Facilities located above the horizontal red line
(representing the 14% of the country who are low-income) have a toxic impact that falls
disproportionately on low-income communities.

proportional to its total toxic score, and the top 10 polluting facilities are labeled. The red lines represent the 2018

national proportion of minorities (39%) and poor people (14%). The red dot represents the sector-wide average toxic
score.

The figure shows that half of refineries and a majority of the total toxic score (6.30 million) are
found in areas that are both disproportionately minority and disproportionately low-income (upper
right quadrant).

Figure 4 shows the same 133 refineries, but this time plotting total minority share (left) and
low-income share (right) against total toxic score. In this plot, facilities with especially high
environmental justice impact are found to the upper right, signifying high overall emissions and
high minority or low-income share.

Figure 4: Minority (left) and poor (right) shares plotted against total toxic score (on a logarithmic scale) for 133 petroleum
refineries. The red lines represent the 2018 national proportion of minorities (39%) and poor people (14%).

We conduct a similar analysis for Petroleum Bulk Stations and Terminals (after removing 3
misclassified refineries and adding in 17 misclassified terminals). Figure 5 shows that emissions
from these facilities are much smaller than from refineries, but that they are more numerous and
are again disproportionately found in minority and low-income communities (1.18 million total toxic
score, 71.3% minority share, 19.1% poor share).

Petrochemical and Plastics Focus

The impact of plastic production and use on the environment and the climate has become a
high-profile issue in recent years. In this section, we take a closer look at the air toxic impacts of
the petrochemical sector and other sectors along the plastics supply chain, notably the following
NAICS codes:

● Petrochemical Manufacturing (325110, 48 records, after removing 1 refinery)
● Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing (325211, 333 records)
● Plastics Product Manufacturing (3261, 838 records)

The 48 records under Petrochemical Manufacturing also disproportionately impact minority and
low-income communities. Indeed, all of the top 10 most polluting facilities are located in the
upper-right quadrant of Figure 6. Although this sector has a similar total toxic score to the
Petroleum Refinery sector, the Petrochemical sector is marked by a few very large emitters in
contrast to a broader range of refineries with significant emissions.

Removing one refinery from this category decreases the overall toxic score for Petrochemical
Manufacturing (from 9.20 million reported above to 8.88 million), but does not significantly change
the minority (66.0%) or poor shares (18.2%) of the sector from what was reported above.

Figure 6: Minority and low-income shares of the toxic emissions from 48 Petrochemical Manufacturing facilities. The red
lines represent the 2018 national proportion of minorities (39%) and poor people (14%). The red dot represents the
sector-wide average toxic score.

We conduct a similar analysis for two subsequent stages of the plastic manufacturing process:
Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing (325211), and a broader sector containing different
forms of Plastics Product Manufacturing (3261). Figure 8 shows these facilities in one plot with
Plastics Materials in blue and Plastic Products in red.

Unlike Petrochemical Manufacturing, the plastics material and product manufacturing facilities in
this dataset do not show a disproportionate impact on minority communities, although they do
show a higher impact on low-income communities. Table 5 summarizes the findings for these 3
NAICS sectors.

Technical Notes

Research Brief: Environmental Justice Across Industrial Sectors

We are grateful to Michael Ash and Rich Puchalski of PERI for providing their latest dataset for this
analysis.

The PERI “air facilities” dataset contains the following information for each facility:

● TRI ID
● Facility Name
● Street Address, City, State
● Parent Company and ID
● “Split” flag noting facilities which are divided between two owners
● 6-digit NAICS code
● TRI reported air, incineration, and total (air+incin) releases (in pounds)
● RSEI toxic scores for air, incineration, and total (air+incin) releases
● “Revised” versions of the TRI and RSEI fields in the case that facilities revised their

reporting. PERI notes for this version “no revisions were made.”

● Five environmental justice ratios describing the percentage of that facility's toxic score

which impacted minority, hispanic, black, poor, and near poor populations (derived from
RSEI-GM data).

● Flags relating this dataset to a separate GHG dataset.

The full air facilities dataset contains 15,700 records from which we remove 178 records that are
missing EJ ratios, leaving 15,552 records for this analysis. For further information see also the
Technical Notes for the Toxic 100 Indexes.17

For each facility, multiplying the EJ ratios by the toxic score gives the share of total toxic burden for
that group. Those toxic score shares can then be summed over all facilities in the sector, for
example:

𝑇𝑆

𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦, 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟

  =

∑  (𝑇𝑆
𝑖

𝑡𝑜𝑡, 𝑖

× 𝑅

)
𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦, 𝑖

We then recalculate sector-wide EJ ratios:

𝑇𝑆

𝑡𝑜𝑡, 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟

  =

∑  𝑇𝑆
𝑖

𝑡𝑜𝑡, 𝑖

𝑅

𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦, 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes a report of petroleum refinery capacity,
the 2020 version of which includes 133 refineries across the U.S. Comparing this list against the
147 records under NAICS 324110 indicates a handful of facilities that are misclassified and some
facilities that report under two IDs, either to TRI or to EIA.

6 petroleum refineries were found listed under different NAICS codes (3 under 424710, 1 each
under 221112, 325311, and 325110). These records have large toxic scores and two are among
the most polluting refineries in the nation. The six refineries are:

● Royal Dutch Shell’s manufacturing complex in Norco, LA “features both refining and

chemicals facilities” according to the company website. There are two TRI records for the
complex, both of which are listed as 325110 (Petrochemical Mfg) in the PERI dataset.
However, the current TRI website (using 2019 data) classifies the “Norco West” site (TRI
identifier 70079SHLLL1205R) as 324110 (Petroleum Refineries) and the “Norco East” site
(70079SHLLL265RI) as 325110. Following this, we reassign the West site to 324110 in our
revised dataset and keep the East site as 325110.

● Marathon’s Los Angeles Refinery has two units located in Carson and Wilmington, CA that

started reporting as one entity in 2019. The refinery appears under 424710 (Petroleum Bulk
Stations and Terminals) in the PERI dataset, although it is listed as 324110 on the current
TRI website (90749RCPRD1801E). We reassign this record to 324110 in our revised
dataset.

● Marathon’s Galveston Bay Refinery has two units in Texas City, TX that merged in 2018.
The refinery has crude oil refining capacity of 585,000 bpcd and also hosts 1,055 MW of
electrical production capacity. Perhaps for that reason, it is listed as 221112 (Fossil Fuel
Power Generation) in the PERI dataset but 324110 on the TRI website
(7759WBLNCH2415T). We reassign it to 324110 for our revised dataset.

● Marathon’s Salt Lake City Refinery is listed in both the PERI dataset and on the TRI

website (84103MCLCM474WE) under 424710 (Petroleum Bulk Stations and Terminals).
We reassign it to 324110 for our revised dataset.

● Phillips 66’s Ponca City Refinery is listed in both the PERI dataset and on the TRI website

(74603CNCPN1000S) under 424710 (Petroleum Bulk Stations and Terminals). We reassign
it to 324110 for our revised dataset.

● CHS’s McPherson Refinery is listed in the PERI dataset and on the TRI website

(67460NTNLC2000M) as 325311 (Nitrogenous Fertilizer Manufacturing), but the company
website notes the refinery “relies on crude oil from Canada and distributes products
throughout the northern tier of the United States.” CHS also produces fertilizers and crop
inputs. We reassign it to 324110 for our revised dataset, removing it from 325110
(Petrochemical Mfg).

In addition:

● 17 records listed as 324110 in the PERI data are found to not be operating refineries, but
rather tank farms, terminals associated with refineries, or specialty operations. These
records generally have smaller toxic scores. We reassign these 17 records to 424710 in our
revised dataset.

● 5 refineries reported to TRI under two distinct records, while one refinery was listed as two
units in the EIA report, but only once in the TRI data. In many of these cases, the separate
TRI records are for “East” and “West” units of the same refinery.

● 5 refineries in the EIA report do not appear in the TRI data. These are small operations and

some may have been idled during the 2018 TRI reporting time period.

● 3 refineries were reported in the PERI database under two owners, due to a 50-50

partnership. We combined those records and summed the toxic scores and emissions
values.
