2INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
The world's remaining forests house over 50% of the earth's biodiversity.  The threat of habitat
loss as a result of continued unsustainable commercial logging operations and other activities over
the coming decades could be a major cause of global species extinctions, and the degradation of
critically important forest ecological processes and functions.  Increased rates of forest loss,
particularly in biodiversity rich areas, have reached crisis proportions.  Other considerations -
such as the long-term impacts of forest loss on wood supply and quality are also incompatible
with the survival of a healthy wood products industry.
In response to these concerns, and the momentum caused by public protests against key wood
product companies in the US and Europe, environmental non-governmental organizations
(ENGOs) and leaders in the wood products industry held discussions which led to the first
corporate commitments to adopt and implement ecologically responsible forest procurement
policies.  In the last 3 years, over 400 companies including the world's largest forest product
retail companies (Home Depot, Lowe's, Ikea) have publicly announced their commitment to
protect the world's intact, old growth and/or Endangered Forests by not sourcing wood from
these areas, and move as quickly as possible towards sourcing from Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC), and equivalent, certified sustainable forestry operations.  Many of these companies have
also committed to taking steps to avoid illegal sources of wood. Companies in the US and Europe
are quite clear that they need to buy more FSC (and equivalent) products, but they remain very
unclear about what products they should phase out.  In order to protect the worlds remaining
endangered forests, it is essential that guidance be provided to wood consuming companies. 
Defining and identifying Endangered Forests (which include old growth) will help guide company
implementation and ensure a transparent and accountable Endangered Forest commitment
implementation process.
Recently, major international banking institutions have begun to seriously explore new corporate
policies that would limit lending to forestry companies who document their sustainable forestry
practices and ensure that sustainable operations occur in areas where adequate protection and
conservation measures are in place.  Reaching consensus among the ENGO community, and
holding discussions with corporate implementers is becoming increasingly urgent.
This Discussion Document is the result of a significant effort by ENGO organizations that, in
different ways over time, have been directly involved with the Endangered Forest commitments
made by purchasers of wood products.
The general concepts and proposed purchaser actions are consistent with broadly defined ENGO
forest conservation and sustainable forestry principles and goals, including the importance of
locally-lead multi-stakeholder planning processes to determine representative protected areas and
other environmental conservation priorities.   They are also consistent and complimentary to on
going discussions about how to identify high conservation value forests (HCVF) including FSC-
HCVF principles. 

3The Wye Group
As follow up to previous efforts, the Wye Group was established in April 2001 as a forum
among a broad ad-hoc group of ENGOs and industry participants to define and  identify the
characteristics of Endangered Forests, and propose purchaser actions in relation to these forests. 
Industry only attended initial meetings and we look forward to re-engagement and dialogue.
The Wye River Discussion Document on Endangered Forests for the first time:
1. Lays out a vision and a blueprint for how responsible wood products companies will
carry out their commitment to avoid sourcing wood from the world's Endangered
Forests.
2. Represents a general consensus among participants from a broad spectrum of
campaigning, policy and technical ENGO perspectives.
3. Proposes a draft framework for how to define, and identify Endangered Forests.
4. Provides details on available information sources that will allow each Endangered
Forest category to be identified and mapped accurately.
5. Proposes wood product purchaser actions in relation to each Endangered Forest
category.
6. Is structured to be consistent and complimentary to FSC certification requirements.
7. Incorporates proposals beyond the corporate purchasing commitments specific to
Endangered Forests by adding a social category (to direct companies away from
supplies that may not meet FSC certification requirements of Principles 2,3 and 4)
and an illegal logging category (to address corporate commitments in this area and FSC
Principle 1).
This Discussion Document is intended for discussion between the ENGO community,
corporations whose policies and/or consumption affect the conservation of Endangered Forests,
conservation groups and others who are interested in protecting biodiversity, and social
organizations working for ecological and cultural sustainability.
Wye Process
The World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund-US have acted as informal, ad-hoc
coordinators and facilitators of the effort.  ENGOs and some industry representatives have
provided input and/or attended regular meetings.  A preliminary scientific review has been
completed.
Next Steps in Wye Process
The ENGO community will brief and receive input from the wood products industry including
forest owners and managers, and wood purchasers at upcoming meetings.  Further input from the
scientific and ENGO communities is also expected, as well as continued work on mapping efforts
to identify Endangered Forests.
Endangered Forest Discussion Document Take-Home Messages to Purchasers
The proposed guidance to help companies meet their commitments to not source from

4Endangered Forests (EFs) has four take-home messages:
1.   Let's get moving: These definitions should serve as a catalyst for new corporate
actions to decrease consumption from EFs and increase consumption of FSC (or
equivalent) certified wood.
2. Avoid sourcing from areas until adequate conservation safeguards are in place. (The
term adequate conservation safeguards fully incorporates the WWF ecoregional
planning concept of locally led multi-stakeholder planning processes to determine
representative protected areas).
3. Work to source from areas that are not likely to be EFs and are therefore more likely
to meet FSC (or equivalent) certification requirements.
4. Avoid areas where securing legal sources of wood is highly unlikely and/or there are
ongoing human rights and indigenous community rights violations.
The EF Discussion Document IS…IS NOT…
The following describes what the Discussion Document is and is not - in the eyes of the
proposing ENGOs:
IS….
1. A work in progress whose goal is to protect endangered forests.
2. A document for further discussion.
3. A vision statement on EFs and EF commitment implementation.
4. A set of proposed definitions to guide EF identification by wood product purchasers.
5. A set of proposed purchaser actions in EFs.
6. A proposed corporate methodology for EF implementation.
7. A set of guidelines against which producers can assess progress towards reducing pressure on
EFs.
8. Intended to encourage industry to engage sooner rather than later in joint solutions processes
with local/regional groups.
9. Designed to provide a broad framework based on a precautionary principle that will
ultimately defer to the outcomes of the local stakeholder processes.
10. A set of broad biological and ecological categories of endangered forests, which our scientists
support.
11. Complimentary to other HCVF definition and identification processes underway including
efforts by FSC, Proforest, NatureServe, etc.
IS NOT……
1. A statement about what committed companies are expected to have already implemented.
2. A set of prescriptive directions to local ENGOs on how they should make decisions about
conservation planning priorities.
3. The official position of the organizations whose members have drafted it.  There are still a
number of issues to be resolved and we are now inviting a wider community of stakeholders
to help with this effort.

5SIX UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE ENDANGERED FORESTS FRAMEWORK
1. Endangered Forests Should be Protected.  Some high conservation value forests
(HCVF) or portions of HCVF are so rare, threatened, or ecologically vulnerable, and are
of such global biological or cultural importance that any logging or commercial use could
irreparably damage their conservation value.  These forests are ‘endangered’ and should be
protected.  Accordingly, EFs should not be used for extractive purposes unless or until
adequate conservation safeguards (see glossary for definition) are in place.  Thus, we use
the term 'endangered' more broadly than is usually used in scientific literature.
2. Participating ENGOs are united in their commitment to further the EF process.  
The coalition is committed to reaching organizational consensus and to producing maps
and furnishing new data to enhance use of the framework.  Participating ENGOs are
willing to help corporations analyze, and implement recommendations outlined below.
3. A regionally differentiated approach is needed. Application of these
recommendations should reflect the ecological and socio-cultural diversity of the systems
we seek to protect.
4. Multi-stakeholder planning is essential.   (See glossary).  If a local or regional multi-
stakeholder conservation planning process has delineated EFs in a locality or region, those
delineations should be used together with ecoregional or global analyses.  We want to
encourage areas for which information on EFs is already available1, or areas with strong
local stakeholder processes,2 to conduct more refined analyses of EFs.
5. EF protection should not be delayed by forest certification processes.     Protection
and conservation is the top priority and unmet need in EFs.  This document provides
wood purchasers a first step towards comprehensive guidance on how to avoid sourcing
from EFs in high conservation value forests that have not yet been FSC (or equivalent)
certified.   Certification (see glossary), including FSC certification, is not always an
appropriate or effective policy tool for achieving EF protection.  Moreover, only 2-3% of
forests are currently FSC (or equivalent) certified, so direct and targeted EF identification
and protection is the best way to quickly secure needed protections in many high
conservation value forests.  Together FSC and EF tools help companies meet dual 
commitments to move towards FSC certified products and away from sourcing in EFs.
6. Knowledge about the extent and boundaries of EF must be quickly improved,  in
order to protect these areas, and provide much needed guidance to companies. Currently
                     
1 For example, such information already exists for the U.S. National Forests.
2 For example, the central coast of British Columbia, Canada has a strong local stakeholder process
underway.

6available lists and maps of EFs will evolve for example, as new protected areas are
established, indigenous land rights are addressed, illegal logging is reduced, or land use
designations changed.
INTRODUCTION TO IDENTIFYING ENDANGERED FORESTS
We have taken several steps in our effort to define and identify Endangered Forests. 
First: We adopted four biological and ecological categories (Categories 1-4 in Section One).  Each
category contains a clear definition and rationale. We have also listed information sources and
tools currently used to identify and locate these forests and provided examples of where
candidate areas are located. The information sources listed will help identify and locate EFs.
Second: We moved beyond the corporate purchasing commitments specific to Endangered
Forests by adding Category 5, a social category (to direct companies away from supplies that
may not meet FSC certification requirements of Principles 2.3 and 4), and Category 6 on illegal
logging (to address corporate commitments in this area and FSC Principle 1).
Note:  Forest certification schemes (FSC and others) use similar concepts and terms to those
outlined in Categories 1-6. We therefore would expect that those processes would result in the
identification of very similar forest area categories that which would be labeled or referred to as as
"high conservation value forests", "forests of exceptional conservation value" or the relevant term
used for forest ecosystems of high conservation value.
Third: Within each category we identified a key subset of priority forest areas that we refer to as
'Endangered Forests' (EFs).
Fourth: For EFs we propose specific purchaser actions to be implemented.
SECTION 1: DEFINING ENDANGERED FORESTS: BIOLOGICAL AND
ECOLOGICAL CATEGORIES
The purpose of this section is to define endangered forests within biological and ecological
categories.  These definitions are proposed for use by corporations that have made commitments
to not source from endangered forests.
Category 1: Naturally Rare Forests
These forests are rare due to natural conditions. They are limited to very small areas of
the globe, and contain unique biodiversity.  There is good data on candidate areas but
more detailed analysis is needed to identify the best remaining areas that should be
considered for protection.  Priority is placed on remaining undeveloped forest fragments
in these areas.

7Definition: Naturally rare forests are restricted in occurrence and extent globally.
EF Definition:  All remaining undeveloped forest fragments within naturally rare forests.
Rationale:  Many major forest types are relatively widespread on Earth.  A combination of
climatic, geological, topographic, and ecological factors limit other forest types to extremely small
areas of the globe.  These forests contain many unique species and communities which are
adapted only to the conditions found in these rare forest types.  The most commonly cited
examples of rare forest types are: Mediterranean climate forests (five regions worldwide),
temperate rain forests (seven regions worldwide), and tropical cloud forests.
Information Sources and Tools :
Rare Forests – National Heritage Database information from Natureserve (e.g., in North America,
forested G1 – G3, N1 – N3, and S1 - S3 communities).
Ecoregions - WWF’s Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World is available at
(www.worldwildlife.org/science). All of the world’s ecoregions are mapped and ecoregion
descriptions detailing outstanding biological features by ecoregion can be downloaded for free.
Global forest cover -  U-MD DeFries.   U.S. forest cover  – EPA MRLC.
N. Alaska and Canada forest cover - best available land cover datasets based on AVHRR.
Examples:
Naturally Globally Rare:  Mediterranean Climate Forests (N. America, S. America, S.W.
Australia, Eurasia, S. Africa), Temperate Rainforests (N. America, Chile (S. America), Tasmania),
Tropical Cloud Forests (C. America, S. America, Asia).
Category 2: Anthropogenically Rare Forests
These are forests so heavily affected on a global or ecoregional scale by humans that over
70% of the forests have been converted and they have therefore become rare. There are
good data on candidate areas but more detailed analysis is needed to identify the best
remaining areas that should be considered for protection. Priority is placed on the
identification of remaining undeveloped forest fragments as well as remaining primary and
old growth forests.
Definition:   Anthropogenically rare forests include remaining areas of forests that are globally or
ecoregionally rare as a result of historical human activities.  They include forests in an ecoregion
where at least 70% of original forest type has been converted.
EF Definition:  All remaining undeveloped forest fragments, primary forests, and old growth
forests within anthropogenically rare forests.
Rationale:  Current ecological theory states that as natural habitats decline in area, extinction
rates increase and vital ecological and evolutionary processes are jeopardized.  Many scientific
analyses indicate that 70% of the forests affected as a cut-off at which biological losses will
steadily increase.

8Information Sources and Tools :
Global forest cover - U-MD DeFries.
Regions - WWF’s Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World  is available at
www.worldwildlife.org/science .
U.S. forest cover - MRLC. 
N. Alaska and Canada forest cover - best available land cover datasets based on AVHRR.
Examples:
Anthropogenically Globally Rare:  Atlantic forests South America, Lowland Tropical
Rainforests in Indonesia, Tropical Dry forests of Thailand and Costa Rica .
Anthropogenically Ecoregionally Rare:  G1 – G3 communities.
Category 3: Intact (Frontier or Near-frontier) Forests
Intact forests are basically large, unfragmented blocks of natural forests. Their minimum
size tends to vary by country (as established by local consensus) from as little as 5,000
hectares (Chile) to 20,000 (Canada) to 50,000 (Russia) hectare blocks. There are good
data on candidate areas worldwide and a comprehensive effort underway to identify the
best remaining areas that should be considered for protection. Closer looks at these areas
with increasingly refined data tend to result in candidate area size reduction.
Definition :  Intact forests are forests unaffected by habitat fragmentation and other large-scale
human activities over time periods long enough to allow natural forest structure, composition and
functions to be determined primarily by naturally occurring ecological processes (e.g., natural
regeneration, natural levels of disturbance, including fire and flooding, scale, frequency and
intensity of natural disturbance regimes, and gap dynamics).  Intact forests are dominated by
indigenous tree species, are naturally seeded, and are large enough to support viable populations
of indigenous species associated with that forest type and to withstand natural disturbances
without losing their resilience to maintain the full range of natural composition, structures, and
functions.
EF Definition:  Intact forests that do not have adequate conservation safeguards or transitional
conservation strategies in place.
Rationale:  Maintenance of intact blocks of forests is necessary to assure periodic, long-term,
large-scale disturbances; migration paths and habitats of wide-ranging species; and examples of
high integrity forests (i.e., uncompromised by species invasions, unmodified nutrient flow, and
hydrologic processes).
Information Sources and Tools :
Global Forest Watch maps of intact forests can be combined with ecoregional conservation
assessments by WWF, TNC and others to define intact forests and to determine the extent of
representation of the ecosystem’s protected area system.  For those regions where detailed
mapping of intactness has not yet been completed, large roadless forest blocks can be used as a 

9proxy measure of intactness.3
Data set availability for intact forests:
GFW: Russia completed. Canada first draft completed June 2001. Alaska draft September 2002.
U.S. Pacific Northwest: Intactness data analysis underway by CBI and others.
Proxy measures:
WRI Frontier Forests  report.
GFW has mapped large low access roadless areas in Indonesia, Venezuela, and Central Africa.
Examples :
Areas within boreal Canada, boreal Russia, Indonesia, Venezuela, Alaska, Chile, U.S. Northern
Rockies, western arc of the Amazon, Congo Basin, and the New Guinea lowland forests.
Category 4: Other Ecologically Important Forests
These are “the best of the rest”..  In other words, the remaining old growth patches left in
otherwise degraded and converted forest areas that are not anthropogenically rare at the
ecoregional level.  For the US, we address consistency with roadless area protection. 
Priority areas also include degraded forest areas of high restoration potential as part of
corridors and buffer zones for critically imperiled and imperiled and vulnerable species.
Definition :  In ecoregions where <30% of the original forest remaining is intact/primary/old-
growth, Other Ecologically Important Forests include remnant patches of undeveloped primary
and old growth forest, as well as secondary forests that serve as core habitat, important corridors,
or buffer zones for highly threatened, threatened and vulnerable native species.
EF Definition: Remaining primary and old growth patches; habitats of threatened, endangered
and sensitive species; and threatened, endangered and sensitive community types, roadless blocks
in the US,  forests within corridors and buffers that have been identified by regional conservation
studies as being of ecological importance, unless FSC certified.
Rationale:  Remnant patches or undeveloped forest fragments contain genetic, species, and
community diversity, that maintain (1) the potential for ecological resilience and resistance to
catastrophic events; (2) the potential for evolutionary changes; (3) the ecological blueprints for
restoration; (4) a reservoir of current and future human resources; and, (5) provide refugia for
forest-dwelling species when large-scale natural disturbances occur.
Information sources and tools:
Existing or ongoing mapping by WWF, Sierra Club, TNC and NatureServe (G1- G3, N1 – N3,
and S1 – S3 communities), CI, CBI, Global Forest Watch and others can be used to identify
ecologically significant forests in the United States.  In Europe, CORINE data can be used for the
same purpose.  WWF data can be used to identify ecoregions with under-represented protected

Data set availability for intact forests:
Forest cover (DeFries); Protected Areas – CBI, WRI, WCMC.
SECTION 2: DEFINING ENDANGERED FORESTS: SOCIAL AND LEGAL
CATEGORIES
The purpose of this section is to define social and legal categories of endangered forests. 
 We propose that Endangered Forests include forests where there are ongoing human and
indigenous rights violations and forests from which wood is harvested or transported illegally. 
These definitions go beyond the corporate purchasing commitments specific to Endangered
Forests by adding Category 5: a social category (to ensure consistency with FSC certification
requirements and address corporate commitments to move towards FSC (or equivalent)
certification), and Category 6: an illegal logging category (to address corporate commitments in
this area.)
Category 5: Human and Indigenous Rights
EF Definition:  Endangered forests include forests where there are ongoing human rights
violations including violations of the rights of indigenous peoples.  Ongoing human and indigenous
rights violations include:
a) Forest management that is undermining or threatening to undermine the rights of local people
to life, their customary lands, physical security, livelihood and a healthy environment;
b) Forest management where there is conflict between stakeholders over the failure to respect
the rights and entitlements of forest-dwellers and forest dependent communities;
c) Operations where indigenous rights are not secure and indigenous peoples are unable to
provide genuine prior and informed consent for forestry operations as expressed through their
own representative institutions;
d) Forest management regimes that contravene international human rights standards.
Rationale: As many as 1.6 billion people worldwide depend on forests for their basic needs.  
For these people, forest destruction means loss of livelihood, cultural collapse, increasing
poverty and the denial of their internationally recognized human rights.  Although international
recognition of rights of forest peoples, particularly indigenous peoples has advanced globally,
human rights abuses continue.  Indigenous peoples often do not have information, skills and
funding necessary to make use of existing international human rights agreements.
Information Sources and Tools :
Dependable information concerning regions, operators and operations associated with human and
indigenous rights abuses in the context of forest management should be sought from locally

11affected communities and national and international civil society organizations tracking forestry
and human rights issues, in the relevant country or region.
FERN (see report Fear in the Forest - http://www.fern.org), Amnesty International
(http://www.amnesty.org), RAN (http://www.ran.org);  EIA (http://www.eia-international.org)
World Rainforest Movement (http://www.wrm.org.uy)
Category 6: Illegal Forest Products
EF Definition:   Legality is defined by local and national law within source countries and by
relevant international treaties.4 Illegally harvested and transported forest products include goods
that have been confiscated and then returned to the market. Ownership of illegally harvested
forest products throughout the distribution chain is included in this category.
Rationale:    Illegal logging robs national and sub-national governments, forest owners and
local communities of significant revenues and benefits, damages forest ecosystems, distorts
timber markets and forest resource assessments and acts as a disincentive to sustainable
forest management. International trade in illegally harvested timber … exacerbates the
problem of illegal logging. Better information on the extent of the problem is a prerequisite to
developing practical and effective counter measures.  (G8 Action Program on Forests, May
1998)
Information Sources and Tools:
Information about illegal forestry and illegal trade in forest products is available from a wide range
of non-governmental and governmental sources. Purchasers can play an important role in ensuring
this information is widely disseminated by collecting information about illegal forestry relevant to
their purchases and making this information accessible to government and non-government
agencies, and to independent review.

12SECTION 3: CORPORATE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENDANGERED FOREST
COMMITMENTS 
This Section has two parts. Part 1 outlines (by category) the proposed purchaser actions
for each Endangered Forest sub-category.  Part 2 outlines a proposed methodology for
implementing corporate commitments for responsible forest product procurement.
PART 1: PROPOSED PURCHASER ACTIONS
Category 1: Naturally Rare Forests
Proposed Purchaser Action in Naturally Rare EFs : Purchasers will immediately end
procurement of forest products from all remaining undeveloped forest fragments (see glossary for
definition) within naturally rare forests.
Category 2: Anthropogenically Rare Forests
Proposed Purchaser Action in Anthropogenically Rare EFs : Purchasers will immediately end
procurement of forest products from all remaining undeveloped forest fragments, primary
forests, and old growth forests within anthropogenically rare forests.
Category 3:  Intact (Frontier or Near-frontier) Forests
Proposed Purchaser Action in intact EFs : Purchasers will discontinue procurement from intact
forests until adequate conservation safeguards are in place (see glossary for definition).
When adequate conservation safeguards are not yet fully in place, as a transitional strategy,
purchasers may only resume procurement from intact forests when:
(1) an independent scientific study has identified candidate areas for representative
protected area systems at multiple spatial scales and is supported by a majority of
conservation organizations;
(2) a moratorium is in place on logging in the candidate protected areas identified by this
study until a regional conservation planning process defines a permanent
representative protected area system; and

13(3) the forest operation is FSC certified.
Category 4: Other Ecologically Important Forests
Proposed Purchaser Actions in other ecologically important EFs : Within Other Ecologically
Important Forests, purchasers will discontinue procurement from:
(1) remaining primary and old growth patches;
(2) habitats of threatened, endangered and sensitive species; and threatened, endangered
and sensitive community types;
(3) in the United States, roadless blocks; or
(4) forests within corridors and buffers that have been identified by regional conservation
studies as being of ecological importance, unless FSC certified.
Category 5: Human and Indigenous Rights
Proposed Purchaser Action in EFs : Purchasers will end procurement of forest products where
there are ongoing violations of human rights, including indigenous and customary rights to forest
resources, whether at the operational or regional level.
Purchasers only procure from areas where:
 (1) suppliers have obtained informed consent from indigenous or forest dependent
communities, and
(2) suppliers have suspended forest operations, including logging and road building
activities, in the most contentious areas.
Category 6: Illegal Forest Products
Proposed Purchaser Action in EFs : 
(1) Purchasers immediately will discontinue procurement of illegal forest products.
(2) Purchasers will discontinue procurement from regions where illegal logging is prevalent5 or
where illegal forest products are traded6 unless suppliers provide independently verified
proof of legality along the distribution chain.
PART 2: METHODOLOGY FOR IMPLEMENTING CORPORATE COMMITMENTS
FOR RESPONSIBLE FOREST PROCUREMENT
                     
5 For example, including, Indonesia, Brazilian Amazon, Cambodia, Russian Far East, and Central
Africa.
6 For example, including Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Philippines, and China for Asian
wood products; Italy, France, and Spain for African hardwoods, and the United States.

14In this section we propose a series of measures applicable to current and future Endangered
Forest corporate commitment participants.   They outline a transparent and methodological
progression - from declaration of a corporate commitment to concrete actions - that would
provide confidence to consumers and suppliers, and win strong support of ENGOs supporting 
this document as well as the public.
The ENGOs participating in the Endangered Forests discussions stand prepared to assist
purchasers in developing strategies and plans for implementing this methodology, and expect to
play a fair but rigorous role in monitoring progress.
1. Articulate the commitment.  The commitment should be based on a dedication to effective
environmental stewardship, within a framework of long-term financial viability. 
Commitments that are based on risk management or conflict avoidance are unlikely to lead to
systematic improvements in environmental performance. The organization’s leaders should
develop the details of implementing a practical and meaningful corporate commitment to
forest conservation.  A conservation mission statement that compliments the overall
corporate mission statement is needed.  The effort must have dedicated support at the CEO
and Board of Directors levels.
2. Communicate the commitment to suppliers .  Provide suppliers with the definition of
endangered forests, which will guide them in determining where endangered forests are, and
will outline the conditions to be met for the company to establish or maintain purchasing
commitments.  Inform suppliers of the corporation’s decision to stop purchasing from
endangered forests, and that they will stop purchasing from companies that exploit or degrade
endangered forests.  Indicate that preference will be given to companies that limit their
operations (worldwide) to non-endangered forests and those that are committed to obtaining
Forest Stewardship Council certification. 
3. Educate top management ..  For-profit corporations are at ease with business and trade
concepts, but often lack a detailed understanding of forest conservation, forest certification,
and biodiversity topics.  Staff that is charged with using those concepts should be trained in
the relevance and importance of key concepts.  Concepts such as ‘endangered forest,’ ‘intact
forest,’ ‘old growth forest,’ ‘threatened ecosystem,’ and ‘high conservation value forest’ have
technical meanings that affect the “buy-don’t buy” recommendations of ENGOs and the
certifiability of the forest.  Key corporate staff should understand the technical meanings of
these and other terms, to use recommendations effectively, and to achieve least cost and most
important conservation results for the forest areas from which they source.
4. Integrate with corporate business systems.  The ‘responsible purchasing’ commitment should
be integrated with business objectives such as growth strategies, position descriptions,
inventory management, delivery schedules, and other organizational and management efforts.
5. Create a high profile forest conservation management team.  Respected and authoritative
leaders of the corporation should lead the effort to make the commitment a reality.  Top

15managers of purchasing, accounting, floor sales, demonstrations, and corporate maintenance
should be represented in the forest conservation team.
6. Encourage broader approaches for environmental and social responsibility by the
corporation.  For more general corporate cultural shifts ENGOs, scientists, direct program
providers such as FSC, or environmental consultants can help the corporation improve the
corporate culture by balancing environmental and social responsibility with economic
viability.  Many of the ENGOs participating in this effort have technical and scientific
resources that can support developing corporate conservation programs.
7. Develop plans and strategies to begin concrete, specific actions within the first year.  Actions
should be taken as soon as maps and analyses are presented.  Where FSC certification or
endangered forests maps are not available, it will be necessary to develop strategies for
determining the presence or absence of endangered forests in major supplying regions.
8. Establish an internal system for tracking product flow.  Require all suppliers to make
available. forest-of-origin data for all products.  This is essential if the company is to
accurately determine whether its forest products are derived from endangered forests. 
Establish a procedure for frequent review of these data by the management team.
9. Provide independent auditors information that helps verify if forest-of-origin data are
accurate.  This may require suppliers to pay an annual audit fee that is then used to hire
qualified third party auditors capable of determining true chain-of-custody. If a company is
found to have provided inaccurate chain-of-custody information intentionally, it will be put
on probation.  If subsequent audits find similar evidence, it should be terminated as a
supplier.
10. Provide market incentives to supplier companies that aggressively move to  1) seek FSC
certification across their operations once FSC regional standards have been endorsed by FSC
and regional NGOs; 2) provide technical support and encourage suppliers to contribute data,
in order to develop maps, analysis and other information tools needed to implement
purchasing agreements, and 3) encourage independent conservation area design efforts and
stakeholder resolution processes in the endangered forests in which they operate.
11. Take concrete steps to educate customers of the environmental values associated with active
avoidance of endangered forest sources, along with the benefits of buying wood from
environmentally responsible sources.  This would include advertising, in-house materials,
employees who assist customers, etc.
12. Provide annual reports to (and/or participate in direct, substantive dialogues with)
participating ENGOs and the general public.  This will maintain transparency about the goals
and strategies of the corporation, and will inform ENGOs of progress that has been made. 
The reports should also specify where ENGOs could provide assistance to the corporation to

ANNEX 1:  Glossary of Terms Used In Endangered Forest Categories
Adequate conservation safeguards:   Establishment of a representative protected area system
acceptable to all concerned stakeholders including conservation organizations that results from
either a multi-stakeholder conservation planning process, or a conservation design process
carried out by scientists.  In addition, control of illegal logging, and independent third-party
certified forest management (FSC or equivalent) are required as adequate conservation
safeguards.
Certification:  Certification is the assessment of a forest against a standard and confirmation by
the certification body that forest management conforms to the standard, or that the nature of any
non-conformances, individually or together, is within the limits of acceptability laid down by the
certification scheme.  Owners of certified forests may make claims about the quality of their forest
management in accordance with the rules laid down by the certification or accreditation body. 
The FSC certification system is the only credible certification process available in the marketplace
today7.
Ecoregion :  A large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of
natural communities that (a) share a large majority of their species and ecological dynamics, (b)
share similar environmental conditions, and (c) interact ecologically in ways that are critical for
their long-term persistence. (Olson et al. Bioscience. 2001)
Multi-stakeholder conservation planning process:   A process that has adequate time and
budgets to foster meaningful, informed, scientifically sound, and culturally appropriate
participation of all relevant parties.  Specifically, the process must:
Ensure that reasonable ranges of interests are participants in the process.
Provide for the protection and accommodation of legal and customary rights of indigenous

17peoples and rural people.
Ensure that each interest represented at the table is accountable to an identifiable, legitimate
constituency.
Use a decision-making process that is participatory and provides equal decision-making
authority for all interests---establish “level” negotiating tables.
Ensure that decisions are based on leading edge science and traditional ecological
knowledge, and that all interpretations are precautionary in nature.
Provide for a dispute resolution process that respects the rights and interests of all
participants, while adjudicating with priority given to application of the
precautionary principle.
Result in widespread support from stakeholders, including a majority of conservation
organizations, forest dependent people, and indigenous people.
• Include peer-review of the results by independent scientists.
Rare Forests:   Forests with only few records of occurrence. (E.g., in North America,
Natureserve’s forested G1 – G3, N1 – N3, and S1 - S3 communities.)8
Representation :  The protection of the full range of biodiversity of a given biogeographic unit
within a system of protected areas. (Ricketts et al. 1999)  To be ecologically effective,
representation must be achieved in all ecosystems at all ecological spatial scales.
Representative protected area system:  A protected area system consisting of core reserves,
buffers to core reserves, and linkages that provide for the persistence of viable populations of all
native species by encompassing representation of ecosystems and all community types, special or
unique features, and connectivity across ecological gradients and elevations of adequate size and
appropriate configuration to sustain key ecological processes.  The protected area system must be
designed in ways that consider its size, shape, ecological context, and the condition of the forest
landscape.
Roadless Block:  Large roadless forest areas that predict to provide sufficient contiguous habitat
to maintain viable populations of most species indigenous to those forest types.  Minimum size
depends on forest type.  For example, in North America, a roadless block is  a 2000 hectare or
larger forested block that has less than 0.5 miles of unpaved road per sq.mi., and no paved
roads.9
                     
8 G1 =Critically Imperiled (typically 5 or fewer occurrences or 1,000 or fewer individuals); G2 =
Imperiled (typically 6 to 20 occurrences or 1,000 to 3,000 individuals); G3 = Vulnerable (rare;
typically 21 to 100 occurrences or 3,000 to 10,000 individuals); G4 = Apparently Secure
(uncommon but not rare; some cause for long-term concern; usually more than 100 occurrences and
10,000 individuals); G5 = Secure (common; widespread and abundant).  Note:  “G” refers to global, or
rangewide status.  National (N) and State (S) status ranks also are assessed.

18Undeveloped Forest Fragments :  Non-intact forested areas of sufficient size to contain critical
ecological values (e.g., habitats for keystone and old-growth dependent species and other focal
species), in a landscape that has been significantly modified.
