1Ancient forests are defined here as the world’s 
remaining forests which have been shaped largely by natural events and which are little impacted by human activities.

forests: ecosystems and economies on the edge. Bryant D, Nielsen D and Tangley L (eds). WRI, New York).
3In Southeast Asia deforestation rates reached 2.9 
million ha per year between 1990 and 1995 – i.e. an area the size of Belgium each year. A recent report by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre attributes much of this deforestation to excessive cutting for timber – both legal and illegal – along with forest conversion to agricul-ture and cash-crop plantations. While reported deforesta-tion rates for tropical Oceania are lower at 151,000 ha per year, these forests remain under serious threat, particularly from Malaysian logging compa-nies (FAO (1999) State of the world’s forests 1999.

4Japan, a G8 member, is the single largest importer 
of timber from Asia-Pacific. The USA and EU coun-tries are also important.
5For example, in January 2000, the industry journal 
Tropical Timbers cited the level of illegal logging in 
Indonesia as “arguably the most important issue now facing the international hardwood trade”.

11 Letter from Colin Hunt to Jim Douglas (World Bank) 
20 March 2000.Indeed, no independent analysis of logging operations in PNG to date
has found a company complying with the full terms and conditions ofits logging permit. 
One of these issues, transfer pricing, has received regular attention in
PNG since the 1980s. Transfer pricing is a mechanism by which compa-nies to transfer profits offshore, by declaring a sale price which islower than the actual price received. The result for companies is thatthey can reduce or entirely eliminate their taxable profits in PNG andhold their real profit offshore; for PNG the result is loss of foreign currency and income. 
Because transfer pricing works through the collusion of the seller and
the buyer it is impossible to prove without full documentation.However, there are major anomalies in the trade data between PNGand Japan that indicate the scale of illegal trade. The PNG official logexport data for 1996 shows exports of 1,390,000 m
3at an average
price of $140 per cubic metre; Japan’s records show imports from PNGover the same period to be 1,852,000 m
3at an average price of $175
per cubic metre – a discrepancy of $130 million. 
More recently, in March this year, Colin Hunt of the National Research
Institute PNG wrote to the World Bank saying that there is still a “sub-stantial discrepancy” between the export figures for PNG logs and thecorresponding import figures in Japan
11. This discrepancy – of almost
US$50 per cubic metre of logs exported – could represent an estimatedloss in export earnings each year of up to $100 million.

frontier forest, with 
84 percent of what 
remains now threatened.

The few ancient forests in the countries of the Asia-Pacific
region are under threat. In Laos, Vietnam and Taiwan,Thailand, Burma and Cambodia, at least 90 percent of largeancient forest has already been destroyed. Malaysia has lost85 percent, and Indonesia and Papua New Guinea have lost72 percent and 60 percent respectively
1,2. Much of this is due
to excessive cutting for timber, a high proportion of which isillegal
3. Despite claims to the contrary by the G8 govern-
ments, a significant part of the trade in illegal timber is fuelled by demand from the international market
4.
Greenpeace is calling on all governments to stop their rolein this trade.Malaysia has already lost  85 
percent of its large ancient forests.

illegal timber trade: 
AAssiiaa--PPaacciiffiicc
June 2000

In April this year, Greenpeace documented illegal activities in the
global timber trade in its report Against the Law: the G8 and the
illegal timber trade . The report revealed that in Asia-Pacific, illegal
practices range from logging in protected areas to mis-classifyingspecies in export documents. It highlighted the impact of theregion’s high levels of illegal logging on the international market
5.
The response of G8 governments to the report has been to play
down the role of the international timber market in drivingdemand for the illegal production and trade of wood, and to arguethat this is largely a domestic issue
6. Thus, governments seek to
minimise their role in driving the illegal trade and limit theirresponsibility for its environmental and social impacts.
However, such arguments are clearly inconsistent with a recent
report from the industry journal Tropical Timbers which notes
that, “At the international level, the availability of cheap, illegallyfelled trees from Indonesia has led to a huge decrease in interna-tional plywood prices.”
7. Similarly, the independent environmen-
tal watchdog Global Witness reported in May this year that,“Illegal exports to all of Cambodia’s neighbours are continuous,whilst the logging concessionaires illegally log with impunity.”
8.
These comments suggest that illegal timber is flooding the inter-national market – far from the drop in the ocean that the G8 gov-ernments claim.Since the release of Against the Law , stories
of illegal logging throughout the Asia-Pacificregion have continued to hit the headlines:

Trespass and environmental crimes
(Solomon Islands)9
Illegality and logging are virtually synonymous in the
Solomon Islands. Illegalities range from invalid licencesand trespassing, to the breaching of labour conditionsand deliberate under-valuing of logs.  In addition,although no court of law has yet found a governmentminister guilty of receiving bribes from logging compa-nies, there is ample evidence to suggest this has beencommon practice.
One company at the heart of this issue is the South
Korean transnational Eagon Resources DevelopmentCompany Ltd. To date, at least six indigenous tribes havefiled legal proceedings against Eagon seeking compensa-tion for trespass.  In 1999, the High Court delivered itsfirst judgement in favour of landowners, when it foundEagon guilty of two separate counts of contempt of court. However, claims for environmental destruction and forest
conversion are still before the Court. In an assessmentcommissioned by the local Choiseul landowning tribesand the Public Solicitor’s office, breaches by Eagon of theterms of its licence include: harvesting of trees on landwithout licence or permission; pollution of local watersources; extraction of gravel from a sacred site for thebuilding of roads; illegal road construction; considerablelog waste (up to one -third left in the forest); felling ofprotected tree species; lack of rehabilitation of water-course crossings, roads and log landings; and significantdamage to burial grounds - where human remains havebeen scattered by the company’s bulldozers.
Transfer pricing (Papua New Guinea)
A recent report commissioned by Greenpeace10shows
that the PNG government has not only consistently failedto implement existing legislation but has repeatedly bro-ken national forestry law to allow powerful companiesaccess to new areas of forest. The report concludes thatillegal activity in the PNG timber industry is almost uni-versal and includes both the irregular allocation of per-mits and breaches of permits issued. 
Case studies Despite a halving of log exports since
the mid-Ninetees, logging in theSolomon Islands is still at twice theestimated sustainable yield.© Greenpeace/DorreboomOnce again, Greenpeace is calling on G8 governments
to honour their commitment to combat the illegal production and trade of wood and wood products. It demands that these governments:
•DO NOT buy illegal timber products
•DO NOT fund forest destruction through aid for 
unsustainable forestry
•DO NOT allow G8 countries to be markets for illegal 
timber
•DO buy wood products from sustainable certified 
forests
•DO provide urgent assistance to forest countries to 
tackle illegal logging
•DO increase the capacity for monitoring and 
transparency throughout the production and transport of wood and wood products globally
