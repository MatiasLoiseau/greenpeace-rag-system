This report critiques the handling  
of domestic policy aimed at Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) by the Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the way it has engaged with international REDD negotiations since the 2009 UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen. 
The poor governance and 
entrenched corruption that  has long characterised the PNG logging industry, together with a refusal to accept conditions for REDD funding and a growing dismissal of indigenous peoples’ rights, means PNG is not currently ready for REDD funding. This is unfortunate as future generations of Papua New Guineans and the country’s unique biodiversity could miss out on a positive alternative to continued destructive industrial logging. 
Greenpeace is a strong advocate 
for fast-start funding for REDD  if it is provided with strict preconditions for governance reform. Greenpeace has provided, and will continue to provide, advice and recommendations to the Government of PNG (GoPNG) on the measures that should be taken to advance its case for REDD money. Greenpeace’s key recommendations are a moratorium on new large-scale logging and agricultural concessions and a review of existing operations and stringent safeguards for indigenous peoples and biodiversity. 
This report offers recommendations 
for existing and prospective REDD donor countries and key conditions that must be met by the  GoPNG before REDD  financing occurs.

2 in troduction
There is no questioning the unique 
environmental and cultural importance of PNG. Covering the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, the country hosts one of the world’s largest and most diverse areas of remaining intact tropical forest. It also supports the Earth’s most diverse collection of cultures with over 850 languages. 
Yet PNG faces significant 
environmental and economic challenges. Much of the largely rural-based population does not have access to health or education services and one third of the population lives on less than US$1.25 a day.
1
Decades of industrial logging have not delivered the promised benefits of employment, improved health and education. Communities affected by logging have witnessed the loss or destruction of their forests and waterways, two things that are key  to their subsistence way of life. Today only 55% of PNG’s forests remain as intact forest landscapes,
2 much of 
which are at risk of being lost forever.
Due largely to unsustainable levels 
of logging, PNG has the second highest proportion of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use and land use change and forestry (LULUCF) in the world.
3  The appeal of receiving international financial assistance for REDD has seen PNG position itself as a leader within international REDD discussions. 
Yet this high level of influence has 
not been reflected in leadership on effective emission reductions or forest protection domestically. What national policy has been developed thus far aims to maximise potential international REDD funding rather than improve institutional and political capacity in PNG in order to implement effective REDD policy and measures.
Meanwhile, the search and investment 
for voluntary REDD carbon credits and schemes has ballooned in PNG as speculative investors and entrepreneurs look to get into a rapidly emerging but uncontrolled market. 
Corruption within PNG’s forest 
industry, disregard for land owner rights, inflated estimations of likely benefits from REDD and a lack of effective institutional systems in place do not engender confidence in the country’s ability to manage a funded institutional transition to a low carbon economy. Rather than leading to institutional reform, these allegations have resulted in the re-naming of relevant institutions to deflect blame. Recently introduced legislation marks a shift towards reduced government transparency and an increasing disregard of rights of its indigenous peoples – the owners of 97% of the country’s forests. 
PNG’s GHG emissions reduction 
plans focus largely on Reduced Impact Logging (RIL), sidelining the benefits of conservation. It also leaves many to conclude that PNG’s largely foreign-owned logging industry and pro-logging advisors retain undue influence over the GoPNG and its forest and REDD policies. 
For the GoPNG to provide an 
alternative to continued destructive logging and deforestation, which has shown no real benefit to its people, it must embark on a new way to engage with REDD policy at home and abroad. 
For prospective international REDD 
donors, the greatest way to support the people of PNG and achieve the objectives of REDD is to insist on legislative preconditions to accompany REDD funding.

The protection of PNG’s forests, 
in particular the intact and primary forests that store considerable volumes of carbon, is essential for mitigation of climate change. Much of this forest is threatened by logging and conversion for agriculture. The people of PNG, most of whom live a subsistence life relying on the forest, also have the right to development and improving their livelihoods. Therefore protection of their forests  for the global benefit is going to require international financing to compensate forgone development.
Only 55% of PNG’s forests today  
are in large blocks of primary forest (>500 km2) of minimally disturbed forest ecosystems known as Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs). 
“Primary forests are generally  
more carbon dense, biologically diverse and resilient than other forest ecosystems, including modified natural forests and plantations, accordingly, in largely intact forest landscapes where there is currently little deforestation and degradation occurring,  the conservation of existing forests, especially primary forests, is critical both for preventing future greenhouse emissions through loss of carbon stocks and continued sequestration, as well as for conserving biodiversity.”
 4
The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 
However, continued illegal and 
destructive logging and the conversion of forest areas into plantations could see much of PNG’s commercially accessible tropical forests cleared or degraded by 2021.
5  
With over 85% of PNG’s people living within the forest and surrounding rural areas, the forests play an important role in their livelihoods. However, access to education and health care remains a major development challenge. One third of the population lives on less than US$1.25 a day.
6 
Despite years of economic growth, industrial development has benefited only a very few, with many living in poverty.
7 PNG has traditionally been dependent on overseas aid to bridge the gap in it’s development needs  and rapidly increasing population.  The Australian Government,  for example, gave $457.2 million in aid to PNG in 2010.
8 This represents 
about 6% of PNG’s GDP in 2009.9 
With REDD finance there is the opportunity to marry the two goals  of GHG emissions reductions through forest conservation and development that improves the livelihoods of local communities. REDD finance could provide essential infrastructure and services such as education, health, communication and housing as well as support small-scale low-impact community use that maintains the carbon and biodiversity. 
However a major challenge is for 
PNG to transform its policies, laws and institutions, if it is to ready itself for increased international assistance via REDD. It will need to bring down the high levels of corruption and improve governance if donors are to be reassured that REDD financing can achieve the goals of emissions reductions, forest conservation and climate-compatible development.

5so mare’s Plan: fr om 
co
penhagen to 
ca
ncun
On 27 May 2010, at the Oslo Climate 
and Forest Conference, PNG Prime Minister Michael Somare outlined the country’s new plans for REDD and described it as a model for all prospective countries looking to benefit from REDD.
10 In his speech, 
he also identified the finance needed by PNG for a targeted cut of over 110 million tonnes of GHG emissions (between 2011 and 2015 and for a low carbon pathway leading to 1.1 to 1.5 billion tonnes of CO
2e reductions 
before 2030. 
While PNG has not yet lodged a 
National Communication on GHG emissions, deforestation and forest degradation emissions were estimated to be about 44 million tonnes in 2010.
11 
Somare identified that PNG needs ‘fast start funding’ of between US$715 million to US$1 billion in three phases over the period 2011 –2015:
•
 U
S $71 million for readiness 
payments 
•
 U
S $118 million for pilot program 
costs 
•
 U
S $526 – 811 million for 
performance based payments.12 Somare also criticised the current processes under the World Bank and the United Nations, calling them a tangle of “endless process and conditionality’s (sic)”. The implication being that safeguards for biodiversity and indigenous peoples’ rights (which Somare’s speech and the Coalition for Rainforest Nations (CfRN) presentation failed to address), are hindering the flow of REDD finance.
ru shed redd  Plans 
While PNG has made commitments  to reduced GHG emissions, it has relied heavily on analysis that inflates baselines and BAU scenarios,  and opts for expanded logging as the main REDD abatement strategy. Further to this, it has largely excluded local civil society including the customary (indigenous) forest holders, in the development of its climate-compatible plans, and is simultaneously undermining indigenous rights through amendments to the country’s laws.
In February 2010, PNG made a 
conditional commitment to the UNFCCC, under the Copenhagen Accord, that GHG emissions would  be reduced by about 30% from current levels and about 50% from BAU by 2030. GoPNG has developed an Interim Action Plan for Climate-Compatible Development (IAP).
13  T he plan 
purports to shape more climate-resilient development whilst almost doubling annual GDP growth and suggests a BAU emissions growth  of almost 40% over the next 20 years. However, there are a number of significant failures in the plan.
Firstly the GoPNG proposes the need 
to “clarify and rationalize the allocation of land between forestry, commercial agriculture, subsistence agriculture and other uses such as hunting”. Previously the government declared, “All natural forest carbon is owned by the customary landowners and managed by the state.”
 14 However, 
details are scant on how the state will ‘manage’ the carbon on the landowners behalf, especially how benefits will be shared. 
Outwardly it would appear that the 
GoPNG is proposing to effectively appropriate the rights over forest carbon, control any financial gains or sales, and decide on how any benefits are distributed. Customary landowners have not handed over their rights to the State to manage forest carbon and any attempt to do so would cause significant opposition  to REDD in PNG.

’s

6 With or without landowner support, 
the GoPNG proposes a 50% reduction in BAU GHG emissions by 2030. In effect the GoPNG proposes a 10% reduction in the estimated emissions of GHG in 2010, largely through changing forestry and agricultural practices. The IAP suggests that these reductions are conditional on an international agreement that will fund REDD, so that “Papua New Guineans are compensated for ecosystem services and emissions benefits they contribute to the world, and for the resulting changes to their incomes and livelihoods”. 
These could be seen as laudable 
goals if not for the fact that much of this abatement potential is estimated to be from Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) in existing operations (logging primary forest). Apart from some reference to conservation initiatives and community REDD projects,  no assessment of the GHG abatement opportunities of conserving the remaining primary forests in PNG is undertaken in the IAP. Conserving primary forest is the easiest and surest way of addressing the massive forest degradation caused by logging and instead using RIL to restore secondary logged over forests together with local processing. 
Indeed, under the BAU scenario, 
the IAP suggests that a 2% annual growth in log and agricultural commodity production and a doubling in production of minerals and oil and gas to 2030. As recent studies suggest, current rates of logging are unsustainable and most of the productive forest will be logged by the end of the decade. It is therefore questionable whether a 2% annual increase in log production to 2030 is even possible, even before considering whether landowner approval for the expansion is possible. 
Projected future BAU reference levels 
for REDD are poor standards to estimate and reward reductions.  An increasing reference level based on BAU projections assumes continuing deforestation and degradation and a built-in incentive to inflate such reference baselines: the higher the reference baseline assumed, the easier it is to generate ‘reductions’ and hence gain rewards. 
To ensure real emissions reductions 
PNG should follow Brazil’s lead and use an average ten year deforestation rate as a reference period – so that donors can base performance payments on actual reductions in deforestation and degradation. 
Furthermore, monitoring, reporting 
and verifying emission reductions based on RIL is difficult and expensive compared to the relatively simple spatial analysis required for reductions in area of primary forest logged or forest not cleared. It is therefore questionable that RIL can achieve genuine emission reductions in PNG.
Therefore, in order to develop 
a credible climate-compatible development strategy the GoPNG needs to shift to real emissions reductions through the protection of primary forest together with community development, RIL only in the millions of hectares of already logged over forests, and by allowing industrial agriculture expansion only  in already cleared areas.

Voluntary carbon trading has 
fuelled PNG’s ongoing ‘cargo cult’  15 
and the corruption of officials and parliamentarians.
16 Described as 
a classic 21st-century scam, it is known in PNG as mani bilong skai – sky money – because it appears to be selling air. Current proposals being rushed through undermine indigenous peoples rights, inflate BAUs and may allow logging. The government has sent mixed signals  on whether it supports them or not.
In addition to the scandals and 
corruption associated with logging, there have also been a number of events linking the PNG government to the so called ‘carbon cowboys’. Late in 2009, Opposition Leader Sir Mekere Morauta raised questions about claims of possible abuse of process and corruption purportedly based on official documents bearing signatures of high public officials,
 17 
including:
•
 T
he then Office of Climate Change 
and Environmental Sustainability (OCCES) involvement in issuing carbon credits certificates to foreign companies for forest areas in PNG.
•
 A d
ocument, signed by then 
Acting Secretary for Commerce and Industry and co-signed by the current National Planning Minister Paul Tiensten which confirms the receipt of US$200 million, paid by C.A. PNG Ltd to the GoPNG for  Carbon Credits totaling 33,333,333 tonnes.A week later, an Australian company was embroiled in a US $100 million carbon trading scandal in PNG. Carbon Planet admitted to giving fake carbon certificates that purported to represent a million tonnes of voluntary carbon credits issued by the UN. The company claimed that the certificates created by PNG officials were merely props to help persuade landowners to sign over the carbon rights to their forests.
18  A fter an investigation, the 
head of the PNG Office of Climate Change, Theo Yasause, was removed from office in 2010.
19 
In June 2010, two carbon projects have sought approval from the Climate Community and Biodiversity Standards. The Minister for Forests, Belden Namah endorsed the April Salome Project in East Sepik Province as the first pilot project in the country.
20  Y et conflicting this 
support, the PNG’s Office of Climate Change and development executive director Wari Iamo stated: “The PNG Government does not recognise and disavows any partnership, support, endorsement or any form of connection to the proposed projects.”
 21 
The second project, Kamula Doso in Western Province, is led by controversial Australian businessman Kirk Roberts.
22 In many of the 
voluntary carbon projects there have been concerns about landowner consent but in this case one tribal leader claims he was forced at gunpoint to sign away his lands to  the project. “They came and got me  in the night... police came with a gun.  They threatened me. They told me, You sign. Otherwise, if you don’t sign, I’ll get a police and lock you up,” said a leader of the Kamula Doso peoples Abilie Wape.
23 This is in spite 
of the fact that the Kamula Doso area is subject to a court injunction preventing carbon trade project development as well as a land  dispute – both are in process in  the PNG courts. 
In August 2010, both carbon trade 
projects and supposed REDD pilot schemes were the subject of criticism for “a litany of inconsistencies, dubious science, legal issues and concerns landowners will be ripped off.”
 24 The baseline data on the 
volume of timber appears to be inflated and there is a possibility  that both could allow logging. 
The GoPNG is sending conflicting 
messages in respect to voluntary carbon trading in PNG. On the international stage, the Prime Minister Michael Somare insists that his Government is opposed to voluntary carbon trading. Meanwhile back in PNG his Ministers and government officers tell a different story. GoPNG needs to urgently reign in all the voluntary projects until it has a robust policy framework that is supported across the entire government.

It is not surprising that there has been 
little international interest in PNG as a responsible recipient of REDD funding due to high levels of corruption, carbon cowboy scandals, and lack  of political leadership on REDD  in PNG. While Australia has pledged a small amount ($3m) for capacity building and UN – REDD is assisting (US $2.5m), PNG hasbeen ignored by many donor countries looking to support nations with progressive policy positions. 
PNG expressed interest in becoming 
a pilot country in the first and second round of investments in REDD pilots under the World Bank Forest Investment Program (FIP) but so  far has failed to be recommended  or approved by the Expert Group  of the FIP.
25 As an active architect of the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), PNG has also had surprising difficulty with securing funds. It’s first application was rejected largely due to a lack of consultation and significant information gaps. The FCPF has since accepted an amended application, but there is still some disagreement whether this will be in the form of Readiness Funding or will merely lead to PNG receiving technical assistance.
26 However, it has been 
reported that PNG has advised the FCPF that until other countries have received FCPF grants, it will only seek resources from UN REDD and not from the FCPF.
The GoPNG’s focus on reduced 
impact logging rather than forest protection is out of step with many key donors safeguards or aid finance policies. One of three objectives of the Norwegian  US $3 billion Climate and  Forest Initiative is “to promote  the conservation of natural forests to maintain their carbon storage capacity.” 
The German Ministry for Economic 
Cooperation and Development’s (BMZ) binding guidelines on forests (Forest Sector Strategy) states “primary forests, are the most important terrestrial reservoirs for carbon”, and “minimum ecological standards in forests with high conservation value, protection of the ecosystem’s biodiversity takes precedence over other goals”. 
The environmental safeguards of 
the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) state that: “Projects must not involve significant conversion or significant degradation of critical habitats or critical forests” and  “illegal logging of forests must be avoided.” All three governments also have safeguards on indigenous peoples’ rights.

Governance issues are also behind 
much of the reluctance of donor countries and bodies to provide capacity building finance to PNG. GoPNG’s plans for institutional changes and capacity building for climate-compatible development will do little to address PNG’s credibility gap with donors. Following Brazil’s example, PNG needs to establish a ‘PNG Forest Fund ’ with multi-
stakeholder governance to manage REDD preparedness, finances and benefit sharing.There have been suggestions reported by insiders that the failure of the GoPNG to effectively negotiate international finance flows for REDD is partly due to the US-born Climate Ambassador, Kevin Conrad, who reputedly retains a tight control  of PNG’s REDD policy.
Conrad has come under fire in the 
PNG parliament, primarily for his activities as an investment banker. Last year, Peter O’Neill, while opposition leader, attacked Conrad for his roles in a failed US $8m public 
servants’ housing scheme and in the  
US $17m collapse  
of commodity exporter Angco Coffee. Mal 
‘Kela’ Smith, the 
Governor of the 
Eastern Highlands,   said “We don’t trust him with the money carbon trading will bring.”  So far, the income from carbon trading remains mani bilong skai .
 27
The people of PNG deserve to have their country develop in a way that improves their livelihoods and protects their natural resources for future generations. REDD could provide funding to achieve this, or it could compound corruption and ongoing forest degradation. PNG needs to develop a coherent and inclusive plan that includes placing a moratorium on the logging of primary and intact forests, as well as on agricultural expansion into forested areas, and transforms its institutions and forest governance. Until then, it would be irresponsible for international funding bodies and donor governments to provide PNG with REDD funding.

10 Poor fore st Governance in P nG
Despite having some of the best 
forestry laws in the world, PNG’s reputation as a forest manager is very poor. Failure to control illegal and destructive logging means that the GoPNG is not ready to implement the even more technical and rigorous governance and enforcement structures that will be required  to ensure postive REDD outcomes. 
il legal and de structive 
Logging 
The majority of logging operations in PNG can be classified as environmentally, economically  and socially unsustainable
 28 and 
the vast majority of the logging in  PNG is illegal.
29
In one GoPNG review of 14 forestry operations between 2000 and 2005, none could be defined as legal and only one project managed to meet more than 50% of key criteria for  a lawful logging operation.
30 No logging concession is able to meet the International Tropical Timber Organisation’s (ITTO) criteria for sustainable logging and none, except for two community eco-forestry group schemes, have Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. 
Privately owned companies control all 
commercial timber production from natural forest areas. Malaysian owned companies dominate this commercial timber production. The role of the State is limited to inadequate monitoring and control.
co rruption in the

restry 
se
ctor 
The lack of financial accountability and oversight of government ministers and bureaucrats in PNG continues to undermine confidence in the country’s ability to deliver on key Government programs and equitably distribute  its wealth. Cronyism and self-interest seem to be the mantra of many in  the GoPNG and the forestry sector  in particular has a long history  of corruption and undue dealings. 
In the first admission of its kind 
by a PNG government official, the country’s Forest Minister, Belden Namah, told parliament in 2008 that logging companies routinely flout the law with the help of corrupt officials.
31 
He revealed that most of his departmental officers responsible for monitoring forestry operations had ignored the law and that many were ‘in the pockets’ of logging companies. Later in 2008, the Post-Courier newspaper linked unnamed PNG politicians to US $45m in a Singapore bank account, allegedly money earned through secret logging deals.
32
In 2009, PNG’s anti-corruption watchdog investigated the alleged payment of millions of dollars in bribes from the logging industry to ministers in the government of Prime Minister Michael Somare. Media reports in PNG claimed there was a money trail of corrupt payments from Singapore

11through Australia to Port Moresby, 
with $US 27m being withdrawn from one account around the time  of the last PNG national election.
33 
The Ombudsman Commission failed to determine whether the payments to the Singapore bank accounts were derived from a 2% take of logging export revenues from operations in the Gulf Province in southern PNG.
In its 2009 Global Corruption 
Report, Transparency International found that forestry in PNG had reached a critical juncture with current levels of logging said to be unsustainable, and the legality of many current concessions in doubt.
34 The report concluded that:“In Papua New Guinea, the effects of lobbying alongside other forms of corruption to influence decisions on forestry and logging have had a significant impact on the sustainability of the industry.”
 35 
In 2009, the PNG Auditor General said corrupt officials had stolen about $360m annually in recent years.
36 
In 2009, allegations were made that the shooting of PNG’s top corruption fighter, Chief Ombudsman Chronox Manek, was linked to corrupt parties wishing to silence him. This indicates just how far parties may be willing  to go to hide their activities.
37 Corruption remains a significant barrier to sustainability for PNG’s forestry sector. Despite a number of independent reports and investigations, some undertaken  by the PNG Ombudsman, the current GoPNG has failed to adequately recognise the problem and had placed little emphasis on measures  to rectify and punish individuals  for corruption. 
Any successful REDD program will 
require a high level of monitoring, good governance and transparency. There is a long way to go before the GoPNG can honestly claim to be ready to deliver such guarantees  and cleaning up its forestry sector must be a priority.

As mentioned, PNG has some of the 
most comprehensive environmental  laws relating to forests in the world.  This is due largely to the requirement for prior and informed consent of traditional landowners for forestry  or other natural resource exploitation. Yet these laws are currently under threat.
Thanks to PNG’s foresty laws,  
the judiciary has been used effectively  to limit some of the worst examples  of landowner abuse and environmental impact at the hands  of the PNG logging industry. However, the overloaded courts often take years  to hear a case.
38 
Only one day after Somare’s speech in Oslo earlier in 2010, the PNG Parliament broke parliamentary standing rules to amend its environmental laws. The amendments ban legal challenges against environmentally destructive projects if the project  is ruled to be of ‘national interest’
 39. 
These include removing landowners’ rights to challenge in court any development that impacts their land from future or continuing harm and  to be awarded compensation. 
Legal opinion suggests the 
Environment (Amendment) Act 2010 should be declared unconstitutional as it:
•
 b
reaches the right to protection 
and enforcement of landowners’ guaranteed rights under S57 of  the Constitution;
•
 b
reaches the landowners’ right  
to compensation under S58 of  the Constitution;
•
 b
reaches the landowners’ rights 
to unjust deprivation of property under S53 of the Constitution;  •
 i
s contrary to National Goal and 
Directive Principles – Goal 4; and
• breaches Constitution Section 
25(2) and Section 25(3).
In response to media criticism over the amendments, the Attorney-General, Ano Pala, issued a decree imposing a media blackout on debate saying, “your right to freedom of expression is now subsumed.”
 40 
The new laws, which have not gone unnoticed by civil society in PNG and are currently the subject of a Constitutional challenge, are perhaps the most obvious example of the GoPNG’s attempts to sideline indigenous rights. 
The 2009 policy which purportedly 
attempts to relieve customary landowners of their rights over  forest carbon (as detailed above)  is a specific example of the GoPNG seeking to exclude indigenous rights in the context of REDD. ©Greenpeace/Behring-Chisholm

40.	The	Advertiser	(2010).	Papua New Guinea Media gagged ,	The	Advertiser,	
Adelaide,	26	June,	p26.Unless measures are taken to 
protect PNG’s forests, the current pressure from destructive industrial logging looks set to continue. The	result	will	be	a	disaster	for	the	climate,	
the	people	of	PNG	who	rely	upon	the	
forests	and	the	critically	important	ecosystems	that	exist	within	them.	
REDD	offers	a	significant	opportunity	
for	the	future	of	PNG.	Yet	there	is	nothing	to	be	gained	by	the	international	community	or	by	the	people	of	PNG	when	forests	are	not	protected	from	destructive	and	illegal	logging	and	an	increasingly	desperate	and	corrupt	leadership	continues	to	bulldoze	the	rights	of	indigenous	peoples.
Ensuring	that	strict	
safeguards	for	people	and	
biodiversity	are	attached	to	REDD	payments,	such	as	those	proposed	by	the	German	Government	and	those	recommended	in	this	report,	will	ensure	the	maximum	environmental	and	social	benefits	are			achieved	and	that	countries	like	PNG	will	be	saving	their	forests	for		the	good	of	the	planet,	not	the	profits	
of	a	few.
