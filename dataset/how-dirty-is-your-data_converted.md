Executive Summary

Information Technology (IT) is disruptive. Largely for the better, IT
has disrupted the way we travel, communicate, conduct business,
produce, socialise and manage our homes and lives. This
disruptive ability has the potential to reduce our dependence on
dirty energy and make society cleaner, more efficient and powered
renewably. But as we applaud the positive, visible impacts and
measurable, game-changing potential of IT, we also need to pay
attention to what’s behind the curtain.

The ‘cloud’ is IT’s biggest innovation and disruption. Cloud
computing is converting our work, finances, health and
relationships into invisible data, centralised in out-of-the-way
storage facilities or data centres. This report seeks to answer an
important question about this trend, currently underway across the
globe: As cloud technology disrupts our lives in many positive
ways, are the companies that are changing everything failing to
address their own growing environmental footprint?

A quick glance at the letter grades on our Cloud Energy Report
Card (found on page 7 of this report) indicates that many IT brands
at the vanguard of this 21st century technological shift are
perpetuating our addiction to dirty energy technologies of the last
two centuries. We analysed the data centre investments of 10 top
global cloud companies and our findings show a trend across the
industry towards extolling the external effects of IT products and
services, while failing to take seriously the need to power this
widespread aggregation of the world’s information with clean,
renewable electricity.

Parts of our individual lives are becoming more efficient even as we
consume more. IT can enable us to cut down on energy intensive
practices by allowing us to work from home with teleconferencing
and telecommuting tools. We can now read our electricity use in
real time and manage it better accordingly. We can stream music
on the internet instead of taking up space on our hard drives. In
each of these examples, there is potential for us to choose to live in
less energy-intensive ways, cut our personal greenhouse gas
emissions, and shrink our footprint, individually and collectively.

The IT sector has a choice to make as well. As the demand for IT
products and services grows exponentially, in the US, Europe and
particularly in developing economies such as India and China, so
does the amount of data we produce globally. That information
requires physical storage and access to reliable electricity. Indeed
IT’s server farms are expanding and multiplying rapidly. In our
technologically interconnected world, data centres are the factories
of the 21st Century.

Whereas the factories of the Industrial Revolution got us into a
mess by burning coal and releasing carbon pollution into the
atmosphere, the factories of the Technology Revolution have the
ability to make use of better energy choices. In the following report,
we have looked at available information about the choices being
made today by major IT brands about where to site and how to
power their factories. It is clear that their commitment to
transformative change, which includes responsibility for their own
growing footprint, is still in question.

Additionally, much of the information that would allow us to assess
the net benefits of the cloud by also measuring the true
environmental cost of these localised, power-hungry data centres
is missing. IT companies, which broadly declare transparency a
major tenet of their business model, are highly secretive about their
own operations. This veil of secrecy makes it nearly impossible to
measure the actual benefits of cloud technologies or understand
the extent to which IT’s growing need for electricity is increasing the
use of dirty energy.

While a few companies have clearly understood that the source of
energy is a critical factor in how green or dirty our data is, and have
demonstrated a commitment to driving investment attached to
clean sources of electricity, the sector as a whole still seeks to
define 'green' as being 'more efficient'. This failure to commit to
clean energy in the same way energy efficiency is embraced is
driving demand for dirty energy, and is holding the sector back from
being truly green.

Throughout this report, we attempt to shed light on the state of the
cloud’s energy footprint by examining available information about IT
companies and their data centres. First, we have attempted to
explain and summarise the problem through examples of data
centre investment and a graded analysis of the infrastructure
choices of leading cloud companies. We also assessed best
practices and leading footprint mitigation strategies. Finally, we
have included some key recommendations for a sector that wishes
to be seen as green and transformative, but is coming up short on
it’s transparency and energy choices.

Will companies such as Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Google and
Yahoo! perpetuate the dirty energy issues of older, entrenched
industries, or will the innovative IT sector band together to
embrace a transformative business model that prioritises a
future built on clean, renewable energy?

Key learnings:

• Data centres to house the explosion of virtual information

currently consume 1.5-2% of all global electricity; this is growing
at a rate of 12% a year.

• The IT industry points to cloud computing as the new, green

model for our IT infrastructure needs, but few companies provide
data that would allow us to objectively evaluate these claims.
• The technologies of the 21st century are still largely powered by
the dirty coal power of the past, with over half of the companies
rated herein relying on coal for between 50% and 80% of their
energy needs.

• IT innovations have the potential to cut greenhouse gas

emissions across all sectors of the economy, but IT’s own
growing demand for dirty energy remains largely unaddressed by
the world’s biggest IT brands.

• There is a lack of transparency across the industry about IT’s own
greenhouse gas footprint and a need to open up the books on its
energy footprint.

• In emerging markets, where there is limited reliable grid electricity,
there is a tremendous opportunity for telecom operators to show
leadership by investing in renewable energy, but many are relying
on heavily polluting diesel generators to fuel their growth.

• Data centre clusters (Google, Facebook, Apple) are cropping up
in places like North Carolina and the US Midwest, where cheap
and dirty coal-powered electricity is abundant.

• IT companies are failing to prioritise access to clean and
renewable energy in their infrastructure siting decisions.

• Of the 10 brands graded, Akamai, a global content distribution
network, earned top-of-the-class recognition for transparency;
Yahoo! had the strongest infrastructure siting policy; Google &
IBM demonstrated the most comprehensive overall approach to
reduce its carbon footprint to date.

• Across the board, IT companies have thus far failed to commit to

clean energy in the same way they are embracing energy
efficiency, which is holding the sector back from being truly
green.

What do we mean when we talk about the ‘cloud’?

The term ‘cloud’ in the context of the IT sector does not have a
clear definition or application. It has been used in disparate ways
by the media and others outside the IT sector. The term has been
broadly applied to a range of internet-based platforms and
services (Gmail, Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, etc) that share a
common characteristic of storing or delivering data from an
online source to your PC, laptop, iPad and smartphone via a
broadband internet connection.

However, many experts in the IT sector would insist that the term

‘cloud computing’ be distinguished from what is otherwise ‘the
internet’ and applied only to subscription-based or pay-per-use
services that, in real time over the internet, extend existing IT
capabilities.

To keep pace with the common vernacular and also to avoid
unnecessary ambiguity, this report will use the term ‘cloud’ to
describe energy and resources used broadly with online
services, and will refer as needed to ‘cloud computing’ as a type
of IT computing services for hire within the online ecosystem.

Introduction

"History tells us that
systems are most fairly governed
when there is an open and
transparent dialogue between the
people who make decisions and those
who are affected by them. We believe
history will one day show that this
principle holds true for companies as
well, and we’re looking to moving in
this direction with you."

Facebook founder and
CEO Mark Zuckerberg

The spread of mobile communication and information technology
(IT) is changing how we communicate, relate and manage our daily
lives at astounding speeds. Current estimates of our global
communications spending for 2011 will reach $4.34 trillion US
dollars, and is forecasted to top $5tn in the year 20131.

The instant access to information provided by smartphones, the
internet and cloud computing is powerful and, in some cases,
allows people around the world to ‘leapfrog’ previous stops on the
pathway to development. Accelerated technological iteration
brings better means of communication, on a bigger scale, than had
previously seemed possible.

But the ongoing, global delivery of entertainment and media via
services such as Google, iTunes, Twitter and Facebook is only one
small example of a much larger shift to digitisation. Many major
sectors of the service economy are rapidly moving from
conventional business and delivery models to one that is delivered
online.

We have generated 1.2 zettabytes of digital information (zettabyte
=1 trillion gigabytes or 250bn DVDs) with our tweets, YouTube
videos, Facebook status updates, iTunes downloads, emails and
other data transfers. Additionally, there are five billion mobile users
worldwide, and over 50bn mobile connections are predicted by
20202 as smart meters and other ‘smart’ devices are added to
online networks. The size of the digital world is predicted to
continue to increase by a factor of 44 by 20203.

This societal shift to moving 1s and 0s instead of atoms and mass
has the potential to significantly reduce our footprint on the planet
and achieve a more sustainable model for housing the soon-to-be
7 billion neighbours we share it with. However, since the ‘cloud’
allows our digital consumption to be largely invisible, arriving
magically with the tap of the ‘refresh’ button in our inboxes or onto
our smartphones and tablets for immediate access, we may fail to
recognise that the information we receive actually devours more
and more electricity as our digital lives grow.

The data centres that house this explosion of digital information
currently consume more than 3% of US electricity, and
approximately 1.5% to 2% of global electricity, growing at a rate of
approximately 12% annually.4 Electronic devices account for 15%
of home electricity use, and are predicted to triple by 2030,
equivalent to the electricity demand of the US and Japan residential
market combined.

And yet, despite the IT sector’s stated commitment to
transparency and openness, it remains secretive about its energy
use and carbon footprint at a time when the world is facing the
potential for catastrophic climate change.

Our energy future and our ability to build the clean energy economy
are impacted by choices we make, large and small, every day. A
choice to prolong our addiction to dirty energy sources instead of
choosing clean sources of energy, and the economic and
environmental benefits that come with that choice, will have lasting
consequences. This report seeks to illuminate the choices of major
global IT brands as they compete in a global race to construct a
new reality on the cloud.

This report covers:

• Choices that major IT brands are making as they set up cloud
infrastructure and the energy consequences attached to those
decisions;

• An assessment of green computing leadership, highlighting the

good and the bad; and

• Recommendations for the IT sector on how to show bold

leadership and green the cloud.

* Clean Energy Index and Coal Intensity are calculated based on estimates of power demand for evaluated facilities
[http://www.greenpeace.org/cloudcomputingfacilities]

** AWS was provided facility power demand estimates to review. AWS responded they were not correct, but did not provide alternative estimates. Using
conservative calculations, Greenpeace has used the best information available to derive power demand, and have decided to publish and invite AWS to
be transparent and provide more accurate data for their facility power demand.

*** Google was provided facility power demand estimates to review, and indicated they substantially exceeded Google's current electricity demand, but
did not make additional information available.
Given that these estimates are based on maximum power of each facility, and not estimates of current use, we elected to publish and invite Google to
provide current data on energy footprint and carbon consumption.

Data is power: clean or dirty?

Our global addiction to dirty energy (fossil fuels and nuclear power)
has catastrophic impacts on the health of our societies and the
global environment. As our addiction grows larger, so does the size
of the problems: oil spills, nuclear accidents and widespread health
effects from air pollution. And the biggest crisis of them all is climate
change. Scientists have warned us that global CO2 emissions must
peak by 2015, and decline afterwards, if we hope to avoid a
permanent and planetary crisis.

Every sector in the economy must take responsibility for reducing
the use of dirty energy, particularly the IT sector, which stands to
profit from an increase in the use of technological clean energy
solutions. Greenpeace sees great potential for the IT sector to
transform how we generate and manage our energy needs. In fact,
we cannot achieve the level of reduction need to protect the planet
without IT energy solutions that will allow us to shift away from dirty
energy sources and build our economic and planetary prosperity
on clean sources of energy.

But despite the speed and ingenuity of the devices and networks
that deliver this information to us, and their potential to make a
positive contribution to cutting carbon out of many of our daily
activities, the key elements of 21st Century digital infrastructure are
still primarily powered by 19th and 20th Century dirty energy - coal
and nuclear power - which are largely responsible for our
catastrophic levels of global pollution.

The IT industry often points to the cloud or cloud computing as the
new, green model for our IT infrastructure needs, but few
companies provide data that would allow us to objectively evaluate
these claims. In contrast to the functionality of their products, there
is a pervasive lack of transparency regarding the environmental
impact and energy consumption of IT operations. It is increasingly
troubling that IT companies characteristically refuse to disclose the
amount of electricity consumed, carbon emitted, or nuclear waste
produced as a result of maintaining our digital infrastructure.

Efficiency is not enough

Companies usually seek to shift a discussion of rising IT emissions
to the sector’s tremendous gains in energy efficiency and examples
of how technology is helping to reduce energy consumption
elsewhere. It is true that the IT sector has steadily demonstrated
improvements in energy efficiency. It has made significant strides
toward reducing the energy consumption of its data centres after
many years of neglect.

But as the electricity demand of IT remains on the rise, efficiency
can only slow emission growth. In order to achieve the reductions
necessary to keep the sector’s emissions in check and maintain
safe levels of global greenhouse gases, clean energy needs to
become the primary source of power for IT infrastructure. A few
companies have taken steps to steer their infrastructure
investments toward cleaner energy, but the sector as a whole
remains focused on rapid growth. The replacement of dirty sources
of electricity with clean renewable ones is still the crucial missing
link in the sector’s sustainability efforts.

IT's energy impact
is hard to measure

Numerous studies have attempted to quantify the greenhouse gas
emissions savings that IT can enable across the global economy.
There is strong evidence of IT’s potential to create efficiency gains
and cut carbon emissions by catalysing dramatic behavioural and
energy-use changes. In developing countries, such as India and
China, it is now possible to grow the economy with these
technologies, ‘leapfrogging’ the energy-intensive development of
industrial economies like the US.

The Climate Group’s report, SMART 2020: Enabling the low
carbon economy in the Information Age5, calculates the potential
savings of a shift to IT-enabled solutions, such as dematerialisation,
smart grid, telecommuting and others, in the transport, building,
power and industrial sectors. IT can transform the economy by
applying its technologies to other industries, helping them move
away from inefficient or high carbon products and systems.

It is challenging, however, to find data on the actual net impacts of
applied IT technologies due to information gaps and a multiplicity of
variables, as well as a lack of transparency around the lifecycle
impacts of IT’s own growing emissions and rising electricity use.
Greenpeace evaluates the progress of major IT companies toward
the energy and emissions saving potential identified in the SMART
2020 report on our Cool IT Leaderboard6.

Smart Grid: IT can make the intangibles of our energy use visible
through energy tracking and management tools. Behavioural
change is one key to unlocking IT’s potential, but consumers need
access to the right tools. A smart grid allows for real time
information to flow between the power generator or utility and the
customer. In combination with software like Google’s PowerMeter,
which translates that data into information that is understandable
and educational to the consumer, the smart grid can result in
emission savings by helping individuals better manage their energy
use.

Digital music: Microsoft and Intel commissioned a report in 2009
to assess the energy and CO2 performance of downloaded digital
music over the electronic purchases of compact discs. While
savings are evident, the report underscores the need for a better
understanding of more variables and greater consideration of the
energy sources behind data storage in each scenario. As society
moves to cloud-based information storage, the source of energy
matters, and a direct comparison of the options can only be made
with more transparency around the carbon footprint of cloud
hosting.

Telecommuting: Working remotely could reduce business travel
and office building emissions by large percentages, although other
emissions will increase as employees come to rely more heavily on
their electronics and telecommunication networks to stay in touch.
This example stresses the importance of transparency relating to
the energy demands associated with telecommuting and a wide
array of IT tools, such as teleconferencing. Without that
information, which companies are reluctant to share, it is
impossible to properly assess the balance sheet.

SMART 2020 identifies how a shift to energy saving IT technologies
could produce global reductions of up to 15% by 2020. Realisation
of that potential will require better data, greater transparency, bold
public policies, incentives and active consumer participation. IT
opportunities have great potential, but IT companies must
demonstrate that the sources of energy used to power our virtual
lives are clean and renewable.

The power sector was responsible for 26% of global emissions in
20087, the largest contributor globally, and could be responsible for
14.26 GtCO2e in 20208, so the potential for IT to reduce power
sector emissions through smart grid technology could be
substantial – some 2.03 GtCO2e by 2020. It represents the largest
IT opportunity identified in the SMART 2020 study, and cost
savings estimates of up to €79bn ($124.6bn).

In addition to helping consumers save energy, the smart grid can
support decentralised clean energy production from sources such
as solar and wind. As the energy footprint of IT data centres
expands, we are urging companies to employ direct on-site
renewable energy installation to power more of their operations.
The smart system can help companies and individuals that
produce their own energy send unused capacity back to the grid,
thus helping to power IT operations and offset the burden of its own
electricity demand. More cooperation, better data, and greater
transparency are needed to fulfill the promised savings of smart
grid and metering technologies.

Dematerialisation: Moving bits instead of atoms could reduce
emissions significantly, but similar challenges and unknowns exist
surrounding technology penetration and development.
Telecommuting is, in fact, one of the largest opportunities in this
category, but dematerialisation can also be applied to lifestyle
activities and help us trade manufactured goods for cloud-based
practices.

IT’s carbon and
energy footprint

How much energy is required to power the ever-expanding online
world? What percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions is
attributable to the IT sector? Answers to these questions are very
difficult to obtain with any degree of precision, partially due to
explosive growth, a wide range of devices and energy sources, and
rapidly changing technology and business models.

But a clear lack of transparency from major IT brands is one of the
biggest reasons behind this imprecision. Secrecy appears to be fed
both by concerns about disclosing competitive (dis)advantage
relating to the companies’ operations, particularly among data
centre operators, and by a desire to muzzle the story of how the IT
sector, otherwise perceived as ‘clean’ by the public and its
employees, is reliant upon dirty sources of energy to fuel its growth.

The estimates of the IT sector’s carbon footprint performed to date
have varied widely in their methodology and scope. One of the
most recognised estimates of the IT sector’s footprint was
conducted as part of the 2008 SMART 2020 study, which
established that the sector is responsible for 2% of global GHG
emissions. The report outlines three broad areas of greenhouse
gas associated with our online and electronic world:

Greenpeace released its own report, Make IT Green: Cloud
Computing and its Contribution to Climate Change9 in March of
2010, highlighting the scale of IT’s estimated energy consumption,
and providing new analysis on the projected growth in energy
consumption of the internet and cloud computing for the coming
decade, particularly as driven by data centres.

Key findings and outstanding questions from the Make IT Green
report include:

• The electricity consumption of data centres may be as much as

70% higher than previously predicted.

• The combined electricity demand of the internet/cloud (data

centres and telecommunications network) globally is 623bn kWh
(and would rank 5th among countries).

• Based on current projections, the demand for electricity will more

than triple to 1,973bn kWh, an amount greater than the
combined total demands of France, Germany, Canada and
Brazil.

IT energy use -
growth all around

PC and peripheral electronics devices

The majority of the energy footprint of PCs and equivalent devices
is generated by the use phase of the product. Footprint expansion
is anticipated as the wealth of developing countries continues to
grow, and with it, the use of personal computing devices. Although
the iPad has foreshadowed a continued trend toward smaller low-
power devices, the relative impact of energy sources in their supply
chain footprint will grow significantly.

Some IT manufactures are taking on the challenge of measuring
and monitoring the energy and carbon footprint associated with
their manufacturing and distribution supply chain, though most are
at the very early stages of doing so.

Greenpeace’s Guide to Greener Electronics has played a catalytic
role in evaluating the products and policies of major consumer
electronic manufacturers on environmental design and
performance. The criteria used in the Guide is being updated to
reflect the growing importance of supply chain energy and carbon
management, and we will release a new ranking of major consumer
electronic manufacturers in late fall 2011.

Telecommunications network and devices

The global telecommunications network has similarly experienced
explosive growth, both in terms of number of mobile subscribers
and the amount of data that flows through this network to drive the
internet. The estimated energy footprint of the network (not
including mobile devices) in 2007 was 293bn kWh, larger than the
entire electricity demand of Spain (276bn kWh) for the same
period.10

In the emerging markets of the developing world, mobile
telecommunications networks are enabling access to hundreds of
millions of new subscribers, leapfrogging the fixed landlines that
were unavailable to large segments of the population. However, in
countries like India, where the telecom towers extend far beyond
the reach of the electric power grid, telecom operators are turning
to diesel generators to produce adequate electricity to power the
network, which adds a new and heavy source of air and carbon
pollution. A 2010 government analysis found that India's
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rose by 58% between 1994 and
2007, with the energy sector contributing over half of the
emissions.11

12 Greenpeace International

As is most apparent in emerging markets where there is
limited reliable grid electricity, there is a tremendous leadership
opportunity for the telecom operators to utilise renewable energy
sources to power their expansion. But without strong policy
intervention and cost incentives for consumers or other types of
policy intervention, the opportunity to create a renewably
powered telecommunications network may be lost.

Greenpeace will release a special report on leadership and clean
energy opportunities for the telecom sector in India and other
key emerging markets during 2011.

Data centres

Data centres are nondescript buildings, often out of the public
eye, yet increasingly immense in size, and they are the fastest
growing source of IT energy use. These buildings house the
internet, business and telecommunications systems, and store
the bulk of our data. Utility-scale data centres are the size of two
to three Walmart stores, and they continue to grow larger in
scale and store larger amounts of data, effectively becoming like
factories (of information) of the 21st Century, demanding ever-
increasing amounts of electricity.

In the US, which hosts approximately 40% of the world’s data
centre servers, it is estimated that server farms consume close
to 3% of the national power supply. Apple’s new $1bn US dollar
‘iDataCenter’ in North Carolina is estimated to require as much
100MW of power, equivalent to about 80,000 US homes or
250,000 EU homes (see box on North Carolina).

Greenpeace’s 2010 Make IT Green report estimates that the
global demand for electricity from data centres was on the order
of 330bn kWh in 2007, close to the equivalent of the entire
electricity demand of the UK (345bn kWh12). This demand is
projected to triple or quadruple by 2020.

factbook/rankorder/2042rank.html

India

The Indian telecommunications industry is one of the fastest
growing in the world, adding between 8 and 10 million mobile
subscribers every month. At current rates of growth, this
would translate into 800 million mobile subscribers, the
second largest telecom market globally by 2012.

Much of the growth in the Indian telecom sector is from India's
rural and semi-urban areas. By 2012, India is likely to have 200
million rural telecom connections at a penetration rate of
25%13. Buoyed by the rapid surge in the subscriber base,
huge investments are being made into this industry. The
booming domestic telecom market has been attracting huge
amounts of investment, which is likely to accelerate with the
entry of new players and launch of new services, and has
attracted 8% of the cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI)
over the last two years.

Out of the existing 300,000 mobile towers, over 40% exist in
rural and semi-urban areas where either the grid-connected
electricity is not available or the electricity supply is irregular14.
As a result, mobile towers – and, increasingly, grid-connected
towers - in these areas rely on diesel generators to power their
network operations. The consumption of diesel by the telecom
sector currently stands at a staggering 2bn litres annually,
second only to the railways in India. This consumption is
responsible for 5.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually
and is growing, exceeding 2% of the country’s total GHG
emissions.

Greening the mobile networks

As much as the mobile telecommunications network is
enabling India to leafrog the traditional wired
telecommunication network, the Indian telecoms sector must
look to solar power to break the telecoms sector’s current
addiction to diesel, and begin the transition to a clean energy
powered telecommunications network.

Data centres: Information
factories of the 21st Century

Data centres, faceless buildings packed with computer servers
that dot the modern landscape with ever-increasing enormity,
have become the ‘information factories’ of the digital economy.
The investment required to build a modern utility-scale data centre
facility is anywhere between $100m and $1bn US dollars, and
getting larger all the time. By 2020, it is estimated that the annual
investment in data centre construction will soar to over $220bn
globally, and $50 billion in the US alone.15

Many considerations go into determining where new mega data
centres are located, but the primary factors are (1) a reliable and
low-cost source of electricity, (2) reliable and adequate capacity in
the telecommunications infrastructure to provide a fast connection
to customers, and (3) avoiding risk of disruption (earthquakes,
floods, tornadoes or civil unrest).

The energy intensity of data centres, which can consume as much
power as 40 to 50 thousand average US homes, often dictates that
access to a reliable and low-cost supply of electricity is very
important, particularly when proximity to users is not a requirement.
While IT brands often downplay the significance of energy in their
site selection process, evidence of this can certainly be found in
Quincy, Washington, which now hosts Yahoo!, Microsoft, Dell and
Amazon data facilities. Quincy was not a hub of the IT universe until
data centre operators identified and began to tap the low cost
hydro-powered electricity supply left behind following the
shuttering of the region’s aluminum industry.

Similarly, the recent influx of mega utility-scale data centres into
western North Carolina (Facebook, Google, Apple) was influenced
by the attractive electricity prices offered by local utilities (Duke
Energy and Progress Energy), which had extra capacity of dirty coal
and nuclear power following the departure of the region’s textile
and furniture manufacturing. Local tax incentives also attract the
attention of IT firms, especially in the US. Hundreds of millions of
dollars are dangled by municipalities and states to lure global
brands in hopes of (re)building the local economy.

Efficient IT is not necessarily Green IT

The debate over what should be considered ‘green’ in cloud
computing continues to slowly evolve within the IT sector. Until
recently, green efforts were almost solely defined by energy
efficiency improvements, or decreasing the relative amount of
energy consumed for delivery of computing services. Such IT
energy efficiency efforts have largely been motivated out of a desire
to curb rising energy needs and related costs, and, to some extent,
with regard for environmental performance. IT engineers have
steadily delivered significant improvements to data centre design,
energy efficient software coding, and the energy efficiency of
computers, efforts which have produced dramatic improvements
in computing power while reducing the amount of equivalent
energy use.

A major evolutionary trend in data centre design underway is the
utilisation of ‘free cooling’, or use of outside air instead of energy-
intensive chillers to keep the computers from overheating. This shift
is already happening amongst most major utility-scale operators,
as they have identified the major cost savings that can result from
efficient building designs and modular containers. Data centres are
increasingly sited in locations where operators can take advantage
of cooler climates and rely less on the resource intensive cooling
equipment that typically composes at least half of a data centre’s
energy footprint.

In addition to these operational cost savings, advances in design
are helping drive down the construction cost significantly, from an
industry average of $15m US dollars per MW of IT energy
consumption to $6-8m per MW, with the most recent modular data
centre designs by Yahoo! and Microsoft. However, the lowered
cost of data centre construction will likely increase the demand for
cloud computing services. (See ‘Jevons Paradox’)

This approach can be understood in part by how the industry has
defined the problem: power consumption. Thus the approach has
been a strictly technical solution: improve server energy efficiency
and reduce waste associated with cooling and other ‘non-
computing’ energy demands. What this approach fails to consider,
however, is the kind of energy used to feed consumption.

Energy efficiency rebound effect – Jevons Paradox16

Recently there has been debate over whether improvements
in energy efficiency can actually result in greater consumption
of resources overall as lower costs enable more demand
(more supply at a lower cost). This is known as the Jevons
Paradox.

A report by the US EPA in 200717 provided some of the most
thorough projections of how data centres and computer
services will affect US electricity demand. The scenarios
assumed that energy efficiency improvements from data
centre and server design would be able to flatten, if not bend
downward, the electricity demand curve. However, if the
tenets of the Jevons Paradox hold true for data centre power
consumption, improvements to the energy efficiency and cost
of delivering cloud-based computing services could serve to
significantly increase data centre power consumption.

Energy innovation continues to occur inside the data centre
and computer chassis, but given the scale of predicted
growth, the source of electricity must be factored into what is
meant by ‘green IT’. Energy efficiency alone will, at best, slow
the growth of the sector’s footprint. Given the potential
impacts of the Jevons Paradox, improved IT efficiency will
likely increase its environmental footprint even beyond what
is currently projected without a shift away from dirty sources
of energy.

Green claims

Our ability to measure and compare the environmental
performance of data centres has been significantly hindered by the
lack of transparency within the sector and the limitations of
industry-adopted metrics like PUE & DCiE18, which speak only to
the efficiency of data centre infrastructure relative to energy
demand, but not to the overall resource impact or even the amount
of energy needed for a particular computing activity.

Metrics like PUE do have value in helping data centre operators
benchmark the design and efficiency of their facilities by providing
an objective metric that drives efforts to improve facility efficiency.
However, many companies are affirmatively using low PUE ratings
to communicate externally that their data centres are ‘green’ and
sustainable without accounting for the full environmental picture.

Government institutions like the USEPA and industry associations
like the Green Grid (which established PUE) have been largely
complicit in this, though recent efforts have been made to develop
additional resource-based metrics that speak to the carbon
intensity (CUE) and water utilisation (WUE) of a data centre.

Again, much greater transparency is needed from data centre
operators on their energy footprint in order to establish meaningful
leadership to advance the debate among peers and government
regulators and substantiate claims of ‘green IT’. That, along with
the adoption of clear resource-related metrics that allow customers
to identify the environmental performance of their IT vendors and
suppliers, will become increasingly important as cloud computing
expands.

The human cost of coal
Just one 500MW coal-fired power plant produces
approximately 3m tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year.
In the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences19, Dr.
Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health
and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School,
detailed the economic, health and environmental costs
associated with each stage in the life cycle of coal –
extraction, transportation, processing and combustion.
These costs, between a third to over half a trillion dollars
annually, are directly passed on to the public.

In terms of human health, the report estimates $74.6bn US
dollars a year in public health burdens in Appalachian
communities, with a majority of the impact resulting from
increased healthcare costs, injury and death. Emissions of
air pollutants account for $187.5bn, mercury impacts as
high as $29.3bn and climate contributions from
combustion between $61.7bn and $205.8bn. Heavy metal
toxins and carcinogens released during processing pollute
water and food sources and are linked to long-term health
problems. Mining, transportation, and combustion of coal
contribute to poor air quality and respiratory disease, while
the risky nature of mining coal results in death and injury
for workers.

Location Choice = Energy Choice04

The current and projected supply of clean electricity varies
significantly between nations and regions, and growth is largely
determined by the energy and investment policies in those places.

For the global data centre operator that has a range of options to
choose from, location is the single biggest determinant of whether
clean or dirty energy will be used to power their data centre. Global
brands should use their buying power to drive utilities and
governments toward the development of cleaner generation mixes
by voting accordingly within their site selection region.

Unfortunately, as we have seen with global IT companies who have
located data centres in North Carolina (see ‘North Carolina’ box),
the short-term lure of low-cost dirty energy and tax incentives has
often been too much to resist. Though many IT brands claim to
include sustainability criteria in their site selection process, for most
it appears to be far down the list of factors that lead to the ultimate
decision on where to invest.

There are increasingly signs that companies recognise a highly-
efficient data centre as only the beginning, and they are paying
increasing attention to the goal of access to a cost-effective and
reliable clean electricity with pathways to increase it over time.
Given the rapid growth of electricity consumption, it is imperative
that IT companies use their market power to make clean and
reliable supply more available in addition to their advances in
computing efficiency. IT can help drive clean energy supply across
the regions in which it operates.

In order to ensure that the supply of clean energy can keep pace
with IT’s demand, companies need to make a corporate
commitment to engage in energy policy decisions in regions where
they establish operations. As large commercial consumers of
electricity, IT companies have standing with utilities and policy-
makers to influence an acceleration of the investment and
deployment of the clean electricity supplies that will enable these
factories to operate on 100% renewable energy. Key opportunities
and challenges that IT brands should seek to collaborate with
governments and utilities on include:

• Adoption of clean energy investment incentives specific to the IT
sector for energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment.

• Development of cost-effective, regionally compatible sources of
renewable power generation for data centres (such as solar,
wind, tidal and wave power).

• Additional investments toward the development and deployment
of grid infrastructure and energy storage technology to enable
much higher utilisation of variable energy sources, such as wind
and solar.

North Carolina’s dirty data triangle:
Facebook, Google and Apple

While there are a number of emerging data centre hot spots
around the world, the mega data centre projects are in rural
North Carolina in the US, and they include three of the biggest
global brands breaking ground on super-size data centres
within an approximate 30 mile (50km) radius. This example is
perhaps the most instructive of what needs to change in the
race to build the cloud. These mega data centres, which will
draw from some of the dirtiest generation mixes in the US,
highlights the sway of low-cost energy, misplaced tax
incentives, and a corresponding lack of commitment to clean
energy.

Google, Lenoir/Caldwell County, North Carolina: Google was
one of the first global brands to site in the region, announcing
construction of a $600m US dollar data centre in Lenoir in
2007. It is in the process of bringing the second phase of its
facility on line to a total of 470,000 sq ft. The power
consumption for the Google facility is not public, but is
estimated to be between 60 and100MW, based on the size
and reported cost of the facility.

Apple, Maiden, North Carolina: Apple is nearing completion of
one of the largest data centres in the world, dubbed the
‘iDataCentre’ by the media. It invested $1bn into the facility,
which exceeds 500,000 sq ft and requires an estimated power
range of 100MW.

Facebook, Forest City, North Carolina: Facebook recently
began construction on its second data centre in North
Carolina, a $450m, 300,000 sq ft facility just outside of Forest
City, which has an estimated power demand of 40MW.

There are two key attractions that are driving data centres to
North Carolina:

1. Low-cost power and utility recruitment

Facing high unemployment (15%) following the decline of the
furniture and textile industries, North Carolina’s economic
development agencies have recruited the IT sector heavily to place
data centres there20, seeking to become the ‘next Quincy’, with
websites dedicated to facilitating site selection in the region.21

Duke Energy, the primary utility for this part of North Carolina, also
put effort into recruiting Google, Apple and Facebook to the region.
Data centre operators are some of the most coveted customers for
utilities, and utilities typically play a big role in their recruitment,
offering discounted electricity rates for larger customers.

The price of electricity for select industrial customers of Duke
Energy has been reported at 4 to 5 cents (.03-.04 euro) a kilowatt-
hour22, much lower than in most parts of the US. Unfortunately, the
generation mix in North Carolina is one of the dirtiest in the country,
with only 4% of electricity generation from renewable sources and
the balance from coal (61%) and nuclear (30.8%).23

2. Tax incentives

• Apple: North Carolina’s legislature approved $46m in tax

breaks, and local governments slashed Apple’s real estate and
personal property taxes by 50% and 85% respectively24.

• Google: North Carolina put together a package of tax breaks,
infrastructure upgrades, and other incentives, valued at $212m
over 30 years25.

• Facebook: The exact structure of tax incentives has not been
disclosed, but the company is reported to have received a
package similar to that of Google and Apple, with $17m in local
subsidies and tax breaks over 10 years. Facebook will be exempt
from paying state taxes on all equipment, electricity and
construction materials for the data centres.

Getting renewable
energy right

Greenpeace advocates for the global deployment of clean and
sustainable renewable energy to replace existing hazardous and
dirty fuels and meet the rapidly growing global demand for energy.
In 2010 we published Energy [R]evolution27, a practical blueprint for
the worldʼs renewable energy future, which was developed in
conjunction with specialists from the European Renewable Energy
Council (EREC) and the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics at
the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), along with more than 30
scientists and engineers from around the world.

Energy [R]evolution demonstrates a pathway for the world to phase
out fossil fuels and reduce CO2 emissions, while ensuring energy
security, but not all replacement power sources are created equal.
Below is a list of those sources that can help the IT industry, and
the rest of the world, trade in dirty energy for safe, renewable
electricity.

Wind power: large-scale development of onshore and offshore
wind power, though special attention should be given to minimising
the impact on wildlife and biodiversity;

Solar energy: large-scale development of thermal solar energy
and solar power for electricity production through photovoltaics
and concentrating;

Hydropower: dams built according to the criteria of the World
Commission on Dams;

Bioenergy: use of biomass for electricity production and biofuels
for transport that meet sustainability criteria (environmentally and
socially responsible production, does not cause direct or indirect
land-use changes, and does not threaten food security), and result
in actual greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Greenpeace does
not support the use of non-organic waste or co-firing of biomass in
coal-fired power stations;

Geothermal power: Greenpeace supports the development of

Marine/Oceans power: wave, current and tidal power with
thorough environmental impact assessment and strict criteria to
minimise the environmental impact of tidal power.

There are a number of so-called ‘clean’ alternatives that fail to
safely or reliably reduce carbon emissions. Given the questionable
effectiveness of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), for example,
as well as potential liability and uncertainty surrounding its ability to
regulate its safety and environmental impacts, the application of
CCS to coal-fired power stations should not be considered as a
means of meeting infrastructural electricity demands. A full
Greenpeace analysis of CCS can be found in our 2008 report,
False Hope: Why Carbon Capture and Storage Won’t Save the

Nuclear power

Greenpeace has always vigorously opposed investment in
nuclear power because of its unacceptable risk to the
environment and human health, which we have unfortunately
been reminded of by the crisis in Japan. Greenpeace is
advocating for a halt to the expansion of all nuclear power,
and for the shutdown of existing plants.

Key concerns:

• Nuclear energy is an expensive diversion from the

development and deployment of renewable energy, energy
efficiency, and decentralised energy systems required for a
low carbon future.

• We can reduce carbon emissions much more cheaply and
effectively using renewable energy and energy efficiency
measures.

• No proven long-term solution exists for dealing with

radioactive waste.

• Expanding nuclear power internationally would hugely
increase the risk of terrorism and nuclear weapons
proliferation.

• Nuclear power plants cannot be built a timeframe necessary
to make even the smallest difference in combating climate
change.

Where to find renewable cloud power

In Iowa, Google has signed a 20-year power purchasing agreement
with a wind energy company, though the clean electricity that will
be generated there is not yet linked to a specific facility. Google has
pledged to retire the renewable energy credits earned by the
agreement. Microsoft also recently announced an agreement to
buy wind energy for its Dublin data centre.

i/o Data Centers is installing a massive solar array on top of its new
580,000 sq ft facility in Phoenix, with 5,000 panels that will
generate a total 4.5MW at peak capacity. Though just a fraction of
the facility’s total 80MW capacity, the solar panels will be married
with thermal storage technology that will reduce the energy drain of
cooling during the heat of the day. The solar had outsized impact
on cost, as it provides on-site generation when grid energy is most
expensive.29

Next Generation Data (NGD) in Newport, Wales, claims to be
100% renewably powered through its purchasing agreement with
SmartestEnergy, the UK’s largest purchaser of electricity from
independent generators of renewable energy. The SmartestEnergy
website indicates that customers can choose the proportion and
mix of renewables, including wind, hydro and biomass, but NGD
does not disclose its specific choices or quantities30.

In Iceland, GreenQloud is powered 100% by geothermal and
hydropower energy, delivering hosting and storage services. The
Star Peak Energy Center31, though still in concept phase, is also
pushing a vision of renewably powered data. The company plans to
generate geothermal power and attract data centre operators to
locate their facilities at its site and purchase Star Peak’s renewable
energy.

Transparency and reporting

There is currently a double standard in the IT sector when it comes
to transparency. IT companies want consumers to trust them with
greater and greater access to their personal information, but are
unwilling to be transparent about their own energy and carbon
footprint. As large purchasers of electricity with rapidly increasing
energy demands driven by the accelerated growth of the sector,
companies must make transparency a tenet of their operations and
come clean about their energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.

The IT sector often talks about the economy-wide energy savings
that can be unlocked when their technologies are used to provide
information to electricity customers. Energy measurement and
management is enabled by IT software that relies on the disclosure
of consumer data by utility companies. The purpose of these
energy management tools is to make that data meaningful to
electricity users, and ultimately help them reduce their usage by
allowing them to understand and visualise it better.

When companies refuse to disclose their own energy footprint or
the sources of energy used to supply their platforms, we are left in
the dark with regard to the net impact that cloud computing has on
carbon, and thus our own use related emissions. The energy
consumption and performance data of IT data centre operations is
particularly opaque. Most companies justify their lack of
transparency by asserting such information is a trade secret that
will be used by competitors.

The sector has preferred to emphasise progress made in energy
efficient design and performance, although some companies have
adopted overall greenhouse gas reduction targets and report on
their progress through frameworks like the Carbon Disclosure
Project.

At the facility level, there is a disproportionate focus on energy
efficiency metrics over carbon footprint and energy sources. Power
Usage Effectiveness (PUE), a broad efficiency metric for comparing
total power consumption to computing power consumption, does
not provide an indication of the type of energy used, nor does it
measure emissions. A newly proposed metric, Carbon Usage
Effectiveness (CUE)32, if broadly adopted, would be a welcomed
shift toward greater transparency and provide some basis of
comparison of the carbon footprint of existing or planned data
centres.

Just as we need to leverage IT energy solutions to help better
manage our non-IT energy use, cloud consumers need information
from the companies that manage their data in the cloud about the
environmental and energy footprint of that data. IT energy
transparency and reporting should include:

• Annual reporting of GHG footprint and energy consumption on a
corporate level (via CSR report or through the Carbon Disclosure
Project);

• Reporting of facility-level energy mix, including emissions factors

or renewable energy percentage; and

• Disclosure of performance-based metrics, such as disclosure of
the carbon intensity of IT service per unit of data (see Akamai),
along with facility level CUE and PUE.

IBM, Cisco and Wipro have demonstrated greater transparency
than other companies in the sector with no negative commercial
effect. IT companies with growing digital networks should follow the
lead of their peers. Broader adoption of standard reporting metrics
will increase environmental performance and raise the bar for the
sector overall.

Infrastructure siting policy

Mitigation

Many factors go into choosing a location for new IT infrastructure.
Data centre siting requires the availability of reliable and low-cost
electricity, as well as telecommunications infrastructure. Tax
incentives, climate, and proximity to end-user may entice a
company to choose a particular location. Availability of renewable
energy to power the data centre, while possibly considered, is
currently low on most cloud companies’ lists. As these data centres
continue to multiply and increase their electricity consumption, the
clean energy source must be prioritised.

A cloud infrastructure siting policy that institutionalises a preference
for clean energy will help companies avoid investments that drive
demand for dirty energy and increase greenhouse gas emissions.
Failure to address the issue of the source of power is a failure of
leadership, and may create greater long-term costs for companies
as high-carbon energy becomes increasingly expensive or
politically penalised.

A strong siting policy for data centre operators would include:

A company that truly takes responsibility for its energy use and
associated greenhouse gas emissions will demonstrate a
comprehensive mitigation plan, which includes the direct purchase
or installation of renewable energy to power its infrastructure in
addition to avoided emissions through energy efficiency. This plan
should establish an ambitious GHG reduction target or a renewable
energy goal with a clear timeline and roadmap of the mitigation
strategies that will be used to meet it.

A comprehensive mitigation strategy must address the source of
energy as well as energy saved through procurement or direct
installation of renewable. Potential elements of mitigation strategy
for IT Infrastructure include:

• Improvements in energy efficiency.

• Direct installation of clean energy technologies.

• Investment or power purchase agreement with clean energy

developer

• Investment in local energy efficiency offsets to reduce demand on

• Preferential treatment for renewable energy, and away from coal

load centre

• Grid mix of renewable energy.

• Utilisation Green-E Tariff offered by utility.

• Limited RECs (limited reliance on RECs if part of early

implementation)

IT’s growing carbon footprint can be blamed on the lack of a
comprehensive plan to end its reliance on electricity from dirty
sources of energy. The sector has the ability to change the rules of
the game by helping to bring more renewable energy online
through purchase power, investment and advocacy, but few
companies have demonstrated the bold leadership necessary to
ensure that IT’s rampant growth will be sustained by clean energy
sources.

and nuclear power.

• Indicative supporting mechanisms, such as a carbon shadow
price or electricity performance standard for Power Purchase
Agreements (PPAs) or utility grid mix (current and prospective
over expected use of facility).

• Energy procurement standard for co-location and rented

facilities.

While a number of companies list renewables energy supply as a
consideration, there are relatively few companies that clearly make
it an investment priority. Yahoo! set a goal to reduce the carbon
intensity of its data centres 40% by 2014 through efficient design
and by locating new facilities near renewable energy sources.34
Google employs a carbon shadow price when purchasing
electricity to discriminate against coal and incentivise cleaner
energy choices. At the same time, Google is utterly non-
transparent when it comes to reporting its emissions and total
energy use, or even the locations of its data centres, which
obfuscates the company’s ability to show that it is meeting its
commitment and renewable energy preferences are having a
positive net impact.

Mitigation Strategies05

Energy Efficiency

The greatest efforts to reduce the footprint of the IT industry have
involved energy efficiency measures. Most IT companies now
acknowledge the substantial economic benefits of using less
energy. Energy efficiency provides a beneficial, near-term return on
investment, which is why many IT companies have chosen this
path over bolder carbon mitigation strategies.

Companies have approached energy efficiency in a variety of ways,
but particularly through data centre design improvements. The
Department of Energy awarded $47m US dollars in grants to IT
companies in January 201034 to fund energy efficiency projects. HP
got $7.4m for a data centre design with distributed energy
systems, and Yahoo was granted $9.9m to design a chicken-
coop-inspired data centre with passive cooling.

While many IT companies are trying to decrease the energy
demands of the data centre itself, Google has also focused on
building its more energy-efficient web servers. Microsoft has come
up with software coding techniques that help the IT sector do what
it does best, but more efficiently.

Clean energy direct installation /
Self-generation

Some IT companies have installed renewable energy on site to
generate power for their own operations, an increasingly positive
sign that they are beginning to take direct responsibility for the
energy sources used to power their infrastructure. Though it may
be difficult technically or economically to power a large data centre
completely with on-site renewables, companies that make these
investments have better protection against electricity price volatility
and are increasing their energy security in addition to doing what is
right for the environment.

"Large-scale customers
face a critical need to reduce
substantially the power costs and
carbon footprints of data centres.
Verne Global is breaking new ground in
using Iceland’s natural green resources
to mitigate both increasing emissions
and rising energy costs."

Dominic Ward from the Wellcome
Trust’s Investments Division.

In 2006, Google installed what was then the largest solar
installation in the country (1.6MW) on its Googleplex headquarters
in Mountain View, California. Three years later, an installation by i/o
Data Centers in Phoenix topped Google’s effort with solar to
supplement an immense data centre’s energy needs (4.5MW)35.

Direct purchase of renewable electricity

Clean energy procurement is dependent upon the location of the
data centre and its proximity to renewable energy generation
capacity, which is further justification for a strong infrastructure
siting policy. Strategic infrastructure siting allows IT companies to
buy clean energy directly from the utility or other provider through
power purchase agreements in which renewable energy is
generated and fed to the grid load centre where IT infrastructure is
at the point of consumption.

Notable examples include:

• Microsoft, Yahoo! and Google have located data centres in
Oregon and Washington to take advantage of the region’s
hydroelectric capacity, of which there was a surplus left by now-
defunct industries, such as aluminium production.

• In Wyoming, Green House Data offers cloud-hosting services in

the largest wind-powered data centre in the US, buying electricity
from a utility that has partnered with a 30MW wind generation site
in Cheyenne.

• Microsoft recently announced a contract to buy wind power for

its 22.2MW capacity data centre in Dublin36.

• Iceland is becoming an increasingly popular place for data centre

developers to take advantage of geothermal energy. Verne
Holdings built a 44-acre data centre there last year. The
company’s investors have not underplayed the significance of
choosing Iceland’s clean energy resources in order to minimise
the centre’s carbon footprint.

Last year, Google created a subsidiary, Google Energy, which
allows it to directly buy and sell federally regulated wholesale
electricity. This move offers Google greater flexibility, allowing the
company to bypass the local utility and purchase directly from
independent power producers for its huge power needs. Then it
can sell any excess back to the grid. Google entered into a 20-year
contract with a wind company in Iowa, locking in rate for power
from NextEra Energy Resources, which is perhaps the best
example of an IT company directly purchasing renewable energy
from a provider that has enough capacity (114MW) to power its
massive data centres.37

IT companies that primarily lease data centre space, and thus are
not directly involved in the selection of electricity supply, have
different options for pursuing cleaner sources of electricity.
Companies could establish a carbon-based procurement standard
that sets a minimum carbon performance threshold at a level that
would largely eliminate reliance on electricity generated by coal.
There is at least one major data centre operator in California,
Fortune, which has been granted the ability to give tenants of its
new San Jose facility license to choose their energy supply,
including sources that are higher in renewable energy content than
the surrounding grid38. Facebook is reported to be one of two major
tenants at this facility.

Direct clean energy investment vs. RECs

While renewable energy and energy efficient technologies continue
to develop and grow, there are still significant gaps in the private
sector financing needed to deploy them at scale across many
markets. IT companies such as Google and Intel have
demonstrated increasing interest in making direct clean energy
investments, rather than purchase offsets or RECs to manage their
emissions footprint. In other words, these companies can invest
much-needed capital into the development and deployment of
renewable energy instead of ‘renting’ the clean attributes of
renewables generated by others.

Funding negawatts?

As a complimentary strategy to direct installation of renewable
energy at new or existing data sites, IT companies could also
explore opportunities to provide capital to help reduce electricity
demand in the surrounding community. This approach could spur
deep cuts in the existing baseload and peak electricity demand to
help stop new IT power demand on the grid from driving demand
for dirty energy. Companies should consider investing in local
government or state-sanctioned programmes (such as a revolving
loan programme that drives down the cost and speed of housing
and building retrofits). Participation in a clean energy negawatt
investment plan has not been demonstrated by any IT company to
date, but could prove to be highly transformative to the community
that hosts the data centre or other IT infrastructure.

centers-adds-power-choice/

Renewable energy credits

Companies often indirectly purchase renewable energy through the
sale of green tags or RECs, which typically means that the
customer agrees to pay the local utility or a renewable energy
developer a premium for the renewable ‘commodity’ associated
with renewable electricity production, while the actual electricity
generated is not in close proximity to the purchaser of the Green
Tags or RECs.

The indirect approach to renewable energy procurement raises
concerns about whether its premium cost actually leads to
investment in additional renewable energy, or simply increases the
profit margin for energy traders. It does not guarantee that the
increased electricity use for which the REC is purchased cancels
out demand for dirty coal-fired electricity locally (e.g. wind tags from
Iowa for a facility in North Carolina do not supplant the burning of
additional coal in North Carolina). RECs alone do not suffice as a
mitigation strategy. Companies that buy them should only do so as
a transitional strategy while integrating more meaningful
greenhouse gas mitigation measures.

IT advocates needed

The sector can hasten the development and deployment of clean
energy, broadening its opportunities for mitigation and ensuring
more sustainable cloud growth, by advocating for strong climate
and energy policies. Standards, incentives, and financing
mechanisms are needed to bring clean energy to a scale that will
be necessary to power the cloud cleanly.

Rather than argue that they are helpless to change the grid mix or
impact the energy provider’s energy choices, IT companies can
help bring renewable energy and energy efficiency to scale by
throwing their political weight behind:

• Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Standards at a national,
state or regional level where they have operations or co-location
facilities.

• Investment incentives for data centres and internet infrastructure

to be powered by renewable energy.

• Regulatory intervention to reduce utilisation of dirty energy in grid

mix (e.g.: IRP).

• Mechanisms to drive distributed renewable energy generation

(PACE, FIT, etc.) and clean energy storage.

• Increased R&D and deployment funding of clean energy

generation and storage technologies.

The IT sector needs to unite behind a policy advocacy platform that
pushes the discourse and development of clean energy. While
some companies are wading in the policy arena, a clean energy
transformation requires much bolder leadership and cooperation.

report card methodology

Clean Energy Index methodology (Column 2)

The above inputs are from the following sources:

Greenpeace has established the Clean Energy Index as a response
to the lack of useful metrics and publicly available data to evaluate
and compare the energy related footprint of major cloud providers
and their respective data centres.

• Submissions by companies directly to Greenpeace.

• As defined by company when announcing investment.

• As reported by the media (in stories on the investment or

construction of facility, etc).

• For electricity demand, derived by taking the announced size of

investment and deriving total number of MW using industry
average cost per IT load ($15m US dollars per MW) multiplied by
publicly available PUE for facility or, if not available, 1.5 for new
facilities.

• If not announced by the company, renewable electricity

percentage, is taken from one of the following sources, as
available, in declining order of preference:

• The most recent published generation mix of the local utility

• In the US: 2007 eGrid State level generation mix as reported by

US EPA, or if not applicable, reported subregional egrid
generation mix.

• Outside the US, the European Commission and International

Energy Agency 2008/09 Statistics.

Important Note: This analysis does not attempt to represent itself
as a comprehensive snapshot of how much clean energy is being
consumed on a company-wide level. Only the companies can
properly provide that.

Greenpeace would welcome the opportunity to incorporate more
detailed data to inform our analysis, as that would likely provide a
more complete and refined picture of cloud providers and their
relevant context regarding their choices of dirty or clean energy. As
companies provide better data, Greenpeace will certainly
incorporate this into our evaluation and encourage other
companies to follow.

This lack of data is not due to the fact that data does not exist, but
instead it is related to the industry’s unwillingness to provide even
the most basic information about both the amount and source of its
growing electricity consumption. Despite a proliferation of metrics
created by the industry (e.g.: PUE, DCIE, CADE, DH-UE, SI-POM)
that attempt to measure how ‘green’ a data centre as measured by
energy efficiency, none of the current metrics shed any light on the
basic question: How much dirty energy is being used, and which
companies are choosing clean energy to power the cloud?

The Clean Energy Index attempts to provide a basic answer to this
question, based on what can be gleaned from the limited
information available, focusing on recent investments of select
brands and current clean energy supply associated with each
investment.

Starting with an initial set of some of the largest cloud providers,
Greenpeace has attempted to identify two main inputs from a
representative sample of their most recent (five years or less)
infrastructure investments. Those inputs are:

(1) Estimated size of electricity demand of each facility (in
megawatts);

(2) Amount of renewable electricity being used to power it (in %
terms).

This information is then used to approximate, initially on a facility
level, the number of megawatts of clean energy being used. Having
calculated a facility-level Clean Energy Intensity for a representative
sample of data centres, a company average of clean energy utilised
is derived.

In compiling the information included in this report, Greenpeace
contacted all companies featured here and asked for information
regarding their data center facilities, and for information on their
Infrastructure Siting and Mitigation Efforts. Estimates of data center
power demand were made available to companies for comment in
advance of publication, and where issues were raised, those are
highlighted in footnotes on the scorecard on page 7.

Coal Intensity (Column 3)

Infrastructure siting methodology (Column 5)

A company’s coal intensity is a simple calculation of the
approximate total percentage of coal generated electricity
powering the company’s data centres. This is calculated initially
on a facility level, based on the estimated maximum power demand
of the facility and the percentage of coal-generated electricity
supplied by the contacting utility or the local grid.

Companies are assessed on the strength of infrastructure siting
criteria and investment decisions that enable the development of
the company’s IT infrastructure to maximise the use of clean
sources of energy, and avoid an increase in demand for coal or
nuclear power to meet their growing demand for electricity from
their operations. High scoring companies demonstrate:

The company-level coal intensity is rendered by adding the total
MW of estimated maximum power from coal generation across
the sample data centre fleet, divided by the total estimated MW
maximum power demand of the same sample data centres.

• A clean energy siting policy to prioritise IT infrastructure

investments or procurements that rely primarily upon renewable
energy as a source of electricity and discriminate against coal and
nuclear power to meet infrastructure electricity demand.

Energy transparency methodology (Column 4)

Companies are evaluated on the scope and level of detail made
publicly available on energy consumption of IT infrastructure that
allow stakeholders and customers to evaluate the energy related
environmental performance and impact at corporate, product and
facility level. Public information includes information from a
company’s website, annual reports, submissions to regulatory
agencies or information clearinghouses such as the Carbon
Disclosure Project.

• For corporate and facility-level reporting, key elements of

information include: location and size of facilities; size of electricity
demand; generation mix and associated carbon content
(including and power purchase agreements specific to the facility)
and carbon intensity of date delivery and storage. Reporting
should include both owned and rented facilities.

• For customer level reporting, companies should provide regular
energy and carbon footprint information (pre-offset) associated
with the customers’ consumption, reported in manner consistent
with established reporting protocols.

• Consistent pattern of major infrastructure investment decisions
that increase or shift electricity demand to renewable sources of
electricity.

• Commitment to eliminate coal and nuclear energy from powering

company infrastructure.

Mitigation strategy methodology (Column 6)

Companies are evaluated on the strength of their strategies and
measurable progress to mitigate the demand for dirty energy
generated by their IT infrastructure. The effectiveness and strength
of a company’s mitigation strategy is measured along the following
guidelines:

• Companies with absolute emission reduction goals will be rated
higher than those companies who adopt an intensity-based
target.

• Efforts to meet electricity demand with the direct installation of

renewable energy, and reduce emissions through higher
efficiency will receive highest marks.

• Investment in clean energy supply and local energy efficiency

mechanisms will be rated higher that the purchase of offsets and
renewable energy credits to reach established environmental
goals.

Akamai

Amazon

Akamai is a global content distribution network (CDN) for the
internet. Though not exactly a household name, Akamai is one of
the major players in online content delivery. Akamai delivers
between 15% and 30% of internet traffic through a distributed
network of over 84,000 servers in 72 countries on behalf of the
biggest brand names on the planet, including many in this report
(Apple, IBM, Yahoo! and Greenpeace)39.

Energy transparency: B

Akamai’s reporting of its carbon intensity merits recognition in two
key areas: (1) Akamai reports its cloud related emissions using a
metric that allows some comparability with other cloud content
providers - CO2 per megabytes of data delivered.40 (2) Akamai is in
the early stages of making available to its customers a monthly
carbon footprint associated with content delivery through the
Akamai network servers. By providing customers with this
information, Akamai is enabling better awareness of energy and
carbon management associated with data consumption, which
will hopefully trigger additional reporting and competition for
environmental performance. Akamai does participate in the
Carbon Disclosure Project41 voluntary reporting programme.

Infrastructure siting: D

Akamai’s business model is based on renting server space on a
highly distributed basis, providing different opportunities to
influence site location and energy, which is different than other
cloud companies focused on designing and building their own data
centres. Though Akamai’s service model is highly distributed and
requires its servers be as close to the end consumer as possible,
the increase in the number of data centre operators that offer
renewable power (either full or partial) should enable Akamai to use
its buying power to include clean energy supply as a key criteria of
its future siting and procurement decisions. Akamai is in early
stages of requiring its colocation facilities to provide energy and
water performance data, which will hopefully inform their site
selection in the future.

Mitigation: C

Akamai claims that “it is encouraging adoption of energy efficient IT
technologies” and hopes to continue to reduce emissions.42
However, despite its ability to report a 32% reduction in CO2
intensity in 2009, Akamai does not have commitment to future
reductions. There are likely significant energy efficiency
improvements still to be realised, but Akamai should also broaden
its discussions with vendors to identify opportunities to utilise more
clean energy in powering Akamai’s 84,000 servers, which would
allow it to reduce its footprint beyond what can be done via
efficiency.

Amazon.com, the largest online US retailer, launched Amazon Web
Services (AWS) in 2006, and has emerged as one of the dominant
providers of cloud-based computing and storage capacity. Its
straightforward pricing structure and low-cost scalable capacity
has won AWS a wide range of customers, from internet start-ups to
major online brands, such as Netflix.

Transparency: F

Despite its user friendly retail approach, AWS is secretive about its
operations and does not report publicly on the environmental
performance or energy demand of any of its data centre
operations. AWS does not participate in the Carbon Disclosure
Project voluntary reporting programme.

Infrastructure siting: D

AWS does not disclose whether it employs clean energy or other
sustainability criteria to identify and prioritise data centre site
selection. AWS network hubs in the eastern half of the US are
reportedly in Northern Virginia, a region where more than two-thirds
of the electrical grid is powered by dirty electricity (46% coal, 41%
nuclear43). However, AWS’s recent decision to invest in Boardman,
Oregon, should allow it to power more of its cloud from the region’s
abundant hydroelectric power, despite it close proximity to the
state’s only remaining coal plant.

Mitigation: D

While AWS has highlighted some of its energy efficiency efforts to
peers within the sector, AWS does not appear to have any
environmental goals or published metric(s) to evaluate its data
centre performance or impact, nor does it provide evidence of
clean energy procurement for its operations beyond the mix that is
available on the grid.

Apple has been steadily adding to its online offerings, which can be
delivered via the cloud from its iTunes platform. Following the
phenomenal success of the iPad, the soon-to-be-completed $1bn
US dollar ‘iDataCenter’ in North Carolina indicates that Apple is
moving to significantly increase its cloud-based offerings to iPhone
and iPad customers.

Transparency: C

Although Apple has become increasingly transparent about the
environmental footprint and operational performance of its
products, especially laptops and iPhones, it has not been as
forthcoming on the current or expected impacts of its online
products. Though many IT companies have pointed to the benefits
of downloading entertainment over traditional delivery methods,
one of the largest online destinations for such media – iTunes -
does not provide any data to evaluate these claims or allow
comparison with offerings from other vendors. Apple does
participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project voluntary reporting
programme.

Infrastructure siting: F

Apple previously touted its operations in California as much cleaner
than those that use energy produced on the average grid44. Apple’s
decision to locate its iDataCenter in North Carolina, which has an
electrical grid among the dirtiest in the country (61% coal, 31%
nuclear45), indicates a lack of a corporate commitment to clean
energy supply for its cloud operations. The fact that the alternative
location for Apple’s iDataCenter was Virginia46, where electricity is
also comes from very dirty sources, is an indication that, in addition
to tax incentives, access to inexpensive energy, regardless of its
source, is a key driver in Apple’s site selection.

Mitigation: C

Apple has reported a significant increase in the amount of clean
energy it has purchased for its operations in the past two years, and
has said that it will continue to look for sources of renewable energy
and buy green power wherever it can be found.47 However, Apple
has not declared a renewable energy or greenhouse gas target to
shape this commitment. The massive iDataCenter has estimated
electricity demand (at full capacity) as high as triple Apple’s current
total reported electricity use, which will unfortunately have a
significant impact on Apple’s environmental footprint.

Facebook

Facebook, a transformational young company, which now
connects nearly 600 million people worldwide, has thus far failed to
recognise the risk and responsibility of how it sources electricity.
Facebook, which accounts for 9% of internet traffic in the US and
reaches nearly 73% of all internet users48, appears to lack the vision
to become a company powered by clean energy. The company
announced two large data centre investments in 2010 to help meet
the needs of its users, marking a shift to owning and operating its
own data centres instead of renting data centre capacity.

Transparency: D

Facebook's recently announced Open Compute Project provides
an opportunity to be an open-source model not only for the
transparent use of equipment and design of data centers, but also
transparency in the disclosure of data centers' emissions and
energy sources. However, Facebook has yet to provide any data
on its energy consumption or related GHG emissions at either a
corporate or facility level, nor is it transparent about the locations
and sizes of its data centres. Facebook is reported to lease nine
facilities from large data centre operators in the US: Digital Realty
Trust, Coresite Realty, Fortune Data Centres and Dupont Fabros
Technology. Facebook does not participate in the Carbon
Disclosure Project voluntary reporting programme.

Infrastructure siting: F

Facebook has not released an official siting policy for its
infrastructure investments. The company has indicated that it
employs a broad number of criteria, including environmental and
sustainability criteria, but the most important criteria identified in the
selection of the Oregon data centre were: power infrastructure,
cost of power, tax environment and availability of land.49
Facebook’s first two siting decisions have led it to locations and
utilities (Oregon and North Carolina) that rely on coal as the primary
source of electricity, with nuclear a close second in North Carolina.
As these two data centre investments are likely the first in a series
of large infrastructure decisions for Facebook, the adoption of an
investment and siting policy that prioritises access to renewable
energy is critical.

Mitigation: D

Facebook is reported to be designing its Oregon and North
Carolina facilities to be as energy efficient as possible, and seeks to
leverage outside air cooling to reduce the amount of energy spent
on chillers to cool its servers. However, beyond efforts to improve
electrical efficiency, Facebook has not provided any additional
mitigation strategies or effort to procure and make investment in
nearby renewable energy generation.

Google

Google Inc. is a multinational public cloud computing, internet
search and advertising corporation. The company's stated mission
is "to organise the world's information and make it universally
accessible and useful”, though apparently this mandate applies to
everything except Google’s data centre locations and associated
energy and environmental footprint. Estimates of the scale and
number of Google data centres vary widely, as Google goes to
great lengths to keep its operations hidden from scrutiny, citing
competitive advantage as its reason to guard the scope of its
operations as a trade secret.

Among major cloud brands, Google talks the best and most
consistently about the need to not only increase efficiency, but also
move to renewable sources of electricity to power the cloud. But if
Google is serious about climate leadership, it should open source
its emissions footprint, confess to the world that it has a carbon
problem, and put its mitigation strategies on the table so others in
the sector can learn from and build on them.

Transparency: F

Google only publicly acknowledges the existence of seven data
centres globally, though informed estimates place Google’s fleet in
the range of 20 to 30 data centres50. Google fails to disclose
information on its energy use or GHG emissions, though it claims to
be carbon neutral through the purchasing of carbon offsets and
renewable energy51. Google needs to be transparent about the size
and growth of its carbon problem, and follow in the footsteps of
other companies that have set absolute reduction targets. Google
does participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project voluntary
reporting programme, but provides very little actual data on its
operational footprint or energy use.

Infrastructure siting: C

Google claims to choose renewable energy “where it makes
sense”52 and applies a shadow price for carbon when calculating
the power costs of potential data centre sites. However, while
Google has built sizable data centres attached to clean energy
sources in Oregon and Iowa, its recent investments in North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Oklahoma indicate that tax incentives
and access to inexpensive dirty energy make sense to Google as
well. Google reports significant new capital expenditures, with
spending rapidly escalating to $757m US dollars in 3Q 2010 and
$890m in 1Q 201153, and is rumored to be considering significant
new investments in Southeast Asia and Europe.

Mitigation: B

Google has played a useful role in advancing discussion within the
sector by highlighting the energy efficiency measures of its data
centres, and has entered the energy business with the creation of a
subsidiary called Google Energy, which can buy "the highest
quality, most affordable renewable energy"54. However, Google’s
overall lack of transparency means that neither its claim of being
“carbon neutral”55, nor the collective impact of its mitigation efforts,
can be properly assessed. Google’s recent commitment to enter
into a long term contract to buy 114 megawatts of wind energy in
Iowa and retire the associate RECs is at least one unambiguous
sign of leadership, and one we hope to see repeated by Google
and other IT companies. Google ultimately needs to drop the
veneer of being carbon neutral and publicly commit to phasing out
dirty fuels on a set time frame in order to remain in line with its 2030
Clean Energy Roadmap.

reductions in data centre footprint due to its consolidation efforts, it
should break this analysis down to provide more detailed
information on the current environmental performance of its cloud
services at the facility and product level. HP does participate in the
Carbon Disclosure Project voluntary reporting programme.

Infrastructure siting: D

As part of a global data centre consolidation effort in 2006, HP
announced plants to build pairs of 200,000 sq feet data centres in
Atlanta, Austin and Houston. Despite efficiency gains through its
data centre consolidation efforts and organisational goals to
increase renewable energy, clean energy sources did not appear to
factor highly in its site selection process. The energy mix at the
Atlanta and Houston data centres are among the dirtiest in the
country. HP’s recent opening of an energy efficient data centre in
Wynyard, UK, which generates 10% of its electricity from wind
power, will hopefully become a new model for HP as it accelerates
in its move to the cloud.

Mitigation: C

HP’s goal is to reduce GHG emissions from HP-owned and leased
facilities to 20% below 2005 levels by 2013 on an absolute basis.
This goal is independent of organic business growth and will be
accomplished by reducing the worldwide energy footprint of HP
facilities and data centres. In addition, HP plans to invest in energy
efficiency and renewable energy sources. Having set a goal to
increase its purchases of electricity from renewable sources to 8%
of total electricity usage by 2012, HP needs to increase its use of
renewable energy and showcase more detail on how its efficiency
improvements are effectively reducing the energy use and GHG
emissions of others on an absolute basis.

One of the world’s largest and most well-known IT companies
(home of the ‘Smarter Planet’), IBM has sought to link its brand to
IT-driven environmental solutions and services. In response to
many companies outsourcing IT needs to cloud based computing
infrastructure, IBM launched ‘Project Big Green’58 in 2007 to deliver
‘green’ data centre and cloud services to the worlds largest
businesses.

Transparency: C

IBM provides detailed annual corporate information on its
aggregate emissions and improvements toward environmental
goals, which include renewable energy, energy efficiency and total
energy consumption. However, despite claiming to own or operate
over 450 data centres around the world, IBM does not provide any
useful detail to its customers or stakeholders on the energy
consumption and impacts associated with the operation of these
facilities. IBM does participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project
voluntary reporting programme.

Infrastructure siting: C

IBM’s goal to increase amounts of renewable electricity should be
an important driver of investment as the company seeks to expand
its cloud profile. However, little detail on the source of energy is
provided, so it is unclear which sources of energy IBM’s new
infrastructure will draw from. This is particularly true in the case of
its new cloud infrastructure in China, the US, Germany and Ireland.
IBM must give higher priority to renewable energy access through
its siting policy and discriminate against dirty energy sources.

Mitigation: B

IBM should be recognised for its ongoing and comprehensive plan
to reduce emissions, in addition to driving significant gains in IT
efficiency. A stronger commitment is needed to expand energy
efficiency and its use of renewable energy as IBM itself expands,
extending the total percentage to well above the current 11%.
IBM’s mitigation strategy is further strengthened by its refusal to
use ‘offsets’ to achieve environmental goals, choosing to focus on
actions that actually reduce emissions or increase energy
efficiency, but greater clarity is needed on IBM’s policy to purchase
and retirement of RECs as part of its renewable power purchase
agreements.

Microsoft

Twitter

Microsoft has rapidly become one of the biggest champions of
cloud computing, making significant new investments in its cloud
infrastructure. Microsoft has a strong brand profile in both the
consumer and business spaces, and is developing a range of cloud
offerings to compete in both markets. Microsoft has regularly
marketed the environmental benefits of dematerialisation and the
energy-saving potential of the cloud, but has offered little data to
substantiate the claimed benefits.

Transparency: C

Microsoft’s reporting of its corporate environmental footprint does
not provide a clear picture of its operational impacts, but has
provided basic information on the energy footprint of its major data
centres. Also opaque are the metrics used to inform investment
decisions and energy choices for its rapidly growing network of
data centres.

Infrastructure siting: C

Microsoft has shown its willingness to follow tax incentives and dirty
energy supply, as evidenced by Microsoft’s recent announcement
to construct a new data centre in the coal-heavy state of Virginia in
the US.59 While Microsoft has made some significant data centre
investments located near renewable energy sources, there does
not appear to be a consistent policy to guide these investments.
Microsoft does participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project
voluntary reporting programme.

Mitigation: C

Microsoft has worked to identify and address key opportunities for
IT energy efficiency gains, including chip design and more energy
efficient software coding.60 Microsoft has begun to point to an
increased amount renewable electricity supply in its own
operations, including a recent contract to buy wind power for its
new energy efficient data centre in Dublin.61 However, Microsoft
does not have an overarching reduction goal to guide its
investments, having chosen an energy intensity target instead.

The world’s most famous micro-blogging service has been
expanding at breakneck speed, currently adding nearly half a
million accounts on average a day62, and generating over 8
terabytes (TB) of data a day (the NY Stock Exchange generates 1
TB day according to Twitter).63

Transparency: F

Twitter has largely maintained an official radio silence on the
location and size of its data centres, with the exception of an
announcement that it would move its technical operations to Salt
Lake City in late 201064. News reports at time of publication
reflected considerable confusion and lack of transparency on
whether Twitter had migrated fully to Salt Late City Facility, or had
remained in California.65 Twitter has at least put out some basic
information on the volume of data it is generating.66 Twitter does
not participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project voluntary reporting
programme.

Infrastructure siting: F

Prior to the relocation to Salt Lake City, Utah, in March 2011, the
bulk of Twitter’s infrastructure was managed under a hosting
arrangement with NTT America in a co-located facility in San Jose,
California.67 Although NTT America had touted Twitter’s concern
over environmental footprint in promotional materials, Twitter’s
move from San Jose to Utah, which has an electric utility mix that is
97% fossil fuel-based (81% coal) as compared with 27%
renewable (w/ <1% Coal and 20% nuclear), is a huge step
backwards for Twitter.

Mitigation: F

A move to Utah’s coal intensive electricity grid means that Twitter
has its work cut out for it to mitigate the footprint of its new facility.
Twitter’s estimated total electricity load in Utah could easily be met
by clean sources of energy, and should be prioritised for discussion
with its new facility operator in Utah.

Yahoo!

Yahoo! is one of the biggest online destinations, and it maintains
data centres and co-located servers around the world to support
its user base. Yahoo!’s most recent data centre investments have
reflected a heightened awareness of the importance of siting near
clean energy sources and the full economic and environmental
benefits that energy efficient design can offer, when combined with
clean sources of electricity.

Transparency: D

Yahoo!’s environmental reporting is largely devoid of the data or
metrics necessary to evaluate the performance of its data centres.
It cites ‘competitive reasons’ for excluding this data from reporting
under the Carbon Disclosure Project.68 Yahoo! and the sector
would be well served by its sharing of the metrics it is using to track
its carbon reduction goals.

Infrastructure siting: B

In 2009, tied to the announcement of its new Lockport, New York
data centre, Yahoo! moved away from its ‘carbon neutral’ policy69,
which relied on the purchase of offsets, and committed to reducing
its operational footprint directly through energy efficiency
improvements and clean energy.70 With the exception of its
Nebraska facility, Yahoo!’s recent data centre siting decisions have
put Yahoo! on a cleaner energy path.

Mitigation: C

In place of its prior commitment to ‘carbon neutrality’, Yahoo! has
committed to reduce the carbon intensity of its data centres by at
least 40% by 2014.71 Yahoo! should shift this to an absolute
reduction target, and combine it with a clean energy goal to help
drive even more investment in clean sources of electricity for its
data centres.
