Global demand for cheap seafood is one of the
key drivers of both environmental degradation
and human rights abuses in the fishing industry.

is often connected to other forms of criminal activity,

some  of  the  most  lawless  places  on  the  planet,

where  both  environmental  and  social  crimes
routinely  go  unpunished.11  Exploitation  of  workers
in the fishing sector is of growing concern globally,

particularly  following  multiple  high-profile  exposés
focusing  on  Southeast  Asia  in  recent  years.12/13/14
Human rights abuse in the fishing sector is a global

problem occurring across the world and one which

including
Illegal,  Unreported  and  Unregulated

enforcement over both fishing operations and labour

standards has meant that our oceans have become

a  scene  of  environmental  destruction  and  where

internationally accepted human rights standards are

regularly violated in the pursuit of profit.

THE MOTIVE

Global  demand  for  cheap  seafood  is  one  of  the

key drivers of both environmental degradation and

human rights abuses in the fishing industry. During

“The broker called us ‘soccer balls’, meaning that we were under their
feet and could be kicked anywhere and didn’t have the ability to go
anywhere on our own.

About four or five days before the reefer left, six friends and I –men
who are still on the fishing boat – tried to escape but we couldn’t. They
punched us and we weren’t even allowed to eat after that.

On [the Wijaya 29] I was beaten because I was not as strong as the
others – when they were carrying frozen blocks of fish, I couldn’t. I
wasn’t strong enough and fast enough to finish the job. That was why
I was beaten on that boat.

We met with the [Indonesian] authorities [at sea]. They just came close to
the boat and talked with the captain on the radio, asking who the boss is
and which company owned the boat. Later, after they had left, the company
office would call the captain to tell him how much they had paid to the
authorities…After that, they didn’t bother us again and we could catch fish
anywhere in the sea.”

“We were not allowed to leave the room. One guy tried to escape, but
he was beaten. Another was beaten until his leg was broken so we
didn’t dare flee. There were 13 of us in a group. The guy who had his
leg broken was an example to us, the ones who wanted to flee. So we
didn’t dare try to escape.

Those  who’d  been  beaten  in  [Samut  Sakhon]  were  also  sent  to  the
boat and when the boat arrived in port [in Ambon], they tried to flee
again. The captain caught them with the help of the police who sent
them to jail. I don’t know whether they were deported or not.

We could have a decent shower whenever it rained.

If I can take legal action against [the captain], I want to confront him
face to face in court.

The Thais treated us Burmese badly. They didn’t allow us to eat much,
the meals they gave us were small and not enough. They shouted at us
and swore at us and pushed us to work even while we were eating. We
would never get to eat enough. Our lives were really tough out there, I
was so disappointed.”

RECOMMENDATIONS

As  the  largest  tuna  company  in  the  world, Thai  Union  must
take  immediate  steps  to  address  labour  abuses  and  end
destructive, unsustainable fishing practices in its own supply
chain while leading the whole tuna industry towards increased
social and environmental compliance. As a priority TU should:

1.  Commit  to  not  sourcing  from  fisheries
where labour and human rights abuses are
present  and  demonstrate  this  with  third-
party audited documentation.

3.  Stop  sourcing  from  destructive  and
wasteful  long-lines  fisheries  where  shark
capture and finning remains endemic, and
where there continues to be high levels of
bycatch.

2.  Commit  to  end  and  phase  out
transshipments at sea.

from  fisheries

that
4.  Stop  sourcing
deploy  destructive  purse  seines  with  Fish
Aggregating  Devices
(FADs),  and  from
fisheries where FAD regulations and control
remains largely non-existent.

Greenpeace is asking TU to provide more than just policy announcements that commit to making these

changes.  TU  must  provide  detailed  workplans  with  clear  milestones  and  schedules  explaining  how  they

intend to make these changes to their supply chains so that the companies’ progress can be effectively

monitored.
