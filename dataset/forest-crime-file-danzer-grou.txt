Danzer Group still under investigation
In 2004, Swiss Attorney General began a formal investigation into companies of the 
Danzer Group, as well as individuals, based on two complaints filed by Greenpeace Switzerland. The cases were previously documented in earlier versions of this report: 1) bribery of foreign public officials, and; 2) suspected forgery.
On 21 December 2004, the Attorney General ordered the closure of the preliminary 
investigation into the alleged bribery of foreign public officials. All official documents, including the aforementioned decision, were handed over to the public prosecutor’s office in the Canton District of Zug, Switzerland. The suspected forgery complaint still remains to be investigated by the competent authorities in the Canton of Zug. The documents submitted support the suspicion that employees of a Danzer Group company were involved in the forgery of official government certificates.
Greenpeace has not yet been given the grounds upon which the Attorney General 
closed the preliminary investigation into the alleged bribery of foreign public officials. Greenpeace only filed the complaint and therefore does not enjoy the rights of a party in the legal proceedings. Danzer Group has so far refused to provide Greenpeace with a copy of the Attorney General’s decision. Furthermore, the Danzer Group has not given a satisfactory explanation of the evidence put forward by Greenpeace in its reports. The complaints to the Attorney General by Greenpeace, in particular with regards to the activities as described in the travel report written by one of the directors of the Danzer Group, remains unexplained.

Greenpeace will continue to closely scrutinise the activities of the Danzer Group. As a 
leading timber company Danzer Group should only be involved in the supply of legal and sustainable timber, as it claims to be in its reports.
1
What is the Danzer Group?
The Danzer Group has its origins in 1932, when Karl Danzer founded his first veneer trading company in Paris. After the Second World War, Danzer started to build an industrial veneer empire, opening his own veneer mill in Reutlingen, Germany in 1947.
2 
From these early years, Danzer combined the production of tropical veneers with the operation of his own logging concessions in Africa. 
The Group has since developed into one of the world’s biggest producers of hardwood 
veneers, with annual sales of over € 500 million,
3 as well as one of the biggest 
international traders in tropical roundwood, sliced wood and veneers. T oday the Danzer Group operates thirteen veneer mills and five sawmills around the world and a number of large timber concessions. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and neighbouring Republic of Congo (RC), Danzer Group’s concessions cover more than 4 million hectares of rainforest, an area larger than Switzerland.

Danzer Group involved in bribery, illegal logging, dealings with blacklisted arms trafficker and suspected of forgery

Since its foundation, the Danzer Group has always been led by a member of the German 
Danzer family. From 2002 the Chief Executive Officer has been Hans-Joachim Danzer, a third generation Danzer.
4 Up until July 2004 the Group’s management holding was 
however, ANBE AG,5 headquartered in Switzerland, which described its owners as 
“private German shareholders.”6 The company has since been renamed to Danzer AG to 
associate itself with the Danzer Group at large.
Since 1962, Danzer Group’s international trade in tropical timber has also been based in 
Switzerland, through Interholco AG. From there, Danzer Group’s global trading in tropical roundwood, lumber and veneer is organised. 
Interholco’s main procurement area is Africa, and it buys from other group companies 
SIFORCO (in DRC) and IFO (in RC), as well as from numerous third party suppliers. Interholco procures wood not only from the last rainforests being destroyed in West and Central Africa, but in many cases from companies that have been documented to be involved in illegal logging or, until very recently, associated with arms trafficking activities.
7 
Moreover, as this case study demonstrates, Danzer Group companies do not hesitate to bribe officials in Africa, thus violating national as well as international laws and regulations.
Africa’s remaining rainforests 
The remaining rainforests in Central and West Africa are the last refuge for threatened species such as lowland gorillas, chimpanzees, forest elephants and also bonobos, man’s closest relative. These rainforests safeguard the survival of thousands of species of animals and plants and are home to many millions of indigenous people. According to the most recent calculations, only one-third of the original forests in Africa still remain, and less than one-tenth are still big enough to permanently maintain the biodiversity of a large intact rainforest.
8 
Destructive logging nonetheless continues largely unabated in Africa. Experts consider over three-quarters of all remaining frontier forests in Africa are threatened, mostly by the timber industry.
9 These forests have been at the epicentre of violent conflicts 
for the past decades in several African countries, from Sierra Leone to the Democratic Republic of Congo, from Liberia and the Ivory Coast to Central Africa Republic. Local populations have been held hostage, either to militias and armies, or to all-powerful industrial groups seeking profits at any cost.
The problem of corruption
The World Bank has identified corruption as “the single greatest obstacle to economic and 
social development” and regards its harmful effects to be especially severe on the poor. Particularly concerned about timber exploitation, the Bank states: “There are huge rents to 
be earned from activities such as logging in tropical rain forests, where permits can be obtained corruptly or where inspectors can be bribed.”
10 In recent years, therefore, the Bank has 
supported over 600 anti-corruption programmes. 
Also aiming to combat corruption, the member states of the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed to a Convention on Combating Bribery of 
Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, which went into effect on 15 February, 1999. This Convention makes it a crime “to offer, promise or give a bribe to a 
foreign public official in order to obtain or retain international business deals.”
11 The signatory 
states agreed to apply “effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties” to those 
who bribe foreign public officials. The Convention further requires that countries are able to seize or confiscate the bribe and the profits gained thereof.
12 All OECD members 
have ratified this convention, including Switzerland (in 2000) and Germany (1999), and are thus obliged to take action against companies within their jurisdiction that are known to be involved in corruption.5 ANBE Aktiengesellschaft

Danzer Group dealing in baksheesh and gifts
Some of the African countries in which the Danzer Group operates are considered to be 
among the most corrupt and violent in the world. The international NGO Transparency International places the Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast and Cameroon among the 30 worst out of 130 countries surveyed.
13 Instead of complying with national laws and the 
OECD Convention, and setting standards for sustainable development it purports to uphold,
14 The Danzer Group continues to support a logging sector that is fuelling rampant 
corruption in the region. 
In a confidential report about Danzer Group’s business activities in Africa, written by René 
Giger, one of the two executive directors of Interholco AG, in April 2003 and obtained by Greenpeace, Giger summarises: 
“With regards to gifts/frais de mission (baksheesh), three philosophies occur to me in Africa. In 
Douala
15 one is blackmailed into having to pay baksheesh amounting to hundreds of thousands 
of FF16, and this is also paid out liberally. In Congo (Kinshasa),17 Mr. H… tries to be more 
restrained but nevertheless is prepared to pay where necessary. At IFO both Mr S.... and Mr D...., are absolutely against such gifts and are also about to rigorously eliminate the old sinecures. Mr S....’s philosophy is not to give any gifts in advance in order to avoid any possible difficulties. If there is any threat of a fine, so-called conditioned cases, he is, however prepared to take care of this by giving a gift.”
 
The scale of bribery practices by Danzer Group's employees in Africa is not fully known and requires further investigation. However, for IFO (RC) - the subsidiary with seemingly the most stringent approach to bribery – an attachment to the travel report by Mr. Giger estimates possible annual savings of around 
€50,000 from cutting back on “frais de mission which up to 
now have been mostly paid from force of habit.”  
The way “gifts” are used is explained by Giger’s report in a reference to one of Danzer Group’s Cameroon subsidiaries, CCIB. According to Giger, the tax authority in Cameroon insists on a “fiscal control”, which he urgently tries to avoid, as there apparently have been “undeclared exports of IHC [Interholco] via Alima F.”
18 Giger casually notes: “Mr. F…. 
is trying to resolve this matter with FRF 20-30,000 [around €3000-4500].”

4 Greenpeace International“In Douala, one is 
blackmailed into having to pay baksheesh amounting to hundreds of thousands of FF, and this is also paid out liberally.”
R. Giger, one of the two 
executive directors of Interholco AG, April 2003

In another section, Giger discusses a tax demand, including fines, for €360 million against 
SIFORCO in DRC. Whilst the Danzer Group declared timber deliveries from IFO, in 
neighbouring Republic of Congo, to SIFORCO as tax-free transit business, the state of DRC now claims this to be a taxable import/export activity. On the advice of a local tax advisor, Giger suggests that the demand is due to “rivalry between the authorities“ and claims that the 
“whole matter was instigated by a dismissed employee“.  T o solve this problem Giger states “It is 
calculated that a maximum of US$ 50,000 will be needed to get this whole thing off the table” . 
SIFORCO was founded in 1976 as a joint venture between the Danzer Group and the German governmental development agency DEG (Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft). Although today it is fully owned by the Danzer Group, it is still financially supported by DEG.
19
In its July 2004 public response to the Greenpeace report,20 the Danzer Group tried 
to explain that their “gift“ and “baksheesh“ payments to officials in Africa are necessary 
as a legal requirement under a “Frais de Mission (daily allowance).” However, they do not 
explain, for example, how being “blackmailed [in the port of Douala] into having to pay 
baksheesh amounting to hundreds of thousands of FF“ (as stated in Giger’s travel report) is required by law. 
In the attachment to Giger‘s travel report (under Section 10) the full text sheds some 
further light on what the Danzer Group really mean by “Gifts and Frais de Mission“. It 
states, refering to the Republic of Congo: “On account of the increase in taxes IFO can not 
afford giving any gratuities which do not bring in services directly in return. Frais de mission which up to now have been mostly paid from force of habit will from now on be paid only in accordance with the current legislation.” This is revealing. Danzer Group has confirmed that 
to pay Frais de Mission only as required by law, not as conditioned by habit, represents a change of practice, in the Republic of Congo at least. Giger estimated that savings for the company, as detailed in the same attachment, would amount to 
€50,000.
Furthermore, in a recent letter to a customer they make the remarkable claim that so-called 
“gifts” are something that the Danzer Group gives to “support various 
charitable organisations” and they reject what they consider to be “allegations of bribery 
and corruption”. Whilst the Danzer Group does undoubtedly give money to charitable organisations, Giger’s travel report highlights that they also make payments for other purposes (ie “If there is any threat of a fine, so-called conditioned cases, he [Mr S... at IFO] is, 
however prepared to take care of this by giving a gift.”
Danzer Group finances illegal loggers
In Cameroon, Interholco purchases logs and timber from the logging company Mba Mba Georges (MMG), with which it has a close financial partnership. Through loans to MMG, Interholco seems to have secured exclusive marketing rights for all MMG products. MMG has only recently become active in Cameroon, and has a sawmill in the south west of the country, near the port of Kribi. In 2000, MMG was involved in illegal logging on a massive scale. It was documented as being active outside the limits of one of its authorised logging areas. Indeed, MMG logged 1,000 hectares of an area planned for a community forest, with the local population incurring enormous damage. It used the marking “ARB-288”, assigned for another logging permit, on the trees felled, and in the same year, Greenpeace detected these very same logs at the German port of Nordenham – imported by Interholco.
While this case of illegal logging by MMG has been well documented in several reports,
21 
the company has never been fined for these infractions. On the contrary, despite the 
Cameroonian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MINEF) 2000 criteria for new concession awards, which define such infractions as “grounds for disqualification”

[from auctions], MMG won the 125,568 hectare concession UFA 00-003 in July 2000, only

€1 million).23 
In a letter dated 29 September, 2003 to Greenpeace, Switzerland, IHC (part of Danzer Group) stated:
 “Interholco of course rejects any business with companies involved in illegal logging. Such 
activities, however, have to  be proven or there must at least be clear indications.  
To our knowledge, this is not the case for MMG.”

The letter is signed by Ulrich Grauert, one of the two executive directors of Interholco AG. Grauert seems to have a poor memory as in April 2003 he was directly informed by René Giger (his co-director at Interholco) about MMG’s ongoing illegal logging in the newly obtained concession UFA 00-003. In his confidential travel report, referring to MMG, Giger states: “Logging volumes are not being achieved. Yield is not being achieved because the diameters are too small. MMG is already felling illegally in the next coupe [cut block];
24 as a result, next year the 
same coupe will be worthless again.”
Just as Giger’s remark indicates ongoing illegal logging activities by MMG beyond the 2000 incident, the company also continues to evade its financial obligations. The concession gained in 2000 came with a management plan financed with over FCFA 200 million (about 
€300,000) from the “Canadian Co-operation”, to be paid back by whoever obtained the concession. MMG, four years later, has still to pay more than FCFA 170 million (about 
€255,000). It was recently formally notified of its failure to pay back the management plan in a public communiqué by the Ministry of Forestry.

traded by Interholco (IHC) with 
marking “ARB-288” partially erased to hide true origin, Port of Kribi, 2000. From Auzel et al 
(2002a).

In its July 2004 public response to the Greenpeace report, the Danzer Group26 claimed 
that it is “absurd“ to link them with illegal logging, saying that they agree with Greenpeace, 
that “view ecologically non-compliant forest usage and trade in wood from illegal sources as a 
danger to large-scale ecosystems“. Yet they never refuted this financial link with MMG, nor 
the illegal logging documented by MINEF officials in 2000 (which estimated the stolen timber to be worth over 
€1 million). They also did not comment on the evidence of 
illegal logging inside MMG’s concession UFA 00-003, as highlighted in Giger‘s travel report. 
In a recent letter to a customer Danzer Group concluded, following what is described as 
an internal assessment, that the “concerns expressed by Mr Giger [in his travel report] were 
unjustified and that MMG had all the necessary permits for the felling.” The letter does not explain how Giger could have been so wrong on this issue given that he did not reach his views in isolation; his report of the current activities of MMG was based on face-to-face discussions with Mr Tillmann, the Danzer Group's contact and representative at the company, during a visit on 14th April 2003. 
MMG's history of illegal logging means an independent investigations of their logging activities is long overdue.
Danzer Group, war and arms trafficking 
Following years of debate, on 7 July 2003, the UN Security Council (UNSC) imposed sanctions on the import of Liberian timbers. The UNSC was forced to take this drastic, unprecedented measure because international dealers such as Interholco had been unwilling to voluntarily stop trading with an industry that financed Liberian president and warlord Charles Taylor. 
The UNSC regarded Taylor as a major destabilizing factor in the region, for instance 
through his orchestration of the activities of the RUF rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone. The RUF controlled Sierra Leone’s
27 diamond fields and moved diamonds illegally 
out of the country via Liberia. For this reason, in March 200128 the UNSC had imposed 
sanctions on trade in diamonds from Liberia, as well as banning 130 members of Taylor’s entourage from travelling.These included Maurice Cooper, co-owner of the Inland Logging Company (ILC).
29 
Danzer Group’s Interholco AG had a very close partnership with ILC. It was the company’s exclusive agent for the export of timber.
30 The company reported that it had 
officially exported 19,815 m3 of logs in 2000, but the UNSC Panel Experts estimated that this figure was closer to 50,000 m3. The ILC also maintained a private militia in Sinoe County and managed the port of Greenville.
31 The militia have been reported as 
harassing local people.32 
Besides exporting Liberian wood supplied by the ILC, Interholco also procured from the Oriental Timber Company (OTC) and the Maryland Wood Processing Industry (MWPI). The OTC’s manager, Dutchman Gus van Kouwenhouven, was regarded by the UNSC as a key figure in the logistics of illegal arms movements to Liberia.
33 The MWPI controlled 
Port Harper in the south of the country and has also been accused of involvement in illegal arms shipments entering Liberia through this port.
34 Only increased rebel activities 
and finally the UNSC sanctions stopped Interholco trading with OTC, MWPI and other Liberian suppliers.
Trading in Liberian logs and with the OTC in particular did not, however, prevent the 
Danzer Group stating, in a letter (10 January, 2002) sent to a German citizen: “The 
Danzer Group and all its subsidiary companies will do absolutely no business with companies which trade arms ... In our business-to-business relations we make decisions solely in accordance with our standards and in no event do we wish our business relationships to be misused for financing weapons or civil wars.”

The Danzer Group has remarkably claimed, in its July 2004 public response to the 
Greenpeace report,35 that it “provided clarification on this  [issue] long ago. Litigious questions 
and accusations were pursued and have been dispelled as unsubstantiated.”  Yet, despite their con-
tinual denials, new evidence has been made available to Greenpeace that further document the Group’s trade activities with companies and individuals linked to arms trafficking.
Recent investigations carried out by the Concession Review Commission, established by 
the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL), uncovered a close business link between OTC and the Danzer Group’s partner ILC.
36 The Commission was set up to 
determine the legitimacy of existing logging concessions and provide recommendations to the NTGL.  They requested that every logging company with concession agreements file all relevant documentation, complete questionnaires, and appear before the Commission to provide further information. Many complied with one or all of these requests and the Commission immediately cleared 24 companies. ILC was amongst those that failed to conform and hence were not cleared by the Commission, along with LFDC/OTC, Royal Timber Company (RTC), LEC/Natura, MWPI and BIN.
In their report dated May 13th 2004,
37 the Commission highlighted that ILC was operating 
as a contracting company to OTC, amongst other companies. Additionally, it accused ILC of 
engaging in practices that “occasioned economic sabotage“  and for “not paying taxes to [the] 
government directly but were seemingly doing so directly to the President or his authorized accounts.”
OTC was the largest timber company operating in Liberia in part due to a special rela-
tionship between Kouwenhoven and Taylor.38 Upon obtaining presidency, Taylor rewarded 
Kouwenhoven by assigning him the largest timber concession agreement in Liberian his-tory, totalling 1.24 million hectares.
39 In return for these concessions OTC promised 
jobs and other social benefits. The NGO Global Witness reported that Taylor personally received between US$3-5 million for these massive concession allocations.
40 However, this 
only helped Taylor finance his war and continue subjecting the people of Liberia to further social conflict and human rights abuses.
Between 2000 and 2003, Liberia accounted for up to one-third of Interholco’s total 
tropical timber supplies, with ILC and OTC being their largest Liberian suppliers. During this period these companies plundered, abused and devastated the forest and the forest resources of Liberia at the expense of it's people. The Commission recommended that the individuals behind these companies should be “investigated and punished where appropriate.”
 
One of these individuals is Kouwenhoven, who acted as the manager of both OTC and RTC. Since 2000, Kouwenhoven has been listed on a UNSC travel ban for his role in arms and diamond dealing on behalf of former President Taylor. These funds supported Taylor's efforts to destabilize Sierra Leone.
41 The UNSC also listed Kouwenhoven as an individual 
whose financial assets should be frozen to prohibit him from “using misappropriated funds 
and property to interfere in the restoration of peace and stability in Liberia.”42 
Although Kouwenhoven’s involvement with OTC seemed to have come to an end when the UNSC placed sanctions on Liberian timber, Greenpeace has obtained clear evidence that he is still active in the African timber business. Despite the travel ban on Kouwenhoven, during 2004 he has been working in the Republic of Congo, directly involved with the logistical and financial operations of a logging company based in Pointe Noire, Afribois SA.  Based on documents obtained by Greenpeace, it is clear that Kouwenhoven has been shipping logs from Afribois to Interholco (Danzer Group) during 2004; this is despite the UNSC travel ban and asset sanctions on Kouwenhoven still being in place. However, the Danzer Group once again does not seem to have any moral prob-lems with maintaining a business relationship with this sanctioned arms trafficker.

htmlDanzer Group employees and suspected forgery
Greenpeace has obtained several Phytosanitary Certificates and Certificates of Origin that are suspected of been forged by Danzer Group staff. A Phytosanitary Certificate is an official document issued by an exporting country, which a certifies that the phytosanitary status of a shipment meets the phytosanitary regulations of the importing country.
43
Phytosanitary (anti-pest) treatment of timber is required in order to protect importing countries from the introduction of harmful pests. Copies of Phytosanitary Certificates appear to have been forged with the help of a pair of scissors, white tape and a colour photocopier, enabling official stamps and signatures to be cut and pasted on certificates 
for timber exports from a number of African countries, including Liberia, Cameroon 
and Equatorial Guinea. These certificates are hard to distinguish from the official ones, normally issued by the federal authorities or Chamber of Commerce of the respective export countries.

The above four Phytosanitary Certificates all bear identical stamps and signatures, even though they have supposedly been issued months apart by the Head of the Phytosanitary Police Post in Douala port, Cameroon.
45In the case of Certificates of Origin,44 required to attest the country of origin of the 
timber, Greenpeace has obtained blank copies already complete with the necessary official stamps and, in some cases, signatures. These blank copies would facilitate the forging of certificates of origin, making them appear to be genuine.
Shipping documents obtained by Greenpeace provide further evidence on how these 
prepared certificates have been used. In August 2000, Interholco couriered copies of Phytosanitary Certificates and Certificates of Origin to their agent in Turkey, Aziz Atasoy. 
Habitat loss or degradation are 
major threats to gorilla populations 
in West and Central Africa. Where new areas of forest are opened up for logging, the bushmeat trade 
often rises in order to support 
the incoming labour force and 
to export bushmeat to urban 
markets. © Greenpeace

Call to action
This report represents nothing more than one case study. The practices and behaviour 
outlined here, though illegal and unethical, are very widespread among companies operating in the international timber trade. 
Bribery and other illegal activities continue unmonitored and in almost all cases with 
complete impunity. Without decisive and credible action by governments, international agencies and consumers to control the practices of the international timber trade, the world’s remaining ancient forests will continue to be a natural “resource”, nonchalantly, yet ruthlessly and unethically, exploited and destroyed. The local communities dependent upon them will continue to suffer directly and indirectly from the fierce battles to control, extract and appropriate these resources. 
Yet there is hope for Africa’s rainforests, if key players commit to taking action.
Specifically:
• African countries where Danzer Group timber originates must open an inquiry into 
the evidence uncovered in this investigation, and prosecute companies and individuals found to be involved in bribery, corruption and illegal logging. Initiatives such as the Cameroonian Anti-Corruption Commission should be utilised in these inquiries.
• European countries, including Switzerland, must amend their legislation on bribery 
and money laundering to include illegal logging and associated trade. EU companies found guilty overseas should be prosecuted under EU legislation. Swiss companies found guilty overseas should be prosecuted under Swiss legislation. 
• European countries must act swiftly to adopt new legislation through the FLEGT 
(Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade) process aimed at halting the import and trade of illegally sourced timber and timber products in Europe. Switzerland should also adopt similar legislation. Such legislation should impose penalties against companies found guilty and give the relevant authorities the legal means to prosecute and dismantle the organized criminal networks.
• Companies must immediately stop buying timber products derived from companies 
involved in illegal activities (such as illegal logging, bribery, forced labour, arms trafficking, etc.) until the producers can demonstrate, through independent third-party verification, that they comply with all legislation.
