One way to look at human history is through the peri-
odic  struggles  between  those  embodying  the  cor-
rupting influence of power and those who have kept
such  power  in  check  or  even  successfully  under-
mined  it.    The  American  Revolution  is  arguably  the
birth of the freedom movement in the Western world,
although the British might argue that the birth of the
"rights of man" came from the issuing of the Magna
Carta and frankly, all cultures can point to great liber-
ators of one era or another.

experiment  on  the  global  climate.    We  have  already
been provided a glimpse of what happens as global
warming  goes  unabated,  from  the  loss  of  low  lying
island  nations  and  beaches  the  world  over,  to  the
spread  of  infectious  diseases,  disrupted  agriculture,
more severe weather cycles including super storms,
more droughts, more floods, and ultimately the mas-
sive die-off of the great forests, the disappearance of
many  glaciers,  and  the  further  accelerated  loss  of
biodiversity.

Regardless of where it began, every massive center
of  unaccountable  power,  whether  it  be  the  Roman
Catholic Church of the Middle Ages, the city states of
Europe  or  the  ideology  based  governments  of  the
last  century  have  all  met  their  match  and  ultimately
lost their power when enough people were pushed to
the  breaking  point  and  chose  to  take  back  their
inalienable rights.

ExxonMobil is now such a power.  Unaccountable to
the  U.S.  Congress,  calling  out  orders  to  the  White
House, afoul of countless regulations governing envi-
ronmental behavior at all levels of government, pay-
ing  politicians  for  favors,  and  undermining  the  very
reasons American colonists fought for the right to a
"more perfect union."

As has been documented in the pages that follow in
the latest Greenpeace report: Denial and Deception: A
Chronicle of ExxonMobil’s Corruption of the Debate on
Global  Warming,  ExxonMobil,  the  world’s  second
largest  corporation  has  successfully  used  its  profits
to  stall  efforts  to  stop  the  greatest  ecological  threat
facing the world today – global warming.

Corporations that have sought haven in democracies
and  then  used  these  rights  to  circumvent,  ignore  or
change  laws  to  their  whims  have  come  under  the
glare  of  the  modern  day  freedom  fighters.    As  has
been documented in this report, ExxonMobil stands
out  as  perhaps  the  most  significant  organization  on
Earth pushing civilization headlong into a dangerous

ExxonMobil’s  role  in  defeating  efforts  to  stop  global
warming is impressive.  It has included the paying of
skeptic scientists to confuse the public and the lob-
bying and paying of politicians to do nothing – all the
way  up  to  the  White  House.    It  has  included  intimi-
dating credible scientists who hold the majority view
that global warming is happening and is, in part, driv-
en  by  humans.    All  of  this  history  has  finally  been
pulled  together  into  one  concise  well-documented
report  that  reads  like  it  should  be  turned  into  a
screenplay  like  "Erin  Brockovich"  and  "A  Civil
Action."

But  what  is  most  hopeful,  despite  the  frightening
nature  of  the  report,  is  that  activists  the  world  over
are  now  looking  at  ExxonMobil  as  the  key  corpora-
tion creating the logjam over global warming. Further,
the growing awareness of ExxonMobil’s human rights
violations  around  the  world,  an  expanding  student
activist  movement  in  the  U.S.,  boycotts  in  the  U.S.
and  UK,  religious
leaders  organizing  against
ExxonMobil for justice, one thing is certain: a widely
distributed,  organic  campaign  is  developing  against
ExxonMobil that is seeking to reform this corporation
on many levels.

It  remains  to  be  seen  just  how  much  pressure  for
positive  change  will  be  generated  against
ExxonMobil.    Its  willful  acts  of  arrogance  in  dealing
with  the  environmental  problems  it  creates  and  its
human  rights  abuses,  have  made  ExxonMobil  the
most commonly discussed target for reform since the

i

anti-WTO  protests  in  Seattle.    ExxonMobil  is  now
standing  in  the  path  of  history,  which  has  provided
spectacular  examples  of  David  beating  Goliath,
across the 20th century including the movement led
by  Gandhi  to  free  the  Indian  people,  the  U.S.  civil
rights  movement  and  Solidarity’s  defeat  of  Polish
communism.  The  goliath  ExxonMobil  may  provide
the perfect catalyst for much needed reform of cor-
porate power. As Ken Cohen, ExxonMobil’s head of
government relations and public affairs noted to The
Guardian (July 11, 2001), "We know we have a giant
target painted on our chests."

I  have  no  doubt  that  ExxonMobil  will  either  fall  or
reform in due time.  Wrongful behavior, whether out
of malice or ignorance cannot long stand.  The ques-
tion,  however,  remains,  will  ExxonMobil  be  stopped
before  global  warming  is  beyond  the  point  of  no
return?    Only  time  will  tell.    In  the  meantime,
Greenpeace  will  do  everything  in  its  power  to  stop
ExxonMobil’s rampant disregard for the planet and its
people.  This report provides a foundational piece of
research  to  aid  in  the  efforts  of  activists  the  world
over  to  kick  off  the  21st  century  with  either  a  great
reformation  or  an  even  greater  dissolution  of
ExxonMobil, the most powerful entity to have sucked
the  life  out  of  the  efforts  to  stop  global  warming.
There is still time to breathe new life into those efforts
once ExxonMobil is cleared from the path.

Executive Summary

Global warming eclipses all other environmental chal-
lenges  of  the  21st  century.  There  is  undeniable  proof
that pollution from the burning of oil, coal and other
fossil fuels is the root cause of the observed climate
changes to date. Global warming is already occurring,
with evidence piling up weekly of radical climate dis-
ruption.  If  left  unchecked,  the  catastrophe  of  global
warming  threatens  to  cause  weather  disasters  and
climate  disruption  that  will  destabilize  and  destroy
ecosystems, economies and societies worldwide.

Throughout  the  last  decade,  ExxonMobil  has  been
viewed  internationally  as  the  number  one  company
driving  the  ongoing  industry  campaign  to  derail  the
international  agreement  to  solve  global  warming.
While other oil companies are still polluting the envi-
ronment  and
for  pro-oil  policies,
ExxonMobil  epitomizes  the  worst  of  corporate
America’s onslaught against climate protection. Prior
to the 1999 merger, both Exxon and Mobil were lead-
ers  of  American  oil  industry  efforts  against  global
warming action.  The merger of these two giants truly
created  what  some  have  called  the  “Death  Star”  of
the global warming debate.

lobbying

ExxonMobil and their allies have long spearheaded a
corporate war against environmental regulations that
threaten  to  control  the  negative  attributes  of  their
core business – fossil fuel exploitation and use. They
give  millions  of  dollars  to  political  campaigns  and
candidates and spend millions more on lobbyists and
advertisements in order to achieve policies that allow
them  to  act  with  impunity.  As  a  result  of  this  effort
they  get  large  financial  payback  in  the  form  of  gov-
ernment subsidies, tax breaks, and access to public
lands.

standing or for further identification of potential solu-
tions.”i Conversely  said  Dahan,  ExxonMobil  has
“become increasingly convinced that the only sensi-
ble  approach  is  to  take  a  longer  term  perspective,”
adding that “if warming turns out to be a real prob-
lem, will we be willing to shut down the economies of
the industrialized world…?”ii

This  report,  Denial  and  Deception:  A  Chronicle  of
ExxonMobil’s  Efforts  to  Corrupt  the  Global  Warming
Debate, details more than a decade of deliberate and
persistent efforts by ExxonMobil and its front groups
to  derail  the  evolving  global  warming  treaty  and  the
scientific  consensus  that  urgently  supports  the
international agreement. The report also delves into
emerging  ties between  the  ExxonMobil  agenda  and
the  damaging global  warming  legacy  of  the  Bush
administration.

Since  the  early  1990s,  Exxon  and  Mobil  have  taken
leading roles in industry efforts to cast doubt over cli-
mate  science.  With  the  now  defunct  Global  Climate
Coalition  front  group  and  others,  ExxonMobil  has
claimed  that  the  scientists  are  getting  it  wrong  on
global warming and the role of fossil fuels. This ongo-
ing effort was spawned by the revelations of the first
report  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate
Change (IPCC) in 1990, which pointed to strong and
growing  evidence  of  temperature  rise,  sea  level  rise
and other changes resulting from rising emissions of
carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  and  other  greenhouse  gases.
That report stressed the need for a 60 to 80 percent
cut  in  CO2  emissions  just  to  stabilize  rising  atmos-
pheric  concentrations  of  this  greenhouse  gas.  This
call for emission cuts was received by Exxon, Mobil
and others as a direct attack on their core business.

ExxonMobil  continues  to  stall  the  debate.  In  early
May,  René  Dahan,  the  Director  and  Executive  Vice
President of ExxonMobil, speaking at the G-8 Energy
Ministers meeting in Detroit, stated that “with regard
to  potential  climate  change,  some  people  have
decided  not  to  wait  for  additional  scientific  under-

ExxonMobil’s campaign to slow the progress of sci-
entific  validation  of  global  warming  started  with  the
use of paid skeptic scientists to publicly rebut scien-
tific  advances.  Exxon  has  also  actively  engaged  in
manipulation of international scientific assessments.
In 1998, Exxon was involved in developing a $6 mil-

iii

getting ‘off the hook’ by not having to cut their emis-
sions. One television ad against the impending treaty
claimed  “it’s  not  global  and
it  won’t  work.”
Meanwhile, Exxon CEO Lee Raymond was in China
at the World Petroleum Congress warning developing
countries  that  the  Kyoto  Protocol  would  limit  eco-
nomic  growth.  He  said  that  the  developing  world
should  both  increase  the  use  of  fossil  fuels  and  not
limit oil exploitation within their borders, lest they lose
Western corporate investment.

As recently as this year, Exxon subsidiary Imperial Oil
in Canada is known to have lobbied heavily to get the
Canadian Government to back out of promises to rat-
ify the Kyoto Protocol. In January, CEO Lee Raymond
was said to have met with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair in a preview of the Bush climate plan (alternative
to  the  Kyoto  Protocol)  seeking  Blair’s  tacit  approval
of the upcoming plan.

Finally,  looking  at  the  actions  of  the  corporation
behind the policy rhetoric, we track Exxon’s irrespon-
sible  and  continuing  rejection  of  clean  renewable
energy  development  –  the  clear  solution  to  global
warming. In 2001, ExxonMobil earned $15.3 billion in
profits and its return on capital was 17.8 percent. The
corporation’s  total  capital  expenditures  were  $12.3
billioniv,  and  its  upstream  capital  and  exploration
expenditures  totaled  around  $8.8  billion.v But
ExxonMobil  did  not  invest  one  penny  in  renewable
energy  technologies.  ExxonMobil,  as  the  second
largest  global  corporation,  by  all  means  has  a
responsibility  to  play  a  leading  role  in  solving  the
planet’s largest environmental crisis.

This report shows that ExxonMobil has been a high-
ly destructive influence on both national and interna-
tional  efforts  to  limit  catastrophic  global  warming.
The influence, the total number of years lost and time
wasted, cannot be quantified, and added to the now
permanent climate legacy of the Bush White House,
only our children will truly be able to tally the ultimate
damage.

plan  for  a  two-year  campaign  intended  to  reshape
the climate debate – where the ultimate victory was
the  defeat  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  and  making  those
promoting  it  appear  ‘out  of  touch  with  reality’.iii The
latest  attack  on  climate  science  was  revealed  this
year in a secret ExxonMobil memo to President Bush.
The  memo  asked  for  the  removal  of  Dr.  Robert
Watson, the Chair of IPCC. The Bush administration
climate team and its allies executed ExxonMobil’s will
in mid-April of 2002.

In addition to this latest tale of the working relation-
ship  between  ExxonMobil  and  Bush,  this  report
delves into some of what is known of the company’s
close  history  with  George  W.  Bush  dating  back  to
Bush’s  days  as  Governor  of  Texas.  In  1997,  then
Governor Bush consulted Exxon and Marathon oil to
draft  a  proposal  to  deal  with  Texas’s  debilitating  air
pollution  problem  from  so  called  “grandfathered”
facilities,  those  that  do  not  pass  modern  pollution
regulations,  but  are  allowed  to  continue  to  operate.
Rather like asking the fox to design the chicken coop,
the resulting proposed regulations were not surpris-
ingly  voluntary  and  full  of  loopholes.  Eventually  the
secret  consultations  between  Exxon  and  Governor
Bush were revealed and the plan was thrown out.

This  report  also  tracks  ExxonMobil’s  broad  array  of
political dirty tricks aimed at slowing the progress of
global warming policy agreements.  From the funding
and dissemination of “chicken little” economic scare
reports  on  global  warming  policy  to  anti-global
warming treaty advertising on television and in news-
papers,  ExxonMobil  has  carried  this  war  on  the  cli-
mate treaty from international negotiations to Capitol
Hill—around the world and back again.

ExxonMobil’s use of divisive tactical rhetoric is best
exemplified by its two faced argument on the role of
developing  countries  in  the  climate  treaty.  While
arguing in the U.S. policy arena that America should
reject  a  treaty  that  does  not  conscript  developing
countries  to  act,  Exxon  simultaneously  has  lobbied
developing countries not to support the treaty saying
that  they  will  be  economically  harmed  by  it.  In  the
lead  up  to  1997  Kyoto  climate  negotiations,  Exxon
and Mobil, through the Global Climate Coalition and
other front groups, were heavily pushing the message
in  the  United  States  that  developing  countries  were

Introduction

The United States, with less than five percent of the
world’s population, emits 25 percent of global warm-
ing  pollution.  By  rights,  the  nation  should  be  taking
responsibility  and  leading  international  efforts  to
reduce the threats of global warming induced climate
change to the world community. Instead, the United
States  has  abdicated  its  leadership  role  and  is  now
attempting  to  erode  the  commitment  of  other  coun-
tries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The  principal  factor  behind  the  U.S.  position  is  that
corporations have played a dominant and damaging
role  in  shaping  the  global  climate  debate.  As  oil
industry  executives  admitted  in  1998:  “Companies
that  produce  and  use  fossil  fuels,  oil,  coal  and  gas,
have a vested interest in the outcome of the climate
change  debate.”1 While  seemingly  obvious,  this
statement carries strong hints of the industry’s intent
to  stifle  the  emerging  international  treaty  to  tackle
global warming and the science that backstops those
efforts. While the fossil fuel industry as a whole has
attempted to influence the debate on global warming,
one  company  in  particular  has  gone  far  beyond  the
rest to undermine both the science of climate change
and the development of responsible U.S. climate pol-
icy. That company is ExxonMobil.

ExxonMobil has spent hundreds of millions of dollars
over  more  than  a  decade  practicing  and  promoting
denial and deceit to undermine meaningful efforts to
solve  global  warming.  ExxonMobil’s  efforts  were
finally  rewarded  when  President  Bush  announced
that the United States would be withdrawing from the
Kyoto Protocol in March 2001. The fossil fuel indus-
try  had  overtaken  U.S.  global  warming  policy.  The
same is true for the Bush-Cheney energy policy for-
mulated in early 2001, and Bush’s alternative strate-
gy to address climate change, which he announced
in February 2002.

ExxonMobil’s  attack  on  global  warming  regulation
has followed a multi-pronged strategy:

• undermine the accepted scientific consensus on cli-

mate change;

• shape U.S. government policy;

• mislead  the  public  and  policy  makers  over  the  eco-

nomic implications of tackling global warming;

• divide developed and developing countries in climate

negotiations.

Beyond  this  strategy,  the  company  has  refused  to
endorse the most viable solution to climate change:
investing in renewable energy technology.

ExxonMobil is the corporation formed by the merger
of  Exxon  and  Mobil  in  1999.  ExxonMobil  is  known
around  the  world  alternately  as  Exxon,  Mobil,  Esso
report  documents
and
ExxonMobil’s  legacy  of  deception  and  denial  on
global warming.

Undermining Climate Science

“Science is not now able to confirm that fossil
fuel use has led to any significant global warm-
ing.”2 –  ExxonMobil’s  position  on  climate
change, May 2000.

“[There is]… new and stronger evidence that
most  of  the  warming  observed  over  the  last
50  years  is  attributable to human activities.” –
Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change
(IPCC), Third Assessment Report 2001

Exxon and Mobil have denied the link between fossil
fuels  and  climate  change  for  more  than  a  decade,
and  continue  to  do  so  despite  the  fact  that  the  sci-
ence of climate change and its attribution to the use
of  fossil  fuels  has  become  increasingly  clear.  As
recently as 11 March 2002, the CEO of ExxonMobil,
Lee  Raymond,  said  that  the  corporation  intends  to
“stay the course” in its skepticism regarding climate
change  “until  someone  comes  along  with  new
information.”3 ExxonMobil’s efforts to derail the sci-
ence  are  motivated  by  the  understanding  that  the
weight  of  scientific  evidence  influences  the  urgency
of  government  action,  and  thus  the  speed  at  which
the world moves towards a fossil free future.

Over the past ten years, ExxonMobil has been at the
center of industry efforts to sabotage climate change
solutions,  including  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  One  of  the
most  egregious  was  ExxonMobil’s  promotion  of  a
widely  publicized  and  then  discredited  petition  (the
“Oregon  Petition”  of  1998)  by  “scientists”  which
aimed  to  dismiss  the  scientific  consensus  on  global
warming. The petition’s organizers attempted to mis-
lead  the  few  valid  signatories  into  believing  that  the
petition  had  the  backing  of  the  respected  National
Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS),  which  it  did  not.  They
did  this  by  releasing  the  petition  using  a  sham,
unpublished article, formatted in the same design as
that used by the NAS. Subsequently, the NAS issued
an extraordinary statement dismissing this fraudulent
effort, which included “signatures” from cartoon and
television  sitcom  characters.  The  petition  has  been

discredited in the national press.4

ExxonMobil has also funded and heavily promoted a
number  of  scientists  who  are  known  as  “climate
skeptics,”  in  an  effort  to  undermine  global  scientific
consensus  on  climate  change.  These  are  scientists
who state that either climate change is not occurring,
is not due to human causes, will not have a negative
impact  upon  our  economy  and  society,  or  alterna-
tively that taking measures to solve it will destroy the
U.S. economy. It is important to note that while some
of  these  people  are  highly  respected  in  their  fields,
none are climatologists, and their publications on cli-
mate  issues  have  not  been  peer-reviewed.  Most  of
them  have  little,  if  any,  credibility  in  the  mainstream
scientific  community,  and  several  have  been  unable
to  publish  their  work  in  the  peer-reviewed  scientific
literature  and  have,  instead,  published  their  work  in
political outlets.

It is also critical to understand that while these scien-
tists are often given equal time in the U.S. media, in
an  attempt  to  take  a  balanced  approach  to  the  cli-
mate  issue,  they  represent  a  very  small  minority  of
scientific voices speaking on this issue in the United
States and around the world. The global consensus
on  climate  change  is  clear:  the  Earth’s  climate  is
indeed changing, and human activities (primarily the
burning  of  fossil  fuels)  are  largely  responsible  for
global  warming.  Dr.  Bert  Bolin,  former  head  of  the
Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC),
said as long ago as 1996 that the larger trends taking
place  with  regard  to  the  science  of  climate  change
are not “in debate among scientists working on this
issue.”5

A Decade of Denying the Science
Exxon’s campaign of misinformation concerning the
consensus  on  global  warming  and  its  manipulation
and distortion of climate science can be traced back
to  May  1990,  when  it  attempted  to  water  down  the
conclusions  of  the  first  assessment  report  of  the

2

IPCC. Since this first IPCC report, Exxon and Mobil
have  consistently  followed  a  strategy  of  exploiting
selective and outdated scientific studies to question
the existence of global warming and the causal role
of fossil fuels in its efforts to undermine the emerging
consensus from the IPCC on both the reality and the
cause of climate change.

The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change
(IPCC)  was  established  by  the  United  Nations  in  1988  to
produce  assessment  reports  on  the  science  of  global
warming,  the  probable  impacts  and  potential  policy
responses. It is made up of about 2,500 of the world’s top
scientists, most of them American. Its first report, released
in  May  1990,  concluded  that  human-induced  climate
change is real and that levels of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere are increasing. While the first signs of climate
change  might  not  emerge  for  at  least  a  decade  (from
1990),  according  to  the  report,  the  Earth  faces  probable
temperature  increases  that  are  unprecedented  in  human
history.

1990:
During the final drafting of the IPCC’s First Scientific
Assessment Report in 1990, Brian Flannery, Exxon’s
Chief Scientific Advisor and key lobbyist, took issue
with the recommendation for 60 to 80 percent cuts in
CO2  emissions,  in  light  of  what  he  suggested  were
“uncertainties” about the behavior of carbon in the cli-
mate  system.  Although  the  consensus  of  opinion
remained  against  him,  Flannery  continued  to  demand
that the IPCC report’s Executive Summary state that
the  range  of  model  results  were  “quite  scientifically
uncertain”.6 He was unsuccessful; the summary con-
cluded  that  greenhouse  gas  emissions  at  present
rates would certainly lead to warming.

1992:
Exxon  was  a  prominent  member  of  the  Global
Climate Coalition (GCC), which until early 2002 was
the most outspoken and confrontational lobby group
battling  global  commitments  to  emissions  reduc-
tions. (See information about front groups in part III)
In  1992  the  GCC  began  using  well-known  climate
skeptics  like  Patrick  Michaels,  Robert  Balling  and
Fred Singer (all partly funded by Exxon) as “experts”
at press conferences in its attempts to undermine the
credibility of accepted climate science and the find-
ings of the IPCC.7

In February at a press conference in New York City,
the  GCC  used  professional  skeptic  Fred  Singer  to
attack  the  IPCC  science  during  the  fifth  session  of
negotiations (INC 5). The GCC also issued a briefing
entitled  “Stabilizing  carbon  dioxide emissions would
have little environmental benefit,” in which it cited cli-
mate  skeptic  Professor  Richard  Lindzen  of  the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.8

That  same  year,  Flannery  was  quoted  by  the  World
Coal  Institute  in  a  briefing  for  climate  negotiators:
“because model-based projections are controversial,
uncertain,  and  without  confirmation,  scientists  are
divided in their opinion about the likelihood and con-
sequences of climate change.”9 Flannery ignored the
fact  that  more  than  2,000  scientists  in  the  IPCC
believed that the Earth would warm at rates that were
unprecedented over the period of human history.

1994:
The GCC hired a public relations firm in 1994 to take
climate skeptic Dr. Sallie Baliunas on a media tour.10
Through the conservative think tank, The George C.
Marshall  Institute,  Baliunas  has  published  several
reports which attempt to show that human activities
such  as  the  burning  of  fossil  fuels  play  no  role  in
global  warming,  that  science  does  not  support  the
prospect of dangerous climate change11, and that sci-
entific  findings  do  not  support  federal  regulation  of
emissions.12  Baliunas is an expert in astrophysics, not
climate, and her reports were not subject to the peer
review process. Her articles have included arguments
that efforts to solve the  problem of  ozone  depletion
are  misdirected;  she  also  works  for  the  Greening
Earth  Society,  a  front  group  for  the  Western  Fuels
Association  (the  coal  industry)  which  promotes  the
idea  and  that  the  increased  CO2  released  by  the
burning of fossil fuels is greening the earth (leading to
more plant growth).13

1995:
In  1995,  the  GCC  sponsored  and  disseminated  a
report by a private weather forecasting firm – Accu-
Weather – to counter the findings of a landmark study
by  the  U.S.  National  Climatic  Data  Center.  The
National Climatic Data Center study documented the
link  between  extreme  weather  events  and  climate
change  in  the  United  States  over  the  previous  two
decades.14 The  Accu-Weather  study  disputed  the
suggestion that there had been more extreme weath-

3

er events, drawing its data from only three U.S. cities.
Although the study was unsupportable scientifically,
it  gained  considerable  media  and  public  attention
when it was heavily promoted by the GCC.

The IPCC Second Assessment Report was released in
December of 1995. It concluded that “the balance of evi-
dence  suggests  a  discernible  human  influence  on  the
global  climate”  and  that  “significant  reductions  in  net
greenhouse  gas  emissions  are  technically  possible  and
can be economically feasible.”15

The president of the American Petroleum Institute at
the time, Charles DiBona, called the IPCC’s Second
Assessment  Report  “inflammatory,”  because  it  stat-
ed that “the balance of evidence suggests that there
is a discernible human influence on global climate.”16
It  is  notable  that  oil  producing  countries  such  as
Kuwait  and  Saudi  Arabia  tried  to  delay  the  report’s
release  because  of  this  “strong  language”,  and
argued  against  the  use  of  the  words  “appreciable,”
“notable,” “measurable,” and “detectable” in place of
“discernable.”17

Also  in  1995,  the  GCC  attempted  to  orchestrate  a
character  assassination  of  an  IPCC  scientist,  Dr.
Benjamin  Santer.  It  accused  Santer  of  “scientific
cleansing” – claiming in the press that he had secret-
ly  and  substantially  altered  the  1995  IPCC  report.
Other  scientists  came  to  Santer’s  defense  and  con-
firmed that the allegations were false.18

1997:
In  the  lead  up  to  the  negotiations  in  Kyoto,  Japan
Mobil  ran  a  series  of  advertisements  in  major  U.S.
newspapers  regarding  climate  change.  One  of  the
most extreme appeared in The Washington Post one
month  before  Kyoto:  “Science:  What  We  Know  and
Don’t Know.” It featured a large pie chart purporting
to show that human activities are responsible for only
3 to 4 percent of total CO2 emissions in the Earth’s
atmosphere. While this is true, it is highly misleading
as  it  conceals  the  fact  that  overall  CO2  levels  have
increased about 30 percent due mainly to the burn-
ing of fossil fuels and deforestation.

British  Petroleum  withdrew  from  the  Global  Climate
Coalition in 1997, distancing itself from Exxon, Mobil
and  other  corporations  that  continued  to  refute  the

science of global warming.

“All of us, of course, must reject the advice of those who
ask  us  to  believe  there  really  is  no  problem  at  all.  …  For
example, we remember the tobacco company spokesper-
son who insisted for so long that smoking did no harm. To
those that seek to obfuscate, we say: we will not allow you
to  put  narrow  special  interests  above  the  interests  of  all
humankind.”
–  Vice  President  Al  Gore,  remarks  to  the  United  Nations
Committee on Climate Change Conference of the Parties,
8 December 1997, Kyoto, Japan.

1998:
In April 1998, Exxon took part in the planning of a $6
million  industry  public  relations  offensive  –  the
American  Petroleum  Institute’s  (API)  Global  Climate
Science Communications Action Plan. The plan aimed
to re-inject uncertainty into the U.S. public’s percep-
tion  of  climate  science  in  the  run  up  to  the  climate
negotiations  in  Buenos  Aires  that  November.19 The
Exxon  representative  in  the  group  formulating  this
plan was Randy Randol, who penned the 2002 memo
calling for the ouster of Dr. Robert Watson, Chair of
the IPCC.20 (See appendix and below for ExxonMobil
memo dated 6 February 2001.)

The American Petroleum Institute plan stated that:

“Victory will be achieved when:

• Average citizens understand (recognize) uncertainties
in  climate  science,  making  them  stronger  ambassa-
dors to those who shape climate policy;

• Industry  senior  leadership  understands  uncertainties
in climate science, making them stronger ambassadors
to those who shape climate policy;

• Those  promoting  the  Kyoto  treaty  on  the  basis  of
extant science appear to be out of touch with reality.”

Part of the petroleum industry strategy was to coor-
dinate  “a  complete  scientific  critique  of  the  IPCC
research  and  its  conclusions”  and  to  enable  deci-
sion  makers  to  raise  “such  serious  questions
about the Kyoto treaty’s scientific underpinnings
that  American  policy  makers  not  only  will  refuse
to  endorse  it,  they  will  seek  to  prevent  progress
towards  implementation  at  the  Buenos  Aires

4

meeting in November, or through other ways.”

This would be achieved by recruiting and training five
“independent”  scientists  –  “new  faces…  without  a
long history of visibility in the climate debate” to par-
ticipate in media outreach. The American Petroleum
Institute aimed to “maximize the impact of scientific
views consistent with ours, with Congress, the media
and other key audiences” and admitted shamelessly
that it would target teachers and students, in order to
“begin  to  erect  a  barrier  against  further  efforts  to
impose  Kyoto-like  measures  in  the  future.”21
(See
appendix for full text of memo.)

On  25  April  1998,  The  New  York  Times reported  that  the
American  Petroleum  Institute  intended  to  “spend  millions
of dollars to convince the public that the [Kyoto Protocol]
is based on shaky science…” and to give global warming
skeptics “the logistical and moral support they have been
lacking.”

The Royal Dutch/Shell Group withdrew from the plan
on April 21st because of “irreconcilable differences”
over  tactics,  including  the  proposed  use  of  “inde-
pendent” scientists to stage a public relations cam-
paign.22

In  June  1998,  prior  to  the  climate  negotiations  ses-
sion in Bonn, Germany, the Global Climate Coalition
(GCC)  distributed  a  pamphlet  to  diplomats,  entitled
“Climate  Change:  The  Case  Against  Scientific
Certainty.”  In  this  document,  the  GCC  argued  that:
“While it is certain that the Protocol would impose
enormous  burdens  on  America’s  economy,  there
is  no  scientific  certainty  that  human  activity
affects  global  climate.” Perennial  skeptic,  TV  jour-
nalist  John  Stossel,  is  named  in  the  strategy  docu-
ment to get a major national story run “examining the
scientific  underpinnings  of  the  Kyoto  treaty.”
Potential funding sources for the strategy were iden-
tified  as  the  American  Petroleum  Institute,  U.S.
Business  Roundtable,  Edison  Electric  Institute,  and
the National Mining Association and all of its corpo-
rate members. Among the potential “fund allocators”
were  Competitive  Enterprise  Institute  (CEI),  the
Committee  for  a  Constructive  Tomorrow  (CFACT),
Frontiers  for  Freedom  and  the  George  C.  Marshall
Institute.23 It is clear that the disclosure of this plan by
The New York Times did not impede its progress.

1999:
The Ford Motor Company withdrew from the Global
Climate Coalition in late 1999, saying its membership
in  the  GCC  was  “an  impediment  to  moving  ahead
credibly  on
[Ford’s]  environmental  agenda.”24
Furthermore,  Ford  stated  that  “credible  evidence  of
global warming exists.” “We do believe that there is
something  to  climate  change.  There  is  enough  evi-
dence that something is happening that we ought to
start looking at this seriously,” said Ford spokesman
Terry Bresnihan.25

2000:
In  the  spring  of  2000,  ExxonMobil  ran  a  four-part
series of advertisements in The New York Times that
attempted  to  resurrect  the  debate  over  climate  sci-
ence. The claims ExxonMobil made in the advertise-
ment  have  since  been  subjected  to  a  full  scientific
rebuttal using the IPCC findings.26

“ExxonMobil, the biggest [oil company], is also the world’s
most  powerful  climate-change  skeptic…If  the  world’s
biggest  purveyor  of  fossil  fuels  ever  accepts  openly  that
global warming is real, that may turn out to be more impor-
tant to the planet than any Kyoto deal.”27 – The Economist,
2 December 2000.

One of the studies referred to in the advertisement28,
and  used  by  ExxonMobil  CEO  Lee  Raymond  at  the
May  2000  ExxonMobil  shareholders  meeting,  was  a
chart of temperature data for the effectively stagnant
Sargasso  Sea.  This  was  used  by  ExxonMobil  to
refute  the  claim  that  global  warming  was  occurring
worldwide.

The  author  of  the  Sargasso  Sea  study  later  said:  “I
believe ExxonMobil has been misleading in its
use of the Sargasso Sea data…. There’s really
no  way  those  results  bear  on  the  question  of
human-induced  climate  warming.  I  think  the
sad thing is that a company with the resources
of ExxonMobil is exploiting the data for political
purposes.”29

At  the  2000  shareholder  meeting,  Raymond  also
showed ExxonMobil shareholders a chart of temper-
ature data from satellites and stated that “if you just
eyeball that, you could make a case statistically that,
in  fact,  the  temperature  is  going  down.”30 However,
the  13  August  1998  issue  of  the  journal  Nature31

5

reported  that  the  researchers  analyzing  the  satellite
data had failed to account for orbital decay (satellites
drop in altitude over time, distorting the temperature
measurements). With the flawed analysis, it appeared
that  satellites  were  recording  a  cooling  trend,  but
when  corrected  for  orbital  decay,  the  data  actually
showed  a  slight  warming.  Even  climate  skeptic  Dr.
John Christy, the author of the original analysis, con-
sidered  the  new  study’s  conclusions  to  be  legiti-
mate.32

At the same meeting, Raymond questioned the glob-
al  scientific  consensus  by  citing  the  “Oregon
Petition,”  which  dismisses  global  warming  and  had
been signed by 17,000 “scientists.” Raymond stated
that  “What  I  am  saying  is  that  there  is  a  substantial
difference  of  view  in  the  scientific  community  as  to
what  exactly  is  going  on.”33 The  petition  had  been
discredited  in  the  national  press  two  years  earlier
after it was determined that it was not organized by
climate  scientists  and  that  it  had  misled  recipients
into  believing  it  came  from  America’s  respected
National Academy of Sciences, which it did not. The
17,000 signatories included fictional television char-
acters, TV weathermen, deceased persons, and rock
stars.34

Their  intentional  reliance  on  such  dubious  scientific
sources led ExxonMobil to claim in a 2000 company
report on climate change that “we do not now have
sufficient  understanding  of  climate  change  to  make
reasonable  predictions  and/or  justify  drastic  meas-
ures.…  Some  reports  in  the  media  link  climate
change  to  extreme  weather  and  harm  to  human
health. Yet experts see no such pattern.” ExxonMobil
still  refuses  to  acknowledge  the  link  between  fossil
fuels and climate change: “science is not now able
to  confirm  that  fossil  fuel  use  has  led  to  any
significant global warming.”35

In  March  2001,  scientists  at  the  Massachusetts
Institute of Technology released a study which con-
cludes  that  there  is  a  95  percent  chance  that  the
earth’s  temperature  will  rise  by  at  least  1.6  degrees
Fahrenheit  during  this  century.  The  study  was  pre-
pared by a team of about 35 scientists, economists
and  technical  experts  at  MIT.  Ronald  Prinn,  an
atmospheric scientist who co-directed the modeling
effort,  said  that  “results  suggest  that  policy  makers
should make some effort to reduce the world’s risks
from  global  warming  despite  the  economic  cost  of
doing so,” according to The Wall Street Journal.37

In  September  2001,  the  world’s  leading  climate
expert  body,  the  UN  Intergovernmental  Panel  on
Climate  Change  (IPCC),  met  in  London  to  reach
agreement  on  its  Third  Assessment  Report  on  cli-
mate change. The IPCC’s draft final report contained
the  following  line:  “The  Earth’s  climate  system  has
demonstrably  changed  on  both  global  and  regional
scales  since  the  pre-industrial  era,  with  some  of
these changes attributable to human activities.”

At  this  meeting,  ExxonMobil  suggested  an  amend-
ment deleting the text: “with some of these changes
attributable  to  human  activities.” The  IPCC  rejected
this  amendment.38 Not  only  has  the  IPCC  consider-
ably strengthened its opinion that the recent warming
is  mostly  due  to  human  activities,  it  attributes  this
increase principally to the burning of fossil fuels.39

“As  with  any  other  risk,  the  uncertainty  is  no  excuse  for
inaction….  The  ability  to  think  steadily  and  consistently
about a topic as complicated as climate change is a tough
test  of  management  acumen.”  “Some  executives  are
meeting it head-on. Those who are not should wonder why
they aren’t – and so should their shareholders.” – Harvard
Business Review, July-August 2000.

2001:
In  January  and  February  2001,  the  IPCC  published
drafts  of  its  Third  Assessment  Report.  The  report
confirmed  the  existence  of  “new  and  stronger  evi-
dence  that  most  of  the  warming  observed  over  the
last 50 years is attributable to human activities.” The
estimated  temperature  increase  expected  over  the
next 100 years was now believed to be double what
the panel predicted in its 1995 report.36

October 2001 - An About-Face on Science?
Interestingly, ExxonMobil’s public statements on the
scientific  evidence  for  global  climate  change  have
become  less  uniform  of  late.  It  is  unknown  whether
this indicates an internal split on the state of the sci-
ence or full knowledge while the campaign of public
deception continues. As with other environmental lia-
bility  cases  and  tobacco  companies,  “when  they
knew better” becomes a key piece of evidence.

6

In apparent contrast to Lee Raymond’s statement in
March 2002, that the corporation intends to “stay the
course”  in  its  skepticism  regarding  climate  change
“until someone comes along with new information,”40
other ExxonMobil executives and printed documents
have been quoted with different stances.

In a speech given at the Oil and Money Conference in
London,  on  30  October  2001,  René  Dahan,  the
Director and Executive Vice President of ExxonMobil
said that: “Scientific uncertainty is no reason to delay
taking  appropriate  action.”  Furthermore:  “We  at
ExxonMobil  agree  that  global  climate  change  is  a
serious issue and the current lack of scientific, eco-
nomic and technical certainty is not a reason for inac-
tion.”41

Mr. Dahan claimed his statements marked “an exten-
sion, a clarification” of ExxonMobil’s position, rather
than any switch in it, and were unrelated to pressure
from  green  lobby  groups  that  have  mounted  a  con-
sumer boycott in the United Kingdom and sharehold-
er campaign against the company.42

An  Esso  document  released  in  the  UK,  states  that
“there are still many gaps in the understanding of cli-
mate change, but it poses serious long term risks and
uncertainty is no reason for inaction.”43

These statements bear strong similarity to the indus-
try-deplored  “precautionary  principle,”  the  basis  for
the  UN  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,
which states that “[w]hen an activity raises threats of
harm  to  human  health  or  the  environment,  precau-
tionary  measures  should  be  taken,  even  if  some
cause-and-effect  relationships  are  not  fully  estab-
lished  scientifically.  In  this  context  the  proponent  of
an  activity,  rather  than  the  public,  should  bear  the
burden  of  proof.”44 The  logic  of  this  principle  is  that
ExxonMobil  should  bear  the  burden  of  proof,  and
should  take  precautionary  measures  to  reduce  the
threat of climate change by starting a transition away
from  fossil  fuels.  However,  ExxonMobil’s  actions
clearly  do  not  reflect  this  responsibility,  given  their
lack of investment in renewable energy, their push for
more research and delay, and their continued explo-
ration and production of oil and gas.

By  contrast,  as  early  as  May  of  1997,  executives  at
Shell  verbalized  the  precautionary  principle.  For

example, Heinz Rothermund, the Managing Director
of Shell UK Exploration and Production, asked: “How
far  is  it  sensible  to  explore  for  and  develop  new
hydrocarbon  reserves,  given  that  the  atmosphere
may not be able to cope with the greenhouse gases
that will emanate from the utilization of the hydro-car-
bon reserves discovered already? Undoubtedly there
is a dilemma.”45

On  11  March  2002,  in  a  speech  given  at  Stanford
University,  Sir  John  Browne,  Chairman  and  CEO  of
British Petroleum, explained why his company broke
ranks with other oil corporations in 1997 and decid-
ed to face up to climate change:

First, it was clear that reputable science could not
be  ignored.  The  science  wasn’t  complete  –  but
science  is  never  complete….  But  they  knew
enough to say that there were long-term risks and
that  precautionary  action  was  necessary  if  we
-  of
were
the  evidence  mounting  to  the  point  where  dra-
conian action was unavoidable.46

Attacking the Scientists
After years of trying to discredit the science and cor-
rupt  the  scientific  debate,  ExxonMobil  is  now  going
after the scientists.

In March 2002, a February 2001 ExxonMobil memo47
to the White House, regarding U.S. climate policy and
ongoing  IPCC  proceedings,  was  released  to  the
media.  The  memo,  from  ExxonMobil’s  Senior
Environmental Advisor, Dr. Arthur (Randy) G. Randol
III, asks the Bush administration to use its influence
to oust Dr. Robert Watson from his post as Chair of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Dr.
Watson  is  an  internationally  respected  atmospheric
chemist,  who  is  director  of  the  World  Bank’s
Environmental  Department.  He  has  also  been  out-
spoken about the urgency for action to solve global
warming, and has long criticized the United States for
its lack of action.

In the memo, dated 6 February 2001, Randol charged
Dr. Watson with using leaked drafts of the IPCC’s cli-
mate  reports  to  further  his  “personal  agenda”  and
asked:

7

them  what  you  think  about  various  issues….  That’s
what a free society is all about.”52 ExxonMobil has yet
to take full responsibility for this memo, written on its
letterhead and faxed from its offices.

Exxon’s History of Abusing Science
Exxon’s abuse of science to further its own interests is not
new  nor  limited  to  climate  change.  Following  the  Exxon
Valdez oil spill of 1989, Exxon stated in report after report
that  Prince  William  Sound  was  “essentially  clean  and
recovered.”53 However,  in  early  1993,  Doug  Wolfe  of  the
National  Oceanographic  and  Atmospheric  Administration
(NOAA) said that “there was a massive impact with mas-
sive  mortalities  [resulting  from  the  Valdez  spill].  It’s  very
clear  that  long  term  recovery  is  far  from  complete.”54
According  to  Carol  Ann  Manen  of  NOAA,  “Exxon  [was]
picking and choosing the information it is using to assess
recovery,” and Wolfe added that Exxon had “made use of
partial data sometimes taken out of context and selective-
ly ignored other data available to them.”55 According to Riki
Ott, a marine biologist from Alaska, “We’ve been lied to by
Exxon  from  day  one  of  the  Exxon  Valdez  oil  spill.”56 Lee
Raymond,  Chairman  and  CEO  of  ExxonMobil,  directed
Exxon’s clean up efforts for the Valdez spill.57

The Skeptics
ExxonMobil has funded some of the most visible and
notorious  “climate  skeptics,”  whose  work  it  uses  to
back  up  its  anti-Kyoto  lobbying58,  and  to  distort  the
debate  in  the  public  arena.  Whether  or  not  money
from the fossil fuel industry can be said to have cor-
rupted or influenced the findings of scientists in any
way,  ExxonMobil’s  financial  support  has  provided
these climate skeptics with a voice and a global plat-
form from which to deliver their opinions to the pub-
lic. The prominence and influence of these scientists
has been completely out of proportion both in terms
of their contribution to the science of climate change
and in the extent to which they represent wider sci-
entific  opinion  on  the  issue  of  global  warming.  In
essence,  scientists  who  have  credibility  in  one  field
have often been hired to do public relations work for
the fossil fuel industry in another field, thereby parad-
ing industry wish lists as scientific fact.

“Issue:  Can  Watson  be  replaced  now  at  the
request of the U.S.?”

The memo also included a list of “recommendations,”
including the removal of specific people from govern-
ment offices and the appointment of a number of “cli-
mate  skeptic”  scientists  to  positions  within  the
administration to influence final reports of the IPCC.

One  example  provided  by  Randol  as  evidence  was
this  Watson  quote:  “The  United  States  is  way  off
meeting  its  targets.  A  country  like  China  has  done
more,  in  my  opinion,  than  a  country  like  the  United
States  to  move  forward  in  economic  development
while remaining environmentally sensitive.” Watson’s
statement was true on both counts. U.S. greenhouse
gas emissions are now more than 17 percent above
1990  levels48,  despite  a  commitment  under  the  UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change (now U.S.
law) by our government to stabilize at 1990 emissions
levels by 2000. China has reduced its emissions over
the  past  several  years,  even  while  its  economy  has
expanded faster than that of the United States.49

Watson responded to ExxonMobil’s charges by not-
ing  that:  “Every  one  of  my  talks  have  been  solidly
based  on  IPCC  material….  Obviously,  one  can  be
selective,  but  I  try  to  be  very  balanced….  So  those
who say I’m an advocate don’t want to hear the mes-
sage that indeed the earth is warming; that most of
the  warming  of  the  last  five  years  is  attributable  to
human  activities;  that  carbon  dioxide  is  the  key
human-induced  greenhouse  gas  and  that  most  of  it
comes from fossil fuels…. But I’ve never advocated
for a particular policy position.” He also denied that
he  had  ever  leaked  information  prior  to  the  peer
review  process,  during  which  time  IPCC  material  is
sent  to  scientists  around  the  world,  in  addition  to
experts and governments for review.50

ExxonMobil  initially  claimed  that  the  letter  was  not
written  by  anyone  within  the  corporation.  Tom
Cirigliano,  a  spokesman  for  ExxonMobil,  told  The
Wall  Street  Journal that  “Mr.  Randol  didn’t  write  the
memo but was simply passing it on from third parties.
He said that the oil company has no official position
on Mr. Watson’s candidacy, and said that he couldn’t
identify the memo’s authors.”51 But he also noted that
“In the U.S., as a citizen, or as a group… you have a
perfect  right  to  contact  your  government  and  tell

ExxonMobil - Funding the Skeptics
One  of  the  most  high  profile  skeptics  in  the  climate
change debate, S. Fred Singer, has recently denied
receiving  any  oil  company  money,  and  claimed  that
his  consulting  for  oil  companies  was  solely  “on  the
subject  of  oil  pricing,  some  20  years  ago….”59 Yet
Exxon’s  own  documents60 show  that  in  1998,  the
company gave a grant of $10,000 to the Science and
Environmental Policy Project (SEPP), of which Singer
is the founding president, and another $65,000 to the
Atlas  Economic  Research  Foundation,  which  pro-
motes  and  supports  Singer’s  work.61 In  addition,  in
the past Singer has acknowledged receiving funding
from Exxon.62

According  to  the  Wall  Street  Journal63,  ExxonMobil
also  funds  the  ultra-conservative  and  anti-environ-
mentalist  Frontiers  of  Freedom  Institute,  of  which
Singer  is  a  staff  member.  Frontiers  of  Freedom  was
cited in the American Petroleum Institute (API) 1998
Global  Science  Communications  Action  Plan  as  a
possible organization to help operationalize their anti-
Kyoto strategy, to be funded by API and others in the
fossil fuel industry.64

Singer has a history of public attacks on the integrity
of the IPCC process.65 He has fabricated quotes from
the  former  chair  of  the  IPCC,  Dr.  Bert  Bolin,  in  an
attempt  to  suggest  that  Dr.  Bolin  had  changed  his
mind  about  climate  change.66 Singer  was  also  the
mastermind  behind  a  Committee  for  a  Constructive
Tomorrow (CFACT) project that took fifty Republican
students from the United States, trained in the skep-
tics’ arguments, to the climate negotiations in Bonn
in 2001, to demonstrate in favor of Bush’s abandon-
ment of the Kyoto Protocol.67 CFACT was also listed
in the 1998 API plan mentioned above.

Throughout  the  years,  Singer,  a  seemingly  profes-
sional  generic  skeptic,  has  argued  against  an  inter-
national treaty to ban whaling, and against action on
acid rain, ozone depletion and clean air. He has stat-
ed that most people would survive a nuclear war and
that  resultant  climatic  changes  would  be  minor  and
short-lived. He has also argued that the lung cancer
risk  from  second-hand  smoke  was  statistically
insignificant.68 (See  appendix  for  details.)  However,
aside from one technical comment, Singer has been
unable to publish his work in any peer-reviewed sci-
entific journals for at least 15 years.69

Sallie Baliunas has published several reports which
attempt  to  show  that  human  activities  such  as  the
burning of fossil fuels play no role in global warming,
that  science  does  not  support  the  prospect  of  dan-
gerous  climate  change70,  and  that  scientific  findings
do not support federal regulation of emissions.71 The
Global  Climate  Coalition  (of  which  Exxon  and  Mobil
were prominent members) hired her to go on a media
tour  in  1994  to  refute  the  science  of  global  climate
change.72 She  was  also  a  “co-author”  of  the  paper
which  imitated  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences
format,  and  was  the  basis  for  the  1998  “Oregon
Petition” with signatures from “17,000 scientists” dis-
missing the scientific consensus on climate change.73

Other  prominent  skeptics  funded  by  Exxon  include
Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling, and Sherwood
Idso.74 All  are  veterans  of  the  1991  coal-industry
funded  skeptic  campaign  coordinated  by  the
Information  Council  on  the  Environment  (ICE).
According to strategy papers developed for the cam-
paign, the ICE campaign sought to “re-position glob-
al warming as theory (not fact)” and attempted to tar-
get  “older,  less  educated  males  from  larger  house-
holds who are not typically information seekers” and
“younger, lower income women.”75

In 1998, Exxon gave a grant of $15,000 to The Cato
Institute’s  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  pro-
gram, of which Patrick Michaels is a senior fellow.
Michaels argues in four directions: global warming is
not happening, science that detects global warming
is  flawed,  industry-funded  science  is  viable  and
objective,  and  global  warming  will  be  good  for  the
planet and humankind. Contradicting his claims that
global  warming  is  not  occurring,  in  1998  Michaels
wrote  that:  “The  earth’s  climate  is  not  necessarily
changing in a deleterious fashion…. These  changes
may  bear,  at  least  in  part,  a  fingerprint  of  human
activity.”76

Exxon  also  funds  the  Pacific  Research  Institute  for
Public  Policy,  which  published  Robert  Balling’s
1992 book on climate change, The Heated Debate.77
Balling has argued that climate change, when or if it
occurs,  will  be  beneficial,  particularly  for  the  United
States.  “Do  something  to  stimulate  plant  growth  in
areas prone to degradation of graze lands: burn fos-
sil fuels and help to increase atmospheric CO2 levels.

The  pastures  of  the  world,  along  with  the  animals
(and people) depending on those ecosystems, will be
in your debt!”78

Sherwood  Idso is  the  scientific  advisor  for  the
Center  for  the  Study  of  Carbon  Dioxide  and  Global
Change  in  Arizona,  which  received  a  $10,000  grant
from  Exxon  in  1998.  Idso’s  past  contribution  to  the
climate  debate  was  a  1991  coal  industry  funded

Influence on Bush Policies

Exxon has attempted to shape U.S. policy on
global  warming  over  the  past  decade  from
many angles. With the election of George W.
Bush, they now have a more sympathetic ear
in the White House.

ly voluntary scheme – became law in 1999, following
a sham public consultation.84 According to The New
York Times, “No environmental groups or other pub-
lic interest groups were invited, and they only learned
about the meetings early this year [in 1999].”85

Texas  –  The  Beginnings  of  the  Exxon-Bush
Relationship
The relationship between George W. Bush and Exxon
began  when  Bush  was  Governor  of  Texas,  during
which  time  Exxon  played  a  key  role  in  weakening
state environmental regulatory policy on air quality.

Bush was coming under increasing pressure from the
U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency80,  the  Texas
public in general, and from environmentalists to close
a  loophole  in  the  1971  Texas  Clean  Air  Act,  which
effectively  exempted  830  older  ‘grandfathered’
power plants (responsible for more than 30 percent of
the state’s industrial air pollution) from pollution con-
trol. Texas state regulators were considering impos-
ing  mandatory  restrictions  on  polluters,  but  Bush
helped  block  regulations  that  would  require  emis-
sions reductions.81

Seeing  an  opportunity  to  paint  himself  green  in  the
run up to his presidential campaign, but keen to not
alienate  his  old  colleagues  in  the  energy  industry,
Bush  asked  two  oil  company  presidents  –  V.G.
Beghini  of  Marathon  Oil  Company  and  Ansel
Condray of Exxon – to draft a program tailored to the
needs  of  the  industries  involved.  (ExxonMobil’s
Beaumont complex is the largest grandfathered refin-
ery in Texas.82)

Beghini, Condray and Bush’s environmental director,
John Howard, met in secret for the first six months of
1997  to  develop  a  working  proposal  for  legislation
that would not disadvantage them. Robin Schneider,
executive  director  of  the  non-profit  Public  Research
Works,  noted  that  the  companies  attending  these
meetings  were  among  Bush’s  most  generous  and
reliable contributors.83 Their final product – an entire-

In  a  memo  to  company  owners  of  grandfathered
facilities in Texas, dated 11 June 1997,  Beghini and
Condray wrote that: “In early March, while discussing
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards Issue with
Governor Bush, he asked us to work with his office to
develop the concepts of a voluntary program to per-
mit  grandfathered  facilities  in  Texas…  House  Bill
3019 and the associated debate from the recent leg-
islative session indicate that our lawmakers are ready
to end grandfathering. This voluntary program will be
an  excellent  opportunity  to  influence  the  manner  in
which  grandfathered  facilities  are  permitted.  Your
involvement  and  that  of  your  company  are  impor-
tant.”86

Bush  has  “given  these  polluters  a  corporate
loophole  they  can  drive  a  Cadillac  through,”
commented  Land  Commissioner  Garry  Mauro,
Bush’s  democratic  opponent  in  the  1998  Texas
gubernatorial race.87

Bush  heralded  his  success  in  having  achieved  a
major environmental policy without needing to resort
to a “command and control” approach. It was exact-
ly the kind of voluntary policy that he would later pro-
pose  in  February  2002  in  place  of  the  Kyoto
Protocol’s binding emissions reduction targets.

Sharing the platform at a press conference in January
1998 with Ansel Condray, Bush claimed that he had
already signed up 26 industry volunteers for his Clean
Air Program.88 By the end of that year however, only
three  companies  had  actually  reduced  emissions,
and  by  less  than  17  percent  of  the  promised
amount.89

In  2001,  the  Texas  state  legislature  threw  out

11

the Bush/Exxon voluntary plan as a failure, and
instituted  mandatory  emissions  reductions
requirements.

Today Texas is one of the most polluted states in the
country; Houston has surpassed Los Angeles as the
nation’s smog leader. Reductions in toxic emissions
under  Governor  Bush  have  been  attributed  to  poli-
cies put in place under Bush’s predecessor, Governor
Ann  Richards,  a  point  which  Bush’s  aides  have  not
disputed, according to The New York Times.90

Bush and Fuzzy Science
One  of  the  three  men  appointed  by  then-Governor
Bush  to  the  Texas  Natural  Resource  Conservation
Commission (TNRCC) was Ralph Marquez, a 30-year
executive with Monsanto Company and a lobbyist of
the  Texas  Chemical  Council.  The  other  two  Bush
appointees  were  a  cattleman/executive  of  the  Farm
Bureau  and  a  former  employee  of  the  state  agricul-
tural  department  who  tried  to  loosen  rules  requiring
farmers to notify farm workers when applying pesti-
cides. According to The Washington Post, the TNRCC
“has endorsed industry opposition to EPA initiatives
and  belittled  federal  officials’  science.”  In  fact,  The
Washington Post article notes that “Marquez testified
in Congress that ozone – the key ingredient in smog
– is a ‘relatively benign pollutant.’’91

“I don’t think we know the solution to global warming
yet,  and  I  don’t  think  we’ve  got  all  the  facts.”  –
George W. Bush, second presidential debate, 2000.92

Bush + ExxonMobil = Bad Policy
1997: Bush asks Exxon and Marathon to draft voluntary

air pollution policy.

1997-1998: Air pollution policy drafted in secret meetings

with polluters and Bush.

1999: Bush pushes policy through Texas state legislature.
2000: Texas Natural Resources Conservation

Commission (TNRCC) announces that voluntary
plan reduced emissions by 3 percent at most
(compared to estimated 25 to 50 percent reduction
expected under regulatory requirements).
Bush promises to regulate carbon dioxide during
presidential campaign.

2001: Texas state legislature throws out Bush/Exxon

voluntary plan as failure and institutes mandatory
emissions reductions requirements.
Bush becomes President of the United States.
IPCC releases Third Assessment Report, stating
that “there is new and stronger evidence that most
of the warming observed over the last 50 years is
attributable to human activities.”93
Not liking the IPCC’s conclusions, Bush asks the
U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) for a
second opinion; the NAS concludes that the IPCC
is right.  ExxonMobil sends memo to Bush urging
the administration to oust Dr. Robert Watson, chair
of the IPCC. Bush throws out Kyoto Protocol,
reneges on pledge to regulate CO2 emissions.
Bush-Cheney energy plan is released; is strongly
influenced by fossil fuel and nuclear power industry
interests. Secretary of State Colin Powell promises
that a new proposal for dealing with global
warming will be ready for an international meeting
in November; soon thereafter, National Security
Adviser Condoleeza Rice and EPA Administrator
Christine Todd Whitman announce that the Bush
administration has no such plan.94

2002: Bush announces plan for voluntary approach to

climate change, which looks very much like the pro
gram that ExxonMobil advocates. ExxonMobil
memo  becomes  public.  Bush  administration
pushes for overthrow of Robert Watson as IPCC
chair, and succeeds.

National Influence
ExxonMobil  has  claimed  that  its  contributions  to
President  Bush’s  election  campaign  were  minimal
and  that  the  corporation  has  no  influence  over
President Bush. According to René Dahan, Executive
Vice President of ExxonMobil, the corporation’s polit-
ical  action  committee  (PAC)  donated  $745,670  to
individual presidential and congressional candidates
in  the  2000  election  cycle,  and  only  $5,285  of  this
went to the Bush campaign. “It is ridiculous to sug-
gest  that  our  contributions  could  buy  influence  on
U.S. government policy.”95

However, the facts show otherwise.

ExxonMobil’s  Multi-Million  Dollar  Contributions  and
Lobbying Campaign
Exxon  gave  more  money  to  the  Republicans  during
the 2000 election cycle than any other oil company –
more  than  $1  million.  Of  its  total  political  donations
for that year, 89 percent went to Republicans.96

ExxonMobil’s  lobbying  budget  in  1999,  the  most
recent  year  for  which  figures  are  available,  totaled
$11.7 million.97 ExxonMobil ranked fifth in the United
States  for  lobbying  expenses  that  year,  exceeded
only by the U.S. pharmaceutical and tobacco giants.
This came on top of years of funding for a multimil-
lion-dollar anti-Kyoto advertising campaign.

The Bush Administration and Oil/Exxon Ties
President  Bush’s  selections  for  his  Cabinet  were
made  public  in  January  of  2001.  More  than  half  of
them  (including  Vice  President  Cheney)  came  from
the oil and gas industry. For example, Bush’s Under
Secretary  for  Economic  Affairs  in  the  Commerce
Department, Kathleen Cooper, was the former Chief
Economist  for  Exxon;  Condoleeza  Rice,  Bush’s
National Security Advisor, was on Board of Directors
of  Chevron  and  had  an  oil  tanker  named  after  her;
and  Commerce  Secretary  Don  Evans  is  the  former
director of an oil and natural gas company based in
Denver  and  helped  Bush  raise  a  record  amount  of
money during the 2000 presidential campaign.98

Lobbying Bush to Kill the Kyoto Protocol
Two days before the Bush inauguration, ExxonMobil
published an op-ed in the U.S. press outlining its rec-
ommendations  for  “An  Energy  Policy  for  the  New

Administration.” The op-ed stated that “the unrealis-
tic and economically damaging Kyoto process needs
to be rethought.”99

Meanwhile,  ExxonMobil  and  its  oil  industry  col-
leagues  were  lobbying  Capitol  Hill  and  the  White
House  as  well.  Following  Bush’s  March  2001  state-
ment  regarding  his  formal  opposition  to  the  Kyoto
Protocol,  the  Chief  Executive  of  the  American
Petroleum Institute wrote a letter of support and con-
gratulations to the Chair of the Energy and Air Quality
Subcommittee,  Congressman  Joe  Barton,  thanking
him for the “strong leadership” he had demonstrated
on  the  issue.  The  letter  indicated  that  Barton  had
asked the API for its view on the status of the inter-
implement  the  Kyoto
national  negotiations  to
Protocol  on  26  March  2001,  days  before  Bush’s
rejection  of  the  treaty.  The  letter  re-stated  the  usual
skeptic’s  arguments  against  Kyoto  (the  economic
implications and lack of developing countries partici-
pation),  much  of  the  language  echoing  that  of  both
Bush (“the Kyoto Protocol represents a fundamental-
ly  flawed approach…”)  and  of  Exxon’s  statements
(“the  long  term  challenge  of  potential  climate
change”)  (emphases  added).  Like  ExxonMobil,  the
API still calls for more research to reduce “the scien-
tific gaps and uncertainties surrounding the potential
of human impacts on the climate.”100

The U.S. Council on International Business (USCIB),
of which ExxonMobil is a member, wrote to Bush on
11  April  2001,  after  his  withdrawal  from  the  Kyoto
Protocol,  suggesting  that  “the  U.S.  should  move
quickly  to  chart  a  path  forward  that  will  avoid  the
Kyoto  protocol’s  unrealistic  targets,  timetables  and
lack of developing country participation.”101

On  17  April  2001,  ExxonMobil  placed  an  advertise-
ment  in  several  U.S.  newspapers  claiming  that  the
Kyoto  Protocol  is  “fatally  flawed”  and  “fatally  politi-
cized,” and that the stalemate in The Hague (climate
talks of November 2000) and a new administration in
the White House “provide an opportunity to develop
a  sounder  approach.”  This  approach,  which
ExxonMobil claims would entail “more effective steps
to  manage  the  long-term  risk  of  climate  change,”
include technology research and development (R&D),
more scientific study to address “fundamental gaps,”
“economically based voluntary actions and an inter-
national  approach  that  meets  that  aspirations  of  all

13

the world’s people.”102

After less than a year of lobbying the Bush adminis-
tration,  the  GCC  declared  success  and  closed  its
doors
in  January  2002.  “The  Global  Climate
Coalition,  which  represented  U.S.  industry  groups
opposed  to  implementing  mandatory  greenhouse
gas  emissions  reductions,  has  been  dissolved,”  a
coalition  official  told  BNA  on  24  January.  Frank
Maisano,  spokesman  for  the  group,  said,  ‘We  have
achieved  what  we  wanted  to  accomplish  with  the
Kyoto  Protocol.’  The  coalition  had  been  the  most
active U.S. industry voice opposing U.S. involvement
in the global treaty to curb greenhouse gases.”103

From the GCC website, 25 January 2002:

“The Global Climate Coalition has been deactivated.
The industry voice on climate change has served its
purpose by contributing to a new national approach
to global warming.

“The Bush administration will soon announce a
climate  policy  that  is  expected  to  rely  on  the
development  of  new  technologies  to  reduce
greenhouse emissions, a concept strongly sup-
ported by the GCC.”

“The coalition also opposed Senate ratification of the
Kyoto Protocol that would assign such stringent tar-
gets for lowering greenhouse gas emissions that eco-
nomic  growth  in  the  U.  S.  would  be  severely  ham-
pered  and  energy  prices  for  consumers  would  sky-
rocket. The GCC also opposed the treaty because it
does not require the largest developing countries to
make cuts in their emissions.”

“At this point, both Congress and the Administration
agree that the U.S. should not accept the mandatory
cuts in emissions required by the protocol.”104

Exactly three weeks later, President Bush announced
his climate policy.

In  March  2002,  a  memo  from  Randy  Randol  at
ExxonMobil  to  John  Howard  in  the  Center  for
Environmental  Quality  at  the  White  House  (dated
February 2001) was released to the press. This is the
same John Howard who was an environmental aide
in the state of Texas under then-Governor Bush, who

14

devised the voluntary clean air plan with Exxon in the
late  1990s.)  The  memo  was  regarding  U.S.  climate
change policy and ongoing proceedings of the IPCC,
and  asked  the  Bush  administration  to  use  its  influ-
ence  to  oust  Dr.  Robert  Watson  from  his  post  as
Chair of the IPCC. ExxonMobil also requested that a
number of specific officials be removed from federal
offices, including the State Department and the White
House,  and  recommended  the  appointment  of  a
number  of  climate  skeptics  to  positions  within  the
administration. One of these, Harlan Watson, former-
ly of the House Science Committee, was to be made
available  to  work  with  the  Bush  administration’s  cli-
mate team.105

The officials at the Department of State and the White
House  are  all  gone.  Harlan  Watson  is  now  the  U.S.
Senior Climate Negotiator.

In April 2002, ExxonMobil’s third request was grant-
ed. The Bush administration supported Dr. Rajendra
K. Pachauri to replace American scientist Dr. Robert
Watson as chair of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel
on  Climate  Change.  As  chair  of  the  IPCC,  Pachauri
will  lead  the  expert  body  in  preparing  the  Fourth
Assessment  report  on  climate  change.106 According
to an article in the journal Nature, “… an orchestrated
campaign  by  the  U.S.  administration  and  the  fossil-
fuel  lobby  forced  the  vote  on  19  April  in  which
Pachauri  defeated  the  incumbent,  atmospheric  sci-
entist  Robert  Watson,  by  76  votes  to  49.  Climate
researchers  appreciated  the  way  in  which  Watson
defended  their  findings  from  politically  motivated
attacks during his tenure. Many will now be wary of
Pachauri, who appears to have tarnished his reputa-
tion by collaborating with those whose objective was
to ditch Watson.”107

“Pachauri,  an  economist  as  well  as  an  engineer,
might not be quite what Bush expects as he has been
a vociferous critic of the president for not doing more
to  cut  emissions  from  the  U.S.,  seen  as  the  world’s
largest source of heat-trapping gases. While industry
lobbyists feel he is preferable to Watson because of
his  work  with  industry  in  the  past,  many  climate
experts  say  Pachauri’s  lack  of  grounding  in  atmos-
pheric  science  make  him  an  unsuitable  choice,”
according to the New India Times.108

Pachauri  is  Director  of  the  Tata  Energy  Research
Institute  (TERI)  in  New  Delhi,  and  on  the  board  of
directors  of  the  Indian  Oil  Corporation.109 The  U.S.
support  for  Pachauri  is  suspicious  considering  his
criticism of Bush’s climate policy and the fact that he
has voiced strong opposition to Kyoto Protocol pro-
visions  which  the  U.S.  government  and  fossil  fuel
industry  have  long  supported  and  environmental
groups  have  opposed,  including  emissions  trading
and  the  use  of  forest  credits  (“sinks”).  Pachauri  has
also  supported  anti-corporate  efforts  such  as  the
StopEsso campaign in the United Kingdom.

It  is  suspected  that  the  fossil  fuel  interests  who
worked  to  get  Dr.  Pachauri  in  place  are  aiming  to
undermine the progress of the IPCC, which dictates
the urgency of action and thus the future of the Kyoto
Protocol by electing a divisive chair.

Influencing U.S. Energy Policy
Documents  obtained  by  the  National  Resources
Defense  Council110 thus  far,  through  the  Freedom  of
Information  Act,  regarding  the  Bush-Cheney  Energy
Task Force indicate that there were many conversa-
tions  with  industry,  including  ExxonMobil,  regarding
the  formulation  of  U.S.  energy  policy  in  early  2001.
Because  numerous  documents  have  been  withheld
to  date,  the  extent  to  which  ExxonMobil  influenced
the  Bush-Cheney  energy  plan  has  yet  to  be  deter-
mined.

The  American  Petroleum  Institute  was  the  lead
organization in the energy task force brought togeth-
er  by  Vice  President  Dick  Cheney  to  formulate  an
energy  plan.  Lee  Raymond,  CEO  and  Chairman  of
ExxonMobil, was a member of the API board at the

from

time.  Under  pressure
the  U.S.  media,
ExxonMobil admitted that it was involved in the draft-
ing of the Bush-Cheney energy plan, and at least one
direct consultation between Raymond and Cheney’s
office has been disclosed.111 The resultant plan calls
for increasing domestic supplies of oil and gas, and
opening federal lands for drilling, thus giving renewed
support to the coal and nuclear power industries.

Bush Echoes ExxonMobil
The  similarities  between  ExxonMobil’s  statements
and  the  words  coming  out  of  Bush’s  mouth  are
uncanny  and  likely  not  coincidental.  In  April  2001,
ExxonMobil  paid  for  advertisements  that  described
the  Kyoto  Protocol  as  “fundamentally  flawed”  and
“fatally politicized.” After Bush rejected the treaty, he
described  the  Kyoto  Protocol  as  “fatally  flawed  in
fundamental ways.”112

Bush’s  reasons  for  withdrawing  the  United  States
from the Kyoto Protocol reflected ExxonMobil’s argu-
ments  of  the  past  decade.  Bush  rejected  the  treaty
because113:

• The emissions targets set forth in the protocol are

not scientifically justified;

• The Kyoto Protocol is “fatally flawed” and “ineffec-

tive;”

• It would hurt the U.S. economy and mean massive

job losses;

• The largest developing countries are exempt – even
though his father approved their initial exemption in
the  1992  UN  Framework  Convention  on  Climate
Change at the Rio Earth Summit.

Despite Dahan’s claim that “It is ridiculous to suggest
that  our  contributions  could  buy  influence  on  U.S.
government  policy,”114
immediately  following  his
speech in London (October 2001), Dahan boasted to
the  Financial  Times that  the  Bush  alternative  to  the
Kyoto  Protocol  “will  not  be  very  different  from
what you are hearing from us.”115

In fact, he was right. Below are ExxonMobil’s recom-
mendations  for  a  “sounder  climate  policy,”  followed
by the Bush plan as announced on 14 February 2002.

15

From  ExxonMobil  paid  newspaper  advertisements
and  policy  speeches,  their  wish  list  on  climate  is
clear:
1. Encourage voluntary actions.116
2. Link emissions to economic growth.117
3. More  research  is  needed  –  on  the  science  of  cli-

mate change; for renewables.118

4. Research for “long-term mega-technologies” such

as fuel-cells, clean coal.119

5. Research  and  promote  carbon  separation  and

storage.120

Bush  Administration  Global  Climate  Change
Policy 121:
1. Voluntary emissions reductions;
2. The need to link emissions to economic growth;

slow down and stop before reversing emissions –
18 percent decrease in “greenhouse gas intensi-
ty” by 2012 – meaning business as usual, or
worse.122 According to the White House, “This
goal is comparable to the average progress that
nations participating in the Kyoto Protocol are
required to achieve.”123

3. $1.7 billion to fund basic scientific research on
climate change (actually announced in 2001).
4. In January, Bush announced a major new initia-

tive on fuel cells with General Motors – his
“Freedom Car” program; ExxonMobil is partnering
with GM in developing fuel cell powered cars
fueled with hydrogen from gasoline.

5. $1.3 billion for research on energy and carbon

sequestration technologies.

Political Dirty Tricks

On the One Hand: Developing Country
Commitments and the Byrd-Hagel Resolution
Although developing countries emit only a fraction of
global  greenhouse  gases,  and  the  historical  burden
for  emissions  rests  on  the  industrialized  world,
ExxonMobil  continues  to  argue  that  the  Kyoto
Protocol  excludes  developing  countries  such  as
China  and  India,  and  that  developing  countries
should  make  the  same  binding  commitments  to
immediate reductions in emissions as the industrial-
ized world.

However, the Kyoto Protocol is a crucial and signifi-
cant  first  step  towards  tackling  global  warming,
which does include developing countries. Under the
Kyoto  Protocol,  developing  countries  are  allowed
some  increases  in  emissions  in  the  short  term,  and
more  time  to  bring  their  emissions  under  control,  in
keeping  with  an  international  treaty  signed  in  1992,
that included the United States.

At the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, all nations agreed
to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on
Climate Change (UNFCCC). The first President Bush
signed  this  convention,  and  the  U.S.  Senate  ratified
it, making it U.S. law. Under the UNFCCC, all parties
agreed that the developed countries – those respon-
sible  for  the  vast  majority  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)
emissions  since  the  dawn  of  the  industrial  age  –
would  take  the  lead  in  reducing  emissions.  Once
developed countries, such as the United States, have
made  progress  on  reducing  their  own  emissions,
developing countries will be required to reduce emis-
sions as well. However, until the United States takes
the  lead  and  starts  to  set  an  example,  we  cannot
expect developing nations to make commitments to
reduce emissions.

The  United  States,  with  less  than  five  percent  of
today’s global population, is responsible for 25 per-
cent of total current emissions worldwide – far more
than  any  other  individual  country  in  total  and  per
capita.  In  contrast,  developing  nations  have  already

begun  to  put  policies  in  place  to  reduce  their  emis-
sions  of  CO2  and  other  global  warming  gases.  For
example,  China  has  eliminated  subsidies  for  coal,
has ordered the closure of about 25,000 coal mines,
closed down inefficient coal-fired power plants, and
has set targets for the use of renewable energy tech-
nologies.  From  1991  through  2001,  China’s  emis-
sions grew 8.4 percent, while U.S. emissions (which
began the decade at a far higher level) rose 14 per-
cent. During this same time period, China’s economy
grew four times faster than that of the United States
– 142 percent versus 31 percent.124 According to the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, “even if the
Chinese economy continues to grow five percent to
six percent per year, by 2020 China’s carbon dioxide
emissions  still  will  be  significantly  below  U.S.  emis-
sions levels in 1990.”125

The  argument  ExxonMobil  uses  again  and  again  to
try to prove its case both on the legitimacy of its eco-
nomics  and  the  long-term  position  of  the  U.S.  gov-
ernment, is the 1997 Senate Resolution 98. The vote
was 95-0 in favor of a resolution by Senators Hagel
and  Byrd  recommending  that  the  United  States
should  not  sign  an  international  agreement  on  cli-
mate change unless it contained specific new com-
mitments for developing countries.

A  close  look  at  the  political  context  of  the  time
reveals extensive lobbying by Mobil, and by Exxon’s
trade and lobby groups in favor of the resolution, and
close links between Senator Chuck Hagel, Chairman
of Senate Foreign Relations, and the oil industry.

For example:

• Mobil took out full-page advertisements in the U.S.
press in June 1997, prior to the Senate vote, advo-
cating that “Instead of rigid targets and timetables,
governments  should  consider  alternatives…
encourage  voluntary  initiatives.”  It  highlighted  the
upcoming Senate vote, and concluded: “By early…
[in  the  21st]  century,  fast-growing  developing

17

nations  will  be  the  largest  carbon  emitters.  That  is
why it is incumbent  on  all  nations to participate in
the solution even in the short term.”126

• After  the  vote,  Mobil  took  out  further  advertise-
ments  expressing  support  for  the  concerns  raised
by  the  Senate  vote  over  the  equity  of  a  climate
treaty  that  excluded  developing  countries  and
might result in “serious harm to the economy of the
United  States.” It  suggested  that  “when  the
Congress speaks this forcefully, the American pub-
lic  as  well  as  the  administration  should  take
notice.”127

• In  the  run  up  to  the  Senate  vote,  the  American
Petroleum Institute signed a U.S. newspaper adver-
tisement on 23 June 1997, addressed to President
Clinton and stating API’s support for the anti-Kyoto
resolution  by  Byrd  and  Hagel.128 Hagel  had  close
links with the API at this time; he spoke at its con-
ference  in  November  that  year,  just  prior  to  Lee
Raymond,  who  quoted  Hagel’s  resolution  in  his
speech.129

• The U.S. Business Roundtable (BRT) ran a $1 mil-
lion  advertising  campaign  on  climate  change  in
June 1997, urging the Clinton administration not to
rush  into  policy  commitments  without  fully  under-
standing the consequences. This campaign includ-
ed  full-page  advertisements  in  The  Wall  Street
Journal and  The  Washington  Post,  signed  by  both
Exxon  and  Mobil.130 The  BRT  also  sent  a  letter  to
Senator  Hagel  on  8  July  1997,  supporting  his
upcoming senate resolution, on the basis that “the
science is less than compelling.”131

On the Other Hand, Developing Countries Should
Not Commit
In October 1997, just prior to the international climate
negotiations  in  Kyoto,  Japan,  Exxon  CEO  Lee
Raymond  urged  Asian  governments  at  the  World
Petroleum  Congress  in  Beijing  to  continue  to  fight
emissions  regulations  for  at  least  the  next  two
decades.  Having  previously  argued  that  the  lack  of
developing  country  participation  was  unfair  to  the
United  States,  he  now  threatened  that  developing
countries  would  lose  foreign  investment  if  binding
targets were agreed upon at Kyoto: “It would be trag-
ic indeed if the people of this region were deprived of

18

the opportunity for continued prosperity by misguid-
ed  restrictions  and  regulations.” Claiming  that  “the
case  for  global  warming  is  far  from  airtight,”
Raymond  also  peddled  the  scare  story  that  emis-
sions  reductions  would  entail  “energy  rationing
administered  by  a  vast  international  bureaucracy
responsible to no-one.”132

By simultaneously suggesting that the United States
must not act unless developing countries join them,
and that developing countries should not reduce their
emissions because it would hinder economic devel-
opment, Exxon and the rest of the industry had effec-
tively created an impasse from which the only policy
that could emerge was inaction.

The UN Would Rule the World, Says ExxonMobil
During  the  negotiations  over  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in
Kyoto,  Japan,  December  1997  the  Global  Climate
Coalition  (GCC)  produced  a  press  briefing  stating
that:  “U.S.  sovereignty
is  at  risk,” and  that
“Negotiating  text  gives  a  UN  body  –  dominated  by
developing countries – permanent license to control
U.S. economic growth, without Senate ratification or
domestic legislation.”133 Exxon continues to use such
divisive rhetoric.

These statements are false for several reasons. First,
as with any treaty, the U.S. Senate would have to rat-
ify  the  Kyoto  Protocol  for  it  to  become  U.S.  law.
Second, it would be up to United States government
alone  to  determine  how  it  would  meet  its  commit-
ments  under  the  treaty.  No  other  country,  govern-
ment  or  organization  can  change  the  laws  of  the
United  States.  Ratification  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol
would  not  require  the  United  States  to  give  up  leg-
islative,  economic  or  territorial  control;  thus,  the
treaty  would  not  compromise  U.S.  sovereignty.
Assuming  the  United  States  became  a  party  to  the
treaty,  we  will  be  a  party  to  future  negotiations  to
advance the commitment levels for future emissions
reductions,  and  will  have  control  over  the  targets
established for our nation. Finally, countries enter into
negotiations and sign treaties because such treaties
are  considered  to  be  mutually  beneficial  –  we  gain
more  by  moving  forward  with  the  other  parties
involved than would otherwise be the case.

Everyone Opposes The Kyoto Protocol, Says
ExxonMobil
According  to  ExxonMobil  the  vast  majority  of  U.S.
politicians  and  businesses  oppose  the  Kyoto
Protocol.134 In actuality, while there are clearly strong
feelings about Kyoto in the United States, opinion is
divided. A U.S. public opinion poll, conducted by The
New York Times/CBS in June 2001, shortly after the
Bush  administration  rejected  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in
March  2001,  found  that  three  out  of  four  people
believed  immediate  action  was  required  to  tackle
global  warming.  Furthermore,  “more  than  half  the
public said that the United States should abide by the
agreement,  even  if  it  meant  that  China  and  India
would not have to follow the same standards.135

ExxonMobil’s  claim  that  other  U.S.  businesses  and
politicians also oppose the Kyoto Protocol is self-ful-
filling.  ExxonMobil  has  led  the  campaign  for  U.S.
opposition  to  Kyoto,  and  has  been  successful  in
influencing  politicians,  industry  and  the  U.S.  public.
ExxonMobil has undertaken a multimillion-dollar, ten-
year  campaign  of  dirty  tricks  targeted  toward  the
United States to prevent international action on glob-
al warming.

Furthermore, it appears that  many of the  U.S. trade
associations that ExxonMobil claims “support/share”
its position are in fact being driven by ExxonMobil.136
One of the most anti-Kyoto of these, the U.S. Council
for International Business (USCIB) wrote to President
G. W. Bush - allegedly on behalf of all its members –
in support of his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol.137
A  Greenpeace  survey,  which  sampled  some  of  the
major  members  of  the  USCIB,  confirmed  that  many
of  these  companies  were  not  consulted  before  the
letter  was  sent  to  President  Bush  and/or  did  not
agree  with  the  letter’s  content.  For  example,  British
Telecom  North  America
the
Greenpeace survey: “We belong to this organiza-
tion for reasons of trade relations and were not
consulted on the Kyoto statement. It therefore
does not reflect our views.”138

Over the past few years, numerous bills with biparti-
san  support  have  been  introduced  in  the  U.S.
Congress  to  address  climate  change  and  reduce
domestic carbon dioxide emissions through pollution
controls,  development  of  more  energy  efficient  and
renewable energy technologies, and to promote pub-

lic awareness of the climate issue. Several moderate
and  conservative  Republicans,  including  Senators
Olympia  Snowe  and  Susan  Collins  of  Maine,  and
Sam  Brownback  of  Kansas,  have  introduced  or  co-
sponsored measures that aim to reduce the threats of
global warming.139 An amendment offered in the U.S.
House of Representatives in 2000 (H.R. 1646140) stat-
ed that: “climate change poses a significant threat to
national  security,  the  American  economy,  public
health  and  welfare,  and  the  global  environment…”
and  “more  efficient  technologies  and  renewable
energy sources will mitigate global warming and will
make the U.S. economy more productive and create
hundreds of thousands of jobs.” It further stated that,
“action  by  the  U.S.  to  reduce  emissions,  taken  in
concert with other industrialized nations, will promote
action  by  developing  countries  to  reduce  their  own
emissions.”

On  3  August  2001,  Senators  John  McCain  (R  –  AZ)
and Joseph Lieberman (D – CT) announced plans to
introduce legislation that would impose a nationwide
“cap  and  trade”  system  on  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions  during  a  colloquy  on  the  Senate  floor.  They
stated that voluntary approaches to emissions reduc-
tions  “will  not  be  enough  to  meet  the  goal  of  pre-
venting  dangerous  effects  on  the  climate  system,”
(McCain) and that “voluntary programs, unfortunate-
ly, do not work” (Lieberman) Furthermore, they noted
that  “American  businesses  will  suffer  as  the  rest  of
the industrial countries begin trading emission cred-
its  under  the  Kyoto  climate  agreement  recently
rejected  by  the  Bush  administration.”141  Lieberman
went so far as to say that “I believe that this failure [of
the  government  to  engage  in  the  issue  of  climate
change]  abdicates  the  United  States’  position  as  a
leader in environmental affairs and places U.S. indus-
try  at  risk.”142 Just  one  day  before  their  announce-
ment, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unan-
imously  approved  a  resolution  that  urged  Bush  to
reconsider  his  rejection  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol.143 At
the same time, Senator Jim Jeffords (I-Vermont), who
left the Republican party in early 2001 and gave con-
trol of the Senate to the Democrats, announced that
he intended to get a bill passed to regulate CO2 and
three other pollutants.144

ExxonMobil’s Efforts Beyond U.S. Borders
On  22  January  2002,  Lee  Raymond,  Chairman  and
Chief Executive of ExxonMobil (Esso) spent an hour
at  No.  10  Downing  Street  with  UK  Prime  Minister,
Tony Blair. A senior government official later told The
Guardian newspaper that Raymond’s visit was to per-
suade  Blair  “not  to  join  the  chorus  of  international
disapproval”  of  Bush’s  alternative  to  Kyoto,  which
was about to be announced.145

Now  that  ExxonMobil  has  succeeded  in  getting  the
United  States  to  withdraw  from  the  Kyoto  Protocol,
the corporation is lobbying the Canadian government
to reject the treaty. In March 2002, Bob B. Peterson,
the  Chairman  and  CEO  of
(the
ExxonMobil subsidiary in Canada) told the Canadian
Press:

Imperial  Oil

“Kyoto  is  an  economic  entity.  It  has  nothing  to  do
with  the  environment.  It  has  to  do  with  world  trade.
This is a wealth-transfer scheme between developed
and  developing  nations.  And  it’s  been  couched  and
clothed  in  some  kind  of  environmental  movement.
That’s the dumbest-assed thing I’ve heard in a long
time.”146

Both Bob Peterson and Tim Hearn (Peterson’s soon-
to-be  successor)  are  recommending  that  Canada
reject  the  Kyoto  Protocol  as  the  United  States  has
done. Hearn said in early March 2002: “I don’t know
why  we  would  walk  down  this  path.  Why  would  we
create more unemployment and shrink our economy
for ostensibly no real impact on the environment?”147

Economic Scare Tactics

The global treaty and scientific consensus have solid-
ified  despite  ExxonMobil’s  efforts.  As  it  became
increasingly difficult to confuse the public on scientif-
ic grounds, the fossil fuel industry – and ExxonMobil
in  particular  –  has  begun  to  refocus  its  propaganda
on the alleged costs of taking action to reduce car-
bon  dioxide  emissions,  misleading  the  public  and
policy makers about the harm that such efforts would
have on the U.S. economy.

ExxonMobil’s primary arguments have been that the
Kyoto  Protocol  will  impose  significant  economic
costs on the United States and that reductions made
in  the  North  (by  the  developed  nations)  will  have  a
negative economic impact on countries of the South
(the developing nations of the world).

Chicken Little
ExxonMobil  has  repeatedly  claimed  that  the  Kyoto
Protocol  will  impose  significant  economic  costs  on
the United States, bringing with it economic disaster,
massive  unemployment,  and  loss  of  competitive-
ness.148

However,  numerous  studies  have  determined  the
United  States  could  meet  its  targets  under  the
UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol at little to no eco-
nomic cost.

In  February  of  1997,  about  2,000  top  economists
(including  six  Nobel  Laureates)  signed  a  statement
affirming that many potential climate protection poli-
cies  “would  slow  climate  change  without  harming
American living standards, and these measures may
in  fact  improve  U.S.  productivity  in  the  long  run.”
They urged the United States to play a leadership role
at the Kyoto negotiations.149

Protocol,  and  concludes  that  U.S.  emissions  could
be  cut  by  390  million  tons  of  carbon  per  year  by
2010, producing energy saving equal to or exceeding
the  costs.  Furthermore,  the  development  of  new
technology  and  increased  use  of  existing,  cleaner
technologies could allow for continued reductions in
emissions for more than a quarter century.150

According  to  a  study  by  the  Tellus  Institute,  the
United  States  could  reduce  its  carbon  emissions  to
14  percent  below  1990  levels  (the  Kyoto  target  is  7
percent)  while  reducing  pollution,  creating  new  jobs
and  additional  income,  and  saving  the  average
American household nearly $400 per year.151

In 2001, the IPCC Working Group III concluded that
bottom-up studies “…show that the costs of reduc-
ing emissions by 20 percent in developed countries
within the next three decades are negligible to nega-
tive.  Other  bottom-up  studies  suggest  that  there
exists a potential for absolute reductions in excess of
50 percent in the longer term, without increasing, and
perhaps  even  reducing,  total  energy  system  costs.”
Their  report  noted  that  “The  literature  indicates  that
significant  ‘no-regrets’  opportunities  are  available  in
most  countries  and  that  the  risk  of  aggregate  net
damage due to climate change, consideration of risk
aversion, and application of the precautionary princi-
ple provide rationales for action beyond no regrets,”
and that “earlier mitigation action may increase flexi-
bility  in  moving  toward  stabilization  of  atmospheric
concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases.”152 The  report
also  noted  that  “significant  technological  progress
relevant to greenhouse gas emissions reduction [with
renewable  energy  technologies,  for  example]  has
been  made  since  the  SAR  [Second  Assessment
Report]  in  1995  and  has  been  faster  than  anticipat-
ed.”153

In  November  2000,  the  Department  of  Energy
released  a  study  by  five  U.S.  national  laboratories,
Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future. This study exam-
ines  possible  implementation  plans  for  the  Kyoto

Several  countries  in  Europe  have  already  begun  to
reduce  their  emissions  at  home  through  increased
energy  efficiency  and  the  expansion  of  markets  for
renewable  energy.  For  example,  Denmark  now  gen-

21

Both  BP  and  Royal  Dutch/Shell  Group  have  estab-
lished  internal  targets  for  reducing  their  greenhouse
gas emissions. In 1998, BP committed to reducing its
emissions by 10 percent below 1990 levels over a 12
year period; one month later, Shell pledged to do the
same by 2002.160 BP met its target seven years ahead
of  schedule,  and  as  Sir  John  Browne  said  in  March
2002, “we’ve  met  it  at  no  net  economic  cost  –
because  the  savings  from  reduced  energy
inputs  and  increased  efficiency  have  out-
weighed  all  the  expenditure  involved.”161 While
these corporations still have a long way to go, at least
they are heading in the right direction.

The Kyoto Protocol will obviously affect the polluting
energy industries – the fossil fuel industry in particu-
lar – if they do not begin soon to diversify their prod-
ucts  and  invest  in  more  climate  friendly  fuels  and
clean, renewable energy technologies. However, the
average  American  and  society  as  a  whole  will  save
money  and  will  benefit  from  a  more  stable  climate,
better  health,  cleaner  environment,  and  more  jobs.
The costs of inaction will be far greater.

In  early  December  2001,  Robert  A.G.  Monks,  founder  of
the  leading  U.S.  corporate-governance  consulting  firm,
Institutional  Shareholder  Services,  Inc.,  announced  the
introduction  of  a  shareholder  resolution  calling  for
ExxonMobil’s board to rein in Lee Raymond, charging that
Raymond’s “increasingly extreme position on global
warming and other environmental and social issues
was  harming  the  company’s  reputation  and  share
values.”162

In March 2002, ExxonMobil shareholders gained an impor-
tant  victory  when
the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission (SEC) ruled in support of two shareholder res-
olutions  in  the  corporation’s  proxy  for  2002.  The  resolu-
tions,  which  were  filed  by  56  investor  groups  which  are
concerned  about  ExxonMobil’s  position  on  climate
change, call for executive compensation to be linked to the
company’s social and environmental performance, and for
the  publication  of  a  report  on  the  company’s  efforts  to
develop  renewable  energy  technologies.  ExxonMobil  had
challenged the resolutions at the SEC.163

erates more than 18 percent of its electricity with the
wind154,  and  Germany  has  set  a  target  of  meeting
one-fourth of its electricity needs with wind power by
2030.155 The European Union aims to produce 12 per-
cent  of  its  energy,  and  more  than  22  percent  of  its
electricity,  with  renewable  technologies  by  2010.156
The primary impetus behind these targets is Europe’s
commitment  to  reduce  global  warming  gases,  such
as carbon dioxide, under the Kyoto Protocol.

Rather than damaging economies in Europe, policies
put in place to advance the development and use of
renewable  energy  technologies  have  provided  new
markets, numerous jobs, investment, and other ben-
efits.  In  fact,  at  a  G-8  meeting  in  Banff,  Canada  in
April  2002,  Germany’s  Environment  Minister  Jürgen
Tritten  said  that  he  did  not  understand  U.S.  argu-
ments  that  meeting  the  targets  under  the  Kyoto
Protocol  would  harm  the  U.S.  economy.  Germany
has reduced greenhouse gas emissions without sig-
nificant problems. “We are convinced that reduction
of carbon dioxide is not a harm to the economy.”157

The  United  States  has  far  more  renewable  energy
potential  than  all  of  Europe  combined.  In  addition,
most economies of western Europe produce signifi-
cantly  more  output  (measured  in  gross  domestic
product) per unit of energy consumed, meaning that
the  United  States  has  more  opportunities  than
Europe for increasing its energy efficiency and there-
by reducing its energy intensity.

ExxonMobil Behind the Curve
In addition to these voices, other fossil fuel com-
panies  have  called  for  the  ratification  of  the
Kyoto  Protocol.  On  7  November  2001,  Greg
Bourne, the President of British Petroleum for South
Australia  and  Australasia,  called  on  the  Australian
government to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. He said that
the Australian economy would suffer if the nation did
not  commit  to  ratification.158 Bourne  said  that  “the
world is going to have to change its energy use pat-
tern” and that postponing this change will make the
transition more difficult, and “cause too much social
upheaval.”  Further,  in  contrast  to  ExxonMobil’s
charge  that  the  Kyoto  Protocol  will  bring  massive
unemployment, Bourne’s “own belief is that there will
be many more jobs created by changes into a newer
economy than there will be lost.”159

“Just as Enron’s board members failed to properly oversee
their company’s financial dealings, ExxonMobil’s board is
failing  to  oversee  their  company’s  position  on  vital  envi-
ronmental issues.”
–  Sister  Patricia  A.  Daly,  Dominican  Sisters  of  Caldwell
New Jersey.164

North vs. South
While ExxonMobil continues to argue that developing
countries  should  make  the  same  binding  commit-
ments as the developed world, and has been lobby-
ing  Congress  to  reject  the  Protocol  due  to  lack  of
developing  country  participation,  ExxonMobil  also
lobbies  developing  countries  to  reject  any  environ-
mental obligations (including those on the developed
nations) that might “strangle economic growth.”165 In
an effort to silence calls from the developing world for
the  developed  nations  to  honor  their  commitments
under the UN climate convention and to act first, the
corporation  alleges  that  developing  countries  will
face heavy costs if industrialized countries implement
policies  to  reduce  CO2  emissions.166 At  the  same
time,  ExxonMobil  executives,  including  CEO  Lee
Raymond,  have  implied  that  developing  countries
must continue to burn fossil fuels or face losing for-
eign investment, a direct threat to the economies of
these nations.167

These notions have been used by fossil fuel lobbyists
to  foster  suspicions  among  developing  countries.
They  have  also  been  at  the  center  of  a  deliberate,
double-blind strategy to hamstring the entire interna-
tional  process  to  deal  with  climate  change.  And,  of
course,  ExxonMobil  has  completely  ignored  the
costs  –  economic  and  otherwise  –  that  climate
change  will  impose  upon  the  world’s  developing
countries.

The Costs of Inaction
Climate  change  will  have  greatest  impact  on  those
least  responsible  for  the  problem  and  least  able  to
deal with it. According to the IPCC, “the developing
countries,  particularly  the  least  developed  coun-
tries,…  have  lesser  capacity  to  adapt  and  are  more
vulnerable  to  climate  change  damages….”  In  fact,
“[t]he  effects  of  climate  change  are  expected  to  be
greatest  in  developing  countries  in  terms  of  loss  of
life and relative effects on investment and the econo-
my.” Furthermore, “The projected distribution of eco-

nomic impacts is such that it would increase the dis-
parity in well-being between developed countries and
developing countries….”168

“The human consequences – and the economic costs – of
failing  to  act  [on  climate  change]  are  unthinkable.  More
record floods and droughts. Diseases and pests spreading
to new areas. Crop failures and famines. Melting glaciers,
stronger storms and rising seas.”
– Vice President Al Gore, Kyoto, Japan, December 1997.

The insurance industry has become increasingly con-
cerned  about  climate  change.  According  to  a  2001
report  by  Lawrence  Berkeley  National  Laboratory,
“The world’s nations have endured nearly one trillion
dollars  in  economic  losses  (and  560,000  fatalities)
due  to  8,800  natural  disasters  over  the  past  fifteen
years. Three-quarters of the loss costs were weather-
related,  and  a  fifth  were  insured.  Over  the  past  50
years,  the  number  of  weather-related  natural  disas-
ters  has  been  steadily  rising,  as  have  the  total  and
insured losses. Nearly 60 percent of these losses are
visited on U.S.-based companies, and between 1970
and  1999  losses  (adjusted  for  inflation)  grew  nine-
times faster than population.”169

In 2000, the CGNU, the largest insurer in Great Britain
and  world’s  sixth  largest  insurance  company,  said
that if left unchecked, climate change could bankrupt
the global economy by 2065. “Property damage [due
to severe weather] is rising very rapidly, at something
like  10  percent  a  year,”  according  to  Dr.  Andrew
Dlugolecki of CGNU. Furthermore, “…once this thing
begins to happen [the effects of climate change are
seen in the West], it will accelerate extremely rapid-
ly.”170 In 2001, Munich Reinsurance predicted that in a
couple  of  decades  the  cost  of  climate  impacts  will
amount to $300 billion a year.171

The Kyoto Protocol Will Not Work, Says
ExxonMobil
ExxonMobil has also claimed that the Kyoto Protocol
will  do  little  to  achieve  its  goal  of  reducing  green-
house  gas  emissions.172 But  the  Kyoto  Protocol  is  a
living  document,  with  a  series  of  ‘commitment  peri-
ods,’ that will advance, with stronger targets, as time
passes and in future international negotiations. What
the global community has today is an important start

23

to reducing the threat of climate change. It is essen-
tial that the Protocol be ratified and enter into force
as soon as possible so that countries can begin using
the mechanisms (e.g., joint implementation, the clean
development  mechanism,  etc)  and  ensure  that  they
will work on a global scale. Furthermore, one of the
primary  reasons  why  the  Protocol  is  not  stronger
today  is  because  ExxonMobil  has  lobbied  tirelessly
for  more  than  a  decade  to  undermine  the  very
process of negotiating the treaty.

ExxonMobil’s Anti-Climate Front Groups
Much  of  Exxon’s  work  to  undermine  the  climate
negotiations has been carried out under the cover of
industry  lobby  organizations.  Since  1990,  this  net-
work of fossil fuel industry umbrella groups has been
attempting to undermine the scientific evidence and
economic advice given to governments, and stall the
climate negotiations.

In addition to carrying out its own lobbying at the cli-
mate  talks  and  in  the  media,  ExxonMobil  is,  or  has
been,  a  leading  member  of  the  following  organiza-
tions,  and  has  played  a  central  part  in  the  planning
and funding of their misinformation and propaganda
campaigns.  These  lobby  groups  have  worked  hard
both to undermine the climate science and overplay
the economic implications of climate protection.

Global Climate Coalition (GCC)
“Over the past decade, the Global Climate Coalition
has  spent  millions  of  dollars  to  defuse  the  global
warming  issue,  lobbying  members  of  Congress  to
thwart  any  corrective  action,  conducting  economic
studies that conclude that any such measures would
irreparably harm the economy, and sponsoring skep-
tics  on  speaking  tours  to  question  whether  global
warming is the crisis other scientists say it is.”173

The GCC was established in 1989 and, for more than
a  decade,  was  the  most  outspoken  and  confronta-
tional lobby group battling emissions reduction com-
mitments.  It  invested  enormous  resources  into  full-
scale  attacks  on  international  climate  agreement,
waging extensive, multi-million dollar dis-information
campaigns.174 Both  Exxon  and  Mobil  were  board
members  of  the  GCC  and  supported  the  organiza-
tion.175 It was recently reported that during the 1990s,
Exxon  and  Mobil  spent  approximately  $1  billion
financing  the  GCC,  though  accurate  figures  may
never be known.176

In  1997,  British  Petroleum  (BP)  left  the  GCC  after
admitting that climate change required action. During
the period 1999-2000, there was a large-scale defec-
tion of companies such as Ford, Texaco and General
Motors,  but  ExxonMobil  remained.  ExxonMobil  was
the last to leave the GCC, and left only because the
coalition  stopped  listing  corporations  as  member,
accepting only trade associations.177

The  GCC  folded  in  early  2002,  declaring  that
President  Bush  and  the  Senate  were  enacting  their
agenda and thus it had achieved its goals.178

American Petroleum Institute (API)
ExxonMobil  is  a  financial  supporter  of  the  API  and
sits on the board. Lee Raymond, CEO of ExxonMobil,
was the chair of the API from 1995-1997.179 U.S. Vice
President  Dick  Cheney  has  been  a  member  of  its
board of directors, and the API remained a member
of the Global Climate Coalition until the GCC folded
in early 2002.

International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)
The ICC is an industry lobby group that has active at
many sessions of the Kyoto negotiations. At the 6th
Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP  6)  in  The  Hague,
Netherlands, in November 2000, ExxonMobil’s Chief
Scientific Advisor, Brian Flannery, was registered as a
representative of the ICC and was one of the group’s
main spokespeople.

International Petroleum Industry Environmental
Conservation Association (IPIECA)
Exxon and Mobil were both members of the IPIECA
in 1996 when it attempted to influence the December
climate  talks  with  dire  economic  forecasts  resulting
from  emissions  reductions.  ExxonMobil  remains  a
member.

U.S. Business Round Table (BRT)
The  BRT  is  made  up  of  CEOs  from  more  than  200
large  corporations,  including  ExxonMobil.  The  cli-
mate  agenda  it  pushes  calls  for  global  agreements
that  include  developing  countries,  voluntary  agree-
ments  for  industry,  “flexible  policies,”  and  tradable
emissions permits between countries. Tax and regu-
latory measures are strongly opposed. Its 1997 posi-
tion statement proposed that “a climate policy which
fails  to  include  all  nations  should  be  opposed,”
despite  the  fact  that  in  1992,  parties  to  the  UN
Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  includ-
ing  the  United  States,  agreed  that  developed  coun-
tries should act first.180

Global Climate Information Project (GCIP)
In  the  run  up  to  the  international  climate  change
negotiations  in  Kyoto,  Japan  in  1997,  this  industry
coalition ran a $13 million advertising campaign in the
U.S. press, and U.S. national and local television and
radio stations that opposed U.S. commitments to the
upcoming  global  warming  agreement,  claiming  that
developing  countries  were  not  included  and  the
treaty would harm the U.S. economy.181 It was spon-
sored  by  the  GCC  and  by  API  while  Lee  Raymond
was chair.

U.S. Council on International Business (USCIB)
ExxonMobil  is  a  member  of  this  corporate  lobby
group which actively lobbied for President George W.
Bush’s rejection of the Kyoto Protocol.

Pushing ExxonMobil’s Economic Agenda
1996:
In  1996,  the  American  Petroleum  Institute  commis-
sioned and funded an economic model to predict the
costs  of  reducing  carbon  emissions.  The  model  –
produced  by  U.S.  consulting  firm  Charles  River
Associates – predicted that any commitment to legal-
ly  binding  emissions  targets  within  the  next  decade
would entail large costs.182 This model failed to com-
pare  these  potential  Kyoto  Protocol  implementation
costs with economic costs of inaction or delay on cli-
mate protection, nor the costs of past and future cli-
mate  change  impacts  on  humans  and  the  environ-
ment.  Furthermore,  it  did  not  incorporate  the  eco-
nomic  benefits  that  would  result  from  new  markets
and  jobs  created  through  emissions  reduction  poli-
cies  and  the  development  and  use  of  renewable
energy and more energy efficient technologies.

The author of the model, David Montgomery, spoke
at  a  briefing  organized  by  the  U.S.  Council  for
International Business and chaired by the head of the
International  Chamber  of  Commerce  (ExxonMobil  is
a  member  of  both  organizations)  at  the  UN  climate
negotiations  in  Geneva,  December  1996.  He  was
quoted widely in the media throughout that year.183

At the December 1996 climate talks, the IPIECA cir-
culated a briefing paper which concluded that:

“Current  proposals  for  near  term  (10-20  years)
emissions  reductions  in  developed  countries,
which imply curbs on fossil fuel based energy use,
would result in substantial costs that would inhib-
it  economic  growth  and  negatively  affect  trade,
investment,  competitiveness,  employment  and
lifestyles.”184

Exxon and Mobil were both members of the IPIECA
at the time.185

1997:
In February of 1997, 2000 top economists (including
six  Nobel  Laureates)  signed  a  statement  affirming
that  many  potential  climate  protection  policies
“would  slow  climate  change  without  harming
American  living  standards, and  these  measures
may in fact improve U.S. productivity in the long run.”
They urged the United States to play a leadership role
at the Kyoto negotiations.186

25

Following the Senate vote on the Byrd-Hagel resolu-
tion  in  1997  (which  stated  that  the  United  States
should  not  sign  an  international  agreement  on  cli-
mate  change  unless  it  contained  specific  commit-
ments  for  developing  countries),  the  Global  Climate
Information Project (GCIP) began a $13 million adver-
tising  campaign  in  the  U.S.  press,  and  on  U.S.
national  and  local  television  and  radio  stations.187
Before  the  Kyoto  climate  negotiations  had  even
begun the GCIP advertisements claimed that “the UN
Global Climate Treaty isn’t global…and it won’t work
,”  and  that  “Americans  will  pay  the  price…50  cents
more  for  every  gallon  of  gasoline”.188 The  campaign
was sponsored by the GCC and by the API, while Lee
Raymond was chair of the API.189

During the Kyoto negotiations in December 1997 the
Global  Climate  Coalition  produced  a  press  briefing
stating  that:  “Economic  damage  [of  Kyoto]  could
empty  American  pockets…  millions  of  job  losses,
higher gasoline, food and heating bills.”190

1998:
In  1998,  Wharton  Econometrics  Forecasting
Associates (WEFA) published a study commissioned
by API which used every worst case scenario possi-
ble  (no  alternative  fuels,  no  time  to  make  transition,
no international cooperation or market-based mech-
anisms,  no  economic  benefits  from  averting  climate
change  damages  or  reducing  pollution,  etc.),  and
resulted in fear mongering figures regarding the eco-
nomic costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol. The
study  was  not  peer-reviewed.  WEFA  estimated  that
the Protocol would require a carbon tax of $265 per
metric ton over the next decade, and that this would
result in economic output reduction of 3.2 percent (of
$300  billion  in  1992$)  or  a  cost  of  $2,700  per
American  family.  In  addition,  more  than  2.4  million
jobs  would  be  lost,  gasoline  prices  would  rise
sharply,  while  gas  and  electricity  prices  would  dou-
ble,  and  advanced  developing  countries  (which  are
not  yet  required  to  reduce  emissions  under  the
Protocol)  would  gain  a  competitive  advantage  over
the  United  States.191 The  Global  Climate  Coalition
helped WEFA release the study on the national level.

In late 1998, the U.S. Business Roundtable placed an
advertisement  in  The  Washington  Times stating  that
“… the Protocol mandates a 41 percent reduction of
greenhouse gas reductions by 2008-2012,” and other

misleading or false claims.192

2000:
The 6th Conference of the Parties (COP6) to the UN
Climate  Change  Convention  took  place  in  The
Hague,  Netherlands,  in  November  2000.  Two  years
earlier,  in  Buenos  Aires,  the  world’s  nations  had  set
this  conference  as  a  deadline  for  agreeing  on  the
mechanisms  to  achieve  meaningful  reductions  in
greenhouse gas emissions.

One  of  the  most  visible  lobby  groups  in  The  Hague
was  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce  (ICC),
with more than 100 lobbyists. While the ICC put great
effort into positioning itself (and business in general)
as  environmentally  responsible,  it  lobbied  hard  to
prevent  binding  government  regulation.  Instead,  it
encouraged  the  use  of  only  voluntary  action  by
industry,  and  promoted  unlimited  use  of  the  Kyoto
Protocol’s  market  based  mechanisms  –  including
emissions  trading  and  the  Clean  Development
Mechanism.193

During  the  negotiations,  the  Vice  President  of  ICC,
Richard  McCormick,  warned  against  “a  ‘quick  fix,
look  good’  deal  that  would  cause  a  dramatic  and
costly  shift  in  the  way  industrialized  countries  use
energy.”194

One  of  the  main  ICC  spokespeople  at  COP  6  was
Brian  Flannery,  the  Chief  Scientific  Advisor  for
ExxonMobil. On one hand he talked the ICC’s rheto-
ric of free market environmentalism to the media, but
his  real  motives  –  and  those  of  the  ICC  –  became
apparent  when  he  switched  hats  to  speak  out  as  a
lobbyist  for  ExxonMobil.  He  confirmed  to  the  Earth
Times:  “ExxonMobil  is  firmly  against  the  Kyoto
Protocol… it achieves very little and costs too much.”
He  also  claimed  that  emissions  reductions  were
unfeasible: “You are going to need to expand the sup-
ply to meet the pressing future needs for energy, for
things like the modern internet, the ‘e’ economy.”195

The Hague talks collapsed without agreement when
the  U.S.  delegation  refused  to  compromise  over  its
demand  for  the  use  of  “carbon  sinks”  (e.g.,  forest
plantations) to meet U.S. reduction targets.

2001:
In  2001,  ExxonMobil  placed  an  advertisement  in

26

major  U.S.  newspapers  entitled  “Moving  Past
Kyoto…”,  in  which  it  states  that  leading  the  list  of
“fundamental  flaws”  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  “is  the
growing  recognition  that  most  governments  cannot
meet the politically chosen targets without resorting
to  economy-wrecking  measures.”  It  goes  on  to  say
that “Kyoto was too much too soon.”196

By contrast, if the targets had been chosen based on
the science, they would be far higher. The science is
unambiguous on this point: to arrest global warming
requires worldwide reductions in carbon emissions of
70 percent.197

In its drafts of the Third Assessment Report, pub-
lished in January and February 2001, the IPCC con-
firmed that “using known and currently available
technologies, global greenhouse emissions can
be reduced below year 2000 levels in the peri-
od 2010-2020 at zero net costs, with at least half of
this achievable at negative costs (i.e. at a profit).”198

Ignoring the Future – Missing the Boat on Clean Energy

If governments do not act now to stop further explo-
ration  to  find  and  exploit  more  oil  and  other  fossil
fuels,  and  instead  accelerate  the  transfer  of  invest-
ment  into  renewable  energy,  the  world  will  be  com-
mitted to new oil, gas and coal developments which
the planet’s atmosphere and climate will not be able
to withstand. ExxonMobil, and the Bush administra-
tion, continue to ignore this reality.

In an April 2001 advertisement posted in U.S. news-
papers,  ExxonMobil  recommended  a  number  of
steps  that  the  Bush  administration  should  take  to
deal  with  climate  change.  One  of  those  “concrete
proposals”  was  to:  “Realistically  appraise  and
address barriers to renewable energy….”199

But ExxonMobil has no interest in actually developing
and using renewable energy technologies. In fact, in
March  2002,  the  corporation’s  chairman  and  CEO,
Lee Raymond, said that without “new breakthroughs
in  green  energy”  he  does  not  intend  to  invest  in
renewable energy. “We’ve been there, done that,” he
says. In the early 1980s he helped run investments in
solar, wind and battery power on which Exxon claims
to have spent $500 million before selling out.200

According  to  René  Dahan,  Director  and  Executive
Vice President of ExxonMobil:

“Renewables will have their part. How big or small a
role depends on addressing major issues of cost and
impact.  Government  mandates…  can’t  overlook
basic  issues  of  science  and  economics,  and  we’ll
continue to make ourselves unpopular by telling any-
one who’ll listen about the realities.”201

However,  there  have  been  numerous  breakthroughs
in renewable energy technologies over the past two
decades.  Like  the  mobile  telephone  industry,  the
renewable  energy  industry  today  bears  no  resem-
blance to what it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Costs
have declined dramatically and will continue to drop
with  new  advancements  in  technology  and  greater

economies of scale. In fact, wind generated electric-
ity is now cost-competitive with fossil fuel generation
in  good  wind  sites,  and  far  cheaper  than  nuclear
power.  Wind  power  is  the  world’s  fastest  growing
energy source, growing as quickly as the telecommu-
nications industry, with solar photovoltaics (PVs) not
far behind. This is despite the fact that in many coun-
tries,  such  as  the  United  States,  government  subsi-
dies  for  conventional  energy  fuels  and  technologies
continue  to  be  many  times  higher  those  going  to
renewable energy.202

Renewable  energy  –  wind,  biomass,  geothermal,
ocean/wave,  and  solar  power  –  could  supply  all  of
the world’s energy needs. Denmark has led the world
in  showing  that  there  are  no  technological  or  eco-
nomic  barriers  to  renewable  energy  that  cannot  be
overcome.  Denmark  already  gets  18  percent  of  its
electricity from wind power, and plans to increase this
share  to  50  percent  by  2030.203 Germany  has  set  a
goal of producing 25 percent of its electricity from the
wind  by  2030.204 And  the  European  Union  has  set  a
target of generating 12 percent of its energy and 22
percent  of  its  electricity  with  renewables  by  2010.205
Developing countries such as China, India and Brazil
have  also  committed  to  significant  increasing  in
capacity of renewable energy technologies. The mar-
ket  potential  for  renewable  energy  and  energy  effi-
cient  technologies  is  enormous.  According  to  some
forecasts,  clean  energy  markets  will  grow  from  less
than  $7  billion  in  2000  to  more  than  $82  billion  by
2010.206

A 1997 U.S. case study concluded that less than five
percent  of  U.S.  energy  sector,  heavy  industry  and
energy-intensive transport sector jobs are likely to be
affected by policies to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions, and that far more jobs will be created than lost
in the United States.207

In his October 2001 speech, Dahan also stated that:
“The renewable industry does not suffer from a lack
of  investments….  What  it  will  suffer  from  is  the

28

absence  of  significant  breakthrough  advances  to
close  the  economic  gap  with  competing  energy
forms. This will come from research, not from manu-
facturing investments.”208

However,  experience  in  the  United  States,  Europe,
Japan and elsewhere has demonstrated that govern-
ment policy is the most important factor in determin-
ing  the  success  of  renewable  energy  technologies.
Furthermore,  policies  that  create  a  market  for  these
technologies encourage private investment in renew-
ables research and development (R&D) and produc-
tion capability, and enable the experience in installa-
tion, operation and maintenance, and the economies
of  scale  that  can  significantly  reduce  the  costs  of
renewable energy.209

If  a  corporation  of  ExxonMobil’s  size  –  one  of  the
world’s largest – were to shift significant investment
out of fossil fuels and into renewable energy, it could
play an important role in further reducing the costs of
renewable  energy.  Unfortunately,  ExxonMobil  dis-
misses  non-fossil  fuel  sources  of  energy  such  as
renewables,  despite  the  growing  investments  in
these  technologies  by  other  major  international  oil
companies  including  British  Petroleum  (BP)  and
Royal Dutch/Shell.

But,  rather  than  investing  in  renewable  energy,
ExxonMobil is investing more and more money in oil
and gas. ExxonMobil is not interested in developing
renewables,  but  in  finding  alternative  ways  to  use
fossil  fuels.  Its  “solutions”  to  climate  change  range
from “cleaner fuels,” to advanced drilling techniques,
to increased energy efficiency of their operations, to
tree planting. None of these actions will reduce car-
bon dioxide emissions.

“Cleaner  fuels”  such  as  low-sulfur  diesel  reduce
some  airborne  pollutants,  but  do  not  reduce  the
emissions that cause global warming. Hydrogen fuel-
cell  vehicles  offer  great  future  potential  –  but  the
energy  generated  will  be  carbon-free  only  if  the
hydrogen fuel is produced with renewable energy. It
is  no  surprise  then  that  the  fuel  cell  vehicle
ExxonMobil  is  working  to  develop,  in  coordination
with auto manufacturers, will use gasoline to produce
the hydrogen fuel.

and its return on capital was 17.8 percent. The cor-
poration’s  total  capital  expenditures  were  $12.3  bil-
lion210,  and  its  upstream  capital  and  exploration
expenditures  totaled  around  $8.8  billion.211 But
ExxonMobil did not invest a single cent in renewable
energy technologies.

By contrast, BP and Shell have both agreed to spend
hundreds of millions of dollars each on their renew-
able energy divisions. Both companies have stressed
that they want to turn what could be a regulatory bur-
den  into  an  eventual  profit.  “The  element  of  profit
stems from our belief that commercial mechanisms,
such  as  those  included  in  the  [Kyoto]  protocol,  are
the way to solve problems like global warming,” says
BP  spokesman  Roddy  Kennedy.212 BP  and  Shell
spend a fraction on renewables of what they spend
exploring  and  developing  fossil  fuels,  and  a  mere
fraction of what they could spend on renewables. Yet
the divide between these companies and ExxonMobil
is enormous.

Dahan  concluded  his  statement  by  saying  that:
“…most  importantly  [governments  must]  undertake
research on … long-term mega-technologies such as
fuel cells, clean coal, CO2 separation and storage,…”
“We need to remember that those new technologies
do not exist today and yet they represent the only, I
repeat,  the  only  effective  long  term  response  to
potential climate change.”213

ExxonMobil  wants  to  have  it  both  ways  –  it  claims
that  renewable  energy  technologies  require  major
breakthroughs  and  are  too  expensive.  At  the  same
time,  it  calls  on  governments  to  invest  significant
amounts  of  money  in  new  “long-term  mega-tech-
nologies” that will continue our reliance on dirty, pol-
luting fossil fuels for decades to come. Not only are
these  long-term  fossil-reliant  technologies  behind
most renewable technologies in terms of technologi-
cal  development  and  cost,  but  their  costs  also  go
beyond massive investments in R&D, production and
fuel costs, and the opportunity costs that come with
continuing to invest in dirty, non-renewable fossil fuel
technologies  rather  than  clean,  renewable  alterna-
tives.  Carbon  dioxide  extraction  and  sequestration
are end-of-pipe solutions.

In  2001,  ExxonMobil  earned  $15.3  billion  in  profits

Renewable  energy  technologies  are  available  today
and  their  use  is  expanding  rapidly  worldwide.

29

Leaders  in  business  and  government,  around  the
globe,  are  calling  for  a  transition  to  a  clean  energy
economy to address global climate change, increase
national  security,  and  meet  the  rising  demand  for
energy worldwide.214 ExxonMobil’s tactics – calling for
more research and development, for example – sim-
ply seek to delay this transition and to continue indef-
initely the use of fossil fuels.

Lou  Noto,  Vice  Chairman  of  ExxonMobil,  has  also
stated that the corporation is “against mandates and
subsidies, which distort markets, decrease efficiency
and  raise  costs  to  consumers.”215 Clearly,  he  was
referring  only  to  subsidies  for  non-fossil  fuels  and
technologies, and he failed to mention the fact that,
at  least  in  the  United  States,  government  subsidies
continue to favor conventional fuels and technologies
over renewables.216

“Renewables like wind, solar, and biomass can be players
only in niche markets today, where they don’t have to com-
pete with fossil fuels, which are abundant, affordable and
efficient.”
- Lou A. Noto, Vice Chairman, ExxonMobil, Tokyo, Japan,
15 February 2000.217

“They  [renewable  energy  technologies]  are  now
ready  to  be  brought,  full  force,  into  service….
Speedy  action  by  the  Administration  and  the
Congress is critical to establish the regulatory and
tax  conditions  for  these  renewable  resources  to
rapidly reach their potential.”

Bill  Clinton)  R.  James  Woolsey,  Former  Chairman  Joint
Chiefs  of  Staff  (under  Richard  Nixon)  Admiral  Thomas  H.
Moorer,  and  Former  National  Security  Advisor  (to  Ronald
Reagan) Robert McFarlane, 19 September 2001.

Conclusion

ExxonMobil’s operations over the past decade make
it  clear  that  the  company  will  stop  at  nothing  to
thwart  action  to  address  the  serious  issue  of  global
warming. ExxonMobil is guilty of:

• Sabotaging  the  only  international  treaty  to  solve

global warming;

• Deliberately deceiving the public by manipulating and
misrepresenting  solid  scientific  research  on  global
warming;

• Deliberately misleading government officials in the

U.S. and abroad.

ExxonMobil  bears  significant  responsibility  for  the
current,  weakened  state  of  the  only  international
agreement to tackle global warming.  While one hun-
dred seventy-eight nations have now agreed to legal-
ly  binding  emissions  reductions,  the  United  States,
under  the  Bush  administration,  with  ExxonMobil’s
guidance, refuses to take part in the Kyoto Protocol
agreements.  The  U.S.  and  Exxon  are  now  lobbying
other nations not to ratify the treaty. Knowing that a
treaty ratified without the U.S. would be embarrass-
ing  and  create  problems  for  multi-national  corpora-
tions,  Australia  recently  switched
its  stance,
announcing  that  it  will  not  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol
until  the  United  States  has  done  so.  In  Canada,
ExxonMobil’s  Imperial  Oil  has  been  at  the  lead  of
forces pushing for their country to stall ratification as
well.

ExxonMobil  must  also  bear  significant  responsibility
for the lack of a real domestic plan to deal with the
United States’ 25 percent share of global greenhouse
gas  pollution.  The  company  has  been  one  of  the
most  active  players  working  to  deliberately  under-
mine  domestic  global  warming  pollution  reductions.
This  Bush  administration  is  taking  us  backwards  to
the same voluntary global warming plan endorsed by
the  first  President  Bush.  That  agreement  failed  to
achieve  any  pollution  reductions,  resulting  in  the

charge  for  mandatory  cuts  embodied  in  the  Kyoto
Protocol.    We  also  see  echoes  of  the  voluntary  air
pollution  controls  that  failed  Texas  five  years  ago,
after being written by Exxon for then Governor Bush.
The  amount  of  influence  ExxonMobil  wields  over
President  Bush  should  not  be  discounted.  While
Bush  claims  he  wants  to  lead  the  world  on  climate
change,  it  is  clear  that  he  is  the  one  being  led  –  by
ExxonMobil,  which  has,  in  effect,  both  written  and
paid for his climate policy.

ExxonMobil’s  propaganda  and  lobby  machine  must
be stopped if the Kyoto Protocol is to be saved and
global warming addressed by the international com-
munity. For the global community to escape the most
serious impacts of global warming, ExxonMobil must
shift its resources to promote a clean energy future.
To  adequately  demonstrate  true  commitment  to  the
planet’s  most  pressing  environmental  crisis
ExxonMobil must immediately:

•Support  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  the  world’s  only  inter-
national treaty on global warming;

•Stop denying the solid scientific consensus backing
the Kyoto Protocol;

•Stop  deceiving  the  American  public  and  govern-
ment  with  misleading  advertising  campaigns  and
deceptive lobbying efforts.

Subsidies: Not All Technologies are Created Equal,”
Research Report No. 11 (Washington, DC: Renewable
Energy Policy Project, July 2000), 3-6. According to
Goldberg, only four percent of all subsidies for nuclear,
wind and solar energy technologies during the period
1947-1999 went to solar and wind power. When subsi-
dies for fossil fuels are included, the share of total sub-
sidies that has gone to renewables is even lower.
