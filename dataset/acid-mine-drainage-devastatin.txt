Acid Mine Drainage: devastating to aquatic life
Summary
Acid streams resulting from mining activities from certain types of mineral deposits suchas those at Rapu Rapu are highly toxic to the aquatic environment. The extreme acidity istoxic to most aquatic life and even after neutralisation the precipitate formed continues toaffect aquatic organisms. Toxic elements, such as copper, cadmium and zinc are oftenassociated with acidic mine drainage, contributing substantially to the devastating
ecological effects of acid mine drainage.
An outflow of acid mine drainage from the Lafayette mines in Rapu Rapu into the sea
would undoubtedly affect local marine life. It could silt up corals causing coral mortalityand cause the depletion of bottom dwelling organisms, which would have domino effectsup the ecosystem, reducing the food sources available for animals at the top of the marine
food chain, e.g. sharks. The toxic elements could also be taken up into the marine food
chain, causing long term health effects to marine life, and some may bioaccumulate up thefood chain.
Although AMD can be treated at the mine to some degree, e.g. by neutralisation at source,
this process is never fully efficient. Furthermore, accidents with the treatment system areinevitable. Earthquakes, tropical storms and typhoons occur regularly in the Philippines.
These could cause tailings dams to break or cause flooding, sending a large pulse of
either acid mine drainage, or the precipitate downstream, which could have devastatingeffects on corals and marine life. Mining accidents with this type of mine have occurredrecently in Europe and also in the Philippines. These have resulted in adverse environmentaland ecological effects, with the possibility of, as yet unquantified, long term impacts.
Therefore, Greenpeace demands that there should be no mining in Rapu Rapu because of
the risk of severe adverse effects on the corals and marine life. Lafayettes discharges flowinto the Albay Gulf, an acknowledged  migration path for whale sharks and five out ofseven of the worlds marine turtles, thus, making it wholly unsuitable for a mine site.
What is acid mine drainage?
Acid mine drainage is predominantly caused by the weathering of pyrite. Pyrite oxidises to produce
very acidic waters (pH < 3), which can solubilise heavy metals and other toxic elements andcause them to be transported downstream, eventually ending up in the sea (Pentreath. 1994;Jenkins et al., 2000.)
Pyrite is a mineral composed of iron and sulphur (FeS
2), often called fools gold because of its
gold colour. Pyrite sometimes occurs in large quantities in various types of mineral deposits, such
as that at Rapu-Rapu. In addition to pyrite, these mineral deposits often contain other, much morevaluable metals such as copper, zinc and gold, which are mined. Pyrite, however, is not normallymined. One extremely r toxic metal associated with these types of mineral deposits, but notnecessarily mined, is cadmium.


Mineral deposits containing pyrite are usually present as sulphides, deposited in the layers of rock
beneath the earths surface, where there is little or no oxygen. When mining occurs, these deposits
are brought to the surface and crushed. The mineral deposits are crushed, the valuable mineralscontaining copper or zinc or gold taken out and the waste rock containing pyrite is left at the minesite. Thus, large amounts of pyrite become exposed to surface air and water the pyrite weathers,or oxidises. Although acid streams can occur naturally (e.g. Yellowstone National Park, USA),most are a result of mining activities giving rise to acid mine drainage. (Jenkins et al., 2000.)
The weathering of pyrite produces acid. The sulphide in pyrite oxidises to sulphate, to become
sulphuric acid. The iron in pyrite also oxidises or rusts, which drives the reaction further. Specialistoxidising bacteria that can survive the extreme conditions catalyse the reaction. Crushing alsoincreases the rate of weathering, which increases the surface area exposed to the atmosphere.Hence, the weathering of pyrite in mine-waste proceeds quickly compared to normal weathering
of rock and mine wastes containing pyrite can produce extremely acidic waters. The reactions go
on, not only during the life of the mine, but also for many decades and even centuries beyond.
The acid waters dissolve many of the minerals present causing iron and potentially toxic elements
from the ore, such as copper, cadmium and zinc, to be solubilised. The waters are then dischargedinto a stream and, at Rapu Rapu, into the sea. The acidity can be neutralised slowly by the streamor rapidly by the ocean.
Whilst copper and zinc are essential trace elements for plant and animal life (including humans),
at higher doses they are toxic. There are no known beneficial properties of cadmium. It is highlytoxic to plants, animals and humans and many aquatic species are very sensitive to cadmium.When present in bioavailable forms, bioaccumulation has been observed in both aquatic andterrestrial organisms (Savinov, 2003)
Environmental and ecological effects of acid mine drainage
Acidity and metal toxicityThe high acidity of acid mine drainage and the high amounts of dissolved heavy metals (such ascopper and zinc) generally make acid mine drainage extremely toxic to most organisms (Pentreath,1994). Many streams derived from acid mine drainage are largely devoid of life for a long way
downstream.
Sedimentation
Drainage water from acid mine drainage is initially clear but turns a vivid orange colour as itbecomes neutralised because of the precipitation of iron oxides and hydroxides. This precipitate,often called ochre, is very fine and smothers the river bed with a very fine silt. Thus, small animals
that used to feed on the bottom of the stream or ocean (benthic organisms) can no longer feed
and so are depleted. Because these animals are at the bottom of the aquatic food chain, this hasimpacts higher up the food chain into fish. So, even if the acidity and heavy metals are neutralised,acid mine drainage still affects wildlife a long way down stream because of these indirect effects.


In addition to killing bottom dwelling organisms, this smothering ochre or orange precipitate reduces
the amount of gravel for fish to lay their eggs on, and hence affecting fish breeding. (Pentreath,
1994). The sediment also contains the toxic elements that were dissolved in the acid mine drainagebefore neutralisation. These are now transported as particulates downstream and, eventually,into the sea.
Effects on marine ecosystem
Acid mine drainage will be neutralised by the sea, unless it is already neutralised. The ochre
(orange precipitate) may be formed in the sea as the stream enters the sea, or the ochre isformed in the stream and washed in to the sea by the stream (e.g. at high flow). Either way, theochre will increase sediment loads carried into the sea in the vicinity of Rapu Rapu. althoughsome ochre may be carried away by ocean currents.
It is not clear what the effects of acid mine drainage would be, but adverse effects from the mining
are highly likely. Similar effects of the precipitate would be seen in the marine environment as thefresh water. The coral reef surrounding Rapu Rapu is highly likely to also be affected by the ochreprecipitate. The ochre will increase smother the coral reefs in the vicinity of the stream estuary,causing coral mortality. Again, this will not only affect the coral reef itself, which is a valuableecosystem, but there are likely to be knock-on effects up the food chain.
The ochre precipitate could reduce the area available for fish to lay their eggs on by smothering
the seabed near the estuary, hence affecting fish breeding. The smothering would cause loss ofbottom dwelling organisms on the seabed, having domino effects up the food chain by reducingthe food sources available for animals at the top of the marine food chain, e.g. fish and sharks.
There is potential for acid mine drainage to influence the food chain in the near vicinity, resulting
in possible negative effects on the whale shark and other marine life.
Not only could there be a reduction in the area available for fish spawning caused by the smothering
ochre precipitate, but this ochre contains toxic elements such as copper, cadmium and zinc.

Accidents do happen
Can AMD be controlled?Although AMD can be treated at the mine to some degree, e.g. by neutralisation at source bylimestone, settling and tailings ponds or wetlands, this process is never fully efficient. Furthermore,accidents with the treatment system are inevitable. Earthquakes, tropical storms and typhoons
are known to occur in the area. These could break dams, or cause flooding, sending a large pulse
of either acid mine drainage, or the precipitate downstream, which could have devastating effectson marine life. Indeed, similar accidents have happened previously, both in the Philippines andelsewhere.

Learning from history
a) Aznalcóllar, Southern Spain. In April 1998, a tailings dam at a zinc mine in Southern Spain
ruptured and caused the largest environmental pollution accident recorded in Spanish history.The tailings were highly acidic as a result of pyrite waste rock and contained predominantly ironand sulphur with copper, zinc, lead and arsenic. As the dam broke, an estimated 2 million cubic
metres of black acidic, metal-rich sludge and water flowed down river to the estuary, Doñana
(Grimault et al., 1999). This area is an internationally important wetlands area for resident andmigrating birds but became coated in a layer of toxic mud.
All fish and shellfish present in the watercourses of Doñana died and tonnes of dead fish were
collected from the area. Emergency clean up measures costing 200 million Euros, such as removal
of the toxic sludge and setting up a water treatment plant help alleviate the disaster, but
contamination from the spill still persists (Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2006). Follow up studies indicatethat arsenic and copper liver levels were elevated in waterbirds that died in the months after thespill. Copper and zinc have entered the food chain (Taggart et al., 2006), whilst arsenic may be along-term risk to species feeding on roots of aquatic plants as these have become coated witharsenic containing ochre (Taggart et al., 2005). Thus, the tailings spill in Spain not only had
catastrophic short term effects of this tailings spill, there are likely to be long-term effects on
wildlife.
b) Marinduque, Philippines. In 1996, a severe spill occurred from a tailings pond at Marcopper
Mine, Marinduque, when over 1.5 million cubic metres of mine tailings flowed down the Boac riverand into the sea. Subsequent studies have made this a well documented case of the impacts of
acid mine drainage and mine tailings on heavy metal concentrations in the river and marine
environment. Coastal sediments near the river outflow contain high amounts of copper, manganese,lead and zinc and there are concerns that the toxic metals are persisting and may be taken up intobottom dwelling organisms and hence into the food chain (David, 2002). Corals in the area showbands of high toxic metal concentration, which have been dated to the 1996 spill. There is alsoevidence of high sedimentation rates in the corals compatible with ochre precipitation (David,
2003). The impacts on the health of the coral and reef as a whole are, as yet, unknown.
These spills are evidence that a similar occurrence at a fully operational Rapu Rapu would result
in increased acidity in rivers, increased sedimentation on corals the environment and increasedconcentrations of toxic elements in the riverine and marine ecosystems, with possible long termeffects.
Conclusion
An outflow of acid mine drainage from Rapu Rapu into the sea would undoubtedly affectlocal marine life. It could cause coral mortality and the depletion of bottom dwellingorganisms, which would have domino effects up the ecosystem. The toxic elements couldalso be taken up into the marine food chain, possibly causing long term health effects to
marine life, and some may bioaccumulate up the food chain.

Mining accidents with this type of mine have occurred recently in Europe and also in the
Philippines. These have resulted in adverse environmental and ecological effects. Therefore,
Greenpeace demands that there should be no mining in Rapu Rapu because of the risk of
severe adverse effects on the corals and marine life. Lafayettes discharges flow into theAlbay Gulf, a migration path for whale sharks and five out of seven of the worlds marineturtles, thus, making it wholly unsuitable for a mine site.
