One year ago, not many knew the name Koch Industries, a 
publicity-averse private company run by two brothers, David 
and Charles Koch. The Koch brothers each have an esti -
mated net personal wealth of more than $21 billion and are 
now tied for the fifth richest man in America, ranking among 
the top 20 richest people in the world.1 A year ago, even 
reporters at major outlets responded “who?” in conversation 
about the Koch brothers or Koch Industries. Fortunately, the 
shroud of secrecy is being lifted.
Greenpeace released the report Koch Industries: Secretly 
Funding the Climate Denial Machine  in March, 2010 garner -
ing international media attention. In August, The New Yorker 
magazine published a ten thousand-word investigation, 
Covert Operations: The billionaire brothers who are waging 
a war against Obama.2 David Koch tried to undermine the 
New Yorker story by placing a rare interview in New York 
magazine intended to offer a flattering portrait but instead 
adding fuel to the fire.3 Now, a growing awareness of these oil 
billionaires’ destructive agenda has led to increased scrutiny 
and resistance from people and organizations all over the 
United States.
In October, The New York Times and  ThinkProgress.org 
revealed documents detailing the secret meetings the Kochs 
host twice a year to rally their political allies and raise tens of 
millions of dollars to promote their agenda.4 Greenpeace re-
search found that the participants of the 2010 Koch meeting 
in Aspen, Colorado, as exposed by ThinkProgress, have con -
tributed more than $61 million to political campaigns since 
1990.5 The Koch brothers have thrown their weight around 
in politics for a long time. Like their father before them—Fred 
Koch, a free-market ideologue and founder of the John Birch 
Society—the Koch brothers have an extreme anti-regulatory, 
indeed anti-governmental agenda. They have founded and 
funded dozens of think tanks and front groups over the past 
thirty years, including the Cato Institute, the Mercatus Center, 
the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity. The 
clear intention of these groups is to forward an agenda that 
puts corporate profits and so called “free markets” ahead of 
environmental, consumer, health and other protections.
Now the Kochs are being watched as a prime example 
of the corporate takeover of government. Their funding 
and co-opting of the Tea Party movement is now well 
documented. They exemplify the dangers of corporate and 
wealthy individual spending in our elections, which was Executive Summary
overwhelming even before an enormous campaign finance 
loophole was opened by the Supreme Court’s decision 
in the Citizens United v. FEC case.6 Now David Koch is 
recognized in New York social circles not only for funding 
the ballet and major museums, but for his all out assault on the Obama Administration, climate and clean energy policies, 
and other perceived threats to their oil profits and strong 
political ideology.
Update: Funding the Denial Machine
Our March 2010 report documented well over $48 million 
dollars that David Koch and his brother Charles have quietly 
funneled to front groups that actively deny global warming 
science or work to delay policies and regulations aimed at solving the crisis. Over half of that money has been donated since 2005, as climate change policy rose in prominence. 
This update of our 2010 report reveals that the Kochs’ 
funding of the climate denial machine continued apace in 
2009, the latest year for which Koch foundation tax forms 
are available. In 2009, they contributed over $6.4 million 
dollars to some 40 organizations that continue to deny the 
scientific consensus on global warming while attempting to slow or block policies to solve the climate crisis. The Koch 
foundations continue to fund their favorite organizations like 
the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation.
Findings:
•	In	2009	Koch	family	foundations	gave	$6.4	million 	
to	organizations	that	are	part	of	the	climate	denial 	
machine,	raising	the	total	sum	given	to	these 	
groups	since	1997	to	$55.2	million.	$31.6	million	of 	
that	total	has	been	spent	in	the	last	five	years	for 	
which	financial	data	is	available	(2005-2009).
•	The	biggest	recipients	of	Koch	foundations	funding 	
in	2009	included	the	Institute	for	Humane	Studies, 	
the	Mercatus	Center,	Americans	for	Prosperity,	the 	
Heritage	Foundation	and	the	Cato	Institute. 	
•	Americans	for	Prosperity	has	now	received	over 	
$5.6	million	in	documented	donations	from	the 	
Koch	foundations.

Executive Summary
Update: Political Contributions
Koch Industries is now the largest political spender of the 
entire energy sector since the 2000 election cycle, beating 
heavyweights ExxonMobil, Southern Company, American 
Electric Power and Chevron.7
Koch Industries ranked among the top energy sector cam -
paign spenders during the 2010 election cycle.
Findings:
•	In	2010,	Koch	PAC	sent	$2.6	million	to	candidates 	
and	incumbents	and	to	the	leadership	PACs	of 	
those	same	politicians,	raising	its	total	campaign 	
spending	since	the	2008	election	cycle	to	$5.2 	
million,	the	largest	campaign	finance	outlay	over 	
that	time	period	of	any	oil	company.	Ninety	two 	
percent	of	2010	Koch	donations	at	the	federal	level 	
went	to	Republicans.
•	In	2010,	Charles	Koch,	David	Koch,	and	their	wives 	
spent	over	$350,000	on	direct	individual	campaign 	
committee 	and	party	committee 	contributions 	
at	the	federal	level,	raising	their	total	individual 	
donations	since	2004	to	over	$922,000.
•	Koch	Industries	spent	$424,000	on	76	House 	
candidates	in	2010	who	received	endorsements 	
from	astroturf	tea	party	groups	Americans	for 	
Prosperity,	FreedomWorks	or	the	Tea	Party 	
Express.	68	of	these	candidates	were	elected, 	
representing	an	89	percent	success	rate	of	Koch’s 	
investments.
•	Of	the	eleven	freshman	Senators	who	publicly 	
question	settled	climate	science,	ten	received 	
funding	from	Koch	Industries	in	2010,	and	eight 	
of	them	signed	the	Americans	for	Prosperity 	
“No	Climate	Tax	Pledge”	to	obstruct	policy 	
solutions	to	climate	change.	Of	the	38	freshman 	
Representatives	who	deny	climate	science,	22 	
received	Koch	PAC	funding	in	2010,	and	all	38 	
signed	the	AFP	pledge.
•	Koch	Industries	funneled	over	$600,000	in	2010 	
state	political	contributions	in	2010,	raising	its	total 	
state-level	political	expenditures	from	2003-2010	to 	
$1.89	million.Update: Lobbying Expenditures
Our 2010 report found that Koch Industries lobbying expen -
ditures totaled $37.9 million dollars since 2006. Updated 
lobbying expenditure data and 2010 totals have shown a 
substantial increase to that figure.
Findings:
•	Koch	Industries	has	spent	over	$49.5	million 	
dollars	on	lobbying	since	2006,	with	peak	lobbying 	
spending	in	2008	of	over	$20	million.	In	2010,	Koch 	
spent	$8,070,000	on	lobbyists	who	continued	to 	
prowl	the	halls	of	Congress.
Update: New Case Studies in Global Warming Denial
This report delivers three new case studies of Koch-funded 
global warming denial and obstruction to add to the five case 
studies in our 2010 report.
First is the Proposition 23 ballot resolution fight in California 
where Koch joined other out-of-state oil companies to 
bankroll an effort to handcuff the state’s global warming law. 
They eventually lost at the ballot box because of a collective 
voter education effort across the state. Koch front groups 
orchestrated an effort to discredit the law that Proposition 23 
would have suspended.
Second, we document a similar Koch-funded attack on 
the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a greenhouse gas 
reduction program organized by ten northeastern and 
mid-Atlantic states.
Third, we have compiled a dossier on Koch connections with 
right wing and conservative media outlets and pundits. We 
are able to draw a picture of part of the Koch echo chamber 
from public records including the recently revealed list of 
attendees from the summer 2010 private Koch meeting in 
Colorado, where Glenn Beck and other prominent media 
personalities and owners were in attendance.

Koch Industr Ies Bac Ks  
calIforn Ia ProP osItIon 23
Brief:
Koch Industries played a key role in funding Proposition 23, 
a California ballot initiative intended to block state commit -
ments to reduce global warming pollution and promote the 
growth of the state’s clean energy economy. The Yes on 
23 campaign raised $10.6 million, over ninety two percent 
of which came from petroleum and energy companies, 
including over $4 million from Valero Energy, $1.5 million 
from Tesoro Corporation and $1 million from Koch Industries 
subsidiary Flint Hills Resources.8 Koch Industries also 
supported the Proposition through industry front groups, 
including the California chapter of Americans for Prosperity, 
which advertised heavily to support Prop 23, and the Pacific 
Research Institute, which published and circulated flawed 
economic studies of California’s climate and energy legisla -
tion. Proposition 23 garnered national media attention and 
was defeated in the November, 2010 election by a grassroots 
voter education effort across the state.
Full Scoop:
Known as the Global Warming Solutions Act, or AB 32, 
California’s climate and energy bill was signed into law in 
2006. The main provisions of AB 32 include an incremental 
roadmap to reduce California’s greenhouse gas emissions to 
1990 levels by 20209 and implementation of a 33% renewable 
energy standard.10 The economic benefits of AB 32 have 
been repeatedly documented.11Case Studies
On September 20, 2010, Koch Industries’ wholly-owned 
subsidiary,12 Flint Hills Resources, gave one million dollars to 
the Yes on 23 campaign.13 Passage of Proposition 23 would 
have stalled the application of the Global Warming Solutions 
Act until state unemployment dropped to 5.5% and remained 
so for a full year, a level only achieved three times over the 
last forty years.14
Koch Industries supplemented their effort to promote 
Proposition 23 with a $10,000 contribution to California Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina, while $9,600 in 
additional campaign funding was donated directly to Fiorina 
from the Kochs and their wives.
15 Fiorina endorsed the 
Prop 23 campaign in early September, but lost her election 
campaign against Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer.16
As attention was drawn to the money Koch Industries spent 
on Proposition 23, it became clear that the conglomerate 
was supporting Prop 23 through other outlets as well. The 
Kochs relied on cogs in the climate denial machine they fund 
to broadcast a false association between AB 32 and the 
state’s economic troubles.
The California chapter of a Koch-founded and -financed 
astroturf group, Americans for Prosperity (AFP), made 
passing Prop 23 their “highest priority.”17 AFP ran promotional 
ads and held a “No Jobs Fair” at a Republican National 
Committee rally to support the Proposition.18

A second industry front group took a different approach. The 
San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute for Public 
Policy (PRI), which has received over $1.2 million from the 
Kochs since 1997 and hundreds of thousands of dollars from ExxonMobil, was at the forefront of attacks on California’s 
climate and energy law.
19
PRI recycled a widely debunked “Spanish Study ”20 (an 
attack on the renewable energy industry) in order to discredit 
California’s efforts to create more clean energy jobs. PRI 
promoted another study that drew widespread criticism: 
“The Cost of AB32 on California Small Businesses,” written 
by Sanjay B. Varshney and Dennis H. Tootelian.21 Other 
Koch-funded groups, including the Heritage Foundation and 
the California chapter of Americans for Prosperity touted the 
discredited ‘The Cost of AB32” report and its data.22
One month before the November elections, PRI published its own report,
23 authored by in-house economist Benjamin Zy -
cher, who has ties to other Koch-funded groups including the 
Manhattan Institute and the Cato Institute.24 Zycher’s report 
was paid for by the oil-financed Yes on 23 campaign through 
a $40,000 research grant.25 Zycher denied knowledge of the 
report’s funding and challenged his critics to “point to an er -
ror in the paper.”26 Although errors in methodology have been 
publicly presented,27 neither Zycher nor PRI has addressed 
them. The Zycher study was also disseminated by the Koch-
backed Reason Foundation, based in Los Angeles.28Koch Industries’ motivation to attack AB 32 runs deeper 
than the precedent California is setting by reducing global 
warming pollution. A specific AB 32 provision of particular 
concern to Koch Industries is the adoption of a low carbon 
fuel standard (LCFS).29 LCFS is a policy option designed 
to phase out the most carbon-intensive fuels, something 
extractors and refiners of the dirtiest fuels oppose. Koch is 
heavily invested in the tar sands30 in Alberta, Canada through 
Flint Hills’ Pine Bend Refinery in Minnesota, which was 
“specifically designed” to refine Canada’s synthetic crude,31 
and through the operations of another subsidiary, Koch 
Exploration Company.32

Koch front GrouP s attacK 
rGGI – the northeast r eGIonal 
Greenhouse Gas In ItIatIve
Brief:
Koch front groups campaigned against the Regional Green -
house Gas Initiative (RGGI), a market-based cap-and-trade 
program established in 2007 by ten U.S. Northeast and 
Mid-Atlantic states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
power plants. Koch-funded front groups – led by Americans 
for Prosperity (AFP)—joined right wing mouthpieces like 
Glenn Beck and others who labeled RGGI a “cap and tax” 
initiative. Conservative activist Clint Woods of the Koch-
funded American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) stated 
that RGGI and other regional cap-and-trade regimes had 
become the “new battlefield” since federal climate legislation 
was defeated.33 ALEC has provided template legislation for 
states across the country to pull out of regional climate ac -
cords such as RGGI and the Western Climate Initiative. The 
Kochs have already had success in New Hampshire where, 
on February 28, 2011, the state’s House Republicans voted 
to leave the RGGI program in a veto-proof vote. 
Despite supporting campaigns against RGGI, a Koch 
subsidiary participated in the very first RGGI trade of physical 
carbon allowances. As a Koch Supply and Trading spokes -
person said, “Koch has participated in the RGGI market 
since its inception.”34
Full Scoop:
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI—pronounced 
“Reggie”) is a market-based cap-and-trade program 
established in 2007 by ten Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states 
(CT, DE, ME, MD, MA, NJ, NH, NY, RI and VT) to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. In just over 
two years, RGGI states raised over $770 million, putting 
most of the proceeds into clean energy development, home 
weatherization and other conservation programs that reduce 
energy consumption and lower energy bills.
Spreading Lies About a “Stealth Tax”
By the middle of 2010 Americans for Prosperity (AFP) and 
other Koch allies began protesting at RGGI offices and 
attacking the program as a “stealth tax” that threatens to 
raise electricity rates so high that they will sap the nation’s 
economic strength.35 AFP offers little evidence to back the charge. AFP offers 
little evidence to back the charge. RGGI allowances account 
for 0.4% to 1% of average electricity bills across the region, 
or about 73 cents per month.36 Under the RGGI program, 
ratepayers end out saving $3 to $4 for every dollar invested.37
Utility officials agree that RGGI has had a tiny effect on 
electric bills. Early projections were that RGGI would add $3 
to the average household bill in 2015. The actual cost has 
been less than that, according to the New Jersey-based 
Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), one of the ten 
largest electric companies in the U.S.38
Deliberate Strategy
According to Gavin Donohue, executive director of Indepen -
dent Power Producers of New York, an industry lobby, the 
program was targeted by critics because of its potential to 
help build momentum for a national cap-and-trade climate 
program. 
This strategy was confirmed in September, 2010 by 
conservative activist Clint Woods of the American Legislative 
Exchange Council (ALEC), who said RGGI and other regional 
cap-and-trade regimes have become the “new battlefield” 
since federal climate legislation was derailed.39 ALEC, which 
has created template legislation for state lawmakers to use 
as a way to back out of regional climate accords,40 received 
$125,000 from the Koch brothers’ Claude R. Lambe Chari -
table Foundation in 2009 and has received donations totaling 
$533,000 from the Koch foundations since 1997. Koch

editorial board member Stephen Moore, who has attended 
the Koch brother’s political strategy meetings (see page 8), is 
on ALEC’s Board of Scholars.41
After two states diverted a substantial portion of the RGGI 
program’s revenues for other purposes in 2010 ($65 million 
in New Jersey and $90 million in New York), AFP and others 
began to focus its attacks on the program as a “stealth tax” 
that should be scrapped altogether.42 
Environmentalists agree that RGGI revenues should not be 
diverted, especially since the programs have created thou -
sands of clean energy jobs. According to RGGI officials, 80 
percent of the revenues have gone to energy-efficiency and 
related programs, as intended.43 Peter Shattuck, a carbon 
trading analyst with Environment Northeast, told NPR’s 
Robert Siegel, “the vast majority” of RGGI funds had gone 
to hundreds of renewable energy and conservation projects, 
including putting solar panels on schools and helping 
low-income families insulate their homes.44
New Hampshire Legislators Target RGGI 
In 2008, New Hampshire committed to cut CO2 emissions 
from power plants 10% by 2018. 
NH was one of the founding states of the RGGI program, 
with its first auctions taking place in 2009. Since then, the 
state has awarded over $31 million to 36 different energy 
efficiency projects and programs. 45 
In the 2010 elections, the GOP took over the House, winning 
297 of 400 seats, along with 19 of the 24 Senate seats, 
creating a majority that has not happened since 1962.46 Six New Hampshire state Representatives have signed AFP’s 
“No Climate Tax” pledge, which dissuades lawmakers from 
supporting legislation designed to implement solutions to 
global warming.47 Among state candidates who signed a 
separate “Anti-Tax Pledge,” also created by AFP, which more 
broadly opposed taxes and government spending, was 
House speaker William O’Brien.48
O’Brien then spearheaded the GOP campaign to take down 
the RGGI program, and on February 23, 2011 New Hamp -
shire’s House voted to repeal RGGI with a majority that ruled 
out a veto by the governor. The repeal legislation received full 
support from AFP, with NH state director Corey R. Lewan -
dowski claiming in January that RGGI money “was taken by 
regulators from consumers in the form of higher electricity bills and then redistributed to environmental special interests 
friendly to the politicians in power.”
49 
The weekend before the vote, Americans for Prosperity paid 
for automated “robo calls” across the state urging the vote 
against RGGI.50 
In an opinion piece for FoxNews.com after the vote, 
Lewandowski and AFP policy director Phil Kerpen hailed the 
vote as “one giant leap forward,” saying it would raise the 
pressure against similar efforts in New Jersey. 51

in New Jersey that would yank the state out of the RGGI 
climate compact, while pressuring Gov. Christie to issue an 
executive order that would do the same. Although Christie 
has quietly maintained his support for RGGI (he has used 
RGGI proceeds to help develop the state’s offshore wind 
program), AFP and its allies have threatened to oppose any 
future presidential nomination bid if he refuses to change 
his position. “It’s difficult for him to be a credible option for 
conservatives nationally if he doesn’t take a stand on cap 
and trade, and that’s why we think we’ll be able to appeal 
to him,” AFP policy director and Fox News columnist Phil 
Kerpen told Politico.52 
In 2010, AFP organized a series of anti-RGGI rallies in 
New Jersey and outside the RGGI’s auction house in New 
York City. At the New York rally, AFP’s New Jersey State 
Director Steve Lonegan declared that RGGI is “the biggest 
conspiracy between the public sector, big banks and govern -
ment that Americans have ever seen and you—the ratepay -
ers—are going to pay the price.” Lonegan went on to blast 
the two-year-old program as “sketchy, shadowy, clandestine 
and top-secret” to a booing crowd of AFP supporters.53Before organizing the protest, Lonegan and AFP do not 
appear to have checked the list of prospective auction 
bidders, which included Koch Supply and Trading of Wichita, 
KS, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, AFP’s key backer. Koch 
traders proudly purchased the very first trade of physical 
carbon allowances made at a RGGI auction in 2008.54 Ac-
cording to the Albany Times Union , Koch’s traders took part 
in at least three of RGGI’s first nine credit auctions—including 
the auction that AFP recently protested as “secretive”. As 
a Koch Supply and Trading spokesperson said “Koch has 
participated in the RGGI market since its inception.”55
Ironically, the David H. Koch Institute at the Massachusetts 
Institute for Technology has received a fifth of its funding for 
energy efficiency from the RGGI program.56
Despite RGGI’s positive impact on Koch companies and 
outlets, Americans for Prosperity has continued its assault on regional climate initiatives in numerous other states, complimenting the template legislation provided by the 
American Legislative Exchange Council and political support 
from the Koch-funded Heritage Foundation.

A memo obtained by ThinkProgress.org in October, 2010 
revealed an extensive guest list of business and political 
elites who attended the Koch brothers’ secretive biannual 
strategy meeting in Aspen, Colorado.58 The Aspen meeting 
occurred in June, 2010, four months before the memo was 
revealed. Many of the elite attendees represented at this 
meeting provide the Koch network with tremendous propa -
ganda power through their ownership positions and ties to 
major media outlets.59
The Koch influence on this sector of media outlets is 
particularly apparent in their repeated publication of articles 
defending Koch Industries from increased public scrutiny 
over the last year, especially following the Aspen meeting.60
Some of the attendees with major media influence in  
Aspen were:
Glenn Bec K—Fox News and talk radio program host.
Beck was a featured speaker at the secret Koch Industries 
meeting in Aspen. Shortly afterwards, Beck credited Charles 
Koch during a segment of his show mocking an Al Gore 
presentation of climate trends.61 Glenn Beck has also worked 
in cooperation with Americans for Prosperity (AFP) to coordi -
nate Tea Party rallies and provide material for his broadcasts. 
62 Beck publicly defended AFP on air after President Obama’s 
characterized the group as a front for “a big oil company.”63 
Americans for Prosperity has received over $5.6 million from 
Koch foundations in the last five years.
stePhen Moore— Wall Street Journal editorial board 
member and senior economics writer and former 
President of the Club for Growth.64 
Moore has ties to the Heritage Foundation and the Cato 
Institute, two of the top Koch beneficiaries, and was a 
National Review magazine contributing editor.65 
The Wall Street Journal ’s opinion section serves as a 
podium for prominent skeptics with ties to the Kochtopus, 
such as Richard Lindzen and Patrick Michaels.66 Michaels, 
the champion denier of the Cato Institute and other 
Koch-backed institutions, used the Wall Street Journal ’s 
opinion section to continue pushing “climategate” even after scientists were exonerated by formal investigations. Michaels 
himself is coming under scrutiny for being dishonest during a 
2009 Congressional testimony about the funding he receives 
from the oil industry.67 
Between moving to the Wall Street Journal and being 
forced out of the Club for Growth, Moore founded the Free 
Enterprise Fund with Arthur Laffer and Mallory Factor, both 
former Club for Growth directors.68 Arthur Laffer’s Laffer 
Center for Global Economic Growth is tied to Koch Industries 
through its Vice Chairman, Richard Fink, and Executive 
Director Wayne Gable, both prominent Koch executives, 
and a $100,000 grant from the Charles G. Koch Charitable 
Foundation in 2009.69
Moore is also a frequent commentator on CNBC’s Kudlow & 
Co. and Fox News’ On the Record with Greta van Susteren.70

Anschutz’s Clarity Media Group has played a flagship role in 
standing up for the billionaire Kochs over the last year. Since 
the Aspen meeting, pro-Koch publications from both Exam -
iner.com and the Weekly Standard  have been featured on 
Koch Industries’ “Koch Facts” webpage,75 created to dismiss 
allegations of Koch’s various unsavory business practices. 
Clarity’s outlets also published articles attacking Greenpeace 
after our March, 2010 release of Koch Industries: Secretly 
Funding the Climate Denial Movement .76 
The Weekly Standard,  which published a lengthy defense of 
the Koch brothers in March, 2011,77 has also been a promoter 
of so-called “climategate” emails.78 The magazine has served 
as a platform for prominent career climate skeptics Steven 
Hayward and Kenneth Green of the Koch-funded American 
Enterprise Institute (AEI).79
Forbes estimates that Anschutz is the 34th richest American, 
just above Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with a net 
worth of seven billion dollars.80
charles Krautha MMer— Washington Post  syndicated 
columnist, pundit and contributor to the Weekly Standard  
and Town Hall Magazine .81 
Krauthammer is a fervent climate obstructionist who refers to 
global warming as a “religion,” and more broadly claims that 
“scientists are flip floppers, constantly changing their theo -
ries.”82 Krauthammer focuses on vilifying environmentalists 
and political icon Al Gore, rather than debating actual climate 
scientists, in attempts to cast doubt upon the science of 
global warming.83 His disregard for accurate climate science is demonstrated by his references to Czech President Vaclav 
Klaus.84 Klaus, a notorious climate science denier, was a 
keynote speaker at the 2009 International Conference on 
Climate Change. This event, run by the Heartland Institute, 
was a who’s who of career skeptic scientists and pseudo-

MIchael Barone— Resident fellow at the American 
Enterprise Institute, paid Senior Political Analyst for the 
Washington Examiner , and Fox News commentator.86 
Barone was formerly a senior writer with U.S. News & World 
Report , an outlet that has come to the Kochs’ defense,87 and 
a member of the Washington Post  editorial board. Barone 
is also the principal coauthor of the Almanac of American 
Politics , published annually by the National Journal Group.88 
The American Enterprise Institute, which has received 
$150,000 from Koch foundations and over $2.8 million from 
ExxonMobil since 1997, has used its American  blog since 
the Aspen meeting to defend Koch Industries.89
tIMothy c arney— Lobbying editor and senior political 
columnist for the Washington Examiner  and author of 
Obamanomics.90 
Carney has written articles specifically justifying his presence 
at the Koch meeting in Aspen, using them to defend the 
private conglomerate. Despite shielding the Koch brothers 
in his writing, Carney claims to have spoken at the Aspen 
meeting on, “the evils of corporate welfare and bailouts, 
and the destructive influence of the Big Business lobby in 
Washington.” 91 Koch Industries has spent over $49 million 
on federal lobbying since 2006—see pg. 15. Carney also 
disclosed that he has been paid by the Institute for Humane 
Studies (IHS) for speaking events. The George Mason 
University-based IHS received over $2.4 million from the 
Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation in 2009.
Carney’s writing often promotes Senator James DeMint 
(R-SC),92 one of the Kochs’ favorite Senators, who has 
also attended Koch Industries strategy meetings and has 
received at least $76,000 from the Kochs and company PAC 
since 2004 (see pg. 21). Carney’s columns have passionately 
discouraged environmentally sound considerations, such as 
outlawing energy-inefficient incandescent light bulbs.Case Studies

In our 2010 report, KOCH INDUSTRIES: 
SECRETLY FUNDING THE CLIMATE DENIAL 
MACHINE , funding to climate denial 
organizations from the Kochs were 
calculated from 1997 to 2008, and are 
described in detail in that report (pp. 
21–28). Koch foundation tax records 
from 2009 shows that the Kochs 
contributed an additional $6.4 million 
to organizations that are part of the 
climate denial machine. 
In total, the Koch foundations have 
spent over $55 million on grants to 
climate denial groups since 1997. Over 
$31 million of this figure was spent from 
2005 to 2009. Over the same period of 
time, ExxonMobil provided $10.2 million to groups with similar activities.Koch Foundations climate denial Funding, ’97–2009Koch Climate Opposition Funding

Based in Irvine, California, the Ayn Rand Institute (ARI) 
is dedicated to laissez faire capitalism and the pursuit of 
self-interest as developed by Russian-American author Ayn 
Rand. ARI’s writers have referred to a climate science report 
published by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) as 
“a lie,” and have cited the notoriously fabricated “Oregon 
Petition.”121 The Oregon Petition was created by the Oregon 
Institute of Science and Medicine in cooperation with the 
George C. Marshall Institute, a notable recipient of Koch 
and Exxon money, to look like official NAS material. Some 
scientists signed the petition assuming it was indeed created 
by NAS, others signed with the backing of the oil industry, 
and some names were simply fictional characters lifted from 
the show M*A*S*H* and elsewhere.122 
ARI Senior Fellow Keith Lockitch, who spoke at the Heart -
land Institute’s 2009 International Conference on Climate 
Change, authored a paper denouncing the viability of clean 
energy and simultaneously denying the scientific consensus 
of climate change despite arguing that “development under 
capitalism has actually made us safer from climate-related 
risks than ever before in human history.”123

The Acton Institute, which has received over $500,000 from 
ExxonMobil, is an institution that claims to be guided by 
“Judeo-Christian truths.” Acton operates out of Grand Rapids, 
Michigan and Rome, Italy.124 The Acton Institute is intended to 
counter evangelical Christians who have publicly expressed 
the need to address climate change with urgency, citing the 
fabricated “Oregon Petition” and Bjorn Lomborg, a widely 
known pseudo-scholar who mainly tours among organiza -
tions promoting climate skepticism.125 Acton’s media director, Jay W. Richards, states, “climate 
is changing all the time, the real question is if humans are 
causing it.”126 Richards also has ties to the Cato Institute 
and sits on the Board of Advisors for the Committee For 
A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), one of the most vocal 
anti-environmental fronts for the petrochemical and biotech -
nology industries.127 Acton’s governing boards reveals other 
Koch connections through Dr. Alejandro 
A. Chafuen of the Atlas Economic 
Research Foundation and Michael Novak 
of the American Enterprise Institute, as 
well as affiliates of Amoco (BP) and 
Wolverine Gas and Oil.

Located in Alexandria, Virginia, the Center for Freedom & Prosperity (CF&P) and its associated Foundation have taken 
adamant positions against global warming science as part of a pro-big business mission “to lobby lawmakers in favor of 
market liberalization.”
128 CF&P’s Dan Mitchell helped dissemi -
nate the manufactured “climategate” story of stolen emails in 
2009, and claims that organizations and businesses striving 
to find solutions to climate change “have invested money 
in the scam and they will not give up.”129 The think tank 
defended ExxonMobil when Senators Jay Rockefeller and 
Olympia Snowe asked them to stop funding climate deniers 
and applauded oil supermajors BP and ConocoPhillips for 
pulling out of the “statist” U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a 
coalition that intended to pass global warming legislation.130 
The CF&P Foundation’s board reveals numerous connections 
to other climate change deniers funded by the Kochs.131 
Director John Blundell has ties to the Fraser Institute and the 
Atlas Economic Research Foundation, and sits on the Board 
of the Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) at George Mason 
University. IHS is one of Charles Koch’s most heavily funded 
projects—he granted $2.5 million to IHS in 2009 on top of 
a previous $4 million from Koch foundations since 1997. 
Blundell was also president of both the Charles G. Koch and 
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundations, which finance 
IHS, Atlas, the Fraser Institute, and the Center for Freedom 
and Prosperity. Other directors are affiliated with the Cato 
Institute, the Mercatus Center, the Heritage Foundation, and 
the defunct Citizens for a Sound Economy, which split into 
FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity.Koch Climate Opposition Funding

Collegians for a Constructive Tomorrow, or CFACT Campus, 
is the university arm of the Committee for A Constructive 
Tomorrow (CFACT). CFACT students purport to be pro-
environment operating under the slogan “a smarter future for 
people…and nature too!” CFACT students paradoxically run 
small-scale environmentally themed events, such as beach 
clean ups, while disrupting international climate negations 
and supporting broader policies designed to shut out clean 
energy development and perpetuate the burning of fossil 
fuels.132 
Aligned with the views of Paul Driessen, a CFACT senior fel -
low and industry consultant who claims environmentalists are 
subjecting the Global South to perpetual poverty,133 a CFACT 
Campus blog falsely proclaims that there is no scientific 
consensus, “that global warming is man-caused or that 
more affordable energy methods such as nuclear, coal, and 
natural gas play a significant role in climate change.”134 CFACT 
offered up a total $6,000 in prizes to students willing to make 
YouTube videos denying the conclusions of climate science

doom and government restrictions of personal freedom.135

Industries: Secretly Funding the Climate Denial Machine, p. 
12) to conflate clean energy with job loss, promoting “climate -

hydraulic fracturing for natural gas.137 Commonwealth’s Board 
of Directors links them to the Sarah Scaife and Carthage Foundations, through chairman Michael Gleba, and the Philip

The Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) is a free 
market organization with offices in Irvington, New York and 
Atlanta, Georgia that publishes The Freeman: Ideas on 
Liberty , a largely libertarian publication. Skepticism and 
obstructionism regarding global warming are promoted 
both on FEE’s blogs and through The Freeman.  140 In an 
apparent rebuttal to an article in Nature  linking global 
warming to increased extinction rates, The Freeman cites 
the Koch-funded Marshall Institute and the Center for the 
Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, a project of the 
Western Fuels Association (a coal industry front), which has 
received grants from Koch foundations and ExxonMobil.141 
FEE also recycled a list promoted by Senator James Inhofe, 
whose top political contributor is Koch Industries, naming 
400 scientists who supposedly doubt the climate change 
scientific consensus.142 In examination of the authenticity of 
this list, the Daily Green found that of the 400 names, 44 
were TV weathermen, 70 have no background in climate 
science, and 84 were recipients of industry money. FEE staff 
are linked to the Mackinac Institute, Americans for Prosperity

Lobbying and Political Spending
Koch Industries had 30 registered lobbyists in 2010, 25 of 
whom have prior federal experience.148 Notable revolving door 
lobbyists include:
Matthew s chla PP—a lobbyist for Koch through Cove 
Strategies. Schlapp was the executive director of federal 
affairs for Koch Industries’ lobbying subsidiary, Koch Compa -
nies Public Sector, and was a chief of staff to former Kansas 
Republican Representative Todd Tiahrt, a top Koch beneficiary.  
Schlapp worked on the Bush/Cheney 2000 campaign before 
taking a position as the deputy director of political affairs in the 
Bush/Cheney White House. 
The Cove Strategies website notes, “During his tenure at the 
White House, Schlapp advised the President, Vice President, 
the Cabinet, and senior advisors on domestic and political 
issues.”149 Schlapp told congressional investigators that 
during his White House tenure he had “monthly” contact with 
disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff during which they dis -
cussed various subjects, including government business.150Jose Ph stanK o Jr.— a Koch lobbyist through Hunton 
& Williams. Stanko’s other clients include Southern Company, 
Future Energy Holdings, and the Electric Reliability Coordinating 
Council, a utility front group run by Bracewell & Giuliani lobbyists 
Scott Segal and Frank Maisano.151 Stanko was a counsel to the 
U.S. House Energy & Commerce Committee from 1997-2003. 
Stanko specializes in representing industry clients, advocating 
their positions on “global climate change, renewable and bio-
fuels, the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws, energy 
policy and Homeland Security.”152
rayMond Paul—  the director of federal government 
affairs for Koch Companies Public Sector. Paul was a 
legislative assistant to former Democratic Sen. J. Bennett 
Johnston (LA), who helped deregulate the natural gas industry 
and now has his own lobbying firm representing the American 
Petroleum Institute, Constellation Energy, Edison Electric 
Institute and Edison International.153 
alex McGee— a lobbyist for McKenna, Long & Aldridge. 
McGee also represents TransCanada, an oil and gas pipeline 
company with primary business niches in the tar sands of 
Alberta, Canada.154 TransCanada is currently running a large-
scale public relations and lobbying campaign, aided by McGee 
and his firm, to promote the construction of the controversial 
Keystone XL pipeline, the completion of which is in the interest 
of Koch Industries.155

McGee was previously the director of federal affairs for Koch 
Companies Public Sector. McGee joined Koch after five years 
as an official in the Department of Energy, where he was “a 
strategic player in the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 
2005.”156 This law was a blockbuster industry handout, provid-
ing $27 billion to fossil fuel and nuclear energy companies 
compared to $6.4 billion in renewable energy provisions.157 
The 2005 Energy Policy Act also stripped away restrictions 
on offshore drilling, exempted oil and gas companies from 
provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act for hydraulic 
fracturing operations, and paved the way for large mergers of 
public utility companies.158
These lobbyists worked to influence bills regarding a multi -
tude of issues Koch has interest in.159 Some specific  
examples concern:
•	Climate	change	and	greenhouse	gas	reduction.	The 	
Clean	Air	Act	has	been	a	key	target,	specifically 	
to	prevent	lawful	EPA	monitoring	and	regulation 	
of	greenhouse	gases	on	polluting	facilities160	and	
to	declassify	greenhouse	gases	such	as	carbon 	
dioxide	and	methane	as	“air	pollutants.”161
•	Clean	energy	development	and	energy	efficiency.162
•	A	low	carbon	fuel	standard	(LCFS),	which	Koch 	
strongly	opposes.163
•	Chemical	security,	including	the	Chemical	Facility 	
Anti-Terrorism	Act	of	2009	(H.R.2868),	which	Koch 	
Industries	and	its	subsidiaries	oppose	through	the 	
Fertilizer	Institute	and	the	National	Petrochemical 	
Refiners	Association.164	
•	Formaldehyde 	emissions 	standards 	and	health	
affects	of	formaldehyde.165
•	The	Clean	Water	Restoration	Act,	a	measure	to 	
update	and	strengthen	the	1972	Clean	Water	Act.166
•	Oil	industry	subsidies	and	tax	breaks.167
•	Reduction	of	energy	market	manipulation	through 	
excessive 	speculation.168
Additionally, the chairman and CEO of Koch Companies 
Public Sector, the lobbying subsidiary of Koch Industries, 
is Richard Fink.169 Fink has long been a top associate to 
Charles and David Koch and is currently an executive vice 
president and director of Koch Industries, as well as director 
of subsidiaries Flint Hills Resources and Invista.170Fink has ties to numerous climate science denial  
front groups:
•	Co-founder	and	director	of	the	Americans	for 	
Prosperity 	Foundation 	
•	Co-founder	and	director	of	the	Mercatus	Center	at 	
George	Mason	University 	
•	Co-founder	and	former	president	of	Citizens	for	a 	
Sound	Economy,	the	predecessor	to	Americans	for 	
Prosperity	and	FreedomWorks
•	Former	director	of	the	Reason	Foundation
•	Former	director	of	the	Institute	for	Humane	Studies 	
at	George	Mason	University
•	Former	director	of	the	Tax	Foundation
Fink serves as president and director of both the Charles G. 
Koch and Claude R. Lambe charitable foundations, two of 
three Koch foundations that allocate money to groups that 
undermine credible climate science, including the groups  
he directs.171

US’s top oil and gas industry contributor. 172 
From the 2006 election cycle through 2010, Koch spent a total of $7.27 
million, more than any other member of their industry.173 Over $3.4 million 
of this was donated directly to federal candidates.
In 2010, Koch PAC overtook Valero as the biggest oil and gas PAC 
spender since 2006 and continues to outspend PACs of ExxonMobil, 
Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and BP. With revenue notably smaller than oil 
supermajors like ExxonMobil and Chevron, Koch’s investment in political 
expenditures is significant. ExxonMobil’s $310 billion annual income is 
three times that of estimates for Koch Industries.174

Koch’s donations became more polarized  
in favor of the Republican Party in 2010, with 92% of its 
contributions going toward Republican candidates and 
party committees. This divide is greater than any other major 
U.S. oil and gas company.175 Notable party PAC beneficiary

Koch Donations to Freshman Congressional  
Climate Deniers
Of the freshman members of the 112th Congress, the Center 
for American Progress’ Wonk Room identified eleven fresh -
man Senators and 38 freshman House Representatives who 
have publicly questioned the science of climate change.183 Of 
the eleven Senators, ten received funding from Koch Industries 
in 2010, and eight of them signed the Americans for Prosperity 
“No Climate Tax Pledge” to obstruct policy solutions to climate 
change. Of the 38 Representatives, 22 received Koch PAC 
funding in 2010, and all 38 signed the AFP pledge.184
Donation figures obtained from the Center for Responsive 
Politics through OpenSecrets:
Koch PAC contributions to Candidates
Koch PAC contributions to other PACs
Koch Industries invested in numerous U.S. House candidates 
with official endorsements from astroturf tea party groups 
Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks or the Tea Party 
Express. Koch Industries spent at least $424,000 on 76 of 
these House candidates, 68 of which won their elections.185
Koch Industries Influence on State Elections
Koch Industries and its subsidiaries are also active in the state 
political arenas. According to the National Institute on Money 
in State Politics, Koch Industries has spent $2.6 million at the 
state level on direct political contributions from 2005 to 2009.186 
The majority of this money—$1.9 million—was distributed to 
over 1,000 state candidates. Koch favored State-level Republi -
can candidates and committees by 84%.
Results for the Kochs’ 2010 state election donations, as of 
March, 2011, demonstrate over $600,000 in state political 
contributions, over $300,000 of which was spent in Texas 
alone.187 From 2003–2010, Koch Industries has spent $1.89 
million on state-level political contributions.Among top state level donations from Koch Industries in 
the 2010 cycle:188
•	$50,000	from	Koch	Industries	plus	$25,000	from 	
David	Koch	to	Texas	Republican	Governor	Rick

35 Under RGGI, participating states have enacted regulations to cap and then reduce the 
amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that power plants in their region are allowed to emit, limiting the region’s total contribution to atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Power sector CO2 emissions are capped at current levels through 2014. The cap is then lowered by 2.5 percent/year for four years, for a total reduction of 10 percent by 2018.
