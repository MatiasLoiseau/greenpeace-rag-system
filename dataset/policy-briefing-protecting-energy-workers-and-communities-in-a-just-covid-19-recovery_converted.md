Protecting Energy Workers
and Communities in a
Just COVID-19 Recovery

April 2020

Workers in the oil, gas, and coal sectors have been hard-hit by the sharp contraction of the U.S. fossil fuel industry. For
years, oil and gas executives have made risky investments and amassed bad debt to pursue near-limitless expansion.1
Now, the abrupt decline in oil demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the oversupplied global market — the latest
in the industry’s record of extreme boom-and-bust cycles — have exposed the industry’s shaky financial foundation
and already contributed to layoffs and furloughs.2 Energy workers also face longer-term challenges, with the fossil fuel
industry already in decline as the global transition to clean, renewable energy accelerates.

Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic must prioritize the needs of impacted workers, families, and communities,
including low-wage workers, undocumented people, people who are incarcerated, people experiencing homeless,
and Indigenous, Black, and Brown people who are disproportionately harmed by the health and economic crisis.
Greenpeace supports proposals to provide immediate federal relief for all affected workers and families, such as the
Paycheck Guarantee Act and the Essential Workers Bill of Rights.3 Greenpeace also supports demands for long-term
protections and large-scale investments in predominantly low-wealth and Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities
that are disproportionately impacted by toxic pollution, fossil fuel extraction, and the climate crisis,4 such as those
called for in the Equitable and Just Climate Platform.5

Alongside these essential policies, our response to the crises we face must also include immediate relief and long-term
economic security for the energy workers and communities who have powered our society for decades, and who face
unique challenges in the COVID-19 crisis and clean energy transition. Congress should create a national Worker and
Community Protection Fund (WCPF) to support fossil fuel workers, their families, and impacted communities in
the current oil industry contraction and long-term energy transition.

BriefingA federal Worker and Community Protection
Fund would build on historical federal and
state programs.

A WCPF is not a novel concept. Numerous federal and state programs have provided similar investments in worker and
community transition and economic development in the past, including:

	| The Redwood Employee Protection Program (REPP), which offered 6-11 years of wage replacement, benefit

guarantees, and retraining assistance for loggers displaced by the expansion of Redwood National Park in 1978.6

	| The POWER+ Plan launched in 2015 during the Obama Administration, which would unlock federal funding for work-
force and economic development initiatives in distressed coal communities, particularly Appalachia. Elements of the
POWER+ Plan continue today through the Appalachian Regional Commission and Economic Development Agency.7

	| Colorado’s Office of Just Transition, which was created by law in 2019 and tasked with creating a transition plan to

provide benefits to coal and power plant workers and grants coal-dependent communities.8

	| A transition plan for workers at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California, negotiated with the utility, unions, and

environmental groups. The plan includes a retention bonus for workers to remain with the plant through its planned
closure in 2025, and an $85 million state-funded settlement to mitigate economic impacts to affected counties,
municipalities, school districts, and unions.9

	| Community-led efforts to secure funding for economic planning and diversification in Tonawanda, New York, after

the closure of the coal-fired Huntley Generating Station.10

	| The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program, a transition program started in the late 1980s and last

authorized by the Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005.11

What support should the WCPF provide for
workers and communities?

The specific programs and assistance offered to fossil fuel industry workers and communities should be developed
under a principle of “federal dollars, local leadership” — with region-specific approaches built from the ground-up
in deep consultation with impacted workers, community leaders, unions, environmental justice communities, labor,
climate, and environmental policy experts, and other stakeholders. In general, the WCPF should:

For workers:

	| Guarantee fully-funded pension and healthcare benefits to fulfill and supplement employer-provided plans for

workers who choose to retire;

	| Provide several years of wage replacement or wage gap insurance and full benefit guarantees for displaced workers,

with no means testing and regardless of if they find new employment;

Briefing	| Offer workforce development opportunities and guaranteed employment, including apprenticeship, pre-
apprenticeship, and job retraining programs to assist displaced workers in obtaining the skills needed for
new employment, priority job placement and guaranteed employment, and 100 percent wage replacement
during retraining;12

	| Provide relocation assistance and housing support for displaced workers who need it; and

	| Provide targeted workforce development and transition assistance for women, workers who are Black, Indigenous,
and people of color, veterans, people who are formerly incarcerated, and other historically marginalized workers
in order to address historic racial and economic disparities and exclusion of people from certain sectors of the
labor market due to race, gender, and other protected classes.13

For communities:14

	| Provide federal assistance to states and local communities to replace lost tax revenue and other funding for

schools, libraries, fire departments, clinics, and other community and public services;15

	| Create a “RePower Program” to support targeted economic development and diversification initiatives to enable
new industries and businesses to thrive, prioritizing community hires, requiring or incentivizing strong worker
protections, and where applicable, prioritizing development of industries that can utilize or repurpose existing
energy and transportation infrastructure;16 and

	| Create a dedicated “Community Restoration Program” to support clean-up, reclamation, and restoration projects

in communities where mining, drilling, fracking, and other fossil fuel extraction practices have damaged or polluted
local ecosystems, lands, and waterways, prioritizing community hires and requiring or incentivizing strong worker
protections (see below).17

How should the WCPF protect workers’ rights
and ensure fair treatment?

All jobs and projects supported or created by the federal government through the WCPF should be required or
incentivized to uphold high-road labor standards, prioritize local hires for workers in transition, and protect the
right of workers to organize:

	| Ensure workers are paid livable wages of at least $15 per hour, at or above prevailing wages;18

12  New employment need not be limited to renewable energy industries, but should also include employment in sectors related to “climate

protection” and other industries. “Climate protection” here refers to industries that support the shift to a low-carbon economy, including energy
efficiency and weatherization, zero-carbon building construction, low-carbon manufacturing, climate resilience and adaptation, well and mine
clean up and remediation, sustainable agriculture, and “caring economy” and public service sectors such as healthcare, teaching, public transit,
and service industries that contribute relatively little to greenhouse gas emissions.

13  The vast majority of fossil fuel workers are white and male, but nobody should be left behind in the transition. The government should ensure
transition programs recognize and address historic disparities and barriers for women and people of color in the workplace and public sphere.
https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm

14  To emphasize: these recommendations for community investment focus specifically on communities impacted by the decline and transition

away from fossil fuel production. A fully just transition to a clean energy economy and stable climate must also include targeted investments in
historically marginalized communities, including Black, Brown, Indigenous, and low-wealth communities, at the frontlines of pollution and the
climate crisis.

Briefing	| Protect workers’ right to organize under the National Labor Relations Act by requiring or incentivizing neutrality, first
contract arbitration, and commitments that no firms receiving federal funding can hire anti-union consultants or
engage in anti-union campaigns;

	| Implement hiring and procurement policies that benefit people of color, low-wealth communities, women, people
who are undocumented, veterans, people who are or were formerly incarcerated, and other people historically
disadvantaged in the workforce;

	| Require or incentivize (e.g., through conditions on use of federal funds) fulfillment of project labor agreements,

community benefit agreements, and/or local hire agreements to ensure fair treatment of workers, where available
by law;

	| Ensure that federal procurement follows: “Buy Clean” standards to prioritize use of the most efficient, resilient, and
cleanest materials and products with the lowest carbon and toxicity footprints;19 “Buy Fair” standards to enhance
labor standards, workers’ rights, career pathways, equity, and benefits for workers and communities throughout the
supply chain, particularly those who are historically disadvantaged; and strengthened “Buy Domestic” standards to
promote high-quality, good-paying U.S. jobs; and

	| Ensure full healthcare, paid leave, and other benefits, strong health and safety standards, and other critical

worker protections.

How should the WCPF be structured?

Coverage: The WCPF should cover all workers in coal, oil, and gas production, refining, distribution, power
production, and other associated sectors, along with their families. The Fund should focus on all communities whose
local economies are especially reliant on activity in these same sectors, or that are overburdened by pollution or
environmental degradation from fossil fuel extraction and combustion.20

Administration: The WCPF should be administered by a new, independent “Clean Energy Progress Administration”
(CEPA).21 The agency should be grounded with meaningful engagement with affected workers, labor unions, state and
local governments, climate scientists, environmental justice advocates, impacted community representatives, and
other key stakeholders.22 The agency should follow a principle of “federal dollars, local leadership” by working with
local stakeholders and regional offices to efficiently deploy federal funding, adhere to strong worker, climate, and
environmental justice standards, and meet local circumstances and needs.

Funding: The WCPF could be capitalized with federal crisis recovery appropriations, then continually funded with fees
collected from fossil fuel companies and a backstop of mandatory federal appropriations to make the Fund whole.23
Critical reforms to bankruptcy and self-bonding practices should be made to ensure companies cannot evade their

19  https://www.bluegreenalliance.org/work-issue/buy-clean/
20  Eligible communities could be identified with a comprehensive, interactive, and transparent mapping tool developed in consultation with
affected communities and stakeholders. While there are limited examples of such analysis, this tool could build upon the Environmental
Protection Agency’s EJ SCREEN tool (https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen), FracTracker Alliance maps (https://www.fractracker.org/map/national/),
U.S. Energy Information Administration data (https://www.eia.gov/maps/maps.htm), American Geosciences Institute tools (https://www.
americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/maps/interactive-map-coal-resources-united-states), and the Environmental Defense Fund’s federal
methane map (http://www.edf.org/federalmethanemap/).

21  The CEPA could also oversee broader strategies to manage a just and equitable phaseout of fossil fuel production, including bringing declining

fossil fuel companies under public ownership. http://priceofoil.org/2020/04/14/case-for-public-ownership-fossil-fuel-industry/

22  A consultative body with relevant stakeholders could look to the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC) as a prototype model.
Such consultation should be comprehensive, meaningful, and impactful — environmental justice advocates and even presidential candidates
(such as Senator Elizabeth Warren) have noted that NEJAC’s consultative power is limited, and called for the body to be strengthened and
elevated to directly advise the White House. https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/national-environmental-justice-advisory-council;

23  The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is funded in this way, with a combination of excise taxes on coal companies and general appropriations.

However, Congress should ensure that a WCPF does not face the same financial strain and insolvency issues. See: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/

Briefingobligations to workers, communities, and the environment.24 Congress should eliminate the roughly $15 billion per
year in federal fossil fuel subsidies and redirect federal resources to support workers through the WCPF.25 Liability for
fossil fuel companies must not be waived.

How much would the WCPF cost?

We estimate the cost to support displaced workers with 3 years of compensation insurance (wages plus benefits), job
retraining costs (plus compensation support while retraining), and relocation assistance could range from $1.9 billion to
$2.9 billion per year.26

Notably, this is only part of the cost of fully implementing the WCPF as described above. Additional funding is needed
to fulfill pensions for impacted workers, provide tax base replacement and other support for affected communities, and
invest in environmental remediation, economic development, and diversification programs.

Funds should be appropriated to undertake a full and detailed analysis of the costs associated with the WCPF.

24  Coal companies have manipulated self-bonding practices and bankruptcy proceedings for years to avoid meeting pension, benefit, and

environmental cleanup obligations. Congress should end self-bonding (see H.R. 4435, the “Coal Cleanup Taxpayer Protection Act of 2019”)
and reform bankruptcy laws to prevent fossil fuel companies from discharging federal regulatory obligations to workers and communities.

25  http://priceofoil.org/2017/10/03/dirty-energy-dominance-us-subsidies/
26  Our national cost estimate for compensation insurance, job retraining, and relocation assistance builds on analysis of the costs of a climate-safe
energy transformation in the state of Colorado, conducted for a coalition of unions by economists affiliated with the Political Economy Research
Institute at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (PERI). That report detailed a suite of policies to support displaced workers as described
above. Under some conservative assumptions, the cost of those policies averages $78,000 per displaced worker per year. Nationally, around
1.6 million workers were employed by the coal, gas, and petroleum industries in 2018 (U.S. Energy and Employment Report 2019. https://www.
usenergyjobs.org/2019-report; see Tables 39, 40, and 41, which summarize jobs across the natural gas, coal, and petroleum industries). Following
the methodology and assumptions around fossil fuel industry contraction through 2030 and the natural rate of worker retirements outlined in
Pollin, et. al. (A Green Growth Program for Colorado, 2019, https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/1168-a-green-growth-program-for-
colorado) (assuming: national fossil fuel jobs in 2020 are the same as reported in the 2018 USEER report; a smooth annual contraction from 2020
to 2030 targeting 70% contraction of coal and a 40% contraction of oil and gas; a range of 20% to 30% of current workers reaching retirement
age in that time period with 85% choosing to retire; and 85% of displaced workers are non-managers requiring re-employment assistance), we
estimate that nationally 25,000 to 37,000 fossil fuel workers would need transition assistance every year.
