Energy is fundamental  to economic and social development, both North and
South. Yet, at the dawn of the 21st century, we are confronted with the unacceptablefact that there are nearly 2 billion people without access to basic energy services. Atthe same time, we are facing the greatest threat to our collective survival because of
our unsustainable use of energy: global climate change.  
Wind Force 12 gives us a glimpse of the solution – how we can begin to meet
our present needs without compromising the needs of future generations. Wind energy is the first of the ‘new renewable’ technologies to have penetrated the energymarkets in some parts of the developed world in a serious way with the right kind ofpolicy support. The wind industry can lead the way for other renewable energy technologies: as it matures and penetrates markets world wide it drives costs downwhich will make this technology competitive worldwide including developing countries.
The energy choices the world makes in the next few years will determine our
collective development path for many decades to come. Shall we choose to continueto go down the ‘conventional’ energy development path, using fossil fuels, nuclear andother 19th and 20th century technologies? Or shall we choose now to pursue a truly sustainable development path both North and South based on efficient use of sustain able,
clean renewable energy, building new industries and creating millions of new jobs?  
How to meet the challenge of climate change, and how to provide clean,
affordable energy to the world’s poorest are issues which are debated in many fora,but none this year will be more important than Renewables 2004 to be held in Bonn,
Germany from June 1-4. Seeking to galvanize the support for action to fight climatechange and poverty at the Johannesburg Earth Summit into concrete action, manynations are expected to heed German Chancellor Schroeder’s call to bring their concreteplans and commitments to Bonn this spring. See you there!

6 WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
This latest edition of Wind Force 12 demonstrates that there are no technical,
economic or resource barriers to supplying 12% of the world's electricity needs withwind power alone by 2020 - and this against the challenging backdrop of a projectedtwo thirds increase of electricity demand by that date. 
The wind industry we have today is capable of becoming a dynamic, innovative
e80 billion annual business by 2020, able to satisfy global energy demands and unlock
a new era of economic growth, technological progress and environmental protection.Wind energy is a significant and powerful resource. It is safe, clean, abundant and limit-less and provides an endless, secure energy supply. The wind industry is the world's bestopportunity to begin the transition to a global economy based on sustainable energy.   
Wind power has come a long way since the prototypes of just 20 years ago.
Two decades of technological progress have resulted in today's wind turbines beingstate-of-the-art modern technology - modular and rapid to install. A single wind turbineis 100 times more powerful than its equivalent two decades ago. 
Unlike some other ‘solutions’ to clean energy and climate protection, wind
power does not need to be invented, nor is there need to wait for any magical 'break-through'; it is ready for global implementation now. Modern wind farms provide bulkpower equivalent to conventional power stations. In the future, this blueprint will seethe boundaries of technological progress pushed further to bring far greater benefits.
In 2003 more than 8,000 Megawatts of wind power was installed worldwide,
valued at 
e8 billion and generating enough electricity to power the equivalent of 
19 million average European homes. But as outlined in the opening chapters of thisreport, the success of the industry to date has been largely created by the efforts ofa handful of countries, led by Germany, Spain, and Denmark. It is obvious that if othercountries matched these efforts, the impact would be far greater.
The fact that just three countries have created the bulk of the progress to
date underlines the fact that today's technology is merely the tip of the iceberg, anda huge potential remains untapped. Wind power is capable of continuing its successfulhistory over the next two decades if a positive political and regulatory framework isIntroduction

implemented, one that removes the obstacles and market distortions that currently con-
strain the industry’s real potential. 
This year’s international conference “Renewables 2004” in Bonn, Germany
charts the way towards an expansion of renewable energy worldwide, responding to thecall from the 2002 Johannesburg summit and maintaining the momentum generatedby the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition. The European Union is playing animportant role in this process, with the European regional renewables conference, heldin Berlin in January 2004, agreeing that “A target value of at least 20% of gross inland
energy consumption by 2020 for the EU is achievable.” This target could be even higher
if coupled with stronger energy efficiency policies. 
Targets for renewables act as a catalyst for governments to develop the nec-
essary framework conditions for investment in renewable energy technologies. A power-ful example is the EU Directive on the Promotion of Electricity from Renewable EnergySources, which sets national indicative targets for all EU Member States. These targetshave initiated action throughout the entire European Union to put in place framework con-ditions for renewables. But although targets are an important first step in developing theclean energy sources of tomorrow that will contribute substantially to climate protection,they must be followed by concrete political action. Wind Force 12 is a political blueprint
for action that governments can implement, and shows what is possible with just onerenewable technology. 
The message from this report is clear. Wind power is world scale; it has the
capacity to satisfy the energy and development needs of the world without destroyingit; and it will play a key role in our future sustainable energy supply.

“THIS STUDY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE ARE NO TECHNOLOGICAL,
COMMERCIAL OR RESOURCE LIMITS CONSTRAINING THE WORLD FROM MEETING12% OF FUTURE GLOBAL ELECTRICITY DEMAND FROM WIND POWER  IN LESSTHAN TWO DECADES”

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
9Wind Force 12 is a feasibility study into the potential for wind energy to supply 12% of the
world’s electricity by 2020. It concludes that there are no practical constraints to this level ofexpansion, but that a series of national and international policy shifts are required for itsachievement. In the process, a capacity level of 1,200 GW of wind power would be installed,over 2 million jobs created and more than 10,700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide saved fromcontributing to climate change. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYWINDFORCE12

10
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Methodology
The aim of this study is to assess whether it is feasible
for wind power to achieve a penetration equal to 12%of global electricity demand by 2020. In the process,a number of technical, economic and resource implications have had to be examined.
The main inputs to this study have been:
An assessment of the world’s wind resources andtheir geographical distribution.The level of electricity output required and whetherthis can be accommodated in the grid system.The current status of the wind energy market and itspotential growth rate.Analysis of wind energy technology and its cost profile.A comparison with other emerging technologies using“learning curve theory”.
This is the fifth version of a study originally published in
1999 as Wind Force 10. This was subsequently trans-formed into Wind Force 12, first published in 2002. Likeits predecessors it is not a forecast but a feasibility studywhose implementation will depend on decisions taken bygovernments around the world.
The global status of wind power
Since the original report was published, wind power hasmaintained its status as the world’s fastest growing energysource. Installed capacity has continued to grow at anannual rate in excess of 30%. During 2003 alone, morethan 8,300 MW of new capacity was added to the electricitygrid. This investment was worth more than 
e8 billion.
By the beginning of 2004, global wind power installations
had reached a level of 40,300 MW. This provides enoughpower to satisfy the needs of around 19 million averageEuropean households, close to 47 million people.Although Europe accounts for 73% of this capacity, otherregions are beginning to emerge as substantial markets.Over 50 countries around the world now contribute to theglobal total, whilst the number of people employed by theindustry is estimated to be around 90-100,000. The impetus behind wind power expansion has come
increasingly from the urgent need to combat global climatechange. Wind energy offers both a power source whichcompletely avoids the emission of carbon dioxide, themain greenhouse gas, but also produces none of theother pollutants associated with either fossil fuel ornuclear generation. 
Starting from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a series of greenhouse
gas reduction targets has cascaded down to a regionaland national level. These in turn have been translated intotargets for increasing the proportion of renewable energy,including wind.
In order to achieve these targets, countries in both Europe
and elsewhere have adopted a variety of market supportmechanisms. These range from premium payments perunit of output to more complex mechanisms based on anobligation on power suppliers to source a rising percent-age of their supply from renewables.
As the market has grown, wind power has shown a 
dramatic fall in cost. Production costs have fallen by up to 50% over 15 years. 
At optimum sites, wind  can be competitive with new coal-
fired plants and in some locations can challenge gas.Individual wind turbines have also increased in capacity,with the largest commercial machines now reaching3,600 kW and prototypes being built of up to 5,000 kW.The average capacity of wind turbines installed worldwideduring 2003 increased to 1,200 kW. 
The booming wind energy business has attracted the 
serious attention of the banking and investment market,with new players such as oil and power companies enteringthe market.
Important “success stories” for wind energy can be seen
in the experiences of Germany, Spain and Denmark inEurope, the United States in the Americas and Indiaamong the countries of the developing world. A new mar-ket sector is about to emerge offshore, with many thou-sands of megawatts of wind farms proposed in the seasaround Northern Europe.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
11The world’s wind resources and demand
for electricity
A number of assessments confirm that the world’s wind
resources are extremely large and well distributedacross almost all regions and countries. The total available resource that is technically recoverable is estimated to be 53,000 Terawatt hours (TWh)/year. Thisis over twice as large as the projection for the world’sentire electricity demand in 2020. Lack of resource istherefore unlikely ever to be a limiting factor in the utilisation of wind power for electricity generation.
When more detailed assessments are carried out for a
specific country, they also tend to reveal a much higherpotential for wind power than a general study suggests. InGermany, for example, the Ministry of Economic Affairshas shown that the potential is five times higher than indi-cated in a 1993 study of OECD countries. Across Europethere is ample scope to meet at least 20% of electricitydemand by 2020, especially if the new offshore market istaken into account.
Future electricity demand is assessed regularly by the
International Energy Agency. The IEA’s 2002 World EnergyOutlook assessment shows that by 2020, total worlddemand will reach 25,578 TWh. For wind power to meet12% of global consumption it will therefore need to gen-erate an output in the range of 3,000 TWh/year by 2020.
There are no substantial obstacles to the integration of
these increased quantities of wind power into the electricitygrid. In Denmark, peak levels often account for more than50% of consumption in the western part of the country during very windy periods. The cautious assumption adoptedhere is that a 20% penetration limit is easily attainable.
12% of the world’s electricity from wind
power
On the basis of recent trends, it is feasible that wind power
can be expected to grow at an average rate for new annualinstallations of 25% per annum over the next seven years.This is the highest growth rate during the timescale of thestudy, ending up with a total of 197,500 MW of capacityon line by the end of 2010.


12
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004From 2011 to 2014, the growth rate falls to 20% per
annum, resulting in 453,800 MW of installed capacity bythe end of 2014. After that the annual growth rate falls to15%, and then to 10% in 2019, although by this time theexpansion of wind power will be taking place at a muchhigher level of annual installation.
By the end of 2020, the scenario shows that wind
power will have achieved a global installed capacity ofover 1.2 million MW. This represents an output of3,000 TWh, a penetration level equivalent to 12% ofthe world’s electricity demand.
From 2020 onwards the annual installation rate will level
out at 158,700 MW per annum. This means that by 2040,wind energy’s global total will have reached over 3,200 GW,which by then will represent about 23% of the world’s con-sumption.
The 12% scenario has also been broken down by regions
of the world. The OECD countries are expected to take thelead in implementation, especially Europe and NorthAmerica, but other regions such as China will also makea major contribution.
The choice of parameters and assumptions underlying
this scenario has been based on historical experiencefrom both the wind power industry and from other energytechnologies. The main assumptions are:
Annual growth rates: Growth rates of 20-25% are high
for an industry manufacturing heavy equipment, butthe wind industry has experienced far higher rates dur-ing its initial phase of industrialisation. Over the lastfive years the average annual growth rate of cumula-tive turbines installed has been almost 32%. After2015, the scenario growth rate falls to 15% and thento 10% in 2019. In Europe, an important factor will bethe opening up of the offshore wind market. As far asdeveloping countries are concerned, a clear messagefrom the industry is that it would like to see a stablepolitical framework established in emerging markets ifthis expansion is to be achieved.Progress ratios: Industrial learning curve theory sug-
gests that costs decrease by some 20% each time thenumber of units produced doubles. The progressratios assumed in this study start at 0.85 up until2010. After that the ratio is reduced to 0.90 and thento 1.0 in 2026.Growth of wind turbine size: The average size of new
turbines being installed is expected to grow over thenext decade from today’s figure of 1,200 kW (1.2 MW)to 1.5 MW in 2007 and 2.0 MW in 2013. Larger tur-bine sizes reduce the number of machines required.Comparisons with other technologies: Both nuclear
power and large scale hydro are energy technologieswhich have achieved substantial levels of penetrationin a relatively short timescale. Nuclear has now

13reached a level of 17.1% globally and large hydro
16.6%. Wind energy is today a commercial industrywhich is capable of becoming a mainstream powerproducer. The time horizon of the 12% scenario istherefore consistent with the historical development ofthese two technologies.
12% wind power by 2020
investment, costs and employment
The annual investment required to achieve the 
deployment of wind energy outlined above starts at 
e8.2 billion in 2004 and increases to a peak 
of e82.7 billion by 2019. 
The total investment needed to reach a level of almost
1,200 GW of capacity by 2020 is estimated at e 692 billion
over the whole period. This is a very large figure, but it canbe compared with the annual investment in the power sec-tor during the 1990s of some 
e158-186 billion. The
future investment required globally has also been brokendown on a regional basis.
The cost per unit of wind-powered electricity has already
reduced dramatically as manufacturing and other costshave fallen. This study starts from the basis that a “stateof the art” wind turbine in 2003 in the most optimal con-ditions had an investment cost of 
e804 per installed kW
and a unit cost for its output of 3.79 e cents/kWh.


Using the progress assumptions already discussed, and
taking into account improvements both in the average sizeof turbines and in their capacity factor, the cost per kilo-watt hour of installed wind capacity is expected to havefallen to 3.03 
e cents/kWh by 2010, assuming a cost per
installed kilowatt of e644. By 2020 it is expected to
have reduced to 2.45 e cents/kWh, with an installation
cost of e512/kW - a substantial reduction of 36% com-
pared with 2003.Wind energy costs are also expected to look increasingly
attractive when compared with other power technologies.The employment effect of the 12% wind energy scenariois a crucial factor to weigh alongside its other costs andbenefits. A total of 2.3 million jobs will have been createdaround the world by 2020 in manufacture, installation andother work associated with the industry. This total is alsobroken down by region of the world.
12% wind power by 2020
the environmental benefits
A reduction in the levels of carbon dioxide being emitted
into the world’s atmosphere is the most important envi-ronmental benefit from wind power generation. Carbondioxide is the gas largely responsible for exacerbating thegreenhouse effect, leading to the disastrous conse-quences of global climate change.
On the assumption that the average value for carbon dioxide
saved by switching to wind power is 600 tonnes per GWh,the annual saving under this scenario will be 1,832 milliontonnes of CO
2by 2020 and 5,106 million tonnes by 2040. 
The cumulative savings would be 10,771 million tonnes
of CO2by 2020 and 88,857 million tonnes by 2040.
If the external costs, including environmental damage,
caused by different fuels used for electricity generationwere given a monetary value, then wind power wouldeither benefit from a reduction in price or the cost of otherfuels would increase substantially.
Policy recommendations
This study clearly demonstrates that there are no techno-logical, commercial or resource limits constraining theworld from meeting 12% of future global electricitydemand from wind power in less than two decades.Without political support, however, wind power remains ata competitive disadvantage. Distortions in the world’selectricity markets - created by decades of massive finan-cial, political and structural support to conventional tech-nologies - are coupled with the fact that new wind powerEXECUTIVE SUMMARY

15plants have to compete with existing nuclear and fossil
fuel power stations producing electricity at marginal costs- because their interest and depreciation have alreadybeen paid for by consumers and taxpayers. In order tofully enjoy the economic and environmental benefits ofwind energy, action is needed to overcome those distor-tions and create a level playing field.
Recognising that renewable energy sources, including
wind power, can contribute to sustainable economicgrowth, reduce fuel imports, provide high quality jobs andhelp achieve the Kyoto Protocol commitments to reducegreenhouse gas emissions, a number of initiatives havealready been taken. Within the European Union, indicativetargets have been set for each member state in con-tributing to a doubling of the overall contribution fromrenewables to 22% of electricity supply by 2010. Thesetargets need to be made legally binding.
Encouraged by such targets, economic measures have
been introduced in some countries to encourage invest-ment in renewable energy technology. 
The two main types of incentive have been:
Fixed Price Systems , where the government sets the
electricity price or premiums paid to the producer andlets the market determine the quantity.Renewable Quota Systems (in the USA referred to as
Renewable Portfolio Standards), where the govern-ment sets the quantity of renewable electricity andleaves it to the market to determine the price.
In addition to these financial measures, a successful poli-
cy for promoting wind power should include regulation ongrid access and streamlining of administrative procedures. 
Other factors which need to be considered when encour-
aging further development of renewable energy include astable environment for the investment community, theremoval of barriers to the development of renewables(such as planning and grid connection issues), the endingof subsidies to both fossil fuels and nuclear power andthe internalising of the social and environmental costsassociated with polluting energy sources.A number of specific recommendations are made in pur-
suit of these objectives:
National Policies
Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy;Provide defined and stable returns for investors;Introduce electricity market reforms, including theremoval of electricity sector barriers to renewablesand market distortions;Halt subsidies to fossil fuel and nuclear powersources;Internalise the social and environmental costs of pol-luting energy.
International Policies
Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol;Reform of Export Credit Agencies, MultilateralDevelopment Banks and International FinanceInstitutions; A defined and increasing percentage of overall energysector lending directed to renewable energy projects;A rapid phase out of support for conventional, pollut-ing energy projects.

“WIND FORCE 12 IS NOT A FORECAST OR PREDICTION; 
IT IS A FEASIBILITY STUDY BASED ON INDUSTRIAL EXPERIENCE,THAT WILL BE DETERMINED BY POLITICAL DECISIONS. ”

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
17The aim of this study is to assess whether it is feasible for wind power to achieve a penetration
equal to 12% of global electricity demand by 2020. The main inputs have been an assessmentof the world’s wind resources, the level of electricity output required, the current status of thewind energy market, an analysis of current technology and its cost profile and a comparisonwith other emerging technologies.1 - METHODOLOGYWINDFORCE12

18
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004The central analysis in this report has been carried out by
BTM Consult, an independent Danish consultancy spe-cialising in wind energy.
The aim of the study has been to assess the technical,
economic and resource implications for a penetrationof wind power into the global electricity system equalto 12% of total future demand within two decades, andwhether a 12% penetration is possible within thattimescale.
The methodology used in this study explores the following
sequence of questions:
Are the world’s wind resources large enough andappropriately distributed geographically to achieve alevel of 12% penetration?What level of electricity output will be required and canthis be accommodated in the existing grid system?Is wind power technology sufficiently developed tomeet this challenge? What is its technical and costprofile?With the current status of the wind power industry, isit feasible to satisfy a substantially enlarged demand,and what growth rates will be required?
This is the fifth edition of this report. An initial study was
carried out by BTM Consult for the Danish Forum for Energy& Development (FED) in 1998. This was the model for amore detailed analysis released in 1999 by FED,Greenpeace and the European Wind Energy Association,entitled “Wind Force 10”. An updated report, “Wind Force12”, was first published in 2002 by EWEA and Greenpeace.
The original 1998 study approached the potential for 10%
wind penetration by working with two different scenariosfor world electricity demand. In the more detailed WindForce10 report (1999) only one parameter of future elec-tricity demand was used – the International EnergyAgency’s 1998 “World Energy Outlook”, a conservative pro-jection which assumes “business as usual” and in whichelectricity consumption is predicted to double by 2020.
For consistency, the market data are those produced byBTM Consult, which sometimes differ slightly in the totalsfor individual countries from the  industry statistics pub-lished annually by EWEA.
Since 1999 a number of factors have prompted changes
in successive editions. Firstly, the IEA’s 2000 WorldEnergy Outlook produced a forecast for future global elec-tricity demand that was slightly lower than in 1998/9,enabling the percentage of wind power’s contribution toworld electricity to rise. Secondly, wind industry growthrates have turned out in practice well above those in theoriginal Wind Force 10 report. This in turn made it possi-ble for the annual growth rates projected for the period2004 to 2015 to be substantially reduced, making thescenario more conservative. All these factors made it pos-sible to project a 12% contribution from wind power toglobal electricity demand by 2020.
This present version of Wind Force 12 has involved a lim-
ited number of fresh adjustments. Firstly, the initial annu-al market growth rate of 25% has been extended by twoyears to 2010. The subsequent period of 15% growththen shifts forward one year to end in 2018. The chosengrowth rates in this report are still more moderate thanthose actually recorded in the market over the last fiveyears - an average growth of about 26% per annum. 
Secondly, the average size of individual wind turbines pro-
jected to be installed has been increased to 1.3 MW in2004, 1.4 MW in 2005, 1.5 MW in 2007 and 2.0 MW in2013. This reflects the rapid recent upscaling in the actu-al market, partly but not only driven by the expected devel-opments offshore. 
Finally, the reference projection for global electricity
demand - the latest IEA World Energy Outlook report(2002) – is the same as that used for the 2003 edition.This shows projected demand by 2020 at a similar levelto WEO 2000 (25,579 TWh compared to 25,818 TWh) 
In the assessment of the distribution of new wind power
capacity by world region, the take-off for large scale devel-opment has been delayed by a few years in some conti-nents. Even with a favourable market framework in place, 1 - METHODOLOGY
For wind power to achieve 12% penetration by 2020, a manufacturing capacity of more than 158,000 MW/year must be established – nineteen times that of 2003. 

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
19areas such as East Asia, China and the Transition
Economies will not be able to achieve a high level of annu-al installation before 2006 and 2008.
This report also compares the development of wind power
technology to that of other emerging technologies byusing so-called “learning curve theory”. Because of itsmodular nature, wind power can benefit significantly fromsuch learning curve effects. This means that a high initialpenetration level can contribute to technological and eco-nomic progress, in turn justifying an expectation of furtherprogress and enabling a very high level of development.For this reason the penetration curve has been extendedto 2040 and beyond, by which time a saturation level willhave been achieved.
For wind power to achieve 12% penetration by 2020, a
manufacturing capacity of more than 158,000 MW/yearmust be established – nineteen times that of 2003. If thislevel of output were maintained beyond 2020 it wouldopen up the potential for an even higher penetration by2040. By that time 3,000 GW of wind turbines would bein operation.Penetration of wind power beyond 2020 has not been
assessed in detail in terms of implementation con-straints. However, if wind power can fulfil the requirementsof this scenario up to 2020, it is likely that developmentwill continue.
Finally, it has to be emphasised that the BTM Consult
analysis is not a long-term forecast. Nor is it a prediction, as the study is rooted in the real worldexperience and development of the wind industrytoday. It is a feasibility study taking into account theessential physical limitations facing large-scale development of wind power. 
This study also assesses and compares actual industrial
growth patterns seen in the sector so far with those inother energy technology areas. Over the past half century,generation technologies such as large scale hydro andnuclear power have achieved a high penetration in a rela-tively short timescale. There is no evidence to suggestthat the same cannot be achieved by wind power. Theactual pattern of wind power development, however, willbe determined by political initiatives taken at a regional,national and global level.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Market results and scenario predictions 
As this is the fifth version of the scenario, it is useful to
make a comparison between their predictions and actualmarket results over the period 1999-2003, as well as see-ing how the scenarios have varied in their expectation forthe coming decade.
The two figures illustrate the changing scenario results
over time compared to market reality. In the first fouryears, the market results outstripped the scenario fore-casts. In 2003, for the first time, market results werelower than the scenario figures, a trend that is set to con-tinue in the absence of stronger policy intervention. The comparison of the EWEA conventional scenario versusWind Force 12 for the years 2004-2010 indicates the sizeof that gap. 1 - METHODOLOGY

cumulative rate of 32%. By the end of 2003 the worldwide total had reached over 40,300 MW,enough to supply the electricity needs of 19 million average European households. Globalemployment in the industry has reached a level of an estimated 90-100,000 people. 2 - THE GLOBAL STATUS OF WIND POWERWINDFORCE12

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Over the past five years, global wind power capacity
has continued to grow at an average cumulative rate ofalmost 32% (Figure 2.1). The increase in year-on-yearinstallations has been an average of 26%. During 2003alone, over 8,300 MW of new capacity was added to the electricity grid worldwide. The value of thisinvestment was 
e8 billion.
By the end of 2003, the capacity of wind turbines installed
globally had reached a level of over 40,300 MW. This isenough power to satisfy the needs of more than 19 mil-lion average European households, close to 47 millionpeople. Europe accounts for 73% of this capacity, and for66% of the growth during 2003. But other regions arebeginning to emerge as substantial markets for the windindustry. Over 50 countries around the world now con-tribute to the global total, and the number of peopleemployed by the industry worldwide is estimated to be 90-100,000, with 70-80,000 of these in Europe.
Worldwide markets
Within Europe, Germany is the clear market leader.During 2003, German wind capacity grew by 2,674 MW, taking the country’s total up to more than14,600 MW. In a normal wind year, this would provideenough power to meet 5.9% of national electricitydemand.
Denmark and Spain have also continued to expand, the
latter by almost 1,400 MW during 2003. On current form,the Spanish wind industry will continue to pursueGermany for the European crown. Denmark has mean-while succeeded in being able to satisfy 20% of its elec-tricity demand from the wind, the highest contribution ofany country in the world.
Eight other members of the European Union – Austria,
France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Swedenand the UK – now each have more than 200 MW installed,
and have all effectively reached the take-off stage. Italy and the Netherlands have both pushed through the 900 MW barrier.
In the Americas, the United States market has experi-
enced a major revival, although still handicapped by lackof continuity in federal policies. In a volatile power market,large utilities are increasingly looking to wind power as asource of low-priced, stable electricity. Total US capacityhas now reached 6,361 MW.
Canada, with one of the largest wind resources in the
world, is ready to expand well beyond its present level of317 MW after the introduction of a production tax creditsimilar to that operating in the US. In South America, anurgent need for new power capacity has prompted theBrazilian government to launch a programme with a targetfor 1,000 MW of wind capacity. Argentina’s vast potentialis waiting for similar stimulation. Spanish companies leadthose providing the development expertise.
New markets are also opening up in other continents.
Australia almost doubled its capacity in 2003 to reach 239MW, and with a further 1,700 MW in the pipeline. In Asia,the Indian market has revived after a quiet period in the late1990s, pushing beyond 2,000 MW by the end of 2003.China is looking to increase its capacity to 1,200 MW by2005, whilst Japan continues to steadily expand. InAfrica, both Egypt and Morocco have shown what is pos-sible with national planning and the backing of Europeandevelopers. Morocco already gets 2% of its electricity froma 50 MW wind farm and has plans for a further 460 MW.2 - THE GLOBAL STATUS OF WIND POWER
By the end of 2003, the capacity of wind turbines installed globally had reached a levelof over 40,300 MW. This is enough power tosatisfy the needs of more than 19 million average European households.

27Climate change imperative
The impetus behind wind power expansion has come
increasingly from the urgent need to combat global cli-mate change. The UN-Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange projects that average temperatures around theworld will increase by up to 5.8ºC over the next century,bringing flooding, droughts and violent climate swings inits wake. 
Wind power and other renewable energy technologies gen-
erate electricity without producing the pollutants associat-ed with fossil fuels and nuclear power generation, and emitno carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas.Starting from the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which called for aglobal cut of 5.2% from 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012, a series of greenhouse gas reduction targets hascascaded down to regional and national levels. These inturn have been translated into targets for introducing anincreasing proportion of renewables into the supply mix. 
The EU 15 have an overall target for 22% of their 
electricity to come from renewables by 2010,an increase from a baseline of 14% in 1997. The 10 Accession countries have a target of 11% by 2010 compared to 5.6% in 2000.
In order to achieve these targets, countries in Europe and
elsewhere have adopted a variety of market supportmechanisms. These range from simple premium pay-ments per unit of electricity produced by renewable powerplants to more complex mechanisms which place an obli-gation on power suppliers to source a rising percentage oftheir supply from renewables.
The argument behind these mechanisms is two-fold.
Firstly, there is the need to stimulate a market to the pointwhere a substantial industry can been established.Secondly, there is the historic distortion of the market infavour of both fossil fuels and nuclear. 
Nuclear power continues to take a significant share of
energy research funding in both the US and Europe. At thesame time, the generation costs of “conventional” fuelstake no account of their external environmental, healthand social costs. Alongside the competitive liberalisationof energy markets around the world, these distortions
make it difficult for new technologies to gain a foothold.
In the developing world, by contrast, wind power is attrac-
tive as a means of providing a cheap and flexible electric-ity supply to often isolated communities, whether or not itis supported by an environmental premium. Over the com-ing decades, the majority of demand for new power willcome from the developing world; wind power offers anopportunity to provide large quantities of grid-connectedelectricity, leap-frogging dirty technology to aid cleanindustrial development.
Falling costs
As the market has grown, wind power has shown a dramat-ic fall in cost. The average cost of production from a coastalturbine has decreased from approximately 8.8 
ecents/
kWh for a turbine installed in the mid-1980s to 4.1 
ecents/kWh for a recently built 1,000 kW turbine, an
improvement of more than 50% over 15 years. Wind isalready competitive with some new coal-fired plants and insome locations can challenge gas, currently the cheapestoption. 
The cost of wind power generation falls as the 
average wind speed rises. 
Analysis by industry magazine Windpower Monthly
shows that at a site with an average wind speed of 8.5metres per second, and a capital cost per installed kilo-watt of approximately 
e800, wind is already competitive
with gas.
Conventional energy sources receive an 
estimated e230-280 billion in subsidies per
year world-wide.

29As its economic attraction has increased, wind power
has become big business. Most importantly, the windpower business is attracting serious interest from newplayers such as General Electric and Shell.
Wind power technology
Wind power is a deceptively simple technology. Behind thetall, slender towers and steadily turning blades lies a com-plex interplay of lightweight materials, aerodynamic designand computerised electronic control. 
Although a number of variations continue to be explored,
the most common configuration has become the horizon-tal axis three bladed turbine with its rotor positionedupwind – on the windy side of the tower. Power is trans-ferred from the rotor through a gearbox, sometimes oper-ating at variable speed, and then to a generator. Some tur-bines avoid a gearbox by use of direct drive. 
Within this broad envelope, continuing improvements are
being made in the ability of the machines to capture asmuch energy as possible from the wind. These includemore powerful rotors, larger blades, improved power elec-tronics, better use of composite materials and taller towers.
The most dramatic improvement has been in the increasing
size and performance of wind turbines. From machines ofjust 25 kW twenty years ago, the commercial size rangesold today is typically from 750 up to 2,500 kW. In 2003the average capacity of new turbines installed in Germanyrose to almost 1,600 kW. A 2,000 kW turbine is 100times more powerful than the old 1980s vintage
machines. 
The largest machines commercially available today are of
3,600 kW capacity, with a rotor diameter of 104 metres.Towers at inland sites can now stretch up more than 100 metres to catch the wind. One result is that manyfewer turbines are required to achieve the same poweroutput, saving land use in the process. Depending on itssiting, a 1 MW turbine can produce enough electricity forup to 650 households.
In the future, even larger turbines will be produced to serv-
ice the new offshore market. Machines in a range up to5,000 kW are currently under development. In 2003 theGerman company Enercon erected the first prototype ofits 4,500 kW turbine with a rotor diameter of 112 metres.
For offshore developments, there are new technical
demands. The wind turbines must be firmly positioned onthe sea bed by using one of several foundation designs –steel monopiles driven deep into the sub-soil, gravity-basedconcrete caissons or tripod supports. Cables have to belaid both between the turbines in an array and back to

Maintenance requires the ready availability of service ves-sels, making turbine reliability of paramount importance.Overall, wind turbines have a design lifetime of 20-25 years.
Complete wind turbines and their support components
are manufactured in factories now spread throughoutEurope and the world. The leading turbine manufacturersare based in Denmark, Germany, Spain, the United States,India and Japan.Developing a specific wind farm involves advance moni-
toring of wind speeds at the site, using a mast-mountedanemometer, careful planning of the layout to make bestuse of the resource, and avoidance of such obstacles asarchaeological remains or bird migration routes.Construction can be completed within a matter of weeks,with large cranes installing the turbine towers, nacellesand blades on top of reinforced concrete foundations. Thewind turbines themselves represent about 75% of the cap-ital cost of an onshore project, with the remainder comingmainly from grid connection, land costs, foundations androad construction.
Once operating, wind farms can be controlled remotely
by computer link-up, with constant monitoring of theiroutput and performance. They can vary in size from a2 - THE GLOBAL STATUS OF WIND POWER
ACHIEVEMENTS AND ISSUES
Reliability
In larger projects using proven medium sized turbines an availability of 98% is consistently achieved.
Noise
Some early turbine designs were noisy, but improved engineering has resulted in mechanical noise being virtuallyeliminated and aerodynamic noise levels vastly improved.
Efficiency
Wind turbines are now highly efficient, with less than 10% thermal losses in system transmission. 
Visual impact 
How and where to position wind farms requires sensitive treatment, but surveys of European public reaction tooperational wind farms have shown a largely positive response.
Contribution to power supply 
With penetration levels of up to 20% in Denmark and around 5% in both Germany and Spain, wind power isalready making a significant contribution. Growth of the offshore market, a resource large enough to supply all of Europe’s electricity, will further reinforce this significance.With penetration levels of up to 20% inDenmark and around 5% in both Germany and Spain, wind power is already making a significant contribution.

31few megawatts up to the largest so far - 300 MW in the
western United States.
The variability of the wind has produced far fewer problems
for electricity grid management than sceptics had anticipat-ed. On windy winter nights, wind turbines account for up to50% of power generation in the western part of Denmark,for example, but the grid operators have managed it suc-cessfully. It would improve the effectiveness and reliabilityof the European wind input, however, if a new super-grid wasinstalled to link up the many large offshore plants expectedto start generating power over the next decade.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Germany – World leader
Germany is the undisputed world leader in wind energy.
Since the early 1990s, encouraged by supportivenational and regional policies, a rapidly expandingindustry has shown the way forward for other Europeannations.
The current figure for installed wind power capacity in
Germany (by end 2003) stands at more than 14,600 MW.These turbines can produce enough electricity in a normalwind year to meet 5.9% of demand in a country of 82 mil-lion people. If present trends continue, the proportion isexpected to reach 10% by 2010.
During 2003 alone more than 1,700 new wind turbines
were connected to the grid, representing a capacity of2,645 MW. This continued the impressive growth seen inGermany since the mid-1990s. The average annualincrease in cumulative capacity over the past three yearshas been 34%.
No other development in the history of the country’s elec-
tricity industry can compare with this. The German WindEnergy Association contrasts the output from nuclearpower after its first ten years of commercial expansion –6.5 TWh in 1970 – with the output from wind after tenyears of government support – more than 11 TWh in2000.
In the process, a major new industry has been estab-
lished in a country already recognised for its engineeringskills. Most of the wind turbines operating in Germany arenow home produced, with companies like Enercon, VestasDeutschland, Nordex, GE Wind Energy and REpower havingbuilt up major manufacturing bases. More than 45,000
people are currently employed by the industry. Sales inthe sector were expected to have reached 
e4.8 billion
during 2003.
Landmark legislation
Following government-sponsored research programmesduring the 1980s, the big breakthrough for the Germanmarket came in 1991, when the Stromein-speisungs-gesetz – Electricity Feed Law (EFL) - was passed by parliament.This landmark legislation guaranteed to all renewableenergy producers up to 90% of the domestic sale price ofelectricity for every kilowatt hour they generated. Basedon the argument that clean energy sources need encour-agement both to establish a market and to compete withhistorically subsidised fuels like coal and nuclear, the lawhas proved both administratively simple and effective inpractice.
In 2000 the principle of the EFL was further established
through a new Renewable Energy Law. This recognisedwind’s increasing competitiveness by introducing adecreasing output payment after five years of a turbine’soperation. Despite further adaptations in the payments,making inland turbines less attractive to install, theGerman market continues to expand  National policieshave also been shadowed by strong regional developmentplans. In the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, forexample, 34% of electricity demand is now satisfied bywind power. One factor has been the low interest loansavailable to wind farm developers through the non-profitmaking Investitionsbank. In the neighbouring, more popu-lated state of Lower Saxony, which has equally strongsupport policies, wind turbines now satisfy 15.6% of thesupply. To progress developments faster, many stateshave designated certain areas as prime sites for new windschemes.
Broad ownership
The powerful financial incentives provided both nationallyand regionally in Germany have had two other importanteffects. Firstly, they have enabled wind power to spread farbeyond the most obviously windy sites along the North Seacoastline. The result is that even land-locked inland statesWIND POWER SUCCESS STORIES

Wind power in Germany can produce enough

35like Saxony-Anhalt (1,632 MW, 24% of demand) and
Brandenburg (1,807 MW, 22% of demand), where windspeeds are much lower, have benefited from the boom.The industry has responded by producing turbines special-ly adapted to work efficiently at lower wind speed sites.
The second effect has been to open up the ownership and
investment potential of wind energy to a wide range ofpeople. Many wind parks have been developed throughinvestment funds in which shares are bought by smallbusinessmen and companies, who in turn benefit from aninvestment tax rebate. One estimate is that more than150,000 Germans now hold a stake in a wind energy proj-ect, another reason why developments are well supportedby local people. In many regions wind power has becomean important source of income for farmers and local gov-ernment.
Green policies
Political support for wind power comes from the stronginfluence wielded by environmentalists, including theGreens, who currently share government with the Social
Democrats. Green-Social Democrat coalitions also controla number of individual states. Another important policydecision has been the announced intention to shut downthe country’s 19 nuclear power stations, presently provid-ing 30% of electricity, within 30 years, at the end of theirtechnical lifetime.
At the same time, the German government has taken up
Greenpeace proposals and established a new long term tar-get for wind power to produce at least 25% of the country’selectricity by 2025. Much of this will be supplied by offshorewind parks in the North and Baltic Seas and by “re-power-ing" older machines on existing sites with newer turbines.By 2030 according to DEWI wind power could be providing30% of German electricity demand from approximately54,000 MW of capacity, over half of that total out to sea.By 2030 according to DEWI wind power could

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004United States – Waking giant
The United States is fast becoming one of the world's
leading wind energy markets, following a long lull during the 1990s. There are now utility-scale windpower installations in 30 states, totaling 6,361 MW atthe end of 2002. These generate enough electricity toserve more than 1.6 million average US households. 
While the US wind industry's long-term prospects remain
very bright, owing to the country's enormous windresource, commercial activity was again staggered at theend of 2003 by expiry of the federal wind energy produc-tion tax credit (PTC), a major development incentive. Itwas the third time in less than five years that the USCongress has allowed the credit to expire, creating seri-ous short-term market instability.
With expiry of the credit looming at year's end, the indus-
try installed a near-record 1,687 MW in 2003, boostingwind energy's five year growth rate to 28%. Many analystsand industry executives expect to see double-digit growthfor the rest of the decade, although it is likely that 2004will see a temporary slowdown.
The reliable and affordable cost of wind energy is one of
the main factors underpinning wind energy’s expansion.This stability allows utilities and merchant power compa-nies to "hedge their bets" against volatility in natural gasprices, and a growing number are including wind in theirportfolio. PacifiCorp, for example, a utility serving cus-tomers in six western states, plans to develop 1,400 MWof renewable energy as part of 4,000 MW of new power itwill seek between 2004 and 2014. 
Preliminary economic studies suggested that the optimal
scenario was one in which most of the additional powershould come from wind. The largest US wind developer isFPL Energy, a subsidiary of Florida Power and Light, amajor utility which owns and operates large nuclear andgas plants.Renewables portfolio standards
Supportive state policies have also helped to create agrowing market for wind. In an effort to diversify their ener-gy portfolios, several states have passed legislation toincrease the share of renewable sources in their utilities'generation mix. Texas adopted a minimum renewableenergy requirement, or renewables portfolio standard(RPS), with great success in 1999. Wind energy installa-tions already exceed 1,200 MW in the Lone Star state.  
In New York, it has been estimated that an RPS aiming for
25% renewable generation by 2012 would generate $100 million a year in income, local tax revenue, and jobsto farmers and communities that host wind power genera-tors. Farmers earn income from leasing their "wind rights"and continue to grow crops up to the base of the turbines.The policy will also create thousands of construction jobs.As of February 2004, 14 states had adopted an RPS.
The absence of a stable national policy on wind 
power is still a major constraint on the American wind energy industry. 
The federal production tax credit (PTC) provides a 
1.5 cent/kWh credit (adjusted for inflation) for electricityproduced from wind technology, and was enacted in 1992to help "level the playing field" with other energy sources.But although the PTC has been extended twice over thepast five years, each time Congress has allowed it toexpire before acting, and then has only approved shortextensions. This has produced a “boom and bust” cycle,resulting in cancelled projects and laid-off workers, and isa case study in how poorly-applied national policies canslow the growth of an emerging industry.WIND POWER SUCCESS STORIES
UNITED STATES
The industry installed a near-record 
1,687 MW in 2003, boosting wind energy'sfive year growth rate to 28%. 


WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
37With the PTC's future duration currently uncertain, a multi-
year extension would provide a much-needed stable mar-ket signal. Long-term stability in the wind energy marketwould equally be encouraged by a national renewableenergy goal or renewables portfolio standard. 
Unlocking transmission barriers
In order to unlock the vast wind energy potential ofAmerica's heartland and transport that power to market,it is critical that wind generators be able to gain accessto the transmission network on fair terms comparedwith other generation technologies. 
Fortunately, transmission barriers, which have slowed
expansion of wind power in many regions of the US, arebeginning to recede.  
Federal regulators have proposed a dramatic overhaul of
the wholesale electricity market structure that includesfair treatment of wind energy in transmission pricing.Among other changes this would eliminate all penalties
associated with wind’s variable output when that variabili-ty does not result in increased costs to the system.However, carrying out these changes will be difficult dueto power struggles between federal and state authorities.
Wind development also requires investments in bulk
transmission capacity from the rural, sparsely populatedbut windy regions to markets in major population centres.In Minnesota, for instance, the state has authorised con-struction of the largest single transmission project in overtwenty years specifically to tap the state’s powerful winds.  
The United States still has far to go before wind power
realises its full potential - enough, according to federalstudies, to meet more than twice the nation's electricitydemand. The state of North Dakota alone has about fiftytimes the wind resource of Germany. But the pace of windpower development in the US will depend to a large extenton the adoption of steady, supportive policies.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004India – Wind leader in Asia
Among countries outside Europe and the United States,
India has pioneered the use of wind energy as a vitalalternative to its dependence on fossil fuels. The windleader in Asia, a total of over 400 MW of new capacitywas commissioned during 2003 – the highest ever installation level achieved in a single year. India is nowpoised to leap forward again with a new generation ofmore powerful wind farms.
With a total capacity of 2,125 MW, India is maintaining its
position as the fifth largest producer of wind power in theworld.. Even so, given the country’s vast potential, espe-cially in the windy coastal regions, progress could bemuch faster than this.
The original impetus to develop wind energy in India came
in the early 1980s from the then Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources, now known as the Ministryof Non-Conventional Energy Sources (MNES). Its purposewas to encourage a diversification of fuel sources away
from the growing demand for coal, oil and gas required bythe country’s rapid economic growth. The total potential ofwind power in India is around 45,000 MW.
Monitoring stations
In order to pinpoint the best resources, MNES establisheda country-wide network of wind speed measurement sta-tions. A number of financial incentives have also been pro-vided for investors, including depreciation of capital costsand exemptions from excise duties and sales tax. An 80%tax rebate on the income from power generation duringthe first ten years of operation is available for wind powerprojects. Individual states have their own incentiveschemes, including capital cost subsidies.
One result of these incentives has been to encourage
industrial companies and businesses to invest in windpower. An important attraction is that owning a wind tur-bine assures them of a power supply to their factory orbusiness in a country where power cuts are common.Wind farms in India therefore often consist of clusters ofindividually owned generators. 
Over the past few years, both the government and the
wind power industry have succeeded in injecting greaterWIND POWER SUCCESS STORIES

39stability into the Indian market. This has involved a mix-
ture of encouragement to larger private and public sectorenterprises to invest in the sector and the parallel stimu-lation of an indigenous manufacturing base. Some com-panies now produce up to 80% of components for theirturbines in India, rather than importing them from themajor European manufacturers. This has resulted both inmore cost effective production and in creating additionallocal employment.
Manufacturing base
Around ten wind turbine manufacturers are currently offer-ing their products on the Indian market. The major playersare Vestas RRB, Suzlon, Enercon, GE Wind Energy andGamesa.
The geographical spread of wind power in India has so far
been concentrated in a few regions, especially the south-ern state of Tamil Nadu, which accounts for roughly half ofall installations. 
This is beginning to change, with other states like
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradeshcatching up. The Indian government envisages a capacityaddition of around 5,000 MW by 2012, reflecting a yearlyinstallation of 500-600 MW.Over the past few years, both the government
and the wind power industry have 
succeeded in injecting greater stability into
the Indian market. One result of these incentives has been 
to encourage industrial companies and 
businesses to invest in wind power.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Denmark – Commercial success
Denmark’s wind power manufacturing industry is a
major commercial success story. From a standing startin the 1980s to a turnover of more than 
e3 billion,
the wind sector has grown faster than any other business sector in Denmark and is bigger than thecement or steel industries Danish wind turbines dominate the global market, and the country hasforged itself a position at the head of the fastest growing energy source in the world.
Over the past 15 years the Danish wind turbine industry
has grown into one of the heavyweights in machinery man-ufacturing. Alongside the two major turbine manufacturers- Vestas and Bonus - there are a score of large componentcompanies and dozens of smaller suppliers. From a fewhundred workers in 1981 the industry now provides jobsfor over 20,000 people in Denmark – more than the wholeelectricity sector – and further thousands in manufactureand installation around the world.
The past decade in particular has seen a dramatic
increase in the production capacity of Danish turbine man-ufacturers. Annual output, mainly for export around theworld, has increased from 368 MW in 1994 to over3,200MW in 2003. Despite the emergence of competingmanufacturing countries, 40% of the wind turbine capaci-ty being installed globally today is of Danish origin.
Government commitments
One reason for the Danish wind industry’s success is thecommitment from successive governments to a series ofnational energy plans aimed at reducing dependency onimported fuel, improving the environment and movingtowards greater sustainability. Nuclear power has beenrejected as an option and there is firm commitment tophase out coal completely as a fuel in power stations. Nonew coal-fired capacity will be installed. These domesticpolicies have in turn helped spawn a thriving export indus-
try for wind turbines.
In 1981, the first Danish government energy plan envisaged
that 10% of electricity consumption should be met withwind power by 2000. The government then expected thatthis could be reached by installing 60,000 wind turbineswith an average capacity of 15 kW. The 10% target was infact reached three years early with less than 5,000 turbineswith an average size of 230 kW. In 2004, wind power willaccount for more than 20% of Danish electricity con-sumption. 
Following a new agreement in parliament adding a total
of 750 MW to existing installed capacity will, by 2010,increase the proportion to more than 25%. This is ahigher proportion than any other country in the world.
By 2030 wind is expected to be supplying up to half of the
country’s electricity and a third of its total energy. To reachthis level, a capacity in excess of 5,500 MW will need tobe installed, a good proportion of it offshore.
Engineering innovation
Having already achieved more than 20% penetration, freshchallenges have emerged for wind power in Denmark,especially in the context of a new liberalised EU internalelectricity market. The Danish authorities, transmissionsystem operators, power companies and manufacturersare now working closely to find new market based, as wellas technical, solutions for introducing even more windpower into the system.
An important element in the Danish success story has
always been technological innovation. At a time in the1980s when wind turbine design was locked in a “biggestis best” approach, the Danes went back to basics, usingskills partly from agricultural engineering to constructsmaller, more flexible machines. From the outset thefocus was customer-oriented and on making machinesthat produce electricity at the lowest possible cost perunit. The familiar three-bladed design with the rotor andblades set upwind (on the windy side of the tower) is nowthe classic concept against which all others are judged.WIND POWER SUCCESS STORIES
DENMARK
From a few hundred workers in 1981 the
industry now provides jobs for over 20,000 people in Denmark – more than the whole electricity sector.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
41More recently, Denmark has led the world in the develop-
ment of proposals to build large wind farms of turbines inits coastal waters. The first of these, at Horns Rev in theNorth Sea (160 MW) was built during 2002; the second,off the coast from Nysted at Roedsand Banke (158 MW),was completed in 2003. In 2007 and 2008 two new off-shore wind farms of at least 200 MW will be completed.A succession of further large offshore wind farms isexpected to be announced in the coming years.
Another feature of Danish development is that historical-
ly most of the turbines erected have been owned by indi-viduals or specially established wind co-operatives. Over150,000 Danish families now either own themselves, orhave shares in, wind energy schemes. Even the large 40 MW Middelgrunden wind farm in the sea just outsideCopenhagen is partly owned by a co-operative with 8,500 members.
One reason for the Danish wind industry’s 
success is the commitment from successive
governments to a series of national energy
plans.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Spain – Southern Europe’s powerhouse
The Spanish wind energy industry has forged ahead 
in recent years more successfully than any other insouthern Europe. 
A sparsely populated countryside combined with strong
government policies have together made Spain a power-house for both manufacture and development.
In 1993 just 52 MW of wind energy capacity was operating
in the Spanish landscape, much of that concentrated in thewindy district of Tarifa facing south towards Africa. By theend of 2001 the total had mushroomed to 3,550 MW,almost 30% installed in that one year alone. During 2003,new capacity increased yet again to reach 6,420 MW, main-taining Spain’s position as No.2 wind nation in the world.
As importantly, this development is now taking place
across many regions, from the jagged Atlantic coastline inthe northwest to the mountains of Navarre, in the shadowof the Pyrenees, to the sun-drenched plains of Castilla laMancha. Around 75% of the wind turbines installed so farhave come from three Spanish manufacturers – Gamesa,Made and Ecotècnia.
National support
The origins of Spain’s success can be found in a mixtureof factors – a good wind regime liberally spread across aland mass over ten times as large as Denmark, a nation-al support scheme which is strong and straightforwardand a focused regional development policy.
The first piece of legislation to provide substantial back-
ing for renewable energy was introduced in 1994. Thisobliged all electricity distribution companies to pay aguaranteed premium price for green power, operating in asimilar way to the Electricity Feed Law in Germany. Politicaland legal commitment to renewables was reaffirmed in1997 by a new Electricity Act designed to bring the whole
electricity system into harmony with the steady openingup of European power markets to full competition.
The 1997 law enshrined for the first time an objective for
at least 12% of the country’s energy to come from renew-able sources by 2010, in line with the European Union’starget. To help achieve this, the law says that renewableenergy producers are entitled to be paid the wholesaleelectricity market price, plus a premium or incentive, sothat the total amount paid per unit of electricity producedranges between 80% and 90% of the average retail price.During 2003, wind energy producers were paid a finalaverage price of 6.38 
ecents/kWh, keeping wind a rela-
tively attractive investment.
Provincial plans
Whilst national laws are important, a crucial impetus forwind development in Spain has come from the bottom up,from regional governments keen to see factories built andlocal jobs created. The busiest regions have so far beenGalicia, Castilla la Mancha, Aragon, Castilla y Leon andNavarre. 
The incentive is simple: companies who want to 
develop the region’s wind resource must ensure thatthe investment they make puts money into the localeconomy and sources as much of its hardware as possible from local manufacturers.
A pioneer of this approach has been Galicia, the north-
western region whose coastline juts out into the AtlanticOcean. The new regional government’s plan is to install acapacity of 4,000 MW by 2010, enough to satisfy about55% of the province’s power demand. To achieve this, ashortlist of promoting companies, including power utili-ties, independent developers and turbine manufacturers,have been granted concessions to develop set quotas ofcapacity within 140 specified “areas of investigation”.The total investment value could reach 
e3.3 billion.
Galicia’s aim is that at least 70% of this investment
should be made within its borders, creating thousands ofjobs. As a result, factories making blades, componentsand complete turbines have sprouted up around theWIND POWER SUCCESS STORIES

43province. By the end of 2003, the region had already
achieved 1,579 MW, almost 40% of the target. The moun-tainous province of Navarre is relatively even more ambi-tious. During 2003 it reached 717 MW, already well on theway to its target for 900 MW by 2010. Together with othergreen power sources, this would make it completely self-sufficient from renewable energy alone. Most of the windfarms in Navarre have been built by EHN, the leading inde-pendent Spanish wind developer. 
Other provinces have similar industrial development
plans, with at least 13,000 MW of wind capacity plannedto be constructed across 14 regions by 2011. One of thelast wind energy provincial plans has been adopted byValencia, with the goal of developing more that 2,000 MW. Environmental concerns have been given a differentemphasis in different regions. Navarra included environ-mental impact assessment as a key aspect in site selec-tion right from the start, thus preventing local conflicts.Other provinces have not fully dealt with these issues,leading to conflicts with organisations and residents. Ifsuch conflicts had been prevented beforehand, windpower would have been developed in Spain to an evengreater extent and with even more public acceptance.
Financial confidence
The Spanish model of development has also been differentfrom other European countries. Most wind farms construct-ed have been large, with investment coming from consortia
linking independent developers, power utilities, turbine man-ufacturers, financial institutions and regional governments.
One important feature of the Spanish market is the
confident approach taken by financial institutions. 
Although the national law does not specify how long the
present system of price support will last, major Spanishbanks are relatively happy to lend on wind schemes dueto the wide political consensus for renewables and thefact that the Electricity Act links the amount of the premi-ums to the achievement of the 12% goal by 2010.
The major technical problem has been the poor grid infra-
structure in some parts of the country, necessitating thebuilding of many kilometres of new power lines to connectup wind farms. This problem is now being solved partly byagreements to share the cost of grid strengtheningbetween groups of developers who will all ultimately ben-efit from the improvement. However, many developershave still encountered substantial difficulties in reachingan agreement with the grid operator. Utilities in manycases have been abusing their dominant position to try toavoid or delay access to their networks by wind projects,especially those coming from independent operators. Theprovince of Aragon has introduced a binding system toovercome the difficulty of access to the grid.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Offshore – The new frontier
Offshore sites are the new frontier for the international
wind industry. In northern Europe alone many thousands of megawatts of capacity are planned offthe coasts of a dozen countries. Eventually, this newoffshore business could challenge the oil and gas producers on their home territory.
The main motivation for going offshore is the considerably
higher – and more predictable – wind speeds to be foundout at sea. With average speeds well above 8 metres persecond at a height of 60 metres, most of the marine sitesbeing considered in northern European waters are expect-ed to deliver between 20% and 40% more energy thangood shoreline sites. A second advantage is that placingwind farms offshore reduces their impact on the land-scape, with many of the developments now being plannedvirtually invisible from the shore.
It is currently more expensive to build wind turbines out at
sea. Offshore wind farms require strong foundationswhich must be firmly lodged in the sea bed. Many kilome-tres of cabling is required to bring their power back toshore, and both construction and maintenance work mustbe carried out in reasonable weather conditions usingspecialist boats and equipment. Nonetheless, as demandincreases the industry is beginning to substitute cheaperstandard components and facilities, driving down electric-ity costs, as has happened on land.
Larger projects
Part of the wind industry’s solution has been to go forincreasingly large projects which can benefit fromeconomies of scale and reduce the unit production cost.
Some of those being planned off the coasts of the UK envis-age total capacities of more than 1,000 MW. At the sametime, individual turbines with capacities up to 5 MW - andwith special features to withstand the more severe weatherout at sea - are being manufactured to meet the offshoredemand. A large number of specialist companies have alsoentered the construction, installation and servicing market.
At the cutting edge in the offshore race has been Denmark,
which already accounts for most of the current installedcapacity of 529 MW. In 2002, the first large offshore windfarm was constructed at Horns Rev, between 14 and 20 kilometres from the Danish North Sea coast. With eighty2 MW turbines this has a capacity of 160 MW, enough tosatisfy 2% of Denmark’s demand. A similarly sized devel-opment was installed at Nysted in the Baltic during 2003.Two new offshore wind farms of at least 200 MW each arebeing commissioned for completion by 2007 and 2008.
Danish plans are likely to be matched soon, however, by
those of the UK. Overseen by the Crown Estate, whichowns the rights to exploration in the seas round Britain, afirst round of bidding resulted in rights being granted toconsortia of companies to develop 15 sites with up to600 turbines. The first outcome of this, the 60 MW NorthHoyle wind farm, was opened off the coast of north Walesin 2003, with a second 60 MW development now underconstruction in the North Sea.
In a second bidding round, the results of which were
announced at the end of 2003, a series of far larger proj-ects were proposed. Fifteen wind farms with a total capac-ity of up to 7,200 MW are now planned in three strategicsea areas identified by the UK government off the coun-try’s eastern and western coasts. The largest, in theGreater Wash area off eastern England, would alone havea capacity of 1,200 MW. When completed, these “secondround” projects could provide enough power for four mil-lion homes, or one in six UK households, according to cal-culations by the British Wind Energy Association.

to avoid coastal conservation zones, many of these areset at distances of up to 60 kilometres from the shore,and in water depths of up to 35 metres. Construction per-mits from the national maritime authority have alreadybeen granted to six projects in the North and Baltic Seaswith a total capacity of up 1,200 MW, depending on theturbine size chosen, although some depend on agreementover the location of undersea cables bringing power backto shore. None has yet started construction, however.
The goal of the German Government is to see up to
25,000 MW of wind parks in the sea by 2025-30. Thiswould satisfy roughly 15% of the country’s (1998) elec-tricity demand. Under the Renewable Energy Law, offshoreschemes started up before 2008 are also eligible toreceive the maximum guaranteed “feed-in” tariff for theiroutput over twelve years, as opposed to the normal fivefor on shore projects.
Other European countries with advanced offshore plans
include the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and Sweden.Ireland saw the first 25MW pilot phase of the 500 MWArklow Bank wind farm built in 2003. In the Netherlands, the E-Connection consortium has
plans to start construction soon on its 120 MWscheme, whilst the C-Power consortium is also poisedto break ground on its 2-300 MW project off the Belgiancoast. Sweden has given approval for its largestscheme so far – 48 turbines in the Øresund strait at theentrance to the Baltic Sea. With the longer lead timesrequired for offshore developments, including detailedmonitoring of fauna and flora, the period during whichthese plans are expected to seriously take off is from2005 onwards. Eventually, it is estimated that a seaarea of 150,000 square kilometres with a water depthof less than 35 metres could be available for offshoreschemes. This would provide enough power to satisfyall of Europe’s current demand.

“THE TOTAL AVAILABLE GLOBAL WIND RESOURCE THAT IS

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
47If wind power is to expand substantially beyond its present level around the world, then it is
essential to understand clearly whether the natural resources are available to achieve theseambitious targets. In practice, a lack of resource is unlikely to be a limiting factor in the utilisation of wind power for electricity production. The world’s wind resources are estimatedto be 53,000 TWh/year, whilst the world’s electricity consumption is predicted to rise to lessthan half that by 2020.WINDFORCE12

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Is there enough wind?
If wind power is to expand substantially beyond its present
level around the world, then it is essential to understandclearly whether the natural resources are available toachieve these ambitious targets. Research to date showsthat the world’s wind resources are huge, and distributedover almost all regions and countries. Several assess-ments of their magnitude have been carried out.
The methodology used in such studies is to assess the
square kilometres of land available with average annualwind speeds of more than 5-5.5 metres per second(m/sec) at a height of ten metres above ground level. Thisaverage speed is recognised as feasible for the exploita-tion of wind power at today’s generating costs. The totalavailable resource is then reduced by 90% or more inorder to account for constraints on the use of land. Thiscould include other human activities or infrastructure or ahigh population density. At the end of this process thewind resource is converted into Terawatt hours (TWh) ofelectricity produced per year, based on the “state of theart” performance of commercial wind turbines availableon the market.Experience from countries where wind power development
is already established also shows that when moredetailed assessments are carried out, more potentialsites have in fact proved to be available than was expect-ed. A good example of this has been the exploitation ofless obviously windy inland sites in Germany. In othercases the local topography creates exceptionally goodconditions, such as in the mountain passes of California.It is therefore likely that the total global resource will beeven higher than indicated by assessments based onregional climatic observations. Finally, it is certain thatfurther improvements in the technology will extend thepotential for utilising wind speeds of less than 5 m/sec.
What is clear is that a lack of resource is unlikely ever
to be a limiting factor in the utilisation of wind powerfor electricity production. The world’s wind resourcesare estimated to be 53,000 TWh/year, whilst theworld’s electricity consumption is predicted to rise to 25,579 TWh/year by 2020. The total available globalwind resource that is technically recoverable is therefore more than twice as large as the projection for the world’s entire electricity demand.

On land wind resources in Europe
The wind energy potential of OECD countries was exam-
ined in a 1993 Utrecht University study by Wijk andCoelingh. This was a conservative scenario that restrictedthe “exploitable resource” considerably compared withthe Grubb & Meyer study used in Figure 3-1. The reasonfor this was to take into account Europe’s high populationdensity and large infrastructure elements such as roads,airports and railways.
In Table 3.1, the total technical wind energy potential is
shown for each country alongside the amount that itwould have left over after a notional 20% “penetrationlimit” had been set on the national grid network (see“Electricity Grid Limitations” below). One reason for doingsuch calculations in Europe is that all the national gridsare interconnected, enabling the export of electricity fromone country to another.
It is also worth emphasising that the Utrecht University
study was carried out when the average size of new windturbine was 250-300 kW. It is obvious that with upscalingsince then to an average size closer to 1,000 kW, and withturbine rotors at a height of up to 100 metres instead of
30, a considerably higher annual yield will result. The studyis therefore conservative in the context of today’s “state ofthe art” technology. Another important observation is thatwhen more detailed assessments are carried out for a spe-cific region, they tend to reveal much higher potentials.Detailed studies by the Ministry of Economic Affairs inGermany, for example, have shown that the onshore windpotential is 124 TWh (an installed capacity of 64,000 MW),five times higher than the 24 TWh given in Table 3.1.
Overall, the figures in Table 3.1 indicate that there is an
exploitable potential for on land wind power in Europe ofmore than 600 TWh/year. Some countries can also pro-duce much more electricity from the wind than they coulduse internally. This presents a challenge to the developingcross-border European power market.
Offshore wind resources in Europe
There is an enormous additional wind resource to befound in the seas around the coastline of Europe. SeveralEuropean countries, led by Denmark, are already seeingthe first large scale offshore wind farms built in their ter-ritorial waters. A study led by consultants Garrad Hassanand Germanischer Lloyd, carried out under the EuropeanUnion’s Joule research programme in 1993-5, estimatedan offshore wind potential in the EU of 3,028 TWh. Eventhough Norway and Sweden were not included, this figurefar exceeded the total electricity consumption within theUnion’s 15 members in 1997.
Using a geographical database developed by Garrad
Hassan, this study assumed that the wind resource canbe used out to a water depth of 40 m and up to 30 kmfrom land. A reference wind turbine of 6 MW capacity and100 m diameter rotor was used, with the spacing betweenturbines set at one kilometre.

resource” available for development within the next two tothree decades, given anticipated technology advances.
Reductions to the figures in the offshore resources study
have been made using the following criteria:
Because of the current expense involved, particularlyin foundation work, all water depths over 20 m havebeen excluded. This is a conservative assumptiongiven that a number of projects are already planned ingreater water depths (see “Offshore – The NewFrontier”, above). Sites less than 10 km from theshore have been reduced by 90% to be sensitive tovisual concerns.The resource within the range 10-20 km from the
shore has been reduced by half in order to allow forpotential visual restrictions and adequate spacingbetween wind farms, whilst the 20-30 km resourcehas also been reduced by 50% on the assumption thatthe expense of lengthy power cable connections willdeter smaller developers.
Even taking all these reductions into account, the final fig-
ure for European offshore wind potential amounts to313.6 TWh, about 10% of the gross potential identified inthe offshore study. This is still equal to half the potentialon land in Europe.

The combined figure for both land and sea, taking into
account only the most feasible offshore sites, leaves Europewith a potential resource of some 940 TWh – enough tomeet 21% of anticipated electricity demand by 2020. Mostimportantly, since only 10% of the gross potential hasbeen accounted for, improved technology and cheaperfoundation techniques are likely to make it easy to extendthe offshore contribution by a significant amount.
Future demand for electricity
Future demand for electricity is assessed from time totime by international organisations, including the WorldEnergy Council and the International Energy Agency (IEA).
This study is based on the latest projections for worldwideelectricity demand contained in the IEA report “WorldEnergy Outlook 2002”. This shows that by 2020 globalpower consumption will have reached an annual level of25,578 TWh, a 63% increase over the 2002 figure. By theearly 2030s, world demand will have doubled.

resource(TWh/year) Although the IEA projection for 2020 has been slightly
reduced from the organisation’s previous (2000) assess-ment, it is possible that more rational use of electricitywill further limit the growth in demand. Whereas earlierIEA assessments in the 1990s employed two scenarios,including an “Energy Savings Case”, these were subse-quently amalgamated into a single “Business as Usual”scenario - clearly reflecting the cautiousness of the IEAover the world community’s future efforts to reduce elec-tricity consumption.
Nonetheless, the lower projected future electricity con-
sumption in World Energy Outlook 2002 enabled us toshow that with the same amount of wind electricity, therelative proportion of wind power would increase – onefactor behind the increase from 10% of world demand inWind Force 10 (1999) to the newer projection of 12% inWind Force 12.Figure 3.3 hows projected future electricity demand
according to the IEA’s 2002 assessment broken down byregions of the world. This is important in assessing whatcontribution wind power needs to make in each region.Table 3.2 shows that in all regions of the world there isan excess of wind resource over what would be needed toachieve a 20% contribution to electricity supply by 2020.Table 3.3 shows how much wind energy generation will berequired if the technology is to grow fast enough to satis-fy 20% of world power demand within the next 40 years.  
It is worth bearing in mind that if wind power is enabled to
achieve the 12% penetration outlined in this scenario, itwould represent almost 20% of current world electricitydemand, highlighting the significant additional benefits ofwind power if consumption does not increase as expected.

Electricity grid limitations
The quantity of wind-powered electricity which can be read-
ily integrated into a country or region’s electricity griddepends mainly on the system’s ability to respond to fluc-tuations in supply. Any assessment must thereforeinclude data about the extent of output from other powerstation suppliers, their ability to regulate their supply, and
the consumption pattern in the system, particularly varia-tions in the load over a daily and annual timescale.Various assessments involving modern European gridshave shown that no technical problems will occur by run-ning wind capacity together with the grid system up to apenetration level of 20%.

In Denmark, peak levels in excess of 50% wind power
have been successfully incorporated by grid managersin the western part of the country during very windyperiods. The Danish Energy Plan includes a goal toconsistently cover 50% of the country’s electricity con-sumption from wind energy by 2030 by balancingimports and exports. 
This includes the use of interconnectors to neighbouring
countries, especially Norway and Sweden, both of whichhave large capacities of hydro power that complement thewind load profile.The cautious assumption adopted here is that a 20% limit
is an acceptable figure to be taken into account in thepotential penetration of wind power into the world’s gridnetworks. 
Table 3.2 shows how the world’s wind resources are
able to easily satisfy the technical issues of attaining a level of 20% of electricity penetration by 2020.

“BASED ON THE CURRENT RATE OF EXPANSION 
IN THE WIND POWER INDUSTRY, IT IS QUITE CAPABLE OFMEETING A GROWTH IN DEMAND  OF 25% PER YEAR FORAT LEAST  SEVEN YEARS AHEAD. ”

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
57Taking off from the figure for installed wind power capacity at the end of 2003, this scenario
projects a growth rate of 25% up to 2010, followed  by lower rates as the world total expands.Individual turbine size and capacity factors will both steadily increase. By the year 2020, aninstalled capacity of 1,245 GW will have been achieved, with an annual production capable ofmatching 12% of the world’s demand. This projected growth is comparable with the level ofmarket penetration achieved by other power generation technologies.WINDFORCE12

58
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Outline of the 12% scenario
The initial sections of this report have described the 
current status of wind power development around theworld, the environmental impetus behind its expansion,the global wind resource region by region and the expect-ed increase in electricity demand which will have to be satisfied. These elements are now brought together todemonstrate that it is feasible for 12% of that worldwidedemand for electricity to be supplied by wind power. 
The summary results of this exercise can be seen in Figure
4.1a and b, and Table 4.1. More detailed figures are givenin the Appendices.This feasibility study takes off from the figures for cumula-
tive wind energy at the end of 2003. The total installedcapacity around the world by then was just over 40,000 MW,with new installations during 2003 reaching 8,344 MW.Moving forward, the growth rate of new annual installationduring the period 2004 to 2010 is estimated to be 25%per annum, ending up with some 197,517 MW on line bythe end of 2010. This is the highest growth rate during theperiod. From 2011 onwards the rates steadily decline,although the continued growth of wind power will clearlytake place at a new high level of annual installation.
By the year 2020, an installed capacity of 1,245 GW
will have been achieved, with an annual productioncapable of matching 12% of the world’s demand forelectricity, as projected by the IEA.4 - 12% OF THE WORLD’S ELECTRICITY 
FROM WIND POWER 
By 2030 wind power will account for 21% of 
world electricity demand, and by 2040 for 23%. 


The scenario also projects the development of wind
power forward into 2040 though in far less detail.These projections shows that by 2030 wind power will account for 21% of world electricity demand, andby 2040 for 23%. 
Beyond 2019, development continues with an annual
installation rate of about 158,700 MW. Market penetra-tion is expected to follow a typical S-curve, with a “satu-ration” point reached in some 30-40 years, when a glob-al level of roughly 3,200 GW of wind energy will be main-tained. 
Over time, an increasing share of new capacity will involve
the replacement of old wind power plant. This assumes a20 year average lifetime for a wind turbine, requiringreplacement of existing turbines as well as the construc-
tion of new developments. Replacement, or “re-powering”,of turbines will become increasingly important in the lateryears of the scenario, picking up considerable speed from2025 onwards. By 2040 re-powering will account for allnew installed capacity. 
Growth rates for wind power are based on a mixture of his-
torical figures and information obtained from leading com-panies in the wind turbine market. The exploitable windpotential worldwide and the level of electricity consumption in different regions of the world have alsobeen assessed. Future cost reductions in wind technolo-gy are based on expectations of “learning rates” and takeoff from today’s level, which is approximately 
e804 per
kW of installed capacity, resulting in a price per kWh of 3.79 
ecents.
The growth rate beyond 2004 will be supported by new
capacity from the emerging offshore wind power market,mainly in Northern Europe. This is expected to make animportant contribution. Other regions may well join in dur-ing the timescale of this study, including the US andJapan, where the offshore potential is assessed asequivalent to 180% of the national power supply.

61Assumptions and parameters
The choice of parameters used in this study has been
based on historical experience both from the wind powerindustry and from other technological developments inthe energy field. 
The main assumptions were:
Annual growth rates
Growth rates of 20-25% per annum are high for anindustry manufacturing heavy equipment. However, thewind industry has experienced far higher growth ratesin the initial phase of its industrialisation. Between1993 and 1998, when the first Wind Force 10 assess-ment was made, the average annual growth in newcapacity was 40%, whilst from 1998 to 2003 it hascontinued at an impressive average of 26%.
Based on the current rate of expansion in the wind
energy industry, it is quite capable of meeting agrowth in demand of 25% a year for at least sevenyears ahead. By the end of 2010 manufacturing out-put is expected to reach a level of 39,787 MW/year.From 2011 onwards the annual growth rate of newcapacity slows down in the scenario to 20%, then to15% in 2015 and finally to 10% in 2019. The growthin manufacturing capacity levels out in 2019 at a fig-ure of 158,728 MW annually.
An important factor in Europe is the likely opening up
of offshore development from 2005 onwards, a mar-ket segment which will add further volume to thegenerally high level of expansion on land.Nonetheless, a clear message from the industry isthat it would like to see a stable political frameworkestablished for wind power development in emergingmarkets around the world before it enters local man-ufacturing through joint ventures.
Progress ratios
The general conclusion from industrial learning curvetheory is that costs decrease by some 20% each timethe number of units produced doubles. A 20% declineis equivalent to a progress ratio of 0.80. Studies ofthe past development of the wind power industry


62
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004show that progress through R&D efforts and by learn-
ing resulted in a 15-20% price reduction – equivalentto a progress ratio of 0.85 to 0.80. In the calculationof cost reductions in this report, experience has beenrelated to numbers of units, i.e. turbines and notmegawatt capacity. The increase in average unit sizeis therefore also taken into account.
The progress ratio assumed in this study starts at
0.85 up until 2010. After that it is reduced to 0.90.Beyond 2025, when development is approaching itssaturation level, it goes down to 1.0.
The reason for this graduated assumption, particularly in
the early years, is that the manufacturing industry hasnot so far gained the full benefits from series production,
especially due to the rapid upscaling of products. Neitherhas the full potential of future design optimisations beenutilised. Even so, the cost of wind turbine generators hasstill fallen significantly, and the industry is recognised ashaving entered the “commercialisation phase”, asunderstood in learning curve theories.4 - 12% OF THE WORLD’S ELECTRICITY

63Future growth of wind turbine size
Figure 4.2 shows the rapid growth of wind turbine sizein the commercial market over the past five years.From this it can be seen that in some of the leadingmarkets, notably the UK, Denmark and India, the aver-age size of turbine being installed has more than dou-bled. In the 12% scenario, the average size of new windturbines being installed is expected to grow over thenext decade from today’s figure of 1.2 MW to 2.0 MW.By the middle of the first decade of the scenario thisincrease will be pushed even harder by the emergingoffshore sector. Wind turbines for that market areexpected to be in the size range up to 5 MW. Mostimportantly, the development of larger sizes reducesthe number of turbines needed for a given capacityand decreases the progress ratio.
Increases in capacity factor
The capacity factor of wind turbines has alreadyincreased to the 24% global average we see today.This is the result of both better initial design and bet-ter siting. Most recently, the major contribution toimproved capacity factors has been the increased hubheight above ground of the larger turbines. The pro-duction of wind turbines with relatively large rotors (forinland sites) has also contributed. From the point ofview of the electricity network, a high capacity factor iswelcomed because it means more power into the gridat a given point. It is also worth noting that improvingthe capacity factor of wind turbines presents no tech-nical obstacle, it is simply a matter of improved gridintegration, modeling and cost. This scenario foreseesaverage capacity factors increasing further to 25% by
2006 and 28% by 2012.
Comparisons with other technologies
If wind energy is to achieve the level of market pene-tration anticipated in this feasibility study, how doesthat compare with the record of other power sources?
The most commonly used power plants in the world’s
electricity supply are large scale technologies such asthermal power stations fired with coal, gas or oil,nuclear reactors and large scale hydroelectric plants.Both nuclear power stations and large scale hydro aretechnologies which have been mainly developed sincethe middle of the twentieth century. They have nowreached a penetration of 17.1% and 16.6% respec-tively in the world’s power supply.
•Starting from 1,000 MW in 1960, nuclear powerplants accounted for 343,000 MW by the end of1997.
•Starting from 45,000 MW in 1950, hydro power plantsaccounted for 714,602 MW by the end of 1996. 
The history of these two technologies highlights that it is
possible to achieve such levels of penetration with a newtechnology over a period of 40-50 years. German WindThe average size of new wind turbines 
being installed is expected to grow over the
next decade from today’s figure of 1.2 MW 
to 2.0 MW. 


64
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Energy Association analysis shows that more electricity
was produced by wind during its first decade of commer-cial exploitation in Germany than by the nuclear industryin the equivalent period (see “Wind Energy SuccessStories”). The time horizon of the 12% target and beyondis therefore consistent with the historical development ofnuclear power and large scale hydro.
It is difficult, nonetheless, to directly compare these tech-
nologies with the likely penetration pattern for wind ener-gy. The main difference between wind and thermal plant isthat wind power is a small scale technology, with a maxi-mum commercial unit size today of 2-3 MW, although themodularity of wind power makes it ideal for all sizes ofinstallations, from a single unit to huge wind farms. 
On the supply side this gives a greater potential for cost
reduction, with serial production of units. It also makeswind energy suitable for many different types of electricityinfrastructure, from isolated loads fed by diesel power tohuge national and transnational grids.Seen from this viewpoint it is quite feasible that wind
energy can penetrate to a level of 12%. The amount ofinstalled capacity would then in fact be equivalent to thatof hydro power today – even though on paper it appearssome 50% higher. This is because of wind power’s lowercapacity factor.
Two other factors are important in the development of a
new technology. One is the market “push” from publiclyfunded R&D, the other is the market “pull” achieved by awide range of incentives directed either towards investorsin generation technology or the end user of electricity. Thelatter stimulation is often politically driven.
The relative progress of new power technologies has been
assessed in the study “Global Energy Perspectives”, pro-duced by the Austrian institute IIASA and the World EnergyCouncil in 1998. The report gives the following examples,all from the United States:

65• Wind turbines – from 1982 to 1987, achieved a
progress ratio of 20% (0.80);
• Gas turbines – progress ratio of 20% for the first
1,000 MW installed, then 10% from 1963 to1980, when 90,000 MW was installed.
Penetration levels based on the above assumptions have
been used in Figure 4.1.
Breakdown of the 12% scenario by region
The general guideline followed in the 12% scenario hasbeen to distribute the 1,245 GW to be installed by 2020in proportion to the consumption of electricity in the dif-ferent regions of the world. The OECD countries, however,are expected to take the lead in implementation, enablingthem to grow faster and ending up with a surplus in rela-tion to their global share of consumption. An adjustmenthas therefore been made for Europe and for NorthAmerica, particularly the USA.Another consideration has been the quality of wind
resources in terms of regional share of “high average windspeed regimes”. Areas with extremely high annual windspeeds will be more interested in developing wind powerthan large geographical areas with moderate wind speeds,even if the absolute resources are huge in the latter.
A third issue, which has not been assessed in detail for
this report, is how the windy regions of the world are sit-uated in relation to where consumption takes place. If themain areas generating wind electricity in a particular coun-try are concentrated far from populated areas and indus-trial centres, it might either result in restrictions on theutilisation of wind power or require a major investment intransmission lines.
The expected regional distribution of the 12% target is
outlined in Figures 4.3-4.5.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Investment value
This feasibility study shows the investment value of the
projected growth in wind power on a yearly basis, startingwith about 
e7 billion in 2003 and increasing to a peak
of e82.7 billion by 2019. The total investment (at 2003
prices) required to reach a level of 1,245 GW of windpower worldwide in 2020 is estimated at 
e692 billion.
Although this figure may appear large, it should be bornein mind that it is cumulative over the whole 20 year peri-od, and also represents only a fraction of total globalpower sector investment. During the 1990s, for example,annual investment in the power sector was running atsome 
e158-186 billion each year. By 2020 it might re-
present a more substantial proportion, but by then, itshould be remembered, wind power development will beheading towards a coverage of 20% of electricity demand,more than that of hydro power today.
Figure 5.1 shows the cumulative global investment needed
to achieve a 12% penetration by the year 2020. Investmentcosts are based on the progress assumptions alreadyexplained and are state of the art figures with the averagecost level in 2003 taken as 
e804 per kW of installed
capacity. By 2020 the investment cost falls to e 512/kW,
a substantial reduction of 36% compared to today.5 - 12% WIND POWER BY 2020

by 2019, the total investment  
(at 2003 prices) required to reach a level of
1,245 GW of wind power worldwide in 2020 is
estimated at e692 billion. Analysing how this investment would be spread around theregions of the world is not just a matter of dividing up thecapacity in accordance with the regional distribution inFigure 4.1. This is because development will not start atthe same time in all regions. 
Experience from the leading wind power nations has
shown that even with commercial technology available, itstill takes some time for large scale development to takeoff. The institutional framework facilitating the develop-ment must be in place, and it is desirable to get at leastsome local manufacturing in progress before major invest-ments are made.
Table 5.1 shows the average investment cost over differentperiods of time in the first two decades of the 21st century.This in turn allows us to allocate the regional investment,taking into account when development in individualregions is likely to take off.
Cost reductions
The cost per unit (kWh) of wind electricity has alreadyreduced dramatically as manufacturing and other costshave fallen. Between 1981 and 1995, according to anevaluation of wind turbines installed in Denmark by theRISØ National Research Laboratory, the cost per unit fellfrom 15.8 
ecents/kWh to 5.7 ecents/kWh, a decrease
of two thirds. 
The reasons included improved design of turbines and
better siting.
Since that time, the 500 kW size turbines then just being
introduced into the commercial market have been overtak-en by new generations of optimised and upscaled

machines with capacities of up to 2-3 MW. The International
Energy Agency estimates that the price of wind turbines hasreduced by 16% each time their average size doubles.
Based on market and industry experience, this study has
taken the following reference figures for “state of the art”wind turbines in 2003 under optimum conditions:
•Investment cost: e804 per installed kW
•Unit price for electricity: 3.79 ecents/kWhThe following parameters have been used in the calcula-
tion of future costs:1. The average size of turbine on the commercial market
will grow from 1,200 kW (1.2 MW) today to 1.4 MWby 2005, 1.5 MW by 2007 and later to 2.0 MW,depending on the increasing share of offshore devel-opments.
2. Progress ratios will decline from 0.85 to 0.90 from
2011 onwards. This takes into account improved costeffectiveness and improved design gained from R&D

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
73as well as benefits from better logistics and
“economies of scale”.
3. Improvement in the average capacity factor from
today’s 24% to 28% after 2012.
This feasibility study therefore envisages a cost reduction
in wind electricity from 3.79 e cents/kWh to a level of
3.03 ecents/kWh by 2010, assuming a cost per
installed kilowatt of e644. This is comparable with cur-
rent cost levels for combined cycle gas generation. By2020, the figure will have fallen to 2.45 
ecents per unit
of electricity produced ( e512 per kW). The year by year
cost reductions can be seen in the Appendices.
Comparison with other generation 
technologies
How do the costs of wind energy compare with other
generation technologies already in widespread use? Themost recent data (Figure 5-3) is from the annual surveyof price comparisons by specialist magazine WindpowerMonthly, published in January 2004. At current electricity
prices, this shows that the cheapest wind plants – thosewith the optimum site conditions and  economies ofscale – are now competitive with gas where the averagewind speed is above 8m/s and the investment cost isUS$ 1,000/kW. 
One other factor should be taken into account in these com-
parisons. The lower capacity factor of wind power meansthat to produce a given quantity of electricity it is necessaryto install 2-2.5 times more generating capacity than with fos-sil fuel plants. This tends to make wind energy more expen-sive in the initial phase of the life cycle. On the other handthere is no fuel cost during the lifetime of wind plant.
Wind energy costs are also expected to drop significantly
over the next two decades, as cumulative experienceThe cost per unit (kWh) of wind electricity has
already reduced dramatically as manufacturing and
other costs have fallen.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004grows. The three thermal generation technologies men-
tioned here are unlikely to get significantly cheaper thanthey are today, especially if gas becomes increasinglyscarce. A direct cost comparison also does not representthe whole picture, since it does not deal with externalities,as outlined in the next chapter.
Employment potential
The employment effect of the 12% wind energy scenariois a crucial factor to weigh alongside its other costs andbenefits. High unemployment rates continue to be a majordrain on the economies of nearly every country in theworld. Any technology which demands a substantial levelof both skilled and unskilled labour is therefore of con-siderable economic importance, and likely to featurestrongly in any political decision-making over differentenergy options.
Looking two decades ahead, it may not still be reasonable
to assume that employment will continue to be a deter-mining parameter. However, if the opposite situationshould occur – an ongoing shortage of labour – then it isimportant to know how much employment will result froma long term technological development such as this.Several assessments of the employment effects of windpower have been carried out in Germany, Denmark and theNetherlands. The most comprehensive study to date hasbeen by the Danish Wind Turbine ManufacturersAssociation (DWTMA) in 1996.
The methodology used by the DWTMA is to break down
the manufacturing activities involved in the wind turbineindustry into its different sectors – metalwork, electronicsand so on – and then add together the individual employ-
ment contributions. The results cover three areas – thedirect and indirect employment from wind turbine manu-facture, the direct and indirect employment effects ofinstalling wind turbines, and the global employmenteffects of the Danish industry’s exports business.
One good reason for using the Danish figures is that the
country’s wind turbine industry has been the most suc-cessful on the supply side, with a world market share consistently close to 50%. It is reasonable to assume,however, that the methodology will be valid for the othermain turbine manufacturing nations – Germany, Spain andthe United States.
For the purposes of this study, the latest available Danish
figures (1998) for employment are used. These show that17 job-years are created for every MW of wind energymanufactured and 5 job-years for the installation of everyMW. With the average price per kW of installed wind powerat $1,000 in 1998, these employment figures can then berelated to monetary value, showing that 22 job-years(17+5) are created by every $1 million in sales.
In order to allow for greater efficiency in design, manufac-
ture and installation – resulting in a reduction in employ-ment – it has been chosen to let the labour consumptionfollow the total value of wind power installation, a decreas-ing value over time. These indicative reductions in thelevel of employment over the period of the 12% study areshown in the Appendices.
The results of the employment assessment for the entire
implementation of the 12% scenario are shown in Figures5.4a and 5.4b. These are directly based on the assump-tions above and the actual new installation of wind powerexpected in the years 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2020. 
The years 2008 and 2012 have been chosen as the
beginning and end of the period scheduled for achieve-ment of the Kyoto Protocol targets for reduction in globalgreenhouse gas emissions (see “The EnvironmentalBenefits” and “Policy Recommendations”). As seen inFigure 5.4b, it is assumed that some regions will starttheir large scale development of wind energy later thanOECD countries already on track for major deployment.5 - 12% WIND ENERGY BY 2020
INVESTMENT, COSTS & EMPLOYMENT
The employment effect of the 12% wind power
scenario is a crucial factor to weigh alongsideits other costs and benefits.This study envisages a cost reduction in windelectricity from 3.79 e cents/kWh to a level of3.03 e cents/kWh by 2010. By 2020,the figure will have fallen to 2.45 e cents.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
75The main outcome from the scenario is that a total of
2.3 million jobs will have been created around theworld by 2020 in manufacture, installation and otherwork associated with the wind power industry.
It is also important to emphasise that a prerequisite for
the employment figures allocated by region in Figure 5.1is that the whole manufacturing process, including theupstream production and supply of the technology, is pro-vided within the region itself. Given that this is unlikely tobe a totally realistic outcome, given the present worldtrading situation, the expected local “value added” andderived employment to be obtained from the 12% sce-nario is assessed separately in the tables listing the keyfigures by region.
In Figure 5.4a, the total installation quota of wind energy
is divided by regions into periods up to 2020. For individ-ual regions, the figures can only represent a rough estimate, however, since a detailed assessment of thepenetration pattern has not been possible within the lim-its of this study. Nonetheless, the sum of each periodmakes up the total annual figure in accordance with the12% scenario (see Table 4-1).
The annual installation figures in MW are turned into
employment figures in Figure 5.4b. These “core figures”will in due course have to be corrected region by region,taking into account such issues as the actual price oflabour, manufacturing efficiency (related to the above),and the rate of import of materials or components formanufacturing the regional share of global installation.
It is also necessary to explain the difference between the
194,000 job years in Figure 5.1 and the estimated 90-100,000 jobs in the global industry today. The 90-100,000 figure is an estimate based on specific indi-vidual national data of direct and indirect employment –i.e. for primary industry and major sub-suppliers. Howeverthis estimate cannot capture every single job or part-jobcreated by wind power. The 194,000 job years is based ona statistical model comparing jobs, investment and MWwhich covers all wind-related employment.

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
79The most important environmental benefit from this scenario is a reduction in the global 
output of carbon dioxide – the major gas responsible for climate change. The annual level ofreductions will rise from 50.8 million tonnes of of CO
2in 2003 to 1,832 million tonnes in 2020.
By then the cumulative saving will have reached a total of 10,771 million tonnes.WINDFORCE12

THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS

80
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004Global carbon dioxide reductions
A reduction in the levels of carbon dioxide being 
emitted into the global atmosphere is the most important environmental benefit from wind power generation. Carbon dioxide is the gas largely respon-sible for exacerbating the greenhouse effect, leading tothe disastrous consequences of global climate change.
At the same time, modern wind technology has an
extremely good energy balance. The CO
2emissions relat-
ed to the manufacture, installation and servicing over theaverage 20 year lifecycle of a wind turbine are “paid back”after the first three to six months of operation.
The benefit to be obtained from carbon dioxide reductions
is dependent on which other generation method windpower is substituting for. Calculations by the World EnergyCouncil show a range of carbon dioxide emission levelsfor different fossil fuels (Table 6.1). On the assumptionthat coal and gas will still account for the majority of elec-tricity generation in 20 years’ time – with a continuedtrend for gas to take over from coal – it makes sense touse a figure of 600 tonnes per GWh as an average valuefor the carbon dioxide reduction to be obtained from windgeneration.
This assumption is further justified by the fact that close
to 50% of the cumulative wind generation capacity twodecades ahead, according to our scenario, will beinstalled in the OECD regions (North America, Europe andthe OECD-Pacific). The trend in these countries is for a sig-nificant shift from coal to gas. Development will start laterin other regions, but in some, the specific CO
2reduction
will be much higher due to the widespread use of ineffi-cient coal burning power stations.
Taking account of these assumptions, covering 12% of
global demand for electricity with wind power will reducecarbon dioxide emissions by the following amounts:
•Annual reductions rising from 50.8 million tonnesCO
2in 2003 to 1,832 million tonnes CO2in 2020.•By 2010, a cumulative reduction of 1,065 milliontonnes CO
2.
•By 2020, a cumulative reduction of 10,771 milliontonnes CO
2.
•By 2040, wind power will contribute an annualreduction of 5,106 million tonnes CO
2resulting in
a cumulative reduction of 88,857 million tonnesCO
2.
The effect of improved efficiency
As already explained, the improving efficiency of windtechnology is expected to follow a pattern from today’saverage capacity factor of 24% and ending up with figuresof 28% and 30% in 2012 and 2036 respectively.Expressed in terms of the benefit to an electricity utility,this is a shift from 2,000 “full-load hours” of operationper year to 2,500-2,600 full-load hours/year. Future off-shore installations are expected to perform even better –in the range of 3,000-4,000 full-load hours/year. It shouldalso be noted that wind turbines in particularly windy siteson land in Denmark, the US and the UK have alreadydemonstrated capacity factors of 30% and above.
These improvements in the technology and the growth
rates seen in the 12% scenario will make an importantcontribution to the level of CO
2-free electricity. The
Appendices show the carbon dioxide reductions from thefeasibility study calculated year by year up to 2045.
Value of carbon dioxide reductions
Many studies have been carried out to determine theabatement cost of various methods of CO
2reductions.
The general conclusion is that energy saving is often thecheapest option. When it comes to generating plant, thiswill depend on the local structure of the electricity systemand which fuel is being replaced. Studies in Denmarkhave shown that wind power replacing coal fired electricityrepresents one of the lowest CO
2abatement costs of all
options available.
A common misunderstanding in this area is that new wind
power is often compared with fossil fuel generation builtup to 30 years ago, and with its capital cost depreciatedto zero. In an electricity market under the competitive6 - 12% WIND POWER BY 2020

pressure of a deregulated market, such plant may well
deliver power at prices only a little over the variable cost.That situation will not last forever. As soon as demandgrowth calls for new capacity, wind power will be in a farbetter competitive position.
If the future improvements on cost effectiveness calculated
for this study are taken into account, then the abatementcost of substituting wind energy for fossil fuel generatedelectricity is likely to be near zero.
External costs
Direct cost comparisons of wind power and fossil fuels ornuclear power are misleading as they do not accounteither for external costs or for the intrinsic benefits result-ing from ‘embedded’ generation. Embedded generationmeans capacity, such as wind power, which is often locat-ed at the periphery of the grid distribution system, closeto local demand, and therefore both reinforces a weak dis-tribution network and reduces the cost of using the maintransmission network. 
The “external costs” to society and the environment
derived from burning fossil fuels or from nuclear genera-tion are not included in electricity prices. These costshave both a local and a global component, the formermainly related to the eventual consequences of climatechange. There is a lot of uncertainty, however, about themagnitude of such costs in monetary terms, and they aredifficult to identify and quantify. A recent European study,known as the “Extern E” project, conducted over the past10 years across all 15 EU member states, has assessedthese costs for a range of fuels. Its latest results, published in 2002, outlined the external
costs as:
nuclear       0.2 - 0.7 
ecents/kWh
gas          1 - 3 ecents/kWh
coal         2 - 15 ecents/kWh
wind power    0.15 - 0.25 ecents/kWh
The study concluded that the cost of electricity from coal
or oil would double, and that from gas increase by 30%, iftheir external costs associated with the environment andhealth were taken into account. Nuclear faces greaterexternal costs for major issues such as public liability,waste and decommissioning.

Governments face many challenges in formulating future energy policy over the coming years.
They have to respond to the need to address security of energy supply, economic growth,sustainable development, climate change, employment and technological development.Renewable energy technologies have a positive effect on all these issues. This study clearlydemonstrates that wind power is in the vanguard of the new renewable energy industries,and furthermore, it shows that there are no technological, commercial or resource limits constraining the world in meeting 12% of future global electricity demands from wind power inless than two decades.7 - POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

84
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004At a time when governments around the world are in the
process of liberalising their electricity markets, windpower’s increasing competitiveness should lead to higherdemand for wind turbines. In a report from October 2003
1
the European Wind Energy Association estimates that28% of new generation capacity installed in the EU duringthis decade (2001-2010) will be wind power, under theassumption that the clear commitments of the EU and itsMember States to wind power continue to strengthen.Without political support, however, wind power remains ata competitive disadvantage, because of distortions in theworld’s electricity markets created by decades of massivefinancial, political and structural support to conventionaltechnologies.
New wind power stations have to compete with old nuclear
and fossil fuel power stations that produce electricity atmarginal costs, because interest and depreciation on theinvestments have already been paid for by consumers andtaxpayers. Political action is needed to overcome thosedistortions, and create a level playing field in order to fullyenjoy the economic and environmental benefits of windenergy.
The following is an overview of current political frameworks
for wind power and barriers that must be overcome in orderto unlock wind power’s great potential to become a majorcontributor to global energy supply in the future.
According to a European Commission Green Paper on
Security of Energy Supply, in two decades Europe will beimporting 70% of its energy (up from 50% today) unlessEurope changes direction. Wind power can plug the gap inthe European energy supply, and at the same time con-tribute greatly to the goals set out in the EU LisbonStrategy: Sustainable economic growth, high quality jobs,technology development, global competitiveness, andEuropean industrial and research leadership. Furthermore,wind power and other renewable energy technologies willhave a large impact in meeting (Kyoto Protocol) commit-ments and contribute to sustainable development. The Commission’s Green Paper on Security of Supply
recognises this potential:
“Renewable sources of energy have a considerable
potential for increasing security of supply in Europe.Developing their use, however, will depend on extreme-ly substantial political and economic efforts. (...) In themedium term, renewables are the only source of ener-gy in which the European Union has a certain amountof room for manoeuvre aimed at increasing supply inthe current circumstances. We can not afford to neg-lect this form of energy.”
“Effectively, the only way of influencing [European ener-
gy] supply is to make serious efforts with renewablesources.”
National policies
1. Legally binding targets for renewable energy
In recent years an increasing number of countries haveestablished targets for renewable energy, as part of theirgreenhouse gas reduction policies. These are eitherexpressed as specific amounts of installed capacity or asa percentage of energy consumption.
The most ambitious target has been set by the European
Union. In 2001, the European Council and the EuropeanParliament adopted a Renewable Energy Directive estab-lishing national targets for each member country.Although these targets are not legally binding, they haveserved as a very important catalyst in initiating politicalinitiatives throughout Europe to increase renewable ener-gy’s share of electricity supply. 
The Directive aims to double renewables’ share of the
energy mix from 6% to 12% by 2010, equal to 22% ofEuropean electricity consumption. The next step forwardfrom the Directive is that the Commission should submitproposals to the European Parliament and Council formandatory renewables energy targets. Furthermore, tar-gets should be set for 2020. A time-horizon of six years isnot long in an electricity sector where the investment hori-zon is up to 40 years. 7 - POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
1 Wind Power targets for Europe: 75,000 MW by 2010The European Directive aims to double renewables’ share of the energy mix from 6% to 12% by 2010

The table below shows the national targets for electricity
supply from renewable energy in the member countrieswhich are laid down in the EU Directive as a percentage ofgross national electricity consumption. With most of thelarge hydro potential in Europe already exploited, themajority of this increase is expected to come from bio-mass and wind energy.
Setting targets does not in itself lead to any expansion of
wind power and other renewable energy sources. But, asvery well demonstrated by the indicative targets in theRenewables Directive mentioned above, they serve as avery important catalyst for governments to take actionand develop the necessary regulatory frameworks to
expand renewables such as financial frameworks, gridaccess regulation, planning and administrative procedures.
Europe has been a world leader in the development of wind
energy, as has India and some states in the United States.The development of other renewable energy technologiessuch as biomass, geothermal and solar have also had sig-nificant leadership from countries in Latin America andAsia. Because the Johannesburg World Summit onSustainable Development in 2002 was unable to agreeconcrete programmes for the development of renewables,the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition (JREC - now85 countries) was formed, and agreed to work together topursue the massive take up of renewable energy globallythat will be required to meet the challenge of climatechange as well as to help ensure access to clean andaffordable energy to the world’s poorest. Renewables2004, a conference to be convened by the German gov-ernment in Bonn from June 1-4 this year, is the first majormilestone for the JREC, and there is an expectation of newannouncements of new targets, policies and measures forthe global dissemination of renewable energy. 
Renewable energy targets are most effective if they are
based on a percentage of a nation’s total electricity con-sumption. One advantage is that this creates an incentiveto optimise turbines. If these targets are set as shortterm targets and long term mile-stones this acts as aguide to identify where immediate policy changes arerequired to achieve 5 and 10 year targets.
However, targets have little value if they are not accom-
panied by policies which achieve a level playing field inelectricity markets, eliminate market barriers and createan environment which attracts investment capital.
1.1. Specific policy mechanismsA clear market for wind generated power must be defined
in order for a project developer to enter. As with any otherinvestment, the lower the risk to the investor, the lower thecosts of supplying the product. The most important meas-ures for establishing new wind power markets are there-fore those where the market for generated power is clearlydefined in national laws, as well as providing stable, long

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004term fiscal measures, low investor risk and a sufficient
return on investment.
The main purpose of the wide range of available econom-
ic measures to encourage renewable energy technologyinvestments is to provide incentives for technologicalimprovements and cost reductions of environmental tech-nologies. That will ensure that we will have competitive,clean technologies available in the future as a competitivealternative to conventional, polluting power sources. It isless important whether markets are controlled throughprices or through quantities. What matters is that controlis achieved in a rational and effective manner.
In order to attract wind power companies to establish
manufacturing facilities, markets need to be strong, sta-ble and reliable, with a clear commitment to long-termexpansion. A number of mechanisms have been intro-duced in different countries to further these aims. 
Overall, there are two types of incentives to promote
deployment of renewable energy:1. Fixed Price Systems where the government (or the
EU) sets the electricity prices (or premiums) paid tothe producer and lets the market determine thequantity.
2. Renewable Quota Systems (in the USA referred to as
Renewable Portfolio Standards) where the govern-ment sets the quantity of renewable electricity andleaves it to the market to determine the price.
There are many variants of the fixed price system. The
term is rather misleading as not all of them actually fix thetotal price per kWh paid to the producer but for analyticalpurposes it is valuable to make a distinction betweenfixed prices and fixed quantities:1. Investment Subsidies2. Fixed Feed-in Tariffs3. Fixed Premium Systems4. Tax Credits.
Two types of renewable quota systems have been
employed in national wind power markets:1. Tendering Systems2. Green Certificate Systems.At a national level, the UK, Ireland and Australia tend to
prefer to fix quantities, while a majority of countries on theEuropean Continent lean towards fixing prices. The USA iscurrently somewhere in between with its dual system of afederal tax credit (fixed prices) and renewable quotas(fixed quantities) at the state level.
In addition to the financial mechanisms described in the
following, two other factors are crucial for the develop-ment of an overall framework for wind power investments:grid access and planning procedures.
1.2.1. Investment subsidies
Usually, investment subsidies are given on the basis of
the rated power (in kW) of the generator. If used in isola-tion, these systems can be problematic because a sub-sidy is given whether or not production is efficient. Insome countries investment subsidies have in the pastresulted in poor siting of wind turbines, and manufactur-ers followed customer demands to use larger generatorsthan necessary for optimal production of electricity. Itimproved project profitability but reduced production,because the turbines were not optimally designed. Systems that base the amount of support on generator7 - POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS


WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
87size rather than on electricity output are problematic
because they lead to less efficient technology develop-ment. Any incentive should be related to efficiency of producing power rather than efficiency in completing theconstruction phase. For wind energy, the global trend is toreject investment subsidies as the only means of encour-aging wind power investments.
However, investment subsidies can be effective if com-
bined with other incentives as in the UK. In order to takeaccount of the current higher cost of offshore wind powercompared to the more mature onshore market, the Britishgovernment offers investment grants to offshore projectsto complement the ROC (Renewable Obligation Credits)
system (a renewable quota system).
1.2.2. Fixed feed-in tariff systemsMechanisms based on fixed feed-in tariffs (FIT) have been
widely adopted throughout Europe and have proved verysuccessful in expanding wind energy in Germany, Spainand Denmark. Operators of wind farms are paid a fixedprice for every kWh of electricity they feed into the grid. InGermany, legislation fixes the price of electricity fromrenewable energy in relation to the generation costs ofrenewable technologies. The price will decrease 2% each


88
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004year. In the Spanish system the wholesale price of elec-
tricity from renewable energy follows the market price forelectricity, after which an environmental bonus is addedper kWh. A key characteristic of the fixed price system isthat the government sets a price on the societal value ofgenerating a significant share of renewable energy in theelectricity system.
As production costs decline, for instance as a result of
improved technology and economies of scale, lower wind
speed sites become profitable, expanding wind power fur-
ther. Fixed feed-in tariff systems encourage competitionamong wind turbine manufacturers, pressuring them toproduce ever more cost effective turbines and thus lowerthe cost to society of expanding wind power.
The most important advantage of fixed price systems is
that they enable investors to plan ahead for new renew-able energy plant. The challenge in a fixed price system isfixing the “right” price. The main benefit of fixed feed-in tariffs is that they aresimple and often encourage better planning. They are not associated with a formal Power Purchase
Agreement (PPA) and have no definite term. In principle,therefore, the level of the tariff can be changed at any timeor removed by repealing the Law. The disadvantage is thepolitical uncertainty that may arise over how long the sys-tem will continue, which means that investors must calcu-late a risk premium in case the price falls during the life ofthe project. Germany has been able to reduce much of thepolitical risk by guaranteeing tariffs for 20 years.
1.2.3. Fixed premium systems
A “Fixed Premium” or “Environmental Bonus” mechanism
is another variant of the fixed price system. Rather thanfixing the total price paid, the government fixes a premiumto be added to the electricity price. In principle, a mecha-nism that is based on a fixed premium/environmentalbonus that reflects the external costs of conventionalpower generation could establish fair trade, fair competi-tion and level the playing field in the Internal ElectricityMarket between renewable energy sources and conven-tional power sources. 7 - POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS


WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
89Together with taxing all power sources in accordance with
their environmental impact, fixed premium systems aretheoretically the most effective way of internalising exter-nal costs. In reality, however, fixed premiums for renewableenergy technologies, such as the Spanish model, arebased on estimated renewable electricity productioncosts and comparison with the electricity price rather thanthe environmental benefit of the renewable energy sourcecompared to conventional power technologies.
1.2.4. Tax creditsA Tax credit is another variant of the fixed price system.
Whether an incentive is given in the form of a tax credit ora cash payment does not make a big difference from asocio-economic or investor perspective. But politically itcan make a difference whether an incentive is paid by theelectricity consumer or by the taxpayer.
The largest wind power market to make use of a tax credit
is the United States. Canada is also considering intro-ducing a tax driven system. The United States market isdriven by a federal Production Tax Credit (PTC) of approxi-mately 1.8 cents per kWh. It is adjusted annually to takeinflation into account.
1.2.5. Competitive bidding, tenderingTendering systems or competitive bidding havbeen/are
used to promote wind power in Ireland, France (for windfarms larger than 12 MW) and the UK. Also Scotland andNorthern Ireland has made use of the mechanism and theDanish government is finalising a tender procedure for thefuture development of offshore wind power. 
Developers of wind farm projects are invited to bid for a
limited wind energy capacity in a given period. The com-panies that bid to supply electricity at the lowest costs winthe contracts to do so. Usually 15 to 20-year power pur-chase agreements are entered into. The difference inprice between these contracts and the price of conven-tional power represents the additional costs of producinggreen electricity. Allocation of development rights is usu-ally achieved by letting the suppliers of electricity fromrenewable energy sources (the wind turbine owners) com-pete for the power purchase agreements.The system removes much of the political risk for
investors as the price is agreed upon for a defined period,and the power purchase agreement is enforced under civillaw. However, investors are faced with another risk ele-ment under tendering. All developers that enter a bid risklosing the planning costs if the bid is not accepted or ifplanning permission is not given on the location in ques-tion. Therefore, the model may be better suited for largeprojects than small ones.
Furthermore, the method tends to only encourage devel-
opment of the most economic (windy) sites. From an elec-tricity systems integration point of view, a reasonable geo-graphical spread of wind power is a clear advantage, as itreduces the balancing costs of the system.
One of the major drawbacks of the tenders made so far,
e.g. in the UK, has been that they have encouraged ‘gam-ing’ of the system. Renewable energy technologies getcheaper over time. Therefore, a contract holder will waitas long as possible to build a project. Partly because ofthis inherent flaw, the British NFFO (Non-Fossil FuelObligation) tender system did not result in many projectsbeing built. Another flaw of the NFFO model was that it didnot penalise developers if they failed to install the capac-ity for which they had secured a power purchase contract.Therefore, the model should be combined with a perform-ance bond and meaningful penalties for failing to meetthe contract.
Tendering systems with high penalty clauses appear to be
economically efficient, but they are probably only workablefor large investors, and not smaller operators such as co-operatives or individual owners, at least not unless theyare part of a larger risk-sharing arrangement through ajoint project organisation. Experience has shown that theaggressive competition created for lowest price leavesonly small margins that will deter investors and forcedevelopers to use only the highest wind resource sites.
1.2.6. Tradable green certificatesA tradable Green Certificate Systems (TGC) is, in principle,
the same as the tendering system described above. Themain difference is that the price for the power and certifi-cates are settled on a daily basis on the electricity market

90
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004alongside a separate market for tradable certificates
(tendering systems are typically based on 15-20 yearpower purchase agreements). With daily settling of pricesthe TGC model is more risky for the investor unless aneffective market for long-term certificates contracts (prob-ably financial futures or options) is developed. 
Under a TGC system, the government sets a specific and
gradually increasing quantity – or minimum limit – for theamount of renewable electricity in the supply portfolio. Anobligation is placed on either the electricity suppliers orend users of electricity. The generators (producers),wholesalers, retailers or consumers (depending who isobligated in the electricity supply chain) are obligated tosupply / consume a certain percentage of electricity fromrenewable energy sources. At the settlement date, theyhave to submit the required number of certificates todemonstrate compliance. 
The TGC mechanism is more complex in nature than other
payment mechanisms. Wind turbine operators will have tobe active in two interrelated financial markets: one forTGCs and one for power. One of the challenges in devel-oping such systems is that there seems to be an asym-metry between the demand and the supply side in themarkets. Wind turbine owners would prefer to have aslong contracts as possible to minimise risk, while the elec-tricity companies on the demand side seem to prefershort contracts. 
Another aspect to consider is whether all renewables
technologies should be included in a single »umbrella cer-tificate« or whether a certificate for each technology is theanswer. One certificate only ensures development of thecheapest renewable energy technology, while several cer-tificates will result in markets with dangerously low liquid-
ity, at least in the beginning of development.
As with the auction / tender model, it is important to intro-
duce penalties for not purchasing green certificates thatare sufficiently high to deter non-compliance. 
One drawback of a system with fixed quantities of renew-
ables is that the speed with which they are introduced intothe electricity supply system is largely independent of tech-nical progress and the increasing efficiency of using renew-ables, and hence could become a cap on development.
1.3. Emissions capsWhereas taxation provides a pre-defined cost, much like
the tariff system, an emissions cap can set a standard forthe industry, but leave it to the market to decide how bestto comply with the standard. This can also allow for theintroduction of energy saving measures which are oftencheaper than new low emission generating capacity. TheKyoto Protocol is a system based on emissions caps,although it does allow for the use of flexible mechanismsthat effectively raise the level of the emissions cap withinan individual national territory.
Emission trading is an effective and potentially powerful
tool to meet targets for emissions of greenhousegasses. But its limitations must be recognised. It willnot fully internalise external costs – a condition for alevel playing field between polluting and clean technolo-gies. The philosophy behind emissions trading is thatgreenhouse gas reductions should be made at the low-est possible cost to society. However, it is important toacknowledge that the cheapest solution in the short run
7 - POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS


WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
91is not necessarily the cheapest long-term solution. In
fact it is unlikely to be so.
If we take on a short-term approach to combating climate
change, and only focus on once-in-a-lifetime solutionssuch as shifts from coal to natural gas (fuel-switching); oronly focus on (very necessary but insufficient) energy effi-ciency measures such as installing thermostats and insu-lating buildings, we risk creating a gap in the technologi-cal development of those new and renewable energysources that are a precondition for combating climatechange at the lowest possible cost in the long run. 
Therefore emissions trading should not be seen 
as a substitute for environmental taxes or policies topromote renewable energy.
The main goal of policies to promote renewables should
not be only to reduce emissions here and now (althoughit is a pleasant side-effect). The main purpose should beto develop clean technologies and ensure that renewableenergy in the future can become a fully competitive sourceof power, which will secure a clean, cheap and indigenousenergy supply in the future.
2. Defined and stable returns for investors
Policy measures adopted by governments need to beacceptable to the requirements of the investment com-munity in order to be effective.
There are two key issues:
•The price for renewable power must allow for risk-
return profiles that are competitive with other invest-ment options.•The duration of a project must allow investors torecoup their investment.
3. Electricity market reform
Essential reforms in the electricity sector are necessary ifnew renewable energy technologies are to be accepted ata larger scale. These reforms include:
3.1. Removal of electricity sector barriers to renewablesCurrent energy legislation on planning, certification and
grid access has been built around the existence of largecentralised power plants, including extensive licensingrequirements and specifications for access to the grid. 
This favours existing large scale electricity production and
represents a significant market barrier to renewables.Furthermore it does not recognise the value of not havingto transport decentralised power generation over largedistances. 
Legislation needs to reflect the following recent changes:
In technology: renewables and gas generation have
emerged as the fastest growing electricity generationtechnologies.In fuels: coal and nuclear power are becoming increas-
ingly less competitive.In size: small modular renewable and gas generating
plants are now producing competitively priced power.In location: the new modular technologies can be dis-
tributed throughout a network. In environmental and social impacts: fossil fuel and
nuclear power sources are now widely acknowledgedto cause local and regional environmental and social


92
WIND FORCE 12 - May 20047 - POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
impacts; fossil fuels also have global impacts on the
climate.
Another major barrier is the short to medium term surplus
electricity generating capacity in Europe. The costs of pro-ducing wind power are falling, but still need special provi-sions. Due to overcapacity in the electricity market, it isstill cheaper to burn more coal or gas in an existing powerplant than to build, finance and depreciate a new windpower plant. The effect is that, even in those situationswhere a new technology, such as wind power, would befully competitive with new coal or gas fired power plants,the investment will not be made. Until we reach a situa-tion where new capacity is needed and electricity pricesstart reflecting the cost of investing in new capacity ratherthan the marginal cost of existing capacity, support torenewable energies has to level the playing field in theabsence of internalisation of external costs.
Other barriers include the lack of long term planning at
national, regional and local level; lack of integratedresource planning; lack of integrated grid planning andmanagement; lack of predictability and stability in themarkets; no legal framework for international bodies ofwater; grid ownership of vertically integrated companiesand a lack of long-term R&D funding.
Furthermore there is a complete absence of grids for off-
shore wind power; weak or non-existing grids onshore; lit-tle recognition of the economic benefits of embedded/dis-tributed generation; effective separation of transmissionand distribution grids from vertically integrated utilitieshas not happened leading to obscure and discriminatoryrequirements for grid access that do not reflect the natureof the technology.
The reforms needed to address market barriers to renew-
ables include:
Streamlined and uniform planning procedures and per-mitting systems and integrated least cost networkplanning;Fair access to the grid at fair, transparent prices andremoval of discriminatory access and transmission tariffs;Fair and transparent pricing for power throughout anetwork, with recognition and remuneration for thebenefits of embedded generation;Unbundling of utilities into separate generation and
distribution companies;The costs of grid infrastructure development and rein-forcement must be carried by the grid managementauthority rather than individual renewable energy projects;Disclosure of fuel mix and environmental impact toend users to enable consumers to make an informedchoice of power source.
3.2. Removal of market distortionsIn addition to market barriers there are also market dis-
tortions which block the expansion of renewable energy.These distortions are in the form of direct and indirectsubsidies, and the social cost of externalities currentlyexcluded from costs of traditional, polluting electricityfrom nuclear and fossil fuels. 
A major barrier preventing wind power from reaching its
full potential is the fundamental lack of pricing structuresin the energy markets that reflect the full costs to societyof producing energy.
Furthermore, the overall electricity market framework is
very different today from the one existing when coal, gas,and nuclear technologies were introduced. For most of acentury, power generation has been characterized bynational monopolies with mandates to finance invest-ments in new production capacity through state subsidiesand/or levies on electricity bills. As many countries aremoving in the direction of more liberalised electricity mar-kets, those options are no longer available, which put newgenerating technologies, such as wind power, at a com-petitive disadvantage relative to existing technologies.
3.2.1. End subsidies to fossil fuel and nuclear power
sources 
Conventional energy sources receive an estimated
$250-300 billion in subsidies per year worldwide, andtherefore markets are heavily distorted. TheWorldwatch Institute estimates that total world coalsubsidies are $63 billion, whilst in Germany alone thetotal is $21 billion, including direct support of morethan $85,000 per miner. 

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
93Subsidies artificially reduce the price of power, keep
renewables out of the market place, and prop up increas-ingly uncompetitive technologies and fuels.
Eliminating direct and indirect subsidies to fossil fuels
and nuclear power would help move us toward a level play-ing field across the energy sector. As the 1998 OECDstudy “Improving the Environment through ReducingSubsidies” noted: “Support is seldom justified and gener-
ally deters international trade, and is often given to ailingindustries. …support may be justified if it lowers the long-term marginal costs to society as a whole. This may be thecase with support to ‘infant industries’, such as producersof renewable energy.”
The 2001 report of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force
goes further, stating that “re-addressing them [subsidies]
and making even a minor re-direction of these considerablefinancial flows toward renewables, provides an opportunityto bring consistency to new public goals and to includesocial and environmental costs in prices.” The Task Force
recommends that “G8 countries should take steps to
remove incentives and other supports for environmentallyharmful energy technologies, and develop and implementmarket-based mechanisms that address externalities,enabling renewable energy technologies to compete in themarket on a more equal and fairer basis.”
Wind power would not need special provisions if markets
were not distorted by the fact that it is still virtuallyfree for electricity producers to pollute. 
Subsidies to fully competitive and polluting technologies
are highly unproductive, seriously distort markets andincrease the need to support renewables. Removing sub-sidies to conventional electricity would not only save tax-payers’ money and reduce current market distortions inthe electricity market. It would also dramatically reducethe need for renewables support. 
3.2.2. Internalise the social and environmental costs of
polluting energy
The real cost of energy production by conventional energy
includes expenses absorbed by society, such as healthimpacts and local and regional environmental degradation


94
WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004– from mercury pollution to acid rain – as well as global
impacts from climate change. More than 30,000 Americansdie prematurely every year due to emissions from electricpower plants, for example. Hidden costs also include thewaiving of nuclear accident insurance that is too expen-sive to be covered by the nuclear operators. The Price-Anderson Act, for instance, limits the liability of USnuclear power plants in the case of an accident to a sub-sidy of up to $3.4 billion annually.
Environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at
source. Translated into energy generation that wouldmean that, ideally, production of energy should not polluteand that it is the energy producers’ responsibility to pre-vent it. If they do pollute they should pay an amount equalto the damage the production causes to society as awhole.
The environmental impacts of electricity generation can be
difficult to quantify, though. How do we put a price on losthomes on Pacific Islands as a result of melting icecaps,deteriorating health or the visual impact of a wind turbine?An ambitious project, funded by the EuropeanCommission - ExternE – has tried to quantify the truecosts, including environmental costs of electricity genera-tion. It estimates that the cost of producing electricityfrom coal or oil would double and the cost of electricityproduction from gas would increase by 30 %, if externalcosts, in the form of damage to the environment andhealth, were taken into account. 
The study further estimates that these costs amount to 
1-2 % of EU GDP or between Euro 85 billion and Euro 170billion, not including the cost of global warming and cli-mate change. If those environmental costs were levied onelectricity generation according to their impact, manyrenewables, including wind power, would not need any sup-port. If, at the same time, direct and indirect subsidies tofossil fuels and nuclear power were removed, the need tosupport renewable electricity generation would seriouslydiminish or cease to exist.
As with the other subsidies, such external costs must be
factored into energy pricing if the market is to be trulycompetitive. This requires that governments apply a “pol-luter pays” system that charges the emitters accordingly,or applies suitable compensation to non-emitters.
Adoption of polluter pays taxation to polluting electricitysources, or equivalent compensation to renewable energysources, and exclusion of renewables from environmentrelated energy taxation, is important to achieve fairer com-petition on the world’s electricity markets.
International policies
1. Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol
Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change is a first vitalstep towards protecting the climate from dangerousanthropogenic climate change – the overall goal of theClimate Convention. The Protocol as a legally bindinginternational instrument heralds the beginning of carbon-constrained economies. This will mean an increaseddemand for low and no carbon power production.Protecting the climate will demand more and deeper cutsin greenhouse gas emissions which will further increasethe demand and market for renewable energy technolo-gies such as wind power.
2. Reform of Export Credit Agencies (ECAs),
Multi-lateral Development Banks (MDBs) andInternational Finance Institutions (IFIs)
Demand for energy, particularly electricity, is increasing
worldwide. This is especially the case in developing coun-tries, which rely heavily on export credit agencies andmulti-lateral development banks to provide financing forenergy and other industrial projects. To be consistent withthe emerging international regime for limiting greenhousegas emissions, ECAs and other international financialinstitutions which support or underwrite projects aroundthe world must have policies consistent with the need forlimiting greenhouse gas emissions and climate changeprotection. At the same time there needs to be a transi-tion plan and flexible timeframes to avoid undue hard-ships on developing country economies overly reliantupon conventional energy sources and exports, whilstalso recognising that meeting the development goals forthe world’s poorest will require subsidies for the foresee-able future.7 - POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

WIND FORCE 12 - May 2004
95The G8 Task Force report, whilst acknowledging the role of
international finance institutions and ECAs, makes signif-icant recommendations that would go some way to address-ing this issue. It states: “Modern energy access and envi-
ronmental considerations should be integrated into theIFIs’ energy sector dialogue and investment programmes.Thus current instruments and agency programmes shouldbe adapted to provide increased support for renewableenergy projects which, although economically attractive,may be small and have long pay back periods. Guaranteefunds, refinancing schemes for local banks, ad hoc loanfacilities to local small private operators, should be consid-ered in this respect.”
In addition, the report recommends that “the G8 should
extend so-called ‘sector arrangements’ for energy lendingto renewables and develop and implement common envi-ronmental guidelines among the G8 Export Credit Agencies(ECAs). This could include: identifying criteria to assessenvironmental impacts of ECA-financed projects, and estab-
lishing minimum standards of energy-efficiency or carbon-intensity for these projects; developing a common reportingmethodology for ECAs to permit assessment of their localand global environmental impacts.”
Finally, note should be made of the recommendations of
the World Bank’s Extractive Industries Review, which iscurrently before the Bank for consideration. The Reviewwas set up by the Bank, and the recommendations call forsweeping reform of the Bank’s lending policies in the ener-gy sector, including a phase out of support for fossil fuelbased energy.
Policies to address these issues must include:
• A defined and increasing percentage of overall energy-
sector lending directed to renewable energy projects.
• A rapid phase out of support for conventional, pollut-
ing energy projects.
