REUSABLES ARE  DOABL E   |  2

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped how people think
about health and safety. In response, people around the world
have stocked up on soaps, sanitizers, and disinfectant sprays,
distanced themselves from friends and family, and limited
trips to stores and restaurants. And in response to worker
and customer concerns and an onslaught of plastic industry
propaganda, plastic bans have been paused and reusables
have been restricted in many locations.1

As retail establishments and restaurants reopen, and as
COVID-19 cases continue to rise, it is imperative that reuse
and refill systems are implemented that both protect
our environment and alleviate any worker and customer
concerns. The pandemic cannot be an excuse to move back
to an era of widespread disposables, as our environment and
the world’s most vulnerable communities will suffer most.
The plastics industry continues to fight to ensure single-use
plastics are prevalent into the future;2 however, its lobbying
ignores the impacts of refineries and incinerators on low-
income communities and people of color and the cost of
increased plastic pollution to our oceans and increasingly
impacted communities around the world.

Thankfully, communities and businesses worldwide have
started building reuse and refill systems that protect our
environment and impacted communities, while also ensuring
that sanitization programs instill confidence in reusables for
shoppers and workers alike.3 4 5 6 7 The climate crisis, fueled in

part by plastic production, is not slowing down. Businesses
and governments must continue to think creatively and invest
in robust reuse and refill systems. The pandemic cannot be an
excuse for businesses or governments to maintain the status
quo and continue to exacerbate the plastic pollution and
climate crises. It is time to turn the page toward something
better.

Over the last few years, the plastic pollution crisis has entered
the forefront of people’s minds. Images of beaches filled with
plastic, videos of animals choking on straws and bags, and
growing awareness about the ocean gyres helped to create
a new generation of anti-plastic activists. As that outrage
continues to grow over the dangers of plastic, people have
increasingly connected the dots to the fossil fuel industry.8 9

The same companies that are destroying

our climate are rapidly expanding

petrochemical facilities to increase

profits from single-use plastics and

exploiting low-income and Black and

Brown communities.10 11

It is time to stop treating people and the planet as
disposable.12 To save our climate and ensure healthy
communities for everyone, we must end our reliance on
cheap throwaway plastics.

whom are working without
adequate protections or benefits
while putting their lives on the
line. Retail and food workers
deserve better, and should feel
safe and be protected. Out of
an abundance of caution for
workers, occupational safety
experts have encouraged people
to bag their own groceries and
handle their own reusables.22
And most approved household
disinfectants have proven
effective at eliminating the virus
from hard surfaces, including
reusables.23 24 It is incumbent
upon all of us to wear a mask,
keep our distance from others,
and employ good hygiene
to keep ourselves and everyone
else safe.

What is good for our environment can and must also be
good for workers, and these are the solutions we need to
embrace. In the middle of a pandemic, we should not need
to throw out the progress that has been made on protecting
the environment and vulnerable communities from plastic
pollution. Reuse and refill systems can instill confidence in the
safety and cleanliness of products. Businesses, policymakers,
the press, and scientists have an opportunity to demonstrate
how existing sanitization protocols, and any modifications
to reusable applications, are helping keep workers and
customers safe. All over the world, these systems are already
working. Some companies like Loop have even reported
seeing sales increases during the pandemic.25

We cannot turn back the clock to an era of polluting single-
use plastics. Now is the time to reassure customers that reuse
and refill systems can be used safely in a time of uncertainty.
The following examples illustrate that reuse and refill systems
can work in our new reality and should provide a model to
build off of. If governments require or businesses turn to
widespread disposables, the world will face more plastic
pollution, increased forest destruction, and worsened climate
change, and the exploitation and harm to communities
on the frontlines of fossil fuel extraction, petrochemical
and plastic production, and plastics incineration and
landfilling will continue. Reuse and refill systems, when
implemented correctly, can keep people safe and help to end
our throwaway culture. Companies and governments must
continue to move forward, not slip back toward throwaway
models from before the pandemic that harm current and
future generations.

Before the pandemic, cities, states, and countries were
increasingly moving to ban unnecessary single-use plastics,
recognizing the toll that this polluting industry has had on
people and our environment. While many of those bans
remain in place, particularly internationally, in the U.S. it has
been a different story.

In a widespread PR push, the plastics industry misrepresented
older, industry-funded studies to claim that reusables are
more dangerous than disposable plastic, influencing decision-
makers and leading to some governments pausing plastic
bans.13 Many local and state governments have said publicly
that these moves will be temporary, and some states are
reinstating previous, or moving forward with new, plastics
bans (e.g., California, Massachusetts, Vermont).14 15 16 But
the plastics industry has worked to ban plastic bans with
preemption legislation for years, and will fight to keep them in
place following the pandemic.17 18

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), “it may be possible that a person can get
COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus
on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
their eyes,”19 but “transmission of novel coronavirus to
persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not
been documented.”20 In a grocery store full of people, or other
operations such as foodservice, disposable plastics are not
inherently safer than reusables.21

We must do everything possible to alleviate concerns of
retail and food workers during the pandemic, many of

Trust Science and Sanitization

The U.S. and world are at a turning point, as COVID-19 cases
continue to increase and some governments have offered
nonsensical and dangerous responses to the pandemic
(e.g., reopening businesses too soon,26 politicizing public
health measures like wearing a mask27). There is a risk that
this same disregard for science will dissuade action on
the public health and environmental impacts of single-use
plastics.

Adherence to science and public

health recommendations is not and

should never be a political action or

weaponized by exploitative politicians

or corporations during a pandemic.

Adherence to science is common sense and will help protect
our global society and current and future generations.

Recent research shows that COVID-19 lives the longest
on plastic and stainless steel surfaces.28 29 With so much
disposable plastic being doled out in retail and food
businesses nationwide, the argument from industry
lobbyists that single-use is safer just doesn’t hold up.

On June 22, Greenpeace USA and UPSTREAM released a
letter now signed by 130 public health and medical experts
from 20 countries agreeing that reusables can be used
safely during the pandemic by employing basic hygiene
and contactless systems.30

Retailers, foodservice operators, and consumer goods
companies already have strict sanitization protocols to
maintain proper hygiene and prioritize food safety, including
those employing reuse and refill systems. On a recent webinar
about reuse during the pandemic, TerraCycle and Loop CEO
Tom Szaky said, “We are inherently swimming in reuse.” He
noted that people already trust dentists and the medical
industry to sanitize medical equipment before it is reused.31
That same trust is and must continue to be bestowed on
companies and restaurants to sanitize reusables, and
businesses and governments have a role in educating the
public about the safety of reuse.

While an abundance of caution is necessary to protect people
from COVID-19, we cannot allow the greedy, opportunistic,
dangerous plastics and fossil fuel industries to exploit a
pandemic for financial gain by promoting disposable plastic
packaging when reuse is a present and viable alternative.

Reusable Systems Already Exist,
and Are Growing

Reuse isn’t a new idea. Before the surge of throwaway plastics
that began in the mid-twentieth century, reusable bottles
and containers were a key component of everyday life. As
concerns grow about the impacts of throwaway plastics
(and other single-use materials) on communities and our
planet, reuse is seeing a resurgence globally, from savvy
entrepreneurs to major global brands.

There are four basic reuse models: refill at home, refill on the
go, return from home, and return on the go. The following
graphics are based on the Ellen MacArthur Foundation report:
Reuse — Rethinking Packaging.32 The examples of reuse are
also from this report.

REUSABLES ARE  DOABL E   |  5

Examples of refill at home:

Examples of return from home:

	| E-commerce for compact refill products that are used
at home or in office buildings on a regular basis (e.g.
beverages, home care, personal care).

	| Traditional retail outlets for standard-sized, non-

compact refill products (e.g., home care, personal care).

	| E-commerce for products such as groceries, meal
delivery, personal care, home care, and skin care.

Examples of refill on the go:

Examples of return on the go:

	| Traditional retail outlets for products like beverages,
cooking essentials (e.g., grains, flours, oils), personal
care, and home care.

	| Traditional retail outlets for beverages where the model
has been proven to work at scale in several geographies
(e.g., Latin America, Japan, Europe).

	| Cities for coffee-to-go or water fountains.

	| Cities and events for products on-the-go such as

takeaway coffee, beverages, and food.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation notes six benefits of reuse
for businesses: cut costs, adapt to individual needs, optimize
operations, build brand loyalty, improve user experience,
and gather intelligence on user preferences and system
performance.33 A new wave of innovative reuse and refill
systems already exists, and some are seeing growth even
amid a pandemic. Many organizations—including the
Ellen MacArthur Foundation,34 Greenpeace,35 Oceana,36
Oceanic Global,37 Post Landfill Action Network,38 39 ReThink
Disposable,40 the Surfrider Foundation,41 and UPSTREAM42—
have documented myriad examples of reuse systems and
their benefits.

While businesses must invest significantly more into reuse
and refill systems, some are finally getting involved and
systems are scaling up. Loop, launched in 2019, is perhaps
one of the best known.43 The company ships products to
customers in reusable packaging and containers that are then
returned, cleaned, and refilled, and is expanding throughout
the U.S. and into global markets, working with big brands
from Kroger to Walgreens, Tesco, Unilever, and Procter &
Gamble. Loop,44 like other third-party reuse businesses to
foodservice operators and retailers, adheres to regulations
based on FDA guidelines for sanitization,45 which ensure
the safety of reuse systems for workers and customers.

REUSABLES ARE  DOABL E   |  6

Algramo, which uses both vending machines and delivery
models for refill, has expanded markedly in Chile.46 47 In the
U.S., Ecopod offers a similar vending machine refill format
for personal care and cleaning products.48 Even Nestlé, a
laggard in many ways in response to the global movement to
break free from plastic,49 has begun piloting reuse and refill
operations with vendors like Algramo, Loop, and MIWA.50
However, the plastic pollution crisis requires so much more
than pilots. Large consumer goods companies, from Nestlé to
Unilever, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo, must urgently act to ramp
up reuse and refill systems and ditch single-use packaging.

Governments and businesses should learn from the existing
infrastructure of successful reuse programs, such as
Dabbawalas: For 130 years, this reusable food delivery system
for lunches has worked in India. Startups such as The Wally
Shop in the U.S.,51 inspired by Dabbawalas,52 are bringing a
reuse model to new markets with an emphasis on groceries.

Many to-go reuse models are for cups and/or containers, such
as CupClub,53 Vessel,54 and Muuse,55 which can be used at
participating vendors. Customers pay for the cup or container
with a deposit and return it after use for a clean one. This
obviates the need for disposables and prioritizes sanitization.

And while third-party services with sanitization systems
may seem like the only option amid a pandemic, bringing
your own cups and containers is still a viable choice with
the proper contactless protocols (e.g., City to Sea,56 Plastic
Free Places,57 Takeaway Throwaways58). In 2019, California
amended its Retail Food Code with protocols for businesses
to safely fill customers’ reusable food and beverage
containers, emphasizing contactless refill methods.59 As
several businesses employing these systems adapt to address
concerns of their workers and customers, larger companies
should develop similar contactless protocols for reuse and
refill that prioritize safety with bring-your-own container
models. Some large corporations are starting to. On August 7,
Starbucks reinstated reusable cups in its Europe, Middle East,
and Africa markets—it must now do the same in the U.S. and
throughout its worldwide operations.60

Drawing from a wealth of public health and business
guidance, NGOs Post Landfill Action Network,61 62 Oceanic
Global,63 the Surfrider Foundation,64 and UPSTREAM65 recently
released reopening guidelines, which prioritize sanitization
and best practices to ensure health and safety while also
prioritizing reuse systems. They note that some governments
have officially promoted reusables during the pandemic. In
Singapore, government officials have encouraged customers
to bring their own containers, recognizing the massive
environmental and public health risks of a surge in disposable
plastics.66 The government of Victoria, Australia, states there
“is currently no evidence to suggest there is any benefit to

switching to disposables.”67 And some government entities
and trade groups offer contradicting advice in response to the
pandemic: In the U.S., the CDC68 and the National Restaurant
Association69 lead with a recommendation to use disposables;
however, they also acknowledge that reusables are an option
with proper sanitization.

Bulk food is another simple, cost-effective way to minimize
packaging and promote reuse. Many smaller grocers are
continuing to offer bulk food sections, and some customers
and reporters are asking questions about their safety.70 As
noted earlier, with proper hygiene (e.g., washing hands,
disinfecting surfaces) workers and customers can reduce the
risk of COVID-19 transmission. Gravity-fed dispensers (which
already exist to some degree in many U.S. retail locations such
as Whole Foods and WinCo Foods) ensure customers cannot
reach into the dispenser. For those looking to innovate bulk
food sections, there are new models like MIWA, a third-party
refill system that provides smart-enabled containers for
customers,71 who can then take the containers home and
reuse at in-store kiosks.

New Reuse Opportunities for
Foodservice and Retail

The foodservice industry has undergone significant changes in
response to COVID-19. Many restaurants have shifted to pickup
or to-go orders only. And some institutional foodservice
operators are shifting to providing meals in pre-packaged
containers or delivered by robots, rather than in cafeteria lines
or walk-up service counters in dining halls.72 These modified
operations ensure social distancing and protect both workers
preparing and serving meals, and customers. However, along
with these changes, many foodservice operators have opted for
disposable packaging, which is fueling the plastic pollution crisis,
rather than shifting toward reusables.73 74 In response, nearly
130 organizations and thousands of people are calling for less
plastic from food delivery services like DoorDash and Grubhub.75

Alternatives exist. San Francisco-based Dispatch Goods works
with local businesses that provide their to-go meals in reusable
containers. Customers pick up their meals in reusable stainless
steel containers from the restaurant; when they are finished,
they notify Dispatch Goods, which collects the containers from
customers and washes them for the next use at a participating
business.76 Placing advanced orders with local restaurants helps
provide business to operators who can plan for the number of
meals to make and staff hours needed, given significant layoffs
industry-wide.77 Foodservice operators could also use models
like Fresh Bowl, which provides prepared meals in reusable
glass jars provided with a small deposit that customers purchase
via vending machines.78 In addition to eliminating disposable
containers for to-go meals, it builds brand loyalty when
customers return their container for cleaning and either receive
a deposit refund or use that money for their next meal purchase.

There are many resources and protocols for contactless
systems for menus, payment, reuse, and refill. In the UK,
City to Sea provides guidance for businesses to safely refill a
customer’s cup (the graphic above is based on the City to Sea
model);79 in Australia, Plastic Free Places provides guidelines
for reusable to-go containers and bags;80 and in New Zealand,
the Takeaway Throwaways campaign offers examples of
contactless systems and vendors employing reuse.81

During the pandemic, some retailers like Costco and Kroger
have permitted customers to bring in reusable bags, unless
prohibited by local or state mandates, and many retailers that
permit reusable bags ask customers to bag items themselves.
Regional grocery retailers like MOM’s Organic Market are
keeping their bulk sections open, where customers can bring
their own clean containers for a variety of products.82

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is investing billions of
dollars for in-store and online innovations of its Canadian
operations83 and, in the U.S., is rolling out Walmart+, an online
delivery service that will compete with Amazon.84 But Walmart
has yet to demonstrate the same level of investment in reuse
and refill necessary to markedly reduce its enormous single-use
plastic footprint. As more customers opt for grocery delivery or
curbside pickup, retailers are seeing marked growth in revenues
due to increased spending amid the pandemic85 86 and are
launching new initiatives. Walmart and other large retailers
clearly have the resources and must reduce their single-use
plastic (and other single-use material) footprints by investing
in reuse and refill and packaging-free delivery systems.
Several models are already available, through a growing
number of startups (e.g., Loop,87 The Wally Shop,88 Zero89).

Demand Environmental Justice
and Good Jobs

With more than 2,000 organizations and growing, the global
Break Free From Plastic movement90 has been making waves
among governments, businesses, and the public. Millions
of people are demanding an end to single-use plastics,
businesses and governments are beginning to phase out
single-use plastics, tens of thousands of news stories are
appearing every year about plastic pollution, and in 2018,
single-use was named the word of the year.91

The plastics and fossil fuel industries know that their time of
pushing toxic, throwaway plastics on communities and the
planet is coming to an end. As more businesses reopen and the
threat of more COVID-19 cases continues, we also face the
persistent threats of the plastic pollution crisis and climate
change, neither of which will resolve themselves without
marked action from governments, businesses, and civil society.
Another significant threat is massive economic hardships
from COVID-19, which will continue to put workers, families,
and communities at risk. These crises are connected, and the
impacts on all of us are exacerbated by corporate greed.

This is a moment to say NO to plastics

and fossil fuel corporate giants, and YES

to a just, clean, sustainable future that

provides good-paying union jobs and the

services communities need to thrive.

While globally the scale of reuse and refill systems is far
too small to currently offset the tidal wave of single-use
packaging, the great news is there are examples of scaled or
scalable technologies that, with the proper investments and
consistent standards, will become the new norm for product
delivery. And while we need to improve broken recycling and
waste management systems, the public and lawmakers are
no longer accepting the decades-old greenwashing tactics
companies have used (e.g., claiming that recycling is the
answer)92 to avoid taking responsibility for their contribution
to the plastic pollution crisis.93 Thus, it is imperative that
companies invest significantly in reuse and refill and cross-
sector collaboration, to create the reuse and refill systems of
the future that put people and the planet first.

Communities and workers deserve safe, affordable, and
accessible reuse and refill systems that avoid destructive
throwaway packaging, as outlined by Break Free From
Plastic’s Just Recovery Principles.94

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates at least a $10 billion
economic opportunity by replacing just 20% of single-use
plastic packaging with reusable alternatives.95 Given the scale
of this opportunity, reusable systems must invest in local
economies, creating good union jobs in several sectors (e.g.,
manufacturing, distribution, retail, foodservice, food delivery).
As innovations in reuse and refill continue, workers must be
part of the equation. Amid the pandemic, companies may be
saving money from layoffs or shifting to contactless services,
or finding new revenue streams, particularly in retail as more
people buy in bulk and prepare their own meals. Companies
must develop transition plans that maintain jobs and apply
cost savings and profits from any modified operations to pay
living wages and benefits to their frontline workers.

Far too many corporate giants in retail, foodservice, and other
sectors have feigned concern for workers providing essential
services with feel-good PR campaigns and small, short-lived
pay bumps that have been revoked in some cases after
certain periods of time.96 97 Retail behemoths like Walmart and
Amazon have inconsistently reported COVID-19 cases, leading
workers to track cases themselves,98 99 100 and to document
and demand action from Walmart via an exempt solicitation
filed by United for Respect and Majority Action.101 And some,
such as Amazon, have even fired workers who organized
to speak out about the health and death risks warehouse
workers face during COVID-19.102 103 104

REUSABLES ARE  DOABL E   |  9

Workers responsible for the production,
preparation, and distribution of the food and
products used every day are essential, and they
require more than savvy talking points from
corporate PR experts. Premium wages, health and
safety protections (e.g., see UFCW,105 Teamsters,106
UNITE HERE107), universal paid sick leave and
family and medical leave, hazard pay, childcare,
and protections for collective bargaining
agreements are some of the benefits each of these
workers needs immediately.

In addition to necessary changes

within their own companies,

business leaders must support

efforts in Congress for an Essential

Worker Bill of Rights.108 109

Even though some forms of expanded use of PPE are
obviously necessary in light of the COVID-19 pandemic,
our society has an obligation to grapple with the impacts
of increased plastic production and disposal, especially
as they land hardest on low-income and Black and Brown
communities. The pandemic has led to a surge of demand
for some single-use plastics like grocery bags and PPE, as
well as new applications of other plastics like protective
shields at retail locations. Despite these short-term surges
in demand, overall the global plastics and petrochemical
industries are seeing reduced demand. The oil industry has
been in massive decline, exacerbated by the pandemic, an oil
price war, increased market share of renewables, institutional
divestment from the oil and gas sectors amid massive debt,
and concerns about plastic pollution.110 And despite major
growth plans and investments in a global petrochemical
buildout, uncertainty remains.111

What is certain is the continued environmental and public
health impacts of petrochemical facilities (existing and those
being built) and of fossil fuel extraction and plastics disposal
from incinerators to landfills,112 113 not to mention the marked
increase in plastic pollution from single-use PPE114 115 116 and
the health and climate impacts of incinerating PPE.117 Low-
income and Black and Brown communities, like those living
in Cancer Alley118 or Death Alley,119 including St. James Parish
and Mossville, Louisiana, and the Houston petrochemical
corridor, continue to face the worst impacts of these extractive
industries,120 121 and are at the same time disproportionately
impacted by COVID-19.122 123 124 This must change.

If governments and businesses are truly serious about
reviving the economy, protecting communities, and giving
our planet a fighting chance to heal from the plastic pollution

crisis and existential dangers of climate change, investing in
and markedly expanding reuse and refill systems will help
eliminate throwaway packaging and can create new union
jobs. They must also support low-income communities and
communities of color that have been exploited by the fossil
fuel and plastics industries. Reuse systems must be accessible
and affordable, especially for customers and businesses in
low-income communities. And reusable containers must be
made from safer materials and avoid toxic plastics (e.g., PVC,
polystyrene, polycarbonate which can leach bisphenol A)125 126
127 and toxic additives and contaminants that may be present
(e.g., flame retardants in recycled plastics,128 lead in glass129
and ceramics130).

Conclusion: We Still Need to
Eliminate Single-Use Plastics

A pandemic has transformed life as we know it. More
and more, we are learning how the old ways of life were
unsustainable and now untenable in a new era. For the
health of our communities and the future of our planet, we
need investments that will better our society, not perpetuate
harm onto others for the sake of corporate profits. Despite
exploitative pushes from plastics and fossil fuel industry
players to try and sell us on the value of disposable plastic
bags and packaging during the pandemic, the writing is on the
wall. The time of unnecessary plastics is over. People want an
end to the plastic pollution crisis: They want clean air, water,
and food, livable communities, economic opportunities, and
a future for their families and grandchildren where the planet
is habitable, not cooked and filled with plastics instead of soil.

Climate change, fueled in part by the production of
throwaway plastics,131 is still threatening communities today,
and our future. We cannot delay bold action. In the U.S.,
as states reopen, some leaders are making wise decisions.
California resumed its ban on single-use plastic bags on June
22;132 Vermont moved forward with its planned plastic bag
ban, effective July 1;133 Massachusetts rescinded its order
that had prohibited reusable bags on July 10;134 and New
Hampshire began allowing reusable bags again on July 27,135
but has yet to ban single-use plastic bags. We now need other
states that have delayed approval or implementation of, or
that have rescinded, their single-use plastics bans to follow
California’s and Vermont’s lead; states such as Maine, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, and New York.

Businesses and governments must double down on their
efforts to reduce plastic pollution. Corporations must
eliminate single-use plastics and all disposable packaging
while investing in existing and new reuse systems;
governments must ban single-use plastics, incentivize
reuse, and hold corporations accountable for failing to take
responsibility for their contribution to the plastic pollution
crisis; and customers can help support reuse and refill
systems whenever they have the choice to do so.

As the world continues to transform

amid the pandemic, we have an

opportunity to work together to rebuild

a new, just future for our children and

communities, and a livable planet.

It is time for leadership from governments and businesses to
imagine and launch with great expediency the reuse systems
of the future. The good news is they don’t have to start from
scratch. Rather than investing in failed programs—or, even
worse, false solutions143—this is a moment to join a growing
movement for a plastic-free future and a reuse revolution.

We can work together to invest in technologies and systems
that provide good union jobs, protect our planet, and provide
customers and communities with the services they need. It
requires embracing change, transforming existing systems,
and time and investment. But if nothing else, 2020 has shown
so far that in moments of challenge and uncertainty, marked
changes are possible and are becoming inevitable. That is
what’s required of elected officials and business leaders
today. Increasingly, the public will not tolerate excuses,
greenwashing, or delays. Governments and businesses must
lead, invest in our future, and be accountable to the people in
their efforts to make life better for us all.

Now, it’s time to act.

Globally, some cities and countries have continued to push
for action on the plastic pollution crisis, even during the
pandemic. Jakarta enacted a single-use plastic bag ban on
July 1,136 making it the largest city in Southeast Asia to do so.
Germany, in compliance with an EU directive, also recently
announced a ban on several types of single-use plastics to
take effect in July 2021.137 And businesses are taking action:
In June 2020, South Korea retailer Lotte Mart announced it
will cut its plastic use by 50% by 2025,138 and in July ALDI UK &
Ireland also committed to reduce its plastic packaging by 50%
by 2025.139 These announcements follow Giant Eagle’s historic
commitment in December 2019, making it the first large U.S.
retailer to commit to eliminate all single-use plastics from
its operations by 2025.140 However, all retailers, including
ALDI which supports a group lobbying against reuse in some
European countries,141 must invest in and embrace reuse and
refill systems rather than switch from one single-use material
to another.

As businesses and governments continue to adapt their
operations in response to COVID-19, they cannot delay
action as multiple environmental crises continue to rage on,
pandemic or no pandemic. Plastic is literally raining down
from the sky.142 How companies and governments respond
or fail to respond will impact communities and our planet for
generations to come.

Things have changed significantly, and we need to retool
some of the solutions and approaches to eliminating single-
use plastics. Sanitization is a priority, especially in the midst
of a pandemic. Reusable systems are viable options to
help transition us away from disposable plastics. Even with
the new challenges presented by COVID-19, it is clear that
solutions already exist. With investment and attention from
governments and businesses worldwide, we can scale up
reuse systems—a move that will benefit both the economy
and our planet, and does not come at the expense of
communities, but rather supports them.

Many startups and even large retailers and consumer goods
companies are aware of the promise and opportunity for
reuse. Those companies that fail to seize this opportunity
will miss the economic benefits of shifting to reuse, and
furthermore run the risk of becoming obsolete as others gain
market share by providing services to customers without the
need for disposable packaging. The window of opportunity to
be a part of the new wave of innovations and investments will
eventually close.
