Executive Summary

The next president and Congress must adopt policies to
phase out domestic fossil fuel production as part of any
comprehensive climate policy effort like a Green New Deal.
This fossil fuel phase out should occur in tandem with policies
to boost renewable energy and ensure a just transition
for workers, communities and tribal nations . This report
illustrates that if no action is taken to address the climate
impacts of fossil fuel production, then a significant
fraction of emissions reductions achieved by policies to
reduce demand for fossil fuels could be wiped out.

Scenarios regarding U .S . crude oil production and
consumption presented in this report show that:

|| If the U .S . is successful at reducing domestic consumption of
oil but does not stem the boom in domestic oil production,
then the surplus oil will be exported and burned overseas .

|| These surplus oil exports will increase carbon emissions
beyond our borders, counteracting roughly half of any
domestic emissions reductions .

|| By contrast, policies that align reductions in oil consumption
with reductions in oil production can eliminate this emissions
leakage and achieve greater overall greenhouse gas
emissions reductions .

In order to meet the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal of limiting
warming to 1 .5 degree Celsius, we must limit the production
and use of fossil fuels to remain within our carbon budget .
Further, humans have discovered far more oil, gas, and coal
than we can afford to burn without exceeding this budget. The
fossil fuel extraction projects that are already in motion would
release enough greenhouse gas emissions to push us beyond
safe limits . Continuing to invest in fossil fuel infrastructure or
allow production to progress unchecked will undermine our
ability to achieve the Paris targets, threatening vulnerable
communities and future generations .

This report’s findings indicate that climate policies that
address both fossil fuel demand and supply can be designed
to have lower emissions leakage, and thus more impact,
than policies that only address one part of the equation .
To illustrate this risk, much of the booming oil and gas
production in the Permian Basin could be produced directly
for export, thus contributing to global carbon emissions, even
if domestic oil demand and emissions were to fall .

Because policies to restrict fossil fuel production have
particular relevance to industry workers and frontline
communities impacted by extraction, extra care must be

taken to ensure the transition is managed equitably, with an
emphasis on centering frontline leadership, implementing
strong labor protections, and ensuring family-sustaining jobs .

We call on the next president to:

|| Take action on Day One to constrain fossil fuel supply by
halting new fossil fuel leasing on federal lands and waters

|| Set ambitious targets for a fossil fuel phase out in concert

with other climate policies

|| Restore, strengthen, and fully enforce public health

and clean air and water protections

Current U .S . laws governing energy production are not
adequate to the challenges of the 21st century, and the next
president and Congress will also need to craft and swiftly
enact new legislative tools, such as:

|| Ending subsidies and finance for fossil fuels

|| Reinstating the crude export ban and extending it to other

fossil fuels

|| Establishing a climate test mandate for fossil fuel

infrastructure

Decades of failed leadership and climate denial have brought
us to this moment of crisis . Words are no longer an adequate
response — we must have rapid and ambitious action from
our elected leaders . For the next president and Congress, real
climate leadership means not only saying yes to real solutions
like a rapid transition to renewable energy with equitable
ownership and participation, but also saying no to the
destructive impacts of fossil fuel extraction . A transformative
Green New Deal means all of these things, and making it
a reality means putting justice and equity for vulnerable
workers and communities front and center in the transition
to a clean and prosperous future .

Introduction

The next U .S . president and Congress must take dramatic and
effective action to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels and avoid the most dangerous consequences
of climate change . For decades, the federal government has
failed to implement adequate policies to cut greenhouse
gas emissions — and the latest science tells us that time
is nearly up .1 If we do not act swiftly to put the U.S. and
global economy on a new pathway, we will breach the 1.5°C
limit that nations agreed to strive for in the Paris Climate
Agreement, with devastating consequences for Americans
and people around the world .2

Despite the urgency of the crisis, political leaders have
shied away from directly addressing the primary source of
greenhouse gas emissions — fossil fuels . To the extent that
policies to mitigate climate change have been implemented at
all, they have largely focused on boosting renewable energy
and energy efficiency to reduce demand for coal, oil, and gas
— not on addressing fossil fuel production directly .

For example, President Barack Obama enacted policies such
as the Clean Power Plan and stronger fuel economy standards

for cars — but he also presided over soaring oil and gas
production during his time in office, and signed a bill ending
a 40-year ban on crude oil exports .3 The climate platform
for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 candidacy set a goal of reducing
“American oil consumption by a third” through “cleaner fuels”
and energy efficiency, but made no strong commitments
regarding production, except that it must be “safe and
responsible” and not take place in “sensitive areas .”4

Over the past decade, U .S . oil and natural gas production
has increased rapidly due to technological developments
that have unlocked oil and gas deposits in shale formations,
bolstered in part by millions of dollars in federal research
and development funding5 and support for “all-of-the-
above” energy policies .6 Crude oil production nearly
doubled between 2008 and 2018, exceeding its previous
1970 peak .7 Natural gas production also grew by about
51% during this time, exceeding previous peak levels .8
In contrast, U .S . coal production has fallen over that same
time period,9 and around half of coal mines operating in
2008 have now closed .10

This rapid growth of oil and gas drilling, along with the
build-out of pipelines, export terminals, and controversial
techniques such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking), has
sparked grassroots opposition all along the supply chain . This
grassroots movement is often led by Indigenous communities
or communities of color, and other local groups who are
deeply concerned about the climate and are no longer willing
to shoulder the burden of local air and water pollution that
comes with increased extraction .11

This report presents new analysis showing why the next
president and Congress must include a plan to responsibly
manage a fossil fuel phase out as part of any comprehensive
policy to fight climate change. Without policies to curtail
domestic fossil fuel production alongside policies to reduce
fossil fuel demand, any surplus production may simply be
exported to global markets. Our analysis finds that without
such policies, nearly half the emission reductions from a
Green New Deal could be undermined .

For decades, the fossil fuel industry has shown itself to
be adept at denying, delaying, and diluting real climate
solutions . By advocating for a fossil fuel phase out and
confronting the political power of the industry, the next
President and Congress can clearly signal that the era of
fossil fuels is truly drawing to a close .

The concept of a Green New Deal has been gaining
momentum on Capitol Hill, thanks to a movement driven by
young people . The Green New Deal aims to mobilize federal
resources to transition the U .S . economy to 100% clean
energy and create millions of good jobs, while centering
justice and equity for communities bearing the burdens of
racial, economic, and environmental injustice .12

The excitement and momentum around a Green New Deal
has provided a welcome and desperately needed push for
urgent action after decades of delay.13 However, discourse
around a Green New Deal has primarily focused on growing
renewable energy and reducing demand for fossil fuels, while
largely ignoring the need to phase out fossil fuel production .14
Several commentators have called for including anti-fossil
fuel supply side policies in a Green New Deal in order to
improve public health15 and human rights,16 end counter-
productive subsidies,17 and focus on the primary driver of
the crisis .18,19 Research has shown that not only are policies
to reduce fossil fuel supply effective at reducing carbon
emissions and can complement demand-side policies, but
that at this point in time, such policies are an imperative to
securing a decent chance of limiting global warming to less
severe levels .20,21,22

An intentional plan to phase out fossil fuel production is
also critical because extraction disproportionately impacts
vulnerable communities, and is closely connected to the
labor transitions that will occur with a Green New Deal or
any comprehensive climate approach with solutions at
the scale and speed necessary to meet our climate targets .
Careful planning will be essential to ensure that workers
and communities are left better off while transitioning our
economy away from fossil fuels .

Why We Must Phase Out
Fossil Fuel Production

The goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-Industrial
levels sets a limit on the amount of fossil fuels that can be
burned. This temperature limit defines a “carbon budget” — a
limit on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be
emitted into the atmosphere .23 Translating this global carbon
budget to the level of national contributions from fossil fuel-
producing countries, or even individual extraction projects,
will involve a complex interaction between financial forces,
global and local politics, and demands for justice and equity .
What is clear, however, is that humans have discovered far
more oil, gas, and coal than we can afford to burn.

Given this context, policies to phase out fossil fuel production
are an important, but often underutilized, tool in the climate
policy toolkit . Addressing fossil fuel supply can prevent the
lock-in of future emissions, prevent leakage, and lower total
greenhouse gas emissions .

Carbon Budgets and Carbon Lock-In

Global fossil fuel resources (a measure of what fossil fuels are
known to exist that could be recovered) and reserves (what is
economically recoverable with current technology) far exceed
the estimated carbon budgets for limiting warming to 1.5°C
and 2°C.24 What’s more, the carbon content of oil, gas and coal
in already-producing or under-construction fields and mines
(known as developed reserves)25,26 already far exceeds the
1.5°C carbon budget, and would exhaust the 2°C budget.27 In
other words, the fossil fuel extraction projects that are already
in motion would release enough greenhouse gas emissions to
push us beyond safe limits .

Previous research has sought to identify the fraction
of reserves, by category and region, which must be left
unburned .28 A series of reports by Carbon Tracker Initiative
has analyzed individual extraction projects by the breakeven
price needed to profitably extract those resources. These
reports conclude that a significant share of high-cost reserves
would be “unburnable” under a safe carbon budget .29 This
methodology can be used to identify certain classes of
reserves (such as tar sands or Arctic oil) as likely unburnable,30
and to estimate the share of capital expenditures for fossil
fuel companies31 that could become stranded .32 We note that
using breakeven price as the criteria for which fossil fuels are
unburnable, while an instructive tool, does not adequately
address concerns around justice and equity . Any plans for
phasing out fossil fuel production should also take into
account human rights, local environmental pollution, the
resiliency of local economies, and other factors .33

New investments in fossil fuel infrastructure made today can
encourage greater fossil fuel demand and “lock in” future
emissions . Carbon lock-in can occur as a result of investments
in leases, mines, wells, pipelines, as well as downstream
infrastructure such as refineries and power plants.34 Such
projects often require high upfront investments that can only
be recouped over a multi-decade lifetime . The risk of carbon
lock-in is that once the upfront investments are made, it can
be more difficult — from an economic, legal and political
standpoint — to stop the extraction of the resource .35 The
incentive to recover the initial investment can facilitate
continued production, even if demand and profit margins fall
in the future .36 Continuing to invest in fossil fuel infrastructure

in the near term will significantly raise the future costs of
reaching our climate targets because, as the International
Energy Agency (IEA) notes, “much more costly actions are
required subsequently to undo the lock-in effect.”37

To illustrate the risk of carbon lock-in from new fossil fuel
infrastructure, Figure 1 shows Total Primary Energy from
oil for a number of climate-constrained scenarios from
global energy models .38 The figure shows four scenarios
(Low Energy Demand,39 One Earth,40 and two Energy [R]
evolution41 scenarios) that meet the Paris Climate Agreement
goals of limiting warming to 1.5° (or well below 2°C) without
significant use of unproven carbon capture and storage (CCS)
or negative emissions technology . The general trend for these
scenarios shows a rapid decline in energy derived from oil
by mid-century . In contrast, the black arrow shows a 50-year
lifetime for oil infrastructure (such as a producing lease or
a pipeline) built in 2020 . The rapid decline of oil use in the
“climate safe” scenarios over that time period illustrates the
risk that those assets would become stranded, or worse,
would continue to produce oil and emissions beyond the
global carbon budget, and thereby undermine climate goals .

For comparison purposes, the figure also displays the IEA’s
Beyond 2 Degree Scenario (B2DS)42 although we note that
this scenario is not fully “Paris compliant” since it ignores the
1.5°C goal, meets the 2°C with only a 66% probability, and
relies heavily on CCS and negative emissions technology .43
Similarly, the figure displays a range of integrated assessment
models (IAMs) referenced in the IPCC report on 1.5°C, although
many of those scenarios also rely heavily on CCS or feature
inequitable regional disparities in emissions reductions .44

But despite the stark realities of the carbon budget, new
research from Global Witness finds that nearly $5 trillion of
capital investment is planned for new oil and gas production,
which would risk even greater carbon lock-in and put climate
safe targets out of reach .45

Taken together, these studies make it clear that we are on
the cusp of a crucial decision . Any permitting of new fossil
fuel extraction or infrastructure projects is inconsistent
with the Paris Climate Agreement targets and a threat to
vulnerable communities . Plans for the expansion of fossil fuel
production in the U .S . are incompatible with climate action .
The next president and Congress face a choice to embark

on a just transition and a managed
phase-out of fossil fuel production
— or continue to enable climate
catastrophe .

Restricting Fossil
Fuel Supply Reduces
Emissions

Policies to reduce fossil fuel
consumption can either focus on
reducing demand for those energy
sources (“demand-side” policies) or
on restricting their supply (“supply-
side” policies) .46 Continued fossil
fuel extraction is inconsistent with
action to combat climate change, and
policies to restrict fossil fuel supply
directly lead to emissions reductions
and reinforce demand-side policies .
Table 1 gives examples of demand-
and supply-side policies .

Table 1: Examples of Demand- and Supply-Side Policies to Restrict Fossil Fuels

Demand-Side Policies

Supply-Side Policies

Incentivizing electric vehicle purchases

Ending fossil fuel production subsidies

Implementing fuel economy standards for vehicles

Implementing a “climate test” for infrastructure permits

Implementing the Clean Power Plan to reduce emissions
from power plants

Ending fossil fuel leasing on federal lands and waters

Investing in public transportation

Increasing “setbacks” to restrict drilling areas

Enacting a carbon tax or cap-and-trade regime

Restricting fossil fuel exports

Research by the Stockholm Environment Institute has found
that restricting leasing of coal and oil from federal lands and
waters would lead to meaningful reductions in global carbon
emissions . This emissions reduction is achieved because
energy markets respond to a reduction in fossil fuel supply by
increasing prices, which leads to lower consumption . The size
of this effect is determined by the elasticities of supply and
demand for the market, but the range of published elasticity
values indicates that decreases in fossil fuel production lead
to significant decreases in greenhouse gas emissions.

The same study concluded that ending new or renewed
federal leases (which represent about a quarter of U .S .
production) would result in a reduction of ~100 million metric
tonnes (Mt) of CO2-equivalent in global emissions in the year
2030 . Roughly 30% of this reduction would come from oil
and 70% from coal — an emissions savings comparable to
the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) fuel economy
standards, and nearly half of what would be achieved by the
Clean Power Plan in that year if it were fully implemented .47
A later study explored options for the state of California to
reduce emissions by limiting in-state oil production, finding
similar potential for emissions reductions .48

A 2016 study of federal coal production found that both
increasing royalty rates and managing the phase out of
extraction would lead to overall emissions reductions .49
Similarly, a recent study from Resources for the Future
showed that higher levels of U .S . oil and gas production
will lead to higher global emissions in 2030, with a notable
impact due to increased oil exports leading to greater oil
consumption outside the U .S .50

Constraining Domestic Fossil Fuel
Supply to Mitigate Emissions Leakage

Recent increases in exports of U .S . oil, gas, and coal are an
underestimated threat to the global climate, and in the context
of policies to reduce domestic emissions, they represent a
source of emissions leakage . Emissions leakage occurs when
“sources outside the scope of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
reduction system increase emissions as a result of that system,”
and it can arise through shifts in production, shifts in
investment, or price signals (as discussed in the previous
section) .51 In particular, for a globally traded commodity like
crude oil, reduction of oil consumption in one region can lead
to an increase in oil supply for the rest of the world, which in
turn lowers oil prices and boosts consumption elsewhere .

In 2015, when Congress lifted the 40-year-old ban on crude oil
exports, warnings were raised that allowing greater access to
oil markets outside the U .S . would spark higher production
levels here at home, a surge in exports and ultimately, higher
emissions .52 The U .S . is currently both an importer and an
exporter of crude oil . Since 2015, gross exports have risen
rapidly to 2 million barrels per day, and the U .S . Energy
Information Administration predicts the U .S . may soon
become a net exporter of crude and petroleum products .53
Exports of natural gas by pipeline and liquified natural gas
(LNG) shipments have also increased in recent years,54 and
since 2016 coal exports have nearly doubled, reversing
previous declines .55 If a conscious effort is not made to phase
out fossil fuel production and constrain access to global
energy markets as part of any comprehensive climate policy,
the U .S . risks undermining hard-won domestic emissions
reductions as the pollution is exported overseas .

Building Political Momentum for a
Fossil Fuel Phase out

Another reason to include policies to restrict fossil fuel supply
in any suite of comprehensive climate policies such as a Green
New Deal is that doing so can increase the likelihood of long-
term success in addressing climate change .

Policies to restrict the expansion of fossil fuel production
have shown broad public support . By a 55% to 38% margin,
the American public has opposed “expanding oil, gas, and

coal development on America’s public lands and waters .”56
Public subsidies to oil, gas, and coal production are opposed
by 70% of Americans57 and 73% of small business owners .58
One recent poll found that explicit policies to prohibit new
fossil fuel infrastructure when clean renewable alternatives
are available are supported by 56% of the public, with just
26% opposed .59 Another poll found 50% of the public felt such
policies were essential or helpful to climate policy .60

More importantly, restricting fossil fuel supply is important
for withdrawing the social license of the fossil fuel industry
and undermining its political and economic power — both of
which will be key to winning and maintaining strong climate
policies . Successful action to restrict fossil fuel supply will
directly diminish the political power of the fossil fuel lobby,
while boosting the political power of others — including
youth, frontline and Indigenous communities, farmers and
landowners, activists, renewable energy interests, and
others in favor of a Green New Deal . In addition, research
indicates that successful policies in one region can help
create conditions to advance similar fossil fuel phase outs
elsewhere: “As the number of states banning an activity rises,
the social costs of non-conformity (for instance, a tarnished
international reputation) increase, making it more likely, all
else being equal, that other states will adopt a similar ban .”61

Because of this, reducing the power of the fossil fuel industry
makes it much more likely that comprehensive climate
policies like a Green New Deal will be enacted, implemented,
and successfully defended from future rollbacks .

Climate Impacts of a Fossil
Fuel Phase Out

In this section we present original analysis of three scenarios
to examine the effect of policies to restrict fossil fuel supply
along with fossil fuel demand on greenhouse gas emissions .
This analysis focuses on the global crude oil market,
but future research aims to include coal and natural gas
production . The key conclusion is that if steps are not
taken to reduce domestic oil production, roughly half
of any reduction in domestic oil consumption will be
counteracted by increased oil consumption elsewhere in
the world.

Oil Supply Analysis

Because oil is a globally traded commodity, changes in
U .S . production and consumption of oil can impact global oil
prices, and hence global oil consumption and the resulting
carbon emissions . Oil that the U .S . produces but does not
consume can be exported and burned, thereby increasing
global carbon emissions . Thus, successful policies to reduce
emissions from oil consumption domestically will be
undermined by this emission leakage, unless specific policies
to restrict domestic oil production are put in place at the
same time .

To illustrate this problem, we consider three scenarios:

|| Business as Usual Scenario uses oil supply information
from the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2019 (AEO19)
Reference Case for Liquid Fuels .62

|| Domestic Demand Only Scenario maintains the domestic

oil production levels from AEO19, but pairs that with
a rapid decline in domestic demand for crude oil . This
scenario illustrates the impacts of successful demand-
side policies to reduce U .S . oil consumption, but not
corresponding policies to limit production .

|| Aligned Policies Scenario matches the steep decline

in domestic demand with a similar decline in domestic
production, illustrating the impacts of aligning demand-
and supply-side policies in a comprehensive approach .

Full details of the calculations are presented in the
Appendix: Research Methods, and we present a summary of
the results here .

Business As Usual Scenario
The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook for 2019 forecasts a
continuing increase in domestic oil production, rising to over
14 million barrels per day (MMBbl/d) by 2024 in the Reference
Case — an increase even from the ~12 MMBbl/d level found in
the previous 2018 version of the AEO .63 The EIA also presents
an alternate “High Oil and Gas Resource and Technology”
(HOG) scenario where oil production rises to over 20 MMBbl/d
by 2040 .64 Industry estimates have indicated that these higher
production levels are plausible .65 Even under the Reference
Case, EIA finds that rising production leads the U.S. to become
a net exporter of petroleum and other liquids (although not of
crude oil itself) .66

Figure 2 shows U .S . crude oil supply
for the year 2030 . In that year, the EIA
forecasts over 14 MMBbl/d of domestic
production plus another 5 MMBbl/d of
gross crude imports . Subtracting the
volume of U .S . production that is directly
exported as crude oil (light gray line)
defines EIA’s quantity Total Crude Supply
(TCS, red line), which is the volume of
crude available to U.S. refineries. For this
analysis, it is important to distinguish
between oil that is consumed in the U .S .
and oil that is exported and consumed
abroad . However, TCS is not a measure of
oil consumed domestically, because some
crude that is refined at U.S. refineries is
then exported in the form of petroleum
products such as gasoline or diesel .

We therefore further divide TCS into crude
that is refined and consumed in the U.S.
(dark gray line) and crude that is refined
in the U .S . but is exported abroad as
petroleum products (medium gray line) .
We estimate the fraction of TCS that is
consumed domestically by considering

the AEO Reference Case forecast for
the fraction of all refined petroleum
products that are consumed in the
U .S . (see the Appendix for further
details on this calculation) .

Figure 3 shows the forecast for these
crude oil quantities out to 2050, along
with the historical U .S . oil supply
through 2017 (dotted lines) .

The blue line in Figure 3 shows U .S .
domestic crude oil production through
2050 . In the recent past, very little U .S .
crude was directly exported, but now
the U .S . both imports and exports
significant volumes of crude oil.67 The
fact that the blue line (production)
remains below the red line (TCS)
in Figure 3 indicates that the U .S .
remains a net crude importer in this
Reference Case . It can also be seen
that the U .S . will begin producing
more than it consumes sometime
around 2020 (where the blue line
crosses above the dark gray region) .

The LED is not a prediction of what the next president and
Congress will do, and furthermore, the findings presented
here do not depend on specific features of the LED scenario
and hold in general for any specified decline in domestic
consumption .

Figure 4 shows oil supply for the Domestic Demand Only
Scenario .

This rapid decline in domestic demand must be
accommodated by an increase in product exports, a
decrease in refinery output, or some mixture of the two.69
Because domestic production (blue line) is unchanged
in this scenario from the Business as Usual Scenario, a
decrease in refinery output also implies a decrease in net
crude imports . As can be seen in Figure 4, crude consumed
in the U .S . declines rapidly from 2020 to 2050 (dark gray
line), but unchanged levels of U .S . crude production results
in an increase in exports of both refined petroleum products
(medium gray line) and crude (light gray line) in comparison
to the Business as Usual Scenario . In this scenario, the U .S .
becomes a net exporter of crude oil by 2030 (note where
the blue line crosses above the red line) and remains a net
exporter through at least 2050 .

Domestic Demand Only Scenario
The Domestic Demand Only Scenario maintains domestic oil
production at the AEO19 Reference Case levels, but models
a steep decline in domestic demand for oil consistent with
limiting warming to 1.5°C. This decline in domestic demand
could be the result of successful renewable energy and
energy efficiency policies enacted by the next president
and Congress, such as strong electric vehicle incentives,
fuel economy standards, public
investment in public transit and
other policies .

For illustration, we use the Low
Energy Demand (LED) scenario
from the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change’s Special
Report on Global Warming of 1 .5ºC
(also referred to as representative
pathway P1) . The LED is an example
of a scenario that limits warming
to 1.5°C without relying on carbon
capture and storage .68 Under this
scenario, global Total Primary
Energy from oil declines by 89%
from 2020 to 2050. To define the
Domestic Demand Only Scenario,
we scale U .S . consumption in
proportion to this global decline .
However we note that while the
LED scenario is an example of
the ambition necessary on the
global level, concerns about
global equity would require that
the U .S . reduce emissions at an
even faster pace than the global
average from this scenario .

wheels .” This value combines
emissions from extraction and
transportation (upstream), refining
(midstream) and consumption of
refined products (downstream).70

To make this comparison we
consider two terms: domestic
emissions and rest-of-world (ROW)
emissions . The Domestic Demand
Only and the Aligned Policies
Scenarios are designed so that
crude consumed in the U .S . is the
same in both models, and the
only difference is the amount of
crude that is exported . As a result,
the decline in domestic carbon
emissions (from the the Business
as Usual Scenario baseline) is the
same for the Domestic Demand
Only and the Aligned Policies
Scenarios (see Table 2, U .S .
columns) .

However under the Domestic
Demand Only Scenario, this
domestic emissions reduction
is counteracted by an increase
in ROW emissions (abroad) .

Each barrel of increased oil exports (both crude and refined
product) in the Domestic Demand Only Scenario increases
the oil supply available to the rest of the world . We follow
the methodology used and documented by the Stockholm
Environment Institute in calculating the increase in ROW
consumption and emissions due to these added exports .71 For
each barrel of increased net exports, we estimate an increase
of 0 .44 barrels of ROW crude oil consumption . This factor is
based on estimates of oil market elasticities and there are
naturally uncertainties and caveats about the size of this
effect,72 but its value is consistent with those used in other
recent studies .73

In the Aligned Policies Scenario, the “matching” of supply-
and demand-side policies ensures that the countervailing
global oil market effect is much smaller than in the Domestic
Demand Only Scenario, giving this scenario a much greater
total impact on reducing carbon emissions .

Table 2 summarizes two metrics for comparing emissions
between the Business as Usual Scenario and the other two
scenarios: (1) global carbon emissions in the year 2030,
and (2) cumulative global carbon emissions from 2020 to
2050 . Under both metrics, ROW emissions (and hence global

Aligned Policies Scenario
The Aligned Policies Scenario applies the LED decline profile
to both domestic oil demand (as in the Domestic Demand
Only Scenario) and to domestic oil production and refining.
Figure 5 shows oil supply for the Aligned Policies Scenario .

The Aligned Policies Scenario is defined by applying the
LED decline profile to domestic production, crude imports,
and other refinery inputs (see the Appendix for full details).
This decline in domestic oil production could be the result
of successful supply-side policies to wind down fossil fuel
production enacted by the next president and Congress . As
Figure 5 shows, domestic crude consumption declines rapidly
(identical to the Domestic Demand Only Scenario), but both
crude and product exports also decline over time .

Greenhouse Gas Emissions
To calculate the difference in carbon impact of climate
policies that limit oil demand and supply, we use the Business
as Usual Scenario as a baseline and consider the difference
between that baseline and the other two scenarios . We
calculate greenhouse gas emissions by considering the
lifecycle emissions from a barrel of crude oil from “well-to-

(Mt CO2-eq). The percentage column shows the percent emissions leakage (ROW/U.S.) due to global oil market effects.

(such as electric vehicles or biofuels) . Further research is
needed to understand the full system response to scenarios
such as these, but the core issue of exports and global market
impacts is one that policy makers must consider in designing
effective policies.

The central conclusion of these scenarios is that allowing
fossil fuel production to increase unchecked is a clear risk to
the climate . Without restraints on oil supply as part of any
comprehensive climate policy approach, increased exports
are a natural consequence of reduced domestic consumption,
and those exports could undermine roughly half of any
domestic emissions reductions . However, by aligning supply-
and demand-side policies, policy makers could ensure that
the impact of U .S . production on global supply remains
neutral, or even has a beneficial impact on global emissions,
while also mitigating the other negative impacts of extraction
discussed previously, including human health hazards and
threats to clean air and water .

Coal and Natural Gas Supply

A key extension of this analysis would be to consider not just
emissions from crude oil but all components that make up
liquid fuels, primarily including natural gas liquids (NGLs)
and biofuels . The current focus on crude oil is presented
as an example to illustrate the problem of leakage and its
impacts on 100 percent clean energy policies, and is not a full
treatment of greenhouse gas emissions from liquid fuels .

The analysis could also be extended to include both natural
gas and coal production in the scenarios considered . Natural
gas is commonly produced together with crude oil, and so
changes to oil production would also have an impact on
natural gas production . Because natural gas competes with
coal in the electric power market, changes to natural gas
production will also have an impact on coal consumption and
the adoption of renewables like wind and solar .

emissions) are much higher in the Domestic Demand Only
Scenario than in the Aligned Policies Scenario, eliminating
roughly 46% of the domestic emissions reductions benefit.

These metrics illustrate that there is a cost to relying solely on
demand-side policies to reduce oil consumption in the U .S .
If nothing is done to address production, then nearly 50%
of the emissions reductions achieved through demand-side
policies could be wiped out . Climate policies that address
both demand and supply can be designed to have lower
emissions leakage than policies that only address one part of
the equation . Figure 6 illustrates the carbon emissions impact
of both the Domestic Demand Only Scenario and the Aligned
Policies Scenario, relative to the Business as Usual Scenario .

The scenarios presented above capture important aspects of
demand- and supply-side policies for crude oil, but remain
simplifications of the real-world dynamics. Changes to the
supply and demand of crude oil would also have impacts on
what substitutes are deployed to replace crude oil demand

Research has found that a global market dynamic likely exists
for coal as it does for oil, where changes in supply affect
global prices and consumption .74,75 The market response
for natural gas is less well understood, in part because the
market is less global with distinct regional markets and prices,
although the recent increase in LNG exports is beginning to
change those dynamics .76

The electric power market is changing due to rapid
declines in the cost of wind and solar power, which has
brought renewables to parity with conventional electricity
generation .77 The EIA does not currently publish a scenario
with both low natural gas and low coal production, but the
High Oil and Gas scenario shows higher overall power sector
emissions (in later years) as compared to the Low Oil and Gas
scenario . This increase is driven by higher emissions from
natural gas that are not fully compensated by lower emissions
from coal .78 The High Oil and Gas scenario also leads to lower
adoption of renewables in comparison to the Low Oil and Gas

scenario .79 This indicates that a coal, oil and gas phase out
could have additional benefits from boosting the deployment
of renewable energy and reducing emissions from the electric
power sector .

Oil and gas production is associated with significant
emissions of methane (CH4) — a greenhouse gas that is 87
times as potent as CO2 over a 20-year timespan (which aligns
with the period in which we must be acting most swiftly
and ambitiously to address the climate crisis) .80 Venting and
fugitive leaks of methane from oil and gas infrastructure have
been shown to be a significant climate driver that erodes
the advantage claimed by natural gas over coal in terms of
CO2 emissions per unit of power generated .81 This report
already considers lifecycle emissions of CO2, CH4 and other
greenhouse gases from crude oil production (reported as CO2-
equivalent),82 but including natural gas and coal production
in the analysis would require a more sophisticated analysis of
methane emissions .

The Permian Basin

An important case study for understanding the intersection of fossil fuel supply and climate policy in the U .S . is the boom
in oil and gas production in the Permian Basin region (see Figure 7) . From well to pipe to export, the federal government
currently has little authority to put the brakes on unchecked oil and gas production in Texas — which is why comprehensive
climate efforts such as a Green New Deal must provide additional tools to constrain fossil fuel extraction and limit exports.
Absent this, even if domestic reductions in oil demand are successful, the lack of federal oversight on extraction and
transportation of crude oil could accelerate the trend toward crude exports that is already developing along the Gulf Coast .

The Permian is a sedimentary basin located in west Texas and southeast New Mexico that contains some of the nation’s
largest oil and gas resources . A 2018 resource assessment from U .S . Geological Survey83 increased the total of undiscovered,
technically recoverable resources (UTRR) in the Permian to 70 .5 billion barrels of oil, 339 .8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
and 22 .7 billion barrels of natural gas liquids .84 The nearby Eagle Ford Group in south Texas contains an additional 8 .5 billion
barrels of oil and 66 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .85

Carbon emissions from Permian oil and gas production
through 2050 could alone exhaust nearly 10% of the
global 1.5°C carbon budget.86

This quantity of oil and gas would be enough to support high
production levels for decades to come, and led former Interior
Secretary Ryan Zinke to boast in 2018 that “Christmas came
a few weeks early this year .”87 Oil production in the Permian
region has nearly quadrupled from 2010 to today, while natural
gas production has more than doubled .88 Industry analysts
predict that Permian production will continue to rise to as much
as 6 million barrels a day (MMBbl/d) by 2022, although a lack of
pipeline capacity is currently holding back production growth .89
Much of that production will likely be exported and burned
overseas, as the Gulf Coast region as a whole flipped to being
a net crude exporter in late 2018 .90 One oil company executive
recently noted the trend by saying “every single molecule from
here on out has to be exported .”91

REAL CLIMATE LEA DERSHIP  |  15

The Permian’s transportation capacity crunch has
sparked several new pipeline proposals . The Cactus
II, Gray Oak and EPIC pipelines may all come online in
late 2019 to facilitate the transport of crude oil from
the Permian to the Corpus Christi region, where marine
export terminals and the world’s largest ethylene
cracker plant have been proposed .92 Other major
pipeline projects, such as ETP’s Permian-Nederland
and ExxonMobil’s Permian-Gulf Coast, aim to transport
crude to Gulf Coast destinations further east and may
come online in 2020 or later .93 Apart from locking in
future production and constraining the ability of the Gulf
Coast’s economy to accommodate an equitable labor
transition on the timescale needed, these infrastructure
projects also come with their own negative impacts on
human health, local environments, property rights, and
Indigenous sovereignty .94

Given these major developments, it is remarkable how little oversight exists over the Permian boom . Apart from federally
owned lands and water, onshore oil and gas drilling and production is facilitated through state-level permitting . In Texas,
the vast majority of onshore oil and gas production occurs on private or state land, and only a negligible amount is produced
from federal land .95 By contrast, in New Mexico, roughly half of all oil production occurs on federal land,96 and could
therefore potentially be constrained by changes to federal leasing policy .

Due to a quirk in federal law, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approves the construction and operation
of natural gas pipelines, but not oil pipelines. The federal government does regulate rates and tariffs (through FERC) and
pipeline safety (through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA), and there are a number
of required federal permits and processes for major projects . But there is no federal “up or down” approval process for
interstate or intrastate oil pipelines, leaving that function to the various states .97

In the case of Texas, state approval is also minimal . An FAQ on the website of the Texas Railroad Commission, the primary
state regulatory body for the oil and gas industry, states:

“In Texas, pipelines are not required to be permitted before being built. There is no statutory or

regulatory requirement that a pipeline operator seek or receive from the Railroad Commission

either a determination that there is a need for the pipeline capacity or prior approval to

construct a pipeline and related facilities. Additionally, the Railroad Commission does not

determine or confer common carrier status for pipelines. The pipeline operator reports to the

Railroad Commission the status of a pipeline as a gas utility, common carrier or private line.

Commission does not have any authority over a common carrier pipeline’s exercise of its

statutory right of eminent domain. Generally, the Railroad Commission has no authority over

the routing or siting of intrastate or interstate pipelines. The pipeline route is determined by

the pipeline’s owner/operator.”98

Texas grants a statutory right of eminent domain for “common carrier pipelines” which includes most oil pipelines . The
Railroad Commission does issue T-4 permits that give the right to operate the pipelines, but as they note: “A T-4 Permit is
essentially a registration process to provide the Railroad Commission (RRC) with information about a pipeline, such as
the material it is carrying and whether the pipeline is jurisdictional to the RRC . There is no hearing at the Railroad
Commission for T-4 Permits .”

REAL CLIMATE LEA DERSHIP  |  16

Texas does have a “Landowners Bill of Rights,” but pipeline companies are not greatly constrained in their ability to get
common carrier status and take land for pipelines via eminent domain .99 A 2011 Texas Supreme Court decision ended
the process of simply checking a box to obtain common carrier status, and now pipeline companies have to demonstrate
public use when sued in a court of law. However, a recent court ruling clarified this standard and was seen as a win for
pipeline companies .100

To cap it off, the U.S. taxpayers are propping up oil and gas extraction through over $10 billion in annual federal subsidies to
fossil fuel production, many of which are directed at the private corporations expanding extraction in the Permian Basin .101
Research has shown that as much as 40% of Permian oil is only profitable to extract due to direct and indirect subsidies
provided to oil and gas companies .102 Yet despite booming production levels, financial returns in the Permian have been
poor and many drillers have yet to turn a profit.103

The Permian boom has also brought with it severe local problems such as unpermitted air pollution, widespread gas flaring,
unsustainable water use, wastewater disposal, earthquakes, heavy traffic, and stresses on local government services.104

Taken as a whole, these factors make the Permian an important case study for why more federal oversight and active
regulation is needed to constrain the expansion and proactively plan for the phase-out of oil and gas extraction . Potential
energy policy changes could give the next president more tools to constrain oil and gas production in the biggest
producing region in the U .S ., but without these critical changes, this dynamic represents a serious and growing risk
to the global climate .

Policy Recommendations
and Conclusions

The science is clear that any further expansion of fossil fuel
production is incompatible with the Paris Climate Agreement
and risks locking in future emissions . In the U .S ., unconstrained
fossil fuel production threatens to undermine emission
reductions that could be achieved by ambitious demand-side
policies and a build-out of renewable energy . The path forward
is an immediate halt to new oil, gas, and coal development
in the U .S . and a managed phase out of existing fossil fuel
production consistent with safe climate limits . The next
president and Congress must utilize existing authorities as
well as pass new legislation to constrain oil, gas, and coal
production.They must also cut off government support for
fossil fuels, invest in a just transition for communities, and
secure strong labor protections to ensure workers are treated
fairly in the transition .

Existing laws and regulations give the president authority
to constrain some fossil fuel production and to protect
communities from air and water pollution — and the next
president should exercise those powers to their fullest extent .
To begin with, the president has clear authority over fossil
fuel leasing on federal lands and waters,105 which accounts
for roughly 24% of U .S . greenhouse gas emissions .106 The
next president should put an end to new fossil fuel leases on
their first day in office. The next president should also take

aggressive action to reinstate, strengthen, and fully enforce
regulations to reduce air and water pollution from existing
fossil fuel-based infrastructure .

Congress must also lead by taking new legislative actions
to reverse laws designed to support  fossil fuels, and to
provide new policy tools for the federal government to wind
down fossil fuel production and secure a just transition for
workers and communities . Such new legislation should work
towards eliminating all subsidies and public finance for fossil
fuels, implementing a “climate test” for the permitting and
construction of new infrastructure, and halting exports of
crude oil and other fossil fuels . At the same time, Congress
must secure large-scale federal investments and protections
to ensure that the transition to a 100% renewable economy
improves the lives of all workers, communities, and tribal
nations (for more details see Box 2: Fossil Fuel Phase Out
Requires a Just Transition) .

Winding down an industry as entrenched as the fossil fuel
industry at the pace and scale that science and justice demand
will also require a new realm of bold policy actions, beyond
those typically discussed in the halls of power . In particular,
federal policymakers must take meaningful action to address
and redirect the hundreds of billions of dollars in private
finance being poured into the expansion of oil, gas, and coal.107

Fossil Fuel Phase Out Requires a Just Transition

Engaging with workers, communities, and tribal nations in the transition away from fossil fuels to a 100% renewable energy
economy must be a central ingredient of any climate platform pursued by the next president and Congress . Plans to phase
out fossil fuel production and consumption will necessarily impact workers in those industries and communities across the
U.S. A participatory process should be put in place to ensure those workers, communities, and tribal nations are left better
off through the transition. While not a focus of this report, a wide range of groups have highlighted both the promise of a
just transition, as well as components of what a successful plan might look like . The recent momentum around a Green New
Deal, which centers strong labor protections as a core ingredient, has also sparked important conversations about the scale
of investment needed and the scope of protections necessary to uplift all workers.

Numerous analyses have noted that the energy transition needed to address climate change also holds the potential to
create large numbers of new, well-paying jobs in sustainable industries, both in the United States108 and around the world .109
But this outcome is far from guaranteed, and in practice the renewable energy sector has often produced non-unionized
jobs with weaker wages and benefits than the fossil fuel jobs they claim to be replacing. Policymakers must strengthen
labor standards and protections for the clean energy sector, while also providing sufficient  investment in social programs to
facilitate the transition .

Purely economic solutions will not be enough without a process that empowers people and strengthens communities .
Accordingly, a just transition should focus not solely on job creation, but also on reorienting toward a regenerative economy
rather than an extractive one,110 one that promotes self-determination, redistributes power and resources, retains culture
and tradition,111 and moves us toward “Buen Vivir,” or “good living .”112

In practice, this will involve setting up processes to foster dialogue between stakeholders, as well as committing significant
funding and resources to specific programs and policies. Just transition policies that have been identified include social
protection programs, strong labor standards and labor market policies, job training, income support, pension guarantees,
and targeted investments for specific communities.113,114 The Green New Deal has begun a process to turn these ideas into
policies, but the next president and Congress will have a great responsibility to ensure that the transition ahead of us is
imbued with justice and equitable participation .

Below, we lay out some specific actions the next president
and Congress should take to meaningfully constrain U .S . fossil
fuel production while supporting workers, communities, and
tribal nations in the transition to a renewable energy-based
economy . This is not a comprehensive list of climate policies
or just transition recommendations, but rather a selection
of actions focused on limiting the growth of the U .S . fossil
fuel industry — and managing a wind-down of fossil fuel
production — that the next president and Congress should
champion as part of an ambitious Green New Deal to mobilize
the U .S . economy toward 100% renewable energy .

Executive Actions for the
Next President

|| End federal fossil fuel leasing by executive action on
Day One. The president has clear executive authority to
regulate fossil fuel leasing on federal lands and waters . A
policy of no new leasing of coal, oil and gas on public lands
is an essential down payment on the fossil fuel phase out
that is needed to limit warming to 1.5°C.

|| Set ambitious targets for a fossil fuel phase out.
A critical step in achieving restrictions on fossil fuel
production is measuring and reporting the scale of the
problem . The president should clearly identify the climate
risks associated with continued fossil fuel production
and set national targets, with regular milestones, for
a production phase out in concert with other climate
policies .

|| Fully account for the costs of climate change in federal
permitting and decision-making. The president should
also issue guidance requiring a full consequential lifecycle
analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and impacts under
the National Environmental Policy Act for all significant
federal actions .

|| Make strong appointments to critical federal agencies.
The next president will need to appoint strong leaders to
positions at the Department of the Interior, Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, Council on
Environmental Quality, FERC, and other federal energy
agencies who understand the need for a fossil fuel

phase out and can effectively marshal all existing federal
authorities to implement it . A designated ‘climate czar’ or
an interdepartmental commission on fossil fuel phase out
could be useful coordinating structures .

terminals are not in the national interest — as they would
facilitate greater carbon emissions that would harm
Americans — and federal regulatory agencies should be
given the authority to reject those projects .

|| Restore, strengthen and fully enforce public health
and clean air and water protections. The Trump
administration has sought to systematically erode existing
federal regulations to protect our environment and ensure
healthy communities . The next president should restore,
strengthen, and fully enforce regulations to reduce air
and water pollution in line with health-based standards,
which are critical to protect vulnerable communities at
the frontlines of fossil fuel extraction and consumption . In
addition, the next president should restore and strengthen
critical regulations to limit methane leakage and flaring
from oil and gas infrastructure, in order to mitigate
additional climate harms while fossil fuel infrastructure is
being phased out .

Cutting Off Government Support for
Fossil Fuel Production

The next Congress and president should work together to:

|| End subsidies and finance for fossil fuel production.
It is unconscionable that federal and state governments
continue to provide more than $20 billion a year in
production subsidies to the fossil fuel industry through
direct subsidies, tax giveaways, and public finance for
fossil fuels .115 The next president and Congress should
swiftly eliminate subsidies for coal, oil, and gas production
and ensure that federal agencies such as the Overseas
Private Investment Corporation and the Export-Import
Bank end financing for fossil fuel projects.

|| Restore the crude oil export ban, and expand it to
other fossil fuels. As this report has illustrated, fossil
fuel exports undermine emissions reductions earned
from domestic climate policies . Unrestricted exports of
crude oil are a climate threat of Congress’s own making .
Congress should reinstate this ban, and impose additional
bans on the export of liquified natural gas, coal, and other
fossil fuel products .

|| Establish a new climate test mandate. Congress should
ensure that federal regulatory agencies have the authority
to disapprove new fossil fuel infrastructure such as
pipelines, refineries, and export terminals that would
increase greenhouse gas emissions . Congress should

Actions for Governors and
State Legislatures

We call on state governors and legislatures to address
fossil fuel extraction permits within their purview . States
should enact policies to phase out fossil fuel permitting,
consistent with national targets, in a manner that addresses
environmental justice and just transition concerns . One initial
step would be to apply a minimum buffer zone, or setback,
around homes, schools and hospitals where oil and gas
production should be phased out .

Decades of failed leadership have brought us to this moment
of crisis . Words are no longer an adequate response — we
demand rapid and ambitious action from our elected leaders .
For the next president and Congress, real climate leadership
means not only saying yes to real solutions like a rapid
transition to renewable energy with equitable ownership
and participation, but also saying no to the destructive
impacts of fossil fuel extraction . A transformative Green
New Deal means all of these things, and making it a reality
means putting justice and equity for vulnerable workers and
communities front and center in the transition to a clean and
prosperous future .

69  The fraction of decreased demand that goes to increased exports or

decreased refinery inputs is a free parameter in the model that we set to
0 .5 for this analysis . Larger values imply a larger fraction of direct crude
oil exports, while smaller values imply a larger fraction of refined product
exports . See the Appendix for more details .

70  For this analysis we use lifecycle emissions from a barrel of crude to

equal 510 kg CO2-eq/bbl, which is the median U .S . crude oil (U .S . East

72  See the literature review in Erickson & Lazarus 2018, Box 1, p . 3, which
cites a range from 0 .2 to 0 .6 for the replacement fraction . This analysis
assumes that the global oil market will respond consistent with this
range of elasticities, and that OPEC or other producing nations will not
coordinate to target production levels. See also Bordoff, J. & T. Houser.
