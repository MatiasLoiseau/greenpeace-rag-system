REPORT JUNE 2008Food Security and
Climate Change: The answer isbiodiversity
A review of scientific publications on
climate change adaptation in agriculture

2Greenpeace InternationalClimate change will profoundly affect agriculture worldwide.
Food security in many countries is under threat fromunpredictable changes in rainfall and more frequent extremeweather. Farmers in poorer countries with harsh climateconditions will likely be most affected. 
A review of recent scientific literature underlines that the most
effective strategy to adapt agriculture to climate change is toincrease biodiversity. A mix of different crops and varieties inone field is a proven and highly reliable farming method toincrease resilience to erratic weather changes. And, the bestways to increase stress tolerance in single varieties aremodern breeding technologies that do not entail geneticengineering, such as Marker Assisted Selection. In contrast,there is no evidence that genetically engineered (GE) plantscan ever play any role to increase food security in a changingclimate. Impact of climate change on agriculture
and food security
Some of the most profound and direct impacts of climate change
over the next few decades will be on agriculture and food systems(Brown and Funk 2008). All quantitative assessments show thatclimate change will adversely affect food security (Schmidhuber andTubiello 2007).
Increasing temperatures, declining and more unpredictable rainfall,
more frequent extreme weather and higher severity of pest anddisease are among the more drastic changes that would impact food production (Parry et al. 2007, Kotschi 2007, Morton 2007,Brown and Funk 2008, Lobell et al. 2008). However, global trendsmask tremendous regional differences, with the poorest being mostat risk both by global climate variations and global commodity pricefluctuations (Diaz et al. 2006). Some of the most important effects of global climate change will be felt among smallholder farmers,predominantly in developing countries (Morton 2007). 
The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report
predicts the probability of more heat waves, heavy rainfall, droughtsand other extreme weather throughout the 21st century (Parry et al.2007). 
Warming in the Indian Ocean and an increasingly “El Niño–like”
climate could reduce main-season precipitation across most of Africa,East and South Asia, and Central and South America (see Figure 1)(Brown and Funk 2008). 
It has been shown that by 2080, the 40 poorest countries, located
predominantly in tropical Africa and Latin America, could lose 10 to20 percent of their basic grain growing capacity due to drought(Kotschi 2007). The biggest problem for food security will be thepredicted increase in extreme weather, which will damage crops atparticular developmental stages and make the timing of farming moredifficult, reducing farmers’ incentives to cultivate (Morton 2007).

Biodiversity – a natural insurance 
policy against climate change
Diversity farming is the single most important modern technology to
achieve food security in a changing climate. Scientists have shownthat diversity provides a natural insurance policy against majorecosystem changes, be it in the wild or in agriculture (McNaughton1977, Chapin et al. 2000, Diaz et al. 2006). It is now predicted thatgenetic diversity will be most crucial in highly variable environmentsand those under rapid human-induced climate change (Reusch et al.2005, Hajjar et al. 2008, Hughes et al. 2008).
The larger the number of different species or varieties present in one
field or in an ecosystem, the greater the probability that at least someof them can cope with changing conditions. Species diversity alsoreduces the probability of pests and diseases by diluting theavailability of their hosts (Chapin et al. 2000). It is an age old insurancepolicy of farming communities to hedge their risks and plant diversecrops or varieties. The strategy is not to maximise yield in an optimumyear, but to maximise yield over years, good and bad, by decreasingthe chance of crop failure in a bad year (Altieri 1990). This diversification strategy is backed by a wealth of recent scientificdata:
•In a unique cooperation project among Chinese scientists andfarmers in Yunnan during 1998 and 1999, researchers calculatedthe effect of diversity on the severity of rice blast, the major diseaseof rice (Zhu et al. 2000). They showed that disease-susceptible ricevarieties planted with resistant varieties had an 89 percent greateryield than when they were grown in a monoculture. Mixed varietiesof rice produced more grain per hectare than their correspondingmonocultures in all cases; close to 20 percent more land is neededin a monoculture to produce the same amount of hybrid andglutinous rice as was produced in a mixture (Zhu et al. 2000). Theexperiment was so successful that fungicidal sprays were no longerapplied by the end of the two-year programme. The practiceexpanded to more than 40,000 hectares in 2000, and now includessome varieties that were formerly locally extinct (Zhu et al, 2003).This is especially remarkable as the yield gains were on top ofalready high average yields in the region, at nearly 10 tonnes perhectare; among the highest in the world (Zhu et al. 2000). Thisshows that greater rice diversity means lower rates of plant diseaseand greater yields while conserving genetic diversity, all at minimalcost for farmers and the environment.

4Greenpeace International •Off the German coast, a genetically diverse area of seagrass 
was not only able to survive a heat wave, but experienced 26-34percent more growth than seagrass monocultures (Reusch et al,2005), showing how genetic diversity increases the ability for plantsto recover after a perturbation, while genetic monocultures have alimited short-term ability to respond to extreme climatic events.
•In Italy, a high level of genetic diversity within wheat fields on non-irrigated farms reduces risk of crop failure during dry conditions. A scenario where rainfall declines by 20 percent, the wheat yieldwould fall sharply, but when diversity is increased by 2 percent, this decline can not only be reversed but above average yieldsachieved (Di Falco and Chavas 2006, 2008). 
•Agronomists in the United States compared corn yields betweenfields planted as monocultures and those with various levels ofintercropping in Michigan over three years. They found the yields in fields with the highest diversity (three crops, plus three covercrops) were over 100 percent higher than in continuousmonocultures. Crop diversity improved soil fertility, reducing theneed to use chemical inputs while maintaining high yields (Smith et al, 2008).
There is abundant scientific evidence that crop biodiversity has animportant role to play in the adaptation to our changing environment.While oversimplified farming systems, such as monocultures ofgenetically identical plants, would not be able to cope with a changing climate, increasing the biodiversity of an agro-ecosystemcan help maintain its long-term productivity and contributesignificantly to food security. Genetic diversity within a field provides a buffer against losses caused by environmental change, pests anddiseases. Genetic diversity provides the resilience needed for areliable and stable, long-term food production (Diaz et al, 2006). 
Analysis of past environment changes that resulted in dramatic
famines (e.g. Ireland’s potato famine and Ethiopia 1965-1997) shows specialised monocultures are highly vulnerable (Fraser, 2007).
In addition to enhancing food security and climate resilience, 
diversity in the field also delivers important ecosystem services.Variety mixtures that are tolerant to drought and flood not onlyincrease productivity, but also prevent soil erosion and desertification,increase soil organic matter and help stabilise slopes (Hajjar et al,2008). Benefits for farmers include reducing the need for costlypesticides, receiving price premiums for valued traditional varietiesand improving their dietary diversity and health (reference, Hajjar et al, 2008).The IAASTD on Climate Change 
The International Assessment of Agricultural Science andTechnology for Development (IAASTD), also known as the WorldAgriculture Report, was finalised in April 2008. This report,initiated by the World Bank and written by over 400 scientistsfrom around the world, is comparable in its scope to the work ofthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It reflects theglobal scientific community’s views on agriculture and wasendorsed by nearly 60 governments. In its Global Summary forDecision Makers, it states: 
“To address expected climate change challenges and impacts, a
major role for AKST [agricultural knowledge, science andtechnology] is needed to increase adaptive capacity and enhanceresilience through purposeful biodiversity management. Optionsinclude irrigation management, water harvesting andconservation technologies, diversification of agriculture systems,the protection of agrobiodiversity and screening germplasm fortolerance to climate change.”
In the IAASTD Synthesis Report, a specific section deals with
climate change issues in agriculture and outlines the followingadaptation options:
“- changing varieties/species to fit more appropriately to the
changing thermal and/or hydrological conditions;  
- changing timing of irrigation and adjusting nutrient
management;  
- applying water-conserving technologies and promoting agro-
biodiversity for increased resilience of the agricultural systems;  
- altering timing or location of cropping activities and the
diversification of agriculture.”  
With regard to GE crops, the IAASTD global report, chapter 6,
states: “Due to a combination of difficult to understand gene byenvironment interactions and experience to date with creatingtransgenic plants, some plant scientists are indicating that therate at which transgenic plants will contribute to a sustainedincrease in future global food yields is exaggerated.”

Greenpeace International 5Modern breeding techniques for diverse
genetic traits
In addition to increasing the diversity of crops and varieties in a single
field, increasing the diversity of traits within one variety might helpclimate change adaptation. If each of the single varieties in one fieldhas a higher tolerance to droughts, salinity, floods, storms and pests,the overall resilience to extreme weather events will be higher. 
However, a review of the scientific literature reveals that the method 
of choice is not GE, but traditional and modern conventional breedingtechniques, including Marker Assisted Selection (MAS). There isconsiderable scope for breeding a large number of stress traitsthrough the use of traditional varieties. These stress traits aregenerally regulated by multiple genes, which in turn are tightlycontrolled by complex interactions between genes, and between the plant and its environment. MAS facilitates the selection ofconventional crosses with traits associated with multiple genes,including their as of yet unknown regulatory systems. By contrast,genetic engineering can only crudely insert a single or a few gene(s)without any control over regulatory mechanisms.
In recent years, MAS has yielded breeding successes, including some
plants with traits that might be relevant for climate change resilience,such as drought, heat or cold resistant plants. However, it should beemphasised that none of these varieties alone will be able tocontribute to food security in a changing climate. For erratic weatherwith rapid sequences of droughts, floods, storms and heat waves,only a mixed cropping system using a range of crops and varietiescan provide the necessary diversity and resilience. Some remarkable MAS successes: 
•Rice tolerant to unpredictable floods. Rice production can besubject to stresses such as seasonal flooding, which can beunpredictable and can damage young rice plants. Through geneticmapping researchers identified a DNA segment containing a genethat makes rice tolerant to prolonged submergence in water (Xu etal., 2006; Sasaki, 2006). Using MAS, they successfully bred thistrait into local and hybrid varieties. This allows the breeding of newvarieties resilient to the erratic flooding that may occur as weatherpatterns become less predictable.
•One expected effect of climate change is the spread of disease. A new strain of wheat stem rust (Ug99), a fungus that candevastate wheat crops, is spreading across Africa. Most cultivatedwheat varieties are susceptible to this virulent strain and efforts areunderway to develop resistant wheat using MAS. The techniquewas chosen over GE (Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat, 2008) due to MAS's ability to assist the breeding of complex traits. The breeding programme will use wheat’s genetic diversity to findresistance genes that can be bred into high yielding varieties. Thisshows the importance of preserving the genetic diversity of crops,which are at risk because modern intensive agriculture relies onvery few varieties. 
Even Monsanto, the global genetic engineering giant, features thisbreeding technique in its R&D brochure and states under the heading‘Marker Assisted Breeding’: “Today, the use of breakthroughtechnology has reinvented plant breeding so we can more thandouble the rate of ’genetic gain’ in seeds – the improvement inimportant characteristics such as yield and tolerance to environmentalstress.” Monsanto (2008a) 
These examples are evidence that it is possible to transfer plants’
complex traits, including their regulatory systems, to commercialvarieties using traditional breeding techniques assisted by geneticmarkers. In contrast to this, GE plants have so far failed to deliver onany of the decade-old promises on stress tolerance. Instead, currentGE varieties are particularly susceptible to extreme weather.

What is Marker Assisted Selection?
Marker Assisted Section (MAS, or Marker Assisted Breeding,MAB) is ‘speeded up’ conventional breeding that utilisesknowledge of genes and DNA, but does not result in a GEorganism. Specific DNA fragments (markers), which are closelylinked to specific traits (such as drought tolerance), are identified.After crossing, the offspring is screened for the presence of themarker, and hence the desired trait, without the need to grow theplant under stress conditions. One important advantage of MASover traditional breeding is that ‘linkage drag’, where unwantedtraits are introduced along with desired traits, can be avoided.While MAS uses genetic markers to identify desired traits, nogene is artificially transferred from one organism into another one. 

6Greenpeace InternationalThe limits of genetic engineering
So far, GE crops are restricted to a few traits that were developed
some 20 years ago: herbicide and insect resistance. No stresstolerant GE plants have ever been proven to work under real worldconditions. The performance of existing GE varieties under climatestress is so far sobering:  
•Extreme temperature fluctuations caused crop losses in Bt cotton in China. Researchers investigating the disaster said hightemperatures (37 C) were most probably responsible for causing a drop in Bt concentrations in leaves (Chen et al, 2005). Otherresearchers found that temperature changes, especially a coolperiod early on in the growing season, caused a reduction in theinsect toxicity of Bt (Gunning et al. 2005).
•GE herbicide-resistant soybeans suffered unexpected losses in the US during very hot spring weather in 1998. Roundup Readysoybeans performed significantly worse than conventional varietiesunder conditions of heat stress. The GE soybean stems were morebrittle and split more easily, thus allowing infection to enter(Coghlan, 1999).
•Herbicide tolerant GE soybeans currently on the market have beenreported to have decreased yields of up to 10 percent compared to traditional varieties (Elmore et al, 2001). Massive herbicide use inconjunction with these GE plants has already led to an increase intolerant weed populations (Nandula et al, 2005). For example, 34cases of glyphosate resistance in nine species have beendocumented in the US since 2000 (www.weedscience.org). Now it is recommended farmers have to spray stronger formulas of herbicides (Monsanto, 2008b), and mixtures of herbicides(Brooks, 2003), adding to costs. 
Even if GE might be able to deliver a heat tolerant plant in 10 or 20 years, what would happen to the plant under extreme coldconditions, unseasonable rain or drought? A single gene does not provide protection against a multitude of conditions. 
Currently, most GE stress tolerant plants in the pipeline use a rather
crude approach of over expressing a single gene throughout theplant’s life cycle (Garg et al, 2002). This approach is no match for the whole genome network that controls gene expression in naturalplants, where genes are switched on and off and moderatedthroughout the plant’s lifetime. By contrast, the inserted gene in the GE plant is on all the time, in all parts of the plant, with no othercontrol. It is like an air conditioner always running at full speed – which could prove deadly in winter. In summary, GE plants: 
•Will provide no security against extreme weather changes. In a bestcase scenario, they may be resistant to a single stress, such asheat or drought, but not to the expected rapid and radical weatherchanges; 
•Will lack any sophisticated regulation of the inserted gene and thuscannot respond to changing challenges; 
•Because of their higher price, they will most likely be planted inmonocultures, which have the highest risk of failing in changeableand extreme weather. 
Given genetic engineering’s limitations and our limited knowledgeabout plants’ regulated response to environmental stress,unregulated single-trait GE crops are a threat to food security in achanging climate. The prospect of large monocultures of GE plantsfailing completely under unforeseen weather events is a recipe fordisaster. 
Conclusions
Bio-diverse farming is a proven, effective strategy to adapt to climatechange. Through it we can create farms that are able to maintain andincrease food production in the face of increasingly unpredictableconditions. In contrast, GE has inherent shortcomings pertaining toplant-environment interactions and complex gene regulations thatmake it unlikely to address climate change either reliably or in thelong-term. This conclusion is also reflected in the recent IAASTDreport, which considered GE crops to be irrelevant to achieving theMillennium Development Goals and to eradicating hunger. 
Agriculture will not only be negatively affected by climate change, it 
is a substantial contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. By reducingagriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions and by using farmingtechniques that increase soil carbon, farming itself can contribute tomitigating climate change (Bellarby, J. et al. 2007). In fact, many bio-diverse farming systems are both mitigation and adaptationstrategies, as they increase soil carbon and use cropping systemsthat are more resilient to extreme weather. 
In order to increase our food security in a changing climate, policy
makers need to follow the IAASTD’s recommendations and investmore in agricultural R&D that is geared towards modern, effective,bio-diverse farming. A one-sided focus on GE plants contradicts allscientific findings on climate change adaptation in agriculture, and is a long-term threat to global food security.
