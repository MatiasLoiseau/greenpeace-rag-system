Executive
summary

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) aims to reduce the climate
impact of burning fossil fuels by capturing carbon dioxide (CO2)
from power station smokestacks and disposing of it underground.
Its future development has been widely promoted by the coal
industry as a justification for the construction of new coal-fired
power plants. However, the technology is largely unproven and will
not be ready in time to save the climate.

This report, based on peer-reviewed independent
scientific research shows that:

CCS cannot deliver in time to avoid dangerous
climate change. The earliest possibility for deployment
of CCS at utility scale is not expected before 2030.1 To
avoid the worst impacts of climate change, global
greenhouse gas emissions have to start falling after 2015,
just seven years away.

CCS wastes energy. The technology uses between 10
and 40% of the energy produced by a power station.2
Wide scale adoption of CCS is expected to erase the
efficiency gains of the last 50 years, and increase
resource consumption by one third.3

Storing carbon underground is risky. Safe and
permanent storage of CO2 cannot be guaranteed. Even
very low leakage rates could undermine any climate
mitigation efforts.

CCS is expensive. It could lead to a doubling of plant
costs, and an electricity price increase of 21-91%.4
Money spent on CCS will divert investments away from
sustainable solutions to climate change.

CCS carries significant liability risks. It poses a threat
to health, ecosystems and the climate. It is unclear how
severe these risks will be.

The climate crisis requires urgent action. Climate scientists
warn that to avoid the worst effects, global greenhouse
gas emissions must peak by 2015 and then start falling by
at least 50% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. Coal is
the most polluting of all fossil fuels, and the single greatest
threat to the climate. If current plans to invest hundreds of
billions of dollars in coal plants are realised, CO2 emissions
from coal could increase 60% by 2030.

Concerns about the feasibility, costs, safety, and liability of
CCS make it a dangerous gamble. A survey of 1000
“climate decision-makers and influencers” around the
world reveals substantial doubt in the ability of CCS to
deliver. Just 34% were confident that retrofitting ‘clean
coal technology’ to existing power plants could reduce
CO2 emissions over the next 25 years without
unacceptable side effects, and only 36% were confident
in its ability to deliver low-carbon energy from new power
stations.5

The real solutions to stopping dangerous climate change
lie in renewable energy and energy efficiency that can start
protecting the climate today. Huge reductions in energy
demand are possible with efficiency measures that save
more money than they cost to implement. Technically
accessible renewable energy sources – such as wind,
wave and solar- are capable of providing six times more
energy than the world currently consumes – forever.

“CCS will arrive on the battlefield far too
late to help the world avoid dangerous
climate change.”7

Greenpeace’s Energy [R]evolution6 provides a practical
blueprint that shows how renewable energy, combined
with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2
emissions by almost 50%, and deliver half the world’s
energy needs by 2050.

What is CCS?

CCS is an integrated process, made up of three distinct
parts: carbon capture, transport, and storage (including
measurement, monitoring and verification).

Capture technology aims to produce a concentrated
stream of CO2 that can be compressed, transported, and
stored. Transport of captured CO2 to storage locations is
most likely to be via pipeline.

Storage of the captured carbon is the final part of the
process. The vast majority of CO2 storage is expected to
occur in geological sites on land, or below the seabed.
Disposing of waste CO2 in the ocean has also been
proposed but this method has been largely discounted due
to the significant impacts CO2 would have on the ocean
ecosystem and legal constraints that effectively prohibit it.

CCS cannot deliver in time

The urgency of the climate crisis means solutions must be
ready for large-scale use as soon as possible. CCS simply
cannot deliver in time. As the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) says “CCS will arrive on the battlefield
far too late to help the world avoid dangerous climate
change”8 At present, there are no large-scale coal-fired
power plants in the world capturing carbon, let alone any
that are integrated with storage operations.9

The earliest CCS may be technically feasible at utility scale
is 2030.10 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) does not expect CCS to become
commercially viable until at least the second half of this
century.11 Even then, plants responsible for 40-70% of
electricity sector CO2 emissions will not be suitable for
carbon capture’.12

Despite this, CCS is being used as an excuse by power
companies and utilities to push ahead with plans to build
new coal-fired power plants; branding them “capture-
ready.” The International Energy Agency (IEA) describes a
“capture-ready” plant as one “which can be retrofitted
with CO2 capture when the necessary regulatory or
economic drivers are in place”.13 This definition is broad
enough to make any station theoretically “capture-ready”,
and the term meaningless.

6

The very real danger of “capture-ready” power stations is
that promises to retrofit are unlikely to be kept. Retrofits
are very expensive and can carry such high efficiency
losses that plants become uneconomic.14 Furthermore,
even if a plant is technically suitable for carbon capture
there is no guarantee that there will be accessible
storage locations.

In the UK, a proposed new coal-fired power plant at
Kingsnorth, Kent, is being sold as “capture ready”; able to
incorporate CCS should the technology ever become
available in the future. However, no one has any idea if
and when this might be. In the meantime, and possibly for
its entire lifetime, Kingsnorth (if built) will pump out around
8 million tonnes of CO2 per year, an amount equivalent to
the total annual CO2 emissions of Ghana.15

If CCS is ever able to deliver at all, it will be too little,
too late.

CCS wastes energy

Capturing and storing carbon uses lots of energy,
anywhere from 10-40% of a power station’s capacity.16 An
energy penalty of just 20% would require the construction
of an extra power station for every four built.17

These reductions in efficiency will require more coal to be
mined, transported, and burned, for a power station to
produce the same amount of energy as it did without
CCS.

CCS will also use more precious resources. Power
stations with capture technology will need 90% more
freshwater than those without. This will worsen water
shortages, already aggravated by climate change.18
Overall, wide-scale adoption of CCS is expected to erase
the efficiency gains of the last 50 years, and increase
resource consumption by one third.19

Storing carbon underground is risky

The IEA estimates that for CCS to deliver any meaningful
climate mitigation effects by 2050, 6000 projects each
injecting a million tonnes of CO2 per year into the ground
would be required.20 At the moment, it is not clear that it
will be technically feasible to capture and bury this much
carbon, i.e. whether there are enough storage sites, or that
they will be located close enough to power plants.
Transport of CO2 over distances greater than 100
kilometres is likely to be prohibitively expensive.21

Efforts to capture CO2 make no sense if there is not
adequate accessible space to store it permanently. Even if
it is feasible to bury hundreds of thousands of gigatonnes
of CO2 there is no way to guarantee that storage locations
will be appropriately designed and managed over the
timescales required.

As long as CO2 is in geological sites, there is a risk of
leakage. While it is not currently possible to quantify the
exact risks, any CO2 release has the potential to impact
the surrounding environment; air, groundwater or soil.
Continuous leakage, even at rates as low as 1%, could
negate climate mitigation efforts.22 Remediation may be
possible for CO2 leaks, but there is no track record or cost
estimates for these measures.23

A natural example of the danger of CO2 leakage occurred
at Lake Nyos, Cameroon in 1986. Following a volcanic
eruption, large quantities of CO2 that had accumulated on
the bottom of the lake were suddenly release, killing 1700
people and thousands of cattle over a range of 25 km.24

In the US, the Department of Energy has asked for a
26.4% budget increase for CCS-related programmes (to
US$623.6 million) while at the same time scaling back
renewable energy and efficiency research by 27.1% (to
US$146.2 million). 29 Australia has three research centres
for fossil fuels, including one committed to CCS; there is
not one for renewable energy technology.30 The
Norwegian government recently committed 20 billion
NOK (US$4 billion) for two CCS projects at the expense
of investment in renewable technologies.

Spending money on CSS is diverting urgent funding away
from renewable energy solutions for the climate crisis.
Even assuming that at some stage carbon capture
becomes technically feasible, commercially viable,
capable of long-term storage and environmentally safe, it
would still only have a limited impact and would come at a
high cost. In contrast, as Greenpeace’s Futu[r]e
Investment report shows, investing in a renewable energy
future would save US$180 billion annually and cut CO2
emissions in half by 2050.31

CCS is expensive and undermines funding
for sustainable solutions

CCS and liability: risky business

Large-scale applications of CCS pose significant liability
risks, including negative health effects and damage to
ecosystems, groundwater contamination including
pollution of drinking water, and increased greenhouse gas
emissions resulting from leakage. There is no reliable
basis for estimating the probability or severity of these
risks. As current regulations are not designed to
adequately manage them, significant questions as to who
is liable remain unanswered 32

Industry views liability as a barrier to wider deployment of
CCS33 and is unwilling to fully invest in CCS without a
framework that protects it from long-term liability. The risk
is so great that some utilities are unwilling to make CO2
available for storage unless they are relieved of ownership
upon transfer of the CO2 off the property of the power
station.34 Potential operators are urging that they only
retain legal liability for permanently stored carbon for ten
years.35

While cost estimates for CCS vary considerably, one thing
is certain – it is extremely expensive.

CCS will require significant funding to construct the power
station and necessary infrastructure to transport and store
carbon. Existing policy mechanisms, such as a price on
carbon, would need to be significantly increased (by as
much as five times higher than their current levels) and
supplemented by additional policy commitments and
financial incentives.25

The US Department of Energy (US DOE) calculates that
installing carbon capture systems will almost double plant
costs.26 This will lead to electricity price hikes of anywhere
between 21 and 91%.27

Providing the substantial levels of support needed to get
CCS off the ground comes at the expense of real
solutions. Current research shows electricity generated
from coal-fired power stations equipped with CCS will be
more expensive than other less-polluting sources, such as
wind power and many types of sustainable biomass.28

In recent years, coal’s share of research and development
budgets in countries pursuing CCS has ballooned.
Meanwhile, funding for renewable technologies and
efficiency has stagnated or declined.

7

A survey of 1000 “climate decision-makers and influencers” around
the world reveals substantial doubt about CCS. Just 34% were
confident that retrofitting ‘clean coal technology’ could reduce CO2
emissions over the next 25 years without unacceptable side effects,
and only 36% were confident in its ability to deliver low carbon
energy with new power stations. In contrast, 74% expressed
confidence in solar hot water, 62% in offshore wind farms, and 60%
in onshore wind farms.36

Many nations have recognised the potential of these true
climate solutions and are pressing ahead with ambitious
plans for energy revolutions within their borders. New
Zealand plans to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-
century. Renewable energy and energy efficiency, not
CCS, are leading the way. New Zealand already obtains
70% of its electricity from renewable resources and aims
to increase it to 90% by 2025.43 In Germany, renewable
energy use has increased 300% in the past 10 years. In
the US, over 5,200 megawatts (MW) of wind energy were
installed in 2007, accounting for 30% of new power
installed that year; an increase of 45% in one year.44

The urgency of the climate crisis means solutions must be
ready for large-scale deployment in the short-term. CCS
simply cannot deliver in time. The technology is highly
speculative, risky and unlikely to be technically feasible in
the next twenty years. Letting CCS be used as a
smokescreen for building new coal-fired power stations is
unacceptable and irresponsible. “Capture ready” coal
plants pose a significant threat to the climate.

The world can fight climate change but only if it reduces
its dependence on fossil fuels, particularly coal.
Renewable energy and energy efficiency are safe, cost-
effective solutions that carry none of the risks of CCS, and
are available today to cut emissions and save the climate.

CCS proponents are demanding almost complete legal
protection from governments, including mechanisms that
completely shield operators from legal challenges, transfer
ownership to government and/or limit the amount of
money that can be recouped should damage occur.37 It is
expected that the public will assume the risk for, and pay
for the damages resulting from, CO2 storage projects.

The extent of support offered to the recently collapsed
FutureGen project in the US gives some idea of the real
costs of CCS. FutureGen was the Bush Administration’s
flagship CCS project, a public-private partnership between
the US government and industry giants including Rio Tinto
and American Electric Power Service Corp. FutureGen not
only was promised unprecedented public funds (to the
tune of US$1.3 billion) but was also protected from
financial and legal liability in the event of an unanticipated
release of carbon dioxide,38 indemnified from lawsuits, and
even had its insurance policies paid for.39

The world already has the solutions
to the climate crisis

Investment in CCS risks locking the world into an energy
future that fails to save the climate. Those technologies
with the greatest potential to provide energy security and
reduce emissions, and to provide renewable energy and
energy efficiency, need to be prioritised.

Greenpeace’s Energy [R]evolution blueprint shows how
renewable energy, combined with greater energy
efficiency, can cut global CO2 emissions by almost 50%,
and deliver half the world’s energy needs by 2050.40

The renewable energy market is booming; in 2007, global
annual investment in renewables exceeded US$100
billion.41 Decades of technological progress have seen
renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines,
solar photovoltaic panels, biomass power plants and solar
thermal collectors move steadily into the mainstream. The
same climate decision-makers who were sceptical about
CCS believed far more in the ability of renewable
technologies to deliver reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions: 74% expressed confidence in solar hot water,
62% in offshore wind farms, and 60% in onshore wind
farms.42

Introduction

This report starts by giving a technical introduction to
carbon capture and storage, explaining the process as
well as the system components. It then details why CCS
technology will not be ready in time to save the climate
and also explains how CCS being used as a
smokescreen to get the green light to build new coal-fired
power plants. It then moves on to look at how CCS
technology actually wastes energy by making power
plants less efficient.

Next, the report considers the substantial challenges
related to storing massive quantities of CO2 underground
and the fact that safe and permanent storage cannot be
guaranteed, as well as the many risks posed by CO2
leakage. After this, the report details how large-scale
applications of CCS are prohibitively expensive and
threaten to undermine investments in renewable energy
and energy efficiency measures urgently needed to save
the climate.

The report then considers the significant environmental,
economic, legal, political, technological and sustainability
risks associated with CCS. It details how current
regulations are not designed to adequately manage
these, leaving unanswered significant questions as to
who is liable.

Finally, the report outlines how the world already has the
real solutions to the climate crisis. Greenpeace’s Energy
[R]evolution provides a practical blueprint that shows how
renewable energy combined with greater energy efficiency
can cut global CO2 emissions by almost 50%, and deliver
half the world’s energy by 2050.45

CCS technically
speaking

The following review is by no means exhaustive, but is intended to
provide a general understanding of the different stages of carbon
capture, transport and storage, as well as the system components.

CCS aims to capture carbon dioxide resulting from
various combustion and industrial processes, and store it
underground or below the sea floor. Its application is
proposed for large point sources of CO2, such as fossil
fuel power stations.

As an integrated process, CCS consists of three distinct
components: carbon capture, transport and storage
(including measurement, monitoring and verification).
These components are explained in greater detail below.

Capture

By far the most energy intensive portion of the CCS
process, carbon capture produces a concentrated stream
of CO2 that can be compressed, transported, and
eventually stored. Depending on the process or power
station in question, three approaches to capture exist;
pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxyfuel
combustion. Pre- and post-combustion capture rates are
typically between 85-95% of the CO2 emitted, while
oxyfuel combustion capture rates are nearer to 98%.46

Pre-combustion capture systems remove CO2 prior to
combustion. This is accomplished via gasification.
Gasification of fossil fuels produces a “synthesis gas”
(syngas), which is primarily a mixture of carbon monoxide,
methane and hydrogen. Before combustion, the syngas is
reacted with steam to produce CO2 that is then scrubbed
from the gas stream, usually by a physical or chemical
absorption process.47 Pre-combustion systems are not a
mature market technology but are intended for
deployment in conjunction with Integrated Gasification
and Combined Cycle (IGCC) power stations. However,
significant engineering challenges need to be overcome
before large-scale integration of coal-based IGCC and
CCS can occur.48

Post-combustion techniques are the standard practice
for removing pollutants, such as sulphur, from the flue gas
of coal-fired power stations. Flue gas typically contains up
to 14% CO2, which must be separated either through
absorption (chemical or physical), cryogenics or
membrane technologies. For CO2 capture, chemical
absorption with amines, such as monoethanolamine
(MEA), is currently the process of choice.49 Once
recovered, the CO2 is cooled, dried and compressed for
transport. Post-combustion systems are promoted as a
possible carbon mitigation solution for existing coal-fired
power plants worldwide.

11

“There is no operational experience with
carbon capture from coal plants and
certainly not with an integrated
sequestration operation.”50 It is believed
that the earliest CCS might become
feasible is 2030.51

Oxyfuel combustion burns fossil fuels in 95% pure
oxygen instead of air. This results in a flue gas with high
CO2 concentrations (greater than 80%) that can be
condensed and compressed for transport and storage.
Substantial issues relating to controlling combustion and
the cost of producing oxygen must be overcome before
this technology is viable.52 To date, this form of carbon
capture has only been demonstrated at laboratory and
pilot scale (up to 3 MW).53

Transport

Once CO2 has been captured, it needs to be transported
to a storage location. Options for moving the gas from
one location to another include pipelines, ships, rail and
road transport. Cost considerations and proximity to
water bodies leaves pipelines as the likely choice for most
CCS operations.54

Transporting carbon dioxide via pipelines requires
compression of the gas to a supercritical (dense) or liquid
state to reduce its volume. It also requires a dry, pure
stream of CO2 to reduce the risk of pipeline corrosion.
Though mixed wet streams of CO2 can be transported
they may require the use of corrosion-resistant steel,
which is more expensive than the materials typically
used.55 The dangers associated with transporting CO2 are
relatively low as it is neither flammable nor explosive.
However, CO2 is denser than air and tends to pool in low-
lying, poorly ventilated areas posing a hazard to human
health if it reaches concentration levels higher than 3% by
volume.56

Pipeline transport of CO2 is currently used in the US. Over
2500 km of CO2 pipelines exist in the western half of the
country where 50 million tons57 (Mt)CO2/yr (an amount
equivalent to the annual output of about sixteen 500 MW
coal-fired power stations) is carried to enhanced oil
recovery (EOR) projects in west Texas and elsewhere.58
Currently, no such infrastructure exists in Europe.59 The
construction of a dedicated network of pipelines for the
movement of CO2 from power stations to disposal sites is
likely to require a considerable outlay of capital.60

Storage

The final component of CCS is storage, i.e. the long-term
isolation of CO2 from the atmosphere. A number of
“storage options” and associated techniques are in
different stages of research and development. They
include methods for ocean and geological storage. As
well as the actual physical storage of CO2 in these
locations, the subsequent measuring, monitoring and
verification processes needed to ensure that the integrity
of the storage site is maintained are under development.

Ocean storage is the disposal of CO2 into the water
column or at the seabed in deep waters. However, major
concerns regarding both the efficacy and direct adverse
impacts around the injection site means this approach is
now largely discredited.

There is no question that oceans serve as natural carbon
sinks; CO2 in the atmosphere gradually dissolves into
ocean surface waters until an equilibrium is reached.
Oceans have absorbed about 500 gigatonnes (Gt) CO2 of
the total 1,300 GtCO2 emitted by human processes in
the past 200 years.61 Proponents of ocean storage of
CO2 seek to “accelerate” this natural process by injecting
CO2 directly into the water or directly on the ocean floor
via pipelines. However, the storage is not permanent.
Once in the ocean, the CO2 eventually dissolves,
disperses and returns to the atmosphere as part of the
global carbon cycle. Some computer models estimate
that injected CO2 would be isolated from the atmosphere
for several hundred years at most, with the length of
storage dependent on injection depth.62

In addition to lack of permanency, there are many other
substantial concerns with ocean storage. CO2 stored in
this way cannot be easily monitored or controlled and
negative impacts on the ocean environment due to
acidification and other changes in ocean chemistry are
unavoidable.63 Ocean storage remains in research stages,
and has not yet been deployed or demonstrated even at
pilot scale.64 International legal instruments, such as the
London Protocol65 and OSPAR Convention, already
effectively prohibit it.

Carbon capture and storage at a glance

Carbon capture is the most energy-intensive part of the process.
Carbon capture systems have yet to be applied to a single utility scale
coal-fired power station anywhere in the world. Costs for installation
are estimated to result in a near doubling of plant costs. Retrofits
could be even more costly.

CO2 can be transported to a storage location via pipelines,
ships, rail or road transport. Cost considerations and
proximity to water bodies leaves pipelines as the likely
choice for most CCS operations.

The construction of a network of pipelines for CCS is
likely to require a considerable outlay of capital. Costs
will depend on a number of factors. Pipelines built near
population centres or on difficult terrain will be more
expensive. Costs also increase the further CO2 needs to
be transported.

Capture

Transport

Storage

Geological storage injects CO2 into
permeable rock formations deep below
the Earth’s surface. The IEA estimates
that by 2050, at least 6000 storage
projects, each injecting a million tonnes
of CO2 a year into the ground, need to
be in operation. At present, only three
such storage projects exist worldwide.

It is not currently possible to quantify the exact
risk of leakage, however any CO2 release has the
potential to impact the surrounding environment;
air, groundwater or soil. A leakage rate as low as
1% could undermine any climate benefit of CCS.

Ocean storage of CO2 has largely been ruled
out due to unavoidable negative impacts on
the ocean environment from acidification
and other changes in ocean chemistry.

13

Assuming that commercial viability is reached, scenario
studies indicate that by 2050 only 20-40% of global
fossil fuel CO2 emissions could be technically suitable
for capture. This includes 30-60% of emissions from
the power sector.66 Therefore, up to 70% of emissions
from electricity generation in 2050 may not even be
technically suited to CCS.

Geological storage involves the injection of CO2 into
permeable rock formations sealed by impermeable, dense
rock units (cap rocks) more than 800 metres below the
Earth’s surface. In practical terms, both onshore and
offshore sedimentary formations can serve as
repositories. Geological storage involves a combination of
physical and geochemical trapping mechanisms (see
Table 1). One of these mechanisms involves trapping of
CO2 as precipitates or in adsorbed phases via reactions
with aquifer solids. This process, known as mineral
trapping, is slow, and continues over long time frames
compared to solubility trapping (see Figure 1). In this case,
the mechanism of storage involves dissolution or mixing
of CO2 with formation water. When CO2 is pumped into a
reservoir it also displaces formation water. The exact
chemical processes involved depend on both the rock
formation and the purity of the CO2 stream.

The four types of geological sinks that have received the
most attention are: deep saline aquifers, depleted oil and
gas reservoirs, enhanced oil recovery and deep coal
seams.

• Deep saline aquifers are porous rock and contain

very saline water. Their depth and high concentrations
of solids means they hold little economic value,
therefore they are considered appealing storage
locations. Capacity estimates are highly uncertain but
most assume a technical storage potential of at least
1000 Gt of CO2.67 The major obstacle to full exploitation
of this storage option is demonstrating that safety and
environmental protection can be assured.68

Since 1996, a deep saline storage project, Sleipner, has
operated off the coast of Norway, in the North Sea.
Sleipner is a non-power application of carbon storage
that strips CO2 from natural gas as it is brought up from
the sea floor and re-injects it into a deep saline
reservoir, known as the Utsira sandstone formation. The
injection rate for this project is approximately 1 Mt CO2
per year,69 an amount equal to the CO2 emissions from
a typical 150 MW coal-fired power station in the US.70

• Depleted oil and gas reservoirs have a combination
of water and hydrocarbons in their pore spaces as not
all oil and gas can be recovered during exploitation.
These reservoirs are probably the best characterised of
all available storage options. The IPCC Special Report
on CCS estimates that the technical potential for storage
in these reservoirs ranges from 675 to 900 GtCO2.71

• Enhanced oil recovery involves injecting CO2 into
geological formations to achieve greater oil recovery.
The best-known CO2 – EOR project is located in
southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada, at the Weyburn
Field. This project uses waste CO2 piped from a
gasification plant in North Dakota. It is the only CO2 –
EOR project to date that is being monitored specifically
to understand CO2 storage. At Weyburn, the CO2
storage-to-oil production ratio is about one-to-one, on
a per ton basis.72 Over the 25-year lifespan of the
project, it is expected that about 18 million tons of CO2
injected into the ground will yield approximately 130
million barrels of oil.73

CCS supporters advocate the potential value of this
form of geological storage as it provides supplementary
revenue streams (through the sale of the recovered oil),
lowering the overall cost of the CCS. While this may be
true for some small projects deployed in the early
phases of CCS development, “EOR sites are ultimately
too few and too geographically isolated to
accommodate much of the CO2 from widespread
industrial CO2 capture operations.”74 Furthermore, as
“Oil fails to pay for CCS” (page 28) shows, EOR is not
always able to offset CCS costs.

• Deep coal seams are coal deposits that cannot be
mined due to technological or economic constraints.
CO2 is stored in these sites via a gas adsorption
mechanism that leads to the release of methane. This
Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (ECBM) could potentially
be recovered and used to offset the costs of CCS.
Substantial technical concerns related to the injection of
CO2 and subsequent storage processes limit the
immediate attractiveness of these sites.75 Technical
storage capacity is uncertain and could be as little as 3
GtCO2 or as high as 200 GtCO2.76

When CO2 is pumped deep underground, it is initially more buoyant than water and will rise up
through the porous rocks until it reaches the top of the formation where it can become trapped
by an impermeable layer of cap rock, such as shale.

As CO2 migrates through a formation, some of it is retained in pore space by capillary forces.
This can immobilise significant amounts of CO2.

When CO2 dissolves into rock formation water, CO2 no longer exists as a separate phase and the
buoyant force that drives it upwards is eliminated. Dissolution is rapid when formation water and
CO2 share the same pore space.

CO2, when dissolved in water, is weakly acidic and can react with minerals in the rock formation.
This may result in the conversion of CO2 to stable carbonate minerals, the most permanent form
of geological storage.

Lifting the
smokescreen

CCS is not the catch-all climate solution its proponents’ claim, and
in any case it is years away from being market-ready. At present
“there are still many unanswered questions regarding the safe,
socially compatible as well as ecological and economic sound
applications of CCS.”77 Energy companies and power utilities tend
to gloss over these while proposing to build “capture-ready” plants
that will exacerbate the climate crisis.

Below are five reasons why CCS should not be accepted
as either justification for building new coal-fired power
plants or for continuing our dependence on coal in the
longer term.

4.1
CCS cannot deliver in time
to save the climate

Every decision made about new power plants today will
influence the energy mix of the next 30-40 years. The
urgency of the climate crisis means solutions must be
ready for large-scale deployment in the short-term. CCS
simply cannot deliver in time.

While some system components of CCS are already in
commercial use – mostly in the oil and gas industry-
“there is no operational experience with carbon capture
from coal plants and certainly not with an integrated
sequestration operation”.78 While plans for demonstration
facilities are underway, it is believed that the earliest CCS
might become feasible is 2030.79

The UNDP concludes that CCS “will arrive on the
battlefield far too late to help the world avoid dangerous
climate change.”80

“Capture ready” power stations

Proponents of CCS circumvent the fact that the
technology is not ready, by proposing to build “capture
ready” power stations. This term refers not to a particular
type of technology but more a state of being for a power
station. While there is no strict definition of “capture
ready”, the IEA describes a capture ready plant as “[one]
which can be retrofitted with CO2 capture when the
necessary regulatory or economic drivers are in place.”81
This is sufficiently broad to make any station theoretically
capture ready, and the term meaningless.

The concept of “capture ready” power stations allows
new coal-fired power stations to be built today while
providing no guarantee that emissions will be mitigated in
the future. In lieu of delivering a concrete solution to
fighting climate change, it banks on the promise of an
unproven technology and risks locking us into an energy
future that fails to protect the climate.

In the UK, for example, a proposed new coal-fired power
plant at Kingsnorth, Kent is being sold as “capture ready.”
Yet this doesn’t mean that the new plant will be able to
capture and store carbon; it will just be ready to
incorporate CCS should the technology ever become
viable in the future; and no-one has any idea if and when
this might be. In the meantime, and possibly for its entire
lifetime, Kingsnorth (if built) will pump out around 8 million

17

CCS wastes energy and resources.
Power plants with carbon capture will
use 10-40% more energy than those
without. A 20% increase in the energy
requirement due to carbon capture
would require the construction of an
additional power plant for every four
built to offset the energy loss.

tonnes of CO2 per year, an amount equivalent to the total
annual CO2 emissions of Ghana.82

Recent project cancellations highlight some of the
technical and economic concerns tied to CCS. In 2007,
at least 11 CCS projects were scrapped; plans for new
projects stagnated; and the pace of development for
existing projects slowed considerably.83 Most recently,
the US DOE pulled out of its flagship CCS project,
FutureGen, citing cost concerns (see “US abandons CCS
flagship programme”, page 34). Delays and cost over-
runs have also led to project cancellations in the UK,
Canada, and Norway.

The vote of no confidence that CCS received in a survey
of 1000 “climate decision-makers and influencers” from
around the world is also significant. The survey,
conducted by GlobeScan, the World Conservation Union,
IUCN and the World Bank, reveals substantial doubt
about CCS. Only 34% of those polled were confident that
retrofitting clean coal technology could reduce CO2
emissions over the next 25 years without unacceptable
side effects, and only 36% in the ability of ‘clean coal
technology’ to deliver low carbon energy with new power
stations. In contrast, 74% expressed confidence in the
ability of solar hot water to deliver, 62% for offshore wind
farms, 60% for onshore wind farms, and 51% for
combined heat and power plants.84

“Capture ready” or not, a coal-fired power station built
today aggravates the climate crisis. Maintaining the status
quo in the hope that CCS might some day be able to
deliver is not a climate mitigation strategy.

Emission reduction potential

Even if CCS were ready, the IPCC notes that deployment
would only take place if the appropriate subsidy
mechanisms and policy drivers (including a price on
carbon) were put in place. As a result, it estimates that the
bulk of the technology’s adoption would not happen until
the second half of this century.85

Assuming that commercial viability is reached, scenario
studies indicate that by 2050 only 20-40% of global fossil
fuel CO2 emissions could be technically suitable for
capture86. This includes 30-60% of emissions from the
power sector.87 Therefore up to 70% of emissions from
electricity generation in 2050 may not even be technically
suited to CCS. Furthermore, this figure does not account
for the fact that power stations will often be far away from
storage sites.

In Australia, CCS would lead, at best, to a 9% emissions
reduction in 2030 and a cumulative emissions reduction
from 2005 to 2030 of only 2.4%.88 This is partly due to the
lack of suitable storage locations. For example, in the
Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong area of New South Wales
and at Port Augusta in South Australia, which together
produce about 39% of Australia’s current net CO2
emissions from electricity generation, there are no
identified storage sites within 500 km of the coal-fired
power stations.89 In comparison, a modest improvement
in energy efficiency could – at zero or even negative cost
– decrease emissions in 2030 by about the same amount,
and cumulative emissions by twice as much.90

Climate scientists warn global emissions must peak by
2015, just seven years away. CCS is unable to deliver the
necessary greenhouse gas emission reductions to meet
this goal.

4.2
CCS wastes energy

Relying on CCS to mitigate CO2 emissions means
accepting a 10-40% energy penalty at the power station,
depending on the type of technology used.91 An energy
penalty of just 20% would require the construction of an
additional power station for every four of the same size
built with CCS, to maintain the same net output before
the CCS was fitted.92

These reductions in efficiency will require more coal to be
mined, transported and burned to produce the same
amount of energy as power stations without CCS. A new
500 MWe sub-critical pulverised coal (PC) unit with
carbon capture will have to burn an additional 76,000 kg
of coal per hour to maintain the same net output as a
similar sized plant without capture. An ultra-critical PC unit
would require a boost in its coal feed rate of 44,000 kg/h
(see Table 2).93 CCS would not only worsen fuel security
issues but intensify the major localised environmental
problems associated with extraction and transport of coal,
including habitat destruction, damage to rivers and
waterways and air pollution.

Power station efficiency losses would be most pronounced
when capture systems are retrofitted to existing
infrastructure. This is because technical mismatches
between power stations and capture systems means
components function below their design capacity levels.
These mismatches are most pronounced with pulverised
sub-critical coal units. A study by Alstom Power, Inc
estimates that the addition of MEA flue gas scrubbing to a
500 MWe pulverised coal unit would reduce efficiency by
14.5% points (from 35% efficiency to 20.5%) and cost as
much as US$1600/kWe.94 The substantial loss in efficiency,
coupled with the high cost of retrofitting these types of
plants, means a large proportion of existing coal power
stations are unlikely ever to be retrofitted for capture.

The decision on whether or not to retrofit also hinges on a
power station’s proximity to a storage site; the necessary
infrastructure to deliver the CO2 to it; and the availability of
additional resources, such as water. The numerous coal-
fired power stations scheduled to be built between now
and whenever CCS may be ready for commercial
deployment will most likely never have their carbon
captured and will continue to pollute unabated until they
are closed down.

CCS not only cuts energy efficiency but also increases
resource consumption. A study by Rubin et al. (2005),
quantified the impacts of capture systems on plant
resource consumption and emission rates. For a 500MWe
PC unit fitted with carbon capture, a 24% energy penalty
was estimated to have resulted in an increase of
approximately 25% for fuel, limestone (for the flue gas
desulphurisation system) and ammonia (for nitrogen oxide
control) inputs (see Table 3).95 A US DOE analysis on the
freshwater requirements for carbon capture found that in
2030, deploying CCS in PC plants with scrubbers and
IGCC plants would increase water consumption in all
scenarios examined by 90% (anywhere from 2.2 to 4.3
billion gallons of water per day).96 In a report for the
German Department for the Environment, the Fraunhofer
Institute estimates that wide-scale adoption of CCS could
erase the efficiency gains of the last 50 years and increase
resource consumption by one third.97

Greater energy efficiency is half of the solution to tackling
the climate crisis. Employing a technology that reduces
the energy efficiency of coal-fired power plants will not
bring about the sustainable energy future needed to
protect the climate.

19

The IEA estimates that the magnitude of
CO2 emissions that need to be captured
and stored by 2050 is on the order of 6000
projects, each injecting a million tonnes
of CO2 a year into the ground. Currently,
only three such storage projects exist
worldwide.98

The vast majority of these estimates quantify technical
capacity assuming that the whole of a reservoir is
accessible to store CO2 in its pore volume.105 This can
easily lead to unrealistically high numbers as the fraction
of pore volume that can be used for CO2 storage is site-
specific and depends on factors such as injection rate,
relative permeability, density and mobility of fluids and
rock heterogeneity.106 A geological reservoir with
enormous capacity but no injectivity would for example,
be included in a technical capacity estimate, even though
it could never be used.107

The technical, regulatory and economic limitations that will
always prevent full usage of storage capacity quickly
reduce capacity estimates. For example, deep saline
formations appear to have the greatest storage potential
(see Table 4) but several capacity estimates factoring in
both technological and economic constraints put the
actual feasible storage capacity at 200-500 GtCO2.108
Adding in the limits of co-location of CO2 sources and
storage sites (also known as source-to-sink matching)
could easily decrease these numbers further and is a
determinant factor.

Costs increase the further CO2 needs to be transported.
Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industry
Research Organisation (CSIRO) finds “transport of carbon
dioxide over distances of more than a hundred kilometres
can become prohibitively expensive... Unless the cost can
be significantly reduced, it will not be feasible to pipe
carbon dioxide long distances”.109 High quality storage
sites are of no use if the source of CO2 is too far away
from them. Current estimates clearly fail to portray the
realistic storage capacity available for CO2 sequestration.

4.3
CCS storage – where will all the CO2
go, will it stay there permanently?

Most scenarios for stabilisation of atmospheric CO2 levels
between 450 and 750 parts per million (ppm) place the
economic potential of CCS anywhere from 220-2200
gigatonnes (Gt)CO2 cumulatively.99 It is likely that a vast
majority of captured CO2 would be disposed of in
geological sites. The challenge of storing many
gigatonnes worth of carbon dioxide underground is
ensuring it stays there. To have any potential climate
benefit, buried CO2 must remain underground forever.
However, safe, permanent storage cannot be assured;
the world has no experience with the deliberate long-term
storage of anything, let alone CO2. The longest running
storage project, Sleipner in Norway, is only 12 years old.
While some geological reservoirs could have the specific
combination of physical features and chemical processes
that trap injected CO2 and essentially hold it for all time,
there is insufficient data or practical experience to know
whether there are enough.

Storage estimates

Efforts to capture carbon dioxide make no sense if there
is not adequate space to dispose of it permanently. Global
anthropogenic CO2 emissions are close to 26 Gt100
annually and growing at a rate of about 0.5 % per
annum.101 From a purely technical perspective, estimates
excluding economics and transport factors indicate that
there is enough capacity to store CO2 emissions for
several decades, up to several hundreds of years.102 Deep
saline aquifers are believed to have the greatest potential,
followed by depleted oil and gas fields, and coal seams.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) The
Future of Coal report, however, notes that there is a great
degree of uncertainty associated with storage estimates.
While most “support the contention that sufficient capacity
exists to store many 100’s to many 1000’s of Gigatonnes of
CO2… this uncertain range is too large to inform sensible
policy.”103 This stems from the use of inappropriate
methodology, lack of reliable data and the diverse nature of
geological settings. There is very little of the information
needed to assess the majority of the potential storage
reservoirs available; national level estimates are largely
based on modelled average values and therefore remain a
source of considerable uncertainty.104

21

Overview of geological storage options

1. Deep coal seams
In these formations, CO2 is stored via a mechanism that leads to the release of methane.
Substantial technical concerns related to the injection of CO2 and subsequent storage processes
limit the immediate attractiveness of these sites.

2. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs
These reservoirs tend to be the best characterised of all available storage options.
However, the multiple bore holes and wells drilled to find and extract oil and gas
can increase the leakage risk for storage operations.

3. Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
EOR involves injecting CO2 into geological
formations to achieve greater oil recovery.
EOR sites are ultimately too few and too
geographically isolated to accommodate much
of the CO2 from widespread capture operations.

4. Deep saline formations
(a) onshore (b) offshore
Deep saline aquifers are porous
rock, which contain very saline
water. The major obstacles to full
exploitation of this storage option
are accurate characterisation
and demonstration that safety
and environmental protection
can be assured.

Scaling up

Achieving the substantial CO2 emissions reductions
required to avoid catastrophic climate change would
require broad deployment of CCS in a relatively short
period of time. Global emissions from coal are currently
2.5 Gt of carbon per year. Sequestering just 1 Gt of
carbon (3.6 Gt of CO2) would require the injection of
approximately 50 million barrels of supercritical CO2 per
day from about six hundred 1000 MWe coal plants.110 The
IEA estimates that the magnitude of CO2 emissions that
need to be captured and stored by 2050 is in the order of
6000 projects each injecting a million tonnes of CO2 a
year into the ground.111 The vast infrastructure required to
capture and transport CO2 from diverse and widely
distributed point sources would also need to be built.

In the US alone, reducing CO2 emissions from the
electricity sector could require 200 projects, each with
injection rates ten times bigger than Sleipner.112 The US
DOE estimates the country has enough technical capacity
to store CO2 for tens to hundreds of years.113 However, a
recent Congressional Research Services report shows
that on the ground realities complicate the picture
substantially. The report examines several scenarios for
pipeline development in a seven-state region. The model
scenario considered CO2 emissions from the 11 largest
CO2 sources, all coal-fired power stations.114

In the report, the first storage option considered is Rose
Run sandstone, a deep saline formation, very close to the
CO2 sources. Though its proximity is ideal, the site has
many problems including limited storage capacity, low
permeability and questionable integrity (i.e. high risk of
leakage).115 The second storage option examined includes
a combination of coal beds and depleted oil and gas
fields in the area. Further away than Rose Run, these sites
would have limited utility. The coal beds lack sufficient
storage capacity and the practicality of storing CO2 in coal
seams is virtually untested. The oil and gas fields also lack
sufficient capacity, and leakage is a concern mostly due
to the numerous boreholes drilled to extract fossil fuels
from them in the first place.116 The third storage option is
the Mt. Simon formation, appealing because it is both
larger and less fractured than the Rose Run location.
Distance, however, is a limiting factor; Mt. Simon would
require the construction of pipelines with an average
length of 374km.117

When scaling up CCS from demonstration phases, such
scenarios are likely to be repeated many times over.

23

Sequestering just 1 Gt of carbon
would require the injection of
approximately 50 million barrels of
supercritical CO2 per day from about
six hundred 1000 MWe coal plants.118

For example, a CCS experiment in Texas (see “Storing
carbon underground can have unintended
consequences”, page 26) found CO2 injected into saline
sedimentary aquifers caused carbonates and other
minerals to dissolve rapidly. This could allow CO2 and
brine to leak into the water table.123

While it is not currently possible to quantify the exact risk
of leakage, any CO2 release has the potential to impact
the surrounding environment; air, groundwater or soil.
Most computer models suggest leakage will occur fastest
in the first 50-100 years of a project’s lifetime, before
trapping mechanisms take effect. Others indicate that little
happens in the first 1000-year period with leakage most
likely to occur over the following 3000 to 5000 year
period.124 Either way, even a tiny rate of leakage could
undermine any putative climate benefit of CCS. A leakage
rate of just 1% on 600 Gt of stored carbon (2160 GtCO2
or about 100 years’ worth of CO2 emissions from fossil
fuels), could release as much as 6Gt of carbon (21.6
GtCO2) per year back into the atmosphere. This is roughly
equivalent to current total global CO2 emissions from fossil
fuels.125 Remediation may be possible for CO2 leaks but
there is no track record or cost estimates for these sorts
of measures.126

The absence of a reliable risk management method is of
concern, as leakage risks remain after the closure of an
injection site. Monitoring would be required for long
periods after closure, possibly forever. Therefore,
appropriate tools to detect and protect against leaks will
be essential.

CO2 leakage

Storing CO2 underground is predicated on the ability of
physical and chemical trapping mechanisms to immobilise
CO2 permanently, and store it forever. Trapping
mechanisms work in different ways and at different rates,
from low-permeable cap rocks serving as physical
barriers to CO2 movement, to dissolving CO2 into water.119
The former mechanism is immediately effective, while the
latter can take thousands of years to complete. The
efficiency of trapping mechanisms depends on the
“migration rate of the CO2, which itself is highly dependent
on the rock and fluid properties and geological
characteristics of each site”.120 This means that each
storage site would need to undergo detailed
characterisations both to determine suitability, as well as
to assess the likelihood of leakage.

As long as CO2 is present in geological formations, there
is a risk of leakage – it can migrate laterally or upwards to
the surface. In contact with water, CO2 becomes
corrosive and can compromise the integrity of cap rocks,
well casings and cement plugs. Undetected fractures in
cap rocks or those created by injecting CO2 at too high a
pressure can provide another avenue for CO2 to escape.
Improper design and construction of wells can also create
opportunities for leakage.121 The implications for climate
mitigation as well as the other environmental and public
health risks make leakage a serious concern.

Preventing leaks will largely rely upon careful technology
choices, project design, plant operation and reservoir
selection. The IPCC notes that the fraction of CO2
retained in “geological reservoirs is very likely to exceed
99% over 100 years and is likely to exceed 99% over
1000 years”.122 However, these findings are only valid for
well-selected, fully characterised, properly designed and
managed storage locations. At the moment, sufficient
capacity in high quality reservoirs cannot be assured, nor
can their appropriate design and management be
guaranteed. It is likely that some CO2 storage will occur in
lower quality sites, without proper management. In these
cases, the risk of leakage could be even greater.

Case Study

Storing carbon underground
can have unintended consequences

In an interview with Greenpeace, lead
scientist Yousif Kharaka warned that
the results are “a cautionary note: for
detailed and careful studies of
injection sites, and a well thought out
monitoring program to detect early
leaks of CO2 into shallow potable
groundwater or to the atmosphere.”2

The results of the UGCS study show
that we simply do not know enough
about how stored carbon will behave
to be able to assure its safe and
permanent storage.

One of the key challenges for CCS is
the safe and permanent storage of
captured carbon. Even very small
leakage rates could completely
undermine any climate mitigation
efforts.

The world has no experience of the
long-term storage of anything, let
alone CO2.

As the results of a 2006 United
States Geological Survey (USGS) field
experiment1 show, there is every
chance that carbon dioxide will
behave in ways that are totally
unexpected. The USGS scientists
were testing deep geological disposal
of carbon dioxide at a pilot project in
Frio, Texas.

The researchers were surprised when
the buried CO2 dissolved large
amounts of the surrounding minerals
responsible for keeping it contained.

The CO2 reacted with salty water
(brine) in the geological formation
turning it as acidic as vinegar. This
acidified brine then dissolved other
minerals, including metals such as
iron and manganese, organic material
and relatively large amounts of
carbonate materials. Carbonates
naturally seal pores and fractures in
geological sites; the reaction of the
acidic brine with them is extremely
concerning. Carbonate is also found
in the cements used to plug
abandoned oil and gas wells. If these
open, CO2 could leak into the
atmosphere and/or the contaminated
brine could leak into the aquifers that
supply drinking and irrigation water.

US$0.1-0.3/tCO2 injected, respectively.134 The overall cost
of CCS could serve as another barrier to its
deployment.135 EOR has been suggested as a way to
offset the costs but as “Oil fails to pay for CCS” (page 28)
shows, in reality this is questionable.136

CCS diverts resources away from real solutions

In recent years, the share of research and development
budgets in countries pursuing CCS has ballooned, with
CCS often included as part of renewable energy
packages. Meanwhile, funding for real renewable
technologies and efficiency has stagnated or declined.

The US DOE’s fiscal year 2009 budget seeks a 26.4%
increase (US$493.4 million in FY 2008 vs. US$623.6
million in FY 2009) in funding for CCS-related
programmes, at the same time it is scaling back
programmes tied to renewable energy and efficiency
research and cutting budgets by 27.1% (US$211.1 million
in FY 2008 vs. US$146.2 million in FY 2009).137 Australia
has three cooperative Research Centres for fossil fuels,
one particularly committed to CCS. There is not one for
renewable energy technology.138

In Norway, petroleum-based research receives over five
times more funds than renewable energy research. A
recent commitment of more than 20 billion NOK (US$4
billion) for two CCS projects aimed at capturing 2 MtCO2
annually (see ”How CCS has crippled the Norwegian
energy debate”, page 29) further widens the gap.

4.4
CCS is too expensive

Cost estimates for CCS vary considerably depending on
factors such as power station configuration, CCS
technology, fuel costs, size of project and location. One
thing is certain, CCS is expensive. It requires significant
funds to construct the power stations and necessary
infrastructure to transport and store carbon. The IPCC
sets costs between US$15-75 per ton of captured
CO2.127 A recent US DOE report found installing carbon
capture systems to most modern plant technologies
resulted in a near doubling of plant costs.128 Such costs
are estimated to increase the price of electricity anywhere
from 21-91%.129

For transport, pipeline networks will need to be built to
move CO2 to storage sites. The construction of a network
of pipelines for CCS is likely to require a considerable
outlay of capital.130 Costs will vary depending on a
number of factors, including pipeline length, diameter and
specific steel components (corrosion-resistant) as well as
the volume of CO2 to be transported. Pipelines built near
population centres or on difficult terrain (such as marshy
or rocky ground) are more expensive.131 The IPCC
estimates a cost range for pipelines between US$1-8/ton
of CO2 transported (see Table 5).132 A United States
Congressional Research Services report calculated capital
costs for an 11-mile (18 km) pipeline in the midwestern
part of the country at approximately US$6 million. The
same report estimates that a dedicated interstate pipeline
network in North Carolina would cost upwards of US$5
billion due to the limited geological sequestration potential
in that part of the country.133

Case Study

Oil fails to pay for CCS

Even if CCS were available, large
applications are prohibitively
expensive. EOR is often proposed as
a way round this. Its proponents
argue that the profits from the
recovered oil will cover the costs of
carbon capture.

However, not only are EOR sites too
few and far between to accomodate
much carbon from widespread CCS
operations,1 the cancellation of CCS-
EOR projects due to associated costs
and low returns show it is not always
able to offset the extra costs.

The Norwegian government
abandoned a similar project after the
Statoil-Hydro and Shell companies
withdrew. The companies argued that
although CCS would probably be
technically feasible, it would never
make economic sense. Building the
CCS technology would have meant
closing oil production for a year, and
completely modifying the facilities.
Overall, oil production would only
have increased by 2%4 nowhere near
enough to cover the costs of
installing the CCS technology.

EOR is one of the main ways
proposed by industry to make CCS
affordable, yet as the above cases
highlight, projects are often unlikely to
be able to cover the costs. Funding
CCS is an extremely unwise
investment.

In 2005, when production in the
British Miller oil and gas field became
uneconomic, BP sought government
subsidies to initiate an EOR project.
With EOR the life of the oil field could
have been extended by up to 20
years, delaying the costly
decommissioning process and
allowing access to an estimated 57
million barrels of currently
unrecoverable oil.2

The potential profits from the
recovered oil, however, could not
make up the difference between the
cost of carbon using CCS (€38 per
tonne), and the current price of
carbon credits (€21 per tonne, in
the EU).3

BP tried to convince the UK
government to bridge the gap, asking
for a tax break of over 50%, and a
guaranteed subsidised rate of return.
When the UK government decided
that all proposed CCS projects had to
compete for funding and tax relief, BP
cancelled its plans.

Why carbon capture

How CCS has crippled
the Norwegian energy debate

Despite the fact that Norway
generates nearly 100% of its
electricity from renewable
technologies, State funding for
renewable energy research is less
than one-sixth of that received by
the petroleum industry.1

Over the last decade CCS has come
to dominate the energy debate in
Norway, diverting resources and
political attention away from
renewable generation and energy
efficiency measures. Though the
Norwegian Parliament recently
announced an increase in the total
funding for renewable energy
research, CCS is considered part
of this2.

Recently, the Norwegian government
committed to cover all additional
construction and operation costs to
ensure carbon capture and storage
from two natural gas-fired power
plants on the Norwegian west coast,
Kårstø and Mongstad. This has been
estimated to amount to more than
20 billion NOK (US$4 billion) over
their lifetimes.3

The highly controversial Kårstø plant,
which emits around 1 million tonnes
of CO2 per year, began operating in
November 2007. High gas costs and
low electricity returns mean the plant
has hardly been in operation. Full-
scale carbon capture was promised
from 2009 but is now postponed to
2012. Significant technological
constraints will likely push back the
date even further. The capture plant,
the pipeline to a storage location and
the storage process control facility
have yet to be built.4

Given how much better the same
money could have been spent on
other climate and energy
development projects, the head of
the Norwegian Institute for Energy
Research (IFE), called the decision to
rush development of the Kårstø plant
“close to immoral.5”

At the Mongstad refinery, known as
the “European CCS test centre”, two
pilot plants using different capture
processes (amine and carbonate) are
under construction, the aim of
capturing 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per
year from 2011. Yet, until 2014 at the
earliest, they will simply release the
captured CO2 back into the
atmosphere. This is because the
pipelines to the storage sites are not
due to be finished until 2014. In fact
they may well not even be ready by
then, as potential delays in
investment decisions threaten to
postpone their completion.6

In Norway, as in other countries
pursuing CCS, the technology is
failing to deliver on its promises.
Renewable energy and energy
efficiency are safe, cost-effective
solutions to tackling climate change.
Given the urgency of confronting the
climate crisis, halting development of
these technologies in favour of
waiting for CCS really is immoral.

A US DOE report found installing carbon
capture systems to most modern plant
technologies resulted in a near doubling
of plant costs.139 Such costs are
estimated to increase the price of
electricity anywhere from 21-91%.140

On a local scale, CO2 leakage from storage sites poses a
threat to human health. CO2 is denser than air and
therefore tends to pool in low-lying, poorly ventilated
areas posing a hazard if it reaches levels higher than 3%
by volume.143 This risk also applies to pipeline transport of
CO2 through populated areas, raising critical issues with
regard to route selection, overpressure protection, and
leak detection.144

A natural example of the danger of CO2 leakage occurred
in a volcanically active area at Lake Nyos in Cameroon
in 1986. Large quantities of CO2 that had accumulated
on the bottom of the lake were suddenly released, killing
1700 people and thousands of cattle over a range of
25 km.145

CO2 rising to the shallow subsurface can have lethal
effects on plants and subsoil animals and contaminate
groundwater. Soil acidification and suppression of root
zone respiration has been reported in volcanic and
earthquake zones. In Mammoth Mountain, California, the
release of CO2 following several small earthquakes killed
100 acres of trees.146 Migration of CO2 can acidify waters
and mobilise toxic heavy metals. Its injection can build
pressure, displace brines and cause seismic activities.147
Greater environmental damage due to increased fossil fuel
extraction is another risk. The higher power demands of
plants using carbon capture require higher coal and other
fossil fuel use. Thus the major localised environmental
problems associated with extraction and transport of
fossil fuels including habitat destruction, damage to rivers
and waterways (from subsidence due to longwall mining),
and air pollution will also increase.

4.5
CCS and liability: risky business

CCS carries significant environmental, economic, legal,
political, technological and sustainability risks. First is the
danger that new coal plants are approved and built on the
basis of being “capture-ready”, but never have the
technology installed. Secondary risks arise from the large
quantities of CO2 to be injected, the prolonged storage
times required for any real climate benefit, and the fact
that injection wells, and other infrastructure and geological
imperfections, may result in CO2 leakage.

Environmental risks

Environmental risks of geological CO2 storage include:

• Reservoir leakage: the slow, long-term release of CO2
from storage sites, for example through geological
faults;

• Sudden catastrophic leakage: the large-scale release of
CO2 from storage sites, for instance through failures of
active or abandoned injection wells;

• Escape of CO2 and associated substances into shallow

groundwater;

• Displacement of brines and mobilisation of toxic metals
and organics moving upwards leading to contamination
of potable water, overlying sediments, soils or seawater;

• Escape of other hazardous captured flue gases.

The specific environmental risks associated with CO2
leakage can be divided into two catergories: global and
local. On a global scale, continuous leakage of CO2 has
the potential to undermine climate change mitigation
efforts. While some leakage may be acceptable, it is
generally agreed that it can only be tolerated within certain
limits.141 Even leakage rates as low as 1% per year could
be too high. Leakage at this rate would reduce a given
quantity of stored CO2 to 37% of the original amount after
100 years.142

Regulations will have to account for its more corrosive
nature in pipeline transport and long-term storage, in
order to minimise risk.155

Perhaps the most critical questions relate to property
rights and who is liable for the captured CO2, particularly
once the respective CCS project stops operating. The
answer will determine who pays for any damage caused
by CCS. Potential risks include liability for (1) health effects
and damage to ecosystems from surface leakage; (2)
groundwater contamination, including pollution of drinking
water; (3) induced seismicity; and (4) climate effects from
increased greenhouse gas emissions through surface
leakage. To limit the liability of those engaged in CCS
activities, liability caps, federal indemnity programmes and
a complete transfer of liability from the private to public
sector has been proposed.156 These mechanisms
completely shield operators from legal challenges, transfer
ownership to government and/or limit the amount of
money that can be recouped should damage occur.
Some argue that such measures are necessary as
projects will be unable to secure financing or insurance
without them.157

The recently collapsed FutureGen project in the US, for
example, (see “US abandons flagship CCS programme”
page 34) was protected from financial and legal liability in
the event of an unanticipated release of carbon dioxide.158
Lawmakers also agreed to indemnify FutureGen from
lawsuits and pay for insurance policies to cover the plant.159

Liability risks

Large-scale applications of CCS pose significant liability
risks. Current regulations are not designed to adequately
manage these, leaving unanswered significant questions
as to who is liable.148 At a minimum, any CCS regulatory
regime would need to address: capture; transport; site
characterisation and permitting; operating standards,
including monitoring, measurement and verification and
remediation plans; crediting of mitigated CO2; and
measures to deal with long-term storage. In the
formulation of such a framework, industry’s best interests
(limitation of liability and costs) may run counter to public
best interest (safety over unlimited timescales).

Industry views liability as a barrier to wider deployment of
CCS149 and is unwilling to fully invest in CCS unless it is
protected from the risks associated with long-term CO2
storage. The risks are so great that many utilities are
unwilling to make CO2 available for storage unless they
are relieved of ownership upon transfer of the CO2 from
the power station.150 Potential operators are urging that
they only retain legal liability for permanently stored
carbon for 10 years.151

Many factors impact the scope of liability associated with
CCS. Just a few examples include the classification and
purity of captured CO2, definition of property rights and
ownership of injected CO2. Captured CO2 can, for
example, be labelled as a resource, waste product or
even hazardous waste. The latter designations trigger
stricter regulatory regimes for the handling, transport and
disposal of CO2 and increase the price of CCS.152

Another issue is the purity of the CO2 stream. Captured
CO2 often contains various by-products of combustion
processes such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur
dioxide (SO2) as well as trace heavy metals including lead,
mercury and cadmium.153 Allowing injection of mixed
streams underground is appealing as they require less
scrubbing at the plant level, reducing costs. However,
permitting the disposal of non-CO2 components alters the
risk profile of geological storage as well as the regulatory
and legal responses.154 For example, co-storage of CO2
with sulphur dioxide (SO2) increases the risk of leakage
due to its chemical properties. In contact with water, SO2
forms the highly corrosive sulphuric acid that more readily
dissolves materials, such as the cement used to seal
wells. A greater risk of leakage means higher likelihood of
damage and liability. How much SO2, if any, to allow in
captured CO2 streams will need to be determined.

31

Leakage pathways and potential impacts of CO2 escape

A number of leakage pathways could result in the migration of CO2 into the surrounding
environment. They include leakage through or along injection wells, abandoned wells,
undetected faults or those created by injecting CO2 at too high a pressure, corrosion of
cap rocks and cement plugs used to seal injection wells and diffusion into shallower
geologic formations. Potential consequences of leakage are equally broad. Releases of
CO2 back into the atmosphere would undermine any climate benefit of geological
storage; CO2 rising into the subsurface could negatively impact soil ecosystems, harming
both flora and fauna; CO2 contamination of surface waters might negatively impact
aquatic ecosystems; leakage into groundwater aquifers could degrade their quality by
mobilising toxic metals and dissolving other minerals; and human health impacts are a
concern should concentrations of CO2 reach levels higher than 3% by volume.

Case Study

FutureGen – US abandons
CCS flagship programme

FutureGen, the flagship of the Bush
Administration’s CCS programme,
was hailed as a first-of-its-kind near-
zero emission coal plant1. Yet, in
January 2008, following repeated
delays and chronic cost overruns, the
US government pulled the plug on
FutureGen, stating "when a project
doubles in cost, it's the time to sit
down and rework those agreements."2

Announced in 2003, FutureGen was
supposed to be online by 2012 but
never left the development phase.
The public-private partnership behind
the project included the US DOE and
corporate giants American Electric
Power Service Corp., Anglo
American, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and
China's largest coal-based power
company, China Huaneng Group.

Federal government support for
FutureGen was to be supplemented
by a generous package from the
State of Illinois. This included a $17
million grant, a sales tax exemption
on building materials and selected
equipment, and $50 million set aside
for below-market-rate project loans.
The State also passed a law to
protect FutureGen from financial and
legal liability in the event of an
unanticipated release of carbon
dioxide.3 Lawmakers also agreed to
indemnify FutureGen from lawsuits
and pay for insurance policies to
cover the plant.4

In 2007, the DOE reassessed the
project design after costs had risen
by 85% in three years to $1.8 billion.5
The Department, orginally slated to
cover 74% of the costs, asked
industry to assume more of the
financial burden to “prevent further
cost escalation”7. However, the head
of FutureGen estimated that every
month of delay cost the project $10
million; “solely due to inflation”.8

What happens to FutureGen now is
unclear. Industry partners, promised
their costs would be capped at $400
million, will have to finance it
themselves to continue. This seems
highly unlikely given how much the
project relied on public financing and
liability.

FutureGen collapsed despite being
promised an unprecedented level of
support; a total of US$1.3 billion of
public funds, and being shielded from
any legal responsibility. The debacle
should serve as a stark warning to
governments and industry
considering investing in CCS.

Providing the substantial levels of support to get CCS off
the ground raises a serious question about priorities when
current research shows that electricity generated from
coal equipped with CCS will be more expensive than
other less polluting sources, such as gas, wind power and
many types of sustainable biomass. It is also much more
expensive than increasing energy efficiency.168 Even
assuming that, at some stage, carbon capture becomes
technically feasible, capable of long-term storage,
environmentally safe and commercially viable, its impact
would be limited and come at a high cost.

Meanwhile, as Greenpeace’s Futu[r]e Investment report169
shows, investing in a renewable energy future would save
US$180 billion annually and cut CO2 emissions in half
by 2050.

Financial risks

Immense amounts of money have already been spent
supporting fossil-fuel power plants that are the main
contributors to climate change. Implementation of CCS
would require governments not only to continue but
augment this support with additional subsidies and policy
drivers. CCS adoption will only be possible with extremely
heavy incentives. The technology is very expensive, and
there are no guarantees that it will ever work. Economic
analysis of absolute costs for CCS is characterised by a
high level of uncertainty. For power stations, the IPCC
estimates a range of US$14 to $91 per tonne of CO2
avoided for the entire CCS process.160 A more recent
assessment placed the cost of merely capturing the CO2
anywhere from €24-75 per tonne CO2 avoided.161

Carbon emission cap-and-trade schemes have been
promoted by CCS supporters as a way to lower the cost
barriers of technology adoption.162 However, in order for
CCS to be profitable, the price for carbon emissions would
have to be even higher than the additional costs associated
with deploying the technology. Current CO2 market prices
of around €21 per tonne as well as future projections for
the 2008-2012 period of the Emissions Trading Scheme
are insufficient to spur deployment of CCS.163 Prices as
high as €100 per tonne might be needed to support initial
projects.164 However, not even a high price on carbon is
enough to ensure a future for CCS.165

To make projects viable, however, carbon prices would
need to be coupled with additional policy commitments
and financial incentives.166 Additional mechanisms
proposed to supplement carbon prices include direct
investment support, loan guarantees and public-private
partnerships.167 Instead of polluters being asked to pay for
these programmes, deployment of CCS envisages a
scheme where governments, and ultimately taxpayers,
pay polluters to try not to pollute. If costs turn out to be
higher than expected, the conditions for commercial
viability may never be met and the money spent will have
been wasted.

The world already
has the real solutions
to the climate crisis

The promise of CCS diverts attention away from sustainable energy
solutions and risks locking the world into an energy future that fails
to save the climate. Priority should be given to investments in
renewable energy and energy efficiency which have the greatest
potential to provide energy security and reduce emissions.

Greenpeace’s Energy [R]evolution scenario provides a
practical blueprint that shows how renewable energy,
combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global
CO2 emissions by almost 50%, and deliver half the world’s
energy by 2050.170 Decades of technological progress
have seen renewable energy technologies such as wind
turbines, solar photovoltaic panels, biomass power plants
and solar thermal collectors move steadily into the
mainstream. The market for renewable energy is growing
dramatically; in 2007 global annual investment in
renewables exceeded US$100 billion.171 At the same
time, there is enormous potential for reducing our
consumption of energy, even while providing the same
level of “energy services”.

Many nations have recognised the potential of these true
climate solutions and are pressing ahead with ambitious
plans for energy revolutions within their borders. New
Zealand plans to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-
century. Renewable energy and energy efficiency, not
CCS, are leading the way. New Zealand already obtains
70% of its electricity from renewable resources and aims
to increase it to 90% by 2025.172 In Germany, renewable
energy supply has increased 300% in the past 10 years.

New legislation will require all homes built after 1 January
2009 to install renewable energy heating systems.173 In
the US, over 5,200 MW of wind energy were installed in
2007, accounting for 30% of new power installed that
year; an increase of 45% in one year.174 These are just a
few examples of the renewable energy boom.

The urgency of the climate crisis means solutions must be
ready for large-scale deployment in the short term. CCS
simply cannot deliver in time. The technology is highly
speculative, risky and unlikely to be technically feasible in
the next 20 years. Allowing CCS to be used as a
smokescreen for building new coal-fired power stations is
unacceptable and irresponsible. “Capture-ready” coal-
fired power plants pose a significant threat to the climate.
To tackle the climate crisis, the world needs to reduce the
amount of CO2 produced, not bury it underground and
hope that it stays there. Dirty energy sources, such as
coal, must be phased out while investments in sustainable
energy solutions must be increased. Renewable energy
and energy efficiency are safe, cost-effective solutions
that carry none of the risks of CCS and are available now
to cut emissions and save the climate.

remaining 20% is needed for CCS for the fifth power plant.

65 Most recently, the international London Convention (1972)

adopted protocol that expressly forbids the dumping of CO2
streams unless: “(1) disposal is into a sub-seabed geological
formation; (2) they [the streams] consist overwhelmingly of
carbon dioxide; and (3) no waste is added for the purpose of
its disposal. In other words, these rules do not permit CO2
sequestration in the deep oceans themselves.”

72 At the Weyburn Field storage project, it is estimated that for

every barrel of oil produced, approximately 85 standard cubic
meters (scm) of CO2 remains underground. As one scm of CO2
weighs 1.56 kg and one barrel of oil equals 130 kg then 130
kg oil/(85 scm * 1.56 kg/scm)= 0.97 kg of oil per kg of CO2,
essentially a ratio of 1:1 so that 1 ton of CO2 stored
underground yields approximately 1 ton of oil (Heddle, G et al,
2003, pg 33).

(www.londonconvention.org). Does “overwhelmingly” mean
51%, 75% or 99%? This lack of clarity only adds to the
uncertainty surrounding CO2 storage. Greenpeace believes that
the purity of a CO2 injection stream should exceed 99.9% and
any attempt to define “overwhelmingly” should reflect that.

question in regulations governing the disposal of CO2 sub-

the injection stream should be overwhelmingly CO2. However,
this fails to give guidance for proper stream characterisation
