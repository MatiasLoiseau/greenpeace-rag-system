EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The global trade in illegal and destructively

logged timber is now out of control.

Unlawful access to forest resources,

environmental damage and forest destruction,
human rights abuses and social dislocation of forest-
dwelling peoples in some of the poorest areas of the
world, are being fuelled by those who buy timber
and timber products from these illegal sources.

One major player in this field is Rimbunan Hijau.

Rimbunan Hijau is a global conglomerate of
companies controlled by the Tiong family from
Sarawak in Malaysia. Initially built as a timber
empire, the company now has extensive interests in
logging, timber processing, publishing, property
investment, new technology and travel.

Rimbunan Hijau dominates the logging industry

in Papua New Guinea and is a powerful industry
player in Malaysia and Equatorial Guinea. It also has
significant forestry interests in Gabon, Indonesia,
Vanuatu, New Zealand, and Russia.1

In these countries, the operations of Rimbunan
Hijau are often characterised by a disregard for the
law with documented illegalities in many aspects of
their operations.

Illegal access to forest resources, environmental

damage and human rights abuses are repeated
complaints. But the company seems impervious to
criticism and appears to be protected by an
extensive and well-established network of political
patronage and media control.

Timber produced by Rimbunan Hijau is traded

across the globe with little concern for the
environmental damage, misery and suffering
caused in producer countries.

Rimbunan Hijau’s illegal timber and timber
products are being traded across-the-counter in
Asia, America, Europe, Japan, Australia and New
Zealand.

THE GLOBAL FOREST CRISIS

Ancient forests are fundamental to life on Earth.

They provide a home and vital sustenance to
millions of people. They provide a habitat for
innumerable species of plants and animals. And
they perform vital ecological functions.

Ancient forests are the place that millions of

indigenous peoples call home. Some of these
peoples constitute the poorest and most
disadvantaged of all world citizens. They suffer
human rights abuses, great poverty, disease and
other social problems as forest areas are harvested,
with little or no consideration for their plight or

“...landowners were forced
to sign papers with a
barrel of a gun at their
back. In the presence of
police and company
officials, without proper
legal advice, with guns

livelihoods.

Now, just 20

percent of the Earth’s
original forest cover
remains as large intact
areas; with more than
a third of these under
threat. Industrial-scale
logging poses the
single largest menace
to the forests’
survival.2

Across the globe,

trans-national
corporations continue
to operate

destructively, and often outside of the law, as they
harvest the world’s last remaining accessible forest
resources.

Malaysian logging company, Rimbunan Hijau

(RH) is one such corporation.

Logging destruction is fuelled by a complacent
international marketplace. In addition, consuming
nations worldwide, eager to fulfil a relentless
demand for wood and paper, turn a blind eye to

“Some 350 million of the poorest people on Earth are
entirely dependent on forests for their survival”
World Commission on Forests and Sustainable Development 1999.4

the social, environmental and legal problems that
characterise the logging operations of companies
like Rimbunan Hijau.

The actions of forest plunderers amount to far

more than just a huge ecological disaster.

They have severe impacts on local people and on

the national economies of some of the Least
Developed Countries (LDCs) in the world.

KEY POINTS
1. Much of the global trade in timber and timber

products is unlawful.

2. Destructively and illegally extracted timber

exacts a ruinous toll on forest eco-systems and
on the lives of forest-dwelling peoples. It cheats
developing countries of revenue and resources
necessary for survival and national
development.

3. Companies like Rimbunan Hijau operate across

national boundaries and are a key participant in
the illegal harvesting of timber.

4. Such companies operate with impunity and

cultivate a network of political patronage that
breeds off political systems that are under
immense stress in Southern nations.

5. Only measures at both the producer level (where

forests must be protected from illegal and
destructive logging) and at the consumer level
(where illegal timber and timber products must

be identified and banned) will
effectively address the problem.

6. International and bilateral
political processes, such as the
Convention for Biological
Diversity (CBD), are an
opportunity for governments to
fund the protection of ancient
forests and put in place strict
international guidelines and
programmes to achieve the
“significant reduction in
biodiversity loss by 2010”, agreed
to at the Johannesburg Earth
Summit in 2002.

WHO IS RIMBUNAN HIJAU?

Rimbunan Hijau is a conglomeration of many

corporate shareholdings and takeovers.

hundreds of companies spread across three
continents all owned and controlled by the Tiong
family but which sometimes have no other official
connection.

Rimbunan Hijau has business interests in Australia,

British Guyana, China, Equatorial Guinea, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Gabon, Malaysia, Aotearoa (New
Zealand), Papua New Guinea, Russia, Singapore,
Vanuatu and an estimated annual turnover in excess
of US$1 billion according to the Malaysia-China
Business Council. 5

The Tiong family has built Rimbunan Hijau into an

immense corporate empire that started out as a
logging company but which now extends to include
interests in timber processing, agriculture (cocoa and
oil palm), aquaculture, insurance, banking,
publishing6, optical fibres, information technology,
shipping, retailing, travel, real estate and property
development, mineral and mining development and
print media.

The business dealings and corporate structure of

Rimbunan Hijau as a company are not open or
transparent, particularly as regards its many

In Papua New Guinea for example, Greenpeace
research has identified over 60 separate companies
as being owned or politically controlled by the Tiong
family — but only a small minority are openly
acknowledged as being a part of the Rimbunan
Hijau group. The ownership and control of the rest is
obscured by undisclosed buyouts, proxy directors and
shareholders, outdated company records, foreign
ownership and widespread use of tax havens.7

MALAYSIAN MULTINATIONAL
LOGGING COMPANIES

Multinational Malaysian logging companies got

their start in Malaysia’s rainforests.

Malaysian logging companies are often registered
as family-owned private limited companies, allowing
them to operate secretly as they are not publicly
listed corporations.

Many of these companies have political

connections that helped them secure large areas of
forest.

Within a couple of decades they left large areas of

Malaysia deforested.
Less than 15 percent of
Malaysia’s forests today
remain intact8.

After years of
destructive logging
practices, the Malaysian
government began to
enact stricter regulations
to attempt to save what
little rainforest was left
in the country. This
caused the Malaysian
companies to look
elsewhere for lumber —
a path which led them
to Indonesia, Papua New
Guinea and other parts
of the world.

"Established in 1975, Rimbunan Hijau Group has a
diversified portfolio of businesses with estimated annual
turnover exceeding USD 1 billion, with
most items exported. Currently comprising 10,000
employees in Malaysia, the Group continues to expand,
including diversifying overseas. Over the
years, Rimbunan Hijau Group has built up extensive
experience in logging, sawmilling, export of logs and
sawntimber and downstream processing activities,
ranging from plywood to medium density fibreboard
and particleboard. Rimbunan Hijau Group is also a
pioneer in supporting Sarawak's emphasis on
downstream activities. In 1985, it established the state's

first large scale plywood mill under Rimbunan Hijau
Plywood Sdn. Bhd. The Group is also the major
shareholder of Jaya Tiasa Holdings Bhd and Subur Tiasa

Lumpur Stock Exchange with market capitalisation of
about more than RM 2 billion and the largest plywood,
veneer and particleboard producer in

POLITICAL PATRONAGE

Rimbunan Hijau enjoys wide political patronage.

In Malaysia the Tiongs have been highly astute in
forming strategic alliances with the Malay political
elite and are personally involved in the SUPP – the
main Chinese Party in Sarawak.

In the early nineties, the brother of Sarawak’s

Chief Minister (who controled the allocation of
logging concessions) was a director of a Rimbunan
Hijau company and a sister of the Chief Minister
was a Tiong business partner.

Tiong Hiew King has himself been a State

Senator, a position that was also occupied by one of
his sons, and Tiong family companies have shared
control of their subsidiaries with Provincial Ministers
and party officials.10

In Sarawak these ties have resulted in a blurring
of the distinction between government and logging

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

interests and has led “to changes in legislation that
favour corporate activities and which result in the
disregard and repression of many actors within civil
society.”11

In Papua New Guinea Rimbunan Hijau is also

closely connected to the political elite.

For example, one recent Deputy Prime Minister
was criticised in an Ombudsman investigation for
unlawfully pressuring the National Forest Board to
favour Rimbunan Hijau with an illegal timber
permit extension. 12

The Minister for Justice is Chair of a company
that holds a timber permit that it sub-contracts to
Rimbunan Hijau. A National Intelligence
Organisation report alleges a provincial Governor
and two Members of Parliament were on Rimbunan
Hijau’s payroll.13

Hijau, in Port Moresby, Papua New
Guinea © Solness/Greenpeace

Rimbunan Hijau is just one of a number of
Malaysian companies that have global timber
interests. Many of these companies have been
criticised for poor environmental, social and human
rights records.14

If Malaysia is to be seen as a good global citizen
this attitude must change. Malaysia will attempt to
portray a commitment to the environment when
hosting the Seventh Conference of the Parties
(COP7) of the United Nations Convention on
Biological Diversity in Kuala Lumpur in February
2004.

Globally, there are growing calls for

governments to hold transnational corporations
accountable for their actions in foreign countries.
This is especially important for companies operating
in smaller or less developed countries where the
rule of law and governance frameworks may be
weak.

The final text of the Johannesburg Earth Summit

– the World Summit on Sustainable Development –
made a positive statement on corporate
accountability. WSSD called for: “Active promotion
of corporate responsibility and accountability
including through the full development and
effective implementation of intergovernmental
agreements and measures.”

Malaysia is a signatory to the WSSD plan of

implementation and must start to make its rhetoric
match its actions.

In order to make real its commitment to WSSD,

the Malaysian government must consider:

• Pursuit of amendments to its Corporations Law

to increase corporate accountability;

• Passage of legislation to impose standards on
Malaysian companies operating overseas;

• Actively supporting international mechanisms

that increase the accountability of its
transnational corporations.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Papua New Guinea is a South Pacific nation of
some five million people, most of who still depend
on the environment for their daily subsistence.

The logging industry has already acquired 70
percent of available forest resources and Rimbunan
Hijau is at the forefront of attempts to gain access
to what remains.

RIMBUNAN HIJAU IN PNG

Rimbunan Hijau is the dominant player in the

forest industry in Papua New Guinea and it has
significant investments in other sectors of the
economy.

Rimbunan Hijau maintains a veil of secrecy over

the true extent of its logging and other business
interests but it has interests in more than 60
interlinked companies that are registered in Papua
New Guinea.

These companies control more than 50 percent

of Papua New Guinea’s large-scale commercial
logging operations and at least 55 percent of log
exports.

Greenpeace estimates that Rimbunan Hijau
controls timber rights in more than three million
hectares of forest and in 2002 alone, exported logs
worth more than US$50 million from Papua New
Guinea. 15

Rimbunan Hijau also operates Papua New

its largest sawmill.

In Papua New Guinea
Rimbunan Hijau controls
companies involved in
commercial printing, travel,
wholesale and retail sales,
shipping, property
development and owns a
daily newspaper, The
National.

Rimbunan Hijau has close

connections to Papua New
Guinea’s political elite. The
Prime Minister has been
directly involved in the
logging industry16 and his
Deputy has been criticised in
an Ombudsman Commission
report for ‘arbitrary and
irresponsible’ interference in
directing the unlawful
allocation of the Kamula Dosa
logging concession to
Rimbunan Hijau.17

The Secretary of the
Department of Environment

and Conservation was also criticised by the
Ombudsman Commission for his role in the same
affair.

The Minister for Justice is the Chair of a

company18 that holds the permit for the East Kikori
logging concession. His company employs
Rimbunan Hijau as its logging contractor.

Privatisation and the Chief Secretary are other

RIMBUNAN HIJAU AND ILLEGAL LOGGING
Most large-scale logging operations in Papua

New Guinea, including those operated by
Rimbunan Hijau, are unlawful as they are in
fundamental breach of a number of basic legal
requirements.

Most logging operations do not have the
informed consent of the local resource owners
(most of whom have never even been correctly
identified)20, they have not been initiated and
allocated according to the requirements of the
Forestry Act, they are being operated in almost
complete defiance of environmental laws and
regulations and they are not sustainable, which is a
specific requirement of both the PNG Constitution
and the Forestry Act.21

An independent review was recently ordered by

the government into a number of new logging
permits and extensions.22 Three of the reviews
involved logging projects operated by Rimbunan
Hijau; Wawoi Guavi, Vailala Blocks 2 and 3 and
Passismanua.

The review found that the extensions to all three

projects were unlawful as they breached legal
requirements and had not followed due process.
The review reached the ‘unavoidable conclusion
that there have been serious departures and
breaches from due process and there are serious
anomalies in the timber permits and agreements’.23

As well as declaring the project extensions
unlawful, the review also found that the original
timber permits for Vailala Blocks 2 and 3 and
Wawoi Guavi were also unlawful and that the
timber rights had never been properly acquired
from the landowners.24

Rimbunan Hijau managed to keep its

involvement in the unlawful extension of the
Passismanua timber permit out of the PNG media by
threatening a defamation action against the Post
Courier newspaper.25 Rimbunan Hijau’s denial of
involvement to the media was contradicted in the
subsequent review, which confirmed that RH was
the logging company for Passismanua.26

KAMULA DOSA

Kamula Dosa is Papua New Guinea’s largest
unallocated logging concession in the western part
of the country. It covers over 800,000 hectares and
contains an estimated 11.2 million cubic metres of
commercial timber.

The concession is the biggest prize currently
available to the logging industry in PNG and it is
coveted by a number of logging companies
including Rimbunan Hijau.

Forestry laws require that the timber rights be

publicly advertised in a
competitive bidding
process to ensure the
best possible deal for
the local resource
owners. But Rimbunan
Hijau has made a
number of attempts to
avoid this process and
to unlawfully acquire
the logging rights.

In 1997 Rimbunan
Hijau was granted an
unlawful geographical
extension to its Wawoi
Guavi timber permit
that covered the whole
of the Kamula Dosa
concession area. The
extension was
subsequently
investigated and
overturned by the
Ombudsman
Commission.27

The Ombudsman
criticised a number of
politicians for
influencing the decision
of the National Forest
Board and Board
members for flouting
the law and putting the
interests of RH above
those of the resource
owners and the State.28

The Ombudsman
recommended action
against a number of
Board Members and
Rimbunan Hijau, but
those recommendations
have not been
enforced.

In 2002, Rimbunan

ROBBER BARONS
The latest official inquiry into
the forestry sector in Papua New
Guinea found that all six new
permits and permit extensions
reviewed were unlawful. This is
how the Review of Disputed
Forest Allocations, 2003,
described the logging companies
operating in PNG:

‘the overwhelming conclusion
is that the robber barons are now
as active as they ever were. They
are not only free to roam, but are
in fact encouraged to do so by
persons whose proper role is to
exercise control over them...Only
a Commission of Inquiry could
hope to unearth the entire
picture and unravel the web of
deceit’.29

The Review looked specifically
at two of Rimbunan Hijau’s
largest logging operations,
Wawoi Guavi and Vailala. In
respect of these two concessions
the Review stated:

‘The time has come for a full
investigation into the affairs of
these companies (both RH
subsidiaries). They should be
compelled to produce documents
and account for their actions’.30

Despite these findings the
Prime Minister has said:

“I must congratulate

Rimbunan Hijau for investing
heavily in the forestry
sector...(this) is in line with
government policies...The
company and other genuine
forestry companies must be
supported.”31

Hijau again tried to
unlawfully secure the
logging rights for
Kamula Dosa. A Cabinet submission sponsored by
the then Deputy Prime Minister and a number of his
Ministerial colleagues proposed that Rimbunan
Hijau should be given unique tax concessions and
unlimited access to Kamula Dosa without having to
follow the legal allocation process or proper
procedures.

The submission was withdrawn after it was

publicly exposed.

THE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF LOGGING

A number of reports32 have documented the negative social impacts of the logging industry in Papua

New Guinea. These negative impacts include:

Diminished food security – reduced availability of foods from within the forests (meat, insects, herbage,
fungi, fish), loss of gardens and food stands from poor logging practices, loss of water resources and reef
systems.

Loss of clean water supplies – soil erosion, poor roading and waste disposal all pollute water courses.

Poorer health – nutrition problems, water pollution, increased malaria, introduction of sexual diseases,

intoxication, industrial injuries, loss of traditional medicines.

Loss of local economic resources – loss of forest products that are traditionally traded including foods,

resins, timber for construction and canoes, building materials, medicines.

Undermining of social systems – community values undermined, social conflict, alcohol, prostitution, land

disputes, displacement of families from forest areas, marginalisation of women.

Increased gender burdens – women have to work longer and harder to look after their families

Increased conflict – with logging companies, forestry officials and police and between different local

factions or community groups

HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

For many years, local people living within timber
permit areas have complained of the abuse of their
fundamental human rights by timber companies
and by police personnel paid by these companies.

The alleged abuses include the deprivation of
property, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,
denial of personal security, unlawful detention,
invasion of privacy, denial of freedom of movement
and freedom of speech, and a failure to provide
good working conditions and adequate and equal
pay.33

These are all breaches of the United Nations

Universal Declaration on Human Rights.

The complaints and allegations of the local
people are well-documented and include signed
statements and written letters of complaint to the
Royal PNG Constabulary and a personal video
testimony of some of the victims.

SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS INCLUDE:

• People being forced to sign agreements under
duress including at gunpoint and threats of
imprisonment and even death.34

• The use of armed police officers with guns drawn
to emphasise the ability of company personnel to
enforce their threats.35

• Use of police ‘mobile squads’ to quell any

industrial unrest amongst logging company
employees.36

• Use of firearms by logging company managers to

threaten and intimidate local people.37

• Torture, physical abuse and unlawful detention
of local people by police officers ‘employed’ by
the logging company.38

• Rape of female employees by logging company

managers and police.39

“Allegations of human rights abuses
against women working in isolated logging
camps are being documented by unions both
in PNG and internationally.

Many of these camps are so isolated the
only way in or out is by plane. Once in the
camps, many women claim they are forced to
have sex with company officials and the police
who work for them.

Union officials have taken dozens of
statements from women and girls who say
they are routinely threatened with guns that
are fired to scare them into having sex.

Women who become pregnant are faced

THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
OF LOGGING

Environmental studies40 indicate
that logging by Rimbunan Hijau in
Papua New Guinea is among the most
environmentally destructive of any
selective logging operations studied anywhere on
the planet. Losses to the residual stand have been
recorded at more than 100 trees per hectare. What
is supposed to be selective logging is effectively
clear felling.

The logging mainly ignores the prescriptions in
the PNG Logging Code of Practice. Buffer zones are
not respected, logging tracks are bulldozed through
streams, poor road construction wastes logs and
pollutes water courses, oil and other waste
pollution is endemic, standing water attracts
mosquitos and increases the incidence of malaria,
and undersized logs are constantly felled.41

Papua New Guinea’s Constitution and Forestry
Act require that all forest operations are carried out
in a sustainable manner and that resources are
protected for future generations. In reality, these
prescriptions are ignored and the average life of a
logging concession is just 12 years.42 This is less than
one-third of the legally mandated 40-year cutting
cycle and is also ecologically inadequate.

NO MONITORING OR ENFORCEMENT
Despite the very poor environmental

performance of logging companies in PNG, no
action is ever taken against them. The Department
of Environment and Conservation does not even
have a forestry monitoring team and the 2002
Ombudsman Commission found that the
Department head, Wari Iamo has gone out of his
way to support Rimbunan Hijau.43

Wari Iamo has been criticised by the Ombudsman

Commission for neglect of duty for supporting an
illegal logging permit extension for Rimbunan
Hijau. When disciplinary proceedings were initiated
against him by his former Minister for a series of
offences, the Prime Minister himself intervened,
sacking his Minister and re-instating the suspended
Secretary.

WAWOI GUAVI

In an unpublished report44 commissioned by
Greenpeace, scientist Dr David Melick has studied
the environmental impacts of logging by Rimbunan
Hijau in its Wawoi Guavi timber concession in
Western Province.

The research uncovered an extensive catalogue
of breaches of PNG’s Logging Code of Practice. The
report identified 261 separate breaches of 18 key
logging standards.

These breaches were seen to have serious

environmental impacts, including injury to
waterways and watersheds, severe erosion and
serious pollution to soil and waterways from oil and
toxic chemicals.

The study also found frequent damage to
cultural sites from logging operations and the
felling and removal of undersized trees.

Although Greenpeace and Dr Melick were in the

area at the invitation of landowners, Rimbunan
Hijau used the Southern Command Police Task force
to try and
intimidate
them and to
restrict access
into the forest.
RH also placed
locked chains
and logs across
roads to
inhibit
movement in
the area.

“Having examined some of the
logging operations, it is now
difficult to view the responsible
environmental position espoused
on behalf of Rimbunan Hijau with
anything other than cynicism”
(Melick 2003)

Indonesia has 10 percent of the world’s

remaining tropical forests. They are home to some
50 million indigenous people. These forests teem
with unique wildlife and the highest diversity of
trees and vines found anywhere in the world.

Hundreds of unique mammal and bird species

live in the forests of Indonesia, often only on a
single island.

Yet, if the current rates of logging and forest
conversion continue, the lowland dry forests of
Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo will have been
completely destroyed by 2010.45

Indonesia is one of the major sources of illegally

traded tropical timber. According to government

Evidence shows that

this illegal production
and trade is continuing
despite a log export
ban introduced in
Indonesia in November
200148. The primary
destination of illegal
timber exports from
Indonesia is Malaysia
where log imports are
continuing, despite a
ban on log imports
from Indonesia
introduced in June
2002.

In October 2003, the Indonesian Minister of
Forestry called on the European Union to reject

timber products from Malaysia, saying that they
contain a large amount of illegal wood from
Indonesia.49

In Indonesia, much of the logging is unlawful
because it is done without a government permit or
licence. This is possible because of the bribes that
are paid to police, forestry officials and politicians.50
Kidnapping, bribery and attempted murder have all
been documented as the methods used by the
logging companies to protect their illegal trade.51

ILLEGAL LOGGING, RIMBUNAN HIJAU AND
THE MILITARY

“Military involvement in illegal activities is taken

for granted in Indonesia. Hundreds of reports of
military involvement in illegal logging have
emerged and there is recognition of this serious
problem within government. Reports of military
personnel owning illegal sawmills, backing timber
barons and applying pressure for the release of
confiscated logs are common and widespread.”52

The Environment Investigation Agency (EIA)53 in

London and the Indonesian group Telapak have
reported links between the company PT Rimbunan
Hijau Jaya and the Indonesian military. EIA and
Telapak visited communities in West Papua and
obtained documents clearly linking a military officer
to PT Rimbunan Hijau Jaya and illegal logging.

In a brief presented to the Indonesian

Government they described how the illegal logging
is being facilitated by the use of ‘military power’
that is used to threaten local communities.54

Illegal logging by PT Rimbunan Hijau Jaya has
been reported at three sites and is occurring despite
the opposition of the majority of the local people.
Letters of complaint were sent to forestry officials

in 2002 but a promised

investigation has never
eventuated.

The EIA and Telapak have

called on the Indonesian
Government to take decisive
action to prevent the export of
illegally felled logs and to
discipline and prosecute
military officers involved with
logging companies in illegal
activities.

EQUATORIAL GUINEA

Rimbunan Hijau operates in a number of

African countries including Gabon and
Equatorial Guinea, where its subsidiary
Shimmer International and its many
associated companies have been a dominant
player in the logging sector55 under the
“sponsorship of the Minister for Forests”56,
who is also the President’s son57.

In Equatorial Guinea, some 70 percent of
the forest has been allocated for large-scale
industrial logging58 despite the importance of
the forest for the daily subsistence of the
largely rural population.

Although local laws require that 60

percent of log production must be processed
on-shore, most timber is still being exported
as cheap raw logs59. This deprives the country
of resource revenues, economic investment
and employment opportunities.

Enforcement of legal requirements is
virtually non-existent in commercial logging,
according to the World Rainforest Movement
(WRM) and although logging companies are
required by law to provide health, education
and social facilities for local communities,
enforcement is very poor.60

Long Sayan Declaration

Widely documented negative

social consequences of the
logging industry include a severe
impact on food security, pollution
of water supplies, increasing
incidences of ill-health and
disease, the disruption of local
economies and changes in social
stability.63

In 2002, the Penan people documented the
abuses they have suffered at the hands of the
logging industry in the Long Sayan Declaration.64
The Penan are particularly affected as they are a
semi-nomadic forest dwelling people- their forest
has been their home for thousands of years. Their
fight against logging is a fight for their lives.

Over 700 people from 40 communities

formulated the Declaration to clearly spell out their
suffering as a people displaced and abused by the
logging industry.

The Declaration details the food shortages,

frequent illnesses and income loss brought about by
logging operations and calls for immediate
government action as the very survival of the Penan
people is severely threatened by the logging
industry, which continues to reap huge profits from
the sales of timber resources extracted from their
ancestral land with impunity.

Malaysia is one of the world’s major producers
and exporters of tropical timber. It is the home base
for Rimbunan Hijau and a number of other major
transnational logging companies.

The majority of Malaysia’s timber production
comes from Sarawak where about 70 percent of the

abundant resources and providing us with sources of
income and have also shaped our culture, beliefs and
customs. Thus, to destroy the forest has the same
impact of destroying our community.”

land area has been allocated for logging. Here,
Rimbunan Hijau has an estimated 800,000 hectares
of production forest.61

Rimbunan Hijau produces 3-4 million cubic

metres of logs per year, which gives the company a
20-25 percent share of the Malaysian timber
industry.62

SOCIAL IMPACTS OF LOGGING

known to indigenous dyak peoples for seriously
undermining their livelihoods and survival.

and other destructive development activities within
their customary land and against infringement of
their rights. In response they have been harassed,
intimidated, suppressed and arrested by the
government and companies.

Supporting these company interests, police and
forest department officials have arbitrarily arrested
and detained those indigenous people who put up
any form of protest, even though such protests are
undertaken within the confines of their own lands
and they have legitimate rights under the law to
such forms of protest.67

In one such protest in
August 2000, more than
100 Penan people in the
Apoh and Tutoh regions
barricaded a logging
road to prevent access
by three timber
companies including a
subsidiary of Rimbunan
Hijau.68

The action was taken

social havoc in Sarawak for

after numerous verbal
and written appeals but
their problems were
ignored. The people
accuse the logging
companies of hiring
gangsters to threaten them not to pursue their
claims of encroachment, illegal logging and
damage to fruit gardens and burial sites.

Protests and blockades continued through 2002

and 2003.

As is the case in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia

and Africa, Malaysia also suffers severe and
uncontrolled environmental impacts from logging
activities.

Careless and negligent logging practices impact

on local watersheds and cause soil erosion; they
disrupt local climates and cause or exacerbate forest
fires. There is also a toll on bio-diversity within
forests, and the marine environment.

A report by the World Rainforest Movement

(WRM) and Forests Monitor in 1998, listed a number
of Malaysian citizens who had their human rights
abused and freedom of movement restricted as a
result of their opposition to illegal logging. In each
case, the named individuals had been prevented by
government officials from travelling to attend
international meetings and then had their passports
withdrawn.65

There is evidence that Rimbunan Hijau is now
trying to apply similar tactics in Papua New Guinea.
In November 2003, threats were issued to a local
airline to only fly RH approved passengers to an
airstrip inside its Wawoi Guavi logging concession
and to deny travel to any non-government
organisations.66

The top politicians in Sarawak have
long been awarding logging
concessions to themselves, their
families and their supporters.”

The Forest Club of Russia have expressed

concerns about Rimbunan Hijau’s logging
operations:

“Logging in the upstream of river Soukpai by the
RH company will result in destruction of the
existing forest ecosystems of the basin, spreading
of forest fires, soil erosion and disturbance to the
hydrologic balance of local rivers... that now serves
as an important sources of means of subsistence
for most of the local residents.”72

Rimbunan Hijau has been repeatedly fined for
violations of logging regulations and environmental
laws.73

In 2002, Rimbunan Hijau exported 700,000 cubic
meters of timber from Russia with a value of US$58
million (2001).74 Seventy-six percent of this was sold
to China. Most of this trade is believed to be with
small buyers around the border town of Suienghe.
The remaining 24 percent was exported to Pacific
Barter Trade Limited in Hong Kong.

biggest forest area in the world. This represents
about 24 percent of all the forests on our planet.
About two-thirds of these forests are located in the
remote northern regions of Siberia and in the Far
East.

In the more densely populated areas of

European Russia, Southern Siberia and parts of the
Far East, forests have been severely over-logged
during the last 50 years, placing great pressure on
remaining resources.

All Russian forests are State-owned; with no
private ownership. The State is responsible for
protection and management of forests, even in
concession areas. The forest service is the biggest in
the world, employing about 220,000 people.

Environmental activists in the Russian Far East

are becoming increasingly concerned about the
extent of illegal logging in the region.

They say the rich timber resources of the ancient

forests are being plundered despite Russia’s strict
laws on logging. Environmentalists blame
corruption by local officials and lack of funds to
enforce controls on timber shipments.70

Rimbunan Hijau has been operating in Russia
since 1997 when it acquired the rights to harvest
305,000 hectares of State forest in a region that had
been earmarked for environmental protection.71

Since 1997, RH has acquired further large-scale

concession areas in the Ul’chsky/Solnechny and
Vaninsky districts.

NEW ZEALAND/ AOTEAROA

way to go to improve plantation management, especially stream
protection. © Greenpeace

Although the forest industry in New Zealand/
Aotearoa is based on the plantation production of
softwood species, Rimbunan Hijau is a major player.

Rimbunan Hijau’s first forestry investment in
Aotearoa was the purchase of five forest licenses
from the national government in 1990 through the
Tiong controlled company, Ernslaw One.75

This gave the company logging rights in three
regions, Coromandel, Manawatu and Otago. Since
then the company has diversified its interests
through investments in wood processing, timber
importing and wholesale, land and property
development, scientific products, fish farming and
ports.76 In particular, the timber importing
enterprise The Lumberbank, is importing timber
from Rimbunan Hijau’s illegal operations in Papua
New Guinea. This is a major part of the 4,000 m3 of
sawn timber imported into New Zealand from PNG
in 2003.

Since 1990, Ernslaw One has expanded its forest

estate from an initial 22,000 hectares to 53,000
hectares through the purchase of further
plantations and the conversion of farmland.

In stark contrast to the performance and

management of Rimbunan Hijau’s forest operations
in tropical countries (and Russia), in New
Zealand/Aotearoa, it is seeking to be a responsible
forest manager. According to the company’s
website:

“Ernslaw One firmly believes in caring for the
environment, and strives to ensure that it’s forest
and timber processing operations meet the
requirements of sound environmental
management. It’s plantation forests are managed as
a sustainable resource.”77

Ernslaw One has all its plantation operations

certified under the globally recognised green-
labelling Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) scheme.

To become FSC certified, Ernslaw One was

required under FSC rules, to “demonstrate a long-
term commitment to the Forest Stewardship Council

Principles and Criteria”78.

It is barely credible that Ernslaw One could
demonstrate such a commitment when it is part of
the Rimbunan Hijau group of companies that so
demonstrably fails to live up to the most basic social
and environmental standards in almost all of its
logging operations.

However, even in New Zealand/Aotearoa Ernslaw

One’s plantation forest operations still have some
way to go to meet FSC responsible management
standards. The certification of its North Island
operations was subject to 25 conditions that
identify failures to comply with FSC standards and
which require stipulated remediation, most of them
within 12 months.

In particular, there are major concerns on their
clear-fell logging practices in catchments of their
plantations in the Coromandel in the North East of
the North Island that are prone to severe high
rainfall events. In the implementation of the local
law, the Resource Management Act, a number of
local community organisations and neighbours of
the company have been battling to protect local
streams and harbour.

Dairy farmer Paul Bibby, whose farm is a

neighbour of Coromandel’s Whangapoua Forest,
appeared on TVNZ’s “Frontline” investigation of the
company79 in 1994. His concern was that it was
logging too much, too fast and that the bare
hillsides would lead to a major silt problem, as had
happened previously in the days of Forest Service
ownership. Both farms and Whangapoua Harbour
had been badly silted in the past, causing some
farms to be inundated under a metre of silt. The
company has denied that it is engaged in any
environmentally unsound practices on the
Coromandel.

“Ernslaw One had gone through the motions of
consulting the locals but totally refused to
accommodate any of the residents association's Draft
Code of Logging Practice. After rain, the dirty water
now extends right out through the harbour. We've
had absolutely no satisfaction from the company."
Paul Bibby, on behalf of the Whangapoua Environmental Protection Society.

Local people were astounded to discover that
the local District Council had agreed to reduce the
width of the riparian strips (strips either side of a
stream, river or lake that is protected) from 20
metres to five metres without consulting them.
There are also complaints that shellfish beds in the
harbour are being buried by silt. More recently, the
company has created further controversy by buying
up an adjacent dairy farm and proposing to build a
large sawmill and processing plant.

SOLOMON ISLANDS

Rimbunan Hijau interests in the Solomon Islands

are mainly through the Earthmovers Solomon
Islands group, including Pacific Timbers Ltd, and
more recently, a company called Delta. Rimbunan
Hijau’s Solomon Islands subsidiaries have been part
of a handful of Asian corporate groups that have
been logging at more than four times the
sustainable rate80. They have been criticised and

documented as providing little benefit to the
country and for destructive practices, including:
transfer pricing and under reporting of log
receipts81 82, payments to members of parliament to
overturn the government83, what has been
described as “the worst logging seen in any tropical
forest”84 85, social impacts86, and poor worker
conditions87.

There have been other controversies over the

of the scale of elsewhere, have always been
controversial. In the early 1990s subsidiary
companies were involved in logging opposed by
landowners in remnant forest on the island of
Erromango. Their Santo Veneers operation on Santo
Island have been a source of conflict with local
landholders since it started operating. In 1995, locals
burned a Santo Veneers bulldozer in protest at the
company logging in an area for which they had no
contract. The Supreme Court acquitted the local
family concerned “after hearing evidence that Santo
Veneers and Timbers Limited were logging in an
area where they had no contract and continued to
log the area even after the burning of their
bulldozer and a court injunction not to log there”.88

project. For example;

• An official inspection visit on one occasion in
1997 identified trees which had been cut
illegally;

• The company is believed to be entering into

contracts after having identified only a few of
the legitimate landholders, rather than all of
them as required by law;

• There are also believed to be other contractual

irregularities and reports of logging in protected
areas.89

Santo Veneer logging has nearly exhausted the
commercial natural forests on Santo Island, largely
due to the over-estimation of commercial volumes
contained in the forests and required to meet the
veneer processing plant.

MARKETS AND CHAIN OF CUSTODY

The international trade in tropical timber only

Rimbunan Hijau’s major markets for sawn timber

exists because of the demand from the market
place. The trade in illegal timber and the human
and environmental suffering that it causes are the
direct result of a market where the buyers of timber
and timber products do not discriminate between
timbers from different sources.

LOG EXPORTS

The major export markets for raw log exports
from Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Russia are China and Japan.90

For instance, of 1.85 million cubic metres of
declared exports from Papua New Guinea in 2002,
62 percent went to China and Hong Kong and 23
percent to Japan. These figures reflect a trend
where, over the last three years, log exports to
Japan have declined as China has become the
dominant market.

In both countries species like Calophyllum are

used to produce cheap plywood for the
construction sector, with large Japanese trading
houses like Nissho Iwai facilitating the trade.

SAWN TIMBER

Sawn timber is the fastest-growing timber export

from Papua New Guinea. Volumes have risen
dramatically from 23,000 cubic metres in 1999 to
42,348 cubic metres in 200291. This reflects the
commissioning of Rimbunan Hijau’s major sawmill
at Kamusie in Western Province.

from Papua New Guinea are in Australia and New
Zealand/Aotearoa.

In Australia, RH controls a subsidiary named TLB

Timber that operates out of Brisbane.  This
company sells illegal and destructively logged
timber to many small companies and individuals in
Australia.  This timber is then turned into mouldings
and other building components.

According to figures from the Forest Authority in

PNG, in 2002 Australia imported 16,653 cubic
metres of rough sawn timber from Papua New
Guinea.

This timber is tainted with illegality, human
rights abuses, environmental destruction, and
negative social impacts.

VENEER AND PLYWOOD

Other processed commodities experienced sharp

increases in past years, mainly due to the
installation of Rimbunan Hijau’s Panakawa mill in
Western Province.  Exports of veneer rose from
1,700 cubic metres in 1999 to 71,615 cubic metres in
2002 and plywood exports likewise increased from
7,000 cubic metres in 1999 to 70,083 cubic metres in
2002.92

Again Asian market countries such as China,

Taiwan and Korea imported the bulk of these
timber products.

Rimbunan Hijau’s world of forest crime & political patronage

SUMMARY

The findings illustrated in this report have clearly

identified Rimbunan Hijau as being involved in
significant forest crime. It is destructively logging
vast areas of ancient forest in defiance of national
laws, local customs and the rights of resource
owners. It is causing large-scale environmental
damage and increasing the poverty of local people
under the protection of political elites.

Rimbunan Hijau controls industrial-scale logging
operations in at least eight countries and operates
across three continents. Many of its logging
operations are characterised by illegal access,
environmental damage, human rights abuses, social
conflict and political corruption.

Timber harvested by Rimbunan Hijau is traded
around the world – as logs, sawn timber, veneers
and plywood and as finished products like furniture
and ornamental blinds.

Traded and re-traded through Asian, American
and European ports, the illegal timber and timber

products that come from Rimbunan Hijau’s forest
operations have been traced into the stores of some
of the world’s most affluent nations.

After decades of conferences and international

commitments including the Convention on
Biological Diversity, Forest Law Enforcement and
Governance processes, International Tropical Timber
Agreement and the United Nations Forum on
Forests, now is the time for action.

Rimbunan Hijau is a transnational corporation
that represents everything that is wrong with the
way in which forest resources are being managed.
Rimbunan Hijau presents the perfect test against
which to judge the resolve of the international
community to deal effectively with the problems of
forest crime and the trade in illegal timber.

Greenpeace calls on the international community

to take up the challenge and match the global
rhetoric with effective action.

SOLUTIONS

GREENPEACE URGES:

• Protection of remaining forest areas from illegal and destructive logging;

• International financial support to individual countries to replace foregone

logging revenues;

• Effective international action to enforce corporate responsibility and sanction

corporations that operate outside the law;

• International initiatives to stop the cross-border trade in illegal timber and

timber products, including consumer nation timber import controls;

• Further support for market-based initiatives that identify and label products
from sources that are environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.

71 In 1994 scientists at the Environmental
Issues Institute in Khabarovsk detailed
plans for the establishment of the
Verkhne-Soukpai Nature Preserve. This
Preserve was included in the national list
of Nature Preserves and National Parks
approved by the Russian Federal
Government on 10th October 1995.
When it was announced that Rimbunan
Hijau was to be allowed to log inside the
proposed Nature Preserve the Regional
Administration claimed the area had
already lost its environmental values due
to forest cuttings and fires. However a
preliminary investigation in the area in
1999 by the Biodiversity Conservation
Center and ScanEx Technical Centre
contradicted these claims

73 In 2000 Rimbunan Hijau was fined for

environmental violations (RBC
Khabarovski, 17 April 2000) and further
fines have followed according to the
World Wide Fund for Nature (RBC Daily,
18 July 2003) and forests.org
(www.forests.org/recent/2001/ ruhilogg).
