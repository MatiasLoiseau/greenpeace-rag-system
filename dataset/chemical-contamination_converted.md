Executive summary

The global market for electrical and electronic equipment continues
to expand, while the lifespan of many products becomes shorter.
Consequently, the waste stream of obsolete electrical and electronic
products, commonly called “e-waste”, is also vast and growing, with
estimates of 20-50 million tonnes per year being generated world-
wide.  Many of the products contain numerous hazardous chemicals
and materials, and therefore the recycling and disposal of e-waste
poses a threat to the environment and to human health.

In some countries and regions regulations have been introduced
with the aim of restricting the use of hazardous substances in these
products, and the management of e-waste at the products end of life.
However, no such regulations exist in many of the countries in which
where products are manufactured, used and disposed of.
Furthermore, even where they apply, regulations do not control
all hazardous chemicals and materials that are used in newly
manufactured products, nor fully address the management of e-
waste.  Even in the EU, where some of the more stringent regulations
apply, as much as 75% of generated e-waste is unaccounted for.

There is evidence that e-waste is transported internationally from
many countries to destinations where informal recycling and disposal
take place, often in small workshops with little or no regulation.
As a result, impacts have already been reported in many countries,
particularly in Asia.  Recently there has been a growth in these types
of activities in other regions, particularly in some African countries,
including Ghana.

This study, the first to investigate workplace contamination in areas
in Ghana where e-waste recycling and disposal is carried out,
focussed on the main centre for this type of work, at the
Agbogbloshie scrap market in Ghana’s capital, Accra.  One of the
numerous similar, though far smaller, operations that take place
throughout Ghana was also investigated, at the location of a scrap
dealer in Korforidua, a smaller city to the north of Accra.  At these
workshops, e-waste is recycled in a crude way, primarily involving
manual disassembly and open burning to isolate copper from
plastics.  Much of the work is carried out by children, commonly
using only rudimentary tools and with no protective equipment.

Severe chemical contamination was found in ash contaminated
soil samples from open burning sites at both Agbogbloshie and
Korforidua, as well as in sediment from a shallow lagoon at the
Agbogbloshie site.  Most samples contained numerous toxic and
persistent organic chemical pollutants, as well as very high levels of
many toxic metals, the majority of which are either known to be used
in electronic devices, or are likely to be formed during the open-
burning of materials used in such devices.  The nature and extent of
chemical contamination found at these sites in Ghana were similar to
those previously reported for e-waste open burning sites in China,
India and Russia.

At the open burning sites, some metals were present at
concentrations over one hundred times typical background levels
for soils, including lead, a highly toxic metal.  High levels of other
toxic metals, including cadmium and antimony, were also present.
Numerous classes of organic chemicals were also present in one or
more of the samples, including many halogenated (chlorinated or
brominated) chemicals.  Many of the compounds identified are
intentionally used in electronic devices.  These included phthalates,
widely used as plasticisers in flexible plastics such as PVC,
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and triphenyl phosphate
(TPP) both used as flame retardants, and polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) , long banned from manufacture and use but a persistent
legacy in some older electrical goods.  Others compounds found are
known to be formed when hazardous materials in e-waste, such as
PVC, are burned.  Overall, a wide range of the chemical contaminants
present in the samples are toxic, persistent in the environment and, in
some cases, able to bioaccumulate (build up in the body).

Two samples were also analysed for polychlorinated dioxins and
furans (PCDD/Fs), a class of chemical that can be formed during the
combustion of materials present in e-waste.  Soil from an open
burning site was moderately contaminated, while sediment from the
Agbogbloshie lagoon contained a very high level of these highly toxic,
highly persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals, at a level just below
the threshold defined as being indicative of serious contamination for
sediments in the Netherlands.

Though this study did not attempt to quantify damage caused to the
environment or human health, the results do indicate that the
exposure of workers and bystanders to hazardous chemicals may be
substantial.  In areas in other countries where e-waste recycling takes
place, increased exposure to toxic chemicals has been reported for
workers and/or local residents, including for chlorinated dioxins and
furans (PCDD/Fs), certain PBDEs, and the toxic metal lead.

This study demonstrates the urgent need for action to address the
problems posed by the crude recycling and disposal of hazardous
e-waste in Ghana, as well as in other places in which similar activities
take place.  In part, this requires tighter controls on the transboundary
movement of e-waste, including where obsolete equipment is
shipped under the guise of ‘used goods’, and also more effective
controls on the manner in which they are recycled.

Impacts arising from the recycling and disposal of hazardous e-waste
can, however, only be fully addressed by eliminating the use of all
hazardous chemicals and materials during manufacture of new
products coming on to the market and eventually entering the waste
stream themselves.   Where legislation currently exists to regulate the
use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic
equipment, such as the RoHS Directive in the EU, the scope needs to
be extended to cover all hazardous substances and materials used in
their manufacture.  Notable examples not currently regulated by
RoHS include PVC and phthalates (plasticisers widely used in flexible
forms of this plastic).  Furthermore, similar regulation is required in
countries that currently have no strict controls.

Until such regulations are in force, the producers of electrical and
electronic equipment must:-

• lead the way by voluntarily phasing out all hazardous chemicals

and materials from their products

• take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products, which

includes responsibility at the products’ end of life, such as through
effective take back and recycling schemes that are offered free of
charge and globally

• take the necessary steps to individualise their financial responsibility

and internalize their own products end-of-life costs and

• encourage the introduction, in all countries, of adequately stringent

regulation for both the manufacture of electrical and electronic
equipment and the end of life waste management.

The ultimately goal must be to ensure that the quantities of e-waste
generated are minimized and that those e-wastes which do arise are
recycled and disposed of in the best achievable manner to minimize
impacts on human health and the environment.  This can be achieved
in part through the design of products with greater life-spans, that are
safer and easier to repair, upgrade and recycle, and which, as far as
possible, avoid the use of hazardous chemicals.

Introduction

The manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment is a major
and fast growing global sector.  As a consequence, the waste stream
of obsolete electrical and electronic products, commonly called “e-
waste”, is also vast and growing, with estimates of 20-50 million
tonnes per year being generated world-wide (UNEP 2005).  The
recycling and disposal of e-waste poses significant problems,
largely because many of the products contain numerous hazardous
chemicals and materials (including heavy metals such as lead and
cadmium, and organic compounds of chlorine and bromine) which
can pose a threat to the environment and to human health.  Impacts
resulting from the recycling and disposal of e-waste have been
reported in many countries, particularly in Asia (e.g. Brigden et al.
2005, Wong et al. 2007, Leung et al 2007).

In some countries and regions, laws have been introduced to
regulate the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic
equipment.  The most well known of these is the EU Restriction of
the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic
equipment (RoHS) Directive (EU 2002a) which prohibits the use,
above strict limits, of the heavy metals cadmium, lead, hexavalent
chromium (VI) and mercury, as well as certain brominated flame
retardants (BFRs).  The RoHS legislation, however, only currently
addresses a very limited number of hazardous chemicals and
materials commonly used in electronics and, even for those
substances that are regulated, numerous exemptions allow their
use for specific applications.  Similar legislation has been recently
introduced in China and other countries.  The related EU Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires that
producers set up systems and finance for the collection and
treatment of electrical and electronic wastes.  Even with such
regulation, however, it is estimated that only 25% of the e-waste
generated within the EU is currently collected and treated, with as
much as 75% being unaccounted for (Huisman et al. 2007).  In the
US this figure is around 80%. In both regions, some of the e waste
that is unaccounted for is exported to non-OECD countries.
This practice is illegal from the EU, however, in the US such exports
are routinely classified by the US EPA as legitimate recycling
(Cobbing 2008).

There is evidence that hazardous e-waste is transported
internationally to various destinations where recycling and disposal
take place, often in largely unregulated small workshops with little or
no concern for potential impacts on human health or the environment.
Recently there has been a growth in the recycling and disposal of e-
waste in regions beyond those in Asia, in which it has historically
taken place, particularly in some African countries, including Ghana.
As part of this investigation, evidence was obtained that obsolete
electrical and electronic equipment being exported to Ghana is
originating from the European Union and the United States, some
being transported under the guise of second hand goods in order to
overcome restrictions on the exporting of hazardous waste from the
EU.

E-waste recycling within Ghana

In Ghana, the main centre for the recovery of materials from e-wastes
is within the Agbogbloshie Scrap Market in Accra, the capital city of
Ghana.  This is the only place where this type of work is known to be
taking place on a large scale.  There are reports of numerous similar,
though far smaller, operations at other places throughout Ghana.
The primary activities at these sites are the manual disassembly of
obsolete electrical equipment to isolate metals (mainly copper and
aluminium), and the open burning of certain components to isolate
copper from plastics in which they are encased, particularly from
plastic coated wires and cables.  Much of this work is carried out by
children, most using only rudimentary tools and with no protective
equipment.  There are anecdotal reports that plastic casings and
printed circuit boards are separated and collected for sale to traders,
mainly from Asian countries, who export these materials out of
Ghana, presumably for the recovery of materials in other countries.
According to recycling workers, copper is sold at at 22 US (0.22 USD)
cents per half kilo, and collected plastic is sold at 1 US cent (0,01
USD) per kilo.  In some other countries, particularly China and India,
the recycling of e-waste makes use of a wider range of activities
which includes manual dismantling and open burning, but also
somewhat more technical processes such as solder recovery, plastic
shredding, and the use of acid leaching.  These type of more complex
processes are not known to be used in Ghana.

At the Agbogbloshie Market, the main electronic wastes being
processed are obsolete computers, monitors and televisions.
These are manually dismantled at numerous small workshops within
the market.  Certain materials, mainly plastic coated wires and cables,
are subsequently taken to sites on the edge of the market where
they are burned to enable the separation of metals from plastic
materials.  These wires and cable are commonly attached to
fragments of other types of materials, including printed circuit
boards, which consequently are also burned.  Materials of no value
are disposed of in a large area on the edge of the market that is
also used for the disposal of a wide range of other types of wastes.
Scattered fires are set within this area and used to burn e-wastes.
Similar burning also takes place in a second area approximately
100m from the disposal area; no other processing or disposal of
wastes is carried out in this second area.

Two shallow lagoons are situated on the edge of the market, close to
the general disposal area.  The larger lagoon is situated along one
side of this area, the smaller lagoon is situated on the opposite side,
close to areas used for the open burning of e-waste.

Within the open burning areas, numerous temporary fires are used to
burn plastics and other combustible materials from individual batches
of materials.  These small fires are repeatedly set on the sites of
previous fires, leading to an accumulation of ash and partially burned
materials.  Insulating foam from obsolete refrigerators, primarily
polyurethane, is the main fuel used to sustain the fires, and this is
likely to  contribute in itself to acute chemical hazards and longer-term
contamination at the burning sites. In addition, chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) were routinely used as blowing agents for polyurethane foam
until the early 1990’s (UNEP 2003).  The burning of foam containing
CFCs can result in releases of these ozone-depleting substances into
the atmosphere.

The Agbogbloshie market is situated on flat ground alongside the
Densu River.  During periods of heavy rainfall much of the site
becomes flooded and, during these times, it is likely that surface
dusts and soils, along with any chemical contaminant that may
contain, are carried into the adjacent, lower-lying lagoons and the
Densu river which ultimately flows into the ocean.

In addition to this major site in Accra itself, smaller e-waste recycling
and disposal operations can be found in other cities.  For example, a
scrap yard in Korforidua, a smaller city to the north of Accra,  is
thought to be typical of these numerous small e-waste recycling
operations within Ghana, engaged in similar activities to those at
Agbogbloshie but on a far smaller scale.

Sampling program

In order to explore the extent of contamination of wastes and of
surrounding soils and sediments which can arise from the types of
e-waste recycling and disposal operations conducted in Ghana,
samples were collected from the above mentioned locations in both
Accra and Korforidua.  Full details of the samples collected are given
in Table 1.

Table 1. Description of samples collected from e-waste open burning and disposal sites in Accra and
Korforidua, Ghana, 2008

Five samples were collected from e-waste processing areas within
the Agbogbloshie Market.  Three samples of soil/ash were collected
from areas where open burning of separated components takes
place.  Two of these were from separate parts of the area used
exclusively for open burning, approximately 100m from the main
disposal area (GH08002, GH08003).  The third sample (GH08004)
was collected from a burning site within the general waste disposal
area in which fires are more scattered compared to the area used
exclusively for open burning at the market.  One further sample of soil
(GH08005) was collected from a part of the main disposal area where
glass from cathode ray tubes (CRTs), from both televisions and
computer monitors, had been broken to enable recovery of plastic
casings and other materials.  Following this crude separation, the
broken glass and other unwanted materials are simply left at the site.
In addition, a sample of sediment (GH08006) was collected from the
smaller of the two lagoons, that which is situated adjacent to the
open burning areas.

At the smaller workshop in Korforidua, one sample of soil/ash
(GH08001) was collected from a small area adjacent to the scrap
yard that is regularly used for the open burning of components from
e-wastes, primarily plastic coated wires and cables and some
transformers.

Methodology

Results and discussion

All samples were collected and stored in pre-cleaned 100 ml glass
bottles that had been rinsed thoroughly with nitric acid and analytical
grade pentane in order to remove all heavy metal and organic
residues.  Following collection, all samples were returned to the
Greenpeace Research Laboratories in the UK for analysis.

Extractable organic compounds were isolated from each sample and
identified as far as possible using gas chromatography and mass
spectrometry (GC/MS), including the use of Selective Ion Monitoring
(SIM) for certain groups of organic chemicals.  A wide range of metals
and metalloids were quantified in all samples, based on their known
use in electronic devices & previous reports of contamination at e-
waste recycling yards (Brigden et al. 2005).  Additional information on
sample preparation and analytical procedures are presented in
Appendix 1.  Two of the samples collected at Agbogbloshie, an ash-
contaminated soil and a sediment from a lagoon, were also analysed
quantitatively for 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-
dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) at an external laboratory.

The results of the metals quantification (Table 2), and the screening
for organic chemicals (Table 3) for all samples are presented and
discussed below, along with the quantification of PCDD/Fs in two of
the samples (Table 4).

Open burning sites

The samples of soil/ash from open burning sites generally contained
high levels of many metals that are known to be present in electronic
devices, some of which have toxic properties.  Numerous organic
chemical pollutants were also identified.  Again, many of these are
known to be used in electronic devices, or likely to be formed during
the combustion of materials used in such devices.  Similarities were
found between the samples from the different open burning sites,
with regard to those metals present at high levels and the range of
organic chemicals present.

Similar profiles of metal contamination were found in two samples
from an open burning area within the Agbogbloshie Market
(GH08002-03) and in the sample from the open burning site in
Korforidua (GH08001).  Many of the same groups of organic
chemicals were also identified in each of these three samples.  These
data suggest that similar materials had been burned at these different
sites.  However, one sample from a burning site within the disposal
area at the Agbogbloshie Market (GH08004) contained only a fraction
of the organic chemicals found in the other samples, and had
generally lower levels of metals, other than zinc.  This difference may
be due to the more scattered setting of fires in the disposal area, as
well the presence of large amounts of other type of wastes in this
area, which could lead to the dilution of contaminants arising from the
e-wastes.

For the two more highly contaminated samples from the
Agbogbloshie Market (GH08002 03), numerous metals were present
at concentrations far exceeding those typically seen in
uncontaminated soils.  Copper, lead, tin and zinc concentrations were
over one hundred times typical background levels.  Concentrations of
antimony and cadmium in these samples, while lower, are still
indicative of contamination of the site, exceeded typical background
soil levels by around fifty times for antimony and five times for
cadmium (a metal usually found in the environmental at only very low
levels).  In addition, barium concentrations in these samples were
higher than those found in the other soil samples, though within the
broad range of levels found in uncontaminated soils (Alloway 1990,
Salomons & Forstner 1984).

The sample from an open-burning site in Korforidua (GH08001) had a
similar profile of high metal concentrations.  Copper and lead
concentrations were of similar orders of magnitude.  Levels of
antimony, tin and zinc in this sample were lower than those found in
the samples from the Agbogbloshie Market, but all still approximately
ten times higher than general background soil levels (Alloway 1990,
Salomons & Forstner 1984).

The concentration profiles (relative concentrations) of metals in these
samples were similar to those reported for samples collected from
electronic waste open burning sites in China and India (Brigden et al.
2005, Wong et al. 2007) and also more recently in Russia (Labunska
et al. 2008).  Absolute concentration ranges of most metals were also
similar to those reported in these other studies, though levels of
some, especially cadmium, were lower in the samples Ghana.

All the metals found at high levels have known uses in electronic
devices and therefore could be expected in e-waste.  For example, a
major potential source of lead from e-waste is electrical solders,
which until recently have largely been comprised of a mixture of lead
and tin (Geibig & Socolof 2005).  The presence of elevated levels of
both these metals in some samples indicates that leaded solder is a
major source of lead at these sites.  Unlike lead, exposure to
inorganic tin does not usually cause toxic effects in humans or
animals, unless ingested in very large amounts (ATSDR 2005).
Another major use of lead in materials found in e-waste has been the
use of lead compounds as stabilisers in polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a
chlorinated plastic widely used as a coating on wires and cables.
Chemicals used as PVC stabilisers also include compounds of other
metals found at high levels in these samples, including barium,
cadmium and zinc (Matthews 1996).  Compounds of antimony have
also been widely used as additives in polymers, principally in flame
retardant formulations incorporated into the materials (Lau et al.
2003).  The high levels of copper are likely to be due to the presence
of fragments of metallic copper wire.

The elevated levels of lead and cadmium reported here are of
particular concern, as both are highly toxic and can build up in the
body following repeated exposures.  The use of both cadmium and
lead in electronic devices sold within the EU is now regulated, and
largely prohibited, under the RoHS Directive (EU 2002a), though these
and other toxic metals will inevitably persist in components of older
electrical and electronic equipment and will therefore continue to
enter the waste stream for years, if not decades, to come. Antimony
compounds also have known toxic properties, though these
chemicals are not regulated by RoHS.  Additional information on the
uses and toxicity of these metals is given in Box 1.

Box 1: Metals

Lead has many uses in electronics products.  Metallic lead has been
used in electrical solder, commonly as an alloy with tin.  Lead oxide is
used in the glass of cathode ray tubes (CRTs) (OECD 2003), and
lead compounds have been used as stabilisers in PVC formulations
(Matthews 1996).  Concentrations of lead in the environment are
generally low.  Soils and freshwater sediments typically contain less
than 30 mg/kg (Alloway 1990, Salomons & Forstner 1984).  Under
landfill conditions lead can leach from CRT glass (Musson et al.
2000).  Incineration and burning can also result in release of lead to
the air as in the ash produced (Allsopp et al. 2001).  Releases of lead
oxide dust or lead fumes may also occur during glass crushing or
high temperature processing, including smelting (OECD 2003).
Following release to the environment lead has low mobility compared
to most metals.

Workers involved in high temperature processes, such as at lead
smelters, can be significantly exposed to lead fumes (Schutz et al.
2005).  Workers using lead based solders may also be exposed to
lead-bearing dusts and fumes (ATSDR 2007).  Following exposure
humans can accumulate lead, as can many plants and animals
(Sauve et al. 1997, ATSDR 2007).  Where soils and dusts are
contaminated with lead, children can be particularly exposed through
hand-to-mouth transfer (Malcoe et al.  2002).  Children living in an
area in China where electronic wastes are recycled and disposed of
have been found to have elevated blood lead levels compared to
children in a neighboring area (Huo et al. 2007).

Lead is highly toxic to humans as well as many animals and plants.
Lead exposure is cumulative; the effects of exposure are the same
whether through ingestion or inhalation, and some appear to be
irreversible (ATSDR 2007, Bellinger & Dietrich 1994, Goyer 1996).  In
humans, lead has a wide range of effects including damage to the
nervous system and blood system, impacts on the kidneys and on
reproduction.  Of particular concern is the effect of low-level
exposure on brain development in children, which can result in
intellectual impairment.  It is currently thought that there may be no
level of blood-lead that does not produce a toxic effect, particularly in
the developing central nervous system (ATSDR 2007, Canfield et al.
2003).  Similar toxic effects are seen in animals, and lead is also toxic
to all aquatic life (WHO 1989, Sadiq 1992).

A number of regional controls exist on the use of lead in electrical
and electronic equipment.  EU legislation restricting the use of certain
hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS),
prohibits the use of lead in new equipment put on the market from 1
July 2006 (EU 2002a), with a maximum allowable concentration of
0.1% lead by weight in homogeneous materials, with certain
exemptions.  EU legislation addressing waste electrical and
electronic equipment (WEEE) specifies that batteries containing
more than 0.4% lead by weight must be separated from
wastestreams and recycled where appropriate (EU 2002b).
In addition, the European PVC industry has a voluntary agreement
to phase out lead stabilisers in PVC by 2015 (ENDS 2002).

Cadmium and its compounds are used in a number of applications
within electrical and electronic products (OECD 2003).  Cadmium
metal is used in some contacts, switches and solder joints.  Many
devices contain rechargeable nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries
which contain cadmium oxide.  Cadmium compounds have also
been used as stabilisers within PVC formulations, including those
used as wire insulation (Matthews 1996).  Cadmium sulphide has
been also used in cathode ray tubes (CRTs) as a phosphor on the
interior surface of the screen to produce light (Burstall 1997).
Cadmium is a rare metal, found naturally in the environment at very
low concentrations, typically below 2 mg/kg in soils and sediments
(Alloway 1990, Salomons & Forstner 1984).  When released to
aquatic environments cadmium is more mobile than most other
metals (ATSDR 1999).  Cadmium is highly toxic to plants, animals
and humans, having no known biochemical or nutritional function
(ATSDR 1999, WHO 1992).  Exposure can result in bioaccumulation
of cadmium in humans. Many animals and plants, including those
consumed by humans, can also accumulate cadmium, providing an
additional route of dietary exposure for humans (Elinder & Jarup
1996, Olsson et al.  2005).

Cadmium exposure can occur occupationally through inhalation of
fumes or dusts containing cadmium and its compounds, or through
environmental exposures, primarily diet.  Cadmium is a cumulative
toxicant and long-term exposure can result in damage to the kidneys
and bone toxicity.  For the general population and for animals,
cadmium exposure through diet primarily affects the kidneys (Elinder
& Jarup 1996, WHO 1992).  Recent studies have demonstrated
kidney damage in humans at lower levels of exposure than previously
anticipated (Hellstrom et al. 2001).  Other health effects from
cadmium exposure include disruption to calcium mechanisms
causing bone effects, as well as the development of hypertension
(high blood pressure) and heart disease.  In the short term, inhalation
of cadmium oxide fumes or dusts can also affect the respiratory
system (ATSDR 1999, Elinder & Jarup 1996, WHO 1992).
Furthermore, cadmium and its compounds are known to be human
carcinogens, primarily for lung cancer following inhalation (DHSS
2005).

There are a number of regional controls on the use of cadmium in
products.  EU legislation restricting the use of certain hazardous
substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS) prohibits
the use of cadmium in new equipment put on the market from 1 July
2006 (EU 2002a), with a maximum allowable concentration of 0.01%
cadmium by weight in homogeneous materials.  There are
exemptions to this for the use of cadmium in certain plating
applications.  Under legislation addressing waste electrical and
electronic equipment (WEEE), batteries containing more than 0.025%
cadmium by weight must be separated from wastestreams and
recycled where appropriate (EU 2002b).  The use of cadmium in
products is further addressed under other EU legislation, including
restrictions on its use as a colouring agent or stabiliser in a wide
range of products (including PVC) where the cadmium content
exceeds 0.01 %, with some exceptions for safety reasons (EU 1991).

Antimony and its compounds have a number of industrial uses.
For example, antimony compounds are used in semiconductor
manufacture (antimony trihydride) and in flame retardant formulations
in plastics (antimony trioxide), normally in combination with
brominated flame retardants, especially PBDEs (Lau et
al.2003),though there are also reports of use in combination with
phosphorus based flame retardants.  Antimony is also used in the
manufacture of lead acid starter batteries (Kentner et al. 1995) and
can occur as a component of electrical solders.  Although occurring
naturally in soils and sediments, concentrations are commonly
rather low.

Antimony shows many chemical similarities to arsenic (Andrewes
et al. 2004).  Like arsenic, it can undergo methylation as a result of
microbiological activity (i.e. to form its trimethyl derivative, often called
trimethylstibine), albeit at slower rates than for arsenic (Jenkins et al.
2000, Patterson et al. 2003).  It also shows some similarities in its
toxic effects, especially to skin cells (Patterson et al. 2003).
However, unlike arsenic, there are relatively few studies concerning
the toxicity and ecotoxicity of antimony and its compounds.  Those
studies which are available indicate that the toxicity of antimony
depends greatly on its particular form (i.e. its oxidation state).
Trivalent antimony, such as is present in antimony trihydride and
antimony trioxide, is the most toxic state whereas its pentavalent
form is far less toxic (Flynn et al. 2003, Patterson et al. 2003).
Some organic antimony compounds (including trimethylstibine) are
very toxic (Andrewes et al. 2004).  Antimony compounds have been
associated with dermatitis and irritation of respiratory tract, as well
as interfering with normal function of the immune system (Kim et al.
1999).  Antimony trioxide and antimony trisulfide have been listed by
the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as “possibly
carcinogenic to humans”, with inhalation of dusts and vapours the
critical route of exposure (IARC 1989).  Metabolism of antimony
compounds in humans is similarly poorly studied.  There is some
evidence that inorganic antimony compounds, if ingested, can be
converted to organic compounds and reduced to the more toxic
trivalent forms in the body (Andrewes et al. 2004).  Antimony
compounds can be detected in human urine samples from both
occupationally and non-occupationally exposed individuals, with
levels in blood and urine correlating with levels in workplace air for
those occupationally exposed (Kentner et al. 1995, Krachler and
Emons 2001).

The three soil/ash samples with high metal levels also contained
numerous classes of organic chemicals, including many halogenated
(chlorinated or brominated) chemicals (see Table 3).  For example, all
three samples contained chlorinated benzenes and polybrominated
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), though some only at trace levels.  PBDEs
have been widely used as flame retardants in electronic devices,
though once again this use is now regulated within new products
manufactured or sold in the EU as a result of environmental and
human health concerns (EU 2002a).  One of the samples from the
Agbogbloshie Market (GH08003) also contained polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) and other chlorinated chemicals (chlorinated alkyl
benzenes and a chlorinated alkane).  Phthalates were also present in
two of the samples.  The sample from Korforidua (GH08001)
contained triphenyl phosphate (TPP), an organophosphate compound
that has been used as a flame retardant (IPCS 1991).  Other types of
compounds were also abundant in these samples, many of which can
be emitted during the open burning of plastic coated wires and
cables, or other plastic containing electronic wastes, including
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkyl benzenes, nitrile
compounds and numerous alkanes/alkenes (Andersson 2004,
Watanabe et al. 2007).  The one sample that had far lower levels of
metals (GH08004) also contained far fewer organic contaminants.

Just, as for the metals, the majority of organic chemical groups
identified in the samples from Ghana have been previously reported in
samples from e-waste open burning sites in China, India and Russia
(Brigden et al. 2005, Labunska et al. 2008), including chlorinated
compounds (chlorinated benzenes, PCBs), brominated compounds
(PBDEs), and phthalates.

Where present in the soil/ash samples (i.e. GH08001 & GH08003),
the phthalate ester DEHP was the most abundant of all organic
chemicals isolated.  One of the samples (GH08001) also contained
three other phthalates commonly used as plasticizers (softeners) in
flexible PVC, namely DBP, DiBP and DiNP.  All phthalates identified
have known toxic properties, and two, DEHP and DBP, have been
classified in Europe as toxic to reproduction, due to their ability to
interfere with sexual development in mammals, especially in males
(Langezaal 2002).  Phthalate-plasticized PVC is commonly used for
the flexible coatings of both internal and external wires and cables
used for electrical and electronic devices.  These were the
predominant materials being burned at the time that the samples
were collected, and it is likely that they are largely responsible for the
presence of phthalates in these samples.

In addition to the release of chemical additives, including heavy
metals and phthalates, the burning of PVC itself can generate many
of the organic chemicals identified in some of the samples, including
chlorinated benzenes from monochlorobenzene through to
hexachlorobenzene (Grimes et al. 2006) and, in the case of sample
GH08003, chlorinated alkyl benzenes (Andersson 2004), as well as
certain polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs (Hedman et al. 2005).
It is also possible, however, that the presence of PCBs in sample
GH08003 could have arisen from the disposal of obsolete transformer
components or capacitors in which these compounds were formerly
used as electrical insulants and heat transfer fluids (de Voogt &
Brinkman 1989), sometimes in conjunction with chlorinated
benzenes, mainly tri- and tetrachlorobenzenes (Swami et al. 1992,
de Voogt and Brinkman 1989).

Chlorinated benzenes and PCBs are groups of compounds that,
once emitted, will persist (resist breakdown) in the environment
and can bioaccumulate (build up in the body), especially the PCBs.
A wide range of toxic effects have been reported for chlorinated
benzenes (particularly the more highly chlorinated compounds) and
for PCBs, in the latter case even at relatively low doses.  PCBs are
regulated as persistent organic pollutants, or POPs, under the 2001
Stockholm Convention.  For more information on these compounds
see Text Box 2.  No information could be found on the potential
impacts of the chlorinated alkyl benzenes identified (cis- and trans-
beta-chlorostyrene), though these compounds are unlikely to persist
in the environment following release.  In addition to the compounds
identified, the burning of chlorinated plastics such as PVC also
releases large quantities of hydrogen chloride, a corrosive gas that
can be acutely toxic through inhalation.

One of the soil/ash samples collected (GH08003) was also analysed
quantitatively for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans
(PCDD/Fs), highly persistent toxic chemicals that can be produced
during the combustion of chlorinated organic materials, including
PVC.  This sample contained a moderately high level of PCDD/Fs.
The results of the PCDD/F analysis of this sample, along with those
of the lagoon sediment (GH08006) are discussed in a separate
section below.

Box 2: Phthalates

Phthalates (or, more accurately, phthalate diesters) are non-
halogenated chemicals with a diversity of uses, dominated by use
as plasticizers (or softeners) in plastics, especially PVC (e.g. in
coated wires and cables and other flexible components).  Other
applications included uses as components of inks, adhesives,
sealants, surface coatings and personal care products.  Some
phthalates are discrete chemicals, such as the well known di(2-
ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), while others are complex mixtures of
isomers, such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP).

All uses of phthalates, especially the major use as PVC plasticisers,
result in large-scale losses to the environment (both indoors and
outdoors) during the lifetime of products, and again following
disposal.  Within the EU alone, this amounts to thousands of tonnes
per year (CSTEE 2001).  As a result, phthalates are among the most
ubiquitous man-made chemicals found in the environment.  They
are widely found in the indoor environment, including in air and dust
(Otake et al. 2001, Butte & Heinzow 2002, Fromme et al. 2004).
Phthalates are commonly found in human tissues, including in blood
and, as metabolites, in urine (Colon et al. 2000, Blount et al. 2000,
Silva et al. 2004).  In humans and other animals they are relatively
rapidly metabolised to their monoester forms, but these are
frequently more toxic than the parent compound (Dalgaard et al.
2001).

Substantial concerns exist with regard to the toxicity of phthalates
to wildlife and humans.  For example, DEHP, one of the most widely
used to date, is a known reproductive toxin, capable (in its
monoester form MEHP) of interfering with development of the testes
in early life.  In addition, adverse impacts on female reproductive
success in adult rats and on development of the young have been
reported following exposure to this chemical (Lovekamp-Swan &
Davis 2003).  Butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) and dibutyl phthalate
(DBP) have also been reported to exert reproductive toxicity (Ema &
Miyawaki 2002, Mylchreest et al. 2002).  Both DEHP and DBP are
classified as “toxic to reproduction” within Europe.  Recent research
has revealed a correlation between phthalate exposure during
pregnancy and decreased ano-genital index (distance from the anus
to the genitals) in male children (Swan et al. 2005).  Decreased AGI
correlated with concentrations of four phthalate metabolites, namely
monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP),
monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP).
It was also found that DBP can not only be taken up by crops and
enter the food chain, but also affects the physiology and the
morphology of some crops during growth (Liao 2006).   Other
commonly used phthalates, including the isomeric forms DINP and
DIDP (diisodecyl phthalate), are of concern because of observed
effects on the liver and kidney, albeit at higher doses.

At present, there are few controls on the marketing and use of
phthalates, despite their toxicity, the volumes used and their
propensity to leach out of products throughout their lifetime.  Of the
controls which do exist, however, probably the best known is the
EU-wide ban on the use of six phthalates in children’s toys and
childcare articles, first agreed as an emergency measure in 1999
and finally made permanent in 2005 (EC 2005).  While this
addresses one important exposure route, exposures through other
consumer products remain unaddressed, including electrical and
electronic equipment.

Box 3: Chlorinated compounds

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) Polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) are a group of organic chemicals that contain 209 individual
compounds (known as congeners) with varying patterns of chlorine
substitution. PCBs have been used in a wide variety of applications,
including transformer oils, capacitor dielectrics, hydraulic fluids,
plasticisers. and printing inks (ATSDR 2000).  Use in transformer oils
(frequently with tri- and tetrachlorobenzenes as solvents, Swami et
al. 1992) and capacitors accounted for the greatest tonnages (de
Voogt & Brinkman 1989).  Production of PCBs was banned in 1977
when their ability to accumulate in the environment and to cause
harmful effects became apparent (ATSDR 2000).  At least one third
of the PCBs that have been produced are now estimated to have
entered the environment (Swedish EPA 1999). The other two thirds
remain in old electrical equipment and in waste dumps, from which
they continue to leach into the environment, including when
obsolete equipment is dismantled, recycled and/or disposed of.
PCBs can also be produced during the combustion of chlorinated
organic materials, including PVC (Hedman et al. 2005, Wikstrom &
Marklund 2001).

Once released to the environment from whatever source, PCBs are
highly persistent.  Furthermore, PCBs that are taken up by
organisms accumulate in them, for aquatic organisms and fish levels
can reach many thousands of times higher than levels in
surrounding water (ATSDR 2000, Jones et al. 1988).  PCBs can
also be absorbed through the skin as well as through ingestion and
inhalation.  For the general population today, food is undoubtedly
the primary route of exposure to PCBs (see e.g. review by Allsopp
et al. 2000), although dermal exposure may be dominant amongst
those directly handling PCBs or PCB-contaminated materials (Lees
et al. 1987).

PCBs exhibit a wide range of toxic effects in animals, including
immunosuppression, liver damage, tumour promotion, neurotoxicity,
behavioural changes and damage to both male and female
reproductive systems (Seegal and Shain 1992, Safe 1993, Rice
1999).  PCBs may also affect many endocrine systems (Brouwer et
al. 1999).  Although it is difficult to assess the impact on animal
populations in the wild, not least because they are exposed to
complex mixtures of chemical contaminants, some immunological
and reproductive disorders in marine mammals have nevertheless
been linked to elevated levels of persistent organochlorines, in
particular the PCBs (see reviews by Allsopp et al. 1999, 2001a,
Haave et al. 2003).  In humans, the greatest body of research on the
toxic effects of PCBs has come from two incidents in Japan and
Taiwan where people consumed cooking oil that was contaminated
with PCBs and other organochlorines.  A recent review of data for
children born to mothers exposed to PCBs and PCDFs in the
Taiwan incident notes higher incidences of retarded growth, delayed
cognitive development and behavioural problems than in children of
unexposed mothers (Guo et al. 2004). In young men with prenatal
exposure there was also significantly increased abnormal
morphology of sperm.  Studies on the general populations of the
Netherlands and the Arctic and families of Swedish fishermen
suggested that even relatively low levels of exposure to PCBs can
result in impacts on the immune system growth retardation and
neurological effects (Allsopp et al. 1999, Allsopp et al. 2001a,
Weisglas-Kuperus et al. 2004).

The control of PCBs is addressed under many international legal
instruments relating to environmental pollution (inter alia, the
Barcelona, Helsinki, Basel, Bamako, Rotterdam, OSPAR and
LRTAP Conventions and the International Joint Commission on the
Great Lakes). In addition, PCBs are targeted for global production
ban under the 2001 Stockholm Convention on persistent organic
pollutants (POPs), an instrument which also requires proper controls
on destruction of stockpiles and the handling of wastes.

Chlorinated Benzenes

Chlorinated benzenes, or chlorobenzenes, are chlorinated
derivatives of benzene, possessing between one and six chlorine
atoms (i.e. mono- to hexachlorobenzene).  Chlorobenzenes,
especially mono-, di-, tri- and hexachlorinated forms, have had a
variety of uses, including as solvents (e.g. in commercial PCB
formulations) and intermediates in the manufacture of other
chemicals such as antioxidants, dyes and pigments,
pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals (Budavari et al. 2000,
ATSDR 2002).  Today only mono- and dichlorobenzenes continue
to be manufactured in substantial quantities.  In addition,
chlorinated benzenes can be emitted during the combustion of the
chlorinated plastic PVC (Grimes et al. 2006).

Chlorobenzenes are relatively persistent in the environment and can
bioaccumulate in both terrestrial and aquatic systems.  Both acute
and chronic effects have been reported in a wide range of aquatic
organisms and in mammals.  Effects of exposure vary depending on
the chlorobenzene in question, though common impacts include
those on the liver, thyroid and central nervous system (CNS).  In
general terms, toxicity tends to increase with increasing degree of
chlorination (WHO 2004).  For tri- and tetrachlorobenzenes, impacts
on liver, kidney and thyroid are among the most commonly reported
in mammals (Giddings et al. 1994a, b).  Some evidence for fetal and
developmental toxicity has been reported for both tetra- and
pentachlorobenzenes (Giddings et al. 1994c).  Hexachlorobenzene
(HCB) is toxic to plants, animals and humans. It is listed by the IARC
as a Group 2B carcinogen, i.e. possible carcinogen to humans, and
also appears to be a tumour promoter. Hexachlorobenzene may
damage the developing foetus, liver, immune system, thyroid,
kidneys and CNS, with the liver and nervous system the most
sensitive to its effects. (Newhook & Meek 1994, van Birgelen 1998,
ATSDR 2002).  HCB has been shown to be an endocrine disruptor
in laboratory animal studies (Ralph et al. 2003), and research
suggests that HCB has dioxin-like toxicity (van Birgelen 1998) and
that it could therefore make a substantial contribution to overall
dioxin-type toxic effects in humans and wildlife (Pohl et al. 2001).

Hexachlorobenzene is the most regulated chemical among all
chlorinated benzenes, and is included as one of twelve priority
POPs covered by the 2001 Stockholm Convention on persistent
organic pollutants (POPs).  Pentachlorobenzene is one of the priority
substances under the EU Water Framework Directive (EU 2001).
Recently pentachlorobenzene was proposed as a candidate for
inclusion in the UNECE Protocol on POPs (under the LRTAP
Convention), based on its potential for long-range atmospheric
transport, persistence (in water, sediment and soil), bioaccumulation
and (eco)toxicity (van de Plassche et al. 2002).

Greenpeace International 13

Box 4. Flame retardants

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)  Polybrominated
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are one of several classes of brominated
compound in widespread use as flame retardant additives in plastics
and foams, including plastic casings of electronic equipment (OECD
2003). There are many different chemicals (congeners) included in
this group, differing in the numbers and positioning of bromine atoms
in the molecules. Those in common commercial use are “penta” (i.e.
a mixture rich in pentabrominated congeners), “octa”, (rich in
octabrominated congeners) and “deca” (almost exclusively the
decabrominated congener).

PBDEs are environmentally persistent chemicals. Some, especially
the lower brominated congeners (e.g. “penta-BDE”), are also highly
bioaccumulative. Their manufacture and use as additives in plastics
and other polymers, in which they are not tightly bound to the
polymer matrix, has led to their widespread presence in the
environment. PBDEs can be detected in indoor air and dusts in the
workplace and in the home (Santillo et al. 2003 a & b). They also
occur in almost every part of the environment, including sediments
(Allchin & Morris 2002), freshwater and marine fish (Asplund et al.
1999a, b), birds eggs (Hites 2004) and even whales from the deep
oceans and the Arctic (Ikonomou et al. 2002).

PBDEs have also been reported as common contaminants in
humans, including reports from Sweden, Spain, Finland and North
America (Lindstrom et al. 1997, Meneses et al. 1999, Strandman et
al. 1999, She et al. 2000). Concentrations of lower brominated
PBDEs have shown increasing levels in both blood and breast milk in
recent decades, particularly in regions in which “penta” remains in
commercial use (Alaee et al. 2003, Meironyte et al. 1999, Thomsen
et al. 2002).  Workers in electronics recycling facilities in Europe have
been found to have higher blood levels of PBDEs than other workers,
probably as a result of inhalation of contaminated dust (Sjödin et al.
2001, Sjödin et al. 2003). Similarly, elevated levels have been
reported in the blood of workers (Qu et al. 2007) and local residents
(Bi et al 2007) at an e-waste recycling area in China.  For the general
population, exposure to PBDEs probably occurs through a
combination of food contamination and direct exposure to chemicals
from consumer products and/or contaminated dusts (Harrad et al.
2004). While their acute toxicity is considered low, chronic exposure
to certain PBDEs (especially in the womb) has been associated with
abnormal brain development in animals (Eriksson et al. 2002), with
possible long-term impacts on memory, learning and behaviour
(Darnerud 2003, Eriksson et al. 2001, 2002, Viberg et al. 2004).
There are concerns that similar effects may be of relevance in
humans (Branchi et al. 2003). PBDEs also exhibit endocrine
(hormone) disrupting properties, interacting with both oestrogen and
thyroid hormone systems either as the parent compound or as
metabolites (Meerts et al. 1998, 2001, Legler & Brouwer 2003).
Effects on the immune system have also been reported (Birnbaum

& Staskal 2004, Darnerud 2003). Furthermore, when plastics
containing PBDEs are burned, either in an incinerator or by open
burning, the potential exists for formation of brominated
dioxins/furans (IPCS 1998) or mixed bromochloro dioxins/furans
(Söderström & Marklund 2002), which appear to be of equivalent
or even greater toxicity to chlorinated dioxins (Olsman et al. 2007).

Because of these environmental and human health concerns,
controls are increasingly being placed on the use of PBDEs (along
with some other brominated fame retardants) in some regions.
Penta-BDE is included as a “priority hazardous substance” under
the EU Water Framework Directive (EU 2001) and remains under
consideration for inclusion as a POP (persistent organic pollutant)
under the 2001 global Stockholm Convention (Peltola & Yla-
Mononen 2001, UNEP 2006a). Both “penta” and “octa” are now
banned from use in Europe (EU 2003), and specifically within the
electronics sector the use of all PBDEs, including “deca”, is
prohibited under the Restrictions on Hazardous Substances in
electrical and electronic equipment Directive (RoHS) (EU 2002a).

Triphenyl Phosphate (TPP)

Triphenyl phosphate, one of a number of so-called triaryl
phosphates, has long been used as flame retardant, primarily in
phenolic and phenylene oxide-based resins (IPCS 1991).  Other
applications include use as a plasticiser in photographic films and
as a component of hydraulic fluids and oils.  Loss of TPP to the
environment as a result of leaching from polymers in which it is
incorporated has long been recognised.  Carlsson et al. (1997)
reported the presence of TPP, among other organophosphorus
flame retardants, as a contaminant of indoor air in buildings with
different uses in Sweden (Carlsson et al. 2000).  Further
investigations revealed that TPP was present at levels up to 10%
by weight of the plastic in the outer covers of some computer
monitors.  Combustion of polymers containing TPP may also be a
major source to the environment (IPCS 1991).

TPP is the most acutely toxic to aquatic life of all the triaryl
phosphates in common use (IPCS 1991).  It has been reported as
a contaminant in human blood (Jonsson et al. 2001) and is a
strong inhibitor of a key enzyme (monocyte carboxyl esterase) in
human blood cells (Amini & Crescenzi 2003).  Recent research has
also indicated an ability to inhibit human androgen hormone
reception in vitro (Honkakoski et al. 2004).  Contact dermatitis
following exposure to TPP has been reported by several authors,
with some cases dating back to the 1960s (Carlsson et al. 1997
and Sanchez et al. 2003).

Lagoon sediment

The sample of sediment (GH08006) collected from a shallow lagoon
located near to e-waste disposal and open burning areas within the
Agbogbloshie Market contained a very similar profile of metal
concentrations to those in the more contaminated soil/ash samples
described above.  The concentrations of these metals were all
somewhat lower in the sediment than the soil/ash samples, but were
still significantly higher than levels typically found in the environment.

Furthermore, the sediment also contained most classes of organic
chemicals that were found in the soil/ash samples, including the
phthalate DEHP, a wide range of chlorinated benzenes (some at trace
levels), traces of PBDEs and numerous hydrocarbons which can be
generated as residues of incomplete combustion.

The similarities in the range of chemicals present in the lagoon sediment
to those found in the more contaminated burning site samples
suggests the migration of pollutants away from the burning sites into
surface waters, probably as a result of heavy rainfall and flooding.

In addition to samples from the open burning sites, soil from an area
in which CRT glass was disposed of (GH08005) contained some
metals at levels above those typically found in uncontaminated soils,
including copper, lead, yttrium and zinc, though at levels far lower
than those recorded in some of the open burning site samples.

This was, however, the only sample with a level of yttrium above
typical background soil levels of this metal (Tyler 2004).  Compounds
of yttrium have been used in CRTs as ‘phosphor’ coatings, materials
on the inside surface of the glass screen that produce light when the
CRT is in operation (Burstall 1997).  While there is little evidence to
suggest that yttrium is toxic, the elevated level of this metal further
demonstrates the potential for chemicals within e-waste to become
distributed into the environment through disposal.  Copper, lead and
zinc have also been used with CRTs, including the use of lead in
electrical solder (Geibig & Socolof 2005) and within the glass as lead
oxide (ICER 2003), and the use of zinc compounds in ‘phosphor’
coatings (Burstall 1997).  Under landfill conditions, metals including
lead and zinc are able to leach in appreciable amounts from CRTs
and other electronic devices (Musson et al. 2006).  Elevated soil levels
of yttrium, lead and zinc have been previously reported at CRT
recycling sites in India (Brigden et al. 2005).

This soil also contained some of the organic pollutants identified in the
samples from the burning sites, including DEHP and traces of PBDEs,
though fewer compounds overall were present in this sample.

The chemical contamination at this location may be due to releases
from CRT monitors as well as dispersal of these pollutants from other
more contaminated sections of the market, particularly during periods
of flooding.  Such dispersion was also indicated by the results for the
sediment sample from the nearby lagoon (GH08006).

Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans
(PCDD/Fs)

The combustion of chlorinated organic materials, including PVC
coated wires, can produce polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and
furans (PCDD/Fs) (Andersson 2004, Gullet et al. 2007, Hedman et al.
2005), compounds that are toxic, highly persistent in the environment
and able to bioaccumulate, and are also classified as human
carcinogens (ATSDR 1998, IARC 1997).

As noted above, two of the samples collected in the current study
were subjected to quantitative analysis for a range of the more toxic
PCDD/Fs (2,3,7,8-substituted congeners); ash-contaminated soil
from the open-burning site at the Agbogbloshie Market at which the
widest range of chlorinated compounds had been identified
(GH08003), and sediment from the adjacent shallow lagoon
(GH08006).  Levels of PCDD/Fs are commonly reported as toxicity
equivalent value (TEQs, i.e. concentration equivalents to the most
toxic congener, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD)) as
well as concentrations by mass, to take into account the different
toxicities of individual congeners.  The TEQ levels for the two
samples are summarized in Table 4, with detailed data presented
in Appendix 1.

GH08003 & GH08006, expressed as toxicity equivalent value (TEQs) in pg/g.

The level of PCDD/Fs in the soil/ash (GH08003) was 31 pg/g TEQ.
This value is considerably lower than some very high levels that have
been reported for soils and combustion residues from e-waste open
burning sites in China, where levels as high as 9265 TEQ pg/g have
been reported (Wong et al. 2007).  Other studies have reported
concentrations in e-waste combustion residues ranging from 84-174
pg/g TEQ (Leung et al. 2007) up to 675 pg/g TEQ (Brigden et al.
2005).

Nonetheless, the TEQ value for sample GH08003 does indicate
moderate contamination of this location with PCDD/Fs.  Although
background levels of PCDD/Fs in soils and sediments have not been
reported for Ghana, the level in GH08003 is higher than soil
concentrations reported for unpolluted areas in other countries, which
are commonly below 1 pg/g TEQ and rarely above 10 pg/g TEQ,
including lightly polluted urban and industrial soils (Zhu et al. 2008).

A far higher PCDD/F level was found in the lagoon sediment (988
pg/g TEQ).Unlike many of the other contaminants identified, PCDD/Fs
are not released as components of the materials being burned, but
rather are formed as products of incomplete combustion in the
presence of sources of carbon and chlorine (e.g. PVC), with the
reaction being catalysed by the presence of metals such as copper.
This process can disperse fine ashes containing PCDD/Fs to areas
surrounding burning sites, leading to contamination of surface soils
and dusts.  The far higher level in the lagoon sediment is perhaps the
result of the deposition of ashes formed during open-burning directly
to the lagoon as well as run-off of contaminated dusts and soils from
surrounding areas, as well as the open burning sites themselves,
during times of heavy rain and flooding.

Though data on dioxin distribution are not available for Ghana, levels
of PCDD/Fs in surface sediments from lakes and rivers in other
countries are generally below 20 pg/g TEQ, even in moderately
polluted locations (Lui et al. 2007, El-Kady et al. 2007).  The lagoon
sediment level is very close to the 1000 pg/g TEQ threshold level
defined as being indicative of serious contamination for soil and
sediment in the Netherlands (NMHSPE 2000), and also the level in soil
used to assess the need for clean up of a site in the United States
(USEPA 1998).

The profile of congeners (individual PCDD/F compounds) for the two
samples (GH08003 & GH08006) were very similar.  These were also
similar to the profiles reported for PCDD/Fs produced during the
combustion of PVC coated wires under open burning conditions
(Gullet et al. 2007) and also for combustion residues collected from e-
waste open burning sites in China (Brigden et al. 2005, Leung et al.
2007).  These similarities indicate that the open burning of e-wastes
may be a primary source of PCDD/Fs at this site.

Conclusions

This study is the first to investigate environmental contamination
resulting from the crude recycling of e-waste in Ghana, and highlights
the nature of health and environmental concerns arising from these
activities.

The recovery of materials at the recycling yards is carried out with little
regard for the health and safety of the workers, and with no regard for
the environment.  These practices have resulted in severe
contamination of the workplaces with a range of toxic metals as well
as persistent and toxic organic contaminants.  Many of the chemical
pollutants identified are either intentionally incorporated into electronic
products, or are known to be generated during crude recovery
processes from materials in the e-wastes, particularly through the
widespread practice of open burning commonly employed to
separate metals from plastics.  Many of the chemicals identified may
be associated with the presence of PVC formulations within e-waste
being recycled.  This chlorinated plastic, which generally requires the
use of chemical additives, is widely used in coated wires and cables,
one of the main materials burned at the sites investigated.

The extent of workplace contamination found in Ghana was similar to
that reported for locations in other countries where manual
dismantling and open burning of e-waste is carried out, though some
additional activities known to take place at e waste recycling
workshops in other countries were not observed at either of the sites
investigated in Ghana.  Contamination of the wider environment
surrounding e-waste recycling yards with many of the same
chemicals has also been demonstrated in other countries, including
within the homes of recycling workers (Brigden et al. 2005, Leung et
al. 2008).

The investigation in Ghana focused exclusively on chemical
contamination in and around the workplaces and did not attempt to
quantify the damage likely to be caused to human health from these
activities.  Nevertheless, the results do indicate that the exposure of
workers and bystanders to hazardous chemicals may be substantial
as a result of the hazardous chemicals and materials contained within
electrical and electronic equipment, and the crude processes used to
recycle and dispose of them.  Increased exposure to toxic chemicals
associated with e-waste recycling has been demonstrated in other
countries, for both workers and local residents.  In an e-waste
recycling area in China, for example, children have been found to
have significantly higher levels of the toxic metal lead in their blood
compared to children in a neighboring area (Huo et al 2007).  Other
studies indicate that people living in areas where e waste recycling
takes place carry higher tissue levels of chlorinated dioxins and furans
(Chan et al. 2007).  Furthermore, recycling workers may commonly
carry significantly higher concentrations of certain PBDEs in their
blood compared to the general population (Qu et al 2007).

This study extends current knowledge on the consequences of poor
management of the large and ever-growing waste stream of obsolete
electrical and electronic goods, particularly through crude recycling
operations.  It was conducted against the backdrop of an apparent
recent increase in the prevalence of e-waste recycling in countries
such as Ghana, beyond those countries more commonly associated
with such activities, especially China and India.

The data demonstrate the urgent need for action to address the
management of hazardous e-waste, both the need for tighter controls
on the transboundary movement of such wastes, and also on the
manner in which they are recycled.  Furthermore, this study highlights
the need for the redesign of new electronic goods to avoid the use of
hazardous chemical components during their manufacture, not least
to facilitate safer and more effective dismantling and component
separation at the products end of life.

Within Europe, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)
and the related Restrictions on Hazardous Substances (RoHS)
Directives go some way towards addressing the problems.  However,
these legislation apply only within the EU and, even then, cover only a
fraction of the hazardous substances used in electronics
manufacturing.  To offer the necessary protection to human health
and the environment, the EU RoHS Directive and similar regulations in
other countries need to be extended to cover the far wider range of
hazardous substances and materials used by this sector, including
chemicals specifically identified in this study, for example phthalates,
PVC and antimony.  Until such regulations are in force, the producers
of electrical and electronic equipment need to lead the way by
voluntarily phasing out all hazardous chemicals and materials from
their products.  These chemicals will, of course, remain as a problem
for some time to come as older equipment becomes obsolete and
enters the waste stream, but ultimately it is only through stricter
controls applied at the manufacturing stage that we will stop adding
to this toxic legacy of poor design.

In addition to the analytical results presented in this report, evidence
is available that e-waste from other countries, some imported under
the guise of ‘used goods’, provides much of the material being
recycled within Ghana.  These include materials from the EU, from
where the export of working used goods is permitted though the
export of hazardous e waste to non-OECD countries is illegal
(Houben et al. 2008).  Proper control of this transboundary
movement, at both the export and import stages, could, therefore,
reduce the scale of e-waste recycling and the resulting impacts.  A
requirement to test used goods prior to export, in order to ensure that
they are not obsolete devices, would offer greater protection against
improper, and in some cases illegal, shipments.  Decision trees have
been developed for evaluating whether equipment is obsolete and
therefore the suitability of transboundary movement for re-use,
including for example within  the Basel Convention (UNEP 2006b).

Furthermore, manufacturers have a responsibility to encourage the
strengthening of existing legislation and, where lacking, the
development new legislation regulating electrical and electronic
equipment, including control of the use of hazardous substances
during their manufacture, and also the financial responsibility for end
of life management of products, in part through ensuring that funds
are available to set up and operate the necessary high quality
collection and treatment infrastructures.

The combination of improved regulation and greater responsibility on
the part of producers can not only enable verification that e-wastes
are recycled and disposed of in the best achievable manner to
minimize impacts on human health and the environment, but can also
provide producers with financial and other incentives that will
encourage the design of products with greater life-spans, that are
safer and easier to repair, upgrade and recycle, and which avoid the
use of hazardous chemicals during their manufacture.

National guidelines are currently being developed in Ghana to regulate
the importation of used electronic goods into the country (Good
Electronics 2008), but other controls are also needed.  The
transboundary shipment of hazardous waste, including e-waste, from
within the EU is already regulated, with export to developing countries
such as Ghana supposedly being prohibited (EU 2006).  Furthermore,
the UN Basel Convention is a global agreement that addresses the
international transport of hazardous waste, including e-waste.  The
Ban Amendment of the Basel Convention which prohibits the
shipment of e-waste and other hazardous waste to non-OECD
countries (including Ghana) from OECD countries is still awaiting its
entry into force.  There is clearly an urgent need for the ratification of
the Basel Convention Ban Amendment, and stricter enforcement of all
laws regulating the transboundary movement of e-waste.
Furthermore there is a need for greater regulation of informal e-waste
recycling in all countries where it takes place, to improve conditions
and to formalise this sector.

Ultimately, however, the manufacturers of electronic products must
take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products, even
before it is a global legal requirement.  This includes responsibility at
the products’ end of life, such as through take back and recycling
schemes offered free of charge and globally (wherever their products
are sold).  To achieve the necessary goals these schemes must be
highly publicised and accessible, of a high quality, and, where
necessary, offer adequate financial compensation to support
collection and recycling  in order to minimise the transfer of e-waste
to the informal recycling and disposal sector. Increased levels of
scrutiny of the take-back (collection) chain as well as improvements in
product identifiability will help to better identify `leaks´ from the formal
to informal channels.  Greater individualization of a producers
responsibility for its own branded products will drive efforts to verify
the producers own take-back rates and more readily enable
identification of its own products at the end of their lives, thereby
offering greater opportunities for closer scrutiny of the take-back
chain.

Appendix 2. Analytical methodology

On arrival at the lab, two sub-samples were taken from each original
sample. One of the sub-samples was subjected to qualitative organic
analysis and the other was analysed for metals content. Details of the
methods for sample preparation, organic chemicals screening
analysis and metals analysis are given below.

Analysis for extractable organic compounds

20 µg of deuterated naphthalene was added as an Internal Standard
(IS) to each sub-sample.  For sediment samples, approximately 30 g
of each sample was extracted twice using 15ml pentane and 5ml
acetone at 69°C with sonication for 2h, once at the original pH and
once following acidification to pH 2 with nitric acid (10% v/v).  The
extracts underwent clean-up prior to analysis.  The two extracts
obtained were combined, concentrated to 3ml, shaken with 3ml
isopropyl alcohol and 3ml TBA-reagent (mixture of 3%
tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate and 20% sodium sulphite in
deionised water) and left for separation.  The pentane phase was
collected and eluted through a Florisil column using a 95:5
pentane:toluene mixed eluent, and then concentrated to 2ml.  20 µg
of bromonaphthalene was added as an IS to each extract prior to
GC/MS analysis.

Sample extracts were analysed using an Agilent 6890 Series gas
chromatograph with a Restek Rtx-XLB column (30m , 0.25mm ID,
0.25 µm film thickness) linked to an Agilent 5973 Inert MSD operated
in EI mode and interfaced with an Agilent Enhanced Chem Station
data system.  GC oven temperature program was: 35°C, raised to
260°C at 100C/min, then to 295°C at 50°C/min (held for 5min), then
to 325°C at 50°C/min (held for 12min), and then to 330°C at
50°C/min (held for 4min).  Carrier gas was helium at 2ml/min.
Identification of compounds was carried out by matching spectra
against Agilent Wiley7N and Pesticides Libraries.  Additionally, spectra
and retention time of compounds isolated from the samples were
matched against those obtained during GC/MS analysis of standard
mixtures containing a range of chlorinated benzenes, phenols and
pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aliphatic hydrocarbons.

Extraction efficiency was evaluated using the response of IS
deuterated naphthalene spike.

Analysis for metals

Sediment and soil samples were air dried to constant weight, sieved
through a 2mm mesh and then powdered using a pestle and mortar.
Approximately 0.5g of each sample was digested by the addition of
7.5ml concentrated hydrochloric acid, 2.5 ml concentrated nitric acid
and 10 ml deionised water, firstly overnight at room temperature, then
for 4 hours under reflux at 130°C.  Digests were filtered and made up
to 50ml with deionised water.

Two samples were prepared in duplicate and analysed to verify
method reproducibility, along with an identically prepared blank.
To check the method efficiency certified reference material (CRM)
samples were prepared in an identical manner (GBW07406, yellow-
red soil, certified by the China National; Analysis Centre for Iron and
Steel, Beijing, China and LGC6180, Pulverised Fuel Ash certified by
the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, UK)

Prepared samples were analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma
Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) using a Varian MPX
Simultaneous Spectrometer.  Multi-element standards at
concentrations of 1 mg/l and 10 mg/l, and matrix matched for the
samples, were used for instrument calibration.  Calibration of the ICP-
AES was validated by the use of quality control standards at 8 mg/l
prepared from different reagent stocks to the instrument calibration
standards.  Any sample exceeding the calibration range was diluted
accordingly, in duplicate, and re-analysed.

In addition, for each sample, mercury (Hg) was also determined using
cold vapour generation ICP-AES.  Ionic mercury, Hg (II), was reduced
to elemental mercury, Hg (0), through reation of the sample with
sodium borohydride (0.6% w/v), sodium hydroxide (0.5% w/v) and
hydrochloric acid (10 molar).  The elemental mercury vapour was
carried in a stream of argon into the spectrometer.  Two calibration
standards were prepared, at 10 μg/l and 100 μg/l, matrix matched to
the samples.  The calibration was validated using a quality control
standard (80 μg/l), prepared internally from different reagent stock.
