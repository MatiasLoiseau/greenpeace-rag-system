The US coal industry—reeling from sagging domestic demand, plum-
meting profits, and tanking stock prices—is desperate for a new market
for its wares. And it thinks that it has found one in China. The Asian
giant consumes more coal than any other nation, and its recent surge
in coal imports has captured fully 20 percent of the international coal
trade. US coal producers express confidence that China’s imports will
continue to grow—and that the struggling US coal industry can fight off
both Chinese coal producers and international competitors to capture a
significant share of the Chinese coal market.

But can China really provide the stable, reliable import market that the
US coal industry seeks? There are strong signs that it cannot. This anal-
ysis summarizes the facts of coal supply and demand in the Chinese
market, Chinese government policy, social conditions in China, and
other key factors, all of which indicate that the US coal industry, as well
as some policymakers and investors, are making a massive bet based
on a flawed set of beliefs about Chinese coal demand. Those beliefs,
stoked by an industry which desperately wants them to be true, do not
reflect the reality of China’s energy economy.

Before examining the current assumptions underpin-
ning the idea of endless Chinese coal demand, it’s worth
noting how and why that notion has been propagated
within the US. The US has the world’s largest estimated
recoverable reserves of coal. The nation produced more
than a billion short tons of coal, more than 90% of which
was used domestically to generate electricity in 2011.1 As
a result of reduced US electricity demand, low natural gas
prices, increased use of renewable energy, and citizen
activism against coal-burning power plants, domestic US
coal consumption has declined since 2007 (see Fig.1).

As US coal demand drops, so too do the profit margins
previously enjoyed by the industry. Faced with a shrink-
ing domestic market for its product, the coal industry is
proposing coal export terminals in the Pacific Northwest
to ship low-grade coal from the Powder River Basin (PRB)
in Wyoming and Montana to a supposedly stable and
profitable Asian market. Industry leaders brim with confi-
dence that Asia is a sure bet for US coal exports; they cite
high and stable coal demand, arguing that US coal can
successfully displace China’s current importers to earn
a significant share of that market. And they promise big
money for shareholders and communities if projects get
approved and financed.

With our superior operating position in the Powder River Basin
and Western Bituminous Region, we have the capability to service
growing coal demand in Asia, the world’s largest and fastest-
growing coal market. We believe this first project [Millennium]—
along with others in the pipeline—will provide Arch with more
exposure to the seaborne thermal market and will further unlock
the value inherent in our western coal assets.2

—Steven Leer (Chairman, Arch Coal)

Given the US coal industry’s pessimistic outlook for do-
mestic sales, its leaders’ optimism is self-serving; if China
is not a potential market for US coal, the US industry may
have no market for its wares. A clearer-eyed analysis of
the Chinese coal economy exposes the large risks that US
coal export projects present for investors.

2. China prodUCes nearly all of T he C oal iT C onsUMes

Historically, China has supplied virtually all of its coal
demand from domestic sources. According to estimates
from the Chinese Ministry of Land and Resource (MoLR),
China’s 170 billion tons of coal reserves account for 19%
of the global total, placing China second behind only
the United States for coal reserves. China stands as the
world’s largest coal producer, with 4 billion short tons of
coal mined in 2012, up from 3.8 billion tons in 2011 (see
Fig. 2).

Until recently—and despite rapid long-term growth in
domestic demand—China exported more coal than it
imported. But in 2009 China became a net coal importer;
by 2011 the nation had surpassed Japan as the world’s
leading coal importer; and in 2012, China imported over
300 million short tons of coal (see Fig. 3). However, even
after that rapid growth, China’s imported coal remains a
small fraction of what it burns, accounting for only 5% of
China’s total coal consumption in 2011.

So despite the massive quantities of coal China currently
burns, it is still a 95% self-dependent country for its cur-
rent use of coal. This means that increases in Chinese
coal production or transportation infrastructure could
quickly reduce the country’s current demand for imports.
The only scenario in which it would need to increase its
imports to a degree that makes US coal exports viable is if
its coal demand continues to increase at the eye-popping
growth rates experienced over the past decade.

3. China’s eConoMiC grow Th is slowing

The main force behind China’s sustained growth in coal
combustion in the past decade has been its growing econ-
omy, which has driven electricity demand in tandem. China
has the 2nd largest and most rapidly growing economy in
the world; its real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at
9.2% in 2011. With the global financial recession, however,
China’s economic growth declined to 7.8% in 2012, ac-
cording to the National Bureau of Statistics.

Those top-line figures begin to foreshadow the slowdown
of China’s economy, and some prominent corporate exec-
utives and western economists cite evidence which shows
that the real economy could be slowing even faster, as
local officials have falsified the economic data to boost the
appearance of growth.3,4 The incoming Chinese Premier Li
Keqiang uses three key indicators to measure economic
growth: electricity consumption, railway freight volume,
and bank lending. Figures from the National Bureau of Sta-
tistics show that the volume of railway freight decreased
by 0.2% in the first eight months of 2012 compared to the
same period in 2011.5 National Bureau of Energy figures
show total electricity consumption growth to be 2.9% in
September 2012, which is the lowest growth rate in the
past forty months.6

In the first eight months of 2012, the growth rates of coal
production and consumption, and rail and port transporta-
tion in China all declined compared to the same period in
2011.7 According to the China Electricity Council, invest-
ment in the coal power sector has dropped by over half
from 227.1 billion RMB ($36.4 billion USD) in 2005 to 105.4
billion ($16.9 billion USD) in 2011, and the trend is continu-
ing in 2012.8 In the first eight months of 2012, profits of 90
coal companies dropped by 14.5% compared to the same
period in 2011.9

In the short term, the Chinese economic growth rate will
keep fluctuating between 7 and 8%, with leaders drafting
plans to set the growth rate target at 7.5% in 2013.10 In the
long term, however, China’s economy is poised to continue
to slow down: analysts have pointed out that the Chinese
government is expected to deliberately control the growth
rate to prevent unsustainable booms,11 which means the
double-digit rates of GDP growth of past decades will
not continue. That economic slowing will in turn decrease
energy demand growth in China. China’s National Devel-
opment and Reform Commission (NDRC)—the government
body responsible for overseeing China’s economy—ex-
pects China’s energy demand to grow more slowly, at 4.7%
annually from 2011 to 2015 (compared to a 6.7% average
from 2006 to 2011), according to its latest version of the
China Energy Outlook from November, 2012.12

4. Coal U se in China is flaTTening oUT

China’s slowing economy is now hitting the domestic
coal consumption sector. The thermal power generation
growth rate was -0.4% in the first ten months of 2012
compared to the same period in 2011.13 One reason for
the decline is overall weak total electricity consumption
due to the economic slowdown. Another reason is China’s
growing adoption of hydroelectric power, which increased
27.1% in the same period.

In addition, industrial activity is slowing, decreasing
demand for metallurgical (met) coal. As China’s manufac-
turing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)14 has decreased
in the last three years (see Fig. 4), met coal demand has
gone down as well (see Fig.5). The iron and steel indus-
tries are also slowing down, with growth rates of 2.9%
for iron production and 2.1% for steel production respec-
tively in the first ten months of 2012 compared to 2011.15
According to the China Iron and Steel Association, 34 of
80 steelmakers recorded losses through the first eight
months of 2012, with losses totaling 21.5 billion RMB ($3.4
billion USD). This slow growth is likely to continue, since
the industry’s capacity utilization is currently only 80%.16

The weak demand from coal consumption sectors means
that China’s coal is piling up, unused, at record levels at
domestic power plants and ports. By the end of Septem-
ber 2012, the total domestic coal stock in China was 373
million tons, a 37% increase compared to the same period
in 2011.17 The coal stock in the warehouses of national key
power plants climbed up to 93.75 million tons in October,
a quantity of coal that would take 31 days for those plants
to burn through.18 The coal pileup in the major storage
port Qinhuangdao reached a record 9.46 million tons
in June 2012,19 and still remained high at over 5.8 million
tons in October of that year. These figures show that coal
demand is weakening, even if the production and sup-
ply sides of the coal economy have not yet hit the brakes
accordingly.

China plans to slow growth in coal production and con-
sumption by the end of 2015 to conserve resources and
protect the environment, according to its 12th five-year
plan for coal industry development issued by the NDRC in
March 2012.20 The government has set the target for over-
all production capacity at 4.1 billion tons, and caps coal
domestic production and consumption at 3.9 billion tons
by 2015. The latest China Energy Outlook also estimated
that coal production will not exceed 3.8 billion tons by the
end of 2015, accounting for 63% of total energy consump-
tion.21 To control coal production, the central government
is asking major production provinces to keep growth
below 4% in order to keep total coal output under 3.65mt
in 2012.22

In late October, 2012, Guangzhou (in Guangdong prov-
ince), China’s third largest city with a population of over 10
million, will limit its coal use to the 2010 level of 29 million
tons to meet new air quality standards,23 following its an-
nouncement that it will no longer approve new coal power
capacity within the city.24 Guangzhou, which consumed
over 29 million tons of coal every year and is among the
most polluted cities in China, is now on the path to cap
coal use. Other big eastern cities like Tianjin, Shanghai
Wuxi, Changzhou and Ningbo, have also put forth abso-
lute targets to limit the increase of coal consumption.25

spoTlighT: r enewable e nergy is sU rging in China

China has set ambitious targets for non-fossil fuel energy production, aiming
for 11.4% of its primary energy consumption and 30% of installed electricity
generation capacity by 2015. China now gets close to 10% of its primary energy
from non-fossil fuel sources, so it is on track to meet its targets and potentially
overshoot them. For its 12th five year plan (2011–2015), China has a wind instal-
lation target of 100 GW and an electricity generation target of 190 TWh. China
has a solar installation target of 21 GW and electricity generation of 25 TWh. By
the end of 2012, China had approximately 63 GW of wind generation and 7 GW
of solar installation. China has already passed the US in becoming the world’s
number one wind power market in 2010. The country will maintain the current
growth rate in the foreseeable future.

China has a comprehensive and substantial policy scheme to support wind and
solar development. For power developers, the country has a quota system re-
quiring a certain percentage of electrical power generation to be from renewable
energy sources. China also has a Feed-in Tariff (FiT) mechanism for both utility-
scale wind and solar power. It is very likely that the country will further develop
a FiT for decentralized solar power in 2013. This will further unlock the huge
potential of household, rooftop solar development in China. Chinese energy
regulators have increasingly realized the importance of tapping into the domestic
renewable energy market. Along with the economic restructuring, it is becoming
clear that China will benefit from its powerful renewable energy manufactur-
ing capacity. It is poised to become not just the largest producer of renewable
energy equipment, but also the largest market for it.

What are the implications of China’s surging adoption of renewable energy to the
country’s coal use? If government plans succeed, both wind and solar power
will be scaling up quickly, and could challenge coal as the dominant new-build
capacity in the Chinese electricity markets before 2020. Industry estimates for
2020 show that solar and wind could be producing 500–600 TWh a year, equal
to around 13–16% of total electricity from coal in 2011. The growing renewable
energy revolution in China is on pace to undercut the aggressive Chinese coal
demand projections upon which U.S. export hopefuls are counting.

The Xuzhou Solar Photovoltaic Power Station was connected to the grid on Decem-

ber 30, 2009. With an installed capacity of 20MW, it has 1,300 annual utilization

hours and can generate about 26 million Kw-h of electricity each year  equivalent

to savings of 7,900 tons of coal and 21,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

6. r enewable energy is on T he rise

In addition to curbing coal, the Chinese government is
also seeking to boost renewable energy development.
China’s Information Office of the State Council released
its 2012 white paper on energy policy26 in October 2012,
which said that China will actively develop hydropower,
solar and wind power generation as well as other types
of renewable energy. China plans to increase the share of
non-fossil fuels to 11.4% of primary energy consumption
and 30% of installed electricity generating capacity by the
end of 2015.

Those numbers may seem ambitious, but the Chinese
government has a proven track record of effectively sup-
porting renewable energy: its pro-renewable policies are
working and the sector is booming. China was the world’s
biggest producer of hydroelectric power in 2012, when in-
stalled hydroelectric generating capacity reached 249 GW.
China is the largest wind producer as well, with 62 GW
of installed wind capacity in 2011 (see Fig.6). In addition,
solar power capacity increased to 7 GW in 2012
(see Fig.7).27

China aims to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in pri-
mary energy consumption to 15% by the end of 2020, and
has issued policies to boost renewable energy develop-
ment so that it achieves that goal. In the new 2012 edition
of China’s energy policy white paper,30 China aims to
increase wind power capacity to 100 GW and solar by an
astounding seven-fold to 21 GW by the end of 2015, and
plans to add 10GW of new installed solar power capac-
ity in 2013.31 China reached 7GW of installed solar by the
end of 2012, which means the target may be exceeded or
adjusted to a higher one.

In October 2012, the State Grid Corporation of China
stated that solar PV installations of less than 6 MW will get
grid access in China, paving the way for rooftop solar to
become a sizable and growing part of China’s renewable
energy portfolio.32

beCoMing M ore aware of iTs iMpaCTs
on healTh and waTer

The rising public concern for coal’s environmental and
health impacts is starting to play a large role in restrict-
ing coal demand in China, and the air pollution crisis in
Beijing in early 2013 indicates that these concerns are
likely to increase. According to the US Embassy, Beijing’s
readings for PM2.5 pollution (dangerous particles that
cause heart and lung damage) surged to 886 µg/m3 on
January 12,33 more than double the US EPA’s highest
grading of “hazardous”. Burning coal is a leading cause of
fine particulate pollution (PM2.5), and the Chinese public
is becoming increasingly vocal in its demand for solutions.

China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection released
new national air pollution standards for thermal power
plants that took effect in 2012.34 This new standard
will bring Chinese power plant regulations in line with
developed world standards, and according to a compari-
son by the World Resources Institute,35 some are even
stricter than US or EU standards. Additionally, steady
public outcry has forced several provincial governments
to monitor and release data known as PM2.5 about
particulate matter that causes smog and public health
crises.36,37,38,39 Those governments are following a require-
ment from the Ministry of Environmental Protection’s new
national air pollution standards.40 In addition to the new
air quality standard approved in February 2012, the State
Council released a 12th five year plan related to air quality
in October to cut harmful air particles, especially PM2.5
in the air.41 The regional plan focuses on eastern coastal
provinces in China which are major users and importers
of coal, and will put significant pressure on coal use in
these areas.

Water scarcity is worsening due to global climate change
in China, where about half of coal reserves are located
in water-scarce regions. Research from the Institute of
Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences shows at least 10 billion
cubic meters of water—equivalent to about one sixth of
the annual total water volume of the Yellow River—will
be consumed by 16 new power plants in China in 2015,
triggering severe water crises in the country’s arid
Northwest.42 Water shortages will cause parts of China
to choose between water for drinking and agriculture or
coal-fired power plants, and will be another reason for
Chinese officials to reduce the country’s reliance on coal
and shift investments to renewable energy.

Another important factor is that Chinese residents
are becoming increasingly vocal about environmental
problems. Protests and local unrest against industry
pollution are becoming pervasive around the country,
with many cases related to coal-fired power plants. Over
one thousand residents of Yinggehai on China’s Hainan
Island protested for several days in October, 2012 against
the construction of a coal-fired power plant in the local
town.43 Police suppressed those demonstrations, but
similar ones in December 2011 in Guangdong province
resulted in the suspension of a coal-fired power plant
expansion project.44 Increased public resistance and
protests against polluters has forced the Chinese State
Council (equivalent to the US Cabinet) to order that all
major industrial projects must pass a “social risk assess-
ment” before beginning, as announced in November
2012 by the Environment Minister during the 18th party
congress, the once-per-decade meeting of power transi-
tion in the Chinese leadership.45 The Environment Minister
also said that there will be increased transparency and
public involvement in decisions regarding large projects
with high potential environmental impact.

CUrTails Coal Use in e asTern China

One of the most visible effects of coal use in China is the air
pollution, especially the PM2.5 pollution (fine particles with a
diameter of 2.5 microns or less), which creates the infamous
haze days in eastern Chinese industrial cities. Coal use in these
biggest eastern cities, which still are the main coal users in the
country, contributes up to 40% of PM2.5 pollution. Typical pollu-
tion levels in Chinese cities are up to 4 times higher than World
Health Organization targets; at their worst they can be 5–10
times worse than US city pollution episodes. Research shows
that every year thousands of Chinese are dying prematurely
in these cities due to PM2.5 pollution. Those revelations have
sowed anger in a Chinese culture that traditionally holds great
value on long life, and the ability to enjoy active old ages with
grandchildren and friends.

What do these new PM2.5 changes mean for coal use in China?
PM2.5 is costly, difficult to remove from the coal combustion
process, and travels long distances, up to hundreds of miles.
This means that pollution levels are difficult to control by techni-
cal means of filtering or by moving coal-fired power plants
outside of big cities. The Chinese government therefore faces a
difficult choice: It can either introduce overall limits on coal use,
as it recently outlined in its 12th five year plan for major Eastern
industrial bases; or it can face increasing dissatisfaction from
the emerging and educated middle class, as it starts to see air
pollution and related coal use as an obstacle to quality of life
improvements in China. The introduction of pilot carbon trading,
set mostly for climate reasons, indicates that the government
sees controlling coal use as the way to go. More stringent con-
trols on coal use and public interest in decreasing air pollution
will be major constraints on the growth of coal use in eastern
provinces. Since these provinces are major importers of coal,
this will have a capping effect on coal imports as well.

But industrialization has brought more than pollution to the most
populous cities in China. Now, a relatively wealthy and growing
Chinese urban middle-class is increasingly becoming interested
in quality of life issues, including their families’ health and a
healthy environment for spending their leisure time. Accord-
ing to the U.S. Embassy, Beijing’s readings for PM2.5 pollution
(dangerous particles that cause heart and lung damage) surged
to 886 µg/m3 on January 12, more than double the US EPA’s
highest grading of “hazardous”. Burning coal is a leading cause
of PM2.5 pollution, discussion and demand for solutions on
the massive Chinese online social network Weibo erupted to a
level where even the Chinese government was forced to react.
In February 2012, the Chinese government agreed to introduce
relatively strict targets for reducing PM2.5 pollution in the major
cities by 40–50% by 2016. Since then, cities like Beijing have
been disclosing PM2.5 levels, and more cities are setting a limit
to their coal use. Guangzhou recently decided to cap its coal
use to 2010 levels until 2016. But it is difficult for cities to suc-
ceed without larger regional cooperation. In November, 2012,
the central government introduced a first-ever 12th five year plan
for air quality in China, setting targets for neighboring regions
ranging from 5 to 15% reduction of overall PM2.5 levels. Those
targets will have the effect of capping coal use regionally as
well. And, from the first day of 2013, 74 cities of China started
disclosing PM2.5 levels, with the data accessibe to the public.

8. UnsTable asian de Mand has sUnk U s
Coal exporT proposals in T he pasT

The idea of exporting coal from the US West Coast is not
a new one, and its history is littered with failures that prove
that Asian markets present institutional challenges for
importing US coal. In the early 1980s, the Port of Portland
and investors spent $25 million building a coal export ter-
minal. Two years into construction, the project failed when
the Asian market proved unstable and its demand for
coal turned out to be far weaker than investors assumed.
Then, in the early 1990s, coal giant Peabody—one of the
companies leading the current push for Pacific Northwest
export projects—led a group of investors proposing a new
coal export terminal for the Port of Los Angeles.

When coal dust caused two fires, the facility closed six
years after it opened, also citing the weaker than expected
Asian market for coal.46

In both those cases, the US coal industry claimed with
confidence that China would be a stable and profitable
market for US PRB coal exports, and the industry is mak-
ing those claims just as boldly today about the proposed
Pacific Northwest export terminals.

More recently, fickle Chinese demand of metallurgical coal
cost US coal producers who staked their operations on
the Chinese market.47 As the Wall Street Journal reported
in September 2012, “Slowing growth in China is taking a
brutal toll on Appalachian coal mines and coal towns.” The
Journal continues:

“When someone had coal to move, China was your big
box store,” said Ernie Thrasher, chief executive of XCoal
Energy & Resources, a major US marketer of such coal to
Asia. This year, “the switch went off.”

While many have blamed the downturn in the US coal
industry on cheap natural gas supplanting coal and
tougher environmental regulations, the slide in metal-
lurgical coal demand has been equally devastating. Coal
companies were caught flat-footed after ramping up
production last year with the expectation that steep prices
would cover their rising costs, despite coal’s past cyclical-
ity. Instead, demand in China began to falter just as
Australian metallurgical coal production—interrupted
by floods last year—surged back into the market.48

Chinese demand for met coal to make steel has slowed,
and US coal operations in Appalachia are now paying the
price for their risky bet on continued Chinese demand.

The Black Thunder Coal Mine in the Powder River Basin is one of the world’s

largest mines. As coal demand drops in the US, coal mining companies are

seeking new markets abroad.

While short-, mid-, and long-term trends signal a much
weaker Chinese coal import market than the one de-
scribed by US export hopefuls, the country will likely
continue to import coal to a degree. However, other coun-
tries are better suited to continue to capture that existing
market than the US. The top exporters of coal to China
are Indonesia, Australia, Mongolia and Russia; together
they accounted for 75% of total imports in 2012 (see Fig.8).
China imported 9.32 million tons from the US in 2012 for
only 3.2% of its total imports. Compared to other pre-po-
sitioned coal exporters, the US is the newcomer to China’s
thermal coal market, with most of its competitors owning
a distinct geographical advantage.

tors in Australia are realizing that the Chinese market for
coal is drying up, and decreasing demand from China is
bringing the mining boom to an end.51

Both Indonesia and Australia have been hit by China’s
weakened coal demand, and see that coal exports to
China are a poor long-term investment. US investors and
policymakers would be wise to join them in recogniz-
ing that Chinese coal demand is fickle, and large capital
investments in coal export projects are a potential boon-
doggle.

Indonesia is the world’s largest thermal coal exporter, pro-
viding about 41% of China’s coal imports. Indonesia has
boosted its coal production rapidly, with coal production
in 2011 having quintupled to 437 million short tons since
2000. In 2010, Indonesia exported over 85% of its coal
(see Fig. 9). In what could be a cautionary tale to US ex-
port hopefuls, the slowdown in China’s economic growth
has hit Indonesia’s coal sector hard, forcing producers
to reduce output and slash costs: coal exports to China
slumped 16% from 2011 in July 2012.49

Australia is the world’s most prolific exporter of coal over-
all, and the 2nd largest exporter to China following Indo-
nesia. Australia produced over 463 million short tons of
coal in 2010, an increase of 37% compared to 2000, and
in 2010 Australia exported over 328 million short tons that
accounted for 71% of its production (see Fig.10). With such
a reliance on exports, Australian economists have warned
that weakening Chinese demand is leaving shareholders
exposed.50 Growing numbers of policymakers and inves-

Investors and policymakers considering supporting coal
export projects should proceed with great caution given
the sluggish projections for China’s economic growth and
coal consumption.

Chinese economic growth is not as promising as it was
in past decades, and China has not been immune to the
effects of the global economic recession. There is no
doubt that China will continue to rely on coal for its energy
needs in the short term, even amid more sluggish eco-
nomic growth. But the long-term trend in China’s energy
economy is also quite clear: The country is deliberately,
and quite effectively, decoupling its economic growth
from coal such that future economic growth may not
manifest in increased coal consumption. The results of
this decoupling are already present: A rapid expansion in
hydroelectricity, wind, and solar has pushed down coal’s
share of energy production from 85% to 73%,52 and this
trend will continue. In its “China power”53 report, HSBC
expects China to need less new generation capacity by
2015 than planned because of its maturing economy and
more efficient use of existing capacity.

International pressure on China to address climate change
and domestic concerns about air pollution and the envi-
ronmental and safety record of coal are joining to push
China to continue boosting renewable energy develop-
ment, which it is already proving it can do successfully.

These challenges join the hurdles—including powerful
local resistance in the Pacific Northwest—that the US coal
industry has already encountered in its attempt to export
coal to China. Assuming Chinese coal demand continues
to weaken and that it sticks to its policies to curb coal use
and increase renewable investment, the Chinese market
for US coal exports may dry up before major new US coal
shipments ever reach its ports.

Hopeful exporters of Powder River Basin thermal coal—as
well as their investors and the communities considering
controversial terminal projects—are on a path to learn the
same painful lessons as those who failed in earlier coal
export schemes.

While the US coal industry declares China a safe haven
from an unfriendly US coal market, the facts show that
the same factors that are causing coal to be phased out
of the US market—sluggish economic growth, a rapidly
developing renewable energy sector, government policies
and social opposition to coal—are conspiring to make
coal imports economically unviable in the Chinese market
as well. US investors and policymakers would do well to
examine those market conditions with a wary eye, rather
than buying into the false optimism being peddled by a
desperate US coal industry.
