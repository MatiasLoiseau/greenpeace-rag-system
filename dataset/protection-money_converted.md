INDONESIA’S lOW-CARBON
DEvElOPmENT GOAlS NEED NOT
DEPEND ON DEfORESTATION

Policy documents from Indonesia’s Ministries of
Forestry, Agriculture and Energy reveal planned
expansion in pulp, palm, agriculture, biofuel
and coal sectors that could bring an additional
~63 million ha of land into production by 2030.
This would equate to all available land outside
Protection and Conservation zones that is not
already under identified economic use.

Ministry of Forestry data show that the area
earmarked for expansion by these sectors includes
40% of Indonesia’s forest area, some 37 million
ha – an area the size of Norway and Denmark
combined;  80% of Indonesia’s peatland, some
16 million ha; and 50% of forested orang-utan
habitat. Government figures suggest the forest
and peatland carbon at risk amounts to 38GtC –
four years’ worth of global greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions.

land is needed to achieve government targets for
expansion in these sectors.

Figures used consistently within Ministry of
Forestry and other government documents
show that existing industry-held landbanks could
accommodate a fourfold increase in pulpwood
plantation productivity, as is a doubling in palm oil
productivity. A draft version of Indonesia’s REDD
strategy indicates that in the mid-term, no further
land area is needed for agriculture.

This demonstrates that, appropriately supported
through government policy and regulation,
an economically prosperous low-carbon
development path for Indonesia does not need
to come at the expense of its natural forests
and peatlands. International finance for forest
protection therefore advances President SBY’s
low-carbon development agenda, and will
incentivise industry best-practice, improved
governance, and improvements in community
agricultural practice and yields.

Indonesia’s GHG abatement plan identifies the
pulp, palm and agriculture sectors as the lead
drivers of future deforestation – potentially
responsible for the loss of 28 million ha of forest
(75% of forest within areas zoned for sector
expansion) by 2030.

However, industry statements and government
policy documents indicate that – with improved
productivity as a primary objective – no additional

Indonesia’s own data from the National Council on
Climate Change (DNPI) position it as the world’s
third largest GHG polluter; it attributes some 85%
of these emissions to land use – almost entirely
from deforestation and peatland degradation.The
Norwegian government has pledged $1 billion to a
scheme designed to reduce deforestation and GHG
emissions in Indonesia. Part of this deal includes
a two-year moratorium on allocation of further
peatlands and natural forests for sector expansion.

The Sinar Mas group is Indonesia’s largest pulp and
palm oil producer. The pulp division has stated that
a moratorium provides an opportunity for industry
and government to take stock, improve practice
and come up with new regulations. The head of the
palm oil division has stated that the sector needs
virtually no more land to meet production targets.

However, despite the support for a low-carbon
development model founded on a moratorium,
better regulation and improved productivity,
there is a huge risk that an alternative, high-
carbon expansion model pushed by some within
government and industry will be adopted.
Such a model does not challenge the excesses
of current industry practice or the admitted
corruption within the forestry sector. For instance,
the Ministry of Forestry has explicitly sought
international climate funding to support pulp and
palm oil expansion, and ‘enhancing forest carbon
stocks through [timber plantations] and forest
restoration’.  Some Officials within the Ministry of
Forestry have stated that a moratorium on forest
clearance would damage the economy, and have
demanded a renegotiation of the Norway deal.

Proponents of this high-carbon model seek
to rebrand the industrial activities driving
deforestation as ‘rehabilitation of degraded’ lands.
In practice, given weak definitions of ‘forests’ and
‘degraded lands’ or other key terms, this amounts
to continued clearance of natural forests and
peatlands. Consequently, international money
designed to support protection of Indonesia’s

forests and peatlands could end up being used
to support their destruction. However the act
is termed, it amounts to the same thing: natural
forest loss, high emissions and poor industry
practice.

necessity of doing its part to face the urgent
global challenge of combating climate change. As a
developing country, and an archipelago of 17,000
islands, our people face the brunt of impact of
climate change.’

While current proposals from certain officials in
Indonesian ministries support the status quo,
such a moratorium would create an incentive for
industry to dramatically increase productivity
within existing plantation areas.

That is not a model of development anyone should
champion.

The cost of inaction – or worse, false accounting
– to stop deforestation and peatland degradation
will be climate change, biodiversity loss, and the
derailing of genuine low-carbon development for
the people of Indonesia.

The following elements are key to setting Indonesia
on a truly low-carbon development pathway: (a) a
clear vision on what development is necessary and
desired; (b) a policy to make this a cross-cutting
priority, integrating climate change, biodiversity
protection and the economy; (c) strong governance
to ensure implementation; (d) industry leadership
and initiative to achieve world-class production
standards; and (e) international financial support for
forest protection and clean development.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has

the need for action: ‘Indonesia understands the

Commendably, President SBY seeks to lead
global efforts to reduce GHG emissions and
shift to a low-carbon development model.
With international support, he has pledged
dramatic cuts to national GHG emissions over
the next decade.

Critically, such a moratorium would also provide
the Indonesian government with the necessary
opening to overhaul the land allocation process
to ensure protection of ecological, biodiversity,
social, legal and economic values. It would indeed
be ‘a new development pathway’.

The Norwegian government’s pledge of $1
billion aids President SBY’s progressive agenda
and ambition to end deforestation.The deal
includes a two-year moratorium on allocation of
further peatlands and natural forests for sector
expansion, as well as a review of the land held by
companies in existing concessions.

The funds are meant to support natural forest
protection, thereby benefiting ecosystem
services, wildlife and the long-term economic
and cultural interests of Indonesia’s forest
communities.

A strong moratorium is a critical step toward
implementing a meaningful low-carbon
development plan. Greenpeace is calling for
immediate protection of all peatlands and a
temporary halt on all further natural forest
clearance not only in new areas, as currently
planned, but also existing concession areas.

REAl lOW-CARBON DEvElOPmENT

Critical to determining the long-term
development pathway Indonesia will follow are
meaningful definitions and transparent maps of
the land available for low-carbon development.
The joint Indonesia National Development Planning
Agency (BAPPENAS)–UN-REDD October 2010
draft National REDD+ Strategy does establish a
technical carbon threshold for land suitable for
low-carbon development, as well as land meriting
conservation purely for its carbon storage
potential. These carbon criteria should translate
into policies for low-carbon development based
on full peatland and forest protection.

Ministry of Forestry and other data sets used
by the Indonesian government in developing
its abatement plans suggest that the potential
available area of low-carbon land represents at
most 14 million ha.

In order for Indonesia to meet its express
ambitions not to be ‘locked into a growth model
that is unsustainable for our, and the world’s,
environment’ it is clear that sectors such as pulp
and palm oil must ‘shift to a less carbon-intensive
development model’.

Surprisingly, for a national GHG abatement plan
that seeks to set Indonesia on a ‘low-carbon
development pathway’, the cost of low-carbon
development in line with clear social, economic
and environmental objectives is not estimated.
Yet, industry statements and the government’s
own figures used within its abatement plans show
that – given industry leadership on productivity
and strong government regulation – the pulp and
palm oil sectors need no further land in order to
meet their production objectives.

•  Palm oil yield assumption: doubling of yield
on new plantations and the ones undergoing
replanting; additional area needs: none.

•  Pulp plantation yield assumption: fourfold
increase in yield; additional area needs: none.

Equally, the 2010 draft of Indonesia’s REDD strategy
concedes that additional land for agriculture is also
unnecessary in the mid-term. Thus, in addition to
directing REDD financing to the peoples responsible
for protecting natural forests, what is needed
to fully protect Indonesia’s natural forests and
peatlands is for the leading drivers of deforestation
to commit themselves to the moratorium, planting

Various ministries’ economic development plans
for big industry are set to bring an additional ~63
million ha into production by 2030:

•  Timber plantations including pulpwood:

28 million ha

•  Estate crops including oil palm:

9 million ha (total land-use demand not
forecast)

•  Agriculture: 13 million ha of forested land (total

land-use demand not forecast)

•  The loss of 40% of Indonesia’s remaining

natural forest, some 37 million ha – an area
the size of Norway and Denmark combined.
Government figures suggest the forests in
this area contain ~10Gt of carbon.

•  The loss of half of all remaining forested

orang-utan habitat.

•  The degradation of nearly 80% of Indonesia’s
carbon-rich peatlands. Government figures
suggest the peatlands in the areas at risk
contain ~28Gt of carbon.

•  A total carbon liability from expansion of

38GtC, equivalent to more than four times
2005 global GHG emissions.

•  Biofuel plantations including palm oil:

9 million ha

•  mining: 4 million ha within the Forest Estate

(total land-use demand not forecast)

This is roughly equivalent to all the currently
undeveloped land in Indonesia, including
extensive forest areas outside zoned
protection and conservation forest areas. This
area would equate to at least four times the
area of low-carbon land (which Ministry of

More than half the planned forest loss would be
through expansion of the pulp and palm oil sectors.
The government plans for a trebling of pulp and
paper production by 2025 and a doubling of palm
oil production by 2020, with additional expansion
targets for biofuel production.

Indonesia’s pulp mills cannot meet current
fibre needs through existing plantations and
continue to rely on deforestation. Plantation
expansion in Indonesia’s pulp and oil palm sectors
accounts for more than half of future projected

deforestation. Current operations in these sectors
are typified by poor governance – with apparent
widespread disregard for regulations on permits,
environmental impact assessments and protection
of deep peatland – poor land management, and
poor productivity.

However, Indonesia’s GHG abatement plans seek
international funding to support the expansion
of the pulp and palm oil sectors in the name of
tackling climate change. For instance, as part of a
‘green growth’ strategy, abatement plans suggest
the International Finance Corporation (IFC – part
of the World Bank) fund two pulp mills, massively
increasing current capacity. The Industry Minister
has called for a rapid doubling of production and
export from the pulp sector, and the Ministry of
Forestry is reportedly considering mill applications
that would make this ambition a reality. The
World Bank, through the Clean Technology Fund,
has already leveraged more than $3 billion for
Indonesia, with the expanding pulp sector identified
as an important candidate for this support.

In terms of REDD+ funding and climate mitigation,
these expansion ambitions could have a significant
negative impact on Indonesia’s forests and
peatlands. Indonesia’s GHG abatement plans
improperly suggest that plantations have a role
to play in ‘rehabilitation’ of ‘degraded’, ‘critical’,
‘idle’ or ‘unproductive’ land, and that supporting
‘afforestation/reforestation’ (planting trees) is
a cheaper option than ‘avoiding deforestation’
(cutting trees down). While it may be cheaper (or

less challenging to industry status quo) to call the
replacement of natural forests with plantations
‘rehabilitation’ rather than ‘deforestation’, it
amounts to the same thing.

Consequently, international REDD funds
earmarked for forest protection may actually be
used to subsidise their destruction, with significant
climate, wildlife and social costs.

The government’s own figures show that
timber and estate crop plantations (such as oil
palm) hold a fraction of the carbon of even the
most heavily degraded natural forests. Further,
they do not adequately provide the essential
ecosystem services given by natural forests,
sustain freshwater cycles and other benefits for
local communities, nor harbour the same degree
of biodiversity. Thus, replacing forests with
plantations can never be a part of genuine low-
carbon development.

Coupled with an absence of political or institutional
accountability, and poor definitions of land
available for low-carbon development in support
of REDD objectives, Indonesia’s GHG abatement
plans may create perverse incentives to clear
forests and peatlands, create opportunities for
corruption, lead to inequitable distribution of
benefits, and actually drive an increase in GHG
emissions. The losers would be Indonesia’s forest
communities and vulnerable people who depend
on the ecosytem services and adaptation benefits
provided by natural forests.

CORRuPTION IN THE fORESTY
SECTOR: WIll ‘PROTECTION mONEY’
fuND INCREASING GHG EmISSIONS?

  -  The Ministry plans for 33 million ha of timber
plantations to be established. It describes
this as ‘carbon sink enhancement’.

The Ministry of Forestry has a history of
corruption and corrupt policies. For example,
Ernst & Young found that, over a five-year
period, more than $5 billion was lost from a
fund specifically designed for reforestation
and rehabilitation of ‘degraded’ forest lands.
Perversely, the Reforestion Fund itself
incentivised mismanagement of forests by
allowing concessionaires to access funds to
convert to plantations areas they had deforested
and degraded. Further, over one third of the area
for which funding was dispersed has never
 been planted.

The objectives and approach of the Reforestation
Fund have resonant echoes with Indonesia’s
current GHG abatement plans for the following
interrelated reasons:

•  The Ministry of Forestry is a key architect of

Indonesia’s GHG abatement plans.

•  By the Ministry’s own admission, corruption

within the forestry sector is severe.

•  The Ministry sees advancing industry interests
as its primary objective, with GHG emissions
mitigation activity to be ‘integrated’ into
existing forestry sector plans for plantation
establishment.

•  Thus, GHG abatement strategies seek to

redefine or rebrand existing industry activities
as GHG emissions-mitigation activities. For
example:

This assumes (a) that plantations
permanently sequester significant amounts
of carbon (they do not); and (b) that there is
33 million ha of low-carbon land available for
this activity (there is not).

  -  Extensive areas of natural forest that hold
considerable carbon and biodiversity value
are categorised as ‘degraded’, ‘unproductive’,
‘idle’ or ‘critical’ and in need of ‘rehabilitation’.
Indonesia’s GHG abatement plans seek
international funds to finance the ‘forest
rehabilitation’ of these ‘degraded’ forests,
and see plantations as the quickest, cheapest
means of achieving this rehabilitation.

The implication is that replacing forests with
plantations achieves something positive for the
climate, biodiversity, local communities, and
indeed, low-carbon development goals. In reality,
such plans would lead to substantial loss of natural
forest and peatland carbon, as well as driving the
destruction of wildlife habitat and forests with
important economic and other social values to
local communities.

end deforestation and peatland degradation and

With the support of the global community,
Indonesia has a window of opportunity
to shift to a less carbon-intensive
development model. Without early action,
Indonesia may become locked into a
growth model […] that is unsustainable
for our, and the world’s, environment.

DNPi, august 2010

Current international climate commitments are
inadequate, potentially leaving the world on
course for a 4ºC rise in average temperature
by the end of the century.1 According to the
International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
such a rise carries with it significant ecosystem,
biodiversity and social threats.2

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would need
to have peaked no later than 2015 in order for
the world to have the best chance of limiting
global warming to less than 2ºC.3

According to the DNPI, some 85% of Indonesia’s
GHG emissions relate to land use – almost
entirely from deforestation and degradation
(1,006MtCO2 gross, 760MtCO2 net) and
peatland degradation and fire (850MtCO2).6
The DNPI attributes over half of probable future
deforestation to expansion from the pulp and palm
oil sectors. As DNPI reports concede, plantation
operations are typified by extensive deforestation,
poor plantation establishment rates and poor
productivity relative to global competitors and
industry-claimed potential.7

Deforestation, including emissions from deforested
peatlands, is responsible for about one-fifth of
GHG emissions,4 so ending deforestation is critical
to ensuring a rapid cut in GHG emissions, in order to
provide time for the world to shift to a low-carbon
development pathway.

Within Indonesia, President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono and progressive elements within
government are striving to move away from the
low-productivity, deforestation-led model of
industrial expansion toward a higher-value, low-
carbon development model.

Ending deforestation and peatland degradation in
Indonesia is critical to achieving rapid, significant
global GHG emissions cuts. By their own estimates,
China and the USA are the world’s top two GHG
emitters, largely from fossil fuel-related industries;
figures presented by Indonesia’s National Climate
Change Council (DNPI) position Indonesia as the
world’s third largest GHG emitter, largely as a result
of deforestation-related emissions.5

The DNPI presentation of Indonesia’s 2010
GHG abatement plan describes this as ‘a green
growth plan’ for the nation.8 The goal is to ‘ensure
reductions in carbon emissions support rather
than undermine our national development goals
and our long-term efforts to improve the standard
of living for all Indonesians’.9 In partnership with
the DNPI, three provinces – Central Kalimantan,
East Kalimantan and Jambi – have developed

‘green growth strategies’, identifying how to
‘move to higher value-added activities and new
low-carbon sectors so that future growth leaves a
smaller carbon footprint’.10

emissions and shift destructive forest activities
to ‘degraded’ lands. The terms of this deal include
a two-year moratorium on the issuance of new
concessions on peatland and forests.12

Indonesia’s motivation is both global and based on
self-interest, given the threat that climate change
poses to the country: ‘Even if all developed
countries reduced their emissions to 1990 levels
(as targeted under the Kyoto Protocol), this would
not be enough to avert serious climate change
[…]. Indonesia understands this impasse. It has
decided to take action.’11

There is considerable international support for
action to tackle the drivers of deforestation
and peatland degradation, while supporting
low-carbon development models. Although
the international community failed to reach a
multilateral agreement to tackle climate change
in Copenhagen in 2009, there is significant
donor and agency money available for Reducing
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation (REDD+) and Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) pilot projects, as well as
initiatives to help develop and implement the
national GHG emissions reduction strategy. In
May 2010, Norway pledged $1 billion to support
Indonesia’s efforts to reduce deforestation

Within these national and international
initiatives, the low-carbon development
imperative is discernible: strategies to mitigate
GHG emissions associated with the pulp and
palm oil sectors must incentivise the protection
of Indonesia’s remaining natural forests and
peatlands. As a result, the pulp and palm oil
sectors must support a strong moratorium
and increase productivity within their existing
plantation areas. Additional expansion must
be confined to lands with little carbon or other
conservation or social values.

The ambition is honourable, and the rhetoric
of large-scale GHG emissions reductions
impressive. The reality behind the headline
numbers needs scrutiny, however, in order to
understand the risks for Indonesia’s natural
forests and low-carbon development ambitions
caused by an institutional reticence within
industry and elements of the Indonesian
government to genuinely tackle the business-
as-usual (BAU) expansion plans of the pulp and
palm oil sectors.

Greenpeace has undertaken an
assessment of official government
submissions to the UNFCCC, internal
Ministry of Forestry documents and
other relevent government and industry
reports13 to address the following
questions:

•  Does Indonesia have a low-carbon

development plan with clear social and
environmental objectives?

•  Does Indonesia’s GHG emissions reduction
plan incentivise low-carbon development or
reward high-carbon options?

•  Does Indonesia’s GHG emissions reduction
plan tackle BAU operations of the key
drivers of deforestation – the pulp and
palm sectors – and incentivise improved
productivity?

•  Does Indonesia’s GHG emissions reduction
plan prioritise natural forest protection over
plantation establishment?

THE fINDINGS:

Without a shift to a ‘new development
pathway’,14 Indonesia’s priority
development plans for key sectors are set
to increase its deforestation rate, leaving
all areas outside Protected/ Conservation
forest zones logged out within 20 years.

•  Government development priorities for

pulp and other wood-processing, palm oil,
agriculture and bioenergy sectors suggest
that a total of about 63 million ha of new
development is planned within these sectors
by 2030. This roughly corresponds to the
area of land outside Protected/Conservation
forest zones without current identified
economic activity.

•  These plans would lead to the loss of
40% of Indonesia’s remaining natural
forest, some 37 million ha – an area the
combined size of Norway and Denmark.15
Government figures suggest the forests
in this area contain around 10Gt of
carbon.16

•  Does Indonesia’s GHG emissions reduction plan
prioritise protecting peatlands over mitigating
the rate of emissions?

•  These plans would lead to the loss of half of all
remaining forested orang-utan habitat.17

•  Does Indonesia’s GHG emissions reduction
plan use a credible and proven methodology
for monitoring deforestation rates and
calculating emissions?

•  What is the definition of ‘degraded’ land
proposed for REDD+ initiatives, and does
it include carbon, ecological, biodiversity,
governance and social metrics?

•  These plans would lead to the degradation
of nearly 80% of Indonesia’s carbon-rich
peatlands. Government figures suggest the
peatlands in the areas at risk contain around
28Gt of carbon.18

•  The total carbon at risk from development is
38GtC, equivalent to more than four times
2005 global GHG emissions.19

The chief beneficiaries of Indonesia’s
GHG emissions abatement plan, and
international funds to support its
implementation, would be the pulp and
palm oil sectors, the primary industrial
drivers of natural forest loss. Historically,
funds destined to ‘reforest’ ‘degraded’ land
have perversely incentivised deforestation
and provided opportunity for corruption.
Auditors Ernst and Young found that,
under Ministry of Forestry administration,
the Reforestation Fund lost more than $5
billion over a five-year period.20

Various plans within Indonesian ministries
and industry sectors propose inconsistent
and specious methodologies to quantify the
role of plantations in reducing deforestation
and GHG emissions.

If the proposed moratorium fails to halt
considerable forest and peatland loss within
current concession areas, the proposed weak
definitions of ‘degraded’ land mean that many
millions of hectares of carbon-rich peatland and
forest may also be unprotected by this two-
year suspension.

The analysis exposes the strong risk that, at
best, Norway’s $1 billion may fail to support
low-carbon development or stop defor
estation; at worst, it may support a huge
accounting fraud, paying for increased GHG
emissions in Indonesia.

The following measures are critical to ensuring
that the international donor community
supports forest protection and Indonesia’s shift
to a low-carbon development pathway:

1.  A comprehensive moratorium on

deforestation and peatland development
covering existing as well as new
concession areas.

  •  This would push industry to improve

productivity within existing plantation areas,
and plant areas within existing concessions
that have already been cleared.

  •  This would buy time for the Indonesian

government to overhaul land-use planning
and concession allocations.

2.  A credible definition for genuinely
degraded lands for low-carbon
development with negligible social or
environmental conservation value.

  •  Indonesia’s October 2010 draft National
REDD+ Strategy provides the beginning
of a technical baseline definition for land
available for low-carbon development
and forest land for carbon conservation.
Logically interpreted into government
policy, this baseline should translate to zero
deforestation and full peatland protection.

3.  Strong incentives for increases in pulp and
oil palm productivity within plantations,
and stronger governance measures.

  •  Government and industry’s own

figures suggest potential to increase
productivity fourfold within the pulp
sector and nearly twofold within the
palm sector. This indicates that little
or no additional land is needed for
expansion within these sectors.

As a result of their deforestation-related emissions,
government data position Indonesia and Brazil as the
world’s third and fourth largest GHG emitting countries,
surpassed only by China and the United States. 21

According to recent estimates published by the
Brazilian and Indonesian governments, these countries
were each responsible for around 5% of global GHG
emissions in 2005.22 While Brazil estimates that 60%
of its emissions (1.2GtCO2) come from deforestation,23
Indonesia estimates that 85% of its declared net
emissions come from land use, the vast majority
from deforestation and peatland destruction (which
represent 1.87GtCO2 of gross GHG emissions).24

In international meetings on tackling climate change,
both the Brazilian and Indonesian presidents have
presented themselves as global leaders on action to cut
GHG emissions from deforestation. 25

The goals set out in this [National Climate
Change Plan] are audacious, if compared with
other countries. The potential of this Plan to

gases is one of the largest – if not the largest –
among all nations. Brazilian President Lula da silva, 2008

The largest single source of gHg emissions
in brazil is amazon deforestation,26 and
the key drivers have been cattle ranching27
and soya production.28 Within the last four
years, greenpeace has initiated industry
agreements to end the role of these sectors
in driving forest loss in the amazon.29 With
the support of civil society, it is to be hoped
that government action will consolidate
these gains, backing them with regulation
and improved monitoring, in order to ensure
that other drivers do not step into the breach.
Critical to such progress is the provision of
maps of rural properties by the private sector
– already a legal requirement. Providing
precise geographical coordinates and property
boundaries, and indicating areas of use
and non-use, these maps will be crucial to
improving government’s monitoring capacity.

at the 2008 international climate summit in
Poznàn, pressured by civil society, President
lula da Silva presented the brazilian national
Climate Change Plan,30 which has been
updated and strengthened in 2010.31 This
plan could be more ambitious, but brazil
claims will prevent the emission of nearly
5gtCo2,32 will be achieved primarily through
a drastic reduction in the gross rate of
amazon deforestation:33 the reduction
target is from 1.9 million ha/yr in the 1999–
2005 period to 0.4 million ha/yr by 2020,34
a reduction of 80%. a key component of this
initiative was the creation of the amazon

Fund,35 which has a multi-stakeholder
steering committee and provides for
transparent and free publication of data and
independent external auditing of results.

The proposal looks credible. For more than
two decades, the brazilian Ministry of Science
and Technology has been using satellite
imagery to monitor annual rates of natural
forest loss in the amazon. The average
historical deforestation rate has been used to
establish a baseline, rather than projections of
future pressures on the forest. The brazilian
government has set intermediate targets to
measure actual reductions in the annual rates
of deforestation. Technology continues to
advance, and brazil now also monitors changes
in amazon forest cover in ‘near real’ time. The
data are publicly available for independent
scrutiny; non-governmental organisations
(ngos) and scientific institutions have
access to satellite images and support the
government by providing analysis of both the
data and the drivers of deforestation.

Thus, brazil is showing  that it has recognised
the environmental and social imperatives to
protect its remaining natural forests, and it
has adopted a simple and transparent means
of measuring its success or failure in achieving
that goal. it has an absolute target of reducing
natural forest loss and monitors its current
gross deforestation rates against historical
data as an easy proxy for carbon emissions.

Although such a reduction of deforestation in
the Amazon represents an ambitious target, in
recent years the country has demonstrated its
ability to reach it. With successive decreases
in yearly deforestation rates of the Amazon
forest achieved by REDD policies between 2005
and 2009, Brazil is close to meeting the target
established for the first five years (2006–2010).
Brazilian Ministry of the Environment, 2010

Brazilian government strategy for reducing
deforestation has sound foundations:
1.  Clear targets to reduce deforestation by 2020

against an established baseline.

2.  Near real-time monitoring of natural forest

loss and publicly available data.

3. Market support for strategy.

In September 2009, Indonesian President
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono announced
Indonesia’s GHG emissions reduction targets
to G20 leaders.36 He pledged that Indonesia
would reduce GHG emissions by 26% by 2020
from BAU. ‘With international support, we
are confident that we can reduce emissions
by as much as 41%.’ 37 DNPI gives 2020 BAU
GHG emissions as 2,530MtCO2e,38 so pledged
reductions of 2020 BAU levels amount
to 658MtCO2e (26%) or 1,037MtCO2e
(41%), giving remaining GHG emissions of
1,493–1,872MtCO2e in 2020. This represents a
reduction of between 9% and 27% on 2005 net
emissions levels of 2,055MtCO2e.39

Indonesia’s national and regional abatement
plans – developed with the aid of the McKinsey
cost curve, like many national abatement
scenarios – assume that GHG emissions
reductions align with government targets for
expansion of key industry sectors: ‘reductions
in carbon emissions support rather than
undermine our national development goals’.40

One goal that government foresees is a
trebling in pulp and paper production by 2025:
‘The Technology Needs Assessment report
[…] projects that the production of pulp and
paper will increase 3.24 times in 2025’ to 55
million tonnes.41 At the same time, Indonesia’s
abatement plans are largely focused on
the forestry sector, which represents the
vast majority of identified GHG emissions
mitigation potential.42

Based on these plans, largely developed by
the Ministry of Forestry, President Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono announced: ‘We will
change the status of our forest from that
of a net emitter sector to a net sink sector
by 2030.’43 He declared that the forestry
sector would ultimately be delivering GHG
emissions savings of 1GtCO2. 44

The Ministry of Forestry wants international
climate funding to fund ‘enhancing forest
carbon stocks through [timber plantations]
and forest restoration’; and the Chairman

of the Working Group on Climate at the
Ministry of Forestry has stated: ‘We will
renegotiate the agreement with Norway.
Indonesia needs money for tree planting.’45
At the same time, the Ministry of Forestry
is seeking international climate funding
to support pulp and palm oil expansion.
46  Additionally, the DNPI-East Kalimantan
‘green growth’ plan suggests that the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) fund
the construction of two mills as part of its
development strategy. Further, the World
Bank Clean Technology Fund (CTF) proposes
co-financing of $400 million (US) to support
initiatives in Indonesia, including ‘improving
energy efficiency by 30% from business-
as-usual by 2025’.47 These investments in
turn ‘mobilise financing […] from multilateral
financiers, state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
and the private sector’48 amounting to a total
of $3.1 billion as of March 2010, according
to the World Bank.49 The fund identifies
the expanding pulp sector as an important
candidate for such funding.50

National abatement plans for the forestry
sector champion ‘(re-)establishing forests
on more than 10 million ha of degraded
non-forested and forested land’.51
Ministry of Forestry plans to revitalise
the forestry sector include – under the
title ‘integration of climate change issues
into forestry sector planning’ – the
establishment of a total of 33 million ha of
timber plantations by 2030/2050,52 with
the majority established by 2025. A 2010
Ministry document, ‘Forestry policy for
addressing climate change in Indonesia’,
describes these plantations as a ‘carbon
sequestration programme’ that forms a core
part of the ‘Climate Change Action Plan in
Forestry sector (RENSTRA)’.53 Indonesia’s
Second National Communication (SNC)
to the UNFCCC describes the plantation
programme as ‘sink enhancement’.54

In theory, the proposal to plant trees to
sequester carbon sounds like a win-win
for climate protection and industrial

WHICH DEvElOPmENT PATHWAY
WIll INDONESIA fOllOW?

Ultimately, REDD+ policies are only as reliable
and effective as their underlying methodology
for accounting for forest protection and GHG
emissions reductions, and the political will to
implement a low-carbon development pathway.

Before Indonesia’s abatement plans leave the
drawing board, there are a number of institutional,
methodological and technical weaknesses that
must be addressed, as they undermine the ability
of the government to deliver on the President’s
climate goals or low-carbon development agenda.

Firstly, Indonesia’s DNPI identifies the pulp
and palm oil sectors as key industrial drivers of
natural forest loss and peatland degradation.55

These two sectors, as well as Indonesian
ministries including Ministry of Industry and
Ministry of Forestry, regularly claim they play a
critical role in national economic development
and poverty alleviation.56 The government
appears divided on how – or whether – to
address the rapid expansion of the pulp and
palm oil sectors into carbon-rich forests and
peatlands and critical wildlife habitats.

Current operations for the pulp and palm
sectors are typified by poor governance57
– with apparent widespread disregard for
regulations on permits, environmental
impact assessments and protection of deep
peatland – poor land management and poor
productivity when compared with global

competitors such as Malaysia or Brazil. For
instance, as the DNPI–East Kalimantan ‘green
growth’ plan observes, both sectors have been
given extensive concession areas. Much of
this land has been cleared of natural forest,
and what little area has been planted yields
comparatively poor fibre or palm oil harvests.58

Independent third party verification of
any claimed reductions in deforestation in
Indonesia is challenging. Official data is often
not readily and freely available to the public.
What information the Ministry of Forestry does
release is often several years out of date, and
the methodology is unclear or contradictory.
Industry has opposed the use of satellite
monitoring of its operations,59 although Sinar
Mas – Indonesia’s largest pulp and palm oil
producer – itself uses state-of-the-art radar
mapping ‘to manage its pulpwood resource
more efficiently’. This mapping technology
delivers results ‘equivalent to conducting a
100% ground inventory of the forest’.60

Indonesia’s abatement methodology –
what assumptions are made about the
sequestration potential of plantations, for
instance, and the ultimate fate of the carbon
within harvested plantations – is in flux, with
evident contradictions within and between
official reports.

In line with industry claims and the seemingly-
preferred Ministry of Forestry methodology,

Indonesia’s November 2009 Second National
Communication to the UNFCCC credits timber
plantations with huge, cumulative sequestration
potential – ie it presumes that carbon in harvested
plantation crops is stored in perpetuity.61 However,
UNFCCC standards assume that harvested wood
is destined for products with a short lifespan, and
therefore any carbon absorbed within the timber
should be counted as emitted in the year the
timber is harvested.62

The DNPI 2010 national GHG abatement
plan downplays plantation sequestration
potential, but suggests that, nevertheless,
plantations have a role to play in terms of forest
rehabilitation.63 The DNPI’s regional reports also
acknowledge that carbon stored in plantation
crops is emitted at harvest;64 however, they
appear to base at least some of their projections
on the same discredited methodology used
in Indonesia’s SNC report,65 and describe
their reforestation plans as ‘increas[ing] the
natural carbon sink by enlarging the dry land
forest cover on mineral soil with suitable and
economically viable tree species, such as native
species that can yield timber and non-timber
products as well as species such as acacias’.66
Acacia is grown as a short rotation plantation
crop used for pulp production.

In terms of Indonesia’s national development
assumptions, calculations on projected 2025–
2030 land-use demands by sectors prioritised
by Indonesian Forestry, Energy, Agriculture and

Trade ministries amount to about 63 million
ha, which equates to all remaining land in areas
zoned for development.

Additionally, the Ministry of Forestry has not yet
made publicly available its definition of or maps
locating so-called ‘degraded’ lands where low-
carbon development in line with national objectives
may take place. Such a definition is critical to
ensuring that international REDD funding genuinely
supports forest and peatland protection in the
national and global interest. A variety of terms
are used in government and industry documents
to describe such land – degraded, critical, idle,
unproductive – to suggest that extensive land
exists that would benefit from REDD-funded
plantation development. Greenpeace preliminary
analysis, based on publicly available Ministry of
Forestry data, suggests that the area of land
potentially available for low-carbon development is
less than one-quarter of planned expansion.

At the same time, Indonesia’s 2010 national
abatement plan fails to set out any productivity
targets to incentivise improved yields and
land management by the key drivers of
deforestation. This is despite the DNPI ‘green
growth’ plans, which reveal huge scope for
improvement (up to fourfold improvement in
pulp yields, and near twofold improvement in
palm oil yields); the figures suggest that, were
productivity improved, further concession areas
would be largely unnecessary in order to achieve
long-term sectoral development goals.

In the absence of strategic direction and clear social
and environmental development goals, the cost
of putting Indonesia on a genuinely low-carbon
development pathway has not been assessed.

Productivity incentives to change expansion models
are also required. International funding to support
plantation establishment on as yet undefined and
unmapped ‘degraded lands’ will not in and of itself
prevent the planned destruction of millions of
hectares of carbon-rich forests and peatlands.
Inevitably, competing land uses will push some
development into forests and peatlands.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono appears to
recognise that this would be a tragedy both for
the people of Indonesia and the global climate:
‘Indonesia understands the necessity of doing
its part to face the urgent global challenge of
combating climate change. As a developing country,
and an archipelago of 17,000 islands, our people
face the brunt of impact of climate change.’67

Indonesia’s people, business environment and
ecosystems have all been identified as being
at ‘high risk’ due to the effects of climate
change.68 The protection of tropical forests is a
well-recognised strategy to enhance societies’
adaptive capacity and reduce the vulnerability
of ecosystems to extreme events such as
floods or droughts:69

•  Forests are important for adaptation to

climate change as they help protect from

extreme weather events such as high
winds and coastal floods.70

•  Protecting natural forest ecosystems is
often more effective and efficient at
providing adaptation benefits than
development of new infrastructures.71

•  Loss or destruction of natural forests
increases ecosystem, biodiversity
and social vulnerability.72

•  By contrast, timber or estate crop plantations
such as oil palm hold a fraction of the carbon of
natural forests. Equally, they do not adequately
provide the essential ecosystem services given
by natural forests, sustain freshwater cycles
and other benefits for local communities, nor
harbour the same degree of biodiversity.73

Critical to this, and to the long-term
development pathway Indonesia follows, is a
meaningful definition and mapping of the land
available for low-carbon development. The
joint Indonesia National Development Planning
Agency (BAPPENAS)–UN-REDD October
2010 draft National REDD+ Strategy does
establish a technical carbon threshold for land
suitable for low-carbon development, as well
as land meriting conservation purely for its
carbon storage potential. 74 Logically applied,
these carbon criteria translate into policies
for low-carbon development based on full
peatland and forest protection.75

Within Production Forest, there are three zones:

Since the 1960s Indonesia has been divided
into two administrative land categories:
Non-Forest Land and Forest Estate.76 The
consequence is that Indonesia has Forest
Estate with trees, Forest Estate without
trees, Non-Forest Land with trees and Non-
Forest Land without trees.

Non-Forest Land (APL) is controlled by
various ministries and regional governments,
according to land use. The Ministry of
Forestry has administrative responsibility for
the Forest Estate.

Much APL is already occupied by agricultural
land, industry and other identified economic
activity or development, such as cities or
transport infrastructure. However, APL contains
significant areas of forest, peatland and other
land areas deemed available for economic
development. These areas are often outside
central government control, and their industrial
development can represent an important source
of income for regional governments.

The Forest Estate is divided up according
to functional categories: broadly speaking,
conservation or industrial development. The
category available for industrial exploitation
is categorised as Production Forest and
covers some 82 million ha – nearly two-
thirds of the Forest Estate.77

Generally, markets are very bad
at ensuring the provision of public
goods, such as security, stability,
health and education. For example,
firms that produce cheap labour-
intensive goods or that exploit
natural resources may not want
a more educated workforce and
may care little about their workers’
health if there is an abundant pool
of labour. Without complementary
societal and state action, markets
can be weak on environmental
sustainability, creating the
conditions for environmental
degradation, even for such
disasters as mud flows in Java.

A first principle of Indonesia’s GHG abatement
plans is that they ‘support rather than undermine
our national development goals’.92 The Indonesian
Letter of Intent93 with Norway signed by President
Yudhoyono attempts to begin shifting Indonesia’s
economic development onto a low-carbon
pathway. The levers are a moratorium on new
permits to convert natural forests and peatlands,
and a call for an immediate review of existing
concession permits on such lands to see if they
could be relocated elsewhere.

A strong moratorium would protect the
remaining natural forests, focus low-carbon
development on increasing productivity and
confine expansion to genuinely degraded
lands with low carbon, social or biodiversity
values. This would have the effect of helping
improve national economic health, by making
Indonesia a secure and sustainable investment
location for companies who do not want to be
associated with forest destruction; improving
people’s quality of life through the creation of
higher-value, clean industry without loss of
natural resources; and respecting the rights of
indigenous peoples and local communities.

However, Indonesia’s pulp and paper industries
– with support from inside certain ministries
– are seeking to forestall these changes and
either derail the agreement with Norway
or render it ineffective. Notably, Indonesian
ministries have projected considerable
expansion for sectors including pulp, palm
oil, biofuel and coal in the name of improving
Indonesia’s self-sufficiency, strengthening
international trade and poverty alleviation.
This raises the question of the likely impacts
of current development plans on Indonesia’s
forests, peatlands, GHG emissions and
communities.

As the DNPI 2010 GHG abatement plan admits,
expansion plans in key industry sectors are
expected to result in the conversion of millions
of hectares of forest and peatland by 2030:
‘Government plans for increasing pulp and palm
oil production will require 11–15 million ha of
currently forest covered areas to be converted. To
feed and support the growing population, another
10–13 million ha are required for croplands.
General increasing demand for wood products in
construction and bioenergy might lead to even
larger areas required.’94

‘Much of that additional land is likely to be made
available through deforestation of conversion
forest (Hutan Produksi Konversi, HPK); the shift
of production forests (Hutan Produksi, HP) to
conversion forests because of high rates of
degradation (due to poor logging practices); and
from conversion of forests located outside the
forest estate (kawasan hutan). […] It is expected
that deforestation will shift to other, still largely
forested islands such as parts of Kalimantan and
especially Papua.’95

This section looks at the projected land-use
pressures from key sectors to 2030, identifies
which zones will feel the pressure from particular
sectors, and assesses the high-carbon forest and
peatland values at risk within those zones.

The findings: if targets and assumptions for
key land-use sectors are met, about 63 million
ha or more96 of additional land would need to
be brought into production by 2030, almost
exclusively within the HP, HPK and APL zones.
Including forests, areas within these zones not
already under identified economic land use
amount to about 60 million ha.

This suggests that there will be significant
competition for land within the HP, HPK and APL
zones. Undeveloped forested land and peatland
areas will be primary targets for expansion,
being both less likely to conflict with existing
social or economic interests and more lucrative,
as forest assets (timber) can be liquidated to
fund plantation or agricultural development (or
just logged and the land left degraded, as the
DNPI concedes).97

The findings seriously challenge the basic
premise of the DNPI GHG abatement plan
and other climate-related reports that – with
international support – the pulp and paper
sectors will help reduce GHG emissions from
deforestation, and set Indonesia on a low-
carbon development pathway. The findings
highlight the critical need to define genuinely
degraded land available for low-carbon
development.

Government climate planning documents project
a trebling of pulp and paper production by
2025.98 The DNPI’s GHG abatement plan states:
‘government plans for increasing pulp production’
will require 6–8 million ha of ‘currently forest
covered areas to be converted’.99 Total land-use
projections for the sector are not quantified.
The Ministry of Forestry is already considering
pulp mill project proposals that would see a
doubling of 2009 capacity levels to around 16
million tonnes,100 with proposals from the DNPI-
East Kalimantan government that involve IFC
support for development of two mills with a total
pulp capacity of 2.6 million tonnes.101

Data deficiencies make estimating long-term
pulpwood yields, ongoing fibre deficits met from
natural forest clearance and associated future
industry land-use needs difficult.

Pulp production figures together with
Ministry of Forestry statistics on pulpwood
yields suggest that the pulp sector remains
dependent on natural forest clearance to meet
at least one-quarter of current production.102

Although up to 10 million ha of industrial timber
concessions (HTI) – chiefly pulpwood103 – had
been licensed by 2009,104 less than half (4.3
million ha) had been planted by 2008.105 Much
of the area that has been developed is poorly
managed.106 Credible plantation yield figures
are difficult to obtain. At most, the Ministry
of Forestry’s own production data as of 2008
allow a maximum average yield of HTI pulp
plantations of 60m³/ha at harvest,107 about half
of the industry’s claimed yields.108 Data within
the DNPI–East Kalimantan regional government
‘green growth’ strategy suggest – at least within
that province – actual yields of just 30m³/ha (or
just a quarter of industry claims).109However, the
maximum current yield derived from the official

Ministry of Forestry production data suggest
that to treble production over the next 15 years
would require the gross concession area to nearly
double to 19 million ha.110

If new pulp mills are built prior to plantations being
fully established and able to meet raw material
demands, the mills can only be supplied by clearing
natural forest. It is clear that even in the short
term, certain ministries are advocating substantial
natural forest loss to overcome the ongoing pulp
fibre deficit111 and feed further increased pulp
production. When, in July 2010, the Industry
Minister called for a rapid doubling of production
and export from the sector,112 he also announced
that the government planned to expand the pulp
and paper industry to Papua, reportedly ‘because
of its vast tracts of forest’,113 in recognition of the
insufficiency of plantation timber supply to meet
even current pulp production levels.114

‘Rapidly’ doubling current production would
require the clearance of 320,000–640,000 ha of
natural forest per year, assuming that producers
are able to obtain 50–100m3 of pulpable wood
from each hectare they clear.115

Existing plantations are not able to meet even
current fibre demand from the pulp sector, given
the current maximum average yield of 60m³/ha.
Plantations take about seven years to mature.
Plantation timber planted in 2012 to fuel increased
production could only be assumed to start
becoming available from 2019 in limited volumes,
with amounts increasing as later plantings and
repeat rotations kick in.

It can be assumed, therefore, that without radical
changes in industry practice, the pulp sector’s
supply deficit and consequently natural forest
clearance will continue for many decades if pulp
production increases to the target levels.

Sector development planS:
‘revitaliSe the foreStry Sector’

Excluding pulp, installed capacity for the
wood-processing sector – lumber, plywood,
veneer and woodchips – is estimated to require
44 million m3/yr of timber.116 Given that the
2004–2008 average official legal log supply
was 25 million m³/yr,117 with only about half
of that destined for the non-pulp segment of
the wood-processing sector,118 the overall
structural deficit of this segment of the sector
equates to about 31 million m3/yr.

Although this deficit has forced a temporary
decrease in processed wood production,119
leading to the collapse and bankruptcy of
some wood-based industries,120 government
figures suggest that in 2005 – even with
reduced production levels – around 30% of
overall sector production came from illegal
timber supplies.121

Indonesia’s 2010 GHG abatement plan states
that, over the 2010–2030 period, Indonesia
stands to lose ‘21–28 million ha of currently
forested land [in part] because of high rates of
degradation (due to poor logging practices)’122
in logging concessions – the source of legal
wood to the sector. The document concedes
that the ‘general increasing demand for wood
products […] might lead to even larger areas
[of forest] required’, but does not quantify the
sector’s needs.123

Data on BAU plantation establishment and
productivity of non-pulp timber plantations is
not readily available from official sources. It is a
fair assumption that the sector will continue to
rely on natural forest timber, some of it illegally
harvested, for the foreseeable future, driving
deforestation and degradation.

‘COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIALISED AGRICULTURE’

21

indonesia is a
leading exporter
of coffee.

‘To support and implement a development
policy for sustained high economic growth,’ the
Indonesian government has made ‘Revitalisation
of Agricultural Competitiveness in the National &
Global Economy’ a ‘policy priority’, with specific
goals including the ‘realisation of a competitive
industrialised agriculture’. Thus: ‘To increase
competitiveness of the agri. [sic] sector, it
must be transformed from self-sufficiency to
exporting high-value agricultural products. In
addition to meeting the country’s food security
needs, it should also produce high-value crops,
livestock, fisheries, forestry and other products
for export and supply raw materials for agro-

industries.’133 Indonesia is already a global power
in exports of commodities such as cocoa beans
and coffee, in addition to palm oil.134

Indonesia is seeking to stimulate foreign and
domestic investment in the agriculture sector
through the creation of ‘food production
zones’. In August 2010, the government
granted permits to the first of these projects,135
covering a total of 1.6 million ha of land in the
heavily forested Merauke region of Papua.136
One company – Singapore-based Wilmar
International Ltd – secured a permit to develop
200,000 ha for sugar cane.137

The rapid expansion of agricultural crops for
domestic use and export creates significant
land-use pressure. United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) statistics reveal
that since 2000, an average of 250,000 ha
of new land has been brought into agricultural
production annually, excluding permanent
estate crops such as oil palm, cocoa and coffee
plantations.138 Extrapolating, this suggests
an additional 5 million ha may be brought into
production by 2030.

Administratively, this expansion takes place in
the APL or released HPK zones.

The DNPI 2010 GHG abatement plan projects that
by 2030 ‘another 10–13 million ha [of forest] are
required for croplands’,139 but it does not quantify total
land-use demands for the agriculture sector. Given
the policy priority to expand industrialised agricultural
commodity production and trade, it is highly
problematic for the DNPI to single out smallholder
agriculture as a main driver of deforestation, with no
mention of other agricultural drivers. Additionally,
these land expansion projections contrast sharply with
the 2010 draft REDD+ Strategy which states: ‘until
2020 the needs for crop lands […] can still be fulfilled
from the existing agricultural lands without any needs
for a [sic] new forest conversion (clearing)’.140

BIOfuEl PRODuCTION CREATES
ADDITIONAl lAND PRESSuRE

Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy has large-
scale ambitions for bioenergy production. It
has promoted four priority commodities for
bioenergy production: oil palm, jatropha, sugar
cane and cassava.145 In 2007, the Ministry
presented plans to develop 5.25 million ha of ‘idle
land’ for biofuel plantations by 2010,146 virtually
all within the Forest Estate147 (hence, the HPK

This brings the total area earmarked by the
government for biofuel production to 9.25 million
ha, at least half of it within the Forest Estate. The
DNPI 2010 GHG abatement plan concedes that
‘general increasing demand for […] bioenergy’
might lead to the conversion of significant areas
of forest, but does not quantify the sector’s
needs.149 Interestingly, the DNPI suggests
‘Biodiesel made from palm oil would provide an
additional 10MtCO2e of abatement potential’ at
the cost of $100/tCO2e.150 This would represent
a contribution of $1 billion/yr to the sector for
the dedication of 4 million ha of oil palm to biofuel
production.151 Clearly, the plantations would
have to be on virtually bare land if the biofuel is
assumed to be carbon neutral, and would need to
avoid displacing other development into forests.

COAl fuElS HIGH-
CARBON ExPANSION

Coal is one of the dirtiest forms of energy in the
world. Indonesia has seen a rapid expansion of
coal mining during the last decade.152 According
to the DNPI-East Kalimantan document, coal is a
leading driver of deforestation.153

Although Indonesia’s 2010 GHG abatement
plan specifically states that with international
support, the country has the opportunity ‘to
shift to a less carbon-intensive development
model’,154 the Ministry of Energy and external
funding agencies assume coal will fuel most
expansion in power generation.155

zone). Additionally, a further 2.5 million ha of oil
palm and 1.5 million ha of jatropha plantations
are stipulated for biofuel production to meet
2025 production targets.148

The rapid expansion of Indonesia’s coal sector
to meet growing domestic and global energy
demand creates additional pressure on
Indonesia’s forests, as well as the global climate.

By 2009, working coal concessions covered
over 500,000 ha of Forest Estate,156 while a
much larger area was covered by concessions at
various stages of exploration.157 The Ministry of
Forestry is working on the basis that 200,000 ha
of land within the Forest Estate will be given over
to mining activities annually.158 This suggests
that by 2030 coal concessions within the Forest
Estate will cover an additional 4 million ha. Total
land-use demand is not quantified.

One of the key drivers of increased energy demand
identified by the DNPI and the UNFCCC is the pulp
and paper sector.159 The DNPI–UNFCCC Needs
Assessment on Climate Change Mitigation report
notes that its assessment of the sector is based on
data provided by Sinar Mas,160 responsible for almost
half of Indonesia’s pulp production in 2009.161

Citing work by Environmental Resources
Management (ERM), 162 Sinar Mas claims that the
carbon footprint of its pulp and paper production
is ‘close to neutral’.163 By contrast, the DNPI–

about 6.3tCO2

165

Sinar Mas has joined the dash for coal and is rapidly
expanding its coal mining operations. The Executive
Director of the Indonesian Mining Association (IMA),
Priyo Soemarno, stated in an interview with Investor
Daily in May 2009: ‘I am sure Sinar Mas could be
one of the big 10 national coal producers in the next
few years. […] The main reason is to guarantee the
supply of internal needs.’166 Sinar Mas has stated
publicly: ‘Sinar Mas now needs more than 10 million
tons of coal per year to meet electricity generation
requirements in its paper and pulp factories. These
business groups will continue to increase production
capacity in the future.’167 Based on Sinar Mas Mining’s
analysis of the carbon content of its coal and declared
use, coal emissions alone resulting from Sinar Mas’
pulp and paper production amount to 20–26.5MtCO2
annually;168 this is about half of Norway’s total nationally
reported GHG emissions.169 Sinar Mas’ largest
Indonesian pulp mill uses peat as part of its fuel mix.170

The DNPI–UNFCCC statements on the energy
intensity of pulp and paper production suggest
the sector is currently responsible for over
50MtCO2e171 – equivalent to almost half of
current GHG emissions from power generation,
although it does not appear to figure in the
national GHG emissions calculations. The
assumptions further suggest that if expansion
targets for the sector are met paper production
will be responsible for 170–200MtCO2e emissions
annually, depending on whether or not efficiency
measures are implemented. 172 This is almost twice
Indonesia’s current total declared GHG emissions
from power generation of 110MtCO2e.173

2005/2006 in relation to land-use zoning.175
This quantifies the extent of forest cover in
different administrative zones.

Supplementary analysis by Greenpeace based
on best-available data sets reveals the quality of
the forest cover, and the extent of habitat and
peatland within the areas zoned for development.

In 2009, the Ministry of Forestry made
available its 2006 landcover data, 176 which
identifies primary, secondary and plantation
forest cover, agricultural lands, land for
other identified economic uses, scrubland
and ‘bare land’.

Greenpeace mapping and analysis of
ecological values and their overlap with
administrative zones and existing concession
areas include several data sets: government

Areas available for expansion within the HP,
HPK and APL zones currently planned for
development contain considerable carbon,
ecological and biodiversity values. Collectively,
these areas contain:

•	 Nearly 80% of Indonesia’s peatland (over 16
million ha; of this, 2.4 million ha is very deep
peat [>4 metres]).

•	 40% of Indonesia’s remaining natural forest
(37 million ha in total; of this, more than one-
third is primary) – an area the size of Norway
and Denmark.182

•	 Half of forested orang-utan habitat in

Kalimantan (nearly 4 million ha is forested);
over a quarter of forested Sumatran tiger
habitat (just over 3 million ha).

Indonesia’s development ambitions and
REDD mitigation proposals suggest there
is adequate ‘degraded land’ available for
development priorities, but offer inadequate
or contradictory definitions of this land.

The joint Indonesia National Development Planning
Agency (BAPPENAS)–UN-REDD October 2010
draft National REDD+ Strategy does establish a
technical carbon threshold of <35tC/ha183 for
land suitable for low-carbon development. It also
states that land with a potential to reach 100tC/
ha merits conservation purely for its carbon
storage potential. 184 Logically applied, these
carbon criteria should translate into policies for
low-carbon development based on full peatland
and forest protection.185

Greenpeace’s preliminary analysis sought to
identify genuinely degraded land for potential
low-carbon development. Collectively, the HP/
HPK and APL zones contain 14 million ha of
landcover identified by the Ministry of Forestry
as bareland, scrubland or savannah that is not
on wetlands, and hence is potentially below
the threshold of 35tC/ha.186 However, this
assessment does not include other important
development metrics, including wildlife (habitat)
and social (identified economic or agricultural
activity) values. Further, supplementary
landcover analysis suggests significant tree cover
within some of these categories.

CONCLUSION: DEVELOPMENT
AMBITIONS MUST CONCENTRATE
ON INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY

Ministry of Forestry and other data sets also used
by the Indonesian government in its 2010 GHG
abatement plan suggest that the potential area of
low-carbon land available for planned expansion
in key sectors represents less than one-quarter
of predicted BAU sector land-use: about 14
million ha as opposed to about 63 million ha.
Even within this subset, alternative land-uses

to industrial plantation development may be
more appropriate from carbon, conservation,
ecological and social perspectives.

The 2010 GHG abatement plan identifies the pulp
and palm oil sectors as drivers of half of predicted
deforestation over the 2010–2030 period.187

In order for Indonesia to meet its express
ambitions not to be ‘locked into a growth model
that is unsustainable for our, and the world’s,
environment’ it is clear that sectors such as pulp
and palm oil must ‘shift to a less carbon-intensive
development model’.188

A top priority must be radically improving
productivity within existing plantations, without
further clearance.

DNPI and industry documents emphasise the
potential to improve productivity for pulp fourfold
and palm oil nearly twofold. Concentrating on
productivity improvements would render further
extensive land conversion for these sectors,
even within existing concession areas, largely
unnecessary. That is a win-win situation for both
the economy and the environment.

However, key players in the pulp and palm oil
sectors and within ministries in the Indonesian
government appear institutionally hostile to
revision of the BAU model, and seek to equate their
unsustainable business model with rhetoric about
poverty alleviation and economic development.189
Such rhetoric is undermining President’s
Yudhoyono’s ambitions to seize this opportunity
to set Indonesia on a low-carbon, high-value
development pathway with substantial financial
support from the international community.

According to the DNPI, Indonesia’s peatland
areas and their forests store 40GtC, ‘a value
comparable to the Amazon rainforest’.190
However, whereas the Amazon extends over an
area over three-quarters the total size of the
USA,191 Indonesia’s total peatland area is smaller
than the UK.192 Less than half of that area
is – as yet – degraded,193 yet GHG emissions
from Indonesia’s peatland194 are greater than
the UK.195Nearly 80% of Indonesia’s peatland
– holding 28GtC – is in areas zoned for
intensive development by 2030.196 The DNPI’s
2010 GHG abatement plan assumes ‘that
large areas [of peatland] will be converted’197

without radical change in government policy
and industry practice, and that peatland
emissions will rise ‘due to the fresh conversion
and drainage of peatland for plantations (eg,
pulpwood and oil palm plantations)’.198

rather than the overall GHG emissions liability
from the area. They also leave open the
possibility that plantations will be classified
as rehabilitation – an interpretation strongly
advocated by industry.

DNPI plans identify three levers for mitigating
BAU GHG emissions: fire prevention, water
management and rehabilitation.199 Avoiding
planned development on peatland is not
specifically identified as a potential lever.200

The DNPI’s mitigation/abatement levers
largely target the rate of peatland emission

For instance, a presentation by Sinar Mas to a
group including the DNPI and the Ministry of
Forestry immediately prior to the Copenhagen
Climate Summit in December 2009 suggested
that its pulp plantations on peatland abate
GHG emissions from fire, restore hydrological
function of degraded peat and restore carbon
sequestration of collapsed peat domes.201

The carbon reality is that further development
on peatland will add substantially to the world’s
overall GHG emissions, bringing us closer to
climate tipping points that could have catastrophic
impacts for all nations, including Indonesia. Full
protection of peatlands is the simplest, quickest
and most direct way to meet a substantial share of
President Yudhoyono’s climate commitments.

According to Indonesia’s 2009 Second National
Communication to the UNFCCC, on average
Indonesia’s primary forests store 400tC/ha and
other forests 200tC/ha.202

About 40% of Indonesia’s forest is in areas
zoned for development, including conversion to
timber and oil palm plantations and production
of agricultural commodities. Within these zones,
primary forest covers more than 13.6 million ha
and other forests cover nearly 23.3 million ha –
37 million ha in total, an area the size of Norway
and Denmark.203 Ministry of Forestry figures
suggest these forests hold 10GtC.204

‘Government plans for increasing pulp and palm
oil production will require 11–15 million ha of
currently forest covered areas to be converted.
To feed and support the growing population,
another 10–13 million ha are required for
croplands. General increasing demand for wood
products in construction and bioenergy might
lead to even larger areas required.’205

The opportunity cost of preventing just over
half of this zoned deforestation (the share
attributed to pulp and palm development) is
given at about $30/tCO2e , which equates to
an opportunity cost of about $20,000/ha.206

The DNPI’s scenario assumes the loss of
the majority – if not all – of this forest:

To strengthen the role of the
land use and forestry sector in
mitigating climate change, the
Government of Indonesia has set
up ambitious targets for land and
forest rehabilitation programmes.
All forest concession companies
are encouraged to adopt
improved silviculture systems,
such as reduced impact logging
and intensive silviculture
(SILIN). With such an ambitious
programme, Indonesia will turn
into a net GHG sink country in
the next 10 years. However, to
achieve such ambitious targets,
Indonesia will require  (cid:31) nancial
support, technology transfer
and capacity building. The rate
of programme implementation
along with their corresponding CO2 sequestration is presented in Table 6.

The DNPI’s 2010 GHG abatement plan
does go on to say: ‘These costs can be
significantly reduced if those plantations
can be established on already degraded or
deforested areas, as the costs then represent
only forgone revenue from one-time timber
extraction for the initial land clearing’.207
However, the actual cost – per tonne CO2e, or
per hectare of forest of relocating plantations,
or (most appropriately from an economic

32

It also fails to incentivise improvements in
productivity, which would lessen overall land
area demands.

Equally perversely, allowing areas to be
deforested (with the lost timber quite
probably used to meet the fibre needs of the
pulp sector) and then allowing plantation
establishment on ‘degraded […] forested
land’208 to count as ‘reforestation’ is identified
as a markedly cheaper option to avoiding
deforestation.

‘Afforestation and reforestation represent a
sequestration opportunity of 300MtCO2e by
2030 at a cost of $5–6 per avoided tCO2e.
This implies (re-)establishing forests on more
than 10 million ha of degraded non-forested
and forested land […]. Developing commercial
timber and estate crop plantations as part of
the reforestation program could help to reduce
the pressure on remaining forest areas.’209 A
DNPI–Jambi regional government strategy
document puts forward a theory to resolve this
tension between reforestation as plantation
establishment in ‘degraded’ forest or as GHG
emissions abatement: ‘Increasing the carbon
sink by afforestation or reforestation can
only be realised if these areas are set aside

for conservation. However, one way to bring
degraded areas back under forest cover could
be to plant a temporary timber plantation,
which could then be gradually transformed to
conservation or protection forest.’210

Two preferred options in relation to plantations
seem to emerge from the DNPI GHG cost curve
report – either the international community
should pay the full ‘opportunity cost’ of not
establishing plantations, or it should accept
plantation establishment as part of the solution.
The industry stands to benefit either way, and
unless very large sums of money are made
available (over $10 billion/yr for the pulp and
palm oil sectors by 2030)211 deforestation for
plantations is set to continue under the DNPI plan.

It would appear that some elements within the
Indonesian government want the international
community to pay quite a lot of money for pulp
and palm oil industry expansion, without being
able justify it from a climate perspective.

Interestingly, however, these same documents
contain much evidence suggesting that the pulp
and palm oil sectors have the potential to radically
transform their business models and genuinely
contribute to a low-carbon development

trajectory for Indonesia that does not depend on
forest and peatland destruction.

As recognised by various official documents,212
Indonesia is a nation whose environment, people
and economy are incredibly vulnerable to the
impacts of climate change. As the world’s leading
source of deforestation-related emissions,
Indonesia must take action to protect its
remaining natural forests and peatlands. Their
protection is vital not only to reducing global GHG
emissions, but also to maintaining the health,
safety and security of Indonesia’s people.213

The reality of the GHG emissions reductions
achieved through shifting oil palm and pulp
plantation expansion and other development from
forested lands to land appropriate for low-carbon
development depends very much on how key
terms such as ‘forest’ are defined.

Within the context of Indonesia’s national GHG
emissions abatement plan, REDD+ projects and the
agreement with Norway, there is a lack of clarity
about definition; the terms ‘degraded’, ‘critical’,
‘unproductive’, ‘idle’ and ‘waste land’ are used widely
by both government and industry in Indonesia to
describe land which could be developed to avoid
deforestation-related emissions.

sinar mas palm oil division, Press release,
28 July 2010

‘degraded land’ is ‘defined by the Ministry of
Forestry’ as ‘lahan kritis’ – critical land.216

WHAT DEfINES CRITICAl lAND?

‘Lahan kritis’ (literally ‘critical’ land) is land
legally designated by the Ministry of Forestry
as having reduced ecological functions.217

Official government reports and industry
frequently refer to ‘degraded’ land, without
clear definition, to suggest that Indonesia
has significant areas of land that – with
REDD funding – could be developed to avoid
deforestation-related emissions. Within
the context of international negotiations
to reduce GHG emissions, there is no single
internationally-approved definition of
‘degraded land’, nor is there one definitive
Indonesian law or policy.

As the World Resources Institute has
summarised:214 ‘Land degradation is generally
understood as a human-caused process
that results in long term loss of natural
productivity; forest degradation generally
refers to loss of services provided by forested
ecosystems, including but not limited to
carbon storage.’ Ecologists refer to degraded
forests to mean secondary or selectively
logged forests; however, they emphasise
that such forests contain important carbon,
biodiversity and other values.215

In relation to GHG emissions abatement
plans, the DNPI–Central Kalimantan regional
government report ‘Creating low-carbon
prosperity in Central Kalimantan’ states that

The Ministry of Forestry identifies 59
million ha of ‘critical land’ within the Forest
Estate and a further 41 million ha outside
the Forest Estate.218 The March 2010
ICCSR report notes that this land is in
need of ‘rehabilitation’ – a key component
of Indonesia’s abatement scenario.219
Indonesia’s October 2010 draft National
REDD+ Strategy notes that ‘efforts to
rehabilitate forest areas and critical land […]
should be made a national priority’.220

The DNPI–East Kalimantan government
report ‘East Kalimantan Environmentally
Sustainable Development Strategy’
specifically singles out ‘critical’ and
‘very critical’ land as degraded land with
abatement opportunities. It defines these
areas as having forest cover of up to
40% and 20%, respectively, and cites the
Ministry of Forestry as the source.221

Given the relatively high forest cover levels
within the definition, it is clear that relocating
plantation development to ‘critical’ land is
not synonymous with stopping deforestation
of carbon-rich forests and peatlands. Under
FAO criteria, areas with more than 10%
canopy cover are defined as forests.222

WHAT DEfINES uNPRODuCTIvE OR
IDlE lAND AND lAND zONED fOR
DEvElOPmENT?

‘Tanah terlantar’ is unused/abandoned land on
which a permit has been issued but has not yet
been utilized by the permit-holder – estimated
by the BPN and Forestry Minister at about 7
million ha.223

‘Lahan tidur’ (literally “sleeping” land) is idle land,
considered unproductive according to national
or provincial regulations – currently estimated
at 12 million ha by the BPN.224

Indonesia’s August 2009 draft National REDD+
strategy states that the strategic policy to reduce
deforestation is to allocate ‘unproductive land’ for
plantation development,225 suggesting that the
criteria reflect economic use to industry, rather
than ecological values.

The October 2010 draft National REDD+
strategy suggests that Indonesia has just over 30
million ha of ‘unused land (deemed as available)’
– these are ‘overgrown with weeds and bushes,
both in dry and mangrove swamps’.226

However, there is currently no technical
definition for unproductive forest. 227 The
closest definition and criteria are forestry
regulations revoked in 2003 by Ministerial
Decree to accelerate plantation development
by allowing clearing of natural forest.228 These
historic regulations stipulated that timber
plantations should be established on areas
holding <5m3/ha of commercial timber.229
That is equivalent to one large or about ten

spindly trees per ha – ie virtually bare land and
shrubland. New regulations leave decisions on
the productivity of a given area to the Minister
to determine on a case-by-case basis.230

Indonesia’s November 2009 Second National
Communication to the UNFCCC and internal
Ministry of Forestry documents appear to
assume that the entirety of the permanent
production zone is unproductive land, given
that forest plantations may only be established
in that zone, and the extent of the proposed
plantation programme (33 million ha total) is
almost the same area as the zone itself.231

This administrative and zonal-level approach
to defining land available for expansion is
actively supported by the industries and by the
parts of government ministries that stand to
gain in the context of significant international
climate funding for REDD projects, and the
proposed moratorium on further forest
conversion.

The Indonesian Pulp and Paper Association
(APKI) has stated that areas designated for the
development of plantation forestry (ie ‘based
on zonal land-use plans’) are ‘consistent with
approved national, regional and local land-use
plans, to capture the productive capacity of
degraded forest lands and to ease pressure on
natural forests’.232

APP only establishes plantations in
areas that have been designated by the
government as least valuable in line with
policy for development.

SETTING A BASElINE fOR GENuINE
lOW-CARBON DEvElOPmENT

What is missing from Indonesia’s national
abatement plan is a clear definition and map of
what lands it deems suitable for conversion and
development – and equally, what lands would
benefit from protection.

The ultimate interpretation of what land should
be made available for large-scale development
and what land should be off-limits to such
activities will have serious implications for
Indonesia’s GHG emissions, biodiversity, forest
communities and pulp and palm sector land-use
development strategies. Central to achieving
real emissions reductions is the international
challenge to set strict criteria for the definition
of land available for low-carbon development
based on carbon, biodiversity and social metrics:

•	 From a carbon perspective, development will
not result directly or indirectly in significant
GHG emissions (gross).

•	 From an environmental perspective,
development will not target land with
high conservation values, such as wildlife
habitat, fresh water supplies or other
environmental services.

•	 From a legal perspective, development
does not conflict with existing laws,
concessions or other rights including
traditional rights of indigenous
communities.

•	 From a social perspective, development
will not have negative impacts on local
community livelihoods and will be negotiated
based on a process to obtain free prior and
informed consent.

•	 From an economic perspective, development is

sustainable.

One of the commitments of the Norway/
Indonesia deal is to ‘establish a degraded lands
database’ ‘to facilitate the establishment of
economic activity on such lands rather than
converted peatland or natural forest’.233

A technical definition of land for low-carbon
development has been provided in Indonesia’s
October 2010 draft National REDD+ strategy
– produced jointly with UN-REDD. This defines
high-carbon land for conservation as having
a ‘potential of carbon storage’ of >100tC/ha
and low-carbon land as having carbon stock of
<35tC/ha.234

The standard international baseline definition
for forest as defined by the FAO is >10% tree
canopy cover235 – the percentage of land covered
by foliage or branches at the top or crown of a
forest’s trees. Ministry of Forestry data suggest
that even forest areas at this threshold have
potential to store >100tC/ha; while 35tC/ha
equates to significantly <10% canopy cover.
Thus, these carbon criteria should translate into
policies for low-carbon development based on full
peatland and forest protection.236

Greenpeace preliminary analysis based on
Ministry of Forestry data sought to identify the
area of land potentially available for low-carbon
development in line with this interpretation.
Collectively, the HP/HPK and APL zones contain
14 million ha of landcover identified as bareland,
scrubland or savannah that is not on wetlands.237

Indonesia’s November 2009 official UNFCCC

other Indonesian government documents, 246
assume timber plantation crops will sequester
carbon at the rate of 8tC/ha/yr (implying an
improvement in productivity about four times

President Yudhoyono’s public statements
to the G20 and internal Ministry of Forestry
documents.

Indonesia’s 2010 GHG abatement plan makes
the following assumption: ‘Afforestation
and reforestation represent a sequestration
opportunity of 300MtCO2e by 2030.’251

Sinar Mas – one of the world’s largest pulp
producers, accounting for almost half of
Indonesia’s pulp production in 2009,252 and ‘the
world’s second largest oil palm company’253 –
claims its pulp operations are ‘in the process
of afforesting over 1.3 million hectares of
degraded land and wasteland worldwide and in
doing so [have] contributed to the fight against
global warming’.254 This afforestation includes
establishment of plantations on peatland,
thereby – it claims – turning them ‘from carbon
source into carbon sink’.255 Half of Sinar Mas’
pulp concessions are on peatland.256

REAlITY

Annual carbon uptake through the rapid growth
of short-rotation timber plantations can only be
counted against deforestation emissions if it is
assumed that all carbon is permanently sequestered,
with no GHG emissions following harvest.

The majority of Indonesia’s plantation timber is
destined for the pulp and paper sector.

UNFCCC standards assume that harvested wood
is destined for products with a short lifespan,
and therefore any carbon absorbed within the
timber should be counted as emitted in the year
the timber is harvested.257 The DNPI’s 2010 GHG
abatement plan recognises that plantations have
a very limited abatement potential: ‘Developing
commercial timber and estate crop plantations
as part of the reforestation program […would]
sharply reduce the abatement potential of
reforested areas. This is because large volumes
of CO2e would be emitted at the end of the
plantations’ rotation period.’258

The only carbon that plantations can
reasonably be assumed to sequester is the
time-averaged carbon content of the living
plantation. Thus, in the case of fast-growing,
short-rotation pulpwood plantations, for
instance, the average carbon content is half the
carbon at harvest.

Indonesia’s assumed annual carbon uptake
of 8tC/ha/yr implies a near fourfold increase
in productivity over the maximum current
national average.259 Given these ambitious
assumptions on productivity improvements,
time-averaged carbon held within pulpwood
plantations would amount to about 28tC/ha
(about 100tCO2e/ha), not taking into account
any losses due to fire or non-performing
stands, for example.260 This is about 14% of the
carbon Indonesia estimates as held in logged-
over (secondary) forests within the HP zone,
and just 7% of the carbon it ascribes to primary
forests.261

ASSumPTION 2: PlANTATIONS ON
‘DEGRADED’ lAND WOulD INCREASE
INDONESIA’S fOREST CARBON STOCk

According to the Ministry of Forestry, non-
primary (ie ‘disturbed’, ‘secondary’, logged or
otherwise degraded by human industry) natural
forest holds an average of 200tC/ha262 and
primary forest holds 400tC/ha.263

Peatland holds 600tC/ha per metre depth.264

Hence, any meaningful ambitions to ‘enhance
[Indonesia’s] forest carbon stocks’265 in line with
the Bali Action Plan Paragraph 1b (iii) (so-called
REDD+) through plantation establishment must
be based on the assumption that plantation
establishment will result in a net carbon gain.

Indonesia’s 2010 GHG cost curve is unclear as
to which areas should be available for plantation
establishment – notably, whether industrial
plantations are to replace natural forests or
not, and if so what the definition of a ‘degraded

PROTECTION MONEYFigure 16: relative carbon stores of different forest and plantation

forest’ will be. It does, however, suggest that the
definition of ‘forest’ will be >30% canopy cover.266

Such a high definitional baseline for ‘forest’ has huge
risks for REDD in terms of inadvertently subsidising
increased GHG emissions, as Ministry of Forestry
documents reveal. Calculations based on Ministry
of Forestry assumptions267 suggest that even 10%
canopy cover (the FAO threshold for definition of
forests) would classify as ‘high carbon’ according to
the joint Indonesia National Development Planning
Agency–UN-REDD draft National REDD+ Strategy.268

The priority must be for government to provide
transparent definitions and methodologies, to
map areas identified for protection and areas
where development can be relocated, and
to reduce land pressure through regulatory
incentives to increase productivity.

The DNPI 2010 GHG abatement cost curve
suggests that with REDD+ funding, about
542,000ha269 of of natural forest loss could
be avoided annually (or up to 15 million ha
over the 2010–2030 period)270 through
preventing the establishment of pulp and
oil palm plantations on forest land, and that
plantations (both timber and palm/estate
crops) could form part of the program for
reforestation/ afforestation of an additional
10 million ha of ‘degraded non-forest and
forested’ land’.271 The supposition is that
‘developing commercial timber and estate
crop plantations as part of the reforestation
program could help to reduce the pressure on
remaining forest areas’. 272

Given the multiple land-use pressures
Indonesia is facing and the lack of clarity on
definitions of forests to be protected and
‘degraded’ lands available for development,
Indonesia’s pulp and oil palm sectors have
a critical role to play in shifting Indonesia
onto a low-carbon development pathway.
In addition to supporting a strong, effective
moratorium, these sectors have the
potential for dramatic improvement in
productivity within their plantations. If
such improvements were made, the pulp
sector would cease to provide a lucrative
market for other operations to clear forests
(disincentive), and land-pressure would
be reduced. More broadly, improving
productivity would reposition the pulp
and oil palm sectors relative to their global
competitors as world-class clean industries.

Indonesia’s 2010 GHG abatement cost curve
suggests that with international REDD funding
equivalent to approximately $20,000/ha273
of avoided deforestation, natural forest loss
associated with pulp and oil palm plantation
establishment can be halted.

Yet, industry figures show that – with improved
productivity as a primary objective – the pulp
sector already controls sufficient surplus land
area to meet targeted expansion in production

volumes, and the palm sector would need only a
marginal increase in its land area. Thus, by contrast
with DNPI projections, no further extensive land
allocations and no further extensive conversions
within existing concessions should be necessary.

Enforcing a strict moratorium on further peatland
and forest allocations would be a vital incentive to
industry to improve productivity and sustainability
to levels on a par with or better than those of
Indonesia’s global competitors.

I am confident that
we can reach this goal
[GHG emissions reduction
targets], while also
ensuring sustainable and
equitable economic growth

A STRONG mORATORIum

As part of the $1 billion Indonesia–Norway
climate deal, Indonesia announced a two-
year moratorium on any ‘new concessions on
conversion of natural forests and peatlands
into plantations’.290  The agreement casts a
wide net and the clear focus on protecting
‘natural forests’ is evident throughout the text.
However, since the announcement, the exact
nature of the moratorium – what land areas are
included and what its potential impact will be
on pulp and palm oil expansion plans – has been
hotly debated in the press.

As observed in a Reuters interview with Agus
Purnomo, the President’s special advisor on
climate change: ‘The two-year ban on clearing
natural forest, which begins in 2011, has spooked
palm oil and mining firms who fear it would stifle
expansion and earnings. In a nation noted for
corruption and the power of its resources firms,
the move will test resolve to use donor cash
transparently.’291

In the interview, Purnomo sought to reassure
investors that firms holding licences to clear
forested land in these areas would be exempt
from the moratorium. 292 Further, he admitted
that the moratorium would begin ‘with the very
minimum level of commitment’. 293 He said that
the exact definition of ‘natural’ forest was not

crucial as the initial aim was to protect much of
the primary forest that remains in Indonesia. 294

challenged by elements of government and
industry.299

This statement is ominous, given that primary
forest covers less than half total forested
area in Indonesia, and the majority (70%) of
primary forest is found in protected zones295
that are not legally available for timber or
oil palm plantation development. Such an
approach would therefore provide little or no
additional benefit to the climate, wildlife or
people that depend on Indonesia’s forests.

Further, undeveloped forests and peatlands
within pulp and palm oil concessions allocated
prior to 2011 are not covered by the two-year
moratorium. This means that within existing
10 million ha of HTI concession areas, BAU
expansion on peatlands and forested areas
could continue, leaving substantial carbon and
biodiversity values at risk. Greenpeace analysis
of the land allocated to HTI concessions as
of 2010 shows that over 4 million ha is still
forested (2.5 million ha dryland forest; 1.6
million ha wetland forest).296 Substantial
areas, representing nearly one-fifth of total
concessions (1.8 million ha) were granted full
concession rights (SK Definitif) in 2009 and
the first half of 2010.297

The Letter of Intent contains provisions to
facilitate a review of existing concessions,
and to swap areas to degraded lands.298
However, these provisions are currently being

Greenpeace, together with a broad coalition
of NGOs, as well as corporations, is calling for
immediate protection of all peatlands and for
the moratorium on natural forest clearance
to apply within both new and existing
concession areas.

Critically, in order to create the institutional
framework within which the Indonesian
government can fulfil its low-carbon, high-
value development objectives, a rigorous
moratorium would provide the necessary
opportunity to overhaul the land allocation
process in order to ensure that industrial
development does not compromise ecological,
biodiversity, social, legal and economic values.

Such a moratorium would create an incentive
for industry to increase productivity
dramatically within existing plantation areas.300
Equally, it would create an incentive for industry
to use the lands it has already cleared for
further development.301

Progressive elements within the
Indonesian government share this vision.
The September 2010 report by the DNPI
and the regional government of East
Kalimantan sees the moratorium as an
opportunity to ‘accelerate’302 efforts to
increase productivity rates within existing

plantations and shift further development to
low conservation value land outside natural
forests or peatlands.

The study notes that significant reductions
in annual GHG emissions ‘can be achieved
by first setting a clear plan for palm oil in
terms of CPO [crude palm oil] production
as opposed to hectares planted and using
productivity gains to replace some expansion
of concessions. Next, we can reduce carbon
loss from deforestation. Our first option is
to use our existing degraded lands for new
concessions and use land swaps for existing
concessions with forest cover.’303 The study
indicates that more than three-quarters of
land within pulpwood concessions has been
cleared but has not been planted and remains
idle;304 this suggests that there are large areas
of forest land that have already been cleared
which industry ought to have planted.

Rigorous enforcement of a strong moratorium
would encourage best industrial practice without
compromising high conservation value land, really
would be ‘a new development pathway’.305

The Government of Indonesia has
acknowledged that a history of high
deforestation and forest degradation
rates are a consequence of inadequate
forest governance. […]
  These are pervasive or systemic
problems that go beyond the sector,
such as high levels of corruption and
elite capture […]. Forest crime is a
threat to governance as it undermines
the rule of law, exacerbates social
conflict, and threatens sustainable
forest management.
  The prevention, detection, and
suppression of forest crimes continue
to be hampered by corruption in the
justice system at each step from criminal
detection and investigation, through
case preparation and prosecution, to
adjudication and appeal.
  The sheer number and complexity
of overlapping,inconsistent, and
contradictory regulations in the forest
sector provide ample opportunity for
administrative corruption, as officials
either sell their services as brokers to
navigate the bureaucratic tangle or
else take bribes to circumvent it.

The absence of transparency and
participation of stakeholders also
result in the minimum knowledge
of the society, especially those living
in the forest area, to be involved in
the decision making process in the
licensing process and to conduct
supervision for the said violation of
license. This results in not only the
unavailability of more reliable data
during the decision making process,
but also misuse of authority by the
decision makers, the authorised
officials, in an undetected licensing
process which is not adequately
supervised by the people.

 It is essential for the future development
of the palm oil sector that existing
regulations regarding permits, the
use of fire for land clearing, and illegal

enforcement, the lowest cost and

plant on forest lands.

Ensuring national and international support for
measures to end deforestation and peatland
degradation is successfully implemented
requires good governance and sound financial
management by participating governments,
institutions and industry.

The Chairman of the Climate Change Working
Group at the Ministry of Forestry – one of the lead
negotiators for Indonesia’s climate delegation in
Copenhagen in December 2009 and a key architect
of its Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and
Degradation (REDD) programme – appears at times
to favour the status quo: ‘We want to elaborate

the terms of a forestry moratorium because the
[Letter of Intent] could be dangerous for the
Indonesian economy.’306

INDONESIA’S ExPERIENCE Of
‘REfORESTATION’ fuNDING IN THE
ABSENCE Of GOvERNANCE

Managed by the Ministry of Forestry for most of this
period, the fund lost $5.25 billion between 1994
and 1998, according to an Ernst and Young audit. 310

The ability of the Ministry of Forestry to oversee
the finances associated with REDD projects is
questionable.  As reported in a September 2010
Jakarta Globe article, at least one seniour official
has been named as a corruption suspect by
Indonesia’s anti-corruption agency (KPK). 307

As noted by a recent Center for International
Forestry Research (CIFOR) study,308 Indonesia’s
experience with its Reforestation Fund (Dana
Reboisasi) offers important lessons in the risks of
finance to the forestry sector in the absence of
governance.

The Ministry of Forestry acknowledges that the
forestry sector, including government officials, has
a history of poor governance.

Established in 1989, Indonesia’s Reforestation
Fund is the single largest source of government
revenues from the forestry sector.309

The stated intention of the fund is to support
reforestation and rehabilitation of ‘degraded’
forest lands311 – an echo of Indonesia’s current
REDD proposals.

Historically, this subsidy for plantation development
has encouraged overharvesting in logging
concessions and clearing of so-called ‘degraded’
natural forests.312 Timber companies had a strong
incentive to mismanage the forests in their

PROTECTION MONEY
48

concessions so that they would be eligible for
Reforestation Fund subsidies to convert these areas
to plantations. Only 60% of the areas for which
funding was dispersed have ever been planted (3.7
million ha funded, 1.5 million planted).313

The recently formed Forest Development Funding
Agency Public Service Unit – which now manages
at least $2.2 billion of the reforestation funds – has
failed (at least as of mid-2009) to disperse any of its
funds budgeted for plantation development during
the 2008–2009 period.314 The current Ministry
of Forestry administration is intending to use the
fund to promote the development of the 9 million
ha of new plantations planned by 2016 to ‘revitalise’
the nation’s commercial forestry sector.315 As
Greenpeace analysis shows, significant areas within
current concessions and planned developments
hold substantial areas of forest and peatland.316

These facts have led CIFOR to conclude
that – coupled with an absence of political or
institutional accountability – the fund has created
perverse incentives to clear forests, has created
opportunities for corruption and fraud, and has
led to inequitable distribution of benefits. This
provides a stark illustration of why REDD financing
in Indonesia should focus on forest protection
activities and not fund risky and tangential
endeavors such as industrial plantations.

UNREDD) and donors must ensure that all financing
for REDD is directed in a manner that tackles
deforestation, rather than seeks to offset it.

Central to this is the international challenge
to set clear criteria for the definition of forest
for protection and of genuinely degraded land
appropriate for low-carbon development. These
criteria should include not only carbon, but also
biodiversity, legal, economic and social metrics.

As Greenpeace analysis and mapping shows, within
Indonesia entire zones currently being redefined
as degraded, unproductive or idle wasteland
contain considerable biodiversity and carbon
values. Given the extensive forest and peatland
areas within these zones, the vast majority of this
area clearly falls outside the technical criteria for
low-carbon development proposed within the joint
Indonesia National Development Planning Agency
(BAPPENAS)–UN-REDD October 2010 draft
National REDD+ Strategy. 317

The question is, will Indonesia, Norway
and other REDD donor governments
align themselves with a ‘no regrets’ policy
on REDD – one that prioritises forest
and peatland protection, with a zero
deforestation objective – or will they
tie themselves into carbon accounting
schemes that deliver GHG emissions on
paper, but allow continued degradation of
natural forests? The steps that must be
taken are clear:

DATA AND
METHODOLOGY

mETHODOlOGY AND DATA SOuRCES

Greenpeace data sources and values
assumptions are derived from the best available
official, government or expert sources.
Landscape values assessment is based on the
Ministry of Forestry 2006 landcover map,
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)
habitat maps and Wetlands International
peatland maps. Forest, plantation and carbon
stock figures are derived from Ministry of
Forestry documents, Indonesia’s Second
National Communication to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), the National Climate Change Council
(DNPI) national and regional abatement plans
and the joint Indonesian National Development
Planning Agency (BAPPENAS)–UN-REDD draft
National Strategy for the Reduction of Emissions
from Deforestation and Forest Degradation
(Nastra REDD+).

These are largely the same data sets and values
assumptions used by the DNPI.

Independent analysis of the impact of pulp and
palm oil sector operations is hampered by lack
of government and industry transparency;
this includes difficulty in acquiring current or
sufficiently detailed data. Such deficiencies in
data quality and other evidence available from

official sources mean that the analysis must be
understood as an indicative risk assessment, and
some elements need to be confirmed through field
validation. On the regional scale, any margins of
error within the source data even out, though any
biases in assumptions behind values estimations
– eg, a conservative estimate of peatland carbon
stores – are amplified.

Given these acknowledged issues, Greenpeace
has chosen to use government or industry data
rather than seeking alternative – perhaps more
scientifically up-to-date – data sources. The
significance is in the general findings revealed
through analysis of the government’s own data,
rather than the precise numbers: the scale of the
threat to Indonesia’s forests and global climate,
and the huge potential for low-carbon solutions
based on clear-sighted land-use planning and
world-class productivity from industry.

 in 2009, the DNPi assessed indonesia’s 2005 emissions at
2.25GtcO2e (source: DNPi (2009a, b)). in 2010, the DNPi re-
released the same ‘sectoral’ data, but claiming 250mtcO2e
potential absorption by secondary forests and plantations (source:
DNPi (2010 a,b,c). thus, the national GHG emissions are given as
2.06GtcO2e – with the difference down to accounting methods,
rather to any changes to the underlying data.

 However, significant additional 360mtcO2e GHG emissions from
degradation of ‘5 million ha of non-commercially used’ peatland
is identified in the 2009 DNPi report, yet this figure fails to be
included in the national accounts used in either report.

 in indonesia, commercially used peatlands amount to around 4.8
million ha according to Wetlands international (source: Hooijer et
al (2006)).

 the DNPi’s national accounts included emissions associated with
thiese ‘managed and drained peatland’ areas only. However, they
do claim the emissions from the degraded non-commercially used
peatlands as abatement potential – some 0.36GtcO2e, according to
the 2009 DNPi.

 if properly taken into account, these 0.36GtcO2e emissions
position indonesia well ahead of the next largest emitter, Brazil,
with 2.42GtcO2e total.

forestry sector assumptions in relation to indonesia’s emissions
abatement scenario. None of these expressly locates the ‘degraded
lands’ available for plantation establishment, nor do they spell out
the full extent of the ministry of Forestry’s Forest estate land-use
vision. Greenpeace has obtained an internal ministry of Forestry/
FOrDa document (‘integration of climate change issues into forestry
sector planning’) that affords a fuller view to 2050 of the ministry’s
land-use assumptions and the carbon budget the ministry intends
to claim for the implementation of this vision. this document and its
assumptions – fully complementing the sNc – form the cornerstone
for indonesia’s emissions reductions claims.

of approximately 23 million cubic meters, 17 more than enough
to supply a viable forest products industry. However, currently
only 165,000 ha are actually planted, while the remaining area
is degraded, and lies idle. Low productivity, and this low rate of

cover, depending on crown diameter, the standing stock volume of
commercial timber ranges from 75–150m³/ha. to convert these
standing stock volumes into total aboveground carbon stock, two
methods have been used:

 1) assuming moFor data on aboveground c stock for secondary
forests (here assumed to represent canopy cover levels ranging from
10–60%) of 200tc/ha, the average factor for converting standing
stock commercial timber in secondary forests into aboveground
carbon stock is 3.6. this results in a total aboveground carbon stock
of 93tc/ha;

 2) using iPcc (2006) conversion factors for different standing stock
volumes results in a total aboveground carbon stock of 77tc/ha at
10% canopy cover in indonesia (range depending on crown diameter:
63–96tc/ha). source: iPcc (2006) Guidelines table 4.5; divided by 2

102   according to the industry minister, as of 2009 indonesia has

an annual pulp production of 6.52m tonnes (source: Harahap
(2010)). moFor (2008) table iv 2.2.a gives Hti production as
22,321,885m3, which is sufficient to supply only 4.65 million tonnes
pulp at a conversion factor of 4.8m3/tonne pulp, leaving 1.87 million
tonnes fibre (29%) that must come from other sources, assuming
2009 Hti production was on a par with 2008.

103   75% of fully granted Hti concessions (sK Definitif) were pulpwood,
according to moFor (2007b) (corresponding figure not available in
following year’s report)

104   including sK Definitif, sK sementara and sK Pencadangan titles.

107   moFor (2009c) table iv 2.2.a gives Hti production for 2008 as

22,321,885m3, chap. iv p3 gives area of planted Hti as 4.31
million ha. Of this, Greenpeace estimates pulpwood plantations to
have accounted for 2.4 million ha (projection from last available
figure of 1.9 million ha in 2006). assuming – which is unlikely, thus
the highly favourable results – that all Hti yield in 2008 originated
from pulpwood concessions, and zero from timber plantations, the
yield would have been 58m³/ha. even this yield is questionable. it
is based on figures claiming that total Hti yield roughly trebled in
the five years to 2008, despite a decrease in area planted in the
years that should have supplied these harvests. ciFOr suggest this
discrepancy results from early harvest of plantations, suggesting
future yields may fall. sources: moFor (2009c) table iv 1.4; verchot
et al (2010). Figures given within DNPi/east Kalimantan govt.
(2010) report suggest yields are closer to 30m3/ha.

108   in its 2007 csr, aPP assumes a mai (mean annual increment) of

21m³/ha, not taking into account losses, or a harvest of 147m³ (7-yr
rotation cycle). including losses, assumed to be 30%, the harvest
would be 116m³/ha.

109   ‘currently only 165,000 ha are actually planted, while the remaining
area is degraded, and lies idle. Low productivity, and this low rate of
planting mean east Kalimantan’s annual harvest is only 0.7 million
cubic meters.’ source: DNPi/east Kalimantan govt. (2010): 17.
assuming a seven-year rotation, 700,000/165,000 x 7 = 30m3/ha.

110   18.5 million tonnes of pulp require 88.8 million m3 of pulpwood
(conversion factor 4.8). With a harvest of 60m³/ha over a seven-
year rotation cycle, this requires 10.3 million ha of fully established
plantations.

 currently, there are only 4.31 million ha of Hti planted, of which
Greenpeace estimates 2.4 million to have been dedicated to
pulpwood. source: moFor (2009c): chap. iv p3

 thus, the plan requires an increase of around 7.6 million ha over
current levels to reach 10.3 million ha.

 this figure excludes pre-harvest losses, assumed by aPP to be 20%.
source: aPP (2007). thus, total planted area needs are 12.9 million
ha (10.3 million/0.8)

 this figure excludes infrastructural development, minimum legal
land conservation and community areas, which represent 30–40% of
the gross concession area. source: see e.g. aPP (2007)

 thus, the gross concession area needs are about 19 million ha
(12.9/0.6 = 21 million ha and 12.9/0.7 = 18.4 million ha)

can be developed for industrial plantations areas are the production
forests that are unproductive (article 5, point 1).

 in 1999, Forestry act No.41 year 1999 is enacted (the above
regulations were under the umbrella of Forestry act No.5 year
1967), so there were changes made in the subordinate regulations
accordingly
according to the Forestry act No.41 year 1999, the development of
tree plantations is prioritized in unproductive production forests, in
order to protect the natural forests.

 Forestry minister’s Decree (sK) No.10.1/Kpts-ii/2000 stated that
the criteria of Production Forests for Hti is:
  --> on the areas with non-forest vegetation cover (bushes, bare
land, or grass land); or
  --> on destroyed logged-over areas which have log/timber potential
(10cm in diameter) of not more than 5m3/ha.

 Govt regulation (PP) No.34 year 2002 states that: Hti can be
developed in bare land, grass land, or bushes that are located in the
Production Forests

 PP No.34 was replaced by Govt regulation (PP) No.6 year 2007,

harvesting and manufacture of wood products and by the use
and disposal of wood. in the iPcc recommended default approach
(revised 1996 iPcc Guidelines), all cO2 emissions and removals
associated with forest harvesting and the oxidation of wood
products are accounted for by the country in the year of harvesting
(removal). the proposed method recommends that storage of
carbon in forest products be included in a national inventory only
in the case where a country can document that existing stocks of
long term forest products are in fact increasing. Harvested wood
products (HWP) according to the iPcc good practice guidance
(2003) include wood and paper products. it does not include carbon
in harvested trees that are left at harvest sites. methodologies and
good practice for the estimating and reporting of emissions and
removals from HWP can be found in appendix 3a.1 in the iPcc good
practice guidance for LuLucF (2003)’. source: http://unfccc.int/

259   Pulpwood plantations work on a seven-year rotation. indonesia’s
assumed annual c uptake of 8tc/ha/yr implies a delivered
productivity (ie losses already factored in) of 32m3/ha/yr = 224m3
at harvest. the maximum current national average harvest is 60m3
(see above). sources for 8tc/ha/yr: DNPi (2010a): 23 ex 13, moFor/

plants reaching a height of minimum 5 m and with a crown cover of
more than 30 percent of a defined area, normally one hectare’.

267     Wardoyo and sugardiman (2009): 39, 46. standing timber volume

at 10% crown cover = 74–147m3/ha. timber: carbon conversion
rate of 4:1 gives 19–37tc/ha. total carbon content per hectare will
be higher as it includes other biomass such as branches, leaves
and roots of commercial trees, plus small-diameter trees, lianas,
bushes, etc. to convert these standing stock volumes into total
aboveground carbon stock, two methods have been used:

   1) assuming moFor data on aboveground c stock for secondary
forests (here assumed to represent canopy cover levels ranging
from 10–60%) of 200tc/ha, the average factor for converting
standing stock commercial timber in secondary forests into
aboveground carbons stock is 3.6. this results in a total
aboveground carbon stock of 93tc/ha;

   2) using iPcc (2006) conversion factors for different standing stock
volumes results in a total aboveground carbon stock of 77tc/ha at
10% canopy cover in indonesia (range depending on crown diameter:
63–96tc/ha). source: iPcc (2006) Guidelines table 4.5; divided by 2

278   Based on the projection that the production of the pulp and paper
industry will increase to 55 million tonnes in 2025, or about 3.24
times the production in 2007. source: DNPi/uNFccc (2009)

 18.75 is equal to 34% of 55 million. share of pulp production
from total paper production between 2000 and 2006 – the only
period for which complete data are available – was 34%, with paper
accounting for 51% and waste paper recovery for 15%. Leaving out
waste paper recovery would increase targeted pulp production to
22 million tonnes. However, without waste paper recovery included,
multiplying 2007 production by 3.24 would likely not yield 55 million
tonnes, but 51 million tonnes. including waste paper recovery, the
targeted figure would be approx. 55.6 million tonnes . Figures for
2007 are not available, as the aPKi has not yet released any data
more recent than 2006.

279   Greenpeace estimate based on a maximum possible yield in 2008 of

60m³/ha/yr, assuming a harvest for all non-pulp Hti plantations of
zero, with Hti-pulp plantations (2.5 million ha) harvested over a 7-yr
rotation cycle supplying all the 22 million m³ of Hti timber harvested
in 2008 (source: moFor (2009a)). 60m³/ha/yr is equal to 8.5m³
mean annual increment = 2tc

280  Pulpwood plantations work on a seven-year rotation. indonesia’s

assumed annual c uptake of 8tc/ha/yr implies productivity of 32m³/
ha/yr = 224m³ at harvest on a 7-yr rotation. the maximum current
national average harvest is 60m³ (see above). sources for 8tc/ha/yr:
DNPi (2010a): 23 ex 13, moFor/FOrDa (2009): 17. For comparison,
DNPi/east Kalimantan govt. (2010): 53–54 suggests similar figures:
a possible yield of 23 million m³ annually from 640,000ha planted
area, indicating an mai of 36m³, equivalent to 9tc/ha/yr or 252m³/

ha at harvest on a 7-year rotation

301   ‘east Kalimantan has large areas of land that have been heavily

degraded through previous deforestation, forest degradation, and

Your Excellencies,

As scientists who study tropical forest ecosystems, we would like to commend the Indonesian
government for its commitment to tackling deforestation as well as the Norwegian government
for the support it is providing to help Indonesia achieve this.
We would like to emphasize how important it is that both governments ensure the agreement
currently under discussion not only ensures a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but also
supports the conservation of Indonesia’s rich and diverse forest ecosystems, which provide
livelihoods for millions of people and sustain biodiversity. […]
A moratorium on the granting of new concession licenses for plantations on natural forest and
peatland areas for two years provides a strong starting point to help with such protection, but
only if the right safeguards are established from the beginning. […]
Government officials have been reported to state that plantation expansion will still be possible
because “degraded land and forest” could still be licensed for agricultural use. Indeed, last
month the Indonesian forestry minister told the Jakarta Post that “idle forest areas other than
primary forests and peatlands” would be available for cultivation. We note with concern that
there is still no official Government definition of what constitutes ‘degraded’. […]
This is deeply concerning. In our scientific view, habitats being considered ‘degraded forests’,
including disturbed, logged, secondary, and other natural forest types, can be tremendously
important for the protection of biodiversity and forest dwelling peoples, as well as for
combating global climate change. […]
With this perspective in mind, we call on the Indonesian and Norwegian governments to
recognize and reflect in their forest protection agreements that natural forests, even when not in
their primary state, may have high conservation value and are still important for the long-term
protection of Indonesia’s biodiversity and its forest dependent peoples, as well as for combating
global climate change. Indeed, as world attention turns to Cancun, Mexico for the forthcoming
UN climate talks, Indonesia is well placed to set a good example for similar schemes all round
the tropical forest belt, on which the future of our global climate stability depends.

Yours sincerely,

Ian Redmond OBE,
