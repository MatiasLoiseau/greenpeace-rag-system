pg. 4Chapter 1: Introduction Introduction
pg. 5Global warming  is an urgent crisis that demands 
immediate action to prevent climate catastrophe. The 
consequences of inaction are far too great, and the time 
remaining to reduce those consequences is running out. 
The nations of the world will meet this December in 
Copenhagen to negotiate a new international climate 
treaty to improve upon the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Central to the negotiation will be national targets, and ultimately 
a global target, for greenhouse gas pollution reductions.
Simply put, the world must decide how much total 
greenhouse gas pollution will be allowed into the 
atmosphere and then decide each country’s share of 
that total.
Dangerous global warming—by the numbers
Setting a limit on global emissions is the easy part, 
relatively speaking. To prevent catastrophic global 
warming, worldwide average temperatures must remain 
as far as possible below 1.5–2.0 degrees Celsius above 
pre-industrial levels.1,2 To have an approximately 50 
percent chance of keeping warming below 2 degrees, 
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations must 
stabilize below 450 parts per million.3 To stabilize the 
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 
450 ppm, the global “budget” or maximum pollution we 
can allow between now and 2050 is approximately 1,700 gigatons (Gt) carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2eq).
4 A 
Gigaton = one billion metric tons = over 2 trillion pounds.
A more precautionary approach to minimize the risk 
of catastrophic impacts would require that emissions 
be limited still further, and certainly a debate will go 
on about what degree of climate risk is acceptable to 
impose on future generations. Still, establishing an 
overall limit on total global emissions is mostly a ques-
tion of hard science, not much more complicated than the basic points summarized above.
How these total pollution emissions, the rights to pol-
lute, are divided up among nations is a political question, 
not a scientiﬁ  c one, and therefore it is a much more 
difﬁ cult question to answer in a way that is satisfactory 
to all parties.The challenge for world leaders is to agree on national 
limits on global warming pollution that are both fair and 
feasible. If countries are asked to limit emissions to levels 
that seem arbitrary or unfair, then it is unlikely that politicians 
will abide by those limits. If countries are asked to achieve 
reductions that are claimed technically impossible or would 
limit growth in energy consumption below a country’s 
planned or perceived needs, then that too is unlikely to 
succeed. Most nations act ﬁ  rst in their own selﬁ  sh interest, 
which is part of what has stalled international action to 
combat climate change.
Among the primary moral considerations one must account 
for in setting national emissions targets is each country’s 
historical responsibility for creating the problem in the 
ﬁ rst place. Global warming is not a problem that emerged 
overnight. The accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the 
atmosphere has taken decades to reach the crisis point we 
face today.
Historically, no nation has emitted more global warming 
pollution than the United States. Over the past 150 years, 
the U.S. has emitted 328,264 million metric tons of carbon 
dioxide (MtCO2), the primary greenhouse gas, 29% of total global emissions.
5 No other country in the world emitted 
more than 8% of global emissions. China, the second-
leading global warming emitter in the world, trails far behind 
with just 92,950 MtCO2 of emissions over the same time 
frame. This legacy of pollution by industrialized countries 
is the reason that they are obliged to cut emissions before 
developing countries under the UN global warming treaty 
(the Framework Convention on Climate Change.)
Per capita emissions in the U.S. have historically been 
far above most countries in the world as well. In 2005, the 
United States emitted 23.5 tons of global warming pollution 
for every man, woman and child in the country. Only Austra-
lia (26.9), the tiny principality of Luxembourg (27.5), and small, 
oil-producing nations Qatar (55.5), U.A.E. (38.8), Kuwait 
(35.0) and Bahrain (25.4) had greater emissions per capita 
than the United States.6
While much attention has been paid to the rising emissions 
of developing nations like China and India, the per capita emissions in the U.S. and across the developed world still 
far exceed those nations’. U.S. per capita emissions in 2005 
were more than four times greater than China’s (5.5 tons per 
person), and almost 14 times India’s (1.7).Key Findings
This study aims to shed light on the United States’ 
responsibility for taking the lead to solve global warming 
as a result of its outsized role in causing the problem 
in the ﬁ  rst place. Using data from the Carbon Analysis 
Indicators Tool maintained by the World Resources Institute, the analysis examines state-by-state carbon 
dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion from 
1960-2005 and compares those emissions to 184 other 
countries of the world.
Key ﬁ  ndings include:
Historically, no nation has emitted more global • 
warming pollution than the United States. From 
1960-2005, the U.S. emitted 213,608 MtCO2 (Mt = 
Megatons or millions of tons of carbon dioxide), 26% 
of total global emissions. The next biggest polluter, 
China, emitted 88,643 MtCO2 over the same time 
frame, 10.7% of global emissions.
The U.S. also exceeded almost every other nation in • 
per capita emissions. Per capita, the U.S. emitted 720 
tons of CO2 per person per year from 1960-2005. This 
is more than ten times China’s per capita emissions 
(68 tons of CO2) during the same period, and ninety 
times the per capita emissions of Kenya (7.7 tCO2).Even considered individually, the 50 U.S. states are • 
among the nations that are the largest emitters of 
carbon dioxide on earth.
The average U.S. state emitted 4,449 MtCO2 from • 
1960-2005, which would rank 30th among the nations 
of the world.
The top state in total emissions from 1960-2005 was • 
Texas (25,191 MtCO2).
If Texas were its own country, it would rank sixth out • 
of 184 countries in the world in total emissions, trailing 
just China, Russia, Germany, Japan, and the United 
Kingdom.
Texas alone emitted more CO2 than the 122 lowest-• 
emitting countries in the world combined. 
The combined historic emissions of just seven • 
states—Texas, California, Illinois, New York, Indiana, 
Pennsylvania, and Ohio—totalled 96,517 MtCO2, more than any other country in the world, including China 
(92,950).
Vermont, the U.S. state with the lowest emissions • 
since 1960, still accounted for more carbon dioxide 
emissions than 87 nations. 
Only two countries had higher cumulative per capita • 
emissions since 1960 than the U.S.: Estonia (728) 
and Luxembourg (1,251) which is known in Europe 
for its cheap petrol and diesel fuel, leading to inﬂ  ated 
consumption per capita.
The state with the highest cumulative per capita • 
emissions from 1960-2005 was Wyoming, which emitted 3,868 tCO2 per person due to its heavy coal 
mining industry in the Powder River Basin.
The state with the lowest cumulative per capita • 
emissions from 1960-2005, Vermont, emitted 420 tCO2 
per person, more than the per capita emissions of 167 
individual nations.

pg. 6 pg. 7Numerous studies have concluded  that, to minimize the risk of catastrophic global 
warming, worldwide average temperatures should be kept as far as possible below 
1.5-2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.13,14 Further research shows that to 
have an approximately 50 percent chance of keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius, 
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations must stabilize below 450 parts per million 
(ppm). For the chances of keeping warming below these levels to be considered “likely,” 
total greenhouse gases must stabilize at 350-400 ppm or lower. 
To stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in the 445–490 ppm range, 
IPCC estimated that worldwide global warming emissions must fall by 50–85% by 2050 
with global emissions peaking no later than 2015. With prudent assumptions about 
projected emissions in the developing world, IPCC projected that to keep greenhouse 
gas concentrations below 450 ppm, developed countries as a whole would need to 
reduce emissions by 25–40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and by 80–95 percent by 
2050. Again, to ensure the lowest possible degree of risk of catastrophic global warming, 
cuts would need to be even faster and deeper.
Historically, the largest source of global warming pollution has been carbon dioxide 
from fossil fuels. In 2004, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion were responsible for 57% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
15 Carbon dioxide lasts in the atmosphere 
for 50-200 years. Prior to the industrial revolution, concentrations were fairly stable at 
280ppm. Today, they are around 388 ppm, an increase of nearly 40%.16 Average global 
carbon dioxide levels have been measured from the top of Mauna Loa volcano at the 
Earth System Research Laboratory in Hawaii since 1959 when levels of around 315 ppm 
were measured.
Besides fossil fuels, other major global warming pollution sources include CO2 from 
deforestation (17%), methane (14%), nitrous oxides (8%) and ﬂ  uorocarbons (1%). 
Because of the large share of global greenhouse gas pollution that comes from fossil 
fuel combustion, it is essential that any serious effort to combat global warming begin 
with a rapid transition to a clean energy economy powered by clean, renewable energy 
sources like wind and solar.
According to Energy [R]evolution, a recent study by Greenpeace and the European 
Renewable Energy Council based on modeling commissioned from the German Aero-
space Center, currently available technologies enable us to meet the energy needs of a 
growing global economy while cutting global emissions by 57% from current levels by 
2050 and phasing out nuclear power.
Here in the U.S., the report shows that we can cut emissions even faster, eliminating 
83% of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.17 The U.S. scenario shows that it is not only 
possible to cut emissions by these levels, but that the transition to a clean energy 
economy would pay for itself in saved fuel costs two times over by 2030 and create more 
than twice as many jobs.Chapter 2: Global Warming— 
Damage Today, Catastrophe TomorrowDamage Today, Catastrophe Tomorrow
The Scientiﬁ  c Evidence of Human-Caused Global Warming
In 2007, the Nobel Prize -winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the 
scientiﬁ  c body charged by the United Nations with summarizing the best climate 
science, concluded that evidence of the warming of our climate is “unequivocal,” 
ﬁ nding that eleven of the preceding twelve years (1995–2006) ranked among the 
twelve warmest years on record.7 
Among the consequences of global warming detectable today, according to IPCC, 
are more frequent heat waves, heavy precipitation events, and increasing average 
sea levels. The areas affected by drought have increased, while the incidence of 
extreme cold weather days has decreased. Mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined in both the northern and southern hemispheres, and both the extent and 
volume of Arctic sea ice are declining dramatically, putting both wildlife and human 
communities at risk throughout the Arctic.
Most of the observed warming over the last 50 years, IPCC further stated, is “very 
likely” due to human activity, speciﬁ  cally the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse 
gases. By far the largest single source of greenhouse gases is the combustion of 
fossil fuels like coal and oil for energy, which emits carbon dioxide. In 2004, carbon 
dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use accounted for nearly 57% of all global green-
house gas emissions. The second greatest  source, carbon dioxide emissions from 
deforestation, amounted to nearly 20%.
If we do not act quickly to reduce our global warming emissions, IPCC projects 
devastating consequences within the next few decades: up to 30% of plant and 
animal species extinct by mid-century; hundreds of millions of people worldwide 
facing ﬂ  oods, more intense storms, and severe water shortages. Former World Bank 
chief economist Sir Nicholas Stern estimated that global warming could reduce 
worldwide GDP by 20 percent.
8 Indeed, a recent report by World Bank economists 
concluded that just the impacts of increase d storm surges caused by global warming 
could reduce the GDP’s of developing coastal nations by $122 billion.9 
More recent ﬁ  ndings since the publication of the 2007 IPCC Forth Assessment 
report suggest that even more urgent action may be needed. In 2008, for example, 
the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center announced that summer Arctic sea ice 
had reached the second-lowest level ever recorded.10 This observed rapid arctic 
melting is already far outpacing IPCC worst-case scenario predictions: two years 
ago, IPCC projected Arctic sea ice could disappear almost entirely by the later part 
of this century.11 Now, some scientists including NASA’s Jay Zwally predict Arctic 
summers could be nearly ice-free within the next ﬁ  ve years.12 The speed of this loss 
is particularly troubling because, as sea ice vanishes, the Arctic Ocean will absorb 
more energy from the sun, leading to even more rapid sea ice loss, glacial melt and 
sea level rise. This is only one of several potential feedback loops that could cause 
runaway global warming that humans can no longer mitigate.Action Needed to Prevent Catastrophic Warming

Other global warming pollutants  include methane, 
nitrous oxide (N2O), hydroﬂ  uorocarbons (HFCs), perﬂ  uo-
rocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexaﬂ  uoride (SF6). Of these, 
methane and nitrous oxide are the biggest sources of U.S. global warming pollution, accounting for 8% and 4% respectively in 2007. HFCs, PFCs, and SF6 together accounted for 3% in the U.S. These percentages include only those gases being regulated by the Kyoto Protocol international treaty and its successor to be determined in Copenhagen in December 2009. 
In addition, there are many millions of pounds of potent 
CFC and HCFC refrigerant gases and foam-blowing agents that leak from air conditioning and refrigeration equipment and from foam insulation. ‘Freon’ was one trade name for these gases. CFCs came into heavy use in the 1950s and 60s and are now banned from being produced. HCFCs and HFCs were sanctioned as replacements to CFCs to help the ozone layer, but are now heavy contributors to global warming. HFCs were included in the Kyoto Protocol because they are were not being regulated under the Montreal Protocol ozone layer treaty.Chapter 3: Global Warming 
Pollution in the U.S.
Sources of Carbon Dioxide Pollution Other Global Warming Pollutants
The overwhelming majority  of global warming 
pollution in the U.S. comes from burning fossil fuels for energy. In 2007, CO2 emissions from combustion of coal, oil and natural gas accounted for 80% of total U.S. global warming pollution, with total CO2 emissions accounting for over 85% of U.S. global warming pollution. 
Power plants are the nation’s largest source of 
carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption, contributing 42% of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and 34% of global warming emissions overall.
The transportation sector is the next largest source 
of carbon dioxide, contributing 33% of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and 26% of global warming emissions overall.
The remaining 25% of U.S. carbon dioxide emis-
sions from energy sources comes from the direct consumption of fossil fuels in the commercial, industrial, and residential sectors.

This report examines  the cumulative global warming pollution emitted by the United States and more 
than 180 other countries of the world since 1960 in order to more accurately understand each country’s relative degree of responsibility for the global warming problem.
Much recent public attention, especially in the U.S., has been paid to the rising levels of pollution 
in developing nations. For instance, China’s total emissions today now meet or exceed those of the U.S. However, because carbon dioxide lasts in the atmosphere for 50-200 years, we must look back at historical emissions over time to gain a more accurate understanding of the causes of the problem.
While carbon dioxide is not the only global warming po llutant, it is the most important historic global 
warming pollutant, and is therefore a critical point of comparison among nations.
U.S. Far Exceeds All Other Nations in Cumulative Emissions since 1960
Figure 1 shows  the cumulative CO2 emissions from the 20 biggest emitting nations between 1960 
and 2005. The ﬁ  gure clearly shows that since 1960, the U.S. has far exceeded every other nation in the 
world in cumulative carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion.
From 1960–2005, the U.S. emitted 213,608 MtCO2, nearly 26% of global emissions as indicated in 
Figure 2. The next biggest polluter, China, emitted 88,643 MtCO2 over the same time frame, 10.7% of global emissions.
While China currently emits slightly more CO2 per year than the U.S. (China in 2005 emitted 7,219 
MtCO2, compared to 6,963 in the U.S.), it would take almost 500 years for China to catch up to the U.S. in terms of total emissions since 1960, assuming current rates of pollution.
The average U.S. state emitted 4,449 MtCO2 from 1960-2005, which would rank 30th among the 
nations of the world.
The top state in total emissions from 1960-2005 was Texas (25,191 MtCO2) (Figure 3). If Texas were 
its own country, it would have ranked sixth out of 184 countries in the world in total emissions, trailing just China, Russia, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Texas’s emissions were greater than the combined emissions of the 122 lowest-emission countries in the world.
The combined cumulative emissions of just seven US states—Texas, California, Illinois, New York, 
Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Ohio—totalled 96,517 MtCO2, more than any other country in the world, including China (92,950).
Vermont, the U.S. state with the lowest emissions since 1960, still accounted for more carbon 
dioxide emissions than 87 nations (Figure 4).

U.S. Far Exceeds Most Other Countries in Per Capita Emissions
The U.S. not only  far exceeded every other country in the world in total cumulative carbon dioxide 
emissions since 1960, but also exceeded almost every other nation in per capita emissions as well.19 
Per capita, the U.S. emitted 720 tons CO2 from 1960-2005. This is more than ten times China’s per 
capita emissions (68 tCO2) (See Figure 1) during the same time period, and ninety times the per capita emissions of Kenya (7.7 tCO2).
Only two countries, Estonia (728) and the tiny principality of Luxembourg (1,250) emitted more 
greenhouse gases per capita than the U.S. (Figure 5). 
Figure 5Figure 7
Figure 8Figure 6Of the 185 countries studied, 160 nations, about 87% of the world’s population, emitted less than 
half the per capita emissions of the U.S. One hund red twenty-nine nations, 78% of the world’s popula-
tion, emitted less than a quarter as much carbon dioxide per capita as the U.S.
Thirty-eight countries emitted less than 10 tons CO2 per capita over the period studied (Figure 6).

pg. 15 pg. 14Chapter 5: U.S. Climate 
Policy Has Fallen Far Short
1908 to 2008—A Century Wasted
Unfortunately,  the United States’ policy response to 
global warming since 1960 has been neither as consis-tent nor as rapid as the growth in its pollution emissions during the same period. Despite the overwhelming scientiﬁ  c evidence demanding swift action to halt global 
warming pollution, the U.S. Congress and previous administrations have largely failed to rise to the challenge of global warming. To date, global warming pollution remains unregulated at the federal level in the United States and the U.S. continues to lag far behind other industrialized countries (and many developing countries) in responding seriously to the threat.
The ﬁ  rst widely read scientiﬁ  c work suggesting a 
link between global warming and human activity was published more than 100 years ago, in 1908. Following half a century of slowly emerging evidence that the burning of fossil fuels was causing the planet to heat up—accompanied by the simultaneous and massive growth of fossil fuel burning in this country—the federal government ﬁ  rst began funding serious research into 
global warming in the early 1950s. By 1961, the start of the period covered by this report, this research had produced reliable scientiﬁ  c evidence that global levels 
of carbon dioxide were, in fact, increasing due to human activity. By 1967, calculations based on these measure-ments suggested that global average temperatures could rise signiﬁ  cantly over the next century if global warming 
emissions were not curtailed. A decade later, in 1977, the National Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious and respected scientiﬁ  c body in the country, published 
a report conclusively linking energy production and climate change.
In 1981, eight decades after scientists ﬁ  rst illuminated 
the problem, two decades after government research began in earnest, and four years after the NAS report, a young Congressman named Al Gore organized the ﬁ  rst 
Congressional hearing on the issue. Nine years later, Congress adopted the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, giving the President the power to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases for the ﬁ  rst time. 
Despite nearly two decades of increasingly compelling scientiﬁ  c data on the seriousness and urgency of climate 
change, this power has never been used.By the end of the decade, the threat of global warming 
had become a matter of international concern. The ﬁ  rst 
real step in response to this threat came in 1989, when the member countries of the United Nations created a global body of eminent climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to resolve outstanding scientiﬁ  c questions regarding global warming. The IPCC 
has now issued four assessment reports on the state of climate science, its current and projected impacts, adapta-tion to those impacts and mitigation of emissions. In each successive report, the scientiﬁ  c consensus has grown 
stronger with respect both to the profound risks of climate change and the need for urgent global action to curtail those risks. 
In 1992, the international community adopted the ﬁ  rst 
treaty to deal speciﬁ  cally with the threat of global warming, 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This voluntary treaty failed to decrease greenhouse gas emission. Six years later, the parties to this treaty, including the United States under President Clinton, signed the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, making their ﬁ  rst speciﬁ  c commitments to begin reducing their 
global warming emissions. The U.S. signed the Kyoto Protocol despite a pre-emptive strike in the Senate led by a coal-state Democrat and a western Republican who pushed a resolution to block its ratiﬁ  cation. 
Although many of the Senators involved in that measure 
later expressed regret for their decision, the Byrd-Hagel resolution stymied real action on climate change for the remainder of the Clinton Administration. Two years later, President George W. Bush entered the White House. Despite a campaign promise to tackle global warming emissions, the Bush administration quickly reversed course after coming to power. Immediately after taking ofﬁ ce, on the advice of industry lobbyists, Bush withdrew 
the United States from the Kyoto Protocol, bringing international progress on the issue to a standstill. For the ensuing eight years, his administration staunchly rejected mandatory limits on global warming emissions, actively worked to undermine global climate negotiations and opposed domestic policies to promote the development of clean energy, instead pushing energy policy built on increasing production and consumption of oil and coal.In 2007, following years of litigation by twelve U.S. 
states, along with several cities and environmental groups, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency has unambiguous authority to regulate global warming emissions under the Clean Air Act. Despite this mandate, the Bush administration refused to implement the law. 
Although political momentum to act has increased in 
recent years in Congress, the certainty of a Presidential veto made meaningful measures impossible under Bush. Weak global warming bills were introduced in the Senate in 2003, 2005 and 2007, only to be defeated or withdrawn. Like the Senate, the House of Representatives failed to take concrete action during this period. This said, the House side saw encouraging progress in 2008 when 152 representatives endorsed principles, authored by environ-mental champion Representative Henry Waxman, calling for strong climate legislation under the next President. 
Ultimately, however, 2008 ended without meaningful 
action being taken by either Congress or the President to stop global warming. In real world terms, U.S. action to address the threat of climate change has made little progress since that threat was ﬁ  rst identiﬁ  ed more than 
100 years ago.
2009 and Beyond—Time to ActU.S. Climate Policy Has 
Fallen Far Short
The elections  of November 2008 brought a sea change 
in the political landscape in Washington, creating profound new opportunities to respond seriously to global warming for the ﬁ  rst time. Unfortunately, decades of relative inaction 
by the United States—decades in which U.S. greenhouse emissions continued to rise rapidly even as the evidence of global warming impacts became ever more urgent—mean that both the President and Congress must now take quick and dramatic action to reduce emissions and transform our economy in order to avoid climate catastrophe. 
Only ﬁ  ve months into the new Administration, it is too 
early to judge whether our new government will meet the test of climate change. It is a regrettable reality, however, that success or failure in responding to climate change can no longer be measured in years—it must be measured in months. Considered it in its international context, in fact, it will be measured in days.
As its name implies, global warming is a global problem 
that demands a global solution. No country can solve the climate crisis by acting alone. For more than a decade, however, international efforts to solve that crisis together have been stymied by the United States’ refusal to cooper-ate in the international climate negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol. This delay is becoming even more critical because the initial round of pollution reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol will soon expire, and the world must now negotiate a new agreement. Because of our long delay and growing emissions elsewhere, this new agreement must include much steeper reductions than required by Kyoto. The international community has a deadline for reaching that agreement—the UN climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark this December. As this report is being ﬁ  nalized in 
May, there are fewer than 200 days remaining before the start of those talks.
As the country responsible for more than a quarter of 
historic greenhouse gas emissions, U.S. participation—and leadership—is critical to the Copenhagen process. Unless and until the U.S. demonstrates its readiness to make dramatic and rapid reductions in its CO2 emissions, few other countries will be willing or able to make commitments needed to make the Copenhagen talks a success. For this reason, the world is watching carefully every step the U.S. takes—or doesn’t take—with respect to climate change.

pg. 16 pg. 17There have been  some positive signs of progress. In 
his inaugural address, and in many speeches thereafter, President Obama has made a clear commitment to return to the international climate negotiations and to lead both the country and the world in the urgent ﬁ  ght against 
climate change. In some important respects, he has moved quickly to deliver on this promise. The President’s economic stimulus plan invested more than $80 billion in measures to spur development of clean, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, and to make that energy go farther by modernizing the country’s energy transmis-sion system and improving energy efﬁ  ciency. 
The President has called on Congress to bring him 
strong climate legislation to sign, and, more importantly, has demonstrated that he is ready and able to use existing authority to regulate greenhouse gases if necessary. In April, for example, the Obama EPA made a formal ﬁ  nding 
that carbon dioxide emissions pose a danger to human health and welfare, and began a process to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act—nearly two decades after Congress gave it the authority to do so in 1990. 
Similarly, the U.S. under Obama has reengaged the 
international community to seek a way forward on climate policy. In addition to retur ning the US to the UN climate 
talks themselves, President Obama has brought together the world’s biggest polluting countries in an effort to accel-erate those talks. The U.S. has also reached out separately to China to ﬁ  nd ways these two critical countries can work 
together to solve the crisis. As the largest historic emitter and the largest current emitter, respectively, and as lead-ers of the world’s most powerful economies, the U.S. and China are together considered the lynchpin to a successful outcome at Copenhagen. 
Unfortunately, these measures and words still fall short 
of the concrete pollution reduction commitments that must be taken to reach agreement at Copenhagen and avert imminent climate catastrophe. In order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming, the IPCC says that the US and other industrialized countries must reduce their overall emissions of greenhouse gases by 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2020. These countries must also invest the ﬁ nancial and technical resources necessary to help end 
the tropical deforestation that accounts for nearly one-ﬁ  fth U.S. Climate Policy Has Fallen Far Short U.S. Climate Policy Has Fallen Far Short
of global warming emissions, and to help the countries of 
the developing world leap-frog fossil fuels and grow their economies with safer energies that won’t endanger the planet. The necessary actions are described in more detail in Chapter 6.
In all of these respects, the Obama Administration 
has far still to go. While President Obama has pledged to reduce our CO2 emissions, his target would only return the US to 1990 levels by 2020. While no doubt substantial, this target remains far less ambitious than both science and the international community demand. As discussed elsewhere in this report, it is also far less than is already achievable with existing technology.
The story in Congress is similar. Under the leadership 
of representatives Henry Waxman and Ed Markey, a key House committee has brought forward the ﬁ  rst ever climate 
bill with a reasonable chance of passing. Despite Waxman and Markey’s own commitment to strong climate leader-ship, however, their bill has been attacked and undermined by industry lobbyists—and by powerful members of Congress beholden to those industries. As of this writing, the Waxman-Markey bill had been so weakened that, even were it to pass, it would lead to no real emission reduc-tions between now and 2020 and would provide massive subsidies to fund a whole new generation of dirty coal-ﬁ  red 
power plants. This fact has caused even greater concern within the global community that the U.S. will not be ready to make meaningful commitments in time for the Copenha-gen talks. 
While it is tempting to see this as a simple political 
problem, the reality is more stark and more troubling. The impacts of global warming are now all around us. The best available science shows that those impacts are far more 
severe, and are accelerating far more rapidly, than we ever predicted, and that we will soon reach a tipping point beyond which global warming will become uncontrollable and irreversible. It is this reality—the physical reality of global climate science—against which the actions of our government will truly be measured. If they don’t adhere to and respect this reality, compromises that seem politically savvy today will prove irrational and irresponsible in the very near future. For both the President and Congress—and for other leaders in countries around the world—the true test of their leadership will be whether they base their actions on political convenience or on scientiﬁ  c facts.States Take Action to Cut Global Warming Pollution
As the federal government  has largely dragged 
its feet over the last eight years, states in the U.S. have been leading the way to advance renewable and energy efﬁ ciency. Only a handful of states do not have any poli-
cies to promote renewable energy or energy efﬁ  ciency in 
some way. 
In combination with federal tax credits, state 
renewable energy standards (RES) are among the most important factors driving the growth of renewable energy in the United States. RES laws require a speciﬁ  c share 
of electricity to come from renewable sources or that a speciﬁ  c amount of renewable energy capacity is installed 
by a given date. By late 2008, there were mandatory RES laws in 28 U.S. states plus Washington, DC, and 5 additional states had adopted voluntary goals. When fully implemented, state RES laws will affect more than 46 percent of national retail electricity sales and together will require more than 10 percent of electricity in the U.S. come from clean, renewable sources by 2020.
A number of states are also considering Renew-
able Energy Payments (REPs, also known as feed-in tariffs) to assist in meeting state-mandated renewable energy targets. By late 2008, REP legislation had been introduced in six states and under consideration in at least six more. In 2006, for example, California created a renewable energy payment program to support more than 250 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy develop-ment. It has since expanded its REP program to include all customer types and increased the cap to 480 MW. (See below for more on California’s ground-breaking energy policies.)
In addition, 16 states and Washington, DC have Public 
Beneﬁ  t Funds (worth an estimated $6.8 billion by 2017) 
to advance renewables and energy efﬁ  ciency (as well as 
low-income assistance). Funding is derived from a very small per kWh charge on electricity. 
Many U.S. states have also enacted laws that require 
net-metering to allow customers who produce their own renewable electricity to feed their excess electricity into the grid. As of November 2008, net-metering was avail-able in 44 states and Washington, DC.
A number of states have adopted renewable fuels 
standards (RFS) for biofuels. Although most are for ethanol, some require biodiesel blending. For example, Minnesota has enacted a 20 percent by 2015 biodiesel mandate; the legislation requires that 5 percent of the feedstock come from non-traditional state agricultural resources.
Several states have also begun taking steps to regu-
late global warming pollution directly. At least fourteen states and the District of Columbia have adopted tailpipe emissions standards for automobiles. The rule, known 
sometimes as the “California clean cars standard,” will require automakers to reduce the average amount of global warming pollution from their cars, light trucks and SUVs. By 2015, new cars will be required to emit 34 percent and light trucks 25 percent less global warming pollution on average.
Finally, some states have enacted economy-wide caps 
on global warming pollution. In 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law the Global Warming Solutions Act, the ﬁ  rst-ever statewide cap on global warm-
ing pollution. The law will reduce annual global warming emissions in California by 25 percent by 2020 (equivalent to 1990 levels) and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Since then, Hawaii, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington have followed suit, enacting similar statewide caps on emissions.
Several states have also entered into regional agreements 
to cut global warming emissions. For instance, ten states in the Northeast—Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maryland—have agreed to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to cap global warming emissions from the region’s power plants at current levels and reduce them by 10 percent by 2019.
Similarly, in 2007, the governors of Arizona, California, 
New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington announced the Western Climate Action Initiative, which sets a regional global warming emissions reduction goal.
In addition, several states have adopted non-binding goals 
for reducing global warming emissions. For example:
New Jersey in 2007 established a goal to cut global • 
warming emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to 80 
percent below 2006 levels by 2050.
21
Illinois in 2007 announced a statewide goal to reduce • 
global warming emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to 
60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.22
Washington state in 2007 established a statewide goal to • 
reduce global warming emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, 
25 percent below 1990 levels by 2035, and 50 percent 
below 1990 levels by 2050.23
Arizona in 2006 established a statewide goal to reduce • 
global warming emissions to 2000 levels by 2020 and to 
50 percent below 2000 levels by 2040.24
Oregon in 2005 established a statewide goal to reduce • 
global warming emissions to 10 percent below 199025 
levels by 2020 and 75 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
New Mexico in 2005 established a statewide goal to • 
reduce global warming emissions to 2000 levels by 2012, 
10 percent below 2000 levels by 2020, and 75 percent 
below 2000 levels by 2050.262009 and Beyond—Time to Act

pg. 18 pg. 19Chapter 6: The Action Needed to Solve Global Warming
MethodologyReferences
In order to minimize  the risk of catastrophic climate change, the U.S. must move aggressively to cut our own 
domestic emissions by levels consistent with the best climate science. In addition, we must, along with the rest of the developed world, provide the leadership and resources necessary to curb emissions by science-based levels in the developing world while also helping communities adapt to the damage caused by global warming.
Speciﬁ  cally, any minimally adequate U.S. response to global warming climate policy must cut US emissions of 
greenhouse gases at least 25% below 1990 levels by 2020.  
To get to this overall goal, the United States must take two types of action:
Reduce domestic emissions of greenhouse gases through a strong national cap. 01 
Provide signiﬁ  cant ﬁ  nancial support for international action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 02 
  This support must come in addition to—not instead of—reducing emissions here in the United States.
By moving aggressively on both fronts, we can do our part to achieve the goals scientists indicate the developed 
world must reach: cuts in greenhouse gas emissions of 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050.

of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA). EIA’s State Energy Data System (http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/states/_seds.html) provides state-speciﬁ  c data for energy consumption by source from 1960 to 2006.
We then converted those data from British thermal units (Btu) to carbon dioxide emissions using the emissions 
coefﬁ  cients used by EIA in their Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program (http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/
coefﬁ  cients.html). Those coefﬁ  cients are as follows:
Because the State Energy Data System database does not break down coal by rank, we assumed each 
state’s coal mix is equal to the current national mix (approximately 7% anthracite, 50% bituminous, 44% subbituminous, and less than 1% lignite). 
Because EIA’s Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program does not provide emissions coefﬁ  cients 
for asphalt and road oil or lubricants, we assumed 156 pounds carbon dioxide per million Btu. We assumed the same coefﬁ  cient for the petroleum category labeled “other” in the State Energy Data System database.
For national emissions numbers, we used World Resources Institute’s Climate Analysis Indicators Tool 
database (http://cait.wri.org/). Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change, ed. H. J. Schellenhuber, et. al., 2006. http://www.defra.gov.uk/01
