Abstract

Hair analysis provides a historical record of an individual’s exposure to mercury or
methylmercury.  In this study hair analysis of mercury was performed on samples from self-
selected volunteer participants from across the United States.  Participants completed detailed
questionnaires that included questions regarding their level of fish consumption (broken down by
type of fish), as well as age, gender, race, hair treatments, flu vaccinations, and dental amalgams.
The responses to these questions were then related to data regarding hair mercury concentrations
to compare groups of interest and to use in an ANOVA statistical analysis.  Total hair mercury
was found to be significantly associated with age, race, gender, geographic region, and fish
consumption frequency.  The median hair mercury concentration for participants who consumed
eight or more servings of seafood per month (including shellfish) was 0.83 ug/g more than those
who reported consuming no fish, 0.68 ug/g more than those who consumed 1-2 servings per
month, and 0.43 ug/g more than those who consumed 3-7 servings per month.  There was not a
statistically significant difference between the hair mercury concentration of those who had
dental amalgams and those who did not or between those who had had a flu vaccination in the
past year and those who had not, although the difference for dental amalgams was close to being
statistically significant.  Midwesterners had substantially lower median hair mercury
concentrations than those in other regions of the US, even after adjusting for other factors such
as frequency of fish consumption.

1. Introduction

Mercury is an element that cycles through the environment.  It enters the environment naturally
from volcanoes, mineral deposits and evaporation from soil and oceans.  Anthropogenic sources
of mercury such as emissions from coal-fired utility boilers (the largest source), municipal waste
combustion, commercial/industrial boilers, and medical waste incinerators increase the natural
mercury levels in the air, water, and soil7.  Mercury is most often used in alloys, thermometers,
batteries, and dental amalgams because it is the only common metal liquid1.
   There are three types of mercury:  elemental mercury, organic mercury, and inorganic mercury.
Elemental or metallic mercury is the familiar metal liquid in thermometers and is one of the most
common forms found in the environment.  Metallic mercury is also used in silver dental
amalgam fillings which contain approximately 50% mercury1.  Organic mercury compounds are
combinations of mercury with carbon.  Organic mercury takes several forms as some
microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) and natural processes change the mercury in the
environment from one form to another; the most common form being methylmercury.  Inorganic
mercury compounds form when mercury combines with elements such as chlorine, sulfur, or
oxygen; some inorganic mercury compounds are used as fungicides1.
   In the United States, coal-fired utility boilers are the biggest source (33 percent) of
anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere7.  Mercury eventually falls from the
atmosphere or runs off the ground into water (streams, lakes, rivers) and accumulates in the soil
and bottoms of water bodies.  After the mercury deposits into water, microorganisms (bacteria
and fungi) convert it to a form of organic mercury.  Methylmercury, a highly toxic form of
organic mercury, accumulates in the water and is then absorbed by fish and plants near the
source.  This bioaccumulation process continues with levels of mercury increasing as it moves

2

up the food chain8.  Mercury builds up through the food chain until it reaches toxic levels, many
times greater than levels in the surrounding water, in predator animals such as predatory fish and
mammals.8
   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set the Reference Dose
associated with hair mercury concentration at 1.0 µg/g 7.  Mercury is primarily considered a
health risk to children and women of childbearing age because of its effects on brain and organ
development.  Mercury can pass from mother to child through the blood stream or through the
mother’s breast milk1.  The EPA warns, “Offspring born of women exposed to methylmercury
during pregnancy have exhibited a variety of developmental neurological abnormalities,
including the following: delayed onset of walking, delayed onset of talking, cerebral palsy,
altered muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes, and reduced neurological test scores”7.  Mercury
also poses problems for adults.  In general, the nervous system is very sensitive to mercury.
Current studies are also exploring the risks of continuous low levels of mercury exposure in
adults and its effects on brain functions such as memory and attention.  A recent study found no
association between number of dental amalgams, which contain mercury, and cognitive
dysfunction2.  The study did find, however, a linear association between the total number of
amalgams and the urinary mercury concentration2.  Two other recent studies explored the
relation between mercury and the risk of heart problems in men.  One study found a direct
association between the risk of myocardial infarction and mercury3, while the other study’s
results on coronary heart disease were inconclusive9.
   Tests for mercury exposure in humans can be performed using analysis of blood, urine, nail
clippings, or hair samples.  The different analyses provide different information about the
mercury levels in the body.  Blood and urine levels are used as markers to determine if recent
exposure has occurred.  They are more useful for measuring recent exposures to mercury
because blood concentrations decrease rapidly over a few days if exposure is stopped.  Hair
samples are associated mainly with methylmercury exposures and can be used to indicate
exposures that occurred over the past several months or a year.  However, hair concentrations are
not able to detect recent exposures such as a few days prior1.  Mercury is incorporated into hair
during the growth of hair, which is about one centimeter a month7.  Hair is a simpler means by
which to do large studies because the samples are easier to obtain from a large and varied
sampling group.  The cost is also minimized because the hair samples are simply cut from the
subject’s hair and placed in a small plastic bag.  Fewer individuals would be willing to draw a
blood sample or return a urine sample than to provide a hair sample.  The EPA presumes that
hair mercury concentrations reflect blood mercury concentrations at the moment of hair growth7.
A previous mercury-in-hair study conducted during the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) concluded, “Hair Hg [mercury] analysis in national samples of
U.S. children and women of childbearing age provide a useful biomarker for long-term Hg
exposure”4.
  In this study, samples of hair are analyzed from a nationally distributed self-selected sample.
Participants complete a questionnaire about demographic factors and potential exposure to
mercury.  A statistical analysis is performed to relate mercury concentrations in hair to potential
factors such as fish consumption and having dental amalgams.

2. Methodology

Study participants were recruited by Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense
Council and other nonprofit organizations throughout the United States through national internet

3

notices, regional media coverage of the research project, special local awareness events, and
other publicity efforts.  Although the study is on-going, this report is based on the 6,583 samples
obtained from July, 2004 to September, 2005.  The study sample is not presumed to be
statistically representative of the entire U.S. population, since participants were self-selected, and
recruitment of study participants was focused more strongly in some areas of the country than
others.  Particular geographic areas, individuals who might be more concerned about this
particular health issue, individuals with higher-than-average fish consumption, and individuals
better able to afford the small fee to participate in the study are expected to be overrepresented in
the sample.
   Each volunteer was sent a hair sampling kit by the Environmental Quality Institute (EQI)
consisting of gloves, plastic sample bags, labels, a cardboard weighing balance designed to tip
when approximately 0.5g of hair was added, detailed instructions for cutting, weighing and
labeling hair samples, and a return postage-paid mailer.  After washing their hair, each volunteer
participant was instructed (complete with illustrations) on how and where to cut and weigh their
sample.  Each sampling kit also included a detailed research questionnaire which requests
information on age, gender, pregnancy status, hair color, occupation, dental amalgams and
removal, flu shot history, and, several questions regarding specifics of fish consumption habits.
Upon receipt at the EQI laboratory, samples were given a laboratory identification number and
questionnaire data was transferred to a computerized database.  Hair samples were weighed to
the nearest 0.0001 gram on an analytical balance and digested using EPA Method 3050B with
concentrated nitric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide on a SCP Science DigiblockTM graphite
block digestor.  Final volume of the digestate was 50ml.
   Mercury determination was performed using EPA Method 7470A. Either a Thermo-Jarrel-Ash
22 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) or a Thermo Elemental M6 AAS with
a V90 continuous-flow vapor system were used to determine mercury concentration in the
digestates.   Each volunteer participant was sent a confidential letter with their individual results
along with explanatory information regarding USEPA advisory levels.

3. Results

A comparison of the percentage of 16-49 year-old women grouped by total servings of fish
consumption in this study to that in the NHANES study (Table 1) indicates that participants in
this study tend to be greater consumers of fish than in the NHANES study, which came from a
random sample of the U.S. population.  This difference may be due to the fact that participants of
this survey are self-selected but also may be caused at least partially by a national trend towards
increased fish consumption from 1999-2000 to 2004-2005.  Hair mercury concentration data
were summarized by determining the raw medians and the proportions above the EPA’s
Reference Dose of 1.0 µg/g for each age group - gender combination (Table 2).  The 95%
confidence intervals for the medians were calculated using non-parametric confidence intervals
based on ranks.  Because of the potential overrepresentation of heavy consumers of fish in the
current study, medians and proportions represent estimates for a higher-risk group rather than for
the US population as a whole.  The medians indicate that children have approximately half the
mercury concentration levels of the adults.  Also, among the adults, the mercury concentration
levels for the females are lower than for the males.

   Slightly more than 10% of women of childbearing age in the NHANES 1999-2000 study had
mercury concentrations greater than those the RfD of 1.0 µg/g in hair4.  In this study
approximately 23% of 16-to-49 year old women had hair mercury concentrations greater than or
equal to 1.0 µg/g (Table 2).

   An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to examine the relationship between hair
mercury (Hg) and several potential predictor variables and demographic variables.  The
distribution of mercury concentrations was positively skewed, so a logarithmic transformation
was used to improve normality.   Fish consumption categories included: canned tuna servings,
store- or restaurant-bought fish servings, local fish servings.  A standard serving was defined as
six ounces, and fish consumption included shellfish consumption.  Fish frequency data were
grouped into four categories: no fish consumed, fish consumed one or two times per month, fish
consumed three or four times per month, and fish consumed more than five times per month.

5

Age was grouped into five categories: less than or equal to one year, two to five years, six to
fifteen years, sixteen to forty-nine years, and fifty or more years.  Participants’ residence was
grouped by the U.S. Census Bureau’s definition of region6.  Additional variables investigated
included gender, race, pregnancy status, existence of silver dental amalgams, amalgams recently
removed, and recent flu vaccinations.  Other variables involving hair treatments (dyed or
permed) were disregarded because they were found earlier to be non-significant factors and
dropped from the questionnaire.  Due to the large number of potential effects, interactive effects
were not considered.  A check of the residuals for normality in the final ANOVA model yielded
acceptable homoskedasticity, a skewness of 0.22, an (adjusted) kurtosis of 0.80, and normality
tests with p-values less than 0.05.  Thus, the log transform did not completely correct for non-
normality, but did improve normality enough for the large sample hypothesis tests considered
here to be valid.   The reported P-values are two-tailed, and the tests of statistical significance
used α = 0.05.  Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software (Release 9.1, SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
  The ANOVA results for the 3,850 participants with fully-completed questionnaires, indicated
that age category, gender, geographic region, local fish servings, race, store or restaurant fish
servings, and tuna fish servings were all highly statistically significant factors at the 0.05 level
(Table 3).    The factors:  have amalgams, amalgams recently removed, a recent flu shot, and
pregnancy status were not statistically significant in accounting for total mercury concentrations,
although having amalgams (P-value = 0.070) was close to statistical significance.

   The unweighted medians and 95% confidence intervals for each level of each factor considered
were computed using the methodology discussed previously from the raw data.  Each factor was
analyzed separately to include the most number of responses for each question.  Because
participants in this study probably tend to consume more fish than the general public, the
medians are more useful for comparing levels of factors than for estimating representative US
concentrations. Also, because these medians are not adjusted for other factors, the results are not
necessarily consistent with those of the ANOVA model, which does consider statistical
significance of a factor after adjusting each of the levels for other factors in the model.
Therefore, adjusted median estimates, calculated by reverse-transforming the least-square means
from the ANOVA analysis are also provided.  These adjusted medians provide an estimate of
what the median mercury of the given group would be if the individuals in that group were

6

equally divided into the levels of all the other variables considered in the ANOVA model.  In
particular, since the adjusted medians for any group from variables not reflecting fish
consumption would assume equal proportions of individuals in each of the fish-consumption
groups for each type of fish consumption, and the tuna fish and local fish actually had much less
people in the higher groups, then the adjusted medians tend to be higher than the raw medians for
those variables.  Thus, adjusted means are useful only for making comparisons between groups
within a given variable.
  Medians for total fish consumption groups indicate a consistent and strong positive relationship
between mercury in hair and total fish consumption (Table 4).  The median for people that
consume almost no fish is 0.06 ug/g, while the median for those who consume eight or more
servings per month is approaching the 1.0 ug/g RfD for pregnant women.  This striking
difference indicates that fish consumption is clearly the primary source of hair mercury exposure
for most Americans. Medians for the restaurant fish servings per month, tuna fish servings per
month, and local fish servings per month follow the same pattern, although the range in mercury
concentrations between low and high consumption categories is not as great.  This indicates that
statistically there is no segment of the fish consumption sources that does not contribute
significantly to mercury exposure.

  The participants with dental amalgams had an approximately 0.1 ug/g  larger median value than
those without dental amalgams.  The fact that the difference between the two groups is not
statistically significant is consistent with the result that the difference in estimated medians is
only 0.03 ug/g when adjusted for other factors such as fish consumption.  A better idea of the
strength of the relationship between dental amalgams and hair mercury concentration might have
been obtained if the number of amalgams could have been quantified for each participant.
Unfortunately, a large percentage of participants left the number of amalgams question on the
questionnaire unanswered.   Consistent with the ANOVA results medians were approximately
the same between groups for the factors:  amalgams removed recently (last 12 months) and flu
shot recently (last 12 months).
  The Midwest region had the lowest median Hg value, while the West region had the highest
median mercury.  The Northeast and Southeast regions medians were similar.  The median for
Asians was considerably higher than the medians for the other races, while African-Americans
had the lowest estimate.  However, the number of responses for races other than Caucasian was
small.  The medians for pregnancy status were only based on females age 16 to 49 and were also
approximately the same for pregnant and non-pregnant women.
  Summaries of the results for states with at least 100 participants and cities with at least 50
participants are provided in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively.  These summaries reinforce the
findings that mercury concentrations in hair are closely related to seafood consumption.  With
the exception of Utah, whose participants had very high seafood consumption and moderate

8

mercury consumptions, the states that had higher seafood consumption also had higher mercury
concentrations in hair.  New York had the highest hair mercury concentrations, followed by
Colorado, California, Oregon, Florida, Massachusetts and Washington.  A similar pattern exists
for the cities.  The results for two cities stand out.  Masontown PA had a relatively very low
median mercury concentration of 0.08 ug/g.  Masontown is close to a coal fired power plant, but
participants consumed much less seafood than participants at most locations.  This reinforces the
idea that mercury concentrations in hair are caused by consuming food contaminated with
mercury.  New York City has the highest hair mercury concentrations of any city with 50 or
more participants.  The 191 New York City participants had a median hair mercury
concentration of 0.88 ug/g and 47% were 1.0 ug/g or greater.  Their median number of 6 seafood
servings consumed per month was tied the second largest amount.  Other cities with higher-than-
average hair mercury concentrations include Portland, San Francisco, and Seattle.  Except for
San Francisco, which had lower than typical seafood consumption, these cities had the highest
seafood consumption.

4. Summary and Conclusions.

There exists a strong relationship between mercury concentration in hair and seafood
consumption.  In this study, participants who typically consumed 0, 1-2, 3-7, or eight or more
servings of seafood (including shellfish) per month had median mercury concentrations of 0.06
ug/g, 0.21 ug/g, 0.46 ug/g, or 0.89 ug/g, respectively.  In the NHANES 1999-2000 study females
16-49 years of age who had consumed 0, 1-2, or three or more servings of fish (not including
shellfish) per month had geometric means of 0.11 ug/g, 0.20 ug/g, or 0.38 ug/g, respectively.
The results for the lower two groups of each study are very comparable, especially considering
that the NHANES results quoted here included only women aged 16-49 and did not include
shellfish consumption with fish consumption.  The fact that the medians for the upper two
categories in the current study are higher than the geometric mean in the NHANES may be
partially due to those two factors as well as the possibility that participants in the current study in
the 3-7 servings group may be weighted more towards the higher end of the group than those in
the three-or-more group in the NHANES group.  Thus, the current results do not provide
evidence of an increasing or a decreasing trend from 1999-2000 to 2004-2005 in mercury
concentrations for a given amount of fish consumption.  An earlier (1994) study conducted by
Schweinsberg in Germany, of the relationship between fish consumption and mercury
concentration in Germany, found that subjects who consumed 0-400 g, 400-1,000 g, or more
than 1,000 g per month had mean hair mercury concentrations of 0.56 ug/g, 0.94 ug/g, and 1.60
ug/g.5  Converting to 6-ounce servings, the consumption groups would be 0-2.4 servings, 2.4-5.8
servings, and more than 5.8, servings respectively.  Because the mean of the positively skewed
hair mercury concentrations would be expected to be 1.5 to 2.5 times the median or geometric
mean, these results are consistent with those of the current study and the NHANES study, thus
also providing no evidence of a time trend in hair mercury concentrations for a given amount of
fish consumption.
  The current study found very little evidence of a relationship between dental amalgams and
mercury concentrations in hair.  In the 1994 study by Schweinsberg it was found that among

10

individuals who had no fish consumption, individuals with no amalgams had mean blood
mercury concentrations of approximately 0.3 ug/L, while individuals with more than six
amalgams had mean blood mercury concentration of approximately 1.0 ug/L.  In a summary of
several studies, ADSTR estimated the exposure contributions from those with dental amalgams
to range from 3-17 ug/day.1 One possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the
current study and other studies is that the inorganic mercury obtained from dental amalgams
accumulates less in hair and other tissues than the methylmercury obtained from consuming fish.
  Several demographic factors were found to be related to mercury concentrations in hair in the
current study.  One of the stronger relationships is the relationship between region and mercury
concentrations.  The Midwest region has raw median mercury concentrations that are much less
than those for the other regions of the US.  This suggests that sources of mercury exposure other
than fish consumption may be less in the Midwest such as chlor-alkali plants or mines.  Perhaps
the ANOVA adjustment does not fully take out the effect of fish consumption.  It is also possible
that fish consumed in the Midwest tend to be lower in the food chain or that mercury pollution is
less in Midwest water than in other US waters.  Another demographic factor that seems hard to
explain is the higher concentrations in Asians than in other races, even after adjusting for the
level of fish consumption.  There may be similar explanations as those for different regions.
Also, there were not many Asians (n=240) in the current study.  The fact that adults have
substantially higher mercury concentrations than children after adjusting for other factors may
again be partially due to the fact that the statistical adjustments are not perfect or may also be due
to the fact that adults have accumulated a long-term burden that shows up in hair samples.  Men
tend to have higher concentrations than women but the difference in least square medians is only
0.1 ug/g.
  The study described here is an ongoing study.  Periodically, the questionnaire has been revised
to gather more specific information.  Since the beginning of the study, questions have been
added to allow us to break fish consumption down more precisely.  This should allow us to
eventually compare the additional mercury burden caused by consuming different species as well
as to be able to better compare the results of this study to other studies.  As more samples are
received, we should also be able to obtain more precise information about exposure to smaller
subgroups of our sample, such as minority races, pregnant women and young children.
