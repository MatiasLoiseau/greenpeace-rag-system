1Recent Greenpeace investigations reveal that
Wijma continues to buy timber from Liberia,despite numerous written statements that ithad stopped. Profits made by the Liberianlogging industry are used to finance conflicts inthe region. Several Liberian timber companiesare themselves involved in illegal armstrafficking.
2Log ponds (parc à bois) are areas where logs
are temporarily stored prior to their transport.Executive summary
“Wijma operates concessions in Africa and is committed to ensuring full compliance with all
relevant forest regulations.” Wijma website
“Wijma is also committed to achieving environmental best practice throughout its activity
whenever this is practical.” Wijma Environmental policy
In its company literature, the Dutch logger and timber trader Wijma has made many claims
about the environmental and social acceptability of its timber. However, Wijma not onlybuys from some of the most notorious logging companies in Africa
1, but is also itself
involved in illegal logging in Cameroon.
In April 2002, Greenpeace released information about Wijma’s illegal logging activities in
Cameroon. Greenpeace and Forests Monitor released additional information about Wijmalogging illegally in August last year. Wijma claims these cases were isolated incidents.
Yet, in March 2003, researchers from Centre pour l’Environnement et le Developpement
(CED), Forests Monitor and Greenpeace documented further evidence of the company’sillegal activities. The joint field investigations revealed that Wijma has used its legallyallocated cutting permit, VC 09-04-59, to illegally access and log a much larger area, welloutside the official limits of this permit. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) co-ordinates,the investigations have provided evidence of an illegal road network, log ponds

abandoned logs over an area of about 14 km2.Wijma logs on their way to the sawmill. ©GP/OosterveldForest crime file: Corporate Crimes, april 2003

Some of the illegally cut logs were found to have been fraudulently marked with Wijma’s
legal logging title VC 09-04-59, which is a clear method of laundering illegal timber into themarketplace. The investigations also revealed that Wijma’s illegal logging operation was bothdestructive and highly wasteful, causing significant ecological damage. 
Also, it caused significant economic damages to the Cameroonian government, and large
economic and social damages to local communities. Preliminary estimates indicate that theillegally produced timber is worth (FOB value) in the region of  €1,5 million (1 billion
FCFA)
3. Road construction has destroyed agricultural and cash crops of at least 27 local
villagers. These farmers depend upon these plantations for food and cash incomes, and havenot been compensated at all. CED, Forests Monitor and Greenpeace believe that Wijma mustbe held accountable for the damage it has caused, and that the Cameroonian governmentand the local people must be fully compensated.
To this end CED, Forests Monitor and Greenpeace call on:
•The Government of Cameroon – to urgently carry out a detailed inventory to calculate the 
real economic damage this illegal logging operation has caused, to impose adequate sanctions on Wijma, and to ensure full compensation for the local people affected by Wijma’s illegal logging operation.
•The Dutch government and other Wijma customers – to stop buying from Wijma until 
Wijma stops its illegal logging operations, stops buying from known criminals and commits to moving towards certification at least to the standards demanded by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).
•Governments - to adopt green procurement policies. Governments should only buy timber 
from legal forestry operations, which are certified at least to the standards demanded by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).
•The Cameroon and Dutch governments and the European Union - to strengthen legislation 
against illegal logging and the trade in illegal timber, and make sure these laws are fully enforced.

These logging operations areallocated at auction to the highest bidder, and are often exploited in a highlydestructive manner as no management plan is legally required. VC logging titles arewidely abused in Cameroon, and the titles are often used to organise illegal loggingoperations in a much more extensive forest area than is allowed by the legal title.One World Bank financed report revealed that up to 90% of ventes de coupe inCameroon’s East Province are operated illegally.

The Dutch logger and importer Wijma (GWZ) specialises in
highly durable timber for marine engineering projects. Animportant part of Wijma’s trading activity is focused on theAfrican species azobé. Wijma operates one of the world’slargest azobé sawmills, located at the Wijma headquarters inKampen, the Netherlands. The company owns subsidiariesand additional sawmills in Germany, Cameroon, Ghana andIvory Coast, and has sales offices in the US, France and theUK. Wijma has been active in Africa for over thirty years.
Greenpeace first began exposing Wijma’s involvement in
illegal and conflict timber in November 2001. Since thattime, Greenpeace has been involved in ongoing discussionswith Wijma about a number of issues.
Wijma and conflict timber: Liberia 
Timber from Liberia is not produced sustainably. Moreover, the profits made by the Liberianlogging industry have been used to finance conflicts in the region. Several Liberian timbercompanies, such as OTC, are themselves involved in illegal arms trafficking.
5Over the past 
1 1/2 years, Wijma has made several statements about ending its purchases of Liberiantimber in letters to Greenpeace.

• In November 2001, Wijma claims it does not buy from the notorious Liberian 
company OTC. 
• In December 2001, Wijma claims it will stop buying from the company RTC, 
which is linked to OTC.
• In January 2002, Wijma agrees to stop buying from the Liberian companies 
LFCD, MGC and Forum. 
• In April 2002, Wijma claims it stopped buying from OTC, RTC and SMI in the 
late summer of 2001.
• In July 2002, Wijma claims it has stopped buying azobé from Liberia.• In September 2002, Wijma claims it stopped buying timber from Liberia earlier 
that year.
• In March 2003,Wijma claims there are no more wood transports from Liberia 
to Wijma.Wijma statements about ending its purchases of Liberian timberTHE COMPANY GEBROEDERS WIJMA EN ZONEN B.V. (GWZ)

Yet, despite these repeated claims, Greenpeace investigations have revealed that Wijma has
received wood from Liberia several times in 2002, and as late as March 2003. Among thelogging companies Wijma bought from were OTC and RTC. The latest shipment, arrivingon the MV Liski in Nordenham, Germany, in March 2003, came from Inland LoggingCompany. Wood species bought by Wijma from Liberian suppliers are usually Azobé, Aburaand Framiré with occasionally other typical African species like Sipo, Sapelli, and Iroko.While Azobé is used by bridge builders and for marine construction, Abura and Framiré arelargely consumed by the door industry.

trees without authorization and for cuttingundersized trees. In addition, the provincialcontrol brigade of Cameroon’s Ministry ofEnvironment and Forests (MINEF) proposedthat local Wijma director Mr. Bertein shouldpay FCFA 2,500,000 ( €3.750) for transporting
timber without legal documents. Also inJanuary 2002, MINEF notified Wijma’ssubsidiary STIK that all its activities were to besuspended due to the company’s complicity infraudulent logging practices carried out in aforest reserve by the company Helena Bois.See: Greenpeace (April 2002) Wijma:Destroying Cameroon’s rainforests.

Once Wijma’s sawn timber arrives on the
European market, it is impossible for the customerto verify its legality. Logs from legal and illegalsources are easily mixed and could be processedtogether in Wijma’s sawmills in Cameroon or inEurope.

Wijma and Hazim: Cameroon’s most notorious logger
The logging company Hazim has been involved in large scale illegal logging several years.6
After nearly a year of discussions between Wijma and Greenpeace, Wijma finally agreed, in
September 2002, to stop buying from Hazim. It is unclear whether Wijma is keeping thiswritten promise.
Wijma logging illegally in Cameroon
Wijma itself has been involved in illegal logging numerous times. 
In July 2002, Greenpeace and Forests Monitor discovered Wijma logging illegally outside its
vente de coupe 09-02-132. Not only did Wijma destroy a large area of tropical rainforest byits illegal operation, the company also destroyed many farms of the local population. Wijmahas publicly admitted logging outside its legal limits. To this day, Wijma is still not willing topay proper compensation to the local community for its losses.
7
Before this case, Wijma had been caught in the act of committing fraud at least three times.8
On February 3, 2003, the Minister of MINEF suspended all Wijma activities in itsconcession UFA 11-002. The reason for the suspension was the fact that Wijma said it had alocal sawmill, a requirement for attaining a concession. However, at the time Wijma appliedfor the concession, it had already sold its sawmill.

WIJMA LOGS ILLEGALLY AGAIN 
In March 2003, researchers from Centre pour l’Environnement et le Developpement (CED),
Forests Monitor and Greenpeace documented further evidence of the Wijma’s illegalactivities. The joint field investigations have revealed that Wijma has seriously abused itslegally allocated logging title vente de coupe 09-04-59 to log a much larger area. The illegallogging has caused substantial ecological damage.
Wijma was awarded the cutting permit VC 09-04-59 on 21-03-2000.
10The logging area is
located in the department of the Ntem valley (Ambam district) in the South province ofCameroon. Using a GPS receiver
11to record geographic co-ordinates, CED, Forests Monitor
and Greenpeace documented two extensive road networks, 11 log ponds, abandoned logsand stumps over an area of about 14 km2 outside Wijma’s legal VC boundaries (see Map 1). 
East of its vente de coupe, Wijma continued its logging road outside the legal logging area.
The illegal portion of the road, composed of several branches to the north and south, hadbeen hidden by an enormous blockade of abandoned logs. The investigation showed fiveillegal log ponds and a large number of abandoned logs, indicating Wijma logged in theforest surrounding this illegal road. Moreover, south of its vente de coupe, Wijma built awhole illegal road network, starting about 6 km to the south of the VC. Here, theinvestigation showed six illegal log ponds. Only a small river separates the two parts of theillegal logging operation.
Map 1: Wijma’s illegal logging activities

Abandoned logs carrying the markings of Wijma’s vente de coupe 09-04-59 and the
company’s markings (GWZ) were found in log ponds along tracks in both parts of the illegallogging operation, indicating that Wijma had been operating illegally well outside theirofficial limits.
Interviews with inhabitants of the villages surrounding the logging area further indicated
Wijma hired the Cameroon logging company CUF to do the logging. Villagers furtherrevealed that Wijma had cut a range of valuable species such as Azobé, Moabi, Sapelli, and Iroko
12. Villagers said the wood was taken to Kribi, where Wijma has a sawmill. In 
the whole area of the logging operation, large numbers of abandoned logs were found.
These field investigations additionally reveal that Wijma logged inside the unallocated forest
management unit UFA 09-02213
(see Map 1). These findings indicate that Wijma has illegally logged significant amounts oftimber from this unallocated forest management unit. Wijma’s illegal activities are likely tohave seriously undermined the potential for sustainable forestry in this area.
Based on the road network, the log ponds and the abandoned logs that this investigation
uncovered, it is clear that Wijma has carried out an extensive illegal logging operation in thisarea. Calculations, based on Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis and theidentification of illegal logging roads on satellite images, indicate that the area harvested inthis illegal operation by Wijma could be as large as 14 km2 – an additional area about twothirds the size of their existing legal cutting permit. 
Economic losses to the Government of Cameroon
Initial estimates indicate that the volume of Wijma’s timber logged illegally – and launderedinto the marketplace using fraudulent markings – may total around 9,800 cubic metres, withan estimated FOB value of nearly 1 billion FCFA ( €1,5 million)
14. On top of the lost timber
value, there are additional losses worth tens of thousands of euro’s in tax revenues that theCameroon government has not received. For example, stumpage fees at 2.5% of the FOBvalue of cut timber are among a number of taxes that are due on legally cut timber.
These calculations have been based on the following assumptions:
•that Wijma has logged illegally at least 14 km2 (1400 hectares) of rainforest;
•that on average, one hectare of forest yielded seven cubic metres of timber
15;
•that the average FOB value of Cameroon timber is 100,000 FCFA ( €150) per cubic meter.notes

14These are only estimates of damages. 
A further, more detailed assessment byCameroon forestry officials will be necessaryin order to estimate the real value of thestolen timber.

In addition to its ecological damage and economic implications for the Cameroonian
government, Wijma’s illegal logging operation has also caused severe economic damagelocally, and many farmers interviewed expressed great anger regarding the destruction Wijmaand its subcontractor CUF have caused to the forest and to their agricultural crops. 
In areas where Wijma was cutting illegally, the road construction and logging have destroyed
numerous agricultural crops and the small-scale plantations owned by the local farmers. Atleast 27 farmers in three different villages (Ngom, Biyii, and Meyo-Elie, See Map 1) havebecome victims of Wijma’s logging operation, losing both food crops such as manioc andplantains, and small scale cash crops such as cocoa. The direct damage to people’slivelihoods caused by the destruction of local farmers’ fields was considerable, since thefarmers depend upon their plantations for food and cash incomes. The son of one localfarmer said he had not been able to go to school in the year his father’s plantation wasdestroyed, because his father was not able to pay the school.
Dutch forestry companies in Cameroon, including Wijma,
have specialised in the production of Azobé, a species highlyprized in the Netherlands for marine construction, and,throughout Europe, for the fabrication of railroad ties. Withmarkets world-wide, Wijma is an extremely important player. 
The, for a vente de coupe required, 10% of the annual forestry fee was never paid to the
villages. Farmers who had their crops destroyed by Wijma’s logging operation have receivedno compensation at all. Also, Wijma promised the local people a school and wells fordrinking water. The school was not built to the promised standard and the wells were neverbuilt at all. The fourth village, Mfoulekok, where the illegal logging road entered the forest,never received the money promised.
In Europe, Wijma presents its African logging operations as a positive contribution towards
development and poverty alleviation for the local population. However, this case studyclearly illustrates that Wijma’s illegal logging operation is, in fact, impoverishing thelivelihoods of the local people. CED, Forests Monitor and Greenpeace are calling on Wijma’sEuropean management to accept full responsibility for the damage caused to the livelihoodsof the local farmers, and to organise full and fair compensation for the victims.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
CED, Forests Monitor and Greenpeace recommend that:
•MINEF16urgently conducts an official investigation into this case, assessing the 
ecological, social and fiscal damages;
•MINEF holds the company fully accountable for the ecological, economic and social 
impacts of its illegal logging operations and ensures payment of all fines and taxes to the government and full compensation for the local communities;
•MINEF prohibits Wijma from receiving further logging permits until they can demonstrate 
they are willing to operate within their legal obligations;
•Wijma provides immediate and adequate compensation to the local communities for the 
damages caused to their livelihoods by this and earlier operations;
•The Dutch government and other Wijma customers stop buying from Wijma until Wijma 
stops its involvement in illegal logging operations, stops buying from known criminals and commits to moving towards certification at least to the standards demanded by the Forest Stewardship Council;
•Governments adopt green procurement policies. Governments should only buy timber 
from legal forestry operations, which are certified at least to the standards demanded by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC);
•The Cameroon government establishes a clear procedure for processing and acting upon 
third party findings of illegalities in the forestry sector in a rigorous and transparent manner; 
•The Cameroon and Dutch governments and the European Union strengthen legislation 
against illegal logging and the trade in illegal timber, and make sure these laws are fully enforced.
