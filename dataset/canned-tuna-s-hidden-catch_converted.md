TINNED TUNA IN THE UK
The UK is the second highest consumer of tinned tuna in the world, consumming the
equivalent of more than 700 million tins of tuna in 2006 alone.2 Retailers and suppliers in this
country must therefore take considerable responsibility for the environmental consequences
of current fishing practices for tuna.

Fishing practices used by the global tuna industry are contributing to the sharp decline of
populations of sea turtles, sharks, rays and other marine animals. Marketing campaigns
attempt to make tuna fishing look like a quaint cottage industry, but the truth is that the tuna
trade is all about big business.

Tinned tuna is worth around US$2.7 billion per annum worldwide.3 Suppliers Princes
(owned by Japanese multinational Mitsubishi) and John West (owned by private equity
firm MW Brands) dominate the UK market:
x John West accounts for 31.3% of the standard tinned tuna market value in the UK and

27.7% of the volume.

x Princes are the second biggest with a 27.1% market value and 24.9% volume share.4

The tuna industry has taken action in response to consumer pressure to ensure that virtually
all tinned tuna in the UK is dolphin friendly, but this alone is insufficient to ensure that the
industry is sustainable in the long term. Many fishing practices that are labelled dolphin
friendly still result in the catch of a host of non-target species, known as bycatch, including
turtles, sharks, rays, juvenile tuna and a huge range of other marine life.

Worldwide, up to 90% of stocks of large predatory fish
have already been wiped out.5

We can only protect marine ecosystems and guarantee continued supply of fish like tuna by
changing the way oceans are managed. This change needs to incorporate major alterations
to fishing practices and setting aside large areas as marine reserves – national parks at sea –
where no fishing takes place. The creation of a large scale network of marine reserves is now
widely recognised as essential by marine scientists but they currently cover less than 1% of
the world’s oceans.6

DWINDLING TUNA STOCKS
What we call tuna is really a number of different predatory fish of varying colours and sizes,
widely distributed across the oceans of the world. Most tinned tuna sold in the UK is a small
species called skipjack, though the larger, more commercially valuable yellowfin and albacore
tunas are also sometimes sold in tins. Yellowfin is the main type of tuna sold fresh by retailers.

Years of being badly managed and over fished has left tuna stocks in crisis. Of the 23
commercially exploited tuna stocks identified:
x At least nine are classified as fully fished
x A further four are classified as overexploited or depleted
x Three are classified as critically endangered
x Three are endangered
x Three are vulnerable to extinction.8

All 23 stocks are heavily fished and in 2007 the overall global picture was characterised
by declining catches. Even previously healthy fisheries are now under pressure. Worldwide,
yellowfin stocks have now reached a state where over fishing is suspected to be occurring
in all oceans with many stocks in serious decline.9 Without more effective management of
tuna fishing, even stocks of the healthiest remaining species, like those of skipjack – the least
valuable tuna – risk collapse.

A GROWING FAD
The majority of tinned tuna is caught using fish aggregation devices (FADs) which use floating
objects to encourage tuna to gather in particular locations and then scoop them up in huge
nets known as purse seines. But FADs do not just lure the tuna that fishermen want to catch.
On average, every time a FAD is used, for every 10kg of catch, 1kg will be unwanted,
consisting of juvenile tuna, turtles, sharks, rays and a wide variety of other species.10
Scientific research from 2005 concludes that the total bycatch from the use of FADs
amounts to 100,000 tonnes every year.11

FADs act as death traps for young tuna. According to the University of Hawaii’s pelagic fishing
program, FADs fished by purse seine nets are considered a major contributor toward yellowfin
and bigeye stocks being pushed towards depletion.12 The over fishing of both bigeye and
yellowfin is exacerbated by the number of juveniles of both species that are killed as bycatch,
including in fisheries where the target species is actually skipjack. Given that yellowfin and
bigeye are of high commercial value, it is not only environmentally destructive, but also short
sighted in economic terms to be killing their young, especially in the pursuit of less valuable fish.

There is growing evidence that FADs seriously disrupt the life cycles of even those tuna that
are not caught. In May 2008, scientists reported that FADs appear to pull tuna and other fish
away from their migratory routes, causing them to become undernourished, with potentially
serious broader ecological consequences.13

Despite all this, purse seine fishing with FADs has expanded considerably in recent years and
currently accounts for about 70% of reported tuna catches.14

‘I am concerned that the
capture of juvenile individuals
of large tuna species such as
bigeye and yellowfin as a result
of the indiscriminate nature of
floating fish aggregation devices
(FADs) is impacting significantly
on the productivity and
ultimately the long term
sustainability of these species.’

Sustainability at the Foodvest
Group (including Youngs and
Findus)

THE END OF THE LONG LINE
Long lining involves setting out a length of line of up to 100km in length, to which numerous
shorter lines of baited hooks are attached. As long lining is generally targeted at only more
commercially valuable tuna species, it is only likely to be used for fish at the higher end of the
tinned tuna market. A number of measures can be used to minimise the impact of long lining,
but take up of these has been varied and long lining remains responsible for the deaths of
turtles, seabirds, sharks, rays and billfish in large numbers.15

KILLED FOR TINNED TUNA
Turtles
Six of the seven sea turtle populations worldwide feature in the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and all five Pacific sea turtles
are listed as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable. Among the most dramatic
declines have occurred in the Pacific Ocean, where nesting populations of leatherback turtles
have plunged by over 95% in the last three decades and loggerheads by 80–86% over a
similar period.17 Fishing with FADs may cause severe problems for local populations of
turtles18 while research indicates that thousands of marine turtles die each year in long lines
in the Pacific Ocean alone.19

Sharks and rays
Sharks and rays are being killed in massive numbers by tuna fishing. More than three quarters
of the oceanic pelagic shark and ray species are now classified as threatened or near
threatened by the IUCN. Many of these species are caught regularly in purse seine nets
targeting tuna.20 Cutting fins off sharks, often while they are still alive and then throwing
them back in the ocean is also common practice on tuna fishing boats. The fins can be sold at
top prices in countries where shark fin soup is a delicacy. In the central Western Central Pacific
Ocean, total shark mortalities have been estimated at 500,000 – 1.4 million sharks annually
based on observer data from long line fisheries.21

For each 1,000 tons of yellow
fin tuna caught in FAD sets over
three years, fishermen caught
nearly 111,000 other individual
animals, including sharks, rays,
marlins and sea turtles.22

A DOLPHIN FRIENDLY LABEL IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF
SUSTAINABLY FISHED TUNA
Virtually all tinned tuna sold in the UK is certified by the Earth Island Institute (EII) as dolphin
friendly or dolphin safe.23 The EII was one of the organisations to pioneer dolphin safe
certification in response to the setting of tuna fishing nets on schools of dolphins. This
certification demonstrates that the tuna industry is able to respond to environmental
concerns. There should be no relaxation of such standards, but they need to be expanded
so that other marine life is also safe from tuna fishing.

The Friends of the Sea certification scheme is now beginning to certify some skipjack tuna
fisheries. While the scheme claims to deal with wider sustainability issues connected to tuna
fishing, it does not take into account the impacts of purse seine fishing with FADS and has
started to certify fisheries where over fishing is acknowledged to be taking place.

‘The real problem is giving
ourselves high fives for solving
the tuna dolphin problem
when we’ve just created
other problems.’24

TIME FOR CHANGE
The fishing industry must stop using FADs and all purse seine and long line vessels must
have observers on board 100% of the time to make sure they use all possible means to
reduce bycatch.

Industry must move towards the best methods of catching tuna by prioritising pole and line
and trolling. These methods of catching tuna are already in use in various smaller fisheries and
are highly targeted towards adult tuna, avoiding the bycatch associated with other methods.
These fisheries are also more likely to support locally based industries in developing countries.

Governments must cooperate to establish marine reserves to make large areas of the world’s
oceans off limits to fishing. There is overwhelming scientific consensus that a large scale
network of global marine reserves is needed to safeguard the world’s marine ecosystems
from destructive fishing practices. Greenpeace is calling for 40% of the world’s oceans to be
protected as marine reserves.

Some progress was made earlier this year when Pacific Island Nations declared that areas in
the Pacific Commons – high seas between the islands with abundant tuna and other marine
life – should be off limits to fishing. Making tuna fishing sustainable is critical not only to the
environment, but also to the economic future of the Pacific Island Nations. At the moment,
the Pacific Island Nations get too little of the economic benefit from adjacent waters that are
mainly being exploited by long distance fleets from deep water fishing countries. Marine
reserves over the Pacific Commons will not only allow fish stocks to recover, but could also
provide a boost for developing economies in the region.

Strategically placed marine
reserves can benefit migratory
species like tuna by improving
habitat quality and feeding
opportunities, allowing greater
survival of offspring, and
providing protection at
aggregation sites and migration
bottlenecks.27

WHAT SUPERMARKETS AND TUNA BRANDS CAN DO
Around 70% of tinned tuna in the UK is sold in supermarkets, so the action of major
retailers and tuna brands can help transform this trade.25 Retailers and tuna bands must:

2 Stop buying tuna caught using FADs

By rejecting tuna from purse seining with FADs, retailers can encourage best practise
in the tuna fishing industry.

2 Only purchase tuna caught using sustainable catch methods

The Co-op and Sainsbury’s have already moved their sourcing towards pole and line
fisheries for tinned tuna.26 Other UK retailers and tuna brands must now follow suit by
prioritising tuna caught by low impact methods like pole and line and trolling. If buying
tuna caught using purse seine nets, independent verification must be available to show
that FADs have not been used.

2 Support the creation of marine reserves

UK retailers and tuna brands should publicly support the call for the Pacific Commons to
be protected by designated marine reserves as part of a large scale global network of
marine reserves and ensure they are not selling any tinned tuna caught in the area.

By changing the way tinned tuna is caught and setting up marine reserves – where ocean
ecosystems are protected and where fish stocks can recover from over fishing – we can
bring an end to the damage that current tuna fishing practices cause to the marine
environment.

THE SOLUTIONS EXIST, BUT WE MUST ACT NOW

TIME AND TUNA ARE RUNNING OUT.
