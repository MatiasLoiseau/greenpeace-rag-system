SINAR MAS: Indonesian Palm oil menace

One of the growing new threats to Indonesia’s forests is the ‘gold rush’ for new oil palm
plantations, driven by the increasing global demand for palm oil for food, soaps, cosmetics and
biofuels. Indonesia, the world’s largest palm oil producer,1  has the fastest deforestation rate of
any major forested country.2

Forest destruction is responsible for about one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions.3 The
conversion of its forests into plantations is the leading contributor to Indonesia’s greenhouse
gas emissions, and makes it the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world4.

The Sinar Mas Group

Sinar Mas Group is Indonesia’s largest palm oil company5 and boasts of ‘aggressive plantation
expansion’.6 It has grown its palm oil plantation area by over a third in the last 2 years and has
further expansion plans in Kalimantan and the largely untouched provinces of Papua7, where it
plans to develop a rainforest area of up to 2.8 million hectares.8  Judging by past operations and
known concessions that Sinar Mas holds, the vast majority of future expansion is likely to
involve deforestation, some on peatlands and in the habitats of the critically endangered orang-
utan.

Sinar Mas is also heavily involved in the pulp and paper industry through its subsidiary, Asia
Pulp & Paper (APP). APP has extensive plantation areas on peatlands9 and in 2007 was found
to be buying illegal timber originating from a peatland area in Riau Province, Sumatra.10 The
peat in this area was more than 4 metres deep, which is illegal to develop, clear or drain under
Indonesian law.11 It is also illegal to buy timber from such areas.12 Investigations by WWF in
2007 uncovered illegal logging by APP in Jambi Province, Sumatra.13

Sinar Mas exported over 1 million tonnes of palm oil products in 2007.14 India and China
accounted for nearly half of all exports, while 200,000 tonnes were shipped to Italy, the
Netherlands, Germany, Spain and the UK.  Sinar Mas supplies Nestlé15 and Wilmar16 and,
according to data published in November 2007, its customers include Unilever, Proctor &
Gamble, Henkel, Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Burger King, Danone, AAK and Cargill17.

Sinar Mas is a member of the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a voluntary
industry initiative aimed at developing a certification system for the production of sustainable
palm oil based on principles and criteria. There has been much criticism of this body and in
particular the fact that its members, including Sinar Mas, continue to destroy rainforests and
peatlands. Sinar Mas has yet to get any of its plantations certified.

Ongoing forest destruction:

Recent Greenpeace research shows evidence of Sinar Mas continuing to destroy Indonesia’s
forest in Papua, Kalimantan and Riau province.

Papua

During the Greenpeace ship Esperanza’s “Forest for Climate” tour of Indonesia in October and
November 2008, Greenpeace uncovered fresh evidence of ongoing clearing of forest for oil palm
plantations in the Lereh region near Jayapura, the provincial capital of Papua province.
Greenpeace’s investigation team also found evidence of land burning to prepare the land for oil
palm plantations, which is illegal under Indonesian law.18

The forests of the Lereh region
contain a wealth of primary sago
and nipah plants, daily necessities
of life for local communities. Sago is
the staple food of Papua’s people
and is an essential source of daily
nutrition, and nipah is used in home
building. The destruction of these
forests will result in the destruction
of the communities that depend on
them for their livelihoods.

Seven oil palm plantations owned by
the Sinar Mas Group, and still
largely undeveloped, are located in
the immediate vicinity of the Danau
Sentarum National Park (West
Kalimantan), an International
Wetland Site under the Ramsar
Convention with an area of 132,000
hectares. Some of the concessions
back directly onto the Park’s border.

October 2008. When speaking with Greenpeace, the director of the National Park, Mr. Soewigno,
raised serious concerns about the development of oil palm plantations by Sinar Mas and other
operators, as he fears the clearing and planting is damaging the flora, fauna, and other habitats in
the lake area, as well as impacting the livelihood of fishermen. Along with community members, he
also worries about the effects of the plantations on the Park’s fishery, including the contamination of
water sources from the residues on cut timber as it is transported downriver. Fishing is Danau
Sentarum’s key industry, supplying valuable protein to much of West Kalimantan and providing
livelihoods for communities in the National Park.

Sumatra (Riau Province)

Greenpeace discovered fresh forest clearances in APP pulpwood concessions in the peatland
forests of Riau in November 2008.19 On the island of Sumatra, millions of hectares of peatland
forests have already been cleared, or are earmarked to be converted into oil palm and pulp and
paper plantations. APP is the largest holder of concessions in Riau Province, with over 800,000
hectares.20 Riau’s Kampar Peninsular contains some of the largest remaining intact peatland
forests in Sumatra, which are currently being drained and cleared for industrial expansion by
companies including APP. Kampar consists entirely of a single peat dome, with peat depths mostly
over 10 metres -- extremely deep, forming an enormous store of carbon. As the peat is thoroughly
waterlogged, with water content up to 90% or more, drainage and plantation development in one
area of the landscape will have widespread detrimental impacts on the remaining natural forest. 21

The development of APP’s concessions will lead to huge greenhouse gas emissions through the
degradation of the carbon-rich peat, and also to massive biodiversity losses. The Kampar
peninsular is home to a rich biodiversity, including the Sumatran elephant, and is a last stronghold
of the Sumatran tiger. Many local communities are also threatened through loss of traditional
means of food collection and displacement.

Greenpeace is calling for a moratorium on all further forest and peatland
destruction.

Sinar Mas must commit to no further deforestation for palm oil and pulp and paper and
immediately stop further forest destruction.

The Indonesian government must:

-  implement an immediate moratorium on further deforestation and peatland clearance

-  not allocate any more concessions of forested estate for conversion

- revoke those concessions on forested estate that have been allocated but not yet been
cleared.

Companies who use palm oil in their products must stop buying palm oil from companies such
as Sinar Mas that are engaged in deforestation and peatland degradation.
