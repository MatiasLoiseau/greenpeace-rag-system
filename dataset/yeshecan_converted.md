Yes He Can:
How President Obama Can Solve the Energy Crisis, Help Reverse Climate Change and Rescue the Economy

This December, leaders from around the world will gather in Copenhagen to negotiate a new
global treaty at the United Nations Climate Summit. President Obama has pledged that the US
will lead on climate and energy, noting in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that,
“We must seize the opportunity to make Copenhagen a significant step forward in the global fight
against climate change.”i

This briefing aims to highlight some of the key areas where the climate legislation in Congress
falls short and outlines how Obama and the US can do more to deliver deeper emission cuts by
harnessing the potential of renewable energy and energy efficiency. With the start of the Copen-
hagen Summit set to start in early December, Greenpeace and the rest of the world watches and
waits to see if this really “is a new day… a new era”ii  on climate change and if Obama is the leader
he has promised he would be.

Leadership means guiding the world toward a means a strong, legally binding climate agreement.
Failure to agree risks locking the planet into catastrophic, irreversible climate change. An effective
deal would include:

1. A commitment from developed countries to reduce their collective emissions

by at least 40% by 2020 (from 1990 levels).

2. The creation of a global fund that will invest at least $140 billion a year

in developing countries to adapt to climate change, switch to renewable
energy and stop deforestation.

3. Ending global deforestation by 2020.

2009—A lost year for the climate?

Under President Obama leadership, the US is a long way from fulfilling its commitment
to dramatically slash greenhouse gas emissions. The incremental progress achieved by the
Administration with the January stimulus package investments in renewable energy and energy
efficiency and the improved fuel economy standards for new cars and trucks are great first
steps; however, they are far short from the transformational change the president’s principal
climate adviser, Todd Stern, says is needed to tackle climate change and keep temperature rise
as far below 2 degrees as possible. iii

In his presidential campaign, Obama assured Americans he would be a leader on climate
policy. However, in the run up to Copenhagen, he has punted climate leadership to Congress,
which has stalled out domestic policy and drastically lowered the bar for the country’s position
in international negotiations. This inaction by the president comes despite the fact that he has
both the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act and an admit-
ted moral responsibility to commit the US to an international agreement on climate change.

US climate legislation fails to deliver

An electric utility burning coal will not have
to reduce the emissions at the plant site. It
can just keep burning coal,iv

I won’t vote for any climate change bill that
doesn’t allow a dramatic increase in nuclear
power. I’m not going to vote for any climate
change bill that doesn’t allow us to use our
coal deposits.v

—Rep. Rick Boucher (D)-VA referring
to the offset provisions in ACES

     —Senator Lindsey Graham (R)-SC

In June of this year (2009), the House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy
and Security Act (ACES) and the Senate is currently debating a similar bill, entitled the Clean
Energy Jobs and American Power Act (CEJAPA). Unfortunately, these pieces of legislation do
less to tackle climate change than they do to support the pollution-as-usual framework that is
at the heart of the problem.

Both domestic bills reflect the lobbying dollars spent by corporate interests to prevent mean-
ingful action and make sure the US remains addicted to fossil fuels. If enacted, these bills will
yield emission reduction of only 4–7% by 2020 (from 1990 levels). This is nowhere near what
science says is needed and miles away from what the US is capable of achieving. It is no
secret that ACES, and its Senate counterpart, are a source of international disappointment
and will handicap America’s ability to provide global leadership in Copenhagen and beyond.

Granted, this should come as no big surprise when you consider
the power and influence corporate interests have had in drafting
the bill. An analysis conducted by the Center for Public Integrity
reveals that of the more then 1,150 companies and advocacy
organizations lobbying Congress on climate change, the sectors
with the biggest army of lobbyists are manufacturing, power
companies and utilities and oil and gas.vi

Fossil fuel companies and industry front groups, in particular, have
spent enormous sums of money to make sure Congress doesn’t
take legitimate action to curb global warming pollution.

In the first half of this year alone, American Electric Power, the
American Petroleum Institute and the American Coalition for
Clean Coal Electricity spent $4.79 million, $4.10 million and
$1.22 million, respectively lobbying members of Congress.vii

In House legislation, the end result of this corporate campaign
against the climate was a bill that only reduces emissions 4% by
2020 (compared to 1990) and awards billions of dollars worth of
free permits for to the corporate polluters that largely drafted the
bill. Fifty two percent of these allowances go to utility and fossil
interests while only 6% go toward renewable energy and energy
efficiency.viii The current version of the legislation in the Senate is
only slightly better. If enacted, it will reduce emissions 7% by 2020
(compared to 1990) but, in some respects, is tilted even more
heavily in favor of fossil fuels.

Obama must deliver more than 4–7%
emission reductions by 2020

Historically, no nation has emitted more
global warming pollution than the United
States.x The US response to climate change
will continue to lack credibility as long as
the country shirks its moral responsibility to
step up to the plate and deliver. Considering
the commitments that other countries have
put on the table—25% emission reductions
(compared to 1990) by 2020 in Japan, as
much as 30% emission reductions (compared
to 1990) in the European Union and 40%
emission reductions (compared to 1990) by
2020 in Norway—the 4–7% in the US climate
legislation simply fails to pass muster.

Our generation’s response to this challenge
will be judged by history, for if we fail to
meet it — boldly, swiftly, and together —
we risk consigning future generations to an
irreversible catastrophe.ix

—President Obama
at the UN General Assembly

It is likely that between 2007 and 2009 US emissions will have already declined
9%, due to a variety of factors including growing deployment of renewable energy,
increased energy efficiency and slower than expected economic growth resulting from
the financial crisis.xi By implementing comprehensive climate policy now, the US can
ensure that this emission trend continues. What’s more, a strong federal climate policy
will also help the economy get back on its feet. A recent report from the University of
California—Berkley shows that under comprehensive energy and climate policy, the US
could gain 918,000 to 1.9 million jobs and grow household income by $488 to $1,176
by 2020.xii

The notion that the Legislative Branch has the corner market on climate policy is false
as is the presumption that Obama cannot sign an international agreement without
Senate pre-ratifying it. Under the Clean Air Act, President Obama has the authority to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions as well as to implement an executive agreement
at the international level.xiii That means that when it comes to Copenhagen, treaty
ratification by the Senate is not a prerequisite for the US to participate in an international
climate regime. As noted in a report by the New York University Law School’s Center
for Policy Integrity, “Under either ‘sole-executive authority’, or pursuant to provisions
of the Clean Air Act, the President has the power to enter into an international climate
regime—the participation of the United States in international climate negotiations need
not wait for approval of Congress.” xiv

Congress so far has been incapable of delivering policy that protects the climate and
puts clean energy at the top of the agenda. Fortunately, Obama can nonetheless sign a
strong agreement in Copenhagen.

Renewable energy can deliver more than 4–7%
emission reductions by 2020

Despite having “clean energy” in their titles, the renewable energy requirements in the climate
House and Senate bills do not contain adequate funding for renewable energy development
and deployment. Renewable energy currently accounts for 8.4% of the nation’s electricity.
xv The renewable electricity standards in both versions strive for little more than that: ACES
establishes a renewable electricity target of only 10% by 2020 while the Senate bill essentially
requires nothing more than we have already achieved.xvi

Notably, these targets will be quickly surpassed simply by the provisions already set by state
governments and private enterprise.xvii Additionally, Asian country’s have commitments to
invest over $500 over the next 5 years on clean energy research and deployment. xviii The US
lack of ambition is unjustified in light of the numerous studies that how the US could easily
achieve more:

Wind energy potential— Despite being one of the most widely available energy
resources across the country, wind only comprises a slightly more than 1% of US
electricity. xix A study commissioned by the US Department of Energy (DOE) details how
the country could meet a 20% by 2030 wind energy target and reduce cumulative CO2
emissions by 7.6 gigatons in the process.xx

Solar energy potential— Resource calculations show that the US Southwest could
provide more than 7 million MW of solar generating capacity—roughly 10 times the total
US generating capacity from all sources today. A study by the American Solar Energy
Society estimates that in combination, concentrated solar power and photovoltaics could
cut CO2 emissions as much as 466 million tons per year by 2030.xxi

Geothermal potential— This dependable baseload power source has a stable
cost and can be harnessed to provide both heat and electricity. The Geothermal Energy
Association estimates that by 2025, US geothermal resources could provide more than
30,000 MW of power, enough to meet 6% of today’s electricity demand.xxii

Hydropower— Water power accounts for 7% of US electricity generation.xxiii The
DOE notes that this contribution could readily be doubled. For example, simply by
improving existing projects and installing generators at dams that do not have them, an
additional 21,000 MW of capacity could be added.xxiv

page 6

The potential for renewable energy technologies to curtail CO2
emissions is vast. A 2007 study by the American Solar Energy Society
outlines how deployment of a suite of clean energy technologies would
cut US emissions by 1.9 gigatons by 2030—more than 15% of current
annual US emissions.xxv What’s more, other renewable energy forms,
such as marine (wave and tidal) power, are nearing commercialization.
When they become available, their deployment could allow the US to
cut emissions even further and repower the economy even faster.

Issues related to the intermittency of some renewable energy sources
need not stand in the way. By combining different renewable energy
projects with complementary intermittencies, stable power can be
delivered to the electricity grid. Case studies show how states such as
California, could meet 80–100% of the electricity demand by 2020 with
such approaches.xxvi Countries such as Norway, Denmark and New
Zealand already derive a significant proportion of their electricity from
renewable sources.

Yet even though a clean energy future is within our reach, the govern-
ment must choose to set us on that path. Political will and special
interests, not technical feasibility, are now the hurdles that must be
overcome. As noted in a recent study from Stanford University, if the
global political will existed, the technology exists to power our planet
with 100% renewable energy by 2030. xxv ii

While both versions of the climate legislation give a nod to energy ef-
ficiency, they are a long way off from capturing its full potential. A study
by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE)
notes that boosting several key energy efficiency provisions in the bill
could save an additional 400 million metric tons of CO2.xxviii

A more detailed study by McKinsey and Company on the potential of
energy efficiency cut emissions reveals that an integrated set of energy
efficiency investments and solution would reduce non-transportation
energy consumption 23%. This translates into a CO2 abatement of 1.1
gigatons. In other words, through energy efficiency alone, the potential
exists to surpass the proposed carbon caps in both bills many times
over. The icing on the cake is that these investments would come at
virtually no cost.xxix

Conclusion

President Obama campaigned on a promise to bring change to Washington. When he
was elected, he pledged US leadership on climate change, yet the world is waiting for
Obama to follow through on this commitment.

Congress has demonstrated its inability to lead by producing climate legislation that
registers a meager change in annual US greenhouse gas emissions (compared to 1990).
Congress’s response to the climate crisis is a far cry from what science says is needed
to prevent dramatic temperature increases. President Obama need not limit himself to
the 4–7% emission reductions in the climate bills nor wait for a final bill before committing
the US to an international agreement.

The President has the legal authority to cut emissions and sign on to an international
climate agreement, and he has the tools and technologies needed to get the job done.
As the world’s largest historical emitter, the US must do more.

The studies cited in this briefing demonstrate that the US has tremendous potential to
cut emissions with greater use of renewable energy and energy efficiency. These same
studies also show that by enacting strong climate legislation at the federal level that
the US will in fact grow its economy, create new jobs, and save American consumers
money. By fully harnessing the potential inherent in currently available renewable energy
and energy efficiency technologies, the US could deliver emission reductions that beat
the climate bills several times over.

Earlier this year, President Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in part for his
work on climate change. Hopefully, that award has given him the courage of his convic-
tions on climate change. For the President to be a true Nobel Peace Laureate, he must
commit to more than what Congress has proposed. Obama must reverse the United
States’ blocking role in the climate negotiations to secure a fair, ambitious and binding
deal for the climate this December. Yes he can commit the US to clean energy future,
and yes he must.
