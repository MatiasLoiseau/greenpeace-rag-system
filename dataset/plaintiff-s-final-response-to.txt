37 I. Plaintiffs have Established Standing.   
Plaintiffs have established standing to challenge the Defendants’ failure to comply with 
NEPA.  Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff organizations have alleged injuries to their 
concrete interests; they have demonstrated – based on the Defendants’ own admissions in the 
Administrative Records – that it is reasonably proba ble that Defendants’ actions contribute to an 
increased risk of injury to Plaintiffs’ interests; and they have established that a court order 
requiring compliance with NEPA will redress the Plaintiffs’ injuries.  See Pls.’ Opp’n at 9-27.  

In response, Defendants essentially concede that Plaintiffs have established both injury-
in-fact and redressability, and instead focus on causation, relying in large part on three new 
declarations.  See Declaration of Thomas Schehl (Att. A to Def. Reply); Declaration of James 
Mahoney  (Att. B to Def. Reply); Declaration of Dr. David Legates  (Att. C to Def. Reply).1

Defendants’ causation argum ent, and its reliance on these new affidavits, distorts the nature of 
the Court’s inquiry at this stage of the litigation.2  For exam ple, relying on Dr. Legates’ largely 
immaterial opinions, Defendants m istakenly asse rt that Plaintiffs m ust som ehow trace each CO 2 
molecule em itted f rom projects f inanced by the agencies directly to the particular im pacts 
alleged by Plaintiffs.  See Def. Reply at 8 (citing Legates Decl. at ¶11).  However: 
traceability does not m ean that plaintiffs m ust show to a scientific certainty 
that defendant' s effluent . . .  caused the precise harm  suffered by the 
plaintif fs. . . . If  scientif ic certainty were the standard, then plaintiffs would 
be required to supply costly, strict proof of causation to m eet a threshold 
jurisdictional requirem ent – even where, as here, the asserted cause of action 
does not itself require such proof.  Thus, the ‘fairly traceable’ standard is not 
equivalent to a requirem ent of tort causation.

 (internal citations and quotations om itted).  19 
                                            
1 The Defendants have effectively engaged Dr. Legates to underm ine the conclusions of 
the Governm ent’s own scientists at the EPA and the National Academ y of Sciences.  Dr. Legates 
is listed as an "expert", "scholar" or "advisor" with the Com petitive Enterprise Institute, National 
Center for Policy Analysis, George Marshall Institute and Tech Central Station.  These 
organizations have received significant fundi ng from  ExxonMobil Corporation and/or the 
American Petroleum  Institute, and take issue with the Governm ent’s clim ate change reports.  See

analysis and are also im proper extra-record evidence. See Pls.’ Motion to Strike (3/14/05).

Consistent with Gaston Copper , the Ninth Circuit has firm ly established that a plaintiff 
does not need to provide strict proof of “but for” causation to survive sum mary judgm ent on 
standing.  Instead, a plaintiff need only aver fact s that dem onstrate that the defendant’s actions 
contribute  to an increased risk of harm  to plaintiff’s concrete interests. Ocean Advocates v. 
United States Army Corps of Eng'rs , 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 28034, *17-18 (9th Cir. 2005) 
(finding that plaintiff had standing where plai ntiff alleged that defendant’s actions would 
contribute to the increased risk of harm  to plaintiffs’ interest, despite the fact that other 
independent causes m ay also increase risk of harm  to plaintiffs’ interest); see also  Mountain 
States Legal Found. v. Glickman , 92 F.3d 1228, 1234-1235 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (defendant’s 
contribution to an increased risk of fire suffi cient to establish standing, notwithstanding other 
multiple causes contributing to an increased risk).  1

                                           Furtherm ore, the Ninth Circuit has em phasized that while the causal connection put 
forward for standing purposes cannot be too specula tive “it need not be so airtight at [the 
standing] stage of litigation as to dem onstrate that the plaintiffs would succeed on the m erits.” 
Ocean Advocates, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 28034, *18. Thus, within the fram ework of a 
procedural injury case, Plaintiffs’ obligation to establish causation is relaxed – they need only 
demonstrate a “reasonable concern” of  harm  and a “reasonable probability” that Def endants’ 
actions contribute to an increased risk of such harm .  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw, 528 
U.S. 167, 184 (2000); Citizens for Better Forestry v. USDA , 341 F.3d 961, 972 (9th Cir. 2003)  
Here, Plaintiffs’ concerns reflect scientific consensus and are thus reasonable even in 
light of Dr. Legates claim s of m ere “uncertainty.” 3  Indeed, the Adm inistrative Record am ply 
 
 
Pls’ Surreply  
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  33 N.b.,  Dr. Legates’ does not assert that anthropom orphic carbon em issions do not  
contribute to clim ate change. Rather, he notes only that, in his opinion, the role of 
anthropom orphic carbon em issions in clim ate change is “uncertain”. See e.g., Legates Decl. at ¶ 

docum ents the reasonableness of Plaintiffs’ concer ns, and provides sufficient facts for this Court 
to conclude with reasonable probability that each agency’s actions contribute to som e increased 
risk of harm  to Plaintiffs’ concrete interests.1

                                                                                                                                            4 
 
44.  Even if taken to be true, the “uncertainty” alleged by Dr. Legates does not defeat Plaintiffs’ 
standing, particularly within the context of NEPA. To the contrary, Dr. Legates em phasizes 
Plaintiffs’ “reasonable concern,” Laidlaw , 528 U.S. at 184, that Defendants’ actions contribute to 
an increased risk to their concrete interests by repeatedly conceding that Plaintiffs’ concerns are 
“often cited” im pacts of clim ate change.  See e.g., Legates Decl. at ¶¶ 36, 40. Further, NEPA 
actually dem ands more  rigorous analysis where the extent of a project’s im pacts are “uncertain.”  
See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(5) (im pact m ay be significant where “the degree to which the 
possible effects on the hum an environm ent are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown 
risks.”). 
 
4 With respect to OPIC s ee Assessing Our Actions at 7, 28 (acknowledging recent studies 
which conclude “that hum an activity is the dom inant force behind the sharp global warm ing 
trend seen in the 20th century,” and noting “there is a strong and growing scientific consensus 
that these steady additions of GHGs have tipped a delicate balance and begun to im pact our 
climate and m ay be the dom inant force driving recent warm ing trends.”); id at 6 (sum mary 
finding that OPIC is a “contributor” to gl obal GHG em issions and clim ate change, although 
concluding that contribution is not significant); id. at 49 (“Clim ate change represents a serious 
global environm ental challenge. Since the dawn of the industrial age, m an has been em itting 
increasing quantities of heat-absorbing GHGs prim arily through the com bustion of fossil fuels. 
As a result, atm ospheric concentrations of CO 2 – the m ost im portant GHG – are now at their 
highest levels in m ore than 160,000 years and global tem peratures are rising. W ith em issions of 
CO 2 and other GHGs expected to increase – especially in developing regions – current forecasts 
suggest that atm ospheric concentrations of CO 2 could double by 2060 with a resulting global 
average tem perature increase of as m uch as 2º to 6.5º F over the next century. Such rapid 
temperature increase could have potentially grave econom ic and environm ental im pacts.”). 
 
With respect to Ex-Im  Bank see Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 4 (“the inf ormation 
presented … leads one to conclude that GHG concentr ations have indeed risen and that there is a 
reasonable likelihood that the increased concentra tions of these gases will result in increased 
average global tem peratures during the com ing decades.”); id. at 3 (noting that “[t]he direct 
regional environm ental im pact of such a clim ate change could include changes in tem perature 
and precipitations levels, with corresponding changes to the properties and m oisture content of 
soil.  The global im pact could include changes in weather patterns and rises in sea level.  The 
changes in turn can result in m ajor consequences to ecological system s, hum an health and 
socioeconom ic sectors such as agriculture, coastal resources, forests, energy and 
transportation.”); id. at 29 (noting that “the 425 m illion tonnes of CO 2 that is predicted to be 
produced by Ex-Im  Bank supported power projects by 2012 will cause Ex-Im Bank’s  
contribution  to global CO 2 production to peak at 1.4%”) (em phasis added).

Defendants also subm it new affidavits contes ting Plaintiffs’ evidence on indirect or 
downstream  GHG em issions from  OPIC and Ex-Im  projects.  Declaration of Thomas Schehl (Att. 
A to Def. Reply); Declaration of James Mahoney  (Att. B to Def. Reply).  Both Schehl and 
Mahoney attack calculations of em issions prep ared by Plaintiffs’ expert, Richard Heede, 
asserting that Heede’s inclusion of indirect em issions is inappropriate because it is “inconsistent 
with internationally recognized protocols.”  Sche hl Decl. at ¶¶16-20; Mahoney Decl. at ¶¶9-12.   1

                                           NEPA, however, dem ands consideration of th e indirect effects of federal actions – 
regardless of what other protocols m ay requi re.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.8(b).  Indeed, “NEPA does 
not recognize any distinction between prim ary a nd secondary effects” of federal actions, and 
therefore indirect greenhouse gas em issions m ust be taken into consideration.  Border Power 
Plant Working Group v. DOE , 260 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1015 (S.D. Cal. 2003) (evaluation of 
proposed power line on U.S./Mexico border violated NEPA because, am ong other things, the 
Departm ent of Energy failed to consider the indirect greenhouse gas em issions of a 500 MW  
gas-turbine power plant located in Mexico that would be connected to the power line).  As 
neither Mr. Schehl nor Mr. Mahoney offer an alte rnative accounting of total indirect em issions 
resulting from  Defendants’ action, Plaintiffs ’ uncontroverted evidence on the indirect GHG 
emissions from  Defendants’ action m ust be taken as true.5  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 
U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (for purposes of sum mary judgm ent plaintiffs’ facts m ust be taken as true); 
Alaska Wildlife Alliance v. Jensen , 108 F.3d 1065, 1068-69 (9th Cir. 1997) (sam e). 
 
5 While NEPA requires consideration of indirect im pacts, the agencies’ own calculations 
of their direct “contribution” to clim ate change alone is m ore than adequate to support Plaintiffs’ 
standing, further dem onstrating that the Sche hl and Mahoney Declarations are im material. See 
Pls.’ Opp’n at 17-18.

Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  5 

Defendants also persist in the hypothetical argum ent that OPIC and Ex-Im  projects could 
potentially go forward without OPIC or Ex-Im  support. Def. Reply at 4-6.  Again, Defendants’ 
misstate the appropriate inquiry.  A project is c onsidered a m ajor federal action subject to NEPA 
when it receives federal funding.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.18 (“Actions include new and continuing 
activities, including projects and programs entirely or partly financed, assisted , conducted, 
regulated, or approved by federal agencies.”) (em phasis added).  And here, the challenged 
projects did, in fact, proceed with substantia l federal funding.  The hypothetical of what m ay 
have happened is im material to this Court’s cons ideration of standing.  In any event, Defendants 
do not claim  that the particular projects challe nged by Plaintiffs in this case would have gone 
forward without their support – nor can they.1

II. Plaintiffs have Challenged Final Agency Actions.   
Despite the Adm inistrative Record’s clear support of Plaintiffs’ claim s, the Defendants 
persist in their argum ent that the Com plaint fails to specify final agency action.  Further, 
Defendants insist that final agency action m ust be determ ined without resort to the 
Adm inistration Record that m emorialized the action (or inaction) at issue here.  And now 
Defendants argue for the first tim e that the Record provided to Plaintiffs in 2003 m ay not be the 
appropriate Record.  Def. Opp’n to Pls’ Mot. to Strike at 6, n. 7.  
 It is basic that the F.R.Civ.P. 8 “notice” pleading standard does not require the Com plaint 
to state detailed facts, but need only put Defendant s on fair notice of Plain tiffs’ claim .  2 Moore’s 
Federal Practice § 8.04[1] (3d ed. 2001).  Inform ation on claim s is not required from  pleadings 
 
 
Pls’ Surreply  
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  66 See O’Boyle Decl. at ¶¶31-45   (no specific allegation that Chad-Cam eroon Pipeline, 
Cantarell Oil Field, Ham aca project, or Dezhou project would have proceeded without Ex-Im  
support).  The absence of such allegations is telling, and considering the substantial percentage 
of funding provided by Ex-Im  for these m ulti-billion dollar projects, it is understandable why the 
agency has not proffered such allegations.

record.  Id.; Bodine Produce, Inc. v. United Farm Workers , 494 F.2d 541, 561-62 (1974) 
(com plaint should be developed through discovery a nd other pretrial procedures).  Indeed, this 
Court and the Ninth Circuit have repeatedly held that f inality is determ ined by exam ination of  
the Adm inistrative Record.  Northcoast Env. Ctr v. Glickman , 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22845 
(N.D. Ca. 1996) (“It is not necessary to go beyond the adm inistrative record subm itted by 
defendants to determ ine whether the POC Program  constitutes final agency action.”) aff’d  
Northcoast Envtl. Ctr. v. Glickman , 136 F.3d 660, 665 (9th Cir. 1998) (District Court properly 
struck extra-record evidence and determ ined f inality only on adm inistrative record); Northwest 
Resource Inf. Ctr. v. P.U.D. No. 2 , 25 F.3d 872, 874-75 (9th Cir. 1994) (“Only where what 
petitioner challenged was not a f inal agency action based upon an administrative record  have we 
found against jurisdiction in this court.”) (em phasis added).       
 Never has a Court held that the adm inistrative record is irrelevant to determ ining finality.  
Quite to the contrary, an adm inistrative record m ay be supplemented  – not ignored – if it is 
insufficient to explain agency inaction.  See id.   
    Final agency action includes an agency’s “grant of m oney [or] assistance . . . or taking of 
other action on the application or petition of, and beneficial to, a person.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(11).  
Here, the Com plaint alleges that Defendants have, and continue to finance fossil fuel projects 
without first com plying with NEPA.  2d Am d. Cm plt. at ¶¶ 151-211.  In addition, the Com plaint 
specifies particular financing decisions taken by Defendants.  Id.

(detailing CO 2 emissions from  OPIC financed projects) .  Defendants’ failure to apply NEPA, 
whether to the individual agency actions listed in the Record, or to the “aggregate” or “portfolio” 
of such projects is final agency action.  Catron County Comm’rs v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service , 75 F.3d 1429, 1434 (10th Cir. 1996).  Indeed, the finality of these actions is, perhaps, 
best exem plified by Defendants’ assertion of a laches defense claim ing that m oneys for several 
of these projects have been disbursed and that the projects are under construction.  See Def. Mot. 
at 28, n.18 (asserting laches defense).   
 Defendants also adm it that all such actions were taken without regard to NEPA.  “As 
Plaintiffs point out, neither agency has conducted a NEPA analysis for the projects described in 
the Com plaint or for a purported program  supporti ng energy projects.  There could be no FONSI 
marking the conclusion of a NEPA process that never took place.”  Def. Reply at 18.  In other 
words, Defendants argue that their com plete and continuing failure to com ply with NEPA can 
never be subject to review because it is never final.  An “alleged failure to com ply with NEPA 
constitutes ‘final agency action’ 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).”  Catron County , 75 F.3d at 1434.       
III. OPIC Is Subject To Judicial Review .  
 
Pls’ Surreply  
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW  8Agency actions are subject to judicial revi ew under the APA unless review is expressly 
precluded by statute.  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1).  De fendants continue to argue that a “conclusive 
presum ption of com pliance” am ounts to express preclusion.  However, when Congress intends to 

insulate an agency from  judicial review, it doe s so by express reference to “judicial review.”7

                                           Defendants also argue that Congress intende d “guaranty contracts” – language found in 
section 2197(j), which does not reference other OPIC  functions such as insurance, financing, and 
reinsurance – to refer to all of OPIC’s “fundam ental actions.”  Def. Reply at 24-25.  A plain 
reading of the statute reveals the obvious flaw in  this reasoning – sections 2197(i) and (k), which 
bracket the provision in question, refer to guaranty contracts and insurance and reinsurance.  
These are clearly distinct term s.  Defendants now introduce new legislative history that actually 
supports Plaintiffs’ position.  Congress describes “i nvestm ent insurance” authority as “identical 
with the specific risk guaranty authority,” yet insurance and guarantees are treated in different 
sections of the Report.  H. Rpt. No. 91-611, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 30-31 (1969).  W hile OPIC’s 
authority over insurance and guaranty contracts m ay be identical, Congress clearly separated the 
two term s, and reference to “guaranty” does not equate to a reference to “insurance.” 
Furtherm ore, Defendants do not actually respond to Plaintiffs’ argum ent that Congress 
specifically anticipated judicial review in the c ontext of guaranty contracts.  Defendants state: 
“This m eans only that a claim ant under an OPIC contract m ay not benefit from  the claim ant’s 
own wrongdoing.”  Def. Reply at 25.  Absent a m echanism  for review, however, there would be 
no way to enforce this policy.   
OPIC’s treatm ent of NEPA is sim ilarly fl awed. The environm ental review requirem ents 
of the OPIC Act do not “displace” the agency’s duties under NEPA.  Defendants m isread 
Plaintiffs’ “fundam ental prem ise.”  Def. Repl y at 20-21.  OPIC m ust analyze environm ental

24 impacts both at hom e and abroad, and in particular it m ust follow NEPA when its actions affect 
the U.S. environm ent.  “[E]ach agency of the Federal Governm ent shall com ply with [NEPA] 
unless existing law . . . expressly prohibits or m akes com pliance im possible.”  40 C.F.R. § 
1500.6.  As Defendants concede, “The [OPIC] stat ute does not reference NEPA . . . .”  Def. 
Reply at 21.  Defendants also concede that the OP IC Act relies on “term s of art from  NEPA.”  
Def. Mem . at 34.  Thus, the OPIC Act does not prohibit or interfere with NEPA com pliance.   
Defendants defeat their own argum ent by relying on legislative history – this 
acknowledges that com pliance with NEPA is not “e xpressly prohibited.”  The legislative history, 
which explains how reference to NEPA was delete d from  the OPIC Act, shows that Congress did 
not intend to com pletely exem pt OPIC from  its duties under NEPA.  Def. Mem . at 37-40.   
OPIC m isconstrues the record. “[I]t is our understanding that [NEPA] does not and
