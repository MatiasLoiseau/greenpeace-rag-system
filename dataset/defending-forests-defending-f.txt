Protecting our Heritage
Our national forests provide us with essential needs like clean air and water, soil
production, flood control and climate stability. They also offer scenic beauty,recreational activities and related jobs and wildlife habitat. America’s forests play
a critical role in providing large expanses of undisturbed terrain for plants andanimals, housing 17 percent of the 1,200 listed threatened and endangeredspecies.
Most Americans assume that our government is protecting our national forests,
rich with vital ecological functions. Sadly, our hard earned tax dollars are insteadbeing used to fund logging, road building and other extractive industries in ourforests.
For over 100 years, our national forests have been destructively mismanaged,
primarily for timber. Not only have these practices been ruinous to the forestecosystem, they have continually wasted the American people’s money, providing few benefits in return. Only two percent of the wood products used inthe United States come from public forests.
The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have
been entrusted to conserve our forests. However, despite the conservation intentbehind their creation, these government agencies have neglected to safeguardour public lands. Due to the failures of these bureaus, dating back many years,we are now faced with having only five percent of our ancient forests left intact. 
The Forest Service: Negligent in its Duty to Protect Our Ancient Forests
The Forest Service is charged with managing 191 million acres of forest andrangeland, an area equal to the size of Texas and 8.5 percent of the total U.S.land area. By law and at every level of planning, the Forest Service must ensurethe social and economic benefits of its forest management for all Americans. Thismeans before it begins any timber sale program it must conduct a cost benefitanalysis that accounts for the full monetary and social value of the standing forest and assess those values against those gained by the sale of the timber, aswell as an environmental impact analysis.
The Forest Service consistently ignores this type of analysis while steadfastly
pursuing its timber sale program. This is a breach of both the law and its responsibility to the American people who have entrusted and funded this
agency to protect our forests. In fiscal year 1997, taxpayers provided over $1

billion to subsidize private logging companies that
destroy our forests while the Forest Service spendsmillions of dollars for road building and other timberextraction processes. The Forest Service has beenunable to provide data on the cost of its timber programs since 1998. At that time, the agencyreported a $126 million loss, but an independent
analysis found losses to be three times that amount.
Our tax dollars would be far better spent on the 
ecological and recreational resources that forestsprovide, creating both economic gain and keepingthe forest ecosystem thriving. According to theForest Service’s own data, recreation in nationalforests accounts for over 30 times both the amountof revenue and jobs created than those from timbersales. Annually, timber produces roughly $4 billionper year while recreation, fish and wildlife, cleanwater and roadless areas provide a combined totalof $224 billion to the American economy each year.If the Forest Service were a company, it would havegone bankrupt long ago.
This summer, the Forest Service and BLM are 
planning to extensively log some of the last remaining ancient forests across the United States,
including forests in Oregon, Alaska and Virginia. Inthe Pacific Northwest alone, 188 sales totalingalmost 89,000 acres of old-growth forest are slatedfor the chopping block. In the Siskiyou NationalForest, an unprecedented 370 million board feet oftimber is scheduled to be cut. This is the largest timber sale in modern U.S. history. 
Bureau of Land Management: Our AncientForests under the Freewheeling Axe 
The Bureau of Land Management is responsible formanaging 262 million acres of public land, locatedprimarily in 12 western states including Alaska.  BLMis notorious for liquidating the natural resourcesunder its jurisdiction for the benefit of private interests. An 18-month study of the agency’s timbersales by Public Employees for EnvironmentalResponsibility (PEER) shows widespread mismanagement of the BLM’s Public Domainforestry program. This mismanagement includeswidespread noncompliance by BLM employees tofollow the agencies own policies and regulations. 
Like the Forest Service, the BLM is also fiscally 
irresponsible, and chooses to operate its timber program at an economic loss. According to Green
Scissors, the BLM agency fails to return 20 percentof its timber revenues to the federal treasury to coverthe timber sale administration costs, as required bylaw. 
The threats to ancient forests are primarily due to the
agency’s complete lack of policy for protecting old-growth on public forests. The agency attempts tosidestep its responsibility by denying there are anyold-growth forests on BLM land, a huge fallacy whenone looks at its holdings in Oregon.  A review of over30 BLM timber sales by PEER found that BLM districts in Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon andCalifornia violated NEPA and other federal requirements for timber sales. This summer, over
18,000 acres of ancient forests in Oregon are threat-ened by the BLM’s axe.
Join Greenpeace in Rescuing and Restoring ourAncient Forests
These public lands belong to us, not the timberindustry. Help protect our American heritage bytelling your representatives to stop using Americans’money to cut down our forests. Join Greenpeace incalling for permanent protection of our last remainingancient forests and an immediate end to all commercial logging in public forests.
