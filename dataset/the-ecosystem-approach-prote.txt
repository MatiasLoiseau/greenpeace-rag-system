The Ecosystem Approach 
protecting marine life in all its forms
Defending Our Mediterranean
"Greenpeace is committed to defending the health of the world's oceans 
and the plants, animals and people that depend upon them." 

The world’s oceans, once thought to contain inexhaustible resources, are under increasing
threat. In recent years, scientific study after scientific study has pointed to the fact that human
activities and fishing in particular have been putting extreme pressure on marine ecosystemsto the point that profound ecosystem changes are being experienced in many parts of theworld. In November 2006, an international group of ecologists and economists, led by ProfessorBoris Worm of Dalhousie University ,published a study in Science that brought the extent of this
degradation into stark relief. Looking at marine biodiversity on a global scale, the study shows
that loss of marine biodiversity is drastically reducing the ocean’s ability to produce seafood,
resist diseases, filter pollutants and rebound from stresses such as over-fishing and climatechange. The team’s projection that all commercial and seafood species are on the brink of collapse was shocking enough to make news headlines across the world.
The study however was not all doom and gloom, for it also showed that closing areas to fishing by
establishing marine reserves increases the abundance, productivity and diversity of species found inthe reserves. This applies to fish species at least as much as it applies to other species, which meansthat marine reserves boost fish stocks and ultimately the catch per unit ef
fort in waters adjacent to the
reserves. This should be a wake-up call to us all.  If we take action now, the oceans possess the potential to rebound; if we do nothing, we will witness further fisheries collapses until there is nothingleft to fish, except perhaps jellyfish.
The Mediterranean sea reflects these shocking global trends: from overfishing to pollution, it is amongst
the most degraded marine ecosystems in the world, to the point where many species and ecosystemsare on the brink of collapse. Bluefin tuna stocks are a case in point; once a mainstay of fishermenin the Mediterranean, the stock is now in urgent need of recovery.
It is clear that current management regimes are to blame for the widespread degradation of the
Mediterranean Sea. It is further widely accepted amongst many policy makers, scientists and othersthat we must therefore adopt a radical new approach to the Mediterranean – one that is precautionaryin nature and has protection of the whole marine ecosystem as its primary objective.
Such an ecosystem-based approach is vital if we are to ensure the health of our oceans for future
generations. So what constitutes the ecosystem-based approach? Essentially, the ecosystem approach to marine management requires consideration of whole ecosytems
at a scale that ensures that ecosystem integrity is maintained.  It recognises the complex interactions between species that make up marine ecosystems, and so is underpinned by principles ofcommunity biology and ecology
. This is radically different from the present situation where most 
fisheries management measures focus on single species and do not consider the role of the species inthe wider ecosystem.  Moreover, the various industries that affect the marine environment are currently
managed on a sector-by-sector basis so that no consideration is given to their cumulative impacts.
Given the scientific uncertainty and unpredictability of marine ecosystems it is vital that ecosystem-
based management is applied in conjunction with a precautionary approach.  What this means in practice is that a lack of knowledge does not excuse decision-makers from taking action, but rather thatthey err on the side of caution.  To achieve this, the burden of proof must be placed on those who wantto undertake activities, such as fishing, or coastal development to show that these activities will notharm the marine environment before the any action is permitted. This will encourage sustainable development and fisheries, while limiting destructive practices.
The objective of applying the ecosystem based approach, is to ensure that ecosystems are not 
systematically degraded and that the conditions required for the provision of human needs, future orpresent, are not undermined. Moreover, ecosystem-based management should focus managementaction where the control over the impact of the activity is most feasible and effective, i.e. on the humanactivities that impact the marine environment, rather than attempt to manipulate the way in which anecosystem is functioning. 
Applying ecosystem-based management in practice
In order to implement ecosystem-based management a whole package of management measures need
to be introduced, underpinned by the establishment of networks of large-scale marine reserves. 
Implementation of the ecosystem approach requires a management strategy that:•
goes beyond a single or multi-species approach by considering the ecosystem as a whole;
•is aimed at protecting biodiversity and restoring degraded ecosystems, not least with the aim to 
improve their resilience to global climate change;
• avoids over-harvesting and ecosystem modifications;

• is based on the precautionary principle – i.e. conservation measures are taken even in the absence 
of full knowledge of the activities, impacts and ecological responses to these impacts;
• focuses on the ‘up-stream’ control of human activities, i.e. controlling human activities to minimise 
and eliminate impacts, rather than focusing on the control of impacts or of ecosystems;
• is robust even in the light of uncertainties and management oversight; and
• can be applied with immediate effect.
Protected areas plus sustainable management – it’s a package dealAmong the measures needed to achieve sustainability in the seas outside marine reserves are:Reduction of fishing overcapacity and effort
The continued expansion of fishing capacity and effort presents an obstacle to achieving equitable andsustainable use of marine resources. Both, fishing capacity and ef
fort must be adjusted to a level that the
sea can sustain, and subsidies encouraging over-capacity must be eliminated.
Elimination of destructive fishing practices
Fishing practices that clearly fail the test of sustainability must be prohibited. An example is the use oflarge-scale driftnets, which are indiscriminate and have unacceptably high levels of by-catch and as aresult have been banned from the Mediterranean. (However it should be noted that this ban has not beenproperly enforced as yet.) 
Elimination of pirate fishing
The management of fisheries and the marine environment is only as good as its enforcement. Illegal,unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing threatens the marine environment and the livelihoods of thosewho fish legitimately
. Loopholes in fisheries management, lax attitudes allowing the proliferation of flags of
convenience and poor enforcement of regulations must be addressed.
End of pollution
Unfortunately the Mediterranean Sea has suffered from high levels of pollution on the basis that out ofsight is out of mind. Marine pollution comes in many forms the most familiar being from oil tanker acci
-
dents, but these are only a tiny part of the problem. Agricultural runoff from river basins, chemical pollutionfrom industrial plants discharging into the sea from the land, oil from ships washing out their tanks, inten -
tional dumping, mining and the throwing of litter into the sea are all fouling are oceans. Every effort should
be made to eliminate the introduction of pollutants into the marine environment and shipping routes need
to be devised to take vessels carrying dangerous cargoes away from the most vulnerable areas.While marine reserves are an essential part of the solution to the crisis facing our oceans and intrinsicto the application of the ecosystem based approach, human activities in the surrounding waters muststill be managed sustainably. In fact, the effectiveness of marine reserves will be dependent on themanagement of the waters beyond their boundaries. 
What are marine reserves? 
Marine reserves are highly protected areas that are off limits to all extractive and destructive uses,
including fishing. Comparable to national parks on land, they are the most powerful tool available forthe conservation of ocean wildlife and may also benefit fisheries by promoting recovery and reproduction of exploited species.
Marine reserves are also necessary for the implementation of effective management of the sea, and
have important benefits to scientific understanding of this environment. 
They provide control areas for
all direct human disturbances and more natural baselines for measurement of impacts. This enablesscientists to obtain data that that are less confounded by human activities (e.g. separating natural variation from fishing effects) and acquire a greater understanding of the intrinsic processes of subjectecosystems.  Marine reserves are therefore essential to implementing ecosystem-based management.
Where marine reserves have been designated, they have been shown to result in long-standing and
often rapid increases in the abundance, diversity and productivity of marine life, especially of speciesthat were previously exploited.  Marine reserves may benefit fisheries by the “spillover” of animals frominside the reserves and from the export of eggs and larvae to adjacent marine areas. Marine reservesalso enable the development of more natural, extended population age structures that promoteresilience to overfishing and are important to maintaining the integrity of marine ecosystems in the faceof climate change.
It is also worth remembering that in the past vast tracts of our seas were simply inaccessible to 
fishermen and other human activities and so were de facto marine reserves, providing natural refugesfor marine species.  Modern technical innovation has now allowed fishing practically anywhere on theplanet, eliminating any refuges that once provided respite to fish populations.

Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning organisation that acts
to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment and to promote peace.Scaling of marine reserves
In order to assure sufficient protection across the whole range of marine ecosystems it will be necessaryto establish a representative, replicated, networked and sustainable system of fully protected marinereserves. 
To be effective networks must, therefore, span large geographic distances and be of sufficient
scale to protect against catastrophes and ensure the long-term health and stability of marine ecosystems. 
In order to reverse the current decline in the health of our oceans, Greenpeace is calling for 40% of the
oceans to be protected by marine reserves.
This figure is firmly based on science. A review (Gell and Roberts 2003) of forty previous studies into
what area coverage is required to achieve conservation and fisheries management goals concluded that20-50% is required. In its 2004 report ‘Turning the tide: addressing the impact of fisheries on the marineenvironment’ the UK’s Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) similarly recommendedthat 30% of the UK’s EEZ be designated as no-take zones in order to reverse the trend of declining fishstocks.
Greenpeace’s demand is also consistent with that of the World Parks Congress, which said “networks
should be extensive and include strictly protected areas that amount to at least 20-30% of each 
habitat.” Meanwhile, the United Nations Millennium Project calls for 10% of the oceans to be covered byMarine Reserves in the short to medium term, with a long-term goal of 30%.
Implementing networks of marine reserves that benefit small-scale and sustainable fisheries will require
the full participation of these communities from inception onwards.  While Greenpeace envisages theestablishment of large-scale marine reserves on the high seas, closer to the coast a patchwork of smallreserves will be more ef 
fective. This difference in scale not only reflects the difference in scale of habitat
distribution but also ensures equitable access to fishing resources to the communities along the coast.Time for Action
While some Mediterranean countries have introduced protected areas within their own national waters,
this is not enough. What is needed is for Mediterranean countries to work together and identify and des
-
ignate regional networks of marine reserves, fully representative of the whole diversity of ecosystemsfound in Mediterranean waters. They then should take this concept further and work with other countriesaround the world to implement marine reserves in their own waters as well as in the international watersof the high seas.
To help with this process, Greenpeace has identified specific areas in the Mediterranean Sea which
should be set aside in regional networks of marine reserves, as well as a global set of possible marinereserves on the high seas.
Now is the time to make these proposals real.With the development of a new EU marine law (the EU Marine Strategy Directive), the Member States of
the European Union have a unique opportunity to work together and begin implementing ecosystem-based management for our oceans.  A crucial provision to be included will be one mandating the cre-ation of large-scale marine reserves, but other measures will also be needed to ensure that activitiesoutside the reserves are managed on a sustainable basis for current and future generations.
There is no time to waste: defending our oceans must begin now!
