Executive Summary

4  l Toxic Tech: Not in Our Backyard l  Greenpeace International l  2008

A dangerous new waste stream is rapidly emerging.

Greenpeace continues to push the major electronics makers to:

-  Embrace the principle of ‘Individual Producer Responsibility’;

where companies take financial responsibility for their
products once discarded by customers. Individual producer
responsibility calls for the cost of waste management to be
incorporated into the product price, enacting the “polluter
pays” principle and by differentiating between companies it
motivates them to improve the environmental design of the
products.

-  Design out toxics; clean up their products by eliminating
hazardous substances, replacing harmful ingredients
through use of safer alternatives or design changes.
Greenpeace believes that the e-waste crisis should not be
regarded only as a waste management issue but that the
solution also lies in product design.

Greenpeace is challenging manufacturers of electronic goods to
take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products, from
production, through manufacture and to the very end of their
products’ lives. Only in this way can we ensure that the dangerous
tide of toxic e-waste can be stemmed, and that the hidden flow of
e-waste does not become a problem in anybody’s backyard.

Greenpeace has commissioned the report, Toxic Tech: Not in Our
Backyard, to investigate the global sales of electrical and electronic
products and assess the amount of waste arising from this.

The UN estimates that some 20 to 50m tonnes of e-waste are
generated worldwide each year, comprising more than 5% of all
municipal solid waste. The fate of large quantities of this so-called
e-waste is unknown. This “hidden flow” is the e-waste that escapes
responsible collection, reuse and recycling systems and as such is
unaccounted for.

While some might be found stored in attics or garages or disposed
of with mixed waste in landfills and incinerators, thousands more
electrical and electronic products that have reached the end of
their lives are exported, often illegally, for dumping in Africa or for
rudimentary recovery by Asian informal recyclers. There, workers
at scrap yards - some of whom are children – are exposed to a
cocktail of toxic chemicals when the products are broken apart,
and as water, air and soil are polluted.

The quantities of e-waste generated are predicted to grow
substantially in the future, both in industrialised countries and in
developing countries, which are expected to triple their e-waste by
2010. The rich countries often legally or illegally divert this problem
from their own backyards. The hidden flow of e-waste that results
causes environmental damage in the backyards and scrapyards of
poorer countries.

Ultimately, the principle of producer responsibility, which requires
producers to take financial and/or management responsibility for
their products when they reach the end-of-life phase, needs to be
at the core of any measures to address the e-waste problem. The
escalating e-waste problem makes it imperative to also address the
source, the design of electrical and electronic products.

Introduction

6  l Toxic Tech: Not in Our Backyard l  Greenpeace International l  2008

Waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) – also
known as e-waste - is one of the fastest growing types of
hazardous waste globally. WEEE is classified as hazardous
waste because it contains many toxic ingredients, including
heavy metals and harmful, persistent chemicals, with the
potential to pollute the environment and damage human health
when it is processed, recycled or disposed of.  At the same
time the development and introduction of appropriate reuse,
recycling and recovery technologies is not keeping pace with this
growth. This will have a big impact on how the hazards inherent
in e-waste are dealt with, as far as the effects on human health
and the environment that will result from reuse, recycling and
disposal are concerned.   Nevertheless, the growing quantities of
e-waste also represent a huge resource potential.

The objective of this study is to provide a picture of the amount
of waste electrical and electronic equipment arising in selected
countries and where it ends up, with a focus on the ‘hidden flows’
of e-waste that are escaping any form of treatment/management.
The study considered both industrialised countries, such as the
US and the EU and the newly industrialised countries China, India,
Thailand and Argentina.

Specific focus was given to TVs, PCs, and mobile phones (and
in some cases also large household appliances); remaining
categories of e-waste are grouped together in the category
“other” where appropriate.

What’s in electronic devices?

Electronic devices are a complex mixture of several
hundred materials. A mobile phone, for example, contains
500 to 1000 components. Many of these contain toxic
heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium and
beryllium and hazardous chemicals, such as brominated
flame retardants. Polluting polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic
is also frequently used.

These dangerous substances cause serious pollution and put
workers at risk of exposure when the products are produced
or disposed of. Of particular concern is the exposure of
children and pregnant women to lead and mercury. These
metals are highly toxic and can harm children and developing
foetuses even at low levels of exposure.

More on the health hazards of chemicals in
electronics.

•   Some brominated flame retardants, used in circuit

boards and plastic casings, do not break down easily
and build up in the environment.  Long-term exposure
can lead to impaired learning and memory functions.
They can also interfere with thyroid and oestrogen
hormone systems and exposure in the womb has been
linked to behavioural problems.

•   As much as 1450 tonnes of a brominated flame

retardant called TBBPA was used to manufacture 991
million mobile phones sold in 2006. This chemical has
been linked to neurotoxicity.

•   The cathode ray tubes (CRT) in monitors contain lead.
Exposure to lead can cause intellectual impairment
in children and can damage the nervous, blood and
reproductive systems in adults.

•   Cadmium, used in rechargeable computer batteries,

contacts and switches and in older CRTs, can
bioaccumulate in the environment and is highly toxic,
primarily affecting the kidneys and bones.

•   Mercury, used in lighting devices for flat screen displays,
can damage the brain and central nervous system,
particularly during early development.

•   Compounds of hexavalent chromium, used in the

production of metal housings, are highly toxic and are
human carcinogens.

•   PVC is a chlorinated plastic used in some electronics
products and for insulation on wires and cables.
Chlorinated dioxins and furans are released when PVC
is produced or disposed of by incineration (or simply
burning). These chemicals are highly persistent in
the environment and many are toxic even in very low
concentrations.

Summary of Findings

8  l Toxic Tech: Not in Our Backyard l  Greenpeace International l  2008

The hidden flows of e-waste

The fate of large quantities of e-waste that arise every year is
unknown, even in regions such as the EU that are beginning to be
more tightly regulated.

While the current WEEE arising across the EU27 is estimated
at 8.7 million tonnes a year the amount collected and treated is
estimated at only 2.1 million tonnes or 25%1; this estimate includes
all categories of e-waste defined by the legislation.

•	 The remaining 6.6 million tonnes, or 75%, is the EU’s

general ‘hidden flow’; no precise data is available on what
happens to this waste, whether it is stored, disposed of
otherwise within the EU, or exported, to be either reused,
recycled or disposed of in Asian countries such as India and
China as well as Africa.

Furthermore, it is probable that part of the 25% collected is also
exported, although it is impossible to quantify how much. It is
also important to note that exports are taking place despite EU
legislation that bans exports of hazardous waste to non-OECD
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)
countries and ratification of the Basel Ban by EU member states.

What’s the Hidden Flow?

The Hidden Flow is the amount of WEEE arising based on
past product sales that escapes responsible collection,
reuse and recycling systems and as such is unaccounted
for, but which can end up causing environmental damage,
often in poorer parts of the world. Greenpeace distinguishes
between the General Hidden Flow (all the e-waste that fails
to be captured by recycling programmes) and the more
specific Producer’s Hidden Flow. The latter is the amount
of own-branded WEEE arising (based on past sales) that
escapes the control of a given producer (brand owner)
and as such the rewards of better eco-designed products
cannot be reaped by that producer.

In the US the ‘hidden flows’ of e-waste are even larger.  Overall,
less than 20% of the e-waste categories televisions, PCs including
peripherals and mobile phones were separated from other waste
streams for “further processing and recovery” – and this figure
includes part of the export of e-waste to countries such as India
and China2.

•	 The remaining general hidden flow of 80% is incinerated,
sent to landfill, put into ‘storage or reuse’, or exported.

Figures for the recycling of PCs and TVs show that only 10% and
14% of the quantities sold in the past, respectively, were recycled
in 20053; the amounts of PCs recycled are also declining as a
percentage of sales, which continue to increase.

•	 This leaves a general hidden flow of 90% and 86% for

these two product categories, not considering the fact that
some of the remaining 10-15% of e-waste that has been
separated for processing and recovery is also likely to have
been exported.

For newly industrialised countries like China and India with large
informal recycling sectors, it is just not possible even to estimate
the percentage of the “hidden flow” of e-waste.  In these countries
collection rates are determined by the informal recycling sector,
where the focus is on the recovery (albeit inefficient reclamation)
of valuable raw materials and not on the health and environmental
hazards inherent in e-waste, resulting in environmental pollution and
exposure of workers to hazardous substances from the recycling of
e-waste. These primitive treatment methods result in lower end-of-
life costs than in OECD countries.  This ‘cheap’ form of recycling
drives the import of e-waste from developed countries such as the
US and the EU, which add to the growing e-waste problem in non-
OECD countries such as India, China and West African countries.
As domestic sales of electrical and electronic appliances are set to
escalate in non-OECD countries, the quantities of e-waste will be
much higher in the future.  If electronic products continue to contain
hazardous ingredients and the current methods of recovering raw
materials carry on this will lead to further environmental and health
problems from the recycling of e-waste.

•	 When looking at the authorised treatment facilities in India
the general hidden flows can be considered to be over
99%, representing 143,000 tonnes4.

Producer responsibility

Ultimately, the principle of producer responsibility, which requires
producers to take financial and/or management responsibility for
their products when they reach the end-of-life phase, needs to be
at the core of any measures to address the e-waste problem. The
EU’s WEEE Directive (Art. 8.2) makes each producer responsible for
its own-branded discarded products brought on the market
since August 2005 (Individual Producer Responsibility). The aim
is to provide producers with an incentive for product eco-design
and prevention of the problem of e-waste at source. Products
designed after August 2005 are increasingly expected to take
recycling problems into account. The key question in this context
is: what portion of the amount of own-branded end-of-life products
is actually already controlled globally by the producers either
financially and/or physically? The principle of producer responsibility
is based on the assumption that the bigger this portion is, the
greater the incentive to improve the design of products and product
systems, e.g. by designing out toxic ingredients to reduce end-
of-life costs by offsetting the costs of collection and reprocessing
with the revenues from reclaiming valuable materials like precious
metals.  Brand owners that are seriously improving product design
by using higher value, recyclable and less toxic materials will not
want to see their branded e-waste escape their stewardship;
for example Apple’s new Macbook Air uses a highly recyclable
aluminum enclosure, rather than flame retarded plastics5.

In several cases and in a number of non-EU countries,
manufacturers do (or try to) also take responsibility voluntarily for
the end-of-life phase of their products.  However, this sometimes
takes the form of temporary or isolated actions (e.g. in the US);
this means that the consumer does not have a constant and
reliable way to deliver end-of-life appliances to recovery facilities.
The consumer is often required to temporarily store the waste
appliances until he is able to deliver it for recovery. A systematic
and comprehensive approach of producers taking responsibility for
their end-of-life products has been found predominantly in those
countries where it is required by legal frameworks (such as the EU)
or where public awareness is high.

In the EU, the WEEE Directive is underpinned by (individual)
producer responsibility, although poor transposition means that
so far implementation varies across the various Member States.
Given some more time and sufficient support from the EU executive
and proactive initiatives on the part of some producers there is no
reason not to believe that the implementation will improve. Despite
some hiccups in its implementation the WEEE Directive is providing
an important model for addressing the e-waste problem globally,
with WEEE type legislation now being adopted in various forms in
other countries.

Hidden flows of own-
branded e-waste

The figures provided by four PC producers suggest that global
responsibility is currently taken for between 8.8% to 12.4% of
own-branded end-of-life products that are available for collection
and recovery; these producers have also developed take back and
recycling activities within certain quality standards.   Recycling rates
for own-branded mobiles are much lower, at about 2-3%6.

•	 This information means that for those few brands that are

reporting on the collection and recycling of their own brand
PCs and mobile phones as a percentage of past sales, the
‘hidden flow’ of e-waste branded products currently
amounts to an average of  91% of past sales.

The exception is Sony, where a recycling rate of 53% has been
achieved in Japan, where WEEE legislation is in force, leaving
a hidden flow of 47%.  This shows that higher take-back
and recycling targets can be achieved with a combination of
government legislation and company practice.

The fate of these ‘hidden
flows’ of e-waste

There are only few cases in the countries that were analysed where
the relatively systematic take back of e-waste has been achieved,
as is beginning to happen in European Union, where the field of e-
waste is regulated in detail by European and national law7.

•	 Even in countries with regulations there is a surprisingly

large amount of waste that is not captured by the producer
responsibility programmes; the key question is: what
happens to this large ‘hidden flow’ of e-waste?

The newly
industrialised countries

China, India and Thailand have several things in common; all these
countries have a typically informal recycling sector, which focuses
primarily on the recovery of the valuable raw materials present in
e-waste and the reuse of components for second-hand equipment.
This means that there is a relatively high collection rate, as end-users
often sell their old appliances for reuse or recovery.  The quantities
that are reused and recycled are not well documented since figures
are not easily available, because this informal recycling is undertaken
by very lucrative downstream businesses that are illegal and hidden.

6  See: ‘Recycling by manufacturers’ page 20.

Japan, Korea and Taiwan are other countries with producer responsibility legislation embracing
four large home appliances and PCs, but are not included in this report.

As well as environmental and human health consequences from
these recycling methods, the lower end-of-life costs in the informal
sector mean that formal recyclers find it hard to compete; as a
result there is a virtual lack of a formal recycling infrastructure (less
than 1% of the total capacity in India in 20078). Moreover, the
informal sector is also ‘fed’ by illegal and legal imports of e-waste
from industrialised countries. The legal imports are for so-called
‘reuse’ but very soon most of it ends up in the informal sector; the
reality in India is that 99% of all WEEE, including imports, ultimately
ends up in the informal sector.

Newly industrialised countries are also experiencing a rapid
increase in domestic consumption of consumer electronics.
However, the quantities involved in India are not yet as high as in
China.  For example, sales of PCs in India are estimated at about
5 million in 2006/79 compared to 20 million in 2007 in China10.
Likewise, the quantities of mobile phones sold are much less
– 15 million in 2004/511 compared to 80 million in China in the
same period12. It is remarkable that the expected annual growth in
electric and electronic equipment (EEE) consumption in India up to
2015 is around 30%13.  China has already experienced immense
growth in EEE consumption since the mid 1990s and this is set to
continue through to 2020.  The newly industrialised countries are
catching up fast.

•	 This rapid increase in consumption means that in the future
the quantities of e-waste in newly industrialised countries
are projected to grow substantially.  This raises serious
concerns about the impacts on health and the environment
from recycling and disposal of e-waste, even without taking
imports of e-waste into account.

The industrialised countries

The picture in industrialised countries is slightly different.  In general,
markets for electrical and electronic appliances are more saturated
and where they are increasing this is much more slowly than in
countries like India and China; for some products there is barely any
increase, whereas others, such as PCs, continue to grow.  Even
so, the quantities of e-waste generated are expected to grow over
the next few years; overall, sales of EEE in the EU are expected to
increase by 28% by 202014.

The situation in the US is quite different to the EU.  The US
represents a large consumer market with high sales of electrical
and electronic appliances, but with a relatively unsophisticated
infrastructure for the collection and recycling of e-waste.  This
situation is now beginning to change, however, as certain US
States implement their own WEEE initiatives and some of the major
companies begin to take producer responsibility by setting up take-
back and recycling schemes.   The low levels of collection at the
moment, however, mean that such schemes have a long way to go
before they begin to make an impact.

Like the US, the EU also has high levels of consumption of
electrical and electronic appliances and in general is a relatively
saturated market, with a few exceptions in some countries where
markets are still relatively undeveloped.  In contrast to the US,
the implementation of the WEEE Directive in the 27 EU Member
States means that a relatively sophisticated system for collecting
and recycling e-waste is now being set up, with the involvement of
governments, producers and sometimes retailers.  The evolution of
these collection and recycling systems will need to keep pace with
the growing quantities of e-waste that are projected to arise in the
future. The continuing evolution of new technologies will ensure that
sales – and e-waste - will continue to grow, for example, the move
to digital TV in North America and the EU and the development of
flat screen TVs is already driving sales of new TVs.

•	 The major issue for both the US and the EU to address is that
e-waste is currently exported to less industrialised countries
such as China and India, where recycling and recovery takes
place with little regard for the human health or environmental
consequences. The key difference between these two regions
is that in the US, the export of e-waste to developing countries
is legal, whereas in the EU export of e-waste to non-OECD
countries is banned by the Waste Shipment Regulation, based
on the Basel Convention and more precisely the Basel Ban
Amendment, that completely bans the export of hazardous
waste from OECD to non-OECD countries even for recycling.
(The US has not yet ratified the Basel Convention).

•

In the EU the revision of the WEEE Directive15 is an
opportunity to strengthen collection and recycling targets
and reinforce Individual Producer Responsibility.  The
revision of the RoHS Directive16 also opens the prospect for
bans and restrictions on additional hazardous substances
(e.g. antimony, beryllium, arsenic) and for lifting exemptions
on certain uses of the substances, like mercury that are
already restricted by RoHS.

Implementing Producer
Responsibility

This snowballing e-waste problem makes it imperative to address
the source, the design of electrical and electronic products.  Many
environmental considerations can be factored into a product at its
design stage, but the most crucial issues raised by the e-waste
problem are the use of hazardous substances, the durability
of products and their recyclability at the end of their lives. The
presence of hazardous substances such as brominated flame
retardants, PVC plastic and many of the heavy metals lead to
environmental and human health problems when e-waste is
recycled and disposed of; as well as releasing hazardous by-
products when recycled, PVC plastic hampers the recyclability of
discarded products.  Fortunately, some manufacturers are proving
that it is possible to avoid the use of these substances altogether
through product redesign17.  As the designer of these products, the
producer is the prime stakeholder responsible for the solution.

However, designing out toxics must be taken up by the majority of
manufacturers in order to effect a major change to the make-up of
e-waste that will arise in the future.  In the meantime, the historical
e-waste and products that are becoming obsolescent now contain a
cocktail of hazardous substances which need to be addressed with
the least possible damage to human health and the environment.
However, even though the growing mountains of e-waste represent
a potentially huge source of toxic pollution in the future, they also
contain valuable and increasingly scarce raw materials.

15   WEEE Directive, Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27

January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)

16   RoHS – Restriction of Hazardous Substances, refers to the EU Directive 2002/95/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous
substance in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS Directive).

17  See the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics, which score 18 major electronics

manufacturers on their policies and practices on reducing the use of hazardous substances and
voluntary take-back and recycling of end-of-life products.   Several companies have developed
products that are totally or partially free from brominated flame retardants and/or PVC, which are
listed and updated quarterly.  See:  http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/toxics/
electronics/how-the-companies-line-up

Moreover, with the fast rising prices of commodities such as
ferrous, non-ferrous and precious metals, e-waste recycling is
becoming more and more profitable as the costs of collection
and recycling are offset by the prices received for the recovered
materials.  However, this is not always the case; when dealing with
phased out technologies such as cathode ray tube TVs, hazardous
materials – in this particular case leaded glass – add extra costs to
recycling because the costs have been internalised.  Regardless
of the economics to the companies concerned, collection and
recycling of e-waste has to occur to prevent these ‘costs’ being
externalised as environmental pollution.

In countries like China and India the activities of the informal sector
present a particular challenge to companies aiming to implement
the producer responsibility principle.  Specifically, producers will
find it hard to compete economically with the performance and
efficiency of the informal sector in collecting end-of-life products,
which saves massively on their costs by paying little regard to
human health and environmental issues at the point where e-waste
is recycled or recovered.

However, the primitive recycling typical in many developing
countries also squanders material resources.  A recent study18
estimates the overall efficiency of a wet chemical process to recover
gold from printed wiring boards in India at a maximum of 20%. This
compares to 95% in a state-of-the-art facility in the EU that can
recover not only gold but also 16 other precious metals with lower
total emissions.

•	 The growing quantities of e-waste also represent a huge

•

•

resource potential.
It is essential that producers apply their resources, both
technical and economic, to ensure that the treatment of
collected waste in newly industrialised countries is improved.
This will not only bring immediate benefits from the reduced
pollution, but will reduce demand for raw materials and the
environmental and human health effects that are associated
with mining.
In all countries, it is essential to increase the collection of
e-waste and channel it towards formal recyclers; mandatory
collection targets are needed based on past sales which
need to increase over time.

•	 Ultimately, manufacturers should aim to ‘close the loop’ as

far as their own brand products are concerned by designing
out hazardous materials in electronic products to facilitate
full 100% high quality recycling (and not down-cycling)
which is safer for both production and recycling workers.

Approach

Data collection was performed to a large extent by literature and
internet research. In addition investigations and personal interviews
have been performed in selected countries.

Data about e-waste are often general and in many cases they do
not provide the degree of detail that is necessary for the aim of this
study. In these cases exemplary figures have been used as far as
possible as a basis for extrapolations.

The country specific part of the report is structured in different
sections.  “Put on the market” describes the number of
appliances sold in the country. Where no reliable data about the
end-of-life phase is available the amount of e-waste is calculated
on the basis of the past sales data.  “End-of-life” describes the
amount of e-waste occurring in the country. Imports are excluded
from the scope.  “Destinations” shows where the e-waste ends
up, focusing on how waste is treated within the country, but exports
are also taken into account where appropriate.

The term “e-waste” is not defined in a uniform way all over the
world.  It is a generic term embracing various forms of discarded
or obsolete post-consumer electrical and electronic equipment
that have ceased to be of any value to their owners.  E-waste, as
used in this report, does not refer to processing (factory) waste
from the manufacture of electrical or electronic equipment, parts,
components and sub-assemblies.

In this report the term “e-waste” is used for waste electrical and
electronic equipment as it is covered by the analysis in each
respective country. This might differ from country to country slightly
and is explained where the necessary information is available.
The term WEEE is used exclusively for waste from electrical and
electronic equipment as it is defined in the EU WEEE Directive
2002/96/EC.

Put on the market

An initial estimate for the amount of electrical and electronic
products currently placed on the market in the EU 27 countries
is 9.3 million tonnes a year.  This is significantly higher than the
predictions made in the 1990s which estimated the tonnage at
about 7 million tonnes19.

Information on the sales of electronic products is divided into the
types of appliances.  In this report we will focus mainly on PCs,
mobile phones and TVs.

PCs

Worldwide PC sales are growing, despite slower growth in the US,
Europe and Japan.  The growth in emerging markets and in the
markets for portable PCs is faster than expected20.

End-of-life

The United Nations estimates that some 20 to 50 million tonnes
of e-waste are generated worldwide each year, comprising more
than 5% of all municipal solid waste.  The quantities of e-waste
generated are expect to grow substantially in the future; developing
countries are expected to triple their output of e-wastes by 2010,
and the volume of e-waste in the EU is expected to increase by 3
– 5% a year26.

Global information on what happens to this growing mountain of
e-waste is not easily available. However, a picture can be pieced
together by looking individually at some countries and regions, where
more detailed information is available, and at the data provided by
some manufacturers, as outlined in the following section.

Two studies have recently been prepared for the EU, as part of the
WEEE Directive review. One report by the United Nations University
(UNU)27 estimates the various typical lifetimes of electrical and
electronic products used in a typical EU household. A second
report by Okopol28 has calculated the average lifetime of these
products at nine years (based on lifetimes of product categories
calculated by UNU) therefore as the estimated quantity of EEE put
on the market in 2006 is 9.3 million tonnes, Okopol projects that
9.5 million tonnes of WEEE will arise in 2016.  The following graph
shows the projection made by Okopol for EEE put on the market
up to 2020, and depicts the possible future WEEE arisings in the
EU 27 based on these projected sales and the average product
lifetime of nine years.

This estimate can be compared to the actual forecast of household
WEEE arisings made in the UNU report30, as well as their estimate
for both household and non-household WEEE.  This shows that
the projected amounts of total WEEE based on sales data are
very similar to the figures estimated by UNU for household WEEE
arisings, whereas the total WEEE arisings as estimated by UNU (for
both household and non-household WEEE) are somewhat higher.

Figure 3: Estimated total EEE put on market and WEEE arisings, compared to
UNU forecast household WEEE arisings and current WEEE estimate (EU27)

The quantities forecast by the UNU for both household and total
WEEE arisings can be compared with the amount of WEEE that
is actually collected and treated in the EU 27, based on figures
presented in the UNU report.  This can be calculated as a total of
2.1 million tonnes for 2005, and can be projected to be 5.3 million
tonnes in 2011 – representing about 30% and 73% of household
WEEE arisings respectively.  It is more realistic to compare these
collection rates to the current total WEEE arisings of between 8.3
– 9.1 million tonnes a year, which include non-household waste;
taking the average at 8.7 million tonnes, this leads to a percentage
of 24.5%.  However, the UNU figures for collection assume that all
collected WEEE will be recycled in the EU, which is not necessarily
the case as some is likely to escape the Producer Responsibility
programmes and be exported – often under the pretext of reuse.
Therefore at a minimum, over 75% of WEEE in the EU is not
collected or treated at the moment, representing a ‘hidden flow’
for which little information exists.

A few of the major producers of electronic equipment are now
providing an estimate of the percentage of waste that they are
recycling, compared to past sales, according to expected life cycle
of the average product.

The following PC manufacturers are now reporting on waste
recycled.  The amounts recycled range from 8.8% to 53% of past
sales.  It should be noted that in many cases the figures provided
by PC makers of e-waste collected and recycled are not only of
their own-brand e-waste, but also the e-waste (similar product
types) of other brands, which are collected as either as part of a
business to business (B2B) contract or a collection event organised
by one brand.

Hewlett Packard (HP) reports a reuse and recycling rate in 2006 of
10% of relevant sales (165 million pounds), but this metric includes
consumable items like printer cartridges http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/
globalcitizenship/gcreport/productreuse/performance.html

A July 2007 press release reports that HP recovered 187 million
pounds of e-waste globally in 2006 and sets a new target of 2
billion pounds by 2010 at: http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/
press/2007/070713a.html

Dell reports its recycling rate based on sales seven years ago,
which show they are ahead of schedule to meet their 2009 goal,
and report a recycling rate of 12.4% (as  percentage of sales seven
years ago) at: http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/
corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_07_19_rr_001?c=us&l=en&s=corp

Apple reports its recycling rate as a percentage of sales seven years
ago. In 2006, Apple recycled 9.5% of the weight of all products
sold seven years earlier and has set goals to recycle 13% in 2007,
to 20% in 2008 and nearly 30% in 2010. at: http://www.apple.
com/environment/recycling/

Lenovo provides figures of e-waste recycled based on past sales
(8.8% of the weight of product shipped in 1998 is recycled from
customer owned returns), but is hampered by many of its business
customers selling their e-waste to other companies and the fact
that Lenovo’s global sales operations are only  three years old.

See Sustainability Report 06/07 (p.45-46) at: http://www.pc.ibm.
com/ww/lenovo/about/sustainability/environment/Lenovo_
2006.2007_Sustainability_Report.pdf  Also at: http://www.pc.ibm.
com/ww/lenovo/about/sustainability/environment/EnvReport.html

In fiscal 2006, Sony recovered 36,355 tonnes of resources from
Japanese consumers, which included end-of-life TVs and PCs,
equating to a “resource reuse/recycling ratio of around 53% based
on average lifespan of TVs and PCs”.   http://www.sony.net/

SonyInfo/Environment/recycle/index.html

Toshiba now reports on the quantities recycled worldwide for TV
sets, refrigerators, washing machines, air-conditioners and personal
computers. It calculates the rate of weight recycled against the
weight of material shipped as products in FY2006 as approximately
19%, but does not provide a recycling percentage based on past
sales, based on the average lifespan of specific product groups.
http://www.toshiba.co.jp/env/en/industry/resource3.htm

Mobiles

Lower figures are reported for the recycling of mobile phones,
possibly because of difficulties in collection.  Two companies have
now provided estimates:

Nokia now provides a figure of 2% for mobiles recycled, but it is
unclear if this is as a percentage of all Nokia sales, or all brands of
mobiles returned – and over which period.  http://www.nokia.com/
link?cid=PLAIN_TEXT_43564  http://www.nokia.com/A4226041
Nokia does attempt to identify the fate of the remaining 98% of
end-of-life mobiles, as follows:

Table 4: Fate of Nokia products

48%

Motorola is now reporting its recycling rate of 3.32%, as a
percentage of sales, comparing them with sales 12-24 months
prior, their estimate of the lifespan of a mobile phone.  http://www.
motorola.com/content.jsp?globalObjectId=8508

Manufacturers are therefore voluntarily recycling from between 2%
- 53% of their own branded products – the average rate however,
is 9%.  This information means that for those few brands that are
reporting on the collection and recycling of their own brand PCs
and mobile phones as a percentage of past sales, the ‘hidden
flow’ of branded e-waste currently amounts to an average of
91% of past sales.   The exception is Sony, where a recycling rate
of 53% has been achieved in Japan, where WEEE legislation is in
force and most of Sony’s products are sold, leaving a hidden flow of
47%.  This shows that higher take-back and recycling targets can
be achieved with a combination of government legislation and good
company practice.

TVThe sales figures for TVs in China show a steady rise over the last few years and although the data is contradictory48, there appears to be slower growth than for PCs or mobile phones. However, as in other countries, CRT technology is increasingly being replaced with flat screen technologies.Units45,000,00040,000,00035,000,00030,000,00025,000,00020,000,00015,000,00010,000,0005,000,0000200020012002200320042005200620072008Figure 9: TV sales (units)49White goodsIn 2003 around 4 million refrigerators and 5 million washing machines were sold in China50.48 Diverging figures have been published [Xinhuanet, May 23 2004] states sales of around 10 million televisions in 2003.49 Bing Zhang (2006), China TV Market Trends by Technology, DisplaySearch, February 200650 Xinhuanet, May 23, 2004.Toxic Tech: Not in Our Backyard l  Greenpeace International l  2008 l  23

Ownership figuresThe following figures show that in urban areas, refrigerator and washing machine ownership has nearly reached the saturation phase. Ownership of colour TVs is also increasing and ownership of air conditioners and personal computers is increasing rapidly. In rural areas, black and white TVs are rapidly being replaced by colour sets. Ownership of refrigerators and washing machines is beginning to show rapid growth, whereas ownership of air conditioners is still in the introductory phase51.

The following graph shows the proportion of each type of appliance
based on number and weight.

Figures on e-waste are also contradictory.  Streicher54 reports that
more than 33 million TVs and 4.48 million PCs occur as e-waste
in China each year55, compared to the higher figure of 10 million
obsolete PCs published by Liu 200656. CBCSD cites a report by
XINHUANET which states that at least 5 million televisions, 4 million
refrigerators and 6 million washing machines are discarded in China
each year57.

Some limited information on mobile phones is also available;
according to the Ministry of Information Industry58 in the first half of
2004, 70 million mobile phones became obsolete which produced
4000 tonnes of waste.

The total figure of 74 million units of the six appliances has been
calculated by Liu59 to result in around 2.5 million tonnes of
e-waste in 2005.  This seems to be a large amount, but for
comparison, in the 27 EU countries, it is estimated that total WEEE
arisings in 2005 are between 8.3 – 9.1 million tonnes a year.  It is
also worth comparing these e-waste estimates with sales figures,
for example sales of PCs in 2001 were 10 million units, which would
correlate with Liu’s estimate of 10 million PC waste appliances in
2006, assuming a five year lifespan.

Destination

Streicher64 states that China’s domestic WEEE flows are far from
understood. One important reason for this is the fact that private
individual collectors and loosely organised collection networks
dominate the collection of e-waste. Second-hand appliance
markets also play an important role. For Beijing a survey suggests
that there are approximately 5000 individual collectors65 and 17
second-hand markets66.

According to Streicher a relatively high portion of the e-waste
occurring each year is stored at home and in offices. The time
of storage and thus the amount of e-waste from storage into
treatment is unknown. He estimates that 40% of the e-waste
appliances that occur are sold second-hand, with 14% being
dismantled manually for second-hand parts. 24% are sent for
recycling after being dismantled manually.

Liu67 published the following results from a survey on the collection
of e-waste in Beijing. He differentiates the volume flows in addition
to their destinations also by addressee: Most of the e-waste is
collected by individuals, 13% is submitted to recyclers and 4%
to producers resulting in an overall percentage that is not directly
discarded 74% (plus stored amount of 9%).

Consumers sell their old, used and non-working appliances to
private individual collectors who then pass them into informal
treatment and recovery processes, accounting for nearly 60% of
the e-waste that occurs in China68.

The majority of e-waste is processed in small workshops using very
basic methods such as manual disassembly and open incineration.
The appliances are dismantled (separation of printed circuit boards,
cathode ray tubes, cables, plastics, metals, condensers) in order to
get valuable and easily extracted components and materials, while
the remainder is dumped 69.

A number of pilot programmes for e-waste recovery facilities have
been started in China. China’s Huaxing Group is planning a site in
Beijing for a pilot WEEE recycling and treatment plant70.

Some individual producers have started campaigns for the
collection of their products in China. The following examples include
information from the manufacturers’ websites:

In January 2008 the Computer Recycling Programme (CRP)
was launched; this is a voluntary Producer Responsibility
Scheme set up and funded by 20 local and international
computer equipment suppliers, including Microsoft, Canon,
HP, Lenovo, Samsung and Philips.  The goals of the CRP
are to provide means for the public to manage their used
computer equipment in an environmentally sound manner
and to raise public awareness of the need to reduce,
reuse and recycle computer waste.  See: https://www.
wastereduction.gov.hk/en/workplace/crp_intro.htm.

•	 The initiative will start by placing over 60 public collection
points for electronics throughout Hong Kong along with
providing collection services for over 600 partnering public
and private estates and commercial buildings. The target for
the first two years is to recover 50,000 items of computer
equipment. The plan is to donate 10% of the better quality,
re-usable equipment to charity, while the rest is safely
recycled.  http://www.psfk.com/2008/01/electronics-

The Taizhou Environmental Protection Bureau states that Taizhou
now has 42 fixed-point waste processing enterprises71 capable of
processing waste including WEEE72.

It has been reported that the e-waste processing industry in
Guiyu “has been valued at about RMB 600 million per year, or
approximately US$72 million”73.

At the same time the pilot programmes in Qingdao and Zhejiang, as
well as newly established facilities, are finding it difficult to compete
with China’s large and unregulated informal sector74.

71  These are government-established industrial parks, where processing enterprises can set up

regulated recycling and disposal businesses

73  Dayoo Daily News, October 19, 2004, quoted according to Hicks 2005

74  Hicks (2005) and Liu (2006) op.cit.

Summary of results for China

The quality of the sales data for China is relatively good.  There has
been an immense increase in the ownership of electrical appliances
since the mid 1990s, and sales for several appliances are set
to continue increasing through to the year 2010 and beyond to
2020.  This will ultimately lead to ever larger quantities of end-of-life
products in the future.

There are no officially published data currently available on the
quantity of end-of-life appliances, and there are inconsistencies and
uncertainties in the data published in studies. This is especially true
in relation to the quantities of materials actually recovered.

Unsurprisingly, there is also no reliable and comprehensive
quantification of the destinations of the e-waste. This is due to
the fact that most e-waste (>60%) that is collected separately is
collected and treated by the informal sector.   In addition, it can
be assumed that there is a relatively high reuse rate and a high
percentage of storage in China.

The high collection rates are driven by economics, as the
end users often get paid for their e-waste by collectors.  The
treatment of e-waste in the informal sector is therefore most likely
to prioritise the reclamation of valuable substances; however,
reclamation rates are poor, since primitive recycling yields much
lower levels of precious metals, for example 90+% can be
achieved in a dedicated smelter compared to 20% via backyard
recycling.  There is also much less emphasis on the health and
safety of workers and the impacts on the environment that can
result from hazardous substances present in e-waste.  A lower
proportion of the e-waste will be recycled with the mixed plastics
fraction being burnt in the open or simply dumped.

Thus, it might not be necessary to focus on improving collection
rates (as is the case in several European countries, for example) but
on reducing the environmental hazards and negative health effects
from treatment in the informal sector and investing in dedicated
infrastructure to ensure high efficiencies of recycling – at least until
the time that hazardous ingredients are designed out of electronics.
There is also a challenge for multinational electronics companies
that are committed to producer responsibility, which is to compete
economically with the informal sector, since there is little incentive
for end-users to return their e-waste to the producer even for free,
when they can easily sell it to be recycled in the informal sector.
This points to the need to develop and enforce high recycling
standards to level the playing field for all recyclers.

China is fairly typical of a rapidly industrialising country where
there is already a large quantity of end-of-life appliances
being generated domestically, with high collection rates by the
informal sector.  The value of raw materials found in e-waste
combined with the low costs of processing in China due to lack
of regard for health and environmental concerns, also leads
to e-waste imports  from industrialised countries such as the
US and Europe, sometimes illegal.  The projected growth in
consumption of electrical appliances in China in the future will
lead to an explosion in the quantities of electronic scrap, even
without imports, and will only exacerbate the existing health and
environmental problems75.  China is developing new legislation
modelled on the EU’s WEEE Directive in an attempt to anticipate
this future problem and has already introduced the so-called
China RoHS, which requires labelling of specified hazardous
substances in electronic products.  It is also encouraging that
some companies are beginning to implement take-back and
recycling of their end-of-life products, although it is unclear how
much of an impact this can make on the e-waste stream as they
will need to compete with the informal recycling sector that is
paying last owners for the discarded e-waste.

Put on the market

India is considered to be a latecomer on the EEE market, which is
now growing rapidly, with the expected annual value growth in the
EEE hardware market from 2005 to 2015 estimated to be 29.8%76.
India is best known as an exporter of software but it is increasingly
becoming a sought after destination for global brands to market
their EEE products; Dell is making India its favourite investment
destination. The IT sector in the Indian economy is pegged as the
main driver for India’s future economic growth.

PCs/IT equipment

Sales data for IT equipment show a considerable increase
especially for PCs, which have risen by nearly 400% in the last six
years, while sale of laptops have grown by over 500% in two years.

15.4 million mobile phones were sold in the financial year 2004-
200586, a market which is worth 1.5 billion EUR. The price per
mobile phone varied between 30 EUR and about 340 EUR,
although the majority (60%) cost less than 70 EUR87.

Since then the market has increased enormously, including an
increase in replacement sales.  MAIT-GTZ88 reports that sales
of mobile handsets, including new users and replacements,
have increased to 93 million units in 2007.  Two years ago, the
replacement market was barely 8-10% of total sales; at present it
accounts for a 20-25% share.

The market leader is the OEM Nokia, with over half of the market,
followed by Samsung and LG.

White goods

After a steep rise in sales of washing machines during the 90s
the figures have levelled off since the year 2000. The sales of
refrigerators are much higher, however, the rise in sales figures has
been more moderate and steady (see following table 9).

In rural areas 9.8% of households own a washing machine
compared to 16.7% in the cities95. However for white goods as
a whole the absolute market in rural areas is the same size as in
urban areas96.

Regarding refrigerators four companies had market shares above
10% in 2004 (with Whirlpool the biggest at 23%). For washing
machines LG has the largest share of the market at 27.3%,
followed by Videocon, Whirlpool and Samsung.

Previous estimates put the annual generation of e-waste in India
at around 146 000 tonnes per year101 which is around 0.1327kg
per inhabitant per year, a very low figure which is unlikely.
However, the proportions of the types of e-waste generated
are given, showing that three categories of e-waste account for
almost 90% of the generation

End-of-life

Amounts

A recent study by MAIT-GTZ99 reported that a total of 330,000
metric tonnes of e-waste (computers, televisions and mobile
handsets only) was generated in 2007.  An additional 50,000
tonnes were illegally imported into the country, mostly mislabelled
as charitable donations or scrap, and not specified as electronic
scrap, giving a total annual e-waste arising of about 380,000.  Of
this, only 19,000 tonnes were recycled ‘due to high refurbishing and
reuse of electronics products in the country and also due to poor
recycling infrastructure’.  Generation of e-waste in India is estimated
to rise to 470,000 metric tonnes by 2011.   MAIT-GTZ calculates
the breakdown of e-waste generation as follows100:

450,000

400,000

350,000

300,000

Figure 20: Breakdown of E-Waste Generated (Imports, Computers, Mobiles

Figure 21: Composition of e-waste102

At a minimum 52% of e-waste - large household appliances and
‘other’ - is not included in the estimate of 330,000 metric tonnes
of computers, TVs and mobiles in the study by MAIT-GTZ.  It can
therefore be reasonably assumed that a total of at least 660,000
metric tonnes of e-waste was generated in India in 2007, which can
be projected to increase to at least 970,000 metric tonnes by 2011.

With regard to the occurrence of e-waste Mumbai, Delhi and
Bangalore are the “highest ranking” cities. It is estimated that in
Bangalore alone around 30,000 computers become obsolete every
year from the IT industry because of a high obsolescence rate of
30% per year103. At least for IT equipment it can be expected that
in the future the absolute amount of end-of-life PCs will be higher in
rural areas compared to the big cities.

Destinations

Initiatives by Manufacturers

Some producers have started to build up their own take-back
systems. However, these approaches often focus primarily on
business users and are restricted to big cities.  Some examples are:

Computers

•	 Hewlett Packard offers recycling of hardware but only

for its business customers in India, see:  http://h50055.

Lenovo offers recycling and/or environmentally conscious
disposal services for all Lenovo branded PCs, products
and IBM branded PCs, Notebooks, and Monitors
manufactured by Lenovo after 1 May, 2005.  See:
http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/lenovo/about/sustainability/
environment/ptb_india.html

Acer has an e-waste programme to recycle their products
in the Indian market. The programme takes website or
e-mail registrations followed by consumers sending their
old items back to Acer India for treatment. Recyclable
items include desktop computers, notebook computers,
screens, projectors and servers. The programme is Acer’s
initial step into product recycling.  http://www.global.acer.
com/about/sustainability32.htm#5  and http://www.acer.
co.in/home/ewaste.asp

Most recycling or disposal happens in the “informal treatment
sector” in India.  However, most used electronics products are
not recycled but ‘either put to use for less resource intensive
applications or given to relatives/friends for further use’, put into
storage or sole or exchanged; these products are then refurbished
and resold104.

The second-hand market plays an important role in India. MAIT-
GTZ reports that almost 50% of the PC’s sold in India are products
of the secondary market that have been re-assembled from old
components105.

It can be assumed that a relatively high portion of the e-waste is
collected in India because of the value of the raw materials and the
second-hand market. However, reports about the treatment of e-
waste in India show that much of it is treated in a way that involves
high risks for human health and the environment and is inefficient
in terms of squandering valuable resources due to primitive
reprocessing practices.

The study by MAIT-GTZ (see above) reports on recycling practices
and estimates that of the 19,000 tonnes of waste recycled ‘95% of
the e-waste is segregated dismantled and recycled in the informal
sector based in urban slums’.  The remaining 5% is recycled by the
two formal recyclers operating in the South and West of India; it is
expected that several more formal recycling facilities will be coming
on line in the next few years106.  This means that of the total amount
of e-waste ‘available for recycling’ (144,143 metric tonnes), only
0.7% is currently recycled in formal recycling facilities, which means
that at least 99.3% is the hidden flow of e-waste that escapes
formal recycling.

The West and South of India account for the largest proportion of
the e-waste generated at 35% and 30% respectively.  While the
North of India is not a leading generator of e-waste, at 21%, it is the
leading processing centre of e-waste in the country, all of which is
in the informal recycling sector107.

Summary of results for India

India can be considered a significant global hotspot for e-waste in
the coming years. In contrast with China no specific WEEE related
regulation or legislation is proposed in India, and is not yet on the
political agenda.

Data quality on sales in India is quite good and calculations are now
available on the overall amounts of e-waste that arise. However,
real life quantitative figures about amounts of e-waste that arise
and its destination have not been made for all types of e-waste. As
in China, most discarded equipment is sold to the informal market
which by its nature is uncontrolled and does not report reuse and
recycling data.

The sales figures show that unsaturated markets still exist in India
for many types of appliances, where a newly sold appliance does
not yet replace an existing appliance. However, the markets are
now becoming saturated in urban areas, with more growth, and
potential for future growth, in rural areas.

It can therefore be concluded that in the future the development
of e-waste collection systems outside of the big cities will become
increasingly important.  The cost for collection per collected
kilogram could also be expected to rise due to greater collection
efforts in areas with lower population density involving higher costs.

Currently, the percentage of collected e-waste is not well
documented but the available estimations show that relatively
high rates are collected, probably due to the high value of some
components of electronic waste that are then recovered by the
informal treatment sector.

Because the sales data is reported in units and e-waste generation
in weight it is not possible to determine the recovery rate as a value
relative to the sales data.

Businesses continue to play an important role in the consumption
patterns for IT equipment, and sales to businesses continue to
increase. This fact could be used by producers of IT equipment as
a starting point for their own activities to take over responsibility for
their own-branded end-of-life products, as the relationship between
producer and business user is closer than the relationship between
producer and private end user (except for Dell).

Like China, collection rates in India are determined by the informal
sector, where the focus is on the recovery of valuable raw materials
and not on the health and environmental hazards inherent in e-
waste, resulting in environmental pollution and exposure of workers
to hazardous substances in the recycling of e-waste.  This also
leads to the import of e-waste from developed countries such as
the US and the EU, which add to the growing e-waste problem in
India.  As domestic sales of electrical and electronic appliances are
set to escalate the quantities of e-waste will be much higher in the
future.  If the current methods of recovering raw materials continue
this will lead to further environmental and health problems from the
recycling of e-waste.   Unlike China, there is no plan to develop
legislation to tackle the e-waste problem.

Put on the market

It is estimated that 1.9 million TVs, around 750 000 PCs and
550 000 monitors, 21.7 million mobile phones and almost 2
million household white goods (580 000 washing machines, 1
million refrigerators and 340 000 air conditioners) were sold in
Thailand in 2004108.   Excluding air conditioners, this amounts to
145,400 tonnes109

EEI110 states that two years ago there were 12 million mobile
phones used, 3 million units were substituted and 9 million units
were new.  This compares with 340,000 mobile phones ten years
previously.  The average service life of the phones was three to five
years and the batteries 12-18 months.

End-of-life

According to EEI in 2005 1.4 million TVs, 430 000 PCs and 21
million mobile phones occurred as e-waste111. The growth in the
amount of e-waste is shown in the following figure.

The figure is projected to increase by 12% a year to 4.3 million units in 2010, or approximately 128,220 tonnes.  It is also estimated that the number of waste mobile phones and their batteries was 11.5 million units in 2003 and will continue to rise up to 203.27 million units in 2010113. 112  EEI (2007), op.cit. 113  PCD 2006 data source not available.Another estimation made in 2003 shows that around 90,000 tonnes
of e-waste was generated each year in Thailand114 (see table below).

According to the Pollution Control Department of Thailand more
than 90% of the e-waste that occurred in 2003 was disposed
together with other waste115.

End-of-life electronic products are not uniformly managed, TVs,
PCs and CRT are dismantled by informal collectors, and saleable
parts are sold to private traders116.  There is not yet a proper
management system, i.e. segregation and collection, for e-waste in
the country. When products reach their end-of-life, some are sold
to the second-hand market and some are simply disposed of along
with municipal wastes117.

environment/ptb_thailand.html

The “informal sector” plays an important part in the e-waste
management system118; most of the e-waste from households
is dismantled and recovered in the informal sector.  A large
proportion of e-waste is refurbished and resold, and not always
for appropriate uses - for example, computer monitors have
even been converted into aquariums with no consideration of
the hazards involved119. The rate of recovery of materials from
the treatment of e-waste is described by the same source
as 60-70%. Most e-waste activities such as dismantling and
material reclamation are done by bare hand or with small tools
in scrap yards or people’s own homes120.  There have been
several documented cases of damage to human health or the
environment caused directly by the processing of WEEE121

When e-wastes are discarded with other wastes, individual waste
collectors pick up the valuable/recyclable wastes, sort them,
and sell them on to waste dealers or bigger recycling shops. The
recyclable parts are then sold to material recycling industries based
on the type of waste.

Imports of e-waste occur either for reconditioning and resale or for
recycling.  For example, second-hand computers and notebooks
are increasingly being imported from Japan and sold; the parts
are upgraded in Japan and the repaired notebooks are sold at
a lower price.  Mobile phones are imported from the US and EU
for reconditioning and resale.  The destination of most e-waste
imported for recycling is not known, apart from three formal
recycling factories where the WEEE has been properly managed122.

Summary of results for Thailand

The quality of data for sales figures is limited, and although some
data on e-waste quantities are available from calculations, they
are based on a survey in 2003.  There are also contradictions in
the figures provided by the two different sources124.  There is no
quantification of the rate of recovered waste or other aspects of the
treatment of e-waste in Thailand.

Thailand does not yet have a comprehensive management system
for e-waste in place which makes it difficult to obtain information
on the quantities of e-waste and their treatment and recovery rates.
As for China and India, the informal sector plays an important
role in managing e-wastes and since it’s “informal”, it is not really
controlled.  The large OEM manufacturers are beginning to offer
take-back and recycling services for some product types, but there
is no information yet on their success, as these are in early stages
and they will be competing with the informal sector for the return of
end-of-life products.

A strategy of integrated WEEE management is under consideration
by the National Pollution Control Committee and is due to be
approved by the National Environment Committee and Cabinet in
the near future125.  Although the strategy was based on the polluter
pays principle and the responsibilities of importers, manufacturers
and consumers it has weak producer responsibility requirements.

In December 2004 the large mobile phone providers, Nokia and
the Pollution Control Department aimed to set up a mobile phone
and battery waste collection system in the year 2007, for further
management by the private sector123.

back of mobile phones at service points in Thailand,
at: http://www.nokia.com/NOKIA_COM_1/Corporate_
Responsibility/Environment/Consumer_Information/
Mobile_Phone_Take-back/swf/main.html   However, a
Greenpeace survey in October 2007 showed that Nokia
staff in Thailand were not aware that a take-back service
was offered, contrary to the website information, and in
the Philippines staff were poorly informed about the take-
back service offered.

PCs

PC sales for 2007 are projected at 1.5 million (37,500 tonnes), and
12% of this figure represents portable computers.  PC ownership in
Argentina is at 29%126.  Projecting the likely arisings of e-waste from
this figure, assuming an average life-time of seven years127, e-waste
arisings in 2014 from PCs alone would be 37,500 tonnes

End-of-life

WEEE for Argentina is estimated at 1.3 million printers and 9.5
million computer units in 2007.

the current information available on Argentina and for Latin America

This also results in a change in producer’s share of the market or the replacement of previous producers by new producers. The increase in sales of new TVs is being driven in part also by the move to digital TV.132  US EPA (2007) op.cit.End-of-life

Total Quantities of e-waste generated in the US

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a report
in 2005 that estimates the amount of e-waste from selected
appliances (TVs, VCRs, DVD players, video cameras, stereo
systems, telephones, and computer equipment). According to this
source 2.63 million tons134 of e-waste occurred in 2005135.

In 2007 a new report by the US EPA was published that covers
televisions, PCs (including peripherals) and mobile phones. It
estimates that the amount of e-waste that occurred in 2005 was
up to 2 million tons. The following tables (15 and 16) show the
numbers of e-waste appliances that are calculated to have been
discarded, which rise from 200 million units in 2003 to nearly 350
million in 2005, and their weight.

134  The US EPA refers to tons, rather than metric tonnes, which is used elsewhere in this report.  1

ton = 2240lbs, 1 tonne = 1000kg

Although the average weight of individual mobile phones is decreasing,
the weight of end-of-life products continues to increase due to the higher
number of devices being discarded.

The International Association of Electronics Recyclers (IAER) provides a
slightly higher estimate of an average of about 400 million units a year will
be scrapped in the US, of the various categories of consumer electronics,
amounting to 3 billion units in the rest of this decade138.  This is a projection
based on the current growth and obsolescence rates.  It is possible that
more categories of consumer electronics are included in these figures.

According to the US EPA in 2005, less than 20% of the e-waste
categories televisions, PC including peripherals and mobile phones
were separated from other waste streams for “further processing and
recovery139.  It has to be taken into account that “further processing
and recovery” includes the export of e-waste. The following figure

The IAER states that around 500 treatment and recycling
companies were in operation in the US in 2005 (up to 450 in
2003). The total amount of e-waste for 2003 is estimated by
IAER as 2.8 million tons. 1.4 million tons were treated by IAER
member companies and 0.7 million tons of recyclable fractions
were reclaimed 140.  It has to be taken into account that this data
includes exports and that some types of appliances are included
that were not in the scope of the EPA study.

Figure 28 shows the proportions of e-waste that are recycled, disposed and put into storage; the US EPA calculates that a high percentage of appliances are assumed to be stored or reused.Figure 28: Electronic Products Recycled, Disposed, or Going into Storage/Reuse 2003 – 2005 (% by weight)  141End-of-life PCs and the ‘hidden flow’The US EPA [2007] gives the following figures on the amount of treated142 end-of-life desktop PCs.  Million Units6.05.04.03.02.01.00200020012002200320042005Approach OneApproach TwoFigure 29 - Number of Desktops treated (values calculated by US EPA)143 141  US EPA (2007), op.cit.142   The term “recycled” as used in the US EPA study could be misleading because the data reflect amounts that are processed in treatment plants143  US EPA (2007) op.cit.The US EPA explains the two approaches as follows: “Approach
One determined the amount recycled based on industry sources,
and estimated the disposal amounts by calculating the difference
between what is generated for end-of-life management and
what is collected for recycling on an annual basis: disposal
amount equals quantity generated for end-of-life management
minus the amount recycled. Approach Two calculated the
amount disposed of based on five states’ waste sorting studies
extrapolated to the national rate, and estimated the amount
recycled by calculating the difference between what is generated
for end-of-life management and what is disposed of: recycled
amount equals quantity generated for end-of-life management
minus amount disposed”.”

When compared to the sales figures it becomes obvious that US
EPA sees much lower quantities of end-of-life desktop PCs that
are available for recovery or disposal and much slower growth in
e-waste quantities, than the amounts that are sold.

The following Greenpeace analysis compares the figures on PC
sales (Figure 23) and PCs disposed of (Figure 29). (In both cases
the median between Approaches One and Two were used for
calculation.)  An average lifespan of seven years144 has been
assumed for these calculations.

This shows that recycling rates for desktops are going down, from
almost 17% in 2000 to 10.9% in 2005, due to the fact that sales
have increased more than recycling efforts.  The key question is,
where are the other 80-90% of the desktops sold between 1993
and 1998?

( In both cases the median between Approaches One and Two were used for calculation.)  The various TV technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma) have different life spans; for the purposes of these calculations a lifespan of 20 years has been assumed.Table 20: Comparison of TV sales and TVs disposed ofTV Units treated in mln (Fig 5)Year treatedTV units sold in mlnYear of salesTreated as a % of sales in year x (lifespan of product = 10 years for TVs)c. 3.55200526199513.6%c. 3.5200427198412.9%c. 3.45200326.5199313.0%c. 3.05200225.5199211.9%c. 2.95200121199114.0%c. 2.85200023.5199012.1%146  US EPA (2007) op.cit.This shows that between 83% and 87% of all TV sales from 1980 to 1985 are either still in people’s homes (used or obsolete) or have escaped any waste management, and that the percentage of e-waste remains more or less at the same level, due to the increase in sales.

The US EPA presents detailed information for the destination of
cathode ray tube TVs and monitors (CRT), which contain lead; 75%
of the CRT is exported for “refurbishing or remanufacturing into
new TVs or specialty monitors abroad” and “CRT glass-to-glass
factories abroad”.  However, about 30% of the CRT destined for
remanufacturing abroad is not technically suitable for this purpose
and has to be recycled or disposed of, which also occurs abroad.

The comparison of sales figures for CRT TVs plus CRT monitors
with the total numbers of CRT monitors disposed of, as described
by the US EPA, suggests that there is a knowledge gap about the
final destination of several 100,000 tons of CRT149.

149  Within the US EPA figures the calculation is coherent because the calculation is based on

relatively long usage times and a relatively high percentage of CRT appliances getting a “second
life” (stored or reused).

Take Back Activity in US

As yet there is no federal e-waste legislation and the management
of end-of-life electronic products varies from State to State within
the US. In 2003, 38 States had some sort of WEEE management
programme and CRTs were prohibited from landfill sites in four
states. There are also regional initiatives for WEEE management150.
At the national level the general focus of the US EPA is on the
concept of product stewardship.

Individual US States are enacting legislation to address e-waste,
so far nine have passed e-waste recycling laws; Connecticut,
Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, North Carolina, Texas,
Washington and California.  All of these laws, except for California,
require producer responsibility to a greater or lesser degree151.  In
California, the legislation requires an Advanced Recycling Fee
(ARF), a policy supported by a coalition of TV manufacturers,
which requires consumers to pay a $6 – $10 recycling tax when
purchasing electronic products, which provides no incentive for
producers to improve the design of their products.

Key players in industry that are engaged in WEEE management
include the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)
and the US trade association representing electro industry
manufacturers. US-based multinational companies have also
become involved in WEEE management both in the US and
globally. Particularly active companies include Apple, AT&T, HP, IBM
and Motorola.

A wide range of federal projects has been established to address
particular aspects of the problem. Many of these are mirrored by
regulatory approaches and associated programmes in a number of
US states.

One of the main issues facing the US is the challenge of
establishing effective governance structures to deal with the
waste electronics issue. The political structure of the US makes
it difficult to develop national scale programmes, since the power
invested in state legislatures enables states to make decisions and
implement policies that relate to their own political, economic and
environmental agendas.

A report for the European Commission states “However, one of
the main issues facing the US is the challenge of establishing
effective governance structures to deal with the WEEE issue. The
political structure of the US makes it difficult to develop national
scale programmes. The case of the US highlights the importance
of a proper legal framework and controls needed to accompany
WEEE directive or any similar measure”152.   Most crucial to any
e-waste recycling federal law, would be a ban on the export of
collected e-waste.

There have been, however, some significant regulatory
developments and multi stakeholder dialogues in the US. There are
a number of regional initiatives, such as the NorthEast Recycling
Council, NorthEast Waste Management Officials Association and
the Northwest Product Stewardship Council. These bodies work
at regional level to develop legislative policy with states and local
communities.

Examples of active WEEE programmes at state level include the
Minnesota Office of Environmental Assistance. (MOEA) developed
a state product stewardship policy that is being implementing
through voluntary partnerships with businesses and government
agencies. An electronics task force focusing on CRTs will make
recommendations for recovery and recycling goals in the state,
identify alternative (non-governmental) financing mechanisms, and
obtain commitments for managing end-of-life electronics from
manufacturers, sellers, and product users.

Summary of results for the US

The sales figures show that the US has mature markets for most
electrical and electronic products such as TVs (although the switch
to digital is driving TV sales), and although sales of PCs and mobile
phones are growing faster, overall these are still relatively low
growth rates, compared to countries like India and China. In spite
of this situation the rates of separately collected and recovered
waste appliances is growing at a much slower pace, and, for some
products, the percentage of quantities collected are even declining
compared to past sales. This low growth in collection and recovery
figures is also starting from low collection rates.

The US EPA states, for example, that 25% of end-of-life PCs,
laptops and monitors have been collected for recovery in 2005,
13% of TVs and 19% of mobile phones. With regard to these
numbers two points have to be taken into account:

•

•

the US EPA data assume that a relatively high
percentage of appliances are stored at home or
reused. Based on comparison with other data from
saturated replacement markets lower storage and
reuse rates would be expected, resulting in even
lower actual collection rates.

The data on e-waste collected for recovery includes
e-waste for export.   For example, for CRT monitors
and TVs the US EPA itself publishes concerns
on whether the exported waste is treated in an
appropriate way.

Overall the available data give a picture of a relatively undeveloped
collection and recovery system for e-waste in a mature and
developed market for electrical and electronic appliances.

Available data about actual e-waste amounts generated (as
opposed to calculated theoretical data) are most often exemplary
data from individual regions of the US, individual activities like take
back actions or sporadic calculated data. The lack of nationwide
collection and monitoring approaches for e-waste results in a
situation where no comprehensive data is available. The publication
by US EPA in 2007 is an important overview that is unfortunately
restricted to few selected types of appliances. The most relevant
appliances as far as quantities are concerned (white goods) are
not included in this analysis.  Published figures on the sales of
white goods such as washing machines and refrigerators are also
not easily available.   Based on figures from other countries with
comparable consumption patterns it can be assumed that the total
amount of e-waste from private households is three times the size
of the US EPA figure of 2.63 million tons (1.19 million tonnes), at
7.89 million tons (3.58 million tonnes).

The US is an example of what happens when the e-waste problem
is relatively unregulated in an industrialised country.  Without the
economic incentive that consumers have in China and India to sell
their old equipment for reuse or recycling, only small amounts of
e-waste are collected and much of that is not recycled within the
US, but is exported instead, thus shifting the problem to newly
industrialised countries that are even less equipped to deal with
the hazardous substances in e-waste.  Although many of the large
manufacturers are now operating their own take-back schemes,
and certain US States have developed or are developing take-back
legislation, the challenges will be to substantially increase collection
rates and at the same time to develop an infrastructure and
capacity where e-waste is safely dismantled, recycled or reused
domestically.  The first priority within this scenario is to end the
export of e-waste from the US.

Europe

Put on the market

The United Nations University (UNU)153 published a report in
2007, which states that in the EU27, 9.3 million tonnes of
electrical and electronic products were put on the market in
2005, based on scaled up data from nine national registries.
This is significantly higher than the estimates made in the 1990s
of about 7 million tonnes.

Markets for electrical and electronic products within the European
Union are diverse. The markets in the “new” Member States are
not yet as saturated as the “old” Member States and sales figures
per inhabitant as well as use patterns for electronics differ widely.
These differences can influence the amount of WEEE occurring in
each Member State and have to be kept in mind when considering
the following figures.

The average lifetime of desktop PCs in offices was estimated by
industry to be six years and for home users five years157. Laptops
are used in both markets for around four and a half years.  The sale
of laptops is increasing at a faster rate than desktops, and flat panel
monitors are now replacing sales of cathode ray monitors.  20%
of equipment in Europe goes on to have a “second life” with an
additional lifetime of two to three years158.

End-of-life

Amounts

The United Nations University164 has estimated the total WEEE
arising in 2005 for the EU27 at 8.3 – 9.1 million tonnes a year,
for all e-waste.  The forecast household WEEE arisings are 7.2
million in 2005; an annual growth rate of between 2.5% and 2.7%
is predicted, leading to a total WEEE arising of about 10.6 million
tonnes by 2020 from household sources.  If business to business
WEEE is included this could rise to 12.3 million tonnes, which is
equivalent to about 24 kg per inhabitant.

UNU also estimates the typical life of the various types of
appliances, ranging from 3 to 20 years.  Okopol165 has estimated
the average typical life of electrical and electronic appliances, based
on UNU, as nine years.

The European Environmental Agency published data on the total
amount of waste electric and electronic equipment for four types of
appliances including forecasts until 2010.

Figure 36: Waste potential per inhabitant for 2003 for four appliances:
refrigerators, TV sets, personal computers and photocopiers, by country169.

However, it has to be taken into account that the calculation of
WEEE amounts given in these tables is often hindered by the
fact that categorisation of sales figures do not fit well with the
categorisation of WEEE collection approaches and that there is a
great deal of uncertainty in determining the weight of WEEE per
appliance. The collection rates for WEEE achieved in 2006 in some
European countries (e.g. more than 11kg per inhabitant per year in
Sweden) show that the amounts given in this study represent the
lower end of the range of possible estimates.

According to the European Commission, the total amount of
WEEE will increase in Europe at an expected rate of at least 3% to
5% per year170.

Table 28: WEEE collected by some compliance schemes172

Information on actual mass flows of e-waste in EU as a whole
is not (yet) available. The implementation of the WEEE Directive
in the European Member States and the reporting requirements
resulting from this Directive will improve this situation in the
coming years.

UNU171 has estimated the amount of WEEE collected in the EU27
at 2.1 million tonnes, equivalent to about 5 kg per inhabitant.   The
percentage of large sized appliances collected is roughly 40%,
and medium appliances roughly 25%.  This is projected to rise
to 53 million tonnes in 2011 (assuming full implementation of
the WEEE Directive and an increase in collection), which would
be about 11 kg per inhabitant.  The percentage of large sized
appliances collected would be roughly 75% and medium and
small sized appliances would be 60%.

Information on specific amounts of collected WEEE is also published
for some compliance schemes as shown in the table below.

Presently the producers of electrical and electronic products
organise their responsibilities for end-of-life products with the
support of compliance schemes, which fulfil these responsibilities
on behalf of the producers. They can be regional schemes or
European schemes (see also below in the Member States’
chapters). Presently around 150 different schemes or Producer
Responsibility Organisations are operating in Europe.

Presutto177 states that the “major five companies, representing 21
brands, account for about 80% of the global turnover”.

The French producers register for the national implementation of
the WEEE Directive describes the amount of appliances marketed
in 2006 as 1.2 million tonnes

173  EITO (2007), op.cit.

174  EITO (2007, op.cit.

ADEME178 estimates the total amount of WEEE in France at
between 1.7 and 2 million tonnes per year (household + business)
representing around 16kg per inhabitant per year. This fits quite
well with the figures presented by APCM179 showing a total amount
of WEEE of 1.5 million tonnes per year, of which 650 000 tonnes
comes from households. ADEME also calculates a specific amount
of WEEE from private households of 16kg per inhabitant per year,
with another source estimating that 14 kg per inhabitant per year
comes from households180.

It has been calculated that the amount of waste white goods is at
around 1.1 million tonnes in 2006, for TVs at around 0.16 million
tonnes, for mobile phones at around 6 000 tonnes and for PCs at
around 71 000 tonnes181.

A survey by ADEME182 identified 253 registered treatment sites in France.

Information about recovery rates is not yet available.

It is not possible to calculate the ‘hidden flow’ of e-waste, as sales
data doesn’t go back far enough to estimate what percentage
might be coming back and how this may increase in the future.
Furthermore the sales data is in units and the e-waste data in weight.

White goods

Germany is the largest white goods market in Europe. However,
sales data have not been found to be available in the course of
the investigations for this study. The German market is a saturated
market (refrigerators 99% saturation in 2005 and washing machines
95%) where new appliances replace old ones.  However, it shows a
stable development regarding market values 188.

GFU185 reports shipment to private consumers of 1.656 million
Desktop PCs in 2005 and 1.450 million Desktop PC in 2006
(average prices 669 EUR and 648 EUR). For notebooks 1.945
units in 2005 and 2.280 units in 2006 have been reported (average
prices 1.053 EUR and 958 EUR).   However, these figures are
not consistent with the data provided by EITO

TV

The total sales of TVs to private consumers in 2005 was 5.758
million units and in 2006 5.950 units186.   The average price was
615 EUR in 2005 and 715 EUR in 2006.

Mobile phones

GFU187 reports shipment to private consumers of 20 million mobile
phones in 2005 and 20.740 million mobile phones in 2006.  The
average price was 195 EUR per unit in 2005 and 186 EUR per

The collection of WEEE in Germany is undertaken by municipalities;
to date no aggregated collected quantities have been published.

It can be expected that producers with a high share of the market
will be registered according to the German implementation of the
WEEE Directive and have contracted a compliance scheme that
fulfils the requirements of the implementation of the WEEE Directive.

Quantified data about the recovery of WEEE in Germany are not
yet available.

End-of-life

Little data about the quantities of e-waste arising is available
in Poland. The Polish association of household appliances197
estimates the amount for 2006 at around 321,333 tonnes or 8 kg
per inhabitant per year. However, the basis for these figures is not
clear and it is therefore uncertain which types of appliances are
included or excluded from these figures.

A rough estimation based on the relation of appliances as found
in other European Member States results in an amount of about
200,000 tonnes of waste white goods, about 32,000 tonnes
of waste TVs, about 1,200 tonnes of mobile phones and about
10,000 tonnes of PCs for 2006.

According to a recent press notice Poland will miss the collection
target of the WEEE Directive of 4kg per inhabitant per year for
2008 and will not achieve this amount before 2008. The amount
of WEEE collected in 2006 was 13,000 tonnes and the amount
will drop to 1,000 tonnes in 2007 due to lack of implementation of
the WEEE Directive198.

No other more detailed figures have been found quantifying the
actual amount of recovered WEEE.

The data situation on the actual amounts of e-waste collected and
treated in the Netherlands is very good compared to other countries,
mainly because two collection systems have been in place for several
years that generate data on a homogeneous basis, one system for IT
equipment and one for WEEE other than ICT.

In 2002, ICT Milieu collected a total of 9,900 tonnes of IT
equipment (e.g. computers, screens, mobile phones). According
to ICT Milieu this was 80%-90% of the available amount of this
type of e-waste202.  However, it has been stated by Greenpeace
Netherlands that a rate of 40% is more realistic. NVMP, the Dutch
take-back system for WEEE other than ICT, collected approximately
65,000 tonnes of WEEE in 2002203.

The following table shows the volumes of WEEE collected per

According to GP Netherlands the Dutch Environmental Inspection
states a specific amount of e-waste of 15kg per inhabitant a year,
while a recyclers organisation states an amount of 18 to 20kg/inh/y.

The Dutch Inspectorate VROM205 investigated illegal exports of
WEEE in 2004 and found that offences were frequently being
committed with the result that large quantities of waste equipment
were circumventing the take-back system set up by producers
and importers.  Unregistered collectors were illegally exporting
equipment, much of which was faulty, to developing countries.   In
2006 the Inspectorate initiated enforcement actions and as a result
the percentage of contraventions has fallen.  More than 60% of
retailers were contravening the rules in 2004, compared with 11%
in 2006.  Inspections of a carefully chosen selection of businesses
in 2005 revealed that 40% had contravened the rules, compared
with 28% in 2006.

Fifty-seven contraventions of WEEE export regulations were
uncovered by Police and Customs during these enforcement
actions; almost two thirds of these contraventions related to
consignments which had originated in other countries and were
being exported from the EU via the Netherlands; Germany was
the largest source of these illegal shipments, followed by the
Netherlands, the UK and then France.  The Inspectorate notes that:
‘This number could in fact increase, because take-back systems
that are open to abuse by the illegal trade are being set up all over
Europe’.  However, currently the number of contraventions that
are being identified is on the decrease, whereas in the past many
consignments of old lorries and cars full of e-waste destined for
Africa were uncovered.

The UK TV market still shows an increase in the overall sales.
However, the change of technology from cathode ray tube (CRT) to
flat screens is driving the market more significantly, as is the move
to digital TV.

The UK market for white goods shows small increases of sales
figures in the years from 2001 to 2005. These increases result
mainly from replacement sales of refrigerators.

A study done by ICER for the Environment Agency211 estimated
that 160,000 tonnes of waste equipment were exported from the
UK in 2004, representing between 10% to 15% of WEEE arisings in
the UK.  130,000 tonnes were IT/telecoms equipment, largely from
businesses, of which 110,000 were declared exports to permitted
destinations; 23,000 were undeclared or ‘grey market’ exports to
non-OECD destinations.  The remaining 30,000 tonnes were large
household appliances and TVs, sourced from civic amenity sites
and retailer take-back.

The ultimate destinations of the e-waste include Eastern Europe,
the Far East, the Indian subcontinent, African and China.
Transhipment destinations include Rotterdam, Gibraltar and the
Middle East.  Details of over 20 operators involved in exporting
WEEE were found and it was estimated that there could 100 to 200
of these operators; the value of the trade is estimated to be worth
tens of millions of pounds.

There is no information on what the exact situation is currently, now
that the EU WEEE Directive has been implemented, however, this
study shows that there was a large and established trade in the
export of e-waste in 2003.

In another reference it is estimated that 939,000 tonnes of domestic
equipment were discarded in the UK in 2003. The starting point for
WEEE estimations was sales data for 2003. This amounts to 16 kg
per person and four items per household,

of WEEE collected or its destination.

The costs224 for collection and recovery of IT equipment are at
around 5 Cent per kg of sold equipment225. Per unit of equipment
this equates to the following costs:

Summary of results for the EU

The data situation regarding sales of EEE in the EU is relatively
good even when accessibility is partly restricted by high costs.  The
data shows a diverse picture, where markets are relatively saturated
in some countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, and still
growing in others, like Poland.

The implementation of the WEEE Directive means that collection
and recovery of end-of-life appliances within the EU is much more
developed than in the US.   The available information is set to
improve over the coming years.  Nevertheless, overall figures for the
quantities of e-waste generated are now available, which show that
current collection rates are about 5 kg per inhabitant, equivalent to
2.2 million tonnes a year; this is about 25% of the estimated waste
arising of 8.3-9.1 million tonnes in 2005.  Total e-waste arising,
including business to business, could rise to 12.3 million tonnes by
2020, the equivalent of 24 kg per inhabitant.

Significant differences can be observed between the Member
States: where nationwide systems for the collection and treatment
of e-waste have been established for several years (e.g. the
Netherlands) a much better data situation can be observed than
in countries without such a comprehensive system or where data
collection has just been started under the requirements of the
European WEEE Directive.  Information on the destinations of
the e-waste collected is not always available; for example, it is
not shown whether any e-waste collected in Europe is exported.
However, studies done in the UK and the Netherlands show that an
established trade in e-waste exports existed in 2003 and that this
trade continues in 2006, albeit at a reduced level.

So far, only countries like the Netherlands have information on
recovery rates, which are high for the collected amounts (>60%) but
low compared to Japanese brands reporting under the Japanese
Household Appliance Recycling Law.  More and more data on
collection rates are now published by European Member States in
response to the WEEE Directive. The highest collection rates per
inhabitant per year (inh/y) in the EU are in Sweden at 12 kg/inh/y.
Outside the EU, the collection rate in Norway is higher at 28kg/
inh/y.  The WEEE Directive’s requirement to collect 4kg/inh/y was
already achieved in some Member States such as the Netherlands
and Sweden five years ago.

2006 was the first year where the WEEE Directive was
implemented in several Member States in practice. It is expected
that the data situation will improve significantly with the finalisation
of the first round of reporting at the end of 2007. However,
comparison of data across Member States is hampered by the
lack of harmonisation of WEEE product categories. Overall, the EU
represents a market which is relatively saturated, where serious
efforts are being made by governments and companies combined
to collect and recover e-waste.
