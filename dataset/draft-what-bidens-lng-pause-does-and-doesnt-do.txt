 MEDIA BRIEFING: U .S . LIQUEFIED GAS FLOODING EUROPE  1Key Findings
• If Europe enacts ambitious climate change policies to phase out fossil gas use by 2035, then 
Europe will be able to halt all imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) prior to 2030 .1 
• Policies to phase down gas consumption in Europe would remove the need for new LNG export 
terminals in the United States, which would in turn help phase out harmful oil and gas drilling 
across the U.S. – from Texas to Pennsylvania. 
• Such policies would help put both the U.S. and Europe on a pathway to limit global warming to 
1.5°C (2.7°F) and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.
• However, the oil and gas industry is seizing a moment of crisis to drive a massive build out of 
LNG infrastructure on both sides of the Atlantic that will lock us into reliance on fossil gas and 
put our climate goals out of reach. 
• This build out is anchored by long-term contracts to export U.S. LNG to Europe for decades to 
come. In 2022 alone, 17.65 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of new LNG (equivalent to 848 
billion cubic feet of gas, bcf) was contracted for sales to European gas companies. These contracts 
would continue for 15 to 20 years.
• In Europe, eight LNG import terminals are under construction and 38 more have been proposed. 
If built, these could more than double Europe’s LNG import capacity to 38 billion cubic feet per 
day (bcf/d) and result in an additional 950 million tons of CO2-eq emissions per year.2
• In the U.S., there are seven operating export terminals, three terminals under construction, 
twelve new and expanded terminals that are approved but awaiting financing, and numerous 
proposed projects that have not yet been approved. If built, the approved projects alone could 
more than double U.S. export capacity to 42 bcf/d – with annual lifecycle emissions equivalent to 
393 million cars.3 
• By 2030, U.S. LNG export by itself could be larger than the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) estimate by 
the IEA for global  LNG trade.4
• This LNG expansion threatens the health of communities living near these export terminals, and 
also those living near extraction sites and pipelines, which could see impacts from increased 
production. LNG contributes to fossil fuel racism, whereby Black, Brown, Indigenous, and poor 
communities are disproportionately harmed by pollution and climate impacts.
• While the energy crisis has led to record profits for oil and gas companies, families in the U.S. 
and Europe have struggled to make ends meet, and Global South nations suffered from high 
energy prices. 
• Policy makers in both Europe and the U.S. have the ability to halt this LNG buildout, break the 
carbon lock-in inherent to long-term LNG contracts, and put both regions on a pathway to a 
green and just future.

2 MEDIA BRIEFING: U .S . LIQUEFIED GAS FLOODING EUROPELNG Shock Therapy
The oil and gas industry has moved quickly to take ad -
vantage of the disruptions caused by Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine. In 2022, a surge of shipments of liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) from the United States was redi -
rected to Europe in order to replace Russian pipeline 
gas and secure supplies for the European winter. By 
taking advantage of this short-term energy crisis, the 
industry has also secured financing and begun con -
struction on numerous LNG terminals on both sides 
of the Atlantic that are designed to operate for de -
cades to come. 
This massive build out of unneeded new infrastruc -
ture is a costly mistake that will come too late for the 
current crisis, but will harm communities and put 
both U.S. and EU climate goals at risk. 
In classic “shock doctrine” style,5 the oil and gas 
industry wasted no time in pushing a rapid increase 
of U.S. LNG shipments as the solution to the crisis. 
In Europe, the industry quickly shifted their public 
messaging from “energy transition” to “energy securi -
ty.” In response to the crisis, the EU’s REPowerEU plan 
included around 10 billion euros in funding for gas 
infrastructure.6 
On March 25, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden an -
nounced plans to direct 15 billion cubic meters (bcm, 
equivalent to 530 bcf) of additional LNG shipments 
to Europe that year, with a goal to scale this up to 50 
bcm (1,770 bcf) annually by 2030.7 Simultaneously, 
the European Commission and the U.S. made a joint statement on European Energy Security in which Eu -
rope expressed its intention to accelerate its regulatory 
procedures to fast-track LNG import terminals, and to 
encourage long-term contracts to support the final in -
vestment decisions (FID) of U.S. LNG export terminals.8
As a result, U.S. LNG imports to Europe more than 
doubled, increasing from 1,029 bcf (29 bcm) in 2021 
to nearly 2,500 bcf (70 bcm) in 2022 (see Figure 1) – 
easily surpassing Biden’s initial goal.9 During this 2022 
LNG boom, no country imported as much U.S. LNG as 
France, accounting for nearly a quarter of all U.S. LNG 
imports, followed by the United Kingdom, Spain, and 
the Netherlands.
From Shock to Lock-In
Europe’s energy crisis is driven by the short-term need 
to get off Russian oil and gas. But in order to meet 
the climate goals laid out by the Paris Agreement, the 
world must rapidly begin to phase out all fossil fuels 
and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Ambitious 
climate pathways consistent with 1.5°C show that Eu -
rope must phase out its gas consumption by 203510 or 
2040,11 which would allow Europe to eliminate both 
Russian gas imports and all LNG imports before 203012 
(for an illustration, see Figure 2). The LNG industry 
plan is in direct conflict with these short decarbon -
ization timelines. The industry demands long-term 
(15-20 year) purchase contracts, and the construction 
of expensive terminals designed to generate revenues 
for decades to come.

 MEDIA BRIEFING: U .S . LIQUEFIED GAS FLOODING EUROPE  3In Europe, eight LNG import terminals are under 
construction and 38 more have been proposed. If built, 
these could more than double Europe’s LNG import 
capacity to 38 bcf/d (394 bcm/y) and result in an addi -
tional annual 950 million tons CO2-eq per year. Such 
a massive overcapacity would be enough to supply 
virtually all of the current annual EU gas demand. 
Despite this, existing European import terminals only 
utilized 63% of their regasification capacity in 2022, 
leaving as much as 2,700 bcf (77 bcm) unused. To put 
all this in perspective: the EU imported 5,400 bcf (153 
bcm) of gas in 2021 from Russia,13 and has already 
replaced nearly 75% of those imports primarily via 
existing infrastructure and reducing demand – with -
out the need for new LNG infrastructure or long term 
contracts.14 
The build out of import terminals in Europe has been 
mirrored by a similar build out of export terminals in 
the United States. Currently there are seven operating 
export terminals, three terminals under construction, 
twelve new and expanded terminals that are ap -
proved but awaiting financing, and numerous pro -
posed projects that have not yet been approved (see 
Figure 3 on following page). This proliferation of U.S. 
export terminals has been significantly financed by 
European banks, and made possible by the signing of long-term supply agreements with European purchas -
ers and portfolio traders. Long-term contracts are key 
factors in determining whether an expensive liquefac -
tion terminal can achieve its final investment decision 
(FID).15 A total of 17.65 mtpa (848 bcf) of new LNG was 
agreed for sales to European gas companies in 2022, 
or about as much as 65% of French gas consumption.16
The proposed and approved projects in the U.S. would 
collectively represent a massive increase in U.S. LNG 
export capacity. It is not certain that all of these proj -
ects will be built, but the approved projects awaiting 
financing alone could more than double U.S. export 
capacity to 42 bcf/d (439 bcm/y).17 The estimated time -
line for this additional LNG buildout shows that by 
2030, U.S. LNG by itself could be larger than the IEA’s 
net zero estimate for global  LNG trade.18
This buildout is irrelevant to Europe’s real short-term 
needs. As we have seen, the U.S. can temporarily in -
crease their LNG exports to Europe to cover the short-
term supply crunch, without the need for long term 
contracts or new infrastructure.19 And by definition, 
any LNG terminal coming online in 2026 or later is not 
intended to help weather the immediate crisis – but 
will certainly make the next crisis much worse.All Europe Gas Supply EU27 Gas SupplyBillion Cubic Meters (Bcm)

4 MEDIA BRIEFING: U .S . LIQUEFIED GAS FLOODING EUROPEBreaking the Climate
Investments in pipelines, terminal infrastructure and 
long-term contracts are all a form of “carbon lock-in”, 
where decisions made today make it harder polit -
ically, economically, and socially to decarbonize in 
the future. Limiting warming to 1.5°C means that the 
world cannot afford to develop any new coal, oil, or 
gas fields. 
LNG typically has higher lifecycle emissions than 
pipeline gas due to its energy intensive liquefaction 
process, shipping requirements, and methane leakage. 
This makes it a particularly inappropriate fuel for a 
carbon-limited world. Rystad Energy estimates that the 
surge of LNG imports will drive up European emis -
sions by 35 million tonnes.20
The IEA’s Net-Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario estimates 
that in a 1.5°C aligned pathway, LNG exports will peak 
in 2025, both globally (at 17,600 bcf or 497 bcm) and 
from North America specifically (at 4,240 bcf or 120 
bcm). Following that, North American LNG exports 
will decline almost to zero by 2045.21 However, the export capacity of the seven operating U.S. terminals 
(5,120 bcf or 145 bcm) is already larger than the peak 
in this scenario. By 2030, U.S. LNG by itself could be 
larger than the NZE estimate for the entire global LNG 
trade. Existing and proposed export terminals have 
also negotiated long-term contracts, the total volume 
of which is also far higher than the NZE estimates 
(see Figure 4).
Analysis by the Sierra Club found that the annual 
lifecycle emissions of the LNG passing through the 
seven operating U.S. export terminals is the equivalent 
to the emissions from 119 million cars. Adding the 
LNG from under construction and approved terminals 
would bring total annual emissions equivalent to 393 
million cars.22
The environmental and climate impact of these 
contracts have made them controversial with Euro -
pean citizens. In 2020, Engie initially backed out of a 
deal with Next Decade LNG over concerns about high 
methane emissions.23 To make these contracts more 
palatable to an increasingly climate-conscious pub -
lic, many companies have engaged in greenwashing TEXAS LOUISIANA ALABAMA MISSISSIPPI

 MEDIA BRIEFING: U .S . LIQUEFIED GAS FLOODING EUROPE  5schemes. For some contracts, European buyers are 
demanding a certification of the emissions from the 
purchased gas, either as assessed by a third party or 
by the terminal operator. However, significant ques -
tions about these gas certification schemes have been 
raised,24 25 and to date there is no regulation requiring 
standard methods or transparency.
It’s clear that the LNG buildout being foisted upon the 
U.S. and Europe is a long-term disaster rather than a 
short-term solution.
Footing the Bill
The energy crisis has been very profitable for oil 
and gas companies.26 The five supermajors (Exxon, 
Chevron, Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies) generated $102 
billion in profits in 2022 – roughly twice as much as 
2021.27 LNG exporter Cheniere also nearly doubled 
their revenues in 2022.28Families faced record high energy bills in 2022. Energy 
costs for Europeans increased by $1 trillion and gov -
ernments responded with around $700 billion in sub -
sidies and aid packages to offset those costs.29 In the 
2022-2023 winter 3 out of 4 Europeans have cut back 
on food and everyday items in order to pay the rising 
energy bills.30 A quarter of U.S. respondents polled in 
the summer of 2022 said they had forgone necessities 
like food or medicine to pay their energy bill.31
The high prices that Europe was willing to pay for 
LNG also resulted in a price competition where coun -
tries from the Global South were outbid in the race 
to secure their energy needs. Pakistan suffered from 
European suppliers breaching their contracts forcing 
gas rationing and emergency spot market purchases.32 
Other countries faced blackouts and some resorted to 
restarting coal plants.33Billion cubic meters per day (bcm/d)

6 MEDIA BRIEFING: U .S . LIQUEFIED GAS FLOODING EUROPEHarming Communities
Many of the European countries importing LNG know 
how harmful fracking is because they banned it. But 
they seem to have no issue with outsourcing that 
pollution to other countries. Interestingly, many of the 
banks helping to finance LNG terminals have at least 
some policy excluding fracking from their banking 
activities.34 
Each stage of the life cycles of oil, gas, and coal — ex -
traction, processing, transport, and combustion — 
generates toxic air and water pollution that is linked 
to negative health impacts for people living near 
these pollution sources. In the context of the U.S., 
these health impacts fall disproportionately on Black, 
Brown, Indigenous and poor communities.35
All the operating and under construction terminals 
in the U.S. except one are located near a “disadvan -
taged community” as determined by the White House 
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Notably, the 
Corpus Christi and Freeport terminals have a large 
population living within 3 miles of the site that are 
disproportionately low-income and people of color. A 
cluster of three terminals (Sabine Pass, Golden Pass, 
Port Arthur LNG) is located near Port Arthur, Tex -
as – a town of 50,000 (majority people of color) that is already home to three oil refineries, including the 
largest in the U.S. Other terminals have been proposed 
in regions that are disproportionately low-income 
communities of color – notably Rio Grande LNG, Texas 
LNG, and Plaquemines LNG. Terminals located in 
Southwest Louisiana are in a region that already faced 
elevated risks from air toxics.
In addition to pollution harms from LNG terminals 
themselves, the surge of LNG exports has sparked an 
increase in oil and gas extraction as well as transport 
and processing to meet the demand. A compendium 
of scientific and medical research on the impacts of 
fracking in the U.S. summarized its findings by saying, 
“Our examination uncovered no evidence that frack -
ing can be practiced in a manner that does not threat -
en human health directly and without imperiling 
climate stability upon which public health depends.”36 
A growing body of research has associated proximity 
to oil and gas activity with health problems such as 
respiratory impacts (e.g., asthma), cancer, poor birth 
outcomes, and more.37 Data from the EPA’s Air Toxics 
Screening Assessment shows that 236 counties with a 
total population of 14 million “face cancer risk exceed -
ing EPA’s one-in-a-million threshold level of concern, 
just due to oil and gas pollution.”38 
“Europeans shouldn’t think gas exported from my community is 
‘freedom gas’...you’re still being enslaved by this gas that causes 
so many problems and troubles… It’s not freedom gas because 
you’re really not free. It’s going to cost you. It’s going to cost you 
more and it’s going to cost you in the long run. Because the more 
you use it, the more peril it places on your life and health,  
and the life and health of people across this entire planet.  
Climate change is real. We see it here every day.” 
– John Beard , Port Arthur Community Action Network 39 

 MEDIA BRIEFING: U .S . LIQUEFIED GAS FLOODING EUROPE  7Recommendations
The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) marks 
a turning point in U.S. Climate Policy. For the first time, 
Congress has acted to curb demand for fossil fuels, but 
has left fossil supply unconstrained. As a result, the 
U.S. finds itself in a trap where declining domestic de -
mand coupled with high production could fuel a surge 
of exports. These exports are a form of “carbon leak -
age” and if left unconstrained could erode the emis -
sions reductions in the IRA.40 What’s more, continued 
domestic production is a threat to the health of com -
munities all along the fossil fuel supply chain. A more 
robust climate policy would pair demand-side reduc -
tions with policies to phase out fossil fuel production. 
Long-term gas supply contracts will lock-in both the 
U.S. and EU into decades of emissions at the expense 
of our climate and the health and safety of commu -
nities. LNG companies right now are signing export 
agreements that risk locking the US into decades more 
drilling, infrastructure buildout, and exporting. On 
the buyer side, these contracts lock import countries 
into decades more fossil gas consumption and de -
layed renewable energy investment. Leaders from 
these nations have the climate and moral imperative 
to cut off the gas industry’s decades-long hold on our 
energy future.
U.S. policy makers must take the following steps to 
align LNG exports with strong climate goals:
• Reject federal permits for any new infrastruc -
ture  projects that would increase GHG emissions 
or worsen the climate crisis. This requires that 
any new pipelines or new LNG export terminals 
be rejected.
• Reject federal approval for any LNG export ship -
ments from existing or approved terminals  
that are inconsistent with 1.5°C pathways, worsen 
domestic energy poverty, or pose health threats to 
nearby communities.
 –The Department of Energy (DOE) has the au -
thority to overhaul its “public interest” determi -
nation (which governs LNG exports to non-free 
trade agreement countries) to explicitly consid -
er climate change, environmental justice and 
energy justice. –DOE should hold hearings and take the nec -
essary steps to document that the cumulative 
lifecycle emissions associated with LNG exports 
are inconsistent with our climate goals and 
contrary to the public interest. Where needed, 
DOE should revoke approvals or set time limits 
for exports from existing terminals.
• DOE should make public the long term contracts 
signed between LNG sellers and buyers. 
• President Biden must wield his global leader -
ship and support ending international public 
finance for fossil fuels, including LNG, at the G7, 
G20 and COP28.
Both Biden and Congress must take further steps to 
protect the climate and communities living on the 
fence lines of the fossil fuel supply chain. Such poli -
cies include:
• Establish a national plan and targets to wind down 
existing fossil fuel production and infrastructure.
• Eliminate federal fossil fuel subsidies.
• Ban new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on pub -
lic lands and waters, and phase out existing leases.
• Phase out exports of crude oil and reject federal 
permits for any new crude oil export terminals.
• Enact regulations to eliminate methane emissions 
and flaring from oil and gas facilities. 
• Require air and water pollution reductions in pol -
luted communities by implementing a comprehen -
sive “No Pollution Hotspots” policy.
• Pass the Environmental Justice for All Act to 
provide legal remedies to citizens, improve eq -
uity mapping tools, expand grant programs, 
and strengthen consultation with impacted 
communities.
• Build on the renewable energy incentives in the 
IRA to enact a Green New Deal that will direct 
trillions of dollars in public investments to create 
millions of green union jobs, rectify past injus -
tices, and ensure that energy-dependent work -
ers and communities are left better off through 
the transition.

8 MEDIA BRIEFING: U .S . LIQUEFIED GAS FLOODING EUROPEPhasing out fossil fuel exports from the U.S. must be 
paired with strong demand-side policies to end fossil 
fuel use in Europe and other importing markets. Stop -
ping the expansion of gas requires strong policies both 
to reduce harms where drilling occurs and all along 
the supply chain to decrease the demand for gas and 
incentivize the rapid buildout of renewables. 
CHANGE THE SYSTEM
1. Remove fossil fuels from politics, by: ending their 
access to decision-making; ending conflicts of inter -
est; excluding fossil fuel industry representatives 
from climate negotiations; rejecting partnerships 
with the fossil fuel industry.
2. Revoke the privileged role of gas lobby group ENT -
SOG in EU decision-making processes.
3. Ensure full transparency on all available data on 
gas flowing into, through, and out of the EU.
4. Further strengthen, adopt and enforce due dili -
gence legislation at European and nationals levels.
PHASE OUT GAS
1. Set mandatory gas reduction targets at EU and 
national levels,
2. Set targets for climate neutrality by 2040 in the EU 
and the US,
3. Pursue an active fossil gas phase-out by 2035. Due 
to its higher carbon intensity and risk of methane 
leaks, imports of LNG should be phased out first.
4. Cancel all projects for the construction of new LNG 
import terminals and expansion of existing termi -
nals
5. Halt new long-term contracts for the delivery of 
LNG, and ban extension of existing contracts.
6. Properly account for the higher lifecycle emissions 
of LNG compared to pipelined gas.
7. Critically assess hydrogen projections and projects 
pushed by the fossil fuel industry.REDUCE CONSUMPTION, BOOST 
EFFICIENCY AND EXPAND 
RENEWABLE ENERGY
Policies and measures are needed to support urgent 
measures that provide the services required from 
energy but do not rely on fossil gas through rapid 
expansion of systems and mechanisms that reduce 
consumption, expand efficiency and renewable en -
ergy sources.
Energy Saving and Conservation  measures to re -
duce demand: 
Efficiency (incl. insulation)  - in Building and Indus -
try: Renewable heating (like heat pumps); Building 
renovation heater efficiency in buildings; efficiency in 
industrial processes.
1. Financial support schemes for vulnerable people to 
meet their basic energy needs
2. Ban disconnections e.g. energy providers should 
not have the right to cut off customers who fail to 
pay their bills, in particular vulnerable ones
3. Drive deep building renovations and sufficiency 
that can realize the potential to permanently cut 
demand by improving the energy performance of 
buildings.
Power production  – Maximize measures for renew- 
able power sources at all public, commercial, and 
industrial sites and operations. E.g. solar panels on 
rooftops, install heat pumps and undertake renova- 
tion measures.
Industry  – where possible be fully electrical and more 
circular, while always prioritizing energy saving
Tax fossil fuel profits : to help meet the investment 
needs of the energy transition, ensuring the burden 
does not fall on citizens and the rest of the economy.
