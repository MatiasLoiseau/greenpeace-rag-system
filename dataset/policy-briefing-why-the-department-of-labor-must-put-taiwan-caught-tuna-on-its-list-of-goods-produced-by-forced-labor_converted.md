Greenpeace Briefing on Taiwan for the US Department of Labor 2020
List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor

Introduction

Last  December,  Greenpeace  and  23  additional  NGOs,  trade  unions,  and  businesses  sent  a
letter to the US Department of Labor, Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) Office of Child
Labor,  Forced  Labor,  and  Human  Trafficking  calling  on  it  to  change  its  practice  of  excluding
distant water fishing (DWF) nations that use forced labor to catch seafood on the high seas from
its  biennial  List  of  Goods  Produced  by  Child  Labor  or  Forced  Labor  (TVPRA  List),  declare  an
official policy of attributing high seas catch to the flag State, and remove all seafood exemptions
in its upcoming 2020 report.1

This briefing supplements that letter by providing more information on forced labor in Taiwan’s
distant  water  fishing  industry  and  demonstrating  each  of  the  criteria  for  listing  Taiwan-caught
tuna in the 2020 TVPRA List are fulfilled. The abuses on Taiwanese vessels will not stop until
the US, as one of the largest markets in the world for imported seafood, uses the full range of
tools  at  its  disposal,  including  the  TVPRA  List,  to  push  the  Taiwanese  government  to  make
changes to its laws, policies, and practices. To this end, Greenpeace calls on ILAB to adopt a
more flexible approach in its assessment of the prevalence of forced labor in DWF entities such
as  Taiwan.  ILAB  has  confirmed  it  maintains  a  lower  threshold  for  listing  when  considering
countries such as North Korea and China where information on the prevalence of forced labor is
difficult to obtain due to government restrictions on data collection or suppression of information
dissemination.2  Labor  conditions  on  Taiwanese  DWF  vessels  are  similarly  difficult  to  ascertain
due to the government’s decision to effectively limit dissemination of information on forced labor
by  not  conducting  port  State  labor  inspections,  allowing  its  vessels  to  operate  at  sea  for  an
unlimited period of time without returning to shore, and restricting migrant fishers’ ability to enter
Taiwan and thus denying them access to support services. As such, a lower threshold for listing
should also apply to DWF entities such as Taiwan that restrict the dissemination of information
on forced labor through a combination of laws, policies, and practices designed to obscure the
true extent of forced labor in its DWF industry.

re: ILAB’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor and seafood exemptions; US
Department of Labor. 2018 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor. P. 69.
https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/ListofGoods.pdf (in the section, “Countries with Data Gaps on
TVPRA List”, ILAB notes, “Where ILAB was able to find even limited sources, despite data availability
constraints, indicating significant incidence of forced labor or child labor in the production of a particular
good, and these sources were judged credible and timely, ILAB determined that there was “reason to
believe” that child labor or forced labor was occurring with respect to that good.”)

The  information  provided  in  this  briefing  shows  that  forced  labor  in  Taiwan’s  DWF  industry  is
absolutely  not  an  isolated  practice.  Research  and  investigations  by  numerous  organizations
highlight  the  same  patterns  of  abuse  and  repeatedly  show  the  Taiwanese  government’s
unwillingness  to  address  the  root  causes  of  forced  labor  in  its  DWF  industry.  The  time  for
Taiwan to be held accountable for forced labor is long past due, but the 2020 TVPRA List can
be the catalyst for much needed reform and help secure respect for our oceans and the fishers
who work in them.

Section I. Forced Labor in Taiwan’s Distant Water Fishery

Seafood is one the most traded food commodities in the world with an estimated annual value of
USD 153 billion.3 Around USD 42 billion of that is from tuna.4 Taiwan plays a pivotal role in the
global  tuna  trade  as  the  second  largest  fishing  entity  on  the  high  seas,5  with  over  1,000
Taiwanese-flagged  and  close  to  300  Taiwanese-owned,  foreign-flagged  DWF  vessels  that
target  tuna,6  and  the  largest  longline  tuna  trader  in  the  world.7  It  also  employs  over  22,000
migrant fishers in its DWF fleet.8 According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
approximately 36% of the world’s tuna longliner fleet is Taiwanese-flagged, the most of any flag
State.9 Taiwan catches tuna and other high value fish in all of the major oceans of the world,10

and  its  fleet  operates  in  the  EEZs  of  more  than  30  countries.11  Seafood  export  values  are
estimated to be around USD 2 billion, with primary markets in Japan, China, Thailand, and the
United States.12 The United States imports over 80% of its seafood and a significant amount is
tuna  caught  by  Taiwanese-flagged  vessels.13  While  Taiwan  has  profited  from  its  large  DWF
fleet,  the  same  cannot  be  said  for  the  migrant  fishers  who  toil  in  horrific  and  inhumane
conditions on Taiwanese-flagged or owned vessels in all corners of our oceans. The European
Union’s  (EU)  decision  in  2015  to  issue  a  yellow  card  to  Taiwan,  and  the  US  Customs  and
Border  Protection’s  (CBP)  issuance  of  a  withhold  release  order  in  2019  on  tuna  harvested  by
the Taiwanese-owned, Vanuatu-flagged fishing vessel Tunago 61, exemplify Taiwan’s failure to
manage  both  the  DWF  vessels  flying  its  flag  as  well  as  Taiwanese  who  use  flags  of
convenience  (FOCs)  to  circumvent  Taiwan’s  laws.14  This  insufficient  management,  along  with
transshipment at sea and the overseas employment scheme (also referred to as the “two-tiered
system”),15 render migrant fishers working in Taiwanese DWF fleets all the more vulnerable to
forced labor.

The  following  eight  cases  of  suspected  forced  labor  on  Taiwanese-flagged,  owned  or  linked
DWF  vessels  are  drawn  from  the  Greenpeace  Southeast  Asia  Seabound  report  and  the
Greenpeace  East  Asia  Choppy  Waters  report.  They  collectively  demonstrate  forced  labor
continues to be endemic in the Taiwanese DWF industry due to persistent issues such as debt
bondage,  withholding  of  wages,  excessive  overtime,  discrimination  against  migrant  fishers,
irregular  and  ineffective  labor  inspections,  and  complete  lack  of  oversight  by  the  competent
authority on labor matters. The names of the migrant fishers are withheld to protect their safety.

Case 1. Chin Chun 12

According to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), Chin Chun 12 is
a Taiwanese-owned, Vanuatu-flagged vessel. From 2017 to 2019, an Indonesian migrant fisher
coded as Mr. C worked on Chin Chun 12. In May 2019, Mr. C reported to Serikat Buruh Migran
Indonesia  (SBMI,  or  Indonesian  Migrant  Workers  Union)  that  he  was  not  paid  on  board  every
three  months  as  required  in  his  contract,  nor  was  the  remittance  sent  back  to  his  family  in

Indonesia. Mr. C also said that it was not until he returned home that he realized that he was not
paid at all for his two years working on the Taiwanese-owned vessel.

ILO forced labor indicators: deception, and withholding of wages.

Case 2. Da Wang

According to WCPFC, Da Wang is a Taiwanese-owned, Vanuatu-flagged vessel. An Indonesian
migrant fisher coded as Mr. D worked on this vessel from 2019. In July, 2019, Mr. D reported to
SBMI  that  he  signed  a  two-year  contract  but  the  work  was  terminated  prematurely  after  the
death of another migrant fisher. Mr. D reported witnessing another migrant fisher get hit on his
head near the left ear by the captain, and that this migrant fisher was forced to continue to work
until the work was done. The next day, this migrant fisher was found dead in his bed. After this
incident,  Mr.  D  said  that  all  other  19  migrant  fishers  were  asked  to  sign  an  unknown  paper,
which he said he later understood to be voluntary repatriation. Mr. D also claimed to be subject
to frequent physical abuse from the captain, and worked approximately 22 hours per day.

ILO  forced  labor  indicators:  abuse  of  vulnerability,  deception,  physical  and  sexual
violence,  withholding  of  wages,  abusive  working  and  living  conditions,  and  excessive
overtime.

Case 3. Fwu Maan 88

According to WCPFC, Fwu Maan 88 is a Taiwanese-flagged vessel. Three Indonesian migrant
fishers signed contracts to work on the vessel starting in 2018. In January 2019, they reported
to SBMI that they were asked by the captain to sign a voluntary repatriation statement, and thus
their  contracts  were  terminated  prematurely.  According  to  the  migrant  fishers,  they  were  often
subjected to physical and verbal abuse from the captain, and their passports were retained by
the  captain.  These  three  migrant  fishers  also  reported  to  the  Indonesia  Embassy  in  Port
Moresby  about  the  mistreatment  they  received  from  the  captain,  which  led  to  conflict  between
them and the captain.

ILO  forced  labor  indicators:  abuse  of  vulnerability,  physical  and  sexual  violence,  and
retention of identity documents.

Case 4. Lien Yi Hsing 12

According to WCPFC, Lien Yi Hsing 12 is a Taiwanese-flagged vessel. Two Indonesian migrant
fishers  coded  as  Mr.  N  and  Mr.  K  signed  two-year  contracts  to  work  on  the  vessel  starting  in
2018. They reported to SBMI on an unknown date that they worked on the vessel for 10 months
but were both only paid a month’s salary. Mr. N reported that his contract specified his salary as
USD 500 per month, but after working 10 months on the vessel, he only received USD 500 in
total. As for Mr. K, he said that his contract specified his salary as USD 450 per month, but after

4

working  10  months  on  the  vessel,  he  only  received  USD  450  in  total.  The  vessel  owner  told
them that the rest of their salary had been sent to their Taiwanese manning agencies; however,
when they contacted their agencies, no responses were given.

ILO forced labor indicators: deception, and withholding of wages.

Case 5. Shin Jaan Shin

According  to  WCPFC,  Shin  Jaan  Shin  is  a  Taiwanese-flagged  vessel.  An  Indonesian  migrant
fisher coded as Mr. A worked on the vessel during an unknown period of time. He reported to
SBMI in January 2019 that he was not paid as much as required in his contract, and that he was
given a falsified seaman book.

ILO forced labor indicator: deception.

Case 6. Wei Ching

According to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), Wei
Ching is a Taiwanese-flagged vessel. An Indonesian migrant fisher coded as Mr. S working on
the vessel told Greenpeace East Asia that he worked on average 18 hours per day without any
days  off.  Mr.  S  also  claimed  that  the  drinking  water  and  food  were  unbearable.  The  migrant
fisher said that sometimes the crew had to boil water from the air conditioner to drink. He also
reported that the food was sometimes a mixture of pork and other meat, which was against the
Islamic  practice  of  some  crew  members.  Mr.  S  also  complained  that  the  sleeping  space  was
only  0.5  meter  in  width.  In  addition  to  this  abusive  environment,  Mr.  S  reported  that  USD  800
was deducted from his salary. He also reported that his passport was retained by the captain,
and that he didn’t get a copy of his contract.

ILO forced labor indicators：abuse of vulnerability, retention of identity documents,  debt
bondage, abusive working and living conditions, and excessive overtime.

Case 7. Vessel A

According to ICCAT, Vessel A is a Taiwanese-flagged vessel. Two Indonesian migrant fishers,
coded as Mr. M and Mr. E, told Greenpeace East Asia investigators that they worked around 17
to  18  hours  per  day.  They  claimed  that  when  it  got  busy,  they  worked  over  34  hours  straight.
They  also  complained  that  deposits  were  deducted  from  their  salary.  According  to  Mr.  M,  a
deposit of USD 900 and a recruitment fee of USD 20 was deducted from his salary. According
to Mr. E, a deposit of USD 800 was deducted from his salary. Mr. M also told Greenpeace that
he felt cheated because after he had submitted all the necessary documents, he waited for six
months  before  he  got  the  job  which  was  contrary  to  the  immediate  departure  promised  by  the
manning agency. They both reported that their passports were retained by the captain.

ILO  forced  labor  indicators： abuse  of  vulnerability,  deception,  retention  of  identity
documents, withholding of wages, debt bondage, and excessive overtime.

Case 8. Vessel B

According  to  ICCAT,  Vessel  B  is  a  Japanese-flagged  vessel.  However,  the  contract  of  the
migrant  fisher  Greenpeace  interviewed  (coded  as  Mr.  J)  showed  the  company  is  based  in
Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and that the representative of the vessel owner is a manning agency listed
on the Taiwanese Register of Companies. Therefore, Greenpeace suspects the vessel to be a
FOC owned by a Taiwanese citizen. Mr. J's contract states, "Any disputes that occurred during
the contract period must be reported to the vessel owner or the captain. Disputes should only be
reported  to  the  manning  agency  in  Indonesia  or  the  Taiwanese  fishery  company  when  they
cannot  be  resolved  by  the  owner  or  the  captain.  If  the  fisher  reports  the  issue  to  any  other
authority,  the  vessel  owner  is  no  longer  responsible  for  the  fisher’s  safety  and  that  the  vessel
owner  bears  no  more  responsibility  to  send  the  fisher  to  his  country  of  origin.”  The  contract
further  states,  “During  the  contract  period,  the  captain  reserves  the  right  to  transfer  the  crew
member to other vessels without the fisher’s consent.” The contract also prohibited the migrant
fisher  from  terminating  his  employment  on  the  basis  of  excessive  workload  or  working  hours,
lack of awareness about the nature of the work required of him, or having an ill family member,
all  of  which  rendered  the  contract  overly  binding.  Mr.  J  reported  working  on  average  16  hours
per  day  with  around  6  hours  for  sleep.  Mr.  J  also  said  that  he  was  charged  a  deposit  and
recruitment fee. He also claimed that his passport was confiscated by the captain.

ILO  forced  labor  indicators： intimidation  and  threats,  retention  of  identity  documents,
withholding of wages, debt bondage, and excessive overtime.

Section II. Nature of information

Seven  of  the  eight  cases  presented  in  this  briefing  meet  the  international  definition  of  forced
labor as established in art. 2 of the ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (C29). The facts in the
eighth  case  indicate  there  was  certainly  a  risk  of  forced  labor,  but  there  was  insufficient
information to conclude that there was actual forced labor. The determination of forced labor in
the seven cases was based on the presence of a combination of ILO forced labor indicators that
satisfied  both  the  involuntariness  and  coercion  (menace  of  penalty)  elements  of  the  ILO
definition  of  forced  labor.  The  third  element  -  work  -  was  satisfied  by  the  migrant  fishers’  jobs
onboard  their  vessels.  This  methodology  is  the  same  used  by  ILAB  to  determine  whether
information  about  forced  labor  gathered  from  research  or  other  sources  meets  the  definition
established in ILO C29.

Of  the  eight  vessels  discussed  above,  five  are  Taiwanese-flagged,  two  are  Taiwanese-owned
but foreign-flagged, or FOCs, and one Taiwanese-linked. The presence of forced labor or risk of
forced  labor  on  five  Taiwanese-flagged  vessels  owned  by  five  different  fishing  companies

6

provides  further  proof  that  forced  labor  in  the  Taiwanese  DWF  industry  is  not  an  isolated
practice restricted to only one or a few bad actors. Forced labor is endemic to the industry and
remains persistent and undiminished due to systemic failures of the Taiwanese government.

The two Taiwanese-owned, FOC vessels are mentioned in this briefing to shine a spotlight on
countries  such  as  Vanuatu  that  should  also  be  held  responsible  for  failing  to  prevent  forced
labor from occurring on vessels under its authority. While flag States such as Vanuatu should be
held  responsible  by  ILAB  in  its  TVPRA  List,  Greenpeace  also  recommends  ILAB  engage  with
the  Taiwanese  government  separately  to  address  the  issue  of  Taiwanese  who  use  FOCs  to
circumvent  Taiwanese  laws  and  evade  accountability  for  gross  human  rights  violations.
Ultimately, both Vanuatu and Taiwan must be held accountable for failing to end the exploitation
of workers by individuals and companies under their authority.

Section III. Date of information

All  the  information  provided  in  this  briefing  is  no  more  than  five  years  old  at  the  time  of
submission to ILAB.

Section IV. Source of information

Five of the Greenpeace cases in this briefing (Chin Chun 12, Da Wang, Fwu Maan 88, Lien Yi
Hsing  12,  and  Shin  Jaan  Shin)  are  based  on  research  and  investigations  conducted  by
Greenpeace Southeast Asia and SBMI.

SBMI was founded in 2003 and is operated by former, present, or aspiring Indonesian migrant
workers  and  their  families.  It  has  a  long  track  record  of  collaborating  with  international  NGOs
such  as  Greenpeace  and  Environmental  Justice  Foundation  (EJF),  and  it  has  a  stellar
reputation  for  its  investigations  on  forced  labor  in  the  East  Asian  distant  water  fishing  industry
and its representation of Indonesian migrant fisher returnees who are survivors of forced labor
and  human  trafficking.  SBMI  has  assisted  numerous  Indonesian  migrant  fishers  working  on
Taiwanese  DWF  vessels  and  it  has  extensive  knowledge  of  forced  labor  and  other  forms  of
labor exploitation in the industry.

Greenpeace Southeast Asia has produced three reports documenting forced labor and human
trafficking  in  Asian  fisheries  -  Supply  Chained  (2015),  Turn  the  Tide  (2016),  and  Seabound
(2019).  The  Seabound  report  was  produced  with  the  support  of  Greenpeace  USA  Senior
Oceans Adviser Andy Shen who has over eight years of experience on forced labor and human
trafficking  in  Asian  fisheries  and  previously  worked  for  the  International  Labour  Organization
(ILO)  and  the  International  Labor  Rights  Forum  as  a  specialist  on  human  and  labor  rights  in
fisheries.

For the Seabound report, SBMI interviewed the victims, inputted the case information in SBMI’s
case submission form, and then developed legal cases based on the information. SBMI’s case

7

submission  form  includes  questions  on  the  contract,  recruitment  agency,  working  conditions,
and the fisher’s general observation on the vessel. See Appendix I for the full questionnaire.

The  three  other  Greenpeace  cases  in  this  briefing  (Wei  Ching,  Vessel  A,  and  Vessel  B)  are
based on research and investigations conducted by Greenpeace East Asia in one of the most
frequented foreign ports by Taiwanese DWF fleets. See Appendix II for Greenpeace East Asia’s
questionnaire.

Greenpeace  East  Asia  has  produced  three  reports  documenting  forced  labor  and  human
trafficking in the Taiwanese DWF industry - Made in Taiwan (2016), Misery at Sea (2018), and
Choppy  Waters  (2020).  Choppy  Waters  was  produced  with  the  support  of  Greenpeace  USA
Senior Oceans Adviser Andy Shen.

Greenpeace  reports  on  forced  labor  in  fisheries  have  been  cited  or  referenced  by  the  US
Department  of  State,  US  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  the  European  Union,  reputable
NGOs, and other stakeholders.

Section V. Extent of Corroboration

The information provided by Greenpeace in this briefing is corroborated by numerous sources,
including  other  NGOs,  the  US  Department  of  State’s  past  TIP  Reports  and  Human  Rights
Reports, and Taiwanese and Indonesian media reports.

Greenpeace  and  EJF’s  findings  on  the  most  common  forced  labor  indicators,  and  the  root
causes  of  forced  labor,  in  the  Taiwanese  DWF  fleet  are  consistent  and  demonstrate  a  well-
established  pattern  of  exploitation  where  vulnerable  migrant  workers  are  deceived,  bound  by
debt and other coercive measures, and subjected to extreme working hours, violence, and other
inhumane  treatment  with  no  possibility  of  escape.  The  stories  of  “hell  on  earth”  are  all  similar
and leave no doubt as to whether these workers are victims of forced labor.

The US government has known about the forced labor and human trafficking in Taiwan’s DWF
fleet for many years as evidenced by the commentary in the Department of State’s annual TIP
Report  and  Human  Rights  Report  on  Taiwan.  Indeed,  human  rights  abuse  in  the  Taiwanese
DWF  fleet  has  been  identified  in  past  TIP  reports  as  a  priority  issue  for  the  Taiwanese
government to handle.

The  sources  and
determination that forced labor in Taiwan’s tuna industry is endemic.

information  below  provide  extensive  corroboration  of  Greenpeace’s

US Department of State

2014-2019 TIP Reports

8

The  US  TIP  reports  from  2014  to  2019  all  continuously  pointed  out  that  migrant  fishers  on
Taiwan’s DWF vessels are largely underpaid, subject to poor working and living conditions, and
endure  physical  and  verbal  abuse.  In  the  2019  TIP  report  on  Taiwan,  the  State  Department
recognized  that  the  separation  of  purview  between  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  the  Fisheries
Agency  (FA),  coupled  with  insufficient  inspection  protocols,  continued  to  impede  efforts  to
address  forced  labor  on  Taiwanese-flagged  or  owned  fishing  vessels,  particularly  in  the  highly
vulnerable DWF fleets.

2014-2019 Human Rights Reports

Like  the  US  TIP  reports,  the  US  Human  Rights  reports  from  2014  to  2019  also  identified
systemic  issues  and  a  pattern  of  human  rights  violations  in  Taiwanese  DWF  fleets.  The  2016
Taiwan  report  cited  the  work  of  Greenpeace  and  detailed  the  excessively  long  working  hours
and  poor  living  and  working  conditions  of  migrant  fishers  on  Taiwanese  vessels.  In  the  2019
report  on  Taiwan,  the  State  Department  also  pointed  out  that  the  two-tiered  system  subjects
migrant  fishers  recruited  overseas  to  lesser  labor  rights,  wages,  insurance,  and  pensions  than
those recruited locally.

2018: Abuse and Illegal Fishing Aboard Taiwanese Vessel Let Slip Through the Net16

In May 2018, the Taiwanese-flagged vessel Fuh Sheng 11 became the very first vessel in the
world to be detained for violating ILO Working in Fishing Convention (C188). According to the
South  African  officials,  there  was  a  lack  of  work  agreements  and  crew  list,  rotten  lifebuoys,
missing anchors and generally bad health and safety conditions. When the vessel was detained,
a Taiwan FA officer, posted in Cape Town, visited the vessel and distributed questionnaires to
crew  members  in  the  presence  of  the  captain,  without  disclosing  his  identity  as  a  Taiwanese
official, and without any interpreter despite the fact that some crew members were not able to
understand  the  questionnaires.  The  Taiwanese  FA  later  issued  a  statement  saying  that  Fuh
Sheng 11 only needed a few repairs, and claimed that the vessel was not detained and that it
did  not  violate  C188.  The  vessel  was  thus  released  from  Cape  Town.  Amidst  the  growing
international attention, Fuh Sheng 11 repatriated most of its foreign crew members.

EJF traced the crew members back to their hometowns and interviewed them, and documented
the egregious human rights abuses and severe illegal fishing offences on Fuh Sheng 11. Crew
members reported constant beatings from the captain and 22-hour work days on average. “We
sometimes slept only three hours and it was slavery. There were many cockroaches in the food
[...]  and  insects  in  the  bedroom,”  according  to  one  crew  member.  Another  crew  member
reported, “We don’t dare [do anything] because Indonesian crew are only laborers, not people

photographic  evidence  of  shark  finning.  It  was  not  until  EJF’s  documentary  attracted  great
international attention that the Taiwanese FA finally admitted five months later that there were
human rights abuses and IUU fishing on the vessel.17

2018: Illegal Fishing and Human Rights Abuses in the Taiwanese Fishing Fleet18

In  2018,  EJF  conducted  interviews  with  crew  members  from  three  Taiwanese-flagged,  one
Taiwanese-owned,  and  one  Taiwanese-linked  vessel,  and  found  cases  of  alleged  IUU  fishing
and  human  rights  abuses.  The  crew  members  reported  unsanitary  living  conditions,  and
constant verbal and physical abuse. Some mentioned that they only had three to four hours of
sleep per day while some reported that they would sometimes be forced to endure several days
without adequate food. Deductions of salary and withholding of food were used as a means to
coerce  crew  members  as  well.  Apart  from  human  rights  abuse,  some  crew  members  also
reported  dolphin  killing,  shark  finning  and  killing  fish  that  vessels  were  forbidden  to  catch  by
Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs).

Human Rights at Sea19

2019: Baseline Study: On the Awareness and Application of Human Rights in Taiwan’s
Fishery Industry 20

In October 2019, Human Rights at Sea published a 20-page Baseline Study reporting on how
migrant  fishers  were  forced  into  working  overtime  on  Taiwnanese  commercial  vessels  in
unsanitary environments, and faced verbal and physical abuse and illegal deduction of wages.
Human  Rights  at  Sea  conducted  field  research  in  Taiwan  and  interviewed  several  migrant
fishers  in  August  2019.  In  the  report,  Human  Rights  at  Sea  noted  that  working  overtime  and
physical abuse have been normalized on Taiwanese vessels. The rest hours for migrant fishers
was  around  four  to  six  hours,  and  broken  down  into  short  periods  on  an  irregular  basis.
Constant  lack  of  sleep  makes  the  vessel  operations  hazardous,  and  injuries  with  machine
operations,  knife  work  and  rope  work  are  common.  Despite  this,  migrant  fishers  reported  that
they  were  not  allowed  to  rest  and  sometimes  the  wounds  would  deteriorate  due  to  unhealthy
food, an unsanitary environment and lack of medical care. Among all the accusations, the one

dominant  complaint  among  the  interviewed  migrant  fishers  was  illegal  deduction  of  wages,
which  often  comes  from  service  fees  or  debt  from  recruitment  fees.  Two  migrant  fishers  said
that they were promised 300 USD per month, but they only received 50 USD per month. "(This
is) Hell on earth”, a migrant fisher murmured during the interview.

Greenpeace

2018: Misery at Sea: Human Suffering in Taiwan’s Distant Water Fishing Fleets21

In 2018, Greenpeace East Asia conducted follow-up research on the case of Giant Ocean, and
further research on two cases: first, the death of the Indonesian migrant fisher Supriyanto, and
second, the Tunago 61 incident where several Indonesian migrant fishers murdered the captain
of the Taiwanese-owned, Vanuatu-flagged vessel and were imprisoned in Vanuatu in 2016.

In  the  report,  Greenpeace  East  Asia  tracked  down  five  Taiwanese  that  were  convicted  by  the
Cambodian government in absentia but didn’t serve their sentence because their whereabouts
remained unknown. Greenpeace East Asia found that these five Taiwanese  were living openly
in  Taiwan  as  fugitives  from  Cambodian  justice.  On  top  of  this,  two  of  them  had  officially
sanctioned  roles  working  in  the  recruitment  of  migrant  crew  onto  Taiwanese  vessels,  and  two
others appeared to be involved in recruiting migrant crew for fishing vessels in Taiwan.

In  the  second  case,  Greenpeace  East  Asia  reviewed  the  case  of  Suripyanto,  an  Indonesian
migrant fisher who died on the Taiwanese-flagged vessel Fu Tsz Chiun in 2015. A post-mortem
examination  indicated  that  Suriyanto  had  died  from  septic  shock  from  an  infection  he  suffered
following a knee injury. The FA investigation failed to establish a clear version of events, and to
properly  explain  how  a  healthy,  relatively  young  man,  died  at  sea.  It  was  not  until  the  family
members of Supriyanto and the Yilan Migrant Fishermen’s Union (YMFU, the first and the only
migrant  fisher  union  in  Taiwan)  raised  serious  concerns  about  the  quality  of  the  investigation
that  the  Control  Yuan,  an  independent  government  unit  overseeing  all  executive  branches,
issued a correction on the FA’s investigation.

In the third case, Greenpeace East Asia flew to Vanuatu to interview the six Indonesian migrant
fishers who were serving their sentence for murdering the captain of Tunago 61. The interviews
painted a picture of cruel working and living conditions on the vessels. The migrant fishers also
reported that they were subject to multiple assaults with sticks, severe sleep deprivation, regular
verbal  abuse,  inadequate  and  inappropriate  food,  including  being  forced  to  eat  pork  (against
their Muslim faith), excessive overtime (on average 20-hour work days), and a threat to kill one
of them the night before the captain was killed. See Appendix III for the full questionnaire.

The  2016  Greenpeace  East  Asia  report,  Made  in  Taiwan:  Government  Failure  and  Illegal,
Abusive, and Criminal Fisheries, was based on a 12 month investigation from 2014 to 2015, and
the interviews of more than 100 migrant fishers throughout the major ports in Taiwan. Interviews
were also conducted with migrant fishers working on Taiwanese-flagged DWF vessels in Suva,
Fiji.  Three  case  studies  were  described  and  analyzed  in  the  report,  including  IUU  fishing  by  a
Taiwanese-flagged  vessel  Shuen  De  Ching  No.  888,  the  case  of  "Giant  Ocean",  and  the
notorious  murder  at  sea  in  the  Indian  Ocean  where  UN  agences  also  made  their  own
investigation.  Greenpeace  East  Asia  painted  a  vivid  picture  of  Taiwan’s  DWF  vessels,  where
IUU fishing is rampant, and the lives of migrant fishers are cheap. During the interviews, migrant
fishers complained that violence was common, ranging from being slapped to being bashed with
weapons or even being shot. In addition to physical abuse, one of the most common issues was
the deduction of salary for food and various claimed services. Many of the migrant fishers in the
DWF fleet reported that they worked 17 to 22 hours per day (often around 20 hours per day),
seven days a week, for months on end, and that the typical rate of pay was USD 300 per month,
which meant they only earned USD 0.5 per hour. Worse still, one of the fishers who was forced
to pay labor brokers through deduction of his salary reported that he was paid only USD 100 per
month, or USD 0.15 per hour. See Appendix III for the questionnaire.

Three  cases  were  analyzed  in  the  report,  highlighting  the  core  problems  in  Taiwan’s  distant
water  fishery:  IUU  fishing  and  forced  labor.  The  first  case  was  a  Taiwanese-flagged  vessel
Shuen  De  Ching  No.  888,  on  which  Greenpeace  boarded  under  the  consent  of  the  captain.
Shark  finning  and  illegal  fishing  were  found.  Crew  members  who  were  interviewed  also  told
Greenpeace that the vessel had transshipped at sea at least twice, and on several occasions,
the  captain  had  switched  off  the  monitoring  systems  on  the  vessel  and  illegally  fished  in  the
Papua New Guinea EEZ.

The second case, “Giant Ocean”, illustrated the problem of systematic forced labor and human
trafficking in Taiwan’s distant water fishery. Giant Ocean was a Cambodian recruitment agency
operated  by  Taiwanese  with  strong  ties  back  to  Taiwan.  In  May  2012,  the  Cambodian
government initiated the first discussion with civil society organizations about Giant Ocean, and
it  was  estimated  afterwards  that  Giant  Ocean  had  trafficked  more  than  1,000  Cambodians  to
work  as  migrant  fishers  predominantly  on  Taiwanese-flagged  vessels.  The  survivors  gave
similar  and  harrowing  accounts  of  how  they  were  tricked  about  working  conditions,  starvation,
debt  bondage,  physical  abuse,  lack  of  medical  care,  death  threats,  and  21  hours  of  work  per
day.  In  April  2014,  six  Taiwanese  running  Giant  Ocean  were  convicted  in  absentia  of  human
trafficking.  All  were  sentenced  to  ten  years  in  prison  and  ordered  to  pay  the  150  identified
victims.  However,  only  the  manager  of  Giant  Ocean  went  to  prison  while  the  rest  of  the  five
criminals remained at large.

The  last  case  took  place  on  August  17,  2014,  when  five  men  were  shot  at  sea  in  the  Indian
Ocean. The crime was recorded in a video, which was then uploaded to Youtube. In the video, a
Taiwanese-flagged  vessel  Chun  I  No.  217  was  spotted.  The  vessel  owner  of  Chun  I  No.  217,
Mr. Lin, who owned a dozen vessels and was also the Executive Director of the Taiwan Tuna
Association  and  the  Taiwan  Deep  Sea  Tuna  Fishery  Development  Foundation,  told  the  New
York  Times  that  he  was  not  aware  that  one  of  his  vessels  was  sailing  in  the  area  where  the
shooting took place. However, the New York Times later reported that a Sri Lankan security firm
Avant  Garde  Maritime  Services  was  authorized  to  put  armed  guards  on  Mr.  Lin’s  vessels.
However,  despite  this  evidence  that  should  have  triggered  more  investigation,  the  Taiwanese
FA advised that the victims of the shooting were pirates, that the shooters were armed security,
and that Chun I No. 217 was “passing by” at the time.

Investigative Reports from Media

The News Lens

2018:  Welcome  to  Taiwan:  Beatings,  Bodies  Dumped  at  Sea  and  a  Culture  of  Maritime
Abuse23

Apart from NGOs, the media have also shed light on human rights abuses of migrant fishers on
Taiwanese  DWF  vessels.  In  2018,  The  News  Lens  interviewed  a  crew  member  on  the
Taiwanese-flagged  vessel  Fu  Tzu  Chieun,  where  the  Indonesian  fisher  Supriyanto  died.  The
crew  member  reported  that  Supriyanto’s  fatal  wounds  resulted  from  continuous  abuse  by  the
captain  and  fellow  crew  members.  The  editor  also  learned  during  a  visit  with  the  YFMU  that
Taiwanese vessels had a practice of throwing bodies of deceased fishers out to sea, rendering
it impossible to determine the cause of death.

The Reporter and Tempo Magazine

2017: Slavery at Sea24

In  2017,  a  Taiwanese  journal  “The  Reporter”  worked  with  an  Indonesian  journal  “Tempo
Magazine” to publish the report “Slavery at Sea”, documenting the lives of Indonesian migrant
fishers on Taiwanese fishing vessels through interviews of dozens of migrant fishers and former
migrant fishers, sponsors or brokers who recruited them, as well as agents spread throughout
Indonesia. According to the investigation, the work on tuna longliners was on average over 20
hours a day, and sometimes when there was a lot of fish, the migrant fishers were not allowed
to sleep for the whole day. Some reported that If they were slow at work, they were lined up and
beaten on the face by the captains. They had to dive into the water without an oxygen tank to

clean  the  turbine  of  the  vessel.  Living  conditions  were  allegedly  terrible.  Migrant  fishers
reportedly slept on whatever they could find in a stuffy room. Some migrant fishers reported that
they had no choice but to thaw the ice from the storage to drink because potable water was not
shared by the captain. It was such maltreatment that led a group of Indonesian migrant fishers
to kill the captain of the Taiwanese-flagged vessel Te Hung Hsing 368 in 2013.

Section VI. Significant incidence of child labor or forced labor

the  Taiwanese  government’s

The findings from Greenpeace’s 2019-2020 reports and the additional corroborative information
presented above warrants a determination from ILAB that there is indeed a significant incidence
of  forced  labor  in  Taiwan’s  tuna  industry.  The  totality  of  information  in  this  briefing,  especially
the
considering
dissemination  of  information  about  forced  labor  in  its  DWF  fleet,  supports  a  conclusion  that
forced labor is not an isolated practice limited to one or a few  companies, but a  government-
enabled model of exploitation that has been endemic in the industry for many years. Even with
the Taiwanese government’s attempts at obscuring the true conditions of migrant fishers in its
DWF fleet, Greenpeace and others have documented a pattern of abuse that suggests forced
labor may actually be a characteristic of the tuna industry as a whole.

laws,  policies,  and  practices

limit

that

Forced  labor  in  the  Taiwanese  DWF  industry  is  a  direct  result  of  Taiwan’s  laws,  policies,  and
practices  that  enable  overexploitation  of  global  tuna  fisheries  at  the  expense  of  vulnerable
Southeast Asian migrant fishers. Such laws, policies, and practices include overcapitalization of
the DWF fleet, transshipment at sea, inadequate observer coverage on longline fishing vessels,
lack  of  port  State  labor  inspections,  ineffective  and  inadequate  restrictions  on  time  at  sea,
systematic  discrimination  against  migrant  fishers,  and  lack  of  oversight  by  the  competent
authority  on  labor  matters.  Taiwan’s  discriminatory  two-tiered  system  and  the  failure  of  its
Fisheries Agency in protecting migrant fishers in the DWF fleet are discussed below.

Taiwan’s overseas employment scheme, or two-tiered system, differentiates between domestic
employment  of  migrant  fishers  on  vessels  operating  predominantly  in  Taiwan’s  waters,  and
overseas employment of migrant fishers on Taiwanese DWF vessels operating in international
waters  or  the  EEZs  of  other  countries.  The  latter  embark  and  disembark  from  their  working
vessels at foreign ports. Migrant fishers working on DWF vessels are subject to the Regulations
on  the  Authorization  and  Management  of  Overseas  Employment  of  Foreign  Crew  Members
administered  by  Taiwanese  FA  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  TFA  Regulations).  Taiwanese
fishers  working  on  DWF  vessels,  on  the  other  hand,  are  subject  to  the  Labor  Standards  Act
promulgated by the Ministry of Labor . These two laws establish very different labor standards,
thus creating a discriminatory two-tiered system in which migrant fishers who do the same work
as  their  Taiwanese  counterparts  are  subject  to  different  treatment.  The  minimum  wage  for
Taiwanese fishers under the Labor Standards Act is set at around USD 740 per month while the
minimum wage for migrant fishers under the TFA Regulations is only set at USD 450 per month.
Each  migrant  fisher  in  Taiwan’s  distant  water  fleet  is  potentially  losing  roughly  USD  3,480  per

14

year due to this system. Migrant fishers in the DWF fleet may also face unequal and excessive
working  hours  compared  to  Taiwanese  fishers.  Unless  otherwise  negotiated  with  their
employers, Taiwanese fishers may work up to eight hours a day under the Labor Standards Act
whereas  TFA  Regulations  permit  employers  to  demand  migrant  fishers  work  as  much  as  14
hours  straight.25  These  are  just  two  examples  of  the  unequal  treatment  migrant  fishers  in  the
Taiwanese DWF industry face. The two-tiered system as a whole increases migrant fishers’ risk
of forced labor while significantly reducing the operating costs of the Taiwanese DWF fleet.

As  noted  above,  the  Taiwanese  FA  is  responsible  for  administering  the  TFA  regulations  and
ostensibly protecting all fishers, including migrant fishers, in the DWF fleet. However, the TFA,
as demonstrated through its failed statements and actions, lacks the labor expertise to properly
conduct labor inspections and ensure the labor rights of over 22,000 migrant fishers working on
Taiwanese vessels. In the latest FA list of vessels violating The Act for Distant Water Fisheries,
unapproved recruitment of migrant fishers accounted for 41% of total violations.26 This high rate
shows  again  the  inability  or  unwillingness  of  the  FA  to  enforce  its  regulation  on  overseas
employment  of  migrant  fishers.  Migrant  fishers  recruited  without  approval  of  the  Taiwanese
government  are  more  vulnerable  to  debt  bondage,  forced  labor,  human  trafficking,  and  other
human rights abuses.

The  Taiwanese  government  and  tuna  industry,  and  the  global  seafood  traders  and  American
companies that source from the Taiwanese DWF fleet, may point to past reforms and ongoing
initiatives to reduce forced labor as evidence the problem has subsided, but a close examination
shows  these  efforts  have  been  ineffective  and  forced  labor  persists  because  of  their  failure  to
tackle its root causes. The continued identification of potential IUU and forced labor cases after
the  EU  lifted  Taiwan’s  yellow  card  in  2019  shows  that  the  Taiwan  government’s  reforms  are
simply  not  enough.27  The  information  in  this  briefing  proves  that  incremental  approaches,
including government efforts to tinker with the existing framework for DWF and industry efforts
to promote national instead of international standards,28 are inadequate to uproot a problem that
requires more urgent and serious actions.

Section VII. Conclusion

This  briefing  presents  the  information  ILAB  needs  to  justifiably  add  Taiwan-caught  tuna  to  the
2020  TVPRA  List.  Even  in  an  unduly  restrictive  data  collection  environment,  Greenpeace  and
other  organizations  have  gathered  sufficient  evidence  to  demonstrate  significant  incidence  of
forced labor in Taiwan's DWF industry. This conclusion is reinforced by the systemic nature of
forced labor in the industry where this abuse is underpinned by the government’s laws, policies,
and  practices  that  are  designed  to  exploit  vulnerable  migrant  fishers  in  order  to  overfish  our
oceans.

To  effectively  combat  forced  labor  in  the  Taiwanese  tuna  industry,  Greenpeace  recommends
ILAB  prioritize  the  following  governmental  and  industry  reforms  in  its  dialogue  with  the
Taiwanese government:

●  Abolish  the  overseas  employment  scheme  for  migrant  fishers,  apply  the  Labor
Standards  Act  to  all  fishers,  including  migrant  fishers  in  the  DWF  fleet,  and  ensure  all
migrant fishers are governed by the Ministry of Labor and thus afforded the same rights
and protections as Taiwanese fishers;

●  Punish  Taiwanese  manning  agencies  if  their  foreign  counterparts  violate  relevant

●

Taiwanese regulations;
Involve  labor  unions  in  the  annual  review  of  manning  agencies  approved  to  recruit
migrant fishers;

●  Adopt and implement the ILO Work in Fishing Convention (C188) within 12 months;
●  Adopt and implement the eight ILO fundamental Conventions;
●  Adopt and implement the ILO Migrant Worker Conventions;
●  Adopt and implement the International Maritime Organization Cape Town Agreement;
●  Adopt  and  implement  a  regulation  on  maximum  time  at  sea  that  limits  vessels  to  three
months  at  sea  so  the  Government  can  conduct  labor  inspections,  and  ensure  all  crew
have paid shore leave and unfettered access to port services for a minimum of 10 days.
Increase the frequency and reliability of labor inspections for all vessels, especially DWF
vessels;

●

●  Handle human trafficking and forced labor cases promptly once reported, strictly enforce

relevant regulations, and increase prosecution and conviction rates;

●  Establish a timely and effective grievance mechanism for migrant fishers, particularly for

urgent cases at sea;

●  End transshipment at sea; and
●  Ensure  100%  observer  coverage  (independent  human  or  effective  electronic  catch

monitoring), and the safety of all observers, on all fishing vessels.

16

Taiwan accounts for the second highest revenue of all DWF fishing entities on the high seas,29
and the US is a major market for tuna caught by Taiwanese-flagged or owned fishing vessels.
The US government has a responsibility to inform the American public of the high risk of forced
labor  in  the  Taiwanese  tuna  industry  and  prevent  American  companies  from  profiting  from
forced  labor  in  their  tuna  supply  chains.  ILAB  has  the  opportunity  with  its  2020  TVPRA  List  to
raise awareness of abuses in the Taiwanese tuna industry, initiate a long overdue dialogue with
American  companies  sourcing
fleet,  and  catalyze  much  needed
the  Taiwanese
governmental  and  industry  reforms  in  Taiwan.  Greenpeace  calls  on  ILAB  to  seize  this
opportunity to protect migrant fishers and uphold the integrity and credibility of its work on forced
labor in the global fishing industry.
