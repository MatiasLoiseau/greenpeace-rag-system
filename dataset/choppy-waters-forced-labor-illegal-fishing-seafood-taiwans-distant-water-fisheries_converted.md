1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Taiwan  is  one  f  the  world’s  largest  dis-

tant water fishing (DWF) powers, with
over  1,100  Taiwanese-flagged  vessels
fishing  across  our  oceans  and  hundreds
more  Taiwanese-owned  vessels  flagged  to
other  countries.1  Taiwan  is  also  home  to
Fong Chun Formosa Fishery Company, Ltd.
(FCF), which has been ranked as one of the
top three tuna traders in the world.2, 3 FCF’s
position  as  a  global  player  was  recently
strengthened with the purchase of US can-
ned tuna company Bumble Bee, further se-
curing its place as a major supplier of tuna
to consumers in the United States.4

In recent years, investigations have revealed
shocking  cases  of  human  rights  abuses  in
fisheries,  including  forced  labour  and  hu-
man  trafficking,  and  identified  Taiwanese
vessels  and  companies  among  the  worst
offenders.  Even  though  the  Taiwanese  go-
vernment  has  recently  amended  relevant
regulations,  progress  has  not  been  enou-
gh:  both  government  and  corporates  con-
tinue to fail to protect the human rights of
migrant  fishers  in  the  Taiwanese  distant
water fishing fleet. In Greenpeace East Asia
reports  Made  in  Taiwan  (2016)  and  Misery
at  Sea  (2018),  Greenpeace  East  Asia  docu-
mented the “laissez-faire” attitude from the
Taiwanese  Fisheries  Agency  (TFA)  towards
both  illegal,  unreported,  and  unregulated
(IUU) fishing and human rights abuses, and
pointed  out  the  influential  role  FCF  could
play in eradicating these practices.

This report is based on a 2019 investigation
conducted  by  Greenpeace  East  Asia,  invol-
ving  interviews  with  migrant  fishers  from
three  fishing  vessels  that  were  either  flag-
ged or linked to Taiwan. We found that IUU
fishing and forced labour, allegedly, still con-
tinue  to  happen  aboard  Taiwanese  fishing
vessels operating in the Atlantic Ocean. The
investigation  indicates  that  violations  of  la-
bour and human rights related laws seem to
remain commonplace in Taiwan’s distant wa-
ter fishing fleet, where over 20,000 migrant
workers,  most  of  whom  are  hired  overseas
from Indonesia and the Philippines, are em-
ployed.5 The labour conditions reported mi-
ght  violate  relevant  Taiwanese  regulations
and  they  fulfil  seven  of  the  eleven  Interna-
tional  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  indicators
of forced labour.

In
interviews  conducted  with  migrant
fishers,  Greenpeace  East  Asia  found  the
indicate  IUU
fishing  activities  described
fishing practices, namely related to shark fin-
ning and illegal transhipments. One fishing
vessel, which has been accused of working
conditions  indicative  of  forced  labour  and
IUU fishing, and one major carrier, which al-
legedly received catch from a fishing vessel
suspected of forced labour and IUU fishing,
are  linked  to  FCF.  In  addition,  Greenpeace
East Asia analysed the automatic identifica-
tion system (AIS) data of the fishing vessels,
where available, and found that the catches
could  have  made  their  way  to  the  market

either  through  transhipment  at  port  or  at
sea. Together, these investigations suggest
that  FCF’s  supply  chains  could  be  tainted
with  “modern  slavery”  and  environmental
destruction.  Without  greater  oversight  and
protective measures in place, consumers in
the  main  fish  markets  and  elsewhere  have
every  reason  for  concern  that  the  seafood
they buy may have been caught illegally, mi-
xed with illegal catches or fished by worke-
rs  subject  to  poor  working  conditions  and
even forced labour.

For many years, Greenpeace has been advo-
cating that major seafood corporations, like
FCF, lead and uphold global fishery reform.
FCF has been upgrading and initiating envi-
ronmental and social policies and programs,
however FCF’s diffused and complex supply
chain,  and  the  many  flags  flown  by  vessels
catching tuna for the company, make trans-
parency of its supply chain all the more im-
portant. FCF must take more proactive and
progressive  actions,  including  enhancing
the traceability of the seafood supply chain;
source  only  from  vessels  that  do  not  take
part in transhipments at sea; strictly comply
with international standards on human and
labour  rights  and  best  practices;  support
legally  binding  agreements  with
labour
unions;  upgrade  its  sustainability  policy;
and  establish  concrete  and  effective  action
plans  to  demonstrate  its  tuna  is  caught  le-
gally  and  responsively,  and  the  workers  in
its supply chain enjoy safe and just working
conditions.

2. INTRODUCTION

2.1 A race to the bottom: forced labour and illegal fishing in distant water fishing

Our oceans are vital for all life on earth. Yet overfishing

and destructive fishing are wreaking havoc on marine
life,  and  threatening  the  food  security  and  livelihoods  of
billions  of  people.  The  United  Nations  Food  and  Agricul-
ture  Organization  (FAO)  estimates  that  one  in  three  glo-
bal fish stocks for which there is information available are
overfished.6 It’s  just  the  tip  of  the  iceberg  for  fish  popu-
lations  as  well  as  the  many  species  of  marine  mammals,
seabirds,  sharks,  or  marine  turtles,  which  are  threatened
or endangered due to the impacts of fishing.  7Despite in-
creasing fishing efforts and more efficient fishing techno-
logies, global fish catches have steadily declined since the
1990s.8 On a warming planet where climate change, ocean
acidification, plastic pollution, and habitat destruction are
already  decimating  ocean  life,  restoring  fish  populations
and  ensuring  well-managed  fisheries  is  of  utmost  impor-
tance - not only to safeguard marine life but to ensure the
food security of 3.1 billion people, many in developing cou-
ntries, for whom fish represents 20% or more of the animal
protein they have access to.9

Due to overfishing, it is becoming more and more difficult
to fish, and fishing vessels must venture further from sho-
re and stay at sea for longer periods of time. Longer trips,
combined  with  scarce  resources  have  contributed  to  an
increase  in  the  overall  cost  of  fishing.  To  maintain  profits,
some  fishing  companies  are  trying  every  possible  method
to  lower  costs,  including  reducing  wages,  transhipping
(transferring catches between ships) to reduce distance tra-
velled and help stay at sea longer, engaging in IUU fishing,
and even using forced labour.

The  problem  of  forced  labour  in  the  fishing  industry  has
been increasingly reported and studied in the past few ye-
ars. Measures used to maintain control over the victims of
forced  labour  and  human  trafficking  include  the  withhol-

ding of partial or all wages, denial of free movement, seizu-
re  of  identity  documents,  and  debt  bondage.10  Research
has revealed that decreasing fish stocks are the driving for-
ce behind forced labour in the industry11 and it is a vicious
cycle: fishing vessels involved with forced labour are deeply
prone to IUU fishing,12 and IUU fishing contributes to over-
fishing and the further decrease of fish stocks.

A  recent  analysis  from  Nature  Communications  aiming  to
understand  what  drives  fishing  vessels  to  use  forced  la-
bour, found that the incidence of modern slavery is correla-
ted with the following conditions:13

•  Prevalence of unreported fishing activities, resulting
in ineffective monitoring and enforcement of laws and
regulations.

•  Distant  water  fishing  operations,  where  regulatory
gaps and insufficient oversight by governments are
an obstacle to detect and prosecute violations of fishe-
ries and labour regulations.

•  High levels of subsidies such as support for cheaper
fuel,  gear,  and  shipping  vessels,  which  reduce  fishing
companies’  operating  costs.  This  creates  a  situation
where  barriers  to  entry  are  lowered,  thus  luring  more
vessels into the fishery, which then leads to overfishing
and overexploitation of fishery resources.

Another method used by the distant water fishing industry
to  reduce  operating  costs  is  transhipment  at  sea,  so  that
the fishing vessel can avoid travelling back to port for ex-
tended periods. This also creates a loophole for IUU fishing,
forced  labour  and  other  crimes.  Monitoring  of  tranship-
ment at sea is difficult and vessels may escape inspection
or other scrutiny.14

2.2 IUU fishing and forced labour

on Taiwan distant water
fishing vessels

In recent years, Taiwan’s fisheries reputation has been dama-

ged  by  cases  where  Taiwanese  distant  water  fishing  vessels

have  been  associated  with  IUU  fishing  activities  and  forced

labour. Taiwan’s inadequate fisheries management led the EU
to issue a yellow card warning in October 2015.15,16 According
to a report published by the Global Initiative Against Transna-

tional Organized Crime in 2019, Taiwan’s estimated IUU Index

score is 3.34 (out of 5), well above the world average of 2.29
and ranks the second highest in the world.17

In  addition  to  IUU  fishing,  various  global  media  and  NGOs

have  exposed  the  shocking  truth  about  forced  labour  abo-
ard  distant  water  fishing  vessels  around  the  world.18,19,20,21 A
Taiwanese fishing vessel, the Fuh Sheng 11, became the first to

be  detained for violating the ILO Work in Fishing Convention
(C188)22 not long after it came into effect in November 2017.23
Consequently, the Taiwanese government vowed to improve

its regulations and conduct inspections in order to tackle for-

ced  labour  on  Taiwanese  fishing  vessels  and  to  protect  the
rights of migrant fishers.24 However, studies and reports con-
tinue to account ways in which Taiwanese fishing vessels are
still involved in forced labour and human trafficking.25

In December 2019, Greenpeace Southeast Asia published Se-

abound: The Journey to Modern Slavery on the High Seas, which

detailed 34 allegations of human rights and labour violations

from  Indonesian  migrant  workers  on  fishing  vessels.  Out  of

the  13  vessels  involved,  five  were  Taiwanese  vessels,  seven

mainland  Chinese  vessels,  and  one  Fijian  vessel.  Two  of  the

five Taiwanese vessels, were Taiwanese owned but operating
under  flags  of  convenience  (FOC).26  Allegations  included  de-
ception, physical violence, wage deductions, passport confis-
cation and excessive working hours.27

2.3 Discrimination against

migrant fishers and the two-
tiered system

In  Taiwan,  migrant  fishers  working  on  distant  water  fishing
vessels  receive  unequal  treatment  compared  to  Taiwane-
se  fishers.  Migrant  fishers  working  on  distant  water  fishing
vessels are subject to the Regulations on the Authorization and
Management of Overseas Employment of Foreign Crew Members
administered by Taiwan Fisheries Agency (hereafter referred to
as    the  TFA  Regulations).  On  the  contrary  Taiwanese  fishers
working  on  distant  water  fishing  vessels  are,  subject  to  the
Labour Standard Act as promulgated by the Ministry of Labour
(unless specified otherwise in their contracts) These two laws
establish two different labour standards, and thus create dis-
crimination, in which different nationalities are subject to di-
fferent treatments for the same work. For Taiwanese fishers,
the  minimum  wage  under  the  Labour  Standard  Act  is  set  at
USD 740 per month; while for migrant fishers, the minimum
wage under TFA Regulations is only set at USD 450 per mon-
th. In sum, each migrant fisher in Taiwan’s distant water fleet
is potentially losing roughly USD 3,480 per year. For working
hours, if not negotiated otherwise with the employers, Taiwa-
nese fishers may work up to eight hours a day under the La-
bour  Standard  Act,  while  TFA  Regulations,  establish  a  period
of  10  hours  of  rest  per  day,  which  could  imply  that  migrant
fishers work as much as 14 hours straight. This different tre-
atment is thus in contravention of the ILO Discrimination (Em-
ployment and Occupation) Convention (C 111), which Taiwan
has ratified,28 and the ILO migrant worker Conventions (C97
and C143).

In  addition  to  this  unequal  treatment  between  Taiwanese
and migrant fishers working on distant water fishing vessels,
Taiwan  uses  a  two-tiered  system  that  creates  another  gap
among migrant fishers. Under this system, Taiwan differentia-
tes between domestic employment of migrant fishers, opera-
ting predominantly in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
waters,  and  overseas  employment  of  migrant  fishers,  who
work abroad Taiwanese distant water fishing vessels, opera-
ting in international waters or the EEZ of other countries. The
latter embark and disembark from their working vessels at fo-
reign ports. For migrant fishers working in Taiwan’s EEZ, they
are subject to the Labour Standard Act, as Taiwanese fisher.29

The Taiwanese government states that it is working to incor-
porate the Work in Fishing Convention into domestic law, whi-
ch will affect both the migrant fishers employed domestically
and overseas,30 however it does not plan to abolish the two-
-tiered system.31

3. METHODOLOGY

In  order  to  establish  whether  labour  abuses  and

IUU  fishing  continue  to  be  a  prevailing  problem  in
the  Taiwanese  distant  water  fishing  fleet  in  2019,  in-
vestigators  from  Greenpeace  East  Asia  visited  one  of
the ports most frequented by Taiwanese vessels. Gre-
enpeace East Asia interviewed migrant fishers working
on  the  fishing  vessels  flagged  or  otherwise  linked  to
Taiwan, as well as analyzed their contracts and salary
slips. Based on the interviews with the fishers (the in-
terview  questionnaire  is  as  Appendix  1),  this  report
reveals  the  complex  network  navigated  by  migrant
fishers involving Taiwanese manning agencies, foreign
manning  agencies,  fishing  vessels,  and  carrier  ships.
This  investigation  takes  place  some  18  months  after
the  Greenpeace  report  Misery  at  Sea  was  released,
and  shortly  after  the  EU  lifted  the  yellow  card  issued
to Taiwan under EU laws aiming to fight IUU fishing.32

The report also compares the situation on the vessels
against  relevant  Taiwanese  regulations,  International
Labour  Organization  (ILO)  conventions,  and  the  for-
ced  labour  indicators  of  ILO.33  Furthermore,  through
analyzing the AIS of the vessels, we identify ports whe-
re  the  vessels  docked,  and  potential  transhipment  at
sea behaviors.

In order to effectively curb IUU fishing and forced la-
bour,  corporations  need  to  fulfill  their  own  responsi-
bilities as well. This report also looks at one of the big
three tuna traders, FCF, and assesses the effectiveness
of its environmental and social policies, and provides
further recommendations.

4. FINDINGS

Greenpeace  East  Asia  investigated  and  con-

tacted  over  10  migrant  Indonesian  fishers
working onboard distant water fishing vessels, and
further looked into the labour conditions of four of
the fishers working on two Taiwanese vessels and
a Japanese vessel.34 It was found that:

•  There is still a high risk of forced labour in Taiwan’s distant water fishing
fleet,  as  demonstrated  by  the  presence  of  ILO  forced  labour  indica-
tors such as excessive overtime, debt bondage, and retention of iden-
tity documents.

•  The  excessively  complicated  recruitment  process  for  distant  water
fishing  fleets  makes  it  even  harder  to  prevent  migrant  fishers  from
being  exploited  while  they  are  already  discriminated  against  in  Taiwan’s
current two-tiered system.

•  Evidence  exists  of  shark  finning  and  illegal  transfer  of  crew  and  shark
fins between vessels. Given that interviews with the four fishers indica-
ted presence of forced labour, it reinforces the correlation between IUU
fishing and forced labour.

More details of the analysis are as follows. Some of the vessel names and all the
fishers’ names are presented using code due to the fact that these cases are, as
of writing, being investigated by the Taiwanese authorities, as well as to protect
the identity of fishers that Greenpeace East Asia contacted.

Cases and evidence

4.1.1 Reports of the fisher story

Fisher story 1

According to the fisher, he was employed by a manning
agency  in  his  hometown  to  work  aboard  Taiwanese
fishing vessel Wei Ching. After signing a contract with the
agency, he took a flight to Dakar, Senegal then boarded
the vessel Lisboa, which transported him out of port to
the  Taiwanese  longliner  Wei  Ching  (as  shown  in  image
1). The Lisboa appears to be a Senegalese fishing vessel
according to the ICCAT record of authorized fishing ves-
sels. 35 He signed his contract with an Indonesian agency,
but  he  claimed  not  to  have  received  a  copy.  The  fisher
also claimed the monthly salary was USD 450, but a de-
posit of USD 100 per month was deducted for the first
eight  months.  These  conditions,  as  reported,  including
no  copy  of  contract,  being  transferred  at  sea  by  other
vessel, and salary deduction, are all in violation of the TFA
regulation, if true (see Table 2).

2020.03.06

Greenpeace East Asia sent a letter to provide an opportunity

to comment, and in the letter of reply from the vessel owner

of  Wei  Ching,  it  claimed  to  have  paid  the  salary  fully  and

suggested  that  the  (unidentified)  manning  agency  should

take  the  responsibility  for  any  deduction.  TFA  claimed

that  they  did  not  find  salary  deduction  in  the  audit  of  Wei

Ching.  Greenpeace  East  Asia  also  sent  the  opportunity  to

comment to Yuh Jan, and the company claimed that they are

in compliance with the regulation in Senegal for the fisher

transhipment,  and  denied  responsibility  for  ensuring  that

vessels that it works with provide humane conditions for its

workers,  noting  that  its  services  are  limited  exclusively  to

land and port operations.

It’s said that one can earn more mo-
ney on the sea, so for the sake of my
family and the future of my kids, I de-
cided to give it a try.
― Fisher working on board Wei Ching reported.

Fisher story 2

According  to  the  fisher,  working  aboard  the  Taiwanese
Longliner  A,  he  couldn’t  afford  the  tuition  fees  to  attend
maritime  vocational  school,  so  he  applied  to  become  a
fisher  through  a  local  manning  agency  in  his  hometown.
The fisher stated that he waited six months before he was
offered work aboard Taiwanese fishing vessel Longliner A.
The fisher said that he was transported to Longliner A by
a  Senegalese  fishing  vessel,  Longliner  M,  included  in  the
ICCAT  record  of  authorised  vessels.  Hung  Hsing  Oceans
Development Co. Ltd.,36 signed the contract as representa-
tive of Longliner A. However, this company is not on the list
of manning agencies approved by TFA,37 nor is it the owner
of Longliner A. (as shown in image 1)

In addition, the contract of the fisher shows: 1) The trans-
portation  expenses  are  listed  as  debts  to  the  owner,
which means he would need to pay back unless he com-
pleted the full term of the contract, 2) Life insurance for
the fisher with an insured value of approximately TWD
210,000,38  3)  “In  case  of  unresolved  disputes,  the  local
court  in  Jakarta,  where  the  contract  was  signed,  will  ser-
ve as the permanent arbitrator,” but with no further in-
formation on how to report a dispute, 4) “Each fishing
operation will take at least 12 months, and the fisher is not
allowed to terminate his contract prematurely by citing
any  work-related  emotional  or  psychological  reasons.”  5)
The  vessel  owner  can  reassign  the  crew  to  other  fishing
vessels,  6)  USD  150  must  be  deducted  for  the  first  six
months  as  deposit,  7)  No  specification  on  working
hours, rest time or compensatory rest, which are all
in violation of TFA Regulations (see Table 2).

2020.03.06

Greenpeace East Asia sent a letter to provide an oppor-
tunity to comment, and in the letter of reply from Hung
Hsing,  the  company  offered  no  explanation,  but  said
they were prepared to explain to TFA. At the same time,
TFA also responded to the discovery last year that the-
re were migrant workers onboard Longliner A who had
been  hired  without  permission  and  fined  the  owner
company. Based on the TFA’s reply, they have taken an
initial  look  but  have  not  found  the  situation  of  salary
deduction, insufficient insurance, and rest time on this
vessel yet.

Fisher story 3

Another fisher worked aboard Longliner A through an Indo-

nesian manning agency that was affiliated with the school

he  graduated  from.  He  signed  a  contract  with  Taiwanese

manning  agency,  Kaohsiung  Fishing  Vessel  Crew  Services
Association, 39 which was approved by the TFA, but he clai-

med not to receive a copy of the contract. According to the

fisher, he was transported to Longliner A at sea by another

Japanese vessel,  Longliner B. (as shown in image 1) Based

on the interview with the fisher, the life insurance was only
an  insured  value  of  approximately  210,000  TWD,40  and  a

total  of  USD  800  was  deducted  from  his  monthly  salary

as deposit during the first 6 months. These conditions, as

reported,  including  being  transferred  at  sea  by  different

vessels, no copy of contract, amount of life insurance, and

salary deduction, are in violation of TFA Regulations, if true

(see as Table 2).

2020.03.06

Greenpeace  East  Asia  sent  a  letter  to  provide  an  opportu-

nity to comment, and in the letter of reply from Kaohsiung

Fishing Vessel Crew Services Association, the association res-

ponded that they had explained the reasons to the TFA last

year. In the letter of reply to TFA, Greenpeace East Asia also

asked if Kaohsiung Fishing Vessel Crew Services Association

did not provide a copy of contract to the fisher, but TFA didn’t
respond to this question.

Fisher story 4

The  fisher  worked  aboard  Japanese  fishing  vessel
Longliner  B through  a  manning  agency  in  his  home-
town.  He  said  he  was  initially  required  to  carry  out
miscellaneous  work  on  a  vessel  named  Vessel  S  for
two  weeks  before  he  was  transferred  to  vessel  Lon-
gliner  B.  (as  shown  in  image  1)  The  fisher  signed  his
bilingual contract with four parties including the ves-
sel representative, a Taiwanese manning agency, and
a manning agency in his hometown. According to the
contract,  he  would  receive  a  monthly  salary  of  USD
450, but a total deposit of USD 800 was to be deduc-
ted for the first four months. However this deduction
is  in  violation  of  Taiwanese  regulation,  under  which
the ship owner should pay the full wage.

Even  though  Longliner  B  is  registered  as  a  Japane-
se-flagged  vessel,  and  the  ship  owner  is  registered
in  Japan  according  to  ICCAT,  the  fisher ’s  contract
showed  the  company  is  based  in  Kaohsiung,  Taiwan.
According  to  the  Taiwanese  Register  of  Companies,
the registered address belongs to three other Taiwa-
nese  fishing  companies  who  are  sharing  the  same
address.  This  suggests  that  Longliner  B  may  be  a
foreign-flagged  fishing  vessel  with  Taiwanese  inves-
tors.

In  the  contract,  the  representative  of  the  vessel
owner  is  a  manning  agency  registered  on  the  Taiwa-
nese Register of Companies, 41 but is not approved by
the  TFA  to  recruit  workers  for  fishing  vessels.  The-

re  are  major  discrepancies  between  the  crew ’s  con-
tract  and  the  TFA  Regulations.  First,  the  contract
states:  “Any  disputes  that  occurred  during  the  con-
tracted period must be reported to the vessel owner
or  the  captain.  Disputes  should  only  be  reported  to
the  manning  agency  in  Indonesia  or  the  Taiwanese
fishery  company  when  they  cannot  be  resolved  by
the  owner  or  the  captain.  If  the  fisher  reports  the
issue  to  any  other  authority,  the  vessel  owner  is  no
longer responsible for the fisher ’s safety and that the
vessel  owner  bears  no  more  responsibility  to  send
the fisher to his country of origin.” The contract does
not  provide  the  fisher  safe  conditions  to  report  to
competent  authorities,  which  is  required  by  the  afo-
rementioned  TFA  Regulations.  Second,  even  though
the contract states that the fisher was allowed to ter-
minate the contract with 30 days notice, the contract
prohibits the fisher from terminating the contract on
the  basis  of  excessive  workload  or  working  hours,
lack of  awareness about the nature of the work that
would be required of him, or having a ill family mem-
ber, all of which rendered the contract overly binding.
Thirdly,  the  contract  stated,  “During  the  contracted
period, the captain reserves the right to transfer the
crew  member  to  other  vessels  without  the  fisher ’s
consent.”  Under  the  regulation  of  the  TFA,  reassig-
nment  is  prohibited  without  renewing  contracts  to
re-designate working vessels.

11

I  felt  cheated  by  the  agency.  Accor-
ding to the contract, I was supposed
to  set  out  to  work  as  soon  as  I  had
all my papers ready, but there were
so many delays. The agency came up
with all these excuses about my visa
and  identification  and  so  on.  ―  The
fisher working on board Longliner A reported.

4.1.2 Reports of abusive working and living

conditions

The fisher claimed that the owner of Wei Ching did not
have insurance to cover medical treatment for any in-
juries, and while the vessel was at sea the crew were
only able to get some medicine and one day off when
they were sick.

On the Wei Ching, the fisher claimed to work 18 hours
a  day  with  only  two  to  three  hours  of  sleep  on  ave-
rage. Moreover, there were no clauses in the contract
specifying  when  the  fishers  could  take  time  off.  On
Longliner A, the two fishers reported working18 hours
a  day  on  average  and  as  many  as  34  hours  straight.
They claimed only had five to six hours of rest and sle-
ep per day, and got one or two days off when they had
finished hauling all lines back onto the vessel. On Lon-
gliner B, the fisher said he worked on average 16 hours
per day with only six hours for sleep, and did not get
any days off. If these conditions are reported are true,
they are in violation of TFA Regulations (see Table 2).

The fisher said that they had to put up with very limi-
ted  space  on  board  Wei  Ching.  According  to  him,  he
had to sleep in a space of only around half a meter in
width. He also told that he had three meals each day
- noon, 6pm and midnight - and each meal break las-
ted between 10 to 15 minutes. According to the fisher,
Indonesian fishers who did not eat pork for religious
reasons could only eat fish or dried squid with vinegar.

In addition to reporting long working hours and poor
living conditions, the fishers interviewed also claimed
inadequate  safety  measures  on  the  fishing  vessels.
None  of  the  four  fishers  appeared  to  have  sufficient
safety  measures  or  equipment  for  their  work  on  the
fishing vessels. They all mentioned that when working
on the ship, they only had gloves and uniforms and no
safety  equipment  such  as  life  jackets.  It’s  noteworthy
that currently in Taiwan, there is an Occupational Safety
and Health Act, which stipulates that “Employers should
make  sure  the  employees  wear  life  jackets  when
working on the water, and set up monitoring person-
nel and life-saving equipment.”42 This regulation is ad-
ministered by the Ministry of Labour, and now applies
to migrant fishers and Taiwanese fishers working in co-
astal  waters.  This  again  demonstrates  discrimination
in terms of occupational safety against migrant fishers
working on distant water vessels.

One time, my friend’s head was in-
jured  by  a  buoy  and  started  blee-
ding.  He  couldn’t  work  for  over  a
week  at  the  time.  All  he  could  do
was  take  some  medication,  eat
and sleep. That’s all. He wasn’t in-
sured.  ―  The  fisher  working  on  board  Wei
Ching reported.

2020.03.06

In the letter of reply from the vessel owner of Wei Ching and

the  TFA,  TFA  responded  that  Wei  Ching  did  insure  for  the

foreign crew member the accident, health and life insurance,

and the insured amount of the life insurance is one million

NTD.  Wei  Ching  also  said  that  the  value  of  insurance  is  in

compliance  with  TFA  Regulations.  Concerning  the  working

hours, Wei Ching responded that the fishers are grouped in

a  shifting  system,  and  they  have  no  less  than  ten  hours  of

rest per day and less than four days off per month, which is

in compliance with the regulation of TFA. Wei Ching also said

that the beds for the fishers are standard size for single beds,

and that the vessel is equipped with a reverse osmosis water

machine ensuring that all fishers have clean water to drink,

all sorts of medicines and life-saving jackets. Regarding the

time for each meal, Wei Ching responded that according to

the shift schedule on board, fishers should have around 30

minutes for each meal.

Sometimes, we had to boil water from
melted ice or the AC just to get some
drinking  water.  One  time,  we  drank
water that looked orange in color for
three  days  straight.  Water  is  suppo-
sed to be completely clear, but since
we didn’t have any drinking water in
our reserve, and the buckets that we
used to store water weren’t clean, we
had to make do with the ‘orange jui-
ce’ water. ― The fisher working on board Wei
Ching reported.

4.1.3 Possible violations of international standards

and Taiwanese labour regulations

In order to identify possible violations of labour law
or instances of forced labour, Greenpeace East Asia
compared  the  information  from  fishers  interviews
and contracts against ILO indicators of forced labour
and TFA Regulations (see Table 1 and Table 2). Table
2 also includes information from the contracts of two
additional fishers, working on two Taiwanese vessels
mentioned  in  the  report  Seabound:  The  Journey  to
Modern Slavery on the High Seas.

There are several possible violations of ILO’s core la-
bour  standards,  43and  Work  in  Fishing  Convention,
which  is  the  only  international  instrument  that  esta-
blishes the minimum labour standards for fishers. In
addition,  Taiwan’s  two-tiered  system,  which  results
in  unequal  treatment  of  migrant  fishers  working  in
distant water fishing vessels compared to Taiwanese
fishers,  is  a  violation  of  the  ILO  Discrimination  (Em-
ployment  and  Occupation)  Convention  and  the  ILO
migrant  worker  Conventions  (C97  and  C143).  44 (See
as Table 3)

According  to  the  testimonies  of  the  crews  interview,
contracts and other documents:

：

1.  Migrant fishers were not able to exercise their ri-
ghts  as  they  were  not  familiar  with  nor  properly
informed about, relevant regulations in Taiwan, le-
aving  them  vulnerable  to  exploitation.  They  were
also  not  equipped  to  seek  advice  insofar  as  it  is
accurate that they did not get to keep hard copies
of  their  contracts,  were  not  given  ways  to  make
complaints  to  competent  authorities,  and  were
not  aware  that  fishing  vessel  owners  are  unable
to force them to transfer to a new vessel, and if so
must offer them new contracts before reassigning
them over to the other vessel.

2.  Reports of excessive overtime and abusive working
and living conditions on fishing vessels, including
regular working hours of 16 to 18 hours per day
and extended working periods of 28 to 34 hours
straight, lack of days off, cramped living quarters,
and water sanitation problems.

3.  To  prevent  fishers  from  escaping,  some  captains
reportedly confiscated passports or withheld pay
to control them.

4.  Wages were deducted to pay back deposits, which

violates TFA Regulations. (See Table 2)

5.  All  the  fishers  were  reportedly  transported  by
carriers or  other  fishing vessels  from land to  the
fishing vessels they worked on, which violates TFA
Regulations.45

6.  Based  on  the  presence  of  certain  ILO  forced  la-
bour  indicators,  the  allegations  in  all  four  cases
here appeared to have satisfied the ILO definition
of  forced  labour,  i.e.  involuntary  work  under  the
menace of penalty.  46 47(See as Table 1)

7.  Apart from the systematic violation of C 111, whe-
re  migrant  fishers  working  in  distant  waters  are
subject to lower labour standards than Taiwanese
fishers,  labour  conditions  on  all  the  four  fishing
vessels  severely  contravene  the  Work  in  Fishing
Convention.(See as Table 3)

law when the vessel operators recruit crew through foreign manning agencies. So here we treat it as a violation.

We  only  got  to  sleep  for  five  hours  if  and  when  we  caught
some fish. If we didn’t catch anything, we’d just have to keep
working,  even  for  34  hours  straight.  If  it  were  possible,  I’d
like to change how much time we have to work and rest, to
meet the needs of human bodies. There’s got to be a way to
make  it  more  balanced,  just  like  how  people  who  work  on
land do it.                 ― The fisher working on board Longliner A reported.

4.2 Potential cases of IUU fishing

Greenpeace East Asia has looked at the four migrant fishers’ accou-
nts of their fishing operations, and compared these against relevant
fishing regulations stipulated by either RFMOs or the Taiwanese go-
vernment.  Their  testimonies  suggest  that  these  exploited  workers
have been ordered, or given incentives, to participate in IUU activities
such as shark finning and unauthorized transhipments.

4.2.1 Migrant fishers’ testimony: Shark

finning and transhipments at sea

In addition to the fixed salaries, migrant fishers reported that they
could receive bonuses for the shark fins, so whenever they caught
a  shark,  they  would  cut  the  shark’s  pectoral,  dorsal,  pelvic,  anal
and caudal fins and throw the rest of the body back into the water,
a  practice  commonly  referred  to  as  ‘shark  finning.’  According  to
the  testimonies,  when  Lisboa  transported  migrant  fishers  to  Wei
Ching, it would also pick up the shark fins from the fishing vessel.
The rest of the catch on Wei Ching was transshipped at sea to a Ja-
panese carrier vessel (name unknown). Vessel S, which transported
the fisher to Longliner B, also picked up shark fins from Longliner
A and Longliner B.

According to the fisher who worked onboard Longliner A, the catch
was transshipped at sea to a Panama-flagged carrier vessel Ibuki,
as well as other carrier vessels, once every three months.

The testimonies provided by the fishers might be indicative of the
following suspected IUU activities (as illustrated by Image 2) :

•  The shark fin transhipments, as described above, between the
Wei Ching and Lisboa and between Longliner A and B and Vessel
S, would be in violation of ICCAT’s regulation on transhipments
which states that the catch of a fishing vessel can only be trans-
shipped to a carrier vessel included in the ICCAT record of ves-
sels authorized to transship,50 and that transhipments between
different  fishing  vessels  are  regarded  as  IUU  fishing.  Further,
ICCAT’s  rules  on  the  conservation  of  sharks  prohibit  discar-

We  caught  about  100  kilograms
of dried shark fins in eight mon-
ths  and  threw  away  the  bodies.
We  only  kept  the  fins  because
we couldn’t sell the bodies. ― The

fisher working on board Wei Ching reported.

We  only  kept  the  fins  of  the
sharks and discarded the rest of
their meat. Last month, I placed
the fins out under the sun to dry,
but  a  few  days  later,  we  spot-
ted  an  American  patrol  boat.
The  captain  got  really  scared
and  told  me  to  hide  all  the  fins
so  that  the  Americans  wouldn’t
find them.  ― The fisherworking on board

Longliner B reported.

ding shark carcasses and the transhipment of fins from finned
sharks.51

•  Wei Ching’s transhipment between fishing vessels and Wei Ching
and Longliner A’s transhipment of shark fins at sea if true, would
be in violation of Taiwan’s Regulations for Tuna Longline Fishing
Vessels Proceeding to the Atlantic Ocean for Fishing Operation,
which mandates that shark carcasses and fins must be trans-
shipped or landed together and that, when transshipped, the
receiving vessel must be a carrier vessel.52

2020.03.06

Greenpeace East Asia sent the letters to provide TFA, Yuh

Jan,  the  owner  of  Wei  Ching  and  Ibuki  an  opportunity  to

comment.  In  the  letter  of  reply  from  the  vessel  owner  of

Wei Ching, it denied the IUU activities. TFA reached out to

the vessel owner of Longliner A, and replied that Lonlinger A

denied having conducted such behaviors. Ibuki replied that

there  was  an  observer  on  board,  and  thus  IUU  activities

could  not  take  place.  Yuh  Jan  said  that  their  services  are

limited  to  port  and  vessel  operations  and  thus  were  not

aware  if  such  IUU  activities  took  place  on  the  fishing

vessels, and were no way linked to such practices.

4.2.2 Potential at-sea transhipments based on AIS records

Greenpeace  East  Asia  has  used  publicly  available  data
from  sources,  including  Global  Fishing  Watch,  Marine
Traffic, and Shipxy.com, to analyze the 2019 AIS tracks of
those vessels mentioned in the crew interviews, including
five  longliners  and  one  carrier  vessel  (as  shown  in  Table
4). No AIS data was available for Vessel S, so it is excluded.
The method developed by Global Fishing Watch to analyze
fishing vessels activities (as shown in Table 5) were used to
identify possible transhipments at sea.53 If crew reports of
illegal catches and forced labour conditions are accurate,
such catches could find their way into the market through
these transshipments.

According  to  fishers’  testimonies,  the  Panama-flagged
carrier vessel Ibuki, would have been involved in tranship-
ment operations with fishing vessels that are suspected to
be involved in IUU fishing and forced labour (see section
4.2.1). In 2019, the Ibuki made a total of 12 port stops, in-
cluding Cape Verde’s Porto Grande, Japan’s Shimizu Port,
Taiwan’s  Kaohsiung  Port,  China’s  Dalian  Port,  Mauritius’s
Port  Louis,  and  South  Africa’s  Cape  Town  Port  (as  shown
in  Image  3).  During  that  period,  our  analysis  of  AIS  data

shows 47 possible transhipment events at sea - including
38 encounters with other vessels and 9 loitering events.54,
55 (See Table 5) The Ibuki stopped at Japan’s Shimizu Port
twice in 2019, once for 25 days and another for 95 days.

The  Taiwanese  fishing  vessel  Wei  Ching,  which  testimony
suggests  could  be  could  be  involved  in  IUU  fishing  or
forced labour,  was potentially involved in three tranship-
ments at sea (as shown by loitering behaviour) and three
port stops over the whole year, visiting South Africa’s Cape
Town  Port,  Senegal’s  Dakar  Port,  and  Ghana’s  Tema  Port
(as  shown  in  Image  3).  It  is  worth  noting  that  one  of  the
loitering  patterns  held  for  227  hours,  almost  ten  days,
which may imply encounter and transhipment with other
vessel(s).

For Longliner M, the Senegalese fishing vessel, during the
period of time when it had AIS data, it made two stops in
Senegal’s  Dakar  Port  (as  shown  in  Image  3).  Though  the
vessel was registered as a longliner, it is worth noting that
Longliner M showed four loitering patterns but no patterns
indicative  of  fishing  operations  at  all,  which  raises  ques-
tions about the nature of its activities.

Note 1: For the purpose of this report bunkers and tugboats are excluded from this analysis.
Note 2: When two vessels were less than 500 meters from each other and maintained speeds
no more than 2 knots for over 3 hours, known as an “encounter.”
Note 3: When a vessel sails at speeds no more than 2 knots for over 8 hours, it is known as
“loitering. Reasons for this to happen could be when transhipments of catch or other supplies
are made, or when the vessel was simply waiting to be assigned to another location.

Note 1: In some cases vessels turn off their AIS at sea, so the AIS data for some of the vessels is incomplete, where this
is done intentionally – known as “going dark” – this raises questions about the purpose of its voyage. Thus, these “dark
vessels” are considered high priority targets for surveillance.
Note 2: Longliner A does not have a complete set of AIS data from which to infer its behavior patterns.
Note 3: Marine Traffic and Global Fishing Watch databases have no AIS history on the vessel Lisboa.

5. HOW TAINTED TUNA CATCH
 COULD ENTER THE MARKET

5.1 FCF’s global reach

Seafood  supply  chains  are  often  long  and  complex,

stretching  from  vessel  building  and  crewing,  fishe-
ries operations on the water, processing and manufac-
turing,  and  then  distribution,  retail  and  consumption.
Companies operate at all stages of the supply chain and
can be roughly characterized as fishing operators, tra-
ders, processors and manufacturers, brands, and retai-
lers. However these roles are not clear cut. Some com-
panies are active at numerous levels of the supply chain.
Moreover, in addition to retailers and brands, food ser-
vice  and  seafood  restaurants  are  also  major  players
through which tuna makes its way to consumers.

The top three tuna traders in the world have been identi-
fied as FCF (Taiwan), Tri Marine (Italy) and Itochu (Japan),58
among  which  FCF  is  the  largest  tuna  trader,59  dealing
500,000 metric tons of tuna annually.60 FCF does not own
fishing fleets but instead works with around 600 fishing
vessels that supply it with fish.61 In turn, FCF supplies a
range of dominant and well-known brands and manufac-
turers, including:

•  Bumble  Bee,  North  America’s  largest  canned  tuna
brand, enjoys a nearly 90% consumer awareness level
in the US and Canada. It is the largest provider of al-
bacore tuna in the US, holding approximately 41% of
the  US  share  of  sales  of  canned  albacore  tuna,  and
the second largest tuna brand overall,62 accounting for
25% of the market share.63 Bumble Bee predominantly
sources its tuna from FCF, especially nearly all of its al-
bacore tuna.64

•  Thai Union, the world’s largest canned tuna manufac-
turer, produces around 18% of the annual global volu-
me of canned tuna for major brands including Chicken
of  the  Sea  (US),  Petit  Navire  (France),  John  West  (UK)
among others. FCF is the main supplier of tuna to Thai
Union.65

•  Sea  Value  and  Chotiwat  Manufacturing,  Thai-
land’s second largest and third largest canned tuna
manufacturers  respectively.66  The  latter  supplies
over  100  canned  tuna  brands  in  total,  and  exports
to over 50 countries and regions.67

•  Toyo Reizo (TOREI), Japan’s largest sashimi trader.
Taiwanese  fishing  vessels  are  one  of  its  primary
sources.68

FCF is also involved in the processing and manufacturing
of tuna products. FCF founded South Seas Tuna Corpo-
ration (SSTC), a processing facility located in Papua New

Guinea, with minority interests from Papua New Guinea’s
government. In Africa, FCF works with South Korea’s Silla
Group to operate a tuna canning factory Cosmo in Tema,
Ghana, which has a capacity of 200 metric tons per day.69

Despite  its  position  as  one  of  the  world’s  biggest  tuna
traders, FCF has maintained a low profile attracting rela-
tively little public attention until it purchased Bumble Bee
in January 2020. Bumble Bee’s former CEO was convicted
of  helping  to  orchestrate  a  price-fixing  conspiracy  be-
tween Bumble Bee, Starkist and Chicken of the Sea, and
Bumble  Bee  was  fined  USD  25  million.70 The  fine  from
the  US  Department  of  Justice,  along  with  the  civil  suits
claiming damages from purchasers of Bumble Bee’s pro-
ducts,  as  well  as  related  and  significant  legal  expenses
led to Bumble Bee’s bankruptcy. 71

Given a strong dependence on FCF, Bumble Bee was sold
to affiliates of FCF in order to continue functioning. In a
declaration to the court, Bumble Bee’s Chief Finance Offi-
cer, Kent McNeil, put it in a straightforward way that, “As a
practical matter, FCF is the only vendor from which Deb-
tors (Bumble Bee) are able to obtain in the near term the
large  quantity  of  tuna  necessary  to  supply  their  consu-
mers with shelf-stable seafood products in the ordinary
course  of  business.  Since  2010,  FCF  has  met  between
95% to 100% of the Debtors’ (Bumble Bee) albacore de-
mand and 70% to 100% of their light meat tuna demand.
This  is  not  surprising  because  FCF  is  responsible  for  a
large percentage of the longline-caught tuna in markets
available to the Debtors (Bumble Bee), and the Debtors’
(Bumble  Bee)  specifications  require  them  to  use  only
longline-caught  tuna  in  their  products.”72 In  addition  to
being Bumble Bee’s most critical vendor, FCF also owned
23% of the company.73 On January 23 2020, the US court
then finalized that Bumble Bee was to be sold to FCF at
USD 930 million.74 With its acquisition of Bumble Bee, FCF
now owns the entire supply chain with the exception of
vessel ownership.

Company  mergers  and  integrations  downstream  have
gradually  cemented  relationships  between  brands  and
manufacturers, making it somewhat easier to trace pro-
ducts  at  this  level.  However,  fishing  vessels  and  traders
in the upstream remain a grey area in the supply chain,
obstructing  the  traceability  of  fishery  products.  FCF
told  Greenpeace  East  Asia  that  40%  of  the  longliners  it
sources  from  are  from  open  markets  that  FCF  compe-
tes with other tuna traders. This means a large percen-
tage  of  fishing  vessels  that  work  with  FCF  do  not  have

FCF Headquarters TAIWAN

a  long-term  partnership  with  the  company.  This  lack  of
long-term, stable cooperation between fishing fleets and
FCF makes it difficult for brands and manufacturers su-
pplied  by  FCF  to  fulfil  their  sustainability  commitments
and  meet  their  human  rights  responsibilities.  Following
its purchase of Bumble Bee, FCF will have more direct ex-
posure to consumers, carrying with it increased pressure
to address IUU fishing and forced labour.

5.2 How tainted catch might enter
the global supply chain via FCF

Greenpeace East Asia has identified various vessels that
worked  with  FCF,  including  Wei  Ching  and  Ibuki  as  des-
cribed earlier, as well as eight vessels identified from AIS
records of Ibuki’s encounters in 2019.75

According to our analysis, the Fwu Maan 88,76 which Gre-
enpeace  Southeast  Asia’s  report  Seabound  identified  as
suspected of using forced labour, also worked with FCF.
The  above  implies  that  to  the  extent  that  there  is  IUU
and forced labour associated with these vessels, tainted
fish catch may already have flowed into the supply chain
of FCF.

According to FCF’s website, Panama-flagged carrier Haru
is one of its Sustainability Program carriers.77 According
to TFA, Haru was involved in an IUU case on April 20 2017
with two Taiwanese purse seiners, Ta Ching no. 666 and
Ching Feng no. 767. According to the verdict from Taipei
High Administrative Court, the two fishing vessels were
to  sell  their  catches  to  FCF,  and  thus  transhipped  the
catches to Haru arranged by FCF. Ta Ching no. 666 and
Ching  Feng  no.  767  notified  TFA  that  Haru  would  unlo-
ad  at  Yamagawa,  Japan.  However,  the  carrier  unloaded
some of its catches first at the Chinese port of Ningbo,
and then went to Yamagawa, Japan. The two purse sei-
ners then notified TFA of the additional unloading after it

had happened, and were fined by TFA for TWD six million
for unloading at Ningbo without the prior authorization
of the TFA, which is mandatory.78

The  two  purse  seiners  appealed  to  the  Taipei  High  Ad-
ministrative  Court  and  then  to  Taipei  Supreme  Admi-
nistrative  Court.  The  two  vessels  argued  that  after  they
transhipped the catch to Haru, they should no longer be
held accountable for the behavior of the carrier. However,
TFA refuted that FCF should know the uploading ports of
Haru, and that Ta Ching no. 666 and Ching Feng no. 767
should  have  asked  FCF  to  clarify  when  transacting  with
FCF.  The courts both supported TFA’s decision to punish
the two purse seiners.79

TFA later explained to Greenpeace East Asia that it is the
responsibility of the fishing vessels instead of the carrier
to notify TFA for unloading, and that this is why the Pana-
ma-flagged Haru was not punished in this case.80 FCF also
said in an opportunity to comment that the Haru was not
involved in an IUU case but the two purse seiners were
fined for late reporting. This late reporting was due to a
misunderstanding of new rules that had just been imple-
mented by the Taiwanese authorities and was not related
in any way to any potential IUU activity.

However,  what  is  significant  in  this  case  is  that  Haru  is
a  carrier  under  FCF’s  Sustainability  Program.  The  pro-
gram  is  verified  by  an  independent  third  party,  yet  one
of  its  carriers  still  gets  involved  in  an  unreported  unlo-
ading. FCF as a global tuna trader, arranging numerous
unloadings and transhipment, should take more actions
to prevent activities such as unreported unloading from
appearing in its supply chain.

6. RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SEAFOOD

COMPANIES

This section reviews what the international community expects

the seafood industry should do to combat IUU fishing and for-
ced labour, as well as assess FCF’s environmental and social po-
licies. In recent years, FCF has shown its will to meet these inter-
national  obligations  by  implementing  a  series  of  environmental
and social policies. However, there is still room for improvement,
and FCF needs to be held to higher international standards given
its  global  influence.  Lastly,  given  the  relationship  between  IUU
fishing and forced labour, this section also reviews the Taiwanese
government’s policy on migrant fishers.

6.1 The international environmental

and social responsibility of seafood
companies

The rights and obligations of States in relation to the con-
servation  of  the  marine  environment,  the  management
of  fishing  activities  or  the  rights  of  workers  engaged  in
fishing,  are  well  established  in  a  range  of  international
laws, regulations, agreements and codes of conduct, whi-
ch has been adopted in the last decades. Companies in-
volved in fishing and fishing related activities throughout
the seafood supply chain, bear great responsibility in en-
suring that these objectives are effectively met, in parti-
cular corporations trading in large amounts of seafood.

The  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea
and  the  FAO  Code  of  Conduct  or  the  UN  Fish  Stocks
Agreement,  are  particularly  relevant  when  it  comes  to
the management of tuna fisheries. It helps to establish
obligations  to  ensure  the  effective  conservation  of  the
marine  environment,  including  keeping  fishing  efforts
within  sustainable  levels,  and  taking  precautionary
approaches  to  fisheries  management  or  the  minimiza-
tion  of  bycatch  and  waste.  Seafood  companies  trading
thousands of tonnes of seafood are in a privileged posi-
tion to ensure that these principles are respected. This
also includes ensuring that the social and economic in-
terests  of  coastal  communities  are  fully  taken  into  ac-
count and that the fishing activities of distant water and
industrial fishing fleets do not undermine them.

The  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and
Human  Rights  (UNGPs),  and  the  ILO  Work  in  Fishing
Convention  (C188)  are  the  international  instruments
most relevant to human rights and labour conditions in
the fishing industry. The UNGPs establish the corporate
responsibility to respect human rights, which consists of
a robust human rights policy that covers at a minimum,
the international bill of human rights81 and the ILO core
labour  standards,  human  rights  due  diligence,82 and  re-
mediation of negative human rights impacts. This instru-
ment  lays  out  the  expectation  that  seafood  buyers  and
their  suppliers  need  to  be  compliant  with  international
standards,  not  just  the  domestic  laws  of,  for  example,
coastal or flag states, and as such is currently the most
far-reaching  in  terms  of  placing  responsibility  for  com-
pliance  with  international  human  rights  standards  on
multinational enterprises.

The  ILO  Work  in  Fishing  Convention  (C  188)  establishes
international minimum labour standards specific to com-
mercial  fishing.  The  convention  regulates  working  and
living conditions for fishers, including contracts, rest hou-
rs, medical care, and safety and sanitary conditions. This
convention points out that in addition to the role of sta-
tes,  fishing  vessel  owners  have  an  obligation  to  comply
with C 188.

6.2 Comments on FCF’s policies

6.2.1 Insufficient protection of fishing crew rights

•  Low  standards  of  human  rights,  and  thus  not

compatible with UNGPs

Although FCF has instituted a number of environmen-
tal  and  social  initiatives,  there  lacks  concrete  action
plans to  effectively improve and safeguard the labour
rights of crew aboard the fishing vessels it sources tuna
from. Neither of the FIPs include any policies related
to  labour  standards  or  human  rights.  Although  FCF
states that they ask their suppliers to follow relevant
regulations in their Tuna Sustainability Policy, they do
not clearly define which regulations must be followed.
If suppliers only conform to the labour regulations of
the flag state, this would result in a discrepancy in la-
bour standards and human rights protection between
vessels  flagged  to  different  countries.  Based  on  our
research, and Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s Seabound
report,    labour  conditions  on  Taiwanese  fishing  ves-
sels are often found to violate both local and interna-
tional standards. By not specifying which regulation to
refer to, it might leave a loophole for vessel owners to
choose the lowest standard. Particularly, Taiwan does
not  provide  the  best  labour  law  standard  given  that
its ‘two-tiered system’ allows migrant fishers employed
overseas  to  be  discriminated  against  in  terms  of  la-
bour  standard.  In  addition,  citing  national  standards
is also not consistent with the United Nations Guiding
Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights,  which  sti-
pulates  that  standards  should  be  established  based
on international human rights instruments.

•  Failing to specify protections obliged by the Work

in Fishing Convention

The  labour  rights  provisions  in  FCF’s  Tuna  Sustaina-
bility  Policy  are  not  in  line  with  ILO’s  Work  in  Fishing
Convention. FCF’s policy says that the crew must have
“sufficient time to rest,” but this appears to fall short of
the  requirement  under  the  Work  in  Fishing  Conven-
tion that fishing crew must have at least 10 hours of
rest every day. In addition, there are certain conditions
under which the captains could keep the identity do-
cuments of the fishing crew, like for the sake of official
inspection, in case of loss, or for other reasons speci-
fied in a recruitment contract. Though the regulation
specifies that the captain can only retain identity do-
cuments  with  the  consent  of  migrant  fishers,  due  to
the lack of monitoring on board and at sea, this clause
might simply be used to justify the common practice
of  captains  confiscating  migrant  fishers’  passports.
Retaining identity documents is considered an indica-
tor of forced labour by the ILO.

6.2.2 Limited labour audits of longline fleets

In 2019 FCF inspected 18 vessels, 10 of which were pur-
se seiners and eight longliners. This is a worryingly low
number of longline inspections, given the high risk of for-
ced labour on board these vessels.  Purse seiners go into
port  more  often  and  are  subject  to  more  independent
scrutiny, so are required by RFMOs to carry observers on
board  and  generally  make  trips  of  around  one  month.
Longliners, on the other hand, have in most cases obser-
vers on around 5% of trips83 and may stay at sea for mon-
ths  or  even  years  at  a  time.  The  fishing  activity  itself  is
more labour-intensive, often occurring both day and ni-
ght. In short, longline vessels are prone to forced labour.

6.2.3 Most longline vessels supplying FCF are not

covered by any FIP

The  two  longline  FIPs  only  apply  to  a  small  proportion
of FCF’s partner vessels, and there is no FIP covering the
Atlantic  Ocean  where  FCF  also  sources  tuna.  FCF  told
Greenpeace East Asia that only 20% of the longline ves-
sels  supplying  their  tuna  have  joined  a  FIP.  In  addition,
FCF started FIPs with fleets that are the most regular su-
ppliers, but will expand the number of vessels participa-
ting in FIPs.84 This means that only a fraction of the lon-
gline vessels that FCF is working with are committed to
increasing  human  observers  and  electronic  monitoring
to combat IUU fishing.

6.2.4 FCF’s lack of specific regulations on tranship-

ment at sea

FCF  continues  to  let  transhipment  take  place  at  sea  wi-
thout thorough transparency and strict enough control,
which creates a loophole for fish tainted with forced la-
bour  and  IUU  fishing  to  flow  into  the  market.  With  low
observer coverage rate and insufficient monitoring, FCF
cannot be sure that illegal catch or fish tainted with for-
ced labour is not entering its supply chain.

6.2.5 Policies fail to address overfishing

Overfishing  is  one  of  the  major  threats  facing  our  oce-
ans. However, FCF’s policies fail to tackle overfishing. Ac-
cording  to  FCF’s  website,  it  trades  mainly  three  species
of tuna - skipjack, yellowfin, and albacore.85 Out of these
three, the stocks of yellowfin and albacore tuna are alre-
ady decreasing and near threatened.86 Being one of the
top three tuna traders in the world, FCF must take grea-
ter responsibility for conserving marine resources.

Box. FCF’s policies and progress

This  section  examines  FCF’s  tuna-related
environmental  and  social  policies  and  as-
sesses  their  shortcomings,  given  tuna’s
high economic value and its importance in
the ecosystem.

1. Tuna Sustainability Policy

In  March  2019,  FCF  published  its  Tuna
Sustainability  Policy  on  environmen-
tal  conservation  and  fishing  crew  la-
bour  rights.  In  terms  of  environmental
conservation,  FCF  states  it  will  support
RFMO  management  and  conserva-
tion  measures,  support  best  practice
for  ghost  gear,88  promote  and  provide
seafood  certified  by  the  Marine  Sustai-
nability  Council  (MSC),  and  support  the
livelihoods of those dependent on tuna
resources in coastal States.

In regards to fishing crew labour rights,
FCF mandates their suppliers to ensure
the  rights  of  the  fishing  crew,  as  well
as  offering  basic  guidelines  for  crew
working  and  living  conditions,  freedom
of  association,  grievance  procedures,
etc. For example: crew must be paid at
least  the  minimum  wage  required  by
applicable  laws,  contracts  should  be
written in the migrant fishers’ native lan-
guage,  and  safe  and  hygienic  working
and living environments must be provi-
ded in accordance with flag state requi-
rements.

2. Fishery Improvement Projects

 (FIPs) for Longliners

FCF  is  currently  involved  in  two  Longli-
ne FIPs: the South Pacific Albacore and
Western  and  Central  Pacific  Yellowfin
Tuna Longline FIP and the Indian Ocean
Albacore  Tuna  Longline  FIP.  Both  FIPs
cover fleets that supply tuna for Bumb-
le Bee, the first relating to albacore and
yellowfin landed in Fiji 89 and the second
to  albacore  landed  in  Mauritius.90 Both
FIPs  relate  to  three  standards  of  the
MSC:  sustainable  fish  stocks,  minimi-
zing  environmental  impact,  and  effec-
tive  fisheries  management.  Measures
proposed  in  both  FIPs  include  putting
in  place  harvest  strategies  to  help  en-
sure  the  sustainability  of  fish  stocks,
increasing  human  observer  or  electro-
nic monitoring coverage rates to 100%,
and  working  with  the  governments  of
Taiwan,  the  Solomon  Islands  and  Mau-
ritius to advocate better fisheries mana-
gement. FCF told Greenpeace that even
though  only  20%  of  the  longliners  that
FCF  sources  from  are  included  in  FIPs,
around  50%  of  tuna  that  FCF  sources
from  in  the  Pacififc  Ocean  are  already
covered.

3. Sustainability Program

FCF  proposed  their  first  Sustainability
Program  in  2016  and  have  since  mo-
dified  this  several  times.91  The  latest
(2019)  edition  responds  to  concerns
about the ecological damage caused by

Fish  Aggregation  Devices  (FADs),92  whi-
ch outlines a program for yellowfin tuna
and skipjack tuna caught by purse seine
fishing  in  the  West  and  Central  Pacific
Ocean  to  split  catches  into  those  cau-
ght with FADs and those caught without
FADs, so that tuna brands can offer con-
sumers the choice of  FAD-free tuna.

4. Social Responsibility Program

FCF  shared  with  Greenpeace  East  Asia
details about their Social ResponsibilIty
Program. According to the program,  in
2019, FCF listed 37 purse seiners and 16
longliners under this social responsibili-
ty  program,  and  these  vessels  are  sub-
ject  to  labour  audits.The  audits  include
manning  agencies,  vessel  owners’  offi-
ces, on-site labour checks when the ves-
sels  come  back  to  port,  and  interviews
with the fishers. In 2019, FCF audited 10
purse seines and eight longliners under
this  program,  accounting  for  27%  and
50%  of  the  respective  genre  of  vessels
to  ensure  compliance  to  relevant  stan-
dards The audits are conducted by FCF’s
internal audit team and are based on an
internal  procedure.  Apart  from  labour
audits,  there  are  also  other  sustainab-
le  works  under  this  program,  including
capacity building with the vessel owners
for  social  responsibility  measures.  FCF
also told Greenpeace East Asia that the
company  is  aiming  to  implement  third
party  verification  for  this  social  audit
program  and  to  publish  the  quarterly
updates starting from early 2020.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

Foster a sustainable and ethical seafood industry: deter
IUU and forced labour

Combating IUU fishing and forced labour are urgent and overdue

tasks for the seafood sector and in particular for the distant water

fishing industry. As a major distant water fishing power, Taiwan bears

particular responsibility for tackling these issues. Taiwan has already

undergone a recent overhaul of its fisheries regulations, which even-

tually resulted in the withdrawal of the yellow card issued by the EU in

June 2019 under its IUU Regulation. However, the use of flags of con-

venience and transhipments at sea remain major loopholes for both

Taiwan and international fisheries bodies, making the enforcement of

fisheries  regulations  challenging.  Unfortunately,  despite  the  strong

and widely recognized relationship between IUU fishing and forced

labour, Taiwan has largely overlooked the rights of migrant fishers as

it reformed its fisheries policies. Migrant fishers are still discriminated

against  by  the  two-tiered  recruitment  system  and  remain  at  risk  of

abuse and forced labour on board Taiwanese fishing vessels. The lack

of a policy to effectively prevent forced labour on Taiwanese fishing

vessels is a blind spot in Taiwan’s policy reform, and a flaw in the go-

vernment’s efforts to curb IUU fishing.

This failure to tackle forced labour in the industry is troubling. Given

FCF’s extended global reach, tainted seafood might soon spread to

the  market  if  it  enters  FCF’s  supply  chain.  FCF  along  with  other  se-

that these are put into effect, Greenpeace East Asia advocates

that companies should support legally binding agreements with

labour unions.

•  Upgrade its sustainability policy: FCF should make good use

of its influence in the industry to advocate for higher social and

environmental  standards,  and  more  effective  implementation

of  such  standards  by  its  business  partners,  governments,  and

other fisheries management bodies. In particular, given the dire

situation of some fish stocks, companies should support the de-

signation and implementation of large scale ocean sanctuaries

globally.

•  Establish concrete and effective action plans in line with

the above objectives: Action plans should include clear objecti-

ves and time bound milestones. Action plans must be subject to

audits undertaken by an independant, credible third party, and

such reports should be made public.

7.2 Taiwanese government should
increase protection for migrant
fishers

afood  corporations  should  take  responsibility  to  create  a  business

As one of the world’s major fishing powers, Taiwan must not let

practice that fosters a sustainable and ethical seafood industry and

down its guard or lose its momentum after the lifting of the EU

deters IUU or forced labour.

7.1 FCF should strengthen supply

chain management

As  one  of  the  top  three  tuna  traders  globally,  FCF  bears  great

responsibility to ensure fish caught illegally or with forced labour

is  prevented  from  entering  the  global  seafood  supply  chain.

Greenpeace  East  Asia  believes  that  FCF  must  undertake  the

following actions promptly, to better fulfill its responsibility:

yellow card. Taiwan must enhance its regulations to protect mi-

grant fishers and ensure they are fully implemented, if seafood

tainted with IUU fishing and forced labour is to be put to an end.

Therefore, Greenpeace East Asia reiterates the following recom-

mendations to the Taiwanese government. These recommenda-

tions  are  endorsed  by  the  Taiwan  International  Workers’  Asso-

ciation (TIWA), Taiwan International Workers’ Association (TIWA),

Yilan Migrant Fishermen Union (YMFU), The Presbyterian Church

in  Taiwan  Seamen  and  Fishermen’s  Service  Center  (PCTSFSC),

Taiwan  Association  for  Human  Rights  (TAHR),  Serve  the  People

Association (SPA), and Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF).

The European Union has one of the most advanced legislative frameworks to combat
IUU fishing. Under EU law, when the European Commission has evidence that a country
is not cooperating in the fight against IUU fishing, it can identify it as a non-cooperating
country and eventually prevent its fish products from entering the EU—one of the largest
fish markets in the world. Before a country is identified as non-cooperative, or ‘issued
a red card’, a country is first pre-identified (or ‘issued a yellow card’). In order to issue a
yellow card, the EU Commission provides an account of the reasons and then initiates a
dialogue with the flag State to solve the issues of concern and take corrective action to
avoid issuing a red card.

ILO has identified 8 fundamental conventions, covering subjects that are considered
to be fundamental principles and rights at work. These 8 fundamental conventions are
Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention (C 87), Right
to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention (C 98), Forced Labour Convention (C
29), Abolition of Forced Labour Convention (C 105), Minimum Age convention (C 138),
Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention ( C182), Equal Remuneration Convention (C
100), and Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention (C 111).

44.

Under C111, migrant workers as workers are protected against discrimination in
employment/occupation based on the seven grounds set out there (including race,
colour, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin, and sex) . While
nationality/immigration status is not one of the seven grounds, the ILO Committee of
Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has interpreted C111
to protect migrant workers from discrimination on the basis of race, one of the seven
grounds in the Convention.

It’s important to note that according to ILO, for a case to be considered “forced labour”,
there must be a combination of two mandatory elements, namely, “involuntariness”,
and “menace of penalty”. The 11 indicators of forced labour all fall under the “menace of
penalty” element, except for “deception”, “excessive overtime”, and "abusive working and
living conditions” which fall under the “involuntariness” element. If a case only exhibits
one element, either “involuntariness” or “menace of penalty”, then it is considered a
forced labour “risk”, not conclusive forced labour.

48.

According to ILO’s General Principles and Operational Guidelines for Fair Recruitment and
Definition of Recruitment Fees and Related Costs,  recruitment fees or any related costs
should not be collected from the workers by the employers, or labour recruiters. Among
the four fishers interviewed, fishers working on Longliner A and Lonlinger B claimed that
a sum of recruitment fee was deducted from their salaries. Given the absence of debt
manipulation, Greenpeace East Asia in this report lists the collection of recruitment fees
as "withholding of wages.”

49.

According to the correspondence between Greenpeace and the ILO, “debt bondage”
occurs when (1) a job or recruitment is associated with loans, advance or debt; (2) the
debt is manipulated; and (3) this limits the freedom of the workers in any way. Among
the four fishers interviewed, the contract of a fisher working on Longliner A specified that
a guarantee deposit would be deducted from his salary for 6 months, while the other
three fishers all claimed that guarantee deposits were collected from them. The fishers
were promised (in contract or verbally) that their guarantee deposits would be returned
in full if they finished their contracts. However, in reality, the guarantee deposits are a
form of economic coercion and should be considered debt bondage in line with the ILO
definition of the practice. The guarantee deposit as debt was technically paid off through
deductions in the first several months of work, but the promise of a complete cancellation
of the original debt was a form of manipulation to keep the fishers working for the full
term of their contract, often under inhumane conditions, in hopes of negating the large
debt they incurred for their jobs. The deposits ultimately bound the fishers to the vessel
owners for around 2 years of excessive working hours, and total payment below the
monthly minimum wage despite working so much that the value of their labour exceeded
the amount of their original debt.

According to the UN,  human rights due diligence is a way for enterprises to address
potential human rights abuses. It involves four core components: (1) identifying and
assessing actual or potential adverse human rights impacts (2) integrating findings
from impact assessments across relevant company processes, and taking appropriate
actions (3) tracking the effectiveness of measures (4) communicating on how impacts
are being addressed. Retrieved from https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/Pages/

Tuna and other fish  naturally school around floating objects. In order to increase tuna
catches, some fishing vessels deploy permanent, half-permanent or temporary floating
objects on the ocean to gather fish. Commonly seen drifting logs and carcasses of large
marine animals naturally act as FADs. Artificial FADs include anchored FADs and drifting
FADs. Anchored FADs need to be attached to the bottom of the sea and thus are more
commonly used closer to shore. On the other hand, drifting FADs are usually used in the
open ocean. The unchecked proliferation of FADs in recent years has greatly increased
catches, particularly of juvenile tunas, and has led to overfishing and reduced yields.
Currently, over half of the tuna caught globally are caught with FADs. According to https://
