1.  BACKGROUND

The concept of Endangered Forests emerged out of concern over the continuing loss of critical
forest ecological values, which has resulted from an increasing array and intensity of stressors
throughout the world.  Endangered Forests are native forests of high ecological value that require
protection from intensive industrial use to maintain these values.

Note that the use of the word “endangered” should not be confused with the U.S. Endangered
Species Act (ESA), where the term carries a particular connotation.  Under the legal definition of
the ESA, endangered means that a species is at risk of becoming extinct—or of ceasing to exist
altogether.  Not all Endangered Forests are necessarily facing imminent extinction; however, due
to the threats posed by one or more stressors (climate change, industrial use, urbanization, etc.),
they are in danger of loosing their ability to function as complete and intact, natural ecological
communities, and thereby to continue supporting numerous species and essential ecological
processes.  Vulnerable forests of high ecological value that require protection to maintain these
values are what characterize Endangered Forests.

2.  INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE

Consumers and corporations that buy and sell forest products have a growing interest in
achieving ecologically sustainable consumption and procurement.  Ecological sustainability is
defined in this document as, “the capacity of ecosystems to maintain their essential processes and
functions and to retain their biodiversity without impoverishment.”1  In the face of the many,
growing stressors being placed on the world’s forests (highlighted later in this document), the
likelihood of reaching this fundamentally important goal will require multiple strategies and
approaches that will rely on productive interactions among governments, businesses, and
consumers.

No single conservation strategy (e.g., creating forest reserves or certified forests) can meet the
complex set of challenges facing the world’s forests.  Some benefits afforded by native forests
require protecting large, relatively pristine tracts, with little or no human intervention, whereas
others may require well-planned human intervention, such as reinstating natural disturbance
regimes or eradicating invasive exotic species.  Sustaining ecological functions and values for
the worlds Endangered Forests will require multi-scale prescriptions that include additional
protection, improved forest management, and restoration.2

It is important to emphasize that there remain significant forest areas around the world that
require protection from intensive industrial use if they are to maintain their ecological values.
These forests are the “Endangered Forests.”

Many companies have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, polices promoting preservation
or special management of ecologically significant forests, but they need direction from scientists
on defensible methods for defining and mapping such forests.  The Endangered Forest concept is
specifically intended to provide this scientific underpinning with a focus on ecological
sustainability.

Ecological sustainability is different from but not incompatible with sustainable forest
management, which attempts to simultaneously sustain a full range of economic, societal, and
environmental values.3  Thus, whereas ecological sustainability focuses heavily on sustaining the
natural ecological values of forests, sustainable forest management may seek to sustain certain
(perhaps lower) levels of ecological values while also managing for economic (e.g., sustained
timber production), recreational, or other goals.  The concept of sustainable forest management
has grown in popularity at the intergovernmental level.  For example, the Montréal Process for
Criteria and Indicators was created in 1994 with the mission of providing policy makers with
information about temperate and boreal forests in support of sustainable forest management.
This international effort includes 12 signatory nations that account for 90 percent of the world's
temperate and boreal forests in the northern and southern hemispheres and approximately 60
percent of all of the world’s forests.4

Advocates of the Endangered Forest concept fully recognize the role of these and other
sustainable forest management efforts.  However, they emphasize sustaining ecological values,
which have historically been compromised in favor of economic and social values in forest
management decisions.

3.  STATUS AND IMPORTANCE OF FORESTS

Forests cover approximately 3.9 billion hectares or 30 percent of the earth’s land surface. This is
about half the amount of forested land that was present at the dawn of agriculture roughly 10,000
years ago.5  Only about a fifth of the world’s original forest cover remains in relatively large,
undisturbed tracts, with 70 percent of these remaining “intact forests” found in three countries –
Russia, Canada, and Brazil.6  Much of the world’s forests are no longer in their original
condition, having changed in composition, structure, and function to varying degrees.  Fifty-six
percent of the world’s forests are tropical/subtropical, 44 percent are temperate/boreal, and

approximately 5 percent of the world’s forests are currently classified as plantations.7  In spite of
the many changes that have occurred within them, the world’s natural forests remain critical to
the overall ecological health of our planet; they contain over half of the world’s biodiversity,
making them the richest of all terrestrial systems.8

Forests provide a wide range of socioeconomic and ecological benefits (or ecosystem services).
The Millennium Assessment (2005) identified four basic categories of ecosystem services: (1)
supporting, (2) provisioning, (3) regulating, and (4) cultural (Figure 1).9  Supporting services
provided by forests such as producing oxygen, rebuilding soils, and cycling nutrients make
possible all of the other services.

Under provisioning services, forests provide medicines, food, fuel, and a wide array of wood and
other products including building materials and paper products.  Because of the direct link to
local and global economics, more attention has been paid to this class of service than any other.
Human use of forests for obtaining provisions varies markedly among cultures and countries
around the world.  For example, developed countries produce and consume approximately 70
percent of the world’s total value-added wood products (lumber, plywood and veneer, and
pulpwood) while developing countries consume roughly 90 percent of the world’s fuelwood and
charcoal, with the total volume of fuelwood and charcoal slightly exceeding that of industrial
roundwood.   Global consumption of wood products is approximately 3.3 billion cubic meters
per year and rising, and the average consumption rate is 0.55 cubic meters per person per year.
Per capita wood use in most developed countries is much higher (e.g., 2.1 cubic meters per
person per year in the U.S.).10  Demand for fuelwood and charcoal is expected to increase at a
rate of approximately 1.1 percent per year between 1999 and 2010 while the demand for
industrial roundwood is expected to increase at a rate of 1.7 percent per year over this same
period.11  World demand for paper and paperboard is forecast to grow from the current 300
million tons to over 420 million tons by the year 2010 or an average growth rate of 2.8% per
year.12

Forests also provide many essential regulatory services, which, although less obvious to most
citizens, have the greatest overall impact on human well-being13.  Until recently, these essential
services have been largely regarded as “intangible benefits” or “economic externalities”14 even
though their combined value has been estimated to exceed US$4.7 trillion – or about 10 percent
of the gross world product.15  Among their many regulatory services, forests moderate water
flow into rivers and streams; prevent erosion; and filter and purify water.16  They regulate local
temperature, moisture, and weather conditions17 and serve as a major regulator of global climate.
Forests remove the primary greenhouse gas (CO2) from the atmosphere and exude oxygen.  In
fact, forests systems including soils hold about 62–78 percent of the world’s terrestrial biospheric
carbon, more than any other ecosystem.18

Forests provide numerous cultural values that cannot be quantified but whose impacts are
immense.  Forests have frequently played a major role in shaping human societies since the

origin of man.  Based on existing data, approximately 2/3 of the known ethnolinguistic centers
originated in temperate and tropical forest biomes.  Many peoples remain strongly linked to the
ecosystem services provided by forests, and forests remain firmly integrated into their
economies, religions, values, beliefs, and rituals.  For many people living in industrialized
nations, personal links to forests has been severed to varying degrees, but the almost innate love
for forests remains.

4.  THREATS TO FORESTS

Threats to native forests are severe and growing.  From the onset of the Industrial Revolution,
forests have undergone dramatic and widespread changes.  Over the past 50 years, humans have
changed natural ecosystems (including forests) faster than in any other period in human history.19
Driving many of these threats is a growing human population, which is currently over 6 billion
and doubling every three to four decades.  The human population is expected to nearly stabilize
at just over 10 billion by 2200.20  Based on today’s consumption rates, demand for wood
products alone would increase from 3.3 billion cubic meters per year today to 5.2 million cubic
meters per year by 2050.21  However, this does not take into account the spread of technology
and the concomitant increase in resource consumption, which is currently doubling every decade
or two.  The combined effect of human population growth and increased per-capita resource use
amplifies environmental impacts.22

Forests must contend with both deterministic (or direct) impacts (e.g., logging, road building,
and mining) as well as stochastic ones (e.g., wildfire and disease).  Direct impacts are significant
and expected to increase over time as the human population grows and demand for forest
products swells.  Managing and monitoring forests under the best of conditions is becoming
increasingly challenging, and made far more difficult by the large levels of illegal logging in
some parts of the world.   Illegal logging is also an increasing threat to forests worldwide,
especially in Indonesia where the government estimates that as much as 90% of the country’s
timber production is unlawful.23

Numerous studies demonstrate synergistic effects from multiple stressors acting concurrently on
forests.  The combined effects of factors such as logging, fire, insect pests, livestock grazing, and
invasive alien species have had profound and often unpredictable negative consequences in many
native forests.24  Furthermore, it may take decades for a species to disappear from a landscape
after a point of no return has been surpassed by multiple (sometimes compounding) stresses.

The leading threats to biodiversity, which E.O. Wilson terms the “mindless horsemen of the
environmental apocalypse,” are habitat destruction, alien invasive species, overexploitation, and
exotic disease.25  Some would add pollution as a fifth horseman26, and climate change could soon
equal or surpass habitat destruction as the leading cause of species endangerment.  The
Millennium Assessment created a matrix showing levels of impact from five major drivers of
biodiversity decline for three major forest biomes (Table 1).

Habitat Destruction

The Millennium Assessment reports that habitat destruction remains the leading immediate
threat to the world’s forest biodiversity, particularly in tropical and boreal forests, which were
many of the same regions reported as having high levels of “frontier forests” as reported by
Bryant et al. (1997) including the Northern Amazon Basin and Guyana Shield, Canadian and
Russian boreal regions, Indonesia, and Central Africa.28  Further support for this assertion in
provided by the most recent global FAO Forest Assessment that reports global forest cover was
reduced by 2.2 percent between 1990 and 2000, with the most significant changes occurring in
Africa (-7.8%), South America (-4.1%), and Oceania (-1.8%).  Europe was the only region in the
world that posted forest area gains (+0.8%) during this time period.29  However, it is important to

point out that measuring changes in forest cover is difficult due to the lack of direct measurement
and complexity of using remote sensing in global monitoring.  In fact, independent studies in
Indonesia and Brazil suggest that FAO results tend to underestimate actual forest loss.30

Deforestation is expected to continue in many of the same regions that posted losses over the last
decade.  However, there is more to habitat destruction than conversion, and much more forested
land is impacted each year than can be effectively monitored by global or national assessments.
Even in regions where total forest area is increasing or stable, forest health is being degraded by
various impacts that operate at regional and local scales, such as (1) reduction or elimination of
old growth seral stages; (2) changes in natural forest composition; (3) conversion of native forest
to plantation forests; (4) livestock grazing; (5) damage to soil fertility; (6) road building; (7)
forest fragmentation; and (8) alteration of natural disturbance regimes.

Plantation forestry is a particularly challenging topic, for it can be both a threat and a partial
solution to the forest biodiversity crisis.  If applied carefully, plantations can help alleviate
pressures on the remaining native forests, because they can produce more wood faster and on
less land.  In 2000, five percent of the world’s forests were classified as plantations, but they
produced 35 percent of the roundwood volume; and this proportion is expected to increase to 44
percent by 2020.31  However, many of the best locations for plantations also contain many native
forest biodiversity values.  Where native forests are replaced by plantation forests (especially
ones planted with exotic trees), native biodiversity can be severely compromised or lost
altogether.32

Plantation forestry has a long history in Europe, from where it has spread to other regions with
increasing demand for wood.  In the southeastern U.S., plantation acreage grew from one percent
of timbered area in 1952 to 48 percent in 199933; and plantations have expanded rapidly
throughout portions of Chile.34  An increase in plantation forestry is expected to continue
particularly in locations where yields can be kept high and production costs low.35

Alien Species Invasion

Invasion by alien species is second only to habitat destruction in detrimental effects on
biodiversity.36  Alien invasions tend to be surreptitious, mildly to extremely disruptive to native
species and ecosystem processes, and occasionally are ecologically transforming.37  Sometimes

the introduction of alien species are introduced intentionally (for example, exotic tree plantations
or introduced game animals), but more frequently alien species are introduced by accident.  The
risk of introducing alien invasive species has grown recent response to market globalization and
increased international trade.

Alien tree diseases and pests have been particularly disruptive, causing widespread damage to
regional forest industries and ecological integrity.  For example, the American chestnut once
accounted for a quarter of the standing timber in eastern North America, and it became the most
popular commercial species in the region by the mid-1880s.  Ecologically, the American
chestnut was a dominant component of the eastern deciduous forest ecosystem upon which many
other species depended.  In 1904, the New York Zoological Park imported Asian chestnut in the
hope of crossbreeding American and Asian forms to produce a tree that provided high-quality
timber and large nuts.  Unfortunately, the Asian chestnut specimens contained fungus blight to
which the American form had no resistance.  Within 50 years, the American chestnut was
effectively eliminated from eastern North America.38

Stressors of forested ecosystems often operate in powerful synergistic ways, reducing our ability
to predict the types and magnitude of changes that may occur.  For example, habitat disturbance
makes forests more susceptible to alien invasions39, and invading species in turn can alter
natural disturbance regimes, thus increasing alien invasion rates even more in a positive
feedback loop.40  These kinds of interactions can lead to substantial ecological changes with
fundamental shifts in ecological processes and losses to native species.41

Climate Change

Of all the identified drivers of forest biodiversity loss, climate change has the potential to
become the leading agent in the coming decades, although its effects remain difficult to predict.
Since 1900, the burning of fossil fuels has contributed the most to atmospheric green house
gases, although clearing and burning of tropical forests accounts for between 20-25% of
anthropogenic greenhouse gases released each year.42  Forests act in concert with climate –
influencing it while at the same time being impacted by it.  Prior to 1900, deforestation was the
dominant source of increased atmospheric CO2 (the dominant greenhouse gas).  Since then, the
burning of fossil fuels has contributed most to greenhouse gases, although harvesting of forests
still accounts for 25 percent of released atmospheric CO2 each year.43  When large areas are left
undisturbed and forest growth exceeds harvest, forests can reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere
and therefore are important tools for slowing global climate change.  Unfortunately, the capacity

of the world’s forests to maintain native composition, structure, and function (including their
capacity to sequester carbon) is being increasingly compromised by the multitude of stressors
they face.

Predictions concerning the types and severity of changes expected in forest ecosystem
composition, structure, and function vary by forest biome and regional history.44  Most of the
world’s forests are expected to experience some level of disturbance due to the changing climate,
posing a serious threat to global forest biodiversity45, forest-based economies, and ecosystem
services.  A growing body of scientific literature indicates that climate changes is already
affecting forests by shifting species ranges, fostering pests and pathogens, altering fire
disturbance regimes, changing migration patterns, and causing species extinctions.  Northern
latitude and mountain forest systems are showing the greatest changes.  For example, in the
Canadian boreal, increased fire frequency and intensity has been reported46 while climate change
is being postulated as the primary cause of some amphibian extinctions in tropical cloud
forests.47

Recent research also demonstrates a time lag between increasing greenhouse gas concentrations
and measurable climate change and associated impacts.  This means that even if greenhouse gas
concentrations are stabilized, global warming will continue into the future, with even greater
changes in the future than those we have already observed.48  This argues for a rapid and
significant response to reducing greenhouse gasses – and forest conservation plays a role in this
response.

It is important to evaluate cumulative effects of all stressors acting together in Endangered
Forests.  This will help in prioritizing which forest areas require the most immediate mapping
and protection.  Understanding cumulative and synergistic threats is also essential to designing
management prescriptions to counter adverse effects.

5.  ECOLOGICAL COMPONENTS OF ENDANGERED FORESTS

Ecological components used to define Endangered Forests were derived from key ecological
components identified by science-based reserve-design efforts,49 and are based on an evolving
discussion among environmentalists, corporations, and scientists.50  The components include:

Landscape Integrity Components

1)  Intact forest landscapes

There is no place on Earth not affected by modern humans51, but some regions have been more
directly and severely impacted than others.  We know that natural forest landscapes lose
components and functionality as human uses expand and continue over time.  Some ecosystem
changes can be quite gradual (e.g., loss of interior forest habitat over time) while others are
punctuated (e.g., loss of a keystone species).  Intactness is not a binary (yes/no) quality, but
actually one of degree.  One can envision a continuum of intactness from a totally pristine
environment on one end to a totally developed environment on the other.  Quantifiable and
replicable indices and scales of measurement are needed to score landscapes on this continuum.
Although significant progress is being made,52 this area of applied research remains quite young.
Nevertheless, although ranking forest landscapes by their relative intactness may be imperfect, it
need not be arbitrary.  And despite imperfect knowledge, rating forest intactness remains a
conservation imperative.

An intact forest landscape does not necessarily consist of old trees and may not even be entirely
forested. Simply stated, intact forest landscapes are contiguous mosaics of natural habitat types
(forest and non-forest alike) in forest-dominated ecoregions that have either never been
subjected to industrial human activities or have sufficiently recovered from such activities in the

relatively complete. In some localities (e.g., portions of Canada, Russia, Amazonia, Central
Africa, Indonesia, and the U.S.), these are the remaining frontier forests as defined and mapped
at a very coarse level by Bryant et al. in 1997 (Appendix B, MAP 1).53 In other localities, these
are forest landscapes that have recovered from previous human disturbance to the point where
they possess many if not most of their original forest characteristics (e.g., portions of the eastern
U.S. and Canada, eastern Europe, and portions of Asia). It is important to note that these forests
are not static.  On the contrary, an ecosystem with a high level of intactness is one that is able to
maintain its biodiversity and ecosystem functionality over time – not in any fixed, quantitative
sense, but rather as a dynamic property.54

To a large extent, many of the compositional (e.g., types of species present) and structural (e.g.,
size of trees and complexity of forest canopy) components of forest landscapes are size-
independent.  However, home range needs for some animal species – forests are more than a
collection of trees – and many ecological processes (e.g., natural regeneration, natural
disturbance, nutrient cycling, predator-prey interactions, and migration and dispersal) require
considerable areal extents to operate within their natural range of variability.  Therefore, the
definition of intact forests landscapes requires a reference to some minimum size.  But how large
do forest landscapes have to be to be considered intact?

Ecologically, there are two main determinants to help answer this question – (1) natural
disturbance regimes and (2) area requirements for large home range species.  Operationally, the
interaction of these two criteria should dictate any minimum size threshold. Unfortunately from a
mapping standpoint, both are difficult to rely on for determining absolute size thresholds and
both criteria vary greatly from forest type to forest type.  The best we can do with available data
is to establish threshold estimates based on our current knowledge of these two important
ecologically-based considerations for the various forest systems being mapped.

Natural disturbance regimes

If we consider the first criterion – natural disturbance regimes – we can illustrate how different
forest systems require different areal extents in order to accommodate the dominant natural
disturbance agent(s) for that forest type.  The objective is not to determine the minimum size a
single forest landscape must be to accommodate every conceivable natural disturbance event;
rather, it is to establish a size threshold for mapping purposes that reasonably reflects the scale of
the dominant disturbance agent.  For example, fire is the primary natural disturbance agent in
boreal forest systems that can impact very large areas.  Based on the available data on fires for
boreal Alaska and Canada over the last decade, the minimum dynamic area using one proposed
technique would be approximately 30,000 ha. 55  However, under extreme weather conditions,
fires in the boreal can cover 100,000 - 200,000 ha, and occasionally over 1 million ha, in a single
event.  How an area naturally recovers after fire depends upon the survival of individual trees

and small patches (sometimes referred to as legacies),56 and on the recolonization of species and
individuals destroyed by the fire from adjacent undisturbed sites.  The area necessary to ensure
survival or recolonization of disturbed sites has been termed minimum dynamic area.57

The minimum dynamic area for many boreal forests is obviously quite large, which in part is
what led Global Forest Watch to choose 50,000 ha as the minimum size threshold for intactness
in boreal forests, which allowed for the consistent mapping of intact forest landscapes for the
entire boreal zone (Appendix B, MAP 2).58

Catastrophic windthrow (large scale wind damage), especially in wind prone aspects, is a major
disturbance agent in coastal temperate rainforests such as in Southeast Alaska and coastal British
Columbia, where a single event can impact hundreds of hectares.59  A reasonable minimum size
threshold for these systems might be 5,000 ha, which is the threshold Global Forest Watch has
used in Chile, Alaska, and draft maps of intact forests in British Columbia (which were created
using satellite images and ancillary data).

In many deciduous forests around the world, phase gap dynamics (the loss of individual trees or
small clusters of trees from wind or ice) is the most important natural disturbance regime; phase
gap dynamics impact approximately one percent of the forest canopy per year in deciduous
forests in the United States.60  Based on phase gap dynamics, a reasonable minimum size
threshold for these systems might be 500 ha.

Home range

The second forest intactness threshold consideration is the area required to maintain viable
populations of large home range forest species.  As with natural disturbances, the objective is
not to determine the size a single forest landscape has to be to maintain an entire viable
population of a given species in this case, but rather to determine a meaningful forest landscape
size that provides functional habitat blocks for the particular species being evaluated.  In some
instances, these areal estimates will fall below the areal estimates for natural disturbance.  In
other cases, the minimum size of intact forest landscapes will need to be adapted to account for
this additional information.  For example, a reasonable minimum size threshold for some eastern
deciduous forest types is 500 ha. However, if one considers the area requirements for the forest

species with the largest area needs (e.g., black bear), increasing the size threshold may be
warranted.  In the case of the black bear, a large territorial mammal that occurs in some eastern
North American forests, home ranges differ considerably based on various environmental factors
such as food productivity, den site availability, and the abundance of escape habitat.  Home
range needs for black bears range from 1,000 - 5,000 ha for females with young and from 4,500 -
40,000 ha for males who wander more regularly in search for mates.61  In high productivity and
biodiversity-rich areas (i.e., some parts of the southeastern US), forest intactness thresholds
should be increased from 500 ha to 1,000 - 2,000 ha.

Geographically isolated forests

Under some circumstances, forest landscapes are naturally isolated and are smaller than the
minimum size threshold estimates for mapping intact forest landscapes.  These relatively small
actual islands or habitat islands should be identified as intact forests if they are undisturbed by
industrial activity.  In southeast Alaska, for example, there are over 27,000 forested islands
smaller than 500 ha most of which have never been impacted by industrial use.  Individually they
are small, but collectively they cover over 60,000 ha.

In general, intact forest landscapes should be large enough to act as coarse-filter habitat anchors
for species that require large home ranges and should also be large enough to recover from
natural disturbance events without losing their natural resilience.  In parts of the world where
there is not a clear set of size thresholds for the different forest systems, the most pragmatic and
useful approach would be to first map the best remaining examples of the relatively large intact
forest landscapes for each forest ecoregion and then to map smaller forest landscape units.  This
should be done on an ecoregional basis since ecoregions are widely believed to be the most
ecologically useful organizing unit for conservation purposes.62

Intact forest landscapes form the primary nuclei for maintaining the remaining biodiversity and
natural processes in forest landscapes around the world, which in turn, provide extremely
important ecosystem services to human societies as outlined earlier in this document.  Some of
the services operate at global scales (e.g., intact forests are extremely important for regulating
global carbon); others operate at regional scales (e.g., intact forests help regulate regional
climate); and still others operate at local scales (e.g., intact forests protect local drinking water
supplies and stabilize hillsides).  Intact areas form one of the most critical components in
developing a global framework for ecological sustainability as they form the foundation for
regional forest conservation plans.  As the world’s human population continues to climb along
with a simultaneous increase in overall consumption, intact forest landscapes are becoming
increasingly rare at the global level.

Examining ecological components at multiple spatial scales is an extremely important aspect of
identifying and mapping Endangered Forests.  Forest management occurs at the forest
management unit level, so there is a natural tendency to consider only a particular forest

management unit when addressing Endangered Forests.  However, without adequate perspective
from global, regional, and subregional spatial scales, it is virtually impossible to evaluate
ecological components properly, establish meaningful ecological thresholds, and maintain
consistency and replicability.  Only by considering multiple spatial scales in relation to the
different ecological components can these be achieved (Figure 3).  For example, in ecoregions
with few remaining intact forest landscapes (e.g., southern boreal ecoregions of Canada), most
remaining intact forest landscapes should be identified as Endangered Forests and targeted for
strict protection within a regional conservation framework.  In ecoregions dominated by intact
forest landscapes (e.g., northern boreal ecoregions of Canada), not every intact polygon should
be identified as an Endangered Forest based on the criterion of intactness alone.  By working
through the other ecological components reviewed in this document, a subset would be identified
based on their collective value.  Under these circumstances, the precautionary principle would
be followed until the remaining values were adequately evaluated.  At the conclusion of the
assessment, some of the intact forest landscapes would be open for some industrial use provided
that the maintenance of ecological integrity remains an overriding guiding principle and that
compliance to this end is supported by ongoing monitoring results.

2)  Remnant forests and restoration cores

Remnant forests and restoration cores (or remnant blocks) are the remaining forest landscapes
that are globally, ecoregionally, or locally rare as a result of historic and current human activities.
It is important to evaluate these remaining forest landscape blocks in all ecoregions, but it is
particularly important in those ecoregions that are the most heavily altered by industrial human
activities.  In some regions of the world, these are the only remaining patches of forest upon

14

which to build a regional forest conservation strategy.  Some remnant forests are comprised
primarily of native species (relatively intact but small in area), in which case they may be highly
prized for protection.  More often, these forest landscapes have experienced some losses to their
overall natural quality and will require some restoration activities to improve their biological
value to the region.

At the global level, heavily altered and degraded regions include: Atlantic Forests of South
America, Southeastern Mixed and Coniferous Forests of the U.S., Redwood Forests of the U.S.,
Lowland Tropical Rainforests of Indonesia, and Tropical Dry Forests of Thailand and Costa
Rica.  Data on remnant blocks in these areas at the regional and local levels is scattered but
important to collect.  For example, roadless forest blocks have been mapped for some regions in
the United States (e.g., National Forests), but much more work is necessary in many parts of the
world.

Once identified and mapped on an ecoregion-by-ecoregion basis, potential remnant blocks
should be included as another important building block in Endangered Forest mapping efforts.
And as with intact forest landscapes, assessing which blocks would be identified as Endangered
Forests will require a solid understanding of their collective values as well as their regional
context and history.  In regions where there are few or even no remaining intact blocks, remnant
blocks become more important, but that does not mean that all remnant blocks would
automatically be classified as an Endangered Forest.  In ecoregions where remnant blocks are
rare, it may be that all of them would be identified as Endangered Forests, but in most areas only
the remnant blocks that either possessed the highest conservation value or potential for
successful restoration would be designated as such.

3)  Landscape connectivity

Overall, habitat loss and fragmentation is considered to be the most important factor leading to
the loss of native species (especially in forested landscapes), and to be one of the primary causes
of the present extinction crisis.63  Habitat fragmentation is generally defined as the process of
subdividing a continuous habitat type into smaller patches, which results in the loss of original
habitat, a reduction in patch size, and the increasing isolation of patches.64  Depending on the
severity of the fragmentation process and on the sensitivity of the ecosystems affected, native
plants and animals and many natural ecosystem processes (e.g., nutrient cycling, pollination,
predator-prey interactions, and natural disturbance regimes) are compromised or fundamentally
altered.  For many plant and animal species, migration between suitable habitat patches becomes
more difficult, leading to smaller population sizes, decreased gene flow, and possible local
extinctions.65

Declines in forest species as a result of fragmentation have been documented for numerous taxa
including neotropical migrant songbirds,66 small mammals,67 and invertebrates.68  Forest
fragmentation has also been closely associated with increased susceptibility to exotic invasion.69

To counter the negative effects of forest fragmentation, promoting functional connectivity
between existing cores of native habitat is fundamentally important.  This can be achieved in the
form of actual landscape linkages (narrow bands of native forest habitat between existing
protected areas or other core natural habitats) or by planning for an effective level of landscape
permeability.  Both of these methods should target area- and habitat-sensitive species.
Landscape level connectivity is also important for maintaining broader scale ecological
processes (e.g., aquatic-terrestrial interaction, natural plant and animal dispersal, predator-prey
interactions, and species migration), and to the degree possible, regional planning should strive
to identify important locations where these processes can be supported.

Biodiversity Components

Certain forests worldwide are recognized as containing globally, regionally, or locally significant
biodiversity values.  Biodiversity components that can be mapped include: rare forest types,
species rich forests, forests containing high concentrations of rare and endangered species,
forests with high species endemism, core habitat for focal conservation species, and forests
exhibiting rare evolutionary phenomena.

As with the landscape level components, it is important to consider the biodiversity components
at multiple scales (i.e., global, regional, subregional, and local).  Unlike the landscape
components of Endangered Forest identification and mapping, however, biodiversity
components require additional contextual information regarding such things as representation
and population viability analyses, which are fundamental aspects of several biodiversity
components.

4) Rare forest types (composition and structure)

Rare forest types are restricted in occurrence and extent at various spatial scales.  Some forest
types are naturally rare due to somewhat unusual and spatially restricted combinations of
climate, topography, geology, soils, and other ecological factors.  At the global scale, commonly
cited examples of rare major forest types include Mediterranean climate forests (five regions
worldwide), temperate rainforests (seven regions worldwide), Madagascar forests, and island
forests (e.g., Hawaii, New Guinea, and parts of Indonesia).  These forest regions are
comparatively rare to other major forest types found around the world and many of these have
been heavily altered by industrial human activity, making sites of reasonable quality highly
valued for protection.

Under some circumstances, a forest’s particular expression (e.g., structure or age) as opposed to
its type or composition define its rarity.  For example, the redwood forests of the U.S. west coast
once covered approximately 700,000 ha.70  Some of this region has been converted to other land
cover since European settlement, but because of the commercial value of redwood, much of the
region remains as redwood forest.  Most rare in this region are high-quality (old growth)
redwood stands, which have been reduced to only four percent of their original extent.71  These
stands possess high biodiversity values that are becoming increasingly rare in this ecoregion.

Scattered within other major forest types or surrounded by other major biomes are regionally or
locally restricted forest types.  The tropical cloud forests of the Americas and the pocosin forests
of the Southeastern US are two examples.  These have always been relatively rare, but as with
the previous examples, they have been made rarer by industrial human impacts.

Another category of rare forests includes those forest types that were historically more
widespread, but have been significantly reduced and degraded by human activity over time.  For
example, the longleaf pine forests of the U.S. southeast once covered over 40 percent of the
region72 but they have been reduced to less than 2 percent of their former range.73

Regardless of the scale of rarity, forest ecosystems should be identified and mapped according to
recognized classifications.  In some parts of the world (e.g., the United States) significant
progress has been made.  The Natural Heritage Program (NatureServe) currently maintains
databases on rare plant communities.  Whether they are mapped or not, forests of particular
interest in this context include globally endangered to vulnerable communities (G1-G3) as well
national or  state endangered to vulnerable communities (N1-N3 or S1-S3).

5) Forests of high species richness (alpha and beta diversity)

Species richness is defined as “a simple measure of species diversity calculated as the total
number of species in a habitat or community.”74  Biodiversity is not distributed randomly and it
can be examined at various spatial scales.  Diversity measured within a single habitat or
community is sometimes referred to as alpha diversity.  Diversity measured among closely
associated habitats or communities, usually associated with some environmental gradient, is
termed beta diversity, and diversity over large geographic areas is termed gamma diversity.75

At the gamma diversity level, various regions of the planet have been identified as being
biodiversity hotspots.  Conservation International has highlighted 25 forested and non-forested

biodiversity hotspots (see Appendix B, MAP 3).  While such identified regions help
conservationists focus their efforts globally, the biodiversity within them is typically not
uniformly distributed.  Indeed, upon closer examination, one would discover hotspots within
hotspots.  These hotspots reflect alpha and beta diversity patterns.  This is also true of those
forest ecoregions that are not globally recognized for their species richness; there are often
concentrations of species at the subregional and local levels within most forest ecoregions that
are of particular conservation importance.

Species richness (operating at the gamma diversity level) and species endemism (discussed later
in this section) weighed heavily on World Wildlife Fund’s determination of the most outstanding
forested ecoregions.76  Of all the forest ecoregions examined (522), over half (288) were
identified as globally outstanding and under significant threat (Table 3; Appendix B, MAP 4).

Mapping forests with high species richness can be conducted in conjunction with mapping of the
three levels of diversity.  World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, and others have
adequately assessed gamma diversity from the global perspective with regions or ecoregions as
the analytical mapping unit.  Mapping areas of high species richness at the alpha and beta
diversity levels within individual forested ecoregions is more challenging but equally important.

6) Forests containing high concentrations of rare and endangered species

Endangered and threatened species are generally listed by governments and receive varying
levels of protection.  Some governments concentrate primarily on the individual species, while
some have provisions to protect not only the species themselves but also their critical habitat.
The World Conservation Union’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species is one international
source of information for globally rare and endangered species, but national and regional lists
should also be consulted.  Because of the way natural forests are impacted by human use, native
species (plant and animal) are either eliminated or significantly reduced locally and regionally

Washington, D.C.

18

before the species becomes globally rare.  The most effective conservation strategies should
emphasize policy and management actions that keep common species common and prevent rare
species from local/regional extirpation or global extinction.  Throughout most of the world’s
forests, this ecological component focuses on those sites that contain high concentrations of rare
or endangered species at the global, regional, and (under some circumstances) local levels.
Under some circumstances, a single forest species may be so rare that its presence immediately
elevates a particular forest’s status to Endangered Forest.  For example, in the neotropical forests
of Columbia and Ecuador, an intact or remnant forest block known to contain the Banded
Ground-cuckoo (Neomorphus radiolosus), a species of severely limited distribution which has
been on the IUCN Red List since 1988,77 would automatically be identified and mapped as an
Endangered Forest.

7) Forests of high endemism

Endemic species are those organisms that occur within a narrow geographic range and exist
nowhere else.78  Centers of endemism are areas where many endemic species occur together.
Species endemism is caused by geographic isolation and/or unusual habitats such as harsh
physical environments, and therefore tends to be concentrated in localized habitats.79  Because of
this localization, they are often at high risk of extinction.

Endemism can be described for entire physiographic regions.  For example, globally significant
forest ecoregions for endemism include portions of Southeastern USA, Central Chilean forests,
Indo-Burmese forests, Guinean forests of West Africa, and New Zealand forests.  Although the
global context is important, endemism is best mapped at intermediate spatial scales for the
purpose of identifying and mapping Endangered Forests.

High species endemism is often positively correlated with high species richness, but these
ecological considerations are very different and should be examined separately.

8) Core habitat for focal species (aquatic and terrestrial)

All preceding biodiversity components rely on community measures in one way or another.
Although these are extremely helpful in determining what elements need to be examined in
defining Endangered Forests, they are unable to define the appropriate quantity and distribution
of landscape elements.  Answers to these questions cannot be ascertained without considering the
life history needs of individual species, and there are simply too many species to examine all of
them efficiently.  The challenge has been to find an effective way of meeting the needs for all
species without examining each one individually.  The concept of umbrella species has been
proposed and used to address this issue.  Umbrella species are “species whose requirements for
persistence are believed to encapsulate those of an array of additional species.”80  It is widely

held by conservation scientists that for any given region one single umbrella species is
inadequate, but a small number of species is achievable and can reasonably address the quantity
and spatial configuration issues pertaining to regional conservation planning.  These “focal
species” are used to cover the breadth of forest landscapes and should include both terrestrial and
aquatic species.

In the context of Endangered Forests, it is most important to identify and map existing critical
habitat for the particular focal species chosen for each forest ecoregion.  These species may or
may not be rare and endangered.  The most important criteria for selecting focal species for the
Endangered Forest application include (1) dependence upon native forests during all or part of its
life history, and (2) sensitivity to industrial use.  Generating spatially explicit focal species
viability models is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking.  Therefore, mapping of critical
focal species habitat should be carried out with the assistance of expert opinion using available
forest habitat condition maps while predictive models are being generated.

9) Forests exhibiting rare ecological and evolutionary phenomena

In the context of Endangered Forests, rare ecological phenomena include conditions such as: (1)
the presence of intact vertebrate faunas, including all predators; (2) extraordinary concentrations
of animals (e.g., breeding and wintering habitat for mammals, birds, and butterflies); and (3)
large-scale movement areas for animals (e.g., migratory bird stopovers or established migration
routes).

Rare evolutionary phenomena include locations that display: (1) spectacular adaptive radiation
within a taxon (e.g., honeycreepers in Hawaii); (2) high concentrations of unusual or unique
higher taxa; (3) occurrences of primitive or relict communities; and (4) very high levels of beta
diversity.

In places where the expressions of ecological or evolutionary phenomena are of global
importance (e.g., Monarch butterfly wintering habitat in the forested mountains of Michoacan,
Mexico), a single phenomenon alone could warrant Endangered Forest status.  In other
situations, the determination of Endangered Forests would be less straightforward.  As with other
ecological components, not every forest block that exhibits or contains rare ecological or
evolutionary phenomena would automatically be identified as an Endangered Forest.  Seasonal
migration is an important part of the lives of many forest species (e.g., woodland caribou in
Canada81 and forest birds in Costa Rica82); however, the exact forest patches used are not
necessarily the same from year to year, making it more difficult to pinpoint the location(s) of
Endangered Forests.  In these situations it is important to ensure that an adequate proportion of
forest blocks in the proper spatial arrangement get the protection they need.

Steps for Identifying and Mapping Endangered Forests

The previous review of landscape integrity and biodiversity components of Endangered Forests
was intended to explain the major ecological considerations.  Each of the components reviewed
in this paper should be considered separately when identifying and mapping Endangered Forests,
but they also need to be integrated together in a systematic fashion.  As mentioned repeatedly
throughout this document, the presence of a single attribute (or value) can be enough to warrant
Endangered Forest status and protection, but in most cases, a combination of factors with
reference to the regional context will be required to make this determination.  To provide further
guidance, we propose the following sequence of steps in order to assemble the various
components in the identification and mapping of Endangered Forests.  In various places
(indicated below), ecoregional context and operational thresholds (based largely on ecology) are
fundamentally important and will be necessary to assure consistency and replicability of
independent efforts.  The ten proposed steps are:

1.  Map large landscape integrity building blocks – Intact Forest Landscapes [ecoregional

context and thresholds required] and Remnant Forests and Restoration Cores [ecoregional
context and thresholds required]

2.  Describe biodiversity components in a spatially explicit fashion for Intact Forest Landscapes
and Remnant Forests and Restoration Cores [ecoregional context and thresholds required]

3.  Describe the range of relative conservation value based on the outcome of steps one and two

in the context of representation [ecoregional context and thresholds required]

4.  Map potential landscape connectivity

5.  Assess threats (or stresses) to the native forests

6.  Identify and map Endangered Forests

7.  Define management prescriptions for each native forest area based on current conditions and

stressors

8.  Identify a small but ecologically meaningful set of indicators to help inform the efficacy of

Endangered Forests in their local, regional and global contexts

9.  Monitor these indicators over time

10. Adjust Endangered Forest status and/or management periodically as needed

These steps form an important foundation in a broader conservation area design process
focusing on forested landscapes that is required to adequately balance protection, resource
development, and restoration over space and time.

21

In all likelihood, a massive global mapping effort at the depth and breadth required to map
Endangered Forests will not be possible due to budget and data constraints.  We therefore
propose existing assessments and tools be used to help prioritize where to map and at what scale
to map based on considerations such as conservation value and level of threat (modified for
mapping purposes by data availability).  Using the relationship between conservation value and
level of threat to prioritize actions is not a new idea in conservation science.  Endangered Forests
identification and mapping are most important in those regions that contain conservation values
that are most irreplaceable at the global or ecoregional and most at risk of being lost (or of high
vulnerability), especially as a result of industrial use (Figure 4).83

Essentially, irreplaceability is a measure assigned to an area that reflects its relative importance in
the context of a planning domain (e.g., biome, ecoregion, or site) for achieving a set of regional
conservation targets.84  Vulnerability is defined as the risk a planning unit (e.g., intact forest
landscape, remnant block, etc.) has of being transformed by extractive uses.85  Figure 4 is being
offered to help visualize the idea of priority setting, and it is important to point out that
Endangered Forests are not restricted to Zone I; Endangered Forests can occur in all zones.  We
are only suggesting a mechanism for prioritizing which regions should be addressed to help
assure important ecological values are not lost while the identification and mapping of
Endangered Forests is carried out.  The shaded area denotes the highest priority.

6.  .  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENDANGERED AND HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE FORESTS

All forests have some conservation value, but some have such outstanding ecological values that
they require full protection, while recognizing the legal and customary rights of indigenous and
traditional forest peoples86, from any intensive industrial use.87  These are Endangered Forests.
For years, conservation focused primarily on land allocation.  For forests, most attention has
been placed on the two extremes of a land allocation continuum—from protected parks or nature
reserves on the one end to plantation forests on the other. However, this protection does not
negate the full recognition and acceptance of the legal and customary rights of indigenous and
traditional forest peoples to use their land for commercial and traditional uses25 26.

According to the United Nations Environment Program, approximately 8 percent of the world’s
forests are in some form of legal protection.88  Unfortunately, these protected areas do not cover
the full range of forest types or characteristics— or the most productive sites.  In many countries,
large protected areas mostly represent “the lands nobody wanted.”89 For example, the largest
protected areas in the U.S. and Canada are concentrated at higher elevations or in areas of low
forest productivity.90  However, many of the ecologically most important forests occur at lower

elevations and on more productive sites, in conflict with economic uses. In addition, many
protected areas are threatened by ineffective enforcement, and are in reality only “paper parks”.

Most of the world’s forests occur in the middle of the land allocation continuum:  they lack
strong, formal protections, but nevertheless support diverse ecological values along with
economic uses.  A compelling case has been made for emphasizing ecologically sustainable
management of these remaining matrix forests as essential to maintaining biodiversity.91
However, the Endangered Forests concept holds that there remains insufficient protection for
most of the world’s forests in light of the diverse threats discussed above, and that achieving
ecological sustainability will require increasing the amount of protected forest as well as
improved management of matrix forests.

The Endangered Forest concept offers a science-based approach for identifying those existing
matrix native forests that deserve protection from industrial use.  However, it is more than a
reserve selection exercise.  It examines Endangered Forests in context with other forest
conservation and management approaches, such as sustainable forest management, while
recognizing that forests of high ecological value can be protected in many different ways at
many different scales (e.g., conventional parks, native lands, and forest management plans).

The concept of Endangered Forests has been developed amidst other initiatives to define
ecologically important forests.92  The Endangered Forest concept is intended to be brand-neutral,
but is most frequently associated with High Conservation Value Forests (Principle 9) under the
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) forestry certification standard.93  High Conservation Value
Forests are forests that contain one or more High Conservation Value.  The Forest Stewardship
Council defines High Conservation Value Forests using six criteria that indicate forests with
significant biological, environmental, and social values.  The specific relationship between High
Conservation Value Forests and Endangered Forests is shown in Table 2 and Figure 2.  In
essence, Endangered Forests are those High Conservation Value Forests, or portions of them,
that are so biologically distinct, rare, or ecologically important that industrial use would be
incompatible with maintaining these values.

2) Remnant forests and restoration cores
Critical and/or intact forest fragments in heavily
converted or degraded forest ecosystems able, with
sufficient time for recovery, to become viable
forest ecosystems. These are globally, regionally,
or locally rare forests as a result of historical
human activities.

3) Landscape connectivity
Remaining natural or restorable landscape level
linkages between existing protected areas or other
core natural habitats that target area-sensitive
species and which maintain broader scale
ecological processes (e.g., aquatic-terrestrial
interaction, natural plant and animal dispersal,
predator-prey interactions, and species migration).

Biodiversity Components
4) Rare forest types (composition and structure)
5) Forests of high species richness (alpha and
beta diversity) relative to their region
6) Forests containing high concentrations of rare
and endangered species
7) Forests of high endemism
8) Core habitat for focal species (aquatic and
terrestrial)
9) Forests exhibiting rare ecological and
evolutionary phenomena

HCV3:
Forest areas that are in or contain rare, threatened
or endangered ecosystems.

HCV1:
Forest areas containing globally, regionally or
nationally significant concentrations of biodiversity
values (e.g. endemism, endangered species,
refugia).

HCV3:
Forest areas that are in or contain rare, threatened
or endangered ecosystems.

Even though Endangered Forests should be off limits to industrial development, they may still
require management – driven by conservation not economic imperatives - to protect their
ecological values.  In many cases (i.e., existing large, intact forest landscapes), little or no direct
human intervention may be necessary; however, some areas will require active management to
counter threats, such as controlling alien invaders or re-establishing natural disturbance regimes
through prescribed fire or mechanical thinning.

At this time, the Endangered Forests concept focuses on the ecological components and do not
include the aspects of High Conservation Values 4, 5 and 6 that pertain to human services.94
These forest values may be endangered and therefore the forests may be classed "Endangered
Forests", but they do not fall within the "/Ecological/ Components of Endangered Forests"
treated in this document.  Furthermore, identification of some of the important social values can
only be adequately assessed through a consultative stakeholder approach.

94 HCV4: Forest areas that provide the basic services of nature in critical situations (e.g., watershed
protection, erosion control).  HCV5: Forest areas fundamental to meeting the basic needs of local communities
(e.g., subsistence, health).  HCV6: Forest areas critical to local communities’ traditional cultural identity (areas of
cultural, ecological, economic, or religious significance identified in cooperation with such local communities).

25

Endangered Forests are identified based on ecological components discussed in the previous
section that are globally, regionally, or locally important.  These ecological components can be
landscape level features or biodiversity related.  These components sometimes overlap and at
other times are mutually exclusive.  Any one component can be enough to identify a specific
forest area as an Endangered Forest depending on the circumstance, but a full assessment of all
of the ecological components is warranted.  At this time, the most critical next step for
Endangered Forests as well as for High Conservation Value Forests is the creation of regionally
specific protocols or decision trees leading to consistent and defensible judgments for definition
and mapping purposes.  This will require a systematic application of multiscale contextual
information and the establishment of meaningful ecological thresholds.

7.  MAJOR CONSIDERATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING AND MAPPING ENDANGERED FORESTS

There are numerous overarching considerations still requiring attention in order to make the
process of identifying and mapping Endangered Forests scientifically sound and technically
operational.  Major considerations for identifying and mapping Endangered Forests include the
following:

(cid:190)  Spatially explicit data on the various components reviewed as well as other important themes
(e.g., conservation status, historic land cover, and human disturbance data) are needed to map
Endangered Forests reliably and consistently.

Conservation status in the form of designated protected areas is currently being mapped and
monitored by the World Protected Areas Database Consortium as part of the IUCN (World
Conservation Union) and United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).  While this work is
incomplete, the organizational infrastructure is in place, allowing for ongoing improvements in
completeness and accuracy.95

Historic condition mapping has been completed for some areas of the world, but remains a data
gap in others.  Historic condition mapping is important in order to understand how dramatically
humans have altered the extent, composition, and structure of forests through conversion and
use.  It provides extremely important historical context for defining appropriate conservation
targets.

Continually monitoring human impacts (especially using remote sensing technologies) within
forested ecoregions is important in defining and mapping Endangered Forests.  There are
numerous ongoing land cover change studies going on throughout the world (being conducted by
government and by the conservation NGO community) that are important for understanding not
only recent changes, but also in forecasting probable future conditions.

(cid:190)  Data themes used to identify and map Endangered Forests need to be applied at multiple
scales – i.e., global, ecoregional, and local levels.  Also, it will be important to generate results
that will successfully translate between spatial scales and extents.

The concept of Endangered Forests is multifaceted and needs to be addressed using multiple
spatial scales.  Ecoregion-based assessments are convenient and ecologically meaningful96 and
are useful for addressing and summarizing endangered forest considerations.  It is appropriate to

address multiple spatial scales starting at the ecoregion level and working down to the more
specific local level and, concurrently, to be able to integrate local level assessments (e.g., logging
concession; political jurisdiction) and to work up the spatial hierarchy.

(cid:190)  A regionally differentiated approach is needed.  Application of these definitions should
reflect the ecological and socio-cultural diversity of the systems we seek to protect while also
being unified under the same ecological and conservation biology components and principles.

(cid:190)  Global and regional map-based contextual information needs to be generated for the forested
regions of the world in order to assure scientific rigor and consistency.

(cid:190)  A number of important ecological thresholds for each forest type and region must be
determined and applied consistently.

(cid:190)  Science-based conservation planning is essential to articulating a strategy to attain ecological
sustainability of forests.

To be effective, conservation plans must account for the relationship over time and space
between forest protection, restoration, and industrial use.  It is also important to note that
effective conservation planning needs to be systematic, meaning it needs to be: (1) data-driven,
(2) target-directed, (3) efficient, (4) explicit, transparent, and repeatable, and (5) flexible.97

(cid:190)  Certification or other planning processes should not delay Endangered Forest protection and
special management.

(cid:190)  The topic of ecosystem services needs to be examined and integrated into the identification
and mapping of Endangered Forests.

The focus of this document has been on the ecological components of Endangered Forests.
However, one remaining important topic not fully addressed is that of ecosystem services.  As
described earlier in this document, ecosystem services can be categorized into four major types –
Supporting, Provisioning, Regulatory, and Cultural.  Two of these (Provisioning and Cultural)
pertain exclusively to services provided to humans by nature, and while it is important to
understand the limits to which natural systems can be pushed and still maintain these services, it
has little bearing on the identification and mapping of Endangered Forests as it is being applied
here.  The identification of forests that should be protected because of their importance in
providing services to humans can be assessed analytically to a degree, but an equally important
aspect of that determination will require significant input from many groups and individuals.

The remaining two ecosystem service categories (Supporting and Regulatory), are equally
important to both wild nature and humans, and it is primarily in these two service areas that more
work is needed to determine how they might influence the identification and mapping of
Endangered Forests.  Determining which forests are critically important in terms of ecosystem

28

functions such as nutrient regulation, local climate regulation, carbon sequestration, water
purification, and hydrologic regimes is far more challenging than the nine ecological components
presented in this document, but that does not mean these are unimportant.

8.  CONCLUSION

This document was written to describe the scientific foundation for the concept of Endangered
Forests and how it might be incorporated in identifying and mapping which of the world’s
remaining forests should be protected as part of a larger conservation strategy.

The technical planning issues surrounding this issue are numerous and complex and a measure of
regional flexibility will undoubtedly be required to make meaningful progress on the ground.
However, since global socio-economic forces are now driving the impacts on forests, it is
extremely beneficial to address the technical aspects of planning for ecological sustainability of
the world’s forests by embracing an overarching conceptual framework that clearly articulates
the ecological values that need to be actively addressed.

It is the intention of the authors this remains a “living” document, and incorporates advances in
our understanding of forests and what is required to safeguard their ecological values.
Conservation science, analytical methods, and data collection strategies are continuously
evolving and improving over time, and all advances made must be integrated as needed.  The
important outstanding question of how to practically integrate the two ecosystem service
categories described elsewhere in this document will have to be considered in future revisions.
The authors recognize the need to periodically update and revise this document in order to reflect
new information and other advances.

APPENDIX A   GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Adaptive Radiation:  the evolution of a species into many species that occupy diverse ways of
life within the same geographical range.98

Alpha/Beta/Gamma Diversity: Alpha diversity - the number of species within a single local
habitat or patch. Beta diversity - turnover of species between local habitats or patches. Gamma
diversity - large area consisting of a number of habitats or patches.99

Biodiversity Hotspots: regions that harbor a great diversity of endemic species and, at the same
time, have been significantly impacted and altered by human activities.100

Conservation Area Design: A conservation planning tool at multiple spatial scales that allows
for the creation and exploration of land management scenarios relative to the following four
goals

-Represent all native ecosystem types across their natural range of variation.
-Maintain viable populations of all native species in natural patterns of abundance and
distribution.
-Maintain ecological and evolutionary processes.
-Ensure long-term and short-term resilience to environmental change.101

Degraded Forest: forest suffering from the loss of native species and processes due to human
activities such that only certain components of the original biodiversity persist, often including
significantly altered communities.102

Ecoregion: a large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of
natural communities that (a) share a large majority of their species and ecological dynamics, (b)
share similar environmental conditions, and (c) interact ecologically in ways that are critical for
their long-term persistence.103

Ethnolinguistic Center:  geographic origins of the world’s peoples (particularly the world’s
indigenous, tribal and traditional peoples) differentiated by a unique language and culture.

configuration of habitat patches at the landscape scale, which falls into one of four categories:
area-limited species, resource -limited species, dispersal-limited species, or process-limited
species.104

Fragmentation: the breaking up of a habitat, ecosystem or landscape into smaller, disconnected
pieces.105 Although natural disturbances fragment the landscape, human activities are also agents
of fragmentation and are most important in the conservation planning context.  Agents of
fragmentation include roads, cleared lands, changes in land use, urbanization and other human
developments.

Frontier Forest: large, relatively intact forest ecosystems.  A frontier forest must – (1) be
primarily forested; (2) be large enough to support viable populations of species associated with
that forest type; (3) have its structure and composition are determined mainly by natural events;
(4) contain primarily native species; and (5) be relatively unmanaged by humans.106

Gap Dynamics: a particular type of forest disturbance that is characterized by small- or micro-
scale disturbance of the mature forest canopy.  Trees die standing, snap off, or are blown to the
ground, creating a “hole” in the canopy.  The death of a single stem or a few stems releases
available growing space.  In time, this growing space is occupied by tree regeneration.107

High Conservation Value Forest: forest identified under Principle 9 of the Forest Stewardship
Council. They are:
a) forest areas containing globally, regionally or nationally significant  concentrations of
biodiversity values (e.g. endemism, endangered species, refugia); and/or large landscape level
forests, contained within, or containing the management unit, where viable populations of most if
not all naturally occurring species exist in natural patterns of distribution and abundance
b) forest areas that are in or contain rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems
c) forest areas that provide basic services of nature in critical situations (e.g. watershed
protection, erosion control)
d) forest areas fundamental to meeting basic needs of local communities (e.g. subsistence,
health) and/or critical to local communities’ traditional cultural  identity (areas of cultural,
ecological, economic or religious significance identified in cooperation with such local
communities).108

Intact Forest Landscapes: contiguous mosaics of naturally occurring ecosystems in a forest
ecozone, essentially undisturbed by significant human influence and sufficiently large enough to
be resilient to edge effects and to survive most natural disturbance events.109

Keystone Species: a species whose presence or activities support a large number of other species
in the community (e.g., primary cavity nesters, herbivorous insects that outbreak).110

Landscape Linkage: large, regional connections between habitat blocks (“core areas”)
meant to facilitate animal movement and other essential flows between different sections
of a landscape.111 These linkages are not necessarily constricted, but are essential to maintaining
connectivity function in the ecoregion.

Minimum Dynamic Area: the area necessary to ensure survival or recolonization of disturbed
sites.112

Natural Disturbance Regime: the historic patterns (frequency and extent) of fire, insects, wind,
landslides and other natural processes in an area.

Natural (Ecological) Resilience: the amount of change a system can undergo and still remain (1)
within the same state or domain of attraction, (2) capable of self-organization, and (3) adaptable
to changing conditions.113

Precautionary Principle or Precautionary Approach: a response to uncertainty, in the face of
risks to health or the environment.  In general, it involves acting to avoid serious or irreversible
potential harm, despite lack of scientific certainty as to the likelihood, magnitude, or causation of
that harm.114

Representation:  with reference to protected areas systems, representation refers to the
protection of the full range of biodiversity of a given biogeographic unit within a system of
protected areas (Ricketts et al. 1999).115  To be ecologically effective, representation must be
achieved in all ecosystems at all ecological spatial scales.

Roadless Block: that area bounded by a road, using the edge of the physical change that creates
the road or the edge of the right-of-way, other ownership, or water, as a boundary. Minimum size
of roadless blocks in forests depends on forest type.  For example, in North America, a useful
