I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT. 
OPIC and Ex-Im  are federal agencies that provide insurance, loans, and loan guarantees for 
overseas projects or to U.S. com panies that invest in or provide products for overseas projects.  
These projects include oil and gas fields, pipelines, oil refineries and power plants that result in 
the direct, indirect, and cum ulative em ission of  billions of tons of greenhouse gases (GHG).  
Indeed, OPIC and Ex-Im  supported projects are direc tly or indirectly responsible for 8% of the 
annual world-wide GHG em issions – the equiva lent of 31.7% of annual U.S. GHG em issions.1  
Defendants acknowledge that greenhouse gas em issions m ay contribute to global warm ing, and 
that such clim ate change m ay have adverse im pacts on the dom estic environm ent.2  This action 
seeks to com pel Defendants to com ply with NEPA to analyze the significance of im pacts on the 
domestic environm ent traceable to their respective actions in support of energy projects that em it 
greenhouse gases.    
OPIC and Ex-Im  have taken specific final actions providing the basis for this lawsuit.   
Plaintiffs sent dem and letters requesting that OPIC and Ex-Im  analyze in a NEPA docum ent 
whether their respective actions to fund overseas energy projects contribute to global warm ing.

Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  12 Plaintiffs attach expert affidavits to describe the im pacts of global warm ing on the 
domestic environm ent.  See generally MacCracken Decl. Plaintiffs acknowledge that facts in 
administrative appeals such as this m atter are norm ally lim ited to those established by the 
administrative record.  Plaintiffs, however, m ay provide extra-record m aterials to establish 
standing.  See Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw , 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000);  EPIC v. Blackwell , 
2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20717 *128 (N.D. Ca. 2004) (“ Ninth Circuit case law indicates that a 
plaintiff m ay subm it a declaration on standing without it being considered im proper extra-record 
evidence.”). Plaintiffs m ay also subm it extra-record evidence to dem onstrate that an agency did 
not consider relevant factors.  See Southwest Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. United States Forest 
Serv. , 100 F.3d 1443, 1450 (9th Cir. 1996).  Plaintiffs’ declarations fit within both of these 
exceptions to the record rule.

23 In response, each agency issued a finding that  its actions, both individually (on a project-by-
project basis) and cum ulatively (as a portfolio of sim ilar projects), do not have significant 
impacts.  Each agency m ade this finding in a final report and in its reply to the Plaintiffs’ 
demand letters.  Each finding is final: in reliance, OPIC and Ex-Im  have not applied NEPA to 
their respective actions on either a portfolio-wide basis or in individual applications for energy 
projects.  However, neither agency prepared an EA to support its finding of no significant 
impact, nor did they follow required procedures, including response to public com ments and 
consultation with other federal agencies.     
OPIC and Ex-Im ’s claim s that their actions do not give rise to Plaintiffs’ standing have 
no m erit. In the face of overwhelm ing scientific evidence that their actions contribute to global 
warm ing – including record evidence that Defendants them selves have com piled – they now 
claim  that “the basic connection between hum an-induced greenhouse gas em issions and 
observed clim ate change itself has not been established.”  Defs.’ Mem . at 15.  This extrem e 
position is not supported by any scientific evidence in the record, but by the defense attorneys’ 
selected excerpts from  an extra-record report.  Based on these selected excerpts (but not the full 
report’s conclusions) they argue that Plaintiffs do not have the requisite injury for standing.  
Further, Defendants attem pt to turn the standi ng inquiry on its head by arguing that Plaintiffs’ 
standing is defeated by the grossly speculative notion of whether the injury could have occurred 
without governm ent action. The appropriate focu s of this inquiry is on the Defendants’ 
affirm ative actions, and Plaintiffs am ply dem onstrate the reasonable concern that their concrete 
interests are harm ed by Defendants’ actions.

Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  2Defendants also strain to recast Plaintiffs’ clai ms as an effort to have the Courts m icro-
manage Defendants’ discretionary adm inistration of their program s.  This “straw-m an” argum ent 

fails because Plaintiffs’ claim s, as fully supported by the adm inistrative record, challenge 
Defendants’ discrete and m andatory obligation to  com ply with NEPA.  Likewise, OPIC’s claim  
that nebulous legislative history – not express statutory language – som ehow im munizes it from  
suit is without m erit.  As expressly recognized by Ex-Im ’s own rule, Defendants m ust apply 
NEPA to assess whether their actions m ay have an im pact on the dom estic environm ent.      1

the Adm inistrative Record, Plaintiffs’ declara tions, or both.  Defendants’ Motion should be 
denied. 
II. BACKGROUND/STATUTORY FRAMEWORK. 
 
NEPA serves as our nation’s “basic national charter for protection of the environm ent.”  
40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(a).  It “declares a broad national com mitment to protecting and prom oting 
environm ental quality,” and ensures such pr otection though “im portant ‘action-forcing’ 
procedures.”  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council , 490 U.S. 332, 348-49 (1989); see 
also Anderson v. Evans , 314 F.3d 1006, 1016 (9th Cir. 2002) (“NEPA is a statute that aim s to 
prom ote environm entally sensitive governm ental decision-m aking”).  These “action-forcing” 
procedures require all federal agencies to prepare a “detailed statem ent … on the environm ental 
impact” f or every “m ajor f ederal action [  ] signif icantly af fecting the quality of  the hum an 
environm ent.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332 (2).3  All federal agencies m ust com ply with NEPA “unless 
 
3 This “detailed statem ent” m ust include, am ong other things, a discussion of: 
(i) the environm ental im pact of the proposed action,  
(ii) any adverse environm ental effects whic h cannot be avoided should the proposal be 
implem ented,  
(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,  
(iv) the relationship between local short-term  uses of m an’s environm ent and the 
maintenance and enhancem ent of long-term  productivity, and

(CEQ) issued regulations in 1978 that are binding on all federal agencies.  40 C.F.R. § 1500-
1508.  These regulations clearly define what constitutes agency action and the process for 
determ ining whether the action or program  signif icantly af fects the quality of  the hum an 
environm ent.  40 C.F.R. § 1505.1.  Under CEQ regulations, “actions” are defined to include: 
“new and continuing activities, including project s and program s entirely or partly f inanced, 
assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.18.4   
 An agency m ust prepare an EA to determ ine whether an action is likely to have 
"significant" environm ental effects.  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(b) (“[i]n determ ining whether to prepare 
an environm ental im pact statem ent the Federal agency shall  ... prepare an environm ental 
assessm ent.”) (em phasis added); 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9; Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v. BLM ,  
387 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. 2004).  An Environm ental Im pact Statem ent (EIS) m ust be prepared 
if the EA concludes that the im pact is signi ficant.  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4.  If, after the EA, the 
agency concludes that the action will not have a signif icant ef fect on the environm ent, the agency 
may issue a Finding of No Significant Im pact (FONSI) and m ay then proceed with the action. 40 
C.F.R. § 1508.13. Klamath-Siskiyou , 387 F.3d at 993.   
 An agency m ust take a “hard look” at the environm ental effects of a proposed action in 
an EA to determ ine if the action’s im pacts are significant.  Marsh v. Or. Natural Res. Council , 
490 U.S. 360, 374 (1989).  As a part of this hard look, the agency m ust consider all reasonably 
 
42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).

23 foreseeable im pacts caused by the proposed action, including, am ong other things, all 
foreseeable direct and indirect im pacts of the action.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.8, 1508.25(c); City of 
Davis v. Coleman , 521 F.2d 661, 679-80 (9th Cir. 1975).  Indeed, “NEPA does not recognize any 
distinction between prim ary and secondary effects.”  Border Power Plant Working Group v. 
DOE , 260 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1015 (S.D. Cal. 2003) (citing Methow Valley Citizens Council v. 
Regional Forester , 833 F.2d 810, 816-817 (9th Cir. 1987), rev'd on other grounds , Methow 
Valley Citizens Council , 490 U.S. 332).  
Direct im pacts are defined as those im pacts “which are caused by the action and occur at 
the sam e time and place.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(a).  Indirect im pacts, on the other hand, include 
those im pacts “which are caused by the action and are later in tim e or farther rem oved in 
distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.  Indirect effects m ay include growth inducing 
effects and other effects related to induced changes in the pattern of land use, population density 
or growth rate, and related effects on air and water and other natural system s, including 
ecosystem s.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(b). 
The agency m ust also consider the cum ulative im pacts of past, present, and reasonably 
foreseeable future actions.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.8;  Hall v. Norton , 266 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir. 
2001).  Cum ulative im pacts refer to the “im pact on the environm ent which results from  the 
increm ental im pact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
future actions regardless of what agency or person undertakes such action.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.7.

Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  5When considering whether the direct, indirect, and cum ulative im pacts of an action are 
significant, CEQ regulations require federal ag encies to evaluate both the “context” and 
“intensity” of the im pact.  The question of “context” focuses on the significance of the action in 
its particular setting, and “m eans that the significance of an action m ust be analyzed in several 

contexts such as society as a whole (hum an, nati onal), the affected region, the affected interests, 
and the locality.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27 (a).  “Intensity,” on the other hand addresses the severity 
of the action.  W ith regard to intensity, CEQ regulations require the agency to consider a range 
of relevant factors including, am ong others:  1

likely to be highly controversial;” 
 
(2) the “degree to which the possible effects on the hum an environm ent are highly 
uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks;” 
 
(3) “[w]hether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant 
but cum ulatively significant im pacts . ..;”   
 
40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.27(b)(4), (5), (7). 
In reaching a conclusion regarding the significance of an im pact, the agency m ust “[set] 
forth sufficient inform ation to enable the decision-m aker to consider fully the environm ental 
factors involved and to m ake a reasoned decision after balancing the risks of harm  to the 
environm ent against the benefits to be derived from  the proposed action.”  County of Suffolk v. 
Secretary of Interior , 562 F.2d 1368, 1375 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied 434 U.S. 1064 (1978). 
CEQ regulations expressly provide that an ag ency’s adoption of a program  or approval of 
a group of concerted actions to im plem ent a specific policy or executive directive is a m ajor 
federal action.5  For such system atic and connected, actions CEQ regulations direct each agency 
to determ ine, in com pliance with NEPA, whether such actions m ay have significant im pact on 
the hum an environm ent, and if so, prepare a program matic EIS.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.18(b).

                                           As the Ninth Circuit has previously explained, the only exception to NEPA’s requirem ent 
for preparation of an EA or an EIS is where the proposed m ajor federal action falls within a 
previously identified “categorical exclusion.”6  The Steamboaters v. FERC , 759 F.2d 1382, 1393 
(9th Cir. 1985) (“The only exception  to this requirem ent is where the proposed project ‘norm ally 
does not require either an environm ental im pact statem ent or an environm ental assessm ent. ...’”) 
(quoting 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(a)(2)) (em phasis added).  If the proposed action does not fall within 
a previously prom ulgated categorical exception, the agency must prepare an EA or an EIS.  
Steamboaters , 759 F.2d at 1393; see also  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(b) (EA required if action is not 
categorically excluded).  “An agency cannot avoid its statutory responsibilities under NEPA 
merely by asserting that an activity it wishes to pursue will have an insignif icant ef fect on the 
environm ent.”  Alaska Ctr. for the Environment v. United States Forest Service , 189 F.3d 851, 
859 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Steamboaters , 759 F.2d at 1393) .  NEPA dem ands preparation of an 
EA for this determ ination. 
 
6 An agency m ay propose categorical exclusions for certain actions that do not generally 
have a significant affect on the hum an envi ronm ent.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.4.  “Categorical 
exclusion” m eans: “a category of actions whic h do not individually or cum ulatively have a 
significant effect on the hum an environm ent and wh ich have been found to have no such effect 
in procedures adopted by a Federal agency in im plem entation of these regulations (§ 1507.3) and 
for which, therefore, neither an environm ental assessm ent nor an environm ental im pact 
statem ent is required.”  Id.  CEQ regulations require an agency to prom ulgate rules identifying 
categorical exclusions.  See 40 C.F.R § 1508.4.  Neither OPIC nor Ex-Im  have issued a 
categorical exclusion for the type of projects at issue here.

To establish Article III standing, Plaintiffs m ust show: (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, 
and (3) redressability.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw,  528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000);  Lujan 
v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  In a NEPA case, the causation and 
redressability standards are relaxed.  Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. at 573, n.7 (“The person 
who has been accorded a procedural right to protect  his concrete interests can assert that right 
without m eeting all the norm al standards for redressability and im mediacy.”); Public Citizen v. 
DOT , 316 F.3d 1002, 1006 (9th Cir. 2003) rev’d on other grounds , 541 U.S. 752 (2004); Comm. 
To Save the Rio Hondo v. Lucerno , 102 F.3d 445, 452 (10th Cir. 1996) (sam e). 
A court need only determ ine that one of the several plaintiffs has standing for this m atter 
to proceed.  Watt v. Energy Action Educ. Found ., 454 U.S. 151, 160 (1981) (“Because we find 
California [one of three plaintiffs] has standi ng, we do not consider the standing of the other 
plaintiffs.”) (citing Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp ., 429 U.S. 
252, 264, and n. 9 (1977)); Public Citizen , 316 F.3d at 1014-15 (“W e need only find that one

                                           Additionally, Courts have created a prudentia l standing requirem ent that a plaintiff’s 
interests fall within the “zone of interests” protected by the statute on which the claim  is based.  
Bennett v. Spear,  520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997).  NEPA, the statute at issue here, protects 
environm ental interests – the very interests in which the Plaintif fs are injured.    
Defendants allege that their actions, funding and insuring overseas energy projects that 
emit greenhouse gases, have not been proven to harm  the Plaintiffs’ interests in the dom estic 
environm ent, and that Plaintiffs therefore do not have standing to pursue this Com plaint.  They 
fundam entally m isconstrue the Com plaint and, as a result, the requirem ents for standing.  
Plaintiffs do not seek a rem edy to lim it em issions associated with Defendants’ actions, or to halt 
approval of energy project applications.  Plainti ffs acknowledge that, as with m ost environm ental

to som e extent. Ex-Im Bank’s Role in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change  at 29-30

OPIC and Ex-Im  each violates NEPA by not m aking that finding in a form  (EA) and through the

EA and FONSI or EIS process.   
Standing m ay properly hinge on this type of injury.  W e have determ ined that an 
environm ental plaintiff was "surely … harm ed [when agency action] precluded 
the kind of public com ment and participation NEPA requires in the EIS process," 
and that this type of  "procedural" injury is tied to a substantive "harm  to the 
environm ent"  "' the harm  consists of added risk to the environm ent that takes 
place when governm ental decisionm akers m ake up their m inds without having 
before them  an analysis (with public com ment) of the likely effects of their 
decision on the environm ent. NEPA' s object is to m inimize that risk, the risk of 
uninform ed choice. …' "  West v. Secretary of the DOT , 206 F.3d 920, 930 n.14 
(9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Sierra Club v. Marsh , 872 F.2d 497, 500 (1st Cir. 1989)).  
The sam e can be said for failure to allow any public input in the EA/FONSI 
process, which is, after all, the threshold step for determ ining whether to prepare 
an EIS in the first place.

2. Defendants’ Procedural Violations Threaten Injury to Plaintiffs’ 
Concrete Interests  
 
NEPA’s procedural obligations are designed to protect the very aesthetic, recreational 
and econom ic interests that Plaintiffs allege are injured by the Defendants’ uninform ed decision 
making.  See id.  at 971; Rio Hondo, 102 F.3d at 451-52.  In the context of NEPA the “concrete 
interest” test focuses on whether there is “a ' geographic nexus'  between the individual asserting 
the claim  and the location suffering an environm ental im pact.”  Public Citizen , 316 F.3d at 1015

“environm ental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the 
affected area and are persons ‘f or whom  the aesthetic and recreational values of  the area will be

global warm ing that is larger and m uch longer lasting than could be induced by natural 
oscillations.”  MacCracken Decl. at ¶ 15.  Furthe r, “natural influences alone cannot explain the

global warm ing im pacts in the U.S.”  Id. at ¶ 22.  In addition, “[i]t is not only the am ount of

in Fact is Without Merit 
 
In the face of overwhelm ing scientific evidence, and the Defendants’ adm ission that 
climate change is occurring and that their actions contribute to such change, the Governm ent’s 
attorneys now m ake the rem arkable post hoc  argum ent that clim ate change is speculative, and 
that Plaintiffs’ injuries are not sufficiently “im minent,” or are too conjectural to confer standing.  
Defs.’ Mem . at 11-14.  These claim s are entirely without m erit.  
It should first be noted that the Defendants cannot rely on extra-record evidence or 
rationale to defend their final actions.   See Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike Extra-Record Evidence.  
In any event, the Defendants’ claim  that “the basic connection between hum an-induced 
greenhouse gas em issions and observed clim ate change has not been established” is directly 
rebutted by their own adm inistrative record. Defs.’ Mem . at 15. OPIC, for exam ple,

presented … leads one to conclude that GHG concentr ations have indeed risen and that there is a 
reasonable likelihood that the increased concentra tions of these gases will result in increased

defeated by Defendants’ speculation in a brief on whether clim ate change is caused by natural 
variations.  Rather, Plaintiffs dem onstrate st anding upon showing that it is reasonably probable 
that clim ate change threatens their concrete interests.  Laidlaw , 528 U.S. at 184 (plaintiffs’ 
“reasonable” concern is enough for injury in fact).  Plaintiffs am ply m eet this burden.      
 The Governm ent also suggests that Plaintiffs ’ injuries are not sufficiently concrete or 
particularized to support standing because plaintiffs  have not identified injuries that threaten any

Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  2013 The Governm ent does not, and cannot, offer any record evidence to refute the scientific 
consensus that anthropom orphic GHG em issions are the dom inant force behind global warm ing.  
Instead, the Governm ent’s attorneys offer their own non-expert opinion of “uncertainty,” citing 
selected portions of an extra-record report for support of their m isplaced suggestion.  Defs.’ 
Mem . at 12 (citing National Academ y of Science/ National Research Council Report) (Defs.’ Att. 
4a).  Contrary to the Governm ent’s suggestion, the NAS study does not conclude that the 
connection between hum an-induced GHG em issions and clim ate change is uncertain.  In fact, the 
very first sentence of the report emphasizes the connection and acknowledges that effects are 
already occurring : “[g]reenhouse gases are accum ulating in the Earth’s atm osphere as a result of 
human activities, causing surface air tem peratures and subsurface ocean tem peratures to rise.  
Temperatures are, in fact, rising.”  See NAS Report at p. 1 (Defs.’ Att 4a.).  The report goes on to 
specifically note that current policy decisions --such as those within the scope of OPIC and Ex-
Im’s authority -- will affect the extent of dam age caused by global warm ing: “national policy 
decisions m ade now and in the longer-term  future will influence the extent of any dam age 
suffered by vulnerable hum an populations and ecosystem s …” Id.

specific im pacts are likely to occur.”  Defs.’ Me m. at 13.  Defendants’ argum ent that Plaintiffs 
must provide specific proof of actual environm ental harm  finds no support in Ninth Circuit case 
law.  See Ocean Advocates,  361 F.3d at 1120 (“To require actual evidence of environm ental

Furtherm ore, contrary to the Governm ent’s im plication, Plaintiffs have specifically alleged 
particularized harm , and have responded with expert evidence dem onstrating the reasonable 
probability of  increased risk of  harm . See MacCracken Decl. at ¶¶ 27-39; 40-45.  Plaintiffs need 
not “conduct the sam e environm ental investigation that [they seek] to com pel the agency to 
undertake” sim ply to establish standing. Citizens for Better Forestry , 341 F.3d at 972; see also 
Rio Hondo , 102 F.3d at 451 (“[NEPA] was not intended to require the plaintiff to show with

Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  21Defendants’ also dispute Plaintiffs’ standi ng by asserting that their injuries are “too 
remote” or too conjectural to confer standing.  Defendants, however, overlook several im portant 
points.  First, because Plaintiffs claim  a proce dural injury, they can “establish standing without 
meeting all the norm al standards for … im mediacy.”  Id. at 972 (internal quotations and citations 
omitted).  Furtherm ore, in this case Plaintif fs have not only alleged that the im pacts of  global 
warm ing will occur in the f uture, but also that such im pacts are already affecting Plaintiffs’ 
interests.  See, e.g.,  Ellinghouse Decl. at ¶ ¶ 4, 8; Hayes Decl. at ¶ 18; Dustan Decl. at ¶¶ 10, 12; 
Duchin Decl. at ¶¶ 4, 5; Berndt Decl. at 5; MacCracken Decl. at ¶¶ 24, 32, 38, 45.  Thus 
Plaintiffs’ injuries are “actual” and not “rem ote.”

28 Finally, the alleged im pacts are not conject ural.  Defs.’ Mem . at 14.  Defendants 
them selves expressly acknowledge that the very im pacts alleged to injure Plaintiffs are likely to 
result from  global warm ing.  See, e.g.,  Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 3 (“The direct regional 
environm ental im pact of such a clim ate change could include changes in tem perature and 
precipitations levels, with corresponding changes to the properties and m oisture content of soil.  
The global im pact could include changes in weather patterns and rises in sea level.  The changes 
in turn can result in m ajor consequences to ecological system s, hum an health and socioeconom ic 
sectors such as agriculture, coastal resources, forests, energy and transportation.”).  The fact that 
governm ent studies and statem ents confirm  the Plai ntiffs’ allegations weighs in favor of finding 
standing.  See Central Delta Water Agency v. United States , 306 F.3d 938, 947-48 (9th Cir. 
2002) (concluding that plaintiffs successfully alleged a credible threat of future injury based, in 
part, on the fact that the governm ent’s own studies confirm ed plaintiff’s allegations); see also 
Baur v. Veneman , 352 F.3d 625, 631 (2d Cir. 2003) (sam e).  
B. Increased Harm to Plaintiffs’ Interests Is Fairly Traceable to 
Defendants Uninformed Decisionmaking 
 
“‘Once a plaintiff has established an injury in fact under NEPA, the causation and 
redressability requirem ents are relaxed.’”  Public Citizen , 316 F.3d at 1016 (quoting Cantrell , 
241 F.3d at 682).  Unlike an ordinary causation analysis, a petitioner asserting a procedural 
injury “need only show its increased risk is fairly  traceable to the agency' s failure to com ply with 
[NEPA].”   Rio Hondo , 102 F.3d at 451; see also  Public Citizen , 316 F.3d at 1016.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Watkins,  954 F.2d 974, 980 n.7 (4th 
Cir. 1992). . . . If scientific certainty were the standard, then plaintiffs would be 
required to supply costly, strict proof of causation to m eet a threshold

Further, “[u]nder the National Environm ental Policy Act, an injury results not from  the 
agency’s decision, but from  the agency’s uninformed  decisionm aking.  The increased risk of 
adverse environm ental consequences is due to the agency’s ‘failure substantively to consider the 
environm ental ram ifications of its actions in accordance with NEPA.’”  Rio Hondo , 102 F.3d at 
452 (em phasis in original) (quoting Catron County v. United States Forest Service , 75 F.3d 
1429, 1433 (10th Cir. 1996)). In this case, Plaintiffs’ increased risk of injury is traceable to OPIC 
and Ex-Im ’s failure to consider the environm ental im pact of CO 2 emissions from  projects they 
finance and insure.  
The Governm ent argues the chain of causation in this case is too attenuated to confer 
standing.  In particular, the Governm ent claim s that the Plaintiff cannot establish causation 
because m ost projects would go forward without  OPIC/Ex-Im ’s involvem ent, and that their 
contribution to global GHG em issions is m inimal.14  Defs.’ Mem . at 14-21. This argum ent stands 
the causation analysis on its head, and assum es as a predicate the very conclusion that NEPA 
analysis is designed to answer – i.e., whether the program ’s im pacts are significant.  
 
14 Defendants further suggest that causation cannot be established because “the basic 
connection between hum an-induced greenhouse gas em issions and observed clim ate change 
itself has not be established.” Defs.’ Mem . at 15. This argum ent is addressed supra  as part of

As an initial m atter, the correct inquiry is the im pact of Governm ent action – not 
speculation of whether the im pact would occur in the absence of governm ent action.  And, as 
OPIC and Ex-Im  both acknowledge, projects they finance em it greenhouse gases. See Assessing

                                            Furtherm ore, the agencies’ very purpose contradicts the notion that these projects would 
have gone forward even without the agencies’ assistance.15  First, OPIC and Ex-Im  invariably 
describe them selves as lenders, financers, and insurers of “last resort.”  See, e.g.,  2000 Ex-Im 
Annual Report  at 2 (Ex-Im  AR at Tab 4) (“By targe ting financing gaps and officially supported 
competition, Ex-Im  Bank supports export sales that otherwise would not have gone forward.”)  
(emphasis added); 2001 Ex-Im Bank Annual Report  at 1 (Ex-Im  AR at Tab 5) (“Ex-Im  Bank 
supports U.S. exports sales that otherwise would not go forward.”). Consequently, the agencies 
purportedly only becom e involved in transactions  where private m arkets are unable or unwilling 
to bear the risks associated with each transaction.  OPIC’s 2005 Congressional Budget Request  
emphasizes OPIC’s directive to not com pete with private finance and insurance m arkets, and 
specif ically identif ies the f ollowing m anagem ent goal for OPIC projects: “[e]valuate new 
projects to ensure that they would not have gone forward but for  OPIC’s involvem ent.”16 OPIC 
2005 Congressional Budget Request  at 10 (Pls.’ Exh. 14).  
 
15 As explained in Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike, these post hoc  allegations should be 
struck.  
 
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t   
Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  2416 Emphasizing the convenient inconsistency in the Governm ent’s position on this point, 
OPIC has also previously argued to Congress that is not possible to determ ine whether a 
particular investm ent would or would not be m ade without OPIC support.  See H. Rep. No. 97-
83, 97th Congress, 1st Sess. at 25 (1981) (“The Com mittee added an am endm ent … which would 
require OPIC when deciding whether or not to support investm ents in developing countries to 
consider whether the investm ent is likely to be m ade without OPIC support.  The am endm ent 
assum es that OPIC ought to lim it its support to those investm ents in developing countries which 
would probably not be m ade without benefit of  OPIC support.  OPIC opposed the am endm ent on 

The Defendants’ assertion that the im pacts are too attenuated also has no support in this 
record.   To the contrary, OPIC and Ex-Im  expr essly recognize that their financing of a fossil-
fuel-fired power plant results in GHG em issions.  See Assessing Our Actions  at 16-20; Ex-Im 
Climate Change Report  at 29-30.  Ex-Im  also recognizes that its financing of oil and gas 
extraction projects leads to GHG em issions.  Ex-Im Climate Change Report  at 30, Appendix B; 
2000 Ex-Im Bank Annual Report  at 17 (Ex-Im  AR at Tab 4) (“petroleum  sector projects 
supported by Ex-Im  Bank represent a second significant source of carbon dioxide.”). Indeed, the 
entire purpose of financing oil field developm ent is to bring oil to m arket for com bustion.  
Com bustion is not only “reasonably foreseeable,” see 40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(b), but intended.  Thus, 
it is not too attenuated.   1

in which the court has found the chain of causation too attenuated to establish standing.  First, 
unlike Florida Audubon, causation in this case does not turn on speculation over the independent 
behavior of third parties in response to a shift in tax policy.17 Florida Audubon Soc'y v. Bentsen ,

17  The Court Florida Audubon , outlined the extrem ely attenuated nature of  plaintif fs 
argum ent in the following paragraph:

Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  25For the tax credit to pose a substantial probability of  a dem onstrably increased 
risk of particularized environm ental dam age, the credit m ust prom pt third-party 
fuel producers to undertake the acquisition of production facilities for ETBE and 
begin to produce ETBE in such quantities as to increase the dem and for ethanol 
from  which the ETBE is derived. This increased dem and for ethanol m ust then 
not sim ply displace existing m arkets for currently-produced ethanol, but in fact 
increase dem and for the agricultural products from  which ethanol is m ade. Again, 
this dem and m ust not be filled by existing corn or sugar supplies, but instead spur 
new production of these products by farm ers, who m ust be shown to have 
increased production at least to som e measurable extent because of the tax credit, 
rather than any one of other innum erable farm ing considerations, including 

94 F.3d 658, 669-670 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  In this case, the third party action – com bustion of fossil 
fuel – is the intended purpose of these projects.  Florida Audubon  is theref ore inapplicable.  
Second, the court in Florida Audubon  rejected the “protracted chain of causation” in that case 
solely because “plaintiffs have put forward no parallel testim ony supporting each step of their

Audubon , Defendants here do not dispute  the essential elem ents of  causation in this case – that 
their actions result in GHG em issions, that these GHG em issions contribute to clim ate change, 
and that clim ate change will have the type of  impacts alleged by Plaintif fs. See, e.g., Ex-Im 
Climate Change Report  at 3, 29-30, 33-34. Given Defendants’ adm issions, the facts before this

With respect to redressability, the Plaintif fs need not dem onstrate that the agencies’ 
consideration of their direct, indirect, and cu mulative GHG em issions would actually change the 
 
weather, the availability of  credit, and existing subsidy program s. Moreover, any 
agricultural pollution from  this increased production m ust be dem onstrably m ore 
damaging than the pollution form erly caused by prior agricultural production or 
other prior use of land now cultivated because of the ETBE tax credit. Finally, the 
farm ers who have increased production (and pollution) as a result of the tax credit 
must include farm ers in the regions visited by appellants, and they m ust use 
techniques or chem icals in such fashion and to such extent as to threaten a 
demonstrably increased risk of environm ental harm  to the wildlife areas enjoyed 
by appellants.

Plaintif fs describe below the violations that will be challenged.  In short, Plaintif fs will 
challenge, inter alia , Defendants’ affirm ative and final finding that their aggregate energy 
portf olios do not have signif icant environm ental im pacts.  Plaintif fs will also challenge 
Defendants’ af firmative approval of  specif ic projects that will directly or indirectly em it

These violations are all established by the Adm inistrative Record.  After describing these 
actions, Plaintiffs explain why these actions ar e final and subject to judicial review.

Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  28OPIC and Ex-Im  have violated NEPA by failing to prepare an EA to determ ine whether 
the direct, indirect and cum ulative im pacts of their actions have a significant effect on the hum an 
environm ent.  See 2d Am d. Cm plt. at ¶¶ 151-152 and request for relief.  The facts supporting this 
allegation are clear and undisputed: (1) each defendant looked to see whether their actions 
contribute to clim ate change, s ee generally Assessing our Actions; Ex-Im Climate Change 
Report ; (2) each agency determ ined that it only m akes sense to do so in the aggregate or on a 
portf olio-wide basis, see, e.g., Ex-Im Climate Change  Report at 33 (“Hence, Ex-Im  Bank’s ‘role’ 
in the GHG em ission and clim ate change issue m ust be assessed by exam ining the aggregation of 
its actions taken to finance projects which produce CO 2 emissions.”); Assessing Our Actions  at 
16 (evaluating “OPIC Power Portfolio CO 2 emissions” in order “to assess the cum ulative GHG 
and clim ate im plications of [OPIC’s] investm ent activities”); (3) each agency affirm atively 
found that their cum ulative energy portfolios result in GHG em issions, but concluded that they 
do not have a significant environm ental im pact; and (4) neither agency supported this finding

See Ex-Im Climate Change  Report at 33 (Ex-Im  AR at Tab 1); OPIC’s Response to Plaintiffs’ 
Demand Letter (OPIC AR 4368-70). 
NEPA explicitly requires preparation of  an EA to determ ine whether im pacts of  a 
proposed action will be significant.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.9.  That determ ination – whether the 
impact is significant – is the sole purpose of an EA.  See id.  Contrary to the agencies’ 
suggestion, bald claim s of insignificance do not obvi ate their NEPA duties.  The direct, indirect 
and cum ulative em issions from  Defendants’ project have a reasonably foreseeable cum ulative 
impact on the earth’s clim ate, and OPIC and Ex-Im  must prepare an EA to evaluate the 
significance of these reasonably foreseeable im pacts.   Their failure to do so violates NEPA, and 
each violation is a final agency action 
1. Defendants’ Concede that Greenhouse Gas Emissions are a 
Reasonably Foreseeable Impact and Case Law Supports that 
Conclusion 
 
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t   
Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  29NEPA requires that federal agencies consider “any adverse environm ental effects” of 
their “m ajor ... actions,” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C), and CEQ regulations, which are binding on the 
agencies, explain that “effects” include both “dir ect effects” as well as “indirect effects.”  40 
C.F.R. § 1508.8.  Indirect effects are defined as those that “are caused by the action and are later 
in tim e or farther rem oved in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.”  Id.  “Indirect effects 
may include ... effects on air and water and other natural system s, including ecosystem s.”  Id.  
An agency therefore m ust consider, as part of its analysis all reasonably foreseeable im pacts 
caused by the proposed action.  See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.8, 1508.25(c); City of Davis , 521 F.2d at 
676.  “As in other legal contexts, an environm ental effect is ‘reasonably foreseeable’ if it is

548 (8th Cir. 2003) (quoting Sierra Club v. Marsh , 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992)).  
Defendants here concede that GHG em issions are a reasonably foreseeable im pact of 
their decisions to finance and insure projects in  their energy program s – including coal, oil, and 
gas power plants, and oil and gas fields.  Ex-Im Climate Change  Report at 30, 33; Assessing Our 
Actions  at 16. They likewise concede that GHG em issions contribute to clim ate change.  See id.   
Indeed, it is only the extent  of the Defendants’ contributions to Clim ate Change that is disputed.  
“When the nature  of the effect is reasonably foreseeable but its extent  is not … the agency m ay 
not sim ply ignore the effect.”  Mid States Coalition for Progress, 345 F.3d at 549.  
Courts have expressly required federal agencies to evaluate the extent  of indirect CO 2 
emissions from  federal projects significantly sm aller than the m assive financing and insurance 
program s at issue here.  For exam ple, in Mid States Coalition, 345 F.3d at 532, plaintiffs 
challenged the Surface Transportation Board’s approval of a new rail line to service coal m ining 
operations in W yoming's Powder River Basin.  Pl aintif fs alleged that the Board’s f ailure to 
consider the air pollution im pacts resulting from  eventual com bustion of coal delivered by the 
rail line violated NEPA.  Id. at 549.  The court agreed, and finding that the eventual com bustion 
of the coal was not “speculative” – as the Board claim ed – but instead “alm ost certain,” the court 
concluded that the defendant was legally requi red to consider the project’s indirect CO 2 
emissions.  Id.

were indicated by the record, the Court finds that the EA' s failure to disclose and analyze their 
significance is counter to NEPA.”).  The C0 2 contributions of the 500 MW  project at issue in 
Border Power are no doubt dwarfed by OPIC and Ex-Im ’s total energy portfolio, yet, for the 
purpose of  NEPA, DOE’s f ailure to consider these reasonably f oreseeable em issions still 
rendered its decision “inadequate under NEPA.” Id. 
2. Defendants Concede that Each Agency’s Energy Projects Have 
Cumulative Impacts. 
 
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t   
Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  31CEQ regulations require a program matic EIS to  be prepared where distinct individual 
projects have sim ilar cum ulative im pacts -- so-called cum ulative actions.  40 C.F.R § 1508.25.  
“Cum ulative actions” are defined as actions “which when viewed with other proposed actions 
have cum ulatively significant im pacts and should therefore be discussed in the sam e impact 
statem ent.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  Cum ulative im pacts are likewise described as “the im pact on 
the environm ent which results from  the increm ental im pact of the action when added to other 
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions ….  Cum ulative im pacts can result from  
individually m inor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of tim e.”  40 
C.F.R. § 1508.7.  If substantial questions are raised as to whether the group of actions will have a 
cumulative im pact, a single EA m ust be prepared to determ ine the significance of those 
cumulative actions.  See Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. , 387 F.3d at 998 (cum ulative NEPA 
analysis m ust be “done in a single docum ent when the record raises ‘substantial questions’ about 
whether there will be ‘signif icant environm ental im pacts’ f rom the collection of  anticipated 
projects.”); Blue Mountains Biodiv. Project v. Blackwood , 161 F.3d 1208, 1215 (9th Cir. 1998) ;

23 In this case, both agencies readily concede that each individual project adds to the 
cumulative im pact on clim ate change.  Indeed, each agency has conceded that the im pact of 
these projects should be evaluated at the program  or portfolio level.  Thus OPIC “recognized that 
carbon dioxide em issions and clim ate change im pacts are global and that the assessm ent of such 
impacts should not be lim ited to the project-specific level, but m ust be done on a cum ulative 
basis.”  OPIC Press Release, Landmark OPIC Report Shows Way for Government and Business 
to Demonstrate Accountability for Climate Impacts , October 30, 2000 (OPIC AR 4384). 
Based on this recognition, OPIC prepared an analysis of cum ulative carbon dioxide 
emissions associated with the agency’s “power portfolio” including its investm ent in and 
insurance of power plants.  Assessing Our Actions  at 12, 16-20.  OPIC, however, did not prepare 
an EA of its energy portfolio, nor did it consider the im pacts of indirect em issions – such as 
those associated with eventual com bustion of fo ssil fuel extracted from  projects financed or 
insured by OPIC.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.8 (NEPA analysis m ust include consideration of 
“indirect effects”).  OPIC likewise did not c onsider alternatives to its power portf olio 
investm ents, see 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14; did not invite com ments from  other federal agencies, 
including EPA, see 40 C.F.R. § 1503.1; and did not publish its analysis for public com ment. Id.

also refused to use NEPA procedures for this an alysis – it did not consider indirect em issions 
associated with com bustion of  fossil f uels, it f ailed to present alternatives to its energy program  
investm ents, it did not invite com ments from  other federal agencies with expertise in the area, 
and it f ailed to publish its lim ited analysis f or public com ment. 
3. Defendants’ Failure to Prepare an Environmental Assessment 
Violates NEPA  
 
It is undisputed that neither agency has prepared a program matic EA or EIS to assess the 
significance of the environm ental im pacts associat ed with each agency’s portfolios.  Nor have 
the agencies prepared individual EAs for each pr oject that consider the direct, indirect, and 
cumulative im pacts of all reasonably foreseeable past, present, and future actions.  Instead, both 
agencies have declared that they have no NEPA obligation unless they first determ ine that their 
actions “could, in fact, cause a significant im pact.”  See e.g., Ex-Im Climate Change Report  at 33 
(Ex-Im  AR Tab 1); OPIC’s Response to Plaintiffs Demand Letter (OPIC AR 4368-70) (arguing 
that NEPA review is only triggered if “OPIC’ s contribution to GHGs m eets the ‘significance’ 
test”).  
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t   
Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  33This position is patently wrong.  Under such an interpretation, EAs would sim ply serve 
no purpose – they would never be prepared, and CEQ’s extensive rules on when and how to 
prepare EAs would be superfluous.  NEPA dem ands m ore.  “An agency cannot avoid its 
statutory responsibilities under NEPA m erely by asser ting that an activity it wishes to pursue will 
have an insignificant effect on the environm ent.”  Alaska Ctr. for the Environment v. United 
States Forest Service , 189 F.3d 851, 859 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Steamboaters , 759 F.2d at 
1393) .  An EA m ust be prepared for this determ ination.  Indeed, a FONSI m ay only be m ade 
after preparation of an EA.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.13 (“[FONSI] shall include the environm ental

NEPA.  
B. Defendants’ Failure to Prepare a Programmatic Environmental 
Assessment is a Discrete Violation of their Ministerial Legal 
Obligation Under NEPA.  
 
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t   
Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  34The scope of the parties’ disagreem ent is narrow.  As explained above, Plaintiffs allege 
that OPIC and Ex-Im  are required to determ ine whether their actions have a significant 
environm ental im pact through preparation of an EA, but the agencies have refused to com ply 
with NEPA.  2d Am d. Cm plt. at ¶¶ 151-152.  The record dem onstrates that Defendants agree that 
GHG em issions are a reasonably foreseeable result of their actions, and that they should 
determ ine if their role in clim ate change m ay significantly affect the environm ent, thus triggering 
NEPA review.  Ex-Im Climate Change Report  at 33 (Ex-Im  AR at Tab 1); Assessing Our Actions  
at 5. Indeed, Ex-Im  acknowledges, “Ex-Im  Bank’s Environm ental Procedures call for a NEPA 
triggered environm ental review f or ‘those projects which m ay signif icantly af fect the quality of  
the hum an environm ent of the US.’”  Ex-Im Climate Change Report  at 33; 12 C.F.R. § 
408.4(b)(1).  Further, the agencies fully agree  with the notion that GHG em issions from  projects 
they sponsor m ust be looked at in the “aggregate” and “portfolio-wide” – or in NEPA parlance, 
“program matic” basis.  Assessing Our Actions  at 16 (evaluating GHG contribution of OPIC’s 
“power portfolio”); see also OPIC Press Release, Landmark OPIC Report Shows Way for 
Government and Business to Demonstrate Accountability for Climate Impacts , October 30, 2000 
(OPIC AR 4384) (“assessm ent of [clim ate change] im pacts should not be lim ited to the project-
specific level, but m ust be done on a cum ulative basis.”); Ex-Im Climate Change Report  at 33 
(Ex-Im  AR at Tab 1); (“Hence, Ex-Im  Bank’s ‘role’ in the GHG em ission and clim ate change

They therefore did just that.  OPIC and Ex-Im  each looked at their program matic actions 
and concluded, erroneously, that they do not have to com ply with NEPA because these 
program matic actions do not have a significant im pact on the environm ent.  Ex-Im Climate 
Change Report  at 33-34; Assessing Our Actions  at 20, 49.  Indeed, the record dem onstrates that 
the agencies’ exclusive rationale for their refusal to apply NEPA is that their program matic 
actions do not have significant im pacts on the dom estic environm ent:   
However, our own analysis of project emissions from  projects actually supported 
by OPIC during this period . . . indicates that the total annual share of 1996 global 
CO2 em issions that can be attributed to OPIC-supported projects is no m ore than 
0.5 percent.  This observation is corroborated by a m ore com prehensive analysis 
conducted by Ex-Im  bank.  (“Ex-In Bank’s Role in Greenhouse Gas Em issions 
and Clim ate Change,” August 31, 1999).  Therefore, we question whether the 
assum ption that OPIC’s contribution to GHGs m eets the “significance” test that 
could, under your interpretation, trigger a PEIS [program matic environm ental 
impact statem ent] under NEPA, or, for that m atter, an EIS pursuant to EO 12114. 
 
OPIC Response to Plaintiffs’ Demand Letter  at 2 (AR 4369).   
It should be noted that, as stated in response to Issue # 3, Ex-Im  Bank has 
previously concluded that its role in the production of greenhouse gases through 
the projects it finances is not significant with respect to its potential effect on the 
environm ent with respect to concerns associated with clim ate change.

The dispute arises, however, because the Defendants failed to em ploy the required EA 
process to determ ine the significance of their actions’ im pacts.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.9. NEPA rules 
require that a FONSI “shall include the environm ental assessm ent.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.13.  The 
Defendants refuse to perform  an EA. 
The APA provides that “the reviewing court shall  com pel agency action unlawfully 
withheld.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1) (em phasis added).  SUWA  and Lujan  held that action f alling within 
this provision’s scope m ust be discrete and legally required.18  SUWA , 124 S.Ct at 2378-79.  The 
Defendants’ f ailure to prepare an EA constitutes a discrete f ailure to perf orm a legally required 
act.  Catron County , 75 F.3d at 1434 (“alleged failure to com ply with NEPA constitutes final 
agency action”).  A failure to act “is sim ply the om ission of an action without form ally rejecting 
a request.”  SUWA , 124 S.Ct. at 2379.  Here, OPIC and Ex-Im ’s failures to act are discrete.  As 
established above, they specifically determ ined that they would not apply NEPA because their 
actions purportedly do not have a significant im pact.  But, they failed to prepare an EA in 
support of that decision.  The specific failure to prepare an EA in support of this conclusion is a 
discrete failure to act.  
 
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t   
Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  3618 SUWA  observed that 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) codified the traditional use of m andam us to 
remedy an agency’s failure to act.  SUWA , 124 S.Ct. at 2379.  Plaintiffs also seek m andam us 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  2d Am d. Cm plt. at ¶ 9. Mandam us is available when: (1) the plaintiff' s 
claim  is clear and certain; (2) the defendant official 's duty is m inisterial and so plainly prescribed

Babbitt , 113 F.3d 1061,  1065 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1997).  As explained in the text, Plaintiffs’ claim  that 
an EA is needed to support the Defendants’ FONSI is clear and certain, and Defendants 
obligation to perform  an EA is non-discretionary.  A m andam us should issue if the APA fails to 
provide an adequate rem edy.

25  The agency action that Plaintiffs seek to com pel is also legally required.  See id .; Catron 
County , 75 F.3d at 1434.  An EA is the exclusive m echanism  used to determ ine whether im pacts 
are significant.  “[T]he Federal agency shall : … prepare an environm ental assessm ent” to 
determ ine whether an im pact is significant.  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4 (em phasis added); see also  40 
C.F.R. § 1508.9 (“’Environm ental Assessm ent’ m eans a concise public docum ent … that serves 
to briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determ ining whether to prepare an 
environm ental im pact statem ent or a finding of no significant im pact.”).  And, any FONSI shall 
be supported by an EA.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.13.  Therefore, OPIC and Ex-Im  failed to perform  
the discrete, legally required act of preparing an EA to support its FONSI.  Such acts m ay be 
compelled under the APA.  See Catron County , 75 F.3d at 1434. 
C. Defendants’ Affirmative Acts Violate NEPA and are Subject to 
Review  Under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).    
 
Separate from  an agency’s failure to act, the APA also authorizes the courts to determ ine 
whether an agency’s affirm ative actions were “in accordance with the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  
Review of an agency’s affirm ative actions are not lim ited by SUWA .  See EPIC , 2004 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 20717 at *102 (“The instant case entails not a failure  to act as in Norton ; rather, this 
involves a challenge to an affirm ative final agency action.  Therefore, Norton  [SUWA ] is not 
controlling here.”).  Affirm ative “agency action” includes “the whole or part of an agency … 
order … sanction, relief, or the equivalent or  denial thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13).   
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t   
Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  37Two affirm ative final agency actions are clearly presented here.  First, each agency has 
effectively issued a FONSI.  They have concluded that their cum ulative actions do not have a

Agency action is "f inal" if  two conditions are satisf ied: “First, the action m ust mark the

(citation and internal quotes om itted).  Both of these affirm ative actions constitute final action 
that m ay be reviewed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). 
1. Defendants’ FONSIs are affirmative final agency actions subject to 
judicial review under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) .   
 
The above-described FONSIs are final affirm ative actions that are not in accordance with 
the law.  NEPA “sim ply guarantees a particular procedure, not a particular result.  Hence a 
person with standing who is injured by a failure to com ply with the NEPA procedure m ay 
complain of that failure at the tim e the failure takes place, for the claim  can never get riper.”

25 The FONSIs also determ ine obligations and the legal consequences flowing from  this 
obligation.  Bennett , 520 U.S. at 177-78.  OPIC and Ex-Im  have decided that they are not 
obligated to apply NEPA.  They thus have not provided the process and analysis required by 
NEPA.  Indeed, the record produced by Defendants unequivocally dem onstrates that, after 
having m ade their FONSIs, OPIC and Ex-Im  continued to pursue their energy portfolios or 
program s without regard to NEPA.  See e.g., OPIC Environm ental Clearance Docum ents (OPIC 
AR 190-1362) (no NEPA review); Ex-Im  Project Engineering Evaluations (Ex-Im  AR Tabs 24-
28) (no NEPA review). Therefore, the Defendant s’ affirm ative finding that their actions do not 
result in significant im pacts are final actions not in accordance with the law, and thus subject to 
review under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). 
2. Defendants’ decisions to finance particular projects are final agency 
actions subject to judicial review.   
 
Final agency action includes the grant of m oney or assistance.  5 U.S.C. § 551(11)(A).  
The Defendants’ decisions to finance or otherwise assist the projects identified in the com plaint 
and record constitute final agency action.  Defendants do not dispute that these actions are final, 
nor do they dispute Plaintiffs’ claim  that these projects were not subjected to NEPA review.  
Indeed, the record is devoid of any NEPA review for these projects.

Mem . at 28 (citing Sierra Club v. Peterson , 228 F.3d 559, 567 (5th Cir. 2000)).  As established 
above, Plaintiffs are not m ounting such a challenge and Sierra Club v. Peterson  is irrelevant to 
this m atter.  Further, the fact that Defendants have failed to apply NEPA to all of their actions 
does not prevent Plaintiffs from  selecting partic ular individual actions to challenge.  That is 
exactly what Plaintiffs do here.

attem pt to claim  that this m atter m eets the elem ents necessary to claim  laches.  See Neighbors of 
Cuddy Mountain v. United States Forest Service , 137 F.3d 1372, 1381 (9th Cir. 1997) (“the party 
seeking to invoke [laches] m ust show: (1) that the opposing party lacked diligence in pursuing its 
claim ; and (2) that prejudice resulted f rom that lack of  diligence.”).  These elem ents are not m et 
here.  And, “’we have repeatedly cautioned against application of the equitable doctrine of laches 
to public interest environm ental litigation. … This approach has found unanim ous support in the 
other circuits.’" Id. (quoting Portland Audubon Soc'y v. Lujan, 884 F.2d 1233, 1241 (9th Cir. 
1989)).   
Further, the cases cited by Defendants in support of their laches argum ent address 
mootness – not laches.  However, Defendants fail to develop a m ootness argum ent other than to 
generically state that com mitments for unspecified projects have been m ade and m onies have 
been partially or fully disbursed or are in the process being repaid.  See Defs.’ Mem . at 28, n. 18.  
No project-specific analysis is provided.  Id.  This m ere footnote fails to m eet the particularly 
heavy burden required to dem onstrate m ootness: 
When evaluating the issue of m ootness in NEPA cases, we have repeatedly 
emphasized that if the com pletion of the action challenged under NEPA is 
sufficient to render the case nonjusticiable, entities "could m erely ignore the 
requirem ents of NEPA, build its structures before a case gets to court, and then 
hide behind the m ootness doctrine.  Such a result is not acceptable."  West , 206 
F.3d at 925 (quoting Columbia Basin Land Protection Ass'n v. Schlesinger , 643

V. OPIC’S ACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW 
UNDER THE APA, AND OPIC IS SUBJECT TO NEPA 
 
 Federal agencies are subject to judicial review of their actions under the APA unless 
another statute specifically precludes review.  OP IC’s organic statute does not contain express 
language that precludes review, and legislative history does not suggest that Congress intended 
to exem pt the agency from  review.  Furtherm ore, OPIC is subject to the requirem ents of NEPA.  
NEPA requirem ents apply to all federal agencies.  See 42 U.S.C. § 4332.  The requirem ents set 
forth in NEPA are “supplem entary to those set forth in existing authorizations of Federal 
agencies.”  42 U.S.C. § 4335.  OPIC is subject to specific environm ental review requirem ents 
that are tailored to the agency’s overseas operations. See 22 U.S.C. § 2151p(c)(1)(A).  NEPA 
supplem ents these procedures – they do not supplan t NEPA.  Legislative history helps to explain 
the relationship between these requirem ents, but history does not suggest that Congress intended 
to divorce OPIC and NEPA procedures, as Defenda nts suggest.  Rather, the absence of express 
language to that effect dem onstrates that NEPA applies.   
A. OPIC’s Organic Statute Does Not Preclude Judicial Review

legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.…”  
Section 702 is applicable unless judicial re view is expressly precluded by statute.  See 5 U.S.C. § 
701(a)(1).  “In the absence of express statutory language,” the Suprem e Court has “reserved that 
exception for cases in which the existence of an alternative review procedure provided ‘clear and

23 convincing evidence’ … of a legislative intent to preclude judicial review.”  Franklin v. 
Massachusetts , 505 U.S. 788, 820 (1992) (citation om itted). 
 OPIC’s organic statute does not contain expr ess language that precludes judicial review, 
nor does it contain an “alternate review procedur e.”  Furtherm ore, legislative history does not 
indicate that Congress intended for OPIC to be im mune from  judicial review. 
Defendants conf use the two threshold requirem ents for determ ining reviewability.  For a 
statute to preclude judicial review, it m ust offer express language or alternative evidence of 
congressional intent.  Defendants seek to stitch pieces of these separate requirem ents into a 
single standard.  Defendants argue that the “express language” of OPIC’s organic statute 
“demonstrates Congress’s intent  to preclude judicial review of OPIC’s com pliance with its 
environm ental review obligations.”  Defs.’ Mem . at 30 (em phasis added).  Statutory text m ay be 
termed “express” when it offers a clear statem ent whose m eaning does not require additional 
evidence to discern.  See, e.g., Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company v. Pueblo of 
Santa Ana , 472 U.S. 237, 276 (1985).  An exam ination of Congressional intent should not be 
necessary to interpret express language.  Defendants cannot point to express language in OPIC’s 
statute to support their position.

no express reference to judicial review or an  “alternate review procedure,” and the language 
bears little resem blance to other express statutory provisions that purport to insulate agencies 
from  judicial review.  For exam ple, the Interm odal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act 
(ISTEA), Pub. L. No. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914 ( 1991), provides: “[A]ny decision by the

23 Secretary concerning a plan or program  described in this section shall not be considered to be a 
Federal action subject to review  under [NEPA].”  23 U.S.C. § 134(o) (em phasis added).  
According to the Sixth Circuit, “This language  specifically precludes judicial review of certain 
actions under NEPA.”  Southwest Williamson County Community Ass’n,  173 F.3d at 1038 
(emphasis added).  Thus, even with clear language exem pting “any decision” under ISTEA from  
review, the court found preclusion to be lim ited.  Other statutes that preclude review sim ilarly 
provide explicit direction that agency actions “shall not be reviewable in any court.”  See, e.g. , 
Ethics in Governm ent Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. § 288i; Transportation Equity Act for the 21st 
Century, 23 U.S.C. § 135; Voting Rights Ac t of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b); Regional Rail 
Reorganization Act of 1973, 45 U.S.C. § 716.  OPIC ’s organic statute clearly does not exem pt 
the agency from  judicial review. 
 Defendants argue that the statute’s “presum ption of com pliance” is sufficient express 
language.  This phrase, however, does not appear in OP IC’s organic statute.  It is a basic tenet of 
administrative law that agency decisions are presum ptively valid.  But that basic prem ise does 
not am ount to blanket im munity from  review.  De fendants rely solely on legislative history and 
their own experts to carry their point.  Yet even the legislative history does not expressly exem pt 
OPIC from  judicial review.  The congressional records provide no m ore explicit language than 
the OPIC statute.  A House Com mittee Report expl ains that guaranty contracts are presum ed to 
be in com pliance with statutory requirem ents.  This explanation m irrors the accepted statutory 
text, and it does little to clarify Congress’ intent.  It is im portant to note, m oreover, that the 
legislative history f ails to m ake ref erence to the applicability (or lack thereof ) of judicial review. 
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t

23 protected if execution of the contract was induced  by fraud or m isrepresentation.”  H. Rep. No. 
91-611, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. at 37 (1969).  Thus, even guaranty contracts that carry a 
“presum ption of com pliance” are not entirely shielded from  review.  By defining the 
applicability of the “presum ption of com pliance, ” Congress anticipated the necessity for som e 
investigation to determ ine if a contract was “i nduced by fraud or m isrepresentation.”  Thus, not 
only does the OPIC statute not preclude review, it provides for a specific situation when review 
is required. 
 In addition, Defendants’ argum ents fail because they confuse the intended beneficiaries 
of the “presum ption of com pliance.”  A House Com mittee Report indicates that this presum ption 
is intended to protect contract claim ants, not OP IC.  As Defendant asserts, OPIC’s clients m ay 
rely on the “presum ption of com pliance” when “assessing the validity of OPIC’s guarantees.”  
Defs.’ Mem . at 31.   
 Additional legislative history suggests that OP IC actions are indeed subject to judicial 
review.  In 1992, an am endm ent was proposed to transfer OPIC operations to the Office of 
Managem ent and Budget (OMB).  138 Cong. Rec. H7494-03, at 32.  The am endm ent failed, but 
the record of discussion sheds som e light on OPIC’s susceptibility to review.  The proposed 
revision provides: “Orders and actions of the Direct or of the [OMB] in the exercise of functions 
of the [OPIC] shall be subject to judicial review to the sam e extent and in the sam e manner as if 
such orders and actions had been by the [OPIC].”  Id.  Clearly, the Representatives participating 
in that conversation assum ed that OPIC was subject to judicial review. 
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t

“presum ption of com pliance” is deem ed to equal a prohibition on judicial review, Defendants 
have highlighted a very narrow provision as e xpress language.  A plain reading of section

24 2197(j) clearly indicates a treatm ent of guara nty contracts.  OPIC’s activities extend beyond 
guaranty contracts, however.  The specific refere nce to guaranty contracts, and none of OPIC’s 
other f unctions, dem ands a lim ited treatm ent of that section’s applicability.  The agency’s 
organic statute provides: “The requirem ents of section 2151p(c) of this title relating to 
environm ental im pact statem ents and environm ental assessm ents shall apply to any investm ent 
which the Corporation insures, reinsures, guarantees, or finances .…”  22 U.S.C. § 2199(g) 
(emphasis added).  Thus, even if Congress inte nded to im munize guaranty contracts from  review, 
there is nothing in OPIC’s statute or legislative history to suggest that im munity is extended to 
all of the agency’s actions.  Defendants have not established the “clear and convincing evidence” 
of Congress’ intent to preclude all of OPIC’s  actions from  judicial review under the APA. 
B.  OPIC Is Subject to NEPA Requirements 
 
 Even if  the OPIC statute does preclude judicial review, the agency m ust still conf orm to 
the requirem ents of NEPA.  “[E]ach agency of  the Federal Governm ent shall com ply with 
[NEPA] unless existing law applicable to the agency’s operations expressly prohibits or m akes 
compliance im possible.”  40 C.F.R. § 1500.6.  Defendants argue that OPIC’s statutory 
requirem ents supplant NEPA.  Rather than supplanting NEPA requirem ents, however, the OPIC 
statute gives the agencies directions on how to apply NEPA.  As Defendants state, the 
environm ental assessm ent and environm ental im pact statem ent are not unique to OPIC, but are 
“term s of art from  NEPA.” Defs.’ Mem . at 34. 
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t   
Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  45OPIC’s environm ental m andates apply to overseas – not dom estic – environm ental 
impacts.  Therefore, as with application of NEPA to Ex-Im , OPIC’s statutory requirem ents are 
supplem ental and com plementary to the agency’s duties under NEPA.  This principle is 
supported by case law, legislative history, and a plai n reading of the pertinent legislative texts. 

 The Ninth Circuit has recognized two tests to exem pt agency action from  NEPA 
requirem ents.  W hen an agency has NEPA-like procedures in place, but declines to apply actual 
NEPA procedures to its actions, courts m ay apply a “displacem ent” test or a “functional 
equivalent” test.  “The ‘displacem ent’ argum ent asserts that Congress intended to displace one 
procedure with another.  The “functional equivalent” argum ent is that one process requires the 
same steps as another.”  Douglas County,  48 F.3d at 1504 n. 10.  Defendants argue that Congress 
intended to “displace” NEPA requirem ents with procedures specifically tailored to OPIC, and 
that the NEPA process is therefore “superfluous.”  Defs.’ Mem . at 32.  These cases are 
inapposite because review of im pacts abroad does not render dom estic review superfluous.19 1

because the respective defendants in those cases are agencies with a “responsibility to protect the 
environm ent.”  Courts provide a m ore flexible application of NEPA to such agencies.  In 
Merrell , the court approved of a statem ent taken from  the legislative history of the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, which stated: Because the basic thrust and principal 
responsibility of [the Environm ental Protection Agency] are to protect the environm ent, 
[Congress] does not see a need to [apply NEPA].”  Merrell , 807 F.2d at 780 (citation om itted).  
In Douglas County , the court found that “NEPA does not require an [environm ental im pact 
statem ent] for actions that preserve the physical environm ent.”  Douglas County , 48 F.3d at 
1505.  The agency action at issue in Douglas County  “furthers the purpose of NEPA,” and 
requiring additional NEPA procedures “would only hinder its efforts at attaining the goal of

23 improving the environm ent.”  Id. at 1506 (citing Pacific Legal Foundation v. Andrus , 657 F.2d 
829, 837 (6th Cir. 1981). 
 OPIC has an econom ic mission, and it is not an environm ental protection agency.  Thus, 
unlike the defendants in Merrell  and Douglas County , OPIC’s actions are not presum ed to 
further the goal of “im proving the environm ent,” and its environm ental review procedures do not 
displace NEPA. 
 Furtherm ore, in Douglas County , the court found that the Endangered Species Act “has 
an im portant m andate that distinguishes it from  NEPA. … This m andate conflicts with the 
requirem ents of NEPA because in cases where extinction is at issue, the Secretary has no 
discretion to consider the [other] environm ental im pact[s] of his or her actions.”  Douglas 
County , 48 F.3d at 1503.  In other words, Congress had specifically given preference to 
endangered species protection, to the exclusion of other environm ental considerations. 
 OPIC, however, is required to: “refuse to insure, reinsure, guarantee, or finance any 
investm ent in connection with a project which the Corporation determ ines will pose an 
unreasonable or m ajor environm ental, health, or safety hazard, or will result in the significant 
degradation of national parks or sim ilar protect ed areas.”  22 U.S.C. § 2191(n).  Contrary to 
Douglas County , OPIC lacks the discretion to not consider the environm ental im pacts of its 
actions.

applied.  Defs.’ Mem . at 35.  These additional requirem ents were intended to clarify OPIC’s

23 set forth at 22 U.S.C. § 2191a serve to further define OPIC’s statutory com mitments, rather than 
curtailing them .   
 The OPIC Act requires “an environm ental im pact statem ent for any program  or project 
… significantly affecting the environm ent of the global com mons outside the jurisdiction of any 
country [or] the environm ent of the United States.”  22 U.S.C. § 2151p(c)(1)(A).  An EA is 
required for “any proposed program  or project … significantly affecting the environm ent of any 
foreign country.”  22 U.S.C. § 2151p(c)(1)(B).  Under m ost circum stances, NEPA requires the 
preparation of an EIS for agency actions that a ffect the environm ent of the United States.  Thus, 
the OPIC statute does not conflict with NEPA.  Th e requirem ent of an EA for projects outside of 
the United States sim ply adds to the dem ands of NEPA.  Rather than supplanting NEPA 
requirem ents, as Defendants suggest, the OPIC st atute gives the agencies directions on how to 
apply NEPA.  As Defendants state, the EA and EI S are not unique to OPIC, but are “term s of art 
from  NEPA.”  Defs.’ Mem . at 34. 
 In a further explication of OPIC’s relationship to NEPA, Congress granted to the 
President power to exem pt individual OPIC projects from  environm ental review.  See 22 U.S.C. 
§ 2151p(c)(2).  This section balances the President’s interest in foreign policy with the 
requirem ents of NEPA.  It shows that Congress did anticipate that NEPA would generally apply 
to OPIC’s actions.  The section does not suggest, however, that Congress intended to exem pt all 
of OPIC’s activities f rom NEPA review.

Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  48Defendants argue that Congress intended to divorce OPIC’s environm ental review 
responsibilities from  its responsibilities under NEPA.  Legislative history suggests, however, that 
Congress intended to define OPIC’s environm ental review process via reference to NEPA.  A 
House Com mittee Report on the International Security and Developm ent Cooperation Act of

23 1981 (ISDCA) discusses the environm ental review procedures that are applicable to OPIC.  As 
Defendants correctly point out, OPIC is synonym ous with U.S. AID in the text: “[t]he com mittee 
does not … expect  this am endm ent to section 118 to im pose any m ore or any fewer requirem ents 
on AID than are already set forth in AID’s own environm ental procedures (regulation 16, 22 
CFR par. 216).” H. Rep. No. 97-58, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 47 (1981) (em phasis added). 
 This does not am ount to an express statutory exem ption.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1500.6.  To the 
contrary, the U.S. AID regulations clearly anticipate NEPA’s applicability to the agency’s 
actions.  Thus, NEPA requirem ents do not violat e the “no m ore, no less” provision in the above 
statem ent.  U.S. AID’s requirem ents are laid out in im plem enting regulations, which provide: 
“These procedures are consistent with Executive Order 12114 … and the purposes of the 
National Environm ental Policy Act of 1970 ….  They are intended to implement the 
requirements of NEPA  as they effect the A.I.D. program .”  22 C.F.R. § 216.1(a) (em phasis 
added).  These regulations clearly correlate the NEPA process with OPIC’s own environm ental 
review process.  The regulations further define the EIS that is required by AID procedures: “It is 
a specific docum ent having a definite form at and content, as provided in NEPA and the CEQ 
Regulations.”  22 C.F.R. § 216.1(c)(5). 
 
Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs .’ Mot. for Sum m. Jdgm t   
Civ. No. 02-4106 JSW  49These regulations reflect Congress’ specific in tent to apply NEPA to OPIC actions.  The 
reference to U.S. AID procedures in the le gislative history relied upon by Defendants provides 
“clear and convincing evidence” that OPIC is subject to NEPA.  The fact that the Com mittee 
Report on the ISDCA excluded a specific reference to NEPA for that statute does not belie this 
point.  Reference to NEPA was struck “so as  to avoid confusion.”  H. Rep. No. 97-58, 97th 
Cong., 1st Sess. 47 (1981).  The agency regulations referred to in the statute already describe the 
agency’s duties under NEPA, so additional reference to NEPA m ay have cast those procedures

and exclude OPIC from  its responsibilities under NEPA.    
VI. CONCLUSION. 
 
For the reasons stated, Defendants’ Motion for Sum mary Judgm ent should be denied.
