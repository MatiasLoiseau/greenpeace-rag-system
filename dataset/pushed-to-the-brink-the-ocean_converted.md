Introduction

Without our oceans, life on Earth would not be possible.
They produce and regulate most of the world’s oxygen, water
and water supply cycles; drive and moderate the world’s
climate and weather; provide a substantial amount of the
world’s nutrient cycling; stabilise biota and biological
communities including pests and disease; support most of the
world’s biological diversity and feed humans – to name but a
few important functions.
It is a matter of grave concern, therefore, that the oceans are
being systematically degraded and are in decline.
Already subjected to multiple human-induced stressors, most
seriously overﬁshing, the resilience of the oceans and their
consequent ability to adapt to change is decreasing. Yet it is
this very resilience that scientists argue is vital if the oceans
are to survive the onslaught of global climate change.

Current threats

The most immediate and signiﬁcant threat to the oceans is
overﬁshing. The demand for ﬁsh is exceeding the oceans’ ecological
limits with devastating impacts on marine ecosystems. Scientists are
warning that overﬁshing results in profound changes in our oceans,
perhaps permanently.

Despite some alterations to the way ﬁsheries are managed, there is
little ground for optimism; 77% of all ﬁsh stocks are now either fully or
over-exploited1; ﬁshermen are bringing home smaller and smaller
catches despite technological advances; ﬁsh-size, abundance and
genetic diversity has plummeted; high-value species are being
replaced by so-called “trash” ﬁsh; and habitat degradation is
widespread and increasing2. Destructive practices and overﬁshing
have diminished the sea’s ability to renew its resources, with
consequences for the more than one billion people in the world who
rely on ﬁsh as their primary source of protein.

The reality of modern ﬁshing is an industrialisation that far outstrips
nature’s ability to replenish. Ships operate as ﬂoating factories,
containing ﬁsh processing and packing plants, huge freezing systems
and powerful engines to drag enormous ﬁshing gear through the
oceans – everything required to suck as much ﬁsh out of the oceans
as quickly as possible and to despatch it for consumption.

This wholesale damage and destruction is compounded by many
other stressors exerted on the ocean from pollution to extraction. The
cumulative result is that the resilience of the oceans – both individually
and as a global network providing major services to the planet – is
degenerating.

Climate change will only make this situation worse.

Climate change and the world’s oceans

Climate change is already harming people and ecosystems. Its reality
can be seen in disintegrating polar ice, thawing permafrost, dying
coral reefs, rising sea levels, changing ecosystems and increasingly
intense extreme weather events. It is not just the scientists who are
witnessing these changes; from Inuit in the far north to islanders near
the equator, people are already struggling with the impacts of climate
change. Internationally the debate is no longer about whether or not
the impacts will be serious but about how to avoid the most
dangerous impacts of climate change and how to adapt to and
manage those already occurring.

We have a tendency to think of climate change in terms of its impacts
on land but it has multiple effects on the oceans, affecting their ability
to function. These include:

Rising temperatures

• The distribution of plankton and marine productivity in the oceans is

likely to shift with projected changes in the sea-surface
temperature, together with wind speed, nutrient supply and
sunlight, with consequences for the entire marine food-web,
including the abundance and distribution of commercial species3.

• Entire species of marine animals and ﬁsh will die out because they

are unable to survive in warmer waters.

• Whales and dolphins strand themselves in high temperatures and
the great whales risk losing their feeding grounds in the Southern
Ocean around Antarctica because of melting and the collapse of ice
shelves.

• An increasing occurrence of disease in marine animals has also

been found to be linked to rising ocean temperatures.

Greenpeace International Pushed to the brink - The oceans and climate change 3

• Examination of ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica has

shown that abrupt climate change incidents in the distant past have
lead to changes in the Conveyer circulation. Such changes are
certain to affect all life, terrestrial as well as marine, since the
services which the Conveyer performs for the whole planet will be
disrupted with consequences we can but poorly understand at
this point.

Shrinking habits

• Reductions in Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice could alter the seasonal
distributions, geographic ranges, migration patterns, nutritional
status, reproductive success and ultimately the abundance of many
marine mammals that depend on these ecosystems.

• Arctic sea-ice has decreased by about 8% over the past 30 years
and some models indicate a complete ice-free summer Arctic
Ocean in the latter half of this century8. Phytoplankton grows under
sea-ice. A reduction in sea-ice implies a reduction in
phytoplankton. Phytoplankton feeds small crustaceans including
krill, so any reduction in phytoplankton implies a subsequent
reduction in krill. In turn, krill feeds many marine species and is at
the centre of the region’s food web.

Rising sea levels

• With rising sea levels there is an increased possibility that important
habitats such as coastal meadows and lagoons will be squeezed or
completely lost. In addition, increasingly destructive storms and
hurricanes threaten many coastal areas.

• A global average sea level rise between 9 and 88 cm (3.5 and 34.6
inches) is expected over the next hundred years, as a result of the
greenhouse gasses we have emitted to date and likely future
emissions.

• This rise will come in roughly equal measure from melting ice and
thermal expansion of the oceans (water expands as it heats up).
Even this modest rise will wreak havoc. Coastal ﬂooding and storm
damage, eroded shorelines, saltwater contamination of freshwater
supplies, the ﬂooding of coastal wetlands and barrier islands, and
an increase in salinity are all realities of even a small amount of sea
level rise, affecting millions of people. Resources critical to island
and coastal populations – including beaches, fresh water, ﬁsheries,
coral reefs and atolls and wildlife habitat - will be at risk.

Turning sour

• The oceans naturally absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the

atmosphere. To date they have absorbed approximately 70% of the
human-created carbon overload, thus slowing the rate of climate
change, but this has led to changes in the chemical balance of sea
water, making it less alkaline (that is, with a lower pH), a process
called 'acidiﬁcation'. The oceans will continue absorbing excess
CO2 to their detriment and with increasing shifts in the pH balance
of the oceans. Ocean acidiﬁcation is not strictly an effect of climate
change, but rather an additional consequence of rising atmospheric
CO2 levels4,5.

• Acidiﬁcation of the oceans, even long before the water actually

becomes acidic (that is with a pH lower than 7), is detrimental to a
wide range of marine organisms, such as phyto- and zoo-plankton,
molluscs and corals, which rely on a process of calciﬁcation to
produce external or internal skeletons made from calcium
carbonate6. Increased acidity makes calciﬁcation more difﬁcult and
energy intensive and can ultimately lead to the dissolution of
carbonate structures. The wider implications for biodiversity and
ecosystem processes are only now beginning to be understood.

• Changes to the ocean’s salinity from melting Arctic ice and/or

increased precipitation could also switch off, slow down or divert
ocean currents, bringing about a dramatic disruption around the
globe.

Changing currents

• The water in our world’s oceans is always moving – pulled by tides,
blown by waves and slowly circulating around the globe by the
force of the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt (also called thermohaline
circulation). The Conveyor is powered by differences in water
temperature and salinity and performs a range of important
functions. The Gulf Stream, for example - one of its better known
parts - carries warm water north from the tropics, and is what gives
Europe its relatively warm climate and plays a role in moderating the
global climate. The Conveyor also provides an upwelling of bottom-
ocean nutrients and increases the oceanic absorption of carbon
dioxide.

• Rising temperatures and changing salinity patterns are leading to
changes in these currents. For example, increasing freshwater
runoff into the Arctic Ocean north of Europe and Russia is
weakening the Gulf Stream. In November 2006, scientists reported
that the Gulf Stream appears to have weakened by 30% in just 12
years . Recent studies warn that we may already have evidence of
a slower Conveyor circulation over the Scotland-Greenland deep
ocean ridge.

• Only four years ago, it was commonly accepted that the West

Antarctic ice sheet was stable, but unexpected melting in the region
is causing scientists to rethink this assumption. Potentially, the West
Antarctic ice sheet could contribute an additional six metres to sea
level rise. Although the chances of this are considered low in the
United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
Third Assessment report, recent research indicates new evidence of
massive ice discharge from the ice sheet. The entire Antarctic ice
sheet holds enough water to raise global sea levels by 62 metres.

• In July 2005, scientists aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise
made a shocking discovery – evidence that Greenland’s glaciers are
melting at an unprecedented rate. Findings indicated that the
Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier on Greenland’s east coast could be one
of the fastest-moving glaciers in the world, with a speed of almost
14 kilometres per year. In addition, the glacier unexpectedly
receded approximately ﬁve kilometres since 2001 after maintaining
a stable position for the past 40 years. Greenland’s massive ice
sheet locks up more than 6% of the world’s fresh water supply and
it is melting much faster than expected. If Greenland were to fully
melt, it would cause sea levels around the globe to rise by nearly 6
metres. Even measurements of 1.25 to 1.5 metres of sea level rise
could mean that locations as diverse as New York and Bangladesh
will experience ﬂooding.

• The alarming retreat of the Kangerdlugssuag Glacier suggests that
the entire Greenland ice sheet may be melting far more rapidly than
previously believed. All current scientiﬁc forecasts for global
warming have assumed slower rates of melting. This new evidence
suggests that the threat of global warming is much greater and
more urgent than previously believed.

The IPCC warned in 2001 that climate change will “affectthe
physical,biologicalandbiochemicalcharacteristicsoftheoceans
andcoasts”,with“signiﬁcantfeedbackontheclimatesystem”9.
Organisms in coastal zones and enclosed seas would be most at risk
from climate change.

In February 2007, the IPCC revealed that our oceans had absorbed
more than 80% of the heat added to the climate system and that
average sea temperatures, as a result, had increased to depths of at
least 3,000 metres10. At current levels, the ocean will continue to heat
up for “morethanamillennium”.

This will inevitably lead to changes in our oceans and those changes
are likely to be highly complex, from shifts in sea temperature, sea
level and currents to the very chemistry of the sea water itself.
Moreover, negative feedback between climate change and other
human activities, particularly ﬁshing pressure, will likely exacerbate
the climate-induced changes to marine ecosystems.

The Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
advised that “genetically-diversepopulationsandspecies-rich
ecosystemshaveagreaterpotentialtoadapttoclimatechange”11.
To help reduce the negative impacts of global warming, it
recommends that ﬁshing nations reduce pressure on ﬁsheries and
associated ecosystems.

The urgency of the situation was starkly illustrated in November,
2006, when an international group of scientists, led by Professor
Boris Worm, showed that the loss of marine biodiversity is drastically
reducing the ocean’s ability to produce seafood, resist diseases, ﬁlter
pollutants and rebound from stresses such as overﬁshing and climate
change. The team went on to warn that the consequences of
biodiversity loss are felt in terms of the structure and functioning of
ecosystems, including their interactions with the water, carbon,
nitrogen and other major bio-geochemical cycles12.

In short, the experts warn that we have eroded the ocean’s ability
to cope with and mitigate the consequences of climate change.
They recommend that we reduce our exploitation levels of marine ﬁsh
and other maritime activities in order to improve the resilience of our
oceans and ultimately safeguard their role in stabilising the climate
and maintaining life on earth.

We need to reduce all the pressures exerted on the oceans in order
to give them the best possible chance of withstanding the impacts
of climate change, because the Earth cannot survive without the
services that the oceans provide. This includes tackling climate
change through achieving a peak in global greenhouse gasses by
2015 and more than halving emissions by 2050.

Marine Reserves
Protecting the marine environment from climate change

An ecosystem approach

The growing understanding that conventional ﬁsheries management is
failing and climate change impacts are growing has prompted
widespread agreement on the need to adopt an approach to the
management of ﬁsheries and other human activities which addresses
the whole ecosystem. Scientists and politicians agree that it is
necessary to move away from conventional, single-stock
management towards what is called the ‘ecosystem-based approach’
and this is reﬂected in a series of political commitments at national,
regional and international level.

But these commitments have not resulted in effective implementation,
leaving the oceans in their current vulnerable state.

Radical action is needed to address the threats facing the oceans and
protect their vital functions, taking into account the complex
interactions of all the ecosystems of the marine realm and of all the
oceans, which combine to provide functions for the single largest
ecosystem of all – planet Earth.

This is possible with a twofold approach whereby human activities are
managed sustainably and areas of the oceans are set aside as marine
reserves.

Implementation

To implement this ecosystem approach requires a management
strategy that:
- goes beyond a single or multi-species approach by considering the
ecosystem as a whole;
- is aimed at protecting biodiversity and recovering ecosystems, not
least with the aim to improve their resilience to global climate change;
- avoids over-harvesting and ecosystem modiﬁcations;
- is based on the precautionary principle – i.e. conservation measures
are taken even in the absence of full knowledge of the activities,
impacts and ecological responses to these impacts;
- focuses on the ‘upstream’ control of human activities rather than on
the control of impacts or ecosystems;
- is robust even in the light of uncertainties and management
oversight; and
- can be applied with immediate effect.

Respite and recovery

A marine reserve is an area closed to all extractive uses, such as
ﬁshing and mining, as well as disposal activities. Marine reserves can
protect near-pristine ecosystems and offer respite to heavily depleted
stretches of ocean, allowing areas to recuperate, recover and
ultimately regain some level of natural resilience. They are pockets of
protection, scientiﬁcally selected and determined, which boost the
overall health of the ocean, not just in the immediate area but across
the wider oceans.

Scientists believe that marine reserves will enable a rapid and long-
lasting increase in abundance, diversity and productivity of organisms
and ecosystems and provide a reduced probability of extinction. This
will mean that they support and beneﬁt adjacent areas and ﬁsheries
outside the reserve because, for example, the ﬁsh within the reserves
increase in size, population and reproductive capacity and ﬁsh, eggs
and larvae ‘spill-over’ into the broader ocean.

The reserves would also beneﬁt highly migratory and endangered
species, such as sharks, tuna and billﬁsh, where the reserves are
created along important migratory routes - for example, around
nursery or spawning grounds or aggregation sites such as
seamounts.

Arguably more importantly, the pockets of protection and resilience
will buffer the entire oceans network against the impact of climate
change.

It is partly with this in mind that networks of marine reserves are
proposed that stretch across the globe. There is increasing evidence
that such networks will be more effective at buffering environmental
variability and providing greater protection for marine communities
than single ones. The World Parks Congress recommended in 2003
that at least 20-30% of marine habitats be included in networks of
marine reserves.

In 2005, the United Nations Millennium Project called for 10% of the
oceans to be covered by marine reserves in the short to medium-
term, with a long-term goal of 30%. A review of 40 studies into the
coverage that is necessary to achieve conservation and ﬁsheries
management goals concludes that 20-50% of the ocean should be
protected13.

Greenpeace advocates that some 40% of marine areas
globally should be designated as fully-protected marine
reserves. Marine reserves offer the highest level of protection
in response to the gravity of the threats our oceans face.
Given the level of uncertainty in determining the effectiveness
of individual ecosystem-based management measures, the
establishment of permanent, legally deﬁned and fully-
protected reserves will be a vital component of implementing
the ecosystem approach while providing immediate respite
and recovery.

We now know that human activity can have serious impacts on the
vital forces governing our planet. We have fundamentally changed
our global climate and are just beginning to understand the
consequences of that.

As yet largely unseen, but just as serious, are the impacts we are
having on the oceans.

We need to defend our oceans because without them, life on Earth
cannot exist.

Dead oceans, dead planet.
