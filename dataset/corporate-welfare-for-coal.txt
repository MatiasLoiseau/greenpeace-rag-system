The biggest coal mining companies depend on subsidized federal coal, 
even as they attack federal climate and clean air policies
For decades, the federal coal program has given coal mining companies access to publicly owned 
coal at subsidized rates, with minimal consideration of the impacts to communities and the envi -
ronment when that coal is mined, transported, and burned. Access to subsidized federal coal led 
to expanded coal mining in Western States, and also encouraged the use of coal generally. Indeed, 
when Interior Secretary Sally Jewell announced a moratorium on new federal coal leasing and a 
comprehensive review of the federal coal program, she acknowledged that in the past, “our practice 
was really about getting as much coal as possible.”1
Whatever logic may have held in the past, a federal program that has flooded the market with sub -
sidized coal is clearly inconsistent with federal policy priorities to address climate change. In that 
regard, the moratorium and review of the federal coal program provide an important opportunity to 
align the management of federal coal with US commitments to reduce carbon pollution and acceler -
ate the transition toward clean energy.
As the federal government and communities impacted by the coal industry reconsider how to man -
age federal coal, it will also be important to recognize the role of the companies that mine federal 
coal. To a significant extent, the federal government has allowed the coal mining industry itself to 
manage the development of federal coal, including key decisions about how much coal to lease and 
mine. In order to address the many problems with the federal coal program, policy makers must 
contend with the impacts of the current corporate control of publicly owned coal.
Access to subsidized federal coal helped some coal mining companies dramatically expand their 
coal production, particularly in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. While sever -
al coal mining companies mine federal coal, three companies in particular dominate federal coal 
production: Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy. In part because of their access to 
subsidized federal coal, these companies have grown to become the three largest coal producers, 
accounting for about 40% of all the coal mined in the US.2
However, because the federal government does not publish details showing the quantity of feder -
al coal produced from each coal mine, or by company, the extent to which these companies de -
pend on federal coal has been less clear. This report reveals federal coal production data obtained 
through a Freedom of Information Act request, and shows that each of these three coal mining 
companies depend on federal coal for the vast majority of the coal they mine in the US. Federal coal 
accounted for 88% of Cloud Peak Energy’s total coal production, 83% of Arch Coal’s, and 68% of 
Peabody Energy’s total 2014 US coal production. Together, federal coal accounted for 77% of these 
three companies’ combined 2014 US coal production.
In effect, these coal mining companies are the beneficiaries of a major corporate welfare program. 
Yet even while they’ve grown from their access to subsidized federal coal, these same companies 
have attempted to position themselves as victims of the federal government, and continue to try 
and block or delay federal policies aimed at addressing climate change and reducing air and water 
pollution. As the largest US coal mining companies, Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak 
Energy have played a major role in this effort against what some in the industry call a “war on coal.”

Peabody Energy in particular has pursued an aggressive strategy, including legal challenges against 
the Clean Power Plan, lobbying, campaign contributions, and misleading public relations efforts. By 
providing subsidized access to federal coal to these companies, the federal government has ulti -
mately helped fuel the coal industry’s attacks on federal climate policy.
The moratorium on new coal leases and comprehensive review of the federal coal program provide 
an important opportunity for policymakers and communities impacted by the coal industry to con -
sider new approaches. Instead of continuing to give the biggest coal mining companies subsidized 
access to billions of tons of publicly-owned coal, the federal government should assert its right – 
and responsibility – as owner of one of the largest coal reserves in the world, and manage federal 
coal in ways that support US efforts to address climate change, consult with communities impacted 
by coal mining and transport, and help ensure a just transition from coal to clean energy.
Most of the coal mined by the three biggest coal companies in the US 
belongs to the American public
The US coal mining industry has fought federal policies aimed at addressing climate change and 
reducing air and water pollution, sometimes using rhetoric characterizing these health and environ -
mental protections as a “war on coal.” Yet what has often been left out of the public debate around 
federal policies affecting the coal industry is that the biggest coal mining companies in the US actu -
ally depend on federal coal for the vast majority of the coal they mine. In fact, federal coal account -
ed for more than three-fourths of the coal mined by the top three coal mining companies in the US, 
Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy. While this coal belongs to the American public 
and is managed by the Interior Department, mining companies have leased billions of tons at subsi -
dized rates through a process that they have largely controlled.
While the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) tracks the quanti -
ty of federal coal mined by each company in order to assess royalties, that information has not 
been made publicly available. This report shows the results of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
request for the quantities of federal coal produced by each coal mining company and subsidiary 
in 2014. We compiled the data from that FOIA request for each company’s subsidiaries, in order to 
calculate the total amount of federal coal mined by Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak 
Energy in 2014. Then we compared those results to the total 2014 coal production from each mine 
operated by those companies and their subsidiaries, as reported by the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration (MSHA), as well as to each company’s total 2014 US coal production as reported in 
company 10-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This provides the first 
detailed assessment of the extent to which major US coal mining companies depend on federal 
coal.
Peabody Energy, the largest US coal mining company, mined a total of 189,500,000 tons of coal in 
the US in 2014, according to the company’s 10-K filing with the SEC. FOIA results show that Pea -
body Energy and its subsidiaries mined 129,313,326 tons of federal coal in 2014, 68% of the com -
pany’s total US coal production.
Arch Coal, the second largest US coal mining company, mined a total of 132,614,000 tons of coal in 
the US in 2014, according to the company’s 10-K filing with the SEC. FOIA results show that Arch 
Coal and its subsidiaries mined 110,132,055 tons of federal coal in 2014, 83% of the company’s 
total.

Cloud Peak Energy, the third largest US coal mining company, mined a total of 85,800,000 tons of 
coal in the US in 2014, according to the company’s 10-K filing with the SEC. FOIA results show that 
Cloud Peak Energy and its subsidiaries mined 75,469,617 tons of federal coal in 2014, 88% of the 
company’s total.
The combined total US coal production in 2014 from these three companies, Peabody Energy, Arch 
Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy, was 407,914,000 tons, which represents over 40% of all the coal 
mined in the US in 2014, 1,000,049,000 tons.3 FOIA results show that these three companies mined 
314,914,998 tons of federal coal in 2014, 77% of their combined total US coal production. FOIA 
results for the three largest companies, organized by subsidiary and parent company, are available 
in Appendix 1.
The FOIA results also include federal coal production data for several other smaller coal mining 
companies, which along with the three largest companies show 407,039,077 tons of federal coal 
mined in 2014. Peabody Energy’s 129,313,326 tons of federal coal production in 2014 repre -
sents 31.8% of that total, while Arch Coal’s 110,132,055 tons was 27%, and Cloud Peak Energy’s 
75,469,617 tons was 18.5% of the total. Combined, Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak 
Energy accounted for 77.3% of the total federal coal production from all companies and subsidi -
aries that were reported in the FOIA results. The full FOIA results, including federal coal production 
data for companies and subsidiaries besides the top three companies that are the focus of this 
report, are available in Appendix 4.

The federal coal mined by the top three coal mining companies in 2014 
will cause $18.8 billion in damages when burned, using the federal 
government’s mid-range social cost of carbon figures
In his January 2016 State of the Union address, President Obama said: 
“Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future -- especially in communities that rely 
on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don’t show them where the trends are going. That’s 
why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better 
reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.”4
Several federal government agencies use the Interagency Working Group’s Social Cost of Carbon 
figures in order to measure the economic damages that will result from one ton of carbon pollution 
in a given year.5 Social cost of carbon figures could be used by the Interior Department to estimate 
the costs of federal coal to “taxpayers and our planet.”
Our 2014 report, Leasing Coal, Fueling Climate Change, showed that the Interior Department has 
leased 2.2 billion tons of federal coal to the mining industry since the beginning of the Obama ad -
ministration, and calculated the carbon pollution and damages to society that will be caused when 
that coal is burned, using the federal government’s social cost of carbon figures.6 The FOIA results 
allow similar calculations of the carbon pollution and damages to society from each company’s 
2014 federal coal production, again using the federal government’s social cost of carbon figures.
The vast majority, 97%, of these three companies’ combined 2014 federal coal production was from 
reserves of sub-bituminous coal in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana, so we use an 
emission factor of 1.659 metric tons carbon dioxide per short ton of coal, the same figure used by 
the Interior Department in its environmental review of a Powder River Basin coal lease.7 We use the 
US Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator to estimate the 
equivalent annual emissions from passenger vehicles.8
Peabody Energy’s 2014 federal coal production of 129,313,326 tons resulted in 214,530,808 metric 
tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of the annual emissions from over 45 million passenger 
vehicles.
Arch Coal’s 2014 federal coal production of 110,132,055 tons resulted in 182,709,079 metric tons of 
carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of the annual emissions from over 38 million passenger vehicles.
 
Cloud Peak Energy’s 2014 federal coal production of 75,469,617 tons resulted in 125,204,095 met -
ric tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of the annual emissions from over 26 million passenger 
vehicles.
Combined, these top three US coal mining companies’ 2014 federal coal production of 314,914,998 
tons resulted in 522,443,982 metric tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of the annual emis -
sions from over 109 million passenger vehicles.
Note that these carbon pollution figures account only for these companies’ federal coal production, 
not the rest of their coal production, and do not include the carbon and methane pollution associat -
ed with the mining, processing, and transporting of the coal.

With these carbon pollution figures for each company’s 2014 federal coal production, we can then 
calculate a monetary value for some of the damages to society using the federal government’s so -
cial cost of carbon figures. The mid-range (3% discount rate) social cost of carbon for a metric ton 
of carbon pollution emitted in 2015 is $36.
The 214,530,808 metric tons of carbon dioxide from Peabody Energy’s 2014 federal coal produc -
tion would amount to $7,723,109,088 ($7.7 billion) in damages to society, using the federal govern -
ment’s mid-range social cost of carbon figures.
The 182,709,079 metric tons of carbon dioxide from Arch Coal’s 2014 federal coal production would amount 
to $6,577,526,844 ($6.5 billion) in damages to society, using the federal government’s mid-range social cost 
of carbon figures.
The 125,204,095 metric tons of carbon dioxide from Cloud Peak Energy’s 2014 federal coal produc -
tion would amount to $4,507,347,420 ($4.5 billion) in damages to society, using the federal govern -
ment’s mid-range social cost of carbon figures.
Combined, the 522,443,982 metric tons of carbon dioxide from these top three US coal mining 
companies’ 2014 federal coal production would amount to $18,807,983,352 ($18.8 billion) in dam -
ages to society, using the federal government’s mid-range social cost of carbon figures. 
The federal government’s social cost of carbon figures also include other cost estimates using 
different discount rates. In addition to the “mid-range” estimate of $36 per ton of carbon dioxide 
emitted in 2015 using a 3% discount rate, estimates include $11 per ton of carbon dioxide (using a 
5% discount rate), $56 per ton (using a 2.5% discount rate), and $105 per ton (using a 3% discount 
rate, 95th percentile). Table 1 shows all of the social cost of carbon estimates for each company’s 
2014 federal coal production, as well as for the combined total federal coal production for all three 
companies and the total federal coal production from all companies reported in the FOIA data.
Table 1: Social Cost of Carbon Damages from Federal Coal Mined in 2014    
Even these billion dollar figures represent only a portion of the damages to society from the mining 
and burning of this publicly-owned coal. First, these figures account only for the federal coal mined 
in a single year, 2014. Moreover, the federal government’s social cost of carbon figures are consid -
ered to be too low by many experts.9 These figures also only account for carbon dioxide emissions

when the coal is burned, not the air and water pollution impacts to communities and the environ -
ment from mercury and other toxins. Even before it is burned, mining and transporting coal disrupts 
communities and damages agricultural and public lands. Finally, after it is burned, coal ash pollution 
threatens the drinking water and safety of communities around the country.
Of course, these damages are borne by communities and the environment, not the companies that 
mine federal coal. As corporations seeking to minimize costs, that is not surprising. But this coal 
belongs to the American public and is managed by the Interior Department, so a thorough consider -
ation of these costs should inform federal coal management decisions. Instead, as the next sections 
summarize, many of the key decisions about the way this publicly owned coal is managed have 
been made by the coal industry, not the federal government.
Federal coal management decisions have been dominated by the coal industry itself  
Even while supplying these top three coal mining companies with the majority of the coal they mine, 
the federal government has provided very little direction or oversight of the way this publicly owned 
coal is managed. The following sections describe a variety of factors that have allowed the feder -
al coal program to be largely run by the coal industry itself, including loopholes within key federal 
rules, coal industry influence on state governments where federal coal is mined, lax management 
by state Bureau of Land Management offices, and a lack of meaningful oversight from Department 
of Interior officials in Washington DC. This is intended as a partial list and summary of some of the 
many problems with federal coal management, and additional details are available in several other 
reports cited below, as well as in the “Further Reading” section at the end of this report.
Decertification of the Powder River Basin as a coal producing region shifted 
management of federal coal to the industry-led “lease by application” process 
One key loophole that has allowed the coal industry to dominate federal coal management deci -
sions is that the Powder River Basin is no longer considered a “coal producing region,” despite 
being the source of about 40% of US coal production. Since the Powder River Basin was decer -
tified as a coal producing region, federal coal has primarily been leased to coal mining companies 
using the “lease by application” process, which gives the industry primary responsibility for deci -
sions about how much, where, and when federal coal should be leased and mined. More details 
about the history and impacts of the decertification decision are available in the Institute for Energy 
Economics and Financial Analysis report, “The Great Giveaway: An analysis of The United States’ 
Long-Term Trend of Selling Federally Owned Coal for Less Than Fair Market Value.”10
Under the “lease by application” process, coal mining companies operating in the Powder River 
Basin typically select coal leases that neighbor their existing mining operations, which are cheap -
er to exploit than would be the case for other coal mining companies. That has contributed to a 
general lack of competition for coal leases, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report 
assessing elements of the federal coal program found that about 90% of the coal leases since 1990 
involved a single bidder (96 of 107 coal lease sales.)11 The 2.2 billion tons of federal coal that have 
been sold since the beginning of the Obama administration under the “lease by application” pro -
cess have averaged $1.03 per ton,12 and in a March 2015 speech, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell 
acknowledged that “most Americans would be surprised to know that coal companies can make a 
winning bid for about a dollar a ton to mine taxpayer-owned coal.”13

Coal leases for particularly polluting lignite are sold for less than one cent per ton
In fact, many coal leases have been sold for much lower amounts, even for less than one cent per 
ton, because state BLM officials have sometimes simply used the minimum price per acre as the 
“fair market value” for minimum bids. The GAO report found that “in North Dakota all successful 
bonus bids were $100 per acre in nominal dollars, the minimum bid BLM can accept for a lease 
tract.” Even though the Interior Department has clear authority to increase minimum bids, the $100 
per acre minimum has not even been adjusted for inflation since it was established in 1982.14 Feder -
al coal lease sales in North Dakota are for lignite, also known as brown coal, so the end result is that 
particularly polluting coal is leased for a fraction of a cent per ton. The most recent federal lignite 
coal lease in North Dakota, in 2010, was sold for $0.005/ton, and the coal lease before that in 2007 
was sold for $0.003/ton.15
Royalty rate reductions further subsidize federal coal production
In addition to coal lease sales, which are primarily managed by the Bureau of Land Management, 
coal mining companies pay royalties, which are managed by the Office of Natural Resources Rev -
enue (ONRR). Under the Mineral Leasing Act, royalty rates for surface mined coal are supposed to 
be a minimum of 12.5%. But in practice, effective royalty rates are much lower because coal mining 
companies are often offered royalty rate reductions. A report by Headwaters Economics found an 
effective royalty rate of just 4.9% for federal coal mined between 2008 and 2012, amounting to an 
average of $1.70 per ton.16 Royalty rate reductions are sometimes approved because of a mining 
company’s “financial hardship,” and the Interior Department’s Inspector General report noted that 
the responsible BLM officials “generally do not have the expertise to evaluate a company’s financial 
statements.”17h
BLM has even proposed royalty rate reduction that would apply retroactively, after the coal has al -
ready been mined. In December 2015, BLM proposed a royalty reduction for 13 million tons of coal 
from a Colorado mine that had already been closed, which would effectively subsidize the mining 
company by lowering royalties from 8% to 5% for coal that had already been mined and sold.18 
After it was publicized, the Interior Department rejected the proposed royalty rate reduction. 19
The coal industry expands access to federal coal with less oversight using lease 
modifications 
While the “lease by application” process has allowed the coal industry to largely control the man -
agement of federal coal, mining companies are also able to expand existing coal mines with even 
less oversight and public participation by using “lease modifications.” While the “lease by appli -
cations” process has been largely uncompetitive, lease modifications allow mining companies to 
expand existing mines without any possibility of competition from other mining companies, minimal 
review, and even lower prices.
Lease modifications have become more important to the coal mining industry since the 2005 En -
ergy Policy Act, which significantly expanded the maximum acreage for lease modifications from 
160 acres to 960 acres. The 2005 Energy Policy Act was influenced by former Vice President Dick 
Cheney’s “Energy Task Force” meetings with energy industry interests, including Peabody Energy20 
and the National Mining Association.21 Before its inclusion in the 2005 Energy Policy Act, the meas -
ure increasing the maximum acreage for lease modifications was introduced by Wyoming’s Sena -
tors22 and Representative23 as part of the “Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 2005.” 

Corporate Welfare for Coal10
greenpeace.org
The Inspector General report raised concerns about lease modifications, and noted that among the 
lease modifications it analyzed, “more than half of the FMVs [fair market value calculations] were for 
$100 per acre (the lowest price allowed by regulation) without adequate supporting documentation 
for this minimal price.”24 The Interior Department does not publish complete records of coal lease 
modifications, and neither did the Inspector General report identifying problems with these under -
valued lease modifications. However, the Inspector General did provide those details in response to 
a request from Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), then-chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Re -
sources Committee. Those details for the 45 lease modifications reviewed by the Inspector General, 
including acreage, tonnage, sales price, date, and lessee, are provided in Table 2 below, along with 
calculations showing the price per ton for each coal lease modification, totals, and averages. The 
original table from the Inspector General’s letter to Senator Wyden is available in Appendix 2. 
These records show that coal mining companies obtained over 192 million tons of federal coal 
through these 45 coal lease modifications, at an average price of $0.16 per ton of coal. Table 2 also 
shows how coal mining companies moved to take advantage of the increased maximum acreage 
limits, beginning with Arch Coal’s 487 acre tract containing 2.3 million tons of coal in 2007. (Arch 
Coal lobbied on the Coal Lease Amendments Act, according to the Center for Responsive Poli -
tics).25 After this, most coal lease modifications were for tracts of land well over the earlier 160 acre 
limit, with 19 of the 25 coal lease modifications (76%) greater than the earlier acreage limit. The 
average acreage for these coal lease modifications increased from 84 to 422 acres, and allowed 
coal mining companies to obtain significantly more federal coal using coal lease modifications and 
thereby minimize oversight, environmental reviews, and competition. Beginning with that first Arch 
Coal lease modification until the end of the Inspector General review period in 2012, mining compa -
nies obtained over 170 million tons of federal coal using coal lease modifications, eight times more 
than the 21 million tons of coal obtained from 2001 until 2007.

Totals for 24 coal lease modifications after increased max acreage 10,127 170,202,000 $29,136,646
Averages for 24 coal lease modifications after increased max acreage 422 $2,877 7,091,750 $1,214,027 $0.17er amounts in other states. While the Interior Department has allowed the coal mining industry to 
largely run the federal coal mining process, state governments have sometimes gone beyond even 
this lax approach. For example, states like Utah 26 and Wyoming 27 have sought to use state funds to 
subsidize coal export proposals in Washington, Oregon, and California that would ship federal coal 
to Asia. 
Another major way that the state of Wyoming has subsidized federal coal mining is by allowing coal 
mining companies to avoid posting bonds to pay for mine reclamation as required by the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Instead, Wyoming’s Department of Environmental Quality 
(DEQ) has allowed coal mining companies to “self-bond,” using their supposed financial strength, or 
even that of a subsidiary, as an indication of the company’s ability to reclaim its mines. One report, 
“Assessing Thermal Coal Production Subsidies,” estimated that self-bonding in the Powder River 
Basin amounted to a subsidy of $0.78 for each ton of coal. 28
This practice of self-bonding has come under increased scrutiny as coal mining companies like Arch 
Coal and Alpha Natural Resources have filed for bankruptcy, raising concerns that taxpayers could 
end up footing the bill for mine reclamation - exactly what the Surface Mining Control and Recla -
mation Act sought to avoid. Secretary Jewell highlighted those concerns in testimony to the House 
Natural Resources Committee: “With the increased financial fragility of many coal mining compa -
nies, if they are self-bonded that does potentially leave the states and the taxpayers at risk.” 29
After acknowledging that Alpha no longer qualified for self-bonding, Wyoming regulators ordered 
the company to post bonds for the $411 million it owes to reclaim its Wyoming mines. But Wyo -
Arch Coal’s bankruptcy has raised concerns about the company’s ability to pay for its reclamation 
obligations at its Black Thunder mine in Wyoming, one of the largest strip mines in the world ©Tim Aubry /Greenpeace

ming’s Governor undermined that effort, and instead announced a deal that would require just $61 
million for the company’s mine reclamation, less than 15% of the company’s obligation. 30 However, 
federal regulators at the Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation Enforcement (OSMRE) did not 
sanction the deal, and notified Wyoming that its deal with Alpha, as well as its failure to require Arch 
Coal to post a sufficient bond for its mine reclamation, may violate the law. 31 In its response to OS -
MRE, Wyoming regulators acknowledged “systemic problems with self-bonding,” yet also rejected 
OSMRE concerns that the deal with Alpha may violate the law. 32 Following its letters to Wyoming, 
OSMRE also notified state regulators in Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico that Peabody Energy 
may no longer qualify for self-bonding. 33
While Wyoming regulators have now acknowledged “systemic problems” with its self-bonding pro -
gram, the state has not suggested how it will address those problems in order to protect taxpayers 
and the environment, even though organizations representing landowners in the region such as the 
Western Organization of Resource Councils have warned the state about these problems for several 
years. In light of the efforts by Wyoming’s Governor and regulators to prioritize the interests of the 
coal industry ahead of other concerns, federal regulators will likely need to increase their involvement 
and intervene to enforce the requirements of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.
More information about coal mine reclamation and problems with self-bonding is available in “Un -
dermined Promise II,” a report by the Western Organization of Resource Councils, National Wildlife 
Federation, and Natural Resources Defense Council. 34
 
Coal companies provide data to the Interior Department about federal 
coal leases, and have significantly underestimated the quantity of coal in 
some leases
Another example of the extent to which the coal industry has dominated federal coal management 
is that coal companies supply the data to the government about the quantity and quality of federal 
coal within lease tracts they hope to mine. And data revealed by the Interior Department’s Inspector 
General show that coal mining companies have significantly underestimated the amounts of coal in 
several cases. For example, as shown in Table 3 below, a coal lease to expand a Peabody Energy 
subsidiary’s mine in Colorado was estimated to contain 1.4 million tons of coal and was sold for 
$350,000, or $0.25 per ton. But Peabody’s subsidiary actually ended up mining more than 2.5 million 
tons of federal coal from that lease, so the lease sale price amounted to just $0.13 per ton.
  
The Inspector General’s report explained the overall concern: 
“Before a lease sale takes place, a mining company explores the site for the existence and extent of 
coal seams, including the energy content and quality of the coal. The mining company is required to 
furnish the information to BLM, which helps form the basis of BLM’s FMV determination. BLM, how -
ever, does not independently verify the data, relying instead on test results supplied by the mining 
company.” 35
The Inspector General’s report also noted that “a company could provide incorrect data to BLM, re -
sulting in BLM’s undervaluing the FMV and unknowingly accepting a low bid.” Although the Inspec -
tor General did not include the data in its report, it did respond to Senator Wyden’s letter with a table 
showing “Coal Leases that May Have Underestimated Reserves at Time of Sale.” The data from that 
table is reproduced below in Table 3, along with additional columns to show the difference (in tons) 
between the amount of coal estimated at the time of the lease sale and the amount of coal actually

mined, as well as to show the impact of these underestimates in terms of the price per ton. Totals 
and averages are also calculated, showing that coal mining companies mined nearly 70 million more tons 
of coal from these 15 coal lease sales than what the companies estimated was contained in them. The original 
table from the Inspector General’s letter to Senator Wyden is available in Appendix 3.

Instead of subsidizing increased coal mining and the coal industry’s 
political attacks, federal coal management should support US efforts to 
address climate change 
While Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy have grown in part because of their ac -
cess to subsidized federal coal, as well as significant control over how federal coal is managed, these 
companies have nevertheless sought to portray themselves as the victims of federal regulations. And 
these companies have led the coal industry’s efforts to block federal climate and clean air policies. 
Peabody Energy and Arch Coal spent more on lobbying than any other coal mining company, 
according to the Center for Responsive Politics.36 
As the largest coal mining company, Peabody Energy in particular has played a central role in the 
coal industry’s attacks, including challenging the Clean Power Plan in court.37 Peabody also contin -
ues to rely on climate change denial38 and other misleading public relations efforts,39 and was recently 
investigated by the New York Attorney General for misleading investors and regulators about the 
risks of climate change policies to its business.40 The coal industry’s efforts to block federal climate 
and clean air policies may not be surprising, but it is noteworthy that these coal industry attacks have 
been partially financed by these companies’ access to subsidized federal coal.
 
Instead of continuing to subsidize increased coal production and the coal industry’s political attacks, 
the Interior Department should realign the management of federal coal by consulting with communi -
ties impacted by coal mining and transport, helping ensure a just transition from coal to clean energy, 
and supporting US commitments to address climate change. A former Interior Department Deputy 
Secretary and a former economic adviser to President Obama have suggested a “carbon adder” 
to incorporate the federal government’s social cost of carbon figures into federal coal management 
decisions and royalty rates.41 Issues surrounding this approach have been studied by the Institute for 
Policy Integrity,42 Vulcan Philanthropy,43 and others. 
Ultimately, federal coal management must be reconciled with the reality that the vast majority of US 
coal reserves cannot be mined and burned. The US holds the largest coal reserves in the world, and 
a study published in Nature44 showed that in order to avoid an increase in global warming above 
2 degrees Celsius, over 90% of US coal reserves must remain in the ground.45 The President and 
Interior Department have clear authority to end new federal coal leasing, which is detailed in a report 
by the Center for Biological Diversity.46 That authority has also been acknowledged by Cloud Peak 
Energy, the company most dependent on federal coal, which warned investors in its 10-K filing with 
the SEC: “There is no requirement that the federal government must lease its coal.”47

Federal coal production data for each company’s subsidiaries are from the results of a Greenpeace FOIA

production figures for Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy come from company 10-K 
filings with the SEC for the year ending December 31, 2014:
Page 34 of Peabody Energy’s 10-K reports a total 2014 coal production of 227.2 million tons, of which 
37.7 million tons was from mines in Australia, for a total US coal production of 189.5 million tons. https://

Page 4 of Cloud Peak Energy’s 10-K reports that the company sold 87.1 million tons of coal in 2014, 
of which 0.2 million was resold coal mined by other companies. 1.1 million tons was from the Deck -
er Mine, which is not included in the company’s total for this report because Cloud Peak held a 
50% interest in the mine, which it sold in September 2014. Excluding those 1.3 million tons, Cloud 
Peak Energy mined a total of 85.8 million tons of coal in 2014. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/
