MAIN CONCLUSIONS

1.  Forest  landscapes  that  are  still  intact  (i.e.  essentially  undisturbed  by  human
development with an area of at least 50,000 hectares) make up about 14 percent (31.7
million  hectares)  of  the  total  forest  area  of  European  Russia  (including  the  Ural
Mountains).  The vast majority of these areas are located in the most remote areas of
the far North.  No intact forest landscapes remain in central and southern European
Russia.

2. The vast majority of these forests (87 percent) have a production potential of less
than 1m3 per hectare per year.

3. Remaining intact forests are poorly stocked. More than half (56 percent) has a
standing inventory of less than 100 m3 per hectare, and almost nowhere is the inventory
greater than 150 m3 per hectare.

4. The areas in the vicinity of the intact forests play a mostly insignificant role in the
wood supply of the region. Less than 5 percent of the volume logged in the Karelia and
Komi Republics, Arkhangelsk and Perm Regions comes from such frontier areas.  Only
in the Arkhangelsk Region is the intensity of logging greater in frontier forests than in
more developed parts - an indication of forest depletion in the latter areas.

5. The poor stocking and slow rate of re-growth make these forests unsuitable for
sustainable  wood  production.  The  necessary  investments  in  road  building  and
reforestation are unlikely to be offset by revenues, especially given the long distance
to the market. Historical precedent in similar areas shows that subsequent investments
in reforestation and silviculture often are insufficient.

6. In the perspective of northern European Russia as a whole, removing intact forest
landscapes from timber production would only factor as a small reduction in the
potential wood supply.  The reduction may be significant, however, for some logging
enterprises located near the intact forest landscapes.

7. Conservation of large intact landscapes is a robust and cost-effective way to
conserve biological diversity. The remoteness and large size of these areas provide the
best guarantee of continued intactness. Far fewer personnel are needed to protect and
manage forests within intact landscapes than are required in developed forest regions.

SUMMARY

Many  people  think  of  the  Russian  taiga  as  an
unlimited  expanse  of  undisturbed  nature.  The  main
purpose of this study was to find out to which extent
this notion is true-to answer such questions as

How should undisturbed nature be defined?

How can undisturbed natural landscapes be
identified?

Where are the remaining intact natural landscapes?

What is the economic importance of these areas?

What is the level of threat?

European  Russia,  including  the  Ural  mountains,  was
systematically studied in order to map remaining large
intact natural forest landscapes. Large was defined as
no smaller than 50,000 hectares in size and at least 10
kilometers in width. One might think of this minimum
area  as  the  size  of  a  square  with  a  side  of  22
kilometers  (although  no  natural  areas  are  shaped  in
this way).

There are three reasons for the focus on large areas.
First,  only  sufficiently  large  areas  are  capable  of

large  animals

in  their
conserving  populations  of
natural,  undisturbed  state,  and  of
letting  natural
ecological processes such as fire, wind throw, etc take
their  course.  Second,  large  undisturbed  areas  are
important  as  a
the
understanding  of  already  disturbed  areas  (the  vast
majority of forest landscapes). Third, large intact areas
are  often  comparatively  cheap  to  conserve,  as  they
tend  to  rely  on  remoteness  and  low  productivity  as
their main sources of protection.

Forest  landscapes  were  mapped.  The  reason  for
mapping landscapes instead of individual ecosystems
is  that  the  boreal  forest
is  a  natural  mosaic  of
integrated  ecosystems,  such  as  forests,  wetlands,
rivers,  lakes,  and  tree-less  areas.  Separating  these
ecosystems  would  not  only  be  difficult  but  also
artificial.

The  goal  was  to  find  forest
landscapes  with  a
minimum of human disturbance. Two things must be
realized: that the boundary of human influence often is
diffuse,  and  that  areas  which  are  strictly  free  from

One of the biggest problems when delineating intact
landscapes  is  the  treatment  of  forest  fires.  Fire  is  a
natural component of the boreal ecosystem but not all
fires occur for natural reasons. Separating fire scars by
cause  is  usually  impossible.  In  this  work  fire  was
treated mainly as an element in the natural dynamics
of the boreal ecosystem. An exception was made for
fire  scars  and  young  regenerated  forests  on  old  fire

infrastructure. Such areas were considered disturbed,
due to the dual likelihood that the fire was caused by
humans and that the infrastructure will be a cause of
future human disturbance.

that  are

A  three-step  procedure  was  used  in  the  search  for
remaining  intact  forest  landscapes.  To  begin  with,
general  geographic  maps  were  used  to  eliminate
obviously disturbed areas (cities, big roads, etc.) and
to  identify  roadless  areas  large  enough  to  meet  the
size  requirement.  In  the  second  phase,  two-season
medium  resolution  satellite  images  from  the  Russia
satellite  Resurs  (the  MSU-SK  scanner  with  a  ground
resolution  of  150  meters  per  pixel)  were  used  to
identify tundra areas and areas with obvious clearcuts,
agricultural  fields,  etc.  In  the  third  and  last  phase,
high-resolution  Landsat  and  analogous  satellite
images  (ground  resolution  typically  30  meters  per
pixel)  were  used  to  identify  additional  disturbances
and  to  draw  the  final  boundaries  of  remaining  intact
landscapes. This approach was used because Landsat
images  could  not  be  acquired  for  the  entire  area  of
study for budgetary reasons and for lack of availability
in some areas.

Field expeditions were carried out in order to assess
the  actual  level  of  disturbance  on  the  ground  in
difficult  areas,  and
the
interpretation  of  the  satellite  images.  A  total  of  67
areas  were  inspected.  Many  of  the  field  expeditions
included  the  people  who  were  directly  engaged  in
interpretation of the satellite images.

The  result  shows  that  only  14  percent  (32  million
hectares) of the forest area in European Russia remain
in large blocks of intact nature. All of these areas are in
the remote far north with the exception of a few large
peat  bogs.  In  the  rest  of  European  Russia,  and  very
likely in Europe as a whole, large intact natural forest
landscapes no longer exist.

Remaining  intact  landscapes  tend  to  be  remote,
unproductive  and  poorly  stocked  in  comparison  to
what
levels  for
sustainable  forestry.  According  to  the  official  forest
map  of  the  Russian  Federation,  87  percent  of  the
intact area has an average production of less than 1m3
of stemwood per hectare and year. More than half of
the  area  has  less  than  100m3  per  hectare  in  mature
forest  and  almost  nowhere  is  the  inventory  greater
than 150 m3 per hectare. It is interesting to note that
the  Swedish  Forestry  Act  puts  all
land  with  a
productivity  less  than  1m3  of  stemwood  per  hectare
and year off limits to forestry.

To  level  of  threat  to  the  remaining  intact  forest
landscapes was assessed by studying the intensity of
logging around their borders during the peak logging
season  of  1999-2000.  Pairs  of  satellite  images  were
used for this study, which showed that more than 95
percent of the wood in the Karelia and Komi Republics
and in the Perm Oblast came from already disturbed
areas,  and  about  90  percent  in  Archangelsk  region.
Only  in  the  Arkhangelsk  Region  was  the  logging
intensity greater near the intact areas than in the more
developed parts - an indication of forest depletion in
the latter areas.

The forestry significance of the remaining intact forest
landscapes  is  low.  Withdrawing  these  areas  from
timber  production  would  only  factor  as  a  small
reduction  in  the  potential  wood  supply,  seen  in  the
perspective of northern European Russia as a whole.
For  some  local  logging  enterprises,  however,  the
reduction may be significant.

Conservation of large intact natural forest landscapes
is an important and necessary component of a general
conservation strategy, but it is not by itself sufficient.
Many ecosystems have already been disturbed to the
point  where  only  small  fragments,  or  nothing  at  all,
remains.  Mapping  of  these  ecosystem  residuals  was
outside the scope of this study but is an important task
for the future.

Taiga - vast, uninterrupted forests, unpassable ancient remoteness, an
absence of human dwellings over a great expanse
V.I. Dal. Dictionary of the Living Russian Language (1903)

The  boreal  region  of  European  Russia  used  to  be
regarded  as  a  virtually  unlimited  storehouse  of  forest
riches,  developed  or  used  only  to  a  small  extent  and
largely still "wild." It is still commonly thought that northern
European Russia is dominated by old-growth forests and
wilderness
landscapes.  However,  even  a  preliminary
assessment shows that the remaining undeveloped parts
of  the  taiga  are  relatively  small  and  rapidly  diminishing
(McCloskey,  Spalding,  1989;  Bryant  et  al.,  1997).
Protecting those sections of the taiga landscape that are
still  intact  is  therefore  a  priority  issue  for  the  coming
decades. A more detailed assessment begun at the end of
the
environmental
organizations (Aksenov et al., 1999) confirmed that most
of the boreal area of Russia has been subjected to severe
fragmentation or fundamental transformation as the result
of human development.

This  work  is  the  first  attempt  to  identify
remaining  intact  boreal  forest  of  northern
European  Russia  using  high-resolution
satellite  imagery  that  allows  most  forms  of
human disturbance in natural ecosystems to
be directly identified.

The taiga, in the broad sense of the word, consists of an
entire complex of very diverse natural ecosystems located
in  regions  dominated  by  boreal  forests.  Bogs,  lakes,
rivers, flood meadows, mountain tundra, rocky outcrops,
rich  tree  stands  and  other  various  types  of  vegetation

variety  of  ways.  A  delineation  of  intact  taiga  that  limits
itself to the forest, without considering other pieces of the
larger  landscape,  is  artificial  and,  in  the  opinion  of  the
authors, incorrect. The heavily bog-dominated landscapes
of  Russia’s  northernmost  boreal  region,  in  which  forest
land is sometimes no more than 20-30 percent of the total
area, are no less a part of the taiga than the uninterrupted
forests  on  the  well-drained  water  divides  to  the  south.
Equally  important  components  are  the  complexes  of
mountains, lakes, bogs, and forests of the Baltic Shield.
To separate these areas from the forest when identifying
intact areas would be totally artificial.

In  the  context  of  this  work  we  use  the  term  intact  forest
landscape to mean entire taiga landscapes, only marginally
disturbed  by  human  activities,  and  without  regard  to  the
share  of  forest  in  these  landscapes.  By  disturbance  we
mean the direct destruction or fundamental transformation
of any particular ecosystem including the fragmentation of
natural  areas  by
the
connections between a particular ecosystem and the other
components of the taiga landscape. Thus, by intact forest
landscape  we  understand  a  seamless  whole  of  natural
ecosystems,  undivided  by  elements  of  infrastructure,  in
which there are no visible signs of significant human activity.
This work is an attempt to identify and delineate intact areas
of  at  least  50,000  hectares  with  a  width  no  less  than  10
kilometers.

infrastructure,  which  disturbs

Before proceeding we should mention a fundamental fact:
forests that are absolutely wild and completely unaffected
by human development activities no longer exist anywhere
in the world. All present day forests display some degree of
influence of human civilization, if only from transboundary
air pollution or hunting.  Ancient forms of human economic
activity and land uses such as hunting, clearing of meadows
in the vicinity of small rivers, and shifting cultivation, existed
and  were  fairly  widely  spread  over  the  boreal  region  of
European  Russia  since  the  end  of  the  last  glaciation.
Because these disturbances have a longer history than the
current landscapes, we view these activities, as well as the
fires  directly  associated  with  them,  not  as  anthropogenic
disturbances but rather as anthropogenic factors that have
formed  the  ecosystems.  On  the  other  hand,  modern
development activities  are of such form and intensity as to
create major disturbances in centuries-old equilibrium and

destruction of the natural taiga landscape. In this work, all
human  background  disturbances  that  were  considered

the course of millennia, as well as some current or recent

list

The  mission  of  this  work  was  to  search  the
boreal  part  of  European  Russia  for  remaining
large areas undisturbed by human development
activities.  Areas, which in essence retain their
natural characteristics.

The  authors  used  the  same  approach  throughout  the
researched  area,  trying  at  each  step  to  be  very  clear  in
formulating principles and criteria used. The investigation
reveals that remaining intact forest landscapes cover only a
small part of northern European Russia (16.3 percent of the
investigated  region,  and  13.8  percent  of  the  entire  forest
zone). All these areas could, and probably should, become
part of the protected areas network of the north, given their
capacity  to  serve  as  reference  areas  while  independently
sustaining their ecological integrity. In this work, the authors
have  not  attempted  to  suggest  any  concrete,  formal
protection  scheme  for  any  or  all  of  the  delineated  areas.
This  is  a  task  for  the  future.  For  the  present,  the  most
reasonable, in the mind of the authors, would be to reserve
industrial
these  areas  by  excluding  them  from  any
development  or  construction  of
infrastructure  until
comprehensive decisions on their value and future destiny
can be made in a complete and competent manner.

The  southern  edge  of  the  taiga  was  formed  by  natural

Russia’s taiga as a whole is a complex mosaic of different
the
ecosystems.  Forests  do  not  always  dominate
landscape. Many areas are primarily bogs, sparse forest,
mountain  tundra,  and  other  non-forest  ecosystems.  The
dominance  of  conifers  in  the  older  forests  is  absolute.
Conifer  forests  -  mostly  Scots  Pine  and  Norway  Spruce
and to a much lesser extent Larch and Siberian Stone Pine
-  account  for  no  less  than  77  percent  of  the  total  forest
area (Lesnoi Fond ..., 1999). However, these official data
overestimates the share of conifers. For example, before
the  1995  Forest  Inventory  Instruction  was  issued,  all
forests with a share of conifers greater than 0.4 by volume
were  classified  as  coniferous,  even  if  dominated  by
deciduous  trees.  The  same  was  true  for  all  coniferous
forest plantations, even when overgrown by fast-growing
deciduous  species  (Instruktsiya  po  (cid:133).,  1986).  Forests
dominated by birch and aspen account for 23 percent of
the  total  area,  according  to  the  official  forest  inventory.
These  are  mostly  rela-
tively  young  secondary
forests on logging sites,
sometimes also on bur-
ned  areas.  A  small

THE LAST INTACT FOREST LANDSCAPES OF NORTHERN EUROPEAN RUSSIA

The examined territory can be divided into the following main parts, based on natural
forest vegetation characteristics:

The Baltic shield (1) is dominated by pine forests. These
stands grow on outcrops of crystalline rock or sandy glacial
sediments which were formed during the latter stages of the
last glacial retreat. There is also an abundance of bogs and
lakes  which  in  the  north  form  a  complex  mosaic  within
mountainous  areas.  The  landscape  dynamics  of  the  Baltic
shield is strongly influenced by forest fires. These fires are
frequent  but  usually  small-scale  and  rather  weak  ground
fires  due  mainly  to  the  pronounced  fragmentation  of  the
topography. The area of the Baltic shield is clearly defined on
forest maps by the dominance of pine forest (see Figure 4).

The  western  slopes  of  the  Ural  Mountains  (2)  are
characterized by substantial amounts of precipitation, many
days  with  cloudy  and  foggy  weather,  and  high  levels  of
wintertime  snow  accumulation.  This  area  is  dominated  by
Spruce-Fir  and  Spruce-Fir-Siberian  Stone  Pine  forests,
historically only marginally affected by fire and in many cases
not showing any signs of fire influence at all. On forest maps
this territory is clearly visible as a uniform spruce-dominated
forest,  although  the  southern  part  is  now  dominated  by
birch-aspen  and  mixed  coniferous-birch-aspen  forests
following clear-cutting.

more  broken  topography  in  comparison  with  the  western
slopes. The eastern slopes also differ significantly in forest
composition and fire characteristics, and are dominated by
fire-influenced  coniferous  forests  in  a  way  similar  to  the
Baltic  shield  (mainly  pine
forests,  but  often  with  a
considerable fraction of Siberian Stone Pine and larch).

The  valleys  of  large  rivers  and  the  wide  fluvioglacial
depressions (4) support dry pine forests and very frequent
fires,  much  like  the  Baltic  crystalline  shield.  The  high
frequency of fires is connected partly with the dominance of
sandy  sediment  in  the  soil,  but  also  linked  with  historic
disturbance as the large river valleys and forested lowlands
were the first parts of the taiga to be colonized by people.

The  morainic  plains  (5)  account  for  the  major  portion  of
the studied territory. In the past, these areas had a relatively
low  human  population  density,  and  the  least  developed
transportation infrastructure. In the northern part of the taiga
most  of  these  watersheds  are  characterized  by  extensive
amounts  of  bogs,  sometimes  to  the  extent  that  open  bogs
and low-productive bog forests dominate them. It is in these
least accessible and least productive areas that we find most
of the remaining intact forests.

The  eastern  slopes  of  the  Ural  Mountains  (3)  are
characterized by significantly less precipitation and usually a

Timan  ridge  (6)  interrupts  these  relatively  uniform  plains
with more diverse vegetation.

THE LAST INTACT FOREST LANDSCAPES OF NORTHERN EUROPEAN RUSSIA

The taiga of European Russia is commonly considered to
have  pronounced  zonal  characteristics.  Nevertheless,
there are no well-defined boundaries between subtundra,
northern,  middle,  and  southern  taiga.  Variances  within
zones  -  depending  on  geology,  macrorelief  and  quater-
nary  deposits  -  are  often  much  greater  than  differences
between  zones.  Furthermore,  existing  evidence  concer-
ning  the  distribution  of  tree  species  in  European  Russia
during  different  stages  of  the  Holocene  shows  that  the
current  relatively  pronounced  division  of  the  forest
composition
is  a  recent  phenomenon  -
probably  to  a  significant  degree  the  effect  of  a  zonal
distribution of human economic activity. Today, the natural
structure of the forest cover of European Russia is overlaid
by  a  spatial  structure  that  reflects  the  pattern  of  forest
management  and  harvesting.  The  differences  between
stands  of  secondary  forest  that  can  be  traced  back  to
specific forms and techniques of logging are often greater
than the differences between the zones of the taiga.

into  zones

A  significant  part  of  the  taiga  has  been  subject  to  the
indirect  influence  of  humans  during  the  entire  history  of
their  development.  Fires  have  occurred  much  more
frequently than they would if lightning had been the only
cause.  Lands  have  been  periodically  cleared
for
agriculture. Hunting and fishing have affected the popu-
lation density of many species. And the list continues.

Practically all taiga territory of European Russia
has  at  some  point  been  affected  by  human
economic  activity,  either  directly  or  indirectly.
Such disturbances include burning and shifting
cultivation, hunting, harvesting and expansion of
meadows  along  rivers,  tree  cutting,  and  air
pollution.  The  areas  chosen  as  references  for
intact natural taiga are not absolutely "wild" or
"virgin,"  but  rather  those  areas  where  human
disturbance has been and remains minimal.

"non-perspective"  villages  (see  Figures  9  and  10).
Much of the mountainous northern taiga was used
until  fairly  recently  as  the  main  fodder  base  for
reindeer  herding.    During  the  last  two  centuries
practically the entire territory was subjected to the
influence  of  industrial  logging,  although  this  was
dispersed over large areas and oriented towards the
extraction  of  high-value  trees  through  selective
cutting  (Denisov,  1911;  Bogouslovskiy,  1912;
Kublitskiy-Piottykh,  Nazarov,  1913;  Faas,  1922).
The few places that escaped such logging include a
handful of areas within the Pechora basin as well as
some  of  the  wettest  parts  of  the  greatest  water
divides of the North. Thus, the taiga, even in parts

complex conglomerate of natural and human influences -
intact,  but  showing  clear  indications  of  having  been
subject to traditional human influences on nature.

Modern economic activities, especially industrial logging,
the  development  of  transportation  infrastructure,  and
mining  have  very  little  in  common  with  traditional  low-

influence  on  the  taiga.

THE NATURAL DYNAMICS OF TAIGA FORESTS

"Dynamics  of  random  disturbances"  is  a  phrase  that
denotes  a  whole  set  of  natural  mechanisms  that  allow
forests to maintain themselves over long periods of time.
The essence of the concept of random disturbances is as
follows:  a  natural  forest,  having  developed  without  any
catastrophic  human  disturbances  during  many  tree
generations,  is  a  complex  mosaic  of  small  (in  relation  to
the  size  of  the  area  as  a  whole)  patches,  which  develop
without  synchronization.  The  tree  stand  on  any  of  these
small  patches  will  sooner  or  later  die,  for  a  variety  of
reasons  of  a  more  or  less  random  nature,  thus  yielding
space  to  a  new  generation  of  trees.  The  reasons  for  the
death of a forest patch under natural conditions may vary
considerably  and  include  fires,  pest  outbreaks,  disease,
extreme  weather  conditions,  or  ageing.  Different  causes

are connected with different sizes of the affected part of
the  stand,  from  the  size  of  an  individual  tree  up  to
hundreds or thousands of hectares.  Each large block of
natural  taiga  consists  of  hundreds  or  thousands  of  such
parts,  each  of  which  is  developing  according  to  its  own
progression depending on the type of disturbance and the
time  when  it  took  place.  This  cyclic  flow  allows  a  taiga
block as a whole to be in a condition close to equilibrium
and maintain itself for an unlimited amount of time.

Russia’s intact taiga has two main types of random distur-
bances  dynamics  which  are  of  particular  importance:
dynamics  associated  with  the  development  of  a  tree
population without any catastrophic disturbances (gap or
tree-fall  dynamics)  and  dynamics  associated  with  the
effect of fires (pyrogenic or fire dynamics).

GAP DYNAMICS

equilibrium.  This happens as stands with a more uniform
structure due to some past disturbance, usually fire, start
to collapse.  Such stands are dominated by one or another
tree  generation  and  even  in  density  so  that  gaps  that
appear are rather large as clusters of trees of similar age
die and fall at the same time.

Gap  dynamics  is  associated  with  the  death  of
individual  old  trees  or  tree  groups,  causing
openings (gaps) to appear in the canopy, letting
in light and giving smaller trees the possibility to
grow and assume a place in the stand.

(spruce  and  spruce-fir

Gap  dynamics  is  a  basic  natural  mechanism  for  self-
maintenance of taiga forests, developed over the course
of many tree generations in the absence of catastrophic
influences,  and  most  characteristic  of  dark
external
coniferous
forests,
sometimes with Siberian Stone Pine mixed in and usually
with a component of birch). Gap dynamics is associated
with the death of individual old trees, causing openings to
appear  in  the  canopy,  letting  in  light  and  giving  smaller
trees  the  possibility  to  grow  and  assume  a  place  in  the
stand (see Figure 11). At equilibrium, old trees die more or
less evenly spread over the forest and over time. A stand
will develop in which trees of all ages are present and the
age  distribution  of  woody
species  will  be
that  of  a
sustainable  population.  The
younger  trees  will  be  the  most
numerous, while older trees will
be gradually less numerous with
increasing  age  (see  Figure  12).
Forests  with  equilibrium  gap
dynamics  are  very  robust  over
time.  In  the  taiga  of  European
Russia such forests are typically
rather  open  with  an  abundance
of  gaps  in  the  crown  layer  (see
Figure
Forests  with
equilibrium  gap  dynamics  are
very  rare  and  it  is  much  more
common to find forests in which
gap  dynamics  have  begun  to
appear  but  not  yet  reached

without  catastrophic  disturbances  for  at  least  a  few
hundred years. Such forests are less typical of the plains
of European Russian taiga where they usually appear as
pockets in a much larger forest with evident signs of some
relatively  recent  catastrophic  disturbance  such  as  fire.
These  pockets  are  generally  small  in  size  (from  tens  of
hectares up to a few hundred or thousands of hectares).
In  most  cases  on  the  flatlands,  gap  dynamics  are
associated  with
the
floodplains of rivers, along creeks and where ground water
comes close to the surface. However, pockets also exist
on well-drained slopes and elevations where for centuries
they have avoided the effects of fire.

the  moistest  areas,  such  as

Forests with gap dynamics have a large accumulation of
dead wood on the ground, and of dead organic matter in
the soil. They also have a special soil profile, formed as a
result of the continuous falling of old trees along with their
root systems. This gives them a higher soil water retention
capacity and a lower amount of surface run-off during the
spring thaw and heavy rains and, as a consequence, a less

Forests  with  clearly  developed  gap  dynamics  make  up
only a small part of the total forest area of the European
North of Russia.  This is also true for the intact forest areas
examined in this work.  Gap dynamics are most common
in forests on the moist western slopes of Urals, where they
locally  dominate  the  structure  of  the  taiga  landscape.
Here, one can find the greatest areas of forests with gap
dynamics  at  an  absolute  equilibrium,  having  developed

and 15), and their disappearance as a result of selective
cutting of the largest trees may considerably disturb the
natural regenerative dynamics of these forests.

The  particular  characteristics  of  gap  dynamics  are
regulated  by  various  processes  in  the  forest  ecosystem
and  also  by  some  external  factors.  Wood  decomposing
fungi, for example, by lowering the mechanical strength of
trees and eventually causing old trees to fall down or be
broken by wind or snow, sometimes while still fully alive,
are usually the main regulators of the tree life span in such
forests. By determining tree longevity, wood decomposing
fungi have a strong indirect influence on the pace of tree
generation change and the size of individual canopy gaps,
and  also  contribute  to  the  occurrence  of  large  areas  of
wind-fall.  Extreme  weather  conditions  may  encourage
mass
insects,  decimating
sizable areas and thus producing particularly large gaps.

FIRE DYNAMICS

Fire dynamics is the main mechanism for rejuvenation of
the  taiga  forests  in  the  examined  areas.  Despite  the
existence and even firm documentation of individual cases
in  which  forest  fires  have  occurred  due  to  lightning,  this
forest  rejuvenation  mechanism  must  not  be  regarded  as
entirely natural. The overwhelming majority of fires in taiga
forests  of  European  Russia  are  related  to  human
economic  activity,  as  evidenced  by  many  historic  and
contemporary studies. In fact, not even in 1999, a year of
extremely  dry  conditions  and  many  fires,  did  any  fires
occur within the remaining intact (unpopulated, and very
rarely visited by people) forest areas that was detectable
in high-resolution satellite images. At the same time, the
number of forest fires exceeded practically all previously
recorded  levels  in  areas  with  dense  population  and  a
dense transportation network.

Forest  fires  have  always  accompanied  the  economic
activities  of  people,  and  people  have  lived  in  the  taiga

Fire or pyrogenic dynamics are associated with the
periodic  partial  or  total  burning  of  a  forest  as  a
result either of natural causes or human activities
and the establishment of a new tree generation on
the cleared area.

almost from the very time it was formed. The main cause
of fire was shifting (slush-and-burn) cultivation, existing in
Northern European Russia up until the end of the 1930’s,
in which the farmer would move to a new spot every few
years and clear it by means of fire (see Figure 16). Given
the fact that people have been setting fires for the entire

14

THE LAST INTACT FOREST LANDSCAPES OF NORTHERN EUROPEAN RUSSIA

period  during  which  the  taiga  forests  were  formed,  it  is
reasonable  to  regard  fires  associated  with  low  intensity
human  management  as  an  ancient  semi-natural
mechanism  for  shifting  tree  generations  in  taiga  forests
(this excludes such frequent or catastrophic fires that are
associated with the modern development of the taiga and
upset the fire structure that has shaped these landscapes
for centuries).

There is a big difference between forests that have been
subject  to  frequent  fires  over  a  long  period  of  time,  and
forests  that  have  only  experienced  occasional  fires
separated  by  centuries  of  "fire-free"  natural  dynamics.
Exposure to periodic fires for centuries or millennia favors
so called "light" (fire-dependent) coniferous taiga forests
in  which  pine  (everywhere)  and  larch  (in  the  north-east)
species  dominate.    The  light  coniferous  taiga  is  most
typical  for  the  Baltic  Shield  encompassing  Karelia
Republic, Murmansk and western Leningrad Regions, and
also on sandy sediments of the lowlands and along large
rivers.  For  pine  and  larch,  fresh  fire  scars  and  forests
affected  by  ground  fires  provide  optimal  conditions  for
establishment and development of new tree generations.
Mature  pines  and  larches  are  capable  of  surviving  even
severe ground fires (see Figure 17 and 19).

Seeds  of  pine  and  larch  are  rather  heavy,  however,  and
don’t  spread  very  far  with  the  wind  -  usually  a  hundred
meters  at  the  most.
  When  fires  occur  only  very
occasionally and new fire scars are several kilometers or
more apart from older ones, other pioneer species such
as birch and aspen, which have seeds capable of travelling
further  or  which  naturally  are  part  of  the  forest  even

Fig.  16.  Slash-and-burn  agriculture  had  significant
influence on the dynamics of taiga forest. This influence is
not limited to areas of current cultivation, but extends over
large areas affected by previous cultivation and occasional
escaped  fires.  At  any  particular  time,  the  affected  area
could  exceed  the  current  cultivated  area  tens  or  even
hundreds  of  times.  Significant  parts  of  the  southern  and
middle  taiga  were  affected  by  slash  and  burn  cultivation.
With  a  low  population  density,  influence  was  concentrated
mainly around the most suitable areas, while remote forests
were  affected  to  a  lesser  degree  or  escaped  cultivation
altogether.

without  any  fire,  will  dominate  the  post-fire  succession.
Abundant  growth  of  birch  and  aspen  on  fire  scars  is
common  on  the  wide  water  dividers,  where  fires  used  to
occur  more  seldom  and  most  sources  of  pine  and  larch
seeds  (if  they  were  present  at  all)  have  been  cut  down
during the last century and a half (see Figure 18).

Taiga forests that are more or less periodically exposed to
fires have the following characteristics:

1.  A  mosaic  of  parts  that  have  been  subject  to  different
frequencies,  intensities,  and  types  of  fire  (ground  fires,
which burn only the organic layer of the ground and fallen
branches,  and  crown  fires,  which  burn  the  entire  stand
either  superficially  or  totally).  The  effect  of  the  fire
determines  the  structure  and  dynamics  of  the  forest,
including  age  structure,  the  intensity  of  tree  death,  the
amount of fallen trees and organic debris on the ground,
and the composition and structure of the lower layers of
the  forest.  The  type  and  frequency  of  fire  determines
whether  even-aged  forests  with  homogeneous  structure
or  multi-aged  forests  consisting  of  several  different  tree
generations will be formed (see Figures 17 and 19). These
forests  are  complex  mosaics  of  parts  that  have  burned
with  different  frequency,  which  also  contain  fire  refuges
(i.e.  pockets  in  the  forest  which,  for  some  reason  or
another,  have  escaped  fires  for  centuries  and  therefore
display a gap structure of the stand).

2. A broken age structure for the dominating tree species.
At  the  most  fire  prone  sites,  stands  of  pine  or  larch
develop  containing  several  clearly  distinguishable  tree
generations, each of which was established after a ground
fire. On sites that have been without fire for a long time, a
secondary layer of spruce will develop. This will typically
consist of groups of trees established over a rather brief
period of time, usually 60-80 years. Even at sites that have
escaped  fires  for  a  very  long  time  (200-250  years  and
more),  where  spruce  is  often  the  dominating  species  in
the  stand,  the  age  structure  of  the  spruce
is  not
continuous in the way that a sustainable population would
be.  Such spruce stands are only partially mixed ages.

The  deciduous  species  in  these  forests  (birch,  aspen,
goat willow) in most cases grow in stands with an uneven
age distribution, typically with a few clearly distinguishable
tree generations.

Republic, Kostomuksha Nature Reserve. Photo: V. Kantor.

3.  A  presence  of  downed  trees  of  different  diameters,
unevenly  distributed  over  the  area  as  well  as  through
stages of decomposition. Pine or larch typically account
for most of the large-diameter fallen trees. Only on sites
that  have  escaped  fire  long  enough  to  establish  gap
dynamics is it possible to find downed spruce.

4. An absence of a thick organic layer, except for on wet
sites, and a rather small amount of organic debris on the
forest  floor,  except  for  those  sites  that  are  part  of  a  fire
refuge.  The  soil  profile  is  more  flat  and  less  developed
than  in  the  typical  forests  with  gap  dynamics.  This  is
connected with the fact that many trees die and gradually
decompose  "on  the  stump"  instead  of  falling  along  with
their  root  systems.  Overall,  these  forests  have  a  much
smaller  capacity  for  retaining  moisture  than  forests  with
clearly developed gap dynamics.

5. The process of old trees dying is very different within
various  parts  of  the  forest,  and  is  regulated  by  several
factors  in  concert:  with  the  effect  of  fires  (including
superficial ground fires, which cause trees that are weak
or more harmed by fire to dry out), the death of old and
weak  trees  from  pests  and  diseases,  and  the  effect  of
extreme weather conditions (drought, which is especially
significant on sites with a thin layer of organic matter).

Modern forest management leads to significant changes
in  forests  with  strong  fire  influences.  Fires  that  develop
around clearcuts and roads fundamentally alter structures

which  have  occurred  over  millennia  as  a  result  of
dispersed human activity and lightning. It is also clear that
any attempt at dividing fires into "natural" and "unnatural"
is artificial, because it is rarely possible to tell the origin of
a  fire  from  the  character  of  a  fire  scar.  A  discussion  and
description of formal criteria for separating "natural" fires,
those not regarded as affecting the natural dynamics of a
taiga  forest  ecosystem,  from  "unnatural"  fires  that  are
seen  as  a  human  disturbance  of  natural  dynamics,  is
provided  in  the  section  Identification  and  mapping  of

SECONDARY FORESTS

  There

The  overwhelming  majority  of  taiga  forests  in  European
Russia  have  been  severely  altered  in  terms  of  structural
and dynamic organization and are therefore classified as
secondary forests. However, determining the exact share
of secondary forest is difficult, especially in the absence of
firm  criteria  for  classification  of  primary  and  secondary
stands.
is  no  consensus  on  the  stages  of
restoration after a disturbance in which a forest should be
classified as secondary, or to what extent a forest that has
been  disturbed  by  selective  cutting  should  be  called
secondary.  There are some fairly universal agreements -
the  first  forest  generation  on  a  clearcut,  on  abandoned
agricultural  land,  or  on  a  quarry  are  all  regarded  as
interpretation  of

secondary is used, it is clear that secondary forests form
the  general  background  condition  in  the  taiga,  with  the
exception  only  of  the  northernmost  part  of  the  territory.
While  primary  stands  of  indigenous  old-growth  can  be
found  selectively  scattered,  a  sea  of  secondary  forest
surrounds them.

  Even

Secondary  forests  are  very  diverse,  not  only  because  of
site differences but also due to variations in their history of
human  intervention.  Still,  it  is  possible  to  identify  a  few
typical  characteristics  that  distinguish  them  from  intact
taiga.

First  and  foremost,  severe  anthropogenic  disturbances,
leading to the death of the stand either in substantial parts
or
its  entirety,  create  stands  with  a  significantly
simplified  spatial  structure.    The  least  architecturally

In Karelia, two-thirds of the forested area was harvested
during the second half of the twentieth century (Gromtsev,
2000), with the situation in other regions more or less the
same.  Already  at  the  latitude  of  the  Leningrad,  Vologda,
and Kirov Regions, spontaneously reforested agricultural
lands, abandoned during the period of collectivization and
later,  represent  a  significant  share  of  the  forest,  and
further south it may represent as much as 20-30 percent
of  the  total  forest  area.  Taking  all  of  this  together,  a
conservative  estimate  finds  secondary  forest  makes  up
three-quarters  of  the  forested
in  the  taiga  of
European  Russia.  With  inclusion  of  even-aged  spruce
forests, formed as a consequence of selective cutting of
pine (see Figure 26) or even-aged stands on gigantic fire
scars, the share of secondary forest becomes even larger.

add some complexity to the structure and composition of
the new forest (Figure 21, b).

The  evenness  in  structure  and  age  is  often  carried  over
into the first re-growth layer, appearing under the canopy
of pioneer deciduous species (see Figure 21, c). Intensive
selective  cutting  in  which  all  large-dimension  trees  are
removed  and  mainly  only  undergrowth  is  retained  also
lead to the creation of simplified stands (Figure 21, d).  In
intact forests the main elements of spatial diversity of the
stand  and  other  forest  layers  at  a  particular  site  are
connected  with  natural  spontaneous  disturbances;  in
secondary  forests  they  are  most  often  generated  by
diversity  of  technical  interventions  such  as  skid  lines,
landings  and  roads  (Pautov,  1992;  Yaroshenko  et  al.,
1998).

inarguably  secondary

The  majority  of
forests  are
characterized  by  a  considerable  mixture  of  pioneer
deciduous  tree  species  (birch,  aspen,  Gray  Alder,  Goat
Willow),  the  seeds  of  which  are  easily  carried  over  large
distances by the wind and the seed production of mature
trees is very large. Forests with an absolute domination of
pioneer  deciduous  species  are  especially  typical  of  the
large  (landscape  size)  clearcuts  of  the  1950’s  through
1980’s. Then, the living conditions (microclimate, ground
cover,  etc.)  of  the  trees  were  radically  changed,  while  at
the same time practically all sources of coniferous seeds
were removed.

The  simplified  and  homogeneous  stand  structure
in
secondary forests is associated with significant changes
in  other  forest  layers.  Many  microhabitats  disappear
under the forest canopy, such as fallen trees and features
of  micro-topography,  formed  when  trees  fall  over  along
with  their  root  systems.  Also,  the  mosaic  of  gaps  and
illumination under the canopy is simplified. The result is a
drastic reduction in the diversity of ecological conditions
under  the  canopy,  impoverishing  the  local  flora  and
causing the gradual disappearance of individual species.
It has been established that the disappearance of at least
some species is connected not so much with the dramatic
changes  in  ecological  conditions  that  occur  during  the
first  years  after  a  radical  disturbance  as  with  the
simplification  of  the  habitat  diversity  that  follow  the
establishment of a closed secondary stand (Yaroshenko,
et  al.,  1998).  The  restoration  of  the  original  structure  of
grasses  and  mosses  is  delayed  in  a  similar  fashion  in
comparison  with  the  re-establishment  of  the  original
structure  of  the  tree  layer.  Many  forests  in  which  the
original  stand  structure  has  been  restored  following
radical  anthropogenic  disturbances  may  still  hold  some
characteristics  typical  of  secondary  forests  such  as  the
layer of grasses and mosses. We conclude that an assess-
ment  limited  to  the  tree  layer  does  not  allow  a  full
measurement of the degree of anthropogenic disturbance
in  a  forest  ecosystem  or  the  degree  to  which  its  natural
structural and dynamic organization has been restored.

Human
influence  on  the  northern  forests  of  Russia
developed  in  two  key  stages,  divided  by  the  advent  of
intensive industrial growth.  In time, the boundary between
is  fluid,  shifting  between  regions  that  are
the  two
populated and close to big markets to those more remote.
In some pockets, development began in the 17th and 18th
centuries in connection with industrial production of salt,
charcoal and other goods. However, most of the area saw
little  growth  until  the  middle  of  the  19th  century,  when
wood exports from the northern ports to Europe fueled a
rapid expansion.

Despite  the  influence  of  pre-industrial  human

activity  on  the  structure  and  dynamics  of  the

taiga  landscape,  it  is,  for  the  purposes  of  this

work, treated as a historical factor in forming the

taiga rather than as anthropogenic disturbance

Each  period  has  brought  its  own  peculiarities  of  human
influence on Russia’s natural landscape. It would be wrong
to say that the influence of humans before industrial scale
exploitation was small enough to be negligible.  From the
very start, human settlements have been, at the very least,
a  considerable  additional  source  of  forest  fire,  thereby
contributing  in  no  minor  way  to  the  formation  of  taiga
ecosystems. Later, slash and burn agriculture, harvesting
of grass on the flood beds of creeks, logging, hunting and
fishing  for  local  needs,  and  other  practices  of  natural
economy played an important role.

Many  forms  of  pre-industrial  resource  management
continued  to  be  practiced  during  the  better  part  of  the
second,
industrial  growth  stage.  Slash  and  burn
agriculture existed up until the 1930’s, ending mainly as a
result  of  collectivization  and  liquidation  of  single-family
farms. A system of hunting cabins still exists and is even
maintained in some areas, although the density of cabins
and  the  frequency  of  their  use  has  declined.    And  while
production  of  hay  on  small  flooded  fields  along  small
rivers  and  creeks  continues  sporadically,  the  majority  of
such  fields  have  been  gradually  abandoned  since  the
beginning  of  the  20th  century.  These  traces  of  pre-
industrial  utilization  including  overgrown  grain  and  hay
plots,  remnants  of  old  hunting  cabins,  and  sometimes
even small villages, can be found in the middle of what is
today wild and absolutely unpopulated territory.

THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE TAIGA AS A WOOD RESOURCE

THE LAST INTACT FOREST LANDSCAPES OF NORTHERN EUROPEAN RUSSIA

Industrial development of the taiga’s forest resources has
always been extensive. This general direction has followed
the continued exploitation of old-growth areas rather than
the  development  of  intensive  reforestation  management
within  areas  already  developed  and  closer  to  markets.
Forestry in Russia has developed an unsustainable ethos
more  similar  to  that  of  mining  than  to  classical  forestry,
which  is  directed  towards  the  utilization  of  renewable
resources.

High  grading  in  various  forms  has  historically
been the main form of logging in the taiga, with
little  or  no  consideration  of
long-term
consequences.  Convenience  of  location  and
prevalence  of  desired  species  have  governed
the  choice  of  logging  site,  on  which  only  the
most  commercially  attractive  species  and  tree
individuals have been cut.

The  forests  of  the  North  have  long  been  regarded  as  a
massive,
inexhaustible  deposit  of  wood,  the  partial
destruction of which could easily be compensated by the
exploitation of another part. The time period foreseen for
exploitation of any particular natural forest area is short in
relation  to  the  time  required  for  renewal  of  the  forest  in
that same area, given the level of silvicultural practice.

The  industrial  development  of  the  taiga  as  a  forest
resource  has  been  characterized  by  "skimming",  also
known  as  "high  grading",  the  exploitation  of  the  most
valuable,  best
resource,  without  serious
consideration of long-term consequences. Consideration
of  location  and  quality  have  been  used  for  allocation  of
logging tracts, while selective cuts focus on the best trees
in terms of product yield.

located

Forestry in the taiga shows gradual "logging creep" from
the most accessible areas close to consumption points or
transport  infrastructure  to  more  and  more  remote  areas.
Three  different  time  periods  can  be  distinguished  within
the  process  of  logging  creep  connected  with  a  gradual
increase in logging intensity and a decrease in the quality
constraints on the extracted wood. Each period involved
logging  of  increasingly  lower  quality  stands,  including
stands  that  had  been  passed  up  by  previous  logging
efforts. As a result the creep away from accessible forest
was sometimes repeated over the same area.

1.  The  high-grading  period  involved  the  harvesting  of
only the best individual trees from a product-yield point of
view. In Northern European Russia this phase lasted from
the beginning of industrial forest exploitation through the
end of the 1920’s and was characterized by an absolute
dominance  of  high-grading  and  individual  cutting  of  the

best trees. A rapid increase in management intensity took
place during the period from the 1880’s to 1913. A rather
sharp decline then followed due to the First World War, the
Socialist Revolution, and the subsequent Civil War (export
fell  drastically  during  this  period  while  internal  markets
mostly demanded low-quality fuel-wood that was supplied
from  forests
in  regions  with  high  populations  and
comparatively  good  transportation  infrastructure).  The
highest logging intensity was reached in 1912-1913. The
volumes  then  removed  from  the  European  Russian  taiga
was  at  the  same  level  as  today  -  more  than  40  million
cubic  meters  of  wood  per  year.  The  average  logging
intensity in government-owned forests in European Russia
(the  overwhelming  majority  of  which  were  located  in  the
taiga zone) was about 0.5 cubic meters per hectare, per
year (Godzishevskiy, 1924) - roughly one third of the total
potential increment in the entire North. Large areas in the
Pechora  valley  remained  more  or  less  untouched  during
this time, while the forests in the vicinity of the Baltic and
White seas were intensively logged at a level much higher
than the regional average. The harvest was concentrated
on  pine  forests,  as  pine  wood  and  products  enjoyed  the
highest  demand  in  export  markets.  Already  during  the
beginning  of  the  20th  century  a  significant  deficit  of
accessible  large-diameter  high-quality  pine  forests  was
felt in the basins of the Baltic and White seas.  Harvesting
operations were forced to move up to the very sources of
rivers  suitable  for  log  driving  as  well  as  onto  the  major
water  divides
for
transportation. Continuously decreasing tree diameters in
selective  cutting  at  the  timber  frontier  forced  loggers  to
return for a second and even third time to areas they had
already  passed  through.  As  the  supply  of  large  trees

diminished,  the  forest  industry’s  demand  for  the  largest
logs also went down.

Harvesting by local populations of firewood and building
timbers made an additional contribution to the intensity of
forest  utilization  during  this  period.    These  harvesting
volumes  were  seldom  accounted  for  in  official  forest
statistics  because  they  were  usually  removed  from
agrarian forests in the vicinity of villages - areas not under
the  control  of  the  forest  authorities.  This  contribution
appears  to  have  been  rather  significant,  given  the  cold
climate of Northern Russia and the traditionally large sizes
of  dwellings  and  other  buildings.  In  1923-24,  the  annual
consumption  of  firewood  in  the  Vologda  Region  was
approximately 9.7 cubic meters per person in rural areas
(Bykov,  1925).  This  translates  to  some  42  million  cubic
meters in total for the Vologda region (current size of the
Vologda Region is several times less than in 1923). Based
on  these  numbers,  the  total  consumption  of  firewood  in
northern  Russian  territories  can  be  estimated  at  100
million cubic meters or more of wood per year, 2.5 times
the  annual  harvest  of  industrial  wood.  Althought  this
number  seems  to  be  exaggerated,  it  is  evident  that  the
contribution  of  the  local  population  to  the  intensity  of
in  combination  with
forest  use  was  significant,  and
commercial  cutting,  over-harvesting  was  taking  place  in
large areas of Russia’s European North.

Characteristic of this high-grading period is the absolute
dominance of river floating for secondary transportation of
wood. Even the very smallest of rivers were often used -
routes  where  logs  could  pass  only  if  carried  by  spring
floodwaters.  Primary  transportation  was  completed  by
horse. A distance from the logging site to the river landing

of  up  to  15  km  was  considered  acceptable,  while  a
distance less than 8 km was thought convenient. In other
words, almost the entire basin of the White Sea, Baltic Sea
and Volga River was accessible for logging and extraction
of  high-grade  logs.  Traces  of  low  intensity  selective
logging  from  this  period  were  visible  almost  throughout
the  entire  area  of  these  basins,  including  on  the  sites
furthest  removed  from  transportation  infrastructure  and
points of wood consumption.

State forests of Northern European Russia were managed
exclusively according to the concept of "even use" annual
allowed  cut.  The  usage  was  determined  for  each  forest
district  by  dividing  its  area  by  the  number  of  years  in  a
forest rotation (for uneven-aged management the period

between  interventions,  for  even-aged  management  the
stand age at final felling). Over-cutting of the annual area
was  formally  not  tolerated.  Nevertheless,  partly  due  to
poor data and partly because of the continuous reduction
in  rotation  time  (associated,  among  other  things,  with  a
decrease  in  minimum  diameter  for  saleable  wood)  the
"even  use"  cut  remained  a  rather  blunt  regulation
instrument,  without  correspondence  with
real
productivity of the forest.

The main factor of human disturbance during this period
was not so much the logging itself as the fires that were
caused  by  careless  loggers.  In  fact,  in  many  of  the
remotest  areas  from  current  settlements  and  transport-
ation routes, the majority of forest fires (by area) can be
dated  to  the  end  of  the  19th  and  beginning  the  20th
centuries while traces of more recent fires either are totally
absent or are estimated in much smaller numbers.

This  phase  of  forest  utilization  culminated  during  the

The  weak  effect  of  these  early  cuttings  on  the  forest
structure,  in  combination  with  the  considerable  time
that  has  passed  since  the  high-grading  period  ended
in  this  part  of  Europe,  make  it  difficult  to  identify  their

Overall,  this  period  saw  an  increase  in  so-
called  "revenue  cuttings"
(an  unofficial
term  for  silvicultural  cuttings).  These  are
intermediate  cuttings  for  the  purpose  of
providing  the  state  forest  service  agencies
with  additional  funds  by  selling  wood.  The
occurrence  of  these  cuttings  is  connected
with  the  decision  in  1993  to  separate  the
state  silvicultural  agencies  from  the  state
forest  industry  system.  Unfortunately,  this
division  was  carried  out
the  usual
political  manner:  the  silvicultural  agencies
received  a  great  deal  of  responsibilities
(from  the  delineation  of  logging  sites  to  reforestation
and  silvicultural  cutting)  without  a  sufficient  budget
allocation  to  fulfill  the  tasks.  As  compensation,  the

In  this  study,  certain  influences  and  disturbances  were  considered  background  effects,  of  no

following:

section "Methodology for the identification of intact forest landscapes");

hunting  (including  the  construction  of  seasonally  inhabited  hunters’  cabins),  fishing,  mushroom  and
berry gathering, scattered recreation (without permanent infrastructure);

grazing of more or less domesticated animals (reindeer, cows, goats);

cutting down single trees for the purpose of local construction needs or for firewood;

clearing haylands in flood plains of rivers, haying.

Scattered forestry activities of the past:

industrial  selective  cuttings  of  18th  -  19th  centuries  and  the  beginning  of  20th  century  (until  the  late
1930s), as well as side-effects of those cuttings (increased frequency of fire near logging areas);

tapping trees for resin collection.

Global  and  regional  changes  in  the  Earth’s  ecosystem  (global  and  regional  air  pollution,  climate
change, ubiquitous changes in the population size of certain animal species, acclimatization and
spread of exotic species, as well as unknown or underestimated global and regional changes).

Service  of  Geodesy  and  Cartography  of  Russia,  1993  -

Thematic maps

The  second  main  source  of  information  was  thematic
maps.  The  study  used  the  "Map  of  Vegetation  in  the
European  Part  of  the  USSR"  (1974)  and  the  map
"Forests  of  the  USSR"  (1990),  as  well  as  local  and
regional  forest  maps  highlighting  dominant  species.
These  materials  were  used  to  aid  the  interpretation  of
the  satellite  imagery.

Middle resolution satellite images

The  third  major  source  of
information  was  middle
resolution  images  (approx.  150  meters  per  pixel)  from
the    MSU-SK  scanner  on  the  Russian  satellite  Resurs-

Forest  maps  are  updated
infrequently  (every  10
years  or  even  more  seldom)  and  are  of  inconsistent
quality.  Reliable  maps  do  not  exist  for  certain  legal
categories  of  forest,  such  as  forests  belonging  to
agricultural  enterprises,  remotely
located  reserve
forests,  etc.    Regional  level  maps  are  often  either
missing  or  not  accessible.  The  underlying  forest
inventory  is  in  many  cases  not  sufficiently  precise.
For  these  reasons  it  is  not  possible  to  produce  a

The  area  of  northern  European  Russia  is  divided
among  many  different  administrative  agencies.
There  is  no  unified  system  for  data  collection  among
these  agencies.  Data
is  collected  and  processed
with  varying  degrees  of  precision  and  efficiency,
even  within  individual  regions.  The  result  is  a  lack  of
unified  cartographic  information  on  the  status  and
utilization  of  lands  belonging  to  different  agencies.

Some  maps  suffer  from  insufficient  objectivity  (i.e.

Resurs MSU-SK satellite images

MSU-SK  satellite  images  have  a  spatial  resolution  of
140x170  meters  per  pixel  and  a  view  range  of
approximately  600  kilometers.  Such  images  may  be
used  in  drafting  thematic  maps  with  a  scale  of  up  to
1:1,500,000  (Kravtsova,  1995).  The  MSU-SK
images
used  in  this  study  had  undergone  primary  geographic
adjustment  and  been
into  a  uniform
resolution  of  150x150  meters  by  the  space  engineering
firm  Scanex  in  Moscow.  The  MSU-SK  scanner  has  four
spectral  channels:  channels  1-3
visible
spectrum  range,  and  channel  4  in  the  near  infrared
range.  This  allows  a  large  number  of  natural  and  man-
made  objects    to  be  detected  (Fig.  35,  36).

to  use  some  standard
algorithms  (e.g.  the  vegetation  index).  Another  serious
drawback  is  the  absence  of  an  algorithm  for  precise
geographic  adjustment  of  the
images.  Aligning  the
MSU-SK
images  with  various  cartographic  materials
required  that  the  images  be    georectified  to  a  uniform
topographic  basis.  This  produced  an
inaccuracy
between  200  and  500  meters  that  was  considered
acceptable  at  the  early  stages  of  the  work.  Several  of
the  images  had  only  two  channels  and  reduced  spatial
resolution  (due  to  some  peculiarities  of  the  satellite’s
transmission  device).  Such  images  were  used  only  as
a  last  resort,    in  the  absence  of  cloudless  4-channel
images,  and  their  application  was  therefore  limited  to  a
handful  of  small  areas.

The  MSU-SK
two  main
images  were  used
purposes:  to  identify  large-scale  disturbances  in  forest
cover  due  to  human  economic  activity  (large  clear-

infrastructure),  and  to  map  the  northern  border  of  the
forest.  Winter  and  summer  images  were  both  used.

Winter  images  were  used  to  separate  forested  and

images  from  different  years).  The  lightest  areas  in  the

At  this  stage,  summer  and  winter  medium-resolution

and  old  cut-overs  or  among  cut-overs  that  occur  in
combination  with    infrastructure.

an  unambiguous  distinction  between  "anthropogenic"

decision  rule  was  adopted.  Fire  scars    and  forests  of
early  successional  stages  adjacent  to    infrastructure  or
other
forms  of  anthropogenic  disturbance  were
classified  as  anthropogenic.  Blocks  of  other  forest
types  and  non-forest  natural  ecosystems  were  also

undisturbed  isthmus  were  considered  separate  if  the

width  of  the  isthmus  at  any  point  was  less  than  2
kilometers.

The  result  of  this  phase  was  that  heavily  disturbed
areas  were  excluded  from  further  consideration.  A
total  of  seventy-nine  percent  of  the  initially  considered
territory  was  thus  eliminated  after  two  phases.  All

LIMITATIONS AND DEFICIENCIES OF THE MAP OF INTACT FOREST LANDSCAPES

While  we  believe  this  study  is  a  useful  step  towards
identifying  the  last  wilderness  land  of  Europe,  it  must
be  pointed  out  that  the  resulting  map  has  a  number  of
limitations.  These  are  due  to    insufficient  information,
to  the  low  quality  of  the  images  for  some  areas,  and  to
inaccuracies  inherent  in  the  methods  employed.  The
limitations  and  deficiencies  of  the  map  are  further
described  below.

1.  There
in
boundaries  across  transition  zones.  Two  cases  are  of
particular

importance.

1a.  The  transition  from  forest  across  forest-tundra  to
tundra  (and  also  to  alpine  ecosystems  adjacent  to  the
latter)  is  extremely  gradual.  In  some  cases  it  stretches
for  several  dozen  kilometers,  without  any  conspicuous
threshold.
In  such  cases  the  demarcation  between
"forest"  and  "non-forest"  is  arbitrary  and  the  decision
on  where  to  place  the  boundary  may  depend  on  the
quality  and  season  of  the  image  used  as  well  as  the
formal  decision  criterion  employed.  The  northern
boundaries  of
landscapes  are  all
forest
vulnerable  to  this  kind  of  subjectivity.

intact

1b.  The  transition  from
intact  to  disturbed  forest
landscape  may  also  be  gradual.  In  most  cases  this  is
not  the  case  -  the  boundary  clearly  suggests  itself,  due
to  the  absolute  predominance  (in  the  least  populated
areas)  of  logging  in  primary  forest  over  the  last  six
decades.  However,  in  some  forests  (especially  those
subject  to  the  most  intensive  logging  during  the  first
half  of  the  20th  century),  there  is  a  clearly  developed
gradual  transition  from  greater  to  lesser  disturbance.  In
these  cases,  the  border  of  intact  areas  was  mapped  on
the  basis  of  change  in  predominant  tree  species.

2.  Some  of  the  satellite  images  were  of  inadequate
quality  and  resolution  in  relation  to  the  analysis  for
which  they  were  used:

intact

2a.  The  northern  boundaries  of
forest
landscapes  (fig.  54)  were  drawn  often  from  medium-
resolution  images  (Resurs,  150  meters  per  pixel).  As
these  areas  are  virtually  uninhabited  and  show  no
signs

Despite  the  seemingly  immense  area  of  intact  forest

were  active  from  around  mid-1999  till  mid-2000  were

images  contained  structural  and
the  Landsat  ETM+
textural  characteristics  specific  to  clear  cuts);  such
sites  made  up  79.1  percent  of  the  total  area  cut.    A

of  selective  and  partial  cuts
  was  estimated  at  50
percent.  The  area  of  in-woods  landings  and  processing
sites  is  included  in  this  estimate.    In  a  few  specific
cases,  logging  sites  classified  as  doubtful  were  also
included.  These  were  areas  which  may  have  been
either  clearcuts  or  wind-throws.  A  correction  factor  of
0.5  was  applied  to  these  areas  (i.e.  they  were  included
in  the  category  of  selectively  cut  areas).  The  maximum
error  possible  in  the  area  of  estimation,  taking  into
account  errors  caused  by  the  resolution  of  the  images
and  the  assumption  made,  was  –  10.4  percent.  The
maximum  total  error  in  the  estimate  of  the  logged  area
does  not  exceed  23  percent.  This  error  estimate  takes
into  account  the  resolution  of  the  images  used  and  all
assumptions  made.  An  error  of  23  percent  or  less  can
be  considered  acceptable  for  the  purposes  of  this
study.

5.  The  estimate  of  logged  area  was  adjusted  to  reflect
a  period  of  one  year.  The  logged  area  of  each  segment
of  a  buffer  zone  was  divided  with  the  time  period

however,  as  the  period  between  images  was  close  to

6.  Logging  intensity  was  calculated  in  cubic  meters
per  hectare  and  year  for  the  entire  buffer  zone.    The
area  estimate  was  multiplied  with  regionally  specific
estimates  of  the  average  stock  of  exploitable  mature
and  overmature  stands.  The  resulting  estimate  of
annually
is  probably  somewhat  too
high.  The  areas  remaining  as  intact  landscapes  tend  to
have  a  lower  stocking  than  the  regional  average  due  to
a  high  proportion  of  bogs,
low  productivity,  and  a
location  in  the  north  of  the  area  to    which  the  regional
average  applies.  This  applies  specificially  to    the  Komi

Russia,  and  thus  also  in  the  vicinity  of  intact  forest

the  regional  wood  supply  will  decrease  significantly  in
the  near  future.

forest  resource  base  in  other  parts  of  the  region  is
forcing  industry  to  go  after  even  the  most  remote  and

inaccessible  areas.  A  fact  of  essential
importance  is  that  the  intensity  of  logging  in  three  of
the  four  regions  is  greater  in  the  already  developed
parts  than  in  the  near  intact  parts.  Thus,  the  forests
around  the  remaining  intact  forest  landscapes,  due  to
their  inaccessibility,  are  of  less  interest  to  the  forest

The results suggests the conclusion that the intact
forest landscapes still remaining in the Karelia and
Komi Republics and in the Perm Region are of small
importance  to  the  regional  supply  of  wood  and,
consequently, that a exclusion of these areas from
the  exploitable  land  base  would  not  cause  any
significant decrease in the annual logging volume,
at  least  not  in  the  near  future.  For  the  Komi  and
Karelia  Republics  and  the  Perm  Region,  such  a
decrease would be no greater than a small percent
of  the  annually

landbase  cause  a  more  significant  decrease
(around 10 percent  of the volume logged, or slightly
more). In no case can the decreases be regarded as
critical. The variation in the volume logged during
the  last  decade  is  many  times  greater  than  these
reductions.  Thus,  a  withdrawal  of  the  remaining
intact  forest  landscapes  in  northern  European
Russia  from  the  exploitable  landbase  would  not
cause  any significant economic damage and may
even be justified from an economic point of view.

remaining  intact  areas  have  an  average  increment  for
coniferous  trees  of  less  than  1  m3  per  hectare  per  year
(including  the  18  percent  of  the  area  which  has  an
average  annual
less  than  0.5  m3  per
hectare).  The  experience  of  some  foreign  countries
indicate  that  sustainable  forestry  in  such  areas  cannot
be  justified.  The  Forestry  Act  of  Sweden,  for  example,
stipulates  that:    "...  Land  shall  be  considered  suitable
if,  on  the  basis  of  accepted
for  wood  production
principles  of  assessment,  it  can  provide  an  average
yield  of  at  least  one  cubic  meter  of  stem  wood  per
hectare  per  annum"  (Article  2).  Thus,  a  major  part  of
the  remaining  intact  forest  landscapes  are  unsuitable
for  production  forestry.    Any  profitable  forestry  in  these
areas
likely  to  be  based  on  the  "cut-and-run"
principle,  i.e.  the  mining  approach  to  forestry  which    is
long    established  in  northern  European  Russia.  Even
such
shortsighted  use  may  prove  unprofitable,
however,  due  to  low  stocking  levels  (see  next  section)
and  the  fragmentation  of  the  forest  by  bogs  in  many
areas.

One  of  the  factors  determining  the  attractiveness  and
suitability  of  an  forest  area  for  sustainable  use  is  its
productivity.  The    productivity  of  the  remaining  intact

The  remaining    intact  forest  landscapes  are

western  slopes  of  the  Ural  mountains.  Thus,  the
remaining    intact  forest  landscapes  are  made  up  of
the  least  productive  forests  of  European  Russia.  This
is  the  very  reason  they  remain  intact.

TIMBER STOCK IN REMAINING INTACT FOREST LANDSCAPES

Another  factor  that  determines  the  attractiveness  of
an  area  for  exploitation  is  the  amount  of  forest  there,
i.e.  the  level  of  stocking.  The  latest  available  regional
estimates  of  stocking  are  more  than  30  years  old
(Forest  Atlas  of  the  USSR,  1973).  No  logging  has  taken
place  in  the  intact  areas,  however,  and  the  forests  are
mostly  of  the  kind  which  is  in  approximate  equilibrium
over  time.  Any  changes  should  therefore  be  small.

The  map  of  remaining    intact  forest  landscapes  was
compared  with  the  official  map  of  stocking  levels.  The
result  shows  that  a  significant  part  (56  percent)  of  the
intact  areas  have  an  average  standing    inventory  of

Among  them  are  populations  of  large  animals  that  are

swamps  and  lakes,  migration  paths  of  many  species,
and  balanced  patterns  of  random  disturbances.  The

This  loss  appears  to  be  small,  however.  Most  of  these
areas  are  remote  and  their  exploitation  is  fraught  with
technical  obstacles  (cid:151)  this  is  indeed  the  reason  why
they  remain  intact.  The  threat  to  these  areas  is  caused
not  by  their  inherent  commercial  attractiveness,  but
rather  by  depletion  of
forest
resources  in  other  parts  of  northern  European  Russia.
There  is  a  risk  that  these  areas  will  become  subject  to

Conservation  of  large  intact  natural  forest  landscapes
is  an  important  and  necessary  component  of  a  general
conservation  strategy,  but  it  is  not  by  itself  sufficient.
Many  ecosystems  have  already  been  disturbed  to  the
point  where  only  small  fragments,  or  nothing  at  all,
remains.    Mapping  of  these  ecosystem  residuals  was
outside  the  scope  of  this  study,  but  is  an  important  task
for  the  future.

Efforts  have  been  made  to  preserve  some  of  the  most
