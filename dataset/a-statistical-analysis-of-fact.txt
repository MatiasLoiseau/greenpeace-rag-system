Foreward:
This report is intended to be an interim statement of progress and results of an on-
going study of the mercury hair levels in the U.S. population and their statistical
association with variables such as geographic location, gender, age, occupation, and fish
consumption patterns. A final report on the completed study is scheduled for release in
late February or early March 2005. With recent intense national interest in the issue of
human exposure to mercury, prompted in part by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
reports that over 75 percent of 3,094 fish consumption advisories are caused by mercury
contamination and that the extent of such consumption advisories has now increased to
include about 35 percent of U.S. freshwaters, an interim progress report relating human
mercury exposure to fish consumption patterns is appropriate.
It should be noted that the final study report will include a national statistical
analysis geographically correlating mercury hair levels of the U.S. population with aerial
mercury atmospheric deposition data from coal-fired power plants and other sources now
becoming available as detailed dispersion models from the U.S. Environmental Agency.
An assessment of this relationship between human mercury exposure and atmospheric
deposition levels has not yet been performed to be included as part of this interim report.

Background and Introduction
Exposure to mercury has become increasingly recognized as a significant public
health issue affecting the U.S. population, especially infants and young children. Fetal
exposure to mercury is a special concern because it is now recognized that even very low
mercury exposures cause significant cognitive developmental defects and other
neurological development disorders in children (e.g. Bienenfeld et al, 2003; NRC, 2000;
Castoldi et al, 2001). Other recent research (e.g. Steuerwald et al, 2000; Grandjean et al,
1999; Grandjean et al, 1997; Crump et al, 1998) has also repeatedly validated the fact that
even moderate mercury exposure during pregnancy can cause measurable adverse effects
on brain development, resulting in observed deficits in language development, memory,
motor function, and visuospatial performance.
Although people in the U.S. can be exposed to mercury through many routes
including inhalation of ambient mercury-containing air, ingestion of terrestrial animal
products such as eggs, meat, and butter, consumption of water, and hand-to-mouth
contact with surfaces where fly ash and mercury have deposited, it has become clear that
the primary route of mercury exposure to the U.S. population is through fish consumption
(e.g. Mahaffey et al, 2001; McDowell et al, 2004).  Many fish species, especially those
higher in the trophic web such as bass, salmon, walleye, and pike, are known to
concentrate mercury to tens of thousands of times higher concentrations than found in the
water column.
While permanent neurological damage to infants and young children continues to be
the primary public health concern from mercury exposure, some studies have also found
increases in male heart disease associated with moderately elevated mercury exposure
(e.g. Gualla et al, 2002; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2004).  Although not yet
adequately documented in the scientific literature, there is increasing evidence that many
U.S. individuals of all ages have developed greatly increased sensitivities to periodic
mercury exposure resulting in vision impairments, circulatory system problems, and other
neurotoxic symptoms from even low mercury levels (eg. Snider, 2004; Wright and
Wilson, 2004).
The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a “reference dose” (as
measured by the mercury content of hair) of 1.0 mg/g (or one part-per-million, i.e. ppm)
to assess human mercury exposure. At this level women of child-bearing age are advised
to stop consumption of fish that may have elevated mercury levels. In a large national
study conducted previously to our study, McDowell et at. (2004) measured the hair
mercury levels of 2564 randomly selected U.S. individuals (838 children and 1726
women of child-bearing age) from the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES).  The geometric mean for the entire study population in
1999-2000 was 0.12 mg/g in children and 0.20 mg/g in women aged 16-49.  Among
frequent fish consumers the geometric mean increased to 0.38 mg/g, again further
reinforcing the fact that fish consumption is the major pathway of mercury exposure in
U.S.
Approximately 12% of the women studied had hair mercury levels above the 1.0
mg/g EPA health advisory, and about 23% had levels that were greater than one-half the
EPA advisory level (ie.> 0.5 mg/g).  According to the NHANES data, between 300,000

and 600,000 newborns in the U.S. in the year 2000 were prenatally exposed to in utero
methylmercury levels above the USEPA health advisory limits (Mahaffey et al, 2004).
While mercury can enter the environment from various natural and industrial
sources, at least 40% of total U.S. mercury emissions come from coal-fired power plants.
This percentage is increasing as other Hg sources such as medical incinerators and
municipal waste combustors are greatly reduced (USEPA, 2004; NESCAUM, 2003).
Also, in a large percentage of U.S. watersheds, coal-fired power plants are recognized to
be the majority source of mercury emissions (NESCAUM, 2003). Without regulatory
requirements and the installation of mercury control technologies, emissions from coal-
fired power plants can be expected to increase as more plants are built and/or existing
plants expanded (NESCAUM, 2003).
Thus, the purposes of the current study were to: 1) Determine from a large study
sample the percentage of people in various age/gender categories with excessive mercury
exposure as measured by hair levels in 2004.  2) Examine statistical relationships for the
study population between mercury exposure and age, gender, occupation, and fish
consumption habits.  3) Develop statistical relationships between hair mercury levels and
atmospheric mercury deposition rates across the United States.
Methodology
Study participants were recruited by Greenpeace, Aveda, and various nonprofit
organizations in various areas of the U.S. through national internet notices, regional
media coverage of the research project, special local awareness events, and other
publicity efforts.  As of the September 23, 2004 cut off date for receiving samples, over
3000 hair sampling kits had been sent to volunteer study participants, and 1449 were
returned in time to be included in this interim project analysis.  It is anticipated that over
5000 participants will eventually be included in the statistical analysis for the final report
on this research project in February or March of 2005.  The study sample population
areas are not intended to be statistically representative of the entire U.S. population, since
participants were self-selected, and recruitment of study participants was focused more
strongly in some areas of the country than others.  The study population is clearly
weighted towards particular geographic areas, towards individuals who might be more
concerned about this particular health issue, and towards individuals better able to afford
the small fee to participate in the study.  It is unclear whether these selection factors
would tend to inflate or reduce average hair mercury levels related to the general
population. It is very unlikely, however, that the statistical relationships we examined
between hair levels and other variables including age, gender, geographic area, and fish
consumption levels would be different for our study population than for the general U.S.
population.
Each volunteer was sent a hair sampling kit by the Environmental Quality
Institute (EQI) consisting of gloves, ziplock sample bags, labels, a cardboard weighing
balance designed to tip when approximately 0.5g of hair was added, detailed instructions
for cutting, weighing and labeling hair samples, and a return postage-paid mailer.  After
washing their hair, each volunteer participant was instructed (complete with illustrations)
on how and where to cut and weigh their sample.  Each sampling kit also included a
detailed research questionnaire which requests information on age, gender, pregnancy

status, hair color, occupation, dental amalgams and removal, flu shot history, and, several
questions regarding specifics of fish consumption habits. (See Appendix A).
Upon receipt at the EQI laboratory, samples were logged in and questionnaire
data was transferred to a computerized database.  Hair samples were weighed to the
nearest 0.0001 gram on an analytical balance and digested using EPA Method 3050B
with concentrated nitric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide on a SCP Science DigiblockTM
graphite block digestor.  Final volume of the digestate was 50ml.
Mercury determination was performed using EPA Method 7470A.  Either a
Thermo-Jarrel-Ash 22 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) with
deuterium arc background correction or a Thermo M6 AAS with a V90 vapor system
were used to determine mercury concentration in the digestates.  Mercury levels in the
original hair sample were determined by back-calculation according to the formula:
[Hg Hair in ppm]= (Hg concentration (mg/L) x 0.05 L digestate volume)/(wt. of
hair (g))
Each volunteer participant was sent a confidential letter with their individual
results along with explanatory information regarding USEPA advisory levels.
Results and Discussion
Of the 1449 individual hair samples completed for the interim report 20.3% (slightly
over one-fifth) were found to have mercury levels above the USEPA advisory level of 1.0
mg/g.  An additional 20.6% of participants had levels between 0.5 and 1.0 mg/g, also
indicating significantly elevated mercury exposure. As noted earlier, the 1999-2000
NHANES study found that about 12% of the U.S. population of children 0-5 years and
women 16-49 years had mercury hair levels above the advisory level. It is unclear at this
point to what extent this difference may be due to the self-selection procedure used for
our study as opposed to the extent that mercury exposure of the U.S. population has
actually increased since 1999-2000. It is very possible that overall fish consumption in
the U.S. has increased over the past 4-5 years with the national health trend away from
red meat and the widespread emphasis on the health value of the omega oils contained in
fish. In our study we include males and females of all ages, and we found virtually no
differences in the mercury hair levels between genders. Thus, we find nearly identical
percentages above 0.5 mg/g and 1.0 mg/g regardless of whether we consider both men and
women or just women as was done in the NHANES study.  In any case the data from
both studies clearly show that a high percentage of Americans (estimated range 30 to 60
million) have been exposed to mercury at levels above the levels deemed to be safe
(especially for pregnant women), and that an additional 30-60 million Americans have
exposure levels approaching these official cautionary levels.  Thus, there is clearly no
other human-produced toxin that is causing officially-recognized elevated exposures to
anywhere near this high a percentage of the U.S. population.
Table 1 shows a breakdown of hair exposure levels by frequency of fish
consumption.  As seen from Table 1 even those who consume a low to moderate amount
of fish have nearly a 10 % probability of exceeding the EPA Advisory Level, while
nearly 50 % of heavy fish consumers exceeded this level.
Especially concerning is the finding that the highest 10 % of the heavy fish consumer
group typically show mercury exposure several times greater than the Advisory Level.

Table 2 shows that for the heavy fish consumption group, almost three-fourths of the
individuals were found to have levels above 0.5 mg/g.  Even for the moderately high fish
consuming group 28.5 % exceed the Advisory Level, and a total of almost 60 % of this
group exhibit mercury hair exposures of at least 0.5 mg/g.
Tables 3, 4, and 5 show a further detailed analysis of fish consumption habits.  Table
3 shows that the more frequently individuals consume canned tuna, the higher their hair
mercury levels become.  For people who consumed canned tuna four or more times per
month, nearly one-third have mercury exposures exceeding the EPA Advisory Level.
Table 4 shows that over half the people who consume either fresh store-bought or
restaurant fish at least seven times per month have mercury exposures exceeding the EPA
Advisory Level.  As shown in Table 5 consumption of locally caught fish seems
especially to be a problem, with over half of individuals exhibiting exposures of at least
0.5 mg/g from consumption of just one of two servings per month.
    The USEPA Reference Dose (i.e. Health Advisory) of 1.0 mg/g was set for children
and women of childbearing age. No Reference Dose has yet been established for adult
males, but given the documented health effects, it can only benefit both genders to try to
keep their mercury exposure as low as possible.

In Table 6 the results are broken down by region of the U.S.  From this table it can
be seen that the study participants are relatively evenly distributed geographically.  The
most obvious trend noticeable from Table 6 is that mercury exposures are significantly
lower overall for individuals in the Midwest.  This trend may be due to any combination
of factors including lower fish mercury levels in the Midwest, lower per-capita fish
consumption, or other age/ gender differences in the study population from this versus the

other three regions.  One factor which would tend to damp out differences between
regions is the reality that fresh, frozen, and canned fish products are now shipped over
very wide geographic regions.
In Table 7 we have further broken down the geographic regions by individual states
for which we had at least 50 study participants.  From Table 7 it can be seen that a
significant percentage of individuals from all six states listed had moderately elevated
mercury exposure levels.  Participants from New York State were particularly high with
over 45 % of study subjects exhibiting mercury exposures above the EPA Advisory
Level.  Florida and California were also well above the national percentage exceeding the
EPA Advisory Level.  These percentages may change substantially as the study
continues, and we obtain larger and more representative study populations from each
state.
Consistent with the 1999-2000 NHANES study (Mahaffey et al, 2004), it is shown in
Table 8 that children and teens tended to have significantly lower mercury exposure
levels than adults.  This trend is probably because children and teens tend to eat less fish
than adults, which in terms of mercury toxicity is probably fortunate, given the greater
neurotoxicity effects of mercury on children.

In Table 9 we have summarized the statistical significance of various potential
factors which might influence peoples’ overall mercury exposure.  The results are based
on a linear regression model, and each factor in Table 9 is adjusted for all the other
factors.  Factors with P-values of less than 0.05 would be considered statistically
significant, which means that the association is almost certainly real as opposed to being
a statistical coincidence.  As seen from the first three rows of data, the more store-bought
fish, canned tuna fish, or locally caught fish a person consumes, the higher their hair
mercury level will tend to be.  As noted previously, mercury exposure clearly increases

with age, and the mercury hair levels vary significantly with geographic region. The
geographic region analysis is particularly interesting because the result is adjusted for
frequency of fish consumption.  This means that there remain differences in mercury
exposure for the different geographic regions after adjusting for the amount of each type
of fish consumed.
As shown in Table 9, none of the other potential variables including occupation,
gender, the presence or removal of mercury-containing dental amalgams, recent flu shots
(which contain mercury as a preservative), or a recent hair dying (a few dyes still contain
some mercury) were found to be statistically significant factors when adjusted for all the
other factors.  As the study sample size continues to increase, it is possible that some of
these variables (especially the mercury amalgam variables) may become statistically
significant.

Summary and Conclusions
The preliminary results of this large nationwide study indicate that approximately 20 %
of the U.S. population may have been exposed to mercury at levels above the U.S. EPA’s
Advisory Level for public health protection.  This is an increase from the 12 % found in
1999-2000 by other researchers, and this difference may be due to an upward bias in our
self-selected sample and/ or the fact that mercury exposures to the U.S. public have
increased in the past five years.  In either case both studies clearly indicate that a
substantial percentage of the U.S. population, representing 30-60 million people, and
300,000 to 600,000 newborn infants per year, have been exposed to mercury at levels
above the US EPA health Advisory Level.
The greatest factor influencing mercury exposure of the U.S. public is the
individual’s frequency of fish consumption.  Fish, especially higher trophic level species
such as bass, salmon, walleye, tuna, and other larger marine species, are known to

generally concentrate mercury (which has entered water from atmospheric deposition or
industrial discharges) in their muscle tissues.  We found that nearly half of the high fish-
consuming subjects had mercury levels exceeding EPA Advisory levels.
Mercury is well documented to cause measurable brain development deficits to
children exposed to even relatively low levels prior to birth, and there is increasing
evidence of neurological and cardiovascular illness in many mercury-sensitive adults as
well.
Coal-fired power plants are the greatest source of mercury to the environment of the
U.S. and are the only significant source which continues to be unregulated.  Technologies
(already installed on waste combustion and medical incinerators) exist to reduce mercury
emission from coal-fired power plants by 90 %.
Our preliminary work, as well as that of other researchers, clearly indicate that
virtually no other pollutant is affecting such a large percentage of the U.S. population at
levels above established government healthy advisory levels.  Thus, it would be
reasonable and prudent that the United States should move quickly in the direction of
greatly reducing mercury power plant emissions.  Such action would substantially
increase the safety of fish consumption and provide a much-needed public health
protection to the nation’s people, especially its children.
An official final report on the project, projected to include over 5000 nationally-
distributed study subjects, and thus the largest and most current of its type, is scheduled
to be completed by the Environmental Quality Institute by late February or early March,
2005.
