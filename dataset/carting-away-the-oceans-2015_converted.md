Scoring Criteria for Evaluating Seafood Sustainability

This report evaluates major U.S. retailers on the sustainability of their seafood, in four key areas:
policy, initiatives, labeling and transparency, and Red List inventory.

page 5

1. Policy
The policy score reflects the
system that the company has in
place to govern its purchasing
decisions and avoid supporting
destructive practices. To be a
leader in this category, a retailer
would need to establish and
enforce rigorous standards to
responsibly source both wild-
caught and farm-raised seafood
across the fresh, frozen, and
shelf-stable sections of its stores.

2. Initiatives
The initiatives score is an
appraisal of the company’s
proactive participation in coali-
tions, partnerships, and other
actions that promote seafood
sustainability and ocean conser-
vation. This includes both internal
initiatives that are central to
how the company operates and
supporting external initiatives in
the realm of public policy. To lead
in this category, a retailer would
need to make public statements
in support of key areas of ocean
conservation. One example
would be to convey with policy
makers support for IUU fishing
enforcement, or with fishery
management authorities regard-
ing sustainable fishing practices
and the protection of vital marine
habitats like the Bering Sea
Canyons.

3. Labeling and Transparency
This score is determined by the
company’s level of transparency,
for example, about where and
who it sources its seafood
from, and how clearly this is
communicated to its customers.
Equally important is whether the
company pushes its own suppli-
ers to be transparent, particularly
about where and how they catch
or farm seafood. For customers,
some companies present this
data at the point of sale, while
others opt to make it accessible
online. The best retailers do both,
and a leader in this category
would go to considerable lengths
to create clear ways for people
to learn more about the seafood
they buy and the impacts of their
choices.

4. Red List Inventory
A crucial component of a
responsible seafood operation is
stopping the sale of the most de-
structively caught or endangered
species. Greenpeace’s Red
List is a scientifically compiled
list of 22 marine species that,
for a variety of reasons, should
not currently be made com-
mercially available. It highlights
major concerns, including low
stock numbers, destabilization
of the ecosystem-wide food
chain, and irresponsible fishing or
farming practices that contribute
to the collateral destruction of
other marine life or habitats. A
leading retailer in Carting Away
the Oceans’ Red List Inventory
category would sell the fewest
Red List species.

Note on Red List: The list is used to assess retailers, but is not intended to be comprehensive. Robust sustainable
seafood procurement policies are needed to help retailers ensure the seafood they sell is not damaging our oceans.
Some retailers source Red List species from fisheries or farms operating in a protective or less damaging manner (e.g.,
pole and line caught tuna). This may include collaborating with environmental NGOs in Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs)
or Aquaculture improvement Projects (AIPs) to address problems that caused the species to be red-listed. Sourcing in a
more responsible manner may counter a retailer’s poor score associated with selling those particular Red List species.

Note on FIPs & AIPs: Many FIPs/AIPs can play a temporary role to improve operations and sourcing in more sustain-
able ways, and retailers can help ensure FIPs/AIPs are effective. However, in an industry with rampant overfishing, IUU
fishing, and human rights abuses, sourcing of a problem species from a FIP or AIP is not always the solution. “Continuous
improvement” can be a misleading, overused phrase by industry and NGOs to excuse the continued sale of a problem
species. Often, what is needed instead is a reliance on available data, scientific recommendations, and wisdom from previ-
ous stock collapses to make the clear decision to stop sourcing from that fishery or farm. Greenpeace advises retailers
to not base entire purchasing policies or sustainability/social responsibility statements on sourcing from a FIP or AIP. The
solution for orange roughy and bigeye tuna, for example, is simple: stop sourcing and do so immediately.

WHAT CUSTOMERS CAN DO

In a perfect world, massive companies that profit from our oceans would have the
wisdom and foresight to steward it properly for the good of all. Unfortunately, this is
frequently not the case. As fish stocks collapse and demand increases, companies are
relying on slavery or forced labor to increase their profits (see page 11).

Faced with this reality, it is up to consumers to make our voices heard and to demand
the change we want to see for our oceans.

As major seafood buyers, supermarkets have the power to bring about enormous
positive change for our oceans. They can and must help rebuild depleted stocks, create
protective measures for vulnerable habitats, promote strong fishery management across
the globe, and ensure that workers in the global seafood industry receive fair wages and
have safe working conditions.

Five ways to help the oceans at your grocery store:

1.  Know the facts. Visit seafood.greenpeaceusa.org to learn the truth about your

favorite supermarkets and what these companies must to do improve.

2.  Speak your mind. Join Greenpeace Greenwire to connect with volunteers in your
area and invite your community to take action with you. Bring your friends and
tell your grocer that you want them to only sell sustainable, socially responsible
seafood. Demand to know the truth behind your seafood options.

3.  Demand that your seafood is not connected to human rights abuses. Tell

your grocer that you want every person around the globe working to bring seafood
to our tables to be treated fairly. Ask the manager how their company is addressing
growing concerns about slavery, labor abuse, and illegal fishing.

4.  Vote with your dollar. Reward grocers that are taking it upon themselves to make

sustainable choices. Only purchase sustainable seafood and let the team behind
the counter know you appreciate it.

5.  Eat less fish. Today’s demand for seafood far outstrips what can be delivered

from sustainable sources. Reducing seafood consumption now can help lessen the
pressure on our oceans, ensuring fish for the future.

WHAT SUPERMARKETS MUST DO

Retailers must address five specific tasks:

1.  Publicly and internally commit to end slavery, labor abuse, and IUU fishing.
As long as retailers profit from our oceans and the workers who supply seafood, it
is essential to urgently address labor abuse and IUU fishing. While there are many
steps to confront these issues (see page 11), retailers must proactively review their
supply chains and sourcing standards, publicly denounce slavery, and collaborate
with suppliers, governments, and NGOs to create systemic change.

2.  Create an effective, publicly available sustainable seafood policy that pro-

tects against labor abuse. Retailers that have sensible guidelines governing their
seafood practices are better able to ensure that they are not causing undue harm
to the oceans or people through their operations. Additionally, allowing the public
access to these policies increases transparency and allows consumers to purchase
seafood with confidence.

3.  Support initiatives and advocate for positive change for our oceans and the

people that rely on/catch seafood. Retailers must engage in the political process
around ocean conservation, fishery management, and the protection of human
rights. Retailers must use their buying power to create change by weighing in on a
political level, and should encourage customers to be advocates for the ocean.

4.

Increase overall transparency through labeling, signage, and chain of cus-
tody. Sustainable and socially responsible seafood is impossible to achieve without
establishing strong traceability mechanisms. This traceability must carry through
from the fishing vessel or farm to the point of sale, allowing seafood consumers to
make educated choices based on all available information.

5.  Stop selling Red List species. Even if certified as sustainable by a third party or

captured/raised in a FIP or AIP, there are some fisheries or farms that simply should
not be patronized due to overfishing, destructive fishing methods, or labor abuse.
Similarly, there are certain species of fish and shellfish that, based on their physiol-
ogy and life history, are unable to support significant fishing pressure. Responsible
merchants must end the sale of these animals immediately if we are to have any
chance of repairing the damage we have done.

INTRODUCTION

This is the ninth edition of Greenpeace’s Carting Away the
Oceans report. We’ve seen significant progress since launch-
ing the report in 2008, with many of the largest retailers in the
United States developing robust sustainable seafood policies,
increasing transparency online and at the point of sale for the
public’s benefit, and advocating for important reforms in the
industry.

•  Whole Foods, Wegmans, Giant Eagle, Costco,

Roundy’s, and Southeastern Grocers (formerly Bi-Lo
Holdings) sent letters urging the government to protect
the Bering Sea Canyons from destructive fishing. To date,
eleven retailers have called for protection of the nation’s
“Grand Canyons of the Sea.” Target (ranked 5th) remains
the only top five retailer not to support protections.

Eighty percent of the 25 retailers featured in this year’s report
received at least a passing score. However, all retailers must
address the industry’s failure to confront human rights abuses
and illegal operations in the global seafood supply chain.

It is unacceptable for retailers to tout sustainable fishing or
aquaculture methods without considering the impacts on
people. Greenpeace will continue to document illegal fishing
and human rights abuses in the industry, and call on major
seafood buyers to take action.

The most significant trends and findings
from this year’s report:

•  Whole Foods is ranked first place for the third year in a
row, achieving its highest score ever in this report.

•  Wegmans continued its rise (ranked 2nd), closing in on
Whole Foods. Despite its progress, Wegmans is now
the only top five retailer without sustainable private label
canned tuna.

•

In only its second year in this report, Hy-Vee (ranked
3rd) enters the good category (scores above 7/10), as it
passes Safeway, which dropped to fourth place. Hy-
Vee discontinued Chilean sea bass and is the only top
three retailer that does not sell this vulnerable species.

•  Costco and Target introduced sustainable private

label canned tuna in their stores, joining retailers Whole
Foods, Hy-Vee, Safeway, and Trader Joe’s, which all
offer sustainable private label canned tuna products. Gi-
ant Eagle became the first retailer to develop a sustain-
able canned tuna sourcing policy. Walmart, Kroger,
Albertsons (now Albertsons-Safeway), Wegmans,
Delhaize, and Meijer must clean up their tuna sourcing
this year.

•  Whole Foods, Wegmans, Hy-Vee, Safeway, Ahold,

and Giant Eagle called on Congress to pass the Illegal,
Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing Enforcement
Act of 2015. Retailers need to ramp up their efforts to
address slavery and IUU fishing in the global seafood
industry.

•  Trader Joe’s became the first retailer ever to drop (from
4th to 7th place) out of the good category as rival ALDI
(ranked 6th) moved ahead.

•  Southeastern Grocers (formerly Bi-Lo Holdings) was
the most improved retailer in this report. Additionally, this
is the first year since we launched the Carting Away the
Oceans report in 2008 that the company participated in
the survey.

•  A&P dropped significantly (nearly 3.5 points) following

financial trouble and restructuring. The retailer needs to
turn the corner immediately and prioritize sustainable
seafood.

•  Publix (ranked 23rd) is now the only top ten U.S. retailer

(by gross revenue) to fail this report. Publix is tied with
Kroger, selling the most Red List species (18) out of any
retailer, as regional rival Southeastern Grocers leapt
past the retailer this year.

•  Harris Teeter was not profiled separately as in previous

years, following its acquisition by grocery giant Kroger
(ranked 18th). Not only did Kroger’s score drop this year,
the retailer refused to participate in the report for its ninth
consecutive time.

•

This year’s report profiled Safeway (ranked 4th) sepa-
rately from Albertsons (ranked 19th) for the last time, as
the two companies operated independently for most of
the past 12 months at the close of this report’s survey
process. The merger agreement between Safeway and
Albertsons (collectively known as Albertsons-Safeway)
was finalized on January 30, 2015. The new merged
company has a lot of work to do in order to embody the
leadership from Safeway in previous years.

•  Haggen mushroomed in size following the acquisition of

146 Albertsons and Safeway stores, and will likely be
profiled in next year’s Carting Away the Oceans report.

INTRODUCTION

page 9

The retail sector has significant challenges ahead as our
oceans continue to suffer from overfishing, destructive fishing,
and illegal fishing. The following are key areas where retailers
must demonstrate action.

that Pribilof Canyon has been confirmed to contain at least
half of the coral habitat along the Bering Sea slope, an area
that is highly vulnerable to contact with fishing gear, we must
see conservation measures implemented.

Slavery and labor abuse
Following major international scandals involving slavery and
human rights abuses in the global seafood industry (see pg.
11), the retail sector has significant work ahead to confront
these problems. While some retailers are deepening their
supply chain analyses, advocating for reforms in the industry,
and supporting government legislation, this problem requires
a collaborative approach. Companies must work across the
sector, with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and
alongside governments to stop human rights abuses in the
seafood industry.

Given their sheer size, retailers like Walmart, Kroger, Costco,
Albertsons-Safeway, and Publix must emerge as leaders on
human rights issues; however, all retailers share respon-
sibility and must ensure that their products and supply
chains are not associated with slavery and labor abuse.

As we approach the tenth Carting Away the Oceans report,
Greenpeace will continue to highlight the urgent need for
industry reforms that address labor abuse, with an increased
focus on leaders and laggards among U.S. retailers. The
retail sector must work tirelessly until it can confidently sell
environmentally and socially responsible seafood.

Now is the time for collaboration, action, and meaningful
results that protect people and our oceans.

Red List
There is no place for top-tier Red List species (see pg. 5) like
Chilean sea bass, orange roughy, or sharks in supermarkets.
Retailers should follow the lead of companies like Hy-Vee
(discontinued Chilean sea bass) and Roundy’s (discontinued
sharks and orange roughy), holding a firm stance on sustain-
able seafood and educating customers along the way.

Tuna
Shelf-stable seafood is one area where retailers have made
less progress. Roughly 80% of canned tuna available on
supermarket shelves is coming from destructive, irresponsible
tuna fisheries and brands (see pg. 16). Canned tuna is firmly
on the radar of Greenpeace and retailers must act to ad-
dress significant concerns. They should start by developing
comprehensive policies to convert to more sustainable
tuna sourcing for their private label and national brand
canned products. The three biggest tuna brands in the U.S.
(Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea, and StarKist) have for too
long dominated the market and reigned in massive profits,
exploiting our oceans and operating with questionable social
responsibility standards. As their customers, retailers must
make it very clear to the three biggest brands: offer more
sustainable, socially responsible products or this contract is
canceled.

Marine Protected Areas
The retail sector must also continue to advocate for a
fundamental shift in the way fisheries are managed, moving
toward a more ecosystem-based approach. Eleven retailers
have called on the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
(NPFMC) to protect vulnerable habitats in the Bering Sea
Canyons and the vital Green Belt (see pg. 18). As important
stakeholders, it is critical for retailers to reaffirm their support
leading up to the October 2015 NPFMC meeting, where new
science will be reviewed and managers will decide whether or
not to consider options to protect this valuable habitat. Now

WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT
FOR CURRENT INDUSTRY LEADERS

This year, four of the top five retailers continue to receive a
good ranking (above 7/10). Target entered the top five, while
Trader Joe’s becomes the first retailer to ever drop from the
good category. As industry leaders, this group has a respon-
sibility to advocate for serious reforms throughout the sector.

1. Whole Foods remains the top-ranked retailer for the third
year in a row, receiving the highest ever score for a retailer in
this report. The retailer’s 365 Everyday Value brand canned
tuna is the top-ranked private label brand in Greenpeace
USA’s first-ever canned tuna ranking. The retailer can build on
this leadership and develop a tuna policy so that it only offers
100% sustainable, socially responsible canned tuna in its
stores. Whole Foods, concerned about the health of ecosys-
tems that support fisheries, called on the NPFMC to diligently
review the science as it considers protecting the Bering
Sea Canyons. Whole Foods is increasing its public focus on
human rights abuses in the seafood industry by speaking on
industry panels, sharing information online with its customers,
and calling on Congress to prioritize IUU fishing enforcement.
While Whole Foods continues its lead among retailers in this
report, it must reduce its Red List sales, starting with Chilean
sea bass, in order to maintain the number one spot.

2. Wegmans overtook Safeway to claim second place this
year and earn its highest score since it was first profiled in
2008. Wegmans joined other front-runners calling on the
NPFMC to protect the Bering Sea Canyons and remains the
only retailer that definitively does not source its private label
pollock products from the Bering Sea Canyons. While Whole
Foods went the wrong way by adding skates, Wegmans
dropped skates and rays, improving its Red List score. The
retailer is ranked higher than Whole Foods in the Red List
category and must go further by dropping Chilean sea bass.
Wegmans is the only top five retailer that does not offer
sustainable private label canned tuna, and could benefit from
developing a strong sourcing policy. Wegmans has a key role
to play by working with other retailers and its NGO partner
to address human rights abuses in the seafood industry,
and should be commended for sending a letter to Congress
asking it to pass the IUU Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015.

3. Hy-Vee maintained its momentum this year, gaining over
half a point and moving past Safeway and Trader Joe’s to
enter the good category. Hy-Vee discontinued top-tier Red
List species Chilean sea bass for sustainability reasons, in
a move that Whole Foods, Wegmans, and Safeway should
immediately follow. Hy-Vee continues to use its Seafoodies
blog to communicate to its customers, including why it
dropped Chilean sea bass and why it will not source geneti-
cally modified (GMO) seafood. The retailer twice sent letters
to Congress in support of action against IUU fishing and
refuses to purchase from vessels on Greenpeace’s Blacklist,
a database of fishing vessels and companies engaged in
IUU fishing. This year Hy-Vee shared its sustainability story in
the media and at industry events like the SeaWeb Seafood
Summit. To continue its momentum, Hy-Vee must develop a
sustainable canned tuna policy, increase available sustain-
ability information at the point of sale, and continue to take a
strong leadership position among retailers confronting human
rights abuses in the seafood industry.

4. Safeway’s score decreased slightly this year and is now
ranked in fourth place. While Safeway remains in the top five
and ranked in the good category, there is concern on the
horizon due to its recent merger with Albertsons. Albertsons’
leadership must prioritize sustainable seafood with the same
tenacity with which Safeway has in the past. Safeway joined
a majority of top five retailers by sending a letter to Congress
in support of the IUU Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015. The
retailer is also on track to reach its 2015 sustainability goals
for wild-caught and farmed seafood. However, Safeway still
carries several Red List species and should immediately
drop Chilean sea bass. There are lingering concerns about
the sustainability of Safeway’s tuna sourcing for its private
label canned tuna products, and it is critical that the retailer
develop a strong canned tuna policy this year.

5. Target gained nearly half a point this year and enters the
top five for the first time since 2012, though is just shy of
entering the good category. Target is the only top five retailer
that does not sell farmed salmon. Last fall, Target introduced
sustainably caught pole and line skipjack and albacore
canned tuna under its Simply Balanced brand, which features
an easy-to-read and informative label. Target must develop
a sustainable canned tuna policy and convert its larger (by
volume) Market Pantry brand to more sustainably caught tuna
to continue this leadership. The retailer increased its point-
of-sale signage by adding user-friendly sustainability decals
on freezer cases. Target is increasing its focus on human
rights abuses, meeting with Thai government officials, labor
organizations, and vendors to address the shrimp supply
chain. Target must continue to weigh in publicly on human
rights abuses by, for example, sending a letter to Congress
like the other top five retailers. Target is the only retailer in the
top five that has refused to call for protections of the Bering
Sea Canyons. In the year ahead, Target will have several
opportunities to continue—and deepen—its leadership.

SLAVERY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES
IN THE SEAFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN

Nearly 21 million men, women, and children globally
are trapped in forced labor,4 deceived or coerced to work in a range of sometimes fatal
situations against their will. The global seafood industry is among several sectors at high
risk of this egregious violation of human rights.

As fish stocks decline from overfishing, industrial fleets expand, and demand increases
for cheap seafood, companies are increasingly motivated to employ cheap or forced
labor and to fish illegally.5, 6 Fishing operators use human trafficking networks to crew
ships, and use “debt bondage, violence, intimidation and murder to keep crews in line
and maintain cheap seafood on supermarket shelves.”7

In the last edition of Carting Away the Oceans, we raised the issue of human rights
abuses in the seafood industry. Non-governmental organizations have expressed
concerns for years.8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Recently, a flood of media coverage has revealed the
pervasive and human rights abuses in the seafood industry. A major story last year13
revealed slavery in the Thai shrimp industry connected to the world’s largest shrimp
farmer, Thailand-based Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods. Retailers took notice when the
article connected slavery to Walmart, Costco, and ALDI—just a handful of major buyers
(including many other retailers not named in the article) that purchase from CP Foods.

In March, the Associated Press reported on slavery among Indonesian fleets,14 and
just a month later the European Union (EU) issued Thailand a yellow card for not taking
significant steps to address IUU fishing.15 This means that the country has until October
to crack down on illegal fishing, or it will face a trade ban on its fish exports to the EU. In
May, Thailand yet again made headlines with mass graves of suspected human trafficking
victims at trafficking camps16, 17 and trafficking victims abandoned at sea.18, 19, 20, 21

SLAVERY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES
IN THE SEAFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN

Labor abuses often go unchecked by many government
officials, who are sometimes complicit with the most
egregious actors in the global fishing industry. For
example, Thai officials sent a letter to Thai IUU fishing
operators, requesting that these vessels offload catches
during a specific window to hide from monitors and
avoid penalties.22 Even when governments do act to
catch IUU vessels instead of aiding and abetting them,
penalties are minor at best. Fines in Thailand are very
low ($75–$90), when imposed at all, and the number of
vessels caught (only 68 trawlers in 2014) is a fraction of
the total number of vessels involved in IUU fishing.23 In
Indonesia, government officials have historically failed
to address widespread and severe abuse of workers,
as well as colluded with Thai officials to allow human
trafficking in the fishing industry.24, 25

While media coverage has largely highlighted problems
in Thailand and Indonesia, the U.S. State Department
has reported slavery on fishing vessels in more than
50 countries.26, 27 Abuse of crewmembers and IUU
fishing are deeply connected. Companies engaged in

labor abuses often engage in destructive or illegal
fishing and have little regard for fishery management
regulations.28, 29, 30 As a direct result of overfishing,
many coastal stocks are depleted and vessels must
travel further out into the High Seas to fish. Rather
than lose precious fishing time and incur increased
costs of returning to port, the industry increasingly
relies on transshipment at sea, where smaller boats
refuel, restock, and transfer catch onto larger cargo
vessels. This practice turns fishing boats into floating
prisons, and enables vessels to hide illegally caught
fish and/or mistreat crew members. Many trafficked
and abused workers are forced to remain at sea with
no means of escape, and men have reported being
at sea for years. 31, 32, 33

Greenpeace has documented these deplorable
working conditions on tuna purse seiners and
longline vessels. Fishermen on a longline tuna vessel
in the Western Pacific Ocean told Greenpeace they
had not been to port in 18 months, were treated
badly by crew, and were forced to live in terrible
conditions.34 If a supplier like Thai Union—the world’s
largest canned tuna processor35—relies on trans-
shipment at sea to operate, then it is reasonable to
be concerned about its supply chain. Tuna can be
commingled from several different sources with rela-
tive ease, obfuscating the supply chain and erasing
detection of tuna caught in an illegal or unethical
manner.36, 37

Following several major international scandals the
seafood industry is starting to respond. Unfortu-
nately, retailers have not always been forthcoming
on human rights issues, nor have they fully engaged
with law enforcement to find solutions.

page 14

SLAVERY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES
IN THE SEAFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN

Some retailers may want to use third party certifications to
solve the problem. While certifications are useful tools, there
is no certification scheme or combination of certifications that
can assure any company or customer that seafood is truly
sustainable or unassociated with human rights abuses. It is
inadequate for any retailer to rely solely on sourcing 100%
Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or Best Aquaculture
Practices (BAP) certified products, as many third party
certifications are ripe with unresolved concerns.39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44,
45, 46 Retailers need to conduct their own supply chain audits
and hold suppliers accountable with legally binding contracts
that ensure all traceability and sustainability concerns are
being addressed and risks minimized.

Retailers must develop robust standards based on Inter-
national Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions47 that hold
suppliers accountable, and must perform unannounced visits
to inspect operations. Workers should be able to associate
freely and negotiate with their employer for better working
conditions. They should also have access to legally binding
grievance procedures in the workplace to ensure they can be
their own auditors and have the protection to report abuses
without retaliation. Retailers must hold human rights standards
in the same high regard as quality and sustainability standards
when considering any supplier or product.

The global seafood industry, governments, and NGOs must
come together to develop systemic changes. Some U.S.
retailers have begun efforts to track their supply chains, con-
sult experts, and engage in dialogue with key stakeholders.
Whole Foods, Wegmans, Hy-Vee, Safeway, Ahold, and Giant
Eagle have all called on Congress to pass the IUU Fishing
Enforcement Act of 2015, which would strengthen measures
to prevent importation of IUU seafood. Many other retailers
have attended working group meetings, spoken on panels,
and visited suppliers in Southeast Asia. Greenpeace supports
these initial steps from retailers, and expects continued
collaboration, as no single piece of legislation, certification
scheme, or policy document will be sufficient.

In December 2014, INTERPOL, an intergovernmental
organization facilitating international police cooperation, held
a special session on human rights abuses at sea during
its annual conference on human trafficking. Despite being
invited, no industry representatives attended.

According to the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Busi-
ness and Human Rights38, even if a business “has not con-
tributed to an adverse human rights impact, but that impact
is nevertheless directly linked to its operations, products or
services by its business relationship with another entity,” that
business is responsible. In other words, retailers profiting from
the lower prices that come from the use of forced labor have
a responsibility to prevent or mitigate the harmful impacts of
human rights violations in their supply chain.

The deplorable conditions many seafood workers are forced
to endure cannot continue and establishing a more just sea-
food trade requires attention and solutions from across the
retail sector, including measurable, time-bound commitments
from retailers. Seafood companies, vessels, operators,
processors, and retailers must assure consumers and
governments through robust checks and balances that
their activities and products do not violate any labor or
environmental laws throughout the supply chain.

The burden is on both the industry and retailers to
ensure that forced labor and abuse is not present in
supply chains and that fishers and factory workers
who provide the industry seafood are treated, and
paid, fairly. There is no excuse for failing to act against
human rights abuses, and the Carting Away the
Oceans report will increase its focus in the coming
years to assess retailers on efforts to confront these
atrocities.

SLAVERY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES
IN THE SEAFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN

While the solutions are multifaceted, there are several key steps retailers must take immediately to help eliminate labor
abuses at sea and on land:

1.  Publicly commit to customers, shareholders, and industry stakeholders to address forced labor and labor abuse.

2.  Consult human rights organizations and develop an action plan to clean up their own supply chains.

3.  Develop public sourcing policies and goals requiring that wild and farmed seafood are only sourced from sustain-
able and socially responsible suppliers operating in compliance with international labor standards (ILO Core
Conventions, ILO Maritime Labour Convention, and ILO Work in Fishing Convention).48

4.  Develop standards that ensure basic human rights for workers involved in the supply chain and set standards

for migrant workers that suppliers must uphold. Retailers must require that suppliers forbid recruitment fees for
workers, provide accurate crew manifests (reviewed when boats leave and return to port), and have contracts
written in a language employees understand.

5.  Ensure chain of custody from vessels, farms, feed mills (used in aquaculture), and factories to store shelves.
Ensure the names and addresses of all entities that handled a product can be identified. At the point of sale,
provide clear, robust information to customers on labels and online.

6.  Do not source from any vessels that transship (transfer their catches) at sea.

7.  Refuse to source from any vessels or companies on Greenpeace’s Blacklist
or official international blacklists, consulting these resources monthly. Refuse
to source from any company sanctioned for illegal activities related to the
capture and trade of fish, or any company connected with labor law abuses.

8.  Employ third party audits and work with human rights experts to perform

unannounced visits and conduct worker interviews throughout supply chain
operations. Workers must be a critical part of setting standards and can help
ensure compliance with these standards.

Hy-Vee, Target, and Wegmans actively
consult international blacklists to inform
their purchasing practices. Hy-Vee and
Wegmans go a step further by consulting
the Greenpeace Blacklist, which includes
additional vessels that are not listed for
political reasons in official blacklists.

9.  Retailers must have upfront conversations with suppliers before signing contracts. Ask suppliers key questions

about their supply chain, sustainability, and labor standards. Ask them how they recruit their workers and to stop
using recruitment fees, which are often used to exploit migrant workers.

10.  Demand that governments and the fishing industry prioritize enforcement of IUU fishing by no longer allowing
unregulated labor brokers to recruit workers, enforcing existing laws, developing sensible fishery management
systems, and creating systems to identify and support survivors of forced labor and labor abuse. Governments
must reform labor migration systems so workers are not bound to their employers.

Greenpeace will continue to highlight human rights abuses and IUU fishing in the global seafood industry, though
strongly recommends that retailers contact organizations specializing in labor and human rights, including the
Environmental Justice Foundation, Human Rights at Sea, Human Rights Watch, International Labor Rights Forum,
International Transport Workers Federation, International Union of Food Workers, and the Solidarity Center.

Retailers can no longer plead ignorance about these issues and must take urgent action. As the top ten U.S. retailers
by revenue, Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Albertsons-Safeway, Publix, Ahold, H-E-B, Delhaize, SUPERVALU, and Meijer all
bear significant responsibility in leading the sector. However, all U.S. retailers bear responsibility and must take
action. All major seafood buyers are responsible for cleaning up the supply chain.

Greenpeace urges retailers and the global seafood industry to act. The world is watching and demanding change.

CANNED TUNA

A Call to Action for Ocean Safe Tuna

Last year’s Carting Away the Oceans report brought attention to one
of the most popular, and concerning, seafood products found on
supermarket shelves—canned tuna. Earlier this year, Greenpeace
investigated well-known brands sold in the U.S. and rated them on
sustainability and social responsibility. Our evaluation revealed that
around 80% of canned tuna found on supermarket shelves comes
from destructive, irresponsible, and wasteful tuna fishing practices.
The country’s major retailers are heavily implicated in this, but can also
play a critical role in ensuring 100% of canned tuna is ocean safe49 for
their consumers.

The three biggest brands—StarKist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the
Sea—source the majority of the irresponsibly caught tuna tainting the
retail sector. Retailers are guilty by association because they sell these
brands or are supplied by them, and in most cases also fail to offer
better tuna under their private label brands. Greenpeace created the
Tuna Shopping Guide to highlight which companies have joined the
growing sustainable tuna movement, and to provide tuna consumers
with guidance on better options and brands to avoid. While the list of
red-rated tuna brands is long, the green-rated list is growing steadily
with new, price-competitive alternatives to destructive brands.

Tuna brands and retailers must only offer sustainable choices for
their customers and to help ensure a brighter future for our oceans
and coastal fishing communities. Furthermore, tuna suppliers, vessel
operators, and processors must heed the urgent calls for reform
across the industry and ensure that no tuna operations are involved
in slavery or labor abuse (see pg. 11). Retailers can help make this
possible by creating comprehensive policies covering all private label
and national brand canned tuna. A retailer’s policy must ensure that
tuna is traceable from vessel to shelf, comes from healthy stocks, uses
ocean safe fishing methods, and is supplied only from companies with
strong labor and human rights standards.50 Retailers must include a
time-bound commitment in their policies to signal to the world how
quickly they will transition away from dirty tuna supply chains. While
many retailers have sustainable seafood commitments of some form,
only Giant Eagle has a specific policy for sourcing sustainable, socially
responsible canned tuna.

Four years ago, Whole Foods was the first retailer in the U.S. to
introduce sustainable private label canned tuna. Since then, momen-
tum has increased. As of publication, six retailers, including some of
the nation’s biggest (Costco and Safeway), now offer more sustainable
private label products. The writing is on the wall for retailers and the
three biggest tuna brands. With more sustainable options available from
companies like Wild Planet, American Tuna, Pacifical, and Tri Marine,
retailers have no excuse not to source more sustainable, socially
responsible products. Furthermore, if the three biggest tuna companies
refuse to change their sourcing practices, they will continue to lose
market share and credibility as new market leaders emerge.

Outside the U.S., retailers are helping make significant changes in tuna supply chains.
The U.K. is the second largest canned tuna market in the world and a market leader
on sustainability. All major U.K. retailers have met their commitments to source only
ocean safe tuna.51, 52 In Australia, all major (national and private label) brands are set
to offer sustainable tuna by end of this year.53 At the European Tuna Conference,
representatives from NorgesGruppen (Norway’s largest retailer) made clear that they
only want sustainable, socially responsible tuna products that are not associated with
forced labor.

Even the foodservice sector is demonstrating leadership in sustainability. This
January, Compass Group,54 and subsidiary Bon Appétit Management Company,55
switched to sourcing 100% of its skipjack tuna from purse seines fishing on free-
schools. The rest of the foodservice sector must follow suit and clean up its supply
chain immediately. Aramark and Sodexo, as well as broadline distributors Sysco and
U.S. Foods, must rise to the challenge and offer ocean safe tuna.

U.S. retailers and major brands have the power to provide more sustainable tuna and
influence the overall industry direction. It is time for retailers to stop making excuses
for inaction and instead assert their leadership. Greenpeace’s global tuna campaign
will continue to reveal information about the sustainability concerns and human rights
abuses associated with the tuna industry. Retailers would be wise to heed this call
to clean up their supply chains by developing sustainable sourcing policies and only
offering ocean safe tuna.

PROTECTING THE BERING SEA CANYONS

Scientists conducted camera-drop surveys in order to validate
earlier models that predict the presence of coral and sponge
habitat. This government research, the first conducted since
the NPFMC made the canyons a high priority research item in
2006, validates the numerous proposals and public requests
to protect the canyons and Green Belt. Preliminary results
confirm that Pribilof Canyon alone likely contains half of the
coral habitat in the Bering Sea. In addition to the adjacent
slope, this area may hold up to 90% of all Bering Sea corals.
The Zhemchug Ridges in the largest canyon may contain
some of the most ecologically valuable habitat in the Bering
Sea. The ridges contain countless sponges, which, like
corals, provide important habitat for spawning and juvenile
fish and are highly vulnerable to fishing gear.

To date, eleven retailers have supported a call to protect the
canyons and Green Belt. In the first half of this year alone,
Whole Foods, Wegmans, Costco, Giant Eagle, Roundy’s,
and Southeastern Grocers joined the chorus calling on the
NPFMC to take action. Even the foodservice sector is adding
its support. Bon Appétit Management Company recently
called on the NPFMC to protect the canyons and even asked
a major supplier to offer products sourced from outside of
the canyons. If only retailers and other major buyers shared
this level of commitment, our oceans would be in much better
shape.

Support from major retailers. Greenpeace commends
these eleven retailers for calling on the NFPMC to protect
the Bering Sea Canyons: Ahold, Costco, Giant Eagle, Hy-Vee,
Roundy’s, Safeway, Southeastern Grocers, SUPERVALU,
Trader Joe’s, Wegmans, and Whole Foods Market.

How Supermarkets Can Invest in an Insurance Policy for
“America’s Fish Basket”

About half of all the seafood landed in the U.S. comes
from the Bering Sea, aptly coined “America’s Fish Basket.”
The Bering Sea is home to the world’s largest underwater
canyons, Zhemchug and Pribilof. These canyons contain
fragile corals and sponges that sustain a rich and complex
ecosystem, and are important for marine life and people alike.

The canyons are located along the highly productive “Green
Belt,” a vast shelf-break zone that draws fish, birds, sea mam-
mals and fishers year after year. This unique area is where
vital, yet vulnerable, coral and sponge habitat is located in the
Bering Sea.

Despite the enormous economic and ecological importance
of the Green Belt, this is the only major habitat type in the
Bering Sea where no areas are protected from fishing.

Retailers play an incredibly important role in ensuring the
Bering Sea is able to continue providing much of America’s
seafood, including pollock, crab, halibut, and Pacific cod. As
major seafood buyers, retailers have tremendous leverage
to influence progressive policies. Some NGOs that advise
retailers, like Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP), recom-
mend that responsible companies source from fisheries that
are not impacting important seafloor habitats, and that these
companies drive improvements in areas where damage to
underwater habitat from fishing gear remains a problem.56

Fishing methods used in the canyons and Green Belt involve
heavy gear that makes contact with the seafloor. Scientific
evidence has shown this to be the greatest threat to corals
and sponges in Alaska, potentially destroying essential
habitat and breeding grounds for key species.57 According to
government scientists, the slope along the Green Belt is most
vulnerable to damage from trawl fisheries, particularly the
Alaska pollock fishery.58

The majority of fishing activity in the canyons is for Alaska
pollock and Pacific cod, yet these fisheries catch under four
percent of their total catch there.59 Therefore, it is reason-
able to set aside a representative portion of the Bering Sea
Canyons to create marine protected areas that can preserve
the region’s long-standing biodiversity.

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC), the
body tasked by the Federal government to manage fisheries
and conservation in the region, has received unprecedented
amounts of public input urging protections for the canyons.
This interest spurred valuable new government research in
the Green Belt last year.

PROTECTING THE BERING SEA CANYONS

Protecting the canyons would mean employing ecosystem-
based management: a precautionary, science-based tool
that is part of a balanced approach to preserving fishing
grounds. This would protect key habitats that are important
for commercial species, other marine life, and the indigenous
communities that depend on a healthy and resilient Bering
Sea ecosystem.

For seafood businesses, setting aside a portion of the
canyons and Green Belt habitat provides a valuable insurance
policy that can help ensure the future health of the ecosystem
and the fisheries it sustains. With the increasing impacts
of climate change and ocean acidification, as well as the
cumulative degradation of seafloor habitat by industrial fishing
gear, creating a buffer against uncertainty makes sense from
both an economic and ecological perspective.

At the upcoming October NPFMC meeting, fishery managers
will decide if the process to identify conservation measures
for the canyons and Green Belt will continue. This is a key
moment for retailers to make good on their sustainability
commitments and ask that the NPFMC does its job by
protecting the Bering Sea Canyons.

New government science confirms the unique nature of the Bering Sea slope, known as the Green Belt. Nearly
all of the high value coral habitat in the Bering Sea is found in this zone, yet none of it has been protected.

Headquarters: Austin, Texas

Stores and Banners: 402 stores in the U.S. operating as Whole
Foods Market and Harry’s Farmers Market

Background: Whole Foods Market is the world’s largest purveyor
of natural and organic products. Its FY 2014 sales were $14.2
billion. Approximately $13.7 billion of that was from the U.S., and
the remainder was from sales in Canada and the U.K.

Greenpeace Comments: Whole Foods remains the number one
ranked retailer in Carting Away the Oceans, for the third year in a
row. It improved in nearly every category, resulting in the highest
score ever for a retailer in this report. Since our last report, Whole
Foods has strengthened its wild and farmed seafood policies,
was the top-ranked private label brand in Greenpeace USA’s
canned tuna ranking, and was the only retailer to sign a coalition
letter with major buyers in support of the Illegal, Unreported, and
Unregulated (IUU) Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015. Whole Foods,
invested in the long-term health of fisheries and the ecosystems
that support them, called on the North Pacific Fishery Manage-
ment Council (NPFMC) to diligently review all available science as
it considers important decisions about protecting the Bering Sea
Canyons. The retailer can lead on sustainable tuna if it creates a
canned tuna policy and tightens its supply chain so that its tuna is
ocean safe and ensures fair treatment of workers.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Whole Foods strengthened its
already robust sourcing policy this year by adopting tighter stan-
dards for farmed molluscs. Whole Foods leads retailers with its
more sustainable canned tuna products and has an opportunity
to create a policy that serves as a model for the retail sector if it
focuses on ensuring chain of custody, and sourcing only from best
practice fishing methods and healthy tuna stocks. Whole Foods
continues to work with scientific and environmental organizations
to inform its sourcing. The company’s aquaculture policy includes
a strong public stance against GMO seafood. This policy requires
that fish farms minimize the environmental impacts of their opera-
tions, having protocols that prevent fish escaping from farms, and
adhering to sustainable maximum stocking density limits. Antibiot-
ics, growth hormones, and poultry and mammalian by-products
may not be used in feed. Finally, strong traceability measures
ensure that farmed seafood is tracked from farm to store. To build
on this momentum, Whole Foods could also be more active in the
policy and regulatory arena for aquaculture improvement.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Whole Foods is a strong
advocate for change on the water. Understanding that marine pro-
tected areas are critical for the health of our oceans and longevity
of its business, Whole Foods called on the NPFMC to seriously
consider the science on sensitive marine habitats as it makes an
important decision about protecting the Bering Sea Canyons. In

April, Whole Foods added its name to a letter signed by a coalition
of major seafood buyers calling on the House of Representatives
to pass IUU fishing enforcement legislation. The company uses
systems like Trace Register to monitor its supply chain and
requires a high level of traceability for fresh, frozen, and some
shelf-stable products. In February, Whole Foods participated in
panels at the SeaWeb Seafood Summit, calling for collaboration to
confront human rights abuses in the seafood industry. As a leader
in the retail sector, Whole Foods can play an important role in
bringing along others to tackle labor abuse and IUU fishing.

Labeling and Transparency: Relying on the expertise of the
Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) and the Safina Center, Whole
Foods has a pronounced labeling system to communicate to
customers at the point of sale. Customers clearly know whether
an item is green or yellow-rated, or MSC certified. The company
shares its policies online, keeps customers informed on its
seafood blog, and occasionally encourages customers to add
their voices to important sustainability issues. Seafood counter
staff are trained to answer questions about sourcing and catch
methods. Whole Food’s Pole & Line brand canned tuna products,
sourced by American Tuna, have a user-friendly traceability format.
Each can informs shoppers about the fishing vessel, species,
and year it was caught. There is also a scannable barcode for
more information about pole and line fishing as well as the fishers.
To improve its score, Whole Foods could offer more information
across categories, such as detailed fishing or aquaculture method,
scientific name, and the U.N. Food and Aquaculture Organization
(FAO) catch area.

Red List Seafood Sales: While Whole Foods has among the
strongest sourcing policies and employs a variety of mitigation
tools to reduce the harm of carrying an unmitigated Red List prod-
uct, it does not perform well in this category. Unfortunately, this
year Whole Foods reintroduced skates and rays, which are caught
in a way that destroys seafloor habitats. As an industry leader,
Whole Foods should not sell Canadian longline-caught swordfish
(with its high bycatch rates) and bigeye tuna (a vulnerable species).
Whole Foods must also drop Chilean sea bass, as it should not be
sold anywhere. Taking these steps would mean the company is
more effectively putting its commitments into practice.

Whole Foods sells 14 of the 22 Red List species: Atlantic
halibut, Chilean sea bass, Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic
salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, bigeye tuna, Greenland halibut,
monkfish, red snapper, skates and rays, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Stores and Banners: 85 stores operating as Wegmans

Background: Wegmans is a privately held company, founded in
1916 by the Wegman family. Its FY 2014 sales were $7.4 billion.
Wegmans has stores in Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

Greenpeace Comments: Wegmans remains in the coveted
good category this year, ascending past Safeway for the first
time since 2010 to command second place in this year’s report.
Wegmans prides itself on sustainable seafood, and invests
its resources and staff time to prioritize this important work.
Demonstrating leadership alongside this year’s top five retailers,
Wegmans sent a letter to the NPFMC in support of protecting the
Bering Sea Canyons. Greenpeace commends this leadership,
which follows Wegmans’ advocacy in other areas (e.g., not sourc-
ing its own brand Alaska pollock from the Bering Sea Canyons
or not souring from the Ross Sea). Citing sustainability concerns,
Wegmans dropped skates and rays, leading to an improved Red
List score. Wegmans joined several retailers calling on Congress
to pass important legislation to address IUU fishing. A key to its
future success will be developing a strong tuna policy and provid-
ing sustainable private label canned tuna products.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Wegmans offers a publicly
available, robust sustainable seafood policy on wild and farmed
products. Stock strength, bycatch rates, and social impacts are
taken into account. Farmed products are sourced from suppliers
that are working to “minimize or eliminate the use of wild fish in
the feed, pesticides, and antibiotics.” The retailer also strives to
avoid patronizing farms that cause undue habitat alteration and/
or land loss, are associated with human rights abuses, or source
broodstock from red-grade fisheries. Wegmans is the only top five
retailer that does not offer sustainable private label canned tuna in
its stores. Wegmans needs to develop a robust shelf-stable policy
that covers sustainable, socially responsible private label and
national brand canned tuna products, and prioritize converting its
private label products this year.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Wegmans continued its
work to protect sensitive habitats by sending a letter calling on the
NPFMC to consider Bering Sea Canyons protection. In addition,
Wegmans does not source its private label brand Alaska pollock
from the Bering Sea Canyons. This is by far the strongest stance
of any retailer and Greenpeace commends Wegmans for its
commitment to the canyons. Every month, Wegmans checks
vessels, companies, and countries on the Greenpeace Blacklist
to ensure it is not sourcing from IUU operations. Greenpeace
applauds Wegmans for this level of diligence. Wegmans is working
with its NGO partner to identify ways to address human rights
abuses in the seafood industry. The retailer should continue to
leverage its leadership position in the sector by asking groups like
the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) Sustainable Seafood Committee
to prioritize collaboration among retailers to address slavery and
IUU fishing in the global seafood industry.

Labeling and Transparency: Wegmans has a fair amount
of data available for consumers at the point of sale, including
port of landing and catch vessel. It is adding scientific names to
packaging to better inform customers. Wegmans can continue to
improve by making this information available on all of its products,
especially labels indicating catch method and sustainability status.
The company’s seafood sourcing policy is available online and in
print, through a comprehensive, user-friendly website. Wegmans
employees receive mandatory training so that they are knowl-
edgeable about seafood choices, labeling, and sustainability.
This training program appears to be well resourced and is being
updated to include new online content.

Red List Seafood Sales: This is the retailer’s poorest category,
though over the past year Wegmans made good-faith efforts
to mitigate some of the harms associated with sourcing certain
Red List species (e.g., more responsible methods of capture).
Wegmans dropped skates and rays, which helped boost its
score. Higher scores in other categories buffer Wegmans’ average
performance in this category, allowing it to come in second place
overall.

Wegmans sells 13 of the 22 Red List species: Atlantic halibut,
Chilean sea bass, Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallop, bigeye tuna, ocean quahog, red snapper,
South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and
yellowfin tuna.

Stores and Banners: 218 supermarkets operating as Hy-Vee

Background: Hy-Vee is an employee-owned private company
with stores located throughout the Midwest. Its FY 2014 sales
were $8.7 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: After its Carting Away the Oceans
debut last year, Hy-Vee doubled down on its strong performance,
coming in third place overall and entering the good category for
the first time. Whole Foods, Wegmans, and Safeway take note:
Hy-Vee means business about sustainable seafood. There’s no
telling what’s next for this ambitious Midwest retailer that has com-
pletely transformed its seafood program in just a few short years.
Hy-Vee dropped Chilean sea bass, issued a strong public state-
ment against GMO seafood, is on track to hit its 2015 sustain-
ability goals, and twice weighed in at key moments to address IUU
fishing in the industry by sending letters to Congress. Hy-Vee tells
its sustainability story to its customers and shares best practices
within the sector in a collaborative way. Greenpeace encourages
the retailer to continue driving change in the sector and to work
across the seafood industry to confront forced labor and human
rights abuses.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Hy-Vee has a fresh, frozen,
and shelf-stable policy. Last year, the retailer made significant
improvements by converting some of its private label canned
tuna to pole and line caught sources. Hy-Vee must now develop
a sustainable canned tuna policy that includes a time-bound plan
to ensure all of its private label and national brand products are
sourced in a sustainable, socially responsible manner. Hy-Vee’s
strong wild-caught standards prohibit sourcing from the Ross Sea
and its farmed seafood standards are improving as it moves to
more sustainable sourcing. Greenpeace commends the retailer for
publicly announcing its commitment to avoid GMO seafood.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Hy-Vee has strong
standards that its suppliers must fulfill, and uses an external
party to monitor annually for compliance. It refuses to purchase
from vessels found on the Greenpeace Blacklist. Hy-Vee can
strengthen these policies by refusing to purchase seafood that is
not traceable back to the vessel or farm that harvested it, as well
as refusing to buy seafood that was transshipped at sea. Hy-Vee
sent two separate letters to congressional leadership urging pas-
sage of legislation to address IUU fishing. Hy-Vee trains suppliers
on its policy requirements and advocates for supplier participation
in industry improvements. The retailer uses a robust staff training
program, though unfortunately it is not mandatory for all staff at
this time. Hy-Vee is a strong voice in the Food Marketing Institute’s

(FMI) seafood working group, spends significant time consulting
with its NGO partner FishWise for recommendations, and is
telling its sustainability story on panels at events like the SeaWeb
Seafood Summit. Following last year’s letter to the NPFMC urging
protection of the Bering Sea Canyons, its senior leadership called
suppliers directly to have exploratory conversations about ways
to avoid sourcing from the canyons. Hy-Vee could join Wegmans
by ensuring its private label Alaska pollock is not sourced from the
canyons.

Labeling and Transparency: This is Hy-Vee’s poorest category,
though with further attention the retailer could make big gains.
Hy-Vee uses its simplified Responsible Choice label to inform
customers of products that meet its policies, and only does so if
the products being sold that day are in compliance with the policy.
Hy-Vee’s Seafoodies blog shares important sustainability updates
on its policy and goals, and informs customers about issues
like traceability and advocacy. Using online resources, in-store
signage, and well-trained staff to educate shoppers is an effective
communication strategy that other retailers should employ. While
Hy-Vee made small gains in labeling this year, the retailer needs
to add more information on labels like scientific name, FAO catch
area, and detailed fishing or aquaculture methods.

Red List Seafood Sales: Hy-Vee continues its impressive
leadership, discontinuing Chilean sea bass due to sustainability
concerns and explaining to its customers through its Seafoodies
blog about why it stopped selling this top-tier Red List species.
Hy-Vee’s decision to educate its customers on why it is important
to not sell unsustainable seafood could serve as a valuable model
for other retailers to follow.

Hy-Vee sells eight of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pol-
lock, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, ocean quahog, South
Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin
tuna. Hy-Vee is a proponent of FIPs for several species, and
avoids selling many of the species that other retailers carry. Nearly
all of its wild-caught shrimp is from Texas and Louisiana FIPs that

Headquarters: Pleasanton, CA

Stores and Banners: 1,326 stores operating as Safeway, Carrs,
Randall’s, Tom Thumb, and VONS

Background: Safeway is one of the largest grocery chains in the
United States, ranked fourth by annual revenue. Its FY 2014 sales
were $37.1 billion. In early 2015, in a deal that has had enormous
significance in the grocery retail industry, Safeway sold all of its
stores to Albertsons. For most of the preceding 12-month period,
Safeway was still its own entity, and is therefore profiled separately
from Albertsons in this report.

Greenpeace Comments: Amid significant transition following its
merger with Albertsons, Safeway continues to remain in the good
ranked category. However, with Wegmans and Hy-Vee zipping
ahead of the retailer this year, there is now more competition at
the top. The retailer is on track to reach its year-end goal to source
more sustainable wild or farmed seafood. Safeway sent a letter to
congressional leadership urging passage of legislation to address
IUU fishing. While Safeway continues to move forward on its
company-wide goals, there are major challenges ahead to bring
laggard Albertsons along on the journey. Safeway has yet to create
a strong sustainable canned tuna policy and improve its supply,
as questions remain about its private label FAD-free skipjack tuna
sourcing. This year is a big moment for Albertsons-Safeway to
prioritize sustainable seafood with the same tenacity Safeway has
demonstrated in years past.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Safeway has strong wild and
farmed seafood policies, but must invest heavily in strengthening
its shelf-stable policy this year. Safeway took significant steps to
convert its private label skipjack canned tuna to more responsible
sourcing; however, it failed Greenpeace’s canned tuna ranking
earlier this year after declining to participate, which raised ques-
tions about what is actually in the cans. Safeway must produce
a strong canned tuna policy that addresses both the company’s
own brand and national brand tuna products. The retailer is on
track to source only green- and yellow-rated MBA Seafood Watch
seafood by December, and sources a minimum BAP 2-star farmed
shrimp. Nearly all of its wild-caught shrimp is MBA green-rated.
The company must build on its commitment to not source GMO
salmon by publicly committing to not source any GMO seafood at
all.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Safeway is an active voice
in the policy and improvement arenas, standing up to protect the
Bering Sea Canyons by writing two letters to the NPFMC, despite
pressure from industry players that want to maintain the status
quo and risk the degradation or collapse of important Alaskan
fisheries. Greenpeace encourages Safeway to continue this
leadership at key moments this year. Safeway spoke at panels
on human rights at the SeaWeb Seafood Summit and called on
Congress to pass the lUU Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015, using
its name to influence important conversations. Safeway meets with
industry players like the Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA) to im-
prove standards. The retailer can improve by refusing to purchase
seafood transshipped at sea and by only buying from suppliers
that source from well-managed farms. Albertsons-Safeway must
continue this advocacy, especially given that the merged company
will be one of the largest grocery retailers in the nation.

Labeling and Transparency: Safeway shares its policies online,
communicates about sustainable tuna products with online
videos, and updates its customers on progress toward its 2015
sustainable seafood goals. Safeway has increased point-of-sale in-
formation by providing in-store brochures and by labeling products
with a Responsible Choice logo if they meet its sustainability
requirements (e.g., MBA green or yellow-rated seafood). However,
store visits nationwide did not find any Responsible Choice labels
on products at the seafood counter. While Greenpeace com-
mends Safeway for introducing this labeling system, the retailer
needs to increase signage explaining this system and place labels
on products so customers can make informed choices. Ideally
this would include information that has been “under development”
since 2013, like the aquaculture method used and the farm in
which the seafood was cultivated.

Red List Seafood Sales: Like Whole Foods and Wegmans,
Safeway sells several Red List species. While the retailer is com-
mitted to avoiding Chilean sea bass from the Ross Sea, there is no
excuse for Safeway to carry this fish at all. While Safeway prides
itself on Fair Trade-certified yellowfin tuna, it cannot take pride in
its bigeye tuna sourcing. Regardless of catch method, most bigeye
and yellowfin tuna stocks are in trouble, and Safeway should at the
very least discontinue bigeye tuna immediately.

Safeway sells 12 of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, bigeye tuna,
Chilean sea bass, ocean quahog, red snapper, South Atlantic
albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna. Ap-
proximately half of Safeway’s bigeye and yellowfin tuna is sourced
from FIPs based out of Indonesia and the Marshall Islands. Only
a small fraction of its wild shrimp and swordfish are sourced from
their respective FIPs.

Headquarters: Minneapolis, Minnesota

Store and Banners: 1,552 across the U.S. (that include
expanded food assortments), operating as Target, SuperTarget,
CityTarget, and TargetExpress

Background: Target has built a “big box” store concept and its
grocery division offers groceries, organic products, and household
goods. In FY 2014, consumables (food and pet supplies) ac-
counted for $15.6 billion, or 21% of total sales.

Greenpeace Comments: Target made an impressive jump to
fifth place this year after gaining nearly half a point in its score. The
improvement is in large part due to its introduction of pole and
line-caught skipjack and albacore under its private label Simply
Balanced brand. Greenpeace commends Target on this important
step forward; however, the retailer must now develop a sustainable
canned tuna policy that converts its larger (by volume) private label
brand, Market Pantry, and all national brand products to sustain-
able tuna. In order to maintain its position in the top five, Target
must continue to improve labeling and transparency, maintain its
focus on confronting human rights abuses in the fishing industry,
and advocate for marine protected areas. The company is set
to hit its year-end goal of sourcing responsibly caught seafood
according to MBA Seafood Watch ratings.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Target’s seafood policy covers
fresh, frozen, and some shelf-stable items. Target took a big
step forward by converting its Simply Balanced canned tuna to
more sustainable sources. The retailer now needs to convert its
larger (by volume) Market Pantry brand canned tuna products
to FAD-free or pole and line caught, in addition to developing a
public-facing canned tuna policy. While Target is committed to not
source GMO salmon and has taken a strong stance on avoiding
all farmed salmon, it must follow top five retailer Hy-Vee’s lead by
publicly sharing its commitment to not source GMO seafood at all.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Target increased its public
advocacy, whether by sharing its traceability best practices on a
panel at the SeaWeb Seafood Summit or meeting with the Thai
government officials and key stakeholders to discuss human rights
concerns in the shrimp supply chain. Target also requires that sup-
pliers uphold a legally binding agreement to trace seafood back
to the source vessel or farm, and the retailer consults blacklists
to identify potential IUU fishing in its supply chain. Unfortunately,
Target has repeatedly refused to support protections for the
Bering Sea Canyons. This troubling behavior is inconsistent for a
company that has banned farmed salmon and is leading in many
other areas. Greenpeace implores Target to join the other top five
retailers that have all called on the NPFMC to protect these vital
canyons. Target has a big year ahead, but only if it maintains its
momentum.

Labeling and Transparency: This is Target’s worst category,
though signs point to positive changes in the future. Target
improved this year due to signage on freezer cases in select
stores and by providing gear type and sustainability messaging
on its new pole and line caught Simply Balanced canned tuna
products. Target is finally getting creative with its “clean-store”
policy of minimal signage by putting decals on freezer doors to
communicate about sustainable seafood. These labels encourage
customers to look for “Responsibly Sourced Seafood”, indicated
by MSC or BAP labels on packages. Other retailers take note:
Target added key sustainability information on the top of its Simply
Balanced canned tuna products, making it easier for customers
to understand why it is a better choice than destructive brands.
Target must continue this progress, putting informative labels in all
stores with seafood freezers to offer customers information about
sustainable seafood. The retailer must make a more user-friendly
website that clearly shares its policies, updates on its sustainability
goals, and gives customers information to make informed choices.
The retailer could look to every other top five retailer for inspiration,
especially Hy-Vee’s Seafoodies website.

Red List Seafood Sales: Target continued its upward movement
in this category by discontinuing swordfish, and it may offer more
sustainable yellowfin tuna in the future. Target joined the ranks of
ALDI and Trader Joe’s as one of the retailers selling the fewest
Red List species.

Target sells seven of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic sea scallop, ocean quahog, South Atlantic
albacore tuna, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna. It is one of the
few retailers that does not sell farmed salmon.

Headquarters: Batavia, IL

Stores and Banners: 1,375 stores operating as ALDI

Background: The ALDI chain of supermarkets began in Germany
and today operates throughout much of Europe and the U.S.
ALDI U.S. operates throughout the Midwest and Appalachia, and
recently acquired 66 Bottom Dollar Food Stores from Delhaize.
Prior to this purchase, ALDI’s FY 2014 revenue was $10.1 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Following remarkable progress last
year, ALDI slowed quite a bit and showed modest improvement.
ALDI surpassed rival Trader Joe’s to take sixth place. The retailer
made progress in customer communications and aquaculture
standards; however, it needs to develop a sustainable tuna policy
to see a bump in its ranking and to join the top five retailers. As
ALDI expands in the U.S., it is becoming an increasingly important
stakeholder with correspondingly greater responsibility. ALDI
must engage more publicly to address human rights abuses in the
seafood industry and advocate for reforms across the industry to
improve sustainability.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: ALDI’s fresh, frozen, and shelf-
stable seafood policy is available online. Most of its farmed
seafood is BAP 2-star certified, and it holds suppliers to these
standards. The buying team closely monitors its inventory and if
suppliers are unwilling to meet ALDI’s policy requirements, the
team discontinues that product. ALDI has a public commitment
to not source GMO seafood if it comes onto the market and other
retailers should follow this leadership. ALDI needs to develop a
strong canned tuna policy and offer private label canned tuna that
is more sustainable and socially responsible.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: ALDI continues to work
closely with Sustainable Fishery Partnership (SFP) and communi-
cate with MSC and GAA regarding current policies and areas for
improvement, but this is the retailer’s weakest category. Green-
peace commends ALDI for its commitment and proven ability to
hold suppliers accountable to its policies. However, ALDI needs
to go much further. The retailer was among several companies
connected to slavery in the shrimp supply chain in The Guardian
article last year.60 ALDI should only buy seafood that is traceable
back to the vessel or farm, consult Greenpeace’s Blacklist, and
refuse to purchase seafood that was transshipped at sea. ALDI
has not seized opportunities to support passage of congressional
legislation targeting IUU fishing or to advocate for protection of
sensitive habits like the Bering Sea Canyons. ALDI could join other
supportive Midwestern companies like Hy-Vee, SUPERVALU,
and Roundy’s that publicly called on the NPFMC to protect the
canyons. Hopefully this is the year ALDI will enter the advocacy
world in a more public way.

Labeling and Transparency: ALDI takes transparency seriously
by sharing its policy online, sending newsletters to customers, and
sometimes featuring sustainable seafood on its homepage. ALDI
leads U.S. retailers when it comes to providing information on its
own brand seafood product labels, including scientific name, FAO
catch area, detailed fishing method and gear type for wild-caught,
as well as relevant certification labels (e.g., MSC, BAP). ALDI
should consider additional signage or brochures that clearly help
customers make informed decisions, similar to Whole Foods,
Wegmans, and Hy-Vee. Additionally, the retailer could improve its
website by featuring more information and engaging customers
with a blog.

Red List Seafood Sales: This is ALDI’s strongest category. The
retailer is tied with Target and second only to Trader Joe’s in selling
the fewest Red List species out of any retailer in this report.

ALDI sells seven of the 22 Red List species: Alaska Pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, ocean quahog,
South Atlantic albacore tuna, and tropical shrimp. Its farmed
salmon and shrimp is BAP 2-star certified, and it is involved in a
FIP to improve the fishmeal sector.

Headquarters: Monrovia, CA

Stores and Banners: 459 stores operating as Trader Joe’s

Background: Trader Joe’s operates over 450 stores across the
country. The company buys directly from producers and offers
many grocery products under its own private label. Its annual
sales for FY 2014 were $13 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Trader Joe’s lost ground this year. It
dropped out of the good category and was overtaken by three
companies, including rival retailer ALDI. While Trader Joe’s still
leads the sector with the fewest Red List species sold, it has
not delivered on promises made in 2013 regarding public com-
munication about sustainable seafood. Additionally, the retailer
needs to be more transparent with its specific systems, supplier
requirements, and overall sustainable seafood policy. Trader Joe’s
has come a long way over the years, though it must continue its
efforts in a proactive, transparent way to move back into the top
five ranked retailers.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: The retailer’s policy covers fresh,
frozen, and shelf-stable seafood. Last year, we reported on the
company’s leadership on canned tuna, selling pole and line caught
skipjack and albacore without the use of conventional, destructive
longlines. Trader Joe’s is the only retailer that has attempted to of-
fer a fully sustainable spread of canned tuna, which is commend-
able. However, the retailer needs to strengthen its shelf-stable
policy by releasing its standards publicly, with a particular focus on
eliminating human rights abuses in the supply chain, only sourcing
from healthy tuna stocks, and ensuring chain of custody through
third party audits. Trader Joe’s has made progress on aquaculture,
though it needs to strengthen these policies by developing strong
internal standards and by including third party certifications where
relevant.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Trader Joe’s dropped in this
category due to both a lack of clarity and transparency in its sup-
ply requirements. While it has requirements suppliers must agree
to, Greenpeace is unclear about the systems used to track sup-
pliers and how Trader Joe’s ensures traceability to the vessel or
farm harvesting the seafood, and is concerned that the company
relies solely on certification schemes instead of independent third
party audits of its supply chain. Trader Joe’s has demonstrated
leadership by dropping Red List species, introducing sustainable
tuna options under its private label, and supporting protection of
the Bering Sea Canyons; however, the company also needs to
work toward solutions on IUU fishing and strengthen its policies to
prevent potential human rights abuses and unsustainable fishing in
its supply chain.

Labeling and Transparency: This continues to be Trader Joe’s
weakest category, and nearly two years after its 2013 announce-
ment to customers,61 the company has failed to deliver on its com-
mitment to offer substantial updates online or in stores conveying
its policies and commitments to sustainable seafood. Trader Joe’s
does not offer much information in store to help inform customers
at the point of sale. This is a missed opportunity, especially since
the retailer has a highly vertically integrated supply chain. Trader
Joe’s should be able to more easily provide additional information
to customers about all of its seafood products given that it has
proven it can do so with its user-friendly labels on its canned tuna.

Red List Seafood Sales: Trader Joe’s leads among retailers for
selling the fewest Red List species, though this year we are factor-
ing in its canned yellowfin tuna sales. To its credit, Trader Joe’s
only sources highly selective pole and line caught yellowfin tuna.

Trader Joe’s sells six of the 22 Red List species: Alaska
pollock, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Headquarters: Carlisle, Pennsylvania and Quincy, Massachu-

Stores and Banners: 766 stores operating as Stop & Shop,
Giant Foods, Martin’s, and Peapod

Background: Ahold USA is a subsidiary of a Dutch retailer (Royal
Ahold) based in Amsterdam, and accounts for about 60% of the
parent company’s total sales. Ahold USA supports four regional
divisions that together operate 766 stores in several states and
the District of Columbia, along with Peapod, an online grocery
shopping/delivery service. With approximately $29.5 billion in FY
2014 sales, Ahold USA is the seventh largest food retailer in the
United States.

Greenpeace Comments: Ahold made small improvements this
year, though could move closer toward the top five retailers by
strengthening its wild, farmed, and shelf-stable policies, increasing
information on product labels, and discontinuing top-tier Red List
species like Chilean sea bass. Greenpeace commends Ahold for
sourcing a large percentage of its private label skipjack and alba-
core from more responsible catch methods and urges the retailer
to convert its total volume of private label canned tuna to sustain-
ably caught sources, and indicate this on its labels. Ahold must
strengthen its supply chain, invest heavily in traceability, and work
with stakeholders to address human rights abuses in the seafood
industry. There are many possibilities for Ahold to advance this
year if the retailer is ready to double down on its efforts.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Ahold’s policy covers fresh,
frozen, and shelf-stable seafood, though its canned tuna category
contains numerous unsustainable options. While Ahold seeks
to strengthen its supply chain by using third party certifications
like MSC and BAP, Greenpeace encourages the retailer to look
beyond certifications as an accurate measure of sustainability,
given that no single certification scheme is complete and each one
has unresolved problems (see pg. 14). For example, while Ahold’s
goal is to achieve 100% MSC certified canned tuna, it is important
for the retailer to ensure that its canned tuna is ocean safe. Ahold
must also develop a public-facing policy against GMO seafood.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Greenpeace commends
Ahold for its leadership and openness to recommendations from
the NGO community. In recent years, Ahold has shown strong
leadership by sending letters in support of safeguarding Bristol
Bay from the Pebble Mine and protecting the Bering Sea Canyons.
The retailer will have another opportunity to weigh in on the
canyons during the upcoming October 2015 NPFMC meeting.
Ahold called on Congress to pass the IUU Fishing Enforcement
Act of 2015 and now this same spirit must be applied to Ahold’s
strategy for ensuring its supply is not implicated in human rights
abuses. The retailer must refuse to buy seafood that is not
traceable, use tools like Greenpeace’s Blacklist to track problem
vessels and operators, and work with government, NGOs, and
industry to develop solutions to this crisis. Ahold participates in
retailer panels at meetings like the 2015 SeaWeb Seafood Summit
and we encourage the retailer to use these forums to advocate for
and work with stakeholders to address human rights abuses and
IUU fishing.

Labeling and Transparency: Ahold continues its tradition of
promoting sustainable seafood to its customers online, in weekly
circulars, and in-store signage. Customers can find brochures
in stores encouraging them to be ocean-friendly and look for
Sustainable Choice seafood logos. Any products that meet MSC/
ASC (Aquaculture Stewardship Council) standards, or a minimum
BAP 2-star rating, have this logo. Unfortunately, in-store visits this
year found few Sustainable Choice labeled seafood products, and
little sustainability information on product labels. While Ahold has
extensive systems to track this data, Greenpeace urges the retailer
to include this information online and on labels so that customers
can make informed decisions at the point of sale.

Red List Seafood Sales: Ahold improved this year due to
additional sourcing information and FIPs. However, the retailer
must discontinue Chilean sea bass and monkfish if it wants to truly
convey its sustainability commitment to customers.

Ahold sells 12 of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, Chilean sea
bass, monkfish, ocean quahog, redfish (a.k.a. ocean perch), South
Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin
tuna. Ahold sells BAP 2-star certified shrimp and sources from
FIPs for Indonesian snapper, yellowfin tuna, and a small percent-
age for swordfish.

Stores and Banners: 1,361 stores operating as Food Lion and
Hannaford

Background: Delhaize America is owned by Belgian food retailer
Delhaize Group, and makes up over half of the parent company’s
sales. In early 2014, Delhaize America sold 165 branches of its
Sweetbay, Harveys, and Reid’s banners to Southeastern Grocers.
Earlier this year, it finalized the sale of its Bottom Dollar Food
stores (estimated at $718 million) to ALDI. Its FY 2014 sales were
$18.4 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Delhaize moved up to ninth in this
year’s rankings, though its score decreased slightly. Last year, it
was second only to Meijer as the most improved retailer, though
just like Meijer this year, Delhaize is not moving with the same
momentum. The retailer can propel further into the top ten by
developing a sustainable canned tuna policy, converting its private
label tuna to more sustainable products, increasing labeling at
the point of sale, and addressing its Red List. The retailer must
prioritize compliance with its sustainable seafood policy across
its entire range of stores. Delhaize has led initiatives on the Jonah
Crab fishery and now it is time for the retailer to weigh in on issues
like the Bering Sea Canyons and IUU fishing. Delhaize cannot
delay on these initiatives this year.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Delhaize’s seafood policy applies
to its fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable categories. The retailer has
ample information on sustainable tuna alternatives to its current
products, though it has yet to introduce sustainable canned tuna
under its private label. Delhaize is one of the few top ten ranked
retailers without sustainable private label canned tuna on its
shelves, and it is long overdue for this retailer to make the changes
needed to protect tuna stocks, food security, and human rights.
The retailer saw slight improvements in its wild-caught policy
and continues to source 100% of its farmed seafood from BAP
certified processors. Delhaize should stop revisiting whether to
ban genetically modified salmon every year, and instead create
a public-facing policy prohibiting the sale of any GMO seafood
should it become available.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Delhaize takes traceability
seriously, continuing to use third parties to conduct random audits
on whether suppliers conform to the company’s policy require-
ments. Delhaize must prioritize work in this area, which includes
refusing to buy untraceable seafood or seafood transshipped
at sea, and consulting Greenpeace’s Blacklist. Delhaize should
actively engage in the policy arena and participate in industry-led
initiatives to confront IUU fishing and human rights abuses. As a
top ten retailer, Delhaize is in new waters and must add its voice to
these important conversations.

Labeling and Transparency: Greenpeace commends Delhaize
on updating its Food Lion and Hannaford websites to inform
customers of its sustainability policies and initiatives. Store visits
found well-placed signage touting the updated website and QR
(quick response) codes for more information. The company also
tells its “sustainable seafood story” on the back of some of its own
brand products. However, for three years and counting, the retailer
has stalled on ways to effectively communicate more specific
information to customers at the point of sale. Delhaize would
greatly improve in this area by including information such as catch
methods, stock from which seafood was caught, scientific names,
and aquaculture production methods, along with defining what
sustainable seafood means in its signage.

Red List Seafood Sales: Delhaize moved in the right direction
by dropping bigeye tuna, though it canceled out its progress by
reintroducing monkfish after having discontinued the species the
previous year. While over half of its monkfish is caught using less
destructive gillnets, Greenpeace encourages Delhaize to prioritize
consistency in this category by reducing its Red List sales and
holding all of its seafood team buyers accountable to the com-
pany’s sustainability standards.

Delhaize America sells 12 of the 22 Red List species:
Atlantic halibut, Alaska Pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallop, ocean quahog, monkfish, redfish (a.k.a.
ocean perch), South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna. Delhaize’s FIP participation mitigated
its score for yellowfin tuna.

Headquarters: Grand Rapids, Michigan

Stores and banners: 213 stores operating as Meijer

Background: Meijer began as a small grocery shop in 1934 and
has now expanded to over 200 stores, primarily in the Midwest.
Forbes ranked Meijer as America’s nineteenth largest private
company in 2014. Its sales for FY 2014 were $15.7 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Meijer has slowed its pace following
last year’s performance as most improved retailer, mainly due to
a lack of progress on sustainable tuna sourcing and its Red List
sales. The retailer made gains in some important areas by adding
scientific name and MSC/BAP certification to all of its private
label products. Meijer is working on updates to its website and
considering ways to best communicate seafood sustainability
to its customers. Greenpeace encourages Meijer to increase
transparency on these initiatives and take leadership by develop-
ing a sustainable canned tuna policy, advocating for Bering
Sea Canyons protection, and supporting important initiatives to
confront IUU fishing and human rights abuses in the seafood
industry, starting with its own supply chain.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Meijer’s sustainable seafood policy
covers most of its fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable seafood; however,
the retailer needs to strengthen these policies so that they cover
all seafood products sold. To remain in the top ten, Meijer must
also strengthen its sustainable canned tuna policy and convert
its private label products to ocean safe tuna. Meijer continues
to source all of its private label wild-caught seafood from MSC
certified fisheries and all of its private label farmed seafood from
minimum BAP 2-star certified suppliers. While eco-certification
groups can provide initial guidance, Greenpeace cautions Meijer
in relying too heavily on certification groups, given that numerous
problems still exist with certifiers (see pg. 14). Meijer should create
its own precautionary and protective standards that are indepen-
dent to those of the certifiers. The retailer has an internal policy
refusing to sell GMO seafood, though needs to take the next step
and share this policy publicly with its customers.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Meijer met with suppliers
this year in Vietnam and Indonesia to observe operations for
farmed shrimp and pangasius, attended the Global Aquaculture
Alliance’s Global Outlook on Aquaculture Leadership (GAA GOAL)
conference, continued to support the “improver” Best Aquaculture
Practices (iBAP) program, and directed its lead seafood buyer
to join the FMI Sustainable Seafood Committee. Meijer should
continue this momentum and support marine protected areas by
taking a stand to protect the Bering Sea Canyons. Meijer missed
an opportunity to join a growing number of retailers supporting
IUU fishing enforcement legislation. Greenpeace urges the retailer
to prioritize this issue and strengthen its supply chain by refusing
to buy seafood that is not traceable back to the vessel or farm,
and to consult Greenpeace’s Blacklist as first steps to address
both illegally-procured seafood and human rights abuses in the
seafood industry.

Labeling and Transparency: This continues to be Meijer’s
weakest category, although this year the retailer took important
steps by ensuring that scientific names and MSC or BAP labels
are on all Meijer brand products. We expect Meijer to roll out
much needed updates to website, as its current version inad-
equately informs customers about its sustainable seafood and
social compliance policies. This is an opportunity for the retailer
to educate its customers to make informed decisions and more
publicly demonstrate its commitment to pre-existing initiatives like
its refusal to source GMO seafood. In addition to sharing public
updates on its initiatives, Meijer can continue momentum by
increasing point-of-sale sustainability information (beyond merely
an MSC or BAP label), and including fishing method and gear
type—or aquaculture method—used.

Red List Seafood Sales: This year Meijer went the wrong
way on its Red List, reintroducing monkfish; however, because
its monkfish is caught by gillnets—a lesser impact than highly
destructive bottom trawling—it did not lose points.

Meijer sells 11 of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, bigeye tuna,
ocean quahog, redfish (a.k.a. ocean perch), South Atlantic alba-
core tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna. Meijer
is engaged in FIPs for bigeye tuna, redfish, wild caught tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna. Greenpeace could not give credit due
to lack of information on the yellowfin tuna FIP and advises Meijer
to reconsider the redfish FIP, which received a poor rating by its
NGO partner due to a lack of progress.

placing it 35th on Forbes Magazine’s list of the top U.S. private
companies based on annual revenue. It has a strong presence in
Ohio and Pennsylvania, and a smaller presence in West Virginia
and Maryland.

Greenpeace Comments: Giant Eagle swept past major retailers
Costco, H-E-B, and Walmart, reaching eleventh place this year
in an impressive upward move. This Pittsburgh-based retailer is
seizing opportunities thanks to strong internal leadership and a
commitment to offering more sustainable, socially responsible
seafood. The company rolled out a sustainable canned tuna
sourcing policy that focuses on gear type and targeting IUU fishing
operations. Giant Eagle stepped up its advocacy this year, calling
for Bering Sea Canyons protection, asking Congress to approve
IUU fishing enforcement legislation, and joining others expressing
concerns about the Pebble Mine project. The company can
continue its momentum and break into the top ten by introducing
private label ocean safe canned tuna, increasing sustainability
information at the point of sale for its customers, and dropping the
sale of Red List species like orange roughy, Chilean sea bass, and
Atlantic Halibut.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Giant Eagle’s sustainable seafood
policy applies to all of its fresh and frozen seafood. This year, the
retailer introduced a canned tuna policy that greatly improves
its supplier requirements. Greenpeace encourages Giant Eagle
to strengthen its policy on longlines and convert its private label
canned tuna products to FAD-free or pole and line sources. Giant
Eagle is building on its work we reported last year by requiring
BAP certification for some of its salmon, shrimp, and tilapia from
certified farms, working to achieve minimum BAP 2-star certifica-
tion on all farmed shrimp, and moving toward BAP 4-star certified
farmed salmon. Giant Eagle should include specific language in its
policy to never sell GMO seafood and share this with the public.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: This is the retailer’s
strongest category. Giant Eagle added its voice at critical mo-
ments—sending letters calling for protection of Bristol Bay and
the protection of the Bering Sea Canyons, and most recently,
asking Congress to pass the IUU Fishing Enforcement Act of
2015. Greenpeace commends Giant Eagle on these efforts and
encourages the retailer to continue weighing in as an important
stakeholder in these conversations. There is another opportunity
for leadership on the Bering Sea Canyons as the October NPFMC
meeting approaches. Giant Eagle partners with SFP, is a member
of FMI’s Sustainability Task Force and Sustainable Seafood
Working Group, and is an active participant at conferences like
the SeaWeb Seafood Summit. Giant Eagle’s contracts require
suppliers to deliver seafood according to its policy, including an-
nual monitoring reports by external parties to ensure compliance.
The retailer should consult Greenpeace’s Blacklist and refuse to
purchase seafood transshipped at sea.

Labeling and Transparency: Giant Eagle communicates to
customers via weekly flyers, in-store signage, and online. Last
year, the retailer added a decal at all full service seafood counters
sharing its commitment to sustainable seafood. Greenpeace
encourages Giant Eagle to expand its point-of-sale communica-
tion to include sustainability information directly on labels, such as
detailed fishing method and gear type for wild caught, sustainabil-
ity status, scientific name, or farm in which seafood was cultivated.
While the retailer offers this information on occasion, it must make
it more permanent so that its customers can make informed
choices. Fortunately, Giant Eagle is investing in a strategic plan to
roll out updates to its website.

Red List Seafood Sales: This is Giant Eagle’s worst category.
While it improved in this category due to changes in sourcing, Gi-
ant Eagle must immediately discontinue the sale of orange roughy,
Chilean sea bass, and Atlantic halibut.

Giant Eagle sells 14 of the 22 Red List species include:
Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic halibut, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallop, Chilean sea bass, monkfish, orange roughy,
red snapper, redfish (a.k.a. ocean perch), South Atlantic albacore
tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna. The retailer
sources red snapper, wild U.S. shrimp, and yellowfin tuna from
FIPs.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Walmart’s score dropped
in this category. The retailer missed key opportunities to weigh
in on IUU fishing legislation, and despite increased global media
coverage of slavery in the fishing industry, the retailer remains
silent on its plans to tackle this serious problem in its own supply
chain. Walmart must make significant changes in its policies,
including refusing to purchase seafood that is not traceable from
vessel or farm to shelf, refusing to purchase seafood transshipped
at sea, and consulting Greenpeace’s Blacklist. Unfortunately,
Walmart missed the opportunity to weigh in on protections for the
Bering Sea Canyons. However, there is still time for the retailer
to add its voice to this important conversation leading up to the
October NPFMC meeting. While Walmart participates in some
multi-stakeholder discussions for certification improvements like
GAA and MSC, this is a bare minimum for a company of its size.

Labeling and Transparency: This is Walmart’s worst category.
While some Walmart brand packaging references its commitment
to sourcing sustainable seafood, it provides very little information
to customers at the point of sale or online. Including sustainability
status, detailed fishing or aquaculture method, and gear type are a
few ways this retailer should improve its labeling.

Red List Seafood Sales: Even though Walmart sells fewer
Red List species than some other retailers, its total volume has a
significant impact on our oceans.

Walmart sells nine of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, bigeye tuna,
ocean quahog, South Atlantic albacore tuna, tropical shrimp, and
yellowfin tuna. Walmart sources from FIPs and AIPs, though it did
not provide information on the percentage of seafood products
sourced from each corresponding FIP or AIP.

Red list sales: 9

Headquarters: Bentonville, AR

Stores and banners: 4,987 stores in the U.S., including 3,397
Walmart Supercenters, 431 Neighborhood Markets, and 643
Sam’s Clubs, among other formats.

Background: Walmart has over 4,987 stores in the U.S., and U.S.
sales (excluding Sam’s Club) account for 55% of the company’s
total sales worldwide. It is the largest retailer in North America,
even when only factoring sales of consumables. For FY 2014,
groceries and consumables accounted for approximately $218.7
billion in the U.S. alone.

Greenpeace Comments: Walmart remains ranked twelfth,
though its score decreased this year. As the world’s largest
retailer, Walmart has an opportunity—and responsibility—to
transform the seafood industry. Walmart made waves in May
2013 by offering FAD-free Ocean Naturals brand skipjack tuna on
its shelves, but further progress on tuna has stalled. The retailer
needs to develop a robust canned tuna policy and require that its
Great Value brand tuna is sustainable. Walmart refused to join the
growing chorus of retailers (including Costco) to call for protection
of the Bering Sea Canyons. Walmart was among several major
retailers named in recent news reports concerning slavery in its
supply chain62, 63 and it is imperative that the company act to help
solve this crisis in the global seafood industry. While Walmart
delays on important human rights and sustainability initiatives, it
continues to rake in profits at the expense of human beings and
our oceans. Will this retail giant continue to make excuses or use
its buying power and influence to create change in our waters?

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Walmart’s sustainable seafood
policy covers fresh and frozen seafood. Walmart is missing a
strong and comprehensive canned tuna policy that would set
a higher bar than its current unsustainable sourcing. If other
large retailers like Costco can commit to sourcing FAD-free
skipjack private label products, there is no reason why Walmart
cannot convert its Great Value brand to ocean safe tuna. The
retailer’s wild-caught policy is still weak, and it is failing to meet
full compliance with even a modest BAP 2-star requirement for
farmed products. Walmart could vastly improve in this category
by strengthening its fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable policies and
Greenpeace expects swift action in the remainder of 2015.

Headquarters: San Antonio, TX

Stores and Banners: Approximately 313 stores in the U.S.
operating as H-E-B, H-E-B plus!, Central Market, Joe V’s Smart
Shop, and the Market at Stone Oak.

Background: H-E-B is a privately held San Antonio-based
supermarket chain with a large presence throughout Texas, along
with an additional 50 stores in Mexico (not taken into account for
this report). H-E-B ranked 15th on Forbes’s 2014 list of “America’s
Largest Private Companies.” Its FY 2014 sales (in the U.S.) were
$20.9 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: While H-E-B appears to be continuing
its work on sustainable seafood, for some reason, this year the
retailer declined to complete the retailer survey. Greenpeace
attempted to contact H-E-B for several months, then received an
email referencing H-E-B’s website as a way to learn more about
its sustainable seafood policies. Despite its efforts on sustainable
seafood, this retailer’s score dropped because we could not
confirm key information regarding its policies, initiatives, and Red
List sales. Perhaps through its partnership with Environmental
Defense Fund (EDF), H-E-B will improve its transparency and
participate in next year’s survey.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: H-E-B’s seafood policy, available
on its website, demonstrates that its strength is in the area of
aquaculture. H-E-B claimed in last year’s survey that its policy cov-
ers shelf-stable products; however, the company continues to sell
unsustainable items in the forms of processed clam chowders and
canned tuna. Without additional information, the retailer lost points
in this section. H-E-B must strengthen its tuna policy and offer
more responsibly caught canned tuna products. The three biggest
tuna brands are no longer a safe bet for any retailer committed
to sustainable seafood and H-E-B must introduce private label,
ocean safe canned tuna. Greenpeace commends H-E-B for its
firm stance on refusing to sell GMO salmon, although the retailer
needs to expand this public commitment to not sell GMO seafood
should it become available.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: H-E-B refuses to purchase
seafood that cannot be traced back to the vessel that caught it,
and it has annual monitoring procedures in place (conducted by
an external third party, Trace Register) to ensure that its suppliers
conform to its policy requirements. H-E-B should become more
active in the policy arena and add its voice to protect important
habitats like the Bering Sea Canyons. The retailer must join efforts
to stop human rights abuses and IUU fishing in the seafood indus-
try, consult Greenpeace’s Blacklist, refuse to purchase seafood
transshipped at sea, and call on governments to take action.

Labeling and Transparency: H-E-B now lists its seafood policy
in English and Spanish online. Greenpeace encourages H-E-B
to continue developing materials in Spanish so that Spanish-
speaking customers can receive sustainable seafood information.
H-E-B made helpful updates to its website this year, including a
document that presumably lists all the seafood species it sells,
including scientific name, country of origin, and sustainability
information (e.g., EDF ratings, other certification schemes). H-E-B
must improve its poor point-of-sale information. Store visits did not
find any sustainability product labels, brochures, or signage.

Red List Seafood Sales: Despite its new partnership with EDF,
H-E-B still sells Chilean sea bass and bigeye tuna, which do not
belong in any grocery store. The retailer lost points in this category
due to lack of sourcing information for specific species.

H-E-B sells 13 of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, bigeye tuna,
Chilean sea bass, grouper, ocean quahog, red snapper, South
Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin
tuna.

Headquarters: Schenectady, New York

Stores and banners: 135 stores operating as Price Chopper

Background: Price Chopper is a privately held corporation run
by the Golub Corporation and Golub family. The chain’s footprint
extends beyond New York and Massachusetts into Vermont,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire. Over half of the
company’s privately held stock is employee-owned. Its FY 2014
sales were $3.6 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Price Chopper’s score dropped
this year, though the retailer moved up in the rankings because
Harris Teeter is now profiled under Kroger. While the company
prides itself on offering fresh seafood and makes efforts to source
sustainably, Price Chopper should strengthen its policies and
benchmark itself against industry leaders in sustainability like
Whole Foods and Wegmans. The retailer is considering tightening
its farmed seafood standards for its private label. Price Chopper
must improve its transparency online and at the point of sale, and
offer sustainable canned tuna if it wants to perform well against its
competition.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: This remains Price Chopper’s
strongest category. All farmed shrimp and salmon is a minimum
BAP 2-star certified, and Price Chopper is looking to offer stronger
standards for its private label farmed products. While it does not
have plans to sell GMO salmon due to its current standards, it
could put consumers at ease by making a public statement to
that effect. Price Chopper has a significant opportunity to improve
its policy by incorporating shelf-stable seafood and tightening its
wild-caught seafood sourcing standards. There are affordable,
sustainable, and socially responsible canned tuna options on the
market—it is just a question of whether Price Chopper is ready to
join a growing movement in the retail sector by offering ocean safe
canned tuna.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Price Chopper continues to
use DNA testing services to randomly test samples from fifteen of
its frozen fish product lines. But given increased reports of slavery
and IUU fishing operations in the global seafood supply chain, it
is imperative that Price Chopper develop and share publicly its
supplier standards on traceability. While third party audits and
certification schemes are helpful, Price Chopper must make clear
with suppliers that unless seafood is traceable back to the vessel
or farm, it will not do business with them. Greenpeace encourages
Price Chopper to add its support for political initiatives, including
work to address IUU fishing and the creation of marine protected
areas in places like the Bering Sea Canyons.

Labeling and Transparency: Price Chopper has limited
transparency, and therefore does not perform as well in this
category. When sending out promotional emails to customers,
Price Chopper provides helpful information on catch method, loca-
tion, boat name, and scientific name. This level of transparency
is helpful for customers to make informed decisions and must be
conveyed at the point of sale and online. Price Chopper should
expand these efforts by informing consumers of the sustainability
status of various species (i.e., green, yellow, red-rated) and catch
or aquaculture method used. If low cost retailers like ALDI can
provide key information on labels, there is no reason why Price
Chopper cannot follow suit to better inform its customers and
bolster its performance in this category.

Red List Seafood Sales: Price Chopper still sells hoki, a top-tier
Red List species. The company must discontinue this item without
delay. This should not be difficult for the retailer, as it discontinued
top-tier orange roughy about three years ago.

Price Chopper sells 12 of the 22 Red List species: Alaska
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, hoki,
ocean quahog, red snapper, redfish (a.k.a. ocean perch), South
Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin
tuna.

Headquarters: Issaquah, WA

Stores and Banners: 469 warehouses in the U.S., operating as
Costco

Background: Costco is the third largest retailer in the U.S., and
the largest membership warehouse club chain in the U.S. While
the chain also has 107 international locations, the scope of this
report encompasses only its U.S.-based stores. Its FY 2014
revenue (for consumables only) was $61.7 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Costco took a bold step in 2014,
introducing FAD-free skipjack tuna under its famed Kirkland
Signature brand and removing its previous supplier, Thai Union-
owned Chicken of the Sea, for failing to offer more sustainable
options. Greenpeace applauds Costco for this significant move;
however, the retail giant needs to also convert its Kirkland Signa-
ture albacore to more sustainable sources and create a sustain-
able tuna sourcing policy. Costco also joined a growing number
of retailers urging the NPFMC to protect the Bering Sea Canyons.
Despite these major moves, Costco’s score remains stagnant
due to a glaring lack of transparency. Most troubling, there is little
indication of what Costco is doing to respond to serious concerns
about slavery in the global seafood industry.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Costco’s sustainable seafood
policy includes fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable products, though it
needs to release a comprehensive canned tuna policy, convert its
private label albacore to more sustainable sources, and address
the unsustainable national brands it sells. Costco is moving in
the right direction by sourcing a more sustainable private label
skipjack product and should continue this leadership. While
Costco may have further developed its aquaculture standards this
past year, Greenpeace did not receive additional information about
them in the retailer survey.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Costco has previously
been involved in the World Wildlife Fund’s (WWF) shrimp and
aquaculture dialogues, though it is unclear if it is still active. Costco
improved in this category by showing leadership on sustainable
canned tuna and advocating for protection of the Bering Sea
Canyons. However, Costco must urgently address human rights
abuses in the supply chain, especially after it was linked to slavery
at sea in last year’s CP Foods exposé in The Guardian.64 A retailer
of its size has a responsibility to continue advocating for our
oceans and Costco must lead by ensuring its supply chain is not
implicated in human rights abuses or IUU fishing. Costco can
start by consulting Greenpeace’s Blacklist, refusing to purchase
seafood transshipped at sea, and joining other retailers to call for
government action.

Labeling and Transparency: This is Costco’s worst category. In
fact, eighteen retailers (over 70% of those featured in this report)
score better than Costco in this category. Costco has some
serious work to do here, especially regarding its transparency.
Nationwide store visits did not confirm scientific names on some
labels, as was the case last year, though some stores had labels
on Atlantic salmon that indicated it was farmed without the use of
antibiotics. While Costco prominently promotes its organic chicken
and natural beef with large signage, there was no information for
customers about sustainable seafood. The retailer moved in the
right direction by featuring its Kirkland Signature brand FAD-free
tuna in the Costco Connections magazine. Costco must build
on that work to increase communication with its customers. It
can start by creating a user-friendly website featuring its policies,
commitments, and how customers can make informed choices.

Red List Seafood Sales: Costco is going the wrong way in this
category, which is a big deal because the retailer sells massive
amounts of seafood every week. Even though it sells fewer Red
List species than some other retailers, its total volume has a
significant impact on our oceans. Additionally, due to lack of
transparency, it lost mitigated points for its shrimp and salmon
products.

Costco sells nine of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, bigeye tuna,
ocean quahog, South Atlantic albacore tuna, tropical shrimp, and
yellowfin tuna.

Stores and Banners: SUPERVALU distributes to 3,357 stores,

Shop ‘n Save, Shoppers Food Warehouse, Hornbacher’s), 1,334
Save-A-Lot stores (419 are corporate owned and 915 are licensed
by others), and 1,827 independent stores.

Background: In 2013, SUPERVALU halved its capacity by selling
off Albertsons and several related banners, amounting to 877
stores total, with sales of approximately $17.4 billion. Nonetheless,
it brought in about $15.9 billion in sales for FY 2013, and grew over
the past year, posting FY 2014 sales of $17.7 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Last year, we were uncertain how SU-
PERVALU would perform based on industry press reports that it
was returning to its “wholesaler” focus. Amid a transition time, the
company is meeting some sustainability goals and falling behind
on others, resulting in a modest score improvement this year. The
company is working toward a goal of sourcing top wild-caught
species from MSC certified fisheries or FIPs. Greenpeace cautions
SUPERVALU on this approach given unresolved concerns with
the MSC (see pg. 14). The retailer must exercise independent
judgment and develop stronger sourcing policies rather than
solely relying on third party certifications to consider its seafood
sourcing “sustainable.” SUPERVALU must increase its aquaculture
requirements and develop a strong sustainable tuna policy. These
improvements would propel SUPERVALU higher in the rankings.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: SUPERVALU plans to meet its
wild-caught sustainable seafood goals by the end of 2015. While
the company has some BAP certification requirements, it has
not met its 2013 goal of ensuring most products are BAP 2-star
certified. A formal partnership with GAA to develop stronger
aquaculture policies is a good first step, though it is critical that
SUPERVALU set a timeline for this work. Greenpeace is still
waiting for the company to publicly declare that it will not source
GMO seafood, and recommends that it release the policy this
year. SUPERVALU must develop a sustainable tuna policy that
goes beyond its wild-caught MSC certification goals, as this
standard alone is inadequate. Its Midwest neighbor, Iowa-based
Hy-Vee, has already shown how to lead in private label sustainable
tuna sourcing. Finally, the retailer must create strong standards on
traceability back to vessel or farm to ensure a strong supply chain
amid growing concerns of human rights abuses in the fishing
industry.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Last year, we highlighted
SUPERVALU’s leadership by calling on the NPFMC to protect the
Bering Sea Canyons. This year, SUPERVALU sent a letter to the
Vietnamese government regarding pangasius AIPs, and sent let-
ters to suppliers advocating for stronger product certifications. The
company is committed to buying only private label products with
strong chain of custody and works with its NGO partner to audit
its supply chain. Given rampant human rights abuses in the supply
chain, it is imperative that SUPERVALU strengthen its sourcing
policies, traceability protocols, and consult tools like Greenpeace’s
Blacklist to confront IUU fishing.

Labeling and Transparency: This is SUPERVALU’s weakest
category. Labeling is sparse, though occasionally the retailer indi-
cates whether it is selling MSC, GAA, or ASC certified products.
SUPERVALU could dramatically improve in this area by including
sustainability status, catch or aquaculture method, scientific name,
and catch vessel. After missing its February 2014 deadline, the
company is working to introduce in-store flyers this year, which
would greatly help customers identify sustainable products and
learn more about SUPERVALU’s commitment to sustainable
seafood. Lastly, the company must improve its website. This is
an opportunity to communicate with customers about its sustain-
ability goals as the retailer is currently missing the mark.

Red List Seafood Sales: SUPERVALU did not add any Red List
species this year and improved slightly due to modestly mitigated
sourcing measures. While reassuring, if the company were truly
committed to sustainable seafood it would discontinue Atlantic
halibut and Chilean sea bass immediately.

SUPERVALU sells 14 of the 22 Red List species: Atlantic
halibut, Chilean sea bass, Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic
salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, grouper, ocean quahog, red snapper,
redfish (a.k.a. ocean perch), South Atlantic albacore tuna, sword-
fish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Stores and Banners: 89 stores owned outright under PriceRite
and ShopRite banners, as well as a supplier for hundreds more,
including additional ShopRite stores, Fresh Grocer, Village Super
Market, and Inserra Supermarkets.

Background: Wakefern is the largest supermarket retailers’
cooperative in the U.S., with FY 2014 sales of $14.7 billion. It
primarily supplies its co-op members’ ShopRite stores in the
Northeastern U.S. and owns a handful of the stores outright. Given
the co-op structure of ShopRite, individual stores make their own
purchasing decisions. However, in virtually all cases ShopRite
stores carry seafood that is directly sourced through Wakefern.
PriceRite is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wakefern, with 50 stores
located throughout CT, MA, NY, PA, MD, and RI.

Greenpeace Comments: Wakefern has been busy following
its initial appearance in Carting Away the Oceans last year. The
company is just hundredths of a point behind SUPERVALU and
would have come out ahead this year if it seized an opportunity to
join companies like SUPERVALU by sending a letter to the NPFMC
calling for protection of the Bering Sea Canyons. As it enters its
second full year after strong commitments on sustainable seafood,
we encourage Wakefern to advocate for improvements across
the industry. Since launching its sustainable seafood program
in January 2014, Wakefern has adopted MSC Chain of Custody
certification, requires a minimum BAP 2-star certification for
farmed seafood, and is committed to not selling certain Red List
species due to sustainability reasons. In the year ahead, Wakefern
can double down on its efforts by strengthening existing policies,
offering customers more information at the point of sale, stepping
into the advocacy ring, and markedly reducing its Red List sales.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Wakefern’s policy covers fresh,
frozen, and shelf-stable products; however, store visits at ShopRite
revealed that the canned tuna aisle has not received enough
attention as the bulk of tuna sold comes from unsustainable
sources. Wakefern must supply more sustainable tuna under
its co-op members’ private labels (e.g., ShopRite, PriceRite).
Developing a comprehensive tuna sourcing policy, with options
like vessel-to-shelf traceable pole and line (or FAD-free) skipjack
and albacore, would greatly improve its score next year as well as
its customers’ confidence in the products they purchase. While
Greenpeace does not officially support any certification scheme,
we commend Wakefern for so quickly requiring its farmed seafood
be at least BAP 2-star certified.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Wakefern has requirements
suppliers must fulfill and uses metrics like MSC Chain of Custody,
MSC, and BAP certification to ensure compliance. The company
should join the fight against human rights abuses and IUU fishing
in the seafood industry, and could start by refusing to purchase
seafood transshipped at sea and consulting Greenpeace’s
Blacklist. We encourage Wakefern to continue its prior leadership
in FMI when it signed onto a letter opposing the Pebble Mine.
Moving forward it should join the eleven retailers that sent letters
to the NPFMC and call for adequate measures to protect the
Bering Sea Canyons.

Labeling and Transparency: Wakefern holds MSC Chain
of Custody certification (not to be confused with MSC species
certification) at its seafood processing facility, which is an internal
traceability program that monitors products through the supply
chain. In its newsletter, Wakefern warns about overfishing and
habitat destruction, and it makes commitments to not source
certain Red List species due to sustainability concerns. While
we found large sustainable seafood signs at the seafood counter
in some stores, some stores only had information on a small
laminated piece of paper that many customers may not see.
Wakefern should make its signage prominent and consistent
across stores. The retailer must also develop a user-friendly
website and increase point-of-sale labeling like sustainability status
and detailed fishing or aquaculture method so that customers can
confidently purchase sustainable seafood.

Red List Seafood Sales: Wakefern made an important move
by discontinuing bigeye tuna; however, the company did not see
any improvement in this category as it introduced monkfish. The
company must phase out Atlantic halibut and Chilean sea bass
to remain true to its sustainability goals. While we commend its
public statement to not sell orange roughy, sharks, and bluefin
tuna, Wakefern must go further than saying “until sustainable
sources can be identified” and instead commit to never source
these top-tier Red List species. Wakefern sells far too many Red
List species and must reduce this list significantly.

Wakefern sells 16 of the 22 Red List species: Atlantic halibut,
Chilean sea bass, Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallop, Greenland halibut, ocean quahog, monkfish,
red snapper, redfish (a.k.a. ocean perch), skates and rays, South
Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp and yellowfin
tuna.

Food & Pharmacy, and Pay Less.

Background: Kroger operates 2,638 supermarket and multi-
department stores across the U.S. under a multitude of banners,
and recently acquired all seven of Hiller’s Markets in the Detroit met-
ropolitan area. Kroger is the nation’s largest conventional grocery
retailer. Its FY 2014 supermarket sales were approximately $102.3
billion. In February 2014, Kroger acquired Harris Teeter, which is why
Harris Teeter is no longer profiled separately in this report.

Greenpeace Comments: Kroger’s score dropped this year. The
retailer refused to participate in the report for its ninth consecutive
time. While flashy websites and videos might sway some shop-
pers, Kroger’s failure to respond amid repeated requests from
Greenpeace is troubling and contradicts its claims of transparency
noted in its 2014 CSR report.65 Second only to Walmart in annual
revenue, Kroger is the largest traditional grocery store chain in the
U.S. Given its sheer size and tonnage of seafood sold, Kroger has
an enormous responsibility to source sustainably and responsibly.
Along with Publix, Kroger is the worst performing retailer in the Red
List category, selling 18 of the 22 Red List species. Kroger must
prioritize meaningful action this year—our oceans depend on it.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Kroger’s weak tuna sourcing
requirements and lack of a comprehensive policy are a major
problem preventing the company from sourcing available, price-
comparable tuna products that boast safer methods of capture,
such as FAD-free or pole and line methods. Kroger scored near
the bottom of Greenpeace’s canned tuna ranking. The retailer
cannot rely solely on industry-funded groups like the International
Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) to assure its products are
sustainable, socially responsible, and traceable. Its customers and
our oceans deserve better. Kroger must change its destructive tuna
sourcing practices and create a policy that also addresses slavery
and human rights abuses in the industry. While Kroger publicly
promotes that it is near its goals for a number of MSC certified
products sold, Greenpeace cautions Kroger about relying solely on
this approach. There are significant unresolved concerns with MSC
certified fisheries, and defining sustainability solely by compliance
with third party certification schemes is shortsighted at best (see pg.
14). Kroger must develop strong internal sourcing standards across
fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable products to truly achieve seafood
sustainability.

page 38

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Most of Kroger’s corporate-
branded farmed species are BAP 2-star certified. The company
also has sustainability requirements (outside of its policy) by which
its aquaculture suppliers must abide. While Kroger has several
sustainability partners, including WWF, given the company’s poor
performance, it appears that Kroger may view these partners as
more of an outward symbol of purported progress than as experts
on how to implement genuine improvements to its sustainability
standards and practices. As the second-largest grocery retailer
in the country, Kroger must source sustainable seafood and heed
the call to action to immediately address human rights abuses
in the seafood industry. Kroger needs to emerge as a loud voice
both in the public sphere and behind the scenes to clean up
global seafood supply chains.

Labeling and Transparency: The retailer lacks transparency
in its chain of custody, which is troublesome amid significant
concerns about human rights abuses in the seafood industry.
Kroger provides scant information at the point of sale to assist
consumers in making sustainable seafood choices. While Kroger
now offers some information on seafood sustainability on its
website, store visits found only a small brochure and sometimes a
sign with similar messaging. Unfortunately, nothing in its “sustain-
able seafood” brochure helps customers make more informed
choices in the store. Kroger should look to the top ranked retailers
for ways to improve its point-of-sale information.

Red List Seafood Sales: Kroger is tied with Publix as the worst
performer in the Red List category among profiled retailers. The
company continues to empty our oceans, selling highly vulnerable
species, which is contradictory to its CSR statement, that it relies
on science to identify species at risk. While Kroger shares in its
CSR report that it does not source Red List species like sharks,
it continues to sell Atlantic halibut, Chilean sea bass, hoki, and
orange roughy. Kroger must discontinue these sales immediately.

Kroger sells 18 of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic halibut, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop,
Chilean sea bass, Greenland halibut, grouper, hoki, monkfish,
ocean quahog, orange roughy, red snapper, redfish (a.k.a. ocean
perch), South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp,
and yellowfin tuna. Kroger is purportedly engaged in FIPs, though
Greenpeace was not provided any information.

Red list sales: 14

Headquarters: Boise, ID

Stores and Banners: 1,081 stores operating as Albertsons,
Jewel-Osco, Shaw’s/Star Market, Acme, United, Market Street,
and Amigos.

Background: Last year, Albertsons became one of the top ten
U.S. grocery retailers (based on revenue, with FY 2014 sales of
$24.5 billion), and in early 2015 it acquired a larger competitor
– Safeway. When factoring in Safeway’s revenue, Albertsons-
Safeway will have sales of approximately $61.6 billion.66 This would
place the chain as the fourth largest grocery retailer in North
America. For the purposes of this report, Greenpeace is evaluating
Albertsons based on its prior performance as a separate entity
from Safeway.

Greenpeace Comments: While Albertsons is undergoing a ma-
jor transition, it is disappointing and troubling that the retailer has
been unwilling to communicate with Greenpeace since last year.
This is the second year in a row Albertsons did not participate in
the survey process. While Albertsons saw small gains in the policy
category due to offering more sustainable canned tuna options,
it tanked in the Red List category. Albertsons shamefully sells
orange roughy, sharks, and bigeye tuna. Safeway can teach this
emerging giant a lot about sustainable seafood. There is significant
work needed for Albertsons to prioritize sustainable seafood by
developing a strong fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable seafood policy
and cleaning up its supply chain. Albertsons can no longer use its
transition as an excuse to delay action and Greenpeace expects
major changes from this retail giant by next year’s report.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Albertsons’ seafood policy
does not cover shelf-stable products, only fresh and frozen. The
company’s seafood sustainability language posted online is devoid
of tangible commitments. It is unclear whether its wild-caught
or farmed seafood are covered by a comprehensive certification
regime, although some of the company’s products are partially
covered. Albertsons must work with Safeway on canned tuna
and develop a strong sustainable canned tuna policy this year, in
addition to converting its private label to more responsibly caught
products. At least in some locations the retailer sells more sustain-
able alternatives like Ocean Naturals; however, this is simply not
enough for a retailer of its size.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Greenpeace estimates
that Albertsons has a minimal degree of sustainability criteria that
suppliers must follow. Unfortunately, there is no public-facing
information demonstrating that it employs third party audits or
is taking proactive measures to ensure sustainable sourcing.
Albertsons does not support improvements in fisheries manage-
ment in the regulatory or policy arena, though the retailer appears
to occasionally collaborate with groups in other forums. Earlier
this year, Greenpeace publicly called on Albertsons to join a
growing number of major seafood buyers calling for Bering Sea
Canyons protection. The retailer did not seize this opportunity and
it is unknown whether the company will participate in any other
initiatives this year. While Safeway is exploring ways to address
IUU fishing and human rights abuses in the seafood industry, it
remains unclear if Albertsons is ready to take much needed ac-
tion. As a large retailer, Albertsons has a responsibility to advocate
for sustainable, socially responsible seafood and industry-wide
changes.

Labeling and Transparency: There appears to be little
consistency across Albertsons banner stores when it comes to
communicating to consumers about sustainability, both online and
at the point of sale. The retailer’s online presence is severely lack-
ing, as it has only posted a lone sustainable seafood blog entry
in 2014 (though a few of its banner stores have communicated
more to their customers). While in most cases there is little or no
information on site, some store visits revealed a surprising amount
of information for farmed seafood at the seafood counter, including
country where born/hatched, raised, harvested, and processed.
Albertsons needs a comprehensive, consistent strategy for label-
ing and sharing sustainability information with its customers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Albertsons tanked in the Red List cat-
egory this year. In our store visits, we were alarmed to find top-tier
Red List species orange roughy and sharks for sale. Albertsons
must swiftly gain control of its supply chain and immediately
discontinue selling orange roughy, bigeye tuna, and sharks.

Albertsons sells 14 of the 22 Red List species: Alaska
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, bigeye
tuna, grouper, ocean quahog, orange roughy, redfish (a.k.a. ocean
perch), South Atlantic albacore tuna, sharks, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Headquarters: Boise, ID

Stores and Banners: 100 retail stores operating as WinCo

Background: WinCo Foods is a privately-held, majority
employee-owned supermarket chain with stores in AZ, CA, ID, NV,
OR, UT, WA, and TX. WinCo purchases directly from suppliers. Its
FY 2014 sales were $6 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: This marks WinCo’s second year
being profiled in Carting Away the Oceans, and for the second
year in a row WinCo did not complete the survey. While we did
receive limited information from seafood staff, the retailer needs to
fully participate in the survey and more openly share its progress.
Southeastern Grocers and Roundy’s may rank higher next year
if WinCo continues on its current trajectory. Greenpeace advises
WinCo to increase its transparency and begin a productive
dialogue in order to advance its sustainable seafood goals.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: WinCo has an internal sustainable
seafood policy that does not address its canned tuna inventory.
WinCo has an internal policy against selling GMO seafood and is
looking to improve its sourcing of farmed shrimp.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: WinCo’s opportunity lies in
its vertical integration. Given the model of direct purchasing from
suppliers, it has a strong internal chain of custody in the fresh
seafood section. Its canned tuna section, filled with destructive
national brands, is another matter. WinCo does not publicly
participate in any seafood sustainability efforts and did not
communicate to Greenpeace about whether it advocates behind
the scenes for reforms. The company must push for swift action to
confront human rights abuses in the seafood industry.

Labeling and Transparency: For the second year running, this
is WinCo’s weakest category. While WinCo does not have in-store
signage, it has begun to issue in-store flyers related to seafood
sustainability. It must substantially improve its on-package labeling
and needs to better communicate sustainability information to its
customers online. The company plans to release website updates
in the coming months, which will be very helpful to inform custom-
ers about more sustainable choices.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace applauds WinCo for
discontinuing sharks and encourages the retailer to publicly share
this news.

WinCo sells eight of the 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, ocean quahog, ocean perch,
South Atlantic albacore tuna, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Stores and Banners: 802 stores operating as Winn-Dixie, BI-LO,
and Harveys

Background: In May 2015, Bi-Lo Holdings officially changed
its name to Southeastern Grocers. The retailer operates stores
throughout Florida and the Deep South. In 2013, it purchased the
Sweetbay, Reid’s, and Harveys store banners from Delhaize for
$265 million. Last year, it formally converted all Reid’s stores into
BI-LOs, Sweetbay stores into Winn-Dixies, and it kept the Harveys
banner. Its FY 2014 revenue was $11.5 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: A new name is just one of this
retailer’s headlines in 2015. Southeastern Grocers claims the prize
for this year’s most improved retailer by increasing over two points
from last year. Southeastern Grocers’ biggest moves include
completing the Carting Away the Oceans survey for the first time
since this report launched in 2008, committing resources to
develop a sustainable seafood program, and asking the NPFMC
to protect the Bering Sea Canyons. The company is working with
SFP to develop strong policies and no longer sells orange roughy,
sharks, and monkfish for sustainability reasons. For the first time
in seven years, Southeastern Grocers scored higher than Publix
in a move that may up the stakes for its southern rival to get in the
game. While Southeastern Grocers still received a failing score,
Greenpeace commends the retailer for its U-turn and is cautiously
optimistic about some big changes ahead if Southeastern Grocers
maintains this momentum.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Southeastern Grocers does not
currently have a sustainable seafood policy, although it is making
strides toward sourcing more sustainable and socially responsible
products, using MSC and BAP certification schemes. While
encouraging news, retailers must exercise independent judgement
and not rely solely on certifications (see pg. 14). By developing a
fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable policy that incorporates traceability
and addresses human rights concerns, Southeastern Grocers is
well on its way toward a strong sustainability program. The retailer
must prioritize converting its private label canned tuna to further
strengthen its supply chain and offer more sustainable products to
its customers.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Southeastern Grocers has
partnered with SFP, demonstrating the company’s investment
in staff time and resources to prioritize sustainable seafood.
Southeastern Grocers is exploring ways to maintain stronger
oversight of its suppliers and has conveyed its determination to
follow through on its goals. As Southeastern Grocers develops
its program, it intends to participate in key conversations with
industry and NGOs. Greenpeace applauds Southeastern Grocers
for joining a growing number of retailers calling on the NPFMC
to protect the Bering Sea Canyons. Greenpeace encourages
Southeastern Grocers to continue engaging with policy makers to
strengthen standards that protect our oceans and confront human
rights abuses in the industry.

Labeling and Transparency: Southeastern Grocers is
developing programs to educate and inform its customers about
seafood sustainability, both online and at the point of sale. While
Southeastern Grocers has a long way to go, it received credit
this year for in-store signage and customer communications
regarding its BAP 4-star certified Atlantic salmon. The company
can ramp up its efforts by offering more information on labels and
packaging, including sustainability status, catch or aquaculture
method, and traceability back to the vessel or farm. We encour-
age Southeastern Grocers to update the public on its progress
and begin sharing more publicly its commitment to sustainable,
socially responsible seafood.

Red List Seafood Sales: Southeastern Grocers made waves in
this category, increasing nearly 20 points. Greenpeace applauds
Southeastern Grocers for dropping orange roughy, sharks, and
monkfish for sustainability reasons, and encourages the company
to publicly share with its customers why it made this decision.
Southeastern Grocers must drop Atlantic halibut and Chilean sea
bass to remain true to its sustainability goals.

Southeastern Grocers sells 13 of the 22 Red List species:
Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic halibut, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallop, Chilean sea bass, grouper, ocean quahog,
redfish (a.k.a. ocean perch), South Atlantic albacore tuna, sword-
fish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Stores and Banners: 149 stores operating as Pick ‘n Save,

Background: Roundy’s stores are located in Wisconsin and
Illinois. Its FY 2014 sales were $3.9 billion. In early 2014, CEO Bob
Mariano converted 11 Dominick’s stores purchased from Safeway
to their new name: “Mariano’s.” In mid-2014, it sold off its Rainbow
stores (mostly to SUPERVALU) and exited the Minneapolis/St. Paul
area.

Greenpeace Comments: One year after Roundy’s was first
profiled in Carting Away the Oceans, this retailer has doubled
down on its sustainable seafood efforts. Roundy’s is second
only to Southeastern Grocers as the most improved retailer this
year, more than doubling last year’s score. While it still received
a failing score, this is likely a temporary way post. Roundy’s is
currently developing its seafood policy and program, and this
initiative is seeing significant results thanks to strong leadership on
its seafood team. Roundy’s discontinued orange roughy, sharks,
monkfish, and skates, and added its voice for marine protected
areas when CEO Bob Mariano sent a letter to the NPFMC calling
for Bering Sea Canyons protection. The retailer is consulting
NGOs like Monterey Bay Aquarium and is on track for significant
improvement by our next report.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Roundy’s should improve in this
category once it releases a comprehensive policy publicly that
includes fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable products. Rather than wait
for a full-fledged policy, the retailer is already moving forward with
plans to offer more sustainable canned tuna and is demonstrating
leadership by discontinuing several Red List species. Roundy’s
needs to create minimum standards for fresh and farmed seafood.
The retailer must also develop supplier requirements and audit
procedures, train staff and suppliers, implement traceability sys-
tems, and refuse to purchase seafood that cannot be traced back
to vessel or farm. Consulting Greenpeace’s Blacklist and refusing
to purchase seafood transshipped at sea would set Roundy’s on a
strong path forward.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Roundy’s is proactively
consulting stakeholders to support its sustainability goals. Green-
peace applauds Roundy’s for calling on the NPFMC to protect
the Bering Sea Canyons. Roundy’s has an important voice and
much to gain from participating in dialogues across the industry,
including calling for action to address slavery and IUU fishing in the
global seafood industry.

Labeling & Transparency: Roundy’s does not provide in-store
signage or labeling pertaining to sustainable seafood. As it
develops its program, Roundy’s plans to roll out point-of-sale
and online information. The company can greatly improve in this
category by creating a user-friendly online resource that features
its commitments and seafood policy, developing in-store signage
at the point of sale, increasing information on labels, and working
with other groups to publicly promote sustainable seafood.

Red List Seafood Sales: Roundy’s jumped nearly 20 points
in this category thanks to its team’s leadership and newfound
commitment to sustainable seafood. The retailer discontinued four
Red List species because of sustainability reasons: orange roughy,
sharks, monkfish, and skates. As a result of participating in this
year’s survey, Greenpeace also confirmed Roundy’s no longer
sells Atlantic halibut, Greenland halibut, or bigeye tuna. Moving
forward, Roundy’s must follow Hy-Vee’s lead and discontinue
Chilean sea bass.

Roundy’s sells 13 out of the 22 Red List species: Alaska
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, Chilean
sea bass, grouper, ocean quahog, red snapper, redfish (a.k.a.
ocean perch), South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Headquarters: Lakeland, FL

Stores and banners: 1,090 supermarkets operating as Publix

Background: Publix is the largest employee-owned supermarket
chain in the Southern U.S. Its FY 2014 sales were $30.4 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: Publix yet again refused to participate
in the Carting Away the Oceans survey, and will not engage in any
dialogue with Greenpeace despite several requests. Publix failed
again in this report and scored even lower because it did not
inform its customers on whether it plans to create a sustainable
seafood policy, how it works to eliminate IUU seafood in its supply
chain, and how it advocates for industry improvements with
suppliers. Our research could not find any new public communica-
tions about seafood sustainability this year. Publix now ties Kroger
with most Red List sales (18), and sells top-tier Red List species
like orange roughy, sharks, and Chilean sea bass. Publix is the
only top ten (by gross revenue) U.S. retailer to fail this year’s report.
For the first time in seven years, it is ranked lower than its regional
rival Southeastern Grocers. If Publix wants to remain relevant,
2015 must be the year it decides to seriously prioritize sustain-
ability.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Publix lacks a visible sustainable
seafood policy. Although the company claims on its website to
have “developed and begun to implement our seafood sustainabil-
ity program,” there is no evidence as to what the program entails,
how it is being implemented, or how it impacts what seafood is
sold by the company. The unsustainable offerings in its stores
suggest that the company is either unable or unwilling to adopt a
more robust sustainable seafood policy.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: This year, we have no new
evidence of any initiatives. Publix works with SFP to inform its
sustainable seafood practices, but it is unclear as to whether
Publix is integrating SFP’s recommendations into its program, or
this relationship is merely for favorable marketing purposes. As a
top ten U.S. retailer by revenue, Publix has significant responsibility
to confront IUU fishing and human rights abuses throughout the
seafood industry. Greenpeace hopes Publix will act with great
haste to improve its supply chain and advocate for significant,
industry-wide changes.

Labeling and Transparency: Publix has general sustainable
seafood information online, but it does not give consumers
specifics about its sourcing. A Publix Seafood Facts brochure
found in one store provides consumers with information. Its Fish
List brochure is an impressive guide for customers that discloses
what fish Publix sells. However, there are no brochures, point-
of-sale information at the seafood counter, or product labels that
guide customers to make sustainable choices. Publix clearly has
systems to track its sourcing, and now must apply this data to
include point-of-sale sustainability information.

Red List Seafood Sales: Publix joins the likes of Kroger and
Wakefern by selling a large number of Red List species. This year
Publix is tied with Kroger, selling the most Red List species of any
retailer in this report. Publix hides behind an outdated philosophy
that looks to continue selling problematic species with goals to
improve those fisheries, rather than outright refusing to sell the
species that are severely overfished or harvested in destructive
ways. Populations of our ocean’s top predators like sharks, tuna,
and swordfish have dropped by as much as 90% over the last
half-century, and Publix sells all three of these species. It must
discontinue Chilean sea bass, orange roughy, and sharks immedi-
ately, and markedly reduce its Red List sales if it wants to seriously
tout any sustainability claims with its customers.

Publix sells 18 out of 22 Red List species: Alaska pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, Chilean sea
bass, Greenland halibut, grouper, ocean quahog, redfish (a.k.a.
ocean perch), orange roughy, monkfish, red snapper, skates,
sharks, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp,
and yellowfin tuna. The company may source some species from
FIPs, but since it refuses to complete the survey, there is no way to
verify this information.

Background: Founded in 1859, A&P mainly operates in the
mid-Atlantic and southern New England. Its FY 2014 sales dipped
slightly from last year, and hover around $5.8 billion.

Greenpeace Comments: A&P’s score plummeted, losing
nearly 3.5 points and dropping from last year’s spot at seventeen.
Significant restructuring at the company has stalled its work on
sustainable seafood initiatives and its dialogue with Greenpeace.
A&P did not participate in this year’s survey. It is unclear what A&P
intends to do in order to overhaul its seafood program, improve
traceability, address IUU fishing, and create a robust sustainable
seafood policy. A&P must act quickly or this retailer will continue
its landslide in this report.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: A&P created a seafood mission
statement in 2012, which served as an internal guide for its
sustainable seafood program. Unfortunately, its current practices
suggest that A&P no longer uses this document. The retailer must
create a strong, traceable, binding seafood policy for fresh, frozen,
and shelf-stable products. This policy should include supplier
requirements, training and monitoring of A&P seafood buyer’s
purchasing practices, and increasing transparency and education
for staff and its customers. A&P needs to evaluate its supply chain
and immediately address any problem areas at greatest risk of IUU
fishing or labor abuse. Greenpeace implores A&P to focus on IUU
fishing, given egregious human rights abuses in the global seafood
industry.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: While there may be some
initiatives that continued amid internal restructuring, we cannot
report with confidence on those practices. A&P should publicly
recommit to consult the Greenpeace Blacklist and join dialogues
with industry, government, and NGOs on seafood sustainability
and human rights abuses in the supply chain. These steps will
help A&P offer more sustainable, socially responsible seafood
products. A&P should also recommit to not source the 19 species
listed in its seafood mission statement and advocate for marine
protected areas, including protection of the Bering Sea Canyons.

Labeling and Transparency: A&P’s score in this category is
terrible. Online and in-store visits revealed no sustainable seafood
information on labels to help customers make more informed deci-
sions. If and when A&P creates a seafood policy, it should include
avenues to publicly communicate this work by posting its policies
online, issuing press releases, and significantly increasing informa-
tion available at the point of sale via labels and in-store signage.

Red List Sales: Our store visits found several red list species;
however, this number could be even greater. A&P must immedi-
ately discontinue Chilean sea bass and Greenland halibut.

A&P sells at least 13 out of the 22 Red List species: Alaska
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallop, Chilean
sea bass, Greenland halibut, ocean quahog, redfish (a.k.a. ocean
perch), red snapper, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish,

Greenpeace Comments: This is Save Mart’s second year
profiled in Carting Away the Oceans and the company has
dropped even further, now ranked in last place. Internal restructur-
ing seems to be a factor in the company’s inability to complete this
year’s survey, but it is no excuse for the company’s failure to take
any beneficial action independent of the survey process. Save
Mart must develop a comprehensive sustainable seafood policy,
increase transparency, and reduce its Red List sales immediately.
In addition to Greenpeace, there are many resources available for
Save Mart to take responsibility for the seafood it sells.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Save Mart does not appear to
have a sustainable seafood policy; however, it carries sustainable
third-party canned tuna products like Wild Planet. As Save Mart
develops a sustainable seafood policy, it must include fresh,
frozen, and shelf-stable products.

GLOSSARY

AIP: Aquaculture improvement project

Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC): a certification scheme for farmed species. ASC certified products are
supposed to meet certain criteria for responsibly farmed seafood. In some cases, it may not be the best barometer
for whether a certain species was truly farmed responsibly. While it may be a start, it is best for retailers to avoid
exclusively relying on third party certifiers.

Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP): affiliated with the Global Aquaculture Alliance, these are third party standards
that seek to address environmental and social responsibility, animal welfare, food safety and traceability in a voluntary
certification program for aquaculture facilities. BAP primarily covers shrimp, salmon, tilapia, pangasius, channel
catfish, and mussels. Retailers sometimes source BAP certified products according to a coding system (e.g. BAP
2-star, BAP 3-star). While it may be a start, it is best for retailers to avoid exclusively relying on third party certifiers.

Bering Sea Canyons: see page 18

Bycatch: Marine life unintentionally caught and often killed when fishing, like sharks, turtles and juvenile tuna. Some
fishing methods have a higher rate of bycatch than others such as conventional longlines and purse seines employing
fish aggregating devices (FADs).

Ecosystem-based management: in the context of marine environments, it is a shift away from the traditional
strategies in which single species are managed individually. Instead, it is an integrated approach which considers
all key activities, particularly human-related, that affect marine environments. The objective is to ensure sustainable
ecosystems, thereby protecting the resources and services they provide.

Fish Aggregating Device (FAD): an artificial, floating object that attracts schools of tuna along with the (indiscriminate)
aggregation of all kinds of marine life. Fishing with FADs leads to unintended collateral damage, or bycatch, in the
form of dead sea turtles, sharks, and other fish.

FAD-free: Fishing without the use of FADs, setting purse seine nets on free schools of fish. Other marine life is less
impacted when fishing free school, so it is a better option.

FAO: United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. This entity has categorized the ocean’s “major fishing areas”
by a numeric code, and this information aids people in finding out where a particular species was caught.

FIP: Fishery improvement project

Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA): an organization that represents dozens of individuals, associations, and
businesses associated with aquaculture and seafood around the world, with the goal of improving practices and
increasing output across the entire aquaculture production chain.

Gear type: a reference to the fishing method used to catch a particular species of fish. Some gear types (like pole
and line for tuna) are far favorable to the environment than others (like trawling for flatfish, which scrapes and dam-
ages the ocean floor).

GMO (genetically modified) seafood: Unlike natural selective breeding, GMO seafood is lab-created in ways that
would never naturally occur in nature. One company has developed a genetically modified salmon that combines
the DNA of three species: two different species of salmon and a sea eel. It is seeking U.S. approval of this creature
for sale in the U.S., despite there being inadequate safeguards to protect from potential environmental harms due to
farmed fish escapes and unresolved questions related to possible impacts on human health. Retailers are encour-
aged to preemptively reject false solutions to our oceans, like this product.

Greenpeace Red List: a scientifically-developed list of just 22 species of seafood that should not be consumed for
various sustainability reasons, ranging from stock status to method of capture.

Greenpeace Blacklist: a database of fishing vessels and companies engaged in IUU fishing.

Green Belt: This highly productive habitat along the Bering Sea shelf-break is an important area in the Bering Sea.
The nutrient rich waters support fish, birds, sea mammals, and fishers, and this is an area where vulnerable coral and
sponge habitat exists. This is the only major habitat in the Bering Sea where no areas are protected from fishing.

principles and rights at work. Retailers should only source from vessels, companies, canneries, and processors that
operate in full compliance with international labor standards, including ILO Core Conventions, ILO Maritime Labour
Convention, and ILO Work in Fishing Convention.

ISSF: International Seafood Sustainability Foundation

IUU: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (also known as pirate fishing)

Longline: Fishing lines sometimes dozens of miles long, baited with thousands of hooks. This is very indiscriminate
and highly destructive fishing gear.

Marine protected areas: Similar to national parks on land, they offer some level of protection from fishing and other
industrial activities. Safe havens like this are essential to replenish marine ecosystems.

Marine Stewardship Council (MSC): runs a certification scheme for wild fisheries. MSC certified products are
supposed to meet certain sustainability criteria. In some cases, it may not be the best barometer for whether a wild-
caught species was truly caught sustainably. While it may be a start, it is best for retailers to avoid exclusively relying
on third party certifiers.

MSC Chain of Custody certification: an identification, control, and traceability program. It ensures that products
labeled or marketed as MSC certified originated from an MSC certified sustainable fishery.

North Pacific Fishery Management Council (NPFMC): This is the regional fishery management council that has
been appointed by the U.S. Federal Government to manage fisheries in the North Pacific U.S. waters, which includes
Alaska. It is the relevant council that must decide whether or not to protect the Bering Sea Canyons from destructive
fishing methods.

Ocean safe: Tuna sourced from healthy stocks and caught using more sustainable fishing methods such as pole and
line, handline, troll-caught, or purse seine fishing on free schools.

Pole and line: a highly selective form of fishing that has virtually no bycatch, as tuna are caught one by one with a
fishing pole and a line.

Scientific name: also known as Latin name or species name, this clarifies precisely what species is in the package.
Given that mislabeled seafood is a common problem in the industry and many species of fish are known by several
names, retailers are encouraged to include this information on their labels.

Third party audit: when an independent party, unaffiliated with either the company or the certifying group, checks
whether the product or process meets the standard holder’s standards. While a very valuable tool, a third party
auditor’s performance is only as good as the standards, which serve as the baseline for the audit.

Three biggest tuna brands: Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea, and StarKist. These are the three largest vendors of
canned tuna in the U.S. market, and are all known to sell tuna that has been caught using destructive, irresponsible,
and wasteful tuna fishing practices.

Top-tier Red List species: the worst of the worst to sell on Greenpeace’s Red List. The following should not be sold
regardless of method of capture: Atlantic halibut, Chilean sea bass, hoki, orange roughy, sharks, and bluefin tuna.

Transshipment at sea: a legal practice wherein one vessel transfers its cargo from its hold to that of another vessel
directly next to it, without needing to go to port. This practice is often how unethical companies can commingle
legally caught and illegally caught seafood and essentially “launder” pirated seafood (as well as hide labor abuse; see
page 13).

Yellow Card (issued by the European Union): this is a trade warning that the EU has issued to various countries in
Southeast Asia, threatening trade sanctions (a red card) if these countries do not immediately act to remove illegally-
caught products from their exports to the EU.
