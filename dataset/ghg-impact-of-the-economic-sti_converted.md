Summary

ICF  examined  the  sixteen  key  energy,  environment,  and  technology
provisions,  as  well  as  the  major  highway  infrastructure  provision  of  the
Economic  Stimulus  Package  proposal  circulated  to  Congress  on  January
20th, 2009, and analyzed the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of each
provision. For some provisions, ICF was able to give quantitative estimates
of  the  annual  CO2  increases  or  reductions  based  on  the  amount  of  money
proposed  to  be  spent.  For  others,  ICF  developed  scenarios  to  model  the
potential  emissions  impact  based  on  how  specific  energy  efficiency  and
renewable energy funds were spent. For provisions that focused on research
and  development,  targeted  tax  credits,  or  funding  for  non  commercially-
ready  technology,  ICF  provided  qualitative  insight  as  to  the  potential
emissions  impacts  of  these  initiatives.    The  quantitative  estimates  are
preliminary estimates based on limited data and reasonable but unconfirmed
assumptions.

Below is a summary of our results.

PART 1: Sixteen key energy and climate-related provisions in
the Economic Stimulus Package

1. Reliable, Efficient Electricity Grid:

$11 billion for research and development, pilot projects, and federal matching funds
for the Smart Grid Investment Program to modernize the electricity grid making it
more efficient, secure, and reliable and build new power lines to transmit clean,
renewable energy from sources throughout the nation.

Investing in smart grid technology has the potential to better connect technology that will
reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits of a Smart Grid are improved
reliability, security and safety; lower electricity prices, new and improved products and
services, operational efficiencies, and environmental protection. Smart Grids can offer
consumers the ability to take advantage of off-peak pricing by remotely controlling
individual appliances or installing their own sources of generation. They also provide
electric utilities with a host of capabilities, including quickly isolating the source of
power outages, reading meters remotely, and opening up entirely new business and
partnership opportunities.

While increased efficiency of the grid and a greater ability to connect cleaner or
renewable decentralized power generation would have a positive impact in reducing
GHG emissions, there is also a possibility that increased grid efficiency will lead to lower
electricity prices, resulting in an increase in electricity demand prior to the improvement
of grid emissions. Development of a Smart Grid will probably be helpful in reducing
future GHG emissions but the extent, timing the effect of this specific program are
difficult to quantify.

2 Renewable Energy Loan Guarantees:

$8 billion for loans for renewable energy power generation and transmission
projects.

Renewable energy loan guarantees will likely have a positive impact on GHG emissions,
but this impact is difficult to estimate. Loan guarantees for renewable energy will make it
easier for projects to find financing, and should then lead to more projects being installed.
This program is especially important for emerging technologies like solar thermal,
geothermal, tidal, and advanced wind generation, as it makes it less risky for banks and
utilities to invest in technologies that have a shorter history of installed projects.

SUMMARY REPORT
January 29, 2009

The 2005 Energy Policy Act authorized the U.S. Department of Energy to begin offering
loan guarantees to energy projects that reduce greenhouse gases.1 While a considerable
amount of these guarantees have been directed towards renewable energy projects, DOE
has also used this fund to support nuclear and “clean coal” demonstration projects. The
renewable energy industry has relied on banks to finance many large-scale projects, and
banks have in turn benefited from renewable production tax credits and other tax equity
that has reduced the perceived financial risk of renewable investments.2 In the most
recent versions of the Economic Stimulus plan, the Ways and Means committee has
edited this provision to include a renewable energy production tax credit and a temporary
renewable energy investment tax credit to spur renewable development, as well as clean
energy bonds to increase investment.3

3. GSA Federal Buildings:

$6.7 billion for renovations and repairs to federal buildings including at least $6
billion focused on increasing energy efficiency and conservation. Projects are
selected based on GSA's ready-to-go priority list.

Federal building energy efficiency will have a positive impact on U.S. GHG emissions.
Based on historical experience with similar programs, ICF estimates that if $6 billion was
invested in an effective energy efficiency and conservation program, it could result in a
reduction of 17.5 million metric tons of CO2 per year.4

4. · Local Government Energy Efficiency Block Grants:

$6.9 billion to help state and local governments make investments that make them
more energy efficient and reduce carbon emissions.

Local government energy efficiency block grants will likely have a positive impact on
U.S. GHG emissions. Based on historical experience with similar programs, ICF
estimates that a $6.9 billion investment in energy efficiency could reduce CO2 emissions

by 20.1 million metric tons per year.5 This provision could also save state and local
governments $3 billion in energy costs every year.

5. Energy Efficiency Housing Retrofits:

$2.5 billion for a new program to upgrade HUD sponsored low-income housing to
increase energy efficiency, including new insulation, windows, and furnaces. Funds
will be competitively awarded.

Energy efficient housing retrofits will have a positive impact on U.S. GHG emissions.
ICF estimates that a $2.5 billion investment in housing energy efficiency could reduce
CO2 emissions by 7.28 million metric tons annually, and by as much as 87.6 million
metric tons over the lifetime of the programs’ efficiency improvements.6 This provision
could also save homeowners nearly $1.25 billion in utility costs every year.

6. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Research:

$2 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy research, development,
demonstration, and deployment activities to foster energy independence, reduce
carbon emissions, and cut utility bills. Funds are awarded on a competitive basis to
universities, companies, and national laboratories.

Investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy R & D will likely have a positive
impact on U.S. GHG emissions, but this impact is difficult to estimate. R&D at the
federal level has helped drive development of more efficient solar panels and arrays,
hybrid engine technology, and a number of advancements in heating, cooling, and
lighting technology. However, it is very difficult to quantify the historical impact of
federal R & D grants on energy efficiency, much less predict the future return on
investment of research dollars.

7. Advanced Battery Loans and Grants:

$2 billion for the Advanced Battery Loan Guarantee and Grants Program, to
support U.S. manufacturers of advanced vehicle batteries and battery systems.
America should lead the world in transforming the way automobiles are powered.

SUMMARY REPORT
January 29, 2009

Like R&D in energy efficiency and renewable energy, investments in battery technology
will likely have a positive impact on U.S. GHG emissions, but this impact is difficult to
estimate. Battery research will likely yield batteries that are more efficient, last longer,
and require less hazardous chemicals in manufacturing.  Coupled with a low- or zero
emitting generating electricity grid, this would allow the development of lower carbon
transportation options in the mid and long-term.

8. Energy Efficiency Grants and Loans for Institutions:

$1.5 billion for energy sustainability and efficiency grants and loans to help school
districts, institutes of higher education, local governments, and municipal utilities
implement projects that will make them more energy efficient.

Energy efficiency loans and grants for schools will likely have a positive impact on U.S.
GHG emissions. Based on historical experience with similar programs, ICF estimates that
a well-targeted energy efficiency program for schools could reduce CO2 emissions by as
much as 4.6 million metric tons every year, and could save schools $700 million in
energy costs every year.7

9.· Home Weatherization:

$6.2 billion to help low-income families reduce their energy costs by weatherizing
their homes and make our country more energy efficient.

Home weatherization efforts will likely have a positive impact on global climate. This
impact is quantifiable, but difficult to estimate because of the wide spread in both the
efficiency of insulation in different climate regions, and the cost of installation in
different parts of the country. ICF estimates that a well-targeted $6.2 billion home
insulation program could reduce CO2 emissions by at least 8 million metric tons annually,
or 131 million metric tons over the useful life of the insulation.8

7 See ICF GHG calculator
8 See ICF GHG calculator. It should be noted that because of the significant difference in energy efficiency gains from
insulation,  different  insulation  types  and  R  factors,  and  installation  costs,  this  is  a  general  estimate  of  potential
savings  from  targeted  insulation  programs.  Installation  costs  estimated  using  price  quotes  from  companies  in
different climate regions. Fiberglass insulation carries a 15-year warranty for most companies, so this was used as a
proxy for the useful life of the insulation. Insulation efficiency gains from EPA.GOV.

10. Smart Appliances:

$300 million to provide consumers with rebates for buying energy efficient Energy
Star products to replace old appliances, which will lower energy bills.

A smart appliance incentive program would likely have a positive impact on U.S. GHG
emissions. Depending on how the program was structured, a rebate or free appliance
program could have a positive impact on emissions and home energy bills. ICF
conducted a “bottom up” analysis of appliances and found that CO2 emissions reductions
could vary considerably with both the type of energy-saving technology, what the energy
saving technology was replacing, the size of the rebate offered and its effectiveness in
changing consumer behavior. Investing $300 million in free CFL light bulbs would result
in an annual CO2 reduction of 3.4 million metric tons. Rebates that covered the cost
difference between an ENERGY STAR and non-ENERGY STAR clothes washer and
refrigerator could result in CO2 reductions of 108,472 and 13,769 metric tons of CO2 per
year, respectively.9 This assumes that the rebates were highly effective in encouraging
consumers to adopt higher efficiency technologies.

If new ENERGY STAR refrigerators and other appliances replaced older non-ENERGY
STAR models, energy savings could be even more significant. A $300 million
“refrigerator retirement” program, in which the Federal government offered a free
ENERGY STAR refrigerator to anyone turning in a non-ENERGY STAR refrigerator
manufactured before 2001 could save 683,000 metric tons of CO2-e over the useful life
of the new refrigerators, or 52,000 metric tons of CO2 annually. It would also save
homeowners a combined $80 million in avoided energy costs over the lifetime of the
refrigerators.10

11· GSA Federal Fleet:

$600 million to replace older vehicles owned by the federal government with
alternative fuel automobiles that will save on fuel costs and reduce carbon
emissions.

Replacing older vehicles with alternative fuel vehicles will have an uncertain impact on
GHG emissions. There is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding how much better
corn-based ethanol would be from a GHG standpoint.

In the combustion stage, ethanol and gasoline have virtually the same CO2 emissions.
New gasoline and diesel vehicles usually get better mileage than alternative fuel vehicles.

However, studies conducted on the lifecycle impact of corn-based ethanol versus gasoline
have found that the lifecycle impact of ethanol is 20-25% lower than that of gasoline,
including the GHG emissions associated with the growing vs. drilling, transportation, and
combustion phases of the fuel use.11 These calculations, however, do not take into
account the impact of using food crops for fuel, and the deforestation that would might
occur as more food crops were put into use as fuel. The U.S. EPA is currently assessing
the appropriate methodology to determine the climate impacts of these fuels.

12 Electric Transportation:

$200 million for a new grant program to encourage electric vehicle technologies.

A program encouraging electric vehicle technology could have a positive impact on GHG
emissions but this impact is difficult to quantify. The GHG benefit of electric vehicles
depends on the GHG footprint of the electric generating system. As the United States
increases its percentage of electricity generated by cleaner resources, the carbon impact
of electric vehicles will continue to decrease. The success of electric vehicles as a GHG
reduction strategy is also heavily reliant on developments in both smart grid technology
and advanced batteries.

13 Cleaning Fossil Energy:

$2.4 billion for carbon capture and sequestration technology demonstration
projects. This funding will provide valuable information necessary to reduce the
amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere from industrial facilities and
fossil fuel power plants.

A program supporting carbon capture and sequestration could have a positive impact on
U.S. GHG emissions, but this impact is difficult to estimate. This provision is for
demonstration projects only, so it is difficult to estimate the impact it will have on GHG
emissions.

Many leading scientific and policy organizations see CCS as a “bridge” between our
current dependence on fossil fuels and a future cleaner power mix. The IPCC predicts
that we could conceivably store 2-10 trillion tons of CO2 through CCS. UNEP, in their
analysis of IPCC studies, concluded that given its cost competitiveness and the likely
amount of capacity, geological storage using CCS could account for 15 - 55% of all
emission reductions needed between now and 2100 for stabilizing greenhouse gas

and others have had some promising technological results, but as of 2008, no major
commercial CCS projects have been launched. 13, 14

14. Department of Defense Research:

$350 million for research into using renewable energy to power weapons systems
and military bases.

A program to use renewable energy to power weapon systems and military bases would
have a positive impact on U.S. GHG emissions. The U.S. Department of Defense is the
largest single GHG emitting entity in the world15.  While it is difficult to estimate the
carbon avoided by powering weapons systems with renewable energy, it is possible to
estimate the positive GHG emissions impact of investing this money in wind and solar to
power military bases.

15. Alternative Buses and Trucks:

$400 million to help state and local governments purchase efficient alternative fuel
vehicles to reduce fuel costs and carbon emissions.

Investing in alternative buses and trucks would have a positive GHG impact, but this
impact is difficult to quantify. Replacing older vehicles with newer ones will likely
reduce the overall GHG emissions for the fleet. However, corn-based ethanol likely has
only a slightly better CO2 impact than gasoline, when all lifecycle costs are incorporated.
The EPA will be coming out with a more definitive LCA analysis of ethanol later this
year.

17 Industrial Energy Efficiency:

$500 million for energy efficient manufacturing demonstration projects.

Industrial energy efficiency demonstration projects will likely have a positive impact on
U.S. GHG emissions. While the impact of energy efficient demonstration impacts is
potentially quantifiable, the CO2 emissions reductions vary dramatically based on the
type of demonstration project being funded. Combined heat and power is one potentially
valuable option for this type of grant program, and studies have shown that CHP can
reduce industrial energy use by 30-50 percent. Other projects could include improved
boiler and steam system efficiency, increased electric motor efficiency and improved
industrial process efficiency.  The U.S. DOE Save Energy Now program is a national
initiative of the Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) to drive a 25% reduction in
industrial energy intensity in 10 years.  Save Energy Now energy assessments have
helped selected large U.S. manufacturing facilities save an average of $2 million, or 8%
of their total energy costs.

18. Diesel Emissions Reduction:

$300 million for grants and loans to state and local governments for projects that
reduce diesel emissions, benefiting public health and reducing global warming. This
includes technologies to retrofit emission exhaust systems on school buses, replace
engines and vehicles, and establish anti-idling programs. 70% of the funds go to
competitive grants and 30% funds grants to states with approved programs. Last
year EPA was able to fund only 27% of the applications received.

This provision of the stimulus bill will have a positive impact on air pollution and
potentially on GHG emissions, but the GHG impact is difficult to quantify. The EPA
recently finalized new clean diesel rules that the agency reports will cut NOx and
particulate matter emissions by 90%.16 However, the most inexpensive way to pursue
diesel retrofits is through “add on” technology, such as additional exhaust filters, which
reduce criteria pollutants but may increase GHG emissions.   Anti-idling rules could
reduce GHG emissions.

PART 2: Potential Greenhouse Gas Impacts from
Transportation Funding In the Draft Economic Stimulus
Package

Background

In the first draft of the Economic Stimulus Package circulated to Congress, $30 billion was
designated for highway and bridge construction projects. This $30 billion was to be allocated to
the states to fund “shovel-ready” projects they had in their project pipeline17.

To estimate the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of this transportation funding, ICF
estimated the potential GHG impact of new highway construction, highway maintenance, and
new light rail construction. ICF examined the GHG impact of both the construction phase and the
use phase of each transportation project. ICF then looked at reference scenarios under which this
money could be spent:

•  100% spent on new roads

•  100% spent on road maintenance

•  100% on new light rail

•  50% spent on new roads and 50% on road maintenance.

Based on transportation projects currently in state pipelines, approximately 80% of money is
allocated for roads, 20% for transit projects. Of the road projects, about half of the funding is
dedicated to new highways, half to highway maintenance and repair18. Because the Economic
Stimulus package has approximately $10-$12 billion dedicated to transit projects, and because
this provision of the stimulus package is dedicated to “highway and bridge construction”, ICF
used a scenario of 50% new highways/50% maintenance as the assumed funding scenario.

18 See appendix A. 50%/50% scenario based on an average of “shovel ready” transportation projects for which states
were currently seeking Federal funding.

GHG Lifecycle Impacts – Construction, Maintenance, Disposal

The GHG emissions associated with the actual construction, maintenance, and deconstruction or
disposal of bridges and highways is quantifiable. Based on historic GHG emissions associated
with road construction and maintenance alone, ICF estimates that GHG emissions would be the
following21:

1. For the assumed mix of new highways versus highway maintenance (50% new highway,
50% maintenance) if $30 billion was spent on new roads and repair, the GHG impact from
construction could be approximately 30 million metric tons of CO2e.

2. If all $30 billion was spent on highway construction, this negative GHG impact from
construction could increase to approximately 39 million metric tons of CO2e.

19 For calculations of GHG emissions, see the discussion section.

analysis tool. This category is an average of passenger trains and other mass-passenger transportation construction

3. If all $30 billion was instead spent on road maintenance and repair, the GHG impact
from construction could be reduced to approximately 21 million metric tons of CO2e.

4. If all $30 billion was spent on construction of new rail transportation,22 the GHG Impact
could be approximately 18 million metric tons.

GHG Impacts of the Use of Transportation Projects

While GHG emissions associated with construction are an important part of the overall GHG
impacts associated with highway construction and maintenance, there is also an impact associated
with the vehicles driving on the roads, and the trains riding on the rails. This effect is highly
variable and dependent on local congestion, land use and related factors.  The estimates below are
based on past studies of these effects.

1. The assumed mix of new highways versus highway maintenance (50% new highway, 50%
maintenance) could have an estimated negative GHG impact of 68 to 105 million metric
tons of CO2e over 50 years from additional vehicle emissions23.

2. If all $30 billion was spent on highway construction, this negative GHG impact could be
131 to 213 million metric tons over 50 years.

3. If all $30 billion was instead spent on maintenance and repair, the GHG impact could be
reduced by 2 million metric tons over 50 years.

4. If all $30 billion was spent on light rail construction, the GHG impact could be reduced
by 15 million metric tons over 50 years.

From the combined analysis of the construction and use phase of highway expansion, highway
maintenance, and transit projects, ICF found that if $30 billion is spent on new highways, the 50-
year impact of this investment could potentially increase GHG emissions by 170 to 251 million
total metric tons. Investment in road maintenance could have a potential 50-year impact of 19
million total metric tons of GHG emissions, and an investment in light rail could result in 4
million total metric tons of GHG emissions. Investment in the most likely scenario of 50% new
vehicle lane miles and 50% road maintenance would result in a total 50-year impact of 98 to 135
million metric tons of GHG emissions.

It should be noted that, other than the “50% new roads, 50% road maintenance” scenario, other
scenarios are purely hypothetical, and should be seen as the potential bounds for what is possible
in terms of GHG emissions based on the entire spectrum of possible transportation investments.
Further research and a more extensive literature review also needs to be done to quantify the
GHG benefits from congestion relief, to determine how much potential GHG reductions could be
generated by a targeted, $30 billion investment.  More discussion of these factors is included
below.

22 EIO-LCA did not have a separate number for the LCA of light rail, so general rail construction was used.
23 Note: The VMTs from highways are an estimate of passenger vehicles, and do not include vehicle freight, so that a

comparable comparison can be made to passenger rail public transport.

Analysis of new road construction, road maintenance, public
transportation, and their relative impacts on GHG emissions.

What are the major components of highway and transit GHG emissions?

To calculate the GHG emissions associated with highway and transit projects, ICF looked at the
life-cycle impacts of each project, including the impact of the raw materials used to build the
transportation system (concrete, asphalt, etc…), the equipment and energy needed to build the
transportation system, the energy needed to maintain and repair the system, and the actual vehicle
emissions generated by using the system. For both highways and transit, we used Carnegie
Mellon’s EIO LCA tool, which uses Department of Commerce data and EPA emission factors to
calculate GHG emissions per dollar over the life of a project. For vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
emissions, we used EPA emission factors, as well as comprehensive studies that analyzed the
VMT impact of various types of transportation development.

Does building new roads increase or decrease GHG emissions from vehicles?

There has been a significant amount of research on whether building new roads increases or
decreases GHG emissions. Those who believe that new roads decrease vehicle GHG emissions
argue that new roads (at least in the short term) alleviate congestion and move traffic from
“rougher” to “smoother” roads, which decreases idling, and helps vehicles keep their mpg as high
as possible. 2425 A study by the American Highway Users Alliance concluded that in urban areas,
highway widening projects were “an important strategy for alleviating congestion,” but
recognized that for CO2 benefits to materialize, any increase in highway capacity also required
additional strategies, including smart urban planning, increasing public transit capacity, timely
highway maintenance, and innovative strategies like congestion pricing.26  Under their scenario
for relieving the nation’s 233 worst “bottlenecks”, they estimated that the 20-year impact would
reduce CO2 emissions by 390 million tons. Unfortunately, the study did not discuss how much it
would cost to relieve these bottlenecks, or the relative spending for increased lane capacity,
versus investments in better urban planning, transit, congestion pricing and tolls, and other
congestion relief strategies.27

Another group of researchers, looking at the long-term impacts of new highway construction, has
concluded that new roads have a significant negative impact on GHG emissions over their useful
life. They conclude that new roads not only are responsible for “induced traffic” (people that
switch from an old road to a new road), but also “generated traffic” (including people who start
driving or drive more because of the availability of a new road.)28 According to a study by the

24 Hoover and Burt. “Build it and Will They Drive? Modeling Light-Duty Vehicle Travel Demand” Conference Board of

Canada, 2008.

SUMMARY REPORT
January 29, 2009

Sightline Institute, for every new lane-mile of highway built, CO2 emissions from vehicle use will
increase by 113 to 183 tons over the 50-year life of that road.29 Sightline institute found that while
additional highway lane-miles would temporarily provide a net congestion relief (equal to 7,000
tons of CO2), this net benefit would be more than cancelled out by future net additional vehicle
miles traveled (VMT), both on the highway and on surrounding roads, due to increases in
population densities and increased average driving distances around new highways. This study
has been supported by similar findings by the Victoria Transport Policy Institute and the Ontario
Good Roads Association.30

If every additional mile of highway contributes 113,000 to 183,000 tons of CO2 over 50 years,
then the 50 year impact of $30 billion in new highway miles would be an additional 131 to 213
million metric tons of CO2, excluding construction GHG emissions. 31

Does road maintenance reduce CO2 emissions?

The physical maintenance of roads has a negative (increasing) impact on GHG emissions, a
consequence of the materials and construction equipment needed to provide maintenance. But is
this negative impact on GHG emissions negated by the positive impact of well-maintained roads
on vehicle GHG emissions?

Researchers have examined the positive impact of well-maintained roads on GHG emissions, and
have found that as road quality improves, vehicle GHG emissions decrease. A study by the
Missouri Department of Transportation found that their road smoothing program for 5,600 miles
of state highways saved drivers 2.4% in fuel costs.32 A study of road conditions in Brazil found
that smoother roads increased truck mpg by more than 5%33. An Ontario, Canada study found that
a road smoothing program can reduce the CO2 emissions from a well-traveled road by 30,000 kg
per mile per year.34 At the highest end of the fuel-saving spectrum, a test study in Norway found
that road maintenance can reduce GHG emissions by as much as 38%35.

ICF used the findings of the Ontario, Canada study, estimating that for a well-traveled road
(5,000+vehicles/day), road maintenance can reduce CO2 emissions by 30,000kg per mile per

29 Williams-Derry. “Increases in Greenhouse-gas Emissions from Highway Widening Projects”, Sightline Institute, 2007.

Should be noted that the reason for the wide range in CO2 emissions was the challenge in estimating “induced
traffic” on the average highway mile.

Trails estimates based on the Federal Highway Administration Highway Economic Requirements that the average
cost per mile of highway is between $3-9 million in rural areas, and $5-19 million in urban areas without any
environmental or right-of-way challenges. They estimate that including permitting and other legal challenges, the
average cost of a mile of road can increase to $17-$75 million in some areas. For the purpose of this study, an
average of rural and city highway costs was used: $23.5 million/mile

year. If $30 billion of the state DOT funding were spent on road maintenance and repair, ICF
estimates that the positive GHG reductions could be 2 million metric tons of CO2 over 50 years.36

How much does public transportation reduce GHG emissions?

A number of studies have examined the impact of public transportation on GHG emissions,
primarily by quantifying the current ridership on public transportation and estimating the impact
of those riders relative to if those riders chose to drive for their commutes instead of riding public
transit. A 2007 study by ICF International found that current public transportation infrastructure
reduces U.S. gasoline consumption by 1.4 billion gallons every year.37 An American Public
Transportation Association study found that overall public transit reduced CO2 by a net 7.6
million tons38. Other studies have shown that public transit saves the average commuting
household over $6,000/yr39, and that for every $1 billion invested in transit operations, 60,000
jobs are created.40

Estimates for how much each new mile of public transit reduces GHG emissions are more
difficult to come by41. To estimate the positive environmental impact of public transit, ICF looked
at the estimated cost per mile of light rail systems, as well as the expected number of rides per
year. Similar scenarios could be developed for bus and train travel, based on demonstrated
ridership of specific projects. Light rail costs ranged from $15 million/mile to over $100 million
per mile, with an average cost of $35 million per mile42. Average ridership also varied
significantly, from 14,000 riders per day (St Louis) to over 200,000 riders per day (Calgary).

According to the 2005 National Transit Database, there are 1,385 miles of light rail systems in the
U.S. and 1.7 billion passenger miles traveled (PMT) on them in 2005. Based on this historical
data, as well as U.S. Department of Commerce and state Department of Transportation estimates
of transit cost per mile, ICF developed a hypothetical scenario where light rail would cost $35
million/mile and have a ridership of 1.2 million passengers per mile per year.43 Under this
scenario, $30 billion invested in light rail would pay for 857 miles of light rail, and result in 1.1
billion additional passenger miles per year. Rail travel per passenger mile only emits 0.37 lbs of
GHG emissions per passenger mile, as compared to 0.96 lbs for the average automobile 44.  This

roads (30,000kg/mile/yr).

41 Most estimates of the positive GHG impact of public transportation examine the impact of current ridership on
avoided GHG emissions. Even state-level studies that project potential transit ridership for new projects rarely
include estimates of avoided GHG emissions.

transit investment could result in the avoidance of 273,000 metric tons of CO2e a year, and 15
million metric tons over 50 years45. If this investment was directed at expanding transit capacity
in the largest urban areas, the avoided CO2 emissions might be even higher.46
