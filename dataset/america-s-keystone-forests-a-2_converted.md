The purpose of this User’s Guide is to
inform activists and citizens about the
various forms of federal land manage-
ment that can provide increased pro-
tection. For each land classification,
one will find general background
information, an explanation of how
such areas are established, and issues
to consider when deciding on the best
protection approach for a particular
area. The following are the major pub-
lic land categories, listed from most
protected to least protected:

NATIONAL WILDERNESS
PRESERVATION SYSTEM

Background
The National Wilderness Preservation
System is not an independent federal
land system. Congress may designate
wilderness areas only on existing feder-
al lands that meet the wilderness crite-
ria set out in the act. This includes land
managed by the National Park Service,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S.
Forest Service and Bureau of Land
Management.

Wilderness areas are protected from

the construction of roads, dams or
other permanent structures. Timber
cutting, new mining claims and mineral
leasing, oil and gas development and
motorized vehicles and equipment are
prohibited. Special provisions in the
law allow firefighting, insect and dis-
ease control and emergency actions to
insure the health and safety of people.
The law allows certain non-conforming
pre-existing uses, such as livestock
grazing, to continue.

The designation of wilderness areas
requires an act of Congress. The criteria
for new wilderness areas are set in the
Wilderness Act. Wilderness is defined
in the act as an area of undeveloped
federal land that meets the following
criteria:

! generally appears to have been

affected primarily by the forces of
nature, with the imprint of man’s work
substantially unnoticeable;

! has outstanding opportunities for
solitude or a primitive and unconfined
type of recreation;

! has at least 5,000 acres or is of suf-

ficient size as to make practical its
preservation and use in an unimpaired
condition; and

! may also contain ecological, geo-
logical, or other features of scientific,
educational, scenic or historical value.

Issues to Consider
By the mid-1980s, the creation of new
wilderness areas had become the major
offensive strategy of land preservation
activists. Wilderness designation
ensures strong and lasting protection.
Unfortunately, many important areas
are ineligible for designation under the
Wilderness Act. Most of the nation’s
federal public lands do not qualify
because of the presence of roads or
other factors. Land that is state-owned
or privately owned cannot be designat-
ed under the Wilderness Act.

Another major problem is a lack of
public awareness about federal wilder-
ness designation. For example, what
designations allow hunting and which
prohibit it? Lack of knowledge can

cause wilderness proposals to be con-
troversial and make wilderness legisla-
tion difficult to pass.

Federal land management agencies

usually fail to adequately consider
roadless areas for their potential for
wilderness protection. Instead, designa-
tion of new wilderness has almost
always been driven by the efforts of
concerned citizens. This tradition con-
tinues today, with citizen-inspired
wilderness legislation pending or
planned for a number of states and ter-
ritories, including Alaska, California,
Colorado, the northern Rocky
Mountains, Puerto Rico, Utah, Vermont
and Washington.

NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM

Background
Most national park areas are created
by an act of Congress. First, a “special
resource study” conducted by the
National Park Service is usually
required. After the study is completed,
Congress must pass a bill that authoriz-
es the establishment of a new National
Park System unit. Each unit has its own
unique authorizing legislation. The
National Park System is made up of a
wide range of natural, historic and
archaeological units. Each has a differ-
ent purpose and thus permits different
activities within its boundaries. This
allows national parks to be tailored in
creative ways to address site-specific
problems and opportunities.

There are more than 30 different
National Park System classifications all
under the jurisdiction of the National

Park Service. The following are the
most useful designations for land pro-
tection activists, listed from the most
protected to least protected category:

National Park Wilderness
Designated wilderness areas in national
parks have the strongest protection of
any federal public lands. They prohibit
not only the activities banned under
the Wilderness Act, but also livestock
grazing, which is permitted in most
other federal wilderness areas. There
are currently 54 National Park System
wilderness areas totaling almost 44 mil-
lion acres. New National Park System
wilderness requires an act of Congress.

National Preserves
A national preserve is a unit of the
National Park System that is identical in
management policy and intent to that
of a national park, except that
Congress has authorized a particular
activity or type of use in each that does
not occur in a national park. For exam-
ple, national preserves in Alaska allow
sport hunting and trapping.

National Monuments
National monuments are intended to
preserve at least one nationally signifi-
cant resource. They are usually created
under the Antiquities Act of 1906,
which authorizes the president to
declare by public proclamation land-
marks, structures and other objects of
historic or scientific interest situated on
lands owned or controlled by the gov-
ernment to be national monuments.

National Rivers, Seashores and
Lakeshores
National rivers preserve ribbons of land
bordering on free-flowing streams,
which have not been dammed, chan-
neled or otherwise altered. These areas
allow recreational activities such as hik-
ing, canoeing and hunting. National
rivers include several variations, such as
national river and recreation area, Wild
and Scenic River and scenic river way.
National seashores and lakeshores
are very similar in purpose and man-
agement to national rivers. Hunting is

allowed in most national seashores and
lakeshores unless otherwise specified in
the authorizing legislation.

NATIONAL WILD AND SCENIC
RIVERS SYSTEM

National Recreation Areas
Originally, national recreation areas
(NRAs) were units surrounding reser-
voirs impounded by other federal
agencies. The concept of recreation
areas has grown to include other lands
and waters protected by Congress for
recreational use, including major areas
in urban centers. The focus is primarily
on providing public recreation while
preserving natural values. National
recreation areas are generally the most
developed and intensively used of the
natural area National Park System
units. However, with few exceptions
they still provide protection from log-
ging, livestock grazing, mining, oil and
gas drilling and other extractive activi-
ties.

Issues to Consider
Along with federal wilderness areas,
national parks have proven over time
to provide the strongest and most per-
manent protection for large wild land-
scapes. The average new national park
takes many years to go from vision to
reality. However, once a national park
is created, the land's preservation is a
battle that will not have to be fought
again. It is no coincidence that the
most ecologically intact landscapes in
the United States are centered on
national parks or wilderness areas.

A number of campaigns are under-

way to create new National Park
System units to protect significant for-
est lands. The most prominent of these
park proposals are Blackwater Canyon
National Park (West Virginia), Hells
Canyon-Chief Joseph National Preserve
(Idaho, Oregon and Washington),
Maine Woods National Park and
Preserve (Maine) and Mount Hood
National Park (Oregon).

Background
The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968
establishes the Wild and Scenic Rivers
System that includes “wild,”“scenic”
and “recreational” rivers. Wild rivers
must be “essentially primitive and
waters unpolluted.” Scenic rivers are
“largely primitive and shorelines large-
ly undeveloped.” Recreational rivers
“are readily accessible by road or rail-
road” and “may have some develop-
ment along their shorelines, and...may
have undergone some impoundment
or diversion in the past.”

Wild and Scenic Rivers include a
half-mile corridor on both sides of the
river and prohibit the construction of
new dams or other diversions. Wild
and Scenic Rivers can be designated on
federal, state, or private lands and pro-
vide for the acquisition of private lands
within the river corridor.

There are currently 175 designated
units of the National Wild and Scenic
Rivers System encompassing 11,329
miles of river. They are managed pri-
marily by various federal agencies,
including the National Park Service, the
Forest Service, the Bureau of Land
Management and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. Several rivers are man-
aged by state agencies.

National Wild and Scenic River
Protection Options
The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act desig-
nated 156 rivers for immediate inclu-
sion in the National Wild and Scenic
Rivers System. It also provided for the
study of additional rivers for potential
inclusion in the system, and included
an initial list of 136 study rivers. After a
study has been completed, rivers can
be authorized for inclusion in the
National Wild and Scenic Rivers System
by an act of Congress or by individual
state legislation submitted for the
Interior secretary’s approval.

In 1982, the National Park Service

completed the extensive National
Rivers Inventory (updated in 1993),
that listed river segments that are free-

flowing and have one or more “out-
standingly remarkable values.” Most of
the rivers studied under the Wild and
Scenic Rivers Act and the National
Rivers Inventory have not yet been des-
ignated as Wild and Scenic Rivers.

Issues to Consider
The prohibition of new dams and
water diversions alone makes it worth
adding rivers to the Wild and Scenic
Rivers System. Depending on the river
classification and land management
agency, designation under the Wild
and Scenic Rivers Act can significantly
strengthen river corridor protection.
Although a Wild and Scenic River des-
ignation does not ensure the protec-
tion of private lands, it provides a
mechanism for public acquisition,
which can make future protection
possible.

NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
SYSTEM

Background
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
administers the 93 million-acre
National Wildlife Refuge System
(NWRS). The mission of the National
Wildlife Refuge System is to “adminis-
ter a national network of lands and
water for the conservation, manage-
ment and where appropriate, restora-
tion of the fish, wildlife and plant
resources and their habitats within the
United States for the benefit of present
and future generations of Americans.”
The NWRS includes 535 National
Wildlife Refuges and other areas, total-
ing 91 million acres of land and water.
The 1997 National Wildlife Refuge

System Improvement Act requires
development of management plans for
each refuge in the system, sets stan-
dards for refuge protection and estab-
lishes that the first purpose of refuge
management is to protect biodiversity.
In terms of on-the-ground manage-
ment, many national wildlife refuges
have fairly strong protection. They do
not allow commercial logging, mining
and most other industrial activities.
They usually have minimal recreational

development and low public use. Many
endangered wildlife species have
recovered due, in large part, to nation-
al wildlife refuges. However, national
wildlife refuges do not necessarily
ensure the same level of protection as
wilderness or National Park System
units (see below).

National Wildlife Refuge Protection
Options
Many national wildlife refuges contin-
ue to permit uses that are clearly dam-
aging to native biodiversity. Some
refuges face massive threats, such as
the proposed drilling for oil and gas in
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,
and several already have active oil and
gas wells. Intensive wildlife manipula-
tion is often practiced and commercial
livestock grazing is allowed in most of
the western refuges. Sport hunting,
which is allowed in more than half of
the national wildlife refuges, is consid-
ered by many conservationists to be
inconsistent with the purpose of the
refuge system.

New national wildlife refuges can be

created through specific legislation by
the U.S. Congress to authorize the
establishment of a refuge or an expan-
sion. Moreover, there are a number of
options for providing key national
wildlife refuge lands with a higher
level of protection. These options
include the designation of qualified
lands under the National Wilderness
Preservation System, the transfer of
certain areas to the National Park
System or the designation of areas as
additions to the National Wild and
Scenic River System.

Issues to Consider
Few major new units have been added
to the National Wildlife Refuge System
in recent years. Meanwhile, conserva-
tionists have been so overwhelmed by
the protection of national forests and
Bureau of Land Management lands
that they have paid relatively little
attention to providing better protec-
tion for our existing national wildlife
refuges. In fact, there is no active
national wildlife refuge movement in

the United States today. This is an
important and unfinished part of the
American land conservation agenda.

NATIONAL FORESTS

Background
The National Forest System encompass-
es 191 million acres of national forests
and national grasslands. These lands
are managed for a wide range of
“multiple uses,” including resource
extraction (such as logging, livestock
grazing, mining, and oil and gas
drilling), recreation (such as hiking,
camping, skiing, hunting, fishing, off-
roading and snowmobiling), watershed
protection and animal and plant
habitat.

National Forest Protection Options
Citizen activists from around the coun-
try have been working to change the
Forest Service mandate to focus on
conservation rather than resource
development and intensive recreation.
This approach offers great promise, but
it is a long-term effort. There are other
options that may offer a better chance
of providing permanent protection in
the near-term. The section below ranks
these options from the most protected
to the least protected:

National Forest Wilderness
One option that offers permanent pro-
tection is to designate important
national forest lands as wilderness.
There are currently 406 national forest
wilderness areas totaling almost 35 mil-
lion acres. As with all wilderness desig-
nations, creating new national forest
wilderness requires an act of Congress.
Unfortunately, most national forest
lands do not meet Wilderness Act crite-
ria for designation. Moreover, national
forest wilderness areas often permit
commercial livestock grazing, a use
that degrades wilderness values.

National Wild and Scenic Rivers
Designation under the Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act offers another layer of pro-
tection for rivers in national forests.
Wild rivers can preserve primitive river

corridors with little, if any, extraction
and development. Unfortunately, the
Forest Service often permits damaging
activities, such as logging, livestock
grazing and off-road vehicle use within
the scenic and recreational river corri-
dors. Still, Wild and Scenic Rivers pre-
vent new dams and water diversions
and offer the potential for better pro-
tection than conventional national for-
est lands.

National Scenic Areas
National scenic areas are not as pro-
tected as wilderness areas or National
Park System units. However, they
receive significantly stronger protec-
tion than standard national forest
management. National scenic areas are
designated through congressional leg-
islation, which provides direction on
the level of protection. Most national
forest scenic areas allow some level of
logging, livestock grazing and other
industrial activities to continue.

National Monuments
There are only a handful of national
monuments on national forest lands.
They can be created under the
Antiquities Act of 1906 or through con-
gressional legislation. National forest
monuments are not as well protected
as those administered by the National
Park Service. Most of them allow some
level of logging, livestock grazing and
other industrial activities to continue.

National Recreation Areas
National recreation areas (NRAs) are an
improvement over general national
forest management, but they are much
less protected than National Park
System NRAs. For example, most allow
logging, livestock grazing, road-build-
ing and intensive motorized recreation.
The creation of a national recreation
area requires an act of Congress.

Issues to Consider
Special management areas such as Wild
and Scenic Rivers, national scenic areas,
national monuments and national
recreation areas offer an increased
level of protection from standard

national forest management. However,
they still allow a number of damaging
land uses. If the goal is preservation of
lands free from resource extraction and
intensive recreational uses, the best
options are designation of wilderness
areas or the transfer of key areas to
the National Park System.

BUREAU OF LAND
MANAGEMENT LANDS

Background
The Bureau of Land Management
administers 267 million acres, including
55 million acres of forest land. This
comprises approximately one-eighth of
the United States’ land base. The
agency also administers 300 million
additional acres of subsurface mineral
resources.

Bureau of Land Management
Protection Options
Conservationists have used a number
of strategies to preserve key tracts of
Bureau of Land Management land in
recent years. The section below discuss-
es these options, ranked from the most
to the least protective:

Bureau of Land Management
Wilderness
One option that offers permanent pro-
tection is to designate important BLM
lands as wilderness. The BLM currently
manages 161 wilderness areas encom-
passing 6.5 million acres.
Unfortunately, most BLM lands do not
meet Wilderness Act criteria for desig-
nation.

National Wild and Scenic Rivers
Designation under the Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act offers another layer of pro-
tection for rivers on Bureau of Land
Management lands. Thirty-eight rivers
or river sections are currently managed
by the BLM as part of the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The BLM
often permits damaging activities, such
as livestock grazing, within the scenic
and recreational river “corridors” but
this designation does prevent new
dams and water diversions.

National Conservation Areas
The Bureau of Land Management
administers 13 national conservation
areas encompassing 14 million acres.
National conservation areas are created
through an act of Congress, but their
actual level of protection depends in
large part on the BLM management
plan for each area and how well the
agency implements the plan. Many
national conservation areas continue to
be threatened by road-building, oil and
gas drilling, mining, intensive motor-
ized recreation and off-road vehicle
use.

National Monuments
There are 15 national monuments
totaling 4.7 million acres administered
by the Bureau of Land Management.
Unfortunately, these monuments gen-
erally allow commercial resource
extraction and other industrial uses.
Unlike national monuments under
National Park Service administration,
BLM monuments do not have specific
congressional legislation to direct their
protection.

Issues to Consider
In 2000, the National Landscape
Conservation System was created to
help ensure protection of these BLM
special management areas. To date, this
vision has not been realized. The
Bureau of Land Management remains
as firmly committed to industrial devel-
opment as the Forest Service. For the
foreseeable future, the only BLM lands
that can be considered fully protected
are those designated under the
Wilderness Act or transferred to the
National Park System. However, the cre-
ation of new Wild and Scenic Rivers,
national conservation areas and nation-
al monuments is still an important tool
that provides stronger protection than
standard BLM administration.
