Located in the Western Province of Papua New
Guinea, where much of the country’s intact
rainforest remains, the Kiunga-Aiambak ‘road’
goes right into the heart of some of the most
remote and biodiverse forest in the world

“Because of the many problems that
have been caused by Concord Pacific,
we do not want any logging activity.
We lose our forest and wildlife,
including animals, birds, insects …”
Lawrence Simeti, Aiambak landowner

Executive summary

The Paradise Forests of Papua New Guinea are among the
largest and most biologically diverse ancient forests left in
the world. The future of these forests, and of the people who
depend  upon  them,  is  currently  at  the  mercy  of  an
international  market  whose  voracious  appetite  for  cheap
timber,  furniture  and  flooring  is  driving  ancient  forest
destruction. This market, led in Papua New Guinea’s case by
China’s  huge  demand  for  raw  material  for  furniture
manufacture,  turns  a  blind  eye  to  the  human  and
environmental  devastation  it  is  causing.  Many  of  the
transnational  logging  companies  that  currently  dominate
Papua New Guinea’s forestry industry have moved to these
forests  after  depleting  rich  forests  nearer  to  home.  They
come  with  appalling  corporate,  environmental  and  social
records. Unsurprisingly, their record to date in Papua New
Guinea  is  no  better:  promises  to  local  communities  are
broken while the forest around them is destroyed and good
governance
the
scandalous Kiunga-Aiambak Road Project as one example of
what is going wrong in Papua New Guinea’s forests. It also
provides  a  lens  through  which  to  examine  the  impact  on
those forests of the international trade in furniture, flooring,
cheap plywood and other wood products.

• Rogue industry: the controversial Kiunga-Aiambak ‘Road Project’ has in practice been nothing but a ploy
for  a  Malaysian-owned  logging  company  to  access  thousands  of  hectares  of  Papua  New  Guinea’s
rainforest.

• Politics of self-interest: the project – which has been unlawful from the very beginning – has been built on
relationships between a number of high-ranking Papua New Guinean officials and Malaysian-born Philip
Lee, Concord Pacific general manager.

• Ancient forest destruction: the seven-year project has had extensive and well-documented environ-
mental, economic and social consequences, including the loss of the forest resource itself, the devastation
of traditional food sources and the non-payment of millions of kina in revenue owed to local landowners.
• International market demand: the Kiunga-Aiambak Road Project is just one example of everything that is
wrong  with  Papua  New  Guinea’s  forestry  sector  –  one  that,  like  the  rest  of  the  industry,  is  driven  by
demand from the international market for cheap timber. Despite all the evidence of the scandalous nature
of the logging industry in Papua New Guinea, countries such as Australia and China are expanding imports
of Papua New Guinea forest products.

• Opportunity  for  change:  given  determined  community  and  national  leadership  together  with
international  support,  local  initiatives  and  larger-scale  ecologically  responsible  forest  use  could  work
together to reform Papua New Guinea’s defective forestry industry.

The 2002 Ancient Forest Summit and beyond

The Kiunga-Aiambak Road Project is just the tip of the iceberg. It is but one of countless examples of the
failure of the world’s governments to ensure the protection of the Paradise Forests, and of ancient forests
around the world. Yet Greenpeace believes there is still room for hope. This year, at a series of key meetings
including the Ancient Forest Summit at The Hague in April and the Johannesburg Earth Summit in August,
world governments will meet to determine the fate of the planet’s remaining ancients forests and the people,
plants and animals they support. Whether the governments act to stamp out the trade that drives illegal and
destructive logging in Papua New Guinea will be but one test of their ability to move beyond rhetoric and into
the realm of action. Governments and the people that elect them need to listen to the voices of villagers of
Kiunga-Aiambak and other areas hurt by logging. Governments must act to stop the destruction, clean up the
timber trade and fund the protection of the world’s ancient forests.

Introduction

The  world’s  ancient  forests  are  in  crisis.  Only  20%  of  the
earth’s original forest cover remains as large intact areas and
more than a third of these are under threat – with industrial-
scale  logging  posing  the  single  largest  menace  to  their
survival.1

Logs from the Malaysian-owned company Concord Pacific
exported from Papua New Guinea to China

The ancient forest of Papua New Guinea – the world’s third-
largest tropical rainforest2 – is no exception, threatened by a
logging sector characterised by illegality, social conflict and
local economic failure. This sector, dominated by just a few
large operators, jeopardises the livelihoods of thousands of
forest-dependent communities and destroys habitat critical to countless species of plants and animals. It
also costs the Papua New Guinea government millions of dollars each year in lost revenue through widespread
transfer pricing, misreporting of log volumes and species, and other forms of tax evasion and theft.3

The industry is driven by a complacent international marketplace: consuming nations worldwide, eager to
fulfil  a  relentless  demand  for  wood  and  paper,  turn  a  blind  eye  to  the  social,  environmental  and  legal
problems that characterise Papua New Guinea’s forestry sector.

One  clear  example  of  everything  that  is  wrong  with  the  logging  industry  in  Papua  New  Guinea  is  the
Kiunga-Aiambak Road Project, located in the Western Province, in the heart of the country’s largest tracts
of ancient rainforest. This area is legally owned by the local forest-dwelling people and has a population
density  of  less  than  three  persons  per  square  kilometre.4 Purported  to  be  a  ‘development  project’  to
further the region’s economy, the project – driven by the Malaysian-owned logging company Concord
Pacific  (controlled  by  Datuk  Yaw  of  Samling)5 and  justified  by  them  in  terms  of  “improving
communications” and “benefits to people”6– is in practice nothing more than a licence to log on a large
and uncontrolled scale, with no regard for even basic environmental or forest management standards.
Over the last seven years the so-called road-building project has yielded over 600,000m3 of logs with a
declared export value of more than US$60 million.7 These logs are exported mainly to Japan and China,
from where they may well be re-exported as processed products to the US, Europe and around the world.8

The third-largest area of intact tropical forest on earth, the beautiful rainforests of Papua New Guinea support at least 5% of our planet’s
species as well as providing a home and history for more than four million people

Papua New Guinean customary landowners get together after a workshop with NGOs to discuss their constitutional rights,
responsibilities and ‘integral human development’

After seven years of logging, however, there is no functional road. Moreover, the logging looks set not only
to continue, but also to expand even deeper into the heart of Papua New Guinea’s ancient forests.

Nevertheless, Greenpeace, along with Papua New Guinean non-governmental organisations such as the
Centre for Environmental Law and Community Rights and the Papua New Guinea Eco-Forestry Forum,
believes that there is still hope for Papua New Guinea’s magnificent forests. The controversial Kiunga-
Aiambak project should be a test case for Papua New Guinea and the international community; a case that
can  demonstrate  whether  world  leaders  are  serious  about  stopping  the  wholesale  destruction  of  the
Earth’s remaining ancient forests.

It  is  well  within  the  power  of  the  Papua  New  Guinea  government,  together  with  the  international
community and all of us as consumers, to halt the rampant destruction of this ancient forest and bring an
end to the abuse of the country’s forest-dependent peoples, the destabilisation of Papua New Guinea’s
governance and economy, and the logging industry’s flagrant disregard for the law.

The Kiunga-Aiambak Road Project is a highly controversial and destructive logging operation located in
previously intact rainforests in Papua New Guinea’s remote Western Province. It was originally presented
as a ‘development project’ to further the region’s economy, but it soon became clear that it was no such
thing. In fact, it was nothing but a ploy for a Malaysian-owned logging company to gain access to valuable
timber stocks legally owned by Papua New Guinea’s indigenous forest-dwelling communities.

“Generally this project is
seen as a thinly disguised
method employed by a
logging company to gain
access to logs for export.”
Independent Review Team,9 October 2001

Initiated in 1995, the Kiunga-Aiambak project – which has destroyed thousands
of hectares of pristine forest over the last seven years – appears to have been
unlawful from the very beginning. In 1995, the then Forest Minister for Papua
New Guinea, Tim Neville, issued a permit known as a Timber Authority to a
company  called  Paiso  Ltd,  which  professed  to  be  a  ‘landowner  company’
representing  the  local  landowners  in  the  region.  The  Timber  Authority  is  a
legal instrument that allows its holder to fell trees 40m on either side of a
centre-line to clear a way for road construction: in theory it was a licence for
Paiso Ltd to construct a road between the small township of Kiunga and the
village of Aiambak.

In practice, however, the story was very different. Paiso Ltd was not a company owned by or representing
local landowners. In fact, just two people owned it: Malaysian-born Philip Lee, general manager and major
shareholder of Concord Pacific, and a Papua New Guinean called David Kaya.10 Moreover, Paiso Ltd itself
had no intention of logging or of building a road. It was a company in name only, with a paid-up share
capital of just 20 kina (about US$5). The company immediately subcontracted the ‘construction work’ to
Concord Pacific, despite the clear prohibition in the Papua New Guinea Forest Act against transferring
rights under a Timber Authority.

It soon became clear that the proposed ‘road project’ was simply a pretext for a much larger logging
operation.  Within  a  few  months,  Concord  Pacific  obtained  permission  from  Minister  for  Forests  Titus
Philemon (and later from his successor Fabian Pok) for an unlawful and unlimited extension of the project
until “successful completion”.11

The actual construction of the ‘road’ began at Aiambak in May 1995. By March
2001, around 179km of forest had been cleared northwards towards Kiunga. But
there is not – and never has been – a functional highway. The ‘road’ is nothing but a
bulldozer  track  through  the  forest.  It  has  no  permanent  bridges,  hopelessly
inadequate drainage and no surfacing – only a network of temporary logging roads
pushing deeper into the forest on either side. Already the Aiambak end of the road
is impassable, with another 60km to go before reaching Kiunga.12 Moreover, and
as is typical in Papua New Guinea’s forestry sector, no prior informed consent
from the rightful landowners of the resources was obtained for the project, and
minimal royalties or benefits have been provided to them.

“At no time since the
purported issuance of the
Timber Authority (logging
permit) has any aspect of
due process been
observed.”
Independent Review Team, October 2001

Astonishingly, Concord Pacific has somehow managed to secure a far-reaching court injunction, which is
restraining the Papua New Guinea Forest Authority (PNGFA) from closing the illicit project down. It also
prohibits the PNGFA from seizing logs or delaying export permits, even though the timber is being illegally
extracted. To date, the government has made no attempt to overturn the injunction or even to challenge
the substantive issues of the case.

Despite Concord Pacific’s claimed goal of “improving communication”, the road is already impassable in many areas

Justice Thomas Barnett, 1987

Over the last seven years, the extensive environmental, economic and social
consequences  of  the  Kiunga-Aiambak  project  have  been  well  documented.
Papua  New  Guinea’s  Centre  for  Environmental  Law  and  Community  Rights,
representatives  from  local  communities  and  the  Independent  Review  Team
(see  page  10)  have  all  given  accounts  of  the  nature  and  extent  of  these
impacts. These include the loss of the forest resource itself, the loss to local
communities of millions of kina14 in potential revenue due the unlawful removal
of logs, the increased scarcity of game animals traditionally hunted for food,
and  the  loss  of  clean  water  supplies,  traditional  building  materials  and
medicines.  All  these  factors  lead  to  conflict  and  cultural  and  social
breakdown.15

Impacts on the forest

Papua New Guinea’s forests have a plant diversity among the highest in
the world, with over 15,000 species, including the greatest diversity of
orchids on earth

The tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea range from mangrove, coastal and swamp forests in the
lowlands to monsoon and deciduous forests in the drier, more mountainous regions. In the lowland region
of the Kiunga-Aiambak project the forests are primarily evergreen, and like other ancient forests around
the  world  they  shelter  unusually  high  biodiversity,  including  many  plants  and  animals  that  are  found
nowhere else. These forests also fulfil essential environmental functions, controlling rainfall, maintaining
water supplies and stabilising soils.

The consequences of damaging or destroying these forests can therefore include loss of rare species,
changes in rainfall patterns and the occurrence of ‘natural’ disasters such as floods and landslides. In the
region of the Kiunga-Aiambak project, local people have already reported losses of wildlife – including
important sources of protein on which local people have depended for generations.16

Impacts on local communities

Representatives from local communities have described the
destructive  and  dangerous  activities  of  Concord  Pacific,
complaining that the company “came in to destroy, not to
bring  revenue  to  the  people”.17 The  report  by  the
Independent  Review  Team  confirms  these  complaints  and
adds  that  some  landowners  were  deliberately  misled  from
the very beginning of the project, while others were simply
not consulted.

The area of forest affected by the Kiunga-Aiambak project
supports the culture and livelihoods of the forest-dwelling
communities who are the region’s legal landowners. These
people  depend  on  the  forest  for  food,  medicines,  building
materials  and  clean  water  as  well  as  for  their  cultural  and
spiritual  life.  The  activities  of  Concord  Pacific  and  the
damage  that  has  been  done  to  the  forest  have  had  a
substantial  impact  on  these  communities.  They  are  the
victims not only of broken promises and the theft of their
logs,  but  also  of  threats  to  their  food  security,  rising  ill-
health, harsher living conditions, failed safety standards and
abuses of basic human rights.

“Some workers went blind because of dust from chainsaws in their eyes and
because no safety goggles were issued. Others were wounded by falling
branches because no helmets were issued. Some were even killed. But no
compensation was paid.”

Looking ahead

Despite Concord Pacific’s documented record of deceit, fraud, trespass, environmental destruction and
human rights abuses,18 the project not only continues unabated, but could actually be set to expand. In May
2000  Concord  Pacific  prepared  a  new  submission  to  the  Papua  New  Guinea  Government  seeking
permission to build a further 875km of ‘roads’ over the next 15 years. This proposal would cut a swathe of
destruction  from  Kiunga  to  the  Central  Highlands,  opening  vast  new  tracts  of  pristine  forest  to
irresponsible logging and subsequent cultural and environmental degradation. The new proposal is based
on a totally flawed assessment of the development value of the present logging operation. It has involved
no consultation with local landowners and does not have their informed consent.19

“The people were tricked
… the road has brought no
real and good changes.
Life has worsened. In the
past animals and food
were plentiful. Now they
have decreased
dramatically, and the
water is very dirty.”

Partners in crime:

international markets,
poor forest management and the
politics of self-interest

In a landscape dominated by powerful Malaysian-owned companies and financed
by  the  international  demand  for  cheap  tropical  timber,  Papua  New  Guinea’s
defective  forestry  sector  is  driven  by  the  behaviour  of  self-interested  timber
barons,  propped  up  by  corrupt  governmental  interests.  Published  accounts  of
widespread unlawful logging and trade in illegally extracted logs abound.20

The forestry sector and “pervasive forest crime”

A  key  underlying  factor  which  has  allowed,  and  continues  to  allow,  disastrous
projects  like  the  Kiunga-Aiambak  ‘road’  to  occur  is  the  state  of  Papua  New
Guinea’s forestry industry.

In 1988-1989 Justice Thomas Barnett21 led the country’s seminal ‘Commission of
Inquiry into Aspects of the Timber Industry in Papua New Guinea’, prompted by
the widespread corruption and scandal arising from the industry. After two years
of  close  study,  Barnett  produced  a  definitive  report  documenting  “pervasive
forest crime” ranging from the granting of illegal permits to companies to massive
transfer pricing and other forms of tax evasion.

Forest Minister and Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Ogio has pushed through tax breaks for
Concord Pacific’s Kiunga-Aiambak Project on two
occasions while the Prime Minister was overseas
– both tax breaks were later overturned

“Logging companies are
the worst offenders for
corruption. Some of the
managing directors of
these companies have a
direct line to our national
leaders, while I as a senior
minister had problems
reaching them.”

Jerry Nalau, Labour and Employment
Minister, in his 1995 resignation speech

Unlawful and destructive logging and forest
conversion is the main threat to these forests – it
has been recorded that for every tree that is
removed up to 45 more are destroyed

Papua New Guinea’s Logging Code of Practice mandates that only trees
above 50cm may be cut, but violations of this and other rules are
commonplace in the country’s forestry sector

After Barnett – problems and possibilities 22

“Governance has been particularly poor in the area of forestry, with the side effect of promoting corrupt
practices  and  undermining  environmental  sustainability  in  logging  activities.  The  Government  is
committed to introducing a moratorium on all new forestry licenses, extensions and conversions, and to
proceed with a review of all existing licenses, to ensure that proper procedures are followed, that logging
practices are not carried out in an unsustainable way, and that landowners get their share of fair benefits
from resource use.”

Sir Mekere Morauta, Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea23

In 1999 Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister, Sir Mekere Morauta, announced a moratorium on new logging
concessions  as  a  measure  to  address  the  continuing  chaos  and  corruption  in  the  forestry  sector.  His
cabinet also authorised a review of proposed new logging projects. The review was carried out by an
Independent Review Team,24 commissioned by the World Bank and funded by the Australian Agency for
International Development, Ausaid.

By the time the Independent Review Team finished its work in 2001, it had exposed many examples of
illegality,  fraud  and  mismanagement  throughout  the  32  logging  concessions  it  investigated.  While  the
review team reported that the Kiunga-Aiambak project was the worst example of these – “a disaster from
day one” – it was certainly not an isolated case. The review team found:
• breaches  of  the  law  and/or  failure  to  follow  procedure  in  the  processing  of  all  32  concessions

investigated;

• inadequate involvement of local landowners in decision-making, or even their complete exclusion;
• incompetence at almost every level of the Papua New Guinea Forest Authority;
• significant logging areas within Fragile Forest;25
• more  than  a  third  of  the  operations  to  be  fundamentally  illegal  in  that  they  were  not  included

in the country’s official National Forest Plan;

• 22 of the 32 proposed projects have insufficient timber to be viable or provide sustainable yields.

While the review team’s recommendations are aimed at addressing problems in the forestry sector, they
have no legal weight and fall short of what is needed to tackle the myriad of abuses endemic in the sector.
The government has made commitments to implement the review’s recommendations. However a further
shift  in  political  will  and  key  actions  by  the  international  community  and  marketplace  are  needed  to
achieve forest conservation and ecologically and socially responsible forest use.

Following the publication of the Barnett Report, throughout the 1990s and up until the present, the Papua
New Guinea Government has worked with the support of the World Bank and the international community
to develop a series of new laws, regulations and measures. Its goals have been to capture equitable rents,
to  ensure  sustainable  yields  and  to  conserve  this  valuable  forest  resource  for  current  and  future
generations of the communities to whom the lands belong. But in practice the impact of these measures
has been insufficient, as logging companies like Concord Pacific have found new ways to avoid complying
with the regulations and to gain unlawful and uncontrolled access to the country’s valuable timber supply.
Demonstrating courageous leadership, Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister responded to this situation in
1999 by declaring a moratorium and initiating an independent review of new logging projects. This review
revealed that little has changed since Barnett’s Commission of Inquiry. But hope remains, as long as there
is continued action towards genuine reform.

Datuk Yaw Teck Seng – the man behind the destruction

Concord  Pacific’s  Director  and  controlling  shareholder  (60%)  is
Datuk  Yaw  Teck  Seng,  the  Chinese-Malaysian  timber  tycoon  who
founded the multinational Samling Corporation 30 years ago. Datuk
Yaw and his Samling companies now control around 1.5 million ha
of forest in Sarawak (Malaysia) and have additional forest lands in
Guyana  and  Cambodia.  Samling’s  logging  operations  in  Sarawak
have  caused  massive  environmental  damage  as  well  as  serious
social and economic problems for the Penan communities whose
traditional  livelihoods  are  almost  totally  dependent  on  forest
products.26

Datuk Yaw Teck Seng

Beyond the law –
key corporate and government players

There are a number of individuals – within logging companies and within the Papua
New Guinea government – who let personal interests override their professional
responsibilities when it comes to making decisions of national importance.27 This
situation  is  further  exacerbated  by  the  inaction  of  other  government  officials
whose jobs would be threatened if they were to challenge the status quo.

In  the  case  of  the  Kiunga-Aiambak  project  itself,  this  group  of  high-ranking
individuals  has  included  four  Ministers  for  Forests,  a  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  a
Minister for Commerce and an Attorney General, as well as a representative of
Concord Pacific.28

“Some of the [logging]
companies… are now
roaming the countryside
with the assurance of
robber barons; bribing
politicians and leaders,
creating social
disharmony and ignoring
laws…”
Justice Thomas Barnett, 1987

The close relationship between Concord Pacific associates
and Papua New Guinea politicians is clearly illustrated by an
episode  in  August  2001.  Having  been  found  to  hold  five
different  passports  –  three  of  which  were  Papua  New
Guinean – Concord Pacific’s Malaysian-born general manager
and  major  shareholder  Mr  Philip  Lee  was  deported  from
Papua  New  Guinea  for  holding  illegal  passports.29 The
Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  John  Pudari,  who  bravely
ordered Mr Lee’s deportation, has since been sacked.30 His
successor, John Waiko, who admitted he had shares in the
same company as Lee, had the deportation order reviewed.31

the international marketplace

Perhaps  the  most  potent  component  of  the  scandal  –  and  a  key  driver  in  perpetuating  this  corrupt,
destructive  and  unscrupulous  approach  to  timber  extraction  –  is  the  demand  from  the  international
marketplace:
• the demand from importing nations around the world who turn a blind eye to the industry’s problems

in their eagerness to maintain cheap supplies of tropical timber;

• the  demand  from  corporate  and  individual  consumers who  buy  plywood  and  furniture  with  no
thought for the massive destruction and human misery that the trade in these products causes in one of
the world’s last remaining ancient forests.

Indeed, despite all the evidence of the scandalous state of Papua New Guinea’s forestry sector, some
countries not only continue their imports but actually look set to increase them, while lending tacit support
to the current illegal practices by adopting a ‘business as usual’ approach. For example, the Australian
Trade Commission recently offered to organise a forestry trade fair in the Papua New Guinean capital Port
Moresby, to run alongside a Papua New Guinea Forest Industry Association seminar promoting overseas
investment  and  the  development  of  new  markets  –  a  missed  opportunity  to  insist  on  the  sort  of  far-
reaching industry reforms advocated by Australia’s own overseas aid agency Ausaid.32

The vast majority of Papua New Guinea’s valuable timber is exported as low-value raw logs.33 This means
that in addition to suffering the effects of the destructive and unsustainable manner in which the wood is
obtained, the country misses out on the economic benefits brought by value-added timber processing
industries. In 2001 the major market for these logs was China and Hong Kong (49%) followed by Japan
(28%) and Korea (16%).34 Another significant export market is Australia, which imports the bulk of Papua
New  Guinea’s  sawn  timber.  Although  accounting  for  less  than  2%  of  exports  by  volume,  sawn  wood
generates almost one-tenth of exports in terms of value.35

The main markets for Papua New Guinea logs are China and Hong Kong, followed by Japan and Korea; driving log imports to China is a
rapidly growing export market for Chinese furniture to markets in the USA, Hong Kong, Japan and the EU

Timber  species  from  Papua  New  Guinea,  including  those
logged by Concord Pacific, are extensively employed in the
production of furniture, flooring and cheap plywood, often
used only once – as concrete mouldings on construction sites
–  before  it  is  thrown  away.  Many  higher-value  processed
products are manufactured in China and then exported to the
US and Europe.36

Companies  known  to  be  trading  directly  with  Concord
Pacific  are  the  Japanese  trading  firms  Nissho  Iwai  and
Marubeni Corporation, and the Chinese importers Lei Shing
Heng Ltd, Kam Hing Trading and Wayne Wood (HK) Ltd. Any
trader or manufacturer buying from these companies should therefore be aware that they could also be
buying from Concord Pacific. In addition, any company – or country – importing plywood, furniture or other
products  from  China  should  note  that  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  products  have  not  come  from
companies engaged in unlawful and destructive activities unless the products they buy are certified at least
to the standards required by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).37

Joe Lukas, former community educator, Manda village

“We asked for housing, water supply, health and education. Our
expectation was that our demand would be carried out. But up to this day
we haven’t seen any development from [Concord Pacific] of any sort.”

Concord  Pacific ,  China  and  the  rest
of the world

Until  1994,  China  imported  around  60,000m3 of  logs  and
timber  annually  from  Papua  New  Guinea;  by  2000  it  was
importing around 740,000m3 – a twelve-fold increase over six
years. Driving this huge increase in consumption have been
two  significant  factors  –  the  introduction  of  new  forestry
laws  in  China  and  an  increase  in  worldwide  demand  for
Chinese furniture.

Gang; Calophyllum is mainly used in the production of plywood and furniture,
both of which are extensively exported to the US, Europe and Japan

In  1998,  China  introduced  a  new  forestry  law  banning  logging  in  the  remaining  natural  forests  of  the
country’s western provinces. This legislation was brought in essentially to protect the upper reaches of its
main rivers after logging was identified as the principal cause of the huge floods the country suffered that
year.

At the same time, China has recently seen a rapid growth in its furniture sector, which is currently worth
over US$12 billion a year. Dominated by foreign joint-venture companies, the export trade for this furniture
is estimated to be worth more than a third of that total, with major markets in the US (55%), Hong Kong
(15%), Japan (10%) and the EU (11.8%).38 One of the main regions for furniture production within China is
around Shanghai, where manufacturers are provided with easy access to the largest log port in China –
Zhang Jia Gang. It is here that the majority of logs exported from Papua New Guinea to China are destined
to go; it is also the main export destination for Concord Pacific’s Papua New Guinean logs.39

Community Eco-Forestry Team at the end of a long day,
West New Britain, Papua New Guinea – eco-forestry is a growing
enterprise in Papua New Guinea

Despite the scandalous nature of projects such as the Kiunga-Aiambak ‘road’ and questions about Papua
New Guinea’s forestry sector as a whole, the country’s forest management is currently at something of a
crossroads.  On  the  one  hand  there  is  a  continuing  state  of  chaos  and  corruption  within  the  sector,
potentially  exacerbated  by  the  government’s  recent  lifting  of  its  earlier  moratorium  on  new  logging
concessions; on the other hand there is growing support for improving existing policies and practices and
expanding community-centred alternatives.40

The present government has developed a forest action plan, with specific timelines, to implement selected
recommendations of the Independent Review Team. It has also secured a package of grants and loans from
the World Bank to improve the forestry sector.41 At the same time, a growing number of communities are
rejecting large-scale destructive logging in order to develop their own alternatives and conserve their
natural resources.

There is an urgent need to build on this shift in domestic political will, and to secure support from the
international community – citizens, trading partners and governments – to follow the responsible path.

Towards just and sustainable forest use

Despite its problems, Papua New Guinea presents a unique opportunity to set a global example in effecting
such a turnaround. More than 95% of its area is privately held under customary ancestral land tenure,
which  is  upheld  by  the  country’s  constitution,  and  cannot  be  alienated  or  sold.  Moreover,  half  of  the
country’s ancient forests still remain unallocated in large tracts. The country also boasts a greater diversity
of  intact,  largely  self-reliant  subsistence  cultures  than  anywhere  on  earth,  a  relatively  independent
judiciary, a free press and some extraordinary and visionary
leaders. Given these circumstances there is a real chance to
develop an alternative future for Papua New Guinea – and to
achieve genuine community-centred forest conservation and
sustainable forest use. The result would be the protection of
more than 5% of the earth’s terrestrial species, along with
the  spearheading  of  innovative  and  effective  models  for
ecologically and socially responsible development.

Across Melanesia there are now many examples of community-centred initiatives that can both sustain the
environment and earn revenue. Ecotourism, the production of plant extracts and the sale of indigenous
arts  and  crafts  are  being  linked  with  customary  and  subsistence  activities  in  groundbreaking  ways.  In
addition, eco-forestry – a unique partnership between local communities, NGOs, ‘green’ consumers and
sometimes governments – has, in recent years, proved an appropriate and viable alternative to industrial-
scale forest exploitation.42 Indeed, economic studies in the neighbouring Solomon Islands have found that
the value to communities of small-scale enterprise and subsistence activities can be more than three times
that of industrial logging and oil palm plantations.43

To secure such a future it is necessary to break the political stalemate that blocks forest conservation and
reform.  With  determined  community  and  national  leadership,  and  with  international  support,
conservation, eco-forestry and other community initiatives can be combined with larger-scale socially and
ecologically responsible forest use.44 Together with land-use planning led by and involving informed local
communities, this approach could provide a real alternative both for Papua New Guinea’s forestry sector
and for the millions of people who own and depend on the country’s forests.

Future generations of Papua New Guineans require ecologically and socially responsible decisions from their leaders to ensure that the
heritage passed down from their ancestors remains in their hands

Greenpeace is calling on governments around the
world to end their role in driving this
unscrupulous industry

“Forest law cannot be
effectively enforced in the
absence of good
governance. Good
governance begins with
strong political will,
demonstrated by solid and
consistent commitment at
the highest level of
government.”
Mark Baird, World Bank, September 200145

In the run-up to the forthcoming Ancient Forest Summit,46 the Earth Summit II47
and beyond, Greenpeace is urging governments of all importing countries to
bring an immediate end to their role in the destruction of Papua New Guinea’s
ancient forests, by committing to the following actions:

• s t o p  t h e  d e s t r u c t i o n

by stopping any further industrial activities in intact ancient forest until
responsible plans for forest conservation and sustainable use have been
agreed.

• c l e a n  u p  t h e  t i m b e r  t r a d e

by ensuring that timber is produced and traded in a legal and ecologically
responsible  way;  by  refusing  to  trade  with  companies  known  to  be
operating illegally or destructively; and by demanding that all wood and
wood  products  entering  national  ports  must  come  from  legal  and  well-
managed forest operations with high social and ecological standards.48

• c o m e  u p  w i t h  t h e  m o n e y

by providing at least US$15 billion each year to pay for forest conservation
and sustainable development.

Greenpeace recommendations on the Kiunga-Aiambak project

Greenpeace is calling for action from consumers, trading partners and governments around the world to
end their role in driving the illegal and destructive activities of unscrupulous forestry companies. In the
case of Concord Pacific’s Kiunga-Aiambak logging project this requires:

• the Papua New Guinea Government to implement the Independent Review Team’s recommendation to
shut down the Kiunga-Aiambak project and seize the assets of Concord Pacific in order to reimburse
landowners for their losses;

• the Papua New Guinea Government to act on the Independent Review Team’s recommendation that any

application to extend the scope and term of the project should be roundly rejected;

• the Papua New Guinea Government and the international community to investigate fully and prosecute

those involved in the scandal;

• the  Papua  New  Guinea  Government  permanently  to  revoke  Concord  Pacific’s  status  as  a  ‘Forest

Industries Participant’;

• nations  around  the  world  to  prohibit  the  import  –  whether  direct  or  indirect  –  of  Concord  Pacific’s

products;

• Concord Pacific’s current trading partners to refuse to purchase any more of its products.

remaining forests which have been shaped largely by
natural events and which are little impacted by human
activities”. Logging is a threat to 72% of the world’s
threatened frontier forests, compared to 20% threatened
by agricultural clearance and 38% by mining and road-
building.

28 The current Minister for Forests and Deputy Prime Minister,
Michael Ogio, has twice granted improper tax concessions
to Concord Pacific. Papua New Guinea’s current Attorney
General Francis Damen obtained Concord Pacific’s
injunction against the PNGFA while acting as attorney for
the company when still in private practice. (Damen Lawyers
obtained the injunction on behalf of the first and second
plaintiffs, Concord Pacific and Paiso Ltd respectively.
Francis Damen of Damen Lawyers was the attorney who
represented the plaintiffs in court. Moreover, the
Independent Review Team (2001a) remarked, “It should be
noted that the Attorney General has previously acted in a
private capacity for the logging operator (Concord Pacific)
in relation to these proceedings.”) Former Minister for
Forests Tim Neville improperly gave out the original Timber
Authority No. 24 and Minister for Commerce Nakikkus
Konga improperly granted tax concessions to Concord
Pacific. (In both cases Prime Minister Sir Mekere Morauta
intervened to reverse these illicit tax breaks after strong

press condemnation.) Source: Post-Courier (2001b). Two
Ministers for Forests – Fabian Pok and Titus Philemon –
approved the original extension of Timber Authority No. 24.
(In a letter to Paiso Ltd dated 21 September 1997, Pok wrote,
“As directed, I hereby grant and approve the extension of
the validity of the Timber Authority TA 024 until the
completion of the road and allowable Timber Volume is
harvested.”) Concord Pacific’s application for a further
extension to log the 875km Trans-highland Highway was
endorsed and signed by Ministers Bart Phileman, Michael
Ogio, Alfred Pogo and Mao Zeming.
