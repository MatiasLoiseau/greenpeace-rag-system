What eco-certification means
Increasingly, customers of wood products around the
world are asking for guarantees that the products they buy — whether they are kitchen tables, paper products,or 2 x 4s — come from forests which are managed andlogged according to ecologically-responsible standards.This trend towards responsible consumerism is backed up by independent certification and labeling, in order to ensure the credibility of claims in the marketplace.
Certification is a process by which an independent 
audit is conducted of a forestry business to assesswhether it meets internationally recognized guidelines of responsible forest management that protect the ecological integrity of the forest and respect the rights of workers, local communities and indigenous peoples.Companies passing the certification assessment are eligible to have their products sold with an eco-logowhich tells customers that the product they are buyingcomes from a well-managed forest.Why eco-certification is needed
According to the World Resources Institute, 80 per centof the world’s ancient forests are already gone or areseverely degraded. Of what remains, logging, much of itfor international markets, has been identified as thebiggest single threat. If destruction of forests continues,scientists warn we will create a species extinction crisisthe likes of which have not been seen since the disap-pearance of the dinosaurs. Forests contain two-thirds ofall the world’s species. Increasingly, consumers want to becertain that their timber, paper imports and purchases donot contribute to ancient forest destruction nor theextinction of species.
Who’s demanding it?
Environmental concern and awareness about loggingpractices and forests burgeoned in the late ‘80s and consumers began pressuring retail chains to providethem with assurances that the wood they were purchas-ing did not contribute to forest destruction, not only inEco-Certification in the Forest Industry:

The ne ed for a cr edible,verifiable,independent forestry
certificat ion and lab eling sy stem so on became ap parent
when incr easing n umb ers ofsuppliers began pla cing
unsubstant iated and un-v erified claims ab out “sustain -
ability”on the ir wood and pap er products as a mar ket-
ing t ool.As no ind ependent int ernational forestry 
certificat ion and lab eling sy stem existed to turn to,the
Forest St ewardship C ouncil (FSC) was cr eated to fill the
institutional g ap.
The fir st Buyers Group in the w orld was f ormed in the
UK. The Buyers Group c onsisted ofretailers who w ere all
being ask ed for these e co-guar antees by the ir cust omers.
In 1994 the y band ed together and c ommitt ed to preferen-
tially buy wood products that ha d been certified by the
FSC. Today in the U nited Kingdom,the B uyers Group
consists o fapproximat ely 80 c ompanies w ith ann ual sales
ofwood products totaling almost $6-b illion Canadian.
In November 1997, the C ertified Forest P roducts Council
was launc hed in the U nited Stat es,representing 140 c or-
porate me mbers,including the T urner Corporation,the
nation’s leading g eneral builder,and H abitat f or
Humanit y,one ofthe larg est US ho me b uilders.Othergroups o fbuyers supporting the FSC sy stem ha ve now
been estab lished in the N etherlands, Belgium,Austria,
Switzerland, Germany,Brazil and J apan.
Who’ s doing it?
A numb er offorms o fcertificat ion exist. Some assess
companies ’internal manag ement sy stems,but tell little
about the e nvironme ntal p erformanc e ofthe c ompan y.
These ha ve low credibility in the mar ketplace with 
environme ntally concerned consume rs.The forestry
certificat ion system that has g ained the most cr edibility
in the int ernational mar ketplace,the F orest St ewardship
Council, assesses the e nvironme ntal p erformanc e of
the c ompan y,in the f orest,against the FSC’ s global 
performanc e standar ds.
The FSC is the o nly int ernational forestry certificat ion
and lab eling sy stem that d oes this, the p rincipal r eason
for its s uccess to dat e.The FSC’ s internationally recog-
nized guid elines f or responsible forest use w ere devel-
oped thr ough the c o-operative efforts ofprofessio nal
foresters,forestry companies, majo r consumers and
retailers,environme ntal and so cial o rganisat ions,indig e-
nous p eoples, community forestry groups and c ertifiers.
With such a b road-base d range ofstakeholders whose
values and c oncerns were given equal w eight in d evelop-
ing the FSC standar ds,international c onsumers ofwood
products ha ve incr easing ly been requesting that the w ood
products the y buy come w ith an FSC stamp o fapproval.
INTERN ATION ALHEADQ UARTERS OFTHE FSC
are base d in M exico,and nat ional and r egional FSC o ffices
exist in c ount ries ar ound the w orld,including C anada.The
FSC ap proach is base d on 10 P rinciples and C riteria for
forest manag ement that ha ve been developed and ag reed to
by the int ernational me mbership.
The FSC is ap propriately taking a p recautionary
approach towards certifying lo gging in ancie nt forests,
given that so m uch ofthe w orld’s ancie nt forests ar e
already gone.FSC’ s standing p olicy stat es only smal l-
scale lo gging o fancie nt forests should b e considered for
FSC c ertificat ion.Large-scale int ensive logging o pera-
tions in ancie nt forests, such as c learcutting,cannot
presently be certified und er the FSC. To do so w ould
require that the FSC c hang e its fundame ntal p rinciples
and cr iteria.To dat e,the FSC has c ertified over

10 mil lion hectares worldwide in t ropical, temperate
and b oreal forest regions.None ofthe f orests in the FSC
portfolio in volve clearcutting in ancie nt forests.
FSC a ccredited certifiers set relevant standar ds using
FSC ap proved procedures.Once regional standar ds ha ve
been developed and ap proved by the FSC, certifiers use
those. An FSC w orking g roup has b een set up in C anada
with regional s ub-g roups, including o ne in B ritish
Columb ia.The Silva Forest F oundat ion,a British
Columb ian o rganizat ion,is active in c ertificat ion and
ecological f orestry and is a me mber ofthe FSC.
It’s imp ortant that c ertificat ion be conducted by a b ody
that is o bjective and ind ependent in o rder to avoid con-
flicts ofinterest in the ou tcome.For this r eason,the
most r eliable and cr edible forms o fcertificat ion are con-
ducted by certifiers not dir ectly connected to the lo gging
industry,or to governme nt bodies that ma y derive
income fr om the lo gging.This is the ap proach followed
by the FSC.
Anothe r system has b een developed by the C anadian
Standar ds Association (CSA), through funding s upplied
by a coalition offorest compan y int erests hea ded by 
the C anadian P ulp and P aper Association.Unlike the
FSC mo del that audits and the n certifies o n-the-g round
logging p ractices,the CSA mo del audits the p rocesses 
by which a lo gging c ompan y mak es its d ecisio ns con-
cerning f orest manag ement.
While the tw o mo dels are extremely
different,logging c ompanies ha ve 
promoted the CSA mo del as thoug h it
does provide a guar antee ofresponsi-
ble on-the-g round lo gging,which is
clearly not the case. Concerned about
potential for mislea ding and c onfusing
CSA c laims in the mar ketplace about
Canadian f orestry practices,56 envi-
ronme ntal g roups, unio ns and Fir st
nations fr om across C anada expressed
grave reservations and o pposition to
the CSA p rocess.

First Nations and the mar ketplace is
that o fthe F orest St ewardship C ouncil.The FSC Challenge
For a lo gging c ompan y to have its o perations become
FSC c ertified,they must me et stringent environme ntal
and so cial standar ds.Logging p ractices m ust mo re
closely mimic nat ural dist urbanc es that o ccur in the
specific f orest ecosystem.
The Forest St ewardship C ouncil a dvocates that al l func -
tions ofa forest ecosystem remain inta ct after it is
logged.This requires that a mix o fdifferent tree species
ofdifferent ag es still remain standing aft er the f orest is
logged.In addition,the func tions that those t ree and
other plant sp ecies p rovide,such as hab itat o r food for
insects,birds and animals, also r emain inta ct.Large-
scale c learcutting e liminat es or irrevocably chang es the
forest st ructure and d ynamic.
Currently,the a verage size ofopening s created by log-
ging c ompanies in B .C.is ap proximat ely 26 he ctares and
is allowed to be up t o 40 he ctares — p erhaps e ven larg -
er,depending o n the discr etion ofthe M inistry of
Forests D istrict Manag er.This siz e opening is sig nifi-
cantl y larg er than that cr eated by a nat ural dist urbanc e.
Until B.C.companies imple ment radical and r eal
chang es to the ir practices on the g round, they will not
comply with FSC standar ds and w ill not b e certifiable.

GREENPEACE’S POSITION
The FSC is a me mbership o rganizat ion.Greenpeace
International is o nly one amo ng se veral hundr ed me m-
bers ofthe F orest St ewardship C ouncil, which also
includes so me larg e forestry companies amo ng its me m-
bers.Greenpeace supports the d evelopment ofcertifica-
tion and lab eling as a t ool to accelerate the imple menta-
tion ofecologically responsible forest manag ement by
mobilizing the p ower ofthe mar ketplace.
Greenpeace par ticipat es in the FSC sy stem in o rder to pro-
mote the d evelopment and ap plicat ion ofecologically
responsible FSC standar ds offorestry manag ement at al l
levels.Greenpeace Canada has b een involved in the FSC
process to develop standar ds for B.C.since this p rocess was initiated,and has a ctively supported certificat ion init iatives
in B.C.even prior to the a dvent ofthe lo cal FSC p rocess.
In November 1995, Greenpeace Canada supported the
launc h ofCanada’s very first eco-certified logging o pera-
tion,a certificat ion that was c onducted by B.C.’s Silva
Forest Foundat ion.The lo gging p rogram that a chieved
certificat ion was d eveloped by staff from the S mall
Business Ent erprise Program near Vernon,British
Columb ia using sing le-tree selection logging w ith smal l-
scale e quipment,emplo ying mo re people than b y me cha-
nized clearcutting o perations.After logging,70 per cent of
the forest remaine d standing .A global shift t o sustainab le
ecologically-base d forest manag ement is the b est wa y to
protect biological di versity and e ndang ered ecosystems.
