THE SANTARÉM FIVE & ILLEGAL
LOGGING
– A CASE STUDY
October 2001 – Marcelo Marquesini/Gavin Edwards – Greenpeace Amazon
In 1997 the Brazilian intelligence service SAE1 estimated that about 80% of the logging in the
Amazon is illegal in origin. For example companies operate on land that they do not legally
own or use documents generated from legal management plans to cover logs from Indian
lands where it is illegal to log. Latest figures from the Brazilian environmental agency IBAMA
for 2000 show that there is about 4.5 million m3 of wood authorised for logging under Forest
Management Plans (FMP’s) in the Amazon, yet the annual wood extracted from the region is
nearly 30 million m3 per year. Therefore despite various effforts to curb illegal logging,
approximately 85% of the logging is still illegal2.
Logging companies often make claims in the marketplace that they log sustainably, yet
deforestation (land clearing, where forest is replaced by other land uses such as cattlegrazing) continues in the Amazon and the trees from this clearing continue to supply the
global market. Meanwhile customers around the world are continually assured that the wood
they buy is from legal and sustainable sources. For example the UK Timber TradeFederation, in September 1993 signed an accord with AIMEX (the Para state timber exportersassociation) which committed local timber exporters to only export mahogany and cedar fromsustainable sources and in strict compliance with pertinent Brazilian legislation. Given the
high percentage of illegal logging it is clearly not possible for the vast majority of the wood
finding its way into the marketplace to be legal and sustainable.
This briefing investigates logging companies who are exporting the vast majority of wood from
the port of Santarém in Para State in the eastern Amazon, and presents the evidence that allare involved in illegal and sometimes destructive logging. In particular it focuses on five
companies that make up about 72% of the exports from Santarem – Cemex, Curuatinga,
Estância Alecrim, Madesa & Rancho de Cabocla in 2000.
Repeat Offenders – Santarém Companies Guilty of Illegal
Logging
In 1997 the Federal Prosecutor asked Greenpeace & IBAMA to investigate the 15 FMP’s for
nine logging companies in the Santarém region3 using data obtained from IBAMA, and
extensive ground-truthing by a Greenpeace research team. The report noted variousinconsistencies in the FMP’s, and 14 of the 15 plans were not being followed. For example
Cemex produced a forest managment plan after completely making up an inventory of the

amount of wood in a region, and then went on to ignore its plan by buildings roads that were
not detailed in the plan, or cutting more wood than the volume authorized by the plan.
After the report was released, the Federal Prosecutor investigated Cemex & Madesa and
found illegalities in their land titles. IBAMA investigated Rancho Da Cabocla & Curuatinga andalso found illegalities. IBAMA took the following action in 2001:
Cemex  - Three management plans, which amounted to 13,000ha in area, were cancelled.
4
Madesa  - Three management plans were suspended due to irregularities in their
management plan, and one more management plan was cancelled.5 The area amounted to
10,000ha.
Curuatinga  - One management plan was cancelled.6
Rancho Da Cabocla  – Two management plans suspended, and one management plan will
be cancelled.7
The companies produced a significant amount of wood from these plans in 2000 before the
plans were cancelled or suspended. Logging also continued anyway in some of the FMP’seven after their cancellation
Illegal & Unsustainable Logging
There are three main ways by which these logging companies obtain wood for milling andprocessing:
1, Forest Management Plans (FMP’s).
FMP’s are legal plans that allow for industrial logging in the Amazon. Since 1986, IBAMA hasbeen issuing thousands of these plans, which help provide assurances to consumers that theindustry is well regulated. However the plans themselves are often very weak, and frequentlyignored. For example a 1996 report by government
8 showed a number of non-compliances
with the law. It found that 93% of the FMP’s demonstrated no skid trails (where logs are
removed from the forest), even though the careful location of these trails is essential to avoid
damage to the forest and soil. A subsequent report by IBAMA9 revealed that just 31% of the
FMP’s were considered satisfactory. Forty percent of the plans were suspended and 22.6%were cancelled. Of the remaining plans, only 49% were deemed satisfactory by IBAMA. Evenwhen a FMP is going to be cancelled, there is no guarantee that logging activities will cease.For example in the case of Madevi, in 1997 an IBAMA agent explained to a Greenpeace
research team investigating illegal logging that he would cancel FMP number 3779/94
belonging to Madevi due to illegalities
10. Yet IBAMA documents in 2000 show that Madevi still
continue to log using this plan, and continue to submit relevant paperwork to IBAMA.
2, Deforestation.
Deforestation is defined as a logging operations where all the wood is removed from a given
area, and the land then converted to other uses such as for cattle grazing. The Santarém
companies continue to use wood derived from deforested areas even though more and moreconsumers around the world have made it clear that they do not want to buy wood thatoriginates from such an unsustainable practice. Part of the reason for this is that the woodfrom deforested areas is much less expensive. For example Cemex pays 5 Reals (US$1.85)

per m3 for logs from deforested areas (from the Moju Project) compared to 25 Reals
(US$9.25) per m3 for the same quality of wood from FMP’s.
3, Third Parties.
Wood obtained from third parties such as other saw mills or logging companies can be illegal
in numerous ways. For example some of the Santarém companies have been proven toobtain paperwork to legalize their wood from ‘ghost companies’ – companies that producepaperwork for wood that does not exist in order to cover illegally logged wood. These ‘ghost
companies’ are sawmills or wood traders who declare to IBAMA that a company has sold
wood and/or logs to them, and have documents that verify this, but the company who sold the wood and/or logs does not declare this to IBAMA. Therefore the wood never existed, and themill is generating the documents for the illegal wood that it never had in its possession. Forexample:
Step 1: Company A obtains documents from company B to legalize illegal wood. The
documents can come from legal and authorized logging operations, but where there is nologging (or even no wood).Step 2: Company A obtains the illegal wood.Step 3: Company A uses the legal documents to justify the illegal wood to IBAMAStep 4: Company B never declares to IBAMA that they supplied these documents/wood.
IBAMA does not cross check the documents to confirm that company B has declared that
they sold the wood.Step 5: Company A sells the sawn wood, which has now been legalized by the documentsfrom company B, to wood traders/exporters.
Year 2000 – Business As Usual
The following examples of illegal and destructive logging are based on data obtained from
IBAMA for year 2000:
Cemex (Cemex Comercial Mad. Ltda.)
Cemex officially exported 7,750 m3 of wood in 2000 and 2,370 m3 in Jan. to April 2001.
The origin of their wood in 2000 was:
17,600 cu.m from FMP’s. In 2000, Cemex sourced more than 50% of this from a FlonaTapajos (industrial logging concession). Cemex did not follow the FMP
11. The rest was
derived from illegal FMP’s that were cancelled by IBAMA12.
2,300 m3 from deforestation (land clearing).
567 m3 from other small saw mills. Two of the saw mills are ghost companies (Zeno Industrial
in 2000 & J.S. Madeplacas in 2001).13
Madesa (Madeireira Santarém Ltda.)
Madesa officially exported 7,600 m3 of wood in 2000 and 2,600 m3 in Jan. to April 2001.
The origin of their wood in 2000 was:
16,800 cu.m from a FMP. Madesa derived all of this from a FMP that was cancelled by
IBAMA in July 2001, as the plans were found to be based on logging of public lands, which is
illegal.14
zero from deforestation (land clearing).zero from other small saw mills
Curuatinga (Industrial Madeireira Curuatinga Ltda.)
Curuatinga officially exported 8,600 m3 of wood in 2000 and 5,300 m3 in Jan. to April 2001.
The origin of their wood in 2000 was:15,600 cu.m from five FMP’s operated by third party suppliers in the Porto de Móz region, and
one FMP operated directly by Curuatinga. Three FMP’s were suspended in April 2001 by

IBAMA.15 One of Curuatinga’s third party suppliers is the Porto de Móz saw mill, who buy
wood from local loggers. The sawmill was fined for being in possession of over 800 m3 of
wood worth $32,500US in March 2001. As recently as September 2001 they received another
fine in relation to illegal logging, for wood that had no legal documents.

Rancho da Cabocla officially exported 14,800 m3 in 2000 and 5,230 m3 in Jan. to April 2001.
The origin of their wood in 2000 was:
19,650cu.m from a mix of two FMP’s and seven deforestation authorisations.16
2,414 m3 from other small saw mills. Two of the saw mills are ‘ghost companies’ (Zeno

Global Demand for Wood is Fuelling the Chainsaws
Much of the wood produced in the Santarém region is exported, in particular to Europe. The
wood is handled by a variety of importers, the largest being DLH / Nordisk which accounts foralmost 13% of the exports from Sanatarém and sells the wood in Belgium, Denmark, China,
UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the USA. Species exported include
Ipé and Jatoba, and has a variety of uses such as hardwod flooring and decking.

The Solutions
Greenpeace Global Call for Action:
In order to halt the destruction of ancient forests worldwide, Greenpeace is calling on the 180
governments formally committed to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) for amoratorium on logging and other industrial activities in all the world’s remaining large areas ofancient forests, until representative protected area networks and areas of sustainable use are

fully established, and to create a global ancient forest fund of at least US$15 billion annually
to fund implementation of these measures.
Greenpeace calls to action to the Brazilian Government:
Moratorium:
• Greenpeace is calling for an immediate moratorium on all industrial logging in the
Middle Land until a full assessment of the ecological values of this area can becompleted and a credible land use plan developed and implemented.
Measures:
• IBAMA should permanently revoke all Forest Management Plans held by companies
found laundering illegal logs
• Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an eco-certification scheme that has global
acceptance in the marketplace. It employs a chain of custody scheme which tracks
wood from the forest to the consumer, so that the exact origin of the wood is known. It
also does not certify deforestation. As such, it is the best protection against illegal and
destructive logging, and Greenpeace is calling on all logging companies to becomeFSC certified within four years.
Money:
• Additional funding and resources should be made available to IBAMA so that they
can more effectively carry out their role of monitoring and enforcing Brazilian
environmental laws.
• Additional funding and resources should be allocated for improved tropical forest
research, environmental education, training of forest managers and development of
economic alternatives in local communities.
