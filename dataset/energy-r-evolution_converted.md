foreword

Of all the sectors of a
modern economic system,
the one that appears to be
getting the maximum
attention currently is the
energy sector. While the
recent increase in oil prices
certainly requires some
temporary measures to tide
over the problem of
increasing costs of oil
consumption particularly
for oil importing countries,
there are several reasons
why the focus must now
shift towards longer term
solutions. First and

foremost, of course, are
the growing uncertainties
related to oil imports both
in respect of quantities and
prices, but there are several
other factors that require a
totally new approach to
planning energy supply and
consumption in the future.
Perhaps, the most crucial
of these considerations is
the threat of global climate
change which has been
caused overwhelmingly in
recent decades by human
actions that have resulted
in the build up of
greenhouse gases (GHGs)
in the Earth’s atmosphere.

Impacts of climate change are diverse and serious, and unless the
emissions of GHGs are effectively mitigated these would threaten to
become far more serious over time. There is now, therefore, a renewed
interest in renewable sources of energy, because by creating and using
low carbon substitutes to fossil fuels, we may be able to reduce emissions
of GHGs significantly while at the same time ensuring economic growth
and development and the enhancement of human welfare across the
world. As it happens, there are major disparities in the levels of
consumption of energy across the world, with some countries using large
quantities per capita and others being deprived of any sources of modern
energy forms. Solutions in the future would, therefore, also have to come
to grips with the reality of lack of access to modern forms of energy for
hundreds of millions of people. For instance, there are 1.6 billion people
in the world who have no access to electricity. Households, in which these
people reside, therefore, lack a single electric bulb for lighting purposes,
and whatever substitutes they use provide inadequate lighting and
environmental pollution, since these include inefficient lighting devices
using various types of oil or the burning of candles.

Future policies can be guided by the consideration of different
scenarios that can be linked to specific developments. This publication
advocates the need for something in the nature of an energy
revolution. This is a view that is now shared by several people across
the world, and it is also expected that energy plans would be based on
a clear assessment of specific scenarios related to clearly identified
policy initiatives and technological developments. This edition of
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios provides a detailed analysis of the
energy efficiency potential and choices in the transport sector. The
material presented in this publication provides a useful basis for
considering specific policies and developments that would be of value
not only to the world but for different countries as they attempt to
meet the global challenge confronting them. The work carried out in
the following pages is comprehensive and rigorous, and even those
who may not agree with the analysis presented would, perhaps, benefit
from a deep study of the underlying assumptions that are linked with
specific energy scenarios for the future.

STEAM IN A STANDARD TURBINE GENERATOR.

Energy supply has become a subject of major universal concern.
High and volatile oil and gas prices, threats to a secure and stable
supply and not least climate change have all pushed it high up the
international agenda. In order to avoid dangerous climate change,
global CO2 emissions must peak no later than 2015 and rapidly
decrease after that. The technology to do this is available. The
renewables industry is ready for take off and opinion polls show
that the majority of people support this move. There are no real
technical obstacles in the way of an Energy [R]evolution, all that is
missing is political support. But we have no time to waste. To
achieve an emissions peak by 2015 and a net reduction afterwards,
we need to start rebuilding the energy sector now.

An overwhelming consensus of scientific opinion now agrees that
climate change is happening, is caused in large part by human
activities (such as burning fossil fuels), and if left unchecked will
have disastrous consequences. Furthermore, there is solid scientific
evidence that we should act now. This is reflected in the conclusions,
published in 2007, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), a UN institution of more than 1,000 scientists
providing advice to policy makers.

The effects of climate change have in fact already begun. In 2008,
the melting of the Arctic ice sheet almost matched the record set
on September 16, 2007. The fact that this has now happened two
years in a row reinforces the strong decreasing trend in the amount
of summertime ice observed over the past 30 years.

In fact, the additional costs for coal power generation alone from today
up to 2030 under the Reference Scenario could be as high as US$
15.9 billion: this would cover the entire investment needed in renewable
and cogeneration capacity to implement the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario. These renewable sources will produce energy without any
further fuel costs beyond 2030, while the costs for coal and gas will
continue to be a burden on national and global economies.

global energy scenario

The European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) and Greenpeace
International have produced this global energy scenario as a
practical blueprint for how to urgently meet CO2 reduction targets
and secure an affordable energy supply on the basis of steady
worldwide economic development. Both of these goals are possible
at the same time. The urgent need for change in the energy sector
means that this scenario is based only on proven and sustainable
technologies, such as renewable energy sources and efficient
decentralised cogeneration. It therefore excludes so-called ‘CO2-free
coal power plants’, which are not in fact CO2 free and would create
another burden in trying to store the gas under the surface of the
Earth with unknown consequences. For multiple safety and
environmental reasons, nuclear energy is also excluded.

Commissioned from the Department of Systems Analysis and
Technology Assessment (Institute of Technical Thermodynamics) at
the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), the report develops a global
sustainable energy pathway up to 2050. The future potential for
renewable energy sources has been assessed with input from all
sectors of the renewables industry around the world. The new
Energy [R]evolution Scenario also takes a closer look for the first
time at the transport sector, including future technologies and how
to implement energy efficiency.

The energy supply scenarios adopted in this report, which extend
beyond and enhance projections made by the International Energy
Agency, have been calculated using the MESAP/PlaNet simulation
model. The demand side projection has been developed by the
Ecofys consultancy to take into account the future potential for
energy efficiency measures. This study envisages an ambitious
development pathway for the exploitation of energy efficiency
potential, focused on current best practice as well as technologies
available in the future. The result is that under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, worldwide final energy demand can be
reduced by 38% in 2050 compared to the Reference Scenario.

In response to this threat, the Kyoto Protocol has committed its
signatories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from
their 1990 levels by 2008-2012. The Kyoto signatories are
currently negotiating the second phase of the agreement, covering
the period from 2013-2017. Time is quickly running out. Signatory
countries agreed a negotiating ‘mandate’, known as the Bali Action
Plan, which they must complete with a final agreement on the
second Kyoto commitment period by the end of 2009. By choosing
renewable energy and energy efficiency, developing countries can
virtually stabilise their CO2 emissions, whilst at the same time
increasing energy consumption through economic growth. OECD
countries, on the other hand, will have to reduce their emissions by
up to 80%. The Energy [R]evolution concept provides a practical
blueprint on how to put this into practice.

Renewable energy, combined with the smart use of energy, can
deliver at least half of the world’s energy needs by 2050. This
report, ‘Energy [R]evolution: A Sustainable World Energy Outlook’,
shows that it is economically beneficial to cut global CO2 emissions
by over 50% within the next 42 years. It also concludes that a
massive uptake of renewable energy sources is technically and
economically possible. Wind power alone could produce about 40
times more power than it does today, and total global renewable
energy generation could quadruple by then.

renewed energy [r]evolution

This is the second edition of the Energy [R]evolution. Since we
published the first edition in January 2007, we have experienced an
overwhelming wave of support from governments, the renewables
industry and non-governmental organisations. Since than we have
broken down the global regional scenarios into country specific
plans for Canada, the USA, Brazil, the European Community, Japan
and Australia, among many others.

More and more countries are seeing the environmental and
economic benefits provided by renewable energy. The Brent crude oil
price was at $55 per barrel when we launched the first Energy
[R]evolution report. Since than the price has only headed in one
direction - upwards! By mid-2008 it had reached a peak of over
$140 per barrel and has subsequently stabilised at around $100.
Other fuel prices have also shot up. Coal, gas and uranium have
doubled or even tripled in the same timeframe. By contrast, most
renewable energy sources don’t need any fuel. Once installed, they
deliver energy independently from the global energy markets and at
predictable prices. Every day that another community switches to
renewable energy is an independence day.

The Energy [R]evolution Scenario concludes that the restructuring
of the global electricity sector requires an investment of $14.7
trillion up to 2030. This compares with $11.3 trillion under the
Reference Scenario based on International Energy Agency
projections. While the average annual investment required to
implement the Energy [R]evolution Scenario would need just under
1% of global GDP, it would lower fuel costs by 25% - saving an
annual amount in the range of $750 billion.

the potential for renewable energy

implementing the energy [r]evolution

Business as usual is not an option for future generations. The
Reference Scenario based on the IEA’s ‘World Energy Outlook
2007’ projection would almost double global CO2 emissions by
2050 and the climate would heat up by well over 2°C. This would
have catastrophic consequences for the environment, the economy
and human society. In addition, it is worth remembering that the
former chief economist of the World Bank, Sir Nicholas Stern,
pointed out clearly in his landmark report that the countries which
invest in energy saving technologies and renewable energies today
will be the economic winners of tomorrow.

As Stern emphasised, inaction will be much more expensive in the
long run. We therefore call on all decision makers yet again to
make this vision a reality. The world cannot afford to stick to the
‘business as usual’ energy development path: relying on fossil fuels,
nuclear energy and other outdated technologies. Renewable energy
can and will play a leading role in our collective energy future. For
the sake of a sound environment, political stability and thriving
economies, now is the time to commit to a truly secure and
sustainable energy future – a future built on clean technologies,
economic development and the creation of millions of new jobs.

“by 2030 about half of global
electricity could come from
renewable energies.”

The good news is that the global market for renewables is booming.
Decades of technical progress have seen renewable energy
technologies such as wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels,
biomass power plants, solar thermal collectors and many others
move steadily into the mainstream. The global market for renewable
energy is growing dramatically; in 2007 its turnover was over
aUS$ 70 billion, almost twice as high as the previous year. The time
window for making the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy,
however, is still relatively short. Within the next decade many of the
existing power plants in the OECD countries will come to the end of
their technical lifetime and will need to be replaced. But a decision
taken to construct a coal or gas power plant today will result in the
production of CO2 emissions and dependency on the resource and its
future costs lasting until 2050.

The power industry and utilities need to take more responsibility
because today’s investment decisions will define the energy supply
of the next generation. We strongly believe that this should be the
‘solar generation’. Politicians from the industrialised world urgently
need to rethink their energy strategy, while the developing world
should learn from past mistakes and build economies on the strong
foundations of a sustainable energy supply.

Renewable energy could more than double its share of the world’s
energy supply - reaching up to 30% by 2030. All that is lacking is
the political will to promote its large scale deployment in all
sectors at a global level, coupled with far reaching energy efficiency
measures. By 2030 about half of global electricity could come from
renewable energies.

The future of renewable energy development will strongly depend
on political choices made by both individual governments and the
international community. At the same time strict technical
standards will ensure that only the most efficient fridges, heating
systems, computers and vehicles will be on sale. Consumers have a
right to buy products that don’t increase their energy bills and
won’t destroy the climate.

In this report we have also expanded the time horizon for the
Energy [R]evolution concept beyond 2050, to see when we could
phase out fossil fuels entirely. Once the pathway of this scenario has
been implemented, renewable energy could provide all global energy
needs by 2090. A more radical scenario – which takes the advanced
projections of the renewables industry into account – could even
phase out coal by 2050. Dangerous climate change might force us
to accelerate the development of renewables faster. We believe that
this would be possible, but to achieve it more resources must go
into research and development. Climate change and scarcity of
fossil fuel resources puts our world as we know it at risk; we must
start to think the unthinkable. To tap into the fast potential for
renewables and to phase out fossil fuels as soon as possible are
amongst the most pressing tasks for the next generation of
engineers and scientists.

climate threats and climate solutions

climate change and security of supply

Global climate change caused by the relentless build-up of
greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere is already disrupting
ecosystems, resulting in about 150,000 additional deaths each year.
An average global warming of 2°C threatens millions of people with
an increased risk of hunger, malaria, flooding and water shortages.
If rising temperatures are to be kept within acceptable limits then
we need to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This
makes both environmental and economic sense. The main
greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by using fossil
fuels for energy and transport.

Spurred by recent large increases in the price of oil, the issue of
security of supply is now at the top of the energy policy agenda.
One reason for these price increases is the fact that supplies of all
fossil fuels – oil, gas and coal – are becoming scarcer and more
expensive to produce. The days of ‘cheap oil and gas’ are coming to
an end. Uranium, the fuel for nuclear power, is also a finite
resource. By contrast, the reserves of renewable energy that are
technically accessible globally are large enough to provide about six
times more power than the world currently consumes - forever.

Renewable energy technologies vary widely in their technical and
economic maturity, but there are a range of sources which offer
increasingly attractive options. These include wind, biomass,
photovoltaic, solar thermal, geothermal, ocean and hydroelectric
power. Their common feature is that they produce little or no
greenhouse gases, and rely on virtually inexhaustible natural
sources for their ‘fuel’. Some of these technologies are already
competitive. Their economics will further improve as they develop
technically, as the price of fossil fuels continues to rise and as their
saving of carbon dioxide emissions is given a monetary value.

At the same time there is enormous potential for reducing our
consumption of energy, while providing the same level of energy
services. This study details a series of energy efficiency measures
which together can substantially reduce demand in industry, homes,
business and services.

Although nuclear power produces little carbon dioxide, there are
multiple threats to people and the environment from its operations.
These include the risks and environmental damage from uranium
mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons
proliferation, the unsolved problem of nuclear waste and the
potential hazard of a serious accident. The nuclear option is
therefore discounted in this analysis. The solution to our future
energy needs lies instead in greater use of renewable energy sources
for both heat and power.

the energy [r]evolution

The climate change imperative demands nothing short of an energy
revolution. At the core of this revolution will be a change in the
way that energy is produced, distributed and consumed.

the five key principles behind this shift will be to:

(cid:129) Implement renewable solutions, especially through decentralised

energy systems

(cid:129) Respect the natural limits of the environment

(cid:129) Phase out dirty, unsustainable energy sources

(cid:129) Create greater equity in the use of resources

(cid:129) Decouple economic growth from the consumption of fossil fuels

Decentralised energy systems, where power and heat are produced
close to the point of final use, avoid the current waste of energy
during conversion and distribution. They will be central to the Energy
[R]evolution, as will the need to provide electricity to the two billion
people around the world to whom access is presently denied.

Two scenarios up to the year 2050 are outlined in this report. The
Reference Scenario is based on the Reference Scenario published
by the International Energy Agency in World Energy Outlook 2007,
extrapolated forward from 2030. Compared to the 2004 IEA
projections, World Energy Outlook 2007 (WEO 2007) assumes a
slightly higher average annual growth rate of world Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) of 3.6%, instead of 3.2%, over the period 2005-
2030. At the same time, WEO 2007 expects final energy
consumption in 2030 to be 4% higher than in WEO 2004.

China and India are expected to grow faster than other regions,
followed by the Developing Asia group of countries, Africa and the
Transition Economies (mainly the former Soviet Union). The OECD
share of global purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted GDP will
decrease from 55% in 2005 to 29% by 2050.

The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has a target for worldwide
carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced by 50% below 1990 levels
by 2050, with per capita emissions reduced to less than 1.3 tonnes
per year. This is necessary if the increase in global temperature is to

10

remain below +2°C. A second objective is the global phasing out of
nuclear energy. To achieve these targets, the scenario is
characterised by significant efforts to fully exploit the large
potential for energy efficiency. At the same time, all cost-effective
renewable energy sources are accessed for both heat and electricity
generation, as well as the production of sustainable bio fuels.

Today, renewable energy sources account for 13% of the world’s
primary energy demand. Biomass, which is mostly used in the heat
sector, is the main renewable energy source. The share of renewable
energies for electricity generation is 18%. The contribution of
renewables to heat supply is around 24%, to a large extent
accounted for by traditional uses such as collected firewood. About
80% of the primary energy supply today still comes from fossil
fuels. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario describes a development
pathway which turns the present situation into a sustainable energy
supply through the following measures:

(cid:129) Exploitation of the existing large energy efficiency potentials will
ensure that primary energy demand increases only slightly - from
the current 474,900 PJ/a (2005) to 480,860 PJ/a in 2050,
compared to 867,700 PJ/a in the Reference Scenario. This
dramatic reduction is a crucial prerequisite for achieving a
significant share of renewable energy sources in the overall
energy supply system, for compensating the phasing out of
nuclear energy and for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.

(cid:129) The increased use of combined heat and power generation (CHP)
also improves the supply system’s energy conversion efficiency,
increasingly using natural gas and biomass. In the long term, the
decreasing demand for heat and the large potential for producing
heat directly from renewable energy sources limits the further
expansion of CHP.

(cid:129) The electricity sector will be the pioneer of renewable energy

utilisation. By 2050, around 77% of electricity will be produced
from renewable energy sources (including large hydro). A
capacity of 9,100 GW will produce 28,600 TWh/a renewable
electricity in 2050.

(cid:129) In the heat supply sector, the contribution of renewables will
increase to 70% by 2050. Fossil fuels will be increasingly
replaced by more efficient modern technologies, in particular
biomass, solar collectors and geothermal.

(cid:129) Before sustainable bio fuels are introduced in the transport
sector, the existing large efficiency potentials have to be
exploited. As biomass is mainly committed to stationary
applications, the production of bio fuels is limited by the
availability of sustainable raw materials. Electric vehicles
powered by renewable energy sources, will play an increasingly
important role from 2020 onwards.

(cid:129) By 2050, 56% of primary energy demand will be covered by

renewable energy sources.

To achieve an economically attractive growth of renewable energy
sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is of
great importance. Such mobilisation depends on technical potentials,
actual costs, cost reduction potentials and technological maturity.

costs

The slightly higher electricity generation costs (compared to
conventional fuels) under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario are
compensated for, to a large extent, by reduced demand for
electricity. Assuming average costs of 3 cents/kWh for
implementing energy efficiency measures, the additional cost for
electricity supply under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario will
amount to a maximum of $10 billion/a in 2010. These additional
costs, which represent society’s investment in an environmentally
benign, safe and economic energy supply, continue to decrease after
2010. By 2050 the annual costs of electricity supply will be $2,900
billion/a below those in the Reference Scenario.

It is assumed that average crude oil prices will increase from $52.5
per barrel in 2005 to $100 per barrel in 2010, and continue to rise
to $140 per barrel in 2050. Natural gas import prices are expected
to increase by a factor of four between 2005 and 2050, while coal
prices will nearly double, reaching $360 per tonne in 2050. A CO2
‘price adder’ is applied, which rises from $10 per tonne of CO2 in
2010 to $50 per tonne of in 2050.

development of CO2 emissions

While CO2 emissions worldwide will double under the Reference
Scenario up to 2050, and are thus far removed from a sustainable
development path, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will
decrease from 24,350 million tonnes in 2003 to 10,590 m/t in
2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 3.8 tonnes/capita
to 1.2 t/capita. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and a
growing electricity demand, CO2 emissions will decrease enormously
in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the
increased use of renewable electric vehicles, as well as a sharp
expansion in public transport, will even reduce CO2 emissions in the
transport sector. With a share of 35% of total emissions in 2050,
the power sector will reduce significantly but remain the largest
source of CO2 emissions - followed by transport and industry.

to make the energy [r]evolution real and to avoid
dangerous climate change, Greenpeace and EREC
demand for the energy sector that the following
policies and actions are implemented:

1. Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.

2. Internalise the external (social and environmental) costs of

energy production through “cap and trade” emissions trading.

3. Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming

appliances, buildings and vehicles.

4. Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy

and combined heat and power generation.

5. Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access

to the grid for renewable power generators.

6. Provide defined and stable returns for investors,

for example by feed-in tariff programmes.

7. Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms
to provide more environmental product information.

8. Increase research and development budgets
for renewable energy and energy efficiency.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

long term energy [r]evolution scenarios

The Energy [R]evolution Scenario outlines a sustainable pathway
for a new way of using and producing energy up to 2050.
Greenpeace, the DLR and the renewable energy industry have now
developed this scenario further towards a complete phasing out of
fossil fuels in the second half of this century.

A long term scenario over almost 100 years cannot be exact.
Projections of economic growth rates, fossil fuel prices or the
overall energy demand are of course speculative and by no means
represent forecasts. A regional breakdown is also not possible as
sufficient technical data, such as exact wind speed data in specific
locations, is not available. The grid integration of huge percentages
of fluctuating sources such as wind and solar photovoltaics equally
needs further scientific and technical research. But such a long
term scenario can give us an idea of by when a complete fossil fuel
and CO2 free energy supply at a global level is possible, and what
long term production capacities for renewable energy sources are
needed. In this context we developed two different long term
scenarios: the long term Energy [R]evolution and the advanced
Energy [R]evolution. The long term scenario follows the same
projections until the end of this century.

By 2050, renewable energy sources will account for more than
50% of the world’s primary energy demand in the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario. Approximately 44% of primary energy
supply in 2050 still comes from fossil fuels, mainly oil used in the
transport sector, followed by gas and coal in the power sector.

The long term Energy [R]evolution Scenario continues the
development pathway up to 2100 with the following outcomes:

(cid:129) demand: Energy efficiency potentials are largely exploited and

primary energy demand therefore stabilises at 2060 levels.

(cid:129) power sector: The electricity sector will pioneer the fossil fuel
phase-out. By 2070 over 93% of electricity will be produced
from renewable energy sources, with the remaining gas-fired
power plants mainly used for backup power. A capacity of 23,100
GW will produce 56,800 TWh of renewable electricity in 2100 –
17 times more than today.

From the currently available technologies, solar photovoltaics,
followed by wind power, concentrated solar power and geothermal,
have the highest potentials in the power sector. The use of ocean
energy might be significantly higher, but with the current state of
development, the technical and economical potential remains unclear.

12

(cid:129) heating and cooling: The increased use of combined heat and
power generation (CHP) in 2050 will remain at the same level up
to 2070. It will then fall back slightly to its 2040 level (5,500
TWh) until the end of this century, as the decreasing demand for
heat and the large potential for producing heat directly from
renewable energy sources, such as solar collectors and
geothermal, limits the further expansion of CHP.

(cid:129) In the heat supply sector, the contribution of renewables will

increase to 90% by 2080. A complete fossil fuels phase-out will
be realised shortly afterwards.

(cid:129) transport: Efficient use of transport systems will still be the
main way of limiting fuel use. Public transport systems will
continue to be far more energy efficient than individual vehicles.
However, we assume that cars will still be needed, especially in
rural areas. Between 2050 and 2085 the use of oil in cars will be
phased out completely and replaced mainly by electric vehicles.
The electricity will come from renewable energy sources.

(cid:129) By 2080, about 90% of primary energy demand will be covered
by renewable energy sources; in 2090 the renewable share will
reach 98.2%.

The advanced Energy [R]evolution Scenario takes a much more
radical approach to the climate crisis facing the world. In order to
pull the emergency brake on global emissions it therefore assumes
much shorter technical lifetimes for coal-fired power plants - 20
years instead of 40 years. This reduces global CO2 emissions even
faster and takes the latest evidence of greater climate sensitivity
into account. In order to fill the resulting gap, the annual growth
rates of renewable energy sources, especially solar photovoltaics,
wind and concentrated solar power plants, have been increased.

Growth rates increase from 2020 onwards to 2050. These expanded
growth rates are in line with the current projections of the wind and
solar industry (see Global Wind Energy Outlook 2008, Solar
Generation 2008). So in the advanced scenario the capacities for solar
and wind power generation appear 10 to 15 years earlier than
projected in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. The expansion of
geothermal co-generation has also been moved 20 years ahead of its
expected take-off. All other results remain the same as in the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, with the only changes affecting the power sector.

The main change for the power sector in the advanced Energy
[R]evolution Scenario is that all conventional coal-fired power
plants are phased out by 2050. Between 2020 and 2050 a total of
about 1,200 GW of capacity will be replaced by solar photovolatics,
on- and offshore wind and concentrated solar power plants. By
2050, 86% of electricity will be produced from renewable energy
sources and 96% by 2070. Again the remaining fossil fuel-based
power production is from gas. Compared to the basic Energy
[R]evolution Scenario the expected capacity of renewable energy
will emerge 15 years ahead of schedule, while the overall level of
renewable power generation from 2085 onwards will be the same.

From the renewables industry perspective, these larger quantities
are able to be delivered. However, the advanced scenario requires
more research and development into the large scale grid integration
of renewable energies as well as better regional meteorological data
to optimise the mix of different sources.

It is important to highlight that in the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario the majority of remaining coal power plants – which will
be replaced 20 years before the end of their technical lifetime – are
in China and India. This means that in practice all coal power
plants built between 2005 and 2020 will be replaced by renewable
energy sources. To support the building of capacity in developing
countries significant new public financing, especially from
industrialised countries, will be needed. It is vital that specific
funding mechanisms are developed under the international climate
negotiations that can assist the transfer of financial support to
climate change mitigation, including technology transfer.
Greenpeace International has developed one option for how such a
funding mechanism could work (see Chapter 2).

almost zero CO2 emissions by 2080

While worldwide CO2 emissions will decrease under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario from 10,589 million tonnes in 2050 (51%
below 1990 levels) down to 425 m/t in 2090, the advanced
scenario would reduce emissions even faster. By 2050, the advanced
Energy [R]evolution version would reduce CO2 emissions by 61%
below 1990 levels, and 80% below by the year 2075. Annual per
capita emissions would drop below 1 t/capita in 2050 under the
advanced scenario, compared with around 2060 under the basic
Energy [R]evolution.

Further CO2 reductions between 2040 and 2080 are only possible
in the transport sector, as the major remaining emitters are
combustion engines in cars. It is not possible to replace the
remaining fossil fuelled cars with electric vehicles as this would
drive electricity demand up again. The increased demand cannot be
met by renewables in this timeframe since this would exceed growth
rates and grid capacities based on today’s knowledge. The only way
to cut vehicle emissions further would be to reduce kilometres
driven by about 40% between 2040 and 2080.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

The greenhouse effect is the process by which the atmosphere traps
some of the sun’s energy, warming the Earth and moderating our
climate. A human-driven increase in ‘greenhouse gases’ has
enhanced this effect artificially, raising global temperatures and
disrupting our climate. These greenhouse gases include carbon
dioxide, produced by burning fossil fuels and through deforestation,
methane, released from agriculture, animals and landfill sites, and
nitrous oxide, resulting from agricultural production plus a variety
of industrial chemicals.

Every day we damage our climate by using fossil fuels (oil, coal and
gas) for energy and transport. As a result, climate change is already
impacting on our lives, and is expected to destroy the livelihoods of
many people in the developing world, as well as ecosystems and
species, in the coming decades. We therefore need to significantly
reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This makes both
environmental and economic sense.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the
United Nations forum for established scientific opinion, the world’s
temperature is expected to increase over the next hundred years by
up to 5.8°C. This is much faster than anything experienced so far in
human history. The goal of climate policy should be to keep the
global mean temperature rise to less than 2°C above pre-industrial
levels. At 2°C and above, damage to ecosystems and disruption to
the climate system increases dramatically. We have very little time
within which we can change our energy system to meet these
targets. This means that global emissions will have to peak and start
to decline by the end of the next decade at the latest.

Climate change is already harming people and ecosystems. Its
reality can be seen in disintegrating polar ice, thawing permafrost,
dying coral reefs, rising sea levels and fatal heat waves. It is not
only scientists that are witnessing these changes. From the Inuit in
the far north to islanders near the Equator, people are already
struggling with the impacts of climate change. An average global
warming of 2°C threatens millions of people with an increased risk
of hunger, malaria, flooding and water shortages. Never before has
humanity been forced to grapple with such an immense
environmental crisis. If we do not take urgent and immediate action
to stop global warming, the damage could become irreversible. This
can only happen through a rapid reduction in the emission of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

This is a summary of some likely effects if we allow
current trends to continue:

Likely effects of small to moderate warming

(cid:129) Sea level rise due to melting glaciers and the thermal expansion
of the oceans as global temperature increases. Massive releases
of greenhouse gases from melting permafrost and dying forests.

(cid:129) A greater risk of more extreme weather events such as

heatwaves, droughts and floods. Already, the global incidence
of drought has doubled over the past 30 years.

(cid:129) Severe regional impacts. In Europe, river flooding will increase,
as well as coastal flooding, erosion and wetland loss. Flooding
will also severely affect low-lying areas in developing countries
such as Bangladesh and South China.

(cid:129) Natural systems, including glaciers, coral reefs, mangroves, alpine
ecosystems, boreal forests, tropical forests, prairie wetlands and
native grasslands will be severely threatened.

(cid:129) Increased risk of species extinction and biodiversity loss.

The greatest impacts will be on poorer countries in sub-Saharan
Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Andean South America as
well as small islands least able to protect themselves from
increasing droughts, rising sea levels, the spread of disease and
decline in agricultural production.

longer term catastrophic effects Warming from emissions may
trigger the irreversible meltdown of the Greenland ice sheet, adding
up to seven metres of sea level rise over several centuries. New
evidence shows that the rate of ice discharge from parts of the
Antarctic mean it is also at risk of meltdown. Slowing, shifting or
shutting down of the Atlantic Gulf Stream current will have
dramatic effects in Europe, and disrupt the global ocean circulation
system. Large releases of methane from melting permafrost and
from the oceans will lead to rapid increases of the gas in the
atmosphere, and consequent warming.

the kyoto protocol

Recognising these threats, the signatories to the 1992 UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed the Kyoto
Protocol in 1997. The Protocol finally entered into force in early
2005 and its 165 member countries meet twice annually to
negotiate further refinement and development of the agreement.
Only one major industrialised nation, the United States, has not
ratified Kyoto.

The Kyoto Protocol commits its signatories to reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from their 1990 level by the
target period of 2008-2012. This has in turn resulted in the
adoption of a series of regional and national reduction targets. In
the European Union, for instance, the commitment is to an overall
reduction of 8%. In order to help reach this target, the EU has
also agreed a target to increase its proportion of renewable energy
from 6% to 12% by 2010.

At present the Kyoto countries are negotiating the second phase of
the agreement, covering the period from 2013-2017. Greenpeace is
calling for industrialised country emissions to be reduced by 18%
from 1990 levels for this second commitment period, and by 30%
for the third period covering 2018-2022. Only with these cuts do
we stand a reasonable chance of meeting the 2°C target.

The Kyoto Protocol’s architecture relies fundamentally on legally
binding emissions reduction obligations. To achieve these targets,
carbon is turned into a commodity which can be traded. The aim is
to encourage the most economically efficient emissions reductions,
in turn leveraging the necessary investment in clean technology
from the private sector to drive a revolution in energy supply.

Negotiators are running out of time, however. Signatory countries
agreed a negotiating ‘mandate’, known as the Bali Action Plan, in
December 2007, but they must complete these negotiations with a
final agreement on the second Kyoto commitment period by the end
of 2009 at the absolute latest. Forward-thinking nations can move
ahead of the game by implementing strong domestic targets now,
building the industry and skills bases that will deliver the transition
to a low-carbon society, and thereby provide a strong platform from
which to negotiate the second commitment period.

Greenpeace and the renewables industry have a clear
agenda for the policy changes which need to be made
to encourage a shift to renewable sources.
The main demands are:

1. Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.

2. Internalise external (social and environmental) costs through

“cap and trade” emissions trading.

3. Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming

appliances, buildings and vehicles.

4. Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and

combined heat and power generation.

5. Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to

the grid for renewable power generators.

6. Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example

through feed-in tariff payments.

7. Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to provide

more environmental product information.

8. Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy

and energy efficiency

Conventional energy sources receive an estimated $250-300 billion4
in subsidies per year worldwide, resulting in heavily distorted markets.
Subsidies artificially reduce the price of power, keep renewable energy
out of the market place and prop up non-competitive technologies
and fuels. Eliminating direct and indirect subsidies to fossil fuels and
nuclear power would help move us towards a level playing field across
the energy sector. Renewable energy would not need special provisions
if markets factored in the cost of climate damage from greenhouse
gas pollution. Subsidies to polluting technologies are perverse in that
they are economically as well as environmentally detrimental.
Removing subsidies from conventional electricity would not only save
taxpayers’ money. It would also dramatically reduce the need for
renewable energy support.

At present, renewable energy generators have to compete with old
nuclear and fossil fuel power stations which produce electricity at
marginal costs because consumers and taxpayers have already paid
the interest and depreciation on the original investments. Political
action is needed to overcome these distortions and create a level
playing field for renewable energy technologies to compete.

At a time when governments around the world are in the process of
liberalising their electricity markets, the increasing competitiveness
of renewable energy should lead to higher demand. Without political
support, however, renewable energy remains at a disadvantage,
marginalised by distortions in the world’s electricity markets created
by decades of massive financial, political and structural support to
conventional technologies. Developing renewables will therefore
require strong political and economic efforts, especially through
laws that guarantee stable tariffs over a period of up to 20 years.
Renewable energy will also contribute to sustainable economic
growth, high quality jobs, technology development, global
competitiveness and industrial and research leadership.

renewable energy targets

In recent years, in order to reduce greenhouse emissions as well as
increase energy security, a growing number of countries have
established targets for renewable energy. These are either expressed
in terms of installed capacity or as a percentage of energy
consumption. These targets have served as important catalysts for
increasing the share of renewable energy throughout the world.

A time period of just a few years is not long enough in the
electricity sector, however, where the investment horizon can be up
to 40 years. Renewable energy targets therefore need to have short,
medium and long term steps and must be legally binding in order to
be effective. They should also be supported by mechanisms such as
feed-in tariffs for renewable electricity generation. In order for the
proportion of renewable energy to increase significantly, targets
must be set in accordance with the local potential for each
technology (wind, solar, biomass etc) and be complemented by
policies that develop the skills and manufacturing bases to deliver
the agreed quantity of renewable energy.

In recent years the wind and solar power industries have shown
that it is possible to maintain a growth rate of 30 to 35% in the
renewables sector. In conjunction with the European Photovoltaic
Industry Association1, the European Solar Thermal Power Industry
Association2 and the Global Wind Energy Council3, the European
Renewable Energy Council and Greenpeace have documented the
development of those industries from 1990 onwards and outlined a
prognosis for growth up to 2020 and 2040.

This chapter outlines a Greenpeace proposal for a feed-in tariff
system in developing countries financed by emissions trading from
OECD countries.

The Energy [R]evolution Scenario shows that renewable electricity
generation has huge environmental and economic benefits. However its
generation costs, especially in developing countries, will remain higher
than those of existing coal or gas-fired power stations for the next five
to ten years. To bridge this gap between conventional fossil fuel-based
power generation and renewables, a support mechanism is needed.

The Feed in Tariff Fund Emissions Trading model (FFET) is a
concept conceived by Greenpeace International5. The aim is the
expansion of renewable energy in developing countries with
financial support from industrialised nations – a mechanism to
implement renewable energy technology transfer via future Joint
Implementation, Clean Development Mechanism projects or
Technology Transfer programmes under the Kyoto Protocol. With
the Kyoto countries currently negotiating the second phase of their
agreement, covering the period from 2013-2017, the proposed
FFET mechanism could be used under all the existing flexible
mechanisms, auctioning cap & trade schemes or linked to
technology transfer projects.

The thinking behind the FFET in a nutshell is to link the feed-in tariff
system, as it has been successfully applied in countries like Germany
and Spain, with emissions trading schemes such as the ETS in
Europe through already established international funding channels
such as development aid banks or the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.

bankable support schemes

Since the early development of renewable energies within the power
sector, there has been an ongoing debate about the best and most
effective type of support scheme. The European Commission
published a survey in December 2005 which provides a good overview
of the experience so far. According to this report, feed-in tariffs are
by far the most efficient and successful mechanism. Globally more
than 40 countries have adopted some version of the system.

Although the organisational form of these tariffs differs from
country to country, there are certain clear criteria which emerge as
essential for creating a successful renewable energy policy. At the
heart of these is a reliable, bankable support scheme for renewable
energy projects which provides long term stability and certainty6.
Bankable support schemes result in lower cost projects because
they lower the risk for both investors and equipment suppliers. The
cost of wind-powered electricity in Germany is up to 40% cheaper
than in the United Kingdom7, for example, because the support
system is more secure and reliable.

For developing countries, feed-in laws would be an ideal mechanism
for the implementation of new renewable energies. The extra costs,
however, which are usually covered in Europe, for example, by a
very minor increase in the overall electricity price for consumers,
are still seen as an obstacle. In order to enable technology transfer
from Annex 1 countries to developing countries, a mix of a feed-in
law, international finance and emissions trading could be used to
establish a locally based renewable energy infrastructure and
industry with the assistance of OECD countries.
20

learning from experience

The FFET program brings together three different support
mechanisms and builds on the experience from 20 years of
renewable energy support programmes.

experience of feed-in tariffs

(cid:129) Feed-in tariffs are seen as the best way forward and very popular,

especially in developing countries.

(cid:129) The main argument against them is the increase in electricity

prices for households and industry, as the extra costs are shared
across all customers. This is particularly difficult for developing
countries, where many people can’t afford to spend more money
for electricity services.

experience of emissions trading Emissions trading (between
countries which need to make emissions reductions and countries
where renewable energy projects can be more easily or cheaply
implemented) already plays a role in achieving CO2 reductions
under the Kyoto Protocol. The experience so far is that:

(cid:129) The CO2 market is unstable, with the price per tonne

varying significantly.

(cid:129) The market is still a ‘virtual’ market, with only limited

actual flow of money.

(cid:129) Putting a price on CO2 emissions makes fossil fuelled power more
expensive, but due to the unstable and fluctuating prices it will
not help to make renewable energy projects more economic
within the foreseeable future.

(cid:129) Most systems are not yet delivering real cuts in emissions.

experience of international financing Finance for renewable energy
projects is one of the main obstacles in developing countries. While large
scale projects have fewer funding problems, small, community based
projects, whilst having a high degree of public acceptance, face financing
difficulties. The experiences from micro credits for small hydro projects
in Bangladesh, for example, as well as wind farms in Denmark and
Germany, show how strong local participation and acceptance can be
achieved. The main reasons for this are the economic benefits flowing to
the local community and careful project planning based on good local
knowledge and understanding. When the community identifies the
project rather than the project identifying the community, the result is
generally faster bottom-up growth of the renewables sector.

combining existing programmes

The basic aims of the Feed-in Tariff Fund Emissions Trading scheme are
to facilitate the implementation of feed-in laws for developing countries,
to use existing emissions trading schemes to link CO2 prices directly with
the uptake of renewable energy, and to use the existing infrastructure,of
international financial institutions to secure investment for projects and
lower the risk factor. The FFET concept will have three parts – fixed
feed-in tariffs, emissions trading and a funding arrangement.

1. fixed feed-in tariffs

3. the FFET fund

Feed-in tariffs will provide bankable and long term stable support for
the development of a local renewable energy market in developing
countries. The tariffs should bridge the gap between conventional
power generation costs and those of renewable energy generation.

The key parameters for feed-in tariffs under FFET are:

(cid:129) Variable tariffs for different renewable energy technologies,

depending on their costs and technology maturity, paid for 20 years.

(cid:129) Payments based on actual generation in order to achieve properly

maintained projects with high performance ratios.

(cid:129) Any additional finance required over the (20 year) period will be
secured through a public fund, which could generate some capital
income, for example via interest rates, from a soft loan
programme to finance renewable energy projects (see below).

(cid:129) Payment of the ‘additional costs’ for renewable generation will be
based on the Spanish system of the wholesale electricity price
plus a fixed premium.

A developing country which wants to apply for funding to operate
renewable energy projects under the FFET scheme will need to
establish clear regulations for the following:

(cid:129) Guaranteed access to the electricity grid for renewable

electricity projects.

The FFET fund will act as a buffer between fluctuating CO2 emissions
prices and stable long term feed-in tariffs. The fund will secure the
payment of the required feed-in tariffs during the whole period (about
20 years) for each project. This fund could be managed by
intrernational financial institutions operating in Europe and Central
Asia or by Multilateral Development Banks. In order to provide access
to finance for small-scale businesses, a co-operation with a local bank
with a local presence in villages or cities would be desirable.

All renewable energy projects must have a clear set of
environmental criteria which are part of the national licensing
procedure in the country where the project will generate electricity.
Those criteria will have to meet a minimum environmental standard
defined by an independent monitoring group. If there are already
acceptable criteria developed, for example for CDM projects, they
should be adopted rather than reinventing the wheel. The board
members will come from NGOs, energy and finance experts as well
as members of the governments involved. The fund will not be able
to use the money for speculative investments. It can only provide
soft loans for FFET projects.

The key parameters for the FFET fund will be:

(cid:129) The fund will guarantee the payment of the total feed-in tariffs
over a period of 20 years if the project is operated properly.

(cid:129) The fund will receive annual income from emissions

(cid:129) Establishment of a feed-in law based on successful examples.

trading under FFET.

(cid:129) Transparent access to all data needed to establish the feed-in

tariff, including full records of generated electricity.

(cid:129) The fund can provide soft loans to finance renewable

energy projects.

(cid:129) The fund will generate income from interest rates only.

(cid:129) The fund will pay feed-in tariffs annually only on the basis

of generated electricity.

(cid:129) The operator of a FFET project is required to transmit all relevant
data about generation to a central database. This database will also
be used to evaluate the performance of the project.

(cid:129) Every FFET project must have a professional maintenance

company to ensure high availability.

(cid:129) The grid operator must do its own monitoring and send

generation data to the FFET fund. Data from the project and
grid operators will be compared regularly to check consistency.

(cid:129) Clear planning and licencing procedures.

2. emissions trading

The traded CO2 emissions will come from OECD countries on top of
any commitment under their national emission reduction targets.
Every tonne of CO2 will be connected to a specific amount of
electricity form renewable energy. A simple approach would be to use
a factor of 1kg CO2 for 1 kWh of renewable electricity, which equals
the amount of avoided CO2 emissions from an older coal power plant.
A more complex method would be to use the average CO2 emissions
per kilowatt-hour in the specific country or the world’s average, which
is currently 0.6kg CO2/kWh. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario shows
that the average additional costs (under the proposed energy mix)
between 2008 and 2015 are between 1 and 4 cents per kilowatt-hour
so the price per tonne of CO2 would be between €10 and €40.

The key parameters for emissions trading
under FFET will be:

(cid:129) 1 tonne CO2 = 1,000 kWh renewable electricity (emissions

factor: 1kg CO2/kWh)

(cid:129) 1 tonne CO2 represents a 20 year ‘package’ of renewable

electricity (1,000 kWh = 20 years x annual 50 kWh renewable
electricity production)

Nuclear energy is a relatively small industry with big problems. It
covers just one sixteenth of the world’s primary energy consumption,
a share set to decline over the coming decades. The average age of
operating commercial nuclear reactors is 23 years, so more power
stations are being shut down than started. In 2007, world nuclear
production fell by 1.8 % and the number of operating reactors was
439, five less than the historical peak of 2002.

In terms of new power stations, the amount of nuclear capacity
added annually between 2000 and 2007 was 2,500 MWe on
average. This was six times less than wind power (13,300 MWe per
annum between 2000 and 2007). In 2007, newly constructed
renewable energy power plants in Germany generated 13 TWh of
electricity – as much as two large nuclear units.

Despite the rhetoric of a ‘nuclear renaissance’, the industry is
struggling with a massive increase in costs and construction delays
as well as safety and security problems linked to reactor operation,
radioactive waste and nuclear proliferation.

a solution to climate protection?

The promise of nuclear energy to contribute to both climate
protection and energy supply needs to be checked against reality. In
the most recent Energy Technology Perspectives report published by
the International Energy Agency8, for example, its Blue Map
scenario outlines a future energy mix which would halve global
carbon emissions by the middle of this century. To reach this goal
the IEA assumes a massive expansion of nuclear power between
now and 2050, with installed capacity increasing four-fold and
electricity generation reaching 9,857 TWh/year, compared to 2,608
TWh in 2007. In order to achieve this, the report says that 32
large reactors (1,000 MWe) would have to be built every year
from now until 2050. This would be unrealistic, expensive,
hazardous and too late to make a difference.

unrealistic: Such a rapid growth is practically impossible given the
technical limitations. This scale of development was achieved in the
history of nuclear power for only two years at the peak of the state-
driven boom of the mid-1980s. It is unlikely to be achieved again,
not to mention maintained for 40 consecutive years. While 1984
and 1985 saw 31 GW of newly added nuclear capacity, the decade
average was 17 GW annually. In the past ten years, only three large
reactors have been brought on line each year, and the current
production capacity of the global nuclear industry cannot deliver
more than an annual six units.

expensive: The IEA scenario assumes very optimistic investment
costs of $2,100/kWe installed, in line with what the industry has
been recently promising. The reality indicates three times that
much. Recent estimates by US business analysts Moody’s (June
2008) put the cost of nuclear investment as high as $7,000/kWe.
Price quotes for projects under preparation in the US cover a range
from $5,200 to 8,000/kWe9. The latest cost estimate for the first
French EPR pressurised water reactor being built in Finland is
$5,200/kWe, a figure likely to increase for later reactors as prices
escalate. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the cost index
for nuclear components has risen by 173 % since 2000 – a near
tripling over the past eight years10. Building 1,400 large reactors
(1,000 MWe), even at the current cost of about $7,000/kWe,
would require an investment of US$9.8 trillion.

hazardous: Massive expansion of nuclear energy would necessarily
lead to a large increase in related hazards, such as serious reactor
accidents, growing stockpiles of deadly high level nuclear waste
which will need to be safeguarded for thousands of years and
potential proliferation of both nuclear technologies and materials
that can be diverted to military or terrorist use. The 1,400 large
operating reactors in 2050 would generate an annual 35,000 tons
of spent fuel (assuming they are light water reactors, the most
common design for most new projects). This also means the
production of 350,000 kilograms of plutonium each year, enough to
build 35,000 crude nuclear weapons.

Most of the expected electricity demand growth by 2050 will occur
in non-OECD countries. This means that a large proportion of the
new reactors would need to be built in those countries in order to
have a global impact on emissions. At the moment, the list of
countries with announced nuclear ambitions is long and worrying in
terms of their political situation and stability, especially with the
need to guarantee against the hazards of accidents and
proliferation for many decades. The World Nuclear Association
listed the Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries in May 2008 as
Albania, Belarus, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Norway, Poland, Estonia,
Latvia, Ireland, Iran, the Gulf states, Yemen, Israel, Syria, Jordan,
Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam,
Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Venezuela,
Nigeria, Ghana and Namibia.

slow: Climate science says that we need to reach a peak of global
greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 and reduce them by 20 % in
2020. Even in developed countries with an established nuclear
infrastructure it takes at least a decade from the decision to build a
reactor to the delivery of its first electricity, and often much longer.
Out of 35 reactors officially listed as under construction by the IEA
in mid-July 2008, one third had been in this category for two decades
or more, indicating that these projects are not progressing. This
means that even if the world’s governments decided to implement
strong nuclear expansion now, only a few reactors would start
generating electricity before 2020. The contribution from nuclear
power towards reducing emissions would come too late to help.

nuclear power blocks solutions

1. nuclear proliferation

Even if the ambitious nuclear scenario is implemented, regardless
of costs and hazards, the IEA concludes that the contribution of
nuclear power to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the
energy sector would be only 4.6 % - less than 3 % of the global
overall reduction required.

There are other technologies that can deliver much larger emission
reductions, and much faster. Their investment costs are lower and
they do not create global security risks. Even the IEA finds that the
combined potential of efficiency savings and renewable energy to cut
emissions by 2050 is more than ten times larger than that of nuclear.

The world has limited time, finance and industrial capacity to change
our energy sector and achieve a large reduction in greenhouse
emissions. Choosing the pathway by spending $10 trillion on nuclear
development would be a fatally wrong decision. It would not save the
climate but it would necessarily take resources away from solutions
described in this report and at the same time create serious global
security hazards. Therefore new nuclear reactors are a clearly
dangerous obstacle to the protection of the climate.

nuclear power in the energy [r]evolution scenario

For the reasons explained above, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario
envisages a nuclear phase-out. Existing reactors would be closed at
the end of their average operational lifetime of 35 years. We
assume that no new construction is started after 2008 and only
two thirds of the reactors currently under construction will be
finally put into operation.

the dangers of nuclear power

Although the generation of electricity through nuclear power
produces much less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels, there are
multiple threats to people and the environment from its operations.
The main risks are:

(cid:129) Nuclear Proliferation

(cid:129) Nuclear Waste

(cid:129) Safety Risks

These are the background to why nuclear power has been discounted
as a future technology in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.

Manufacturing a nuclear bomb requires fissile material - either
uranium-235 or plutonium-239. Most nuclear reactors use uranium
as a fuel and produce plutonium during their operation. It is
impossible to adequately protect a large reprocessing plant to
prevent the diversion of plutonium to nuclear weapons. A small-
scale plutonium separation plant can be built in four to six months,
so any country with an ordinary reactor can produce nuclear
weapons relatively quickly.

The result is that nuclear power and nuclear weapons have grown
up like Siamese twins. Since international controls on nuclear
proliferation began, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea have
all obtained nuclear weapons, demonstrating the link between civil
and military nuclear power. Both the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT)
embody an inherent contradiction - seeking to promote the
development of ‘peaceful’ nuclear power whilst at the same time
trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons

Israel, India and Pakistan all used their civil nuclear operations to
develop weapons capability, operating outside international
safeguards. North Korea developed a nuclear weapon even as a
signatory of the NPT. A major challenge to nuclear proliferation
controls has been the spread of uranium enrichment technology to
Iran, Libya and North Korea. The Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, has said
that “should a state with a fully developed fuel-cycle capability
decide, for whatever reason, to break away from its non-
proliferation commitments, most experts believe it could produce a
nuclear weapon within a matter of months11.”

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
has also warned that the security threat of trying to tackle climate
change with a global fast reactor programme (using plutonium
fuel) “would be colossal"12. Even without fast reactors, all of the
reactor designs currently being promoted around the world could be
fuelled by MOX (mixed oxide fuel), from which plutonium can be
easily separated.

Restricting the production of fissile material to a few ‘trusted’
countries will not work. It will engender resentment and create a
colossal security threat. A new UN agency is needed to tackle the
twin threats of climate change and nuclear proliferation by phasing
out nuclear power and promoting sustainable energy, in the process
promoting world peace rather than threatening it.

2. nuclear waste

3. safety risks

The nuclear industry claims it can ‘dispose’ of its nuclear waste by
burying it deep underground, but this will not isolate the radioactive
material from the environment forever. A deep dump only slows
down the release of radioactivity into the environment. The industry
tries to predict how fast a dump will leak so that it can claim that
radiation doses to the public living nearby in the future will be
“acceptably low”. But scientific understanding is not sufficiently
advanced to make such predictions with any certainty.

As part of its campaign to build new nuclear stations around the
world, the industry claims that problems associated with burying
nuclear waste are to do with public acceptability rather than
technical issues. It points to nuclear dumping proposals in Finland,
Sweden or the United States to underline its argument.

The most hazardous waste is the highly radioactive waste (or spent)
fuel removed from nuclear reactors, which stays radioactive for
hundreds of thousands of years. In some countries the situation is
exacerbated by ‘reprocessing’ this spent fuel – which involves dissolving
it in nitric acid to separate out weapons-usable plutonium. This process
leaves behind a highly radioactive liquid waste. There are about
270,000 tonnes of spent nuclear waste fuel in storage, much of it at
reactor sites. Spent fuel is accumulating at around 12,000 tonnes per
year, with around a quarter of that going for reprocessing13. No
country in the world has a solution for high level waste.

The IAEA recognises that, despite its international safety
requirements, “…radiation doses to individuals in the future can
only be estimated and that the uncertainties associated with these
estimates will increase for times farther into the future.”

The least damaging option for waste already created at the current
time is to store it above ground, in dry storage at the site of origin,
although this option also presents major challenges and threats. The
only real solution is to stop producing the waste.

Windscale (1957), Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986)
and Tokaimura (1999) are only a few of the hundreds of nuclear
accidents which have occurred to date.

A simple power failure at a Swedish nuclear plant in 2006
highlighted our vulnerability to nuclear catastrophe. Emergency
power systems at the Forsmark plant failed for 20 minutes during a
power cut and four of Sweden’s 10 nuclear power stations had to
be shut down. If power was not restored there could have been a
major incident within hours. A former director of the Forsmark
plant later said that "it was pure luck there wasn’t a meltdown”.
The closure of the plants removed at a stroke roughly 20% of
Sweden’s electricity supply.

A nuclear chain reaction must be kept under control, and harmful
radiation must, as far as possible, be contained within the reactor,
with radioactive products isolated from humans and carefully
managed. Nuclear reactions generate high temperatures, and fluids
used for cooling are often kept under pressure. Together with the
intense radioactivity, these high temperatures and pressures make
operating a reactor a difficult and complex task.

The risks from operating reactors are increasing and the likelihood
of an accident is now higher than ever. Most of the world’s reactors
are more than 20 years old and therefore more prone to age
related failures. Many utilities are attempting to extend their life
from the 40 years or so they were originally designed for to around
60 years, posing new risks.

De-regulation has meanwhile pushed nuclear utilities to decrease
safety-related investments and limit staff whilst increasing reactor
pressure and operational temperature and the burn-up of the fuel.
This accelerates ageing and decreases safety margins.

New so-called passively safe reactors have many safety systems
replaced by ‘natural’ processes, such as gravity fed emergency
cooling water and air cooling. This can make them more vulnerable
to terrorist attack.

“... reactors with gravity fed emergency
cooling water and air cooling can make
them more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.”

1. uranium mining

4. power plant operation

Uranium, used in nuclear
power plants, is extracted
from huge mines in Canada,
Australia, Russia and
Nigeria. Mine workers can
breathe in radioactive gas
from which they are in
danger of contracting lung
cancer. Uranium mining
produces huge quantities of
mining debris, including
radioactive particles which
can contaminate surface
water and food.

Uranium nuclei are split in a nuclear
reactor, releasing energy which heats up
water. The compressed steam is
converted in a turbine generator into
electricity. This process creates a
radioactive ‘cocktail’ which involves
more than 100 products. One of these is
the highly toxic and long-lasting
plutonium. Radioactive material can
enter the environment through accidents
at nuclear power plants. The worst
accident to date happened at Chernobyl
in the then Soviet Union in 1986. A
nuclear reactor generates enough
plutonium every year for the production
of as many as 39 nuclear weapons.

2. uranium
enrichment

Natural uranium and
concentrated ‘yellow cake’
contain just 0.7% of
fissionable uranium 235. To use
the material in a nuclear
reactor, the share must go up to
3 or 5 %. This process can be
carried out in 16 facilities
around the world. 80% of the
total volume is rejected as
‘tails’, a waste product.
Enrichment generates massive
amounts of ‘depleted uranium’
that ends up as long-lived
radioactive waste or is used in
weapons or as tank shielding.

3. fuel rod –
production

Enriched material is converted
into uranium dioxide and
compressed to pellets in fuel
rod production facilities. These
pellets fill 4m long tubes called
fuel rods. There are 29 fuel rod
production facilities globally.
The worst accident in this type
of facility happened in
September 1999 in Tokaimura,
Japan, when two workers died.
Several hundred workers and
villagers have suffered
radioactive contamination.

5. reprocessing

Reprocessing involves the chemical
extraction of contaminated uranium and
plutonium from used reactor fuel rods.
There are now over 230,000 kilograms
of plutonium stockpiled around the
world from reprocessing – five
kilograms is sufficient for one nuclear
bomb. Reprocessing is not the same as
recycling: the volume of waste increases
many tens of times and millions of litres
of radioactive waste are discharged into
the sea and air each day. The process
also demands the transport of
radioactive material and nuclear waste
by ship, rail, air and road around the
world. An accident or terrorist attack
could release vast quantities of nuclear
material into the environment. There is
no way to guarantee the safety of
nuclear transport.

6. waste storage

There is not a single final
storage facility for nuclear
waste available anywhere in the
world. Safe secure storage of
high level waste over thousands
of years remains unproven,
leaving a deadly legacy for
future generations. Despite this
the nuclear industry continues
to generate more and more
waste each day.

The climate change imperative demands nothing short of an energy
revolution. The expert consensus is that this fundamental change
must begin very soon and be well underway within the next ten
years in order to avert the worst impacts. What we need is a
complete transformation in the way we produce, consume and
distribute energy and at the same time maintain economic growth.
Nothing short of such a revolution will enable us to limit global
warming to less than a rise in temperature of 2°C, above which the
impacts become devastating.

Current electricity generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels,
with their associated CO2 emissions, in very large power stations
which waste much of their primary input energy. More energy is
lost as the power is moved around the electricity grid network and
converted from high transmission voltage down to a supply suitable
for domestic or commercial consumers. The system is innately
vulnerable to disruption: localised technical, weather-related or even
deliberately caused faults can quickly cascade, resulting in
widespread blackouts. Whichever technology is used to generate
electricity within this old fashioned configuration, it will inevitably
be subject to some, or all, of these problems. At the core of the
Energy [R]evolution there therefore needs to be a change in the
way that energy is both produced and distributed.

key principles

the energy [r]evolution can be achieved
by adhering to five key principles:

1.respect natural limits – phase out fossil fuels by the end of

this century We must learn to respect natural limits. There is only
so much carbon that the atmosphere can absorb. Each year we
emit over 25 billion tonnes of carbon equivalent; we are literally
filling up the sky. Geological resources of coal could provide
several hundred years of fuel, but we cannot burn them and keep
within safe limits. Oil and coal development must be ended.

The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has a target to reduce energy
related CO2 emissions to a maximum of 10 Gt (Giga tonnes) by
2050 and phase out fossil fuels by 2085.

2.equity and fairness As long as there are natural limits there
needs to be a fair distribution of benefits and costs within
societies, between nations and between present and future
generations. At one extreme, a third of the world’s population has
no access to electricity, whilst the most industrialised countries
consume much more than their fair share.

The effects of climate change on the poorest communities are
exacerbated by massive global energy inequality. If we are to
address climate change, one of the principles must be equity and
fairness, so that the benefits of energy services – such as light,
heat, power and transport – are available for all: north and
south, rich and poor. Only in this way can we create true energy
security, as well as the conditions for genuine human wellbeing.

The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has a target to achieve energy
equity as soon as technically possible. By 2050 the average per
capita emission should be between 1 and 2 tonnes of CO2.

3.implement clean, renewable solutions and decentralise

energy systems There is no energy shortage. All we need to do is
use existing technologies to harness energy effectively and
efficiently. Renewable energy and energy efficiency measures are
ready, viable and increasingly competitive. Wind, solar and other
renewable energy technologies have experienced double digit
market growth for the past decade.

Just as climate change is real, so is the renewable energy sector.
Sustainable decentralised energy systems produce less carbon
emissions, are cheaper and involve less dependence on imported
fuel. They create more jobs and empower local communities.
Decentralised systems are more secure and more efficient. This is
what the Energy [R]evolution must aim to create.

“THE STONE AGE DID NOT END FOR LACK OF STONE, AND THE OIL

AGE WILL END LONG BEFORE THE WORLD RUNS OUT OF OIL.”

Sheikh Zaki Yamani, former Saudi Arabian oil minister

To stop the Earth’s climate spinning out of control, most of the world’s
fossil fuel reserves – coal, oil and gas – must remain in the ground. Our
goal is for humans to live within the natural limits of our small planet.

4.decouple growth from fossil fuel use Starting in the developed
countries, economic growth must fully decouple from fossil fuels.
It is a fallacy to suggest that economic growth must be
predicated on their increased combustion.

We need to use the energy we produce much more efficiently, and we
need to make the transition to renewable energy – away from fossil
fuels – quickly in order to enable clean and sustainable growth.

5.phase out dirty, unsustainable energy We need to phase out coal
and nuclear power. We cannot continue to build coal plants at a time
when emissions pose a real and present danger to both ecosystems
and people. And we cannot continue to fuel the myriad nuclear threats
by pretending nuclear power can in any way help to combat climate
change. There is no role for nuclear power in the Energy [R]evolution.

from principles to practice

In 2005, renewable energy sources accounted for 13% of the
world’s primary energy demand. Biomass, which is mostly used for
heating, is the main renewable energy source. The share of
renewable energy in electricity generation was 18%. The
contribution of renewables to primary energy demand for heat
supply was around 24%. About 80% of primary energy supply
today still comes from fossil fuels, and 6% from nuclear power14.

The time is right to make substantial structural changes in the
energy and power sector within the next decade. Many power plants
in industrialised countries, such as the USA, Japan and the
European Union, are nearing retirement; more than half of all
operating power plants are over 20 years old. At the same time
developing countries, such as China, India and Brazil, are looking to
satisfy the growing energy demand created by expanding economies.

Within the next ten years, the power sector will decide how this new
demand will be met, either by fossil and nuclear fuels or by the
efficient use of renewable energy. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario
is based on a new political framework in favour of renewable
energy and cogeneration combined with energy efficiency.

To make this happen both renewable energy and cogeneration – on
a large scale and through decentralised, smaller units – have to
grow faster than overall global energy demand. Both approaches
must replace old generating technologies and deliver the additional
energy required in the developing world.

As it is not possible to switch directly from the current large scale fossil
and nuclear fuel based energy system to a full renewable energy supply,
a transition phase is required to build up the necessary infrastructure.
Whilst remaining firmly committed to the promotion of renewable
sources of energy, we appreciate that gas, used in appropriately scaled
cogeneration plant, is valuable as a transition fuel, and able to drive
cost-effective decentralisation of the energy infrastructure. With warmer
summers, tri-generation, which incorporates heat-fired absorption
chillers to deliver cooling capacity in addition to heat and power, will
become a particularly valuable means to achieve emissions reductions.

a development pathway

The Energy [R]evolution envisages a development pathway which
turns the present energy supply structure into a sustainable system.
There are two main stages to this.

step 1: energy efficiency The Energy [R]evolution is aimed at the
ambitious exploitation of the potential for energy efficiency. It
focuses on current best practice and technologies which will
become available in the future, assuming continuous innovation. The
energy savings are fairly equally distributed over the three sectors –
industry, transport and domestic/business. Intelligent use, not
abstinence, is the basic philosophy for future energy conservation.

The most important energy saving options are improved heat
insulation and building design, super efficient electrical machines and
drives, replacement of old style electrical heating systems by
renewable heat production (such as solar collectors) and a reduction
in energy consumption by vehicles used for goods and passenger
traffic. Industrialised countries, which currently use energy in the most
inefficient way, can reduce their consumption drastically without the
loss of either housing comfort or information and entertainment
electronics. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario uses energy saved in
OECD countries as a compensation for the increasing power
requirements in developing countries. The ultimate goal is stabilisation
of global energy consumption within the next two decades. At the
same time the aim is to create “energy equity” – shifting the current
one-sided waste of energy in the industrialised countries towards a
fairer worldwide distribution of efficiently used supply.

A dramatic reduction in primary energy demand compared to the
IEA’s “Reference Scenario” (see Chapter 6) – but with the same
GDP and population development - is a crucial prerequisite for
achieving a significant share of renewable energy sources in the
overall energy supply system, compensating for the phasing out of
nuclear energy and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.

30

step 2: structural changes

decentralised energy and large scale renewables In order to
achieve higher fuel efficiencies and reduce distribution losses, the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario makes extensive use of Decentralised
Energy (DE).This is energy generated at or near the point of use.

DE is connected to a local distribution network system, supplying
homes and offices, rather than the high voltage transmission
system. The proximity of electricity generating plant to consumers
allows any waste heat from combustion processes to be piped to
buildings nearby, a system known as cogeneration or combined heat
and power. This means that nearly all the input energy is put to use,
not just a fraction as with traditional centralised fossil fuel plant.

DE also includes stand-alone systems entirely separate from the
public networks, for example heat pumps, solar thermal panels or
biomass heating. These can all be commercialised at a domestic
level to provide sustainable low emission heating. Although DE
technologies can be considered ‘disruptive’ because they do not fit
the existing electricity market and system, with appropriate changes
they have the potential for exponential growth, promising ‘creative
destruction’ of the existing energy sector.

A huge proportion of global energy in 2050 will be produced by
decentralised energy sources, although large scale renewable energy
supply will still be needed in order to achieve a fast transition to a
renewables dominated system. Large offshore wind farms and
concentrating solar power (CSP) plants in the sunbelt regions of
the world will therefore have an important role to play.

cogeneration The increased use of combined heat and power
generation (CHP) will improve the supply system’s energy
conversion efficiency, whether using natural gas or biomass. In the
longer term, decreasing demand for heat and the large potential for
producing heat directly from renewable energy sources will limit the
further expansion of CHP.

renewable electricity The electricity sector will be the pioneer of
renewable energy utilisation. All renewable electricity technologies
have been experiencing steady growth over the past 20 to 30 years
of up to 35% annually and are expected to consolidate at a high
level between 2030 and 2050. By 2050, the majority of electricity
will be produced from renewable energy sources. Expected growth
of electricity use in transport will further promote the effective use
of renewable power generation technologies.

renewable heating In the heat supply sector, the contribution of
renewables will increase significantly. Growth rates are expected to
be similar to those of the renewable electricity sector. Fossil fuels
will be increasingly replaced by more efficient modern technologies,
in particular biomass, solar collectors and geothermal. By 2050,
renewable energy technologies will satisfy the major part of heating
and cooling demand.

transport Before new technologies such as hybrid or electric cars
or new fuels such as bio fuels can play a substantial role in the
transport sector, the existing large efficiency potentials have to be
exploited. In this study, biomass is primarily committed to
stationary applications; the use of bio fuels for transport is limited
by the availability of sustainably grown biomass15. Electric vehicles
will therefore play an even more important role in improving energy
efficiency in transport and substituting for fossil fuels.

Overall, to achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable
energy sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all
technologies is essential. Such a mobilisation depends on the
resource availability, cost reduction potential and technological
maturity. Besides technology driven solutions, lifestyle changes -
like simply driving less and using more public transport – have a
huge potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

optimised integration of renewable energy

Modification of the energy system will be necessary to
accommodate the significantly higher shares of renewable energy
expected under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. This is not unlike
what happened in the 1970s and 1980s, when most of the
centralised power plants now operating were constructed in OECD
countries. New high voltage power lines were built, night storage
heaters marketed and large electric-powered hot water boilers
installed in order to sell the electricity produced by nuclear and
coal-fired plants at night.

Several OECD countries have demonstrated that it is possible to
smoothly integrate a large proportion of decentralised energy,
including variable sources such as wind. A good example is
Denmark, which has the highest percentage of combined heat and
power generation and wind power in Europe. With strong political
support, 50% of electricity and 80% of district heat is now
supplied by cogeneration plants. The contribution of wind power has
reached more than 18% of Danish electricity demand. At certain
times, electricity generation from cogeneration and wind turbines
even exceeds demand. The load compensation required for grid
stability in Denmark is managed both through regulating the
capacity of the few large power stations and through import and
export to neighbouring countries. A three tier tariff system enables
balancing of power generation from the decentralised power plants
with electricity consumption on a daily basis.

It is important to optimise the energy system as a whole through
intelligent management by both producers and consumers, by an
appropriate mix of power stations and through new systems for
storing electricity.

appropriate power station mix: The power supply in OECD
countries is mostly generated by coal and – in some cases – nuclear
power stations, which are difficult to regulate. Modern gas power
stations, by contrast, are not only highly efficient but easier and
faster to regulate and thus better able to compensate for
fluctuating loads. Coal and nuclear power stations have lower fuel
and operating costs but comparably high investment costs. They
must therefore run round-the-clock as ‘base load’ in order to earn
back their investment. Gas power stations have lower investment
costs and are profitable even at low output, making them better
suited to balancing out the variations in supply from renewable
energy sources.

load management: The level and timing of demand for electricity
can be managed by providing consumers with financial incentives to
reduce or shut off their supply at periods of peak consumption.
Control technology can be used to manage the arrangement. This
system is already used for some large industrial customers. A
Norwegian power supplier even involves private household customers
by sending them a text message with a signal to shut down. Each
household can decide in advance whether or not they want to
participate. In Germany, experiments are being conducted with time
flexible tariffs so that washing machines operate at night and
refrigerators turn off temporarily during periods of high demand.

This type of load management has been simplified by advances in
communications technology. In Italy, for example, 30 million
innovative electricity counters have been installed to allow remote
meter reading and control of consumer and service information.
Many household electrical products or systems, such as
refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, storage heaters, water
pumps and air conditioning, can be managed either by temporary
shut-off or by rescheduling their time of operation, thus freeing up
electricity load for other uses.

the “virtual power station”  16

The rapid development of information technologies is helping to
pave the way for a decentralised energy supply based on
cogeneration plants, renewable energy systems and conventional
power stations. Manufacturers of small cogeneration plants already
offer internet interfaces which enable remote control of the system.
It is now possible for individual householders to control their
electricity and heat usage so that expensive electricity drawn from
the grid can be minimised – and the electricity demand profile is
smoothed. This is part of the trend towards the ‘smart house’ where
its mini cogeneration plant becomes an energy management centre.
We can go one step further than this with a ‘virtual power station’.
Virtual does not mean that the power station does not produce real
electricity. It refers to the fact that there is no large, spatially
located power station with turbines and generators. The hub of the
virtual power station is a control unit which processes data from
many decentralised power stations, compares them with predictions
of power demand, generation and weather conditions, retrieves the
available power market prices and then intelligently optimises the
overall power station activity. Some public utilities already use such
systems, integrating cogeneration plants, wind farms, photovoltaic
systems and other power plants. The virtual power station can also
link consumers into the management process.

generation management: Renewable electricity generation
systems can also be involved in load optimisation. Wind farms, for
example, can be temporarily switched off when too much power is
available on the network.

energy storage: Another method of balancing out electricity supply
and demand is through intermediate storage. This storage can be
decentralised, for example by the use of batteries, or centralised. So
far, pumped storage hydropower stations have been the main
method of storing large amounts of electric power. In a pumped
storage system, energy from power generation is stored in a lake
and then allowed to flow back when required, driving turbines and
generating electricity. 280 such pumped storage plants exist
worldwide. They already provide an important contribution to
security of supply, but their operation could be better adjusted to
the requirements of a future renewable energy system.

In the long term, other storage solutions are beginning to emerge.
One promising solution besides the use of hydrogen is the use of
compressed air. In these systems, electricity is used to compress air
into deep salt domes 600 metres underground and at pressures of
up to 70 bar. At peak times, when electricity demand is high, the air
is allowed to flow back out of the cavern and drive a turbine.
Although this system, known as CAES (Compressed Air Energy
Storage) currently still requires fossil fuel auxiliary power, a so-
called “adiabatic” plant is being developed which does not. To
achieve this, the heat from the compressed air is intermediately
stored in a giant heat store. Such a power station can achieve a
storage efficiency of 70%.

The forecasting of renewable electricity generation is also
continually improving. Regulating supply is particularly expensive
when it has to be found at short notice. However, prediction
techniques for wind power generation have become considerably
more accurate in recent years and are still being improved. The
demand for balancing supply will therefore decrease in the future.

“it is important to optimise the energy
system as a whole through intelligent
management by both producers
and consumers...”

The power grid network must also change in order to realise
decentralised structures with a high share of renewable energy.
Today’s grids are designed to transport power from a few
centralised power stations out to the passive consumers. A future
system must enable an active integration of consumers and
decentralised power generators and thus realise real time two-way
power and information flows. Large power stations will feed
electricity into the high voltage grid but small decentralised systems
such as solar, cogeneration and wind plants will deliver their power
into the low or medium voltage grid. In order to transport
electricity from renewable generation such as offshore wind farms
in remote areas (see box), a limited number of new high voltage
transmission lines will need to be constructed. These power lines will
also be available for cross-border power trade. Within the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, the share of variable renewable energy
sources is expected to reach about 10% of total electricity
generation by 2020 and about 35% by 2050.

case 1: a north sea electricity grid

A new Greenpeace report shows how a regionally integrated
approach to the large-scale development of offshore wind in the
North Sea could deliver reliable clean energy for millions of homes.
The ‘North Sea Electricity Grid [R]evolution’ report (September
2008) calls for the creation of an offshore network to enable the
smooth flow of electricity generated from renewable energy sources
into the power systems of seven different countries - the United
Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark
and Norway – at the same time enabling significant emissions
savings. The cost of developing the grid is expected to be between
€15 and 20 billion. This investment would not only allow the broad
integration of renewable energy but also unlock unprecedented
power trading opportunities and cost efficiency. In a recent
example, a new 600 kilometre-long power line between Norway and
the Netherlands cost €600 million to build, but is already
generating a daily cross-border trade valued at €800,000.

The grid would enable the efficient integration of renewable energy
into the power system across the whole North Sea region. By
aggregating power generation from wind farms spread across the
whole area, periods of very low or very high power flows would be
reduced to a negligible amount. A dip in wind power generation in
one area would be ‘balanced’ by higher production in another area,
even hundreds of kilometres away. Over a year, an installed offshore
wind power capacity of 68.4 GW in the North Sea would be able to
generate an estimated 247 TWh of electricity.

An offshore grid in the North Sea would also allow, for example, the
import of electricity from hydro power generation in Norway to the
British and UCTE (Central European) network. This could replace
thermal baseload plants and increase flexibility within a portfolio. In
addition, increased liquidity and trading facilities on the European
power markets will allow for a more efficient portfolio management.
The value of such an offshore therefore lies in its contribution to
increased security of supply, its function in aggregating the dispatch
of power from offshore wind farms and its role as a facilitator for
power exchange and trade between regions and power systems.

integration of consumers and
decentralised power generators...”

Wind energy is booming in the
EU. In 2007 alone, no less than
8550MW of wind turbines were
installed in the EU, which is
40% of all newly-installed
capacity. By 2020–2030, offshore
wind energy in the North Sea
could grow to 68,000MW and
supply 13 per cent of all current
electricity production of seven
North Sea countries. In order to
integrate the electricity from the
offshore wind farms, an offshore
grid will be required. Greenpeace
demands that the governments
of these seven countries and the
European Commission cooperate
to make this happen.

Energy is central to reducing poverty, providing major benefits in
the areas of health, literacy and equity. More than a quarter of the
world’s population has no access to modern energy services. In sub-
Saharan Africa, 80% of people have no electricity supply. For
cooking and heating, they depend almost exclusively on burning
biomass – wood, charcoal and dung.

Poor people spend up to a third of their income on energy, mostly
to cook food. Women in particular devote a considerable amount of
time to collecting, processing and using traditional fuel for cooking.
In India, two to seven hours each day can be devoted to the
collection of cooking fuel. This is time that could be spent on child
care, education or income generation. The World Health
Organisation estimates that 2.5 million women and young children
in developing countries die prematurely each year from breathing
the fumes from indoor biomass stoves.

The Millennium Development Goal of halving global poverty by 2015 will
not be reached without adequate energy to increase production, income
and education, create jobs and reduce the daily grind involved in having to
just survive. Halving hunger will not come about without energy for more
productive growing, harvesting, processing and marketing of food.

Improving health and reducing death rates will not happen without
energy for the refrigeration needed for clinics, hospitals and vaccination
campaigns. The world’s greatest child killer, acute respiratory infection,
will not be tackled without dealing with smoke from cooking fires in the
home. Children will not study at night without light in their homes. Clean
water will not be pumped or treated without energy.

The UN Commission on Sustainable Development argues that “to
implement the goal accepted by the international community of
halving the proportion of people living on less than US $1 per day
by 2015, access to affordable energy services is a prerequisite”.

the role of sustainable, clean renewable energy

To achieve the dramatic emissions cuts needed to avoid climate
change – in the order of 80% in OECD countries by 2050 – will
require a massive uptake of renewable energy. The targets for
renewable energy must be greatly expanded in industrialised
countries both to substitute for fossil fuel and nuclear generation
and to create the necessary economies of scale necessary for global
expansion. Within the Energy [R]evolution Scenario we assume that
modern renewable energy sources, such as solar collectors, solar
cookers and modern forms of bio energy, will replace inefficient,
traditional biomass use.

Moving from principles to action on energy supply and climate
change mitigation requires a long-term perspective. Energy
infrastructure takes time to build up; new energy technologies take
time to develop. Policy shifts often also need many years to have an
effect. Any analysis that seeks to tackle energy and environmental
issues therefore needs to look ahead at least half a century.

Scenarios are important in describing possible development paths,
to give decision-makers an overview of future perspectives and to
indicate how far they can shape the future energy system. Two
different scenarios are used here to characterise the wide range of
possible paths for the future energy supply system: a Reference
Scenario, reflecting a continuation of current trends and policies,
and the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, which is designed to achieve
a set of dedicated environmental policy targets.

The reference scenario is based on the Reference Scenario
published by the International Energy Agency in World Energy
Outlook 2007 (WEO 2007)18. This only takes existing international
energy and environmental policies into account. The assumptions
include, for example, continuing progress in electricity and gas
market reforms, the liberalisation of cross-border energy trade and
recent policies designed to combat environmental pollution. The
Reference Scenario does not include additional policies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. As the IEA’s scenario only covers a time
horizon up to 2030, it has been extended by extrapolating its key
macroeconomic indicators. This provides a baseline for comparison
with the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.

The energy [r]evolution scenario has a key target for the
reduction of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions down to a level of
around 10 Gigatonnes per year by 2050 in order for the increase in
global temperature to remain under +2°C. A second objective is the
global phasing out of nuclear energy. To achieve these targets, the
scenario is characterised by significant efforts to fully exploit the
large potential for energy efficiency. At the same time, all cost-
effective renewable energy sources are used for heat and electricity
generation as well as the production of bio fuels. The general
framework parameters for population and GDP growth remain
unchanged from the Reference Scenario.

These scenarios by no means claim to predict the future; they
simply describe two potential development paths out of the broad
range of possible ‘futures’. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario is
designed to indicate the efforts and actions required to achieve its
ambitious objectives and to illustrate the options we have at hand
to change our energy supply system into one that is sustainable.

scenario background The scenarios in this report were jointly
commissioned by Greenpeace and the European Renewable Energy
Council from the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics, part of the
German Aerospace Center (DLR). The supply scenarios were
calculated using the MESAP/PlaNet simulation model used for the
previous Energy [R]evolution study19. Energy demand projections
were developed by Ecofys Netherlands, based on an analysis of the
future potential for energy efficiency measures. The biomass
potential, using Greenpeace sustainability criteria, has been
developed especially for this scenario by the German Biomass
Research Centre. The future development pathway for car
technologies is based on a special report produced in 2008 by the
Institute of Vehicle Concepts, DLR for Greenpeace International.

energy efficiency study

The aim of the Ecofys study was to develop a low energy demand
scenario for the period 2005 to 2050 for the IEA regions as
defined in the World Energy Outlook report series. Calculations
were made for each decade from 2010 onwards. Energy demand
was split up into electricity and fuels. The sectors which were taken
into account were industry, transport and other consumers,
including households and services.

Under the low energy demand scenario, worldwide final energy
demand is reduced by 38% in 2050 in comparison to the Reference
Scenario, resulting in a final energy demand of 350 EJ
(ExaJoules). The energy savings are fairly equally distributed over
the three sectors of industry, transport and other uses. The most
important energy saving options are efficient passenger and freight
transport and improved heat insulation and building design. Chapter
11 provides more details about this study.

the future for cars

The Institute of Vehicle Concepts in Stuttgart, Germany has
developed a global scenario for cars covering ten world regions. The
aim was to produce a demanding but feasible scenario to lower
global car CO2 emissions within the context of the overall objectives
of this report. The approach takes into account a vast range of
technical measures to reduce the energy consumption of vehicles,
but also considers the dramatic increase in vehicle ownership and
annual mileage taking place in developing countries. The major
parameters are vehicle technology, alternative fuels, changes in
sales of different vehicle sizes (segment split) and changes in
vehicle kilometres travelled (modal split).

The scenario assumes that a large share of renewable electricity
will be available in the future. A combination of ambitious efforts
towards higher efficiency in vehicle technologies, a major switch to
grid-connected electric vehicles and incentives for vehicle users to
save carbon dioxide lead to the conclusion that it is possible to
reduce CO2 emissions from ‘well-to-wheel’ in 2050 by roughly
25%20 compared to 1990 and 40% compared to 2005.

By 2050, 60% of the final energy used in transport will still come
from fossil sources, mainly gasoline and diesel. Renewable
electricity will cover 25%, bio fuels 13% and hydrogen 2%. Total
energy consumption in 2050 will be similar to the consumption in
2005, however, in spite of enormous increases in fuel use in some
regions of the world.

The peak in global CO2 emissions from transport occurs between
2010 and 2015. From 2010 onwards, new legislation in the US and
Europe will contribute to breaking the upwards trend in emissions.
From 2020, the effect of introducing grid-connected electric cars can
be clearly seen. Chapter 13 provides more details about this report.

the global potential for sustainable bio energy

As part of the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, Greenpeace
commissioned the German Biomass Research Centre (the former
Institute for Energy and Environment) to look at the worldwide
potential for energy crops up to 2050. A summary of this report
can be found in Chapter 8.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

main scenario assumptions

Development of a global energy scenario requires the use of a multi-
region model in order to reflect the significant structural differences
between energy supply systems. The International Energy Agency
breakdown of world regions, as used in the ongoing series of World
Energy Outlook reports, has been chosen because the IEA also
provides the most comprehensive global energy statistics21.

The previous Energy [R]evolution Scenario used three regions to cover
Asia: East Asia, South Asia and China. In line with WEO 2007, this new
edition maintains the three region approach, but assesses China and
India separately and aggregates the remaining Non-OECD countries in
Asia under ‘Developing Asia’. The loss of comparability with the previous
study is outweighed by the ability to compare the new results with
current IEA reports and still provides a reasonable analysis of Asia in
terms of population and economic development. The definitions of the
world regions are shown in Figure 5.1.

1. population development

One important underlying factor in energy scenario building is
future population development. Population growth affects the size
and composition of energy demand, directly and through its impact
on economic growth and development. World Energy Outlook 2007
uses the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
projections for population development. For this study the most
recent population projections from UNDP up to 2050 are applied22.

Table 5.1 summarises this study’s assumptions on world population
development. The world’s population is expected to grow by 0.77 % on
average over the period 2005 to 2050, from 6.5 billion people in 2005 to
more than 9.1 billion in 2050. Population growth will slow over the
projection period, from 1.2% during 2005-2010 to 0.4% during 2040-
2050. However, the updated projections show an increase in population of
almost 300 million compared to the previous edition. This will further
increase the demand for energy. The population of the developing regions
will continue to grow most rapidly. The Transition Economies will face a
continuous decline, followed after a short while by the OECD Pacific
countries. OECD Europe and OECD North America are expected to
maintain their population, with a peak in around 2020/2030 and a slight
decline afterwards. The share of the population living in today’s Non-
OECD countries will increase from the current 82% to 86% in 2050.
China’s contribution to world population will drop from 20% today to
15% in 2050. Africa will remain the region with the highest growth rate,
leading to a share of 21% of world population in 2050.

Satisfying the energy needs of a growing population in the developing
regions of the world in an environmentally friendly manner is a key
challenge for achieving a global sustainable energy supply.

2. economic growth

Economic growth is a key driver for energy demand. Since 1971, each
1% increase in global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been
accompanied by a 0.6% increase in primary energy consumption. The
decoupling of energy demand and GDP growth is therefore a prerequisite
for reducing demand in the future. Most global energy/economic/
environmental models constructed in the past have relied on market
exchange rates to place countries in a common currency for estimation
and calibration. This approach has been the subject of considerable
discussion in recent years, and the alternative of purchasing power parity
(PPP) exchange rates has been proposed. Purchasing power parities
compare the costs in different currencies of a fixed basket of traded and
non-traded goods and services and yield a widely-based measure of the
standard of living. This is important in analysing the main drivers of
energy demand or for comparing energy intensities among countries.

Although PPP assessments are still relatively imprecise compared to
statistics based on national income and product trade and national
price indexes, they are considered to provide a better basis for global
scenario development.23 Thus all data on economic development in
WEO 2007 refers to purchasing power adjusted GDP. However, as
WEO 2007 only covers the time period up to 2030, the projections
for 2030-2050 are based on our own estimates.

Prospects for GDP growth have increased considerably compared to
the previous study, whilst underlying growth trends continue much the
same. GDP growth in all regions is expected to slow gradually over the
coming decades. World GDP is assumed to grow on average by 3.6%
per year over the period 2005-2030, compared to 3.3% from 1971 to
2002, and on average by 3.3 % per year over the entire modelling
period. China and India are expected to grow faster than other
regions, followed by the Developing Asia countries, Africa and the
Transition Economies. The Chinese economy will slow as it becomes
more mature, but will nonetheless become the largest in the world in
PPP terms early in the 2020s. GDP in OECD Europe and OECD
Pacific is assumed to grow by around 2% per year over the projection
period, while economic growth in OECD North America is expected to
be slightly higher. The OECD share of global PPP-adjusted GDP will
decrease from 55% in 2005 to 29% in 2050.

3. fossil fuel and biomass price projections

The recent dramatic increase in global oil prices has resulted in much
higher forward price projections for fossil fuels. Under the 2004 ‘high
oil and gas price’ scenario from the European Commission, for
example, an oil price of just $34 per barrel was assumed in 2030.
More recent projections of oil prices in 2030 range from the IEA’s
$200662/bbl ($200560/bbl) (WEO 2007) up to $2006119/bbl
($2005115/bbl) in the ‘high price’ scenario of the US Energy
Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2008.

Since the last Energy [R]evolution study was published, however,
the price of oil has moved over $100/bbl for the first time (at the
end of 2007), and in July 2008 reached a record high of more than
$140/bbl. Although oil prices fell back to $100/bbl in September
2008, the above projections might still be considered too
conservative. Considering the growing global demand for oil and gas
we have assumed a price development path for fossil fuels in which
the price of oil reaches $120/bbl by 2030 and $140/bbl in 2050.

As the supply of natural gas is limited by the availability of pipeline
infrastructure, there is no world market price for natural gas. In
most regions of the world the gas price is directly tied to the price
of oil. Gas prices are assumed to increase to $20-25/GJ by 2050.

4. cost of CO2 emissions

Assuming that a CO2 emissions trading system is established in all world
regions in the long term, the cost of CO2 allowances needs to be included
in the calculation of electricity generation costs. Projections of emissions
costs are even more uncertain than energy prices, and available studies
span a broad range of future CO2 cost estimates. As in the previous
Energy [R]evolution study we assume CO2 costs of $10/tCO2 in 2010,
rising to $50/tCO2 in 2050. Additional CO2 costs are applied in Kyoto
Protocol Non-Annex B (developing) countries only after 2020.

5. power plant investment costs

fossil fuel technologies and carbon capture and storage (CCS)
While the fossil fuel power technologies in use today for coal, gas,
lignite and oil are established and at an advanced stage of market
development, further cost reduction potentials are assumed. The
potential for cost reductions is limited, however, and will be
achieved mainly through an increase in efficiency, bringing down
investment costs24.

There is much speculation about the potential for carbon capture
and storage (CCS) technology to mitigate the effect of fossil fuel
consumption on climate change, even though the technology is still
under development.

CCS is a means of trapping CO2 from fossil fuels, either before or
after they are burned, and ‘storing’ (effectively disposing of) it in
the sea or beneath the surface of the Earth. There are currently
three different methods of capturing CO2: ‘pre-combustion’, ‘post-
combustion’ and ‘oxyfuel combustion’. However, development is at a
very early stage and CCS will not be implemented - in the best case
- before 2020 and will probably not become commercially viable as
a possible effective mitigation option until 2030.

Cost estimates for CCS vary considerably, depending on factors
such as power station configuration, technology, fuel costs, size of
project and location. One thing is certain, however, CCS is
expensive. It requires significant funds to construct the power
stations and the necessary infrastructure to transport and store
carbon. The IPCC assesses costs at $15-75 per ton of captured
25, while a recent US Department of Energy report found
CO2
installing carbon capture systems to most modern plants resulted in
a near doubling of costs26. These costs are estimated to increase the
price of electricity in a range from 21-91%27.

Pipeline networks will also need to be constructed to move CO2 to
storage sites. This is likely to require a considerable outlay of
capital28. Costs will vary depending on a number of factors,
including pipeline length, diameter and manufacture from
corrosion-resistant steel, as well as the volume of CO2 to be
transported. Pipelines built near population centres or on difficult
terrain, such as marshy or rocky ground, are more expensive29.

The IPCC estimates a cost range for pipelines of $1-8/ton of CO2
transported. A United States Congressional Research Services
report calculated capital costs for an 11 mile pipeline in the
Midwestern region of the US at approximately $6 million. The same
report estimates that a dedicated interstate pipeline network in
North Carolina would cost upwards of $5 billion due to the limited
geological sequestration potential in that part of the country30.
Storage and subsequent monitoring and verification costs are
estimated by the IPCC to range from $0.5-8/tCO2 injected and
$0.1-0.3/tCO2 injected, respectively. The overall cost of CCS could
therefore serve as a major barrier to its deployment31.

For the above reasons, CCS power plants are not included in our
financial analysis.

Table 5.4 summarises our assumptions on the technical and
economic parameters of future fossil-fuelled power plant
technologies. In spite of growing raw material prices, we assume
that further technical innovation will result in a moderate reduction
of future investment costs as well as improved power plant
efficiencies. These improvements are, however, outweighed by the
expected increase in fossil fuel prices, resulting in a significant rise
in electricity generation costs.

6. cost projections for renewable energy technologies

The range of renewable energy technologies available today display
marked differences in terms of their technical maturity, costs and
development potential. Whereas hydro power has been widely used
for decades, other technologies, such as the gasification of biomass,
have yet to find their way to market maturity. Some renewable
sources by their very nature, including wind and solar power, provide
a variable supply, requiring a revised coordination with the grid
network. But although in many cases these are ‘distributed’
technologies - their output being generated and used locally to the
consumer - the future will also see large-scale applications in the
form of offshore wind parks, photovoltaic power plants or
concentrating solar power stations.

By using the individual advantages of the different technologies, and
linking them with each other, a wide spectrum of available options
can be developed to market maturity and integrated step by step
into the existing supply structures. This will eventually provide a
complementary portfolio of environmentally friendly technologies
for heat and power supply and the provision of transport fuels.

Many of the renewable technologies employed today are at a
relatively early stage of market development. As a result, the costs
of electricity, heat and fuel production are generally higher than
those of competing conventional systems - a reminder that the
external (environmental and social) costs of conventional power
production are not included in the market prices. It is expected,
however, that compared with conventional technologies large cost
reductions can be achieved through technical advances,
manufacturing improvements and large-scale production. Especially
when developing long-term scenarios spanning periods of several
decades, the dynamic trend of cost developments over time plays a
crucial role in identifying economically sensible expansion strategies.

To identify long-term cost developments, learning curves have been
applied which reflect the correlation between cumulative production
volumes of a particular technology and a reduction in its costs. For
many technologies, the learning factor (or progress ratio) falls in the
range between 0.75 for less mature systems to 0.95 and higher for
well-established technologies. A learning factor of 0.9 means that
costs are expected to fall by 10% every time the cumulative output
from the technology doubles. Empirical data shows, for example,
that the learning factor for PV solar modules has been fairly
constant at 0.8 over 30 years whilst that for wind energy varies
from 0.75 in the UK to 0.94 in the more advanced German market.

Assumptions on future costs for renewable electricity technologies
in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario are derived from a review of
learning curve studies, for example by Lena Neij and others32, from
the analysis of recent technology foresight and road mapping
studies, including the European Commission funded NEEDS (New
Energy Externalities Developments for Sustainability)33 project or
the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives 2008, and a discussion
with experts from the renewable energy industry.

“large cost reductions can be achieved
through technical advances, manufacturing
improvements and large-scale production.”

photovoltaics (pv)

concentrating solar power (csp)

The worldwide photovoltaics (PV) market has been growing at over
35% per annum in recent years and the contribution it can make to
electricity generation is starting to become significant. Development
work is focused on improving existing modules and system
components by increasing their energy efficiency and reducing
material usage. Technologies like PV thin film (using alternative
semiconductor materials) or dye sensitive solar cells are developing
quickly and present a huge potential for cost reduction. The mature
technology crystalline silicon, with a proven lifetime of 30 years, is
continually increasing its cell and module efficiency (by 0.5%
annually), whereas the cell thickness is rapidly decreasing (from
230 to 180 microns over the last five years). Commercial module
efficiency varies from 14 to 21% depending on silicon quality and
fabrication process.

The learning factor for PV modules has been fairly constant over
the last 30 years, with a cost reduction of 20% each time the
installed capacity doubles, indicating a high rate of technical
learning. Assuming a globally installed capacity of 1,600 GW by
between 2030 and 2040, and with an electricity output of 2,600
TWh, we can expect that generation costs of around 5-10
cents/kWh (depending on the region) will be achieved. During the
following five to ten years, PV will become competitive with retail
electricity prices in many parts of the world and competitive with
fossil fuel costs by 2050. The importance of photovoltaics comes
from its decentralised/centralised character, its flexibility for use in
an urban environment and huge potential for cost reduction.

Solar thermal ‘concentrating’ power stations (CSP) can only use
direct sunlight and are therefore dependent on high irradiation
locations. North Africa, for example, has a technical potential
which far exceeds local demand. The various solar thermal
technologies (parabolic trough, power towers and parabolic dish
concentrators) offer good prospects for further development and
cost reductions. Because of their more simple design, ‘Fresnel’
collectors are considered as an option for additional cost reduction.
The efficiency of central receiver systems can be increased by
producing compressed air at a temperature of up to 1,000°C, which
is then used to run a combined gas and steam turbine.

Thermal storage systems are a key component for reducing CSP
electricity generation costs. The Spanish Andasol 1 plant, for
example, is equipped with molten salt storage with a capacity of
7.5 hours. A higher level of full load operation can be realised by
using a thermal storage system and a large collector field. Although
this leads to higher investment costs, it reduces the cost of
electricity generation.

Depending on the level of irradiation and mode of operation, it is
expected that long term future electricity generation costs of 6-10
cents/kWh can be achieved. This presupposes rapid market
introduction in the next few years.

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

wind power

biomass

Within a short period of time, the dynamic development of wind
power has resulted in the establishment of a flourishing global
market. The world’s largest wind turbines, several of which have
been installed in Germany, have a capacity of 6 MW. While
favourable policy incentives have made Europe the main driver for
the global wind market, in 2007 more than half of the annual
market was outside Europe. This trend is likely to continue. The
boom in demand for wind power technology has nonetheless led to
supply constraints. As a consequence, the cost of new systems has
stagnated or even increased. Because of the continuous expansion
of production capacities, the industry expects to resolve the
bottlenecks in the supply chain over the next few years. Taking into
account market development projections, learning curve analysis
and industry expectations, we assume that investment costs for
wind turbines will reduce by 30% for onshore and 50% for
offshore installations up to 2050.

The crucial factor for the economics of biomass utilisation is the
cost of the feedstock, which today ranges from a negative cost for
waste wood (based on credit for waste disposal costs avoided)
through inexpensive residual materials to the more expensive energy
crops. The resulting spectrum of energy generation costs is
correspondingly broad. One of the most economic options is the use
of waste wood in steam turbine combined heat and power (CHP)
plants. Gasification of solid biomass, on the other hand, which
opens up a wide range of applications, is still relatively expensive.
In the long term it is expected that favourable electricity production
costs will be achieved by using wood gas both in micro CHP units
(engines and fuel cells) and in gas-and-steam power plants. Great
potential for the utilisation of solid biomass also exists for heat
generation in both small and large heating centres linked to local
heating networks. Converting crops into ethanol and ‘bio diesel’
made from rapeseed methyl ester (RME) has become increasingly
important in recent years, for example in Brazil, the USA and
Europe. Processes for obtaining synthetic fuels from biogenic
synthesis gases will also play a larger role.

A large potential for exploiting modern technologies exists in Latin
and North America, Europe and the Transition Economies, either in
stationary appliances or the transport sector. In the long term
Europe and the Transition Economies will realise 20-50% of the
potential for biomass from energy crops, whilst biomass use in all
the other regions will have to rely on forest residues, industrial wood
waste and straw. In Latin America, North America and Africa in
particular, an increasing residue potential will be available.

In other regions, such as the Middle East and all Asian regions, the
additional use of biomass is restricted, either due to a generally low
availability or already high traditional use. For the latter, using
modern, more efficient technologies will improve the sustainability
of current usage and have positive side effects, such as reducing
indoor pollution and the heavy workloads currently associated with
traditional biomass use.

geothermal

ocean energy

Geothermal energy has long been used worldwide for supplying
heat, and since the beginning of the last century for electricity
generation as well. Geothermally generated electricity was
previously limited to sites with specific geological conditions, but
further intensive research and development work has enabled the
potential areas to be widened. In particular the creation of large
underground heat exchange surfaces (Enhanced Geothermal
Systems - EGS) and the improvement of low temperature power
conversion, for example with the Organic Rankine Cycle, open up
the possibility of producing geothermal electricity anyywhere.
Advanced heat and power cogeneration plants will also improve the
economics of geothermal electricity.

As a large part of the costs for a geothermal power plant come
from deep underground drilling, further development of innovative
drilling technology is expected. Assuming a global average market
growth for geothermal power capacity of 9% per year up to 2020,
adjusting to 4% beyond 2030, the result would be a cost reduction
potential of 50% by 2050:

(cid:129) for conventional geothermal power, from 7 cents/kWh to about

2 cents/kWh.

(cid:129) for EGS, despite the presently high figures (about 20 cents/kWh),
electricity production costs - depending on the payments for heat
supply - are expected to come down to around 5 cents/kWh in
the long term.

Because of its non-fluctuating supply and a grid load operating
almost 100% of the time, geothermal energy is considered to be a
key element in a future supply structure based on renewable sources.
Until now we have just used a marginal part of the geothermal
heating and cooling potential. Shallow geothermal drilling makes
possible the delivery of heating and cooling at any time anywhere,
and can be used for thermal energy storage.

Ocean energy, particularly offshore wave energy, is a significant
resource, and has the potential to satisfy an important percentage of
electricity supply worldwide. Globally, the potential of ocean energy
has been estimated at around 90,000 TWh/year. The most significant
advantages are the vast availability and high predictability of the
resource and a technology with very low visual impact and no CO2
emissions. Many different concepts and devices have been developed,
including taking energy from the tides, waves, currents and both
thermal and saline gradient resources. Many of them are in an
advanced phase of R&D, large scale prototypes have been deployed
in real sea conditions and some have reached pre-market
deployment. There are a few grid connected, fully operational
commercial wave and tidal generating plants.

The cost of energy from initial tidal and wave energy farms has been
estimated to be in the range of 15-55 €cents/kWh, and for initial
tidal stream farms in the range of 11-22 €cents/kWh. Generation
costs of 10-25 €cents/kWh are expected by 2020. Key areas for
development will include concept design, optimisation of the device
configuration, reduction of capital costs by exploring the use of
alternative structural materials, economies of scale and learning
from operation. According to the latest research findings, the
learning factor is estimated to be 10-15% for offshore wave and
5-10% for tidal stream. In the medium term, ocean energy has the
potential to become one of the most competitive and cost effective
forms of generation. In the next few years a dynamic market
penetration is expected, following a similar curve to wind energy.

Because of the early development stage any future cost estimates
for ocean energy systems are uncertain, and no learning curve data
is available. Present cost estimates are based on analysis from the
European NEEDS project34.

hydro power

summary of renewable energy cost development

Hydropower is a mature technology with a significant part of its
potential already exploited. There is still, however, some potential
left both for new schemes (especially small scale run-of-river
projects with little or no reservoir impoundment) and for
repowering of existing sites. The significance of hydropower is also
likely to be encouraged by the increasing need for flood control and
maintenance of water supply during dry periods. The future is in
sustainable hydropower which makes an effort to integrate plants
with river ecosystems while reconciling ecology with economically
attractive power generation.

Figure 5.4 summarises the cost trends for renewable energy
technologies as derived from the respective learning curves. It should
be emphasised that the expected cost reduction is basically not a
function of time, but of cumulative capacity, so dynamic market
development is required. Most of the technologies will be able to
reduce their specific investment costs to between 30% and 70% of
current levels by 2020, and to between 20% and 60% once they
have achieved full development (after 2040).

Reduced investment costs for renewable energy technologies lead
directly to reduced heat and electricity generation costs, as shown in
Figure 5.5. Generation costs today are around 8 to 25 €cents/kWh
(10-25 $cents/kWh) for the most important technologies, with the
exception of photovoltaics. In the long term, costs are expected to
converge at around 4 to 10 €cents/kWh (5-12 $cents/kWh). These
estimates depend on site-specific conditions such as the local wind
regime or solar irradiation, the availability of biomass at reasonable
prices or the credit granted for heat supply in the case of combined
heat and power generation.

The development of future global energy demand is determined
by three key factors:

(cid:129) Population development: the number of people consuming energy

or using energy services.

(cid:129) Economic development, for which Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) is the most commonly used indicator. In general,
an increase in GDP triggers an increase in energy demand.

(cid:129) Energy intensity: how much energy is required

to produce a unit of GDP.

Both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios are based
on the same projections of population and economic development.
The future development of energy intensity, however, differs between
the two, taking into account the measures to increase energy
efficiency under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.

An increase in economic activity and a growing population does not
necessarily have to result in an equivalent increase in energy
demand. There is still a large potential for exploiting energy
efficiency measures. Under the Reference Scenario, we assume that
energy intensity will be reduced by 1.25% on average per year,
leading to a reduction in final energy demand per unit of GDP of
about 56% between 2005 and 2050. Under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, it is assumed that active policy and technical
support for energy efficiency measures will lead to an even higher
reduction in energy intensity of almost 73%.

global: development of energy demand by sector

Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth
and energy intensity results in future development pathways for the
world’s energy demand. These are shown in Figure 6.4 for both the
Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference
Scenario, total primary energy demand almost doubles from
474,900 PJ/a in 2005 to 867,700 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, demand increases up to 2015 by 16% and
decreases to close to today’s level of 480,860 PJ in 2050.

The accelerated increase in energy efficiency, which is a crucial
prerequisite for achieving a sufficiently large share of renewable
energy sources in our energy supply, is beneficial not only for the
environment but also for economics. Taking into account the full
service life, in most cases the implementation of energy efficiency
measures saves costs compared to an additional energy supply. The
mobilisation of cost-effective energy saving potential leads directly
to a reduction in costs. A dedicated energy efficiency strategy thus
also helps to compensate in part for the additional costs required
during the market introduction phase of renewable energy sources.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected
to increase disproportionately, with households and services the main
source of growing consumption (see Figure 6.5). With the exploitation of
efficiency measures, however, an even higher increase can be avoided,
leading to electricity demand of around 30,800 TWh/a in the year 2050.
Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the
generation of about 12,800 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demand can
be achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices
using the best available technology in all demand sectors. Employment of
solar architecture in both residential and commercial buildings will help
to curb the growing demand for active air-conditioning.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be reduced

(see Figure 6.6). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption
equivalent to 46,000 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. As
a result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residential
buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and ‘passive
houses’ for new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energy
services will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will increase by 12 % to around
94,000 PJ/a in 2015 and will fall slightly afterwards down to
83,300 PJ/a in 2050, saving 100,000 PJ compared to the Reference
Scenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly
efficient vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail
and by changes in mobility-related behaviour patterns.

global: electricity generation

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a
dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing share
of renewable electricity. This will compensate for the phasing out of
nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants
required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 77% of the electricity
produced worldwide will come from renewable energy sources.
‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV – will
contribute over 60% of electricity generation. The following strategy
paves the way for a future renewable energy supply:

(cid:129) The phasing out of nuclear energy and rising electricity demand

will be met initially by bringing into operation new highly efficient
gas-fired combined-cycle power plants, plus an increasing
capacity of wind turbines, biomass, concentrating solar power
plants and solar photovoltaics. In the long term, wind will be the
most important single source of electricity generation.

(cid:129) Solar energy, hydro and biomass will make substantial contributions
to electricity generation. In particular, as non-fluctuating renewable
energy sources, hydro and solar thermal, combined with efficient
heat storage, are important elements in the overall generation mix.

(cid:129) The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 1,000 GW to 9,100 GW in 2050. Increasing
renewable capacity by a factor of nine within the next 42 years
requires political support and well-designed policy instruments,
however. There will be a considerable demand for investment in
new production capacity over the next 20 years. As investment
cycles in the power sector are long, decisions on restructuring the
world’s energy supply system need to be taken now.

To achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable energy
sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is of
great importance. This mobilisation depends on technical potentials,
cost reduction and technological maturity. Figure 21 shows the
comparative evolution of the different renewable technologies over
time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the major
contributors to the growing market share. After 2020, the
continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from
biomass, photovoltaic and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

global: future costs of electricity generation

global: heat and cooling supply

Figure 27 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs of electricity
generation compared to the Reference Scenario. This difference will be less
than 0.2 cents/kWh up to 2020. Note that any increase in fossil fuel prices
beyond the projection given in Table 6.1 will reduce the gap between the
two scenarios. Because of the lower CO2 intensity of electricity generation,
by 2020 electricity generation costs will become economically favourable
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, and by 2050 generation costs
will be more than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.

Due to growing demand, we face a significant increase in society’s
expenditure on electricity supply. Under the Reference Scenario, the
unchecked growth in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the
cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from
today’s $1,750 billion per year to more than $7,300 bn in 2050. Figure
28 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with
global CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and
relieve the economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency
and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for
electricity supply that are one third lower than in the Reference
Scenario. It becomes clear that pursuing stringent environmental targets
in the energy sector also pays off in terms of economics.

Development of renewables in the heat supply sector raises
different issues. Today, renewables provide 24%of primary energy
demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming from the use
of biomass. The lack of district heating networks is a severe
structural barrier to the large scale utilisation of geothermal and
solar thermal energy. Past experience shows that it is easier to
implement effective support instruments in the grid-connected
electricity sector than in the heat market, with its multitude of
different actors. Dedicated support instruments are required to
ensure a dynamic development.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables satisfy more than
70% of the total global heating demand in 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures can decrease the current per capita

demand for heat supply by 30% in spite of improving living standards.

(cid:129) For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well
as geothermal energy will increasingly substitute for fossil
fuel-fired systems.

(cid:129) A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications will lead to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

global: primary energy consumption

In the transport sector, it is assumed that under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, due to fast growing demand for services,
energy demand will further increase up to 2015. After that demand
will decrease, falling to below its current level in 2050. Compared
to the Reference Scenario, energy demand is reduced by 54%. This
reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient
vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by
changes in mobility-related behaviour patterns. By implementing
attractive alternatives to individual cars, the amount of cars will
grow more slowly than in the Reference Scenario. In 2050,
electricity will provide 24% of the transport sector’s total energy
demand, while 61% of the demand will be covered by fossil fuels.

figure 6.12: global: transport under the two scenarios
(‘EFFICIENCY’ = REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE REFERENCE SCENARIO)

Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting
primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is
shown in Figure 6.13. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall
energy demand will be reduced by almost 45% in 2050. More than half
of the remaining demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.
Note that because of the ‘efficiency method’ used for the calculation of
primary energy consumption, which postulates that the amount of
electricity generation from hydro, wind, solar and geothermal energy
equals the primary energy consumption, the share of renewables seems
to be lower than their actual importance as energy suppliers.

development of global CO2 emissions

Whilst worldwide emissions of CO2 will almost double under the
Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they
will decrease from 24,350 million tonnes in 2005 to 10,600 m/t in
2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 3.7 tonnes to
1.15 t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing
demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the
long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable
electricity will even reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector.
With a share of 35% of total CO2 in 2050, the power sector will
fall significantly but remain the largest source of emissions,
followed by transport.

global: regional breakdown of CO2 emissions in 2050

global: CO2 emissions by source

With effective efficiency standards OECD countries can reduce
their per capita energy consumption significantly while developing
countries could slow down their massive increase in energy demand.
At the same time renewable energy sources can increase there
share in the energy mix to over 50 % globally. In some regions, the
renewable energy share will be well above 80%, while economic
growth is still maintained over the entire scenario period.

With this shift, annual per capita CO2 emissions will fall from their
current level of about 3.6 tonnes to 1.15 tonnes in 2050. OECD
countries will be able to reduce their CO2 emissions by about 80%.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario for the USA shows that it is
possible to reduce per capita CO2 emissions from 19 tonnes now to
3 tonnes by 2050. For the EU-27 countries, per capita emissions
will fall from 8 to just under 2 tonnes per capita. Developing
countries such as the Philippines could even keep per capita
emissions at their current level of about 1 tonne of CO2 until 2050,
while maintaining economic growth. A combination of efficiency
standards and renewable energy development proves to be the most
cost effective way to cut CO2 emissions and increase security of
supply by reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports.

Under the global Energy [R]evolution Scenario, China and India
will emit almost half of the remaining CO2 emissions in 2050, while
all OECD countries together will have a share of about 22%.

In 2050, coal will be by far the largest source of CO2, mainly
from coal-fired power stations in China and India as well as power
stations in other developing countries. Since those emissions are
mainly from power stations built between 2000 and 2015, and the
average lifetime of a coal-fired power plant is calculated at 40
years, in order to achieve the projected reduction, the construction
of new coal power stations must end across most of the world by
2015 and in developing countries by 2020.

The second biggest emitter is oil, mainly from the remaining oil
used in the transport sector.

Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth
and energy intensity results in future development pathways for
North America’s energy demand. These are shown in Figure 6.18
for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under
the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand increases by
more than 40% from the current 115,900 PJ/a to 164,300 PJ/a
in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, primary energy
demand decreases by 33% compared to current consumption and is
expected by 2050 to reach 77,700 PJ/a.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected
to decrease in the industry sector, but to grow in the transport as well as
in the residential and service sectors (see Figure 6.19). Total electricity
demand will rise to 5,730 TWh/a in the year 2050. Compared to the
Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about
2,460 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demand can be achieved in
particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using the best
available technology in all demand sectors. Employment of solar

architecture in both residential and commercial buildings will help to
curb the growing demand for active air-conditioning.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, demand for heat supply will grow up to
2030, but after that can even be reduced to below the current level (see
Figure 6.20). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption
equivalent to 7,850 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. As
a result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residential
buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and ‘passive
houses’ for new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energy
services will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will decrease by half to 16,720 PJ/a
by 2050, saving 65% compared to the Reference Scenario. This
reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient
vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by
changes in mobility-related behaviour patterns.

oecd north america: electricity generation

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a
dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing share
of renewable electricity. This will compensate for the phasing out of
nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants
required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 94% of the electricity
produced in OECD North America will come from renewable energy
sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV
– will contribute over 85% of electricity generation.

Figure 6.22 shows the comparative evolution of the different
renewable technologies in OECD North America over time. Up to
2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors to
the growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of
wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass,
photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

oecd north america: future costs of electricity generation

oecd north america: heat and cooling supply

Figure 6.23 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs
of electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. This
difference will be less than 0.4 cents/kWh up to 2020. Because of
the lower CO2 intensity of electricity generation, by 2020 electricity
generation costs will become economically favourable under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, and by 2050 generation costs will be
more than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.

Under the Reference Scenario, on the other hand, unchecked growth in
demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions
result in total electricity supply costs rising from today’s $420 billion per
year to more than $1,350 bn in 2050. Figure 6.24 shows that the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with OECD North
America CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and
relieve the economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency and
shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for
electricity supply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Today, renewables provide 11% of North America’s primary energy
demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming from the use
of biomass. The lack of district heating networks is a severe
structural barrier to the large scale utilisation of geothermal and
solar thermal energy. Dedicated support instruments are required to
ensure a dynamic development.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 69% of North
America’s total heating demand in 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently growing

demand for heating and cooling, in spite of improving living standards.

(cid:129) For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for fossil fuel-
fired systems.

(cid:129) A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications will lead to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

oecd north america: transport

oecd north america: primary energy consumption

A key initiative in North America is to introduce incentives to drive
smaller cars, which today are virtually non-existant. In addition, a
shift to efficient modes of transport like rail, light rail and bus is
important, especially in the expanding large metropolitan areas.
Together with the rising price of fossil fuels, these changes reduce the
huge growth in car sales projected by the Reference Scenario. In the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, the car fleet still grows by 20% from
the year 2000 to 2050. However the energy demand of the transport
sector is reduced by 47%. Highly efficient propulsion technology,
including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery-electric powertrains, will
bring large efficiency gains. A quarter of the transport energy
demand by 2050 is covered by electricity, 30% by bio fuels.

2050. Around 66% of the remaining demand in North America will
be covered by renewable energy sources.

oecd north america: development of CO2 emissions

Whilst North America’s emissions of CO2 will increase by 42%
under the Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario they will decrease from 6,430 million tonnes in 2005 to
1,060 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from
14.7 tonnes to 1.8 t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy
and increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the
electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased
use of renewable electricity in the transport sector will even reduce
CO2 emissions there. With a share of 46% of total CO2, the
transport sector will be the largest source of emissions in 2050.

latin america: energy demand by sector

Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth
and energy intensity results in future development pathways for
Latin America’s energy demand. These are shown in Figure 6.29 for
both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the
Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand more than
doubles from the current 21,140 PJ/a to 52,300 PJ/a in 2050. In
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, a smaller 54% increase on
current consumption is expected by 2050, reaching 32,500 PJ/a.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is
expected to increase disproportionately, with households and services
the main source of growing consumption. This is due to wider access to
energy services in developing countries (see Figure 6.30). With the
exploitation of efficiency measures, however, an even higher increase

can be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around 2,150 TWh/a
in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures
avoid the generation of about 660 TWh/a. This reduction can be
achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices.
Employment of solar architecture in both residential and commercial
buildings will help to curb the growing demand for air-conditioning.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can
even be reduced (see Figure 6.31). Compared to the Reference
Scenario, consumption equivalent to 2,400 PJ/a is avoided through
efficiency gains by 2050. In the transport sector, it is assumed
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will
increase by a fifth to 6,100 PJ/a by 2050, saving 50% compared
to the Reference Scenario.

latin america: electricity generation

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by
an increasing share of renewable electricity. By 2050, 95% of the
electricity produced in Latin America will come from renewable
energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal
energy and PV – will contribute more than 60% of electricity
generation. The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies
will grow from the current 139 GW to 695 GW in 2050 - increasing
renewable capacity by a factor of five within the next 42 years.

Figure 6.33 shows the comparative evolution of the different renewable
technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain
the main contributors to the growing market share. After 2020, the
continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from
biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

latin america: future costs of electricity generation

latin america: heat and cooling supply

Figure 6.34 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases the
future costs of electricity generation compared to the Reference
Scenario. Because of the lower CO2 intensity of electricity
generation, costs will become economically favourable under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario. By 2050 generation costs will be
more than 8 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.

Under the Reference Scenario, on the other hand, unchecked growth in
demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions
result in total electricity supply costs rising from today’s $70 billion per
year to more than $551 bn in 2050. Figure 6.35 shows that the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario not only complies with Latin America’s CO2
reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relieve the
economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting
energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for electricity
supply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Today, renewables provide around 40% of primary energy demand for
heat supply in Latin America, the main contribution coming from the
use of biomass. The availability of less efficient but cheap appliances is
a severe structural barrier to efficiency gains. Large-scale utilisation of
geothermal and solar thermal energy for heat supply will be largely
restricted to the industrial sector.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 83% of Latin
America’s total heating and cooling demand in 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures restrict the future primary energy

demand for heat and cooling supply to a 60% increase, in spite
of improving living standards.

(cid:129) In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly replacing conventional fossil
fuel-fired heating systems.

(cid:129) A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications leads to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

latin america: transport

latin america: primary energy consumption

Despite a huge growth in services, the increase in energy consumption
in the transport sector by 2050 can be limited to 19% under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario. Current 90% dependency on fossil fuels
is transformed into a 30% contribution from bio fuels and 22% from
electricity. The market for cars will grow by a factor of five less than in
the Reference Scenario. Measures are taken to keep the car sales split
by segment like its present breakdown, with one third represented by
medium-sized vehicles and more than half by small vehicles.
Technological progress increases the share of hybrid vehicles to 65% in
2050. Incentives to use more efficient transport modes reduces vehicle
kilometre travelled to in average 11.000 km per annum.

Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting
primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario is shown in Figure 6.38. Compared to the Reference
Scenario, overall energy demand will be reduced by about 38% in
2050. Latin America’s energy demand will increase from 21,000
PJ/a to 32,500 PJ/a. Around 70% of this will be covered by
renewable energy sources.

The future development pathways for Europe’s energy demand are
shown in Figure 6.40 for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution
Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand
in OECD Europe increases by more than 10% from the current
81,500 PJ/a to 90,300 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario, demand decreases by 40% compared to current
consumption, reaching 48,900 PJ/a by the end of the scenario period.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand in all
three sectors is expected to decrease after 2015 (see Figure 6.41).
Because of the growing use of electric vehicles, however, electricity
use for transport increases to 3,520 TWh/a in the year 2050.
Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the
generation of about 1,460 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demand
can be achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient
electronic devices using the best available technology.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be
reduced (see Figure 6.42). Compared to the Reference Scenario,
consumption equivalent to 7,350 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains
by 2050. As a result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of
residential buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards
and new ‘passive houses’, enjoyment of the same comfort and energy
services will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will decrease by almost half to 8700
PJ/a by 2050, saving 58% compared to the Reference Scenario. This
reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient
vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by
changes in mobility-related behaviour patterns.

oecd europe: electricity generation

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by
a dynamically growing renewable energy market. This will
compensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the
number of fossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid
stabilisation. By 2050, 86% of the electricity produced in OECD
Europe will come from renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables
– mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV – will contribute 67%.

The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 250 GW to 1,030 GW in 2050, increasing
renewables capacity by a factor of four. Figure 6.44 shows the
evolution of the different renewable technologies. Up to 2020,
hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors to the
growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind
will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics
and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

None of these numbers describe a maximum feasibility, but a
possible balanced approach. With the right policy development, the
solar industry believes that a much further uptake could happen.
This is particularly true for concentrated solar power (CSP) which
could unfold to 30GW already by 2020 and more than 120GW in
2050. The photovoltaic industry believes in a possible electricity
generation capacity of 350GW by 2020 in Europe alone, assuming
the necessary policy changes.

oecd europe: future costs of electricity generation

oecd europe: heat and cooling supply

Figure 6.45 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs of
electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. This
difference will be less than 0.4 cents/kWh up to 2020, however.
Because of the lower CO2 intensity of electricity generation, electricity
generation costs will become economically favourable under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario by 2020, and by 2050 costs will be
more than 3 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.

Under the Reference Scenario, the unchecked growth in demand, the
increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in
total electricity supply costs rising from today’s $330 billion per year
to more than $800 bn in 2050. Figure 6.46 shows that the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario not only complies with OECD Europe CO2
reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relieve the
economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting
energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for electricity
supply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Renewables currently provide 11% of OECD Europe’s primary
energy demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming from
the use of biomass. The lack of district heating networks is a severe
structural barrier to the large scale utilisation of geothermal and
solar thermal energy.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 61% of
OECD Europe’s total heating and cooling demand in 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures can decrease the current demand for

heat supply by 18%, in spite of improving living standards.

(cid:129) For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for fossil fuel-
fired systems.

oecd europe: transport

oecd europe: primary energy consumption

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will decrease by almost half to 8,700
PJ/a by 2050, saving 57% compared to the Reference Scenario. This
reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles,
by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in
behaviour patterns. By implementing attractive alternatives to individual
cars, the car fleet will grow more slowly than in the Reference Scenario,
reaching 235 million cars in 2050. A slight shift towards smaller cars -
triggered by economic incentives coupled with a significant move
towards electrified power trains and a reduction of vehicle kilometres
travelled by 0.25% per year - leads to 60% final energy savings. In
2050, electricity will provide 35% of the transport sector’s total energy
demand, while 21% of the demand will be covered by bio fuels.

While CO2 emissions in OECD Europe will increase by 12% under

they will decrease from 4,060 million tonnes in 2005 to 880 m/t in
2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 7.6 tonnes to 1.6
t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing

long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable
electricity in vehicles will reduce emissions in the transport sector.
With a share of 14% of total CO2 in 2050, the power sector will
drop below transport as the largest source of emissions.

Future development pathways for Africa’s energy demand are shown in
Figure 6.51 for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios.
Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand more than
doubles from the current 25,200 PJ/a to 53,300 PJ/a in 2050. In the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, a much smaller 50% increase on
current consumption is expected by 2050 to reach 38,300 PJ/a.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand in Africa
is expected to increase disproportionately, with households and
services the main source of growing consumption (see Figure 6.52).
With the exploitation of efficiency measures, however, an even higher
increase can be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around
1,340 TWh/a in the year 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario,
efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 620 TWh/a.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are also significant. Under
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can
even be reduced (see Figure 6.53). Compared to the Reference
Scenario, consumption equivalent to 550 PJ/a is avoided through
efficiency gains by 2050.

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will almost double to 5,300 PJ/a by
2050, still saving 46% compared to the Reference Scenario. This
reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient
vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by
changes in mobility-related behaviour.

africa: electricity generation

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by
a dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing
share of renewable electricity. By 2050, 73% of the electricity
produced in Africa will come from renewable energy sources. A
main driver for the development of solar power generation
capacities will be the export of solar electricity to OECD Europe.
‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV –
will contribute more than 60% of electricity generation.

The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 21 GW to 388 GW in 2050, increasing renewable
capacity by a factor of 18 over the next 42 years. More than 60
GW CSP plants will produce electricity for export to Europe.

Figure 6.55 shows the comparative evolution of different renewable
technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain
the main contributors to the growing market share. After 2020, the
continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from
biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

africa: future costs of electricity generation

africa: heat and cooling supply

Figure 6.56 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases the
future costs of electricity generation. Because of the lower CO2
intensity, electricity generation costs will steadily become more
economic under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario and by 2050 will
be more than 9 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.

Under the Reference Scenario, by contrast, unchecked demand
growth, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2
emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today’s
$59 billion per year to more than $468 bn in 2050. Figure 6.57
shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with
Africa’s CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy
costs. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to
renewables leads to long term costs for electricity supply that are
one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

generation costs under the two scenarios

(CO2 EMISSION COSTS IMPOSED FROM 2020,
WITH AN INCREASE FROM 20 $/TCO2 IN 2020 TO 50 $/TCO2 IN 2050)

Today, renewables provide around 75% of primary energy demand for
heat supply in Africa, the main contribution coming from the use of
biomass. The availability of less efficient but cheap appliances is a
severe structural barrier to efficiency gains. Large-scale utilisation of
geothermal and solar thermal energy for heat supply is restricted to the
industrial sector. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure
a continuously dynamic development of renewables in the heat market.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 72% of
Africa’s total heating and cooling demand in 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures can restrict the future energy demand

for heat and cooling supply to a 50% increase, in spite of
improving living standards.

(cid:129) In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for conventional
fossil-fired heating systems.

(cid:129) A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications leads to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

africa: transport

africa: primary energy consumption

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will almost double to 5,300 PJ/a by 2050,
still saving 46% compared to the Reference Scenario. This reduction can
be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting the
transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-related
behaviour. The African car fleet is projected to grow by a factor of 6 to
roughly 100 million vehicles. Development of fuel efficiency is delayed by
20 years compared to other world regions for economic reasons. By
2050, Africa will still have the lowest average fuel consumption.

Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting
primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario
is shown in Figure 6.60. Compared to the Reference Scenario,
overall energy demand will be reduced by about 30% in 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, Africa’s energy demand
will increase from 25,200 PJ/a to 38,300 PJ/a in 2050. Around
56% of this demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.

africa: development of CO2 emissions

While Africa’s emissions of CO2 will almost triple under the Reference
Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will increase
from 780 million tonnes in 2003 to 895 m/t in 2050. Annual per
capita emissions will drop from 0.8 tonnes to 0.45 t. In spite of
increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity
sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of bio
fuels and electricity will reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector.
With a share of 28% of total CO2 in 2050, the power sector will drop
below transport as the largest source of emissions.

middle east: energy demand by sector

The future development pathways for the Middle East’s energy
demand are shown in Figure 6.62 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total
primary energy demand more than doubles from the current
21,400 PJ/a to 54,980 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario, a much smaller 28% increase on current consumption is
expected by 2050, reaching 27,600 PJ/a.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is
expected to increase disproportionately, with households and
services the main source of growing consumption (see Figure 6.63),
leading to an electricity demand of around 1,620 TWh/a in the year
2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures
avoid the generation of about 390 TWh/a.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario (see Figure 6.64), consumption
equivalent to 2,650 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050.

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will be slightly reduced compared to
today’s level, reaching 3,990 PJ/a by 2050, a saving of 49%
compared to the Reference Scenario. This reduction can be
achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting
the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-
related behaviour patterns.

middle east: electricity generation

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by
an increasing share of renewable electricity. By 2050, 95% of the
electricity produced in the Middle East will come from renewable
energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal energy
and PV – will contribute about 90% of electricity generation.

The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 10 GW to 556 GW in 2050, a very large increase
over the next 42 years requiring political support and well-designed
policy instruments. Figure 6.66 shows the comparative evolution of
the different technologies over the period up to 2050.

middle east: future costs of electricity generation

middle east: heat and cooling supply

Figure 6.67 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario will lead to a significant
reduction of electricity generation costs. Under the Reference
Scenario, on the other hand, the unchecked growth in demand,
increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in
total electricity supply costs rising from today’s $133 billion per year
to more than $870 bn in 2050. Figure 6.68 shows that the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario not only meets the Middle East’s CO2 reduction
targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Long term costs for
electricity supply are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Renewables currently provide only 1% of primary energy demand for
heat and cooling in the Middle East, the main contribution coming
from the use of biomass and solar collectors. Dedicated support
instruments are required to ensure a continuously dynamic
development of renewables in the heat market.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables satisfy 83% of the
Middle East’s total heating and cooling demand in 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures can restrict the future primary energy
demand for heat and cooling supply to a doubling rather than
tripling, in spite of improving living standards.

(cid:129) In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for conventional
fossil-fired heating systems.

middle east: transport

middle east: primary energy consumption

Traditionally, in a region with major oil resources, transport has been
powered 100% by fossil fuels. Rising prices, together with other
incentives, lead to a projected share of 27% of renewable electricity in
this sector. Highly efficient electrified cars – plug-in-hybrid and battery
vehicles – contribute to a total energy saving of 16%, although the car
fleet is still projected to grow by a factor of 5 by 2050. The further
promotion of energy efficient transport modes will help to reduce
annual vehicle kilometres travelled by 0.25% p.a.

Taking into account these assumptions, the resulting primary energy
consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is shown in
Figure 6.71. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall energy
demand will be reduced by more than 50% in 2050., so the Middle
East’s demand will increase from 21,420 PJ/a to just 27,590 PJ/a.
Over 62% of this will be covered by renewable energy sources.

middle east: development of CO2 emissions

While CO2 emissions in the Middle East will triple under the
Reference Scenario by 2050, and are thus far removed from a
sustainable development path, under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario they will decrease from 1,170 million tonnes in 2005 to
390 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 6.2
tonnes/capita to 1.1 t. In spite of an increasing electricity demand,
CO2 emissions will decrease strongly in the electricity sector. In the
long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable
electricity in vehicles will even reduce CO2 emissions in the
transport sector.

transition economies: energy demand by sector

Future development pathways for energy demand in the Transition
Economies are shown in Figure 6.73 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total
primary energy demand increases by 38 % from the current
46,250 PJ/a to 63,930 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario, demand decreases by 23% compared to current
consumption and is expected to reach 35,760 PJ/a by 2050.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is
expected to increase disproportionately, with transport and the
households and services sectors being the main source of growing
consumption (see Figure 6.74). With the exploitation of efficiency
measures, however, an even higher increase can be avoided, leading

to electricity demand of around 1,550 TWh/a in 2050. Compared
to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation
of about 560 TWh/a.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can
even be reduced after 2030 (see Figure 6.75). Compared to the
Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 5,990 PJ/a is
avoided through efficiency gains.

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will decrease by 28% to 4,240 PJ/a
by 2050, saving 57% compared to the Reference Scenario.

transition economies: electricity generation

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by
a growing renewable energy market. This will compensate for the
phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-
fired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 81% of
the electricity produced in the Transition Economy countries will
come from renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly
wind, solar thermal energy and PV – will contribute 65% of
electricity generation.

The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 93 GW to 550 GW in 2050, increasing capacity
by a factor of six over the next 42 years. This will require political
support and well-designed policy instruments.

Figure 6.77 shows the expansion rate of the different renewable
technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will
remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing growth of
wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass,
photovoltaics and geothermal energy.

Figure 6.78 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies under
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs of electricity
generation compared to the Reference Scenario. This difference will be
about 0.5 cents/kWh in 2015. Because of the lower CO2 intensity of
electricity generation, by 2020 these costs will become economically
favourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario and by 2050 will be
more than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.

Due to growing demand, there will be a significant increase in society’s
expenditure on electricity supply. Under the Reference Scenario, total
electricity supply costs will rise from today’s $190 billion per year to
$520 bn in 2050. Figure 6.79 shows that the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario not only complies with the Transition Economies’ CO2
reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relieve
the economic pressure on society. Long term costs for electricity
supply are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

electricity generation costs under the two scenarios

(CO2 EMISSION COSTS IMPOSED FROM 2020,
WITH AN INCREASE FROM 20 $/TCO2 IN 2020 TO 50 $/TCO2 IN 2050)

transition economies: heat and cooling supply

Renewables currently provide just 3% of the Transition Economies’
primary energy demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming
from the use of biomass. The lack of available infrastructure for modern
and efficient district heating networks is a barrier to the large scale
utilisation of biomass, geothermal and solar thermal energy. Dedicated
support instruments are required to ensure a dynamic development.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 75% of the
Transition Economies’ total heating demand in 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures can moderate the increase in heat
demand, and in spite of improving living standards after 2030
lead to a decrease in demand, which in 2050 is slightly lower
than at present.

(cid:129) For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for fossil fuel-
fired systems.

(cid:129) A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications will lead to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

transition economies: transport

transition economies: primary energy consumption

Development of the transport sector is characterised by the
diversification of energy sources towards bio fuels (9%) and electricity
(28%) up to 2050. The time taken to reach reference target levels for
efficient vehicles is delayed by ten years compared to the most other
industrialised countries. Although the light duty vehicle stock will triple
by 2050, increasingly attractive and highly efficient suburban and long
distance rail services, as well as growing fuel prices, will lead to the
vehicle kilometres travelled falling by 10% between 2010 and 2050.
These measures and incentives, together with highly efficient cars, will
result in nearly 30% energy savings in the transport sector.

Taking into account the changes outlined above, the resulting primary
energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is shown
in Figure 6.82. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall energy
demand will be reduced by 44% in 2050. Around 60% of the
remaining demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.

Whilst emissions of CO2 will increase by 11% under the Reference
Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will
decrease from 2,380 million tonnes in 2005 to 540 m/t in 2050.
Annual per capita emissions will drop from 7.0 tonnes to 1.8 t. In
spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing demand,
CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector.

The potential future development pathways for India’s primary
energy demand are shown in Figure 6.84 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total
primary energy demand quadruples from the current 22,300 PJ/a to
89,100 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, by
contrast, demand will increase by about 230 % and is expected to
reach 52,000 PJ/a by 2050.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is
expected to increase substantially (see Figure 6.85). With the
exploitation of efficiency measures, however, a higher increase can be
avoided, leading to demand of around 3,500 TWh/a in 2050.
Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the
generation of about 1,410 TWh/a. This reduction can be achieved in

particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using the
best available technology in all demand sectors.

Efficiency gains for heat and cooling supply are also significant.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heating
and cooling can even be reduced (see Figure 6.86). Compared to the
Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 3,130 PJ/a is avoided
through efficiency gains by 2050.

In the transport sector it is assumed that a fast growing economy
will see energy demand, even under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario, increase dramatically - from 1,550 PJ/a in 2005 to 8,700
PJ/a by 2050. This still saves 50% compared to the Reference
Scenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly
efficient vehicles, shifting freight transport from road to rail and by
changes in travel behaviour.

india: electricity generation

By 2050, about 60% of the electricity produced in India will come
from renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind,
solar thermal energy and PV – will contribute almost 50%. The
installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from
the current 38 GW to 915 GW in 2050, a substantial increase over
the next 42 years.

Figure 6.88 shows the comparative evolution of different renewable
technologies over time. Up to 2030, hydro-power and wind will
remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing growth of
wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass,
photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

india: future costs of electricity generation

india: heat and cooling supply

Figure 6.89 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases the
future costs of electricity generation compared to the Reference
Scenario. Because of the lower CO2 intensity, electricity generation
costs will become economically favourable under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario and by 2050 will be more than 4.5
cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.

Under the Reference Scenario, a massive growth in demand,
increased fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in
total electricity supply costs rising from today’s $64 billion per year
to more than $930 bn in 2050. Figure 6.90 shows that the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario not only complies with India’s CO2 reduction
targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Increasing energy
efficiency and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long
term costs that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Renewables presently provide 63% of primary energy demand for heat
and cooling supply in India, the main contribution coming from the use
of biomass. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure a
continuously dynamic development of renewables in the heat market.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables will provide 71% of
India’s heating and cooling demand by 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures will restrict future primary energy
demand for heat and cooling supply to an increase of 90% by
2005, in spite of improving living standards. This compares to
130% in the Reference Scenario.

(cid:129) In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas and

geothermal energy are increasingly replacing conventional fossil-
fired heating systems.

(cid:129) A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications leads to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

india: transport

india: primary energy consumption

India’s car fleet is projected to grow by a factor of 16 from 2000 to
2050. Presently characterised by small cars (70%), this will stay the
same up to 2050. Although India will remain a low price car market,
the key to efficiency lies in electrified powertrains (hybrid, plug-in and
battery electric). Biofuels will take over 6% and electricity 22% of
total transport energy demand. Stringent energy efficiency measures
will help limit growth of transport energy demand by 2050 to about a
factor of 5.5 compared to 2005.

Taking into account the above assumptions, the resulting primary
energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is
shown in Figure 6.93. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall
demand will be reduced by about 40% in 2050. Around half of this
will be covered by renewable energy sources.

india: development of CO2 emissions

While CO2 emissions in India will increase under the Reference
Scenario by a factor of 5.4 up to 2050, and are thus far removed
from a sustainable development path, under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario they will increase from the current 1,074
million tonnes in 2005 to reach a peak of 1,820 m/t in 2030. After
that they will decrease to 1,660 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita
emissions will increase to 1.3 tonnes/capita in 2030 and fall again
to 1.0 t/capita in 2050. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear
energy and increasing electricity demand, CO2 emissions will
decrease in the electricity sector.

After 2030, efficiency gains and the increased use of renewables in
all sectors will soften the still increasing CO2 emissions in transport,
the power sector and industry. Although its share is decreasing, the
power sector will remain the largest source of emissions in India,
contributing 50% of the total in 2050, followed by transport.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are also significant (see
Figure 6.97). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption
equivalent to 2,900 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency measures by
2050. In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will rise to 8,300 PJ/a
by 2050, saving 90% compared to the Reference Scenario.

developing asia: energy demand by sector

The future development pathways for Developing Asia’s primary
energy demand are shown in Figure 6.95 for both the Reference
and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario,
total primary energy demand more than doubles from the current
31,100 PJ/a to 67,400 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario, a much smaller 40% increase in consumption is expected
by 2050, reaching 43,800 PJ/a.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected
to increase disproportionately in Developing Asia (see Figure 6.96).
With the introduction of serious efficiency measures, however, an even
higher increase can be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around
1,965 TWh/a in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency
measures avoid the generation of about 860 TWh/a.

developing asia: electricity generation

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by
an increasing share of renewable electricity. This will compensate
for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of
fossil fuel-fired power plants required. By 2050, 67% of the
electricity produced in Developing Asia will come from renewable
energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal
energy and PV – will contribute 55%.

The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 51 GW to 590 GW in 2050, increasing capacity
by a factor of more than ten.

Figure 6.99 shows the comparative evolution of the different
technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will
remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing growth of
wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass,
photovoltaics and geothermal sources.

Figure 6.100 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases the
future costs of electricity generation compared to the Reference
Scenario. Because of lower CO2 intensity in electricity generation,
costs will become economically favourable under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario. By 2050 they will be more than 5
cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.

Under the Reference Scenario, unchecked growth in demand, an
increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in
total electricity supply costs rising from today’s $98 billion per year to
more than $566 bn in 2050. Figure 6.101 shows that the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario not only complies with Developing Asia’s CO2
reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Increasing
energy efficiency and shifting supply to renewables leads to long term
costs that are almost one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

figure 6.100: developing asia: development of specific
electricity generation costs under the two scenarios

(CO2 EMISSION COSTS IMPOSED FROM 2020,
WITH AN INCREASE FROM 20 $/TCO2 IN 2020 TO 50 $/TCO2 IN 2050)

developing asia: heat and cooling supply

The starting point for renewables in the heat supply sector is quite
different from the power sector. Today, renewables provide 53% of
primary energy demand for heat and cooling supply in Developing Asia,
the main contribution coming from biomass. Dedicated support
instruments are still required to ensure a continuously dynamic
development of renewables in the heat market.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 70% of
Developing Asia’s heating and cooling demand in 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures can restrict the future primary energy

demand for heat and cooling supply to a increase of 48%,
compared to 77% in the Reference Scenario, in spite of
improving living standards.

(cid:129) In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas and

geothermal energy are increasingly replacing conventional fossil
fuel-fired heating systems.

(cid:129) A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications leads to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

developing asia: transport

developing asia: primary energy consumption

This region’s light duty vehicle stock is projected to grow by a factor of
10 from 2000 to 2050. Biofuels will reach a share of 7%, electricity
9% of the energy needed in the total transport sector. Highly efficient
hybrid car technologies, together with plug-in and battery electric
vehicles, will lead to significant gains in energy efficiency.

Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting
primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario
is shown in Figure 6.104. Compared to the Reference Scenario,
overall demand will be reduced by almost 35% in 2050. Around
half of the remaining demand will be covered by renewables.

Whilst Developing Asia’s CO2 emissions will increase by a factor of
2.5 under the Reference Scenario, in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario
they will decrease from 1,300 million tonnes in 2005 to 1,150 m/t in
2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 1.3 tonnes to 0.8 t.
In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing demand,
CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run
efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in
vehicles will stabilise CO2 emissions in the transport sector. With a
share of 22% of total CO2 in 2050, the power sector will drop below
transport as the largest source of emissions.

The future development pathways for China’s primary energy
demand are shown in Figure 6.106 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total
primary energy demand will increase by a factor of 2.5 from the
current 73,000 PJ/a to 185,020 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, primary energy demand increases up to
2030 by 60% and decreases to a level of 99,150 PJ/a in 2050.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is
expected to increase disproportionately (see Figure 6.107). With
the exploitation of efficiency measures, however, an even higher
increase can be avoided, leading to demand of around 7,500 TWh/a
in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures
avoid the generation of about 3,160 TWh/a.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are large as well. Under
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can
even be reduced (see Figure 6.108). Compared to the Reference
Scenario, consumption equivalent to 10,300 PJ/a is avoided
through efficiency gains by 2050.

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will increase considerably, from 5,100
PJ/a in 2005 to 17,300 PJ/a by 2050. However this still saves
50% compared to the Reference Scenario.

china: electricity generation

A dynamically growing renewable energy market will compensate
for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of
fossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By
2050, 63% of the electricity produced in China will come from
renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar
thermal energy and PV – will contribute 46% of electricity
generation. The following strategy paves the way for a future
renewable energy supply:

Rising electricity demand will be met initially by bringing into
operation new highly efficient gas-fired combined-cycle power
plants, plus an increasing capacity of wind turbines and biomass. In
the long term, wind will be the most important single source of
electricity generation. Solar energy, hydro-power and biomass will
also make substantial contributions.

The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 119 GW to 1,950 GW in 2050, an enormous
increase resulting in a considerable demand for investment over the
next 20 years. Figure 6.110 shows the comparative evolution of the
different renewable technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-
power and wind will remain the main contributors. After 2020, the
continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from
biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal energy.

china: future costs of electricity generation

china: heat and cooling supply

Figure 6.111 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs
of electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. The
difference will be less than 1 cents/kWh up to 2020. Because of the
lower CO2 intensity, by 2020 electricity generation costs in China
will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario, and by 2050 will be more than 5 cents/kWh below those
in the Reference Scenario.

Under the Reference Scenario, the unchecked growth in demand, the
increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total
electricity supply costs rising from today’s $ 205 billion per year to more
than $ 1,940 bn in 2050. Figure 6.112 shows that the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario not only complies with China’s CO2 reduction
targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Increasing energy efficiency
and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for
electricity supply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Today, renewables provide 28% of primary energy demand for heat
and cooling supply in China, the main contribution coming from the
use of biomass.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 65% of
China’s total heating and cooling demand by 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures will restrict the future primary energy

demand for heat and cooling supply to an increase of 21%,
compared to 61% in the Reference Scenario, in spite of
improving living standards.

(cid:129) In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for conventional
fossil-fired heating systems.

(cid:129) A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications leads to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

china: transport

china: primary energy consumption

In 2050, the light duty vehicle stock in China will be 20 times larger
than today. Today, more medium to large sized cars are driven in China,
with an unusually high annual mileage. With growing individual mobility,
an increasing share of small efficient cars is projected, with vehicle
kilometres driven converging with industrialised country averages. More
efficient propulsion technologies, including hybrid-electric powertrains
and lightweight construction, will help limit the increase in total
transport energy demand to a factor of 3.4, reaching 17,300 PJ/a in
2050. As China already has a large fleet of electric vehicles, this will
grow to the point where almost 25% of total transport energy is
covered by electricity. Bio fuels will contribute about 7%.

Taking into account the above assumptions, the resulting primary
energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is
shown in Figure 6.115. Compared to the Reference Scenario,
overall energy demand will be reduced by almost 47 in 2050.
Around 47% of the remaining demand will be covered by
renewable energy sources.

china: development of CO2 emissions

Whilst China’s emissions of CO2 will almost triple under the
Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will
decrease from 4,400 million tonnes in 2005 to 3,200 m/t in 2050.
Annual per capita emissions will drop from 3.4 tonnes to 2.3 t. In
spite of increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the
electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased
use of renewable electricity in vehicles will even reduce CO2 emissions
in the transport sector. With a share of 50% of total CO2 in 2050,
the power sector will remain the largest source of emissions.

oecd pacific: energy demand by sector

The future development pathways for the OECD Pacific’s primary
energy demand are shown in Figure 6.117 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total
primary energy demand increases by 27% - from the current 37,040
PJ/a to 47,020 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario,
by contrast, primary energy demand decreases by 33% compared to
current consumption and is expected by 2050 to reach 24,950 PJ/a.

Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand in the
industry as well as the residential and services sectors is expected to
fall slightly below the current level of demand (see Figure 6.118).
The growing use of electric vehicles however leads to an increase in
electricity demand, reaching 1,920 TWh/a in 2050. Overall demand
is still 560 TWh/a lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can
even be reduced (see Figure 6.119). Compared to the Reference
Scenario, consumption equivalent to 2,860 PJ/a is avoided through
efficiency gains by 2050.

In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will decrease by 40% to 4,000 PJ/a
by 2050, saving about 50% compared to the Reference Scenario.

oecd pacific: electricity generation

A dynamically growing renewable energy market will compensate
for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of

2050, 78% of the electricity produced in the OECD Pacific will
come from renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly

The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 62 GW to more than 600 GW in 2050, an
increase by a factor of ten.

To achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable energy
sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is of
great importance. Figure 6.121 shows the comparative evolution of
the different renewables over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and
wind will remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing
growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass,
photovoltaic and solar thermal energy.

oecd pacific: future costs of electricity generation

oecd pacific: heat and cooling supply

Figure 6.122 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs
of electricity generation in the OECD Pacific compared to the
Reference Scenario. The difference will be less than 1.5 cents/kWh
up to 2030. Because of the lower CO2 intensity, by 2020 electricity
generation costs will become economically favourable under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, and by 2050 they will be more than
4 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.

Under the Reference Scenario, by contrast, unchecked growth in
demand, an increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2
emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today’s
$160 billion per year to more than $400 bn in 2050. Figure 6.123
shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with
the OECD Pacific’s CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise
energy costs. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply
to renewables leads to long term costs for electricity supply that
are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Renewables currently provide 5% of OECD Pacific’s primary
energy demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming from
biomass. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure a
future dynamic development.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 73% of
OECD Pacific’s total heating and cooling demand by 2050.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency measures can decrease the current demand for

heat supply by 10%, in spite of improving living standards.

(cid:129) For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for fossil fuel-
fired systems.

(cid:129) A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications will lead to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

oecd pacific: transport

oecd pacific: primary energy consumption

The low duty vehicles (LDV) market in OECD Pacific is driven by
Japan, with a unique share of small cars and a fuel consumption
average of 6.45 litres/100 km in the new car fleet. Other countries in the
region typically drive larger cars, and incentives to encourage smaller
cars will be crucial. The LDV stock is projected to grow by a factor of
1.4 to 119 million vehicles. While 94% of all LDVs use petrol today,
electrified vehicles will play a key role, especially in Japan’s well suited
small cars, in reducing energy demand. By 2050, 35% of total transport
energy is covered by electricity and 25% by bio fuels.

Taking into account the above assumptions, the resulting primary
energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is
shown in Figure 6.126. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall
energy demand will be reduced by 47% in 2050. Around 55% of
the remaining demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.

oecd pacific: development of CO2 emissions

Whilst the OECD Pacific’s emissions of CO2 will increase by 20%
under the Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario they will decrease from 1,900 million tonnes in 2005 to
430 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will fall from 9.5
tonnes to 2.4 t. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use
of renewable electricity in vehicles will even reduce CO2 emissions in
the transport sector. With a share of 45% of total CO2 in 2050, the
power sector will remain the largest source of emissions.

global market overview
source FOR PAGE 101+102: RENEWABLE 2007 - GLOBAL STATUS REPORT, REN 21, ERIC MARTINOT

The global market for renewable energy has been expanding in
recent years at a record rate, an indication of its potential to realise
the future targets outlined in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.

(cid:129) Renewable electricity generation capacity reached an

estimated 240 Gigawatts (GW) worldwide in 2007, an increase
of 50 % over 2004. Renewables represent 5 % of global power
capacity and 3.4 % of global power generation. These figures
exclude large hydropower, which alone accounted for 15 % of
global power generation.

(cid:129) Renewable energy (excluding large hydropower) generated as

much electric power worldwide in 2006 as one-quarter of the
world’s nuclear power plants.

(cid:129) The largest component of renewable generation capacity is wind
power, which grew by 28 % worldwide in 2007 to reach 95 GW.
The annual capacity growth rate is even higher: 40 % more in
2007 than the year before.

(cid:129) The fastest growing energy technology in the world is

grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV), with a 50 % annual
increase in cumulative installed capacity in both 2006 and 2007
to reach 7.7 GW. This translates into 1.5 million homes with
rooftop solar PV feeding into the grid.

(cid:129) Rooftop solar heat collectors provide hot water to nearly 50
million households worldwide, and space heating to a growing
number of homes. Existing solar hot water/heating capacity
increased by 19 % in 2006 to reach 105 Gigawatts thermal
(GWth) globally.

(cid:129) The use of biomass and geothermal energy for both power and

heating has been increasing in a number of countries, including for
district heating networks. More than 2 million ground source heat
pumps are now used in 30 countries to heat (and cool) buildings.

(cid:129) Renewable energy, in particular small hydropower, biomass and
solar PV, is providing electricity, heat, motive power and water
pumping for tens of millions of people in the rural areas of
developing countries, serving agriculture, small industry, homes
and schools. 25 million households cook and light their homes
with biogas and 2.5 million households use solar lighting systems.

(cid:129) Developing countries account for more than 40 % of existing
renewable power capacity, more than 70 % of solar hot water
capacity and 45 % of bio fuels production.

In terms of investment, an estimated $71 billion was invested in
new renewable power and heating capacity worldwide in 2007
(excluding large hydropower). Of this, 47 % was for wind power
and 30 % for solar PV. Investment in large hydropower, the most
established renewable energy source, added a further $15–20
billion. The total amount invested in new renewable energy capacity,
manufacturing plants and research and development during 2007 is
estimated to have reached a record $100 billion.

Investment flows have also became more diversified and mainstream,
with funding flowing from a wide range of sources, including major
commercial and investment banks, venture capital and private equity
investors, multilateral and bilateral development organisations as well
as smaller local financiers. The renewable energy industry has seen
many new companies launched, huge increases in company valuations
and numerous initial public offerings. The 140 highest-valued publicly
traded renewable energy companies now have a combined market
capitalisation of over $100 billion.

Major industrial growth is occurring in a number of emerging
renewable technologies, including thin-film solar PV, concentrating
solar thermal power generation and advanced or second generation
bio fuels. Worldwide employment in renewable energy
manufacturing, operation and maintenance exceeded 2.4 million
jobs in 2006, including some 1.1 million in bio fuels production.

The main reason for this industrial expansion is that national
targets for renewable energy have been adopted in at least 66
countries worldwide, including all 27 European Union member
states, 29 US states and nine Canadian provinces. Most targets are
for a percentage of electricity production or primary energy to be
achieved by a specific future year. There is now an EU-wide target,
for example, for 20 % of energy to come from renewables by 2020
and a Chinese target of 15 %. Targets for bio fuel use in transport
energy also now exist in several countries, including an EU-wide
target for 10 % by 2020.

Specific policies to promote renewables have also mushroomed in
recent years. At least 60 countries - 37 developed and transition
countries and 23 developing countries - have adopted some type of
policy to promote renewable power generation. The most common is
the feed-in law, through which a set premium price is paid for each
unit of renewable power generation. By 2007, at least 37 countries
and nine states or provinces had adopted feed-in policies, more than
half of which have been enacted since 2002. At least 44 states,
provinces and countries have enacted renewable portfolio standards
(RPS), which place an obligation on energy companies to source a
rising percentage of their power from renewable sources. Other
forms of support for renewable power generation include capital
investment subsidies or rebates, tax incentives and credits, sales tax
and value-added tax exemptions, net metering, public investment or
financing and public competitive bidding.

Beneath a national and state level, municipalities around the world
are also setting targets for future shares of renewable energy,
typically in the range of 10–20 %. Some cities have established
carbon dioxide reduction targets, others are enacting policies to
promote solar hot water and solar PV or introducing urban planning
rules which incorporate renewable energy. Market facilitation
organisations are supporting the growth of renewable energy
markets and policies through networking, market research, training,
project facilitation, consulting, financing, policy advice and other
technical assistance. There are now hundreds of such organisations
around the world, including industry associations, non-governmental
organisations, multilateral and bilateral development agencies,
international partnerships and government agencies.

Figure 7.2 shows that many renewable energy technologies grew at
rates of 15–30 % annually during the five year period 2002–2006,
including wind power, solar hot water, geothermal heating and off-
grid solar PV. Grid-connected solar PV eclipsed all of these, with a
60 % annual average growth rate for the period. Bio fuels also grew
rapidly during the period, at a 40 % annual average for biodiesel
and 15 % for ethanol. Other technologies are growing more slowly,
at 3–5 %, including large hydropower, biomass power and heat, and
geothermal power, although in some countries these technologies are
growing much more rapidly than the global average.

These expansion rates compare with the global growth rates for fossil
fuels of 2–4 % in recent years (higher in some developing countries)35.

future growth rates

In order to get a better understanding of what different
technologies can deliver, however, it is necessary to examine more
closely how future production capacities can be achieved from the
current baseline. The wind industry, for example, has a current
annual production capacity of about 25,000 MW. If this output
were not expanded, total capacity would reach 650 GW by the year
2050. This includes the need for “repowering” of older wind
turbines after 20 years. But according to this scenario the share of
wind electricity in global production by 2050 would need to grow
from today’s 1% to 4.5% under the Reference Scenario and 6.5%
under the Energy [R]evolution pathway.

A relatively modest expansion from today’s 25 GW production
capacity, however, to about 80 GW by 2020 and 100 GW in 2040
would lead to a total installed capacity of 1,800 GW in 2050,
providing between 12% and 18% of world electricity demand.

The tables below provide an overview of current generation levels,
the capacities required under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario and
industry projections of a more advanced market growth. The good
news is that the scenario does not even come close to the limit of
the renewable industries’ own projections. However, the scenario
assumes that at the same time strong energy efficiency measures
are taken in order to save resources and develop a more cost
optimised energy supply.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

investment in new power plants

The overall global level of investment required in new power plants
up to 2030 will be in the region of $ 11 to 14 trillion. The main
driver for investment in new generation capacity in OECD countries
will be the ageing power plant fleet. Utilities will make their
technology choices within the next five to ten years based on national
energy policies, in particular market liberalisation, renewable energy
and CO2 reduction targets. Within Europe, the EU emissions trading
scheme may have a major impact on whether the majority of
investment goes into fossil fuel power plants or renewable energy and
co-generation. In developing countries, international financial
institutions will play a major role in future technology choices.

The investment volume required to realise the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario is $ 14.7 trillion, approximately 30% higher than in the
Reference Scenario, which will require $ 11.3 trillion. Whilst the
levels of investment in renewable energy and fossil fuels are almost
equal under the Reference Scenario, with about $ 4.5 trillion each
up to 2030, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario shifts about 80% of
investment towards renewable energy. The fossil fuel share of power
sector investment is focused mainly on combined heat and power
and efficient gas-fired power plants.

The average annual investment in the power sector under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario between 2005 and 2030 is approximately
$ 590 billion. This is equal to the current amount of subsidies for
fossil fuels globally in less than two years. Most investment in new
power generation will take place in China, followed by North
America and Europe. South Asia, including India, and East Asia,
including Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, will also be ‘hot
spots’ of new power generation investment.

renewable power generation investment

Under the Reference Scenario the investment expected in renewable
electricity generation will be $ 4.7 trillion. This compares with
$ 8.9 trillion in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. The regional
distribution in the two scenarios, however, is almost the same.

How investment is divided between the different renewable power
generation technologies depends on their level of technical
development. Technologies like wind power, which in some regions
with good wind resources is already cost competitive with
conventional fuels, will take a larger investment volume and a
bigger market share. The market volume by technology and region
also depends on the local resources and policy framework.

For solar photovoltaics, the main market will remain for some
years in Europe and the US, but will soon expand across China and
India. Because solar PV is a highly modular and decentralised
technology which can be used almost everywhere, its market will
eventually be spread across the entire world.

Concentrated solar power systems, on the other hand, can only be
operated within the world’s sunbelt regions. The main investment in
this technology will therefore take place in North Africa, the
Middle East, parts of the USA and Mexico, as well as south-west
China, India, Australia and southern Europe.

The main development of the wind industry will take place in Europe,
North America and China. Offshore wind technology will take a
larger share from roughly 2015 onwards. The main offshore wind
development will take place in North Europe and North America.

The market for geothermal power plants will be mainly in North
America and East Asia. The USA, Indonesia and the Philippines,
and some countries of central and southern Africa, have the highest
potential over the next 20 years. After 2030, geothermal generation
will expand to other parts of the world, including Europe and India.

Bio energy power plants will be distributed across the whole world
as there is potential almost everywhere for biomass and/or biogas
(cogeneration) power plants.

fossil fuel power generation investment

Under the Reference Scenario, the main market expansion for new
fossil fuel power plants will be in China, followed by North America,
which will have a volume equal to India and Europe combined. In
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario the overall investment in fossil fuel
power stations up to 2030 will be $ 2,600 billion, significantly lower
than the Reference Scenario’s $ 4,500 billion.

China will be by far the largest investor in coal power plants in both
scenarios. While in the Reference Scenario the growth trend of the
current decade (2000–2010) will continue towards 2030, the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario assumes that in the second and third
decades (2011-2030) growth slows down significantly. In the
Reference Scenario the massive expansion of coal firing is due to
activity in China, followed by the USA, India, East Asia and Europe.

The total cost for fossil fuel investment in the Reference Scenario between
2005 and 2030 amounts to $ 80.6 trillion, compared to $ 61.8 trillion in
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. This means that fuel costs in the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario are already about 25% lower by 2030 and will be

50% lower by 2050. Although the investment in gas-fired power stations
and cogeneration plants is about the same in both scenarios, the finance
committed to oil and coal for electricity generation in the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario is almost 30% below the Reference version.

fuel cost savings with renewables

Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the total fuel cost savings
in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario reach a total of $18.7 trillion,
or $ 750 billion per year. A comparison between the extra fuel costs
associated with the Reference Scenario and the extra investment costs
of the Energy [R]evolution version shows that the average annual
additional fuel costs are about five times higher than the additional
investment requirements of the alternative scenario. In fact, the
additional costs for coal fuel from today until the year 2030 are as
high as $ 15.9 trillion: this would cover the entire investment in
renewable and cogeneration capacity required to implement the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario. These renewable energy sources will produce
electricity without any further fuel costs beyond 2030, while the costs
for coal and gas will continue to be a burden on national economies.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

The issue of security of supply is now at the top of the energy policy
agenda. Concern is focused both on price security and the security
of physical supply. At present around 80% of global energy demand
is met by fossil fuels. The unrelenting increase in energy demand is
matched by the finite nature of these sources. The regional
distribution of oil and gas resources, on the other hand, does not
match the distribution of demand. Some countries have to rely
almost entirely on fossil fuel imports. The maps on the following
pages provide an overview of the availability of different fuels and
their regional distribution. Information in this chapter is based
partly on the report ‘Plugging the Gap’36.

oil

Oil is the lifeblood of the modern global economy, as the effects of
the supply disruptions of the 1970s made clear. It is the number
one source of energy, providing 36% of the world’s needs and the
fuel employed almost exclusively for essential uses such as
transportation. However, a passionate debate has developed over the
ability of supply to meet increasing consumption, a debate obscured
by poor information and stirred by recent soaring prices.

the reserves chaos

Public data about oil and gas reserves is strikingly inconsistent, and
potentially unreliable for legal, commercial, historical and
sometimes political reasons. The most widely available and quoted
figures, those from the industry journals Oil & Gas Journal and
World Oil, have limited value as they report the reserve figures
provided by companies and governments without analysis or
verification. Moreover, as there is no agreed definition of reserves or
standard reporting practice, these figures usually stand for different
physical and conceptual magnitudes. Confusing terminology
(‘proved’, ‘probable’, ‘possible’, ‘recoverable’, ‘reasonable certainty’)
only adds to the problem.

Historically, private oil companies have consistently underestimated
their reserves to comply with conservative stock exchange rules and
through natural commercial caution. Whenever a discovery was
made, only a portion of the geologist’s estimate of recoverable
resources was reported; subsequent revisions would then increase
the reserves from that same oil field over time. National oil
companies, mostly represented by OPEC (Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries), are not subject to any sort of
accountability, so their reporting practices are even less clear. In
the late 1980s, OPEC countries blatantly overstated their reserves
while competing for production quotas, which were allocated as a
proportion of the reserves. Although some revision was needed after
the companies were nationalised, between 1985 and 1990, OPEC
countries increased their joint reserves by 82%. Not only were
these dubious revisions never corrected, but many of these countries
have reported untouched reserves for years, even if no sizeable
discoveries were made and production continued at the same pace.
Additionally, the Former Soviet Union’s oil and gas reserves have
been overestimated by about 30% because the original assessments
were later misinterpreted.

Whilst private companies are now becoming more realistic about the
extent of their resources, the OPEC countries hold by far the
majority of the reported reserves, and information on their resources
is as unsatisfactory as ever. In brief, these information sources
should be treated with considerable caution. To fairly estimate the
world’s oil resources a regional assessment of the mean backdated
(i.e. ‘technical’) discoveries would need to be performed.

Natural gas has been the fastest growing fossil energy source in the
last two decades, boosted by its increasing share in the electricity
generation mix. Gas is generally regarded as an abundant resource
and public concerns about depletion are limited to oil, even though
few in-depth studies address the subject. Gas resources are more
concentrated, and a few massive fields make up most of the
reserves: the largest gas field in the world holds 15% of the
‘Ultimate Recoverable Resources’ (URR), compared to 6% for oil.
Unfortunately, information about gas resources suffers from the
same bad practices as oil data because gas mostly comes from the
same geological formations, and the same stakeholders are involved.

Most reserves are initially understated and then gradually revised
upwards, giving an optimistic impression of growth. By contrast,
Russia’s reserves, the largest in the world, are considered to have
been overestimated by about 30%. Owing to geological similarities,
gas follows the same depletion dynamic as oil, and thus the same
discovery and production cycles. In fact, existing data for gas is of
worse quality than for oil, with ambiguities arising over the amount
produced partly because flared and vented gas is not always
accounted for. As opposed to published reserves, the technical ones
have been almost constant since 1980 because discoveries have
roughly matched production.

Coal was the world’s largest source of primary energy until it was
overtaken by oil in the 1960s. Today, coal supplies almost one
quarter of the world’s energy. Despite being the most abundant of
fossil fuels, coal’s development is currently threatened by
environmental concerns; hence its future will unfold in the context
of both energy security and global warming.

Coal is abundant and more equally distributed throughout the world
than oil and gas. Global recoverable reserves are the largest of all
fossil fuels, and most countries have at least some. Moreover, existing
and prospective big energy consumers like the US, China and India
are self-sufficient in coal and will be for the foreseeable future. Coal
has been exploited on a large scale for two centuries, so both the
product and the available resources are well known; no substantial
new deposits are expected to be discovered. Extrapolating the
demand forecast forward, the world will consume 20% of its current
reserves by 2030 and 40% by 2050. Hence, if current trends are
maintained, coal would still last several hundred years.

nuclear

A joint report by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency37 and the
International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that all existing
nuclear power plants will have used up their nuclear fuel, employing
current technology, within less than 70 years. Given the range of
scenarios for the worldwide development of nuclear power, it is
likely that uranium supplies will be exhausted sometime between
2026 and 2070. This forecast includes the use of mixed oxide fuel
(MOX), a mixture of uranium and plutonium.

Uranium, the fuel used in nuclear power plants, is a finite resource
whose economically available reserves are limited. Its distribution is
almost as concentrated as oil and does not match regional
consumption. Five countries - Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan,
Russia and Niger - control three quarters of the world’s supply. As
a significant user of uranium, however, Russia’s reserves will be
exhausted within ten years.

Secondary sources, such as old deposits, currently make up nearly
half of worldwide uranium reserves. However, those will soon be
used up. Mining capacities will have to be nearly doubled in the
next few years to meet current needs.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

renewable energy

definition of types of energy resource potential38

Nature offers a variety of freely available options for producing
energy. Their exploitation is mainly a question of how to convert
sunlight, wind, biomass or water into electricity, heat or power as
efficiently, sustainably and cost-effectively as possible.

theoretical potential The theoretical potential identifies the
physical upper limit of the energy available from a certain source.
For solar energy, for example, this would be the total solar
radiation falling on a particular surface.

On average, the energy in the sunshine that reaches the Earth is
about one kilowatt per square metre worldwide. According to the
Research Association for Solar Power, power is gushing from
renewable energy sources at a rate of 2,850 times more energy than
is needed in the world. In one day, the sunlight which reaches the
Earth produces enough energy to satisfy the world’s current power
requirements for eight years. Even though only a percentage of that
potential is technically accessible, this is still enough to provide just
under six times more power than the world currently requires.

conversion potential This is derived from the annual efficiency of
the respective conversion technology. It is therefore not a strictly
defined value, since the efficiency of a particular technology
depends on technological progress.

technical potential This takes into account additional restrictions
regarding the area that is realistically available for energy
generation. Technological, structural and ecological restrictions, as
well as legislative requirements, are accounted for.

economic potential The proportion of the technical potential that
can be utilised economically. For biomass, for example, those
quantities are included that can be exploited economically in
competition with other products and land uses.

sustainable potential This limits the potential of an energy source
based on evaluation of ecological and socio-economic factors.

renewable energy potential by region
and technology

Based on the report ‘Renewable Energy Potentials’ from REN 21, a
global policy network39, we can provide a more detailed overview of
renewable energy prospects by world region and technology. The
table below focuses on large economies, which consume 80 % of
the world’s primary energy and produce a similar share of the
world’s greenhouse gas emissions.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology can be harnessed almost
everywhere, and its technical potential is estimated at over 1,500
EJ/year, closely followed by concentrating solar thermal power
(CSP). These two cannot simply be added together, however,
because they would require much of the same land resources. The
onshore wind potential is equally vast, with almost 400 EJ/year
available beyond the order of magnitude of future electricity
consumption. The estimate for offshore wind potential (22 EJ/year)
is cautious, as only wind intensive areas on ocean shelf areas, with
a relatively shallow water depth, and outside shipping lines and

protected areas, are included. The various ocean or marine energy
potentials also reach a similar magnitude, most of it from ocean
waves. Cautious estimates reach a figure of around 50 EJ/year. The
estimates for hydro and geothermal resources are well established,
each having a technical potential of around 50 EJ/year. Those
figures should be seen in the context of a current global energy
demand of around 500 EJ.

In terms of heating and cooling, apart from using biomass, there is
the option of using direct geothermal energy. The potential is
extremely large and could cover 20 times the current world energy
demand for heat. The potential for solar heating, including passive
solar building design, is virtually limitless. However, heat is costly to
transport and one should only consider geothermal heat and solar
water heating potentials which are sufficiently close to the point of
consumption. Passive solar technology, which contributes
enormously to the provision of heating services, is not considered as
a (renewable energy) supply source in this analysis but as an
efficiency factor to be taken into account in the demand forecasts.

the global potential for sustainable biomass

As part of background research for the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario, Greenpeace commissioned the German Biomass Research
Centre, the former Institute for Energy and Environment, to
investigate the worldwide potential for energy crops in different
scenarios up to 2050. In addition, information has been compiled
from scientific studies of the worldwide potential and from data
derived from state of the art remote sensing techniques such as
satellite images. A summary of the report’s findings is given below;
references can be found in the full report.

Various studies have looked historically at the potential for bio
energy and come up with widely differing results. Comparison
between them is difficult because they use different definitions of
the various biomass resource fractions. This problem is particularly
significant in relation to forest derived biomass. Most research has
focused almost exclusively on energy crops, as their development is
considered to be more significant for satisfying the demand for bio
energy. The result is that the potential for using forest residues
(wood left over after harvesting) is often underestimated.

Data from 18 studies has been examined, with a concentration on
those studies which report the potential for biomass residues.
Among these there were ten comprehensive assessments with more
or less detailed documentation of the methodology. The majority
focus on the long-term potential for 2050 and 2100. Little
information is available for 2020 and 2030. Most of the studies
were published within the last ten years. Figure 8.2 shows the
variations in potential by biomass type from the different studies.

figure 8.2: ranges of potentials for different
resource categories

Looking at the contribution of individual resources to the total
biomass potential, the majority of studies agree that the most
promising resource is energy crops from dedicated plantations. Only
six give a regional breakdown, however, and only a few quantify all
types of residues separately. Quantifying the potential of minor
fractions, such as animal residues and organic wastes, is difficult as
the data is relatively poor.

potential of energy crops

Apart from the utilisation of biomass from residues, the cultivation
of energy crops in agricultural production systems is of greatest
significance. The technical potential for growing energy crops has
been calculated on the assumption that demand for food takes
priority. As a first step the demand for arable and grassland for
food production has been calculated for each of 133 countries in
different scenarios. These scenarios are:

(cid:129) Business as usual (BAU) scenario: Present agricultural activity

continues for the foreseeable future

(cid:129) Basic scenario: No forest clearing; reduced use of fallow areas

for agriculture

(cid:129) Sub-scenario 1: Basic scenario plus expanded ecological

protection areas and reduced crop yields

(cid:129) Sub-scenario 2: Basic scenario plus food consumption reduced

in industrialised countries

(cid:129) Sub-scenario 3: Combination of sub-scenarios 1 and 2

In a next step the surpluses of agricultural areas were classified
either as arable land or grassland. On grassland, hay and grass
silage are produced, on arable land fodder silage and Short
Rotation Coppice (such as fast-growing willow or poplar) are
cultivated. Silage of green fodder and grass are assumed to be used
for biogas production, wood from SRC and hay from grasslands for
the production of heat, electricity and synthetic fuels. Country
specific yield variations were taken into consideration.

The result is that the global biomass potential from energy crops in
2050 falls within a range from 6 EJ in Sub-scenario 1 up to 97 EJ
in the BAU scenario.

The best example of a country which would see a very different future
under these scenarios in 2050 is Brazil. Under the BAU scenario large
agricultural areas would be released by deforestation, whereas in the
Basic and Sub 1 scenarios this would be forbidden, and no agricultural
areas would be available for energy crops. By contrast a high potential
would be available under Sub-scenario 2 as a consequence of reduced
meat consumption. Because of their high populations and relatively
small agricultural areas, no surplus land is available for energy crop
production in Central America, Asia and Africa. The EU, North
America and Australia, however, have relatively stable potentials.

The results of this exercise show that the availability of biomass
resources is not only driven by the effect on global food supply but the
conservation of natural forests and other biospheres. So the assessment
of future biomass potential is only the starting point of a discussion
about the integration of bioenergy into a renewable energy system.

The total global biomass potential (energy crops and residues)
therefore ranges in 2020 from 66 EJ (Sub-scenario 1) up to 110
EJ (Sub-scenario 2) and in 2050 from 94 EJ (Sub-scenario 1) to
184 EJ (BAU scenario). These numbers are conservative and
include a level of uncertainty, especially for 2050. The reasons for
this uncertainty are the potential effects of climate change, possible
changes in the worldwide political and economic situation, a higher
yield as a result of changed agricultural techniques and/or faster
development in plant breeding.

This chapter describes the range of technologies available now and
in the future to satisfy the world’s energy demand. The Energy
[R]evolution Scenario is focused on the potential for energy savings
and renewable sources, primarily in the electricity and heat
generating sectors. Although fuel use in transport is accounted for
in the scenarios of future energy supply, no detailed description is
given here of fuel sources, such as bio fuels for vehicles, which offer
an alternative to the currently predominant oil.

fossil fuel technologies

The most commonly used fossil fuels for power generation around
the world are coal and gas. Oil is still used where other fuels are
not readily available, for example islands or remote sites, or where
there is an indigenous resource. Together, coal and gas currently
account for over half of global electricity supply.

coal combustion technologies In a conventional coal-fired power
station, pulverised or powdered coal is blown into a combustion
chamber where it is burnt at high temperature. The hot gases and
heat produced converts water flowing through pipes lining the boiler
into steam. This drives a steam turbine and generates electricity.
Over 90% of global coal-fired capacity uses this system. Coal
power stations can vary in capacity from a few hundred megawatts
up to several thousand.

A number of technologies have been introduced to improve the
environmental performance of conventional coal combustion. These
include coal cleaning (to reduce the ash content) and various ‘bolt-
on’ or ‘end-of-pipe’ technologies to reduce emissions of particulates,
sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, the main pollutants resulting
from coal firing apart from carbon dioxide. Flue gas
desulphurisation (FGD), for example, most commonly involves
‘scrubbing’ the flue gases using an alkaline sorbent slurry, which is
predominantly lime or limestone based.

More fundamental changes have been made to the way coal is
burned to both improve its efficiency and further reduce emissions
of pollutants. These include:

(cid:129) Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle: Coal is not burnt

directly but reacted with oxygen and steam to form a synthetic
gas composed mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This is
cleaned and then burned in a gas turbine to generate electricity
and produce steam to drive a steam turbine. IGCC improves the
efficiency of coal combustion from 38-40% up to 50%.

(cid:129) Supercritical and Ultrasupercritical: These power plants

operate at higher temperatures than conventional combustion,
again increasing efficiency towards 50%.

(cid:129) Fluidised Bed Combustion: Coal is burned in a reactor

comprised of a bed through which gas is fed to keep the fuel in
a turbulent state. This improves combustion, heat transfer and the
recovery of waste products. By elevating pressures within a bed,
a high-pressure gas stream can be used to drive a gas turbine,
generating electricity. Emissions of both sulphur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide can be reduced substantially.

(cid:129) Pressurised Pulverised Coal Combustion: Mainly being

developed in Germany, this is based on the combustion of a finely
ground cloud of coal particles creating high pressure, high
temperature steam for power generation. The hot flue gases are used
to generate electricity in a similar way to the combined cycle system.

Other potential future technologies involve the increased use of coal
gasification. Underground Coal Gasification, for example, involves
converting deep underground unworked coal into a combustible gas
which can be used for industrial heating, power generation or the
manufacture of hydrogen, synthetic natural gas or other chemicals.
The gas can be processed to remove CO2 before it is passed on to
end users. Demonstration projects are underway in Australia,
Europe, China and Japan.

gas combustion technologies Natural gas can be used for
electricity generation through the use of either gas turbines or
steam turbines. For the equivalent amount of heat, gas produces
about 45% less carbon dioxide during its combustion than coal.

Gas turbine plants use the heat from gases to directly operate the
turbine. Natural gas fuelled turbines can start rapidly, and are
therefore often used to supply energy during periods of peak
demand, although at higher cost than baseload plants.

Particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining
gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode. In a
combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant, a gas turbine
generator produces electricity and the exhaust gases from the
turbine are then used to make steam to generate additional
electricity. The efficiency of modern CCGT power stations can be
more than 50%. Most new gas power plants built since the 1990s
have been of this type.

At least until the recent increase in global gas prices, CCGT power
stations have been the cheapest option for electricity generation in
many countries. Capital costs have been substantially lower than
for coal and nuclear plants and construction time shorter.

carbon reduction technologies Whenever coal or gas is burned,
carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced. Depending on the type of power
plant, a large quantity of the gas will dissipate into the atmosphere
and contribute to climate change. A hard coal power plant
discharges roughly 720 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilowatt
hour, a modern gas-fired plant about 370g CO2/kWh. To ensure that
no CO2 emerges from the power plant chimney, the gas must first be
removed, and then stored somewhere. Both carbon capture and
storage (CCS) have limitations. Even after employing proposed
capture technologies, a residual amount of carbon dioxide - between
60 and 150g CO2/kWh - will continue to be emitted.

carbon dioxide storage CO2 captured at the point of incineration
has to be stored somewhere. Current thinking is that it can be
trapped in the oceans or under the Earth’s surface at a depth of
over 3,000 feet. As with nuclear waste, however, the question is
whether this will just displace the problem elsewhere.

Ocean storage could result in greatly accelerated acidification of
large sea areas and would be detrimental to a great many
organisms, if not entire ecosystems, in the vicinity of injection sites.
CO2 disposed of in this way is likely to get back into the atmosphere
in a relatively short time. The oceans are both productive resources
and a common natural endowment for this and future generations.
Given the diversity of other options available for dealing with CO2
emissions, direct disposal to the ocean, sea floor, lakes and other
open reservoir structures must be ruled out.

Among the options available for underground storage, empty oil and
gas fields are riddled with holes drilled during their exploration and
production phases. These holes have to be sealed over. Normally
special cement is used, but carbon dioxide is relatively reactive with
water and attacks metals or cement, so that even sealed drilling
holes present a safety hazard. To many experts the question is not if
but when leakages will occur.

Because of the lack of experience with CO2 storage, its safety is
often compared to the storage of natural gas. This technology has
been tried and tested for decades and is considered by industry to be
low risk. Greenpeace does not share this assessment. A number of
serious leaks from gas storage installations have occurred around
the world, sometimes requiring evacuation of nearby residents.

Sudden leakage of CO2 can be fatal. Carbon dioxide is not itself
poisonous, and is contained (approx. 0.04 per cent) in the air we
breathe. But as concentrations increase it displaces the vital oxygen
in the air. Air with concentrations of 7 to 8% CO2 by volume causes
death by suffocation after 30 to 60 minutes.

There are also health hazards when large amounts of CO2 are
explosively released. Although the gas normally disperses quickly
after leaking, it can accumulate in depressions in the landscape or
closed buildings, since carbon dioxide is heavier than air. It is
equally dangerous when it escapes more slowly and without being
noticed in residential areas, for example in cellars below houses.

The dangers from such leaks are known from natural volcanic CO2
degassing. Gas escaping at the Lake Nyos crater lake in Cameroon,
Africa in 1986 killed over 1,700 people. At least ten people have
died in the Lazio region of Italy in the last 20 years as a result of
CO2 being released.
134

carbon storage and climate change targets Can carbon storage
contribute to climate change reduction targets? In order to avoid
dangerous climate change, we need to reduce CO2 globally by 50%
in 2050. Power plants that store CO2 are still being developed,
however, and could only become reality in 15 years at the earliest.
This means they will not make any substantial contribution towards
protecting the climate until the year 2020 at the earliest. They are
thus irrelevant to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol.

Nor is CO2 storage of any great help in attaining the goal of an
80% reduction by 2050 in OECD countries. If it does become
available in 2020, most of the world’s new power plants will have
just finished being modernised. All that could then be done would be
for existing power plants to be retrofitted and CO2 captured from
the waste gas flow. As retrofitting existing power plants is highly
expensive, a high carbon price would be needed.

Employing CO2 capture will also increase the price of electricity from
fossil fuels. Although the costs of storage depend on many factors,
including the technology used for separation, transport and the
storage installation, experts from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change calculate the additional costs at between 3.5 and 5.0
€cents/kWh of power. Since modern wind turbines in good wind
locations are already cost competitive with new build coal-fired
power plants today, the costs will probably be at the top end. This
means the technology would more than double the cost of electricity.

The conclusion reached in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is that
renewable energy sources are already available, in many cases
cheaper, and without the negative environmental impacts that are
associated with fossil fuel exploitation, transport and processing. It
is renewable energy together with energy efficiency and energy
conservation – and not carbon capture and storage – that has to
increase worldwide so that the primary cause of climate change –
the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas – is stopped.

Greenpeace opposes any CCS efforts which lead to:

(cid:129) The undermining or threats to undermine existing global and

regional regulations governing the disposal of wastes at sea (in
the water column, at or beneath the seabed).

(cid:129) Continued or increasing finance to the fossil fuel sector at the

expense of renewable energy and energy efficiency.

(cid:129) The stagnation of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy

conservation improvements.

(cid:129) The promotion of this possible future technology as the only

major solution to climate change, thereby leading to new fossil
fuel developments – especially lignite and black coal-fired power
plants, and an increase in emissions in the short to medium term.

To what extent these goals address issues of higher safety
standards, as opposed to improved economics, remains unclear.

Of the new reactor types, the European Pressurised Water Reactor
(EPR) has been developed from the most recent Generation II
designs to start operation in France and Germany41. Its stated goals
are to improve safety levels - in particular, reduce the probability of
a severe accident by a factor of ten, achieve mitigation of severe
accidents by restricting their consequences to the plant itself, and
reduce costs. Compared to its predecessors, however, the EPR
displays several modifications which constitute a reduction of
safety margins, including:

(cid:129) The volume of the reactor building has been reduced by

simplifying the layout of the emergency core cooling system,
and by using the results of new calculations which predict less
hydrogen development during an accident.

(cid:129) The thermal output of the plant has been increased by 15%
relative to existing French reactors by increasing core outlet
temperature, letting the main coolant pumps run at higher
capacity and modifying the steam generators.

(cid:129) The EPR has fewer redundant pathways in its safety systems

than a German Generation II reactor.

Several other modifications are hailed as substantial safety
improvements, including a ‘core catcher’ system to control a
meltdown accident. Nonetheless, in spite of the changes being
envisaged, there is no guarantee that the safety level of the EPR
actually represents a significant improvement. In particular,
reduction of the expected core melt probability by a factor of ten is
not proven. Furthermore, there are serious doubts as to whether the
mitigation and control of a core melt accident with the core catcher
concept will actually work.

Finally, Generation IV reactors are currently being developed with
the aim of commercialisation in 20-30 years.

nuclear technologies

Generating electricity from nuclear power involves transferring the
heat produced by a controlled nuclear fission reaction into a
conventional steam turbine generator. The nuclear reaction takes
place inside a core and surrounded by a containment vessel of
varying design and structure. Heat is removed from the core by a
coolant (gas or water) and the reaction controlled by a moderating
element or “moderator”.

Across the world over the last two decades there has been a general
slowdown in building new nuclear power stations. This has been
caused by a variety of factors: fear of a nuclear accident, following
the events at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Monju, increased
scrutiny of economics and environmental factors, such as waste
management and radioactive discharges.

nuclear reactor designs: evolution and safety issues At the
beginning of 2005 there were 441 nuclear power reactors operating
in 31 countries around the world. Although there are dozens of
different reactor designs and sizes, there are three broad categories
either currently deployed or under development. These are:

Generation I: Prototype commercial reactors developed in the
1950s and 1960s as modified or enlarged military reactors,
originally either for submarine propulsion or plutonium production.

Generation II: Mainstream reactor designs in commercial
operation worldwide.

Generation III: New generation reactors now being built.

Generation III reactors include the so-called Advanced Reactors,
three of which are already in operation in Japan, with more under
construction or planned. About 20 different designs are reported to
be under development40, most of them ‘evolutionary’ designs
developed from Generation II reactor types with some
modifications, but without introducing drastic changes. Some of
them represent more innovative approaches. According to the World
Nuclear Association, reactors of Generation III are characterised
by the following:

(cid:129) A standardised design for each type to expedite licensing, reduce

capital cost and construction time.

(cid:129) A simpler and more rugged design, making them easier to

operate and less vulnerable to operational upsets.

(cid:129) Higher availability and longer operating life, typically 60 years.

(cid:129) Reduced possibility of core melt accidents.

(cid:129) Minimal effect on the environment.

(cid:129) Higher burn-up to reduce fuel use and the amount of waste.

(cid:129) Burnable absorbers (‘poisons’) to extend fuel life.

Renewable energy covers a range of natural sources which are
constantly renewed and therefore, unlike fossil fuels and uranium,
will never be exhausted. Most of them derive from the effect of the
sun and moon on the Earth’s weather patterns. They also produce
none of the harmful emissions and pollution associated with
‘conventional’ fuels. Although hydroelectric power has been used on
an industrial scale since the middle of the last century, the serious
exploitation of other renewable sources has a more recent history.

solar power (photovoltaics pv) There is more than enough solar
radiation available all over the world to satisfy a vastly increased
demand for solar power systems. The sunlight which reaches the
Earth’s surface is enough to provide 2,850 times as much energy as
we can currently use. On a global average, each square metre of land
is exposed to enough sunlight to produce 1,700 kWh of power every
year. The average irradiation in Europe is about 1,000 kWh per square
metre, however, compared with 1,800 kWh in the Middle East.

Photovoltaic (PV) technology involves the generation of electricity
from light. The secret to this process is the use of a semiconductor
material which can be adapted to release electrons, the negatively
charged particles that form the basis of electricity. The most
common semiconductor material used in photovoltaic cells is silicon,
an element most commonly found in sand. All PV cells have at least
two layers of such semiconductors, one positively charged and one
negatively charged. When light shines on the semiconductor, the
electric field across the junction between these two layers causes
electricity to flow. The greater the intensity of the light, the greater
the flow of electricity. A photovoltaic system does not therefore need
bright sunlight in order to operate, and can generate electricity even
on cloudy days. Solar PV is different from a solar thermal collecting
system (see below) where the sun’s rays are used to generate heat,
usually for hot water in a house, swimming pool etc.

The most important parts of a PV system are the cells which form
the basic building blocks, the modules which bring together large
numbers of cells into a unit, and, in some situations, the inverters
used to convert the electricity generated into a form suitable for
everyday use. When a PV installation is described as having a
capacity of 3 kWp (peak), this refers to the output of the system
under standard testing conditions, allowing comparison between
different modules. In central Europe a 3 kWp rated solar electricity
system, with a surface area of approximately 27 square metres,
would produce enough power to meet the electricity demand of an
energy conscious household.

(cid:129) grid connected The most popular type of solar PV system for
homes and businesses in the developed world. Connection to the
local electricity network allows any excess power produced to be
sold to the utility. Electricity is then imported from the network
outside daylight hours. An inverter is used to convert the DC
power produced by the system to AC power for running normal
electrical equipment.

(cid:129) grid support A system can be connected to the local electricity

network as well as a back-up battery. Any excess solar electricity
produced after the battery has been charged is then sold to
the network. This system is ideal for use in areas of unreliable
power supply.

(cid:129) off-grid Completely independent of the grid, the system is

connected to a battery via a charge controller, which stores the
electricity generated and acts as the main power supply. An
inverter can be used to provide AC power, enabling the use of
normal appliances. Typical off-grid applications are repeater
stations for mobile phones or rural electrification. Rural
electrification means either small solar home systems covering
basic electricity needs or solar mini grids, which are larger solar
electricity systems providing electricity for several households.

(cid:129) hybrid system A solar system can be combined with another

source of power - a biomass generator, a wind turbine or diesel
generator - to ensure a consistent supply of electricity. A hybrid
system can be grid connected, stand alone or grid support.

concentrating solar power (CSP) Concentrating solar power
(CSP) plants, also called solar thermal power plants, produce
electricity in much the same way as conventional power stations. The
difference is that they obtain their energy input by concentrating
solar radiation and converting it to high temperature steam or gas
to drive a turbine or motor engine. Large mirrors concentrate
sunlight into a single line or point. The heat created there is used to
generate steam. This hot, highly pressurised steam is used to power
turbines which generate electricity. In sun-drenched regions, CSP
plants can guarantee a large proportion of electricity production.

Four main elements are required: a concentrator, a receiver, some
form of transfer medium or storage, and power conversion. Many
different types of system are possible, including combinations with
other renewable and non-renewable technologies, but the three
most promising solar thermal technologies are:

(cid:129) parabolic trough Trough-shaped mirror reflectors are used to
concentrate sunlight on to thermally efficient receiver tubes
placed in the trough’s focal line. A thermal transfer fluid, such as
synthetic thermal oil, is circulated in these tubes. Heated to
approximately 400°C by the concentrated sun’s rays, this oil is
then pumped through a series of heat exchangers to produce
superheated steam. The steam is converted to electrical energy in
a conventional steam turbine generator, which can either be part
of a conventional steam cycle or integrated into a combined
steam and gas turbine cycle.

This is the most mature technology, with 354 MWe of plants
connected to the Southern California grid since the 1980s and
more than 2 million square metres of parabolic trough collectors
installed worldwide.

(cid:129) central receiver or solar tower A circular array of heliostats

(large individually tracking mirrors) is used to concentrate sunlight
on to a central receiver mounted at the top of a tower. A heat-
transfer medium absorbs the highly concentrated radiation reflected
by the heliostats and converts it into thermal energy to be used for
the subsequent generation of superheated steam for turbine
operation. To date, the heat transfer media demonstrated include
water/steam, molten salts, liquid sodium and air. If pressurised gas
or air is used at very high temperatures of about 1,000°C or more
as the heat transfer medium, it can even be used to directly replace
natural gas in a gas turbine, thus making use of the excellent
efficiency (60%+) of modern gas and steam combined cycles.

After an intermediate scaling up to 30 MW capacity, solar tower
developers now feel confident that grid-connected tower power
plants can be built up to a capacity of 200 MWe solar-only units.
Use of heat storage will increase their flexibility. Although solar
tower plants are considered to be further from commercialisation
than parabolic trough systems, they have good longer-term
prospects for high conversion efficiencies. Projects are being
developed in Spain, South Africa and Australia.

(cid:129) parabolic dish A dish-shaped reflector is used to concentrate

sunlight on to a receiver located at its focal point. The
concentrated beam radiation is absorbed into the receiver to heat
a fluid or gas to approximately 750°C. This is then used to
generate electricity in a small piston, Stirling engine or a micro
turbine, attached to the receiver.

The potential of parabolic dishes lies primarily for decentralised
power supply and remote, stand-alone power systems. Projects
are currently planned in the United States, Australia and Europe.

solar thermal collectors Solar thermal collecting systems are based
on a centuries-old principle: the sun heats up water contained in a dark
vessel. Solar thermal technologies on the market now are efficient and
highly reliable, providing energy for a wide range of applications - from
domestic hot water and space heating in residential and commercial
buildings to swimming pool heating, solar-assisted cooling, industrial
process heat and the desalination of drinking water.

solar domestic hot water and space heating Domestic hot water
production is the most common application. Depending on the
conditions and the system’s configuration, most of a building’s hot
water requirements can be provided by solar energy. Larger systems
can additionally cover a substantial part of the energy needed for
space heating. There are two main types of technology:

(cid:129) vacuum tubes The absorber inside the vacuum tube absorbs

radiation from the sun and heats up the fluid inside. Additional
radiation is picked up from the reflector behind the tubes.
Whatever the angle of the sun, the round shape of the vacuum
tube allows it to reach the absorber. Even on a cloudy day, when
the light is coming from many angles at once, the vacuum tube
collector can still be effective.

(cid:129) flat panel This is basically a box with a glass cover which sits on
the roof like a skylight. Inside is a series of copper tubes with
copper fins attached. The entire structure is coated in a black
substance designed to capture the sun’s rays. These rays heat up a
water and antifreeze mixture which circulates from the collector
down to the building’s boiler.

solar assisted cooling Solar chillers use thermal energy to produce
cooling and/or dehumidify the air in a similar way to a refrigerator
or conventional air-conditioning. This application is well-suited to
solar thermal energy, as the demand for cooling is often greatest
when there is most sunshine. Solar cooling has been successfully
demonstrated and large-scale use can be expected in the future.

wind power Over the last 20 years, wind energy has become the
world’s fastest growing energy source. Today’s wind turbines are
produced by a sophisticated mass production industry employing a
technology that is efficient, cost effective and quick to install.
Turbine sizes range from a few kW to over 5,000 kW, with the
largest turbines reaching more than 100m in height. One large wind
turbine can produce enough electricity for about 5,000 households.
State-of-the-art wind farms today can be as small as a few turbines
and as large as several hundred MW.

The global wind resource is enormous, capable of generating more
electricity than the world’s total power demand, and well
distributed across the five continents. Wind turbines can be
operated not just in the windiest coastal areas but in countries
which have no coastlines, including regions such as central Eastern
Europe, central North and South America, and central Asia. The
wind resource out at sea is even more productive than on land,
encouraging the installation of offshore wind parks with
foundations embedded in the ocean floor. In Denmark, a wind park
built in 2002 uses 80 turbines to produce enough electricity for a
city with a population of 150,000.

Smaller wind turbines can produce power efficiently in areas that
otherwise have no access to electricity. This power can be used
directly or stored in batteries. New technologies for using the wind’s
power are also being developed for exposed buildings in densely
populated cities.

wind turbine design Significant consolidation of wind turbine
design has taken place since the 1980s. The majority of commercial
turbines now operate on a horizontal axis with three evenly spaced
blades. These are attached to a rotor from which power is
transferred through a gearbox to a generator. The gearbox and
generator are contained within a housing called a nacelle. Some
turbine designs avoid a gearbox by using direct drive. The electricity
output is then channelled down the tower to a transformer and
eventually into the local grid network.

Wind turbines can operate from a wind speed of 3-4 metres per
second up to about 25 m/s. Limiting their power at high wind
speeds is achieved either by ‘stall’ regulation – reducing the power
output – or ‘pitch’ control – changing the angle of the blades so
that they no longer offer any resistance to the wind. Pitch control
has become the most common method. The blades can also turn at
a constant or variable speed, with the latter enabling the turbine to
follow more closely the changing wind speed.

The main design drivers for current wind technology are:

(cid:129) high productivity at both low and high wind sites

(cid:129) grid compatibility

(cid:129) acoustic performance

(cid:129) aerodynamic performance

(cid:129) visual impact

(cid:129) offshore expansion

Although the existing offshore market is only just over 1% of the
world’s land-based installed wind capacity, the latest developments
in wind technology are primarily driven by this emerging potential.
This means that the focus is on the most effective ways to make
very large turbines.

Modern wind technology is available for a range of sites - low and high
wind speeds, desert and arctic climates. European wind farms operate
with high availability, are generally well integrated with the environment
and accepted by the public. In spite of repeated predictions of a levelling
off at an optimum mid-range size, and the fact that wind turbines
cannot get larger indefinitely, turbine size has increased year on year -
from units of 20-60 kW in California in the 1980s up to the latest
multi-MW machines with rotor diameters over 100 m. The average size
of turbine installed around the world during 2007 was 1,492 kW, whilst
the largest machine in operation is the Enercon E126, with a rotor
diameter of 126 metres and a power capacity of 6 MW.

This growth in turbine size has been matched by the expansion of
both markets and manufacturers. Almost 100,000 wind turbines
now operate in over 50 countries around the world. The German
market is the largest, but there has also been impressive growth in
Spain, Denmark, India, China and the United States.

biomass energy Biomass is a broad term used to describe material
of recent biological origin that can be used as a source of energy.
This includes wood, crops, algae and other plants as well as
agricultural and forest residues. Biomass can be used for a variety
of end uses: heating, electricity generation or as fuel for
transportation. The term ‘bio energy’ is used for biomass energy
systems that produce heat and/or electricity and ‘bio fuels’ for
liquid fuels used in transport. Biodiesel manufactured from various
crops has become increasingly used as vehicle fuel, especially as the
cost of oil has risen.

Biological power sources are renewable, easily stored, and, if
sustainably harvested, CO2 neutral. This is because the gas emitted
during their transfer into useful energy is balanced by the carbon
dioxide absorbed when they were growing plants.

Electricity generating biomass power plants work just like natural
gas or coal power stations, except that the fuel must be processed
before it can be burned. These power plants are generally not as
large as coal power stations because their fuel supply needs to grow
as near as possible to the plant. Heat generation from biomass
power plants can result either from utilising a Combined Heat and
Power (CHP) system, piping the heat to nearby homes or industry,
or through dedicated heating systems. Small heating systems using
specially produced pellets made from waste wood, for example, can
be used to heat single family homes instead of natural gas or oil.

biomass technology A number of processes can be used to convert
energy from biomass. These divide into thermal systems, which
involve direct combustion of solids, liquids or a gas via pyrolysis or
gasification, and biological systems, which involve decomposition of
solid biomass to liquid or gaseous fuels by processes such as
anaerobic digestion and fermentation.

(cid:129) thermal systems

Direct combustion is the most common way of converting
biomass to energy, for heat as well as electricity. Worldwide it
accounts for over 90% of biomass generation. Technologies can
be distinguished as either fixed bed, fluidised bed or entrained
flow combustion. In fixed bed combustion, such as a grate
furnace, primary air passes through a fixed bed, in which drying,
gasification and charcoal combustion takes place. The
combustible gases produced are burned after the addition of
secondary air, usually in a zone separated from the fuel bed. In
fluidised bed combustion, the primary combustion air is injected
from the bottom of the furnace with such high velocity that the
material inside the furnace becomes a seething mass of particles
and bubbles. Entrained flow combustion is suitable for fuels
available as small particles, such as sawdust or fine shavings,
which are pneumatically injected into the furnace.

Gasification Biomass fuels are increasingly being used with
advanced conversion technologies, such as gasification systems,
which offer superior efficiencies compared with conventional
power generation. Gasification is a thermochemical process in
which biomass is heated with little or no oxygen present to
produce a low energy gas. The gas can then be used to fuel a gas
turbine or combustion engine to generate electricity. Gasification
can also decrease emission levels compared to power production
with direct combustion and a steam cycle.

Pyrolysis is a process whereby biomass is exposed to high
temperatures in the absence of air, causing the biomass to
decompose. The products of pyrolysis always include gas
(‘biogas’), liquid (‘bio-oil’) and solid (‘char’), with the relative
proportions of each depending on the fuel characteristics, the
method of pyrolysis and the reaction parameters, such as
temperature and pressure. Lower temperatures produce more
solid and liquid products and higher temperatures more biogas.

(cid:129) biological systems

These processes are suitable for very wet biomass materials such
as food or agricultural wastes, including farm animal slurry.

Anaerobic digestion means the breakdown of organic waste by
bacteria in an oxygen-free environment. This produces a biogas
typically made up of 65% methane and 35% carbon dioxide. Purified
biogas can then be used both for heating and electricity generation.

Fermentation Fermentation is the process by which growing plants
with a high sugar and starch content are broken down with the
help of micro-organisms to produce ethanol and methanol. The end
product is a combustible fuel that can be used in vehicles.

NETHERLANDS’, GREENPEACE NETHERLANDS, 2005

Biomass power station capacities typically range up to 15 MW,
but larger plants are possible of up to 400 MW capacity, with
part of the fuel input potentially being fossil fuel, for example
pulverised coal. The world’s largest biomass fuelled power plant is
located at Pietarsaari in Finland. Built in 2001, this is an
industrial CHP plant producing steam (100 MWth) and
electricity (240 MWe) for the local forest industry and district
heat for the nearby town. The boiler is a circulating fluidised bed
boiler designed to generate steam from bark, sawdust, wood
residues, commercial bio fuel and peat.

A 2005 study commissioned by Greenpeace Netherlands
concluded that it was technically possible to build and operate a
1,000 MWe biomass fired power plant using fluidised bed
combustion technology and fed with wood residue pellets42.

bio fuels Converting crops into ethanol and bio diesel made from
rapeseed methyl ester (RME) currently takes place mainly in Brazil,
the USA and Europe. Processes for obtaining synthetic fuels from
‘biogenic synthesis’ gases will also play a larger role in the future.
Theoretically bio fuels can be produced from any biological carbon
source, although the most common are photosynthetic plants. Various
plants and plant-derived materials are used for bio fuel production.
Globally bio fuels are most commonly used to power vehicles, but can
also be used for other purposes. The production and use of bio fuels
must result in a net reduction in carbon emissions compared to the use
of traditional fossil fuels to have a positive effect in climate change
mitigation. Sustainable bio fuels can reduce the dependency on
petroleum and thereby enhance energy security.

Bio ethanol is a fuel manufactured through the fermentation of
sugars. This is done by accessing sugars directly (sugar cane or beet)
or by breaking down starch in grains such as wheat, rye, barley or
maize. In the European Union bio ethanol is mainly produced from
grains, with wheat as the dominant feedstock. In Brazil the preferred
feedstock is sugar cane, whereas in the USA it is corn (maize). Bio
ethanol produced from cereals has a by-product, a protein-rich animal
feed called Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS). For every
tonne of cereals used for ethanol production, on average one third will
enter the animal feed stream as DDGS. Because of its high protein
level this is currently used as a replacement for soy cake. Bio ethanol
can either be blended into gasoline (petrol) directly or be used in the
form of ETBE (Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether).

Bio diesel is a fuel produced from vegetable oil sourced from rapeseed,
sunflower seeds or soybeans as well as used cooking oils or animal fats.
Bio diesel comes in a standard form as ‘mono-alkyl ester’ and other
kinds of diesel-grade fuels of biological origin are not included. In
specific cases, used vegetable oils can be recycled as feedstock for bio
diesel production. This can reduce the loss of used oils in the
environment and provides a new way of transforming a waste into
transport energy. Blends of bio diesel and conventional hydrocarbon-
based diesel are the most common products distributed in the retail
transport fuel market.

Most countries use a labelling system to explain the proportion of bio
diesel in any fuel mix. Fuel containing 20% biodiesel is labelled B20,
while pure bio diesel is referred to as B100. Blends of 20 % bio diesel
with 80 % petroleum diesel (B20) can generally be used in unmodified
diesel engines. Used in its pure form (B100) an engine may require
certain modifications. Bio diesel can also be used as a heating fuel in
domestic and commercial boilers. Older furnaces may contain rubber
parts that would be affected by bio diesel’s solvent properties, but can
otherwise burn it without any conversion.

geothermal energy Geothermal energy is heat derived from deep
underneath the Earth’s crust. In most areas, this heat reaches the
surface in a very diffuse state. However, due to a variety of
geological processes, some areas, including the western part of the
USA, west and central eastern Europe, Iceland, Asia and New
Zealand are underlain by relatively shallow geothermal resources.
These are classified as either low temperature (less than 90°C),
moderate temperature (90° - 150°C) or high temperature (greater
than 150°C). The uses to which these resources can be put depend
on the temperature. The highest temperature is generally used only
for electric power generation. Current global geothermal generation
capacity totals approximately 8,000 MW. Uses for low and
moderate temperature resources can be divided into two categories:
direct use and ground-source heat pumps.

Geothermal power plants use the Earth’s natural heat to vapourise
water or an organic medium. The steam created then powers a
turbine which produces electricity. In New Zealand and Iceland this
technique has been used extensively for decades. In Germany, where
it is necessary to drill many kilometres down to reach the necessary
temperatures, it is only in the trial stages. Geothermal heat plants
require lower temperatures and the heated water is used directly.

hydro power Water has been used to produce electricity for about
a century. Today, around one fifth of the world’s electricity is
produced from hydro power. Large hydroelectric power plants with
concrete dams and extensive collecting lakes often have very
negative effects on the environment, however, requiring the flooding
of habitable areas. Smaller ‘run-of-the-river’ power stations, which
are turbines powered by one section of running water in a river, can
produce electricity in an environmentally friendly way.

The main requirement for hydro power is to create an artificial
head so that water, diverted through an intake channel or pipe into
a turbine, discharges back into the river downstream. Small hydro
power is mainly ‘run-of-the-river’ and does not collect significant
amounts of stored water, requiring the construction of large dams
and reservoirs. There are two broad categories of turbines: impulse
turbines (notably the Pelton) in which a jet of water impinges on
the runner designed to reverse the direction of the jet and thereby
extracts momentum from the water. This turbine is suitable for high
heads and ‘small’ discharges. Reaction turbines (notably Francis
and Kaplan) run full of water and in effect generate hydrodynamic
‘lift’ forces to propel the runner blades. These turbines are suitable
for medium to low heads, and medium to large discharges.

wave and tidal stream power In wave power generation, a
structure interacts with the incoming waves, converting this energy
to electricity through a hydraulic, mechanical or pneumatic power
take-off system. The structure is kept in position by a mooring
system or placed directly on the seabed/seashore. Power is
transmitted to the seabed by a flexible submerged electrical cable
and to shore by a sub-sea cable.

Wave power converters can be made up from connected groups of
smaller generator units of 100 – 500 kW, or several mechanical or
hydraulically interconnected modules can supply a single larger
turbine generator unit of 2 – 20 MW. The large waves needed to
make the technology more cost effective are mostly found at great
distances from the shore, however, requiring costly sub-sea cables to
transmit the power. The converters themselves also take up large
amounts of space. Wave power has the advantage of providing a
more predictable supply than wind energy and can be located in the
ocean without much visual intrusion.

There is no commercially leading technology on wave power
conversion at present. Different systems are being developed at sea
for prototype testing. The largest grid-connected system installed so
far is the 2.25 MW Pelamis, with linked semi-submerged
cyclindrical sections, operating off the coast of Portugal. Most
development work has been carried out in the UK.

ocean energy

tidal power Tidal power can be harnessed by constructing a dam
or barrage across an estuary or bay with a tidal range of at least
five metres. Gates in the barrage allow the incoming tide to build up
in a basin behind it. The gates then close so that when the tide flows
out the water can be channelled through turbines to generate
electricity. Tidal barrages have been built across estuaries in
France, Canada and China but a mixture of high cost projections
coupled with environmental objections to the effect on estuarial
habitats has limited the technology’s further expansion.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

Using energy efficiently is cheaper than producing fresh energy and
often has multiple positive effects. An efficient clothes washing
machine or dishwasher, for example uses less power and less water.
Efficiency also usually provides a higher level of comfort. A well-
insulated house, for instance, will feel warmer in the winter, cooler
in the summer and be healthier to live in. An efficient refrigerator
will make less noise, have no frost inside, no condensation outside
and will probably last longer. Efficient lighting will offer you more
light where you need it. Efficiency is thus really ‘more with less’.

There are very simple steps a householder can take, such as putting
additional insulation in the roof, using super-insulating glazing or
buying a high-efficiency washing machine when the old one wears
out. All of these examples will save both money and energy. But the
biggest savings will not be found in such incremental steps. The real
gains come from rethinking the whole concept - ‘the whole house’,
‘the whole car’ or even ‘the whole transport system’. When you do
this, energy needs can often be cut back by four to ten times.

In order to find out the global and regional energy efficiency
potential, the Dutch institute Ecofys developed energy demand
scenarios for this update of the Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution
analysis. These scenarios cover energy demand over the period
2005-2050 for ten world regions. Two low energy demand scenarios
for energy efficiency improvements have been defined. The first is
based on the best technical energy efficiency potentials and is
called ‘Technical’. The second is based on more moderate energy
savings taking into account implementation constraints in terms of
costs and other barriers. This scenario is called ‘Revolution’. The
main results of the study are summarised below.

The starting point for the Ecofys analysis is that worldwide final
energy demand is expected to grow by 95%, from 290 EJ in 2005
to 570 EJ in 2050, if we continue with business as usual. In the
light of increasing fossil fuel prices, depleting resources and climate
change, business as usual is simply not an option.

Growth in the transport sector is projected to be the largest, with
energy demand expected to grow from 84 EJ in 2005 to 183 EJ in
2050. Demand for buildings and agriculture is expected to grow the
least, from 91 EJ in 2005 to 124 EJ in 2050.

Under the energy [r]evolution scenario, however,
growth in energy demand can be limited to an
increase of 28% up to 2050 in comparison to the 2005
level, whilst taking into account implementation
constraints in terms of costs and other barriers.
In Figure 10.2 the potential for energy efficiency improvements under
this scenario are presented. The baseline is 2005 final energy demand
per region. Table 10.1 shows that total worldwide energy demand has
reduced to 376 PJ by 2050, with a breakdown by sector.

Since homes account for the largest share of energy demand from
buildings, this section examines in detail the savings potential in
households. Breakdowns of electricity use in the core EU-15
countries and the new member states are given in Figure 10.4 and
Figure 10.5. A breakdown of electricity demand in the services
sector can be found in Figure 10.6.

Based on the results from three studies43, we have assumed the
following breakdowns for energy use (fuel and electricity) under the
Reference Scenario in 2050. Insufficient information is available to
make a breakdown by world region. We assume however that the
pattern for different regions will converge over the years.

Since an estimated 80% of fuel use in buildings is for space
heating, the energy efficiency improvement potential here is
considered to be large. In order to determine the potential for
efficiency improvement in space heating we looked at the energy
demand per m2 floor area per heating degree day (HDD). Heating
degree days indicate the number of degrees that a day’s average
temperature is under 18°C, the temperature below which buildings
need to be heated.

The typical current heating demand for dwellings is 70-120 kJ/m2 44.
Dwellings with a low energy use consume below 32 kJ/m2/, however,
more than 70% less than the current level.

windows greatly reduce heat loss to 40% compared to windows
with one layer. The low emittance coating prevents energy waves
in sunlight coming through, reducing the need for cooling.

reduces heating and cooling demand by 50% in comparison to
typical energy demand.

(cid:129) Passive solar techniques make use of solar energy through the
building’s design - siting and window orientation. The term
‘passive’ indicates that no mechanical equipment is used. All
solar gains come through the windows.

(cid:129) Balanced ventilation with heat recovery means that heated indoor

air is channelled to a heat recovery unit and used to heat
incoming outdoor air.

space heating savings for new buildings We have assumed under
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that from 2010 onwards, all new
dwellings will be low energy buildings using 48 kJ/m2/HDD. Since
there is no data on current average energy consumption for
dwellings in non-OECD countries, we have had to make assumptions
for these regions. The potential for fuel savings46 is considered to be
small in developing regions and about the same as the OECD in the
Transition Economies. From this study we have taken the potential
for developing regions to be equal to a 1.4% energy efficiency
improvement per year, including replacing existing homes with more
energy efficient housing (retrofitting). For the Transition Economies
we have assumed the average OECD savings potential. For new
homes, the savings compared to the average current dwelling are
given in Table 10.4.

space heating savings by retrofit As well as constructing efficient
new buildings there is a large savings potential to be found in
retrofitting existing buildings. Important retrofit options are more
efficient windows and insulation. According to the OECD/IEA, the
first can save 39% of space heating energy demand while the latter
can save 32% of space heating or cooling. Energy consumption in
existing buildings in Europe could therefore decrease by more than
50%47. In OECD Europe and for the other regions we assume the
same relative reductions as for new buildings, to take into account
current average efficiency of dwellings in the regions. For existing
homes, the savings compared to the average current dwelling are
given in the table below.

In order to calculate the overall potential we need to know the
share of new and existing buildings in 2050. The United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe database48 contains data on the
total housing stock, the increase from new construction and
population. We have assumed that the total housing stock grows
along with the population. The number of existing dwellings also
decreases each year due to a certain level of replacement. On
average this is about 1.3% of the total housing stock per year,
meaning a 40% replacement over 40 years, the equivalent of an
average house lifetime of 100 years. Figure 10.6 shows how the
future housing stock could develop in The Netherlands.

This example illustrates that new dwellings in The Netherlands (and
therefore OECD Europe) make up 7% of the total housing stock in
2050 and retrofits account for 41%. Although the UNECE database
does not have data for countries in all regions of the world, the
percentages of new and retrofit houses in 2050 are not dependent on
the absolute number of dwellings but only on the rate of population
growth and the 1.3% assumption. This means that we can use the
population growth to make forecasts for other regions (see Table 10.6).

Total savings for space heating energy demand are calculated by
multiplying the savings potentials for new and existing houses by
the forecast share of dwellings in 2050 to get a weighed percentage
reduction. For fuel use for hot water we have assumed the same
annual percentage reduction as for space heating. For cooking we
have assumed a 1.5% per year efficiency improvement.

electricity savings by application

In order to determine savings for electricity demand in buildings,
we examined the energy use and potential savings for the following
different elements of power consumption:

(cid:129) Standby

(cid:129) Lighting

(cid:129) Set-top boxes

(cid:129) Freezers/fridges

(cid:129) Computers/servers

(cid:129) Air conditioning

1. standby power consumption Standby power consumption is the
"lowest power consumption which cannot be switched off
(influenced) by the user and may persist for an indefinite time when
an appliance is connected to the mains electricity supply"49. In other
words, the energy available when an appliance is connected to the
power supply is not being used. Some appliances also consume
energy when they are not on standby and are also not being used for
their primary function, for example when an appliance has reached
the end of a cycle but the ‘on’ button is still engaged. This
consumption does not fit into the definition of standby power but
could still account for a substantial amount of energy use.

Reducing standby losses provides a major opportunity for cost-
effective energy savings. Nowadays, many appliances can be
remotely and/or instantly activated or have a continuous digital
display, and therefore require a standby mode. Standby power
accounts for 20–90W per home in developed nations, ranging from
4 to 10% of total residential electricity use50 and 3-12% of total
residential electricity use worldwide51. Printers use 30-40% of their
full power requirement when idle, as do televisions and music
equipment. Set-top boxes used in conjunction with televisions tend to
consume even more energy on standby than in use. Typical standby
use of different types of electrical devices is shown in Figure 10.8.

In developing nations, the amount of appliances per household is
growing (see Figure 10.9 for China). In China, standby energy use
accounts for 50–200 kWh per year in an average urban home.

Overall, residential standby power consumption in
China requires the electrical output equivalent to at
least six 500 MW power plants.

Levels of standby power use in Chinese homes (on average 29W)
are below those in developed countries but still high because Chinese
appliances have a higher level of standby operation. Existing
technologies are available to greatly reduce standby power at a low cost.

By 2050, standby use is expected to be responsible for 8% of total
electricity demand across all regions of the world. The World
Business Council for Sustainable Development has assessed that a
worldwide savings potential of between 72% and 82% is feasible.
This is confirmed by research in The Netherlands52 which showed
that reducing the amount of power available for standby in all
devices to just 1W would lead to a saving of approximately 77%.
We have adopted these reduction percentages for the Technical
scenario (82% reduction) and the [R]evolution Scenario (72%
reduction). This means an energy efficiency improvement of 4.2%
per year in the Technical scenario and 3.1% per year in the
[R]evolution Scenario.

2. lighting Incandescent bulbs have been the most common lamps for
a more than 100 years. These are the most inefficient type of lighting,
however, since up to 95% of the electricity is converted into heat53.
Incandescent lamps have a relatively short life-span (average of
approximately 1,000 hours) but have a low initial cost and optimal
colour rendering. CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamps) are more
expensive than incandescent bulbs but they use about 75% less
energy, produce 75% less heat and last about ten times longer54. CFLs
are available in different sizes and shapes, for indoors and outdoors.

The usage pattern for different lighting technologies in different
countries is shown in Figure 10.10 (LFL = Linear Fluorescent Lamp).

Globally, people consume 3 Mega-lumen-hrs (Mlmh) of residential
electric light per capita/year. The average North American uses 13.2
Mlmh, the average Chinese 1.5 Mlmh - still 300 times the average
artificial per capita light use in England in the nineteenth century.
The average Japanese uses 18.5 Mlmh and the average European or
Australian 2.7Mlmh. There is a clear relationship between GDP per
capita and lighting consumption in Mlmh/cap/yr (see Figure 10.11).

It is important to realise that lighting energy savings are not just a
question of using more efficient lamps but also involve other
approaches. These include making smarter use of daylight, reducing
light absorption by luminaires (the fixture in which the lamp is
housed), optimising lighting levels (levels in OECD countries
commonly exceed recommended values), using automatic controls
(turn off when no one is present, dim artificial light in response to
rising daylight) and retrofitting buildings to make better use of
daylight. Buildings designed to optimise daylight can receive up to
70% of their annual illumination needs from daylight, while a typical
building will only get 20 to 25%55. In a study by Bertoldi & Atanasiu
(2006), national lighting consumption and CFL penetration data is
presented for the EU-27 countries (and candidate country Croatia).
We used this data as the basis for household penetration rates and
lighting electricity consumption in OECD Europe. As well as standby,
lighting is an important source of cost-effective savings. The IEA
publication “Light’s Labour’s Lost” (2006) projects that the cost-
effective savings potential from energy efficient lighting in 2030 is at
least 38% of lighting electricity consumption, even disregarding
newer and promising solid state lighting technologies such as light
emitting diodes (LEDs). In order to determine the savings potential
for lighting, it is important to know the percentage of households
with energy efficient lamps and the penetration level of these lamps.
Based on Bertoldi & Atanasiu (2006) and Waide (2006) we
calculated the shares shown in Table 10.7.

Based on the studies already cited we calculate that a maximum
of 80% savings can result from the introduction of efficient
residential lighting in the Technical scenario and 70% in the
[R]evolution Scenario. These savings not only include using energy
efficient lamps but behavioural changes and maximising daylight
use. Since the penetration of energy efficient lamps differs per
household, we have assumed that the savings potential is the
maximum saving multiplied by 1 minus the penetration rate.
The resulting savings are given in Table 10.8.

3. Set-top boxes Set-top boxes (STBs) are used to decode satellite
or cable television programmes and are a major new source of energy
demand. More than a billion are projected to be purchased worldwide
over the next decade. The energy use of an average set-top box is 20-
30 W, but it uses nearly the same amount of energy when switched
off56. In the USA, STB energy use is estimated at 15 TWh/year, or
about 1.3% of residential electricity use57. With more advanced uses,
for instance digital video recorders (DVRs), STB energy use is
forecast to triple to 45 TWh/year by 2010 – an 18% annual growth
rate and 4% of 2010 residential electricity use.

Because of their short lifetimes (on average five years) and high
ownership growth rates, STBs provide an opportunity for significant
short term energy savings. Cable/satellite boxes without DVRs use 100
to 200 kWh of electricity per year, whilst combined with DVRs they
use between 200 and 400 kWh per year. Media receiver boxes use less
energy (around 35 kWh per year) but must be used in conjunction
with existing audiovisual equipment and computers, thus adding
another 35 kWh to the annual energy use of existing home electronics.
Figure 10.12 shows the annual energy use of common household
appliances. This shows that the energy use of some set-top boxes
approaches that of the major energy consuming household appliances.

Reducing the energy use of set-top boxes is complicated by their
complex operating and communication modes. Although
improvements in power supply design and efficiency will be effective
in reducing energy use, the major savings will be obtained through
energy management measures. The study by Rainer et al (2004)
reports a savings potential of between 32% and 54% over five years
(2005-2010). Assuming that these drastic measures have not yet
been applied and due to lack of data on other regions, we have taken
these reduction percentages as the global potential up to 2050.

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

4. cold appliances The average household in OECD Europe
consumed 700 kWh/year of electricity for food refrigeration in 2000
compared with 1,034 kWh/year in Japan, 1 216 kWh/year in OECD
Australasia and 1,294 kWh/year in OECD North America. These
figures illustrate differences in average household storage capacities,
the ratio of frozen to fresh food use, ambient temperatures and
humidity, and food storage temperatures and control58. European
households typically either have a refrigerator-freezer in the kitchen
(sometimes with an additional freezer or refrigerator), or they have a
refrigerator and a separate freezer. Practical height and width limits
place constraints on the available internal storage space for an
appliance. Similar constraints apply in Japanese households, where
ownership of a single refrigerator-freezer is the norm, but are less
pressing in OECD North America and Australia. In these countries
almost all households have a refrigerator-freezer and many also have
a separate freezer and occasionally a separate refrigerator.

Looking in detail at the situation in the European Union, we found
that in 2003, 103 TWh of electricity was consumed by household cold
appliances alone (15% of total 2004 residential end use). A cold
appliance with an energy use rating of A++ uses 120 kWh per year,
while a comparable appliance with energy rating B uses 300 kWh per
year and with rating C 600 kWh per year59. The average energy rating
of appliances sold in the EU-15 countries is still B. If only A++
appliances were sold, energy consumption would be 60% less. The
average lifetime of a cold appliance is 15 years, which means that 15
years from the introduction of only A++ labelled appliances, 60% less
energy would be used in the EU-15. According to the European
Commission (see Table 10.9), consumption in TWh/y could decrease
from 103 in 2003 to 80 in 2010 with additional policies to encourage
efficient appliances. This means that the energy efficiency of cold
appliances could increase by about 3.5% each year.

Based on this analysis, we have assumed for the Technical scenario
an energy efficiency improvement of 3.5% per year from 2010
onwards. This would lead to an efficiency improvement of 77% in
2050. For the [R]evolution Scenario we have assumed a 2.5% per
year efficiency improvement, corresponding to 64% in 2050.

5. computers and servers The average desktop computer uses
about 120 W per hour - the monitor 75 W and the central
processing unit 45 W - and the average laptop 30 W per hour.
Current best practice monitors60 use only 18 W (15 inch screen),
which is 76% less than the average. Savings for computers are
especially important in the commercial sector. According to a 2006
US study, computers and monitors have the highest energy
consumption in an office after lighting. In Europe, office equipment
use is considered to be less important (see Figure 4), but estimates
differ widely61. Some studies have shown that automatic and/or
manual power management of computers and monitors can
significantly reduce their energy consumption.

A power managed computer consumes less than half the energy of a
computer without power management62, depending on how your
computer is used; power management can reduce the annual energy
consumption of a computer and monitor by as much as 80%63.
Approximately half of all office computers are left on overnight and
at weekends (75% of the time). Apart from switching off at night,
using LCD (liquid crystal display) monitors requires less energy than
CRT (cathode ray tube). An average LCD screen uses 79% less
energy than an average CRT monitor if both are power-managed64.
Further savings can be made by ensuring computers enter low power
mode when they are idle during the day. Another benefit of
decreasing the power consumption of computers and monitors is
that it reduces the load for air conditioning. According to a 2002
study by Roth et al, office equipment increases the air conditioning
load by 0.2-0.5 kW per kW of office equipment power consumption.

The average computer with a CRT monitor in constant operation uses
1,236 kWh/y (482kWh/y for the computer and 754kWh/y for the
monitor). With power management this reduces to 190kWh/y
(86+104). Effective power management can save 1,046kWh per
computer and CRT monitor per year, a reduction of 84%, or 505kWh
per computer and LCD monitor per year. These examples illustrate
that power management can have a greater effect than just more
efficient equipment. The German website EcoTopten, for example, says
that more efficient computers save 50-70% compared with older
models and efficient flat-screens use 70% less energy than CRTs.

Servers are multiprocessor systems running commercial workloads65. The
typical breakdown of peak power server use is shown in Table 10.10.

Data centres are facilities that primarily contain electronic
equipment used for data processing, data storage and
communications networking66. 80% of servers are located in these
data centres67. Worldwide, about three million data centres and 32
million servers are in operation. Approximately 25% of servers are
located in the EU, but only 10% of data centres, meaning that on
average each data centre hosts a relatively large number of servers
(Fichter, 2007). The installed base of servers is growing rapidly due
to an increasing demand for data processing and storage. New
digital services such as music downloads, video-on-demand, online
banking, electronic trading, satellite navigation and internet
telephony spur this rapid growth, as well as the increasing
penetration of computers and the internet in developing countries.
Since systems have become more and more complex to handle
increasingly large amounts of data, power and energy consumption
(about 50% used for cooling68) have grown in parallel. The power
density of data centres is rising by approximately 15% each year69.
Aggregate electricity use for servers doubled over the period 2000
to 2005 both in the US and worldwide (see Figure 10.13). Data
centres accounted for roughly 1% of global electricity use in 2005
(14 GW) (Koomey, 2007).

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

Power and energy consumption are key concerns for internet data
centres and there is a significant potential for energy efficiency
improvements. Existing technologies and design strategies have
been shown to reduce the energy use of a typical server by 25% or
more70. Energy management efforts in existing data centres could
reduce their energy usage by around 20%, according to the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The US EPA scenario for reducing server energy use includes
measures such as enabling power management, consolidating
servers and storage, using liquid instead of air cooling, improving
the efficiency of chillers, pumps, fans and transformers and using
combined heat and power. This bundle of measures could reduce
electricity use by up to 56% compared to current efficiency trends
(or 60% compared to historical trends), the EPA concludes,
representing the maximum technical potential by 2011. This
assumes that only 50% of current data centres can introduce these
measures. A significant savings potential is therefore available for
servers and data centres around the world by 2050. For computers
and servers we have based the savings potential on the WBCSD
2005 report and other sources mentioned in this section. For the
Technical scenario this would result in 70% savings, for the
[R]evolution Scenario 55% savings.

6. air conditioning Today in the USA, some 14 % of total electrical
consumption is used to air condition buildings71. Increasing use of
small air conditioning units (less than 12 kW output cooling power) in
southern European cities, mainly during the summer months, is also
driving up electricity consumption. Total residential electricity
consumption for air conditioners in the EU-25 in 2005 was estimated
to be between 7 and 10 TWh per year72. However, we should not
underestimate the consumption in developing countries. Many of these
are located in warm climatic zones. With the rapid development of its
economy and improving living standards, central air conditioning units
are now widely used in China, for example. They currently account for
about 20% of total Chinese electricity consumption73.

There are several options for technological savings in air conditioning
equipment. One is to use a different refrigerant. Tests with the
refrigerant Ikon B show possible energy consumption reductions of 20-
25% compared to the commonly used liquids74. However, behavioural
changes should not be overlooked. One example of a smart alternative
to cooling a whole house was developed by the company Evening
Breeze. This combined a mosquito net, bed and air conditioning so that
only the bed had to be cooled instead of the whole bedroom.

There are also other options for cooling, such as geothermal cooling by
heat pumps. This uses the same principle as geothermal heating, namely
that the temperature at a certain depth below the Earth’s surface
remains constant year round. In the winter we can use this relatively
high temperature to warm our houses. Conversely, we can use the
relatively cold temperature in the summer to cool our houses. There are
several technical concepts available, but all rely on transferring the heat
from the air in the building to the Earth. A refrigerant is used as the
heat transfer medium. This concept is cost-effective75. Heat pumps have
been gaining market share in a number of countries76.

Solar energy can also be used for cooling through the use of solar
thermal energy or solar electricity to power a cooling appliance. Basic
types of solar cooling technologies include absorption cooling (uses solar
thermal energy to vapourise the refrigerant); desiccant cooling (uses
solar thermal energy to regenerate (dry) the desiccant); vapour
compression cooling (uses solar thermal energy to operate a Rankine-
cycle heat engine); evaporative cooling; and heat pumps and air
conditioners that can be powered by solar photovoltaic systems. To drive
the pumps only 0.05 kWh of electricity is needed, instead of 0.35 kWh
for regular air conditioning77, representing a savings potential of 85%.

Not only is it important to use efficient air conditioning equipment,
it is equally important to reduce the need for air conditioning in the
first place. Important ways to reduce cooling demand are to use
insulation to prevent heat from entering the building, to reduce the
amount of inefficient appliances present in the house, such as
incandescent lamps or old refrigerators that give off unusable heat,
to use cool exterior finishes, such as ‘cool roof’ technology or light-
coloured wall paint, to improve windows and use vegetation to
reduce the amount of heat that comes into the house, and to use
ventilation instead of air conditioning units.

For air conditioning we have assumed that the savings potential
based on the 2005 WBCSD study and other sources mentioned in
this section will amount to 70% savings under the Technical
scenario and 55% savings under the [R]evolution Scenario.

total household savings

Total savings from the previous sections are summarised here. Table
10.11 shows the total savings in percentages up to 2050. These
need to be translated into energy efficiency improvements per year
to compare them with the Reference Scenario. Since it is not clear
what assumptions this is based on, we have assumed an efficiency
improvement of 1% per year. Subtracting this from the reduction
potentials in Table 10.12 shows the energy efficiency improvements
per year measured against the Reference Scenario. Electricity use
in the ‘Other’ sector is assumed to decline at the same rate as
residential electricity use (lighting, appliances, cold appliances,
computers/servers and air conditioning). We have assumed a
minimum energy efficiency improvement of 1.2% in the Technical
scenario and 1.1% in the [R]evolution Scenario, including
autonomous improvements.

energy efficiency standards
- steps towards an energy equity

figure 10.14: energy equity through efficiency standards

the standard household

In order to enable a specific level of energy demand as a basic
“right” for all people in the world, we have developed the model of
an efficient Standard Household. A fully equipped OECD household
(including fridge, oven, TV, radio, music centre, computer, lights etc.)
currently consumes between 1,500 and 3,400 kWh/a per person.
With an average of two to four people per household the total
consumption is therefore between 3,000 and 12,000 kWh/a. This
demand could be reduced to about 550 kWh/a per person just by
using the most efficient appliances available on the market today.
This does not even include any significant lifestyle changes. Based
on this assumption, the ‘over-consumption’ of all households in
OECD countries totals more than 2,100 billion kilowatt-hours.
Comparing this figure with the current per capita consumption in
developing countries, they would have the right to use about 1,350
billion kilowatt-hours more. The ‘oversupply’ of OECD households
could therefore fill the gap in energy supply to developing countries
one and a half times over.

By implementing a strict technical standard for all
electrical appliances, in order to achieve a level of 550
kWh/a per capita consumption, it would be possible
to switch off more than 340 coal power plants
in OECD countries.

energy efficiency standards
- the potential is huge

Setting energy efficiency standards for electrical equipment could
have a huge impact on the world’s power sector. A large number of
power plants could be switched off if strict technical standards
were brought into force. The table below provides an overview of the
theoretical potential for using efficiency standards based on

currently available technology. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario
has not been calculated on the basis of this theoretical potential.
However, this overview illustrates how many power plants producing
electricity would not be needed if all global appliances were
brought up to the highest efficiency standards overnight.

Transport is a key element in reducing the level of greenhouse gases
produced by energy consumption. 28% of current energy use comes
from the transport sector – road, rail and sea. In order to assess
the present status of global transport, including its carbon
footprint, a special study was undertaken by Ecofys.

(cid:129) Medium duty trucks include medium haul trucks and delivery vehicles.

(cid:129) Buses have been divided into two size classes - full size buses and
minibuses - with the latter roughly encompassing the range of
small buses and large passenger vans prevalent around the
developing world and typically used for informal transit services.

This chapter gives an overview of how the Ecofys Reference
Scenario was originated and the changes expected under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario. The following chapter looks specifically at the
technical efficiency potential for cars. The main actions proposed in
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario are: increasing the use of public
transport, especially trains, reducing the number of kilometres driven
each year by private cars, and introducing more efficient vehicles.

the reference scenario for transport

In order to calculate possible savings in the transport sector, we
first need to construct a detailed Reference Scenario. This needs to
include detailed shares and energy intensity data per mode of
transport and per region up to 2050. Although this data cannot be
found in the IEA WEO, input is available from the WBCSD (World
Business Council for Sustainable Development) mobility database.
This database was completed in 2004 after collaboration between
the IEA and the WBCSD’s Sustainable Mobility Project to develop
a global transport model. Those transport options have been
selected which can be expected to result in a substantial reduction
in energy demand up to 2050.

In order to estimate the energy demand per transport sub-sector, we
need the modal shares per region up to 2050. These can be
calculated by using the WBCSD final energy use per mode, adding
them together and working out the share per mode in % by region
from 2005-2050. In the OECD, for example, light duty vehicles
(LDVs) account for 57% of total energy use, heavy trucks for 15%.

Since international shipping spreads across all regions of the world,
it has been left out whilst calculating the baseline figures. The total
is therefore made up of LDVs, heavy and medium duty freight, two
to three wheel vehicles, buses, minibuses, rail, air and national
marine transport. Although energy use from international marine
bunkers (international shipping fuel suppliers) is not included in
these calculations, it is still estimated to account for 9% of
worldwide transport final energy demand in 2005 and 7% by
2050. A recent UN report concluded that carbon dioxide emissions
from shipping are much greater than initially thought and
increasing at an alarming rate. It is therefore very important to
improve the energy efficiency of international shipping. Possible
options are examined later in this chapter.

The definitions of different transport modes for this scenario78 are:

(cid:129) Light-duty vehicles (LDVs) are defined as four-wheel vehicles
used primarily for personal passenger road travel. These are
typically cars, SUVs (Sports Utility Vehicles), small passenger
vans (up to eight seats) and personal pickup trucks. Within this
report we will sometimes call light-duty vehicles simply ‘cars’.

(cid:129) Heavy duty trucks are defined here as long haul trucks operating
almost exclusively on diesel fuel. These trucks carry large loads
with lower energy intensity (energy use per tonne-kilometre of
haulage) than medium duty trucks such as delivery trucks.

As can be seen from the above figures, the largest share of energy
demand comes from cars, although it slightly decreases from 48%
in 2005 to 44% in 2050. The share of air transport increases from
13% to 19%. Of particular note is the high share of road transport
in total transport energy demand: 82% in 2005 and 74% in 2050.

As we can see, OECD Europe has the highest final energy use,
followed by OECD North America and OECD Pacific. Over time, the
shares of these regions will decrease while the shares of all other
regions will increase. In 2050, OECD Europe will still be the
largest final energy user, but now followed by China. Figure 11.3
and Figure 11.4 show the forecast worldwide growth of different
passenger and freight transport modes. Light duty vehicles will
remain the most important mode of passenger transport, air,

passenger rail and two wheeled transport are expected to grow
considerably, while three wheeled transport is expected to grow only
slightly. Buses and minibus passenger transport is expected to
decline a little. Heavy duty trucks will remain the most important
mode of freight transport. Freight rail, inland navigation and
medium duty trucks will also increase, but will remain ‘inferior’
modes in the Reference Scenario.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

the future of the transport sector in the energy
[r]evolution scenario

The Reference Scenario shows that changes in patterns of
passenger travel are partly a consequence of growing wealth. As
GDP per capita increases, people tend to migrate towards faster,
more flexible and more expensive travel modes (from buses and
trains to cars and air). With faster modes, people also tend to
travel further and do not reduce the amount of time spent
travelling79. There is also a strong correlation between GDP growth
and increases in freight transport. More economic activity will
mean more transport of raw materials, intermediary products and
final consumer goods.

All the above figures and tables illustrate the importance of both a
modal shift and a slowing of growth in forecast transport if
emissions reductions are to be achieved. Furthermore, it is very
important to make the remaining transport as clean as possible,
signalling the role of energy efficiency improvements. Unlimited
growth in the transport sector is simply not an option. A shift
towards a sustainable energy system, which respects natural limits
and saves the world’s climate, requires a mix of lifestyle changes
and new technologies. We basically need to use our cars less, fly
less and use more public transport, as well as cutting down the
transport kilometres for freight transport whilst introducing more
new and highly efficient vehicles.

technical potentials We have looked at three options for
decreasing energy demand in the transport sector:

(cid:129) Reduction of transport demand.

(cid:129) Modal shift from high energy intensive transport modes to low

energy intensity.

(cid:129) Energy efficiency improvements.

step 1: reduction of transport demand
A reduction in transport demand involves reducing passenger-km per
capita and reducing freight transport demand. The amount of freight
transport is to a large extent linked to GDP development and
therefore difficult to influence. However, by improved logistics, for
example optimal load profiles for trucks, the demand can be limited.

passenger transport First we must look at reducing passenger
transport demand. For this we need to examine the transport
demand per capita in the Reference Scenario, as shown in Table
11.3. This shows that transport demand is highest in OECD North
America, followed by the OECD Pacific. Demand per capita is
lowest in Africa and India.

The potential for reducing passenger transport demand is very difficult
to determine. For OECD countries we have assumed that transport
demand per capita can be reduced by 10% by 2050 in comparison to
the Reference Scenario. For the non-OECD countries we have assumed
in the [R]evolution Scenario – as a matter of equity - no reduction in
transport demand per capita because the current demand is already
quite low in comparison to the OECD. We have made an exception for
the Transition Economies, where we assume that transport demand
per capita can be reduced by 5% in 2050.

The table below shows the profile of passenger transport demand
per capita in 2005, development under the Reference Scenario by
2050 and the reduced transport demand under the [R]evolution
Scenario, broken down by region.

freight transport In the Reference Scenario the largest absolute
increase in freight transport demand is expected in the Transition
Economies, whilst the largest percentage increase is forecast in China
(383%). The potential for reducing demand for freight transport by
improved logistics is difficult to estimate. For the [R]evolution
Scenario we have assumed that freight transport demand can be
reduced by 5% in comparison to the Reference Scenario, although
only through measures in the OECD and Transition Economies.

step 2: changes in transport mode
In order to decide which vehicles or transport systems are the most
effective for each purpose, an analysis of the different technologies
is needed. To calculate the energy savings achieved by shifting
transport mode we need to know the energy use and intensity for
each type of transport80. The following information is needed:

(cid:129) Passenger transport: Energy demand per passenger kilometre,

measured in MJ/p-km.

(cid:129) Freight transport: Energy demand per kilometre of transported

tonne of goods, measured in MJ/ tonne-km.

development of passenger transport Passenger transport includes
cars, minibuses, two and three wheelers, buses, passenger rail and air
transport. Freight transport includes medium trucks, heavy trucks,
national marine and freight rail. The figures below show a breakdown
of passenger transport by mode in the Reference Scenario for 2005
and 2050 (as % of total passenger-km). The global demand for air
transport is expected to grow from 12% in 2005 to 23% in 2050.

travelling by rail is the most efficient Figure 11.8 shows the
worldwide average specific energy consumption by transport mode
under the Reference Scenario in 2005 and 2050. This data differs
for each region. As can be seen, the difference in specific energy
consumption for each transport mode is large. Passenger transport
by rail will consume 85% less energy in 2050 than car transport
and by bus nearly 70% less energy. This means that there is a large
energy savings potential to be realised by a modal shift.

modal shift for passengers in the energy [r]evolution scenario
From the figures above we can conclude that in order to reduce
transport energy demand by modal shift, passengers have to move from
cars and air transport to the lower intensity passenger rail and bus
transport. As an indication of the action required we can take Japan as
a ‘best practice country’. In 2004, Japan had a large share of p-km by
rail (29%) thanks to the fact that it had established a strong urban and
regional rail system81. Comparing different regions with the example of
Japan, and assuming that 40 years is enough time to build up an
extensive rail network, the following modal shifts have been assumed:

transport energy intensity for 2005 and 2050.

in car transport of 7.5% in comparison to the Reference Scenario.

transporting goods by rail is the most efficient Figure 11.12
shows the energy intensity for world average freight transport in
2005 and 2050 under the Reference Scenario. Energy intensity for
all modes of transport is expected to decrease by 2050.

freight transport Figures 11.9 and 11.10 show the breakdown of
freight transport in percentages of total tonnes-km per year and by
region under the Reference Scenario. Both the Transition Economies
and China have a very large proportion of rail transport while the
Developing Asia and the Middle East have a very small share. The
share of heavy and medium trucks is very large in the Developing Asia
countries and OECD Europe. National marine transport plays an
important role in the OECD Pacific. The figures also show that the
difference between 2005 and 2050 is relatively small.

modal shift for transporting goods in the energy [r]evolution
scenario From the figures above we can conclude that in order to
reduce transport energy demand by modal shift, freight has to move
from medium and heavy duty trucks to the less energy intensive
freight rail and national marine. Canada is a ‘best practice’ country
in this respect, with 29% of freight transported by trucks, 39% by
rail and 32% by ships. Since the use of ships largely depends on
the geography of the country, we do not propose a modal shift for
national ships but instead a shift towards freight rail. China, OECD
Pacific and the Transition Economies already have a low share of
truck usage, so for these regions we will not assume a modal shift.
For the other regions we have assumed the following changes:

marine transport Since the WBCSD did not provide estimates for
total national marine tonnes-km per year or energy intensities per
region, we have calculated these ourselves. Data for energy intensity
for the year 2005 in OECD countries was found in OECD/IEA, 2007.
For other regions we have assumed that the highest OECD estimate
would hold. The 2050 intensities were extrapolated from 2005 data
using 1% per year autonomous efficiency improvement. The amount
of t-km per year could then be calculated using the Reference
Scenario energy use divided by the energy intensity in MJ/t-km.

Introduced to commercial operation in 2007, the SkySails system allows
wind power, which has no fuel costs, to contribute to the motive power of
large freight-carrying ships, which currently use increasingly expensive
and environmentally damaging oil. Instead of a traditional sail fitted to a
mast, the system uses large towing kites to contribute to the ship’s
propulsion. Shaped like paragliders, they are tethered to the vessel by
ropes and can be controlled automatically, responding to wind conditions
and the ship’s trajectory.

The kites can operate at altitudes of between 100 and 300 metres,
where stronger and more stable winds prevail. By means of dynamic
flight patterns, the SkySails are able to generate five times more
power per square metre of sail area than conventional sails. Depending
on the prevailing winds, the company claims that a ship’s average
annual fuel costs can be reduced by 10 to 35%. Under optimal wind
conditions, fuel consumption can temporarily be cut by up to 50%.

On the first voyage of the Beluga SkySails, a 133m long specially
built cargo ship, the towing kite propulsion system was able to
temporarily substitute for approximately 20 % of the vessel’s main
engine power, even in moderate winds. The company is now planning
a kite twice the size of this 160m2 pilot.

The designers say that virtually all sea-going cargo vessels can be
retro- or outfitted with the SkySails propulsion system without
extensive modifications. If 1,600 ships would be equiped with these
sails by 2015 ,it would save over 146 million tonnes of CO2 a year,
equivalent to about 15% of Germany’s total emissions.

step 3: efficiency improvements or travelling with less energy
Energy efficiency improvements are the third important way of
reducing transport energy demand. This section explains the
different possibilities for improving energy efficiency82 up to 2050
for each type of transport:

(cid:129) Passenger and freight trains

(cid:129) Buses and mini-buses

(cid:129) Trucks

(cid:129) Ships for marine transport

(cid:129) Cars

air transport Savings for air transport have been taken from
Akerman, 2005. He reports that a 65% reduction in fuel use is
technically feasible by 2050. This has been applied to 2005 energy
intensity data in order to calculate the technical potential. The
figure below shows the energy intensity per region in the Reference
Scenario and in the two low energy demand scenarios.

passenger and freight trains Savings for passenger and freight
rail transport have been taken from Fulton & Eads (2004). They
report a historic improvement in the fuel economy of passenger rail
of 1% per year and for freight rail of between 2 and 3% per year.
Since no other studies are available we have assumed for the
Technical scenario a 1% improvement of in energy efficiency per
year for passenger rail and 2.5% for freight rail. The figure below
shows the energy intensity per region in the Reference Scenario and
in the two low energy demand scenarios.

Energy intensities for passenger rail transport are assumed to be the
same for all regions due to a lack of sufficiently detailed data. The
differentiation in energy intensity for freight rail is based on the
following assumption: regions with longer average distances for freight
rail (such as the US and Former Soviet Union), and where more raw
materials are transported (such as coal), show a lower energy intensity
than other regions (Fulton & Eads, 2004). Future projections use ten
year historic IEA data. Rail intensities are and will remain highest in
OECD Europe and OECD Pacific and lowest in India.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

buses and minibuses The company Enova Systems is promoting a
‘clean bus’ with a 100% improvement in fuel economy. We have
adopted this improvement and applied it to 2005 energy intensity
numbers per region. For minibuses the American Council for an
Energy Efficient Economy reports83 a fuel economy improvement of
55% by 2015. Since this is a very ambitious target and will most
likely not be reached, we have extended it up to 2050 and adopted it
as the technical potential (see Figure 11.16 and Figure 11.17).
Currently, buses in North America consume far and away the most
energy. The Reference Scenario predicts an increase in all regions
between 2005 and 2050. Although in general more efficient buses are
being produced, this is offset by increases in average bus size, weight
and power. OECD buses have much more powerful engines than non-
OECD buses, but the latter are likely to catch up over this period.

trucks (freight by road) Elliott et al., 2006 give possible savings
for heavy and medium-duty freight trucks. This list of reduction
options is expanded in Lensink and De Wilde, 2007. For medium
duty trucks a fuel economy saving of 50% is reported by 2030
(mainly due to hybridisation). We applied this percentage to 2005
energy intensity data, calculated the fuel economy improvement per
year and extrapolated this yearly growth rate up to 2050. For heavy
duty trucks we applied the same methodology, arriving at a 39%
savings. Current intensities are highest in the Middle East, India and
Africa and lowest in OECD North America. The Reference Scenario
predicts that future values will converge, assuming past improvement
percentages and assuming a higher learning rate in developing
regions. The figures below show the energy intensity per region in the
Reference Scenario and in the two low energy demand scenarios.

marine transport National marine savings have also been taken
from the Lensink and De Wilde study. They report 20% savings in
2030 for inland navigation as a realistic potential with currently
available technology, and ultimate efficiency savings of up to 30%
for the current fleet. To arrive at the potential in 2050, we used the
same approach as described for road freight above. OECD Pacific
has the lowest current energy intensity due to the fact that they
have a large proportion of long haul trips where larger (less energy
intensive) boats can be used. All energy intensities are expected to
improve by 1% per year up to 2050. Reference Scenario energy
intensities and the technical potentials for national marine
transport are shown in Figure 11.20.

motorcycles For two wheelers we have based the potential on
IEA/SMP (2004), where 0.3 MJ/p.km is the lowest value. For
three wheelers we have assumed that the technical potential is 0.5
MJ/p.km in 2050. The uncertainty in these potentials is high,
although two and three wheelers only account for 1.5% of
transport energy demand.

The figures below show the energy intensity per region in the
Reference Scenario and in the two low energy demand scenarios.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

passenger cars This section is based on a special study conducted
by the DLR’s Institute for Vehicle Concepts to investigate the
potential for improving the efficiency of existing cars and moving
towards greater use of hybrid or electric vehicles. See Chapter 12
for a full account of this analysis.

Many technologies can be used to improve the fuel efficiency of
passenger cars. Examples include improvements in engines, weight
reduction and friction and drag reduction84. The impact of the various
measures on fuel efficiency can be substantial. Hybrid vehicles,
combining a conventional combustion engine with an electric engine,
have relatively low fuel consumption. The most well-known is the
Toyota Prius, which originally had a fuel efficiency of about five litres
of gasoline-equivalent per 100 km (litre ge/100 km). Recently, Toyota
presented an improved version with a lower fuel consumption of 4.3
litres ge/100 km. Further developments are underway, as shown by
the presentation of new concept cars by the main US car
manufacturers in 2000 with a specific fuel use as low as three litres
ge/100 km. There are suggestions that applying new lightweight
materials, in combination with the new propulsion technologies, can
bring fuel consumption levels down to 1 litre ge/100 km.

Based on SRU (2005), the technical potential in 2050 for a diesel
fuelled car is 1.6 and for a petrol car 2.0 litres ge/100 km. Based on
the sources in Table 11.6, we have assumed 2.0 litres as the technical
potential for Europe and adopted the same improvement in efficiency
(about 3% per year) for other regions. In order to reach this target
in time, these more efficient cars need to be on the market by 2030 –
assuming that the maximum lifetime of a car is 20 years.

The energy intensities for car passenger transport are currently
highest in OECD North America and Africa and lowest in OECD
Europe. The Reference Scenario shows a decrease in energy
intensities in all regions, but the division between highest and lowest
will remain the same, although there will be some convergence. We
have assumed that the occupancy rate for cars remains the same as
in 2005, as shown in the figure below.

“if we’re serious about
facing up to climate
change, we need to
improve ALL our cars.”

GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL
CLIMATE CAMPAIGN

174

Since the global use of privately owned cars (light duty vehicles)
currently accounts for more carbon dioxide emissions than any other
form of transport, the DLR’s Institute for Vehicle Concepts was
commissioned to look specifically at the potential for reductions in
this sector. At the same time, the door has already been opened for
both major technological changes and shifts in personal habits.
Rising oil prices, increasing concern about climate change and, in
some regions, legislation on everything from bio fuels to vehicle
emissions, have together combined to put pressure on international
vehicle manufacturers to investigate solutions. Numerous technical
fixes are already in production which can improve the efficiency of
the predominant internal combustion engine, as well as moving
towards alternatives no longer based on fossil fuels.

This specific study of the light duty vehicle market concludes that a
number of measures could help reduce the CO2 emissions from cars
very significantly to a target level of about 80 g CO2 per km for the
European Union. These measures include a major shift to vehicles
powered by (renewable) electricity, a range of efficiency
improvements to the power trains of existing internal combustion
engines and behavioural changes leading to an overall reduction in
kilometres travelled.

methodology

The DLR developed a global scenario for cars based on a detailed
bottom-up model covering ten world regions. The aim was to
produce a challenging but feasible scenario which would lower
global CO2 emissions within the context of the overall emission
reduction objective. Cars contribute about 45% of the greenhouse
gas emissions from the entire transport sector, the largest
proportion of any mode.

This approach takes into account a vast range of technical
measures to reduce the energy consumption of vehicles, but also
considers the dramatic increase in vehicle ownership and annual
mileage taking place in developing countries. The turnover of
replacement vehicles has been modelled over five year stages from
2005 to 2050. The scenario assumes that a large share of
renewable electricity is available in the future. The major
parameters for achieving increased efficiency are:

(cid:129) vehicle technology

(cid:129) alternative fuels

(cid:129) changes in sales by vehicle size

(cid:129) changes in vehicle kilometres travelled

This section will examine the development of the world’s car fleet in
more detail and is focused on non-technical as well as technical
solutions. Light duty vehicles and their technologies are divided into
three vehicle segments (small, medium and large) and nine
categories of fuel/propulsion technology:

As a Reference Scenario for the starting point in 2005, the analysis in
the IEA/SMP model85 has been used. This is the most comprehensive and
detailed model available for CO2 emissions from the global transport
sector. For those technologies not included in the SMP model, we had to
decide starting points for today’s performance values (see below). We
then created so-called ‘target reference vehicles’ (TRVs), which project
the energy consumption feasible for each of the main fuel conversion
technologies. This is described in the section ‘Future vehicle technologies’.
The TRVs will be introduced in the different regions of the world over a
varying timescale. In general, the technologies to achieve the TRVs are
aimed to be available for sale in 2050 - 42 years from now.

In general, we have first introduced the most recent - and most
expensive - technologies in the currently industrialised countries, and
postponed their introduction in the rest of the world. We have then used
the option to change the energy source used to fuel light duty transport.
This is described in the section ‘Projection of future technology mix’.
Various non-technical measures are reflected in the projections for
future vehicle sales (see ‘Projection of vehicle segment split’), in the
projection for the absolute number of vehicles sold in the future (see
‘Projection of global vehicle stock development’) and in the projection
of how much individual vehicles are used compared to other transport
means in the future (see ‘Projection of kilometres driven’).

reference scenario

The IEA Reference Scenario developed for the Mobility 2030 project86
was used as the starting point for the year 2005 key data and for
comparison as a ‘business as usual’ scenario. It is important to note that
for this scenario no major new policies were assumed to be implemented
beyond those already introduced by 2003. While for some areas, such as
pollution control, further so called policy trajectories have been
assumed, this was not the case for fuel consumption. Trends in future
fuel consumption are therefore based on historical (non-policy driven)
trends87. If the serious discussions taking place in Europe and the United
States on the regulation of fuel economy in new vehicles, together with
legal guidelines and proposed long term targets, were taken into
account, the business as usual case would be different. However, it is
beyond the scope of this project to redefine the status quo. Nevertheless,
we include the most recent political targets in our scenario.

energy [r]evolution car scenario

The alternative car scenario is targeted towards high CO2
reductions compared to today’s levels. Summarised in brief, we
have focused on the following proposals:

(cid:129) Efficiency improvements resulting from technological development

(cid:129) Renewable electricity as the primary alternative fuel

(cid:129) Influencing customer behaviour in the long term

There is a huge potential for technological options to make today’s
vehicles more efficient while lowering their CO2 emissions. A car
today converts the energy in the fuel into mechanical energy in
order to take the compartment we sit in from point A to B, but it
does it in a very inefficient way. Only 25% to 35% of the chemical
energy in the fuel is converted into mechanical energy by the
engine. The rest is lost as waste heat. Only 10% of the fuel energy
is used to overcome driving resistance. Hybrid technologies mark an
important starting point for making vehicles more efficient, whilst
technologies to lower energy demand, such as lightweight design,
reduced rolling resistance wheels and improved aerodynamics, will
contribute to the achievement of very low fuel consumptions.

Renewable electricity can be produced almost everywhere in the
world, and with declining costs in the future. Taking into account
the enormous development in batteries in recent years, we believe
that electric mobility as offered by battery electric cars and plug-in
hybrid electric vehicles is the preferred way to make major
reductions in the CO2 emissions of cars.

Consumer behaviour is the third major key to a lower carbon world
for the transport sector. Here we have relied on programmes,
incentives and policy measures to support a shift towards low
carbon emitting vehicles as well as reducing demand in general.

future vehicle technologies

gasoline and diesel cars

The global vehicle market, with about 55 million vehicles sold per
year, is enormous. Around 500 automobile plants produce this huge
quantity. Regional markets differ in the size of vehicles and fuel type
used. Depending on income, infrastructure and the spatial
characteristics of the countries, people have different preferences for
the size of vehicles they use.

The propulsion technology used in all new cars globally does not
differ very much, however. For the sake of simplicity, therefore, we
have defined the reference target vehicles, which we use throughout
the world, as characterised by their energy consumption ‘tank-to-
wheel’, independent of the fuel used. The energy consumption for the
reference target vehicles are presented in Figure 12.3.

Differences in energy consumption ‘tank-to-wheel’ shown in Figure 12.3
reflect the different efficiencies with which vehicles convert fuel energy
into movement. The various fuels and energy sources have different
qualities, depending on their upstream production processes. This is
taken into account in the model. In the light of high energy prices and
thus growing costs for individual mobility, we foresee a market for
dedicated small commuter vehicles. These cars would serve
predominantly for the transport of a single person, reflecting today’s
car usage in industrialised countries. Although there will still be seats
for three to five people, the comfort for the car passengers will be less.
Therefore the ‘small’ passenger vehicle of the future is projected to be
smaller than it is today and therefore less energy intensive88.

Due to the differences in income level between the world’s regions,
which we have assumed to be still valid in 2050, the reference
target vehicles are applied to new vehicle sales in the year 2050 for
today’s most industrialised regions: OECD Europe, North America
and OECD Pacific. For all other regions, they are envisaged to enter
the market in 2060, ten years later, and 20 years later in Africa.

For traditional internal combustion engines, we have only allowed
here for improvements in starting and stopping and no other hybrid
features. Other vehicle adaptations to be introduced up to 2050 are
described in more detail below.

For the small car sector we project a 1.8 litre/100 km (NEDC) four-
seater diesel vehicle, as described in simulations by Friedrich89. We
found corresponding results from our own simulations for a low-energy
concept car with space for three adults and two children. For gasoline,
we project 2.4 l/100 km. For the medium size sector, we project the
potential for a 50% reduction in CO2 for gasoline cars and 42% for
diesel cars. Approximately half of these reductions will be derived from
power train improvements (including starting and stopping) and half
from an improvement in energy demand. Aerodynamics, rolling
resistance and lightweight design will contribute as described below.

For the large size sector, a slightly higher 60% emissions reduction
is predicted, resulting from higher mass reduction and greater
downsizing potentials (due to current over-motorisation). In
addition, we have assumed political measures have been introduced,
such as luxury taxes, in addition to high fuel costs, to reduce the
sales of very large SUVs (Sport Utility Vehicles) for passenger
transport. This means that the size of vehicles within the segment
will also decrease over the years. Examples of future cross-over
SUVs are projected, for example by Lovins and Cramer90.

Although considerable improvements are in sight for conventional
gasoline and diesel engines without hybridisation, they will be
technically hard to reach. Significant CO2 reductions in the short to
medium term will therefore be much easier and cheaper to achieve
with the hybridisation of power trains.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

hybrid vehicles

Hybrid drive trains consist of at least two different energy converters
and two energy storage units. The most common is the hybrid-electric
drive train, although there are also proposals for kinetic and
hydraulic hybrids. Advantages of the combination of the internal
combustion engine with a second source of power arise from avoiding
inefficient working regimes of the internal combustion engine (ICE),
recuperation of braking energy, engine displacement downsizing and
automated gear switch. For hybrid-electric vehicles, there are several
different architectures and levels of hybridisation proposed.

Hybrid vehicles have been available since the 1990s. In 2006,
approximately 400,000 hybrid cars were sold, which is less than 1%
of world car production. An increasing number of hybrid models are
being announced, however. For this study we have used reference
values of 491, 4.592, 8.393 lge/100 km respectively for small, medium
and large gasoline vehicles94.

For the reference target vehicles in 2050, we have projected the
following values, depending on the vehicle segment.

small segment: As explained above, the small segment vehicles will
be of the ‘1 litre car’ type - smaller and lighter than today. A
dedicated vehicle in the 500 kg class, with three seats and with a
highly efficient propulsion system, will be standard by 2050,
especially for commuting or other journeys were no multi-purpose
family type vehicle is necessary. The fuel consumption for this type of
vehicle is projected to be 1.6 lge/100 km.

medium segment: We developed our vision of reaching 60 g CO2
per km for the medium segment following the technological building
blocks described below, although this might not be the only way to
reach the target.

(cid:129) A 25% emissions reduction is envisaged by using turbo charging

with variable turbine geometry, external cooled exhaust gas
recirculation, gasoline direct injection (2nd generation) and
variable valve control/cam phase shifting with respective
scavenging strategies. These measures all result in a downsizing
and down speeding of the engine95.

(cid:129) An additional potential for a 25% saving, related to the previous step,
will come from hybridisation and the benefits in terms of start/stop
improvements, regenerative braking and further downsizing. Waste
heat recovery by thermoelectric generators will contribute to the on-
board power supply, which saves an additional 3 to 5%96 97.

(cid:129) A reduction in the vehicle’s mass from 360 kg to 1,000 kg will reduce
energy demand by about 18%98. To achieve lightweight construction,
methods such as topology optimisation, multi-material design and highly
integrated components will be used. Mass reductions of 60 to 120 kg
for midsized cars have already been achieved99. The production and
recycling processes of lightweight materials such as magnesium and
carbon fibres will also be improved in 30-40 years time, thus avoiding a
shift in emissions from the utilisation to the production phase.

(cid:129) Aerodynamic resistance, aerodynamic drag and frontal areas offer

further potential for improvements. By optimising the car’s
underside, engine air flows and contours we project an additional
lowering of energy demand by 8%.

(cid:129) Rolling resistance depends on the material used for the tyre, the
construction of the tyre and its radius, tyre pressures and driving
speed. The tyre industry has proposed new concepts for wheels which
are intended to lower rolling resistance by 50% by 2030100 101.
Reducing the rolling coefficient by 1/1000 will lead to fuel savings of
0.08 l/100 km102. This results in an additional 12% CO2 savings.

(cid:129) Further potentials for energy savings will come from ‘intelligent
controllers’ which improve energy management and drive train
control strategies by recognising frequently driven journeys. Improved
traffic management to help a driver find the energy optimised route
might also make a contribution. Other options for hybridisation could
come from free piston linear generators, which produce electricity
with a constant high efficiency, at the same time avoiding part load
conditions because of the variable cylinder capacity103.

From the technologies and potentials described here, we project that
within the next 40 years an improvement of 64% in energy
consumption for hybrid vehicles is achievable, resulting in 2.6 l/100
km or 60 g CO2/km for a middle sized car in the NEDC test cycle. This
corresponds to an annual improvement of 2.2%. It is likely that other
combinations will lead to similar results, for example by following full
hybridisation first, with a potential saving of 44%104[26] and adding
complementary measures. We have also applied an 18% increase in
fuel consumption based on a realistic assessment of driving patterns.
The Volkswagen Golf V FSI 1.6 l, with a 1,360 kg mass and 163 g
CO2/km in NEDC was used as a starting point105.

large segment: For large vehicles, the same technologies as
described for the medium segment can be applied. We believe,
however, that the potential for improvements is higher and project
fuel consumption in 2050 at 3.5 lge/100 km. In addition, we assume
that political measures to reduce the sales of very large SUVs for
passenger transport have been introduced, so that the size of
vehicles within the segment will also decrease.

Battery electric vehicles already have a long history, starting in
1881 with the first electric vehicle powered by a secondary Planté
battery106. Considerable activity in the 1990s resulted in a number of
production scale electric cars such as the EV1 (GM), Saxo
electrique (Citroen), Hijet EV (Daihatsu), Th!nk City (Ford), EV
Plus (Honda), Altra EV (Nissan), Clio Electric (Renault) and the
RAV 4 (Toyota). At the beginning of the 21st century the Tesla
Roadster is among the most prominent. There is also a continuous
flow of prototype electric cars, including the Ion (Peugeot), E1
(BMW), A-Class electric (DaimlerChysler) and E-com (Toyota).

Battery electric vehicles are already very efficient. A fuel
consumption of 1.7 litres gasoline equivalent /100 km is reported
for the Ford e-Ka107, 2.1 l/100 km for the Ford Ecostar and 3.4
l/100 km for the Chrysler van108. In the future we anticipate
reference target values of 0.7 l/100 km for small size cars based on
simulations for micro cars and 1.4 l/100 km for medium size
vehicles based on simulations of city and compact class vehicles. We
do not consider battery vehicles for the large vehicle segment.

There is a considerable gap between test cycle results and real
driving experience because of auxiliary power needs, for example for
heating, cooling and other electrical services. We have therefore
applied a factor of 1.7 to the transfer from test cycle to real world
driving based on simulation results.

Battery electric vehicles carry their energy along on board in a
chemical form. The future battery technology for vehicles will most
probably be based on Lithium because of good energy densities and
cost prospects. Remaining issues associated with the application of
batteries in vehicles are safety, long term durability and costs.
However, under the most optimistic estimates for battery
development, battery electric vehicles will mainly be small vehicles
and those with dedicated usage profiles like urban fleets. Other
problems to be solved are fast recharging and cycle stability.
Technical solutions have already been proposed, and the cost
reduction target for batteries in the long term is to reach 1/40th of
today’s figures. An enormous amount of research is being carried out,
as well as production of the first vehicle-type batteries. This scenario
assumes the introduction of battery electric vehicles from 2015.

Plug-in-hybrids are a combination of conventional hybrids and
battery electric vehicles. They promise to provide both advantages:
using low carbon and cheap energy from the grid, a wide travel
range and grid independent driving when necessary. Plug-in-hybrids
can be adapted from conventional hybrids by changing to a higher
capacity battery, but different concepts, so-called series hybrids, are
also proposed. Again, depending on the control strategy, different
concepts are possible. The ICE, for example, is designed as a range-
extender to recharge the battery only or a battery plus
ICE/generator provides energy, depending on the power need. Fuel
and energy consumption depend very much on the system layout and
control strategy, combined with the distance, frequency and speed
driven. We project 2.3, 2.4, 4.5 lge/100 km following the announced
specification for the Volvo Recharge concept car and other input109.

By the year 2050 we project that plug-in hybrids will use 10% more
energy in electric mode compared to our projection for battery
electric vehicles due to their increased weight. Once the battery is
below the recharge limit, the ICE/generator will provide the energy
in part or full. In this operating mode we again project 10% higher
fuel consumption than their conventional hybrid counterparts. In
terms of CO2 balance the distribution of kilometres driven in electric
and ICE modes is crucial. We anticipate that 80% of all kilometres
will be driven in electric mode. In this scenario the introduction of
plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles starts in 2015.

fuel cell hydrogen

Fuel cell vehicles have reached a high level of readiness for mass
production. The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell provides high
power density, resulting in low weight, cost and volume . Average
drive cycle efficiencies have reached 3.5 lge/100 km111. Major
problems still to be solved are durability, operating temperature range
and cost reductions. Hydrogen on-board storage to provide a large
driving range is a further issue not finally solved. Nevertheless, the
technology seems ready to begin the transition into the mass market.

The main problem in fact is not so much the vehicles themselves as
the hydrogen they need. Before the vehicles can operate, a hydrogen
infrastructure needs to be established. The investment involved is
risky, not least because of the competing electric systems. Because
of energy losses in the hydrogen production chain, electricity appears
to be cheaper, easier to handle and more environmentally friendly –
at least until there is renewable electricity in abundance.

The hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might find its niche, however, where
the driving range of battery electric vehicles is too low and/or locally
emission free driving is demanded or the freedom from grid-
connecting is valued more highly. We have projected a 35%
improvement compared to today’s fuel cell vehicles as the target
reference value because of the potential for both fuel cell system
improvement and lightweight, rolling resistance and aerodynamic
vehicles, as already described.

projection of future vehicle technology mix

We are convinced that the share of hybrid cars will grow enormously.
For the industrialised regions, we anticipate a sales share of 65% for
hybrid power trains by 2050 and for all other regions 50%, apart
from Africa, with 25%. This share includes all types of non-grid
connected hybrids. In 2050 the balance of different hybrids will be
that in Europe, North America and OECD Pacific roughly 20% are
powered by conventional ICE engines, roughly 40% are grid-
connectable and 40% are autonomous hybrids. For all other regions,
34% will be conventional, a third plug-in-hybrids and a third
autonomous hybrids. Africa is again treated differently.

To power all sizes of vehicles with the same technology does not make
sense. We have therefore further projected that a large share of plug-
in-electric cars in the small vehicle segment (80%) will be battery
electric vehicles. Two-thirds of the medium sized vehicles and all of the
large vehicles will be plug-in-hybrids, thus still having an internal
combustion engine on board.

projection of vehicle segment split

We have disaggregated the light duty vehicle sales into three
segments: small, medium and large vehicles. This gives us the
opportunity to show the effect of ‘driving smaller cars’. The size and
CO2 emissions of the vehicles are particularly interesting in the light
of the enormous growth predicted in the LDV stock. For our
purposes we have divided up the numerous car types as follows. The
small car bracket includes city, supermini, microvans, mini SUV,
minicompact cars and two seaters. The medium sized bracket
includes lower medium/subcompact, medium class and compact
cars, car derived vans and small station wagons, upper medium
class, midsize cars and station wagons, executive class, passenger
vans (subcompact, compact and standard MPV), car derived
pickups, subcompact and compact SUVs, 2WD and 4WD. Within
the large car bracket we have included all kinds of luxury class,
luxury MPV, medium and heavy vans, compact and full-size pickup
trucks (2WD, 4WD), standard and luxury SUVs.

In examining the segment split, we have focused most strongly on
the two world regions which will be the largest emitters of CO2 from
cars in 2050: North America and China. In North America today
the small vehicle segment is almost non-existant. We have
nonetheless applied a considerable growth rate of 8% per year,
triggered by rising fuel prices and possibly vehicle taxes. For China,
we have anticipated the same share of the mature car market as for
Europe and projected that the small segment will grow by 2.3% per
year at the expenses of the larger segments in the light of rising
mass mobility. The segment split is shown in Figure 12.5.

projection of switch to alternative fuels

projection of global vehicle stock development

A switch to renewable fuels in the car fleet is one of the cornerstones
of our low CO2 car scenario, with the most prominent element the
direct use of renewable electricity in cars. The different types of
electric and hybrid cars, such as battery electric and plug-in-hybrid,
are summarised as ‘plug-in electric’. Their introduction will start in
industrialised countries in 2015, following an s-curve pattern, and are
projected to reach about 40% of total LDV sales in the EU, North
America and the Pacific OECD by 2050. Due to the higher costs of
the technology and renewable electricity availability, we have slightly
delayed progress in other countries. More cautious targets are
applied for Africa. The sales split in vehicles by fuel is presented in
Figure 12.7 for 2005 and 2050.

figure 12.6: development of the global car market

Differences in forecasts for the growth of vehicle sales in developing
countries are huge112. We have mainly used the projections from the
Reference Scenario. Slight changes were applied to vehicle sales in
saturated markets such as Europe and North America, where we believe
that massive policy intervention to promote modal shift and alternative
forms of car usage will show effects in vehicle sales in the long run.

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

projection of kilometres driven per year

summary of scenario results114

Until a complete shift from fossil to renewable fuels is completed,
driving on the road will be linked to CO2 emissions. Thus driving less
contributes to our target for emissions reduction. However this is
not necessarily linked to less mobility because we have relied on the
multitude of excellent opportunities for shifts from individual
passenger road transport towards less CO2 intense public or non-
motorised transport.

In our scenario we have taken into account the effects of a variety of
policy measures which could be implemented all over the world and
summarised them in two indicators: numbers of vehicles (see the
section above) and annual kilometres driven (AKD). For AKD we
have applied a 0.25% reduction per year, assuming the first visible
effect in 2010, resulting in a roughly 10% reduction by 2050. This
has been coordinated into a model which projects the shift from car
to rail or bus at 5%, with the additional 5% coming from LDVs as
part of the predicted demand reduction for all modes of transport113.

Figure 12.9 shows the effect of vehicle travel reduction over time by
world region. China shows a less typical pattern: while in China
today many vehicles are used intensively, with many kilometres
travelled per year, with a growing individual mobility we assume that
AKD will move towards the global average.

.

A combination of ambitious efforts to introduce higher efficiency
vehicle technologies, a major switch to grid-connected electric
vehicles and incentives for travellers to save CO2 all lead to the
conclusion that it is possible to reduce emissions from well-to-wheel
in 2050 by roughly 25%115 compared to 1990 and 40% compared
to 2005. Even so, 74% of the final energy used in cars will still come
from fossil fuel sources, 70% from gasoline and diesel. Renewable
electricity covers 19% of total car energy demand, bio fuels cover
5% and hydrogen 2%. Energy consumption in total is reduced by
23% in 2050 compared to 2005, in spite of tremendous increases in
some world regions. The peak in global CO2 emissions occurs between
2010 and 2015. From 2010 onwards, new legislation in the US and
Europe contributes towards breaking the upwards trend in emissions.
From 2020 onwards, we can see the effect of introducing grid-
connected electric cars. The development of CO2 emissions, taking
into account upstream emissions, is shown in Figure 12.8.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

At a time when governments around the world are in the process of
liberalising their electricity markets, the increasing competitiveness
of renewable energy should lead to higher demand. Without
political support, however, renewable energy remains at a
disadvantage, marginalised by distortions in the world’s electricity
markets created by decades of massive financial, political and
structural support to conventional technologies. Developing
renewables will therefore require strong political and economic
efforts, especially through laws which guarantee stable tariffs over
a period of up to 20 years.

At present new renewable energy generators have to compete with
old nuclear and fossil fuelled power stations which produce
electricity at marginal costs because consumers and taxpayers have
already paid the interest and depreciation on the original
investments. Political action is needed to overcome these distortions
and create a level playing field.

Renewable energy technologies would already be competitive if they
had received the same attention as fossil fuels and nuclear in terms
of R&D funding, subsidies, and if external costs were reflected in
energy prices. Removing public subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear
and applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle to the energy markets,
would go a long way to level the playing field and drastically reduce
the need for renewables support. Unless this principle is fully
implemented, renewable energy technologies need to receive
compensation and additional support measures in order to compete
in the distorted market.

Support mechanisms for the different sectors and technologies can
vary according to regional characteristics, priorities or starting
points. But some general principles should apply to any kind of
support mechanism. These criteria are:

effectiveness in reaching the targets The experiences in some
countries show that it is possible with the right design of a support
mechanism to reach agreed national targets. Any system to be
adopted at a national level should focus on being effective in
deploying new installed capacity and meeting the targets.

long term stability Whether price or quantity-based, policy makers
need to make sure that investors can rely on the long-term stability
of any support scheme. It is absolutely crucial to avoid stop-and-go
markets by changing the system or the level of support frequently.
Therefore market stability has to be created with a stable long-term
support mechanism.

simple and fast administrative procedures Complex licensing
procedures constitute one of the most difficult obstacles that
renewables projects have to face. Administrative barriers have to be
removed at all levels. A ‘one-stop-shop’ system should be introduced
and a clear timetable set for approving projects.

encouraging local and regional benefits and public acceptance
The development of renewable technologies can have a significant
impact on local and regional areas, resulting from both installation
and manufacturing. Some support schemes include public
involvements that hinder or facilitate the acceptance of renewable
technologies. A support scheme should encourage local/regional
development, employment and income generation. It should also
encourage public acceptance of renewables, including their positive
impact and increased stakeholder involvement.

The following is an overview of current political frameworks and
barriers that need to be overcome in order to unlock renewable
energy’s great potential to become a major contributor to global
energy supply. In the process it would also contribute to sustainable
economic growth, high quality jobs, technology development, global
competitiveness and industrial and research leadership.

renewable energy targets

In recent years, as part of their greenhouse gas reduction policies
as well as for increasing security of energy supply, an increasing
number of countries have established targets for renewable energy.
These are either expressed in terms of installed capacity or as a
percentage of energy consumption. Although these targets are not
often legally binding, they have served as an important catalyst for
increasing the share of renewable energy throughout the world,
from Europe to the Far East to the USA.

A time horizon of just a few years is not long enough in the
electricity sector, where the investment horizon can be up to 40
years. Renewable energy targets therefore need to have short,
medium and long term steps and must be legally binding in order to
be effective. They should also be supported by mechanisms such as
the ‘feed-in tariff’. In order for the proportion of renewable energy
to increase significantly, targets must be set in accordance with the
local potential for each technology (wind, solar, biomass etc) and
according to the local infrastructure, both existing and planned.

In recent years the wind and solar power industries have shown that it
is possible to maintain a growth rate of 30 to 35% in the renewables
sector. In conjunction with the European Photovoltaic Industry
Association, the European Solar Thermal Power Industry Association
and the European Wind Energy Association116, Greenpeace and EREC
have documented the development of those industries from 1990
onwards and outlined a prognosis for growth up to 2020.

demands for the energy sector

Greenpeace and the renewables industry have a clear agenda for
changes which need to be made in energy policy to encourage a
shift to renewable sources. The main demands are:

(cid:129) Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.

(cid:129) Internalise the external costs (social and environmental) of

energy production through ‘cap and trade’ emissions trading.

(cid:129) Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming

appliances, buildings and vehicles.

(cid:129) Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and

combined heat and power generation.

(cid:129) Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to

the grid for renewable power generators.

(cid:129) Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example

through feed-in tariff programmes.

(cid:129) Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to provide

more environmental product information.

(cid:129) Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy

and energy efficiency.

Conventional energy sources receive an estimated $250-300117
billion in subsidies per year worldwide, resulting in heavily distorted
markets. Subsidies artificially reduce the price of power, keep
renewable energy out of the market place and prop up non-
competitive technologies and fuels. Eliminating direct and indirect
subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power would help move us
towards a level playing field across the energy sector. The 2001
report of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force argued that “re-
addressing them [subsidies] and making even a minor re-direction
of these considerable financial flows toward renewables, provides an
opportunity to bring consistency to new public goals and to include
social and environmental costs in prices.” The Task Force
recommended that “G8 countries should take steps to remove
incentives and other supports for environmentally harmful energy
technologies, and develop and implement market-based mechanisms
that address externalities, enabling renewable energy technologies
to compete in the market on a more equal and fairer basis.”

Renewable energy would not need special provisions if markets were
not distorted by the fact that it is still virtually free for electricity
producers (as well as the energy sector as a whole) to pollute.
Subsidies to fully mature and polluting technologies are highly
unproductive. Removing subsidies from conventional electricity
would not only save taxpayers’ money. It would also dramatically
reduce the need for renewable energy support.

This is a fuller description of what needs to be done to eliminate or
compensate for current distortions in the energy market.

removal of energy market distortions A major barrier preventing
renewable energy from reaching its full potential is the lack of pricing
structures in the energy markets that reflect the full costs to society of
producing energy. For more than a century, power generation was
characterised by national monopolies with mandates to finance
investments in new production capacity through state subsidies and/or
levies on electricity bills. As many countries are moving in the
direction of more liberalised electricity markets, these options are no
longer available, which puts new generating technologies, such as wind
power, at a competitive disadvantage relative to existing technologies.
This situation requires a number of responses.

internalisation of the social and environmental costs of
polluting energy The real cost of energy production by conventional
energy includes expenses absorbed by society, such as health impacts
and local and regional environmental degradation - from mercury
pollution to acid rain – as well as the global negative impacts from
climate change. Hidden costs include the waiving of nuclear accident
insurance that is too expensive to be covered by the nuclear power
plant operators. The Price Anderson Act, for instance, limits the
liability of US nuclear power plants in the case of an accident to an
amount of up to $ 98 million per plant, and only $15 million per year
per plant, with the rest being drawn from an industry fund of up to $
10 billion. After that the taxpayer becomes responsible118.

Environmental damage should, as a priority, be rectified at source.
Translated into energy generation that would mean that, ideally,
production of energy should not pollute and it is the energy
producers’ responsibility to prevent it. If they do pollute they should
pay an amount equal to the damage the production causes to
society as a whole. The environmental impacts of electricity
generation can be difficult to quantify, however. How do we put a
price on lost homes on Pacific Islands as a result of melting icecaps
or on deteriorating health and human lives?

An ambitious project, funded by the European Commission - ExternE
– has tried to quantify the true costs, including the environmental
costs, of electricity generation. It estimates that the cost of producing
electricity from coal or oil would double and that from gas would
increase by 30% if external costs, in the form of damage to the
environment and health, were taken into account. If those
environmental costs were levied on electricity generation according to
their impact, many renewable energy sources would not need any
support. If, at the same time, direct and indirect subsidies to fossil
fuels and nuclear power were removed, the need to support renewable
electricity generation would seriously diminish or cease to exist.

introduce the “polluter pays" principle As with the other
subsidies, external costs must be factored into energy pricing if the
market is to be truly competitive. This requires that governments
apply a “polluter pays” system that charges the emitters
accordingly, or applies suitable compensation to non-emitters.
Adoption of polluter pays taxation to electricity sources, or
equivalent compensation to renewable energy sources, and exclusion
of renewables from environment-related energy taxation, is essential
to achieve fairer competition in the world’s electricity markets.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

electricity market reform Renewable energy technologies could
already be competitive if they had received the same attention as
other sources in terms of R&D funding and subsidies, and if external
costs were reflected in power prices. Essential reforms in the
electricity sector are necessary if new renewable energy technologies
are to be accepted on a larger scale. These reforms include:

removal of electricity sector barriers Complex licensing
procedures and bureaucratic hurdles constitute one of the most
difficult obstacles faced by renewable energy projects in many
countries. A clear timetable for approving projects should be set for
all administrations at all levels. Priority should be given to
renewable energy projects. Governments should propose more
detailed procedural guidelines to strengthen the existing legislation
and at the same time streamline the licensing procedure for
renewable energy projects.

A major barrier is the short to medium term surplus of electricity
generating capacity in many OECD countries. Due to over-capacity it
is still cheaper to burn more coal or gas in an existing power plant
than to build, finance and depreciate a new renewable power plant.
The effect is that, even in those situations where a new technology
would be fully competitive with new coal or gas fired power plants,
the investment will not be made. Until we reach a situation where
electricity prices start reflecting the cost of investing in new capacity
rather than the marginal cost of existing capacity, support for
renewables will still be required to level the playing field.

Other barriers include the lack of long term planning at national,
regional and local level; lack of integrated resource planning; lack
of integrated grid planning and management; lack of predictability
and stability in the markets; no legal framework for international
bodies of water; grid ownership by vertically integrated companies
and a lack of long-term R&D funding.

There is also a complete absence of grids for large scale renewable
energy sources, such as offshore wind power or concentrating solar
power (CSP) plants; weak or non-existant grids onshore; little
recognition of the economic benefits of embedded/distributed
generation; and discriminatory requirements from utilities for grid
access that do not reflect the nature of the renewable technology.

The reforms needed to address market barriers to renewables include:

(cid:129) Streamlined and uniform planning procedures and permitting

systems and integrated least cost network planning.

(cid:129) Fair access to the grid at fair, transparent prices and removal of

discriminatory access and transmission tariffs.

(cid:129) Fair and transparent pricing for power throughout a network, with

recognition and remuneration for the benefits of embedded generation.

(cid:129) Unbundling of utilities into separate generation

and distribution companies.

(cid:129) The costs of grid infrastructure development and reinforcement
must be carried by the grid management authority rather than
individual renewable energy projects.

(cid:129) Disclosure of fuel mix and environmental impact to end users to
enable consumers to make an informed choice of power source.

priority grid access Rules on grid access, transmission and cost
sharing are very often inadequate. Legislation must be clear,
especially concerning cost distribution and transmission fees.
Renewable energy generators should be guaranteed priority access.
Where necessary, grid extension or reinforcement costs should be
borne by the grid operators, and shared between all consumers,
because the environmental benefits of renewables are a public good
and system operation is a natural monopoly.

support mechanisms for renewables The following section
provides an overview of the existing support mechanisms and
experiences of their operation. Support mechanisms remain a
second best solution for correcting market failures in the electricity
sector. However, introducing them is a practical political solution to
acknowledge that, in the short term, there are no other practical
ways to apply the polluter pays principle.

Overall, there are two types of incentive to promote deployment of
renewable energy. These are Fixed Price Systems where the
government dictates the electricity price (or premium) paid to the
producer and lets the market determine the quantity, and
Renewable Quota Systems (in the USA referred to as Renewable
Portfolio Standards) where the government dictates the quantity of
renewable electricity and leaves it to the market to determine the
price. Both systems create a protected market against a
background of subsidised, depreciated conventional generators
whose external environmental costs are not accounted for. Their aim
is to provide incentives for technology improvements and cost
reductions, leading to cheaper renewables that can compete with
conventional sources in the future.

The main difference between quota based and price based systems
is that the former aims to introduce competition between electricity
producers. However, competition between technology
manufacturers, which is the most crucial factor in bringing down
electricity production costs, is present regardless of whether
government dictates prices or quantities. Prices paid to wind power
producers are currently higher in many European quota based
systems (UK, Belgium, Italy) than in fixed price or premium
systems (Germany, Spain, Denmark).

(cid:129) fixed price systems Fixed price systems include investment

subsidies, fixed feed-in tariffs, fixed premium systems and tax credits.

Investment subsidies are capital payments usually made on the
basis of the rated power (in kW) of the generator. It is generally
acknowledged, however, that systems which base the amount of
support on generator size rather than electricity output can lead
to less efficient technology development. There is therefore a
global trend away from these payments, although they can be
effective when combined with other incentives.

Fixed feed-in tariffs (FITs), widely adopted in Europe, have
proved extremely successful in expanding wind energy in
Germany, Spain and Denmark. Operators are paid a fixed price
for every kWh of electricity they feed into the grid. In Germany
the price paid varies according to the relative maturity of the
particular technology and reduces each year to reflect falling
costs. The additional cost of the system is borne by taxpayers or
electricity consumers.

The main benefit of a FIT is that it is administratively simple and
encourages better planning. Although the FIT is not associated
with a formal Power Purchase Agreement, distribution companies
are usually obliged to purchase all the production from renewable
installations. Germany has reduced the political risk of the system
being changed by guaranteeing payments for 20 years. The main
problem associated with a fixed price system is that it does not
lend itself easily to adjustment – whether up or down - to reflect
changes in the production costs of renewable technologies.

Fixed premium systems, sometimes called an “environmental
bonus” mechanism, operate by adding a fixed premium to the
basic wholesale electricity price. From an investor perspective,
the total price received per kWh is less predictable than under a
feed-in tariff because it depends on a constantly changing
electricity price. From a market perspective, however, it is argued
that a fixed premium is easier to integrate into the overall
electricity market because those involved will be reacting to
market price signals. Spain is the most prominent country to
have adopted a fixed premium system.

Tax credits, as operated in the US and Canada, offer a credit
against tax payments for every kWh produced. In the United
States the market has been driven by a federal Production Tax
Credit (PTC) of approximately 1.8 cents per kWh. It is adjusted
annually for inflation.

(cid:129) renewable quota systems Two types of renewable quota systems

have been employed - tendering systems and green certificate systems.

Tendering systems involve competitive bidding for contracts to
construct and operate a particular project, or a fixed quantity of
renewable capacity in a country or state. Although other factors
are usually taken into account, the lowest priced bid invariably
wins. This system has been used to promote wind power in
Ireland, France, the UK, Denmark and China.

The downside is that investors can bid an uneconomically low
price in order to win the contract, and then not build the project.
Under the UK’s NFFO (Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation) tender
system, for example, many contracts remained unused. It was
eventually abandoned. If properly designed, however, with long
contracts, a clear link to planning consent and a possible minimum
price, tendering for large scale projects could be effective, as it has
been for offshore oil and gas extraction in Europe’s North Sea.

Tradable green certificate (TGC) systems operate by offering
“green certificates” for every kWh generated by a renewable
producer. The value of these certificates, which can be traded on a
market, is then added to the value of the basic electricity. A green
certificate system usually operates in combination with a rising
quota of renewable electricity generation. Power companies are
bound by law to purchase an increasing proportion of renewables
input. Countries which have adopted this system include the UK,
Sweden and Italy in Europe and many individual states in the
US, where it is known as a Renewable Portfolio Standard.

Compared with a fixed tender price, the TGC model is more risky
for the investor, because the price fluctuates on a daily basis,
unless effective markets for long-term certificate (and electricity)
contracts are developed. Such markets do not currently exist. The
system is also more complex than other payment mechanisms.

Which one out of this range of incentive systems works best?
Based on past experience it is clear that policies based on fixed
tariffs and premiums can be designed to work effectively.
However, introducing them is not a guarantee for success. Almost
all countries with experience in mechanisms to support
renewables have, at some point in time, used feed-in tariffs, but
not all have contributed to an increase in renewable electricity
production. It is the design of a mechanism, in combination with
other measures, which determines its success.

renewables for heating and cooling Largely forgotten, but
equally important, is the heating and cooling sector. In many
regions of the world, such as Europe, nearly half of the total energy
demand is for heating/cooling, a demand which can be addressed
easily at competitive prices.

Policies should make sure that specific targets and appropriate
measures for renewable heating and cooling are part of any
national renewables strategy. These should foresee a coherent set of
measures dedicated to the promotion of renewables for heating and
cooling, including financial incentives, awareness raising campaigns,
training of installers, architects and heating engineers, and
demonstration projects. For new buildings, and those undergoing
major renovation, an obligation to cover a minimum share of heat
consumption by renewables should be introduced, as already
implemented in some countries and regions.

Measures should stimulate the deployment of the large potential
for cost effective renewable heating and cooling, available already
with today’s technologies. At the same time, increased R&D efforts
should be undertaken, particularly in the fields of heat storage and
renewable cooling.

Greenpeace is a global organisation that uses non-violent direct
action to tackle the most crucial threats to our planet’s biodiversity
and environment. Greenpeace is a non-profit organisation, present in
40 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.
It speaks for 2.8 million supporters worldwide, and inspires many
millions more to take action every day. To maintain its
independence, Greenpeace does not accept donations from
governments or corporations but relies on contributions from
individual supporters and foundation grants.

Greenpeace has been campaigning against environmental
degradation since 1971 when a small boat of volunteers and
journalists sailed into Amchitka, an area west of Alaska, where the
US Government was conducting underground nuclear tests. This
tradition of ‘bearing witness’ in a non-violent manner continues
today, and ships are an important part of all its campaign work.
