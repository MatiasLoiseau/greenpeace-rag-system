Nuclear power:
a dangerous waste of time

The unresolved legacy of nuclear power:
radioactive materials – a continuing threat

Introduction

The nuclear power industry is attempting to exploit the climate crisis
by aggressively promoting nuclear technology as a “low-carbon”
means of generating electricity. Nuclear power claims to be safe,
cost-effective and able meet the world’s energy needs. But nothing
could be further from the truth.

In fact, nuclear power undermines the real solutions to climate
change by diverting urgently needed investments away from clean,
renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency. As this briefing
outlines, nuclear power is expensive, dangerous and a threat to
global security. And, when it comes to combating climate change,
it cannot deliver the necessary reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions in time; any emissions reductions from nuclear power will
be too little, too late and come at far too high a price.

This briefing outlines why nuclear power is a woefully inadequate
response to the climate crisis and how, in contrast, renewable energy
and greater energy efficiency can deliver in time to tackle climate
change, without any of the dangers posed by nuclear power. It also
explores the key environmental, health and security issues affecting
every stage of the nuclear process: the unsolved problem of
radioactive waste; the risk of catastrophic accidents; and the
dangers posed to global security. As a typical example, the briefing
highlights fundamental problems with the very latest generation of
nuclear plants known as the “European Pressurised Reactor”.

In defiance of logic, nuclear power has benefited for over half a
century from massive financial support in the form of taxpayers’
money. Yet it is barely possible to conceive of a more complex and
risky way of heating water to produce steam and generate power. It
is now time to give priority to simpler, cheaper and more reliable ways
of meeting consumer demands for electricity.

When atoms are split, a lot of energy is released. Put simply, this is
what nuclear energy is. It sounds innocent enough, but nuclear
processes produce dangerous radioactive materials. These materials
emit radiation that can be very harmful for people and the
environment, not only now but also for hundreds of thousands of
years to come. Exposure to radioactivity has been linked to genetic
mutations, birth defects, cancer, leukaemia and disorders of the
reproductive, immune, cardiovascular and endocrine systems.

Commercial nuclear reactors use uranium as fuel. Even before
it is ready to be used as fuel, a series of processing steps causes
serious environmental contamination (see figure 1). When a uranium
atom is split, it produces not only energy but also highly dangerous
radioactive waste.

On average, uranium ore contains only 0.1% uranium. The
overwhelming majority of the materials extracted during uranium
ore mining is waste containing other hazardous radioactive and toxic
substances. Most nuclear reactors require one specific form of
uranium, uranium-235 (U-235). This form represents only 0.7% of
natural uranium. To increase the concentration of U-235, the uranium
extracted from ore goes through an enrichment process, resulting in
a small quantity of usable ‘enriched’ uranium and huge volumes of
waste: depleted uranium, a toxic radioactive heavy metal (see Box 1).
Enriched uranium is then put into fuel rods and transported to
nuclear reactors where electricity is generated. Nuclear power plant
operation transforms uranium fuel into a rich, highly-toxic and
dangerous cocktail of radioactive elements, such as plutonium.
Plutonium is the manmade element used in nuclear bombs, lethal
in minute quantities and dangerous for about 240,000 years.

In contrast to nuclear power, renewable energy is both clean
and safe. Technically-accessible renewable energy sources
are capable of producing six times more energy than current
global demand.

Box 1: Depleted Uranium (DU) – a dangerous by-product
of nuclear power

Depleted Uranium (DU) is a by-product of uranium
enrichment. Currently a worldwide stock of more than 1.2
million tonnes is stored without any foreseen future use.
Britain and the United States used it to provide armour for
tanks and piercing tips for munitions in the Gulf War.

Despite contravening health physics guidelines, the British and
American governments waited years before starting to screen
soldiers following their exposure to DU. In 2004, Gulf War veteran
Kenny Duncan won a landmark court case against
the British government. After years of repeatedly denying that
Duncan’s ill-health was the result of exposure to DU, the
government was forced to recognise the impacts DU had actually
had on his health and award him a war pension. Duncan’s three
children, born after his exposure to DU, suffered health problems
similar to those experienced by many Iraqi children. These
included immune system suppression and deformed toes.1 DU
continues to be used in arms despite there being no full
understanding of its impact on human health and the
environment.2

Hazardous for hundreds
of thousands of years

Nuclear waste is categorised according to both its level of
radioactivity and how long it remains hazardous. The International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) estimates that, every year, the nuclear
energy industry produces the equivalent of about 1 million barrels
(200,000m3) of what it considers ‘Low and Intermediate-Level Waste’
(LILW) and about 50,000 barrels (10,000m3) of the even more
dangerous ‘High-Level Waste’ (HLW).3 These numbers do not even
include spent nuclear fuel, which is a high-level waste too.

Low and Intermediate-Level Waste includes parts of dismantled
nuclear power plants (concrete, metals), but also disposable
protective clothing, plastics, paper, metals, filters and resins.
Low-level and intermediate waste remains radioactive for periods
ranging from minutes to thousands of years and needs to be
maintained under controlled conditions for these durations. Even so,
large volumes of radioactive waste are discharged in the air
and the sea every day.

Extremely dangerous High-Level Waste includes materials
containing highly-radioactive elements. High-level waste can be
radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years and emits large
amounts of hazardous radiation. Even a couple of minutes of
exposure to high-level waste can easily result in fatal doses of
radiation. It therefore needs to be reliably stored for hundreds of
thousands of years. Putting this into perspective, humankind has
been on Earth for the last 200,000 years, yet it takes 240,000 years
for plutonium to be considered safe (figure 2).

The safe and secure storage of the dangerous waste needs to be
guaranteed throughout this period, which potentially spans many Ice
Ages. It’s no wonder that a solution for dealing with nuclear waste
has still not been found.

Plutonium is one of the highly radioactive elements in nuclear waste. Used to make nuclear
bombs it is also a security risk. It takes 240,000 years to become safe.

No solution to radioactive waste

“Reprocessing” creates even more hazardous waste

Burying the problem?

Some spent nuclear fuel is reprocessed, which means that
plutonium and unused uranium are separated out from other waste,
with the intention to reuse it in nuclear power plants. A limited
number of countries – France, Russia and the UK – conduct
reprocessing on a commercial scale. Consequently, dangerous
nuclear waste and separated plutonium are repeatedly transported
across oceans and borders and through towns and cities.

However, the term “reprocessing” is misleading. The process actually
leads to more hazardous waste flows. Only part of the radioactive
material is recovered and further processed as nuclear fuel; the rest
results in large volumes of various types of radioactive waste that is
often difficult to store. Nuclear reprocessing plants discharge large
volumes of radioactive waste on a daily basis with serious
environmental impacts. A study published in 2001 showed an
increased incidence of leukaemia among under-25 year olds living
within 10 kilometres of La Hague nuclear reprocessing plant, in
northwest France.4 According to a 1997 study in the UK, there was
twice as much plutonium in the teeth of young people living close to
the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant than in the teeth of those
living further away.5

Reprocessing of nuclear waste endangers our health and does not
decrease the radioactive waste problem. It has been estimated that,
over the next 40 years, the radioactive discharges of the Rokkasho
reprocessing plant, to be started in Japan, will be very large relative
to other nuclear operations and will lead to exposure of members of
the public to radiation equivalent to half of that released during the
Chernobyl catastrophe.6 (See Accidents page 6)

The nuclear industry wants to bury the problem of radioactive
waste by storing it in deep geological repositories. However, not
a single one has yet been built. It appears to be impossible to
find suitable locations where safety can be guaranteed for the
timescales necessary.

Construction of the Yucca Mountain waste site in Nevada, in the
United States, began in 1982, but the date for start of operation has
been postponed from 1992 to beyond 2020. The US Geological
Survey has found a fault line under the planned site7 and there are
serious doubts about the long-term future movements of
underground water that can transport deadly contamination into the
environment. Proposals for an underground dump in Finland suffer
from similar concerns (see Case Study, page 11).

Given the immense difficulties and risks associated with the storage
of dangerous nuclear waste, it’s not surprising that the nuclear
industry tries to dump it out of sight. One such example is Russia –
during the Soviet era, nuclear facilities were built in closed cities (in,
for example, the Urals and Siberia), resulting in a history of nuclear
disasters, environmental contamination and public health scandals,
all of which were kept secret by the Soviet government. One of these
cities, Mayak, may now be the most radioactively contaminated
place on Earth. Despite its appalling record of managing nuclear
waste, Russia wants to import foreign nuclear waste for storage
and/or reprocessing at Mayak, as well as other sites.

Despite the billions already invested in research and development
for dealing with radioactive waste, new experiments are still being
presented as ‘solutions’; methods that will not be ready for a long
time, may never be commercially viable or do little to solve the long
term waste problem.

Measures to improve energy efficiency are available now.
According to Amory Lovins of the US-based Rocky Mountain
Institute, “Each dollar invested in electric efficiency displaces
nearly seven times as much carbon dioxide as a dollar invested
in nuclear power, without any nasty side effects” 8

Accidents:
A complex and uncontainable risk

On 26 April 1986, an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the
Ukraine caused a meltdown in the reactor, resulting in the release of
more radioactivity than that spread when the atom bombs were
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Chernobyl is marked in history
as the world’s worst civilian nuclear disaster. During the disaster, 56
people died and about 600,000 people were exposed to significant
levels of radiation. Radioactive contamination spread to places as far
away as Lapland and Scotland9 (figure 3). Hundreds of thousands of
people in contaminated regions had to abandon their homes.

Figure 3: Deposits of radioactive caesium-137 from Chernobyl
fallout. The contamination will impact several generations.
Higher levels impacted areas as far apart as Scandinavia, UK,
Alps or Greece.

Radioactive pollution has long-term impacts on health. The precise
death toll from Chernobyl will never be known but it may exceed
90,000 people.10 As former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan was
reported as saying on the twentieth anniversary of the accident,
“seven million people are still suffering, everyday”. Three million
children require treatment and many will die prematurely.11 (See Box 2)

The nuclear industry argues that the Chernobyl catastrophe was only
the result of old technology and mismanagement within the old
Soviet bloc. Yet nuclear accidents and “near misses”, in which the
fuel rods at the core of a reactor come close to melting down,
continue to occur in nuclear plants around the world. Since
Chernobyl, there have been nearly 200 “near misses” in the US
alone, according to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).12
Another example involved a serious technical failure in the Forsmark
nuclear power plant in Sweden, in 2006, which forced four of the
country’s six reactors to shut down. A former director of the plant
said, “It was pure luck that there was not a meltdown…it could have
been a catastrophe.”13 Also in 2006, one-third of the control rods in a
pressurised water reactor at the Kozloduy plant, in Bulgaria, failed to
operate during an emergency shutdown.

Plutonium is one of the highly radioactive elements in nuclear waste. Used to make nuclear

bombs it is also a security risk. It takes 240,000 years to become safe.

In 1999, workers failed to follow guidelines at the Tokaimura nuclear
fuel plant in Japan, leading to an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction.
Two workers received lethal doses of radiation, and the
neighbourhood had to be evacuated. The IAEA concluded that
serious breaches of safety principles were the cause of the
accident.14 Operational shortcuts had been taken to make the
process quicker and cheaper.15

Even if technology never failed and human operators never made
errors, natural disasters still present significant risks. In 2003 the
French nuclear safety agency activated its emergency response
centre following torrential rainfall along the lower Rhone River, which
threatened to flood two nuclear reactors at the Cruas-Meysse
power plant.16

In 2007, an earthquake in Japan caused a fire at the Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa nuclear power plant. The earthquake caused its seven
reactors to shut down, releasing cobalt-60 and chromium-51 into
the atmosphere from an exhaust stack and leading to 1,200 litres of
contaminated water leaking into the sea.17 A year later all seven
reactors were still inoperable.

Nuclear power gambles with our lives, health and environment,
while a sustainable energy future without these risks is at hand.
Greenpeace and the European Renewable Energy Council
(EREC) commissioned the DLR Institute (German Aerospace
Centre) to develop a global sustainable energy pathway to 2050.
The resulting “Energy [R]evolution” blueprint18 shows that if,
intelligent policy and infrastructure choices are made now,
renewable energy and energy efficiency could provide half of
global energy requirements by 2050 and reduce use of fossil fuels
to 30%. The scenario clearly shows that the necessary reduction
in CO2 emissions can be obtained without nuclear power.

Box 2: Chernobyl – Annya’s Story: Certificate no. 000358

At just four years old, Annya Pesenko would often pass out and
fall flat on the table when she was trying to sit up straight and
eat her food. Her mother, Valentina, took her to the doctor. He
discovered a tumour in her head. The cancer was removed, but
Annya never regained her health. She has seen so many
doctors that just the sight of a white coat terrifies her. The tumour
returned when she was nine. Annya has been in and out of
hospital ever since.

Annya’s father, Vyacheslav, was from a village highly
contaminated by the Chernobyl meltdown. At night Valentina and
Vyacheslav sleep on the floor next to their daughter’s bed. Annya
has to be turned every fifteen minutes to prevent bed sores.
Nobody gets much sleep. Vyacheslav has to leave first thing in
the morning for his chauffeuring job and Valentina drinks coffee
all day to stay awake.

Annya wasn’t even born when the Chernobyl accident
happened. She has been given a “Chernobyl Certificate” by a
committee of doctors who offer Chernobyl victims access to
certain healthcare. Certificate no. 000358.

A threat to global security

Nuclear power evolved from the atomic bomb, and the two have
remained connected ever since. One of the most fundamental and
insoluble problems of nuclear power is that the enriched uranium it
burns, and the plutonium it produces, can be used to construct
nuclear weapons. Other radioactive products formed in nuclear
reactors can be used to produce dirty bombs.

A typical nuclear power plant produces sufficient plutonium every
year for 10-15 crude nuclear bombs.19 Former UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan warned, in 2005, that using such nuclear bombs “would
not only cause widespread death and destruction, but would
stagger the world economy and thrust tens of millions of people
into dire poverty.” 20

Experiments by the US government have shown that several nuclear
weapons can be built in a matter of weeks using ordinary spent fuel
from light water reactors (the most common type of reactors). One
study revealed that a country with only a minimal industrial base
could quickly and secretly build a small plant, just 40 metres long,
capable of extracting about a bomb’s worth of plutonium every day.21

This relationship between bombs and electricity generation is
reinforced by the dual roles of the  IAEA in both policing nuclear
technology to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and promoting
nuclear power. Dominique Voynet, French Senator and former
Minister for the Environment, points out: “The IAEA acts as a true
promoter for the nuclear industry worldwide. By deliberately ignoring
the interlink between civil and military nukes, it contributes to the
proliferation of fissile materials.”22 We do not need to look far for
examples of how this approach has failed to stop the spread of
nuclear weapons. China, India, Iraq, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan
and South Africa have all used their nuclear power industry to
covertly develop nuclear weapons programs.

Forty other countries, currently without nuclear weapons programmes
but which have experimented with or developed nuclear power, have
access to the nuclear materials and technology needed to make a
nuclear bomb.23

Vulnerable to terrorists

Despite extensive treaties and political efforts, effectively
safeguarding nuclear materials and technology against terrorist
threats remains an impossible task. Mohamed El Baradei, head of
the IAEA and the man responsible for the safeguards and security
regime, admitted in 2005 that, “Export controls have failed, allowing
a black market for nuclear material to develop, a market that is also
available to terrorist groups.”24

Nuclear facilities, as well as the radioactive waste transports that
regularly cross countries, are also potential targets for terrorists. For
example, reactors have not been built to withstand the impact of a
large aircraft; nuclear waste transports are even more vulnerable. A
study, written by nuclear expert John Large, evaluated scenarios
involving terrorist attacks on, or the crash of, a plutonium shipment
from France’s La Hague reprocessing plant to the Marcoule reactor.
The report estimates that 11,000 people would die from the effects
of radiation exposure.25 A similar study by Dr. Edwin Lyman of the
Union of Concerned Scientists finds that a potential terrorist attack
on the Indian Point nuclear plant in the US could lead to 518,000
long-term deaths from cancer and as many as 44,000 near-term
deaths from acute radiation poisoning.26

Nuclear power increases the risk of nuclear weapons capabilities
spreading to other countries, of terrorists gaining material to
make nuclear bombs and of potential terrorist attacks on nuclear
facilities or transports. Renewable energy carries none of these
safety or proliferation concerns. It does not require complex
safeguards, international bodies, or treaties to police its trade and
use. Renewable energy technologies and skills can be easily and
safely exported around the world.

With a fairer legal and political framework, green electricity can
keep the lights on with cleaner, safer, cheaper electricity.
Germany’s renewable energy industry and the wind industry in
Texas are two successful examples that have led to market
competitiveness without additional subsidies.

Global investment in renewable energy has already doubled in the
past three years and there is a corresponding downward trend in
cost that makes renewable energy a comparatively cheaper
long-term investment.

Renewable energy is the cheaper option. To produce double the
current amount of nuclear energy would require building 500
Gigawatts (GW) of new capacity taking into account retiring
nuclear power plants This could cost USD 4,000 billion 29.
Generating the same amount of electricity (5,200 TWh per year)
from renewable sources would require construction of 1,750 GW
at the investment of USD 2,500 billion assuming their current
costs.30 This means that nuclear power is 50% more expensive
than renewable to build, plus additional costs related to fuel and
waste disposal would be avoided

Nuclear power is expensive

Nuclear power is often described as “the most expensive way to boil
water.” Despite its proponents now claiming it to be cost-effective,
cost estimates for proposed projects have consistently proved
inaccurate. A look at current and past experiences of the anticipated
and real costs of nuclear projects reveals an industry in which
overspends are prevalent and which is propped up by subsidies.27
The ratings agency, Moody’s, has made it abundantly clear that,
even with massive government subsidy, nuclear power is not a
sound investment.28

The cost of building a nuclear reactor is consistently two to three
times higher than the nuclear industry estimates. In India, the country
with the most recent experience of nuclear reactor construction,
completion costs for the last 10 reactors have, on average, been
300% over budget. In Finland, the construction of a new reactor
is already €1.5 billion over budget (see Case Study, page 11).

Over the years, billions of dollars worth of taxpayers’ money has
been poured into nuclear energy, compared to trifling sums that have
gone towards promoting clean, renewable energy technologies. In
the case of the US, where not one new reactor has been ordered in
30 years, the government tries to tempt private investors with tax
credits, federal loan guarantees and contributions to risk insurance.

Nuclear reactors present too large a liability for insurance companies
to accept. One major accident, costing hundreds of billions of euros
(the total Chernobyl cost is estimated at €358 billion) would bankrupt
them. Governments, and ultimately their taxpayers, are forced to
shoulder this financial liability. The cost of clean-up after
a nuclear power plant closes and the safe management of nuclear
waste for many generations are also largely carried by the states
instead of the companies themselves.

Greenpeace International Nuclear power: a dangerous waste of time 9
Greenpeace International Nuclear Power: a dangerous waste of time

The Energy Scenario produced by the International Energy Agency
shows that, even if existing world nuclear power capacity could be
quadrupled by 2050, its share of world energy consumption would
still be below 10%. This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
less than 4%.31

Implementation of this scenario would require that one new reactor
to be built every 10 days from now until 2050. Investment costs
for 1,400 new reactors needed would exceed USD 10 trillion at
current prices.32

Nuclear power cannot meet concerns about energy security either.
The 439 commercial nuclear reactors33 in operation generate around
15% of the world’s electricity. This is just 6.5% of the world’s total
energy supply. Nuclear power only generates electricity. Any
contribution to hot water and central heating supply would be
marginal, and it does not meet our transport needs at all, as
Figure 4 shows.34

Nuclear power plants depend on uranium for fuel, an ore found in
only a handful of countries. 88% of world production in 2005 was
supplied from Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Niger, Namibia, Russia
and Uzbekistan. Pursuing the so-called “nuclear option” therefore
means dependence on a limited source of supply, not contributing to
a country’s energy independence.

Renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency measures
are available now and forever. Construction time for installing a
large wind turbine has fallen to only two weeks, with an
associated planning period of between one and two years.
Harnessing domestic natural resources, a decentralised mix
renewable energy and energy efficiency could really provide for
more CO2 reduction and energy security without the hazards of
nuclear power.

A risk for climate change
and energy security

Though some people talk of a ‘nuclear renaissance’ it exists only on
paper. Pretentious words and high expectations are not matched
by orders for new reactors or by interest from the investment
community. Only at nuclear power’s peak in 1985 and 1986, the
equivalent of 30 new reactors (30 GW) of additional capacity was
built per year. In the last decade the average construction rate was
just four new reactors (4 GW) per year.

The declining nuclear industry is attempting to latch on to the climate
crisis and concerns about energy security, by promoting itself as a
“low carbon” solution. Today’s world is hooked on coal, oil and gas.
Burning these fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, the main cause of
global warming and climate change. Furthermore, oil and gas are
finite and concentrated in a limited number of locations around the
world, often in unstable regions. This concerns policy makers keen to
ensure sufficient and secure supplies of energy for the future.

But, for the simplest of reasons, nuclear energy cannot be a part of
a solution: Nuclear power can only deliver too little, too late.

As nuclear power can only provide electricity, it cannot meet our transport
or heating energy needs.

Avoiding the worst impacts of the climate change means that global
greenhouse gas emissions need to peak by 2015 and be cut by at
least half by 2050, compared to their 1990 levels. This calls for
fundamental changes in the way we generate and use electricity.

Even in countries with established nuclear programmes, planning,
licensing and connecting a new reactor to the electricity grid typically

Case Study: The Finnish reactor – the nuclear industry’s brave new world

The European Pressurised Water Reactor (EPR) is supposed to
be the flagship of the so-called “nuclear renaissance”. Presented
by its French supplier Areva, as significantly safer, more reliable,
cheaper and faster to build than previous reactor designs, the
first experience of construction, at the Olkiluoto-3 (OL3) reactor,
in Finland, is proving a disaster.

Safety:

In August 2008, three years into the project, the Finnish nuclear
safety authority, STUK, had reported 2,100 quality and safety
defects.35 Many of these safety failures can increase the risk of a
severe accident.36 In August 2008, STUK had to further admit
that the safety culture in OL3 had not met the standards and
need to improve.37

Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said in 2008, “I don’t see
that (more) nuclear plants can be a global answer,” adding
that reducing energy consumption, especially from cars, would
do more to fight climate change.43

Blocking the real solutions to climate change:

OL3 has had a disastrous impact on Finland’s renewable energy
industry. Prior to the decision to build the new reactor, the
Finnish renewable energy industry was thriving. Today, the
renewable market has stagnated as 85% of planned investments
in new power generation between 2006 and 2010 have been
eaten up by OL3.44 Leading international business advisors,
Ernst & Young have ranked Finland as the third least-attractive
among 25 countries for investments in renewable energy.45

Cost Overruns and Construction delays:

No solution for waste

With expected construction delays of three years, the reactor is
at least €1.5 billion (USD 2.34 billion) over budget.38 Yet, the
Finnish public were bullied into accepting OL3 because the
government told them it would cost € 0.5 billion more than the
originally budgeted cost of the reactor to invest in alternative
energy sources.

A company called Posiva studies the possibility of burying
highly radioactive nuclear waste permanently underground.
No permission to build a nuclear waste storage site has been
granted and at least five years of more research is needed before
the company is even ready to apply for a permit. There are some
serious concerns about this project:

More expensive electricity:

Elfi, the Finnish consortium of large electricity users, calculates
that this will lead to €3 billion of indirect costs to electricity
consumers39 – around €600 extra per person.

Reliance on taxpayers’ money:

OL3 was promised to be a “market-financed private
investment”.40 But most investment is coming from the
government. 60% of direct investment in OL3 comes from
companies controlled by the Finnish State and its
municipalities.41 The involvement of French and German public
banks means that taxpayers in these countries may also
shoulder some of the costs.

Failing on climate change:

A scenario42 of carbon dioxide emission reductions,
commissioned by the Finnish energy industry, shows emission
reductions due to OL3 to be only one-third of the forecasts that
were provided to the government in 2002. What’s more, the
three year delay in construction means that the reactor will
not contribute to Finland’s Kyoto Protocol emissions reduction
target at all.

  •  All research is conducted by the waste disposal company itself

without independent review.

  •  Once the storage site is full and closed there are no plans
or money set aside for monitoring the site or dealing with
any leakages.

  •  The bedrock in the studied site is full of cracks and less

stable then originally believed. The site has been chosen for
political rather than geological reasons – people living locally
are less likely to oppose it.

  •  Recent research published in Science magazine shows that

copper canisters could be corroded in a century.

Conclusion

The OL3 debacle shows that nuclear power remains expensive,
unsafe and undermines true solutions to climate change. The
second construction site for a EPR, in Flamanville, northern
France, follows a similar course to OL3. It should serve as a stark
warning to governments considering investing in nuclear power.

  The IEA on the other hand considers heat the primary energy source and then assumes 33%
  efficiency. Consequently, the value in primary energy of a kWh of nuclear power produced today
  according to IIASA’s methodology is roughly one third of that of the same kWh according to the IEA
  methodology.
