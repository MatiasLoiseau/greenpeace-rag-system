Nuclear power
undermining action on climate change

Introduction

“The question is not whether climate change is happening or not but whether,
in the face of this emergency, we ourselves can change fast enough.”

Koﬁ Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, November 20061

There is a clear scientiﬁc consensus that we must halve global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
by 2050 or suffer changes to the global climate with catastrophic consequences. Avoiding the
most severe impacts of climate change requires governments, individuals and businesses
world-wide to take immediate action.

Some US $7 trillion are projected to be invested in new electricity generation capacity
between now and 2030.2 The energy investment decisions taken today will determine whether
or not the world achieves the necessary CO2 emission cuts in time.

The nuclear industry, which has been in decline in the US and Europe, has seized upon the climate
crisis as a revival opportunity, claiming to offer a carbon-free contribution to our future energy mix.

Nuclear power is an expensive and dangerous distraction from the real solutions to climate
change. Greenhouse gas reduction targets can only be met through using the proven
alternatives of renewable energy technologies and energy efﬁciency. Every dollar spent on
nuclear power is a dollar stolen from the real solutions to climate change.

Nuclear power
undermining action on climate change

Too little and too late

Nuclear an expensive distraction

Nuclear power could at best make only a negligible contribution to
CO2 reduction; even then many years after massive cuts are needed
and only by depriving real climate solutions of funding.

Currently 439 commercial nuclear reactors3 supply around 15 percent
of global electricity, providing only 6.5 per cent of overall energy
consumption.4 Even if today’s current installed nuclear capacity was
doubled it would lead to reductions in global greenhouse gas
emissions of less than ﬁve percent and would require one new large
reactor to come online every two weeks until 2030. An impossible
task: even in countries with established nuclear programmes,
planning, licensing and connecting a new reactor to the grid typically
takes more than a decade. Worldwide, plans for more than 200 new
reactors have been announced; even under the most optimistic
conditions, only a small fraction of these would be able to generate
electricity before 2020.5

In stark contrast, proven renewable energy technologies are available
now, can be constructed and brought on-line quickly and provide
immediate cuts in greenhouse gases. For example, construction time
for installing a large wind turbine has fallen to only two weeks, with an
associated planning period of between one and two years.

Figure 1 Construction time of nuclear power plants worldwide

Investment in nuclear power stations is highly capital intensive and
risky. Current forecast ﬁgures and construction schedules being
provided by the nuclear industry to investors and governments are
not supported by historical or even current experience. In India, for
example, completion costs for the last 10 reactors have been on
average three times over budget. The Olkiluoto 3 reactor under
construction in Finland is already over budget (see Case Study).

Alternatively, The Energy [R]evolution Scenario, commissioned by
Greenpeace and the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC)
(see page 6 for more information) outlines a sustainable energy
pathway, phasing out nuclear power and fossil fuels, that would
produce an average annual fuel cost savings 10 times greater than
the additional investment cost required for the necessary renewable
energy technologies and energy efﬁciency measures.

There is an investment choice to be made. The investment required to
double global nuclear capacity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions
by less than 5 percent – would be between two and three trillion
US dollars.6 And as Amory Lovins from the US Rocky Mountain
Institute calculates:

“Each dollar invested in electric efﬁciency displaces nearly seven
times as much carbon dioxide as a dollar invested in nuclear power,
without any nasty side effects.”7

Case Study: Olkiluoto 3 (OL3), the European Pressurised
Water Reactor in Finland

The ﬂagship of the so-called “nuclear renaissance”, the European
Pressurised Water Reactor (EPR), being built in Finland, clearly illustrates
the fallacy of using nuclear power to meet the climate challenge.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned against the risk of relying
on the new reactor for emission cuts, saying in 2004 that any delays
would inhibit Finland’s ability to meet its greenhouse gas reduction
targets under the Kyoto Protocol.9 That risk has become a reality.

In August 2007, after 27 months of construction, the project was
ofﬁcially declared to be between 24 and 30 months behind schedule
and at least EUR 1,500 million (US $2,230 million) over budget.
Unlikely to be operational before 2011, OL3 will not be ready in time
to contribute to Finland’s Kyoto target.

According to former Finnish environment minister, Satu Hassi MEP,
once the decision was made to build OL3, the country lost interest in
renewable energy sources.10

The decision on OL3 was made at a time when new renewables,
especially wind, had come of age and signiﬁcant growth was
projected. Projected ﬁgures have not been realised, largely because
the power market is blocked by OL3, which represents 85% of the
country’s planned investments in new power generation between
2006 and 201010 (See Figure 2). Similarly, we can see in Figure 3 that
the commissioning of four nuclear reactors in 1977-1980 led to a
standstill in the development of combined heat and power. And the
decision for OL3 is already having the same impact.

Contrary to promises that the EPR would be signiﬁcantly safer, more
reliable, cheaper and faster to build than earlier reactors, the project is
late, over budget and has failed meet mandatory Finnish quality and
safety standards. Problems have been reported with the concrete
base slab, the reactor vessel, the pressuriser, and the primary cooling
piping as well as with the steel liner of the reactor. All of which could
have signiﬁcant consequences in the case of an accident.12 As of May
2007, the nuclear safety authority STUK had reported 1,500 quality
and safety defects with the EPR project.

The Finnish lesson is clear. Nuclear power can not deliver CO2
reductions in time, it undermines investment in clean renewable energy
and energy efﬁciency and poses unacceptable health and safety risks.

Nuclear power expansion would seriously undermine global
security by signiﬁcantly increasing opportunities for nuclear
proliferation and terrorism

One tonne of spent nuclear fuel typically contains about 10 kilograms
of plutonium – enough for a crude nuclear bomb. Experiments by the
US government have proven that several nuclear weapons can be
built in a matter of weeks using ordinary spent fuel from light water
reactors. One study showed that a country with a minimal industrial
base could quickly and secretly build a small reprocessing facility,
called a ‘quick and dirty’ plant, capable of extracting about a bomb’s
worth of plutonium per day from spent reactor fuel. The facility would
be no longer than 40 metres and could start operation six months
from start of construction.21

The list of non-nuclear countries that have recently announced plans
to gain access to nuclear technology and build nuclear reactors is
long and disturbing.22 Despite extensive efforts, treaties and political
mechanisms designed to safeguard nuclear materials and technology,
it remains an impossible task. Mohamed El Baradei, head of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, responsible for the international
safeguards and security regime said in 2005:

“Export controls have failed, allowing a black market for nuclear material
to develop, a market that is also available to terrorist groups”.23

Civilian reactors and nuclear waste transports add another frightening
dimension to the nuclear threat as they are attractive targets for
terrorist groups.

A health, safety and security hazard

To propose nuclear expansion in the name of climate change is
effectively adding one uncertain, potentially catastrophic health,
environmental and security threat to another. Nuclear power poses an
unacceptable health, safety and security risk. In fact, as climate change
impacts increase, so too do the safety risks associated with nuclear
power. For example, because nuclear power requires large amounts of
water for cooling, more frequent droughts in a climate changed world
will mean less water available to cool the reactor, leading to lower
reliability and outages as nuclear plants will be forced into shut-down.

Nuclear power expansion increases the risk of an accident

Accidents happen at nuclear sites all the time. The Chernobyl
accident, the worst to date, contaminated an area larger than 120,000
square kilometres and contamination was found as far away as
Lapland and Scotland. The precise death toll will never be known, but
may be more than one hundred thousand.19 Chernobyl’s economic
impacts are estimated to be in the order of hundreds of billions US
dollars. An accident in a much larger and more complex reactor, like
the EPR, could have even more devastating consequences.20

Nuclear power expansion would increase the volume and
unresolved risks of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste
far into the distant future

There is no safe solution to dealing with the dangerous radioactive
waste produced by nuclear power, in spite of billions of dollars of
investment and decades of research. An average nuclear reactor
produces 20-30 tonnes of highly radioactive spent fuel each year,
which remains radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years.

Box 1 Nuclear power and the developing world15

Developing countries were clear in their rejection of nuclear power as part of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM - a mechanism
under the Kyoto protocol that allows industrialised countries to invest in CO2 emission reduction projects in developing countries as a
contribution towards their own domestic CO2 emission reduction targets).16

Nuclear power plants are too large and electricity grids incompatible – Developing countries do not have the high-voltage grids
required for large-capacity power stations. Such transmission networks are expensive and of little use in sparsely populated countries.
In densely populated countries with emerging economies, long construction lead times mean nuclear power could not keep pace with
increasing demand. A diverse and decentralised mix of renewable energy is a much more effective and cleaner means to meet different
energy needs quickly.

Nuclear power increases national debt – Nuclear power stations built in developing countries add signiﬁcant amounts to national debt.
In the Philippines, the Bataan plant, which has never been used, was for the last twenty years the country’s largest item of overseas debt.
The ﬁnal payment was made this year, almost 32 years after work began.17 Twenty years since construction began, the Atucha II reactor in
Argentina is still not ﬁnished despite a one billion US dollar price tag.18

One third of the planet’s population, some two billion people, have no access to basic energy services.
For these people, nuclear power is too big, too expensive and simply incompatible with their electricity grids.

Renewable energy & energy efﬁciency - the only option

Greenpeace and the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC)
commissioned the DLR Institute (German Aerospace Centre) to
develop a global sustainable energy pathway up to 2050. This
“Energy [R]evolution” scenario24 is a realistic blueprint for a
sustainable and equitable energy future. It would maintain economic
growth and achieve fairer distribution and access to energy. Most
importantly, it is based on credible and proven renewable energy
technologies and energy efﬁciency. It includes both a nuclear and a
fossil fuel phase out.

The Energy Revolution scenario shows that by sustaining the current
double-digit growth rate of the renewable energy industry, increasing
the use of combined heat and power and introducing high efﬁciency
standards for cars, buildings and all energy consuming appliances,
it is possible to generate sufﬁcient electricity for a globally growing
economy, without throwing the climate into chaos.

4 International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2006. However, other analysis by the International
Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) shows that nuclear power represents only 2.2% of world
energy consumption. This is because the IIASA considers the electric output of a nuclear plant a
primary energy source. The IEA on the other hand considers heat the primary energy source and then
assumes a 33% efﬁciency. Consequently, the value in primary energy of a kWh of nuclear power
produced today according to IIASA’s methodology is roughly one third of that of the same kWh
according to the IEA methodology.

6 Trillion (1,000,000,000,000) is a thousand billion. To double the existing capacities by 2030 would

require building at least 500,000 MW of new nuclear capacity, to both replace retiring plants and add
new capacity. If we take the most recent experience from Olkiluoto-3 as a reasonable price tag, we
get construction cost of 4,300 USD/kW. Moody's analysis gives low estimate at 5,000 and high at
6,000 USD/kW. (New Nuclear Generation in the United States: Keeping Options Open vs Addressing
An Inevitable Necessity, Moody’s Investor Services, October 10th 2007). Hence: 500,000,000 kW x
4,300 USD (low) = 2.15 trillion, 500,000,000 kW x 6,000 USD (high) = 3 trillion

Greenpeace Recommendations

The world must get on a course to stay as far below a two degree Celsius temperature rise as possible. That course can
only be reached by employing sustainable renewable energy and energy efﬁciency. Nuclear power is not part of the climate
solution but an expensive and dangerous distraction.

• Global greenhouse gas emissions must peak and decline by 2015 and be halved by 2050.

• Binding commitments are needed for industrialised countries to cut emissions by 30% in 2020 and 80% in 2050,

with domestic measures, and to direct massive funds for decarbonisation in developing countries.

An end to the nuclear age:

• Phase out existing reactors.

• No new construction of commercial nuclear reactors.

• Stop international trade in nuclear technologies and materials.

• Phase out all direct and indirect subsidies for nuclear energy.

A renewable energy future:

• Divert state funding for energy research into nuclear and fossil fuel energy technologies towards clean, renewable energy

and energy efﬁciency.

• Set legally-binding targets for renewable energy.

• Adopt legislation to provide investors in renewable energy with stable, predictable returns.

• Guarantee priority access to the grid for renewable generators.

• Adopt strict efﬁciency standards for all electricity-consuming appliances.

14 German government press release 17th September 2007:

http://www.bmu.de/english/current_press_releases/pm/40029.php

15 With thanks to The Greens and European Free Alliance in the European Parliament for much of the information

in this section from their fact sheet “ Nuclear power will not save our climate: 40 facts and arguments”.

16 The mechanism laid down in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol describes the policies whose beneﬁts are

shared out among the countries of the northern and southern hemispheres. The aim is to assist
southern-hemisphere countries ‘in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the
ultimate objective of the Convention’ (Article 12.2.). These activities should have ‘real, measurable and
long-term beneﬁts’ (Article 12.5.b). The rejection of nuclear power in the CDM is given concrete
expression by the commitment of all the northern hemisphere countries not to resort to CDM for
projects based on the use of nuclear energy. In view of the decision-making system that applies, via
the CDM Board, this essentially means that nuclear power will be ruled out for the next decade at least.
