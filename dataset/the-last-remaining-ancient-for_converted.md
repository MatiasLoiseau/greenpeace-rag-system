THE LAST

OF THE WORLDS ANCIENT FORESTS

THE FUTURE OF ANCIENT FORESTS

In 1992 all but nine of the world’s independent states signed an agreement in Rio

to help stop the destruction of the world’s remaining forests.

Ten years later, more than 10 million hectares of ancient forest are still being clea-

red or destroyed every year. That is an area the size of a soccer pitch every two

seconds.

These forests are essential to maintain life on earth and are truly diverse. They

include boreal, temperate and tropical forests; coniferous and broadleaved forests;

rainforests, dry forests and mangroves. They regulate the climate, filter air, clean

water and prevent erosion. They have a mitigating effect on heat, frost, drought and

storms.

The ancient forests are home to millions of forest people who depend on them for

their survival both physically and spiritually. These forests also house around

two-thirds of the world’s terrestrial species of plants and animals. That’s hundreds

of thousands of different plants and animals, whose future depend on the ancient

forests.

Throughout the world, the ancient forests are in crisis. Almost a quarter of the

world’s mammals and 12 per cent of its birds are now on the edge of extinction.

Countless species living in these forests have already been lost. If forest

destruction rates set in the 1990s continue, half of the species living in the forests

of the world, will disappear by the middle of this century. And many of the peoples

and cultures who depend on these forests for their way of life are also under threat.

There is a last chance to protect these forests and the life they support.

WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?

WHAT IS AN ANCIENT FOREST?

Ancient forests are the world’s remaining forests which
have been shaped largely by natural events and
which are little impacted by human activities. They are
one of the earth’s most precious natural treasures
and have developed over thousands, if not millions of
years. They nurture ecological and climate processes.

threat to them and of their commercial importance is
helpful to decision-makers in politics and business.
Global Forest Watch (GFW) is the first worldwide forest
mapping and monitoring network created by the World
Resources Institute (WRI) aiming to use comparable
parameters and methods. GFW has provided the data
for these maps.

accurate assessment of intactness. Second-phase
analysis is good for eliminating areas that have under-
gone logging and other disturbance (such as oil and
gas development) and is being verified by field surveys.

Methodology
• Due to the different availability of datasets the

analysis of satellite imagery can vary slightly from
region to region.

For example:
• Siberia: two different sets of low (phase 2 a) and
high (phase 2 b) resolution satellite imagery
were used to identify logging roads and new and old
clearcuts. In a phase 2 c these outcomes were
verified by field surveys.

• Chile: detailed government inventory data, based
on remote sensing information and field surveys
were analysed to identify intact forests

WHAT IS THE WRI?

The World Resources Institute is an independent
centre for policy research and technical assistance on
global environmental and development issues.
WRI’s mission is to move human society to live in ways
hat protect the earth’s environment and its capacity
to provide for the needs and aspirations of current and
future generations.

THE GFW APPROACH

WORK IN PROGRESS AND PROBLEMS

Phase 1. Mapping potentially intact ancient
forest (i.e. large tracts of low-access forest)
Delineating large tracts of forest with no known
access infrastructure gives a good proxy measure of
intactness, particularly in regions dominated by
primary forest. In this phase mapped areas are prio-
ritised for further analysis.

Methodology
• Existing datasets on known location of roads, rail-

ways, power lines and where appropriate, navigable
waterways are integrated, and used to delineate
low-access forest.

• These areas are then sorted by block size, to iden-

tify large tracts of low-access forest (The size
depends on the forest type, and the region-specific
human pressures which are associated with roads
and other access routes.

Phase 2. Mapping intact ancient forest
Taking the natural and geographical situation into
account satellite imagery is being analysed for a more

The maps shown here are not based on standardized
approaches, and so are not always readily com-
parable. Differences in data availability, region-specific
patterns in human disturbance, and ecosystem
(forest type) specific criteria for identifying intact forests
makes standardisation very difficult. The projects
involved also began at different times in different
areas, and have reached different stages of progress.
There was, for example, a very good data base for
Siberia, and excellent opportunities for working with
this data (the GIS lab having experienced people
and enough money), with the result that the maps are
already finished.
Poor data quality and data gaps currently prevent
accurate mapping of the central African rainforest. And
in the Amazon the GFW has only just started to
create the infrastructure needed to start its research.
So what you see here is »work in progress« based
on preliminary data still under review. But it is a begin-
ning, and it shows how important this project is. This
brochure presents what to Greenpeace are the
most important results of the mapping project to date.

WHY ARE LARGE AREAS FOCUSED ON?

Large areas provide enough habitat to support healthy
populations of even our most far-ranging species,
such as wolves and tigers. They are also large enough
to support these species in the face of natural
disturbance which have shaped forest ecosystems for
millenia. Large undisturbed areas are also needed
as a reference for the large majority of forests which
have already been destroyed. The natural processes
of forest development can then be compared and
understood. Fragmentation divides areas into smaller
blocks, splits animal populations and disturbs
patterns of movement. Roads are also associated with
human pressures which degrade forest ecosystems,
such as poaching, logging and clearing.

POSSIBLE EXCEPTIONS

The chosen blocksize of mostly 50.000 hectares is
only a rough guidance for mapping the last intact an-
cient forests. Known key ecological areas can also be
taken into account. One of those key ecological areas
is the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia. It is
one of the last temperate rainforest areas in the world.
To protect rare species such as the Spirit Bear smaller
units of ancient forests need to be protected as well.

WHY MAPS?

To protect ancient forests effectively it is necessary
to know where they are located. An assessment of the

At least 15.000 ha of ancient forests in europe fall victim to chainsaws every year.

THE LAST ANCIENT FORESTS OF EUROPE

WHEN THE LAST ANCIENT FORESTS
OF EUROPE DISAPPEAR, SO TOO WILL THE
BROWN BEAR

Deciduous forests once covered almost the whole of
central and Western Europe. Today the continent’s only
undisturbed forests are in its extreme north. Sweden
and Finland now have only three per cent of what Euro-
pean ancient forest remains. Only 14 per cent of
the forests in european russia are still intact. They now
provide the only area of refuge for many species of
animals and plants. Undisturbed lakes, riversides and
swamps surrounded by ancient forest. Ancient forests
are the most important habitat for the brown bear,
which used to have its home in all the once copiously
forested areas of Europe, from Scandinavia to
the Mediterranean. The destruction and dismembering
of its habitat is becoming a bigger and bigger danger
to what is europes strongest animal. At least 150
square kilometres of ancient forests fall victim to
chainsaws every year. Plants, too, have a hard time.
New vegetation can take years to grow in polar regions
with short summers, and more seldom than ever does
it attain the state it originally had in other climate
zones.

ANALYTIC METHODS

In the first phase of the study topographical maps
were used to exclude areas which have a highly devel-
oped infrastructure and high populations. In the
phase 2 a medium-resolution satellite pictures (150
metres per pixel) taken in two consecutive years were
used in order to exclude tundra areas, agricultural
areas and areas with visible clearcuts. The phase 2 b
employed only high-resolution Landsat satellite pictures
or analogue satellite pictures (15 -35 metres per pixel)
in order to identify and map the exact boundaries
of intact ancient forest areas. Sixty-seven field surveys
(phase 2 c) aimed at checking the information from
the analyses of the satellite pictures.
Intact forest landscape (IFL), for the purposes of this
study, is an area with the following characteristics:
• it is situated within the forest zone;
• it is sufficiently large (smallest are 50.000 hectares

and minimum breadth ten kilometres);

• it contains a contiguous mosaic of natural eco-

systems which may or may not be of different types;

• it is not broken or fragmented by infrastructure; and
• it does not display signs of significant transforma-

tion caused by human activity.

The common perception of Russia as a country with
an unlimited wild natural environment is a myth. In
reality its undisturbed areas, and particularly the last
big intact ancient forests, are shrinking rapidly.
Exploitation for wood and timber, road building, mining,
pipelines and railways are cutting up the ancient
forests into small fragments. The forest industry here
uses mainly the destructive »cut and run« practice
of logging and vanishing.

In some parts all forests are transformed, in others the remaining intact forest is broken into fragments.

THE SNOW FORESTS OF ASIAN RUSSIA

RUSSIA IS THE MOST FORESTED
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD

Even at temperatures of minus 50 degrees Celsius,
boreal coniferous forests flourish in Russia. And
despite the extreme conditions countless species of
fungi, fern, lichen and moss are found here. In the
over 5.000 kilometres of forested area, the landscape
changes from sparse tundra covered with stunted
willows and birch in the North to dense coniferous and
deciduous forests in the southern region.
The great expanse of the forest means that even large
mammals can find sufficient food here – elk, brown
bears, the lynx and, at the south-eastern edge of the
taiga, even the Siberian tiger still exists.
This tiger originally roamed huge areas of Asia. Today it
only lives in a small area of ancient forest along the
Sea of Japan north of Vladivostok. There are now twice
as many of these animals in the world’s zoos as
in the wild, where only 400 Siberian tigers are
found.
The minerals and reserves of timber in eastern
Siberia today still arouse greed throughout the world.
The dilapidated Russian economy is highly dependent
on foreign exchange, and is therefore engaged in a
sell-out of nature on an indescribable scale.

CHARACTERISTICS

DATA PROBLEMS

Intact forest landscapes in this case are defined as
in europe. Remaining intact forests are poorly stocked.
The vast majority of these forests have a low produc-
tion potential.

METHOD FOR DELINEATION
OF INTACT FOREST LANDSCAPES

Phase 1: Reduction of the initial candidate area (the
total area of the forest zone) by elimination of
areas in the vicinity (i.e. within buffer zones) of infra-
structure as well as landscape fragments smaller
than 50.000 hectares
Phase2 a: Reduction of the remaining candidate area
(roadless landscapes greater than 50.000 hectares) by
elimination of areas with larger surface disturbances,
visible in satellite images with a resolution of 150 -300
meters
Phase2 b: Reduction of the remaining area (candidate
intact forest landscapes) by elimination of smaller
linear and surface disturbances, visible in satellite
images of high resolution (15 -35 meters)

The available information is of different quality for
different parts of Russia. In the naturally highly
fragmented tundra forests in the northernmost regions
of Siberia and the Russian Far East, the accuracy
of the available information was not high enough to
assess the degree of human transformation of the
landscape. These forests are shown as forested areas
outside of the studied territory.

THE MYTH

The situation is particularly critical for intact natural
landscapes. In the absence of decisive action within the
next few years, such landscapes may disappear
within whole ecological regions and even vegetation
zones.
Intact areas remain only in the most inaccessible
mountainous locations, while the unique far-eastern
broad-leaved and mixed conifer-broad-leafed forests
have been almost totally transformed by industrial
logging during the last decade.
Exposing it as a myth, these findings refute the com-
mon opinion that ancient forests still dominate
Russia. Such forests dominate only in the northern
parts of Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East.

THE AFRICAN FOREST OF THE GREAT APES

ENDANGERED HABITAT OF THE
FOREST ELEPHANT AND THE GREAT APES

RESULTS

The Central African Rainforest is the second largest
tropical ancient forest area in the world and home to
an immeasurable diversity of plant and animal
species. About one thousand species of birds and
four hundred species of mammals live in the forests of
the Democratic Republic of Congo alone.
The forest elephant has its home here. Partly due
to its secluded life, it is one of the last animals on the
continent which has not been researched.
In five to ten years, experts estimate that the apes
– gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos – will have
disappeared together with the last undisturbed forest
areas.
Protected areas are mostly ignored. Nature protection
efforts are thwarted because of a lack of political
will, money and personnel, and because of poverty and
corruption.
Africa has lost two thirds of its ancient forests in the
last thirty years. The industrial timber industry is
responsible for destroying huge areas of ancient forest.
»Selective extraction« is what the international timber
corporations call the method by which they – purportedly
protectively – saw down only one or two of the most
expensive giant trees per hectare. What they omit to say
is that up to 70 per cent of the remaining vegetation
in the logging area also falls victim to roads, sawing
machines or bulldozers, or is crushed by falling trees.

This coarse scale fragmentation analysis concludes
that Central Africa contains some of the world’s largest
tracts of potentially intact ancient forests. However the
future of these rainforests is unclear due to the
rapid spread of commercial extraction activities at
unsustainable rates. Of the remaining potentially intact
ancient forest tracts, 40 per cent are within commer-
cial logging concessions. In areas of concessions,
significantly more access is revealed than the regional
analysis shows. In addition, illegal logging is rampant
in many areas of the region.

DATA PROBLEMS

Most geographic data available for Africa is coarse,
inaccurate, and based on outdated maps over twenty
years old. In the Republic of Congo, for example,
the majority of data is over 40 years old. There is no
publicly available data of logging roads for any of
the countries in the region, and road data misses most
roads constructed in the last twenty years.

THIS IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY

The limited regional analysis does not take the logging
roads that pass through concessions throughout

Growing of concessions in ancient forests of Cameroon

Central Africa into account. So it provides only a rough
picture of forest fragmentation. While the coarse
scale map shows extensive areas of potentially intact
ancient forests, new logging road data for Cameroon,
mapped from 1999 - 2001 satellite imagery, reveals
that significant portions of areas mapped as low
access forests are actually fragmented by commercial
logging operations. It can be assumed that in
many other parts of Central Africa the situation is not
very different making the coarse scale map overly
optimistic.

tion, update this

analysis, and make

able.

THE LAST ANCIENT FORESTS OF NORTH AMERICA

WOLVES DISAPPEAR
WITH THE ANCIENT FORESTS

on the North American continent. This is equivalent to
an area three times the size of Switzerland.

Coniferous forests without end meet the treeless
tundra in the North of the American continent. This is a
landscape of scarce resources, hard winters and
short summers. The trees here are among the biggest
tallest and oldest in the world.
One of the last intact temperate rainforests is to be
found further south, on the west coast of Canada, in
British Columbia. Here the moist sea air is forced up-
wards to the summits of the coastal mountains, where
clouds turn into rain. Only here does the white kermode
or spirit bear, a rare subspecies of black bear, exist.
Timber corporations clearcut whole areas of land to
obtain pulp to make paper. As a result, soils erode and
rivers silt up.
The habitats of about two thirds of the 140.000
species of plants, animals and micro-organisms found
in Canada are tied to the ancient forest.
The plundering of nature has gone still further in
the USA than it has in Canada. Here 94 per cent of the
original forest has already been cut down.
North America is also the home of the wolf, once one
of the most widespread mammals on earth. Its
population in North America today is estimated at no
more than 63.000. There is a lack of forest corridors
for wolves to roam in, and of large intact areas of
ancient forest available to them as a refuge.
From 1990 to 2000 timber corporations destroyed at
least 123.000 square kilometres of ancient forest

THE APPROACH ENTAILS

• Developing a 1 km 2 grid over a regional transpor-

tation dataset, depicting access routes.
• Overlaying gridded access routes on a 1 km 2

resolution spatial land cover dataset for 1992 -93.
• dentifying all forests which fell outside of these trans-
port route grid as potentially intact ancient forests.

• Delineating large tracts (> 50.000 hectares) of

potentially intact ancient forests.

DATA PROBLEMS AND STATE OF MAP

Being a coarse scale assessment, this map attempts
to provide only a regional picture of areas that are
potentially intact. This analysis fails to pick up fragmen-
tation from non-linear features, such as clearcuts
and mines. Also, the analysis does not evaluate distur-
bance from small roads, and seismic lines, which
significantly increase fragmentation. For example:
Current preliminary analysis in New England at a finer
scale shows an average increase of 40 per cent in
transportation lines from mapping from relatively medi-
um scale (1:1.000.000) to finer scale (1:24.000).
In some cases up to an 80 per cent increase in trans-
portation lines has occurred.

RESULTS

Results indicate that two-thirds of the regions forests
and woodlands are large tracts (> 20.000 ha) of
potentially intact ancient forests. The majority of these
are located in the northernmost regions of the con-
tinent, in Canada and Alaska. They consist of a mix
of forest and tundra. Forests of the lower 48 States
(of the USA) are relatively fragmented, with only
20 per cent of forest cover remaining in large, poten-
tially intact blocks. Most of them are located in
the Rocky Mountains and the coastal range of the
pacific Northwest.

Almost all of Chile`s ancient forests are found in and around the Andean Mountain Range.

THE TEMPERATE JUNGLE OF SOUTH AMERICA

TEMPERATE RAINFORESTS OF THE ANDES
– NO MORE REFUGE FOR RARE DEER

Outside the tropics, rainforests are a rarity in the
world. The Valdivia ancient forest in Chile is the second
largest temperate rainforest on earth. Despite being
isolated, the Chilean jungle is, however, not far enough
away from the rest of the world to be safe from
destruction. At the same time, its bio-geographical iso-
lation prevents plants and animals migrating there.
As a result, a unique spectrum of species, with unusu-
ally high biodiversity for such a climate zone, has
developed in Chile. Some alerce trees (conifers) have
been found to be more than 3.600 years old.
Most of this forest has already been cut down or
damaged, and the last intact areas are threatened by
the timber industry. In the 1990s Chile did almost
nothing to protect its ancient forests. On the contrary,
from 1996 to 1998 the production of industrial
roundwood increased by 83 per cent compared to the
previous decade.
The huemel, the deer on the Chilean coat of arms,
used to be found from the flat coastal regions of Chile
and the Argentinian Patagonia to the Andes. Today
it lives in just a fraction of its original range, at heights
between 3.300 and 5.000 metres. Its population is
estimated to be a few thousand.
A glimpse at the map of the country shows that Chile
really does, as travel agents claim, lie at the »end
of the world«. With the Pacific Ocean on one side and
the snow-covered 6.000-metres peaks of the Andes
on the other, it is, in effect, a bio-geographical island.

METHOD

The study is based on the digital information generated
by a project carried out for the Chilean government
agency responsible for forest management. This data-
base contains the most recent and complete informa-

tion (1995) on the forest resources of Chile and has
been technically and politically validated. This pro-
ject used aerial photographs, principally at a scale of
1:20.000, and satellite images for the northern
and southern boundaries of Chile. In combination with
the aerial photographs, 3.600 days of fieldwork
were spent.

FINDINGS

The report describes for the first time the extent and
distribution of the countries ancient forests. Ancient
forests in Chile are defined as mature forests or dense
timberline forests, that are made up of native species,
and are intact or have been only slightly altered.
Only a quarter of all forest is in relatively undisturbed
tracts of at least 10.000 ha. Almost all of Chile’s
ancient forests are found in and around the Andean
Mountain Range. At the regional level, the extent
of frontier forests increases as one moves southward
through the country.

Ancient forests are at greatest risk in:
• Coastal mountain range forests, which house 7.5
per cent of Chile’s remaining ancient forests. They
house a rich and diverse range of species. The
major threats to these forests are non-native planta-
tion developments, inadequate enforcement of
regulations, and plans for a new coastal highway.

• In the northern regions, where only few of the
native forests remain as ancient forest, mostly
unprotected. Most of the countries forest industries
are concentrated in this region.

Selective logging is the most frequent cause of native
forest degradation, accounting for 75 per cent of
degraded forest area.
Over a tenth of Chile’s forest has been converted
to plantations, most of which are dominated by exotic
species.
Because the information used for this study covers the
period 1994 -1997, an update is urgently needed to
obtain a more accurate picture of what is happening on
the ground.

Many ancient forests

are in areas with

steep slopes or locat-

ed at high altitudes.

As such, they are

particularly sensitive

to human disturbance.

THE PARADISE FORESTS OF ASIA PACIFIC

THE JUNGLE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA, WHERE
ORANG-UTANS ARE DYING WITH THE TREES

The island chains of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea
stretch between the mainland of Asia and Australia. The
spectrum of spectacular ancient forests there ranges
from bays surrounded by mangroves through tropical
jungle to rhododendron forests on the mountain-sides.
The Indonesian ancient forest is also where the last
orang-utans, the ape which already has a history of
15 million years on earth, has its place of refuge.
Orang-utans (the name means forest people) grow to
five feet tall and weigh 100 kilos and are fully adapted
to a life in the trees. In the last decade, the wild
population shrunk by half. There are probably fewer
than 30.000 orang-utans today climbing hand over
hand through the last rainforests in Indonesia.
Logging and large-scale resettlement programmes have
destroyed large parts of the rainforest. In the last
three decades of rule by the Suharto clan, the forest
has been systematically plundered. Tensions between
the new settlers and the groups of peoples already
living there regularly lead to confrontations. On Irian
Jaya,  protests by indigenous peoples against the
destruction of nature have been crushed by the mili-
tary. Even after the old guard in power in Indonesia had
been replaced, economic problems and outbreaks
of violence have put environmental issues right to the
bottom of the new politicians’ agenda.
Indonesia loses many thousands of square kilometres

of forest every year. Illegal and destructive practices
and corruption are the norm. Over two-thirds of the tim-
ber processed in Indonesian saw-mills has been illegally
logged. World Bank advisors have confirmed that the
timber industry in these areas is in an »anarchic« state.

SOURCES OF DATA AND DIFFICULTIES

The report suffers from all the imperfections of the
information sources: missing data, often outdated,
sometimes conflicting. The exact extent and distribu-
tion of Indonesia’s forests still cannot be mapped.
No integrated record of forest area has been kept in
Indonesia, so any analysis must be based on a variety
of national and subnational scale sources. A major
problem in dealing with these datasets is their lack of
direct comparability. But that is not all. Until recently,
researchers had to deal with government secrecy,
bureaucratic confusion, and intimidation by industry.
And last but not least, private citizens who attempt
to monitor illegal corporate activity still face consid-
erable risks.

FINDINGS

The analysis indicates that a total of just over 52 mil-
lion hectares may be defined as potentially intact
ancient forest. A further 33 million hectares meet the

criteria for potentially intact ancient forest but are
within logging concessions. It may be assumed that
much of this forest area is far from intact.
Indonesia is experiencing one of the highest rates
of tropical forest loss in the world: Fourty per cent of
the forests existing in 1950 were cleared in the
following 50 years. About one million hectares per year
were cleared in the 1980s. Since 1996, deforesta-
tion appears to have increased to an average of two
million hectares per year. Only one century ago
forest cover was estimated at being about 170 million
hectares. Today it is approximately 98 million hectares,
at least half of which is believed to be degraded by
human activity.
Deforestation in Indonesia is largely the result of a cor-
rupt political and economic system that regarded
forests as a source of revenue to be exploited for polit-
ical ends and personal gain. Logging concessions
covering more than half the country’s total forest area
were awarded by ex-president Suharto, many of
them to his relatives and political allies.
Illegal logging has reached epidemic proportions.
Aggressive expansion of Indonesia’s pulp and paper
industries over the past decade has created an
enormous level of demand for wood fibre that cannot
currently be met by sustainable domestic forest
management. The gap is filled by illegally cut wood,
which accounted for approximately 65 per cent
of total supply in 2000.

More than 20 million

hectares of forest

have been cleared

since 1985, but the

majority of this

land has not been put

to productive alter-

native uses.

The Amazon is the earth’s biggest area of
tropical ancient forest and home of the jaguar

With an area as big as the United States, the Amazon
rainforest is the biggest area of tropical ancient
forest in the world. Roughly half of all the world’s
species of animals and plants living on land, scien-
tists estimate, live here. Giant trees wrapped around
by lianas, overgrown areas of water and incessant
chirping, fluttering, screeching and meandering move-
ment of life make the Amazon forest the paradigm
example of luxuriant rainforest.
The Amazon region is also the last big reserve of
the jaguar, which lives in the ancient forests of South
and Central America. This wild cat, which needs
a territorial area of as much as 40 square kilometres
(15 square miles), is under threat, and is listed as

threatened species in the Washington convention on
wild fauna and flora. The greatest threat to the jaguar
is the irreversible destruction of the forests.
But despite its natural treasures this area is more
endangered as ever before. 128.000 square kilometres
of South American rainforest fell victim to chain-
saws between 1990 and 1995 – an area equivalent
to that of Austria and Switzerland together.

Situation in the forests

And to be able to get at the valuable trees scattered
about in the rainforest, corridors into the forest
have been cut and roads built. This means that for
every valuable tree many other giant trees fall
victim to logging and removal. In addition, mining com-

panies are dredging whole river deltas, and the mer-
cury used in gold-washing is polluting water and soils.
The Brazilian environment authorities have too small
resources in personnel and are too poorly equipped to
be able to move against internationally active timber
corporations in this huge area. As a result 80 per cent
of timber is felled illegally, without a logging con-
cession. Despite the publication of this figure by the
Brazilian authorities, demand for cheap plywood
from Brazil has remained undiminished. The govern-
ments of the main importing countries, the USA,
Italy, France and Japan, have made no significant
efforts to stop the illegal destruction of the rainforest
or to see the Brazilian government obligated to making
the timber industry more environmentally friendly.

CONCLUSIONS

Fifteen percent of the Amazon Rainforest has already
been destroyed. A significant part of what remains is
under direct threat.

Fourty per cent of the remaining potentially intact
ancient forests in Central Africa are within commercial
logging concessions. The future is uncertain for the
creatures and peoples who depend on these forests.

In North America, at least 12.3 million hectares of nat-
ural ancient forest have been lost between
1990 and 2000. The United States has refused to
make a formal commitment to the CBD and by
doing so is refusing to commit to saving its remaining
biological and cultural diversity.

Some 30 countries throughout eastern and western
Europe have no intact ancient forests left. Only
European Russia retains extensive intact ancient
forests and even these are under serious threat
from industrial logging.

Some regions of the Snow Forests of Asian Russia
have already been logged out. Mining and other
resource extraction pose serious threats to these
forests.

Only a quarter of all chilian forest is in relatively undis-
turbed tracts of at least 10.000 ha.

Indonesia is experiencing one of the highest rates
of tropical forest loss in the world: fourty per cent of
the forests existing in 1950 where cleared in the
following 50 years.

About 80% of the world’s original forests are gone.

That we know and we cannot change.

The world’s ancient forests are facing a crisis.

There is an urgent need to protect the ecological
integrity of the remaining ancient forests for this and
future generations.

If humankind is to protect ancient forest biodiversity
and traditional cultures, ancient forest loss must be
stopped during the coming decade.

World governments must choose now to save the
world’s remaining ancient forests
