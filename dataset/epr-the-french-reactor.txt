Catalysing an energy revolutionBriefing November 2008EPR:  
The French
Reactor
A costly and hazardous
obstacle to climate protection

2 Greenpeace International  EPR: The French ReactorThe French EPR* Reactor is a new reactor design developed by the French 
company Areva in co-operation with the German firm Siemens. Serious doubts 
have been raised about the safety and cost of the EPR. A study of the EPR’ s 
blueprints and experience at the two sites where EPRs are under construction, 
in Finland (Olkiluoto 3) and France (Flamanville 3), has revealed weaknesses in 
design, problems during construction phases and soaring costs.
Despite this, the EPR is enthusiastically marketed as the world’ s largest reactor, 
with a power generation capacity of 1600 MW. The EPR is promoted as a 
nuclear power plant that is safer, cheaper, more mature and more reliable than any other. It has been presented as the only example of an advanced “third 
generation” reactor; a flagship of the nuclear ‘renaissance’. Promotional 
materials promise, for example:
“The EPR is the direct descendant of the well proven N4 and KONVOI reactors, 
guaranteeing a fully mastered technology. As a result, risks linked to design, licensing, construction and operation of the EPR are minimised, providing a 
unique certainty to EPR customers.”
 ¹
The only certainty with current EPR projects is that they are not delivering on 
these promises in four key areas.

2008, the Finnish Nuclear 
Safety Authority (STUK) 
reported 2,100 safety 
and quality defects in the 
construction
1. Safety
The EPR is a pressurised water reactor that, in many respects, 
actually differs little from the majority of existing “second generation” 
reactors. Its concept is based on developments dating from the 
1970s. It includes some claimed improvements, but the attempts to make the reactor more competitive also have their downsides when 
time and budget pressure lead to rush and the hiring of incompetent 
workers.Information in August 2008 has revealed that the safety culture in 
Olkiluoto 3 is in disarray. Employees were prevented from speaking 
about the ongoing construction, including issues such as safety problems, or workers rights.
Large volumes of radioactivity
The EPR is the most powerful reactor ever built, with a core that contains more radioactive elements than any other. In addition, 
for reasons of economy, it is designed to burn fuel longer. However, 
this leads to increased radioactivity and more dangerous nuclear isotopes. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel used by the EPR is a mix of 
uranium and plutonium, which also results in a higher output of 
hazardous materials. In the event of a serious accident the impacts could be vast, 
releasing large quantities of radioactivity into the environment.  
A study conducted in 2007 by Large Associates, a British nuclear engineering consulting company, showed that, were a serious 
accident to occur involving the EPR in France, it could require the 
evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people, would involve the serious contamination of many thousands of square kilometres and 
might result in thousands of human fatalities.²
Terrorism
Having been designed prior to 2001, the EPR does not reflect the 
changed security situation following the 9/11 attacks in the United 
States. While it has robust containment, pathways and vulnerabilities 
have been identified that could lead to radioactivity bypassing the 
containment unit under certain scenarios.³ The ability of the 
containment unit to withstand the impact of a large aircraft was placed in doubt according to official French documents leaked in 
2003. One of the reasons for delays and complications with EPR 
construction in Finland has been the need to reinforce the containment unit when the original design did not meet the safety 
criteria required in Finland.Rush and incompetence
According to articles published in the industrial periodical many 
problems with the EPR project in Finland can be attributed to a 
combination of a tight time schedule and considerable cost pressure. 
Similar circumstances are likely to apply to other future nuclear projects. The unrealistic price and construction timetable of Olkiluoto 
3 have been a strong incentive for Areva NP (a daughter company  
of Areva, formerly known as Framatome ANP) to cut costs and to refuse to perform time-consuming corrections when problems  
arose.
4 According to articles published in industrial periodical 
Nucleonics Week, Areva’s attempts to reduce costs led the company to select cheap, incompetent subcontractors and overlook  
safety-related problems. In addition, nuclear safety training was not provided to workers.
5 
Because of fast-track licensing, Olkiluoto 3 subcontractors have 
used outdated blueprints, and Finnish authorities have at times been 
unable to supervise work as they have not had the necessary design documents. New reactor designs are inherently harder to build and 
control because of their larger size and fuel burn-up, which places 
high demands on construction. The stagnation of nuclear construction over the last decade has 
resulted in a shortage of competent personnel and companies.
6  
In France, reports from ASN inspections repeatedly mentioned that the problems arise from “haste without any quality assurance 
process”.

Located outside of the 
containment. Damage due to 
airplane crash or other 
external event can lead to massive leakage and 
contamination.
Reactor base-slab
Failure can affect power plant’s stability and lead to leakage of 
contamination from molten reactor.
Olkiluoto 3: Concrete mixture was improper, with too-high water 
content, leading to high chemical vulnerability and danger of cracking.
Flamanville 3:  Concrete mixture did not meet required standards, 
and base-slab has already developed cracks. Reinforcement steel 
bars were arranged and welded improperly. Repeated failure to 
improve quality forced state inspectors to order suspension of the 
works for one month in May 2008.Pressuriser
Failure can lead to loss of coolant or pressure, 
with reactor meltdown as a result.
Olkiluoto 3: Four out of five pieces had to be 
recast because of malfunction. Problems were not detected by regular inspections.
Flamanville 3:  Following the problem of non-
conformity in quality control, the French Nuclear 
Safety Authority asked Areva to prove the good 
quality of components of the pressuriser that 
were manufactured in Italy.
Steam generator
Rupture can lead to loss of coolant 
and reactor meltdown.
Olkiluoto 3: Failed to meet quality 
requirement, repairs had to be made.Weaknesses in construction
Apart from problems with the EPR design blueprint, 
there is growing evidence from construction sites in Finland and France that in reality the reactor has more safety and reliability weaknesses. Several problems have been made public to date…
Primary cooling pipes
Rupture can lead to loss of coolant 
and meltdown. 
Olkiluoto 3:  All eight huge pipe 
circuits failed to meet required safety criteria and had to be recast. The 
steel of the refabricated pipes was 
also found to be of inferior quality.
Reactor
The world’s largest 
reactor, with the 
largest amount of 
radioactive materials inside. Potentially 
running on “MOX” 
fuel with increased content of plutonium.Reactor vessel
Failure can lead to outburst 
under high pressure, loss of 
coolant and meltdown.
Olkiluoto 3: Five out of six components failed to meet 
French safety criteria and 
had to be remanufactured. Problems with welding 
occurred.

Containment
Failure can lead to massive leakage of radiation and contaminate 
environment. Ability to withstand airliner impact doubtful.
Olkiluoto 3: Steel framework of the containment was welded for 
at least half a year without mandatory tests, oversight and guidelines. Problems with quality of concrete.

had not taken Finland’s winters into account. Thermal 
expansion of concrete not taken into account and the 
blueprints had to be redone.Containment inner steel liner
Failure leads to loss of airtightness of the containment and can 
cause leakage of radiation to the outside.
Olkiluoto 3: Manually welded in a Polish machine yard with no 
experience of nuclear construction. Welds were defective. Dozen holes cut in wrong places. Badly stored and damaged in storm. 
Defects in welding continued in assembly of the liner in Olkiluoto.

2. Nuclear Waste
Areva claims that one of the advantages of the EPR is that it will 
produce less waste than other reactors. But the EPR does not solve 
the nuclear waste problem. While the promise is that the volume of 
waste will be reduced by 15 percent, the waste that is produced will be more dangerous because it will be more radioactive. With regard 
to radioactivity, the EPR will not be a step forward: improved fuel 
combustion rates simply lead to more dangerous waste. In addition, by being able to function with 100 percent MOX fuel (a mixture of 
uranium and plutonium oxides) the EPR will be a major link in the 
nuclear reprocessing scheme that is highly contaminating.
3. Costs
The EPR has been promoted as a technology that makes nuclear energy cheaper and more competitive. When the decision was made 
to build an EPR in Finland, in 2002, the government promised that it 
would cost Euro 2.5 billion and take only four years to build. The final contract, three years later, put the price at Euro 3.2 billion and 
construction time was set at 4.5 years. Since construction began in 
summer 2005, a variety of technical problems have led to a three-year delay, extending the construction period to at least 7 years. 
The currently estimated additional cost is Euro 1.5 billion, raising the 
current price tag to Euro 4.7 billion, almost double the initial estimate. More problems, delays and cost overruns are likely to occur before 
the project is completed.
In September 2008, Nucleonics Week quoted an Areva official, saying that Euro 4.5 billion will be a minimum price for any new  
EPR.
8
The construction contract was signed as a fixed-price, turnkey 
delivery arrangement from Areva and Siemens. Extra costs will most 
likely be borne by the two companies. Nonetheless, Areva is seeking 
to claim some of the additional costs from the investor, the Finnish utility TVO.
Financing for the Finnish EPR has benefited from state support in the 
shape of a Euro 570 million loan guarantee provided by the French export agency COFACE. The low interest rates offered by French and 
German State-controlled banks may be in violation of EU legislation 
and are the subject of a pending complaint with the European Commission and the European Court.4.  Nuclear Power: an obstacle to 
tackling climate change
Nuclear power could at best make only a negligible contribution to 
CO² reduction, coming many years too late. It would also deprive real 
climate solutions of funding. Currently, 439 commercial nuclear 
reactors supply around 15 percent of global electricity providing only 6.5 percent of overall energy consumption. Even if today’s installed 
nuclear capacity was doubled it would only lead to reductions in 
global greenhouse gas emissions of less than five percent and would require one new large reactor to come online every two weeks until 
2030. An impossible task: even in countries with established nuclear 
programmes, planning, licensing and connecting a new reactor to the grid typically takes more than a decade.
Regarding experience with the Finnish EPR, the International Energy 
Agency (IEA) warned against the risk of relying on the new reactor for emission cuts, saying in 2004 that any delays would inhibit Finland’ s 
ability to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. That risk has become a reality. In August 2008, after 27 months of construction, the project was 
officially declared to be between 24 and 30 months behind schedule 
and at least Euro 1,500 million (US$2,000 million) over budget. In October 2008, it was revealed that the delay is already three years. 
Unlikely to be operational before 2012, Olkiluoto 3 will not be ready in 
time to contribute to Finland’s Kyoto target.Similarly in November 2008, not learning anything about the 
construction problems and delays in Finland, it was revealed that the 
EPR in Flamanville has been delayed for a year.  For more information about nuclear power and climate change, read 
the Greenpeace briefing, “Nuclear Power – Undermining Action on 
Climate Change” (2008).

7  EPR: The French Reactor  Greenpeace International
There is a clear scientific consensus that global greenhouse gas 
emissions must peak and decline by 2015, and must be more 
than halved by 2050, or the global climate will suffer changes with 
catastrophic consequences. The nuclear industry, which has been in decline in Europe, has seized upon the climate crisis as a 
revival opportunity, claiming to offer a carbon-free contribution to 
our future energy mix.
Nuclear power is an expensive and dangerous distraction from 
the real solutions to climate change. Greenhouse gas reduction targets can only be met through using the proven alternatives of 
renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency. Every Euro 
spent on nuclear power is a Euro stolen from the real solutions to climate change.
Avoiding the most severe impacts of climate change requires 
governments, individuals and businesses worldwide to take 
immediate action. The world must get on a course to stay as far 
below a 2° Celsius temperature rise as possible. That course can only be reached by employing sustainable and renewable energy 
and energy-efficiency. Binding commitments are needed for 
industrialised countries to cut emissions by 30% in 2020 and 80% in 2050, with domestic measures, and to direct massive 
funds for decarbonisation in developing countries.
