# Big Oil Money Looms Large in Competitive Elections

In the closest federal races, the oil & gas industry has spent an estimated
average of $4.3 million per Senate seat and $490,000 per House seat through
direct contributions, funding for party committees, and funding for super
PACs.

During this election cycle, 20 oil & gas companies and industry trade
associations contributed more than $52 million to right-wing super PACs and
party fundraising committees, and more than $4 million to candidate PACs. Much
of the spending was used to support Republican candidates running in
competitive Senate and House districts.

Whereas direct contributions are subject to strict federal limits, super PACs
and party committees can spend unlimited amounts to influence elections
(following certain rules). Big Oil contributed much more to these groups than
directly to candidates.

Donors give to super PACs and party committees that align with their political
goals, paying close attention to how the money is used. We should also be
paying attention. In this analysis, an attribution method was used to estimate
how much the oil & gas industry spent in each toss-up race—races where both
parties have more than a 40% chance and less than a 60% chance of
winning—through funding for party committees and super PACs, in addition to
direct contributions.

**Big Oil’s spending was so high that in 10 out of the 14 races analyzed, oil
& gas-attributed spending outweighed the amount that one or both candidates
raised from small donors **(donors who contributed $200 or less). These races
are bolded in the tables below.

**METHODOLOGY**

For each toss-up race (as per [FiveThirtyEight’s deluxe
model](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/),
11/3/2022), oil & gas industry totals were calculated for: (1) direct
contributions to Republican candidates and (2) support for Republican
candidates through funding for party committees and super PACs.

The first total refers to direct contributions made by oil & gas organization-
affiliated PACs to candidate PACs.

The second total refers to independent expenditures supporting a candidate (or
opposing the Democrat in the race) that were indirectly funded by oil & gas
organizations’ donations to party committees and super PACs. A two-step
attribution method was used to calculate this total. First, the amount
contributed by oil & gas organizations to each super PAC and party committee
was calculated. Next, the amount contributed to each committee was multiplied
by a spend factor per candidate (e.g., _Committee’s Independent Expenditures
for Candidate X ÷ Committee’s Overall Spend_).

The calculated totals are conservative because they account for just the top
20 oil & gas organizations with the highest political spending and the top 6
super PACs and party committees that received the most money from them. In
other words, the real totals are almost certainly much higher. Additionally,
direct contributions from party committees to candidates were omitted. They
are often much less than independent expenditures due to federal contribution
limits.

A sample calculation is included below:

  * Company X donated $200,000 to Super PAC Z
  * Super PAC Z reported spending $400,000 total this election cycle. Of that, $50,000 went to supporting Candidate Q and another $50,000 went to opposing the Democrat in Candidate Q’s race
  * It can be inferred that Company X spent $50,000 supporting Candidate Q through its contribution to Super Pac Z ($200,000 × $100,000/$400,000 = $50,000)

_Correction: An earlier version of this analysis miscounted the number of
races where oil & gas-attributed spending outweighed small donations to one or
both candidates_
