PLAINTIFFS’ SURREPLY TO DEFENDANTS’ REPLY MEMORANDUM

I.

Plaintiffs have Established Standing.

Plaintiffs have established standing to challenge the Defendants’ failure to comply with

33

NEPA.  Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff organizations have alleged injuries to their

34

concrete interests; they have demonstrated – based on the Defendants’ own admissions in the

35

Administrative Records – that it is reasonably probable that Defendants’ actions contribute to an

36

increased risk of injury to Plaintiffs’ interests; and they have established that a court order

37

requiring compliance with NEPA will redress the Plaintiffs’ injuries.  See Pls.’ Opp’n at 9-27.

In response, Defendants essentially concede that Plaintiffs have established both injury-

in-fact and redressability, and instead focus on causation, relying in large part on three new

declarations.  See Declaration of Thomas Schehl (Att. A to Def. Reply); Declaration of James

Mahoney (Att. B to Def. Reply); Declaration of Dr. David Legates (Att. C to Def. Reply).

1

Defendants’ causation argument, and its reliance on these new affidavits, distorts the nature of

the Court’s inquiry at this stage of the litigation.2  For example, relying on Dr. Legates’ largely

immaterial opinions, Defendants mistakenly assert that Plaintiffs must somehow trace each CO2

molecule emitted from projects financed by the agencies directly to the particular impacts

alleged by Plaintiffs.  See Def. Reply at 8 (citing Legates Decl. at ¶11).  However:

traceability does not mean that plaintiffs must show to a scientific certainty
that defendant's effluent . . .  caused the precise harm suffered by the
plaintiffs. . . . If scientific certainty were the standard, then plaintiffs would
be required to supply costly, strict proof of causation to meet a threshold
jurisdictional requirement – even where, as here, the asserted cause of action
does not itself require such proof.  Thus, the ‘fairly traceable’ standard is not
equivalent to a requirement of tort causation.

Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149, 161 (4th Cir. 2000)

 (internal citations and quotations omitted).

1 The Defendants have effectively engaged Dr. Legates to undermine the conclusions of

the Government’s own scientists at the EPA and the National Academy of Sciences.  Dr. Legates
is listed as an "expert", "scholar" or "advisor" with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, National
Center for Policy Analysis, George Marshall Institute and Tech Central Station.  These
organizations have received significant funding from ExxonMobil Corporation and/or the
American Petroleum Institute, and take issue with the Government’s climate change reports.  See
ExxonMobil Annual Corporate Giving Reports, http://www.exxonmobil.com/Corporate/files/
corporate/giving_report.pdf; New York Times, May 28, 2003, Jennifer Lee, “Exxon Backs
Groups That Question Global Warming”; New York Times, April 26, 1998, John Cushman
"Industrial Group Plans to Battle Climate Treaty”

2 Defendants’ new affidavits should be struck as they are both immaterial to the Court’s

analysis and are also improper extra-record evidence. See Pls.’ Motion to Strike (3/14/05).

Consistent with Gaston Copper, the Ninth Circuit has firmly established that a plaintiff

does not need to provide strict proof of “but for” causation to survive summary judgment on

standing.  Instead, a plaintiff need only aver facts that demonstrate that the defendant’s actions

contribute to an increased risk of harm to plaintiff’s concrete interests. Ocean Advocates v.

United States Army Corps of Eng'rs, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 28034, *17-18 (9th Cir. 2005)

(finding that plaintiff had standing where plaintiff alleged that defendant’s actions would

contribute to the increased risk of harm to plaintiffs’ interest, despite the fact that other

independent causes may also increase risk of harm to plaintiffs’ interest); see also Mountain

States Legal Found. v. Glickman, 92 F.3d 1228, 1234-1235 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (defendant’s

10

contribution to an increased risk of fire sufficient to establish standing, notwithstanding other

11

multiple causes contributing to an increased risk).

12

Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit has emphasized that while the causal connection put

13

forward for standing purposes cannot be too speculative “it need not be so airtight at [the

14

standing] stage of litigation as to demonstrate that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits.”

15

Ocean Advocates, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 28034, *18. Thus, within the framework of a

16

procedural injury case, Plaintiffs’ obligation to establish causation is relaxed – they need only

17

demonstrate a “reasonable concern” of harm and a “reasonable probability” that Defendants’

18

actions contribute to an increased risk of such harm.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw, 528

19

U.S. 167, 184 (2000); Citizens for Better Forestry v. USDA, 341 F.3d 961, 972 (9th Cir. 2003)

20

Here, Plaintiffs’ concerns reflect scientific consensus and are thus reasonable even in

21

light of Dr. Legates claims of mere “uncertainty.” 3  Indeed, the Administrative Record amply

3 N.b., Dr. Legates’ does not assert that anthropomorphic carbon emissions do not

contribute to climate change. Rather, he notes only that, in his opinion, the role of
anthropomorphic carbon emissions in climate change is “uncertain”. See e.g., Legates Decl. at ¶
3

Pls’ Surreply
Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW

1

2

3

documents the reasonableness of Plaintiffs’ concerns, and provides sufficient facts for this Court

to conclude with reasonable probability that each agency’s actions contribute to some increased

risk of harm to Plaintiffs’ concrete interests.

4

44.  Even if taken to be true, the “uncertainty” alleged by Dr. Legates does not defeat Plaintiffs’
standing, particularly within the context of NEPA. To the contrary, Dr. Legates emphasizes
Plaintiffs’ “reasonable concern,” Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184, that Defendants’ actions contribute to
an increased risk to their concrete interests by repeatedly conceding that Plaintiffs’ concerns are
“often cited” impacts of climate change.  See e.g., Legates Decl. at ¶¶ 36, 40. Further, NEPA
actually demands more rigorous analysis where the extent of a project’s impacts are “uncertain.”
See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(5) (impact may be significant where “the degree to which the
possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown
risks.”).

4 With respect to OPIC see Assessing Our Actions at 7, 28 (acknowledging recent studies

which conclude “that human activity is the dominant force behind the sharp global warming
trend seen in the 20th century,” and noting “there is a strong and growing scientific consensus
that these steady additions of GHGs have tipped a delicate balance and begun to impact our
climate and may be the dominant force driving recent warming trends.”); id at 6 (summary
finding that OPIC is a “contributor” to global GHG emissions and climate change, although
concluding that contribution is not significant); id. at 49 (“Climate change represents a serious
global environmental challenge. Since the dawn of the industrial age, man has been emitting
increasing quantities of heat-absorbing GHGs primarily through the combustion of fossil fuels.
As a result, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 – the most important GHG – are now at their
highest levels in more than 160,000 years and global temperatures are rising. With emissions of
CO2 and other GHGs expected to increase – especially in developing regions – current forecasts
suggest that atmospheric concentrations of CO2 could double by 2060 with a resulting global
average temperature increase of as much as 2º to 6.5º F over the next century. Such rapid
temperature increase could have potentially grave economic and environmental impacts.”).

With respect to Ex-Im Bank see Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 4 (“the information

presented … leads one to conclude that GHG concentrations have indeed risen and that there is a
reasonable likelihood that the increased concentrations of these gases will result in increased
average global temperatures during the coming decades.”); id. at 3 (noting that “[t]he direct
regional environmental impact of such a climate change could include changes in temperature
and precipitations levels, with corresponding changes to the properties and moisture content of
soil.  The global impact could include changes in weather patterns and rises in sea level.  The
changes in turn can result in major consequences to ecological systems, human health and
socioeconomic sectors such as agriculture, coastal resources, forests, energy and
transportation.”); id. at 29 (noting that “the 425 million tonnes of CO2 that is predicted to be
produced by Ex-Im Bank supported power projects by 2012 will cause Ex-Im Bank’s
contribution to global CO2 production to peak at 1.4%”) (emphasis added).

Defendants also submit new affidavits contesting Plaintiffs’ evidence on indirect or

downstream GHG emissions from OPIC and Ex-Im projects. Declaration of Thomas Schehl (Att.

A to Def. Reply); Declaration of James Mahoney (Att. B to Def. Reply).  Both Schehl and

Mahoney attack calculations of emissions prepared by Plaintiffs’ expert, Richard Heede,

asserting that Heede’s inclusion of indirect emissions is inappropriate because it is “inconsistent

with internationally recognized protocols.”  Schehl Decl. at ¶¶16-20; Mahoney Decl. at ¶¶9-12.

NEPA, however, demands consideration of the indirect effects of federal actions –

regardless of what other protocols may require.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.8(b).  Indeed, “NEPA does

not recognize any distinction between primary and secondary effects” of federal actions, and

10

therefore indirect greenhouse gas emissions must be taken into consideration.  Border Power

11

Plant Working Group v. DOE, 260 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1015 (S.D. Cal. 2003) (evaluation of

12

proposed power line on U.S./Mexico border violated NEPA because, among other things, the

13

Department of Energy failed to consider the indirect greenhouse gas emissions of a 500 MW

14

gas-turbine power plant located in Mexico that would be connected to the power line).  As

15

neither Mr. Schehl nor Mr. Mahoney offer an alternative accounting of total indirect emissions

16

resulting from Defendants’ action, Plaintiffs’ uncontroverted evidence on the indirect GHG

17

emissions from Defendants’ action must be taken as true.5  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504

18

U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (for purposes of summary judgment plaintiffs’ facts must be taken as true);

19

Alaska Wildlife Alliance v. Jensen, 108 F.3d 1065, 1068-69 (9th Cir. 1997) (same).

5 While NEPA requires consideration of indirect impacts, the agencies’ own calculations
of their direct “contribution” to climate change alone is more than adequate to support Plaintiffs’
standing, further demonstrating that the Schehl and Mahoney Declarations are immaterial. See
Pls.’ Opp’n at 17-18.

Defendants also persist in the hypothetical argument that OPIC and Ex-Im projects could

potentially go forward without OPIC or Ex-Im support. Def. Reply at 4-6.  Again, Defendants’

misstate the appropriate inquiry.  A project is considered a major federal action subject to NEPA

when it receives federal funding.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.18 (“Actions include new and continuing

activities, including projects and programs entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted,

regulated, or approved by federal agencies.”) (emphasis added).  And here, the challenged

projects did, in fact, proceed with substantial federal funding.  The hypothetical of what may

have happened is immaterial to this Court’s consideration of standing.  In any event, Defendants

do not claim that the particular projects challenged by Plaintiffs in this case would have gone

10

6
forward without their support – nor can they.

11

12

II.

Plaintiffs have Challenged Final Agency Actions.

Despite the Administrative Record’s clear support of Plaintiffs’ claims, the Defendants

13

persist in their argument that the Complaint fails to specify final agency action.  Further,

14

Defendants insist that final agency action must be determined without resort to the

15

Administration Record that memorialized the action (or inaction) at issue here.  And now

16

Defendants argue for the first time that the Record provided to Plaintiffs in 2003 may not be the

17

appropriate Record.  Def. Opp’n to Pls’ Mot. to Strike at 6, n. 7.

18

It is basic that the F.R.Civ.P. 8 “notice” pleading standard does not require the Complaint

19

to state detailed facts, but need only put Defendants on fair notice of Plaintiffs’ claim.  2 Moore’s

20

Federal Practice § 8.04[1] (3d ed. 2001).  Information on claims is not required from pleadings

6 See O’Boyle Decl. at ¶¶31-45  (no specific allegation that Chad-Cameroon Pipeline,
Cantarell Oil Field, Hamaca project, or Dezhou project would have proceeded without Ex-Im
support).  The absence of such allegations is telling, and considering the substantial percentage
of funding provided by Ex-Im for these multi-billion dollar projects, it is understandable why the
agency has not proffered such allegations.

because it is developed through disclosures and discovery, or in this case, production of the

record.  Id.; Bodine Produce, Inc. v. United Farm Workers, 494 F.2d 541, 561-62 (1974)

(complaint should be developed through discovery and other pretrial procedures).  Indeed, this

Court and the Ninth Circuit have repeatedly held that finality is determined by examination of

the Administrative Record.  Northcoast Env. Ctr v. Glickman, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22845

(N.D. Ca. 1996) (“It is not necessary to go beyond the administrative record submitted by

defendants to determine whether the POC Program constitutes final agency action.”) aff’d

Northcoast Envtl. Ctr. v. Glickman, 136 F.3d 660, 665 (9th Cir. 1998) (District Court properly

struck extra-record evidence and determined finality only on administrative record); Northwest

10

Resource Inf. Ctr. v. P.U.D. No. 2, 25 F.3d 872, 874-75 (9th Cir. 1994) (“Only where what

11

petitioner challenged was not a final agency action based upon an administrative record have we

12

found against jurisdiction in this court.”) (emphasis added).

13

Never has a Court held that the administrative record is irrelevant to determining finality.

14

Quite to the contrary, an administrative record may be supplemented – not ignored – if it is

15

insufficient to explain agency inaction.  See id.

16

Final agency action includes an agency’s “grant of money [or] assistance . . . or taking of

17

other action on the application or petition of, and beneficial to, a person.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(11).

18

Here, the Complaint alleges that Defendants have, and continue to finance fossil fuel projects

19

without first complying with NEPA.  2d Amd. Cmplt. at ¶¶ 151-211.  In addition, the Complaint

20

specifies particular financing decisions taken by Defendants.  Id.

21

The Defendants admit having taken such final action.  Answer to Pls’ 2d. Amd. Cmplt at

22

¶¶ 163, 165, 167, 171, 172, 175, 177, 179, 182, 184, 189, 190, 199 (admitting that OPIC and

23

ExIm boards have taken final decisions approving financing for particular projects that are

Civ. No. C 02 4106 JSW

anticipated to emit greenhouse gases).  Further, the Administrative Records produced are replete

with final actions that Defendants’ boards have taken to finance or otherwise assist fossil fuel

projects.  Ex-Im Record, Vol. 2, Tab 28 (detailing project, financing “amount authorized,” and

CO

2 emissions FY 2000-2003); see also Appendix I, of OPIC’s Assessing Our Actions Report

(detailing CO2 emissions from OPIC financed projects).  Defendants’ failure to apply NEPA,

whether to the individual agency actions listed in the Record, or to the “aggregate” or “portfolio”

of such projects is final agency action.  Catron County Comm’rs v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife

Service, 75 F.3d 1429, 1434 (10th Cir. 1996).  Indeed, the finality of these actions is, perhaps,

best exemplified by Defendants’ assertion of a laches defense claiming that moneys for several

10

of these projects have been disbursed and that the projects are under construction.  See Def. Mot.

11

at 28, n.18 (asserting laches defense).

12

Defendants also admit that all such actions were taken without regard to NEPA.  “As

13

Plaintiffs point out, neither agency has conducted a NEPA analysis for the projects described in

14

the Complaint or for a purported program supporting energy projects.  There could be no FONSI

15

marking the conclusion of a NEPA process that never took place.”  Def. Reply at 18.  In other

16

words, Defendants argue that their complete and continuing failure to comply with NEPA can

17

never be subject to review because it is never final.  An “alleged failure to comply with NEPA

18

constitutes ‘final agency action’ 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).”  Catron County, 75 F.3d at 1434.

19

20

III.  OPIC Is Subject To Judicial Review.

Agency actions are subject to judicial review under the APA unless review is expressly

21

precluded by statute.  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1).  Defendants continue to argue that a “conclusive

22

presumption of compliance” amounts to express preclusion.  However, when Congress intends to

Pls’ Surreply

insulate an agency from judicial review, it does so by express reference to “judicial review.”7

Pls.’ Opp’n at 41-42.

Defendants also argue that Congress intended “guaranty contracts” – language found in

section 2197(j), which does not reference other OPIC functions such as insurance, financing, and

reinsurance – to refer to all of OPIC’s “fundamental actions.”  Def. Reply at 24-25.  A plain

reading of the statute reveals the obvious flaw in this reasoning – sections 2197(i) and (k), which

bracket the provision in question, refer to guaranty contracts and insurance and reinsurance.

These are clearly distinct terms.  Defendants now introduce new legislative history that actually

supports Plaintiffs’ position.  Congress describes “investment insurance” authority as “identical

10

with the specific risk guaranty authority,” yet insurance and guarantees are treated in different

11

sections of the Report.  H. Rpt. No. 91-611, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 30-31 (1969).  While OPIC’s

12

authority over insurance and guaranty contracts may be identical, Congress clearly separated the

13

two terms, and reference to “guaranty” does not equate to a reference to “insurance.”

14

Furthermore, Defendants do not actually respond to Plaintiffs’ argument that Congress

15

specifically anticipated judicial review in the context of guaranty contracts.  Defendants state:

16

“This means only that a claimant under an OPIC contract may not benefit from the claimant’s

17

own wrongdoing.”  Def. Reply at 25.  Absent a mechanism for review, however, there would be

18

no way to enforce this policy.

19

OPIC’s treatment of NEPA is similarly flawed. The environmental review requirements

20

of the OPIC Act do not “displace” the agency’s duties under NEPA.  Defendants misread

21

Plaintiffs’ “fundamental premise.”  Def. Reply at 20-21.  OPIC must analyze environmental

7 Defendants have correctly identified an error in Plaintiffs’ opening brief.  Def. Reply at

24, n. 28.  Plaintiffs intended to cite the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which states: “A
determination or certification of the Attorney General or of the Director of the Census under this
section . . . shall not be reviewable in any court.”  42 U.S.C. § 1973b(b) (emphasis added).

impacts both at home and abroad, and in particular it must follow NEPA when its actions affect

the U.S. environment.  “[E]ach agency of the Federal Government shall comply with [NEPA]

unless existing law . . . expressly prohibits or makes compliance impossible.”  40 C.F.R. §

1500.6.  As Defendants concede, “The [OPIC] statute does not reference NEPA . . . .”  Def.

Reply at 21.  Defendants also concede that the OPIC Act relies on “terms of art from NEPA.”

Def. Mem. at 34.  Thus, the OPIC Act does not prohibit or interfere with NEPA compliance.

Defendants defeat their own argument by relying on legislative history – this

acknowledges that compliance with NEPA is not “expressly prohibited.”  The legislative history,

which explains how reference to NEPA was deleted from the OPIC Act, shows that Congress did

10

not intend to completely exempt OPIC from its duties under NEPA.  Def. Mem. at 37-40.

11

OPIC misconstrues the record. “[I]t is our understanding that [NEPA] does not and

12

should not apply to the bilateral program overseas; and that if there is a global commons

13

question, that that should be dealt with through international negotiation . . . .”  Foreign

14

Assistance Legislation for Fiscal Year 1982: Markup before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of

15

the House of Representatives, 97th Congress, 1st Sess. 187-196 (emphasis added).  This

16

discussion explicitly refers to overseas impacts and impacts on the global commons, but not

17

impacts on the U.S. environment.  Thus, even if Congress intended to exempt certain OPIC

18

activities from NEPA, it clearly did not intend to alter OPIC’s obligations to protect the domestic

19

environment.  See  Sierra Club v. Adams, 578 F.2d 389 (D.D.C. 1978) (NEPA applies to federal

20

actions that are principally overseas but that result in impacts on the U.S. environment).; Nat’l
