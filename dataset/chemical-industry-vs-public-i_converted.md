INTRODUCTION

Even before the events of September 11, 2001, the

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was
concerned that short of a comprehensive site security

plan, chemical facilities handling hazardous substances
threatened the public’s safety in case of an accident and/or
intentional criminal mischief such as an act of terrorism.

up its investigations into the operations of chemical facili-
ties.  In an internal document dated June 11, 2002, then-
EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman and the
White House Director of the Office of Homeland Security
Tom Ridge, laid out a “Rollout Strategy for Chemical
Facility Site Security” for the “week of June 10-14 or week

As outlined in the February 2000 Chemical Security
Alert, a major component of the EPA’s proposal to
reduce such threats involved deploying safer design
and replacing the hazardous substances used and/or
stored at such facilities with safer substances.1

Later in September 2000, a U.S. EPA assessment
showed that of the 15,000 facilities reviewed, 123
could threaten over a million people living near the
facility should an accident or criminal act jeopardize
the safety of the plant. According to the report, the
remaining facilities could put anywhere from a few
individuals up to hundreds of thousands at risk of
immediate death or injury.2

The EPA had good reasons to be concerned about the
operations of such facilities.

In 1984 a methyl isocyanate leak from the Union
Carbide pesticide manufacturing plant in Bhopal,
India claimed more than 8,000 lives in the immediate
aftermath and at least 12,000 more since.  Many more
were injured.  Twenty years later, thousands of sur-
vivors are suffering from respiratory ailments, cancers,
and other health problems while their children are
born with serious birth defects.

In the U.S., on April 23, 2004 a vinyl chloride leak in
Formosa’s Plastics’ Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) facility in
Illiopolis, Illinois killed five workers (four died imme-
diately and one died later of injuries sustained during
the incident), injured three others, and caused the
evacuation of a large number of residents.  The inci-
dent caused a fire that burned for days, leading to
concerns that “long-term contamination problems
may be fairly monumental.”3

These two disasters demonstrate that terrorist attacks
shouldn’t be the only source of concern when it comes
to overseeing chemical plants.  In fact, often the
plants’ operations and the substances used are the
source of terror.

Following September 11th, concerned that the pres-
ence of highly hazardous substances at chemical plants
could provide targets for terrorists, the EPA stepped

Large Flare at Sunoco Refinery 9/13/03
South and Southwest Philadelphia houses a disproportionate amount of
the city's industries, placing an unfair health burden on the over
100,000 residents of this area.
The top polluter in the city is the Sunoco refinery, which emits at least
32 different toxic chemicals totalling over 200,000 pounds of toxics
released into the air we breathe.

Redefining the Public Debate on Chemical Security

of June 17-21, 2002” including a media event in “The
White House Press Room.”4

Also spurred into action was Senator Jon Corzine (D-NJ)
who on October 31, 2001 introduced the “Chemical
Security Act of 2001” (S. 1602), requiring chemical facili-
ties to use safer available technologies to prevent cata-
strophic attacks.

But the EPA never had a chance to implement its plans
and Senator Corzine’s legislation never passed the U.S.
Congress.

Once alerted of plans that could alter their operations, the
U.S. chemical and petroleum industries began cashing in
on favors to the Bush campaign.  Since Mr. Bush took
office, legislative and regulatory efforts that would make
chemical facilities’ operations inherently safer have been
killed or gutted.  Based on reports submitted by ACC, and
on file with the Senate Office of Public Records, during
2002 and 2003 the ACC spent $4.3 million on in-house
lobbyists, advocating against any mandatory standards for
chemical plant security.

This report examines the actions of the chemical and
petroleum industry between 2001 and the time of this
writing.  Hiding behind the Bush Administration’s “War
On Terror,” the chemical industry—led by the American
Chemistry Council (ACC), and other industry groups such
as the American Petroleum Institute (API)—have lobbied
the Administration to restrict discussions on plant safety to
the adoption of voluntary, industry developed plans. These
plans are narrowly focused on installing tougher locks on
the gates and hiring more security guards to keep out
intruders, and do nothing to address the inherent hazards
associated with the use of hazardous process and large
quantities of hazardous chemicals stored on-site.

Although the industry continued to promote their volun-
tary programs at the June 27-29, 2004 “Second Annual
Chemical Security Summit” in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
the No More Bhopals Alliance believes the industry’s con-
flict of interest prevents it from changing its operations to
adequately protect the public.

To truly ensure public safety and prevent possible terror
attacks at chemical facilities, the No More Bhopals Alliance
offers the following recommendations:

• Mandate adoption of “inherently safe” materials

and processes, that would require the use of safer,
less hazardous substances starting with instances
where such alternatives are readily available;

• Promulgate federal regulations mandating

increased vulnerability assessments, site security
and inherent safety changes for hazardous facili-
ties, starting with the facilities that threaten the
most people;

• Re-route shipments of hazardous substances (eg.,
chlorine, ammonia, hydrogen fluoride, etc.) that
can be turned into weapons of mass destruction
(WMD).

• Mandate the public disclosure of “technology and
materials options analyses” requiring companies to
report the rationale behind choosing a particular
process or material over others;

• Strengthen Occupational, Safety, and Health

Administration (OSHA) laws covering chemically
reactive substances and reactive hazards as request-
ed by labor organizations;

• Strengthen and expand the public’s right-to-know
(eg. Toxic Release Inventory/TRI) by mandating
the preparation and disclosure of toxics use reduc-
tion plans;

• Increase the number of chemicals and industries

covered under TRI reporting;

• Strengthen the liability regime against polluters
and facilities that fail to take adequate steps to
protect workers, communities and the environ-
ment.

• Conduct and publish body burden and epidemio-
logical studies on the general population with par-
ticular emphasis on vulnerable communities,
including pollution-impacted communities,
minorities, children, elderly, women and workers;
and,

• Operationalize the Precautionary Principle in fed-

eral and state laws.

Chemical Industry vs. Public Interest:

HIDING BEHIND THE BUSH

“We’re looking all over Iraq for biological and chemical weapons. We don’t have to look for ‘em very hard, they’re
right here, right here in our backyards.”—Senator Jon Corzine D-NJ 5

Follow The Money

Since September 11th, the Bush Administration has

advised the public to be on the look out for strange
faces and behaviors in public places while it looks for

Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) in Iraq.

All the while, unaided by terrorists and going about busi-
ness as usual, chemical companies have injected terror
agents into the general U.S. population in the form of a
host of synthetic chemicals.  Many, known to be highly
toxic, are at levels above permitted thresholds established
by federal health and environment agencies.

As early as September 2000 report, the EPA identified a
number of chemical facilities using hazardous substances
that could be used as WMDs to intentionally threaten up
to millions of people.6 [See Table 1]

However, legislative and regulatory efforts to ensure inher-
ent safety at chemical facilities have expectantly met with
resistance from the industry aided by its allies in the Bush
Administration.  In fact, it’s clear that the industry knew it
had an ally in the Bush Administration even before the rest
of the world saw the events unfold on September 11th and
beyond.

Since before the 2000 presidential elections, an elite group
of donors to the Bush 2000 campaign known as the Bush
Pioneers and Rangers have positioned themselves for favors
from Mr. Bush.   Pioneers and Rangers are contributors
who agree to raise $100,000 or more for the Bush
Campaign.7

Chemical industry officials are prominent amongst Bush
Pioneers and Rangers—at least seven are among this list of

special donors.8 One Pioneer,
Fredrick Webber, was the chair
of ACC from 1992 to 2002,
when he retired.  Following the
2000 elections, Bush appointed
Mr. Webber to the Labor
Department Transition Team.

Mr. Webber, along with two
other Bush Pioneers,
Department of Commerce
(DOC) Secretary Don Evans
and U.S. Ambassador to the
European Union (EU) Rockwell
Schnabel, played a key role in
undermining legislative efforts
in Europe requiring mandatory
testing of chemicals for health
and environmental risks before
they can be used in the region.
A 2002 internal DOC commu-
niqué urged the U.S. chemical
industry to “develop an official
position and strategy as soon as
possible to assist in influencing
the EU’s draft.” 9

With Aid From Bush, Industry Thwarts
Chemical Security Legislation
The chemical industry’s war against chemical security
began in full earnest after the introduction of the
“Chemical Security Act of 2001” (S. 1602) by Senator Jon
Corzine on October 31, 2001.  The Corzine bill called for
legislation requiring hazardous chemical-using companies
to assess and improve their security, even while deploying
safer alternatives to risky processes and the storage, use and
manufacture of hazardous chemicals.

After being unanimously adopted by the 20-member Senate
Environment Committee on July 25, 2002, Corzine’s origi-
nal bill, S. 1602, was subsequently challenged by seven
members of the committee. In a letter
dated September 10, 2002, the dissenting
senators stated they may have to offer
additional amendments to the Homeland
Security Act of 2002 to “…address con-
cerns… that have arisen from scores of
stakeholders upon thoughtful considera-
tion of this legislation.”10

According to information gathered by
Greenpeace from the Center for
Responsive Politics, political action com-
mittee contributions from the chemical
industry to the seven dissenters totaled
$992,346. In comparison, the remaining thirteen senators
on the committee received a total of only $756,221.11

Despite unanimous approval in the Senate Environment
Committee, the U.S. Senate passed the Homeland Security
Department Act on November 19, 2002, but failed to
include S. 1602 or any other chemical security provision
while adding new loopholes for polluters that would allow
them to evade enforcement and protect them from public
disclosure of violations.

Even though they shunned the Corzine led initiatives, fol-
lowing the 2002 elections with a newly elected Republican
controlled Congress, the industry and the White House
suddenly warmed up to legislation.  But none of the meas-
ures proposed by the Democrats seemed to fit the bill.

On January 7, 2003 Senator Daschle (D-SD) and 15 other
senators introduced S. 6, a broad homeland security bill,
including the July 25, 2002 Senate Environment
Committee compromise bill on chemical security.  Despite
another attempt by Senator Corzine to introduce a chemical
security bill (S. 157) on January 14, 2003 identical to the
previous one as well as a companion bill in the U.S. House of
Representatives filed on April 23, 2003 by Representative
Frank Pallone (D-NJ), the bills were not included in the final
versions of the Homeland Security Bill.

Redefining the Public Debate on Chemical Security

On May 5, 2003 Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), one of the
seven republicans who suddenly backed out of supporting
the Corzine Bill, introduced the Chemical Facilities
Security Act of 2003 (S. 994) which excluded any roles for
the EPA and endorsed voluntary industry programs.

Finally, on October 23, 2003 the Senate Environment
Committee passed the flawed Inhofe bill (S. 994).  The bill
has no enforceable provision to prevent catastrophic attacks
and merely rubber stamps voluntary industry programs.

Beating EPA’s Plans To Implement Chemical
Security

...the White House had
more to do with the
defeat of the Corzine
legislative attempts as
well as the EPA’s efforts
to institute chemical
security measures.

An internal EPA document dated June 11,
2002 showed that concurrent to the legisla-
tive efforts ongoing at the time, the EPA
and the White House Office of Homeland
Security were collaborating on chemical
security issues. This attempt by the EPA to
take control of chemical security in the
post-September 11th climate threatened the
industry’s current operations.  As stated ear-
lier in this report, the strategy outlined in
the June 11, 2002 EPA document includes
design changes that would require using
safer chemicals when available.12

Although the EPA had indicated it might
seek legislation to enforce its chemical security mandates,
in the accompanying “Questions and Answers” sheet to the
June 11 document, then-EPA Administrator Christine
Todd Whitman states the “EPA is not seeking legislation
on chemical security at this time.”  Instead, the EPA was
going to use  “…existing authority under the Clean Air
Act, we believe that the guidance and regulation I have
announced today are the quickest paths to improving
chemical facility security...  If we later find that there are
legislative gaps, then we will consider seeking legislation.”

EPA’s attempts to introduce legislation expanding its
authority under the Clean Air Act’s Section 112 (r)13 to
include chemical security against criminal attacks were also
killed by industry lobby groups.

In addition, instead of adopting its original strategy, the
EPA released yet another “Strategic Plan for Homeland
Security” in October 2002.  The new strategy contains no
proposal for making the plants inherently safer.

White House To The Rescue
A paper trail discovered by Greenpeace, reveals the White
House had a lot to do with the defeat of the Corzine leg-
islative attempts as well as the EPA’s efforts to institute
chemical security measures.

Chemical Industry vs. Public Interest:

In a letter written to James Connaughton, head of White
House Council on Environmental Quality and former lob-
byist for the power companies, American Petroleum
Institute’s (API) Red Cavaney suggests the EPA “has nei-
ther experience nor resources and questionable legal
authority to address security.”  Instead, Cavaney proposed
that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) be
vested with this responsibility.14 DHS has no history, expe-
rience or knowledge of managing chemical facilities nor
does it seem to harbor any inclinations to regulate them.

Cavaney’s language mirrors the line taken by the chemical
industry. In September 2002, Michael Graff, president of
Polymers Americas (a division of ACC member BP
Amoco), wrote to the President Bush’s Senior Advisor Karl
Rove thanking him for “. . .meeting with my American
Chemistry Council colleagues and I (sic). . .to share our
concerns regarding S. 1602, the Corzine-Jeffords Bill.”15
Graff, too, recommended that DHS be appointed to
address chemical security issues by allowing ACC to pro-
vide the framework for implementation of the depart-
ment’s directives.

In response, Mr. Rove wrote to Mr. Graff acknowledging
his letter and stating  “We [at the White House] have a
similar set of concerns about its [Corzine-Jeffords Bill]
positions.”16

In his December 2003 Directive on Homeland Security,
President Bush limited the EPA’s chemical security role to
“drinking water and water treatment systems.”17 In a legally

questionable move, this shifted all responsibility for the
nearly 15,000 chemical plants from the EPA to the DHS.

Workers Be Damned
The Bush and ACC team didn’t stop at the EPA or the
U.S. Congress.

After he took office, Mr. Bush resolved a long-standing
issue for the ACC. In an October 1997 presentation to
OSHA, four industry trade organizations, including the
Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA now renamed
ACC) and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers
Association (SOCMA) jointly urged OSHA “not to expand
the Process Safety Management (PSM) rule in an attempt
to address the very difficult issue of reactive hazards.”18 The
PSM rule was aimed at enhancing occupational safety.

Finally, in 2002 with help from the White House, the
industry got its wish. Ironically, on December 3, 2002—
the 18th anniversary of the Union Carbide disaster in
Bhopal—a note in the Federal Register revealed the chemi-
cals initiative was being dropped because of “resource con-
straints and other problems.” By February 2003, OSHA’s
budget was slashed by $7.9 million and its workforce
reduced by 83 jobs, according to the Center for Public
Integrity’s report.

Later, the public interest group OMB Watch, found that
the chemicals initiative was part of a non-public industry
“hit list” of 57 regulations comprising items that the indus-
try considered too burdensome.

DRIVING DANGEROUSLY
Twenty years after a runaway reaction in Union

Carbide’s pesticide factory in Bhopal, India, killed
more than 8,000 people in the immediate after-
math, chemical accidents in U.S. industries continue to
occur with frightening regularity.

them.”22 Shrapnel from First Chemical’s explosion narrowly
missed chemical storage tanks at a neighboring Chevron
refinery. The CSB investigation found the company had
not properly evaluated hazards, although the company
claimed to have been following SOCMA’s voluntary safety
policies.

Between January 2003 and April 2004, at least 10 inci-
dents serious enough to trigger root cause investigations by
the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) have been reported.
These industrial accidents, including one at ACC member
company Honeywell, have claimed the lives of 20 workers,
injured more than 230, and caused the evacuation of at
least 2,000 people.19

Accidents at ACC member facilities run
counter to ACC’s claims that its
Responsible Care program actively assesses
and minimizes hazards.

CSB investigation of an accident on
March 13, 2001 at ACC member BP
Amoco Polymers plant in Augusta,
Georgia implicates the company as having
been negligent. The accident killed three
workers. The CSB’s notes on the con-
tributing and root causes of the disaster
are revealing. Most notably, the board
observes that:

Job Security = Chemical Security
Responding to a 1994 survey, the Industrial Safety and
Hygiene News magazine found three-quarters of the respon-
dents—mostly industry personnel—said business competi-
tion and downsizing is forcing them to cut
safety spending.  Nearly 80 percent
believed accidents are more likely as
employees work longer hours, handle new
assignments and fear for their jobs.27

A March 2003 GAO report “Voluntary
Initiatives are Under Way at Chemical
Facilities but the Extent of Security
Preparedness is Unknown” cites industry
officials to conclude that “...chemical com-
panies must weigh the cost of implement-
ing countermeasures against the perceived
reduction in risk.”

Accidents at ACC mem-

ber facilities run counter

to ACC’s claims that its

Responsible Care pro-

gram actively assesses

and minimizes hazards.

• Incidents and near misses tended to be treated as isolat-
ed events. Management did not have a review system to
detect trends and patterns among incidents.

• Neither  Amoco’s  R&D  department  nor  the  process
design  department  had  a  systematic  procedure  specifi-
cally for identifying and controlling hazards from unin-
tended or uncontrolled chemical reactions.20

Working with a compilation of chemical accidents report-
ed to the National Response Center, U.S. PIRG pegged the
total number of accidents at facilities owned by ACC
member companies at 25,188 between 1990 and 2003.
Nearly 33 percent of all accidents at ACC facilities
occurred in factories owned by industry leaders BP, Dow
and DuPont.21

Following another CSB investigation into an October
2002 explosion at First Chemical Corp in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, a CSB member said: “We are very fortunate
that shrapnel from the tower did not cause a greater chem-
ical release or a more damaging fire. This accident under-
scores once again the vital importance of properly manag-
ing dangerous reactive chemicals and the processes that use

The Conference Board reports “The per-
ceived need to upgrade corporate security has clashed with
the perceived need to control expenses until the economy
recovers.”28

Workers are often the first victims when safety is compro-
mised to cut costs.

The most significant among the unlearned lessons from
the Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal is the important role
of workers. It is undisputed that Union Carbide systemati-
cally ignored workers’ warnings about plant safety and even
fired workers that raised such issues. During the cost-cut-
ting drive that pre-ceded the disaster, Union Carbide laid
off safety personnel and other workers, reduced safety
training and cut back expenditure on safety systems.
“Maintenance personnel [at the fateful Methyl Isocyanate
unit] were cut from six to two. In 1983, the fire and rescue
squad was filled with unqualified persons and later
changed to an emergency squad. One month prior to the
disaster, the vital post of maintenance supervisor was elimi-
nated from the night shift.”29 The rest of what happened at
midnight on December 2-3, 1984, is history.

As the CSB’s Poje observes, “The analogy of Bhopal still

7

Chemical Industry vs. Public Interest:

resonates here because of the endangerment
due to downsizing.”30

Drawing upon limited data relating to the peri-
od 1992-2001, when 91 deaths of contract
employees were known to have resulted from
explosions or asphyxiation in industrial plants,
the Center to Protect Workers’ Rights found
many instances of injury/death were caused by
the lack of workers’ knowledge of the presence
of explosive material, or the lack of adequate
precaution.31 The report recommends “the use
of outside contractors working in industrial
plants should be reviewed to determine unique
safety risks and needs for this group.”

Lacking Hazard Prevention
The CSB’s second observation on reactive haz-
ards and unintended or uncontrolled chemical
reactions raises the far more sinister specter of a
Bhopal-like disaster recurring. Limited data
analyzed by the board “include 167 serious inci-
dents in the United States involving uncon-
trolled chemical reactivity from January 1980 to
June 2001. Forty of these incidents resulted in a
total 108 fatalities.”32 Seventy percent of the
incidents investigated involved the chemical
manufacturing industry.

Reactive chemicals can become dangerously
unstable when they inadvertently or improperly
come in contact with other chemicals, water or
air, or when they’re subjected to heat or pres-
sure. The resulting instability can cause fairly
rapid and large runaway reactions that could
breach containment measures, as happened in
Bhopal or more recently and less catastrophical-
ly in BP Amoco’s Georgia plant.

According to the EPA, in the early to mid-1980s
at least 17 accidents in the U.S. had potential
consequences that could have been more severe
than Bhopal, given the toxicity and volume of
release. Mass fatalities were averted only due to
circumstances like wind conditions and plant
location.33

“The current regulatory regime to deal with
reactive hazards and incidents is not adequate,”
says CSB’s Gerald Poje. In October 2002, the
CSB submitted its recommendations to the gov-
ernment, industry and labor unions on address-
ing vulnerabilities in sectors using or storing
reactive chemicals. As is the case with most
chemical facility hazards, reactive hazards place
workers in the first line of fire.

8

Rolling Back Controls
The ACC—previously called the Chemical Manufacturers’
Association (CMA)—and their membership have been influ-
encing policy and working to undermine environmental
laws and regulations for years. Here are some examples:
(cid:1) The public interest group Earthjustice warned that “An
illegal chemical industry advisory committee is playing
an inside role in weakening endangered species protec-
tions from harmful pesticides.”23 The FIFRA endangered
species task force of the EPA—comprising 14 agrochem-
ical companies—set up in 2000 to develop data dis-
closing the locations of endangered species, “has shifted
its efforts away from generating data to advocating that
EPA circumvent the Endangered Species Act for pesticide
uses that harm federally protected species.” Six out of
14 industry members of the taskforce are ACC compa-
nies or their subsidiaries.

24

(cid:1) In a 1999 report,25 U.S. PIRG and others outlined the

role of the CMA in lobbying Congress—with occasional
success—to:

• Remove 90 percent of TRI chemicals;

• Cut EPA’s 1996 and 1997 budget, including a

proposal to cut $1.5 million from funds designated
to expand the TRI;

• Block EPA’s authority to collect improved data under

TRI; and,

• Prevent EPA from prosecuting polluters who have

hidden environmental violations in secret self-audits
authorized by state law.

(cid:1) The same U.S. PIRG report documents a paper trail

showing how the CMA tried to directly block EPA efforts
to improve Right-to-Know.

(cid:1) In 1999, giving in to pressure from ACC and the

American Petroleum Institute, Congress limited public
access to Risk Management Plans (RMP) that companies
are required to file as a measure leading to accident
prevention under EPA’s Clean Air Act. After September
11th, information was further restricted purportedly to
prevent access to sensitive data by terrorists and other
criminal agents even though RMPs contain “no data on
tank or process location, site security or other similar
information.”

26

Redefining the Public Debate on Chemical Security

In April 2002, the Center for Public Integrity released a
report of its investigations that found the Bush
Administration had quietly shelved an OSHA proposal to
improve workplace and chemical safety. The proposal was
prompted by a petition by several industrial and firefighters’
unions. The Clinton-era proposal, which aimed to expand
the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard that forms
the core of OSHA’s accident-prevention regulations, was
opposed by Bush campaign donors.

Poisoning the Vulnerable
In the year 2000, facilities required to report emissions of
toxic pollutants under the Toxics Release Inventory regula-
tion released more than:

• 100 million pounds of carcinogens

• 138 million pounds of chemicals that could cause devel-

opmental problems

• 50 million pounds of chemicals that could cause repro-

ductive disorders

• 1 billion pounds of known/suspected neurotoxicants

• 1.7 billion pounds of respiratory toxicants

• 7000 grams of dioxins

According to the 2000 TRI, of the 7 kilograms of dioxins
—the most dangerous chemical known to science—report-
ed by all industries more than 2 kilograms were released by
ACC members Dow Chemical and Solutia Inc., with Dow
emitting about 1.4 kilograms.

People living near or working at incinerators, Superfund
sites, and chemical and other industrial facilities and even
the general population are forced to pay for
industrial pollution by absorbing associated
health care costs and wages lost due to ill-
health.

Disease Control37 analyzed a nationally representative
group of 2,500 people for 116 synthetic toxicants. The
study found adolescents and adult women were most dis-
proportionately exposed to phthalates, a chemical used in
cosmetics, children’s toys and soft PVC items like shower
curtains. Mexican Americans in the sample had higher lev-
els than others of DDE, a breakdown product of DDT;
African American women of child-bearing age carried the
highest levels of the neurotoxin mercury in their bodies.
Most worryingly, children had higher body burdens than
adults for some of the most toxic chemicals including
organophosphate pesticides such as chlorpyriphos, lead
and tobacco smoke.

An authoritative 1997 study found that African American,
and Hispanic residential areas are more likely to be
exposed to higher levels of environmental risk associated
with TRI facilities and TRI pollutant loads.38 Often these
communities are already overburdened, poor, and political-
ly under-represented.

Chlorpyriphos, marketed under the Dow Chemical brand-
name, Dursban, is dangerous, particularly to children.
Using a Pesticide Trespass Index to estimate the extent to
which individual manufacturers of pesticides are responsi-
ble for the body burdens, Pesticide Action Network North
America analyzed the CDC data to find that 80 percent of
the US population’s chlorpyriphos body burden is the
responsibility of the Dow Chemical Corporation.39

The ACC’s response to the CDC study twists the con-
demning data into a tribute to the chemical industry. “It is
remarkable that modern chemistry allows CDC scientists
to measure incredibly small amounts of certain nutrients,
natural food chemicals and modern chemicals in our bod-
ies,” says the ACC.40

A study by Dr. Philip Landrigan of Mt. Sinai
Medical Center et al estimates the total annual
costs of environmental pollutants and disease
in American children at $54.9 billion, or 2.8
percent of total US health care costs.34 The
authors report that, “This estimate is likely low
because it considers only four categories of ill-
ness, incorporates conservative assumptions,
ignores costs of pain and suffering...” 35

Between three and four million children and
adolescents in the United States live within
a mile of a federally designated Superfund
hazardous waste disposal site and are at risk
of exposure to chemical toxicants released
from these sites.36

Chemical Industry vs. Public Interest:

DO YOU LIVE IN BHOPAL?
A CHECKLIST FOR COMMUNITIES AND WORKERS

The December 1984 Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, India, is alluded to, even by industry offi-
cials. The facts of the disaster are sobering. Here’s a checklist of why things went so horribly wrong
in Bhopal before, during and after the disaster. To get an idea of your vulnerability, go down the
checklist to see how many of the items resonate with the context of your neighborhood facility or the
factory you work in.

❏ Does the plant use inherently unsafe technology?
❏ Are large quantities of extremely hazardous substances used

or stored onsite?

❏ Is the facility located in a densely populated community?
❏ Are community members predominantly low-income and

disadvantaged?

❏ Is the factory run by a powerful corporation with the lobby muscle of the industry behind it?
❏ Does the company practice a management pattern that ignores worker and community concerns

about frequent incidents and injuries?

❏ Is the company actively engaged in downsizing and cost-cutting?
❏ Are your local, state and federal Governments beholden to Corporations?
❏ Does your legal system have a weak liability regime to hold

offenders accountable?

❏ Does your regulatory system lack adequate public disclosure standards for information relat-

ed to chemicals stored, hazards, disaster potential and disaster management?

❏ Can the company refuse to disclose

unpublished chemical-specific information
relating to issues such as toxicity under
trade secret laws?

If your answer is “Yes” to all or
most of these questions, then
you Live in Bhopal.
