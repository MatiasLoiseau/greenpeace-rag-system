Greenpeace Cover Letter to the EQI Mercury Report

INTRODUCTION
A Statistical Analysis of Factors Associated with Elevated Hair Mercury Levels in the U.S. Population: An
Interim Progress Report, produced by the Environmental Quality Institute (EQI) at the University of North
Carolina at Asheville (UNCA), presents the current results for an ongoing survey of mercury levels in hair
in volunteers from across the United States.

As of the release of this progress report, 1,449 hair samples have been analyzed for mercury content.  Of
those, 597 represent women of childbearing age (16-49 years of age). Within that group, 126 women –
approximately 21 percent - had mercury levels that were above the reference level for mercury in hair,
which correlates to the reference dose designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for
children, women of childbearing age and pregnant women.  Given that the age structure of this sub-group
in the current study might differ from that in the general population, this percentage may not hold for
women of childbearing age across the U.S. population as a whole.  In addition to the samples that have
already been analyzed, another 1,500 home sampling kits have been purchased, and it is expected that
several thousand more will be collected and analyzed for a final report to be released in early 2005.

PURPOSE
Greenpeace launched the Mercury Hair Sampling Project in order to draw attention to the global problem
of mercury pollution, a major source of which is mercury emitted from coal-fired power plants, and to
inform participants about clean energy alternatives that would reduce mercury emissions.  Greenpeace
recognizes that coal-fired power plants are not the only source of mercury pollution.  Nevertheless, they are
a substantial contributor to global pollution and represent one industry sector, namely power plants, that
could contribute significantly to reducing mercury emissions by phasing out the burning of coal and
introducing clean energy alternatives such as wind and solar power.1

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) from 1999 and 2000 assessed hair mercury levels in 838 children 1 to 5 years of age, and 1,726
women 16 to 49 years of age.2  Based on these results, similar findings of mercury blood levels, and the
number of births in 2000, it has been estimated that between 300,000 and 630,000 newborns each year in
the United States may be exposed in utero to concentrations of methyl mercury above the EPA limit that is
considered to be without increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental effects.3  While the NHANES study
selected a representative sample of the United States population, the Greenpeace project does not limit
participation to selected individuals, and therefore the results of the two studies cannot yet be statistically
compared.  The Greenpeace project aims to test a larger study group of volunteers regardless of gender, age
or ethnicity.  This will ultimately provide new data about mercury levels in population sub-groups other
than those studied by NHANES.  In addition to providing new data, Greenpeace is also providing access to
an analytical service at cost, which is not routinely available on demand through government sources.

Additionally, Greenpeace is providing information to participants about the effects of mercury pollution
and the potential long-term solutions.

COLLABORATION
Greenpeace has provided the Environmental Quality Institute at the University of North Carolina at
Asheville with a grant to conduct a research study in order to assess mercury hair levels in volunteers from
the United States.4  Through this agreement, EQI is responsible for the design, execution, analysis, quality
control and reporting of results.  Therefore, all technical questions regarding the design and execution of
sampling and analysis should be directed to EQI (http://www.unca.edu/eqi/).  Through this agreement with
EQI, Greenpeace has the right to use the project and its results to inform the public about mercury pollution
and potential solutions.  However, EQI owns the data collected and can use it for future research projects
and publications not sanctioned by Greenpeace.

PARTICIPANTS
The participants in this ongoing study are volunteers who have chosen to be involved either by providing a
hair sample at a Greenpeace event, at a participating hair salon, to a partner organization or by ordering the
test by mail for a nominal fee (which covers sample analysis and essential associated costs only).  Because
the majority of participants paid a fee to be involved, Greenpeace and EQI did not limit participation in the
project to people of a specific age, gender, ethnicity or rate of fish consumption and accepted all samples
that appeared to have been properly collected and had all paperwork completed.  Further information about
participant self-selection and potential bias is addressed in the EQI report.

EPA AND FDA REFERENCE DOSE
The reference dose (RfD) is a numerical estimate of a daily oral exposure to the human population,
including sensitive subgroups such as children, which is not likely to cause harmful effects during a
lifetime. RfDs are generally used for health effects that are thought to have a threshold or low dose limit for
producing effects. The EPA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have jointly determined a reference
dose for methyl mercury of 0.1 µg/kg body weight/day, which corresponds to a hair mercury level of one
µg/g (one microgram of mercury per gram of hair) for women of childbearing age, pregnant women,
nursing women and young children.5 Because this reference dose was not set for the general population, it
cannot be applied to people who do not fit into these specific categories.  There are no current health
guidelines or government reference doses for men or elderly women.  Health care professionals and
scientists are concerned that chronic exposure to methyl mercury may also produce cardiovascular effects
that would adversely affect any member of the population, however studies have not yet determined a
reference dose for these effects.6

SOURCES OF MERCURY
Emissions from coal-fired power plants account for the largest single source of industrial mercury
emissions in the United States – approximately 41 percent.7  However, mercury is a global problem with
sources of pollution all over the world.  Coal is also burned heavily in Europe and Asia as a fuel for power

plants.  The U.S. consumption of coal is approximately 20 percent of the global total.8  Mercury is also
released from a wide range of other sources, including waste incinerators and certain chemical industries,
such as the production of chlorine.9  In addition, there are natural sources of mercury from volcanic
eruptions and erosion of rocks and soils.

The major source of mercury exposure for people is consumption of fish that contain mercury.  Under
certain conditions, elemental mercury is converted to a more biologically toxic form, methyl mercury, by
bacteria in soils and water.  Fish concentrate this methyl mercury contamination as it is carried up the food
chain from bacteria to small organisms and on to smaller fish.   Large predatory fish consequently carry the
heaviest mercury contamination.  At the same time, many fresh water fish in the United States are also
contaminated with mercury. It is difficult to identify the specific source of mercury contamination in any
individual person or fish. It has been shown, however, that reduction of point source mercury emissions
limits not only the global environmental impact of mercury pollution but can also reduce the potential
impact of elevated localized levels of mercury (“hot spots”) near the point source.10  It is therefore possible
to begin to tackle major ongoing mercury emissions at the source, including reducing mercury emissions
from power plants by switching from coal to clean energy alternatives.

HEALTH IMPLICATIONS
Organic compounds of mercury such as methyl mercury are considered the most toxic forms of the
element. Exposures to very small amounts of these compounds over time can result in accumulation in
body tissues and health effects including neurological damage.  For fetuses, infants and children the
primary health effects of mercury are on neurological development. Even the levels of mercury exposure
which result from a mother's consumption of methyl mercury from dietary sources can adversely affect the
brain and nervous system of a developing fetus. Impacts on memory, attention, language and other skills
have been found in children exposed to moderate levels in the womb.11

HAIR SAMPLING
Hair sampling is one effective method of monitoring mercury in one’s body.  However, hair provides only
a snapshot of mercury consumption and contamination in the recent past. As one’s hair grows out, it carries
some of the mercury in the bloodstream acting like an indicator strip of ongoing blood levels.   Blood
analysis is a more direct method to determine mercury levels in the body, though hair analysis - when
conducted to strict protocols - is widely accepted for large-scale studies and as a valuable indicator of
exposure over time.  However, hair mercury levels cannot be used to determine if a person has chronic
mercury poisoning. Further testing and medical analysis is needed for such assessment.

Hair sampling was chosen for this project because of the ease and relatively low cost of sampling many
people, and to be as consistent as possible with the analytical methods used by the Center for Disease
Control in the NHANES study detailed above.

BREAST-FEEDING
Although methyl mercury can pass from mother to child when breast-feeding, Greenpeace believes that the
benefits of breast-feeding outweigh the risks of general population exposure to mercury.  If you have
reason to believe that you have been exposed to unusually high levels of mercury, please consult a doctor.
Recent studies have shown that mercury contamination in umbilical cord blood is even higher than the
mother’s general blood system suggesting higher risk to unborn children than may previously have been
estimated.12

FISH CONSUMPTION
Fish is a food source that supplies the body with Omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce
risks of cardiovascular disease and other heart problems.  There are other sources of these fatty acids such
as dark green vegetables like broccoli, spinach, lettuce and kale, and walnuts, flax seed, beans (mung, navy,
pinto and kidney), peas, citrus, melons and cherries.  The EPA and FDA issued a joint fish advisory for
small children, pregnant women, women who may become pregnant and nursing mothers.13  A number of
scientists have expressed concern about this advisory.14  The EPA and FDA considered multiple advisory
scenarios and opted to recommend fish consumption advice that may allow up to 5.9% of women of
childbearing age, pregnant and nursing women, and small children to have mercury levels over the
reference limit.15  Greenpeace makes the following fish consumption recommendations based on fish tissue
analyses done by the FDA, and advisories from the EPA and analysis from the Natural Resources Defense
Council, and the Mercury Policy Project.

1.  Do not eat grouper, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish because

they contain high levels of mercury.

2.  Avoid (eat less than three 6 oz. servings a month) bluefish, croaker, halibut, lobster

(American/Maine), rockfish, sea bass, sea trout (weakfish), canned albacore tuna, and tuna steaks.

3.  Eat sparingly (less than six 6 oz. servings a month) carp, cod, dungeness crab, blue crab, snow
crab, mahi mahi, monkfish, freshwater perch, skate, snapper, and chunk light canned tuna.

4.  Eat in moderation farmed abalone, anchovies, butterfish, calamari (squid), catfish, farmed caviar,

clams, king crab, crawfish/crayfish, flounder, haddock, hake, herring, lobster (spiny/rock),
Atlantic mackerel, farmed mussels, oysters, ocean perch, pollock, wild salmon, sardines, scallops,
shad, shrimp, sole, farmed sturgeon, tilapia, trout, and whitefish.

5.  Check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local lakes,

rivers and coastal areas. If no advice is available, eat up to six ounces (one average meal) per week
of fish you catch from local waters, but do not consume any other fish during that week.

6.  Fishing and farming practices of selected species have raised environmental concerns.  Refer to the
