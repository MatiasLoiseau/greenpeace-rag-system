The EU's new labelling rules for GM food & feed

April 2004

Introduction

The European Union is implementing new labelling and traceability  legislation for genetically
modified food, feed and ingredients, which will be the strictest world-wide. These new rules, which
apply to the worlds largest single market, will have major repercussions on the future market of all
genetically modified crops, vegetables, fruits and food and feed products derived from GMOs.

The two major changes to the previous labelling provisions, which will affect more than 90 percent of
all GM imports to the European Union, are

1)  The requirement to label genetically modified feed (so far labelling only applied to food)

2)  The requirement all products derived from GM ingredients, irrespective whether they can be

detected in the final product or not (so far labelling was only required where the DNA or protein
of the GMO could be detected in the final product)

After years of public debate of the issue, European consumers in their large majority continue to have
an adverse attitude to GMOs in food and the vast majority of retail-chains and food producers have a
non-GM policy or at least avoid any GM labelling. With the new extension of labelling requirements
the European market will be further closed to GM food imports. This not only applies to imports of
bulk commodities such as soya and maize, but also to all processed food and food ingredients
imported to the European Union.

40.000 ton freighters of soybean and maize will be equally affected as toppings on frozen pizzas,
chocolate bars, canned tuna or sardines in oil, soft drinks containing glucose sweeteners, and all
processed food containing emulsifiers (lecithin) or starch. Countries which export their goods to the
European market will also be directly affected by the new labelling rules and may re-consider their
import policies on GM commodities including oil, starch and corn derived sweeteners.

Also the European feed market, which is the largest in the world, is increasingly demanding non-GM
supplies. While labelling of animal products will not be mandatory major European meat, milk and
egg producers and retailers start to guarantee non-GM fed quality on a voluntary base. As GM
labelling of all feed imports and preparations becomes mandatory, the differentiation of the feed
market will accelerate.

These market restrictions are effective for end products from 18 April 2004. Around the same time the
present EU moratorium on the formal approval of new GMOs, which is being challenged by the USA
at the World Trade Organisations dispute settlement body, may be lifted - leaving the US case at the
WTO idle, but European markets even more tightly closed to GM imports.

The EU's new labelling rules for GM food & feed

April 2004

New labelling and traceability rules within the EU
The European Union's new Regulation on genetically modified (GM) food and feed1 together with the
regulation on traceability2 were finally adopted on July 2nd 2003 by the European Parliament and
entered into force in October 2003. From the day they are applicable on 18 April 2004, hese
regulations will substantially change the rules and practicalities of labelling genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) in products for human consumption and animal feed. This first comprehensive
labelling regime also set global standards as they apply to the largest single market world-wide. The
major changes are:

1.  All products containing or consisting of or derived from an ingredient, which
contains more than 0,9% of GMO must be labelled "this product contains
genetically modified organisms" or "this product is produced from genetically
modified organisms".
Additional labelling may be required if the nutritional properties of the product are
different from its natural counterparts or where the genetic modification may give
raise to ethical or religious concerns.

2.  Labelling is also required where the specific DNA or protein of the GMO can no

longer be identified in the final product.

3.  GMO in animal feed and additives will also have to be labelled.

Food and feed processors, trade and retailers have already begun to implement the new regulations and
require their suppliers to comply with their subsequent private quality and traceability standards and
certification schemes. This may also result in global certification standards and trade specifications for
non-GMO commodities and other agricultural products, especially regarding maize, soya, rape seed
(canola) and eventually wheat, should GM wheat varieties ever be commercialised in the USA,
Canada or other countries.

New threshold: 0,9 % of any ingredient

The maximum threshold for GM contamination ("adventitious or technically unavoidable presence"),
which is exempted from labelling requirements, has been lowered from 1% to 0,9%. This percentage
refers to each individual ingredient in a product, e.g. 0,9% GM in the lecithin used in a chocolate bar
triggers labelling of the whole bar, which itself may only contain 0,5% lecithin3 It is also important to
note that this level only applies if the operator can prove that he has taken all appropriate steps to
avoid such contamination.4

The 0,9 % threshold only applies to GMOs which are approved under the Food and Feed Regulation
and in accordance with Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.5 A
three year transitional exemption is made for a few GMOs, which are not approved but have benefited
from a favourable opinion of the EU Scientific Committee(s) before this regulation entered into force.
Such GMOs may be accidentally present up to 0,5%.

Labelling of oil, starch, sugar etc.

Labelling of genetically modified food and feed shall also be required for products in which the DNA
or specific protein of the GMO can no longer be detected, but which are produced from GMOs.6 A
distinction is made between products which are produced from GM materials and have to be labelled,
and products which are produced with GMOs (e.g. enzymes, vitamins, GM processing aids and also
products from animals fed with GMOs) and do not require labelling under this regulation.7

3

The EU's new labelling rules for GM food & feed

April 2004

Products affected by this new definition, which did not have to be labelled before, include starch, oil,
sugar, glucose and alcohol.

An estimated 90% of GM imports to the European Union are used as animal feed
and for starch or oil production. These products now require, for the first time,
labelling as genetically modified food or feed.

What GMOs?

A total number of 18 GMOs were approved under Directive 90/220, (which has now been replaced by
Directive 2001/18) prior to the establishment of a de facto moratorium for approvals of GMO
commercialisation in 1998. These include four maize lines, Roundup Ready soybeans (not for planting
but only for consumption) and three oilseed rape lines. However, in many cases approved varieties
have later been banned in individual member states.9 For others the final act of approval by the
member state has been withheld. These approvals need to be re-evaluated under the new Directive
over a transition period.

At present 24 new applications for the placing on the market of GMOs are pending (some for as long
as six years). An updated list of all pending approvals is provided by the EU Joint Research Centre.10
Some of them have already had a favourable assessment by national Competent Authorities, Scientific
Committees of the EU or the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In many other cases national
competent authorities have submitted questions and objections to the approval and in other cases the

4

competent authority in charge of the initial evaluation is still not satisfied with the information
provided by the applicants and the quality of their assessment and documentation.

General traceability rules and concept

According to the European Commission "traceability is defined as the ability to trace GMOs, and
products produced from them, at all stages of their placing on the market throughout the production
and distribution chains, facilitating control and also holding the potential to withdraw products if
necessary. The obligation of traceability is designed to facilitate accurate labelling of the final
product and to provide the means for inspection and control of labelling claims. It is a direct response
to the voices of consumers who have made it clear that they want – and have a right – to make
informed choices. This proposal places an obligation on all parts of the distribution chain to provide
that information. It also builds on the current EU food-labelling scheme but adds additional
provisions to allow for inspection and control of compliance with the current rules and reduces
reliance on analytical methods to detect the presence of GMOs."11

Operators placing on the market an authorised GMO are obliged to inform in
writing receiving operators about the fact that the product contains or consists or is
produced from GMOs, and of the unique identifiers assigned to these GMOs. This
information must be transmitted to any subsequent operator receiving the product.
Records of any such transactions must be kept by the operators for a period of five
years.

This concept of "farm to fork" traceability not only relates to GMO ingredients, but is a general
philosophy of the European Union's approach to food safety and consumer information, established in
2002 through a Community Regulation "laying down the general principles and requirements of food
law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food
safety"12 This regulation will be complemented by sectoral legislation, such as the GMO labelling
regulation, and guides the further development of the food law within the EU and its newly established
European Food Safety Authority, EFSA13. Other sectoral legislation underway is a regulation for feed
hygiene, recently proposed by the Commission.14

As a prerequisite for its authorisation any GMO requires a "unique identifier", i.e. a method to identify
and test for the specific GMO, which has to be submitted to the European Reference Laboratory by the
applicant. Details of the concept of these unique identifiers have been established by the
Commission15. Work related to GMO identification is carried out by the EU's Joint Research
Laboratory and its European Network of GMO Laboratories, ENGL16, and complemented by the
European Committee For Standardisation, CEN.17 International standardisation of unique identifiers
for GMOs will be conducted within the framework of the International Biosafety Protocol. The
European Union has adopted implementing legislation of the Biosafety Protocol18 in June 2003, which
also governs the terms of eventual exports of GMOs from the EU.

The concept and the meaning of traceability of GMOs is also discussed at the WHO/FAOs joint Codex
Alimentarius, where an Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Task Force On Foods Derived From
Biotechnology had been established in 1999 and presented its recommendations to the Meeting of the
Codex Plenary in Rome (June 30 - July 7th 2003).19 No agreement has been reached so far on
traceability, while an agreement on minimum standards for health risk assessment was adopted in
Rome. These principles are to be based on pre-market assessment, performed on a case-by-case basis
including an evaluation of both direct effects from the GMO and any unintended effects. Although
these Codex principles would not have a binding effect on national legislation, they could be used as a
reference in case of trade disputes. Present US regulations may not fully confirm with these standards,
especially as regards pre-market testing.

April 2004

New rules and procedures for approval of GMOs in food
and feed
With the entering into force of the new labelling and traceability regulations new  approvals for the
commercial use of some GMOs can be expected within this year. A new approval procedure will
apply, which will be executed by the European Unions newly establish European Food Safety
Authority, EFSA.20

Approval can be sought for food and feed use of specific GMOs as well as for foods containing or
consisting of specific GMOs. A detailed risk assessment regarding the safety for human and animal
consumption and in cases where the GMO will also be released into the environment additional
environmental risk assessment (which is detailed in EU Directive 2001/1821) will be required. These
shall be carried out by the EFSA. The agency informs all national Competent Authorities and may
seek their advise. In cases of applications for environmental releases EFSA is obliged to seek the
advice of a national authority . An opinion of the EFSA regarding the safety of the product will then
be published and the public will have the possibility to make comments. Having received this opinion
the Commission shall submit a draft decision to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and
Animal Health composed of representatives of the member states.22 The Commission may also take
into account "other legitimate factors relevant to the matter", not directly referring to health and
environmental risks. If the Committee approves the Commission's decision, the approval shall be
granted or denied accordingly. Should the Committee not agree with the proposed decision by
qualified majority, the decision will be submitted to the Council of Ministers, who are to decide with
qualified majority.23 The authorisation will be granted only for a limited time period of ten years, after
which the approval needs to be reviewed or expires.

Market situation and impacts

Food and feed ingredients presently affected by GM labelling are mainly soya and maize products.
The introduction of GM wheat in the USA and Canada, which has been recently submitted for
approval by Monsanto, could have equally massive implications for transatlantic and global
commodity trade.24

Soybeans
Soybeans, which arrive in bulk carriers, are crushed in a few, centralised facilities into oil, protein
preparations, lecithin and a diversity of other products (for a full list of soy products see Annex 1) as
well as animal feed (soy meal and soy cake) which is also directly imported in large quantities.

Soybean imports are by far the most significant in terms of quantities and value. The EU is the largest
import market for soybeans and meal in the world.25 Soybeans account for over 40% of all EU feed
imports26 and for nearly a quarter of all US agricultural exports to the Community.Soya is also the
most significant GM ingredient in terms of dispersion throughout the food chain (see Annex 1).

A single ingredient derived from soybeans - lecithin - which is used as an emulsifier, accounts for an
estimated 80% of potential presence of GM material in products on supermarket shelves. It is yielded
after crushing from a small fraction (0,5%) of the crude soya oil. 150.000 tonnes of lecithin are traded
world-wide. Demand is increasing, also due to its health properties. Cleaning methods for lecithin are
available, which prevent the detection of DNA in the product. However, with the new traceability
regulation, detectability is no longer the decisive point for future labelling. Substantial impacts on this
market can be expected.

As major oil and fat processors, such as Unilever, have requested a non-GM supply for EU production
already over the past years, large quantities of the oil derived from GMOs was re-exported by
European oil mills to Eastern European Countries. However, with the accession to the EU of Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Baltic States in 2004, labelling laws will also apply in these
countries.

These factors, combined with increased demand for non-GMO feed is a strong incentive for oil mills
to increase their non-GMO processing quantities. Many of them at present switch seasonally between
US or Argentinean GM imports and Brazilian or other non-GM imports. Cleaning the facility to a
degree that allows to stay below the 0,9% contamination threshold is costly and reduces the economic
advantage of different sources of import. This may increase the pressure to entirely switch to non-
GMO processing.

Maize (corn)

Kernel maize for feed and processing
The European Union allows the annual imports of maize at reduced duties into Spain (2 million tons)
and Portugal (500.000 tons), which are regulated in specific legislation on the tariff quota and
organised by a tendering procedure 27.

US imports of kernel maize under this regulation have collapsed to near zero since 1999, due to the
fact that some GM varieties grown in the US are not approved for food or feed use within the EU. US
officials claim that the 'de facto' moratorium translates into an annual loss of over 300 million US$ in
maize exports for US farmers. This would be accurate, if the US could regain the entire market share it
used to have in 1996.28 However, price advantages of imports from Argentina (which only allows
growing of EU approved GM varieties) and Brazil (no GM varieties approved) may cast some doubts
on these figures.

In addition the new labelling regulations require not only the labelling of GM maize, but also of starch
and glucose produced from such maize. This will continue to be a major trade barrier for GM maize,
even when approvals for additional GM maize varieties will be granted later this year.

Some of these varieties which contain antibiotic markers and new proteins may also face opposition
from national authorities. The use of antibiotic markers in GMOs is supposed to be phased out within
the EU by the end of 2004.29

Maize gluten feed for animal feed
The remains of maize after milling and starch extraction are used as cheap sources of animal feed and
account for about 10% of EU feed concentrates. Large quantities are being imported to the EU from
the USA. While some disputes arose in the past, whether GM maize gluten feed was to be considered
a live GMO (some viable kernel seeds usually remain in the mixtures), the new regulations will clearly
require labelling of this product.

Sweet maize for direct human consumption
Sweet maize, mainly canned, some also frozen, is produced by France (300.000 tons), Italy (40.000 t)
and Spain (20.000 t). Imports from the US have decreased to around 1000 tons. Hungary, now
accessing the EU Common Market, is a major exporter of sweet maize, competing with France.
Consumption had dipped in 1998 due to consumer concerns linking maize to GMOs. 30 No GM sweet
maize varieties are presently approved in the EU. However, Syngenta’s GM variety Bt11 is a sweet
maize variety and might be one of the first GM varieties to be approved, if the present moratorium is
lifted. Even though it would have to be labelled, sweet maize producers in Europe are concerned about
the potential impact on their products reputation.

"Masa", a special preparation for chip production
GMOs in maize chips have been one of the first consumer issues in Europe. The special preparation
for their production is now available in non-GMO quality both from new European sources and from
traditional suppliers in the USA and Mexico, who set up Identity Preservation (IP) systems for this
purpose.31

Oilseed rape (Canola)

Canadian exports of canola have collapsed since the introduction of GM varieties in 1995/96.32 The
impacts of the new European labelling rules on other international canola markets can be expected, as
avoiding the use of GM oil in processed foods imported to the EU (from cookies to canned fish and
vegetables) will be crucial to prevent GM labelling.

Also affected by GM labelling requirements is Canadian honey, which increasingly contains GM
pollen from canola and would therefore also be required to be labelled as genetically modified.33

Other GM crops

Other GM crops, which could be imported, but are of minor economic significance, are cotton oil and
fresh or processed Papaya. Future applications could include potato, tomato (GM varieties of both had
been commercialised in the US but were taken off the market again), wheat, beet, sunflower and
eventually rice as well as fruits and vegetables.

Consumer attitudes
European consumers remain sceptical about GMOs, especially when it comes to their own foods.
Continued surveys of the European Unions Eurobarometer and other sources show a constant rejection
of GM foods, even though confidence in benefits arising from genetic engineering technologies seems
to increase in other areas.

Public attention and sensitivity was especially high in 1996-99, when the first GMOs hit the European
market. It has decreased since, after the 'de facto' moratorium on GMO approvals was established in
1998 and nearly all major supermarkets and food brands committed to a non GMO policy. So far, with
negligible exemptions and attempts, no GM products appear on European supermarket shelves. As
there are currently no GM products in the pipeline which would promise any specific consumer
benefits, it is unlikely that this situation will change in the near future.

9

The EU's new labelling rules for GM food & feed

April 2004

With the de facto moratorium possibly coming to an end and the US administration’s recent
aggressive policy on Europe's rejection of GM foods, the level of public awareness may increase and
concerns about GMOs in food may rise again. Also, concerns about environmental impacts of GMOs
appear to have increased in addition to initial concerns about food safety.

Recent political discussions focus more and more on the issue of whether or not GMOs should be
planted within the EU at a commercial scale and how to secure European farmers ability to guarantee
non-GM products for their customers in the future. While labelling of products seems to be resolved
with the new Regulation, these issues of "co-existence" remain unresolved and fiercely disputed. A
majority of Member States are not satisfied with the non-legally “guidelines” published by the
Commission in July 2003, and demand instead the adoption of a EU legislation on “co-existence”.
Special concerns are raised by the organic sector, as its standards categorically exclude the use of
GMOs. Cross pollination and seed contamination with GMOs could severely jeopardise the purity of
non-GM and organic farm products. Local and regional initiatives to declare communities, counties
and districts "GMO free zones" are widespread across Europe and frequently supported by the local
authorities. Their number increases despite the fact that the EU Commission has recently stated that
GMO free zones would only be acceptable on a voluntary basis.

Industry response

Supermarkets

Since 1999/2000 most European Supermarkets follow a non-GMO policy with regard to their own
brand products and have not sold any products labelled as genetically modified. In June 2003 the
British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of British Supermarkets, has sent an
unequivocal warning to the Government that GM food is not commercially viable in the UK.

"The customer is where the real power lies. Supermarkets are not going to give
shelf space to something that doesn't sell."

David Southwell, British Retail Consortium 35

In 2001 the BRC had published a comprehensive "Technical Standard For the Supply of Identity
Preserved Non-Genetically Modified Food Ingredients and Products".36.

It can be anticipated that safety margins well below the allowable thresholds will be imposed on
suppliers throughout the food chain by those players who have the market power to do so.

10

The EU's new labelling rules for GM food & feed

April 2004

Some supermarket chains, such as Carrefour (EU's No.1), not only impose non-GMO requirements on
their suppliers, but actively use their market influence to secure the necessary non-GMO supply in co-
operation with their partners.37

Major Food producers

Most international and major national brands of food producers have made commitments to their
customers not to use GM ingredients. Considerable efforts have been made over the past few years to
avoid any necessity to label products as genetically modified. The new labelling rules will entail new
challenges for food producers, especially with regard to starch and oil ingredients.

A survey conducted in 2003 by Greenpeace in Germany reveals, however, that the large majority of
the food industry has already prepared systems to comply with these challenges and does not intend to
put any products on the market which are labelled as genetically modified. More than half a year ago,
companies who had already done their "homework" included Apollinaris-Schweppes, Coca Cola,
Barilla, Campbells, Frosta, General Mills, Karlsberg, Kraft Jacobs Suchard, Procter & Gamble,
Unilever. Many others responded to Greenpeace's inquiries that they were presently organising the
transition with regard to the new ingredients requiring labelling.38

Animal Feed producers

While GM animal feed now has to be labelled, consumer products derived from the use of this feed,
such as meat, eggs and milk do not require labelling. Therefore the impact of the new labelling regime
on the market remains to be seen. The trend to increase non-GMO imports of soybeans will continue,
provided supply, especially from Brazil, remains stable and reliable. Other sources of non-GM
soybeans are Canada, India, Paraguay and potentially China.

In addition there are moves within the European Community to partially replace imported soya with
other sources of protein that can also be grown domestically as the "Blairhouse Agreement" between
the EU and the USA, which put tight restrictions on EU oilseed subsidies is presently expiring. In this
context it is noteworthy that the EU Commission recently decided to open an examination procedure
in response to a complaint by the European Oilseed Alliance (EOA) about US soybean subsidies.39
The Commission is collecting evidence on the negative impact of the US oilseed subsidies on prices
and will present a report no later than the end of 200540.

Meat, milk and egg producers

Major meat producers, but also some milk and egg producers in Europe have already started voluntary
schemes to guarantee non-GMO feeding41. Also, some exporters, such as the major Brazilian poultry
producers Sadia and Perdigão, have started non-GM programmes.42

The BSE crisis and subsequent feed contamination scandals have made animal feed an extremely
sensitive issue in the European public. The Commission is presently preparing additional legislation
regarding lists of permissible ingredients and HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points)
systems for feed producers. Various national and regional voluntary quality programmes attempt to
regain consumer confidence. One of the bigger programmes, QS ("Qualität und Sicherheit") in
Germany, at present does not exclude GM feed. Criticised by consumer organisations the organising
industries argued that the lack of labelling made it too difficult for producers to comply with such a
standard. This will change now.

Stringent demands for non-GM ingredients also come from the pet food industry.
The WTO case against the EU's de facto moratorium

In May 2003 the US administration took formal steps against the European Union’s "de facto
moratorium" on the approval of GMOs and a number of national marketing and import bans of
member states. These steps were supported by similar requests of Canada and Argentina.44 After
bilateral talks in Geneva collapsed the US requested the establishment of a dispute settlement panel,
which was eventually appointed on 4 March 2004. The panel has six to nine months to judge whether
the EU moratorium was or is in breach of WTO rules. The panels decision can be appealed again by
the defendant. A final result may be expected sometime during 2005.

The moratorium is based on unilateral declarations of member states that they will not follow the
present rules of GMO approvals until substantial improvements are made regarding the risk
assessment, labelling and traceability and liability issues. With the adoption of the new Release
Directive 2001/18/EC (which still needs to be implemented by most member states) and the Food and
Feed and Traceability Regulations, many of the initial demands of these member states appear to be
satisfied. However, liability rules and anti-contamination measures regarding the commercial release
of GMOs are still missing. The European Commission argues that the moratorium is about to be lifted
or even no longer exists.

The present moratorium is not the major and persistent stumbling block for GMO
imports to the EU. Ironically it will be the Food and Feed Labelling and
Traceability Regulations designed to finally lift this moratorium, that will prevent
marketability of GM products within the EU as it enables consumers to effectively
reject these products on the market.

Whether the US will also take the new European labelling and traceability rules to a WTO dispute
settlement, remains to be seen. This would be a serious global precedence and a severe challenge of
the EU's sovereignty and ability to protect and inform their citizens.

In recent years the USA has threatened countries establishing restrictive GMO legislation with the
argument that these contravened WTO rules, usually combined with direct economic and political
pressure. 45 A recently passed US bill even goes as far as directly linking aid on combating AIDS/HIV
with the requirement that beneficiary nations should accept GM food aid.46

The European Union has strong means to counter such pressure. They include two recent decisions by
the WTO allowing the EU to impose penalty tariffs up to four billion US $ to retaliate against unfair
US practices in the FSC case47 and an impending penalty of 2,2 billion US $ in the case of US steel
subsidies violating WTO rules.48 The first option has not been used so far. The EU decided, in the case
of hormone treated beef, to pay penalties imposed rather than respect a WTO decision it does not
accept.49 Continued US pressure on China about its restrictions of GM soybean imports has also
yielded no results so far. It was met with firm rejection of the Chinese government, which has adopted
labelling rules very similar to the European standards. Smaller and more dependent nations, however,
do not have such options.

"The US action in the WTO was clearly timed to preempt the final ratification of the Protocol. The US
agenda is to assert the predominance of the WTO over the Protocol by defining GMO restrictions as
‘trade barriers’, and by doing so seeks to block further progress in the implementation of the Protocol.
By using the WTO to undermine the new global consensus on biosafety, the US is targeting the
countries in the South."50

The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety

The International Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety under the Convention on Biological Diversity51
entered into force on September 11th 2003, while the negotiations at the WTO ministerial meeting in
Cancun were collapsing. This international agreement sets up minimum safety standards regarding the
transboundary movement of GMOs.

The Protocol, inter alia, requires an advance informed agreement for the import of GMOs from one
country to another, environmental risk assessments and explicitly establishes the right of member
states to refuse such agreement also on the basis of the precautionary principle. This means that the
lack of scientific certainty regarding the safety of GMOs for human health and the environment, is
accepted as legal grounds to refuse their import.

A major dispute during the negotiations of the Protocol was about whether the Protocol supersedes
WTO provisions or vice versa. The final text put both agreements on equal level, which could put the
UN system of multilateral environmental agreements in direct conflict with the WTO system.  The
WTO however could also decide to accept the Biosafety Protocol as a reference agreement for their
own decisions, as it has done with the Codex Alimentarius and other international agreements. The US
case against the EU moratorium is mainly a political move to undermine the "right to say no"
enshrined in the Protocol in the run-up to its entering into force. It is seen to aim at many less powerful
nations, which have also imposed moratoria and other restrictions on GMO imports.

The signatory states of the Protocol have agreed to extend the provisions of the agreement to labelling
and liability issues within two years after its entering into force. These negotiations have become
another "battleground" between the different approaches of the USA and the European Union.
However, despite massive opposition and obstruction tactics from the USA, the Parties to the Protocol,
at their first Meeting held in Kuala Lumpur on 23-27th February 2004, already adopted more detailed
requirements on the documentation and labelling of « Living Modified Organisms », including those
intended for food, feed or processing. The documentation accompanying transboundary movements of
living GMOs will have to include the « common, scientific and commercial names » of the GMOs
present in the shipment, as well as their « transformation event codes » or, where available, their
« unique identifier codes »52. A Biosafety Clearinghouse, which will collect all information on
transboundary movements of GMOs and which will also provide a database for unique identifiers of
individual GMO events, has already been set up in Montreal.

The US has neither ratified the Biosafety Protocol nor the Convention on Biological Diversity and has
strongly criticised the precautionary principle, which is also enshrined in the Treaty of the European
Union. The Bush administration could be heading for a conflict which appears hard to win, especially
after the international community has shown a strong consensus to move forward with the
implementation of the Protocol. Forcing products upon unwilling countries and their citizens may
resonate with some domestic agricultural constituencies in the short run. It is certainly not a smart and
promising way to win markets, as long as these are free.

New Codex Alimentarius guidelines

In July 2003 the Codex Alimentarius Commission adopted two new guidelines regarding the safety of
foods derived from genetically modified organisms: "Principles for the Risk Analysis of Foods
Derived from Modern Biotechnology" and "Guideline for the Conduct of Food Safety Assessment of
Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Plants".53. These documents represent an important step
forward in defining at an international level the acceptable procedures for evaluating the safety of
genetically engineered foods. Notably, the guidelines serve to highlight the inadequacies and lack of
scientific rigor used in the approval process in the United States, where the bulk of the genetically
modified varieties are developed and grown.  The US process is seen as sorely inadequate in
comparison to the new guidelines; in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not have
its own detailed safety standard or testing guidelines.54

And Consideration (22) "The labelling should include objective information to the effect that a food or feed consists of, contains or is
produced from GMOs. Clear labelling, irrespective of the detectability of DNA or protein resulting from the genetic modification in the final
product, meets the demands expressed in numerous surveys by a large majority of consumers, facilitates informed choice and precludes the
potential misleading of consumers as regards methods of manufacture or production."

7 F&F Regulation, Consideration (17) "This Regulation should cover food and feed produced ‘from ’a GMO but not food and feed ‘with ’a
GMO. The determining criterion is whether or not material derived from the genetically modified source material is present in the food or in
the feed. Processing aids which are only used during the food or feed production process are not covered by the definition of food or feed
and, therefore, are not included in the scope of this Regulation. Nor are food and feed which are manufactured with the help of a genetically
modified processing aid included in the scope of this Regulation. Thus, products obtained from animals fed with genetically modified feed or
treated with genetically modified medicinal products will be subject neither to the authorisation requirements nor to the labelling
requirements referred to in this Regulation."

OF BIOTECH PRODUCTS. Request for Consultations by the United States, dated 13 May 2003.

The EU's new labelling rules for GM food & feed

April 2004

"Since October 1998, the EC has applied a moratorium on the approval of biotech products.  The EC has suspended consideration of
applications for, or granting of, approval of biotech products under the EC approval system. A number of applications for placing biotech
products on the market have been blocked in the approval process under EC legislation and have never been considered for final approval.
The approvals moratorium has restricted imports of agricultural and food products from the United States. Moreover, the member States
maintain a number of national marketing and import bans on biotech products even though those products have already been approved by the
EC for import and marketing in the EC.  The national marketing and import bans have restricted imports of agricultural and food products
from the United States." (...)

These measures appear to be inconsistent with the SPS Agreement, the GATT 1994, the Agriculture Agreement and the TBT Agreement,
including but not limited to the following provisions:

(1) SPS Agreement, Articles 2, 5, 7 and 8, and Annexes B and C;

(2) GATT 1994, Articles I, III, X and XI;

(3) Agriculture Agreement, Article 4;  and

(4) TBT Agreement, Articles 2 and 5.“

WTO, WT/DS292/1, 20 May 2003: EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES - MEASURES AFFECTING THE APPROVAL AND MARKETING
OF BIOTECH PRODUCTS. Request for Consultations by Canada, dated 13 May 2003.

„The Government of Canada hereby requests consultations with the European Communities ("EC") ... concerning measures affecting the
approval and marketing of products that contain, consist of, or are produced from, genetically modified organisms ("GM products"). As a
result of measures taken by EC Member States, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Sweden, since 1998, the EC has maintained a de facto moratorium on the approval of GM products.  The
moratorium prevents GM products from accessing or proceeding through the EC's approvals process. As a consequence of the moratorium,
Canadian GM products have been blocked at various stages of the EC's approval process.

In addition, some EC Member States, including Austria, France, Greece, and Italy have prohibited the importation and marketing of GM
products despite those products having been approved by the EC for importation and marketing.

These measures appear to be inconsistent with the SPS Agreement, the TBT Agreement, the GATT 1994, and the Agreement on Agriculture.
The provisions of these Agreements with which the measures appear to be inconsistent include the following:

•

•

•

•

SPS Agreement:  Articles 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.5, 5.6, 7, 8 and Annexes B and C;

TBT Agreement:  Articles 2.1, 2.2, 2.8, 5.1 and 5.2;

GATT 1994:  Articles I:1, III:4, X:1 and XI:1;

Agreement on Agriculture:  Article 4.2.“

WTO, WT/DS293/1, 21 May 2003: EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES - MEASURES AFFECTING THE APPROVAL AND MARKETING
OF BIOTECH PRODUCTS. Request for Consultations by Argentina, dated 14 May 2003.

„Since 1998, the European Communities has suspended consideration of applications for approval of biotechnology products.  In addition,
some of their member States have introduced prohibitions, even infringing Community rules for biotechnology products. In effect, Argentina
indicates that the action by the European Communities is detrimental to international trade in biotechnology products, as can be seen from
the following:  (a) de facto measures leading to the suspension of consideration or the non-consideration of various applications without
sufficient scientific evidence or a proper risk assessment;  and (b) undue delay in finalizing consideration of various applications for approval
of biotechnology products submitted by various WTO Members. This action affects biotechnology products approved for marketing in
Argentina and those still being considered, prior to approval, as indicated in Annex I. Furthermore, Argentina challenges the specific
prohibitions introduced by the member States of the European Communities, which infringe Community legislation and affect, inter alia,
biotechnology products approved for marketing in Argentina, as indicated in Annex II.

The relevant measures by the European Communities and some of their member States infringe the following provisions of the WTO
Agreements:

(a)

Inter alia, but not exclusively, Articles 2, 5, 7, 8, 10 and Annexes B and C of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures;

(b)  Article 4 of the Agreement on Agriculture;

(c)

inter alia, but not exclusively, Articles I, III, X and XI of the GATT 1994;  and

inter alia, but not exclusively, Articles 2, 5 and 12 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.“

46 "(...) Sense of Congress relating to food assistance for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. (...) (C) Although the United States is willing to
provide food assistance to these countries in need, a few of the countries object to part or all of the assistance because of fears of benign
genetic modifications to the foods. (...) 2) Sense of Congress - It is therefore the sense of Congress that United States food assistance should
be accepted by countries with large populations of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS, particularly African countries, in order to
help feed such individuals."

47 FINANCIAL TIMES: Brussels sets ultimatum in trade dispute with US (b Tobias Buck in Brussels). May 7 2003: „The European Union
on Wednesday dramatically raised the stakes in the biggest trade dispute ever to hit the World Trade Organisation, when it issued an
ultimatum to the US over a long-running battle over corporate tax breaks.Brussels is giving US Congress until the end of September to repeal
the Foreign Sales Corporations provision, which benefits large exporters such as Microsoft and Boeing, or face sanctions worth $4bn - the
largest retaliation package in the history of the WTO.The deadline was announced hours before the WTO in Geneva gave ist final approval
to the list of 1,800 US products targeted by the EU, which means Brussels now only needs the approval of EU member states to impose the
sanctions.“

April 2004

48 See The International Herald Tribune July 12, 2003: U.S. tariffs on steel are illegal; Europe and others are widely expected to impose
sanctions (by Paul Meller, The New York Times): „U.S. import tariffs on steel products imposed in the spring of 2002 were deemed illegal
Friday by the World Trade Organization, raising the likelihood that the EuropeanUnion and others will retaliate with sanctions on American
exports... Richard Mills, spokesman for the U.S. trade representative, said the United States would appeal the decision...If the appeal fails to
reverse Friday's decision, then the European Union will impose sanctions on American imports worth up to $2.2 billion almost immediately,
the European Commission spokeswoman on trade issues, Arancha Gonzalez, said.“

49 In 1998 a WTO dispute settlement body decided that the EU ban on beef treated with hormones to speed up growth was lacking scientific
evidence of detrimental health effects and therefor was an unfair trade barrier. A penalty fee of US$ 116.8 million and additional Canadian $
11,3 million was imposed on the EU by the WTO on 15 July 1999 allowing the US and Canada to impose 100 percent tariffs on selected
European goods. Still the EU ban is not lifted but confirmed by the COMMISSION PROPOSAL AMENDING DIRECTIVE 96/22/EC
CONCERNING THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE IN STOCK-FARMING OF CERTAIN SUBSTANCES HAVING A HORMONAL
OR THYROSTATIC ACTION AND BETA-AGONISTS and by scientific findings. See: Growth promoting hormones pose health risk to
consumers, confirms EU Scientific Committee, Press relase IP/02/604 , 23/04/2002: „The EU Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures
relating to Public Health (SCVPH) confirmed today (23 April 2002) that  the use of hormones as growth promoters for cattle poses a
potential health risk to consumers, following a review  of 17 studies and other recent scientific data. Publishing its third opinion on the risks
to human health from  hormone residues in beef products, the SCVPH found no reason to change its previous opinions of 1999 and 2000.The
