Greenpeace Proposals to
Revolutionise High Seas Oceans Governance

It is clearer today than ever before that the threats to ocean life
are growing and beyond the capacity of any one nation to address
alone. While in the past, we primarily spoke of overﬁshing or
destructive ﬁshing and their impacts on ocean life, today, climate
change and its impacts on marine life must also loom large in the
minds of oceans decision makers. According to a series of reports
released throughout 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC)1, the increase in globally observed
temperatures is very likely due to human activities and sea levels
will continue to rise for centuries even if greenhouse gas
emissions are stabilised. Coastal communities and Small Island
States are already feeling the impacts of climate change. And from
the coastal seas to the deepest waters, the combined and
possibly synergistic effects of climate change and overﬁshing are
already having an impact and could possibly spell disaster for our
oceans' marine life and the vast number of people who depend on
it for their survival.

All around the world, ﬁsheries are collapsing and marine ecosystems are
undergoing fundamental shifts - the consequence of the woefully
inadequate management regimes currently in place. In particular, the
high seas are being plundered on a vast scale and with alarming speed,
creating one of the biggest unseen and potentially irreversible
environmental disasters of our time. Vast legal gaps together with the
lack of political will are leading to the widespread destruction of marine
life across the high seas. To stop this destruction the current
presumptions in favour of freedom of the high seas and the freedom to
ﬁsh2 must be replaced by ones that entrench the concept of freedom for
the seas: Where the ecosystem approach and precautionary principle
are considered as the fundamental core of all oceans management.
Those who want to undertake activities on the high seas must prove
that they will not harm marine life in these international waters before
they are given access, so that the protection of marine ecosystems is
the underlying principle that guides the future management of the high
seas.

In recent years, our understanding of the diverse and unique nature of
deep sea life has expanded, as has the technology capable of
destroying it, making it difﬁcult to control what occurs on the vast
expanses of our largely unregulated high seas. New and emerging
activities and ﬁshing methods that were once inconceivable are now
threatening the future of deep sea biodiversity, as they have done in the
case of coastal and pelagic species. We now know that the oceans’
bounties are not inexhaustible, but vulnerable, complex and ﬁnite.
Destructive and unsustainable ﬁshing practices, such as bottom-
trawling, as well as illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) ﬁshing,
mining and scientiﬁc and commercial exploration of deep-sea areas are
all threatening these vulnerable habitats.

The high seas are currently open to ﬁshing by anyone interested in
doing so, with only minimal ﬂag state controls. Even in those areas
where there are some management controls, patchy regulation and
weak enforcement mean that prohibited activities often continue
unabated.

Instead of working to ensure clean and healthy oceans for the future,
the current high seas oceans governance regime rewards pirate ﬁshers
and those who plunder the oceans. It encourages the ﬁshing industry to
go looking for new species to replace those that have been overﬁshed:
Going deeper and further south in the search for ﬁsh to supply to
consumers in industrialized and northern countries. Under the current
regime, rich countries and distant water ﬁshing nations are beneﬁting at
the expense of our oceans and the many coastal communities of the
global South who are directly dependent on healthy oceans for their
food security and livelihoods.

The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) does more than
simply offer States the right to use our oceans. It also requires that
States fulﬁll numerous duties: To “cooperate with other States in taking
such measures for their respective nationals as may be necessary for
the conservation of the living resources of the high seas” (Article 117),
and “… to protect and preserve the marine environment” (Art. 192). Yet,
industrial-scale destructive ﬁshing practices on the high seas continue
unchallenged and undermine the duties of States to individually and
collectively protect and preserve the marine environment of this global
commons. As a result, our ﬁsh stocks and ocean biodiversity are in
serious jeopardy. And time is running out.

There must be a shift from the current management regime away from
serving ﬁshing and industrial interests towards a comprehensive
ecosystem based management regime with the precautionary principle
at its core. The high seas particularly suffer from this ‘Wild West’
mentality. Anyone who has the money, the technology and the
inclination can go and take whatever they want, with very few
regulations to ensure sustainability or equity. The few regulations that
are in place are diluted even further by weak enforcement.

The time has passed for a half-hearted approach to conserving what is
left of the biodiversity and resources of the world’s oceans at the cost and
to the detriment of all countries and all peoples. Clearly, the legal system
governing the high seas has not kept pace with the rapid expansion of
human activities and impacts. Only bold, innovative, visionary and decisive
action has any chance of preventing the massive and irreversible
destruction of the biodiversity of our oceans. Only such visionary and
decisive action can ensure freedom for our seas in the 21st Century.

The following concrete proposals would fundamentally change the ways
that human activities on the oceans are managed and would ensure
free, clean and healthy oceans for the future:

Greenpeace International Freedom for the Seas: Now and for the Future 3

Greenpeace Proposals to Revolutionise High Seas Oceans
Governance

1 The creation of a global network of marine reserves on the high

seas. Marine reserves are highly protected areas that are off-limits to
all extractive and destructive uses, including ﬁshing. A global
network of marine reserves would provide the insurance policy
needed against uncertainty in decision making processes, protecting
marine biodiversity in places and times they most need it. It would
build resilience in the marine ecosystem, and ﬂexibility in the midst of
future unknowns (i.e., climate change impacts), allowing ocean
biodiversity in targeted areas to replenish and ﬂourish. In order to be
fully effective, these areas should cover 40% of the high seas and be
of sufﬁcient scale to ensure the integrity and functioning of high seas
ecosystems. The network should protect the whole range of high
seas ecosystems as well as areas that are biologically rich or
particularly vulnerable to present or possible future human impacts,
such as ﬁshing or seabed mining. Creating a global network of
marine reserves is the single most effective tool for protecting the
marine environment including deep sea ecosystems, and would
provide the vital underpinning for implementing the ecosystem
approach.

2 Immediate action, led by industrialised countries, to keep global
mean temperature rise below 2°C. In Bali, December 2007, the
world agreed on a vital next phase of global negotiations to deliver a
strengthened Kyoto Protocol in 20093. Discussions at the UN
General Assembly should focus on how we can deliver on the Bali
Mandate, including through developed countries emission
reductions commitments of at least 30% by 2020, and by at least
80% in 2050.

3 The immediate implementation of UN General Assembly Resolution
on Sustainable Fisheries (A/Res 61/105) which calls on States and
Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) to take
immediate action to sustainably manage ﬁsh stocks and protect
vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) from the adverse impacts of
bottom-trawling on the high seas.

4 The UN General Assembly should adopt a resolution establishing a
moratorium on high seas bottom-trawling to protect deep sea
biodiversity of the high seas by all States, if the UN’s review in 2009
concludes that RFMOs and States have failed to implement
Resolution 61/105 (as described above). This interim measure would
provide scientists with the time to assess the range and extent of
this biodiversity, and politicians with the space to fully implement
61/105 as well as negotiate longer-term measures that would
ensure that bottom trawling on the high seas is effectively regulated
and sustainably and equitably managed.

5 The UN General Assembly should convene a negotiating conference

to develop a new implementing agreement under UNCLOS to
address the current gaps in oceans governance and ensure the
long-term conservation and sustainable management of living
marine species, ecosystems and biological diversity, the protection
and preservation of the marine environment, and the fair and
equitable sharing of the beneﬁts arising out of the utilisation marine
genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Such an
agreement would build on the existing framework of UNCLOS, and
integrate best practices and norms found in other international and
regional agreements, with the application of the ecosystem
approach and the precautionary principle at its core.

6 All extractive activities should be halted in high seas areas where

there are no management regimes in place (most of the high seas),
effectively creating large-scale marine reserves until such time as:

a An internationally representative panel of scientists had been
provided the time and resources to use an ecosystem-based
management and precautionary paradigm to assess what is out
there, identify key areas, and

i designate a global network of high seas marine reserves

(expanses of oceans where extractive industries such as ﬁshing
and mining, as well as disposal activities, are prohibited):

ii

identify areas that could be opened to extractive practices, but
would require prior environmental impact assessments in such
areas based on Articles 5 and 6 (ecosystem-based and
precautionary approach) of the United Nations Fish Stocks
Agreement (FSA), that would place the burden of proof on
these industries to show that their planned activities will not
harm the marine environment, and that they will bear the costs
(under a strict liability regime) for any harm done;

b The beneﬁts of any extractive activities in such areas would be

shared on an equitable basis and managed through, for example,
a fund that could be set up to monitor and enforce regulations
adopted to ensure the sustainable and equitable management
and beneﬁt sharing of such resources. This would include active
representation of State and non-State actors in a transparent and
accountable manner;

c These activities could not be conducted until policy makers had
the opportunity to develop legally binding measures, including
clear sanctions against violating states, in order to regulate such
activities.

7 Ratiﬁcation and implementation of the United Nations Agreement on
Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (1995) (FSA) by all
coastal and distant water ﬁshing States.

8 Application of the FSA to discrete high seas ﬁsh stocks.

9 Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) need a
major overhaul (see p.6 for more details). Those that have not
adopted the ecosystem approach and precautionary principle to
ﬁsheries management as directed in Articles 5 and 6 of the FSA,
should be given two years by the United Nations General
Assembly to do so, or face the closure of the ﬁsheries under their
jurisdiction until this has been achieved.

10 The international ﬁshing ﬂeet at national, regional and international
levels needs to be substantially reduced to deal with the realities
of the threats to ocean life today. Incentives must be developed to
reduce such capacity. Harmful subsidies to the ﬁshing industry
must be removed.

Legally binding measures to regulate industrial ﬁshing on the
high seas could include:

1 The establishment of a central monitoring, control and compliance
authority for all vessels active on the high seas that would be
funded by dues paid by States according to the number of
vessels authorised to undertake extractive activities on the high
seas. Dues paid by vessels licensed to ﬁsh in such waters could
fund compliance, monitoring and enforcement. This would deter
such vessels from ‘turning a blind eye’ to their illegal, unregulated
and unreported (IUU) counterparts, as these ﬁshers would actually
be costing them money.

2 Establishment of a single, centralised, compatible Vessel

Monitoring System (VMS) for all vessels licensed to ﬁsh on the
high seas to enable States to distinguish between vessels
authorised to ﬁsh on the high seas or an Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEZ). Vessels unable to provide VMS data for any part of
their voyage would not be permitted to land their catch. Such a
system would be operated by the centralised compliance
authority, which would report to all States on infractions by any
vessels in the system, and permit any States participating in the
system to take punitive actions against such vessels in their
respective jurisdictions.

3 “Redlisting” of ﬁshing vessels and companies that breach

conservation measures, i.e.: deny ﬁshing vessels, and their
owners/operators the authorisation to ﬁsh by any method and for
any species on the high seas.

4 Adopting national legislation that requires a ‘genuine link’ made
between the ﬂag-State and vessels carrying their ﬂags, and that
makes it illegal for nationals to reﬂag vessels to avoid compliance.
Such legislation should include the right for a State to legally

sanction vessels, their owners and operators, as well as redlisting
those that have reﬂagged vessels or attempted to do so.

5 Closing ports to non-complying ﬁshing vessels and to vessels

ﬂying the ﬂags of non-complying States.

6 Intensive in-port vessel inspections with the right to sanction such
vessels provided by intergovernmental port state enforcement
agreements.

7 Outlawing transshipment at sea of any species that could be

caught on the high seas.

8 Closing markets to ﬁsh and ﬁsh products that do not carry

credible certiﬁcation establishing that the ﬁsh and ﬁsh products
caught on the high seas were derived from licensed ﬁshing
operations. Using established international trade regulations (such
as CITES listings) to regulate trade in species that are already
under threat.

9 Harmonising and adopting national laws and regulations to

implement international measures to control nationals engaged in
all activities undertaken on the high seas, including ﬁshing or
owning or operating vessels ﬁshing in areas beyond national
jurisdiction. These should include prior notiﬁcation to States by
nationals of their proposed activities, along with requirements for
environmental impact assessments for such activities.

10 Exchanging, pooling and publicising information on vessels and
companies involved in high seas ﬁshing, including the operators,
captains, beneﬁcial owners of vessels, and those providing
banking, insurance and other services to them.

11 Requiring that information on vessels and companies interested in

engaging in high seas ﬁshing be provided to the central
monitoring, compliance and enforcement authority in a standard
international format, before authorisation to access these ﬁsheries
is given. Where vessels or companies have been ‘redlisted’ by the
authorities, permission to ﬁsh will not be granted.

12 Requiring under domestic law, that prior to any vessel being
granted the ﬂag of a State, the information stated above is
submitted to the central compliance authority. A prerequisite for
‘ﬂagging’ will then be the conﬁrmation by the central authority that
the vessel, its owners and operators, have not contravened any
international or national regulations.

13 Cooperation among coastal states and those participating in

relevant regional management arrangements to ensure that all
States have sufﬁcient capacity to manage and control their coastal
and EEZ ﬁsheries to ensure compliance with national regulations
and international obligations.

that they can effectively implement the ecosystem approach
as mandated by the FSA. As ROMOs, they must be given the
functional ability and capacity as well as mandate to address the
broader ecological impacts of human activities on the world’s
oceans. Since such change will take time, it is essential that the
international community recognises RFMOs as a single, limited tool
that could be effective in short to medium-term oceans governance.
The international community cannot wait around hoping for this
change while marine biodiversity suffers. The RFMOs must adopt
and implement uniform conservation and management measures
and incorporate the ecosystem approach in their decision-making
processes now in order to stop the destruction of high seas
biodiversity while medium and long-term measures are developed
and implemented.

RFMOs: Regularly Failing to Manage our Oceans

The most common mechanism for ‘managing’ high seas ﬁsheries is
through Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs),
but it has been widely acknowledged in intergovernmental fora that
RFMOs are failing in their mandate (both the UN Food and
Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the High Seas Task Force have
recently recommended that RFMOs undergo performance reviews
on an urgent basis).4 Although the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement
(FSA) designated RFMOs as the primary mechanism for managing
and conserving high seas straddling and highly migratory ﬁsh
stocks (with FSA Articles 5 and 6 being the legal cornerstones for
applying the ecosystem approach and precautionary principle to
ﬁsheries management), States have consistently failed to use
RFMOs to implement their speciﬁc obligations under these Articles.
As recommended in the Chatham House Report5, RFMOs should
have a transparent allocation process apart from the decision-
making process that determines total allowable catch. They also
seem to have severe problems addressing the loss of sharks,
albatrosses, marine turtles and other species impacted by ﬁshing
activities in their waters. Another problem is that the FSA covers
only straddling and highly migratory ﬁsh stocks,6 and the
management of discrete high seas stocks, such as orange roughy,
is not covered under the FSA. Most RFMOs operate behind closed
doors; they need to have transparent decision-making processes as
well as make their data publicly available.

Beyond the intrinsic institutional problems inherent in RFMOs, an
additional problem is that most of the high seas are not covered by
RFMOs, and accordingly, most of the world’s ﬁsh stocks remain
unregulated. In the last two years, a number of RFMOs have been
or are in the process of being established, including, the South
Paciﬁc RFMO for discrete high seas and straddling ﬁsh stocks, the
North Paciﬁc RFMO, and the South Indian Ocean Fisheries
Agreement (SIOFA). Still, these RFMOs are in their infancy and not
yet operational; signiﬁcant gaps in RFMO coverage remain. As
discussed above, even, for those areas that are regulated, RFMOs
have had a very disappointing track record in effectively managing
their ﬁsheries or applying ecosystem-based ﬁsheries management.

RFMOs must be fundamentally changed to operate as
Regional Oceans Management Organisations (ROMOs) so
