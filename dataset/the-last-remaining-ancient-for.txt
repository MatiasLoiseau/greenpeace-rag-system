THE LAST
OF THE WORLDS ANCIENT FORESTS

In 1992 all but nine of the world’s independent states signed an agreement in Rio 
to help stop the destruction of the world’s remaining forests.
Ten years later, more than 10 million hectares of ancient forest are still being clea-
red or destroyed every year. That is an area the size of a soccer pitch every twoseconds.
These forests are essential to maintain life on earth and are truly diverse. They
include boreal, temperate and tropical forests; coniferous and broadleaved forests;rainforests, dry forests and mangroves. They regulate the climate, filter air, cleanwater and prevent erosion. They have a mitigating effect on heat, frost, drought andstorms.
The ancient forests are home to millions of forest people who depend on them for
their survival both physically and spiritually. These forests also house around two-thirds of the world’s terrestrial species of plants and animals. That’s hundreds of thousands of different plants and animals, whose future depend on the ancientforests.
Throughout the world, the ancient forests are in crisis. Almost a quarter of the 
world’s mammals and 12 per cent of its birds are now on the edge of extinction.Countless species living in these forests have already been lost. If forest destruction rates set in the 1990s continue, half of the species living in the forestsof the world, will disappear by the middle of this century. And many of the peoplesand cultures who depend on these forests for their way of life are also under threat.There is a last chance to protect these forests and the life they support.THE FUTURE OF ANCIENT FORESTS

threat to them and of their commercial importance is
helpful to decision-makers in politics and business.Global For est Watch (GFW) is the first worldwide forest
mapping and monitoring network created by the WorldResour ces Institute (WRI) aiming to use comparable
parameters and methods. GFW has provided the datafor these maps.
WHAT IS THE WRI?
The W orld Resources Institute is an independent 
centre for policy research and technical assistance on
global envir onmental and development issues. 
WRI’s mission is to move human society to live in ways 
hat protect the earth’s environment and its capacity 
to provide for the needs and aspirations of current andfuture generations. 
THE GFW APPROACH
Phase 1. Mapping potentially intact ancient
forest (i.e. large tracts of low-access forest) Delineating large tracts of forest with no known access infrastr ucture gives a good proxy measure of
intactness, par ticularly in r egions dominated by 
primary forest. In this phase mapped ar eas are prio-
ritised for further analysis. 
Methodology 
• Existing datasets on known location of r oads, rail-
ways, power lines and where appr opriate, navigable
water ways are integrated, and used to delineate 
low-access forest.
• These areas are then sor ted by block size, to iden-
tify large tracts of low-access for est (The size 
depends on the forest type, and the r egion-specific
human pressures which are associated with r oads
and other access routes.
Phase 2. Mapping intact ancient forest
Taking the natural and geographical situation intoaccount satellite imagery is being analysed for a moreWHAT IS AN ANCIENT FOREST?
Ancient for ests are the world’s remaining for ests which
have been shaped lar gely by natural events and 
which are little impacted by human activities. They areone of the earth’s most precious natural tr easures 
and have developed over thousands, if not millions ofyears. They nurture ecological and climate pr ocesses.
WHY ARE LARGE AREAS FOCUSED ON?
Large areas pr ovide enough habitat to support healthy
populations of even our most far-ranging species, such as wolves and tigers. They are also large enough
to support these species in the face of natural disturbance which have shaped forest ecosystems formillenia. Large undisturbed areas are also needed as a reference for the large majority of for ests which
have already been destroyed. The natural pr ocesses 
of forest development can then be compared andunderstood. Fragmentation divides areas into smallerblocks, splits animal populations and disturbs patterns of movement. Roads are also associated with
human pressures which degrade forest ecosystems,
such as poaching, logging and clearing.
POSSIBLE EXCEPTIONS
The chosen blocksize of mostly 50.000 hectares is
only a rough guidance for mapping the last intact an-cient forests. Known key ecological areas can also be
taken into account. One of those key ecological areasis the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia. It isone of the last temperate rainforest areas in the world.To protect rare species such as the Spirit Bear smaller
units of ancient forests need to be pr otected as well.
WHY MAPS?
To protect ancient for ests ef fectively it is necessary 
to know where they are located. An assessment of theWHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?
accurate assessment of intactness. Second-phase 
analysis is good for eliminating areas that have under-gone logging and other disturbance (such as oil andgas development) and is being verified by field surveys.
Methodology
• Due to the different availability of datasets the 
analysis of satellite imagery can vary slightly from
region to region.
For example:• Siberia: two different sets of low (phase 2a) and
high (phase 2b) resolution satellite imagery were used to identify logging r oads and new and old
clearcuts. In a phase 2c these outcomes were 
verified by field surveys.
• Chile: detailed government inventory data, based 
on remote sensing information and field surveyswere analysed to identify intact forests
WORK IN PROGRESS AND PROBLEMS
The maps shown here are not based on standardized
approaches, and so are not always readily com-
parable. Differences in data availability, r egion-specific
patterns in human disturbance, and ecosystem 
(forest type) specific criteria for identifying intact for ests
makes standardisation very difficult. The pr ojects
involved also began at different times in differentareas, and have reached different stages of progress.There was, for example, a very good data base for
Siberia, and excellent oppor tunities for working with
this data (the GIS lab having experienced people and enough money), with the result that the maps arealready finished. Poor data quality and data gaps currently prevent accurate mapping of the central African rainforest. Andin the Amazon the GFW has only just started to create the infrastr ucture needed to start its research.
So what you see here is »work in progr ess« based 
on preliminary data still under r eview. But it is a begin-
ning, and it shows how important this project is. Thisbrochure presents what to Gr eenpeace are the 
most impor tant r esults of the mapping pr oject to date.

Phase 2


ANALYTIC METHODS
In the first phase of the study topographical maps 
were used to exclude areas which have a highly devel-oped infrastr ucture and high populations. In the 
phase 2a medium-resolution satellite pictures (150
metres per pixel) taken in two consecutive years wereused in or der to exclude tundra areas, agricultural
areas and ar eas with visible clearcuts. The phase 2b
employed only high-resolution Landsat satellite picturesor analogue satellite pictures (15-35 metres per pixel)in order to identify and map the exact boundaries of intact ancient forest areas. Sixty-seven field sur veys
(phase 2c) aimed at checking the information from the analyses of the satellite pictur es. 
Intact for est landscape (IFL), for the purposes of this
study, is an area with the following characteristics: • it is situated within the for est zone; 
• it is sufficiently large (smallest are 50.000 hectares
and minimum br eadth ten kilometres); 
• it contains a contiguous mosaic of natural eco-
systems which may or may not be of different types; 
• it is not broken or fragmented by infrastr ucture; and
• it does not display signs of significant transforma-
tion caused by human activity. WHEN THE LAST ANCIENT FORESTS 
OF EUROPE DISAPPEAR, SO TOO WILL THEBROWN BEAR
Deciduous forests once covered almost the whole of
central and Western Eur ope. Today the continent’s only
undisturbed forests are in its extr eme north. Sweden
and Finland now have only three per cent of what Euro-pean ancient forest remains. Only 14 per cent of the forests in european r ussia are still intact. They now
provide the only area of refuge for many species of animals and plants. Undisturbed lakes, riversides andswamps surrounded by ancient forest. Ancient for ests
are the most important habitat for the brown bear,which used to have its home in all the once copiouslyforested areas of Europe, from Scandinavia to the Mediter ranean. The destruction and dismembering
of its habitat is becoming a bigger and bigger danger to what is eur opes strongest animal. At least 150
square kilometres of ancient for ests fall victim to
chainsaws every year. Plants, too, have a hard time.
New vegetation can take years to grow in polar regionswith short summers, and more seldom than ever does
it attain the state it originally had in other climatezones. NATURE’S TREASURE VAULTS?
The common perception of Russia as a country with 
an unlimited wild natural environment is a myth. In reality its undisturbed ar eas, and par ticularly the last
big intact ancient for ests, are shrinking rapidly.
Exploitation for wood and timber, road building, mining,pipelines and railways are cutting up the ancientforests into small fragments. The forest industry hereuses mainly the destr uctive »cut and run« practice 
of logging and vanishing.
The findings of
the study show thatonly 14 per cent(32 million hectares)of the forest areain the European partof Russia is stillintact, large, undis-turbed ancient forest.

CHARACTERISTICS
Intact for est landscapes in this case are defined as

METHOD FOR DELINEATION 
OF INTACT FOREST LANDSCAPES
Phase 1: Reduction of the initial candidate area (the
total area of the forest zone) by elimination of areas in the vicinity (i.e. within buf fer zones) of infra-
structure as well as landscape fragments smaller 
than 50.000 hectaresPhase2a: Reduction of the remaining candidate area(roadless landscapes greater than 50.000 hectar es) by
elimination of areas with larger surface disturbances,visible in satellite images with a resolution of 150-300metersPhase2b: Reduction of the remaining area (candidateintact for est landscapes) by elimination of smaller 
linear and surface disturbances, visible in satelliteimages of high resolution (15 -35 meters)RUSSIA IS THE MOST FORESTED 
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
Even at temperatures of minus 50 degrees Celsius, 
boreal conifer ous forests flourish in Russia. And
despite the extr eme conditions countless species of
fungi, fern, lichen and moss are found here. In the over 5.000 kilometres of forested area, the landscapechanges from sparse tundra covered with stunted willows and birch in the North to dense conifer ous and
deciduous forests in the southern region.The gr eat expanse of the forest means that even large
mammals can find sufficient food here – elk, brownbears, the lynx and, at the south-eastern edge of thetaiga, even the Siberian tiger still exists.This tiger originally r oamed huge areas of Asia. T oday it
only lives in a small area of ancient forest along theSea of Japan north of Vladivostok. There are now twice
as many of these animals in the world’s z oos as 
in the wild, where only 400 Siberian tigers are found.The minerals and reserves of timber in eastern Siberia today still arouse greed throughout the world.The dilapidated Russian economy is highly dependenton foreign exchange, and is therefore engaged in a sell-out of nature on an indescribable scale.THE SNOW FORESTS OF ASIAN RUSSIA
DATA PROBLEMS
The available information is of different quality for 
different parts of Russia. In the naturally highly fragmented tundra forests in the nor thernmost regions
of Siberia and the Russian Far East, the accuracy of the available information was not high enough toassess the degree of human transformation of thelandscape. These forests are shown as forested areasoutside of the studied ter ritory.
THE MYTH
The situation is par ticularly critical for intact natural
landscapes. In the absence of decisive action within thenext few years, such landscapes may disappear within whole ecological regions and even vegetationzones.Intact ar eas r emain only in the most inaccessible
mountainous locations, while the unique far-easternbroad-leaved and mixed conifer-broad-leafed forestshave been almost totally transformed by industrial logging during the last decade.Exposing it as a myth, these findings refute the com-mon opinion that ancient forests still dominate Russia. Such forests dominate only in the nor thern
parts of Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. 
The lines seen in
the satellite pictureare piplines fragment-ing the forest. Whatlooks like a chess-board are clearcuts.
In most parts of
Russia the forestvegetation has beenfundamentally trans-formed by humanactivity.

RESULTS
This coarse scale fragmentation analysis concludes
that Central Africa contains some of the world’s lar gest
tracts of potentially intact ancient forests. However thefuture of these rainforests is unclear due to the 
rapid spread of commer cial extraction activities at
unsustainable rates. Of the r emaining potentially intact
ancient forest tracts, 40 per cent are within commer-cial logging concessions. In ar eas of concessions, 
significantly more access is revealed than the regional
analysis shows. In addition, illegal logging is rampantin many areas of the r egion.
DATA PROBLEMS
Most geographic data available for Africa is coarse,
inaccurate, and based on outdated maps over twentyyears old. In the Republic of Congo, for example, the majority of data is over 40 years old. There is nopublicly available data of logging r oads for any of 
the countries in the region, and r oad data misses most
roads constructed in the last twenty years.
THIS IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY
The limited regional analysis does not take the logging
roads that pass through concessions thr oughoutENDANGERED HABITAT OF THE
FOREST ELEPHANT AND THE GREAT APES 
The Central African Rainforest is the second lar gest
tropical ancient forest area in the world and home toan immeasurable diversity of plant and animal species. About one thousand species of birds and 
four hundred species of mammals live in the forests ofthe Democratic Republic of Congo alone.The forest elephant has its home here. Par tly due 
to its secluded life, it is one of the last animals on thecontinent which has not been researched.In five to ten years, experts estimate that the apes – gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos – will have disappeared together with the last undisturbed forest
areas.Protected ar eas are mostly ignored. Nature pr otection
efforts are thwar ted because of a lack of political 
will, money and personnel, and because of poverty andcorruption.Africa has lost two thirds of its ancient forests in thelast thirty years. The industrial timber industry isresponsible for destr oying huge ar eas of ancient forest.
»Selective extraction« is what the international timbercorporations call the method by which they – purpor tedly
protectively – saw down only one or two of the most expensive giant tr ees per hectare. What they omit to say
is that up to 70 per cent of the remaining vegetation in the logging area also falls victim to roads, sawingmachines or bulldozers, or is crushed by falling tr ees.Central Africa into account. So it provides only a rough
picture of for est fragmentation. While the coarse 
scale map shows extensive areas of potentially intact ancient forests, new logging r oad data for Cameroon,
mapped from 1999-2001 sa tellite imagery, reveals
that significant por tions of areas mapped as low
access forests are actually fragmented by commer cial
logging operations. It can be assumed that in many other parts of Central Africa the situation is notvery different making the coarse scale map overly optimistic.

on the North American continent. This is equivalent to
an area three times the size of Switzerland.
THE APPROACH ENTAILS
• Developing a 1km2grid over a regional transpor-
tation dataset, depicting access r outes. 
• Overlaying gridded access routes on a 1 km2
resolution spatial land cover dataset for 1992-93. 
• dentifying all forests which fell outside of these trans-
port route grid as potentially intact ancient for ests.
• Delineating large tracts (> 50.000 hectares) of
potentially intact ancient for ests.
DATA PROBLEMS AND STATE OF MAP
Being a coarse scale assessment, this map attempts
to provide only a regional picture of areas that arepotentially intact. This analysis fails to pick up fragmen-tation from non-linear features, such as clear cuts 
and mines. Also, the analysis does not evaluate distur-bance from small roads, and seismic lines, which significantly incr ease fragmentation. For example:
Current preliminary analysis in New England at a finerscale shows an average incr ease of 40 per cent in
transportation lines from mapping from r elatively medi-
um scale (1:1.000.000) to finer scale (1:24.000). In some cases up to an 80 per cent increase in trans-portation lines has occurred.WOLVES DISAPPEAR 
WITH THE ANCIENT FORESTS
Conifer ous for ests without end meet the tr eeless 
tundra in the North of the American continent. This is alandscape of scarce resources, hard winters and 
short summers. The trees here are among the biggest
tallest and oldest in the world. One of the last intact temperate rainforests is to befound further south, on the west coast of Canada, inBritish Columbia. Here the moist sea air is forced up-wards to the summits of the coastal mountains, whereclouds turn into rain. Only here does the white kermodeor spirit bear, a rare subspecies of black bear, exist.
Timber corporations clearcut whole ar eas of land to 
obtain pulp to make paper. As a result, soils erode andrivers silt up.The habitats of about two thirds of the 140.000
species of plants, animals and micro-organisms foundin Canada are tied to the ancient forest.The plundering of nature has gone still further in the USA than it has in Canada. Here 94 per cent of theoriginal forest has already been cut down.North America is also the home of the wolf, once oneof the most widespread mammals on ear th. Its 
population in North America today is estimated at nomore than 63.000. There is a lack of for est cor ridors
for wolves to r oam in, and of large intact ar eas of
ancient forest available to them as a refuge.From 1990 to 2000 timber corporations destr oyed at
least 123.000 square kilometres of ancient for est

Results indicate that two-thirds of the regions forests
and woodlands are large tracts (> 20.000 ha) of potentially intact ancient forests. The majority of theseare located in the nor thernmost regions of the con-

Forests of the lower 48 States (of the USA) are relatively fragmented, with only 20 per cent of forest cover remaining in large, poten-tially intact blocks. Most of them are located in the Rocky Mountains and the coastal range of thepacific Nor thwest.

been technically and politically validated. This pro-ject used aerial photographs, principally at a scale of1:20.000, and satellite images for the nor thern 
and southern boundaries of Chile. In combination withthe aerial photographs, 3.600 days of fieldwork were spent.
FINDINGS
The report describes for the first time the extent and
distribution of the countries ancient forests. Ancientforests in Chile are defined as mature forests or densetimberline forests, that are made up of native species,and are intact or have been only slightly altered.
Only a quarter of all forest is in relatively undisturbedtracts of at least 10.000 ha. Almost all of Chile’sancient forests are found in and around the Andean
Mountain Range. At the regional level, the extent of frontier forests increa ses as one moves southward
through the country.TEMPERATE RAINFORESTS OF THE ANDES 
– NO MORE REFUGE FOR RARE DEER
Outside the tropics, rainforests are a rarity in the
world. The Valdivia ancient forest in Chile is the secondlargest temperate rainforest on earth. Despite beingisolated, the Chilean jungle is, however, not far enoughaway from the rest of the world to be safe from
destruction. At the same time, its bio-geographical iso-lation prevents plants and animals migrating there. As a result, a unique spectrum of species, with unusu-ally high biodiversity for such a climate zone, has developed in Chile. Some alerce trees (conifers) havebeen found to be more than 3.600 years old.Most of this forest has already been cut down or damaged, and the last intact ar eas are thr eatened by
the timber industry. In the 1990s Chile did almostnothing to protect its ancient forests. On the contrary,from 1996 to 1998 the production of industrial roundwood increased by 83 per cent compared to theprevious decade.The huemel, the deer on the Chilean coat of arms,used to be found from the flat coastal regions of Chile
and the Argentinian Patagonia to the Andes. Today it lives in just a fraction of its original range, at heightsbetween 3.300 and 5.000 metres. Its population isestimated to be a few thousand.A glimpse at the map of the country shows that Chilereally does, as travel agents claim, lie at the »end of the world«. With the Pacific Ocean on one side andthe snow-covered 6.000-metres peaks of the Andes 
on the other, it is, in effect, a bio-geographical island.
METHOD
The study is based on the digital information generated
by a project car ried out for the Chilean government
agency r esponsible for forest management. This data-
base contains the most recent and complete informa-Ancient for ests are at greatest risk in:
• Coastal mountain range forests, which house 7.5
per cent of Chile’s remaining ancient forests. Theyhouse a rich and diverse range of species. Themajor threats to these for ests are non-native planta-
tion developments, inadequate enforcement of regulations, and plans for a new coastal highway.
• In the nor thern r egions, where only few of the 
native forests remain as ancient forest, mostlyunprotected. Most of the countries forest industriesare concentrated in this region.
Selective logging is the most frequent cause of nativeforest degradation, accounting for 75 per cent ofdegraded forest area.Over a tenth of Chile’s forest has been conver ted 
to plantations, most of which are dominated by exoticspecies.Because the information used for this study covers theperiod 1994-1997, an update is ur gently needed to
obtain a more accurate picture of what is happen ing on
the gr ound.
Many ancient forests
are in areas withsteep slopes or locat-ed at high altitudes.As such, they areparticularly sensitiveto human disturbance.

and corruption are the norm. Over two-thirds of the tim-
ber processed in Indonesian saw-mills has been illegallylogged. W orld Bank advisors have confirmed that the
timber industry in these ar eas is in an »anar chic« state.
SOURCES OF DATA AND DIFFICULTIES
The report suf fers from all the imperfections of the 
information sources: missing data, often outdated,sometimes conflicting. The exact extent and distribu-tion of Indonesia’s forests still cannot be mapped. No integrated record of for est area has been kept in 
Indonesia, so any analysis must be based on a varietyof national and subnational scale sources. A majorproblem in dealing with these datasets is their lack ofdirect comparability. But that is not all. Until r ecently,
researchers had to deal with government secrecy,bureaucratic confusion, and intimidation by industry.And last but not least, private citizens who attempt to monitor illegal corporate activity still face consid-erable risks.
FINDINGS
The analysis indicates that a total of just over 52 mil-
lion hectares may be defined as potentially intactancient forest. A further 33 million hectares meet theTHE JUNGLE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA, WHERE
ORANG-UTANS ARE DYING WITH THE TREES
The island chains of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea
stretch between the mainland of Asia and Australia. Thespectrum of spectacular ancient forests there ranges
from bays surrounded by mangr oves through tropical
jungle to r hododendron forests on the mountain-sides.
The Indonesian ancient forest is also where the lastorang-utans, the ape which already has a history of 15 million years on earth, has its place of refuge.Orang-utans (the name means forest people) grow tofive feet tall and weigh 100 kilos and are fully adaptedto a life in the trees. In the last decade, the wild population shrunk by half. There are probably fewer than 30.000 orang-utans today climbing hand overhand through the last rainforests in Indonesia.Logging and large-scale resettlement programmes havedestroyed large parts of the rainforest. In the lastthree decades of rule by the Suharto clan, the foresthas been systematically plundered. Tensions betweenthe new settlers and the gr oups of peoples alr eady 
living there regularly lead to confr ontations. On Irian
Jaya,  protests by indigenous peoples against thedestruction of nature have been crushed by the mili-tary. Even after the old guard in power in Indonesia hadbeen replaced, economic problems and outbreaks of violence have put environmental issues right to thebottom of the new politicians’ agenda.Indonesia loses many thousands of square kil ometres

within logging concessions. It may be assumed thatmuch of this forest area is far from intact.
Indonesia is experiencing one of the highest rates of tropical forest loss in the world: Fourty per cent ofthe forests existing in 1950 were cleared in the following 50 years. About one million hectares per yearwere cleared in the 1980s. Since 1996, defor esta-
tion appears to have increased to an average of twomillion hectares per year. Only one century ago 
forest cover was estimated at being about 170 millionhectar es. Today it is appr oximately 98 million hectares,
at least half of which is believed to be degraded byhuman activity.Deforestation in Indonesia is lar gely the r esult of a cor-
rupt political and economic system that r egarded
forests as a source of r evenue to be exploited for polit-
ical ends and personal gain. Logging concessions covering more than half the country’s total forest areawere awarded by ex-pr esident Suharto, many of 
them to his relatives and political allies.Illegal logging has reached epidemic pr oportions. 
Aggressive expansion of Indonesia’s pulp and paper
industries over the past decade has created an enormous level of demand for wood fibre that cannot
currently be met by sustainable domestic forest management. The gap is filled by illegally cut wood,which accounted for approximately 65 per cent of total supply in 2000.

The Amazon is the earth’s biggest area of 
tropical ancient forest and home of the jaguar
With an area as big as the United States, the Amazon
rainforest is the biggest area of tropical ancient forest in the world. Roughly half of all the world’sspecies of animals and plants living on land, scien-tists estimate, live here. Giant trees wrapped ar ound
by lianas, overgrown ar eas of water and incessant 
chirping, fluttering, screeching and meandering move-ment of life make the Amazon forest the paradigmexample of luxuriant rainforest.The Amazon region is also the last big r eserve of 
the jaguar, which lives in the ancient for ests of South
and Central America. This wild cat, which needs a territorial area of as much as 40 square kilometres
(15 square miles), is under threat, and is listed as
167
 THE AMAZON RAINFOREST
threatened species in the Washington convention on
wild fauna and flora. The greatest threat to the jaguaris the irreversible destruction of the forests. But despite its natural tr easures this area is more 
endangered as ever before. 128.000 square kilometres
of South American rainforest fell victim to chain-saws between 1990 and 1995 – an area equivalent to that of Austria and Switzerland together.
Situation in the forests
And to be able to get at the valuable trees scattered
about in the rainforest, corridors into the forest have been cut and roads built. This means that forevery valuable tree many other giant tr ees fall 
victim to logging and r emoval. In addition, mining com-panies are dr edging whole river deltas, and the mer-
cury used in gold-washing is polluting water and soils.The Brazilian environment authorities have too small resources in personnel and are too poorly equipped to
be able to move against internationally active timbercorporations in this huge area. As a result 80 per centof timber is felled illegally, without a logging con-cession. Despite the publication of this figure by theBrazilian authorities, demand for cheap plywood from Brazil has remained undiminished. The govern-ments of the main impor ting countries, the USA, 
Italy, France and Japan, have made no significant
efforts to stop the illegal destruction of the rainforest or to see the Brazilian government obligated to makingthe timber industry more environmentally friendly.For the amazon no
maps are available at

Some 30 countries throughout eastern and western
Europe have no intact ancient forests left. OnlyEuropean Russia r etains extensive intact ancient
forests and even these are under serious thr eat 
from industrial logging.
Some r egions of the Snow Forests of Asian Russia
have already been logged out. Mining and otherresource extraction pose serious threats to theseforests.
Only a quarter of all chilian forest is in relatively undis-
turbed tracts of at least 10.000 ha.
Indonesia is experiencing one of the highest rates 
of tropical forest loss in the world: fourty per cent of
the forests existing in 1950 where cleared in the following 50 years.About 80% of the world’s original forests are gone. 
That we know and we cannot change. The world’s ancient for ests are facing a crisis.
There is an urgent need to pr otect the ecological
integrity of the remaining ancient forests for this andfuture generations. 
If humankind is to pr otect ancient forest biodiversity
and traditional cultures, ancient for est loss must be
stopped during the coming decade.
World governments must choose now to save the 
world’s r emaining ancient forestsFifteen percent of the Amazon Rainforest has alr eady
been destr oyed. A significant part of what r emains is
under dir ect thr eat.
Fourty per cent of the remaining potentially intact
ancient forests in Central Africa are within commer cial
logging concessions. The future is uncertain for thecreatures and peoples who depend on these forests.
In North America, at least 12.3 million hectares of nat-
ural ancient forest have been lost between 1990 and 2000. The United States has refused tomake a formal commitment to the CBD and by doing so is refusing to commit to saving its remainingbiological and cultural diversity.
