False Hope
Why carbon capture
and storage won't
save the climate

Executive
Summary

Executive
summary

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) aims to reduce the climate
impact of burning fossil fuels by capturing carbon dioxide (CO2)
from power station smokestacks and disposing of it underground.
Its future development has been widely promoted by the coal
industry as a justification for the construction of new coal-fired
power plants. However, the technology is largely unproven and will
not be ready in time to save the climate.

This report, based on peer-reviewed independent
scientific research shows that:

CCS cannot deliver in time to avoid dangerous
climate change. The earliest possibility for deployment
of CCS at utility scale is not expected before 2030.1 To
avoid the worst impacts of climate change, global
greenhouse gas emissions have to start falling after 2015,
just seven years away.

CCS wastes energy. The technology uses between 10
and 40% of the energy produced by a power station.2
Wide scale adoption of CCS is expected to erase the
efficiency gains of the last 50 years, and increase
resource consumption by one third.3

Storing carbon underground is risky. Safe and
permanent storage of CO2 cannot be guaranteed. Even
very low leakage rates could undermine any climate
mitigation efforts.

CCS is expensive. It could lead to a doubling of plant
costs, and an electricity price increase of 21-91%.4
Money spent on CCS will divert investments away from
sustainable solutions to climate change.

CCS carries significant liability risks. It poses a threat
to health, ecosystems and the climate. It is unclear how
severe these risks will be.

The climate crisis requires urgent action. Climate scientists
warn that to avoid the worst effects, global greenhouse
gas emissions must peak by 2015 and then start falling by
at least 50% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. Coal is
the most polluting of all fossil fuels, and the single greatest
threat to the climate. If current plans to invest hundreds of
billions of dollars in coal plants are realised, CO2 emissions
from coal could increase 60% by 2030.

Concerns about the feasibility, costs, safety, and liability of
CCS make it a dangerous gamble. A survey of 1000
“climate decision-makers and influencers” around the
world reveals substantial doubt in the ability of CCS to
deliver. Just 34% were confident that retrofitting ‘clean
coal technology’ to existing power plants could reduce
CO2 emissions over the next 25 years without
unacceptable side effects, and only 36% were confident
in its ability to deliver low-carbon energy from new power
stations.5

The real solutions to stopping dangerous climate change
lie in renewable energy and energy efficiency that can start
protecting the climate today. Huge reductions in energy
demand are possible with efficiency measures that save
more money than they cost to implement. Technically
accessible renewable energy sources – such as wind,
wave and solar- are capable of providing six times more
energy than the world currently consumes – forever.

“CCS will arrive on the battlefield far too
late to help the world avoid dangerous
climate change.”7

Greenpeace’s Energy [R]evolution6 provides a practical
blueprint that shows how renewable energy, combined
with greater energy efficiency, can cut global CO2
emissions by almost 50%, and deliver half the world’s
energy needs by 2050.

What is CCS?

CCS is an integrated process, made up of three distinct
parts: carbon capture, transport, and storage (including
measurement, monitoring and verification).

Capture technology aims to produce a concentrated
stream of CO2 that can be compressed, transported, and
stored. Transport of captured CO2 to storage locations is
most likely to be via pipeline.

Storage of the captured carbon is the final part of the
process. The vast majority of CO2 storage is expected to
occur in geological sites on land, or below the seabed.
Disposing of waste CO2 in the ocean has also been
proposed but this method has been largely discounted due
to the significant impacts CO2 would have on the ocean
ecosystem and legal constraints that effectively prohibit it.

CCS cannot deliver in time

The urgency of the climate crisis means solutions must be
ready for large-scale use as soon as possible. CCS simply
cannot deliver in time. As the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) says “CCS will arrive on the battlefield
far too late to help the world avoid dangerous climate
change”8 At present, there are no large-scale coal-fired
power plants in the world capturing carbon, let alone any
that are integrated with storage operations.9

The earliest CCS may be technically feasible at utility scale
is 2030.10 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) does not expect CCS to become
commercially viable until at least the second half of this
century.11 Even then, plants responsible for 40-70% of
electricity sector CO2 emissions will not be suitable for
carbon capture’.12

Despite this, CCS is being used as an excuse by power
companies and utilities to push ahead with plans to build
new coal-fired power plants; branding them “capture-
ready.” The International Energy Agency (IEA) describes a
“capture-ready” plant as one “which can be retrofitted
with CO2 capture when the necessary regulatory or
economic drivers are in place”.13 This definition is broad
enough to make any station theoretically “capture-ready”,
and the term meaningless.

4

The very real danger of “capture-ready” power stations is
that promises to retrofit are unlikely to be kept. Retrofits
are very expensive and can carry such high efficiency
losses that plants become uneconomic.14 Furthermore,
even if a plant is technically suitable for carbon capture
there is no guarantee that there will be accessible
storage locations.

In the UK, a proposed new coal-fired power plant at
Kingsnorth, Kent, is being sold as “capture ready”; able to
incorporate CCS should the technology ever become
available in the future. However, no one has any idea if
and when this might be. In the meantime, and possibly for
its entire lifetime, Kingsnorth (if built) will pump out around
8 million tonnes of CO2 per year, an amount equivalent to
the total annual CO2 emissions of Ghana.15

If CCS is ever able to deliver at all, it will be too little,
too late.

CCS wastes energy

Capturing and storing carbon uses lots of energy,
anywhere from 10-40% of a power station’s capacity.16 An
energy penalty of just 20% would require the construction
of an extra power station for every four built.17

These reductions in efficiency will require more coal to be
mined, transported, and burned, for a power station to
produce the same amount of energy as it did without
CCS.

CCS will also use more precious resources. Power
stations with capture technology will need 90% more
freshwater than those without. This will worsen water
shortages, already aggravated by climate change.18
Overall, wide-scale adoption of CCS is expected to erase
the efficiency gains of the last 50 years, and increase
resource consumption by one third.19

Storing carbon underground is risky

The IEA estimates that for CCS to deliver any meaningful
climate mitigation effects by 2050, 6000 projects each
injecting a million tonnes of CO2 per year into the ground
would be required.20 At the moment, it is not clear that it
will be technically feasible to capture and bury this much
carbon, i.e. whether there are enough storage sites, or that
they will be located close enough to power plants.
Transport of CO2 over distances greater than 100
kilometres is likely to be prohibitively expensive.21

Efforts to capture CO2 make no sense if there is not
adequate accessible space to store it permanently. Even if
it is feasible to bury hundreds of thousands of gigatonnes
of CO2 there is no way to guarantee that storage locations
will be appropriately designed and managed over the
timescales required.

As long as CO2 is in geological sites, there is a risk of
leakage. While it is not currently possible to quantify the
exact risks, any CO2 release has the potential to impact
the surrounding environment; air, groundwater or soil.
Continuous leakage, even at rates as low as 1%, could
negate climate mitigation efforts.22 Remediation may be
possible for CO2 leaks, but there is no track record or cost
estimates for these measures.23

A natural example of the danger of CO2 leakage occurred
at Lake Nyos, Cameroon in 1986. Following a volcanic
eruption, large quantities of CO2 that had accumulated on
the bottom of the lake were suddenly release, killing 1700
people and thousands of cattle over a range of 25 km.24

In the US, the Department of Energy has asked for a
26.4% budget increase for CCS-related programmes (to
US$623.6 million) while at the same time scaling back
renewable energy and efficiency research by 27.1% (to
US$146.2 million). 29 Australia has three research centres
for fossil fuels, including one committed to CCS; there is
not one for renewable energy technology.30 The
Norwegian government recently committed 20 billion
NOK (US$4 billion) for two CCS projects at the expense
of investment in renewable technologies.

Spending money on CSS is diverting urgent funding away
from renewable energy solutions for the climate crisis.
Even assuming that at some stage carbon capture
becomes technically feasible, commercially viable,
capable of long-term storage and environmentally safe, it
would still only have a limited impact and would come at a
high cost. In contrast, as Greenpeace’s Futu[r]e
Investment report shows, investing in a renewable energy
future would save US$180 billion annually and cut CO2
emissions in half by 2050.31

CCS is expensive and undermines funding
for sustainable solutions

CCS and liability: risky business

Large-scale applications of CCS pose significant liability
risks, including negative health effects and damage to
ecosystems, groundwater contamination including
pollution of drinking water, and increased greenhouse gas
emissions resulting from leakage. There is no reliable
basis for estimating the probability or severity of these
risks. As current regulations are not designed to
adequately manage them, significant questions as to who
is liable remain unanswered 32

Industry views liability as a barrier to wider deployment of
CCS33 and is unwilling to fully invest in CCS without a
framework that protects it from long-term liability. The risk
is so great that some utilities are unwilling to make CO2
available for storage unless they are relieved of ownership
upon transfer of the CO2 off the property of the power
station.34 Potential operators are urging that they only
retain legal liability for permanently stored carbon for ten
years.35

While cost estimates for CCS vary considerably, one thing
is certain – it is extremely expensive.

CCS will require significant funding to construct the power
station and necessary infrastructure to transport and store
carbon. Existing policy mechanisms, such as a price on
carbon, would need to be significantly increased (by as
much as five times higher than their current levels) and
supplemented by additional policy commitments and
financial incentives.25

The US Department of Energy (US DOE) calculates that
installing carbon capture systems will almost double plant
costs.26 This will lead to electricity price hikes of anywhere
between 21 and 91%.27

Providing the substantial levels of support needed to get
CCS off the ground comes at the expense of real
solutions. Current research shows electricity generated
from coal-fired power stations equipped with CCS will be
more expensive than other less-polluting sources, such as
wind power and many types of sustainable biomass.28

In recent years, coal’s share of research and development
budgets in countries pursuing CCS has ballooned.
Meanwhile, funding for renewable technologies and
efficiency has stagnated or declined.

A survey of 1000 “climate decision-makers and influencers” around
the world reveals substantial doubt about CCS. Just 34% were
confident that retrofitting ‘clean coal technology’ could reduce CO2
emissions over the next 25 years without unacceptable side effects,
and only 36% were confident in its ability to deliver low carbon
energy with new power stations. In contrast, 74% expressed
confidence in solar hot water, 62% in offshore wind farms, and 60%
in onshore wind farms.36

Many nations have recognised the potential of these true
climate solutions and are pressing ahead with ambitious
plans for energy revolutions within their borders. New
Zealand plans to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-
century. Renewable energy and energy efficiency, not
CCS, are leading the way. New Zealand already obtains
70% of its electricity from renewable resources and aims
to increase it to 90% by 2025.43 In Germany, renewable
energy use has increased 300% in the past 10 years. In
the US, over 5,200 megawatts (MW) of wind energy were
installed in 2007, accounting for 30% of new power
installed that year; an increase of 45% in one year.44

The urgency of the climate crisis means solutions must be
ready for large-scale deployment in the short-term. CCS
simply cannot deliver in time. The technology is highly
speculative, risky and unlikely to be technically feasible in
the next twenty years. Letting CCS be used as a
smokescreen for building new coal-fired power stations is
unacceptable and irresponsible. “Capture ready” coal
plants pose a significant threat to the climate.

The world can fight climate change but only if it reduces
its dependence on fossil fuels, particularly coal.
Renewable energy and energy efficiency are safe, cost-
effective solutions that carry none of the risks of CCS, and
are available today to cut emissions and save the climate.

CCS proponents are demanding almost complete legal
protection from governments, including mechanisms that
completely shield operators from legal challenges, transfer
ownership to government and/or limit the amount of
money that can be recouped should damage occur.37 It is
expected that the public will assume the risk for, and pay
for the damages resulting from, CO2 storage projects.

The extent of support offered to the recently collapsed
FutureGen project in the US gives some idea of the real
costs of CCS. FutureGen was the Bush Administration’s
flagship CCS project, a public-private partnership between
the US government and industry giants including Rio Tinto
and American Electric Power Service Corp. FutureGen not
only was promised unprecedented public funds (to the
tune of US$1.3 billion) but was also protected from
financial and legal liability in the event of an unanticipated
release of carbon dioxide,38 indemnified from lawsuits, and
even had its insurance policies paid for.39

The world already has the solutions
to the climate crisis

Investment in CCS risks locking the world into an energy
future that fails to save the climate. Those technologies
with the greatest potential to provide energy security and
reduce emissions, and to provide renewable energy and
energy efficiency, need to be prioritised.

Greenpeace’s Energy [R]evolution blueprint shows how
renewable energy, combined with greater energy
efficiency, can cut global CO2 emissions by almost 50%,
and deliver half the world’s energy needs by 2050.40

The renewable energy market is booming; in 2007, global
annual investment in renewables exceeded US$100
billion.41 Decades of technological progress have seen
renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines,
solar photovoltaic panels, biomass power plants and solar
thermal collectors move steadily into the mainstream. The
same climate decision-makers who were sceptical about
CCS believed far more in the ability of renewable
technologies to deliver reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions: 74% expressed confidence in solar hot water,
62% in offshore wind farms, and 60% in onshore wind
farms.42
