glossary & appendix 188Impacts of climate change are diverse and serious, and unless the
emissions of GHGs are effectively mitigated these would threaten tobecome far more serious over time. There is now, therefore, a renewedinterest in renewable sources of energy, because by creating and usinglow carbon substitutes to fossil fuels, we may be able to reduce emissionsof GHGs significantly while at the same time ensuring economic growthand development and the enhancement of human welfare across theworld. As it happens, there are major disparities in the levels ofconsumption of energy across the world, with some countries using largequantities per capita and others being deprived of any sources of modernenergy forms. Solutions in the future would, therefore, also have to cometo grips with the reality of lack of access to modern forms of energy forhundreds of millions of people. For instance, there are 1.6 billion peoplein the world who have no access to electricity. Households, in which thesepeople reside, therefore, lack a single electric bulb for lighting purposes,and whatever substitutes they use provide inadequate lighting andenvironmental pollution, since these include inefficient lighting devicesusing various types of oil or the burning of candles. Future policies can be guided by the consideration of different
scenarios that can be linked to specific developments. This publicationadvocates the need for something in the nature of an energyrevolution. This is a view that is now shared by several people acrossthe world, and it is also expected that energy plans would be based ona clear assessment of specific scenarios related to clearly identifiedpolicy initiatives and technological developments. This edition ofEnergy [R]evolution Scenarios provides a detailed analysis of theenergy efficiency potential and choices in the transport sector . Thematerial presented in this publication provides a useful basis forconsidering specific policies and developments that would be of valuenot only to the world but for different countries as they attempt tomeet the global challenge confronting them. The work carried out inthe following pages is comprehensive and rigorous, and even thosewho may not agree with the analysis presented would, perhaps, benefitfrom a deep study of the underlying assumptions that are linked withspecific energy scenarios for the future.

6GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
Energy supply has become a subject of major universal concern.
High and volatile oil and gas prices, threats to a secure and stablesupply and not least climate change have all pushed it high up theinternational agenda. In order to avoid dangerous climate change,global CO
2emissions must peak no later than 2015 and rapidly
decrease after that. The technology to do this is available. Therenewables industry is ready for take off and opinion polls showthat the majority of people support this move. There are no realtechnical obstacles in the way of an Energy [R]evolution, all that ismissing is political support. But we have no time to waste. Toachieve an emissions peak by 2015 and a net reduction afterwards,we need to start rebuilding the energy sector now.An overwhelming consensus of scientific opinion now agrees that
climate change is happening, is caused in large part by humanactivities (such as burning fossil fuels), and if left unchecked willhave disastrous consequences. Furthermore, there is solid scientificevidence that we should act now. This is reflected in the conclusions,published in 2007, of the Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange (IPCC), a UN institution of more than 1,000 scientistsproviding advice to policy makers. 
The effects of climate change have in fact already begun. In 2008,
the melting of the Arctic ice sheet almost matched the record seton September 16, 2007. The fact that this has now happened twoyears in a row reinforces the strong decreasing trend in the amountof summertime ice observed over the past 30 years.

7In response to this threat, the Kyoto Protocol has committed its
signatories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% fromtheir 1990 levels by 2008-2012. The Kyoto signatories arecurrently negotiating the second phase of the agreement, cov ering
the period from 2013-2017. Time is quickly running out. Signatorycountries agreed a negotiating ‘mandate’, known as the Bali ActionPlan, which they must complete with a final agreement on thesecond Kyoto commitment period by the end of 2009. By choosingrenewable energy and energy efficiency, developing countries canvirtually stabilise their CO
2emissions, whilst at the same time
increasing energy consumption through economic growth. OECDcountries, on the other hand, will have to reduce their emissions byup to 80%. The Energy [R]evolution concept provides a practicalblueprint on how to put this into practice.
Renewable energy, combined with the smart use of energy, can
deliver at least half of the world’s energy needs by 2050. Thisreport, ‘Energy [R]evolution: A Sustainable World Energy Outlook’,shows that it is economically beneficial to cut global CO
2emissions
by over 50% within the next 42 years. It also concludes that amassive uptake of renewable energy sources is technically andeconomically possible. Wind power alone could produce about 40times more power than it does today, and total global renewableenergy generation could quadruple by then. 
renewed energy [r]evolution
This is the second edition of the Energy [R]evolution. Since wepublished the first edition in January 2007, we have experienced anoverwhelming wave of support from governments, the renewablesindustry and non-governmental organisations. Since than we havebroken down the global regional scenarios into country specificplans for Canada, the USA, Brazil, the European Community, Japanand Australia, among many others. 
More and more countries are seeing the environmental and
economic benefits provided by renewable energy. The Brent crude oilprice was at $55 per barrel when we launched the first Energy[R]evolution report. Since than the price has only headed in onedirection - upwards! By mid-2008 it had reached a peak of over$140 per barrel and has subsequently stabilised at around $100.Other fuel prices have also shot up. Coal, gas and uranium havedoubled or even tripled in the same timeframe. By contrast, mostrenewable energy sources don’t need any fuel. Once installed, theydeliver energy independently from the global energy markets and atpredictable prices. Every day that another community switches torenewable energy is an independence day. 
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario concludes that the restructuring
of the global electricity sector requires an investment of $14.7trillion up to 2030. This compares with $11.3 trillion under theReference Scenario based on International Energy Agencyprojections. While the average annual investment required toimplement the Energy [R]evolution Scenario would need just under1% of global GDP , it would lower fuel costs by 25% - saving anannual amount in the range of $750 billion.

ON GREENLAND’S COAST. 
In fact, the additional costs for coal power generation alone from today
up to 2030 under the Reference Scenario could be as high as US$15.9 billion: this would cover the entire investment needed in renewableand cogeneration capacity to implement the Energy [R]evolutionScenario. These renewable sources will produce energy without anyfurther fuel costs beyond 2030, while the costs for coal and gas willcontinue to be a burden on national and global economies.
global energy scenario
The European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) and GreenpeaceInternational have produced this global energy scenario as apractical blueprint for how to urgently meet CO
2reduction targets
and secure an affordable energy supply on the basis of steadyworldwide economic development. Both of these goals are possibleat the same time. The urgent need for change in the energy sectormeans that this scenario is based only on proven and sustainabletechnologies, such as renewable energy sources and efficientdecentralised cogeneration. It therefore excludes so-called ‘CO
2-free
coal power plants’, which are not in fact CO 2free and would create
another burden in trying to store the gas under the surface of theEarth with unknown consequences. For multiple safety andenvironmental reasons, nuclear energy is also excluded. 
Commissioned from the Department of Systems Analysis and
Technology Assessment (Institute of Technical Thermodynamics) atthe German Aerospace Centre (DLR), the report develops a globalsustainable energy pathway up to 2050. The future potential forrenewable energy sources has been assessed with input from allsectors of the renewables industry around the world. The newEnergy [R]evolution Scenario also takes a closer look for the firsttime at the transport sector , including future technologies and howto implement energy efficiency. 
The energy supply scenarios adopted in this report, which extend
beyond and enhance projections made by the International EnergyAgency, have been calculated using the MESAP/PlaNet simulationmodel. The demand side projection has been developed by theEcofys consultancy to take into account the future potential forenergy efficiency measures. This study envisages an ambitiousdevelopment pathway for the exploitation of energy efficiencypotential, focused on current best practice as well as technologiesavailable in the future. The result is that under the Energy[R]evolution Scenario, worldwide final energy demand can bereduced by 38% in 2050 compared to the Reference Scenario.“renewable energy, combined 
with the smart use of energy, can deliver half of the world’senergy needs by 2050.”

8GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
the potential for renewable energy
The good news is that the global market for renewables is booming.
Decades of technical progress have seen renewable energytechnologies such as wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels,biomass power plants, solar thermal collectors and many othersmove steadily into the mainstream. The global market for renewableenergy is growing dramatically; in 2007 its turnover was over aUS$ 70 billion, almost twice as high as the previous year . The timewindow for making the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy,however , is still relatively short. Within the next decade many of theexisting power plants in the OECD countries will come to the end oftheir technical lifetime and will need to be replaced. But a decisiontaken to construct a coal or gas power plant today will result in theproduction of CO
2emissions and dependency on the resource and its
future costs lasting until 2050. 
The power industry and utilities need to take more responsibility
because today’s investment decisions will define the energy supplyof the next generation. We strongly believe that this should be the‘solar generation’. Politicians from the industrialised world urgentlyneed to rethink their energy strategy, while the developing worldshould learn from past mistakes and build economies on the strongfoundations of a sustainable energy supply. 
Renewable energy could more than double its share of the world’s
energy supply - reaching up to 30% by 2030. All that is lacking isthe political will to promote its large scale deployment in allsectors at a global level, coupled with far reaching energy efficiencymeasures. By 2030 about half of global electricity could come fromrenewable energies.
The future of renewable energy development will strongly depend
on political choices made by both ind ividual governments and the
international community. At the same time strict technicalstandards will ensure that only the most efficient fridges, heatingsystems, computers and vehicles will be on sale. Consumers have aright to buy products that don’t increase their energy bills andwon’t destroy the climate. 
In this report we have also expanded the time horizon for the
Energy [R]evolution concept beyond 2050, to see when we couldphase out fossil fuels entirely. Once the pathway of this scenario hasbeen implemented, renewable energy could provide all global energyneeds by 2090. A more radical scenario – which takes the advancedprojections of the renewables industry into account – could evenphase out coal by 2050. Dangerous climate change might force usto accelerate the development of renewables faster . We believe thatthis would be possible, but to achieve it more resources must gointo research and development. Climate change and scarcity offossil fuel resources puts our world as we know it at risk; we muststart to think the unthinkable. To tap into the fast potential forrenewables and to phase out fossil fuels as soon as possible areamongst the most pressing tasks for the next generation ofengineers and scientists. implementing the energy [r]evolution
Business as usual is not an option for future generations. TheReference Scenario based on the IEA’s ‘World Energy Outlook2007’ projection would almost double global CO
2emissions by
2050 and the climate would heat up by well over 2°C. This wouldhave catastrophic consequences for the environment, the economyand human society. In addition, it is worth rememb ering that the
former chief economist of the World Bank, Sir Nicholas Stern,pointed out clearly in his landmark report that the countries whichinvest in energy saving technologies and renewable energies todaywill be the economic winners of tomorrow.
As Stern emphasised, inaction will be much more expensive in the
long run. We therefore call on all decision makers yet again tomake this vision a reality. The world cannot afford to stick to the‘business as usual’ energy development path: relying on fossil fuels,nuclear energy and other outdated technologies. Renewable energycan and will play a leading role in our collective energy future. Forthe sake of a sound environment, political stability and th riving
economies, now is the time to commit to a truly secure andsustainable energy future – a future built on clean technologies,economic development and the creation of millions of new jobs.

9climate threats and climate solutions
Global climate change caused by the relentless build-up of
greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere is already disruptingecosystems, resulting in about 150,000 additional deaths each year .An average global wa rming of 2°C threatens millions of people with
an increased risk of hunger , malaria, flooding and water shortages.If rising temperatures are to be kept within acceptable limits thenwe need to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Thismakes both environmental and economic sense. The maingreenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO
2) produced by using fossil
fuels for energy and transport.climate change and security of supply
Spurred by recent large increases in the price of oil, the issue ofsecurity of supply is now at the top of the energy policy agenda.One reason for these price increases is the fact that supplies of allfossil fuels – oil, gas and coal – are becoming scarcer and moreexpensive to produce. The days of ‘cheap oil and gas’ are coming toan end. Uranium, the fuel for nuclear power , is also a finiteresource. By contrast, the reserves of renewable energy that aretechnically accessible globally are large enough to provide about sixtimes more power than the world currently consumes - forever .
Renewable energy technologies vary widely in their technical and
economic maturity, but there are a range of sources which offerincreasingly attractive options. These include wind, biomass,photovoltaic, solar thermal, geothermal, ocean and hydroelectricpower . Their common feature is that they produce little or nogreenhouse gases, and rely on virtually inexhaustible naturalsources for their ‘fuel’. Some of these technologies are alreadycompetitive. Their economics will further improve as they developtechnically, as the price of fossil fuels continues to rise and as theirsaving of carbon dioxide emissions is given a monetary value.

10GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
At the same time there is enormous potential for reducing our
consumption of energy, while providing the same level of energyservices. This study details a series of energy efficiency measureswhich together can substantially reduce demand in industry, homes,business and services.
Although nuclear power produces little carbon dioxide, there are
multiple threats to people and the environment from its operations.These include the risks and environmental damage from uraniummining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weaponsproliferation, the unsolved problem of nuclear waste and thepotential hazard of a serious accident. The nuclear option istherefore discounted in this analysis. The solution to our futureenergy needs lies instead in greater use of renewable energy sourcesfor both heat and power . 
the energy [r]evolution
The climate change imperative demands nothing short of an energyrevolution. At the core of this revolution will be a change in theway that energy is produced, distributed and consumed. 
the five key principles behind this shift will be to: 
Implement renewable solutions, especially through decentralised
energy systems 
Respect the natural limits of the environment 
Phase out dirty, unsustainable energy sources 
Create greater equity in the use of resources 
Decouple economic growth from the consumption of fossil fuels
Decentralised energy systems, where power and heat are produced
close to the point of final use, avoid the current waste of energyduring conversion and distribution. They will be central to the Energy[R]evolution, as will the need to provide electricity to the two billionpeople around the world to whom access is presently denied. 
Two scenarios up to the year 2050 are outlined in this report. The
Reference Scenario is based on the Reference Scenario publishedby the International Energy Agency in World Energy Outlook 2007,extrapolated forward from 2030. Compared to the 2004 IEAprojections, World Energy Outlook 2007 (WEO 2007) assumes aslightly higher average annual growth rate of world Gross DomesticProduct (GDP) of 3.6%, instead of 3.2%, over the period 2005-2030. At the same time, WEO 2007 expects final energyconsumption in 2030 to be 4% higher than in WEO 2004. 
China and India are expected to grow faster than other regions,
followed by the Developing Asia group of countries, Africa and theTransition Economies (mainly the former Soviet Union). The OECDshare of global purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted GDP willdecrease from 55% in 2005 to 29% by 2050.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has a target for worldwide
carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced by 50% below 1990 levelsby 2050, with per capita emissions reduced to less than 1.3 tonnesper year . This is necessary if the increase in global temperature is toremain below +2°C. A second objective is the global phasing out of
nuclear energy. To achieve these targets, the scenario ischaracterised by significant efforts to fully exploit the largepotential for energy efficiency. At the same time, all cost-effectiverenewable energy sources are accessed for both heat and electricitygeneration, as well as the production of sustainable bio fuels. 
Today, renewable energy sources account for 13% of the world’s
primary energy demand. Biomass, which is mostly used in the heatsector , is the main renewable energy source. The share of renewableenergies for electricity generation is 18%. The contribution ofrenewables to heat supply is around 24%, to a large extentaccounted for by traditional uses such as collected firewood. About80% of the primary energy supply today still comes from fossilfuels. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario describes a developmentpathway which turns the present situation into a sustainable energysupply through the following measures:
Exploitation of the existing large energy efficiency potentials will
ensure that primary energy demand increases only slightly - fromthe current 474,900 PJ/a (2005) to 480,860 PJ/a in 2050,compared to 867,700 PJ/a in the Reference Scenario. Thisdramatic reduction is a crucial prerequisite for achieving asignificant share of renewable energy sources in the overallenergy supply system, for compensating the phasing out ofnuclear energy and for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.
The increased use of combined heat and power generation (CHP)
also improves the supply system’s energy conversion efficiency,increasingly using natural gas and biomass. In the long term, thedecreasing demand for heat and the large potential for producingheat directly from renewable energy sources limits the furtherexpansion of CHP .
The electricity sector will be the pioneer of renewable energy
utilisation. By 2050, around 77% of electricity will be producedfrom renewable energy sources (including large hydro). Acapacity of 9,100 GW will produce 28,600 TWh/a renewableelectricity in 2050.
In the heat supply sector , the contribution of renewables will
increase to 70% by 2050. Fossil fuels will be increasinglyreplaced by more efficient modern technologies, in particularbiomass, solar collectors and geothermal.
Before sustainable bio fuels are introduced in the transport
sector , the existing large efficiency potentials have to beexploited. As biomass is mainly committed to stationaryapplications, the production of bio fuels is limited by theavailability of sustainable raw materials. Electric vehiclespowered by renewable energy sources, will play an increasinglyimportant role from 2020 onwards.
By 2050, 56% of primary energy demand will be covered by
renewable energy sources.
To achieve an economically attractive growth of renewable energy
sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is ofgreat importance. Such mobilisation depends on technical potentials,actual costs, cost reduction potentials and technological maturity.image IN 2005 THE WORST DROUGHT IN

11costs
The slightly higher electricity generation costs (compared to
conventional fuels) under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario arecompensated for , to a large extent, by reduced demand forelectricity. Assuming average costs of 3 cents/kWh forimplementing energy efficiency measures, the additional cost forelectricity supply under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario willamount to a maximum of $10 billion/a in 2010. These additionalcosts, which represent society’s investment in an environmentallybenign, safe and economic energy supply, continue to decrease after2010. By 2050 the annual costs of electricity supply will be $2,900billion/a below those in the Reference Scenario. 
It is assumed that average crude oil prices will increase from $52.5
per barrel in 2005 to $100 per barrel in 2010, and continue to riseto $140 per barrel in 2050. Natural gas import prices are expectedto increase by a factor of four between 2005 and 2050, while coalprices will nearly double, reaching $360 per tonne in 2050. A CO
2
‘price adder’ is applied, which rises from $10 per tonne of CO 2in
2010 to $50 per tonne of in 2050.
development of CO 2emissions
While CO 2emissions worldwide will double under the Reference
Scenario up to 2050, and are thus far removed from a sustainabledevelopment path, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they willdecrease from 24,350 million tonnes in 2003 to 10,590 m/t in2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 3.8 tonnes/capitato 1.2 t/capita. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and agrowing electricity demand, CO
2emissions will decrease enormously
in the electricity sector . In the long run efficiency gains and theincreased use of renewable electric vehicles, as well as a sharpexpansion in public transport, will even reduce CO
2emissions in the
transport sector . With a share of 35% of total emissions in 2050,the power sector will reduce significantly but remain the largestsource of CO
2emissions - followed by transport and industry.to make the energy [r]evolution real and to avoid
dangerous climate change, Greenpeace and ERECdemand for the energy sector that the followingpolicies and actions are implemented:
1.Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy. 
2.Internalise the external (social and environmental) costs ofenergy production through “cap and trade” emissions trading. 
3.Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consumingappliances, buildings and vehicles.
4.Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and combined heat and power generation.
5.Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to the grid for renewable power generators. 
6.Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example by feed-in tariff programmes.
7.Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to provide more environmental product information.
8.Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy and energy efficiency.

12GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
long term energy [r]evolution scenarios
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario outlines a sustainable pathway
for a new way of using and producing energy up to 2050.Greenpeace, the DLR and the renewable energy industry have nowdeveloped this scenario further towards a complete phasing out offossil fuels in the second half of this century. 
A long term scenario over almost 100 years cannot be exact.
Projections of economic growth rates, fossil fuel prices or theoverall energy demand are of course speculative and by no meansrepresent forecasts. A regional breakdown is also not possible assufficient technical data, such as exact wind speed data in specificlocations, is not available. The grid integration of huge percentagesof fluctuating sources such as wind and solar photovoltaics equallyneeds further scientific and technical research. But such a longterm scenario can give us an idea of by when a complete fossil fueland CO
2free energy supply at a global level is possible, and what
long term production capacities for renewable energy sources areneeded. In this context we developed two different long termscenarios: the long term Energy [R]evolution and the advancedEnergy [R]evolution. The long term scenario follows the sameprojections until the end of this century.
By 2050, renewable energy sources will account for more than
50% of the world’s primary energy demand in the Energy[R]evolution Scenario. Approximately 44% of primary energysupply in 2050 still comes from fossil fuels, mainly oil used in thetransport sector , followed by gas and coal in the power sector . 
The long term Energy [R]evolution Scenario continues the
development pathway up to 2100 with the following outcomes:
demand: Energy efficiency potentials are largely exploited and
primary energy demand therefore stabilises at 2060 levels.
power sector: The electricity sector will pioneer the fossil fuel
phase-out. By 2070 over 93% of electricity will be producedfrom renewable energy sources, with the remaining gas-firedpower plants mainly used for backup power . A capacity of 23,100GW will produce 56,800 TWh of renewable electricity in 2100 –17 times more than today.
From the currently available technologies, solar photovoltaics,
followed by wind power , concentrated solar power and geothermal,have the highest potentials in the power sector . The use of oceanenergy might be significantly higher , but with the current state ofdevelopment, the technical and economical potential remains unclear . heating and cooling: The increased use of combined heat and
power generation (CHP) in 2050 will remain at the same level upto 2070. It will then fall back slightly to its 2040 level (5,500TWh) until the end of this century, as the decreasing demand forheat and the large potential for producing heat directly fromrenewable energy sources, such as solar collectors andgeothermal, limits the further expansion of CHP .
In the heat supply sector , the contribution of renewables will
increase to 90% by 2080. A complete fossil fuels phase-out willbe realised shortly afterwards.
transport: Efficient use of transport systems will still be the
main way of limiting fuel use. Public transport systems willcontinue to be far more energy efficient than ind ividual vehicles.
However , we assume that cars will still be needed, especially inrural areas. Between 2050 and 2085 the use of oil in cars will bephased out completely and replaced mainly by electric vehicles.The electricity will come from renewable energy sources.
By 2080, about 90% of primary energy demand will be covered
by renewable energy sources; in 2090 the renewable share willreach 98.2%.
The advanced Energy [R]evolution Scenario takes a much more
radical approach to the climate crisis facing the world. In order topull the emergency brake on global emissions it therefore assumesmuch shorter technical lifetimes for coal-fired power plants - 20years instead of 40 years. This reduces global CO
2emissions even
faster and takes the latest evidence of greater climate sensitivityinto account. In order to fill the resulting gap, the annual growthrates of renewable energy sources, especially solar photovoltaics,wind and concentrated solar power plants, have been increased. 
Growth rates increase from 2020 onwards to 2050. These expanded
growth rates are in line with the current projections of the wind andsolar industry (see Global Wind Energy Outlook 2008, SolarGeneration 2008). So in the advanced scenario the capacities for solarand wind power generation appear 10 to 15 years earlier thanprojected in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. The expansion ofgeothermal co-generation has also been moved 20 years ahead of itsexpected take-off. All other results remain the same as in the Energy[R]evolution Scenario, with the only changes affecting the power sector .
The main change for the power sector in the advanced Energy
[R]evolution Scenario is that all conventional coal-fired powerplants are phased out by 2050. Between 2020 and 2050 a total ofabout 1,200 GW of capacity will be replaced by solar photovolatics,on- and offshore wind and concentrated solar power plants. By2050, 86% of electricity will be produced from renewable energysources and 96% by 2070. Again the remaining fossil fuel-basedpower production is from gas. Compared to the basic Energy[R]evolution Scenario the expected capacity of renewable energywill emerge 15 years ahead of schedule, while the overall level ofrenewable power generation from 2085 onwards will be the same.

13From the renewables industry perspective, these larger quantities
are able to be delivered. However , the advanced scenario requiresmore research and development into the large scale grid integrationof renewable energies as well as better regional meteorological datato optimise the mix of different sources. 
It is important to highlight that in the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario the majority of remaining coal power plants – which willbe replaced 20 years before the end of their technical lifetime – arein China and India. This means that in practice all coal powerplants built between 2005 and 2020 will be replaced by renewableenergy sources. To support the building of capacity in developingcountries significant new public financing, especially fromindustrialised countries, will be needed. It is vital that specificfunding mechanisms are developed under the international climatenegotiations that can assist the transfer of financial support toclimate change mitigation, including technology transfer .Greenpeace International has developed one option for how such afunding mechanism could work (see Chapter 2).
almost zero CO 2emissions by 2080
While worldwide CO 2emissions will decrease under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario from 10,589 million tonnes in 2050 (51%below 1990 levels) down to 425 m/t in 2090, the advancedscenario would reduce emissions even faster . By 2050, the advancedEnergy [R]evolution version would reduce CO
2emissions by 61%
below 1990 levels, and 80% below by the year 2075. Annual percapita emissions would drop below 1 t/capita in 2050 under theadvanced scenario, compared with around 2060 under the basicEnergy [R]evolution.
Further CO
2reductions between 2040 and 2080 are only possible
in the transport sector , as the major remaining emitters arecombustion engines in cars. It is not possible to replace theremaining fossil fuelled cars with electric vehicles as this woulddrive electricity demand up again. The increased demand cannot bemet by renewables in this timeframe since this would exceed growthrates and grid capacities based on today’s knowledge. The only wayto cut vehicle emissions further would be to reduce kilometresdriven by about 40% between 2040 and 2080.

16GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
The greenhouse effect is the process by which the atmosphere traps
some of the sun’s energy, warming the Earth and moderating our
climate. A human-driven increase in ‘greenhouse gases’ hasenhanced this effect artificially, raising global temperatures anddisrupting our climate. These greenhouse gases include carbondioxide, produced by burning fossil fuels and through deforestation,methane, released from agriculture, animals and landfill sites, andnitrous oxide, resulting from agricultural production plus a varietyof industrial chemicals. 
Every day we damage our climate by using fossil fuels (oil, coal and
gas) for energy and transport. As a result, climate change is alreadyimpacting on our lives, and is expected to destroy the livelihoods ofmany people in the developing world, as well as ecosystems andspecies, in the coming decades. We therefore need to significantlyreduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This makes bothenvironmental and economic sense. 
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the
United Nations forum for established scientific opinion, the world’stemperature is expected to increase over the next hundred years byup to 5.8°C. This is much faster than anything experienced so far inhuman history. The goal of climate policy should be to keep theglobal mean temperature rise to less than 2°C above pre-industriallevels. At 2°C and above, damage to ecosystems and disruption tothe climate system increases dramatically. We have very little timewithin which we can change our energy system to meet thesetargets. This means that global emissions will have to peak and startto decline by the end of the next decade at the latest.
Climate change is already harming people and ecosystems. Its
reality can be seen in disintegrating polar ice, thawing permafrost,dying coral reefs, rising sea levels and fatal heat waves. It is notonly scientists that are witnessing these changes. From the Inuit inthe far north to islanders near the Equator , people are alreadystruggling with the impacts of climate change. An average globalwarming of 2°C threatens millions of people with an increased riskof hunger , malaria, flooding and water shortages. Never before hashumanity been forced to grapple with such an immenseenvironmental crisis. If we do not take urgent and immediate actionto stop global wa rming, the damage could become irreversible. This
can only happen through a rapid reduction in the emission ofgreenhouse gases into the atmosphere.This is a summary of some likely effects if we allow
current trends to continue:
Likely effects of small to moderate warming Sea level rise due to melting glaciers and the thermal expansion
of the oceans as global temperature increases. Massive releasesof greenhouse gases from melting permafrost and dying forests. 
A greater risk of more extreme weather events such as
heatwaves, droughts and floods. Already, the global incidence of drought has doubled over the past 30 years. 
Severe regional impacts. In Europe, river flooding will increase,
as well as coastal flooding, erosion and wetland loss. Floodingwill also severely affect low-lying areas in developing countriessuch as Bangladesh and South China.
Natural systems, including glaciers, coral reefs, mangroves, alpine
ecosystems, boreal forests, tropical forests, prairie wetlands andnative grasslands will be severely threatened. 
Increased risk of species extinction and biodiversity loss. 
The greatest impacts will be on poorer countries in sub-Saharan
Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Andean South America aswell as small islands least able to protect themselves fromincreasing droughts, rising sea levels, the spread of disease anddecline in agricultural production. 
longer term catastrophic effects Warming from emissions may
trigger the irreversible meltdown of the Greenland ice sheet, addingup to seven metres of sea level rise over several centuries. Newevidence shows that the rate of ice discharge from parts of theAntarctic mean it is also at risk of meltdown. Slowing, shifting orshutting down of the Atlantic Gulf Stream current will havedramatic effects in Europe, and disrupt the global ocean circulationsystem. Large releases of methane from melting permafrost andfrom the oceans will lead to rapid increases of the gas in theatmosphere, and consequent wa rming. 1climate protection |EFFECTS

the kyoto protocol
Recognising these threats, the signatories to the 1992 UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed the KyotoProtocol in 1997. The Protocol finally entered into force in early2005 and its 165 member countries meet twice annually tonegotiate further refinement and development of the agreement.Only one major industrialised nation, the United States, has notratified Kyoto. 
The Kyoto Protocol commits its signatories to reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from their 1990 level by thetarget period of 2008-2012. This has in turn resulted in theadoption of a series of regional and national reduction targets. Inthe European Union, for instance, the commitment is to an overallreduction of 8%. In order to help reach this target, the EU hasalso agreed a target to increase its proportion of renewable energyfrom 6% to 12% by 2010. 
At present the Kyoto countries are negotiating the second phase of
the agreement, cov ering the period from 2013-2017. Greenpeace is
calling for industrialised country emissions to be reduced by 18%from 1990 levels for this second commitment period, and by 30%for the third period covering 2018-2022. Only with these cuts do
we stand a reasonable chance of meeting the 2°C target. 
The Kyoto Protocol’s architecture relies fundamentally on legally
binding emissions reduction obligations. To achieve these targets,carbon is turned into a commodity which can be traded. The aim isto encourage the most economically efficient emissions reductions,in turn leveraging the necessary investment in clean technologyfrom the private sector to drive a revolution in energy supply. 
Negotiators are running out of time, however . Signatory countries
agreed a negotiating ‘mandate’, known as the Bali Action Plan, inDecember 2007, but they must complete these negotiations with afinal agreement on the second Kyoto commitment period by the endof 2009 at the absolute latest. Forward-thinking nations can moveahead of the game by implementing strong domestic targets now,building the industry and skills bases that will deliver the transitionto a low-carbon society, and thereby provide a strong platform fromwhich to negotiate the second commitment period.1climate protection |KYOTO PROTOCOL

international energy policy 
At present, renewable energy generators have to compete with old
nuclear and fossil fuel power stations which produce electricity atmarginal costs because consumers and taxpayers have already paidthe interest and depreciation on the original investments. Politicalaction is needed to overcome these distortions and create a levelplaying field for renewable energy technologies to compete.
At a time when governments around the world are in the process of
liberalising their electricity markets, the increasing competitivenessof renewable energy should lead to higher demand. Without politicalsupport, however , renewable energy remains at a disadvantage,marginalised by distortions in the world’s electricity markets createdby decades of massive financial, political and structural support toconventional technologies. Developing renewables will thereforerequire strong political and economic efforts, especially throughlaws that guarantee stable tariffs over a period of up to 20 years.Renewable energy will also contribute to sustainable economicgrowth, high quality jobs, technology development, globalcompetitiveness and industrial and research leadership.
renewable energy targets
In recent years, in order to reduce greenhouse emissions as well asincrease energy security, a growing number of countries haveestablished targets for renewable energy. These are either expressedin terms of installed capacity or as a percentage of energyconsumption. These targets have served as important catalysts forincreasing the share of renewable energy throughout the world. 
A time period of just a few years is not long enough in the
electricity sector , however , where the investment horizon can be upto 40 years. Renewable energy targets therefore need to have short,medium and long term steps and must be legally binding in order tobe effective. They should also be supported by mechanisms such asfeed-in tariffs for renewable electricity generation. In order for theproportion of renewable energy to increase significantly, targetsmust be set in accordance with the local potential for eachtechnology (wind, solar , biomass etc) and be complemented bypolicies that develop the skills and manufacturing bases to deliverthe agreed quantity of renewable energy. 
In recent years the wind and solar power industries have shown
that it is possible to maintain a growth rate of 30 to 35% in therenewables sector . In conjunction with the European PhotovoltaicIndustry Association
1, the European Solar Thermal Power Industry
Association2and the Global Wind Energy Council3, the European
Renewable Energy Council and Greenpeace have documented thedevelopment of those industries from 1990 onwards and outlined aprognosis for growth up to 2020 and 2040. demands for the energy sector
Greenpeace and the renewables industry have a clearagenda for the policy changes which need to be madeto encourage a shift to renewable sources. The main demands are:
1.Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy. 
2.Internalise external (social and environmental) costs through“cap and trade” emissions trading. 
3.Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consumingappliances, buildings and vehicles.
4.Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy andcombined heat and power generation.
5.Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access tothe grid for renewable power generators. 
6.Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for examplethrough feed-in tariff payments.
7.Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to providemore environmental product information.
8.Increase research and development budgets for renewable energyand energy efficiency
Conventional energy sources receive an estimated $250-300 billion
4
in subsidies per year worldwide, resulting in heavily distorted markets.
Subsidies artificially reduce the price of power , keep renewable energyout of the market place and prop up non-competitive technologiesand fuels. Eliminating direct and indirect subsidies to fossil fuels andnuclear power would help move us towards a level playing field acrossthe energy sector . Renewable energy would not need special provisionsif markets factored in the cost of climate damage from greenhousegas pollution. Subsidies to polluting technologies are perverse in thatthey are economically as well as environmentally detrimental.Removing subsidies from conventional electricity would not only savetaxpayers’ money. It would also dramatically reduce the need forrenewable energy support.1climate protection |INTERNATIONAL POLICY - TARGETS - DEMANDS

20GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
This chapter outlines a Greenpeace proposal for a feed-in tariff
system in developing countries financed by emissions trading fromOECD countries.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario shows that renewable electricity
generation has huge environmental and economic benefits. However itsgeneration costs, especially in developing countries, will remain higherthan those of existing coal or gas-fired power stations for the next fiveto ten years. To bridge this gap between conventional fossil fuel-basedpower generation and renewables, a support mechanism is needed. 
The Feed in Tariff Fund Emissions Trading model (FFET) is a
concept conceived by Greenpeace International
5. The aim is the
expansion of renewable energy in developing countries withfinancial support from industrialised nations – a mechanism toimplement renewable energy technology transfer via future JointImplementation, Clean Development Mechanism projects orTechnology Transfer programmes under the Kyoto Protocol. Withthe Kyoto countries currently negotiating the second phase of theiragreement, cov ering the period from 2013-2017, the proposed
FFET mechanism could be used under all the existing flexiblemechanisms, auctioning cap & trade schemes or linked totechnology transfer projects. 
The thinking behind the FFET in a nutshell is to link the feed-in tariff
system, as it has been successfully applied in countries like Germanyand Spain, with emissions trading schemes such as the ETS inEurope through already established international funding channelssuch as development aid banks or the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.
bankable support schemes
Since the early development of renewable energies within the powersector , there has been an ongoing debate about the best and mosteffective type of support scheme. The European Commissionpublished a survey in December 2005 which provides a good overviewof the experience so far . According to this report, feed-in tariffs areby far the most efficient and successful mechanism. Globally morethan 40 countries have adopted some version of the system. 
Although the organisational form of these tariffs differs from
country to country, there are certain clear criteria which emerge asessential for creating a successful renewable energy policy. At theheart of these is a reliable, bankable support scheme for renewableenergy projects which provides long term stability and certainty
6.
Bankable support schemes result in lower cost projects becausethey lower the risk for both investors and equipment suppliers. Thecost of wind-powered electricity in Germany is up to 40% cheaperthan in the United Kingdom
7, for example, because the support
system is more secure and reliable.
For developing countries, feed-in laws would be an ideal mechanism
for the implementation of new renewable energies. The extra costs,however , which are usually covered in Europe, for example, by avery minor increase in the overall electricity price for consumers,are still seen as an obstacle. In order to enable technology transferfrom Annex 1 countries to developing countries, a mix of a feed-inlaw, international finance and emissions trading could be used toestablish a locally based renewable energy infrastructure andindustry with the assistance of OECD countries. learning from experience
The FFET program brings together three different supportmechanisms and builds on the experience from 20 years ofrenewable energy support programmes. 
experience of feed-in tariffsFeed-in tariffs are seen as the best way forward and very popular ,
especially in developing countries.
The main argument against them is the increase in electricity
prices for households and industry, as the extra costs are sharedacross all customers. This is particularly difficult for developingcountries, where many people can’t afford to spend more moneyfor electricity services.
experience of emissions trading Emissions trading (between
countries which need to make emissions reductions and countrieswhere renewable energy projects can be more easily or cheaplyimplemented) already plays a role in achieving CO
2reductions
under the Kyoto Protocol. The experience so far is that: 
The CO 2market is unstable, with the price per tonne 
varying significantly.
The market is still a ‘virtual’ market, with only limited 
actual flow of money.
Putting a price on CO 2emissions makes fossil fuelled power more
expensive, but due to the unstable and fluctuating prices it willnot help to make renewable energy projects more economicwithin the foreseeable future.
Most systems are not yet deliv ering real cuts in emissions.
experience of international financing Finance for renewable energy
projects is one of the main obstacles in developing countries. While largescale projects have fewer funding problems, small, community basedprojects, whilst having a high degree of public acceptance, face financingdifficulties. The experiences from micro credits for small hydro projectsin Bangladesh, for example, as well as wind farms in Denmark andGermany, show how strong local participation and acceptance can beachieved. The main reasons for this are the economic benefits flowing tothe local community and careful project planning based on good localknowledge and understanding. When the community identifies theproject rather than the project identifying the community, the result isgenerally faster bottom-up growth of the renewables sector .
combining existing programmes
The basic aims of the Feed-in Tariff Fund Emissions Trading scheme areto facilitate the implementation of feed-in laws for developing countries,to use existing emissions trading schemes to link CO
2prices directly with
the uptake of renewable energy, and to use the existing infrastructure,ofinternational financial institutions to secure investment for projects andlower the risk factor . The FFET concept will have three parts – fixedfeed-in tariffs, emissions trading and a funding arrangement. 2implementing the energy [r]evolution |SUPPORT SCHEMES - EXPERIENCE - COMBINING EXISTING PROGRAMMES

211. fixed feed-in tariffs
Feed-in tariffs will provide bankable and long term stable support for
the development of a local renewable energy market in developingcountries. The tariffs should bridge the gap between conventionalpower generation costs and those of renewable energy generation. 
The key parameters for feed-in tariffs under FFET are:Variable tariffs for different renewable energy technologies,
depending on their costs and technology maturity, paid for 20 years. 
Payments based on actual generation in order to achieve prop erly
maintained projects with high performance ratios.
Any additional finance required over the (20 year) period will be
secured through a public fund, which could generate some capitalincome, for example via interest rates, from a soft loanprogramme to finance renewable energy projects (see below).
Payment of the ‘additional costs’ for renewable generation will be
based on the Spanish system of the wholesale electricity priceplus a fixed premium.
A developing country which wants to apply for funding to operate
renewable energy projects under the FFET scheme will need toestablish clear regulations for the following:
Guaranteed access to the electricity grid for renewable 
electricity projects. 
Establishment of a feed-in law based on successful examples.
Transparent access to all data needed to establish the feed-in
tariff, including full records of generated electricity.
Clear planning and licencing procedures.
2. emissions trading
The traded CO 2emissions will come from OECD countries on top of
any commitment under their national emission reduction targets.Every tonne of CO
2will be connected to a specific amount of
electricity form renewable energy. A simple approach would be to usea factor of 1kg CO
2for 1 kWh of renewable electricity, which equals
the amount of avoided CO 2emissions from an older coal power plant.
A more complex method would be to use the average CO 2emissions
per kilowatt-hour in the specific country or the world’s average, whichis currently 0.6kg CO
2/kWh. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario shows
that the average additional costs (under the proposed energy mix)between 2008 and 2015 are between 1 and 4 cents per kilowatt-hourso the price per tonne of CO
2would be between €10 and €40.
The key parameters for emissions trading 
under FFET will be:
1 tonne CO 2= 1,000 kWh renewable electricity (emissions
factor: 1kg CO 2/kWh)
1 tonne CO 2represents a 20 year ‘package’ of renewable
electricity (1,000 kWh = 20 years x annual 50 kWh renewableelectricity production)3. the FFET fund
The FFET fund will act as a buffer between fluctuating CO 2emissions
prices and stable long term feed-in tariffs. The fund will secure thepayment of the required feed-in tariffs during the whole period (about20 years) for each project. This fund could be managed byintrernational financial institutions operating in Europe and CentralAsia or by Multilateral Development Banks. In order to provide accessto finance for small-scale businesses, a co-operation with a local bankwith a local presence in villages or cities would be desirable. 
All renewable energy projects must have a clear set of

24GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
Nuclear energy is a relatively small industry with big problems. It
covers just one sixteenth of the world’s primary energy consumption,a share set to decline over the coming decades. The average age ofoperating commercial nuclear reactors is 23 years, so more powerstations are being shut down than started. In 2007, world nuclearproduction fell by 1.8 % and the number of operating reactors was439, five less than the historical peak of 2002. 
In terms of new power stations, the amount of nuclear capacity
added annually between 2000 and 2007 was 2,500 MWe onaverage. This was six times less than wind power (13,300 MWe perannum between 2000 and 2007). In 2007, newly constructedrenewable energy power plants in Germany generated 13 TWh ofelectricity – as much as two large nuclear units.
Despite the rhetoric of a ‘nuclear renaissance’, the industry is
struggling with a massive increase in costs and construction delaysas well as safety and security problems linked to reactor operation,radioactive waste and nuclear proliferation.
a solution to climate protection?
The promise of nuclear energy to contribute to both climateprotection and energy supply needs to be checked against reality. Inthe most recent Energy Technology Perspectives report published bythe International Energy Agency
8, for example, its Blue Map
scenario outlines a future energy mix which would halve globalcarbon emissions by the middle of this century. To reach this goalthe IEA assumes a massive expansion of nuclear power betweennow and 2050, with installed capacity increasing four-fold andelectricity generation reaching 9,857 TWh/year , compared to 2,608TWh in 2007. In order to achieve this, the report says that 32large reactors (1,000 MWe) would have to be built every yearfrom now until 2050. This would be unrealistic, expensive,hazardous and too late to make a difference. 
unrealistic: Such a rapid growth is practically impossible given the
technical limitations. This scale of development was achieved in thehistory of nuclear power for only two years at the peak of the state-driven boom of the mid-1980s. It is unlikely to be achieved again,not to mention maintained for 40 consecutive years. While 1984and 1985 saw 31 GW of newly added nuclear capacity, the decadeaverage was 17 GW annually. In the past ten years, only three largereactors have been brought on line each year , and the currentproduction capacity of the global nuclear industry cannot delivermore than an annual six units.expensive: The IEA scenario assumes very optimistic investment
costs of $2,100/kWe installed, in line with what the industry hasbeen recently promising. The reality indicates three times thatmuch. Recent estimates by US business analysts Moody’s (June2008) put the cost of nuclear investment as high as $7,000/kWe.Price quotes for projects under preparation in the US cover a rangefrom $5,200 to 8,000/kWe
9. The latest cost estimate for the first
French EPR pressurised water reactor being built in Finland is$5,200/kWe, a figure likely to increase for later reactors as pricesescalate. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the cost indexfor nuclear components has risen by 173 % since 2000 – a neartripling over the past eight years
10. Building 1,400 large reactors
(1,000 MWe), even at the current cost of about $7,000/kWe,would require an investment of US$9.8 trillion. 
hazardous: Massive expansion of nuclear energy would necessarily
lead to a large increase in related hazards, such as serious reactoraccidents, growing stockpiles of deadly high level nuclear wastewhich will need to be safeguarded for thousands of years andpotential proliferation of both nuclear technologies and materialsthat can be diverted to military or terrorist use. The 1, 400 large
operating reactors in 2050 would generate an annual 35,000 tonsof spent fuel (assuming they are light water reactors, the mostcommon design for most new projects). This also means theproduction of 350,000 kilograms of plutonium each year , enough tobuild 35,000 crude nuclear weapons. 
Most of the expected electricity demand growth by 2050 will occur
in non-OECD countries. This means that a large proportion of thenew reactors would need to be built in those countries in order tohave a global impact on emissions. At the moment, the list ofcountries with announced nuclear ambitions is long and worrying interms of their political situation and stability, especially with theneed to guarantee against the hazards of accidents andproliferation for many decades. The World Nuclear Associationlisted the Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries in May 2008 asAlbania, Belarus, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Norway, Poland, Estonia,Latvia, Ireland, Iran, the Gulf states, Yemen, Israel, Syria, Jordan,Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Georgia,Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam,Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Venezuela,Nigeria, Ghana and Namibia.
slow: Climate science says that we need to reach a peak of global
greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 and reduce them by 20 % in2020. Even in developed countries with an established nuclearinfrastructure it takes at least a decade from the decision to build areactor to the delivery of its first electricity, and often much longer .Out of 35 reactors officially listed as under construction by the IEAin mid-July 2008, one third had been in this category for two decadesor more, indicating that these projects are not progressing. Thismeans that even if the world’s governments decided to implementstrong nuclear expansion now, only a few reactors would startgenerating electricity before 2020. The contribution from nuclearpower towards reducing emissions would come too late to help.3nuclear power |A SOLUTION?

25nuclear power blocks solutions
Even if the ambitious nuclear scenario is implemented, regardless
of costs and hazards, the IEA concludes that the contribution ofnuclear power to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from theenergy sector would be only 4.6 % - less than 3 % of the globaloverall reduction required.
There are other technologies that can deliver much larger emission
reductions, and much faster . Their investment costs are lower andthey do not create global security risks. Even the IEA finds that thecombined potential of efficiency savings and renewable energy to cutemissions by 2050 is more than ten times larger than that of nuclear .
The world has limited time, finance and industrial capacity to change
our energy sector and achieve a large reduction in greenhouseemissions. Choosing the pathway by spending $10 trillion on nucleardevelopment would be a fatally wrong decision. It would not save theclimate but it would necessarily take resources away from solutionsdescribed in this report and at the same time create serious globalsecurity hazards. Therefore new nuclear reactors are a clearlydangerous obstacle to the protection of the climate.
nuclear power in the energy [r]evolution scenario
For the reasons explained above, the Energy [R]evolution Scenarioenvisages a nuclear phase-out. Existing reactors would be closed atthe end of their average operational lifetime of 35 years. Weassume that no new construction is started after 2008 and onlytwo thirds of the reactors currently under construction will befinally put into operation. 
the dangers of nuclear power
Although the generation of electricity through nuclear powerproduces much less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels, there aremultiple threats to people and the environment from its operations.The main risks are:
Nuclear Proliferation 
Nuclear Waste 
Safety Risks
These are the background to why nuclear power has been discounted
as a future technology in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.1. nuclear proliferation
Manufacturing a nuclear bomb requires fissile material - eitheruranium-235 or plutonium-239. Most nuclear reactors use uraniumas a fuel and produce plutonium during their operation. It isimpossible to adequately protect a large reprocessing plant toprevent the diversion of plutonium to nuclear weapons. A small-scale plutonium separation plant can be built in four to six months,so any country with an ordinary reactor can produce nuclearweapons relatively quickly.
The result is that nuclear power and nuclear weapons have grown
up like Siamese twins. Since international controls on nuclearproliferation began, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea haveall obtained nuclear weapons, demonstrating the link between civiland military nuclear power . Both the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT)embody an inherent contradiction - seeking to promote thedevelopment of ‘peaceful’ nuclear power whilst at the same timetrying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons
Israel, India and Pakistan all used their civil nu clear operations to
develop weapons capability, operating outside internationalsafeguards. North Korea developed a nuclear weapon even as asignatory of the NPT. A major challenge to nuclear proliferationcontrols has been the spread of uranium enrichment technology toIran, Libya and North Korea. The Director General of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, has saidthat “should a state with a fully developed fuel-cycle capabilitydecide, for whatever reason, to break away from its non-proliferation commitments, most experts believe it could produce anuclear weapon within a matter of months
11.” 
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
has also warned that the security threat of trying to tackle climatechange with a global fast reactor programme (using plutoniumfuel) “would be colossal"
12. Even without fast reactors, all of the
reactor designs currently being promoted around the world could befuelled by MOX (mixed oxide fuel), from which plutonium can beeasily separated.
Restricting the production of fissile material to a few ‘trusted’
countries will not work. It will engender resentment and create acolossal security threat. A new UN agency is needed to tackle thetwin threats of climate change and nuclear proliferation by phasingout nuclear power and promoting sustainable energy, in the processpromoting world peace rather than threatening it.3nuclear power |NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION

3nuclear power |NUCLEAR WASTE - SAFETY RISKS
2. nuclear waste
The nuclear industry claims it can ‘dispose’ of its nuclear waste by
burying it deep underground, but this will not isolate the radioactivematerial from the environment forever . A deep dump only slowsdown the release of radioactivity into the environment. The industrytries to predict how fast a dump will leak so that it can claim thatradiation doses to the public living nearby in the future will be“acceptably low”. But scientific understanding is not sufficientlyadvanced to make such predictions with any certainty.
As part of its campaign to build new nuclear stations around the
world, the industry claims that problems associated with buryingnuclear waste are to do with public acceptability rather thantechnical issues. It points to nuclear dumping proposals in Finland,Sweden or the United States to underline its argument.
The most hazardous waste is the highly radioactive waste (or spent)
fuel removed from nuclear reactors, which stays radioactive forhundreds of thousands of years. In some countries the situation isexacerbated by ‘reprocessing’ this spent fuel – which involves dissolvingit in nitric acid to separate out weapons-usable plutonium. This processleaves behind a highly radioactive liquid waste. There are about270,000 tonnes of spent nuclear waste fuel in storage, much of it atreactor sites. Spent fuel is accumulating at around 12,000 tonnes peryear , with around a quarter of that going for reprocessing
13. No
country in the world has a solution for high level waste.
The IAEA recognises that, despite its international safety
requirements, “…radiation doses to ind ividuals in the future can
only be estimated and that the uncertainties associated with theseestimates will increase for times farther into the future.”
The least damaging option for waste already created at the current
time is to store it above ground, in dry storage at the site of origin,although this option also presents major challenges and threats. Theonly real solution is to stop producing the waste.3. safety risks
Windscale (1957), Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986)and Tokaimura (1999) are only a few of the hundreds of nuclearaccidents which have occurred to date. 
A simple power failure at a Swedish nuclear plant in 2006
highlighted our vulnerability to nuclear catastrophe. Emergencypower systems at the Forsmark plant failed for 20 minutes during apower cut and four of Sweden’s 10 nuclear power stations had tobe shut down. If power was not restored there could have been amajor incident within hours. A former director of the Forsmarkplant later said that "it was pure luck there wasn’t a meltdown”.The closure of the plants removed at a stroke roughly 20% ofSweden’s electricity supply.
A nuclear chain reaction must be kept under control, and harmful
radiation must, as far as possible, be contained within the reactor ,with radioactive products isolated from humans and carefullymanaged. Nuclear reactions generate high temperatures, and fluidsused for cooling are often kept under pressure. Together with theintense radioactivity, these high temperatures and pressures makeoperating a reactor a difficult and complex task.
The risks from operating reactors are increasing and the likelihood
of an accident is now higher than ever . Most of the world’s reactorsare more than 20 years old and therefore more prone to agerelated failures. Many utilities are attempting to extend their lifefrom the 40 years or so they were originally designed for to around60 years, posing new risks.
De-regulation has meanwhile pushed nuclear utilities to decrease
safety-related investments and limit staff whilst increasing reactorpressure and operational temperature and the burn-up of the fuel.This accelerates ageing and decreases safety margins.
New so-called passively safe reactors have many safety systems
replaced by ‘natural’ processes, such as gravity fed emergencycooling water and air cooling. This can make them more vulnerableto terrorist attack.
“... reactors with gravity fed emergency
cooling water and air cooling can makethem more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.”

5. reprocessing
Reprocessing involves the chemical
extraction of contaminated uranium andplutonium from used reactor fuel rods.There are now over 230,000 kilogramsof plutonium stockpiled around theworld from reprocessing – fivekilograms is sufficient for one nuclearbomb. Reprocessing is not the same asrecycling: the volume of waste increasesmany tens of times and millions of litresof radioactive waste are discharged intothe sea and air each day. The processalso demands the transport ofradioactive material and nuclear wasteby ship, rail, air and road around theworld. An accident or terrorist attackcould release vast quantities of nuclearmaterial into the environment. There isno way to guarantee the safety ofnuclear transport.
6. waste storage
There is not a single finalstorage facility for nuclearwaste available anywhere in theworld. Safe secure storage ofhigh level waste over thousandsof years remains unproven,leaving a deadly legacy forfuture generations. Despite thisthe nuclear industry continuesto generate more and morewaste each day.1. uranium mining
Uranium, used in nuclearpower plants, is extractedfrom huge mines in Canada,Australia, Russia andNigeria. Mine workers canbreathe in radioactive gasfrom which they are indanger of contracting lungcancer . Uranium miningproduces huge quantities ofmining debris, includingradioactive particles whichcan contaminate surfacewater and food.
2. uranium
enrichment
Natural uranium and
concentrated ‘yellow cake’contain just 0.7% offissionable uranium 235. To usethe material in a nuclearreactor , the share must go up to3 or 5 %. This process can becarried out in 16 facilitiesaround the world. 80% of thetotal volume is rejected as‘tails’, a waste product.Enrichment generates massiveamounts of ‘depleted uranium’that ends up as long-livedradioactive waste or is used inweapons or as tank shielding.3. fuel rod –
production
Enriched material is converted
into uranium dioxide andcompressed to pellets in fuelrod production facilities. Thesepellets fill 4m long tubes calledfuel rods. There are 29 fuel rodproduction facilities globally.The worst accident in this typeof facility happened inSeptember 1999 in Tokaimura,Japan, when two workers died.Several hundred workers andvillagers have sufferedradioactive contamination.4. power plant operation
Uranium nuclei are split in a nuclearreactor , releasing energy which heats upwater . The compressed steam isconverted in a turbine generator intoelectricity. This process creates aradioactive ‘cocktail’ which involvesmore than 100 products. One of these isthe highly toxic and long-lastingplutonium. Radioactive material canenter the environment through accidentsat nuclear power plants. The worstaccident to date happened at Chernobylin the then Soviet Union in 1986. Anuclear reactor generates enoughplutonium every year for the productionof as many as 39 nuclear weapons.figure 3.1: the nuclear fuel cycle

29The climate change imperative demands nothing short of an energy
revolution. The expert consensus is that this fundamental changemust begin very soon and be well underway within the next tenyears in order to avert the worst impacts. What we need is acomplete transformation in the way we produce, consume anddistribute energy and at the same time maintain economic growth.Nothing short of such a revolution will enable us to limit globalwarming to less t han a rise in temperature of 2°C, above which the
impacts become devastating.
Current electricity generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels,
with their associated CO
2emissions, in very large power stations
which waste much of their primary input energy. More energy islost as the power is moved around the electricity grid network andconverted from high transmission voltage down to a supply suitablefor domestic or comm ercial consumers. The sys tem is innately
vulnerable to disruption: localised technical, weather-related or evendeliberately caused faults can quickly cascade, resulting inwidespread blackouts. Whichever technology is used to generateelectricity within this old fashioned configuration, it will inevitablybe subject to some, or all, of these problems. At the core of theEnergy [R]evolution there therefore needs to be a change in theway that energy is both produced and distributed. 
key principles
the energy [r]evolution can be achieved by adhering to five key principles:
1.respect natural limits – phase out fossil fuels by the end ofthis century We must learn to respect natural limits. There is only
so much carbon that the atmosphere can absorb. Each year weemit over 25 billion tonnes of carbon equivalent; we are literallyfilling up the sky. Geological resources of coal could provideseveral hundred years of fuel, but we cannot burn them and keepwithin safe limits. Oil and coal development must be ended. 
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has a target to reduce energy
related CO
2emissions to a maximum of 10 Gt (Giga tonnes) by
2050 and phase out fossil fuels by 2085.
2.equity and fairness As long as there are natural limits there
needs to be a fair distribution of benefits and costs withinsocieties, between nations and between present and futuregenerations. At one extreme, a third of the world’s population hasno access to electricity, whilst the most industrialised countriesconsume much more than their fair share.
The effects of climate change on the poorest communities are
exacerbated by massive global energy inequality. If we are toaddress climate change, one of the principles must be equity andfairness, so that the benefits of energy services – such as light,heat, power and transport – are available for all: north andsouth, rich and poor . Only in this way can we create true energysecurity, as well as the conditions for genuine human wellbeing.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has a target to achieve energy
equity as soon as technically possible. By 2050 the average percapita emission should be between 1 and 2 tonnes of CO
2. 3.implement clean, renewable solutions and decentraliseenergy systems There is no energy shortage. All we need to do is
use existing technologies to harness energy effectively andefficiently. Renewable energy and energy efficiency measures areready, viable and increasingly competitive. Wind, solar and otherrenewable energy technologies have experienced double digitmarket growth for the past decade.
Just as climate change is real, so is the renewable energy sector .
Sustainable decentralised energy systems produce less carbonemissions, are cheaper and involve less dependence on importedfuel. They create more jobs and empower local communities.Decentralised systems are more secure and more efficient. This iswhat the Energy [R]evolution must aim to create.
To stop the Earth’s climate spinning out of control, most of the world’s
fossil fuel reserves – coal, oil and gas – must remain in the ground. Ourgoal is for humans to live within the natural limits of our small planet.
4.decouple growth from fossil fuel use Starting in the developed
countries, economic growth must fully decouple from fossil fuels.It is a fallacy to suggest that economic growth must bepredicated on their increased combustion.
We need to use the energy we produce much more efficiently, and we
need to make the transition to renewable energy – away from fossilfuels – quickly in order to enable clean and sustainable growth.
5.phase out dirty, unsustainable energy We need to phase out coal
and nuclear power . We cannot continue to build coal plants at a timewhen emissions pose a real and present danger to both ecosystemsand people. And we cannot continue to fuel the myriad nuclear threatsby pretending nuclear power can in any way help to combat climatechange. There is no role for nuclear power in the Energy [R]evolution.
from principles to practice
In 2005, renewable energy sources accounted for 13% of theworld’s primary energy demand. Biomass, which is mostly used forheating, is the main renewable energy source. The share ofrenewable energy in electricity generation was 18%. Thecontribution of renewables to primary energy demand for heatsupply was around 24%. About 80% of primary energy supplytoday still comes from fossil fuels, and 6% from nuclear power
14.
The time is right to make substantial structural changes in the
energy and power sector within the next decade. Many power plantsin industrialised countries, such as the USA, Japan and theEuropean Union, are nearing retirement; more than half of alloperating power plants are over 20 years old. At the same timedeveloping countries, such as China, India and Brazil, are looking tosatisfy the growing energy demand created by expanding economies.4the energy [r]evolution |KEY PRINCIPLES - FROM PRINCIPLES TO PRACTISE

30GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
Within the next ten years, the power sector will decide how this new
demand will be met, either by fossil and nuclear fuels or by theefficient use of renewable energy. The Energy [R]evolution Scenariois based on a new political framework in favour of renewableenergy and cogeneration combined with energy efficiency. 
To make this happen both renewable energy and cogeneration – on
a large scale and through decentralised, smaller units – have togrow faster than overall global energy demand. Both approachesmust replace old generating technologies and deliver the additionalenergy required in the developing world. 
As it is not possible to switch directly from the current large scale fossil
and nuclear fuel based energy system to a full renewable energy supply,a transition phase is required to build up the necessary infrastructure.Whilst remaining firmly committed to the promotion of renewablesources of energy, we appreciate that gas, used in appropriately scaledcogeneration plant, is valuable as a transition fuel, and able to drivecost-effective decentralisation of the energy infrastructure. With warmersummers, tri-generation, which incorporates heat-fired absorptionchillers to deliver cooling capacity in addition to heat and power , willbecome a particularly valuable means to achieve emissions reductions.
a development pathway
The Energy [R]evolution envisages a development pathway whichturns the present energy supply structure into a sustainable system.There are two main stages to this.
step 1: energy efficiency The Energy [R]evolution is aimed at the
ambitious exploitation of the potential for energy efficiency. Itfocuses on current best practice and technologies which willbecome available in the future, assuming continuous innovation. Theenergy savings are fairly equally distributed over the three sectors –industry, transport and domestic/business. Intelligent use, notabstinence, is the basic philosophy for future energy conservation. 
The most important energy saving options are improved heat
insulation and building design, super efficient electrical machines anddrives, replacement of old style electrical heating systems byrenewable heat production (such as solar collectors) and a reductionin energy consumption by vehicles used for goods and passengertraffic. Industrialised countries, which currently use energy in the mostinefficient way, can reduce their consumption drastically without theloss of either housing comfort or information and entertainmentelectronics. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario uses energy saved inOECD countries as a compensation for the increasing powerrequirements in developing countries. The ultimate goal is stabilisationof global energy consumption within the next two decades. At thesame time the aim is to create “energy equity” – shifting the currentone-sided waste of energy in the industrialised countries towards afairer worldwide distribution of efficiently used supply.
A dramatic reduction in primary energy demand compared to the
IEA’s “Reference Scenario” (see Chapter 6) – but with the sameGDP and population development - is a crucial prerequisite forachieving a significant share of renewable energy sources in theoverall energy supply system, compensating for the phasing out ofnuclear energy and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.step 2: structural changes 
decentralised energy and large scale renewables In order to
achieve higher fuel efficiencies and reduce distribution losses, theEnergy [R]evolution Scenario makes extensive use of DecentralisedEnergy (DE).This is energy generated at or near the point of use.
DE is connected to a local distribution network system, supplying
homes and offices, rather than the high voltage transmissionsystem. The proximity of electricity generating plant to consumersallows any waste heat from combustion processes to be piped tobuildings nearby, a system known as cogeneration or combined heatand power . This means that nearly all the input energy is put to use,not just a fraction as with traditional centralised fossil fuel plant. 
DE also includes stand-alone systems entirely separate from the
public networks, for example heat pumps, solar thermal panels orbiomass heating. These can all be commercialised at a domesticlevel to provide sustainable low emission heating. Although DEtechnologies can be considered ‘disruptive’ because they do not fitthe existing electricity market and system, with appropriate changesthey have the potential for exponential growth, promising ‘creativedestruction’ of the existing energy sector .
A huge proportion of global energy in 2050 will be produced by
decentralised energy sources, although large scale renewable energysupply will still be needed in order to achieve a fast transition to arenewables dominated system. Large offshore wind farms andconcentrating solar power (CSP) plants in the sunbelt regions ofthe world will therefore have an important role to play.
cogeneration The increased use of combined heat and power
generation (CHP) will improve the supply system’s energyconversion efficiency, whether using natural gas or biomass. In thelonger term, decreasing demand for heat and the large potential forproducing heat directly from renewable energy sources will limit thefurther expansion of CHP . 
renewable electricity The electricity sector will be the pioneer of
renewable energy utilisation. All renewable electricity technologieshave been experiencing steady growth over the past 20 to 30 yearsof up to 35% annually and are expected to consolidate at a highlevel between 2030 and 2050. By 2050, the majority of electricitywill be produced from renewable energy sources. Expected growthof electricity use in transport will further promote the effective useof renewable power generation technologies.
renewable heating In the heat supply sector , the contribution of
renewables will increase significantly. Growth rates are expected tobe similar to those of the renewable electricity sector . Fossil fuelswill be increasingly replaced by more efficient modern technologies,in particular biomass, solar collectors and geothermal. By 2050,renewable energy technologies will satisfy the major part of heatingand cooling demand.4the energy [r]evolution |DEVELOPMENT PATHWAY


31transport Before new technologies such as hybrid or electric cars
or new fuels such as bio fuels can play a substantial role in thetransport sector , the existing large efficiency potentials have to beexploited. In this study, biomass is primarily committed tostationary applications; the use of bio fuels for transport is limitedby the availability of sustainably grown biomass
15. Electric vehicles
will therefore play an even more important role in improving energyefficiency in transport and substituting for fossil fuels.Overall, to achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable
energy sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of alltechnologies is essential. Such a mobilisation depends on theresource availability, cost reduction potential and technologicalmaturity. Besides technology driven solutions, lifestyle changes -like simply driving less and using more public transport – have a
huge potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.4the energy [r]evolution |DEVELOPMENT PATHWAY

optimised integration of renewable energy
Modification of the energy system will be necessary to
accommodate the significantly higher shares of renewable energyexpected under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. This is not unlikewhat happened in the 1970s and 1980s, when most of thecentralised power plants now operating were constructed in OECDcountries. New high voltage power lines were built, night storageheaters marketed and large electric-powered hot water boilersinstalled in order to sell the electricity produced by nuclear andcoal-fired plants at night. 
Several OECD countries have demonstrated that it is possible to
smoothly integrate a large proportion of decentralised energy,including variable sources such as wind. A good example isDenmark, which has the highest percentage of combined heat andpower generation and wind power in Europe. With strong politicalsupport, 50% of electricity and 80% of district heat is nowsupplied by cogeneration plants. The contribution of wind power hasreached more than 18% of Danish electricity demand. At certaintimes, electricity generation from cogeneration and wind turbineseven exceeds demand. The load compensation required for gridstability in Denmark is managed both through regulating thecapacity of the few large power stations and through import andexport to neighbouring countries. A three tier tariff system enablesbalancing of power generation from the decentralised power plantswith electricity consumption on a daily basis.
It is important to optimise the energy system as a whole through
intelligent management by both producers and consumers, by anappropriate mix of power stations and through new systems forstoring electricity.appropriate power station mix: The power supply in OECD
countries is mostly generated by coal and – in some cases – nuclearpower stations, which are difficult to regulate. Modern gas powerstations, by contrast, are not only highly efficient but easier andfaster to regulate and thus better able to compensate forfluctuating loads. Coal and nuclear power stations have lower fueland operating costs but comparably high investment costs. Theymust therefore run round-the-clock as ‘base load’ in order to earnback their investment. Gas power stations have lower investmentcosts and are profitable even at low output, making them bettersuited to balancing out the variations in supply from renewableenergy sources.
load management: The level and timing of demand for electricity
can be managed by providing consumers with financial incentives toreduce or shut off their supply at periods of peak consumption.Control technology can be used to manage the arrangement. Thissystem is already used for some large industrial customers. ANorwegian power supplier even involves private household customersby sending them a text message with a signal to shut down. Eachhousehold can decide in advance whether or not they want toparticipate. In Germany, experiments are being conducted with timeflexible tariffs so that washing machines operate at night andrefrigerators turn off temporarily during periods of high demand. 
This type of load management has been simplified by advances in
communications technology. In Italy, for example, 30 millioninnovative electricity counters have been installed to allow remotemeter reading and control of consumer and service information.Many household electrical products or systems, such asrefrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, storage heaters, waterpumps and air conditioning, can be managed either by temporaryshut-off or by rescheduling their time of operation, thus freeing upelectricity load for other uses.4the energy [r]evolution |OPTIMISED INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY

33generation management: Renewable electricity generation
systems can also be involved in load optimisation. Wind farms, forexample, can be temporarily switched off when too much power isavailable on the network.
energy storage: Another method of balancing out electricity supply
and demand is through intermediate storage. This storage can bedecentralised, for example by the use of batteries, or centralised. Sofar , pumped storage hydropower stations have been the mainmethod of storing large amounts of electric power . In a pumpedstorage system, energy from power generation is stored in a lakeand then allowed to flow back when required, d riving turbines and
generating electricity. 280 such pumped storage plants existworldwide. They already provide an important contribution tosecurity of supply, but their operation could be better adjusted tothe requirements of a future renewable energy system. 
In the long term, other storage solutions are beginning to emerge.
One promising solution besides the use of hydrogen is the use ofcompressed air . In these systems, electricity is used to compress airinto deep salt domes 600 metres underground and at pressures ofup to 70 bar . At peak times, when electricity demand is high, the airis allowed to flow back out of the cavern and drive a turbine.Although this system, known as CAES (Compressed Air EnergyStorage) currently still requires fossil fuel auxiliary power , a so-called “adiabatic” plant is being developed which does not. Toachieve this, the heat from the compressed air is intermediatelystored in a giant heat store. Such a power station can achieve astorage efficiency of 70%.
The 
forecasting of renewable electricity generation is also
continually improving. Regulating supply is particularly expensivewhen it has to be found at short notice. However , predictiontechniques for wind power generation have become considerablymore accurate in recent years and are still being improved. Thedemand for balancing supply will therefore decrease in the future.the “virtual power station” 16
The rapid development of information technologies is helping topave the way for a decentralised energy supply based oncogeneration plants, renewable energy systems and conventionalpower stations. Manufacturers of small cogeneration plants alreadyoffer internet interfaces which enable remote control of the system.It is now possible for individual householders to control theirelectricity and heat usage so that expensive electricity drawn fromthe grid can be minimised – and the electricity demand profile issmoothed. This is part of the trend towards the ‘smart house’ whereits mini cogeneration plant becomes an energy management centre.We can go one step further than this with a ‘virtual power station’.Virtual does not mean that the power station does not produce realelectricity. It refers to the fact that there is no large, spatiallylocated power station with turbines and generators. The hub of thevirtual power station is a control unit which processes data frommany decentralised power stations, compares them with predictionsof power demand, generation and weather conditions, retrieves theavailable power market prices and then intelligently optimises theoverall power station activity. Some public utilities already use suchsystems, integrating cogeneration plants, wind farms, photovoltaicsystems and other power plants. The virtual power station can alsolink consumers into the management process.4the energy [r]evolution |THE “VIRTUAL POWER STATION”

future power grids 
The power grid network must also change in order to realise
decentralised structures with a high share of renewable energy.Today’s grids are designed to transport power from a fewcentralised power stations out to the passive consumers. A futuresystem must enable an active integration of consumers anddecentralised power generators and thus realise real time two-waypower and information flows. Large power stations will feedelectricity into the high voltage grid but small decentralised systemssuch as solar , cogeneration and wind plants will deliver their powerinto the low or medium voltage grid. In order to transportelectricity from renewable generation such as offshore wind farmsin remote areas (see box), a limited number of new high voltagetransmission lines will need to be constructed. These power lines willalso be available for cross-border power trade. Within the Energy[R]evolution Scenario, the share of variable renewable energysources is expected to reach about 10% of total electricitygeneration by 2020 and about 35% by 2050.A new Greenpeace report shows how a regionally integrated
approach to the large-scale development of offshore wind in theNorth Sea could deliver reliable clean energy for millions of homes.The ‘North Sea Electricity Grid [R]evolution’ report (September2008) calls for the creation of an offshore network to enable thesmooth flow of electricity generated from renewable energy sourcesinto the power systems of seven different countries - the UnitedKingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmarkand Norway – at the same time enabling significant emissionssavings. The cost of developing the grid is expected to be between€15 and 20 billion. This investment would not only allow the broad
integration of renewable energy but also unlock unprecedentedpower trading opportunities and cost efficiency. In a recentexample, a new 600 kilometre-long power line between Norway andthe Netherlands cost €600 million to build, but is already
generating a daily cross-border trade valued at €800,000.
The grid would enable the efficient integration of renewable energy
into the power system across the whole North Sea region. Byaggregating power generation from wind farms spread across thewhole area, periods of very low or very high power flows would bereduced to a negligible amount. A dip in wind power generation inone area would be ‘balanced’ by higher production in another area,even hundreds of kilometres away. Over a year , an installed offshorewind power capacity of 68.4 GW in the North Sea would be able togenerate an estimated 247 TWh of electricity.
An offshore grid in the North Sea would also allow, for example, the
import of electricity from hydro power generation in Norway to theBritish and UCTE (Central European) network. This could replacethermal baseload plants and increase flexibility within a portfolio. Inaddition, increased liquidity and trading facilities on the Europeanpower markets will allow for a more efficient portfolio management.The value of such an offshore therefore lies in its contribution toincreased security of supply, its function in aggregating the dispatchof power from offshore wind farms and its role as a facilitator forpower exchange and trade between regions and power systems.

Improving health and reducing death rates will not happen without
energy for the refrigeration needed for clinics, hospitals and vaccinationcampaigns. The world’s greatest child killer , acute respiratory infection,will not be tackled without dealing with smoke from cooking fires in thehome. Children will not study at night without light in their homes. Cleanwater will not be pumped or treated without energy.
The UN Commission on Sustainable Development argues that “to
implement the goal accepted by the international community ofhalving the proportion of people l iving on less t han US $1 per day
by 2015, access to affordable energy services is a prerequisite”.
the role of sustainable, clean renewable energy
To achieve the dramatic emissions cuts needed to avoid climatechange – in the order of 80% in OECD countries by 2050 – willrequire a massive uptake of renewable energy. The targets forrenewable energy must be greatly expanded in industrialisedcountries both to substitute for fossil fuel and nuclear generationand to create the necessary economies of scale necessary for globalexpansion. Within the Energy [R]evolution Scenario we assume thatmodern renewable energy sources, such as solar collectors, solarcookers and modern forms of bio energy, will replace inefficient,traditional biomass use. 4the energy [r]evolution |RURAL ELECTRIFICATION - ROLE
rural electrification17
Energy is central to reducing poverty, providing major benefits in
the areas of health, literacy and equity. More than a quarter of theworld’s population has no access to modern energy services. In sub-Saharan Africa, 80% of people have no electricity supply. Forcooking and heating, they depend almost exclusively on burningbiomass – wood, charcoal and dung.
Poor people spend up to a third of their income on energy, mostly
to cook food. Women in particular devote a considerable amount oftime to collecting, processing and using traditional fuel for cooking.In India, two to seven hours each day can be devoted to thecollection of cooking fuel. This is time that could be spent on childcare, education or income generation. The World HealthOrganisation estimates that 2.5 million women and young childrenin developing countries die prematurely each year from breathingthe fumes from indoor biomass stoves.
The Millennium Development Goal of halving global poverty by 2015 will
not be reached without adequate energy to increase production, incomeand education, create jobs and reduce the daily grind involved in having tojust survive. Halving hunger will not come about without energy for moreproductive growing, harvesting, processing and marketing of food.

38GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
Moving from principles to action on energy supply and climate
change mitigation requires a long-term perspective. Energyinfrastructure takes time to build up; new energy technologies taketime to develop. Policy shifts often also need many years to have aneffect. Any analysis that seeks to tackle energy and environmentalissues therefore needs to look ahead at least half a century. 
Scenarios are important in describing possible development paths,
to give decision-makers an overview of future perspectives and toindicate how far they can shape the future energy system. Twodifferent scenarios are used here to characterise the wide range ofpossible paths for the future energy supply system: a ReferenceScenario, reflecting a continuation of current trends and policies,and the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, which is designed to achievea set of dedicated environmental policy targets. 
The 
reference scenario is based on the Reference Scenario
published by the International Energy Agency in World EnergyOutlook 2007 (WEO 2007)
18. This only takes existing international
energy and environmental policies into account. The assumptionsinclude, for example, continuing progress in electricity and gasmarket reforms, the liberalisation of cross-border energy trade andrecent policies designed to combat environmental pollution. TheReference Scenario does not include additional policies to reducegreenhouse gas emissions. As the IEA’s scenario only covers a timehorizon up to 2030, it has been extended by extrapolating its keymacroeconomic indicators. This provides a baseline for comparisonwith the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. 
The 
energy [r]evolution scenario has a key target for the
reduction of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions down to a level ofaround 10 Gigatonnes per year by 2050 in order for the increase inglobal temperature to remain under +2°C. A second objective is theglobal phasing out of nuclear energy. To achieve these targets, thescenario is characterised by significant efforts to fully exploit thelarge potential for energy efficiency. At the same time, all cost-effective renewable energy sources are used for heat and electricitygeneration as well as the production of bio fuels. The generalframework parameters for population and GDP growth remainunchanged from the Reference Scenario.
These scenarios by no means claim to predict the future; they
simply describe two potential development paths out of the broadrange of possible ‘futures’. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario isdesigned to indicate the efforts and actions required to achieve itsambitious objectives and to illustrate the options we have at handto change our energy supply system into one that is sustainable.scenario background The scenarios in this report were jointly
commissioned by Greenpeace and the European Renewable EnergyCouncil from the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics, part of theGerman Aerospace Center (DLR). The supply scenarios werecalculated using the MESAP/PlaNet simulation model used for theprevious Energy [R]evolution study
19. Energy demand projections
were developed by Ecofys Netherlands, based on an analysis of thefuture potential for energy efficiency measures. The biomasspotential, using Greenpeace sustainability criteria, has beendeveloped especially for this scenario by the German BiomassResearch Centre. The future development pathway for cartechnologies is based on a special report produced in 2008 by theInstitute of Vehicle Concepts, DLR for Greenpeace International.
energy efficiency study
The aim of the Ecofys study was to develop a low energy demandscenario for the period 2005 to 2050 for the IEA regions asdefined in the World Energy Outlook report series. Calculationswere made for each decade from 2010 onwards. Energy demandwas split up into electricity and fuels. The sectors which were takeninto account were industry, transport and other consumers,including households and services.
Under the low energy demand scenario, worldwide final energy
demand is reduced by 38% in 2050 in comparison to the ReferenceScenario, resulting in a final energy demand of 350 EJ(ExaJoules). The energy savings are fairly equally distributed overthe three sectors of industry, transport and other uses. The mostimportant energy saving options are efficient passenger and freighttransport and improved heat insulation and building design. Chapter11 provides more details about this study.5scenarios for a future energy supply |BACKGROUND

39By 2050, 60% of the final energy used in transport will still come
from fossil sources, mainly gasoline and diesel. Renewableelectricity will cover 25%, bio fuels 13% and hydrogen 2%. Totalenergy consumption in 2050 will be similar to the consumption in2005, however , in spite of enormous increases in fuel use in someregions of the world.
The peak in global CO
2emissions from transport occurs between
2010 and 2015. From 2010 onwards, new legislation in the US andEurope will contribute to breaking the upwards trend in emissions.From 2020, the effect of introducing grid-connected electric cars canbe clearly seen. Chapter 13 provides more details about this report. 
the global potential for sustainable bio energy 
As part of the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, Greenpeacecommissioned the German Biomass Research Centre (the formerInstitute for Energy and Environment) to look at the worldwidepotential for energy crops up to 2050. A summary of this reportcan be found in Chapter 8.5scenarios for a future energy supply |FUTURE OF CARS - GLOBAL POTENTIAL
the future for cars
The Institute of Vehicle Concepts in Stuttgart, Germany has
developed a global scenario for cars cov ering ten world regions. The
aim was to produce a demanding but feasible scenario to lowerglobal car CO
2emissions within the context of the overall objectives
of this report. The approach takes into account a vast range oftechnical measures to reduce the energy consumption of vehicles,but also considers the dramatic increase in vehicle ownership andannual mileage taking place in developing countries. The majorparameters are vehicle technology, alternative fuels, changes insales of different vehicle sizes (segment split) and changes invehicle kilometres travelled (modal split). 
The scenario assumes that a large share of renewable electricity
will be available in the future. A combination of ambitious effortstowards higher efficiency in vehicle technologies, a major switch togrid-connected electric vehicles and incentives for vehicle users tosave carbon dioxide lead to the conclusion that it is possible toreduce CO
2emissions from ‘well-to-wheel’ in 2050 by roughly
25%20compared to 1990 and 40% compared to 2005.

main scenario assumptions
Development of a global energy scenario requires the use of a multi-
region model in order to reflect the significant structural differencesbetween energy supply systems. The International Energy Agencybreakdown of world regions, as used in the ongoing series of WorldEnergy Outlook reports, has been chosen because the IEA alsoprovides the most comprehensive global energy statistics
21. The previous Energy [R]evolution Scenario used three regions to cover
Asia: East Asia, South Asia and China. In line with WEO 2007, this newedition maintains the three region approach, but assesses China andIndia separately and aggregates the remaining Non-OECD countries inAsia under ‘Developing Asia’. The loss of comparability with the previousstudy is outweighed by the ability to compare the new results withcurrent IEA reports and still provides a reasonable analysis of Asia interms of population and economic development. The definitions of theworld regions are shown in Figure 5.1.

411. population development
One important underlying factor in energy scenario building is
future population development. Population growth affects the sizeand composition of energy demand, directly and through its impacton economic growth and development. World Energy Outlook 2007uses the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)projections for population development. For this study the mostrecent population projections from UNDP up to 2050 are applied
22.
Table 5.1 summarises this study’s assumptions on world population
development. The world’s population is expected to grow by 0.77 % onaverage over the period 2005 to 2050, from 6.5 billion people in 2005 tomore than 9.1 billion in 2050. Population growth will slow over theprojection period, from 1.2% during 2005-2010 to 0.4% during 2040-2050. However , the updated projections show an increase in population ofalmost 300 million compared to the previous edition. This will furtherincrease the demand for energy. The population of the developing regionswill continue to grow most rapidly. The Transition Economies will face acontinuous decline, followed after a short while by the OECD Pacificcountries. OECD Europe and OECD North America are expected tomaintain their population, with a peak in around 2020/2030 and a slightdecline afterwards. The share of the population l iving in t oday’s Non-
OECD countries will increase from the current 82% to 86% in 2050.China’s contribution to world population will drop from 20% today to15% in 2050. Africa will remain the region with the highest growth rate,leading to a share of 21% of world population in 2050.
Satisfying the energy needs of a growing population in the developing
regions of the world in an environmentally friendly manner is a keychallenge for achieving a global sustainable energy supply.
2. economic growth
Economic growth is a key driver for energy demand. Since 1971, each1% increase in global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has beenaccompanied by a 0.6% increase in primary energy consumption. Thedecoupling of energy demand and GDP growth is therefore a prerequisitefor reducing demand in the future. Most global energy/economic/environmental models constructed in the past have relied on marketexchange rates to place countries in a common currency for estimationand calibration. This approach has been the subject of considerablediscussion in recent years, and the alternative of purchasing power parity(PPP) exchange rates has been proposed. Purchasing power paritiescompare the costs in different currencies of a fixed basket of traded andnon-traded goods and services and yield a widely-based measure of thestandard of l iving. This is important in analysing the main drivers of
energy demand or for comparing energy intensities among countries. 
Although PPP assessments are still relatively imprecise compared to
statistics based on national income and product trade and nationalprice indexes, they are considered to provide a better basis for globalscenario development.
23Thus all data on economic development in
WEO 2007 refers to purchasing power adjusted GDP . However , asWEO 2007 only covers the time period up to 2030, the projectionsfor 2030-2050 are based on our own estimates. Prospects for GDP growth have in creased considerably compared to
the previous study, whilst underlying growth trends continue much thesame. GDP growth in all regions is expected to slow gradually over thecoming decades. World GDP is assumed to grow on average by 3.6%per year over the period 2005-2030, compared to 3.3% from 1971 to2002, and on average by 3.3 % per year over the entire modellingperiod. China and India are expected to grow faster than otherregions, followed by the Developing Asia countries, Africa and theTransition Economies. The Chinese economy will slow as it becomesmore mature, but will nonetheless become the largest in the world inPPP terms early in the 2020s. GDP in OECD Europe and OECDPacific is assumed to grow by ar ound 2% per year over the projection

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
3. fossil fuel and biomass price projections
The recent dramatic increase in global oil prices has resulted in much
higher forward price projections for fossil fuels. Under the 2004 ‘highoil and gas price’ scenario from the European Commission, forexample, an oil price of just $34 per barrel was assumed in 2030.More recent projections of oil prices in 2030 range from the IEA’s$
200662/bbl ($ 200560/bbl) (WEO 2007) up to $ 2006119/bbl
($2005115/bbl) in the ‘high price’ scenario of the US Energy
Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2008.Since the last Energy [R]evolution study was published, however ,
the price of oil has moved over $100/bbl for the first time (at theend of 2007), and in July 2008 reached a record high of more than$140/bbl. Although oil prices fell back to $100/bbl in September2008, the above projections might still be considered tooconservative. Considering the growing gl obal demand for oil and gas
we have assumed a price development path for fossil fuels in whichthe price of oil reaches $120/bbl by 2030 and $140/bbl in 2050. 
As the supply of natural gas is limited by the availability of pipeline
infrastructure, there is no world market price for natural gas. Inmost regions of the world the gas price is directly tied to the priceof oil. Gas prices are assumed to increase to $20-25/GJ by 2050.
4. cost of CO 2emissions
Assuming that a CO 2emissions trading system is established in all world
regions in the long term, the cost of CO 2allowances needs to be included
in the calculation of electricity generation costs. Projections of emissionscosts are even more uncertain than energy prices, and available studiesspan a broad range of future CO
2cost estimates. As in the previous
Energy [R]evolution study we assume CO 2costs of $10/tCO 2in 2010,
rising to $50/tCO 2in 2050. Additional CO 2costs are applied in Kyoto

435. power plant investment costs
fossil fuel technologies and carbon capture and storage (CCS)
While the fossil fuel power technologies in use today for coal, gas,lignite and oil are established and at an advanced stage of marketdevelopment, further cost reduction potentials are assumed. Thepotential for cost reductions is limited, however , and will beachieved mainly through an increase in efficiency, bringing downinvestment costs
24.
There is much speculation about the potential for carbon capture
and storage (CCS) technology to mitigate the effect of fossil fuelconsumption on climate change, even though the technology is stillunder development. 
CCS is a means of trapping CO
2from fossil fuels, either before or
after they are burned, and ‘storing’ (effectively disposing of) it inthe sea or beneath the surface of the Earth. There are currentlythree different methods of capturing CO
2: ‘pre-combustion’, ‘post-
combustion’ and ‘oxyfuel combustion’. However , development is at avery early stage and CCS will not be implemented - in the best case- before 2020 and will probably not become comm ercially viable as
a possible effective mitigation option until 2030. 
Cost estimates for CCS vary considerably, depending on factors
such as power station configuration, technology, fuel costs, size ofproject and location. One thing is certain, however , CCS isexpensive. It requires significant funds to construct the powerstations and the necessary infrastructure to transport and storecarbon. The IPCC assesses costs at $15-75 per ton of capturedCO
225, while a recent US Department of Energy report found
installing carbon capture systems to most modern plants resulted ina near doubling of costs
26. These costs are estimated to increase the
price of electricity in a range from 21-91%27. Pipeline networks will also need to be constructed to move CO 2to
storage sites. This is likely to require a considerable outlay ofcapital
28. Costs will vary depending on a number of factors,
including pipeline length, diameter and manufacture fromcorrosion-resistant steel, as well as the volume of CO
2to be
transported. Pipelines built near population centres or on difficultterrain, such as marshy or rocky gr ound, are more expensive
29.
The IPCC estimates a cost range for pipelines of $1-8/ton of CO 2
transported. A United States Congressional Research Services
report calculated capital costs for an 11 mile pipeline in theMidwestern region of the US at approximately $6 million. The samereport estimates that a dedicated interstate pipeline network inNorth Carolina would cost upwards of $5 billion due to the limitedgeological sequestration potential in that part of the country
30.
Storage and subsequent monitoring and verification costs areestimated by the IPCC to range from $0.5-8/tCO
2injected and
$0.1-0.3/tCO 2injected, respectively. The overall cost of CCS could
therefore serve as a major barrier to its deployment31.
For the above reasons, CCS power plants are not included in our
financial analysis.
Table 5.4 summarises our assumptions on the technical and
economic parameters of future fossil-fuelled power planttechnologies. In spite of growing raw material prices, we assumethat further technical innovation will result in a moderate reductionof future investment costs as well as improved power plantefficiencies. These improvements are, however , outweighed by theexpected increase in fossil fuel prices, resulting in a significant risein electricity generation costs. 5scenarios for a future energy supply |MAIN SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS

6. cost projections for renewable energy technologies
The range of renewable energy technologies available today display
marked differences in terms of their technical maturity, costs anddevelopment potential. Whereas hydro power has been widely usedfor decades, other technologies, such as the gasification of biomass,have yet to find their way to market maturity. Some renewablesources by their very nature, including wind and solar power , providea variable supply, requiring a revised coordination with the gridnetwork. But although in many cases these are ‘distributed’technologies - their output being generated and used locally to theconsumer - the future will also see large-scale applications in theform of offshore wind parks, photovoltaic power plants orconcentrating solar power stations.
By using the individual advantages of the different technologies, and
linking them with each other , a wide spectrum of available optionscan be developed to market maturity and integrated step by stepinto the existing supply structures. This will eventually provide acomplementary portfolio of environmentally friendly technologiesfor heat and power supply and the provision of transport fuels.
Many of the renewable technologies employed today are at a
relatively early stage of market development. As a result, the costsof electricity, heat and fuel production are generally higher thanthose of competing conventional systems - a reminder that theexternal (environmental and social) costs of conventional powerproduction are not included in the market prices. It is expected,however , that compared with conventional technologies large costreductions can be achieved through technical advances,manufacturing improvements and large-scale production. Especiallywhen developing long-term scenarios spanning periods of severaldecades, the dynamic trend of cost developments over time plays acrucial role in identifying economically sensible expansion strategies. To identify long-term cost developments, learning curves have been
applied which reflect the correlation between cumulative productionvolumes of a particular technology and a reduction in its costs. Formany technologies, the learning factor (or progress ratio) falls in therange between 0.75 for less mature systems to 0.95 and higher forwell-established technologies. A learning factor of 0.9 means thatcosts are expected to fall by 10% every time the cumulative outputfrom the technology doubles. Empirical data shows, for example,that the learning factor for PV solar modules has been fairlyconstant at 0.8 over 30 years whilst that for wind energy variesfrom 0.75 in the UK to 0.94 in the more advanced German market.
Assumptions on future costs for renewable electricity technologies
in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario are derived from a review oflearning curve studies, for example by Lena Neij and others
32, from
the analysis of recent technology foresight and road mappingstudies, including the European Commission funded NEEDS (NewEnergy Externalities Developments for Sustainability)
33project or
the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives 2008, and a discussionwith experts from the renewable energy industry.5scenarios for a future energy supply |MAIN SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS

49photovoltaics (pv)
The worldwide photovoltaics (PV) market has been growing at over
35% per annum in recent years and the contribution it can make toelectricity generation is starting to become significant. Developmentwork is focused on improving existing modules and systemcomponents by increasing their energy efficiency and reducingmaterial usage. Technologies like PV thin film (using alternativesemiconductor materials) or dye sensitive solar cells are developingquickly and present a huge potential for cost reduction. The maturetechnology crystalline silicon, with a proven lifetime of 30 years, iscontinually increasing its cell and module efficiency (by 0.5%annually), whereas the cell thickness is rapidly decreasing (from230 to 180 microns over the last five years). Comm ercial m odule
efficiency varies from 14 to 21% depending on silicon quality andfabrication process.
The learning factor for PV modules has been fairly constant over
the last 30 years, with a cost reduction of 20% each time theinstalled capacity doubles, indicating a high rate of technicallearning. Assuming a globally installed capacity of 1,600 GW bybetween 2030 and 2040, and with an electricity output of 2,600TWh, we can expect that generation costs of around 5-10cents/kWh (depending on the region) will be achieved. During thefollowing five to ten years, PV will become competitive with retailelectricity prices in many parts of the world and competitive withfossil fuel costs by 2050. The importance of photovoltaics comesfrom its decentralised/centralised character , its flexibility for use inan urban environment and huge potential for cost reduction. concentrating solar power (csp)
Solar thermal ‘concentrating’ power stations (CSP) can only usedirect sunlight and are therefore dependent on high irradiationlocations. North Africa, for example, has a technical potentialwhich far exceeds local demand. The various solar thermaltechnologies (parabolic trough, power towers and parabolic dishconcentrators) offer good prospects for further development andcost reductions. Because of their more simple design, ‘Fresnel’collectors are considered as an option for additional cost reduction.The efficiency of central receiver systems can be increased byproducing compressed air at a temperature of up to 1,000°C, whichis then used to run a combined gas and steam turbine.
Thermal storage systems are a key component for reducing CSP
electricity generation costs. The Spanish Andasol 1 plant, forexample, is equipped with molten salt storage with a capacity of7.5 hours. A higher level of full load operation can be realised byusing a thermal storage system and a large collector field. Althoughthis leads to higher investment costs, it reduces the cost ofelectricity generation. 
Depending on the level of irradiation and mode of operation, it is
expected that long term future electricity generation costs of 6-10cents/kWh can be achieved. This presupposes rapid marketintroduction in the next few years.5scenarios for a future energy supply |MAIN SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS

wind power 
Within a short period of time, the dynamic development of wind
power has resulted in the establishment of a flourishing globalmarket. The world’s largest wind turbines, several of which havebeen installed in Germany, have a capacity of 6 MW. Whilefavourable policy incentives have made Europe the main driver forthe global wind market, in 2007 more than half of the annualmarket was outside Europe. This trend is likely to continue. Theboom in demand for wind power technology has nonetheless led tosupply constraints. As a consequence, the cost of new systems hasstagnated or even increased. Because of the continuous expansionof production capacities, the industry expects to resolve thebottlenecks in the supply chain over the next few years. Taking intoaccount market development projections, learning curve analysisand industry expectations, we assume that investment costs forwind turbines will reduce by 30% for onshore and 50% foroffshore installations up to 2050.biomass 
The crucial factor for the economics of biomass utilisation is thecost of the feedstock, which today ranges from a negative cost forwaste wood (based on credit for waste disposal costs avoided)through inexpensive residual materials to the more expensive energycrops. The resulting spectrum of energy generation costs iscorrespondingly broad. One of the most economic options is the useof waste wood in steam turbine combined heat and power (CHP)plants. Gasification of solid biomass, on the other hand, whichopens up a wide range of applications, is still relatively expensive.In the long term it is expected that favourable electricity productioncosts will be achieved by using wood gas both in micro CHP units(engines and fuel cells) and in gas-and-steam power plants. Greatpotential for the utilisation of solid biomass also exists for heatgeneration in both small and large heating centres linked to localheating networks. Converting crops into ethanol and ‘bio diesel’made from rapeseed methyl ester (RME) has become increasinglyimportant in recent years, for example in Brazil, the USA andEurope. Processes for obtaining synthetic fuels from biogenicsynthesis gases will also play a larger role.
A large potential for exploiting modern technologies exists in Latin
and North America, Europe and the Transition Economies, either instationary appliances or the transport sector . In the long termEurope and the Transition Economies will realise 20-50% of thepotential for biomass from energy crops, whilst biomass use in allthe other regions will have to rely on forest residues, industrial woodwaste and straw. In Latin America, North America and Africa inparticular , an increasing residue potential will be available.
In other regions, such as the Middle East and all Asian regions, the
additional use of biomass is restricted, either due to a generally lowavailability or already high traditional use. For the latter , usingmodern, more efficient technologies will improve the sustainabilityof current usage and have positive side effects, such as reducingindoor pollution and the heavy workloads currently associated withtraditional biomass use. 5scenarios for a future energy supply |MAIN SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS

51geothermal 
Geothermal energy has long been used worldwide for supplying
heat, and since the beginning of the last century for electricitygeneration as well. Geothermally generated electricity waspreviously limited to sites with specific geological conditions, butfurther intensive research and development work has enabled thepotential areas to be widened. In particular the creation of largeunderground heat exchange surfaces (Enhanced GeothermalSystems - EGS) and the improvement of low temperature powerconversion, for example with the Organic Rankine Cycle, open upthe possibility of producing geothermal electricity anyywhere.Advanced heat and power cogeneration plants will also improve theeconomics of geothermal electricity.
As a large part of the costs for a geothermal power plant come
from deep underground drilling, further development of innovativedrilling technology is expected. Assuming a global average marketgrowth for geothermal power capacity of 9% per year up to 2020,adjusting to 4% beyond 2030, the result would be a cost reductionpotential of 50% by 2050: 
for conventional geothermal power , from 7 cents/kWh to about 
2 cents/kWh.
for EGS, despite the presently high figures (about 20 cents/kWh),
electricity production costs - depending on the payments for heatsupply - are expected to come down to around 5 cents/kWh in the long term. 
Because of its non-fluctuating supply and a grid load operating
almost 100% of the time, geothermal energy is considered to be akey element in a future supply structure based on renewable sources.Until now we have just used a marginal part of the geothermalheating and cooling potential. Shallow geothermal drilling makespossible the delivery of heating and cooling at any time anywhere,and can be used for thermal energy storage.ocean energy 
Ocean energy, particularly offshore wave energy, is a significantresource, and has the potential to satisfy an important percentage ofelectricity supply worldwide. Globally, the potential of ocean energyhas been estimated at around 90,000 TWh/year . The most significantadvantages are the vast availability and high predictability of theresource and a technology with very low visual impact and no CO
2
emissions. Many different concepts and devices have been developed,including taking energy from the tides, waves, currents and boththermal and saline gradient resources. Many of them are in anadvanced phase of R&D, large scale prototypes have been deployedin real sea conditions and some have reached pre-marketdeployment. There are a few grid connected, fully operationalcommercial wave and tidal generating plants. 
The cost of energy from initial tidal and wave energy farms has been
estimated to be in the range of 15-55 €cents/kWh, and for initial
tidal stream farms in the range of 11-22 €cents/kWh. Generation
costs of 10-25 €cents/kWh are expected by 2020. Key areas for
development will include concept design, optimisation of the deviceconfiguration, reduction of capital costs by exploring the use ofalternative structural materials, economies of scale and learningfrom operation. According to the latest research findings, thelearning factor is estimated to be 10-15% for offshore wave and 5-10% for tidal stream. In the medium term, ocean energy has thepotential to become one of the most competitive and cost effectiveforms of generation. In the next few years a dynamic marketpenetration is expected, following a similar curve to wind energy.
Because of the early development stage any future cost estimates
for ocean energy systems are uncertain, and no learning curve datais available. Present cost estimates are based on analysis from theEuropean NEEDS project

hydro power 
Hydropower is a mature technology with a significant part of its
potential already exploited. There is still, however , some potentialleft both for new schemes (especially small scale run-of-riverprojects with little or no reservoir impoundment) and forrepowering of existing s ites. The significance of hydropower is also
likely to be encouraged by the increasing need for flood control andmaintenance of water supply during dry periods. The future is insustainable hydropower which makes an effort to integrate plantswith river ecosystems while reconciling ecology with economicallyattractive power generation. summary of renewable energy cost development 
Figure 5.4 summarises the cost trends for renewable energytechnologies as derived from the respective learning curves. It shouldbe emphasised that the expected cost reduction is basically not afunction of time, but of cumulative capacity, so dynamic marketdevelopment is required. Most of the technologies will be able toreduce their specific investment costs to between 30% and 70% ofcurrent levels by 2020, and to between 20% and 60% once theyhave achieved full development (after 2040).
Reduced investment costs for renewable energy technologies lead
directly to reduced heat and electricity generation costs, as shown inFigure 5.5. Generation costs today are around 8 to 25 €cents/kWh
(10-25 $cents/kWh) for the most important technologies, with theexception of photovoltaics. In the long term, costs are expected toconverge at around 4 to 10 €cents/kWh (5-12 $cents/kWh). These
estimates depend on site-specific conditions such as the local windregime or solar irradiation, the availability of biomass at reasonableprices or the credit granted for heat supply in the case of combinedheat and power generation.5scenarios for a future energy supply |MAIN SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS

54GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
The development of future global energy demand is det ermined 
by three key factors:
Population development: the number of people consuming energy
or using energy services.
Economic development, for which Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) is the most commonly used indicator . In general, an increase in GDP triggers an increase in energy demand.
Energy intensity: how much energy is required 
to produce a unit of GDP .
Both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios are based
on the same projections of population and economic development.The future development of energy intensity, however , differs betweenthe two, taking into account the measures to increase energyefficiency under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.global: projection of energy intensity
An increase in economic activity and a growing population does notnecessarily have to result in an equivalent increase in energydemand. There is still a large potential for exploiting energyefficiency measures. Under the Reference Scenario, we assume thatenergy intensity will be reduced by 1.25% on average per year ,leading to a reduction in final energy demand per unit of GDP ofabout 56% between 2005 and 2050. Under the Energy[R]evolution Scenario, it is assumed that active policy and technicalsupport for energy efficiency measures will lead to an even higherreduction in energy intensity of almost 73%.6key results |GLOBAL - INTENSITY

55global: development of energy demand by sector
Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth
and energy intensity results in future development pathways for theworld’s energy demand. These are shown in Figure 6.4 for both theReference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the ReferenceScenario, total primary energy demand almost doubles from474,900 PJ/a in 2005 to 867,700 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy[R]evolution Scenario, demand increases up to 2015 by 16% anddecreases to close to today’s level of 480,860 PJ in 2050.The accelerated increase in energy efficiency, which is a crucial
prerequisite for achieving a sufficiently large share of renewableenergy sources in our energy supply, is beneficial not only for theenvironment but also for economics. Taking into account the fullservice life, in most cases the implementation of energy efficiencymeasures saves costs compared to an additional energy supply. Themobilisation of cost-effective energy saving potential leads directlyto a reduction in costs. A dedicated energy efficiency strategy thusalso helps to compensate in part for the additional costs requiredduring the market introduction phase of renewable energy sources.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected
to increase disproportionately, with households and services the mainsource of growing consumption (see Figure 6.5). With the exploitation ofefficiency measures, however , an even higher increase can be avoided,leading to electricity demand of around 30,800 TWh/a in the year 2050.Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid thegeneration of about 12,800 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demand canbe achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devicesusing the best available technology in all demand sectors. Employment ofsolar architecture in both residential and commercial buildings will helpto curb the growing demand for active air-conditioning.
Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger . Under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be reduced(see Figure 6.6). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption
equivalent to 46,000 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. Asa result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residentialbuildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and ‘passivehouses’ for new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energyservices will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.
In the transport sector , it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will increase by 12 % to around94,000 PJ/a in 2015 and will fall slightly afterwards down to83,300 PJ/a in 2050, saving 100,000 PJ compared to the ReferenceScenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highlyefficient vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to railand by changes in mobility-related behaviour patterns.6key results |GLOBAL - DEMAND

global: electricity generation
The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a
dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing share
of renewable electricity. This will compensate for the phasing out ofnuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plantsrequired for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 77% of the electricityproduced worldwide will come from renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV – willcontribute over 60% of electricity generation. The following strategypaves the way for a future renewable energy supply:
The phasing out of nuclear energy and rising electricity demand
will be met initially by bringing into operation new highly efficientgas-fired combined-cycle power plants, plus an increasingcapacity of wind turbines, biomass, concentrating solar powerplants and solar photovoltaics. In the long term, wind will be themost important single source of electricity generation.
Solar energy, hydro and biomass will make substantial contributions
to electricity generation. In particular , as non-fluctuating renewableenergy sources, hydro and solar thermal, combined with efficientheat storage, are important elements in the overall generation mix.
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 1,000 GW to 9,100 GW in 2050. Increasingrenewable capacity by a factor of nine within the next 42 yearsrequires political support and well-designed policy instruments,however . There will be a considerable demand for investment innew production capacity over the next 20 years. As investmentcycles in the power sector are long, decisions on restructuring theworld’s energy supply system need to be taken now. 
To achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable energy
sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is ofgreat importance. This mobilisation depends on technical potentials,cost reduction and technological maturity. Figure 21 shows thecomparative evolution of the different renewable technologies overtime. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the majorcontributors to the growing market share. After 2020, thecontinuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity frombiomass, photovoltaic and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

576key results |GLOBAL - COSTS - HEATING & COOLINGglobal: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 27 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs of electricitygeneration compared to the Reference Scenario. This difference will be lessthan 0.2 cents/kWh up to 2020. Note that any increase in fossil fuel pricesbeyond the projection given in Table 6.1 will reduce the gap between thetwo scenarios. Because of the lower CO
2intensity of electricity generation,
by 2020 electricity generation costs will become economically favourableunder the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, and by 2050 generation costswill be more than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Due to growing demand, we face a significant increase in society’s
expenditure on electricity supply. Under the Reference Scenario, theunchecked growth in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and thecost of CO
2emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from
today’s $1,750 billion per year to more than $7,300 bn in 2050. Figure28 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies withglobal CO
2reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and
relieve the economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiencyand shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs forelectricity supply that are one third lower than in the ReferenceScenario. It becomes clear that pursuing stringent environmental targetsin the energy sector also pays off in terms of economics.global: heat and cooling supply
Development of renewables in the heat supply sector raisesdifferent issues. Today, renewables provide 24%of primary energydemand for heat supply, the main contribution coming from the useof biomass. The lack of district heating networks is a severestructural barrier to the large scale utilisation of geothermal andsolar thermal energy. Past experience shows that it is easier toimplement effective support instruments in the grid-connectedelectricity sector than in the heat market, with its multitude ofdifferent actors. Dedicated support instruments are required toensure a dynamic development. 
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables satisfy more than
70% of the total global heating demand in 2050.
Energy efficiency measures can decrease the current per capita
demand for heat supply by 30% in spite of improving l iving st andards.
For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well 
as geothermal energy will increasingly substitute for fossil fuel-fired systems.
A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional
applications will lead to a further reduction of CO
2emissions.

global: transport
In the transport sector , it is assumed that under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario, due to fast growing demand for services,energy demand will further increase up to 2015. After that demandwill decrease, falling to below its current level in 2050. Comparedto the Reference Scenario, energy demand is reduced by 54%. Thisreduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficientvehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and bychanges in mobility-related behaviour patterns. By implementingattractive alternatives to individual cars, the amount of cars willgrow more slowly than in the Reference Scenario. In 2050,electricity will provide 24% of the transport sector’s total energydemand, while 61% of the demand will be covered by fossil fuels.global: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resultingprimary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario isshown in Figure 6.13. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overallenergy demand will be reduced by almost 45% in 2050. More than halfof the remaining demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.Note that because of the ‘efficiency method’ used for the calculation ofprimary energy consumption, which postulates that the amount ofelectricity generation from hydro, wind, solar and geothermal energyequals the primary energy consumption, the share of renewables seemsto be lower than their actual importance as energy suppliers.

Whilst worldwide emissions of CO 2will almost double under the
Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario theywill decrease from 24,350 million tonnes in 2005 to 10,600 m/t in2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 3.7 tonnes to1.15 t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasingdemand, CO
2emissions will decrease in the electricity sector . In the
long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewableelectricity will even reduce CO
2emissions in the transport sector .
With a share of 35% of total CO 2in 2050, the power sector will
fall significantly but remain the largest source of emissions,followed by transport.figure 6.14: global: development of CO 2emissions

596key results |GLOBAL - CO 2EMISSIONSglobal: regional breakdown of CO 2emissions in 2050
With effective efficiency standards OECD countries can reduce
their per capita energy consumption significantly while developingcountries could slow down their massive increase in energy demand.At the same time renewable energy sources can increase thereshare in the energy mix to over 50 % globally. In some regions, therenewable energy share will be well above 80%, while economicgrowth is still maintained over the entire scenario period. 
With this shift, annual per capita CO
2emissions will fall from their
current level of about 3.6 tonnes to 1.15 tonnes in 2050. OECDcountries will be able to reduce their CO
2emissions by about 80%.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario for the USA shows that it ispossible to reduce per capita CO
2emissions from 19 tonnes now to
3 tonnes by 2050. For the EU-27 countries, per capita emissionswill fall from 8 to just under 2 tonnes per capita. Developingcountries such as the Philippines could even keep per capitaemissions at their current level of about 1 tonne of CO
2until 2050,
while maintaining economic growth. A combination of efficiencystandards and renewable energy development proves to be the mostcost effective way to cut CO
2emissions and increase security of
supply by reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports.
Under the global Energy [R]evolution Scenario, China and India
will emit almost half of the remaining CO 2emissions in 2050, while
all OECD countries together will have a share of about 22%.global: CO 2emissions by source
In 2050, coal will be by far the largest source of CO 2, mainly 
from coal-fired power stations in China and India as well as powerstations in other developing countries. Since those emissions aremainly from power stations built between 2000 and 2015, and theaverage lifetime of a coal-fired power plant is calculated at 40years, in order to achieve the projected reduction, the constructionof new coal power stations must end across most of the world by2015 and in developing countries by 2020. 
The second biggest emitter is oil, mainly from the remaining oil
used in the transport sector .

oecd north america: energy demand by sector
Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth
and energy intensity results in future development pathways forNorth America’s energy demand. These are shown in Figure 6.18for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Underthe Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand increases bymore than 40% from the current 115,900 PJ/a to 164,300 PJ/ain 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, primary energydemand decreases by 33% compared to current consumption and isexpected by 2050 to reach 77,700 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected
to decrease in the industry sector , but to grow in the transport as well asin the residential and service sectors (see Figure 6.19). Total electricitydemand will rise to 5,730 TWh/a in the year 2050. Compared to theReference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about2,460 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demand can be achieved inparticular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using the bestavailable technology in all demand sectors. Employment of solararchitecture in both residential and comm ercial buildings will help to
curb the growing demand for active air-conditioning. 
Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger . Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, demand for heat supply will grow up to2030, but after that can even be reduced to below the current level (seeFigure 6.20). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumptionequivalent to 7,850 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. Asa result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residentialbuildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and ‘passivehouses’ for new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energyservices will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.
In the transport sector , it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will decrease by half to 16,720 PJ/aby 2050, saving 65% compared to the Reference Scenario. Thisreduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficientvehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and bychanges in mobility-related behaviour patterns.

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a
dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing share
of renewable electricity. This will compensate for the phasing out ofnuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plantsrequired for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 94% of the electricityproduced in OECD North America will come from renewable energysources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV– will contribute over 85% of electricity generation. 
Figure 6.22 shows the comparative evolution of the different

In addition, ashift to efficient modes of transport like rail, light rail and bus isimportant, especially in the expanding large metropolitan areas.Together with the rising price of fossil fuels, these changes reduce thehuge growth in car sales projected by the Reference Scenario. In theEnergy [R]evolution Scenario, the car fleet still grows by 20% fromthe year 2000 to 2050. However the energy demand of the transportsector is reduced by 47%. Highly efficient propulsion technology,including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery-electric powertrains, willbring large efficiency gains. A quarter of the transport energydemand by 2050 is covered by electricity, 30% by bio fuels.oecd north america: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting

latin america: energy demand by sector
Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth
and energy intensity results in future development pathways forLatin America’s energy demand. These are shown in Figure 6.29 forboth the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under theReference Scenario, total primary energy demand more thandoubles from the current 21,140 PJ/a to 52,300 PJ/a in 2050. Inthe Energy [R]evolution Scenario, a smaller 54% increase oncurrent consumption is expected by 2050, reaching 32,500 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is
expected to increase disproportionately, with households and servicesthe main source of growing consumption. This is due to wider a ccess to
energy services in developing countries (see Figure 6.30). With theexploitation of efficiency measures, however , an even higher increasecan be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around 2,150 TWh/a
in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measuresavoid the generation of about 660 TWh/a. This reduction can beachieved in particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices.Employment of solar architecture in both residential and commercialbuildings will help to curb the growing dem and for air-conditioning. 
Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger . Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply caneven be reduced (see Figure 6.31). Compared to the ReferenceScenario, consumption equivalent to 2,400 PJ/a is avoided throughefficiency gains by 2050. In the transport sector , it is assumedunder the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand willincrease by a fifth to 6,100 PJ/a by 2050, saving 50% comparedto the Reference Scenario.

latin america: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.34 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases thefuture costs of electricity generation compared to the ReferenceScenario. Because of the lower CO
2intensity of electricity
generation, costs will become economically favourable under theEnergy [R]evolution Scenario. By 2050 generation costs will bemore than 8 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, on the other hand, unchecked growth in
demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO
2emissions
result in total electricity supply costs rising from today’s $70 billion peryear to more than $551 bn in 2050. Figure 6.35 shows that the Energy[R]evolution Scenario not only complies with Latin America’s CO
2
reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relieve theeconomic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency and shiftingenergy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for electricitysupply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario. latin america: heat and cooling supply
Today, renewables provide around 40% of primary energy demand for
heat supply in Latin America, the main contribution coming from theuse of biomass. The availability of less efficient but cheap appliances isa severe structural barrier to efficiency gains. Large-scale utilisation ofgeothermal and solar thermal energy for heat supply will be largelyrestricted to the industrial sector . 
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 83% of Latin
America’s total heating and cooling demand in 2050.
Energy efficiency measures restrict the future primary energy
demand for heat and cooling supply to a 60% increase, in spiteof improving living st andards.
In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly replacing conventional fossilfuel-fired heating systems.
A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional
applications leads to a further reduction of CO
2emissions.

Despite a huge growth in services, the increase in energy consumption
in the transport sector by 2050 can be limited to 19% under theEnergy [R]evolution Scenario. Current 90% dependency on fossil fuelsis transformed into a 30% contribution from bio fuels and 22% fromelectricity. The market for cars will grow by a factor of five less than inthe Reference Scenario. Measures are taken to keep the car sales splitby segment like its present breakdown, with one third represented bymedium-sized vehicles and more than half by small vehicles.Technological progress increases the share of hybrid vehicles to 65% in2050. Incentives to use more efficient transport modes reduces vehiclekilometre travelled to in average 11.000 km per annum. latin america: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting
primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolutionScenario is shown in Figure 6.38. Compared to the ReferenceScenario, overall energy demand will be reduced by about 38% in2050. Latin America’s energy demand will increase from 21,000PJ/a to 32,500 PJ/a. Around 70% of this will be covered byrenewable energy sources.

Whilst Latin America’s emissions of CO 2will almost triple under
the Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenariothey will decrease from 830 million tonnes in 2005 to 370 m/t in2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 1.8 tonnes to 0.6t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasingdemand, CO
2emissions will decrease in the electricity sector . In the
long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewableelectricity in vehicles will even reduce CO

oecd europe: energy demand by sector
The future development pathways for Europe’s energy demand are
shown in Figure 6.40 for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolutionScenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demandin OECD Europe increases by more than 10% from the current81,500 PJ/a to 90,300 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolutionScenario, demand decreases by 40% compared to currentconsumption, reaching 48,900 PJ/a by the end of the scenario period.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand in all
three sectors is expected to decrease after 2015 (see Figure 6.41).Because of the growing use of electric vehicles, however , electricityuse for transport increases to 3,520 TWh/a in the year 2050.Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid thegeneration of about 1,460 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demandcan be achieved in particular by introducing highly efficientelectronic devices using the best available technology.Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger . Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even bereduced (see Figure 6.42). Compared to the Reference Scenario,consumption equivalent to 7,350 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gainsby 2050. As a result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock ofresidential buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standardsand new ‘passive houses’, enjoyment of the same comfort and energyservices will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.
In the transport sector , it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will decrease by almost half to 8700PJ/a by 2050, saving 58% compared to the Reference Scenario. Thisreduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficientvehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and bychanges in mobility-related behaviour patterns.

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by
a dynamically growing renewable energy market. This willcompensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce thenumber of fossil fuel-fired power plants required for gridstabilisation. By 2050, 86% of the electricity produced in OECDEurope will come from renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables– mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV – will contribute 67%. 
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 250 GW to 1,030 GW in 2050, increasingrenewables capacity by a factor of four . Figure 6.44 shows theevolution of the different renewable technologies. Up to 2020,hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors to thegrowing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of windwill be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaicsand solar thermal (CSP) energy.
None of these numbers describe a maximum feasibility, but a
possible balanced approach. With the right policy development, thesolar industry believes that a much further uptake could happen.This is particularly true for concentrated solar power (CSP) whichcould unfold to 30GW already by 2020 and more than 120GW in2050. The photovoltaic industry believes in a possible electricitygeneration capacity of 350GW by 2020 in Europe alone, assumingthe necessary policy changes.table 6.4: oecd europe : projection of renewable

the Reference Scenario by 2050, in the Energy [R]evolution Scenariothey will decrease from 4,060 million tonnes in 2005 to 880 m/t in2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 7.6 tonnes to 1.6t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasingdemand, CO
2emissions will decrease in the electricity sector . In the
long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewableelectricity in vehicles will reduce emissions in the transport sector .With a share of 14% of total CO

africa: energy demand by sector
Future development pathways for Africa’s energy demand are shown in
Figure 6.51 for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios.Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand more thandoubles from the current 25,200 PJ/a to 53,300 PJ/a in 2050. In theEnergy [R]evolution Scenario, a much smaller 50% increase oncurrent consumption is expected by 2050 to reach 38,300 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand in Africa
is expected to increase disproportionately, with households andservices the main source of growing consumption (see Figure 6.52).With the exploitation of efficiency measures, however , an even higherincrease can be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around1,340 TWh/a in the year 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario,efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 620 TWh/a. Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are also significant. Under
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply caneven be reduced (see Figure 6.53). Compared to the ReferenceScenario, consumption equivalent to 550 PJ/a is avoided throughefficiency gains by 2050. 
In the transport sector , it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will almost double to 5,300 PJ/a by2050, still saving 46% compared to the Reference Scenario. Thisreduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficientvehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and bychanges in mobility-related behaviour .

africa: electricity generation
The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by
a dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasingshare of renewable electricity. By 2050, 73% of the electricityproduced in Africa will come from renewable energy sources. Amain driver for the development of solar power generationcapacities will be the export of solar electricity to OECD Europe.‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV –will contribute more than 60% of electricity generation. 
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 21 GW to 388 GW in 2050, increasing renewablecapacity by a factor of 18 over the next 42 years. More than 60GW CSP plants will produce electricity for export to Europe.
Figure 6.55 shows the comparative evolution of different renewable
technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remainthe main contributors to the growing market share. After 2020, the
continuing growth of wind will be comp lemented by electricity from

africa: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.56 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases thefuture costs of electricity generation. Because of the lower CO
2
intensity, electricity generation costs will steadily become moreeconomic under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario and by 2050 willbe more than 9 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, by contrast, unchecked demand
growth, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO
2
emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today’s$59 billion per year to more than $468 bn in 2050. Figure 6.57shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies withAfrica’s CO
2reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy
costs. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply torenewables leads to long term costs for electricity supply that areone third lower than in the Reference Scenario.africa: heat and cooling supply
Today, renewables provide around 75% of primary energy demand for
heat supply in Africa, the main contribution coming from the use ofbiomass. The availability of less efficient but cheap appliances is asevere structural barrier to efficiency gains. Large-scale utilisation ofgeothermal and solar thermal energy for heat supply is restricted to theindustrial sector . Dedicated support instruments are required to ensurea continuously dynamic development of renewables in the heat market.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 72% of
Africa’s total heating and cooling demand in 2050.
Energy efficiency measures can restrict the future energy demand
for heat and cooling supply to a 50% increase, in spite ofimproving living st andards.
In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for conventionalfossil-fired heating systems.
A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional
applications leads to a further reduction of CO
2emissions.

This reduction canbe achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting thetransport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-relatedbehaviour . The African car fleet is projected to grow by a factor of 6 toroughly 100 million vehicles. Development of fuel efficiency is delayed by20 years compared to other world regions for economic reasons.

middle east: transport
Traditionally, in a region with major oil resources, transport has been
powered 100% by fossil fuels. Rising prices, together with otherincentives, lead to a projected share of 27% of renewable electricity inthis sector . Highly efficient electrified cars – plug-in-hybrid and batteryvehicles – contribute to a total energy saving of 16%, although the carfleet is still projected to grow by a factor of 5 by 2050. The furtherpromotion of energy efficient transport modes will help to reduceannual vehicle kilometres travelled by 0.25% p.a. middle east: primary energy consumption
Taking into account these assumptions, the resulting primary energy
consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is shown inFigure 6.71. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall energydemand will be reduced by more than 50% in 2050., so the MiddleEast’s demand will increase from 21,420 PJ/a to just 27,590 PJ/a.Over 62% of this will be covered by renewable energy sources.

transition economies: energy demand by sector
Future development pathways for energy demand in the Transition
Economies are shown in Figure 6.73 for both the Reference andEnergy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, totalprimary energy demand increases by 38 % from the current46,250 PJ/a to 63,930 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolutionScenario, demand decreases by 23% compared to currentconsumption and is expected to reach 35,760 PJ/a by 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is
expected to increase disproportionately, with transport and thehouseholds and services sectors being the main source of growingconsumption (see Figure 6.74). With the exploitation of efficiencymeasures, however , an even higher increase can be avoided, leadingto electricity demand of around 1,550 TWh/a in 2050. Compared
to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generationof about 560 TWh/a. 
Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger . Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply caneven be reduced after 2030 (see Figure 6.75). Compared to theReference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 5,990 PJ/a isavoided through efficiency gains. 
In the transport sector , it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will decrease by 28% to 4,240 PJ/aby 2050, saving 57% compared to the Reference Scenario.

transition economies: electricity generation
The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by
a growing renewable energy market. This will compensate for thephasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 81% ofthe electricity produced in the Transition Economy countries willcome from renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainlywind, solar thermal energy and PV – will contribute 65% ofelectricity generation. 
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 93 GW to 550 GW in 2050, increasing capacityby a factor of six over the next 42 years. This will require politicalsupport and well-designed policy instruments.
Figure 6.77 shows the expansion rate of the different renewable
technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind willremain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing growth ofwind will be complemented by electricity from biomass,photovoltaics and geothermal energy.table 6.7: transition economies : projection

transition economies: future costs 
of electricity generation
Figure 6.78 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies under
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs of electricitygeneration compared to the Reference Scenario. This difference will beabout 0.5 cents/kWh in 2015. Because of the lower CO
2intensity of
electricity generation, by 2020 these costs will become economicallyfavourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario and by 2050 will bemore than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Due to growing dem and, there will be a significant increase in society’s
expenditure on electricity supply. Under the Reference Scenario, totalelectricity supply costs will rise from today’s $190 billion per year to$520 bn in 2050. Figure 6.79 shows that the Energy [R]evolutionScenario not only complies with the Transition Economies’ CO
2
reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relievethe economic pressure on society. Long term costs for electricitysupply are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario. transition economies: heat and cooling supply
Renewables currently provide just 3% of the Transition Economies’
primary energy demand for heat supply, the main contribution comingfrom the use of biomass. The lack of available infrastructure for modernand efficient district heating networks is a barrier to the large scaleutilisation of biomass, geothermal and solar thermal energy. Dedicatedsupport instruments are required to ensure a dynamic development.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 75% of the
Transition Economies’ total heating demand in 2050.
Energy efficiency measures can moderate the increase in heat
demand, and in spite of improving l iving st andards after 2030
lead to a decrease in demand, which in 2050 is slightly lowerthan at present. 
For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for fossil fuel-fired systems.
A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional
applications will lead to a further reduction of CO
2emissions.

Development of the transport sector is characterised by the
diversification of energy sources towards bio fuels (9%) and electricity(28%) up to 2050. The time taken to reach reference target levels forefficient vehicles is delayed by ten years compared to the most otherindustrialised countries. Although the light duty vehicle stock will tripleby 2050, increasingly attractive and highly efficient suburban and longdistance rail services, as well as growing fuel prices, will lead to thevehicle kilometres travelled falling by 10% between 2010 and 2050.These measures and incentives, together with highly efficient cars, willresult in nearly 30% energy savings in the transport sector .transition economies: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the changes outlined above, the resulting primary
energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is shownin Figure 6.82. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall energydemand will be reduced by 44% in 2050. Around 60% of theremaining demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.

india: energy demand by sector
The potential future development pathways for India’s primary
energy demand are shown in Figure 6.84 for both the Reference andEnergy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, totalprimary energy demand quadruples from the current 22,300 PJ/a to89,100 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, bycontrast, demand will increase by about 230 % and is expected toreach 52,000 PJ/a by 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is
expected to increase substantially (see Figure 6.85). With theexploitation of efficiency measures, however , a higher increase can beavoided, leading to demand of around 3,500 TWh/a in 2050.Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid thegeneration of about 1,410 TWh/a. This reduction can be achieved inparticular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using the
best available technology in all demand sectors. 
Efficiency gains for heat and cooling supply are also significant.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heatingand cooling can even be reduced (see Figure 6.86). Compared to theReference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 3,130 PJ/a is avoidedthrough efficiency gains by 2050. 
In the transport sector it is assumed that a fast growing economy
will see energy demand, even under the Energy [R]evolutionScenario, increase dramatically - from 1,550 PJ/a in 2005 to 8,700PJ/a by 2050. This still saves 50% compared to the ReferenceScenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highlyefficient vehicles, shifting freight transport from road to rail and bychanges in travel behaviour .

india: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.89 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases thefuture costs of electricity generation compared to the ReferenceScenario. Because of the lower CO
2intensity, electricity generation
costs will become economically favourable under the Energy[R]evolution Scenario and by 2050 will be more than 4.5cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, a massive growth in demand,
increased fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO
2emissions result in
total electricity supply costs rising from today’s $64 billion per yearto more than $930 bn in 2050. Figure 6.90 shows that the Energy[R]evolution Scenario not only complies with India’s CO
2reduction
targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Increasing energyefficiency and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to longterm costs that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario. india: heat and cooling supply
Renewables presently provide 63% of primary energy demand for heat
and cooling supply in India, the main contribution coming from the useof biomass. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure acontinuously dynamic development of renewables in the heat market.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables will provide 71% of
India’s heating and cooling demand by 2050.
Energy efficiency measures will restrict future primary energy
demand for heat and cooling supply to an increase of 90% by2005, in spite of improving living standards. This compares to130% in the Reference Scenario.
In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas and
geothermal energy are increasingly replacing conventional fossil-fired heating systems.
A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional
applications leads to a further reduction of CO
2emissions.

India’s car fleet is projected to grow by a factor of 16 from 2000 to
2050. Presently characterised by small cars (70%), this will stay thesame up to 2050. Although India will remain a low price car market,the key to efficiency lies in electrified powertrains (hybrid, plug-in andbattery electric). Biofuels will take over 6% and electricity 22% oftotal transport energy demand. Stringent energy efficiency measureswill help limit growth of transport energy demand by 2050 to about afactor of 5.5 compared to 2005.india: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the above assumptions, the resulting primary
energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario isshown in Figure 6.93. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overalldemand will be reduced by about 40% in 2050. Around half of thiswill be covered by renewable energy sources. 
india: development of CO
2emissions
While CO 2emissions in India will increase under the Reference
Scenario by a factor of 5.4 up to 2050, and are thus far removedfrom a sustainable development path, under the Energy[R]evolution Scenario they will increase from the current 1,074million tonnes in 2005 to reach a peak of 1,820 m/t in 2030. Afterthat they will decrease to 1,660 m/t in 2050. Annual per capitaemissions will increase to 1.3 tonnes/capita in 2030 and fall againto 1.0 t/capita in 2050. In spite of the phasing out of nuclearenergy and increasing electricity demand, CO
2emissions will
decrease in the electricity sector . 
After 2030, efficiency gains and the increased use of renewables in
all sectors will soften the still increasing CO 2emissions in transport,
the power sector and industry. Although its share is decreasing, thepower sector will remain the largest source of emissions in India,contributing 50% of the total in 2050, followed by transport.figure 6.92: india: transport under the two scenarios

developing asia: energy demand by sector
The future development pathways for Developing Asia’s primary
energy demand are shown in Figure 6.95 for both the Referenceand Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario,total primary energy demand more than doubles from the current31,100 PJ/a to 67,400 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolutionScenario, a much smaller 40% increase in consumption is expectedby 2050, reaching 43,800 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected
to increase disproportionately in Developing Asia (see Figure 6.96).With the introduction of serious efficiency measures, however , an evenhigher increase can be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around1,965 TWh/a in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiencymeasures avoid the generation of about 860 TWh/a. Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are also significant (see
Figure 6.97). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumptionequivalent to 2,900 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency measures by2050. In the transport sector , it is assumed under the Energy[R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will rise to 8,300 PJ/aby 2050, saving 90% compared to the Reference Scenario.

developing asia: future costs 
of electricity generation
Figure 6.100 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases thefuture costs of electricity generation compared to the ReferenceScenario. Because of lower CO
2intensity in electricity generation,
costs will become economically favourable under the Energy[R]evolution Scenario. By 2050 they will be more than 5cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, unchecked growth in demand, an
increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO
2emissions result in
total electricity supply costs rising from today’s $98 billion per year tomore than $566 bn in 2050. Figure 6.101 shows that the Energy[R]evolution Scenario not only complies with Developing Asia’s CO
2
reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Increasingenergy efficiency and shifting supply to renewables leads to long termcosts that are almost one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.developing asia: heat and cooling supply
The starting point for renewables in the heat supply sector is quite
different from the power sector . Today, renewables provide 53% ofprimary energy demand for heat and cooling supply in Developing Asia,the main contribution coming from biomass. Dedicated supportinstruments are still required to ensure a continuously dynamicdevelopment of renewables in the heat market.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 70% of
Developing Asia’s heating and cooling demand in 2050.
Energy efficiency measures can restrict the future primary energy
demand for heat and cooling supply to a increase of 48%,compared to 77% in the Reference Scenario, in spite ofimproving living st andards.
In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas and
geothermal energy are increasingly replacing conventional fossilfuel-fired heating systems.
A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional
applications leads to a further reduction of CO
2emissions.

china: energy demand by sector
The future development pathways for China’s primary energy
demand are shown in Figure 6.106 for both the Reference andEnergy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, totalprimary energy demand will increase by a factor of 2.5 from thecurrent 73,000 PJ/a to 185,020 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy[R]evolution Scenario, primary energy demand increases up to2030 by 60% and decreases to a level of 99,150 PJ/a in 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is
expected to increase disproportionately (see Figure 6.107). Withthe exploitation of efficiency measures, however , an even higherincrease can be avoided, leading to demand of around 7,500 TWh/ain 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measuresavoid the generation of about 3,160 TWh/a. Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are large as well. Under
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply caneven be reduced (see Figure 6.108). Compared to the ReferenceScenario, consumption equivalent to 10,300 PJ/a is avoidedthrough efficiency gains by 2050. 
In the transport sector , it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will increase considerably, from 5,100PJ/a in 2005 to 17,300 PJ/a by 2050. However this still saves50% compared to the Reference Scenario.

A dynamically growing renewable energy market will compensate
for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number offossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By2050, 63% of the electricity produced in China will come fromrenewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solarthermal energy and PV – will contribute 46% of electricitygeneration. The following strategy paves the way for a futurerenewable energy supply:
Rising electricity demand will be met initially by bringing into
operation new highly efficient gas-fired combined-cycle powerplants, plus an increasing capacity of wind turbines and biomass. Inthe long term, wind will be the most important single source ofelectricity generation. Solar energy, hydro-power and biomass willalso make substantial contributions.
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 119 GW to 1,950 GW in 2050, an enormousincrease resulting in a considerable demand for investment over thenext 20 years. Figure 6.110 shows the comparative evolution of thedifferent renewable technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors.

china: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.111 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costsof electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. Thedifference will be less than 1 cents/kWh up to 2020. Because of thelower CO
2intensity, by 2020 electricity generation costs in China
will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolutionScenario, and by 2050 will be more than 5 cents/kWh below thosein the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, the unchecked growth in demand, the
increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO
2emissions result in total
electricity supply costs rising from today’s $ 205 billion per year to morethan $ 1,940 bn in 2050. Figure 6.112 shows that the Energy[R]evolution Scenario not only complies with China’s CO
2reduction
targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Increasing energy efficiencyand shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs forelectricity supply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario. china: heat and cooling supply
Today, renewables provide 28% of primary energy demand for heat
and cooling supply in China, the main contribution coming from theuse of biomass.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 65% of
China’s total heating and cooling demand by 2050.
Energy efficiency measures will restrict the future primary energy
demand for heat and cooling supply to an increase of 21%,compared to 61% in the Reference Scenario, in spite ofimproving living st andards.
In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as

In 2050, the light duty vehicle stock in China will be 20 times larger
than today. Today, more medium to large sized cars are driven in China,with an unusually high annual mileage. With growing ind ividual mobility,
an increasing share of small efficient cars is projected, with vehiclekilometres driven converging with industrialised country averages. Moreefficient propulsion technologies, including hybrid-electric powertrainsand lightweight construction, will help limit the increase in totaltransport energy demand to a factor of 3.4, reaching 17,300 PJ/a in2050. As China already has a large fleet of electric vehicles, this willgrow to the point where almost 25% of total transport energy iscovered by electricity. Bio fuels will contribute about 7%.china: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the above assumptions, the resulting primary
energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario isshown in Figure 6.115. Compared to the Reference Scenario,overall energy demand will be reduced by almost 47 in 2050.Around 47% of the remaining demand will be covered byrenewable energy sources.

oecd pacific: energy demand by sector
The future development pathways for the OECD Pacific’s primary
energy demand are shown in Figure 6.117 for both the Reference andEnergy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, totalprimary energy demand increases by 27% - from the current 37,040PJ/a to 47,020 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario,by contrast, primary energy demand decreases by 33% compared tocurrent consumption and is expected by 2050 to reach 24,950 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand in the
industry as well as the residential and services sectors is expected tofall slightly below the current level of demand (see Figure 6.118).The growing use of electric vehicles however leads to an increase inelectricity demand, reaching 1,920 TWh/a in 2050. Overall demandis still 560 TWh/a lower than in the Reference Scenario. Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger . Under the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply caneven be reduced (see Figure 6.119). Compared to the ReferenceScenario, consumption equivalent to 2,860 PJ/a is avoided throughefficiency gains by 2050. 
In the transport sector , it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario that energy demand will decrease by 40% to 4,000 PJ/aby 2050, saving about 50% compared to the Reference Scenario.

oecd pacific: electricity generation
A dynamically growing renewable energy market will compensate
for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number offossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By2050, 78% of the electricity produced in the OECD Pacific willcome from renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainlywind, solar thermal energy and PV – will contribute 68%. 
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow
from the current 62 GW to more than 600 GW in 2050, anincrease by a factor of ten. 
To achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable energy
sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is ofgreat importance. Figure 6.121 shows the comparative evolution ofthe different renewables over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power andwind will remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuinggrowth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass,photovoltaic and solar thermal energy.table 6.11: oecd pacific : projection of renewable

oecd pacific: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.122 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costsof electricity generation in the OECD Pacific compared to theReference Scenario. The difference will be less than 1.5 cents/kWhup to 2030. Because of the lower CO
2intensity, by 2020 electricity
generation costs will become economically favourable under theEnergy [R]evolution Scenario, and by 2050 they will be more than4 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, by contrast, unchecked growth in
demand, an increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO
2
emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today’s$160 billion per year to more than $400 bn in 2050. Figure 6.123shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies withthe OECD Pacific’s CO
2reduction targets but also helps to stabilise
energy costs. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supplyto renewables leads to long term costs for electricity supply thatare one third lower than in the Reference Scenario. oecd pacific: heat and cooling supply
Renewables currently provide 5% of OECD Pacific’s primary
energy demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming frombiomass. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure afuture dynamic development.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 73% of
OECD Pacific’s total heating and cooling demand by 2050.
Energy efficiency measures can decrease the current demand for
heat supply by 10%, in spite of improving l iving st andards.
For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as
geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for fossil fuel-fired systems.
A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional
applications will lead to a further reduction of CO
2emissions.

The low duty vehicles (LDV) market in OECD Pacific is driven by
Japan, with a unique share of small cars and a fuel consumptionaverage of 6.45 litres/100 km in the new car fleet. Other countries in theregion typically drive larger cars, and incentives to encourage smallercars will be crucial. The LDV stock is projected to grow by a factor of1.4 to 119 million vehicles. While 94% of all LDVs use petrol today,electrified vehicles will play a key role, especially in Japan’s well suitedsmall cars, in reducing energy demand. By 2050, 35% of total transportenergy is covered by electricity and 25% by bio fuels.oecd pacific: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the above assumptions, the resulting primary

Annual per capita emissions will fall from 9.5tonnes to 2.4 t. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased useof renewable electricity in vehicles will even reduce CO

101global market overview
source FOR PAGE 101+102: RENEWABLE 2007 - GLOBAL STATUS REPORT, REN 21, ERIC MARTINOT
The global market for renewable energy has been expanding in
recent years at a record rate, an indication of its potential to realisethe future targets outlined in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.
 Renewable electricity generation capacity reached an
estimated 240 Gigawatts (GW) worldwide in 2007, an increaseof 50 % over 2004. Renewables represent 5 % of global powercapacity and 3.4 % of global power generation. These figuresexclude large hydropower , which alone accounted for 15 % ofglobal power generation.
Renewable energy (excluding large hydropower) generated as
much electric power worldwide in 2006 as one-quarter of the
world’s nuclear power plants. 
The largest component of renewable generation capacity is wind
power , which grew by 28 % worldwide in 2007 to reach 95 GW.The annual capacity growth rate is even higher: 40 % more in2007 than the year before.
The fastest growing energy technology in the world is 
grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV) , with a 50 % annual
increase in cumulative installed capacity in both 2006 and 2007to reach 7.7 GW. This translates into 1.5 million homes withrooftop solar PV feeding into the grid.
Rooftop solar heat collectors provide hot water to nearly 50
million households worldwide, and space heating to a growingnumber of homes. Existing solar hot water/heating capacityincreased by 19 % in 2006 to reach 105 Gigawatts thermal(GWth) globally.
The use of biomass and geothermal energy for both power and
heating has been increasing in a number of countries, including fordistrict heating networks. More than 2 million ground source heatpumps are now used in 30 countries to heat (and cool) buildings.
 Renewable energy , in particular small hydropower , biomass and
solar PV, is providing electricity, heat, motive power and waterpumping for tens of millions of people in the rural areas ofdeveloping countries, serving agriculture, small industry, homesand schools. 25 million households cook and light their homeswith biogas and 2.5 million households use solar lighting systems.
 Developing countries account for more than 40 % of existing
renewable power capacity, more than 70 % of solar hot watercapacity and 45 % of bio fuels production. 
In terms of investment, an estimated $71 billion was invested in
new renewable power and heating capacity worldwide in 2007(excluding large hydropower). Of this, 47 % was for wind powerand 30 % for solar PV. Investment in large hydropower , the mostestablished renewable energy source, added a further $15–20billion. The total amount invested in new renewable energy capacity,manufacturing plants and research and development during 2007 isestimated to have reached a record $100 billion.Investment flows have also became more diversified and mainstream,
with funding flowing from a wide range of sources, including majorcommercial and investment banks, venture capital and private equity
investors, multilateral and bilateral development organisations as wellas smaller local financiers. The renewable energy industry has seenmany new companies launched, huge increases in company valuationsand numerous initial public offerings. The 140 highest-valued publiclytraded renewable energy companies now have a combined marketcapitalisation of over $100 billion. 
Major industrial growth is occu rring in a number of emerging
renewable technologies, including thin-film solar PV, concentratingsolar thermal power generation and advanced or second generationbio fuels. Worldwide employment in renewable energymanufacturing, operation and maintenance exceeded 2.4 millionjobs in 2006, including some 1.1 million in bio fuels production. 
The main reason for this industrial expansion is that national
targets for renewable energy have been adopted in at least 66countries worldwide, including all 27 European Union memberstates, 29 US states and nine Canadian provinces. Most targets arefor a percentage of electricity production or primary energy to beachieved by a specific future year . There is now an EU-wide target,for example, for 20 % of energy to come from renewables by 2020and a Chinese target of 15 %. Targets for bio fuel use in transportenergy also now exist in several countries, including an EU-widetarget for 10 % by 2020.
Specific policies to promote renewables have also mushroomed in
recent years. At least 60 countries - 37 developed and transitioncountries and 23 developing countries - have adopted some type ofpolicy to promote renewable power generation. The most common isthe feed-in law, through which a set premium price is paid for eachunit of renewable power generation. By 2007, at least 37 countriesand nine states or provinces had adopted feed-in policies, more thanhalf of which have been enacted since 2002. At least 44 states,provinces and countries have enacted renewable portfolio standards(RPS), which place an obligation on energy companies to source arising percentage of their power from renewable sources. Otherforms of support for renewable power generation include capitalinvestment subsidies or rebates, tax incentives and credits, sales taxand value-added tax exemptions, net met ering, public inves tment or
financing and public competitive bidding. 
Beneath a national and state level, municipalities around the world
are also setting targets for future shares of renewable energy,typically in the range of 10–20 %. Some cities have establishedcarbon dioxide reduction targets, others are enacting policies topromote solar hot water and solar PV or introducing urban planningrules which incorporate renewable energy. Market facilitationorganisations are supporting the growth of renewable energymarkets and policies through networking, market research, training,project facilitation, consulting, financing, policy advice and othertechnical assistance. There are now hundreds of such organisationsaround the world, including industry associations, non-governmentalorganisations, multilateral and bilateral development agencies,international partnerships and government agencies.

growth rates of the renewable energy industry
Figure 7.2 shows that many renewable energy technologies grew at
rates of 15–30 % annually during the five year period 2002–2006,including wind power , solar hot water , geothermal heating and off-grid solar PV. Grid-connected solar PV eclipsed all of these, with a60 % annual average growth rate for the period. Bio fuels also grewrapidly during the period, at a 40 % annual average for biodieseland 15 % for ethanol. Other technologies are growing more slowly,at 3–5 %, including large hydropower , biomass power and heat, andgeothermal power , although in some countries these technologies aregrowing much more rapidly than the global average. 
These expansion rates compare with the global growth rates for fossil
fuels of 2–4 % in recent years (higher in some developing countries)

future growth rates 
In order to get a better understanding of what different
technologies can deliver , however , it is necessary to examine moreclosely how future production capacities can be achieved from thecurrent baseline. The wind industry, for example, has a currentannual production capacity of about 25,000 MW. If this outputwere not expanded, total capacity would reach 650 GW by the year2050. This includes the need for “repow ering” of older wind
turbines after 20 years. But according to this scenario the share ofwind electricity in global production by 2050 would need to growfrom today’s 1% to 4.5% under the Reference Scenario and 6.5%under the Energy [R]evolution pathway. A relatively modest expansion from today’s 25 GW production
capacity, however , to about 80 GW by 2020 and 100 GW in 2040would lead to a total installed capacity of 1,800 GW in 2050,providing between 12% and 18% of world electricity demand.
The tables below provide an overview of current generation levels,
the capacities required under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario andindustry projections of a more advanced market growth. The goodnews is that the scenario does not even come close to the limit ofthe renewable industries’ own projections. However , the scenarioassumes that at the same time strong energy efficiency measuresare taken in order to save resources and develop a more costoptimised energy supply.

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
investment in new power plants 
The overall global level of investment required in new power plants
up to 2030 will be in the region of $ 11 to 14 trillion. The maindriver for investment in new generation capacity in OECD countrieswill be the ageing power plant fleet. Utilities will make theirtechnology choices within the next five to ten years based on nationalenergy policies, in particular market liberalisation, renewable energyand CO
2reduction targets. Within Europe, the EU emissions trading
scheme may have a major impact on whether the majority ofinvestment goes into fossil fuel power plants or renewable energy andco-generation. In developing countries, international financialinstitutions will play a major role in future technology choices. 
The investment volume required to realise the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario is $ 14.7 trillion, approximately 30% higher than in theReference Scenario, which will require $ 11.3 trillion. Whilst thelevels of investment in renewable energy and fossil fuels are almostequal under the Reference Scenario, with about $ 4.5 trillion eachup to 2030, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario shifts about 80% ofinvestment towards renewable energy. The fossil fuel share of powersector investment is focused mainly on combined heat and powerand efficient gas-fired power plants.
The average annual investment in the power sector under the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario between 2005 and 2030 is approximately $ 590 billion. This is equal to the current amount of subsidies forfossil fuels globally in less than two years. Most investment in newpower generation will take place in China, followed by NorthAmerica and Europe. South Asia, including India, and East Asia,including Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, will also be ‘hotspots’ of new power generation investment.7futu[r]e investment |POWER PLANTS

107renewable power generation investment 
Under the Reference Scenario the investment expected in renewable
electricity generation will be $ 4.7 trillion. This compares with $ 8.9 trillion in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. The regionaldistribution in the two scenarios, however , is almost the same.
How investment is d ivided between the d ifferent renewable power
generation technologies depends on their level of technicaldevelopment. Technologies like wind power , which in some regionswith good wind resources is already cost competitive withconventional fuels, will take a larger investment volume and abigger market share. The market volume by technology and regionalso depends on the local resources and policy framework. 
For solar photovoltaics, the main market will remain for some
years in Europe and the US, but will soon expand across China andIndia. Because solar PV is a highly modular and decentralisedtechnology which can be used almost everywhere, its market willeventually be spread across the entire world.Concentrated solar power systems, on the other hand, can only be
operated within the world’s sunbelt regions. The main investment inthis technology will therefore take place in North Africa, theMiddle East, parts of the USA and Mexico, as well as south-westChina, India, Australia and southern Europe. 
The main development of the wind industry will take place in Europe,
North America and China. Offshore wind technology will take alarger share from roughly 2015 onwards. The main offshore winddevelopment will take place in North Europe and North America. 
The market for geothermal power plants will be mainly in North
America and East Asia. The USA, Indonesia and the Philippines,and some countries of central and southern Africa, have the highestpotential over the next 20 years. After 2030, geothermal generationwill expand to other parts of the world, including Europe and India.
Bio energy power plants will be distributed across the whole world
as there is potential almost everywhere for biomass and/or biogas(cogeneration) power plants.7futu[r]e investment |POWER GENERATION

108GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
fossil fuel power generation investment 
Under the Reference Scenario, the main market expansion for new
fossil fuel power plants will be in China, followed by North America,which will have a volume equal to India and Europe combined. Inthe Energy [R]evolution Scenario the overall investment in fossil fuelpower stations up to 2030 will be $ 2,600 billion, significantly lowerthan the Reference Scenario’s $ 4,500 billion.
China will be by far the largest investor in coal power plants in both
scenarios. While in the Reference Scenario the growth trend of thecurrent decade (2000–2010) will continue towards 2030, theEnergy [R]evolution Scenario assumes that in the second and thirddecades (2011-2030) growth slows down significantly. In theReference Scenario the massive expansion of coal firing is due toactivity in China, followed by the USA, India, East Asia and Europe. 
The total cost for fossil fuel investment in the Reference Scenario between
2005 and 2030 amounts to $ 80.6 trillion, compared to $ 61.8 trillion inthe Energy [R]evolution Scenario. This means that fuel costs in the Energy[R]evolution Scenario are already about 25% lower by 2030 and will be50% lower by 2050. Although the investment in gas-fired power stations
and cogeneration plants is about the same in both scenarios, the financecommitted to oil and coal for electricity generation in the Energy[R]evolution Scenario is almost 30% below the Reference version.
fuel cost savings with renewables 
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the total fuel cost savingsin the Energy [R]evolution Scenario reach a total of $18.7 trillion, or $ 750 billion per year . A comparison between the extra fuel costsassociated with the Reference Scenario and the extra investment costsof the Energy [R]evolution version shows that the average annualadditional fuel costs are about five times higher than the additionalinvestment requirements of the alternative scenario. In fact, theadditional costs for coal fuel from today until the year 2030 are ashigh as $ 15.9 trillion: this would cover the entire investment inrenewable and cogeneration capacity required to implement the Energy[R]evolution Scenario. These renewable energy sources will produceelectricity without any further fuel costs beyond 2030, while the costsfor coal and gas will continue to be a burden on national economies.

110GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
The issue of security of supply is now at the top of the energy policy
agenda. Concern is focused both on price security and the securityof physical supply. At present around 80% of global energy demandis met by fossil fuels. The unrelenting increase in energy demand ismatched by the finite nature of these sources. The regionaldistribution of oil and gas resources, on the other hand, does notmatch the distribution of demand. Some countries have to relyalmost entirely on fossil fuel imports. The maps on the followingpages provide an overview of the availability of different fuels andtheir regional distribution. Information in this chapter is basedpartly on the report ‘Plugging the Gap’
36.
oil
Oil is the lifeblood of the modern global economy, as the effects ofthe supply disruptions of the 1970s made clear . It is the numberone source of energy, providing 36% of the world’s needs and thefuel employed almost exclusively for essential uses such astransportation. However , a passionate debate has developed over theability of supply to meet increasing consumption, a debate obscuredby poor information and stirred by recent soaring prices.the reserves chaos
Public data about oil and gas reserves is strikingly inconsistent, andpotentially unreliable for legal, commercial, historical andsometimes political reasons. The most widely available and quotedfigures, those from the industry journals Oil & Gas Journal andWorld Oil, have limited value as they report the reserve figuresprovided by companies and governments without analysis orverification. Moreover , as there is no agreed definition of reserves orstandard reporting practice, these figures usually stand for differentphysical and conceptual magnitudes. Confusing t erminology
(‘proved’, ‘probable’, ‘possible’, ‘recoverable’, ‘reasonable certainty’)only adds to the problem. 
Historically, private oil companies have consistently underestimated
their reserves to comply with conservative stock exchange rules andthrough natural comm ercial caution. Whenever a discovery was
made, only a portion of the geologist’s estimate of recoverableresources was reported; subsequent revisions would then increasethe reserves from that same oil field over time. National oilcompanies, mostly represented by OPEC (Organisation ofPetroleum Exporting Countries), are not subject to any sort ofaccountability, so their reporting practices are even less clear . Inthe late 1980s, OPEC countries blatantly overstated their reserveswhile competing for production quotas, which were allocated as aproportion of the reserves. Although some revision was needed afterthe companies were nationalised, between 1985 and 1990, OPECcountries increased their joint reserves by 82%. Not only werethese dubious revisions never corrected, but many of these countrieshave reported untouched reserves for years, even if no sizeablediscoveries were made and production continued at the same pace.Additionally, the Former Soviet Union’s oil and gas reserves havebeen overestimated by about 30% because the original assessmentswere later misinterpreted. 
Whilst private companies are now becoming more realistic about the
extent of their resources, the OPEC countries hold by far themajority of the reported reserves, and information on their resourcesis as unsatisfactory as ever . In brief, these information sourcesshould be treated with considerable caution. To fairly estimate theworld’s oil resources a regional assessment of the mean backdated(i.e. ‘technical’) discoveries would need to be performed.

1118energy resources & security of supply |GAS - COALgas
Natural gas has been the fastest growing fossil energy source in the
last two decades, boosted by its increasing share in the electricitygeneration mix. Gas is generally regarded as an abundant resourceand public concerns about depletion are limited to oil, even thoughfew in-depth studies address the subject. Gas resources are moreconcentrated, and a few massive fields make up most of thereserves: the largest gas field in the world holds 15% of the‘Ultimate Recoverable Resources’ (URR), compared to 6% for oil.Unfortunately, information about gas resources suffers from thesame bad practices as oil data because gas mostly comes from thesame geological formations, and the same stakeholders are involved. 
Most reserves are initially understated and then gradually revised
upwards, g iving an optimis tic impression of growth. By contrast,
Russia’s reserves, the largest in the world, are considered to havebeen overestimated by about 30%. Owing to geological similarities,gas follows the same depletion dynamic as oil, and thus the samediscovery and production cycles. In fact, existing data for gas is ofworse quality than for oil, with ambiguities arising over the amountproduced partly because flared and vented gas is not alwaysaccounted for . As opposed to published reserves, the technical oneshave been almost constant since 1980 because discoveries haveroughly matched production. coal 
Coal was the world’s largest source of primary energy until it wasovertaken by oil in the 1960s. Today, coal supplies almost onequarter of the world’s energy. Despite being the most abundant offossil fuels, coal’s development is currently threatened byenvironmental concerns; hence its future will unfold in the contextof both energy security and global warming.
Coal is abundant and more equally distributed throughout the world
than oil and gas. Global recoverable reserves are the largest of allfossil fuels, and most countries have at least some. Moreover , existingand prospective big energy consumers like the US, China and Indiaare self-sufficient in coal and will be for the foreseeable future. Coalhas been exploited on a large scale for two centuries, so both theproduct and the available resources are well known; no substantialnew deposits are expected to be discovered. Extrapolating thedemand forecast forward, the world will consume 20% of its currentreserves by 2030 and 40% by 2050. Hence, if current trends aremaintained, coal would still last several hundred years.

nuclear
Uranium, the fuel used in nuclear power plants, is a finite resource
whose economically available reserves are limited. Its distribution isalmost as concentrated as oil and does not match regionalconsumption. Five countries - Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan,Russia and Niger - control three quarters of the world’s supply. Asa significant user of uranium, however , Russia’s reserves will beexhausted within ten years.
Secondary sources, such as old deposits, currently make up nearly
half of worldwide uranium reserves. However , those will soon beused up. Mining capacities will have to be nearly doubled in thenext few years to meet current needs. A joint report by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency
37and the
International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that all existingnuclear power plants will have used up their nuclear fuel, employingcurrent technology, within less than 70 years. Given the range ofscenarios for the worldwide development of nuclear power , it islikely that uranium supplies will be exhausted sometime between2026 and 2070. This forecast includes the use of mixed oxide fuel(MOX), a mixture of uranium and plutonium. table 8.2: assumptions on fossil fuel use in the energy [r]evolution scenario

122GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
renewable energy
Nature offers a variety of freely available options for producing
energy. Their exploitation is mainly a question of how to convertsunlight, wind, biomass or water into electricity, heat or power asefficiently, sustainably and cost-effectively as possible.
On average, the energy in the sunshine that reaches the Earth is
about one kilowatt per square metre worldwide. According to theResearch Association for Solar Power , power is gushing fromrenewable energy sources at a rate of 2,850 times more energy thanis needed in the world. In one day, the sunlight which reaches theEarth produces enough energy to satisfy the world’s current powerrequirements for eight years. Even though only a percentage of thatpotential is technically accessible, this is still enough to provide justunder six times more power than the world currently requires.definition of types of energy resource potential38
theoretical potential The theoretical potential identifies the
physical upper limit of the energy available from a certain source.For solar energy, for example, this would be the total solarradiation falling on a particular surface.
conversion potential This is derived from the annual efficiency of
the respective conversion technology. It is therefore not a strictlydefined value, since the efficiency of a particular technologydepends on technological progress.
technical potential This takes into account additional restrictions
regarding the area that is realistically available for energygeneration. Technological, structural and ecological restrictions, aswell as legislative requirements, are accounted for .
economic potential The proportion of the technical potential that
can be utilised economically. For biomass, for example, thosequantities are included that can be exploited economically incompetition with other products and land uses.
sustainable potential This limits the potential of an energy source
based on evaluation of ecological and socio-economic factors. 8energy resources & security of supply |RENEWABLE ENERGY

123renewable energy potential by region 
and technology
Based on the report ‘Renewable Energy Potentials’ from REN 21, aglobal policy network
39, we can provide a more detailed overview of
renewable energy prospects by world region and technology. Thetable below focuses on large economies, which consume 80 % ofthe world’s primary energy and produce a similar share of theworld’s greenhouse gas emissions. 
Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology can be harnessed almost
everywhere, and its technical potential is estimated at over 1,500EJ/year , closely followed by concentrating solar thermal power(CSP). These two cannot simply be added together , however ,because they would require much of the same land resources. Theonshore wind potential is equally vast, with almost 400 EJ/yearavailable beyond the order of magnitude of future electricityconsumption. The estimate for offshore wind potential (22 EJ/year)is cautious, as only wind intensive areas on ocean shelf areas, witha relatively shallow water depth, and outside shipping lines andprotected areas, are included. The various ocean or marine energy
potentials also reach a similar magnitude, most of it from oceanwaves. Cautious estimates reach a figure of around 50 EJ/year . Theestimates for hydro and geothermal resources are well established,each having a technical potential of around 50 EJ/year . Thosefigures should be seen in the context of a current global energydemand of around 500 EJ. 
In terms of heating and cooling, apart from using biomass, there is
the option of using direct geothermal energy. The potential isextremely large and could cover 20 times the current world energydemand for heat. The potential for solar heating, including passivesolar building design, is virtually limitless. However , heat is costly totransport and one should only consider geothermal heat and solarwater heating potentials which are sufficiently close to the point ofconsumption. Passive solar technology, which contributesenormously to the provision of heating services, is not considered asa (renewable energy) supply source in this analysis but as anefficiency factor to be taken into account in the demand forecasts.

124GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
the global potential for sustainable biomass 
As part of background research for the Energy [R]evolution
Scenario, Greenpeace commissioned the German Biomass ResearchCentre, the former Institute for Energy and Environment, toinvestigate the worldwide potential for energy crops in differentscenarios up to 2050. In addition, information has been compiledfrom scientific studies of the worldwide potential and from dataderived from state of the art remote sensing techniques such assatellite images. A summary of the report’s findings is given below;references can be found in the full report. 
assessment of biomass potential studies 
Various studies have looked historically at the potential for bioenergy and come up with widely diff ering results. Comparison
between them is difficult because they use different definitions ofthe various biomass resource fractions. This problem is particularlysignificant in relation to forest derived biomass. Most research hasfocused almost exclusively on energy crops, as their development isconsidered to be more significant for satisfying the demand for bioenergy. The result is that the potential for using forest residues(wood left over after harvesting) is often underestimated. 
Data from 18 studies has been examined, with a concentration on
those studies which report the potential for biomass residues.Among these there were ten comprehensive assessments with moreor less detailed documentation of the methodology. The majorityfocus on the long-term potential for 2050 and 2100. Littleinformation is available for 2020 and 2030. Most of the studieswere published within the last ten years. Figure 8.2 shows thevariations in potential by biomass type from the different studies. Looking at the contribution of ind ividual resources to the total
biomass potential, the majority of studies agree that the mostpromising resource is energy crops from dedicated plantations. Onlysix give a regional breakdown, however , and only a few quantify alltypes of residues separately. Quantifying the potential of minorfractions, such as animal residues and organic wastes, is difficult asthe data is relatively poor .

125potential of energy crops 
Apart from the utilisation of biomass from residues, the cultivation
of energy crops in agricultural production systems is of greatestsignificance. The technical potential for growing energy crops hasbeen calculated on the assumption that demand for food takespriority. As a first step the demand for arable and grassland forfood production has been calculated for each of 133 countries indifferent scenarios. These scenarios are: 
Business as usual (BAU) scenario: Present agricultural activity
continues for the foreseeable future
Basic scenario: No forest clearing; reduced use of fallow areas
for agriculture 
Sub-scenario 1: Basic scenario plus expanded ecological
protection areas and reduced crop yields 
Sub-scenario 2: Basic scenario plus food consumption reduced 
in industrialised countries 
Sub-scenario 3: Combination of sub-scenarios 1 and 2 In a next step the surpluses of agricultural areas were classified
either as arable land or grassland. On grassland, hay and grasssilage are produced, on arable land fodder silage and ShortRotation Coppice (such as fast-growing willow or poplar) arecultivated. Silage of green fodder and grass are assumed to be usedfor biogas production, wood from SRC and hay from grasslands forthe production of heat, electricity and synthetic fuels. Countryspecific yield variations were taken into consideration.
The result is that the global biomass potential from energy crops in
2050 falls within a range from 6 EJ in Sub-scenario 1 up to 97 EJin the BAU scenario. 
The best example of a country which would see a very different future
under these scenarios in 2050 is Brazil. Under the BAU scenario largeagricultural areas would be released by deforestation, whereas in theBasic and Sub 1 scenarios this would be forbidden, and no agriculturalareas would be available for energy crops. By contrast a high potentialwould be available under Sub-scenario 2 as a consequence of reducedmeat consumption. Because of their high populations and relativelysmall agricultural areas, no surplus land is available for energy cropproduction in Central America, Asia and Africa. The EU, NorthAmerica and Australia, however , have relatively stable potentials. 
The results of this exercise show that the availability of biomass
resources is not only driven by the effect on global food supply but theconservation of natural forests and other biospheres. So the assessmentof future biomass potential is only the starting point of a discussionabout the integration of bioenergy into a renewable energy system.The total global biomass potential (energy crops and residues)
therefore ranges in 2020 from 66 EJ (Sub-scenario 1) up to 110EJ (Sub-scenario 2) and in 2050 from 94 EJ (Sub-scenario 1) to184 EJ (BAU scenario). These numbers are conservative andinclude a level of uncertainty, especially for 2050. The reasons forthis uncertainty are the potential effects of climate change, possiblechanges in the worldwide political and economic situation, a higheryield as a result of changed agricultural techniques and/or fasterdevelopment in plant breeding. 8energy resources & security of supply |BIOMASS

133This chapter describes the range of technologies available now and
in the future to satisfy the world’s energy demand. The Energy[R]evolution Scenario is focused on the potential for energy savingsand renewable sources, primarily in the electricity and heatgenerating sectors. Although fuel use in transport is accounted forin the scenarios of future energy supply, no detailed description isgiven here of fuel sources, such as bio fuels for vehicles, which offeran alternative to the currently predominant oil. 
fossil fuel technologies
The most commonly used fossil fuels for power generation aroundthe world are coal and gas. Oil is still used where other fuels arenot readily available, for example islands or remote sites, or wherethere is an indigenous resource. Together , coal and gas currentlyaccount for over half of global electricity supply. 
coal combustion technologies In a conventional coal-fired power
station, pulverised or powdered coal is blown into a combustionchamber where it is burnt at high temperature. The hot gases andheat produced converts water flowing through pipes lining the boilerinto steam. This drives a steam turbine and generates electricity.Over 90% of global coal-fired capacity uses this system. Coalpower stations can vary in capacity from a few hundred megawattsup to several thousand.
A number of technologies have been introduced to improve the
environmental performance of conventional coal combustion. Theseinclude coal cleaning (to reduce the ash content) and various ‘bolt-on’ or ‘end-of-pipe’ technologies to reduce emissions of particulates,sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, the main pollutants resultingfrom coal firing apart from carbon dioxide. Flue gasdesulphurisation (FGD), for example, most commonly involves‘scrubbing’ the flue gases using an alkaline sorbent slurry, which ispredominantly lime or limestone based.More fundamental changes have been made to the way coal is
burned to both improve its efficiency and further reduce emissionsof pollutants. These include:

Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle: Coal is not burnt
directly but reacted with oxygen and steam to form a syntheticgas composed mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This iscleaned and then burned in a gas turbine to generate electricityand produce steam to drive a steam turbine. IGCC improves theefficiency of coal combustion from 38-40% up to 50%. 

Supercritical and Ultrasupercritical: These power plants
operate at higher temperatures than conventional combustion,again increasing efficiency towards 50%.

Fluidised Bed Combustion: Coal is burned in a reactor
comprised of a bed through which gas is fed to keep the fuel in a turbulent state. This improves combustion, heat transfer and therecovery of waste products. By elevating pressures within a bed, a high-pressure gas stream can be used to drive a gas turbine,generating electricity. Emissions of both sulphur dioxide andnitrogen oxide can be reduced substantially.

Pressurised Pulverised Coal Combustion: Mainly being
developed in Germany, this is based on the combustion of a finelyground cloud of coal particles creating high pressure, hightemperature steam for power generation. The hot flue gases are usedto generate electricity in a similar way to the combined cycle system.
Other potential future technologies involve the increased use of coal
gasification. Underground Coal Gasification, for example, involvesconverting deep underground unworked coal into a combustible gaswhich can be used for industrial heating, power generation or themanufacture of hydrogen, synthetic natural gas or other chemicals.The gas can be processed to remove CO
2before it is passed on to
end users. Demonstration projects are underway in Australia,Europe, China and Japan. 
gas combustion technologies Natural gas can be used for
electricity generation through the use of either gas turbines orsteam turbines. For the equivalent amount of heat, gas producesabout 45% less carbon dioxide during its combustion than coal.
Gas turbine plants use the heat from gases to directly operate the
turbine. Natural gas fuelled turbines can start rapidly, and aretherefore often used to supply energy during periods of peakdemand, although at higher cost than baseload plants.
Particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining
gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode. In a
combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant, a gas turbine
generator produces electricity and the exhaust gases from theturbine are then used to make steam to generate additionalelectricity. The efficiency of modern CCGT power stations can bemore than 50%. Most new gas power plants built since the 1990shave been of this type.
At least until the recent increase in global gas prices, CCGT power
stations have been the cheapest option for electricity generation inmany countries. Capital costs have been substantially lower thanfor coal and nuclear plants and construction time shorter .9energy technologies |FOSSIL FUEL

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
carbon reduction technologies Whenever coal or gas is burned,
carbon dioxide (CO 2) is produced. Depending on the type of power
plant, a large quantity of the gas will dissipate into the atmosphereand contribute to climate change. A hard coal power plantdischarges roughly 720 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilowatthour , a modern gas-fired plant about 370g CO
2/kWh. To ensure that
no CO 2emerges from the power plant chimney, the gas must first be
removed, and then stored somewhere. Both carbon capture andstorage (CCS) have limitations. Even after employing proposedcapture technologies, a residual amount of carbon dioxide - between60 and 150g CO
2/kWh - will continue to be emitted. 
carbon dioxide storage CO 2captured at the point of incineration
has to be stored somewhere. Current thinking is that it can betrapped in the oceans or under the Earth’s surface at a depth ofover 3,000 feet. As with nuclear waste, however , the question iswhether this will just displace the problem elsewhere.
Ocean storage could result in greatly accelerated acidification of
large sea areas and would be detrimental to a great manyorganisms, if not entire ecosystems, in the vicinity of injection sites.CO
2disposed of in this way is likely to get back into the atmosphere
in a relatively short time. The oceans are both productive resourcesand a common natural endowment for this and future generations.Given the diversity of other options available for dealing with CO
2
emissions, direct disposal to the ocean, sea floor , lakes and otheropen reservoir structures must be ruled out. 
Among the options available for underground storage, empty oil and
gas fields are riddled with holes drilled during their exploration andproduction phases. These holes have to be sealed over . Normallyspecial cement is used, but carbon dioxide is relatively reactive withwater and attacks metals or cement, so that even sealed drillingholes present a safety hazard. To many experts the question is not ifbut when leakages will occur . 
Because of the lack of experience with CO
2storage, its safety is
often compared to the storage of natural gas. This technology hasbeen tried and tested for decades and is considered by industry to below risk. Greenpeace does not share this assessment. A number ofserious leaks from gas storage installations have occurred aroundthe world, sometimes requiring evacuation of nearby residents. 
Sudden leakage of CO
2can be fatal. Carbon dioxide is not itself
poisonous, and is contained (approx. 0.04 per cent) in the air webreathe. But as concentrations increase it displaces the vital oxygenin the air . Air with concentrations of 7 to 8% CO
2by volume causes
death by suffocation after 30 to 60 minutes. 
There are also health hazards when large amounts of CO 2are
explosively released. Although the gas normally disperses quicklyafter leaking, it can accumulate in depressions in the landscape orclosed buildings, since carbon dioxide is heavier than air . It isequally dangerous when it escapes more slowly and without beingnoticed in residential areas, for example in cellars below houses. 
The dangers from such leaks are known from natural volcanic CO
2
degassing. Gas escaping at the Lake Nyos crater lake in Cameroon,
Africa in 1986 killed over 1,700 people. At least ten people havedied in the Lazio region of Italy in the last 20 years as a result ofCO
2being released.carbon storage and climate change targets Can carbon storage
contribute to climate change reduction targets? In order to avoiddangerous climate change, we need to reduce CO
2globally by 50%
in 2050. Power plants that store CO 2are still being developed,
however , and could only become reality in 15 years at the earliest.This means they will not make any substantial contribution towardsprotecting the climate until the year 2020 at the earliest. They arethus irrelevant to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol.
Nor is CO
2storage of any great help in attaining the goal of an
80% reduction by 2050 in OECD countries. If it does becomeavailable in 2020, most of the world’s new power plants will havejust finished being modernised. All that could then be done would befor existing power plants to be retrofitted and CO
2captured from
the waste gas flow. As retrofitting existing power plants is highlyexpensive, a high carbon price would be needed. 
Employing CO
2capture will also increase the price of electricity from
fossil fuels. Although the costs of storage depend on many factors,including the technology used for separation, transport and thestorage installation, experts from the UN Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change calculate the additional costs at between 3.5 and 5.0€cents/kWh of power . Since modern wind turbines in good wind
locations are already cost competitive with new build coal-firedpower plants today, the costs will probably be at the top end. Thismeans the technology would more than double the cost of electricity. 
The conclusion reached in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is that
renewable energy sources are already available, in many casescheaper , and without the negative environmental impacts that areassociated with fossil fuel exploitation, transport and processing. Itis renewable energy together with energy efficiency and energyconservation – and not carbon capture and storage – that has toincrease worldwide so that the primary cause of climate change –the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas – is stopped.
Greenpeace opposes any CCS efforts which lead to:
The undermining or threats to undermine existing gl obal and
regional regulations governing the disposal of wastes at sea (inthe water column, at or beneath the seabed).
Continued or increasing finance to the fossil fuel sector at the
expense of renewable energy and energy efficiency.
The stagnation of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy
conservation improvements.
The promotion of this possible future technology as the only
major solution to climate change, thereby leading to new fossilfuel developments – especially lignite and black coal-fired powerplants, and an increase in emissions in the short to medium term.9energy technologies |FOSSIL FUEL


135nuclear technologies
Generating electricity from nuclear power involves transf erring the
heat produced by a controlled nuclear fission reaction into aconventional steam turbine generator . The nuclear reaction takesplace inside a core and surrounded by a containment vessel ofvarying design and structure. Heat is removed from the core by acoolant (gas or water) and the reaction controlled by a moderatingelement or “moderator”.
Across the world over the last two decades there has been a general
slowdown in building new nuclear power stations. This has beencaused by a variety of factors: fear of a nuclear accident, followingthe events at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Monju, increasedscrutiny of economics and environmental factors, such as wastemanagement and radioactive discharges. 
nuclear reactor designs: evolution and safety issues At the
beginning of 2005 there were 441 nuclear power reactors operatingin 31 countries around the world. Although there are dozens ofdifferent reactor designs and sizes, there are three broad categorieseither currently deployed or under development. These are:
Generation I: Prototype commercial reactors developed in the
1950s and 1960s as modified or enlarged military reactors,originally either for submarine propulsion or plutonium production. 
Generation II: Mainstream reactor designs in commercial
operation worldwide.
Generation III: New generation reactors now being built. 
Generation III reactors include the so-called Advanced Reactors,
three of which are already in operation in Japan, with more underconstruction or planned. About 20 different designs are reported tobe under development
40, most of them ‘evolutionary’ designs
developed from Generation II reactor types with somemodifications, but without introducing drastic changes. Some ofthem represent more innovative approaches. According to the WorldNuclear Association, reactors of Generation III are characterisedby the following:
A standardised design for each type to expedite licensing, reduce
capital cost and construction time.
A simpler and more rugged design, making them easier to
operate and less vulnerable to operational upsets.
Higher availability and longer operating life, typically 60 years.
Reduced possibility of core melt accidents.
Minimal effect on the environment.
Higher burn-up to reduce fuel use and the amount of waste.
Burnable absorbers (‘poisons’) to extend fuel life.To what extent these goals address issues of higher safety
standards, as opposed to improved economics, remains unclear .
Of the new reactor types, the European Pressurised Water Reactor
(EPR) has been developed from the most recent Generation IIdesigns to start operation in France and Germany
41. Its stated goals
are to improve safety levels - in particular , reduce the probability ofa severe accident by a factor of ten, achieve mitigation of severeaccidents by restricting their consequences to the plant itself, andreduce costs. Compared to its predecessors, however , the EPRdisplays several modifications which constitute a reduction ofsafety margins, including: 
The volume of the reactor building has been reduced by
simplifying the layout of the emergency core cooling system, and by using the results of new calculations which predict lesshydrogen development during an accident. 
The thermal output of the plant has been increased by 15%
relative to existing French reactors by increasing core outlettemperature, letting the main coolant pumps run at highercapacity and modifying the steam generators. 
The EPR has fewer redundant pathways in its safety systems
than a German Generation II reactor .
Several other modifications are hailed as substantial safety
improvements, including a ‘core catcher’ system to control ameltdown accident. Nonetheless, in spite of the changes beingenvisaged, there is no guarantee that the safety level of the EPRactually represents a significant improvement. In particular ,reduction of the expected core melt probability by a factor of ten isnot proven. Furthermore, there are serious doubts as to whether themitigation and control of a core melt accident with the core catcherconcept will actually work.
Finally, 
Generation IV reactors are currently being developed with
the aim of commercialisation in 20-30 years.9energy technologies |NUCLEAR

136GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
renewable energy technologies 
Renewable energy covers a range of natural sources which are
constantly renewed and therefore, unlike fossil fuels and uranium,will never be exhausted. Most of them d erive from the effect of the
sun and moon on the Earth’s weather patterns. They also producenone of the harmful emissions and pollution associated with‘conventional’ fuels. Although hydroelectric power has been used onan industrial scale since the middle of the last century, the seriousexploitation of other renewable sources has a more recent history. 
solar power (photovoltaics pv) There is more than enough solar
radiation available all over the world to satisfy a vastly increaseddemand for solar power systems. The sunlight which reaches theEarth’s surface is enough to provide 2,850 times as much energy aswe can currently use. On a global average, each square metre of landis exposed to enough sunlight to produce 1,700 kWh of power everyyear . The average irradiation in Europe is about 1,000 kWh per squaremetre, however , compared with 1,800 kWh in the Middle East.
Photovoltaic (PV) technology involves the generation of electricity
from light. The secret to this process is the use of a semiconductormaterial which can be adapted to release electrons, the negativelycharged particles that form the basis of electricity. The mostcommon semiconductor material used in photovoltaic cells is silicon,an element most commonly found in sand. All PV cells have at leasttwo layers of such semiconductors, one positively charged and onenegatively charged. When light shines on the semiconductor , theelectric field across the junction between these two layers causeselectricity to flow. The greater the intensity of the light, the greaterthe flow of electricity. A photovoltaic system does not therefore needbright sunlight in order to operate, and can generate electricity evenon cloudy days. Solar PV is different from a solar thermal collectingsystem (see below) where the sun’s rays are used to generate heat,usually for hot water in a house, swimming pool etc.
The most important parts of a PV system are the cells which form
the basic building blocks, the modules which bring together largenumbers of cells into a unit, and, in some situations, the invertersused to convert the electricity generated into a form suitable foreveryday use. When a PV installation is described as having acapacity of 3 kWp (peak), this refers to the output of the systemunder standard testing conditions, allowing comparison betweendifferent modules. In central Europe a 3 kWp rated solar electricitysystem, with a surface area of approximately 27 square metres,would produce enough power to meet the electricity demand of anenergy conscious household.types of PV system
grid connected The most popular type of solar PV system for
homes and businesses in the developed world. Connection to thelocal electricity network allows any excess power produced to besold to the utility. Electricity is then imported from the networkoutside daylight hours. An inverter is used to convert the DCpower produced by the system to AC power for running normalelectrical equipment.

grid support A system can be connected to the local electricity
network as well as a back-up battery. Any excess solar electricityproduced after the battery has been charged is then sold to the network. This system is ideal for use in areas of unreliablepower supply.

off-grid Completely independent of the grid, the system is
connected to a battery via a charge controller , which stores theelectricity generated and acts as the main power supply. Aninverter can be used to provide AC power , enabling the use ofnormal appliances. Typical off-grid applications are repeaterstations for mobile phones or rural electrification. Ruralelectrification means either small solar home systems coveringbasic electricity needs or solar mini grids, which are larger solarelectricity systems providing electricity for several households.

hybrid system A solar system can be combined with another
source of power - a biomass generator , a wind turbine or dieselgenerator - to ensure a consistent supply of electricity. A hybridsystem can be grid connected, stand alone or grid support. 9energy technologies |RENEWABLE ENERGY

137concentrating solar power (CSP) Concentrating solar power
(CSP) plants, also called solar thermal power plants, produceelectricity in much the same way as conventional power stations. Thedifference is that they obtain their energy input by concentratingsolar radiation and converting it to high temperature steam or gasto drive a turbine or motor engine. Large mirrors concentratesunlight into a single line or point. The heat created there is used togenerate steam. This hot, highly pressurised steam is used to powerturbines which generate electricity. In sun-drenched regions, CSPplants can guarantee a large proportion of electricity production.
Four main elements are required: a concentrator , a receiver , some
form of transfer medium or storage, and power conversion. Manydifferent types of system are possible, including combinations withother renewable and non-renewable technologies, but the threemost promising solar thermal technologies are:

parabolic trough Trough-shaped mirror reflectors are used to
concentrate sunlight on to thermally efficient receiver tubesplaced in the trough’s focal line. A thermal transfer fluid, such assynthetic thermal oil, is circulated in these tubes. Heated toapproximately 400°C by the concentrated sun’s rays, this oil isthen pumped through a series of heat exchangers to producesuperheated steam. The steam is converted to electrical energy ina conventional steam turbine generator , which can either be partof a conventional steam cycle or integrated into a combinedsteam and gas turbine cycle.
This is the most mature technology, with 354 MWe of plants
connected to the Southern California grid since the 1980s andmore than 2 million square metres of parabolic trough collectorsinstalled worldwide.
central receiver or solar tower A circular array of heliostats
(large individually tracking mirrors) is used to concentrate sunlighton to a central receiver mounted at the top of a tower . A heat-transfer medium absorbs the highly concentrated radiation reflectedby the heliostats and converts it into thermal energy to be used forthe subsequent generation of superheated steam for turbineoperation. To date, the heat transfer media demonstrated includewater/steam, molten salts, liquid sodium and air . If pressurised gasor air is used at very high temperatures of about 1,000°C or moreas the heat transfer medium, it can even be used to directly replacenatural gas in a gas turbine, thus making use of the excellentefficiency (60%+) of modern gas and steam combined cycles.
After an intermediate scaling up to 30 MW capacity, solar tower
developers now feel confident that grid-connected tower powerplants can be built up to a capacity of 200 MWe solar-only units.Use of heat storage will increase their flexibility. Although solartower plants are considered to be further from commercialisationthan parabolic trough systems, they have good longer-termprospects for high conversion efficiencies. Projects are beingdeveloped in Spain, South Africa and Australia.

parabolic dish A dish-shaped reflector is used to concentrate
sunlight on to a receiver located at its focal point. Theconcentrated beam radiation is absorbed into the receiver to heata fluid or gas to approximately 750°C. This is then used togenerate electricity in a small piston, Stirling engine or a microturbine, attached to the receiver .
The potential of parabolic dishes lies primarily for decentralised
power supply and remote, stand-alone power systems. Projectsare currently planned in the United States, Australia and Europe.9energy technologies |RENEWABLE ENERGY

solar thermal collectors Solar thermal collecting systems are based
on a centuries-old principle: the sun heats up water contained in a darkvessel. Solar thermal technologies on the market now are efficient andhighly reliable, providing energy for a wide range of applications - fromdomestic hot water and space heating in residential and commercialbuildings to swimming pool heating, solar-assisted cooling, industrialprocess heat and the desalination of drinking water .
solar domestic hot water and space heating Domestic hot water
production is the most common application. Depending on theconditions and the system’s configuration, most of a building’s hotwater requirements can be provided by solar energy. Larger systemscan additionally cover a substantial part of the energy needed forspace heating. There are two main types of technology:

vacuum tubes The absorber inside the vacuum tube absorbs
radiation from the sun and heats up the fluid inside. Additionalradiation is picked up from the reflector behind the tubes.Whatever the angle of the sun, the round shape of the vacuumtube allows it to reach the absorber . Even on a cloudy day, whenthe light is coming from many angles at once, the vacuum tubecollector can still be effective.

the roof like a skylight. Inside is a series of copper tubes withcopper fins attached. The entire structure is coated in a blacksubstance designed to capture the sun’s rays. These rays heat up awater and antifreeze mixture which circulates from the collectordown to the building’s boiler .
solar assisted cooling Solar chillers use thermal energy to produce
cooling and/or dehumidify the air in a similar way to a refrigeratoror conventional air-conditioning. This application is well-suited tosolar thermal energy, as the demand for cooling is often greatestwhen there is most sunshine. Solar cooling has been successfullydemonstrated and large-scale use can be expected in the future.wind power Over the last 20 years, wind energy has become the
world’s fastest growing energy source. Today’s wind turbines areproduced by a sophisticated mass production industry employing atechnology that is efficient, cost effective and quick to install.Turbine sizes range from a few kW to over 5,000 kW, with thelargest turbines reaching more than 100m in height. One large windturbine can produce enough electricity for about 5,000 households.State-of-the-art wind farms today can be as small as a few turbinesand as large as several hundred MW.
The global wind resource is enormous, capable of generating more
electricity than the world’s total power demand, and welldistributed across the five continents. Wind turbines can beoperated not just in the windiest coastal areas but in countrieswhich have no coastlines, including regions such as central EasternEurope, central North and South America, and central Asia. Thewind resource out at sea is even more productive than on land,encouraging the installation of offshore wind parks withfoundations embedded in the ocean floor . In Denmark, a wind parkbuilt in 2002 uses 80 turbines to produce enough electricity for acity with a population of 150,000.
Smaller wind turbines can produce power efficiently in areas that
otherwise have no access to electricity. This power can be useddirectly or stored in batteries. New technologies for using the wind’spower are also being developed for exposed buildings in denselypopulated cities.
wind turbine design Significant consolidation of wind turbine
design has taken place since the 1980s. The majority of comm ercial
turbines now operate on a horizontal axis with three evenly spacedblades. These are attached to a rotor from which power istransferred through a gearbox to a generator . The gearbox andgenerator are contained within a housing called a nacelle. Someturbine designs avoid a gearbox by using direct drive. The electricityoutput is then channelled down the tower to a transformer andeventually into the local grid network. 
Wind turbines can operate from a wind speed of 3-4 metres per
second up to about 25 m/s. Limiting their power at high windspeeds is achieved either by ‘stall’ regulation – reducing the poweroutput – or ‘pitch’ control – changing the angle of the blades sothat they no longer offer any resistance to the wind. Pitch controlhas become the most common method. The blades can also turn ata constant or variable speed, with the latter enabling the turbine tofollow more closely the changing wind speed. 9energy technologies |RENEWABLE ENERGY

139The main design drivers for current wind technology are:
high productivity at both low and high wind sites
grid compatibility
acoustic performance
aerodynamic performance
visual impact
offshore expansion
Although the existing offshore market is only just over 1% of the
world’s land-based installed wind capacity, the latest developmentsin wind technology are primarily driven by this emerging potential.This means that the focus is on the most effective ways to makevery large turbines.
Modern wind technology is available for a range of sites - low and high
wind speeds, desert and arctic climates. European wind farms operatewith high availability, are generally well integrated with the environmentand accepted by the public. In spite of repeated predictions of a levellingoff at an optimum mid-range size, and the fact that wind turbinescannot get larger indefinitely, turbine size has increased year on year -from units of 20-60 kW in California in the 1980s up to the latestmulti-MW machines with rotor diameters over 100 m. The average sizeof turbine installed around the world during 2007 was 1,492 kW, whilstthe largest machine in operation is the Enercon E126, with a rotordiameter of 126 metres and a power capacity of 6 MW.
This growth in turbine size has been matched by the expansion of
both markets and manufacturers. Almost 100,000 wind turbinesnow operate in over 50 countries around the world. The Germanmarket is the largest, but there has also been impressive growth inSpain, Denmark, India, China and the United States. biomass energy Biomass is a broad term used to describe material
of recent biological origin that can be used as a source of energy.This includes wood, crops, algae and other plants as well asagricultural and forest residues. Biomass can be used for a varietyof end uses: heating, electricity generation or as fuel fortransportation. The term ‘bio energy’ is used for biomass energysystems that produce heat and/or electricity and ‘bio fuels’ forliquid fuels used in transport. Biodiesel manufactured from variouscrops has become increasingly used as vehicle fuel, especially as thecost of oil has risen.
Biological power sources are renewable, easily stored, and, if
sustainably harvested, CO
2neutral. This is because the gas emitted
during their transfer into useful energy is balanced by the carbondioxide absorbed when they were growing plants.
Electricity generating biomass power plants work just like natural
gas or coal power stations, except that the fuel must be processedbefore it can be burned. These power plants are generally not aslarge as coal power stations because their fuel supply needs to growas near as possible to the plant. Heat generation from biomasspower plants can result either from utilising a Combined Heat andPower (CHP) system, piping the heat to nearby homes or industry,or through dedicated heating systems. Small heating systems usingspecially produced pellets made from waste wood, for example, canbe used to heat single family homes instead of natural gas or oil. 9energy technologies |RENEWABLE ENERGY

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
biomass technology A number of processes can be used to convert
energy from biomass. These divide into thermal sys tems, which
involve direct combustion of solids, liquids or a gas via pyrolysis orgasification, and biological systems, which involve decomposition ofsolid biomass to liquid or gaseous fuels by processes such asanaerobic digestion and fermentation.

thermal systems 
Direct combustion is the most common way of converting
biomass to energy, for heat as well as electricity. Worldwide itaccounts for over 90% of biomass generation. Technologies canbe distinguished as either fixed bed, fluidised bed or entrainedflow combustion. In fixed bed combustion, such as a gratefurnace, primary air passes through a fixed bed, in which drying,gasification and charcoal combustion takes place. Thecombustible gases produced are burned after the addition ofsecondary air , usually in a zone separated from the fuel bed. Influidised bed combustion, the primary combustion air is injectedfrom the bottom of the furnace with such high velocity that thematerial inside the furnace becomes a seething mass of particlesand bubbles. Entrained flow combustion is suitable for fuelsavailable as small particles, such as sawdust or fine shavings,which are pneumatically injected into the furnace.
Gasification Biomass fuels are increasingly being used with
advanced conversion technologies, such as gasification systems,which offer superior efficiencies compared with conventionalpower generation. Gasification is a thermochemical process inwhich biomass is heated with little or no oxygen present toproduce a low energy gas. The gas can then be used to fuel a gasturbine or combustion engine to generate electricity. Gasificationcan also decrease emission levels compared to power productionwith direct combustion and a steam cycle.
Pyrolysis is a process whereby biomass is exposed to high
temperatures in the absence of air , causing the biomass todecompose. The products of pyrolysis always include gas(‘biogas’), liquid (‘bio-oil’) and solid (‘char’), with the relativeproportions of each depending on the fuel characteristics, themethod of pyrolysis and the reaction parameters, such astemperature and pressure. Lower temperatures produce moresolid and liquid products and higher temperatures more biogas.

biological systems 
These processes are suitable for very wet biomass materials such
as food or agricultural wastes, including farm animal slurry. 
Anaerobic digestion means the breakdown of organic waste by
bacteria in an oxygen-free environment. This produces a biogastypically made up of 65% methane and 35% carbon dioxide. Purifiedbiogas can then be used both for heating and electricity generation. 
Fermentation Fermentation is the process by which growing plants
with a high sugar and starch content are broken down with thehelp of micro-organisms to produce ethanol and methanol. The endproduct is a combustible fuel that can be used in vehicles.Biomass power station capacities typically range up to 15 MW,
but larger plants are possible of up to 400 MW capacity, withpart of the fuel input potentially being fossil fuel, for examplepulverised coal. The world’s largest biomass fuelled power plant islocated at Pietarsaari in Finland. Built in 2001, this is anindustrial CHP plant producing steam (100 MWth) andelectricity (240 MWe) for the local forest industry and districtheat for the nearby town. The boiler is a circulating fluidised bedboiler designed to generate steam from bark, sawdust, woodresidues, commercial bio fuel and peat. 
A 2005 study commissioned by Greenpeace Netherlands
concluded that it was technically possible to build and operate a1,000 MWe biomass fired power plant using fluidised bedcombustion technology and fed with wood residue pellets
42. 
bio fuels Converting crops into ethanol and bio diesel made from
rapeseed methyl ester (RME) currently takes place mainly in Brazil,the USA and Europe. Processes for obtaining synthetic fuels from‘biogenic synthesis’ gases will also play a larger role in the future.Theoretically bio fuels can be produced from any biological carbonsource, although the most common are photosynthetic plants. Variousplants and plant-derived materials are used for bio fuel production. Globally bio fuels are most commonly used to power vehicles, but canalso be used for other purposes. The production and use of bio fuelsmust result in a net reduction in carbon emissions compared to the useof traditional fossil fuels to have a positive effect in climate changemitigation. Sustainable bio fuels can reduce the dependency onpetroleum and thereby enhance energy security.
Bio ethanol is a fuel manufactured through the fermentation of
sugars. This is done by accessing sugars directly (sugar cane or beet)or by breaking down starch in grains such as wheat, rye, barley ormaize. In the European Union bio ethanol is mainly produced fromgrains, with wheat as the dominant feedstock. In Brazil the preferredfeedstock is sugar cane, whereas in the USA it is corn (maize). Bioethanol produced from cereals has a by-product, a protein-rich animalfeed called Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS). For everytonne of cereals used for ethanol production, on average one third willenter the animal feed stream as DDGS. Because of its high proteinlevel this is currently used as a replacement for soy cake. Bio ethanolcan either be blended into gasoline (petrol) directly or be used in theform of ETBE (Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether).
Bio diesel is a fuel produced from vegetable oil sourced from rapeseed,
sunflower seeds or soybeans as well as used cooking oils or animal fats.Bio diesel comes in a standard form as ‘mono-alkyl ester’ and otherkinds of diesel-grade fuels of biological origin are not included. Inspecific cases, used vegetable oils can be recycled as feedstock for biodiesel production. This can reduce the loss of used oils in theenvironment and provides a new way of transfo rming a waste into
transport energy. Blends of bio diesel and conventional hydrocarbon-based diesel are the most common products distributed in the retailtransport fuel market. 
Most countries use a labelling system to explain the proportion of bio
diesel in any fuel mix. Fuel containing 20% biodiesel is labelled B20,while pure bio diesel is referred to as B100. Blends of 20 % bio dieselwith 80 % petroleum diesel (B20) can generally be used in unmodifieddiesel engines. Used in its pure form (B100) an engine may requirecertain modifications. Bio diesel can also be used as a heating fuel indomestic and comm ercial boilers. Older furna ces may contain rubber
parts that would be affected by bio diesel’s solvent properties, but canotherwise burn it without any conversion.9energy technologies |RENEWABLE ENERGY

141geothermal energy Geothermal energy is heat derived from deep
underneath the Earth’s crust. In most areas, this heat reaches thesurface in a very diffuse state. However , due to a variety ofgeological processes, some areas, including the western part of theUSA, west and central eastern Europe, Iceland, Asia and NewZealand are underlain by relatively shallow geothermal resources.These are classified as either low temperature (less than 90°C),moderate temperature (90° - 150°C) or high temperature (greaterthan 150°C). The uses to which these resources can be put dependon the temperature. The highest temperature is generally used onlyfor electric power generation. Current global geothermal generationcapacity totals approximately 8,000 MW. Uses for low andmoderate temperature resources can be d ivided into two categories:
direct use and ground-source heat pumps.
Geothermal power plants use the Earth’s natural heat to vapourise
water or an organic medium. The steam created then powers aturbine which produces electricity. In New Zealand and Iceland thistechnique has been used extensively for decades. In Germany, whereit is necessary to drill many kilometres down to reach the necessarytemperatures, it is only in the trial stages. Geothermal heat plantsrequire lower temperatures and the heated water is used directly.hydro power Water has been used to produce electricity for about
a century. Today, around one fifth of the world’s electricity isproduced from hydro power . Large hydroelectric power plants withconcrete dams and extensive collecting lakes often have verynegative effects on the environment, however , requiring the floodingof habitable areas. Smaller ‘run-of-the-river’ power stations, whichare turbines powered by one section of running water in a river , canproduce electricity in an environmentally friendly way. 
The main requirement for hydro power is to create an artificial
head so that water , diverted through an intake channel or pipe intoa turbine, discharges back into the river downstream. Small hydropower is mainly ‘run-of-the-river’ and does not collect significantamounts of stored water , requiring the construction of large damsand reservoirs. There are two broad categories of turbines: impulseturbines (notably the Pelton) in which a jet of water impinges onthe runner designed to reverse the direction of the jet and therebyextracts momentum from the water . This turbine is suitable for highheads and ‘small’ discharges. Reaction turbines (notably Francisand Kaplan) run full of water and in effect generate hydrodynamic‘lift’ forces to propel the runner blades. These turbines are suitablefor medium to low heads, and medium to large discharges.

tidal power Tidal power can be harnessed by constructing a dam
or barrage across an estuary or bay with a tidal range of at leastfive metres. Gates in the barrage allow the incoming tide to build upin a basin behind it. The gates then close so that when the tide flowsout the water can be channelled through turbines to generateelectricity. Tidal barrages have been built across estuaries inFrance, Canada and China but a mixture of high cost projectionscoupled with environmental objections to the effect on estuarialhabitats has limited the technology’s further expansion. wave and tidal stream power In wave power generation, a
structure interacts with the incoming waves, converting this energyto electricity through a hydraulic, mechanical or pneumatic powertake-off system. The structure is kept in position by a mooringsystem or placed directly on the seabed/seashore. Power istransmitted to the seabed by a flexible submerged electrical cableand to shore by a sub-sea cable. 
Wave power converters can be made up from connected groups of
smaller generator units of 100 – 500 kW, or several mechanical orhydraulically interconnected modules can supply a single largerturbine generator unit of 2 – 20 MW. The large waves needed tomake the technology more cost effective are mostly found at greatdistances from the shore, however , requiring costly sub-sea cables totransmit the power . The converters themselves also take up largeamounts of space. Wave power has the advantage of providing amore predictable supply than wind energy and can be located in theocean without much visual intrusion.
There is no commercially leading technology on wave power
conversion at present. Different systems are being developed at seafor prototype testing. The largest grid-connected system installed sofar is the 2.25 MW Pelamis, with linked semi-submergedcyclindrical sections, operating off the coast of Portugal. Mostdevelopment work has been carried out in the UK.

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
Using energy efficiently is cheaper than producing fresh energy and
often has multiple positive effects. An efficient clothes washingmachine or dishwasher , for example uses less power and less water .Efficiency also usually provides a higher level of comfort. A well-insulated house, for instance, will feel warmer in the winter , coolerin the summer and be healthier to live in. An efficient refrigeratorwill make less noise, have no frost inside, no condensation outsideand will probably last longer . Efficient lighting will offer you morelight where you need it. Efficiency is thus really ‘more with less’. 
There are very simple steps a householder can take, such as putting
additional insulation in the roof, using super-insulating glazing orbuying a high-efficiency washing machine when the old one wearsout. All of these examples will save both money and energy. But thebiggest savings will not be found in such incremental steps. The realgains come from rethinking the whole concept - ‘the whole house’,‘the whole car’ or even ‘the whole transport system’. When you dothis, energy needs can often be cut back by four to ten times. 
In order to find out the global and regional energy efficiency
potential, the Dutch institute Ecofys developed energy demandscenarios for this update of the Greenpeace Energy [R]evolutionanalysis. These scenarios cover energy demand over the period2005-2050 for ten world regions. Two low energy demand scenariosfor energy efficiency improvements have been defined. The first isbased on the best technical energy efficiency potentials and iscalled ‘Technical’. The second is based on more moderate energysavings taking into account implementation constraints in terms ofcosts and other barriers. This scenario is called ‘Revolution’. Themain results of the study are summarised below.
The starting point for the Ecofys analysis is that worldwide final
energy demand is expected to grow by 95%, from 290 EJ in 2005to 570 EJ in 2050, if we continue with business as usual. In thelight of increasing fossil fuel prices, depleting resources and climatechange, business as usual is simply not an option.Growth in the transport sector is projected to be the largest, with
energy demand expected to grow from 84 EJ in 2005 to 183 EJ in2050. Demand for buildings and agriculture is expected to grow theleast, from 91 EJ in 2005 to 124 EJ in 2050.
Under the energy [r]evolution scenario, however,
growth in energy demand can be limited to anincrease of 28% up to 2050 in comparison to the 2005level, whilst taking into account implementationconstraints in terms of costs and other barriers.In Figure 10.2 the potential for energy efficiency improvements underthis scenario are presented. The baseline is 2005 final energy demandper region. Table 10.1 shows that total worldwide energy demand hasreduced to 376 PJ by 2050, with a breakdown by sector .

the low energy household
Technologies to reduce energy demand applied in this typical
household are45: 
Triple-glazed windows with low emittance coatings. These
windows greatly reduce heat loss to 40% compared to windowswith one layer . The low emittance coating prevents energy wavesin sunlight coming through, reducing the need for cooling.
Insulation of roofs, walls, floors and basement. Proper insulation
reduces heating and cooling demand by 50% in comparison totypical energy demand.
Passive solar techniques make use of solar energy through the
building’s design - siting and window orientation. The term‘passive’ indicates that no mechanical equipment is used. Allsolar gains come through the windows.
Balanced ventilation with heat recovery means that heated indoor
air is channelled to a heat recovery unit and used to heatincoming outdoor air .
Current space heating demands in kJ per square metre per heating
degree day for OECD dwellings are given in the table below.
148GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

Since an estimated 80% of fuel use in buildings is for space
heating, the energy efficiency improvement potential here isconsidered to be large. In order to determine the potential forefficiency improvement in space heating we looked at the energydemand per m
2floor area per heating degree day (HDD). Heating
degree days indicate the number of degrees that a day’s averagetemperature is under 18°C, the temperature below which buildingsneed to be heated.
The typical current heating demand for dwellings is 70-120 kJ/m
2 44.
Dwellings with a low energy use consume below 32 kJ/m2/, however ,
more than 70% less than the current level. 10energy efficient households |LOW ENERGY HOUSEHOLD

149space heating savings for new buildings We have assumed under
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that from 2010 onwards, all newdwellings will be low energy buildings using 48 kJ/m
2/HDD. Since
there is no data on current average energy consumption fordwellings in non-OECD countries, we have had to make assumptionsfor these regions. The potential for fuel savings
46is considered to be
small in developing regions and about the same as the OECD in theTransition Economies. From this study we have taken the potentialfor developing regions to be equal to a 1.4% energy efficiencyimprovement per year , including replacing existing homes with moreenergy efficient housing (retrofitting). For the Transition Economieswe have assumed the average OECD savings potential. For newhomes, the savings compared to the average current dwelling aregiven in Table 10.4.

The number of existing dwellings alsodecreases each year due to a certain level of replacement.

This example illustrates that new dwellings in The Netherlands (and
therefore OECD Europe) make up 7% of the total housing stock in2050 and retrofits account for 41%. Although the UNECE databasedoes not have data for countries in all regions of the world, thepercentages of new and retrofit houses in 2050 are not dependent onthe absolute number of dwellings but only on the rate of populationgrowth and the 1.3% assumption. This means that we can use thepopulation growth to make forecasts for other regions (see Table 10.6). Total savings for space heating energy demand are calculated by
multiplying the savings potentials for new and existing houses bythe forecast share of dwellings in 2050 to get a weighed percentagereduction. For fuel use for hot water we have assumed the sameannual percentage reduction as for space heating. For cooking wehave assumed a 1.5% per year efficiency improvement. 
electricity savings by application 
In order to determine savings for electric ity demand in buildings, 
we examined the energy use and potential savings for the followingdifferent elements of power consumption: 
Standby 
Lighting 
Set-top boxes 
Freezers/fridges 
Computers/servers 
Air conditioning 
1. standby power consumption Standby power consumption is the
"lowest power consumption which cannot be switched off(influenced) by the user and may persist for an indefinite time whenan appliance is connected to the mains electricity supply"
49. In other
words, the energy available when an appliance is connected to thepower supply is not being used. Some appliances also consumeenergy when they are not on standby and are also not being used fortheir primary function, for example when an appliance has reachedthe end of a cycle but the ‘on’ button is still engaged. Thisconsumption does not fit into the definition of standby power butcould still account for a substantial amount of energy use.
Reducing standby losses provides a major opportunity for cost-
effective energy savings. Nowadays, many appliances can beremotely and/or instantly activated or have a continuous digitaldisplay, and therefore require a standby mode. Standby poweraccounts for 20–90W per home in developed nations, ranging from4 to 10% of total residential electricity use
50and 3-12% of total
residential electricity use worldwide51. Printers use 30-40% of their
full power requirement when idle, as do televisions and musicequipment. Set-top boxes used in conjunction with televisions tend toconsume even more energy on standby than in use. Typical standbyuse of different types of electrical devices is shown in Figure 10.8. 10energy efficient households |LOW ENERGY HOUSEHOLD

151In developing nations, the amount of appliances per household is
growing (see Figure 10.9 for China). In China, standby energy useaccounts for 50–200 kWh per year in an average urban home. 
Overall, residential standby power consumption in
China requires the electrical output equivalent to atleast six 500 MW power plants. 
Levels of standby power use in Chinese homes (on average 29W) 
are below those in developed countries but still high because Chineseappliances have a higher level of standby operation. Existingtechnologies are available to greatly reduce standby power at a low cost.By 2050, standby use is expected to be responsible for 8% of total
electricity demand across all regions of the world. The WorldBusiness Council for Sustainable Development has assessed that aworldwide savings potential of between 72% and 82% is feasible.This is confirmed by research in The Netherlands
52which showed
that reducing the amount of power available for standby in alldevices to just 1W would lead to a saving of approximately 77%.We have adopted these reduction percentages for the Technicalscenario (82% reduction) and the [R]evolution Scenario (72%reduction). This means an energy efficiency improvement of 4.2%per year in the Technical scenario and 3.1% per year in the[R]evolution Scenario.10energy efficient households |LOW ENERGY HOUSEHOLD

2. lighting Incandescent bulbs have been the most common lamps for
a more than 100 years. These are the most inefficient type of lighting,however , since up to 95% of the electricity is converted into heat
53.
Incandescent lamps have a relatively short life-span (average ofapproximately 1,000 hours) but have a low initial cost and optimalcolour rendering. CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamps) are moreexpensive than incandescent bulbs but they use about 75% lessenergy, produce 75% less heat and last about ten times longer
54. CFLs
are available in different sizes and shapes, for indoors and outdoors. 
The usage pattern for different lighting technologies in different
countries is shown in Figure 10.10 (LFL = Linear Fluorescent Lamp).
Globally, people consume 3 Mega-lumen-hrs (Mlmh) of residential
electric light per capita/year . The average North American uses 13.2Mlmh, the average Chinese 1.5 Mlmh - still 300 times the averageartificial per capita light use in England in the nineteenth century.The average Japanese uses 18.5 Mlmh and the average European orAustralian 2.7Mlmh. There is a clear relationship between GDP percapita and lighting consumption in Mlmh/cap/yr (see Figure 10.11). It is important to realise that lighting energy savings are not just a
question of using more efficient lamps but also involve otherapproaches. These include making smarter use of daylight, reducinglight absorption by luminaires (the fixture in which the lamp ishoused), optimising lighting levels (levels in OECD countriescommonly exceed recommended values), using automatic controls(turn off when no one is present, dim artificial light in response torising daylight) and retrofitting buildings to make better use ofdaylight. Buildings designed to optimise daylight can receive up to70% of their annual illumination needs from daylight, while a typicalbuilding will only get 20 to 25%
55. In a study by Bertoldi & Atanasiu
(2006), national lighting consumption and CFL penetration data ispresented for the EU-27 countries (and candidate country Croatia).We used this data as the basis for household penetration rates andlighting electricity consumption in OECD Europe. As well as standby,lighting is an important source of cost-effective savings. The IEApublication “Light’s Labour’s Lost” (2006) projects that the cost-effective savings potential from energy efficient lighting in 2030 is atleast 38% of lighting electricity consumption, even disregardingnewer and promising solid state lighting technologies such as lightemitting diodes (LEDs). In order to determine the savings potentialfor lighting, it is important to know the percentage of householdswith energy efficient lamps and the penetration level of these lamps.Based on Bertoldi & Atanasiu (2006) and Waide (2006) wecalculated the shares shown in Table 10.7. 10energy efficient households |LOW ENERGY HOUSEHOLD

153Based on the studies already cited we calculate that a maximum 
of 80% savings can result from the introduction of efficientresidential lighting in the Technical scenario and 70% in the[R]evolution Scenario. These savings not only include using energyefficient lamps but behavioural changes and maximising daylightuse. Since the penetration of energy efficient lamps differs perhousehold, we have assumed that the savings potential is themaximum saving multiplied by 1 minus the penetration rate. The resulting savings are given in Table 10.8.
3. Set-top boxes Set-top boxes (STBs) are used to decode satellite
or cable television programmes and are a major new source of energydemand. More than a billion are projected to be purchased worldwideover the next decade. The energy use of an average set-top box is 20-30 W, but it uses nearly the same amount of energy when switchedoff
56. In the USA, STB energy use is estimated at 15 TWh/year , or
about 1.3% of residential electricity use57. With more advanced uses,
for instance digital video recorders (DVRs), STB energy use isforecast to triple to 45 TWh/year by 2010 – an 18% annual growthrate and 4% of 2010 residential electricity use. 
Because of their short lifetimes (on average five years) and high
ownership growth rates, STBs provide an opportunity for significant
short term energy savings. Cable/satellite boxes without DVRs use 100to 200 kWh of electricity per year , whilst combined with DVRs theyuse between 200 and 400 kWh per year . Media receiver boxes use lessenergy (around 35 kWh per year) but must be used in conjunctionwith existing audiovisual equipment and computers, thus addinganother 35 kWh to the annual energy use of existing home electronics.Figure 10.12 shows the annual energy use of common householdappliances. This shows that the energy use of some set-top boxesapproaches that of the major energy consuming household appliances. Reducing the energy use of set-top boxes is complicated by their
complex operating and communication modes. Althoughimprovements in power supply design and efficiency will be effectivein reducing energy use, the major savings will be obtained throughenergy management measures. The study by Rainer et al (2004)reports a savings potential of between 32% and 54% over five years(2005-2010). Assuming that these drastic measures have not yetbeen applied and due to lack of data on other regions, we have takenthese reduction percentages as the global potential up to 2050. 10energy efficient households |LOW ENERGY HOUSEHOLD

4. cold appliances The average household in OECD Europe
consumed 700 kWh/year of electricity for food refrigeration in 2000compared with 1,034 kWh/year in Japan, 1 216 kWh/year in OECDAustralasia and 1,294 kWh/year in OECD North America. Thesefigures illustrate differences in average household storage capacities,the ratio of frozen to fresh food use, ambient temperatures andhumidity, and food storage temperatures and control
58. European
households typically either have a refrigerator-freezer in the kitchen(sometimes with an additional freezer or refrigerator), or they have arefrigerator and a separate freezer . Practical height and width limitsplace constraints on the available internal storage space for anappliance. Similar constraints apply in Japanese households, whereownership of a single refrigerator-freezer is the norm, but are lesspressing in OECD North America and Australia. In these countriesalmost all households have a refrigerator-freezer and many also havea separate freezer and occasionally a separate refrigerator . Looking in detail at the situation in the European Union, we found
that in 2003, 103 TWh of electricity was consumed by household coldappliances alone (15% of total 2004 residential end use). A coldappliance with an energy use rating of A++ uses 120 kWh per year ,while a comparable appliance with energy rating B uses 300 kWh peryear and with rating C 600 kWh per year
59. The average energy rating
of appliances sold in the EU-15 countries is still B. If only A++appliances were sold, energy consumption would be 60% less. Theaverage lifetime of a cold appliance is 15 years, which means that 15years from the introduction of only A++ labelled appliances, 60% lessenergy would be used in the EU-15. According to the EuropeanCommission (see Table 10.9), consumption in TWh/y could decreasefrom 103 in 2003 to 80 in 2010 with additional policies to encourageefficient appliances. This means that the energy efficiency of coldappliances could increase by about 3.5% each year . 
Based on this analysis, we have assumed for the Technical scenario
an energy efficiency improvement of 3.5% per year from 2010onwards. This would lead to an efficiency improvement of 77% in2050. For the [R]evolution Scenario we have assumed a 2.5% peryear efficiency improvement, corresponding to 64% in 2050.10energy efficient households |LOW ENERGY HOUSEHOLD

1555. computers and servers The average desktop computer uses
about 120 W per hour - the monitor 75 W and the centralprocessing unit 45 W - and the average laptop 30 W per hour .Current best practice monitors
60use only 18 W (15 inch screen),
which is 76% less than the average. Savings for computers areespecially important in the commercial sector. According to a 2006
US study, computers and monitors have the highest energyconsumption in an office after lighting. In Europe, office equipmentuse is considered to be less important (see Figure 4), but estimatesdiffer widely
61. Some studies have shown that automatic and/or
manual power management of computers and monitors cansignificantly reduce their energy consumption. 
A power managed computer consumes less than half the energy of a
computer without power management
62, depending on how your
computer is used; power management can reduce the annual energyconsumption of a computer and monitor by as much as 80%
63.
Approximately half of all office computers are left on overnight andat weekends (75% of the time). Apart from switching off at night,using LCD (liquid crystal display) monitors requires less energy thanCRT (cathode ray tube). An average LCD screen uses 79% lessenergy than an average CRT monitor if both are power-managed
64.
Further savings can be made by ensuring computers enter low powermode when they are idle during the day. Another benefit ofdecreasing the power consumption of computers and monitors isthat it reduces the load for air conditioning. According to a 2002study by Roth et al, office equipment increases the air conditioningload by 0.2-0.5 kW per kW of office equipment power consumption.
The average computer with a CRT monitor in constant operation uses
1,236 kWh/y (482kWh/y for the computer and 754kWh/y for themonitor). With power management this reduces to 190kWh/y(86+104). Effective power management can save 1,046kWh percomputer and CRT monitor per year , a reduction of 84%, or 505kWhper computer and LCD monitor per year . These examples illustratethat power management can have a greater effect than just moreefficient equipment. The German website EcoTopten, for example, saysthat more efficient computers save 50-70% compared with oldermodels and efficient flat-screens use 70% less energy than CRTs. 
Servers are multiprocessor systems running comm ercial workl oads
65. The
typical breakdown of peak power server use is shown in Table 10.10.Data centres are facilities that primarily contain electronic
equipment used for data processing, data storage andcommunications networking
66. 80% of servers are located in these
data centres67. Worldwide, about three million data centres and 32
million servers are in operation. Approximately 25% of servers arelocated in the EU, but only 10% of data centres, meaning that onaverage each data centre hosts a relatively large number of servers(Fichter , 2007). The installed base of servers is growing rapidly dueto an increasing demand for data processing and storage. Newdigital services such as music downloads, video-on-demand, onlinebanking, electronic trading, satellite navigation and internettelephony spur this rapid growth, as well as the increasingpenetration of computers and the internet in developing countries.Since systems have become more and more complex to handleincreasingly large amounts of data, power and energy consumption(about 50% used for cooling
68) have grown in parallel. The power
density of data centres is rising by approximately 15% each year69.
Aggregate electricity use for servers doubled over the period 2000to 2005 both in the US and worldwide (see Figure 10.13). Datacentres accounted for roughly 1% of global electricity use in 2005(14 GW) (Koomey, 2007).

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
Power and energy consumption are key concerns for internet data
centres and there is a significant potential for energy efficiencyimprovements. Existing technologies and design strategies havebeen shown to reduce the energy use of a typical server by 25% ormore
70. Energy management efforts in existing data centres could
reduce their energy usage by around 20%, according to the USEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
The US EPA scenario for reducing server energy use includes
measures such as enabling power management, consolidatingservers and storage, using liquid instead of air cooling, improvingthe efficiency of chillers, pumps, fans and transformers and usingcombined heat and power . This bundle of measures could reduceelectricity use by up to 56% compared to current efficiency trends(or 60% compared to historical trends), the EPA concludes,representing the maximum technical potential by 2011. Thisassumes that only 50% of current data centres can introduce thesemeasures. A significant savings potential is therefore available forservers and data centres around the world by 2050. For computersand servers we have based the savings potential on the WBCSD2005 report and other sources mentioned in this section. For theTechnical scenario this would result in 70% savings, for the[R]evolution Scenario 55% savings. 6. air conditioning Today in the USA, some 14 % of total electrical
consumption is used to air condition buildings
71. Increasing use of
small air conditioning units (less than 12 kW output cooling power) insouthern European cities, mainly during the summer months, is alsodriving up electricity consumption. Total residential electricity
consumption for air conditioners in the EU-25 in 2005 was estimatedto be between 7 and 10 TWh per year
72. However , we should not
underestimate the consumption in developing countries. Many of theseare located in warm climatic zones. With the rapid development of itseconomy and improving l iving st andards, central air conditioning units
are now widely used in China, for example. They currently account forabout 20% of total Chinese electricity consumption
73. 
There are several options for technological savings in air conditioning
equipment. One is to use a different refrigerant. Tests with therefrigerant Ikon B show possible energy consumption reductions of 20-25% compared to the commonly used liquids
74. However , behavioural
changes should not be overlooked. One example of a smart alternativeto cooling a whole house was developed by the company EveningBreeze. This combined a mosquito net, bed and air conditioning so thatonly the bed had to be cooled instead of the whole bedroom. 
There are also other options for cooling, such as geothermal cooling by
heat pumps. This uses the same principle as geothermal heating, namelythat the temperature at a certain depth below the Earth’s surfaceremains constant year round. In the winter we can use this relativelyhigh temperature to warm our houses. Conversely, we can use therelatively cold temperature in the summer to cool our houses. There areseveral technical concepts available, but all rely on transferring the heatfrom the air in the building to the Earth. A refrigerant is used as theheat transfer medium. This concept is cost-effective
75. Heat pumps have
been gaining market share in a number of countries76. 
Solar energy can also be used for cooling through the use of solar
thermal energy or solar electricity to power a cooling appliance. Basictypes of solar cooling technologies include absorption cooling (uses solarthermal energy to vapourise the refrigerant); desiccant cooling (usessolar thermal energy to regenerate (dry) the desiccant); vapourcompression cooling (uses solar thermal energy to operate a Rankine-cycle heat engine); evaporative cooling; and heat pumps and airconditioners that can be powered by solar photovoltaic systems. To drivethe pumps only 0.05 kWh of electricity is needed, instead of 0.35 kWhfor regular air conditioning
77, representing a savings potential of 85%. 
Not only is it important to use efficient air conditioning equipment,
it is equally important to reduce the need for air conditioning in thefirst place. Important ways to reduce cooling demand are to useinsulation to prevent heat from ent ering the building, to reduce the
amount of inefficient appliances present in the house, such asincandescent lamps or old refrigerators that give off unusable heat,to use cool exterior finishes, such as ‘cool roof’ technology or light-coloured wall paint, to improve windows and use vegetation toreduce the amount of heat that comes into the house, and to useventilation instead of air conditioning units.
For air conditioning we have assumed that the savings potential
based on the 2005 WBCSD study and other sources mentioned inthis section will amount to 70% savings under the Technicalscenario and 55% savings under the [R]evolution Scenario. 10energy efficient households |LOW ENERGY HOUSEHOLD

energy efficiency standards 
- steps towards an energy equity
the standard household
In order to enable a specific level of energy demand as a basic
“right” for all people in the world, we have developed the model ofan efficient Standard Household. A fully equipped OECD household(including fridge, oven, TV, radio, music centre, computer , lights etc.)currently consumes between 1,500 and 3,400 kWh/a per person.With an average of two to four people per household the totalconsumption is therefore between 3,000 and 12,000 kWh/a. Thisdemand could be reduced to about 550 kWh/a per person just byusing the most efficient appliances available on the market today.This does not even include any significant lifestyle changes. Basedon this assumption, the ‘over-consumption’ of all households inOECD countries totals more than 2,100 billion kilowatt-hours.Comparing this figure with the current per capita consumption indeveloping countries, they would have the right to use about 1,350billion kilowatt-hours more. The ‘oversupply’ of OECD householdscould therefore fill the gap in energy supply to developing countriesone and a half times over .
By implementing a strict technical standard for all
electrical appliances, in order to achieve a level of 550kWh/a per capita consumption, it would be possibleto switch off more than 340 coal power plants in OECD countries.

159energy efficiency standards 
- the potential is huge
Setting energy efficiency standards for electrical equipment couldhave a huge impact on the world’s power sector . A large number ofpower plants could be switched off if strict technical standardswere brought into force. The table below provides an overview of thetheoretical potential for using efficiency standards based oncurrently available technology. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario
has not been calculated on the basis of this theoretical potential.However , this overview illustrates how many power plants producingelectricity would not be needed if all global appliances werebrought up to the highest efficiency standards overnight.

161Transport is a key element in reducing the level of greenhouse gases
produced by energy consumption. 28% of current energy use comesfrom the transport sector – road, rail and sea. In order to assessthe present status of global transport, including its carbonfootprint, a special study was undertaken by Ecofys. 
This chapter gives an overview of how the Ecofys Reference
Scenario was originated and the changes expected under the Energy[R]evolution Scenario. The following chapter looks specifically at thetechnical efficiency potential for cars. The main actions proposed inthe Energy [R]evolution Scenario are: increasing the use of publictransport, especially trains, reducing the number of kilometres driveneach year by private cars, and introducing more efficient vehicles.
the reference scenario for transport 
In order to calculate possible savings in the transport sector , wefirst need to construct a detailed Reference Scenario. This needs toinclude detailed shares and energy intensity data per mode oftransport and per region up to 2050. Although this data cannot befound in the IEA WEO, input is available from the WBCSD (WorldBusiness Council for Sustainable Development) mobility database.This database was completed in 2004 after collaboration betweenthe IEA and the WBCSD’s Sustainable Mobility Project to developa global transport model. Those transport options have beenselected which can be expected to result in a substantial reductionin energy demand up to 2050. 
In order to estimate the energy demand per transport sub-sector , we
need the modal shares per region up to 2050. These can becalculated by using the WBCSD final energy use per mode, addingthem together and working out the share per mode in % by regionfrom 2005-2050. In the OECD, for example, light duty vehicles(LDVs) account for 57% of total energy use, heavy trucks for 15%.
Since international shipping spreads across all regions of the world,
it has been left out whilst calculating the baseline figures. The totalis therefore made up of LDVs, heavy and medium duty freight, twoto three wheel vehicles, buses, minibuses, rail, air and nationalmarine transport. Although energy use from international marinebunkers (international shipping fuel suppliers) is not included inthese calculations, it is still estimated to account for 9% ofworldwide transport final energy demand in 2005 and 7% by2050. A recent UN report concluded that carbon dioxide emissionsfrom shipping are much greater than initially thought andincreasing at an alarming rate. It is therefore very important toimprove the energy efficiency of international shipping. Possibleoptions are examined later in this chapter .
The definitions of different transport modes for this scenario
78are:
Light-duty vehicles (LDVs) are defined as four-wheel vehicles
used primarily for personal passenger road travel. These aretypically cars, SUVs (Sports Utility Vehicles), small passengervans (up to eight seats) and personal pickup trucks. Within thisreport we will sometimes call light-duty vehicles simply ‘cars’.
Heavy duty trucks are defined here as long haul trucks operating
almost exclusively on diesel fuel. These trucks carry large loadswith lower energy intensity (energy use per tonne-kilometre ofhaulage) than medium duty trucks such as delivery trucks. Medium duty trucks include medium haul trucks and delivery vehicles. 
Buses have been divided into two size classes - full size buses and
minibuses - with the latter roughly encompassing the range ofsmall buses and large passenger vans prevalent around thedeveloping world and typically used for informal transit services. 
All air travel in each region (domestic and international) is
treated together . 
The Figures below show the breakdown of final energy demand for
transport by mode in 2005 and 2050.
As can be seen from the above figures, the largest share of energy
demand comes from cars, although it slightly decreases from 48%in 2005 to 44% in 2050. The share of air transport increases from13% to 19%. Of particular note is the high share of road transportin total transport energy demand: 82% in 2005 and 74% in 2050.The Figures below show world final energy use for the transportsector by region in 2005 and 2050.11transport |REFERENCE SCENARIO

162GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
As we can see, OECD Europe has the highest final energy use,
followed by OECD North America and OECD Pacific. Over time, theshares of these regions will decrease while the shares of all otherregions will increase. In 2050, OECD Europe will still be thelargest final energy user , but now followed by China. Figure 11.3and Figure 11.4 show the forecast worldwide growth of differentpassenger and freight transport modes. Light duty vehicles willremain the most important mode of passenger transport, air ,passenger rail and two wheeled transport are expected to grow
considerably, while three wheeled transport is expected to grow onlyslightly. Buses and minibus passenger transport is expected todecline a little. Heavy duty trucks will remain the most importantmode of freight transport. Freight rail, inland navigation andmedium duty trucks will also increase, but will remain ‘inferior’modes in the Reference Scenario. 11transport |REFERENCE SCENARIO

164GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
the future of the transport sector in the energy
[r]evolution scenario
The Reference Scenario shows that changes in patterns ofpassenger travel are partly a consequence of growing wealth. AsGDP per capita increases, people tend to migrate towards faster ,more flexible and more expensive travel modes (from buses andtrains to cars and air). With faster modes, people also tend totravel further and do not reduce the amount of time spenttravelling
79. There is also a strong correlation between GDP growth
and increases in freight transport. More economic activity willmean more transport of raw materials, intermediary products andfinal consumer goods. 
All the above figures and tables illustrate the importance of both a
modal shift and a slowing of growth in forecast transport ifemissions reductions are to be achieved. Furthermore, it is veryimportant to make the remaining transport as clean as possible,signalling the role of energy efficiency improvements. Unlimitedgrowth in the transport sector is simply not an option. A shifttowards a sustainable energy system, which respects natural limitsand saves the world’s climate, requires a mix of lifestyle changesand new technologies. We basically need to use our cars less, flyless and use more public transport, as well as cutting down thetransport kilometres for freight transport whilst introducing morenew and highly efficient vehicles.
technical potentials We have looked at three options for
decreasing energy demand in the transport sector:
Reduction of transport demand.
Modal shift from high energy intensive transport modes to low
energy intensity.
Energy efficiency improvements.step 1: reduction of transport demand 
A reduction in transport demand involves reducing passenger-km percapita and reducing freight transport demand. The amount of freighttransport is to a large extent linked to GDP development andtherefore difficult to influence. However , by improved logistics, forexample optimal load profiles for trucks, the demand can be limited. 
passenger transport First we must look at reducing passenger
transport demand. For this we need to examine the transportdemand per capita in the Reference Scenario, as shown in Table11.3. This shows that transport demand is highest in OECD NorthAmerica, followed by the OECD Pacific. Demand per capita islowest in Africa and India. 
The potential for reducing passenger transport demand is very difficult
to determine. For OECD countries we have assumed that transportdemand per capita can be reduced by 10% by 2050 in comparison tothe Reference Scenario. For the non-OECD countries we have assumedin the [R]evolution Scenario – as a matter of equity - no reduction intransport demand per capita because the current demand is alreadyquite low in comparison to the OECD. We have made an exception forthe Transition Economies, where we assume that transport demandper capita can be reduced by 5% in 2050.
The table below shows the profile of passenger transport demand
per capita in 2005, development under the Reference Scenario by2050 and the reduced transport demand under the [R]evolutionScenario, broken down by region. 
Policy measures for reducing passenger transport
demand could include:
Price incentives that increase transport costs
Incentives for working from home 
Stimulating the use of video conferencing in businesses 
Improved cycle paths in cities11transport |[R]EVOLUTION SCENARIO

165freight transport In the Reference Scenario the largest absolute
increase in freight transport demand is expected in the TransitionEconomies, whilst the largest percentage increase is forecast in China(383%). The potential for reducing demand for freight transport byimproved logistics is difficult to estimate. For the [R]evolutionScenario we have assumed that freight transport demand can bereduced by 5% in comparison to the Reference Scenario, althoughonly through measures in the OECD and Transition Economies.step 2: changes in transport mode 
In order to decide which vehicles or transport systems are the mosteffective for each purpose, an analysis of the different technologiesis needed. To calculate the energy savings achieved by shiftingtransport mode we need to know the energy use and intensity foreach type of transport
80. The following information is needed: 
Passenger transport: Energy demand per passenger kilometre,
measured in MJ/p-km.
Freight transport: Energy demand per kilometre of transported
tonne of goods, measured in MJ/ tonne-km. 
development of passenger transport Passenger transport includes
cars, minibuses, two and three wheelers, buses, passenger rail and airtransport. Freight transport includes medium trucks, heavy trucks,national marine and freight rail. The figures below show a breakdownof passenger transport by mode in the Reference Scenario for 2005and 2050 (as % of total passenger-km). The global demand for airtransport is expected to grow from 12% in 2005 to 23% in 2050.

travelling by rail is the most efficient Figure 11.8 shows the
worldwide average specific energy consumption by transport modeunder the Reference Scenario in 2005 and 2050. This data differsfor each region. As can be seen, the difference in specific energyconsumption for each transport mode is large. Passenger transportby rail will consume 85% less energy in 2050 than car transportand by bus nearly 70% less energy. This means that there is a largeenergy savings potential to be realised by a modal shift. modal shift for passengers in the energy [r]evolution scenario
From the figures above we can conclude that in order to reducetransport energy demand by modal shift, passengers have to move fromcars and air transport to the lower intensity passenger rail and bustransport. As an indication of the action required we can take Japan asa ‘best practice country’. In 2004, Japan had a large share of p-km byrail (29%) thanks to the fact that it had established a strong urban andregional rail system
81. Comparing different regions with the example of
Japan, and assuming that 40 years is enough time to build up anextensive rail network, the following modal shifts have been assumed: 
This means that in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario 2.5% of car
transport shifts to rail and 2.5% to bus. In total this means a reductionin car transport of 7.5% in comparison to the Reference Scenario.

transporting goods by rail is the most efficient Figure 11.12
shows the energy intensity for world average freight transport in2005 and 2050 under the Reference Scenario. Energy intensity forall modes of transport is expected to decrease by 2050. 
modal shift for transporting goods in the energy [r]evolution
scenario From the figures above we can conclude that in order to
reduce transport energy demand by modal shift, freight has to movefrom medium and heavy duty trucks to the less energy intensivefreight rail and national marine. Canada is a ‘best practice’ countryin this respect, with 29% of freight transported by trucks, 39% byrail and 32% by ships. Since the use of ships largely depends onthe geography of the country, we do not propose a modal shift fornational ships but instead a shift towards freight rail. China, OECDPacific and the Transition Economies already have a low share oftruck usage, so for these regions we will not assume a modal shift.For the other regions we have assumed the following changes:freight transport Figures 11.9 and 11.10 show the breakdown of
freight transport in percentages of total tonnes-km per year and byregion under the Reference Scenario. Both the Transition Economiesand China have a very large proportion of rail transport while theDeveloping Asia and the Middle East have a very small share. Theshare of heavy and medium trucks is very large in the Developing Asiacountries and OECD Europe. National marine transport plays animportant role in the OECD Pacific. The figures also show that thedifference between 2005 and 2050 is relatively small.

marine transport Since the WBCSD did not provide estimates for
total national marine tonnes-km per year or energy intensities perregion, we have calculated these ourselves. Data for energy intensityfor the year 2005 in OECD countries was found in OECD/IEA, 2007.For other regions we have assumed that the highest OECD estimatewould hold. The 2050 intensities were extrapolated from 2005 datausing 1% per year autonomous efficiency improvement. The amountof t-km per year could then be calculated using the ReferenceScenario energy use divided by the energy intensity in MJ/t-km.step 3: efficiency improvements or travelling with less energy

Akerman, 2005. He reports that a 65% reduction in fuel use istechnically feasible by 2050. This has been applied to 2005 energyintensity data in order to calculate the technical potential. Thefigure below shows the energy intensity per region in the ReferenceScenario and in the two low energy demand scenarios.
All regions have the same energy intensities in 2005 due to lack of
regionally-differentiated data. Numbers shown are a global average.The projection of future energy intensity is based on IEA data over the1990-2000 period, when intensity improved at about 0.7% per year .11transport |[R]EVOLUTION SCENARIO

wind power , which has no fuel costs, to contribute to the motive power oflarge freight-carrying ships, which currently use increasingly expensiveand environmentally damaging oil. Instead of a traditional sail fitted to amast, the system uses large towing kites to contribute to the ship’spropulsion. Shaped like paragliders, they are tethered to the vessel byropes and can be controlled automatically, responding to wind conditionsand the ship’s trajectory.
The kites can operate at altitudes of between 100 and 300 metres,
where stronger and more stable winds prevail. By means of dynamicflight patterns, the SkySails are able to generate five times morepower per square metre of sail area than conventional sails. Dependingon the prevailing winds, the company claims that a ship’s averageannual fuel costs can be reduced by 10 to 35%. Under optimal windconditions, fuel consumption can temporarily be cut by up to 50%. 
On the first voyage of the Beluga SkySails, a 133m long specially
built cargo ship, the towing kite propulsion system was able totemporarily substitute for approximately 20 % of the vessel’s mainengine power , even in moderate winds. The company is now planninga kite twice the size of this 160m

The designers say that virtually all sea-going cargo vessels can be
retro- or outfitted with the SkySails propulsion system withoutextensive modifications. If 1,600 ships would be equiped with thesesails by 2015 ,it would save over 146 million tonnes of CO

Thefigure below shows the energy intensity per region in the ReferenceScenario and in the two low energy demand scenarios.
Energy intensities for passenger rail transport are assumed to be the
same for all regions due to a lack of sufficiently detailed data. Thedifferentiation in energy intensity for freight rail is based on thefollowing assumption: regions with longer average distances for freightrail (such as the US and Former Soviet Union), and where more rawmaterials are transported (such as coal), show a lower energy intensitythan other regions (Fulton & Eads, 2004). Future projections use tenyear historic IEA data. Rail intensities are and will remain highest inOECD Europe and OECD Pacific and lowest in India.11transport |[R]EVOLUTION SCENARIO

buses and minibuses The company Enova Systems is promoting a
‘clean bus’ with a 100% improvement in fuel economy. We haveadopted this improvement and applied it to 2005 energy intensitynumbers per region. For minibuses the American Council for anEnergy Efficient Economy reports
83a fuel economy improvement of
55% by 2015. Since this is a very ambitious target and will mostlikely not be reached, we have extended it up to 2050 and adopted itas the technical potential (see Figure 11.16 and Figure 11.17).Currently, buses in North America consume far and away the mostenergy. The Reference Scenario predicts an increase in all regionsbetween 2005 and 2050. Although in general more efficient buses arebeing produced, this is offset by increases in average bus size, weightand power . OECD buses have much more powerful engines than non-OECD buses, but the latter are likely to catch up over this period.

trucks (freight by road) Elliott et al., 2006 give possible savings
for heavy and medium-duty freight trucks. This list of reductionoptions is expanded in Lensink and De Wilde, 2007. For mediumduty trucks a fuel economy saving of 50% is reported by 2030(mainly due to hybridisation). We applied this percentage to 2005energy intensity data, calculated the fuel economy improvement peryear and extrapolated this yearly growth rate up to 2050. For heavyduty trucks we applied the same methodology, arr iving at a 39%
savings. Current intensities are highest in the Middle East, India andAfrica and lowest in OECD North America. The Reference Scenariopredicts that future values will converge, assuming past improvementpercentages and assuming a higher learning rate in developingregions.

171marine transport National marine savings have also been taken
from the Lensink and De Wilde study. They report 20% savings in2030 for inland navigation as a realistic potential with currentlyavailable technology, and ultimate efficiency savings of up to 30%for the current fleet. To a rrive at the potential in 2050, we used the
same approach as described for road freight above. OECD Pacifichas the lowest current energy intensity due to the fact that theyhave a large proportion of long haul trips where larger (less energyintensive) boats can be used. All energy intensities are expected toimprove by 1% per year up to 2050. Reference Scenario energyintensities and the technical potentials for national marinetransport are shown in Figure 11.20.

IEA/SMP (2004), where 0.3 MJ/p.km is the lowest value. Forthree wheelers we have assumed that the technical potential is 0.5MJ/p.km in 2050. The uncertainty in these potentials is high,although two and three wheelers only account for 1.5% oftransport energy demand.

passenger cars This section is based on a special study conducted
by the DLR’s Institute for Vehicle Concepts to investigate thepotential for improving the efficiency of existing cars and movingtowards greater use of hybrid or electric vehicles. See Chapter 12for a full account of this analysis.
Many technologies can be used to improve the fuel efficiency of
passenger cars. Examples include improvements in engines, weightreduction and friction and drag reduction
84. The impact of the various
measures on fuel efficiency can be substantial. Hybrid vehicles,combining a conventional combustion engine with an electric engine,have relatively low fuel consumption. The most well-known is theToyota Prius, which originally had a fuel efficiency of about five litresof gasoline-equivalent per 100 km (litre ge/100 km). Recently, Toyotapresented an improved version with a lower fuel consumption of 4.3litres ge/100 km. Further developments are underway, as shown bythe presentation of new concept cars by the main US carmanufacturers in 2000 with a specific fuel use as low as three litresge/100 km. There are suggestions that applying new lightweightmaterials, in combination with the new propulsion technologies, canbring fuel consumption levels down to 1 litre ge/100 km.
Based on SRU (2005), the technical potential in 2050 for a diesel
fuelled car is 1.6 and for a petrol car 2.0 litres ge/100 km. Based onthe sources in Table 11.6, we have assumed 2.0 litres as the technicalpotential for Europe and adopted the same improvement in efficiency(about 3% per year) for other regions. In order to reach this targetin time, these more efficient cars need to be on the market by 2030 –assuming that the maximum lifetime of a car is 20 years.the energy [r]evolution scenario for passenger cars The figure

highest in OECD North America and Africa and lowest in OECDEurope. The Reference Scenario shows a decrease in energyintensities in all regions, but the division between highest and lowestwill remain the same, although there will be some convergence.

175Since the global use of privately owned cars (light duty vehicles)
currently accounts for more carbon dioxide emissions than any otherform of transport, the DLR’s Institute for Vehicle Concepts wascommissioned to look specifically at the potential for reductions inthis sector . At the same time, the door has already been opened forboth major technological changes and shifts in personal habits.Rising oil prices, increasing concern about climate change and, insome regions, legislation on everything from bio fuels to vehicleemissions, have together combined to put pressure on internationalvehicle manufacturers to investigate solutions. Numerous technicalfixes are already in production which can improve the efficiency ofthe predominant internal combustion engine, as well as movingtowards alternatives no longer based on fossil fuels. 
This specific study of the light duty vehicle market concludes that a
number of measures could help reduce the CO
2emissions from cars
very significantly to a target level of about 80 g CO 2per km for the
European Union. These measures include a major shift to vehiclespowered by (renewable) electricity, a range of efficiencyimprovements to the power trains of existing internal combustionengines and behavioural changes leading to an overall reduction inkilometres travelled. 
methodology
The DLR developed a global scenario for cars based on a detailedbottom-up model covering ten world regions. The aim was toproduce a challenging but feasible scenario which would lowerglobal CO
2emissions within the context of the overall emission
reduction objective. Cars contribute about 45% of the greenhousegas emissions from the entire transport sector , the largestproportion of any mode.
This approach takes into account a vast range of technical
measures to reduce the energy consumption of vehicles, but alsoconsiders the dramatic increase in vehicle ownership and annualmileage taking place in developing countries. The turnover ofreplacement vehicles has been modelled over five year stages from2005 to 2050. The scenario assumes that a large share ofrenewable electricity is available in the future. The majorparameters for achieving increased efficiency are: 
vehicle technology 
alternative fuels 
changes in sales by vehicle size 
changes in vehicle kilometres travelled 
This section will examine the development of the world’s car fleet in
more detail and is focused on non-technical as well as technicalsolutions. Light duty vehicles and their technologies are d ivided into
three vehicle segments (small, medium and large) and ninecategories of fuel/propulsion technology:conventional petrol 
petrol hybrid
conventional diesel
diesel hybrid
LPG/CNG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas/Compressed Natural Gas)
LPG/CNG hybrid
fuel cell hydrogen
battery electric
plug in-hybrid electric vehicles
As a Reference Scenario for the starting point in 2005, the analysis in
the IEA/SMP model
85has been used. This is the most comprehensive and
detailed model available for CO 2emissions from the global transport
sector . For those technologies not included in the SMP model, we had todecide starting points for today’s performance values (see below). Wethen created so-called ‘target reference vehicles’ (TRVs), which projectthe energy consumption feasible for each of the main fuel conversiontechnologies. This is described in the section ‘Future vehicle technologies’.The TRVs will be introduced in the different regions of the world over avarying timescale. In general, the technologies to achieve the TRVs areaimed to be available for sale in 2050 - 42 years from now. 
In general, we have first introduced the most recent - and most
expensive - technologies in the currently industrialised countries, andpostponed their introduction in the rest of the world. We have then usedthe option to change the energy source used to fuel light duty transport.This is described in the section ‘Projection of future technology mix’.Various non-technical measures are reflected in the projections forfuture vehicle sales (see ‘Projection of vehicle segment split’), in theprojection for the absolute number of vehicles sold in the future (see‘Projection of global vehicle stock development’) and in the projectionof how much individual vehicles are used compared to other transportmeans in the future (see ‘Projection of kilometres driven’). 
reference scenario 
The IEA Reference Scenario developed for the Mobility 2030 project
86
was used as the starting point for the year 2005 key data and for
comparison as a ‘business as usual’ scenario. It is important to note thatfor this scenario no major new policies were assumed to be implementedbeyond those already introduced by 2003. While for some areas, such aspollution control, further so called policy trajectories have beenassumed, this was not the case for fuel consumption. Trends in futurefuel consumption are therefore based on historical (non-policy driven)trends
87. If the serious discussions taking place in Europe and the United
States on the regulation of fuel economy in new vehicles, together withlegal guidelines and proposed long term targets, were taken intoaccount, the business as usual case would be different. However , it isbeyond the scope of this project to redefine the status quo. Nevertheless,we include the most recent political targets in our scenario.12cars of the future |METHODOLOGY

energy [r]evolution car scenario
The alternative car scenario is targeted towards high CO 2
reductions compared to today’s levels. Summarised in brief, we
have focused on the following proposals:
Efficiency improvements resulting from technological development
Renewable electricity as the primary alternative fuel
Influencing customer behaviour in the long term
There is a huge potential for technological options to make today’s
vehicles more efficient while low ering their CO 2emissions. A car
today converts the energy in the fuel into mechanical energy inorder to take the compartment we sit in from point A to B, but itdoes it in a very inefficient way. Only 25% to 35% of the chemicalenergy in the fuel is converted into mechanical energy by theengine. The rest is lost as waste heat. Only 10% of the fuel energyis used to overcome driving resistance. Hybrid technologies mark an
important starting point for making vehicles more efficient, whilsttechnologies to lower energy demand, such as lightweight design,reduced rolling resistance wheels and improved aerodynamics, willcontribute to the achievement of very low fuel consumptions.
Renewable electricity can be produced almost everywhere in the
world, and with declining costs in the future. Taking into accountthe enormous development in batteries in recent years, we believethat electric mobility as offered by battery electric cars and plug-inhybrid electric vehicles is the preferred way to make majorreductions in the CO
2emissions of cars.
Consumer behaviour is the third major key to a lower carbon world
for the transport sector . Here we have relied on programmes,incentives and policy measures to support a shift towards lowcarbon emitting vehicles as well as reducing demand in general.

177future vehicle technologies 
The global vehicle market, with about 55 million vehicles sold per
year , is enormous. Around 500 automobile plants produce this hugequantity. Regional markets differ in the size of vehicles and fuel typeused. Depending on income, infrastructure and the spatialcharacteristics of the countries, people have different preferences forthe size of vehicles they use.
The propulsion technology used in all new cars globally does not
differ very much, however . For the sake of simplicity, therefore, wehave defined the reference target vehicles, which we use throughoutthe world, as characterised by their energy consumption ‘tank-to-wheel’, independent of the fuel used. The energy consumption for thereference target vehicles are presented in Figure 12.3.
Differences in energy consumption ‘tank-to-wheel’ shown in Figure 12.3
reflect the different efficiencies with which vehicles convert fuel energyinto movement. The various fuels and energy sources have differentqualities, depending on their upstream production processes. This istaken into account in the model. In the light of high energy prices andthus growing costs for individual mobility, we foresee a market fordedicated small commuter vehicles. These cars would servepredominantly for the transport of a single person, reflecting today’scar usage in industrialised countries. Although there will still be seatsfor three to five people, the comfort for the car passengers will be less.Therefore the ‘small’ passenger vehicle of the future is projected to besmaller than it is today and therefore less energy intensive
88. 
Due to the differences in income level between the world’s regions,
which we have assumed to be still valid in 2050, the referencetarget vehicles are applied to new vehicle sales in the year 2050 fortoday’s most industrialised regions: OECD Europe, North Americaand OECD Pacific. For all other regions, they are envisaged to enterthe market in 2060, ten years later , and 20 years later in Africa.gasoline and diesel cars 
For traditional internal combustion engines, we have only allowed
here for improvements in starting and stopping and no other hybridfeatures. Other vehicle adaptations to be introduced up to 2050 aredescribed in more detail below. 
For the small car sector we project a 1.8 litre/100 km (NEDC) four-
seater diesel vehicle, as described in simulations by Friedrich
89. We
found corresponding results from our own simulations for a low-energyconcept car with space for three adults and two children. For gasoline,we project 2.4 l/100 km. For the medium size sector , we project thepotential for a 50% reduction in CO
2for gasoline cars and 42% for
diesel cars. Approximately half of these reductions will be derived frompower train improvements (including starting and stopping) and halffrom an improvement in energy demand. Aerodynamics, rollingresistance and lightweight design will contribute as described below. 
For the large size sector , a slightly higher 60% emissions reduction
is predicted, resulting from higher mass reduction and greaterdownsizing potentials (due to current over-motorisation). Inaddition, we have assumed political measures have been introduced,such as luxury taxes, in addition to high fuel costs, to reduce thesales of very large SUVs (Sport Utility Vehicles) for passengertransport. This means that the size of vehicles within the segmentwill also decrease over the years. Examples of future cross-overSUVs are projected, for example by Lovins and Cramer
90. 
Although considerable improvements are in sight for conventional
gasoline and diesel engines without hybridisation, they will betechnically hard to reach. Significant CO
2reductions in the short to
medium term will therefore be much easier and cheaper to achievewith the hybridisation of power trains. 12cars of the future |ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
hybrid vehicles
Hybrid drive trains consist of at least two different energy converters
and two energy storage units. The most common is the hybrid-electricdrive train, although there are also proposals for kinetic andhydraulic hybrids. Advantages of the combination of the internalcombustion engine with a second source of power arise from avoidinginefficient working regimes of the internal combustion engine (ICE),recuperation of braking energy, engine displacement downsizing andautomated gear switch. For hybrid-electric vehicles, there are severaldifferent architectures and levels of hybridisation proposed. 
Hybrid vehicles have been available since the 1990s. In 2006,
approximately 400,000 hybrid cars were sold, which is less than 1%of world car production. An increasing number of hybrid models arebeing announced, however . For this study we have used referencevalues of 4
91, 4.592, 8.393 lge/100 km respectively for small, medium
and large gasoline vehicles94. 
For the reference target vehicles in 2050, we have projected the
following values, depending on the vehicle segment.
small segment: As explained above, the small segment vehicles will
be of the ‘1 litre car’ type - smaller and lighter than today. Adedicated vehicle in the 500 kg class, with three seats and with ahighly efficient propulsion system, will be standard by 2050,especially for commuting or other journeys were no multi-purposefamily type vehicle is necessary. The fuel consumption for this type ofvehicle is projected to be 1.6 lge/100 km. 
medium segment: We developed our vision of reaching 60 g CO 2
per km for the medium segment following the technological buildingblocks described below, although this might not be the only way toreach the target.
A 25% emissions reduction is envisaged by using turbo charging
with variable turbine geometry, external cooled exhaust gasrecirculation, gasoline direct injection (2nd generation) andvariable valve control/cam phase shifting with respectivescavenging strategies. These measures all result in a downsizingand down speeding of the engine
95. 
An additional potential for a 25% saving, related to the previous step,
will come from hybridisation and the benefits in terms of start/stopimprovements, regenerative braking and further downsizing. Wasteheat recovery by thermoelectric generators will contribute to the on-board power supply, which saves an additional 3 to 5%
96 97. 
A reduction in the vehicle’s mass from 360 kg to 1,000 kg will reduce
energy demand by about 18%98. To achieve lightweight construction,
methods such as topology optimisation, multi-material design and highlyintegrated components will be used. Mass reductions of 60 to 120 kgfor midsized cars have already been achieved
99. The production and
recycling processes of lightweight materials such as magnesium andcarbon fibres will also be improved in 30-40 years time, thus avoiding ashift in emissions from the utilisation to the production phase. 
Aerodynamic resistance, aerodynamic drag and frontal areas offer
further potential for improvements. By optimising the car’sunderside, engine air flows and contours we project an additionallowering of energy demand by 8%. Rolling resistance depends on the material used for the tyre, the
construction of the tyre and its radius, tyre pressures and dr iving
speed. The tyre industry has proposed new concepts for wheels whichare intended to lower rolling resistance by 50% by 2030
100 101.
Reducing the rolling coefficient by 1/1000 will lead to fuel savings of0.08 l/100 km
102. This results in an additional 12% CO 2savings. 
Further potentials for energy savings will come from ‘intelligent
controllers’ which improve energy management and drive traincontrol strategies by recognising frequently driven journeys. Improvedtraffic management to help a driver find the energy optimised routemight also make a contribution. Other options for hybridisation couldcome from free piston linear generators, which produce electricitywith a constant high efficiency, at the same time avoiding part loadconditions because of the variable cylinder capacity
103. 
From the technologies and potentials described here, we project that
within the next 40 years an improvement of 64% in energyconsumption for hybrid vehicles is achievable, resulting in 2.6 l/100km or 60 g CO
2/km for a middle sized car in the NEDC test cycle. This
corresponds to an annual improvement of 2.2%. It is likely that othercombinations will lead to similar results, for example by following fullhybridisation first, with a potential saving of 44%
104[26] and adding
complementary measures. We have also applied an 18% increase infuel consumption based on a realistic assessment of dr iving patterns.
The Volkswagen Golf V FSI 1.6 l, with a 1,360 kg mass and 163 gCO
2/km in NEDC was used as a starting point105.
large segment: For large vehicles, the same technologies as
described for the medium segment can be applied. We believe,however , that the potential for improvements is higher and projectfuel consumption in 2050 at 3.5 lge/100 km. In addition, we assumethat political measures to reduce the sales of very large SUVs forpassenger transport have been introduced, so that the size ofvehicles within the segment will also decrease.12cars of the future |ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

179battery electric vehicles
Battery electric vehicles already have a long history, starting in
1881 with the first electric vehicle powered by a secondary Plantébattery
106. Considerable activity in the 1990s resulted in a number of
production scale electric cars such as the EV1 (GM), Saxoelectrique (Citroen), Hijet EV (Daihatsu), Th!nk City (Ford), EVPlus (Honda), Altra EV (Nissan), Clio Electric (Renault) and theRAV 4 (Toyota). At the beginning of the 21st century the TeslaRoadster is among the most prominent. There is also a continuousflow of prototype electric cars, including the Ion (Peugeot), E1(BMW), A-Class electric (DaimlerChysler) and E-com (Toyota). 
Battery electric vehicles are already very efficient. A fuel
consumption of 1.7 litres gasoline equivalent /100 km is reportedfor the Ford e-Ka
107, 2.1 l/100 km for the Ford Ecostar and 3.4
l/100 km for the Chrysler van108. In the future we anticipate
reference target values of 0.7 l/100 km for small size cars based onsimulations for micro cars and 1.4 l/100 km for medium sizevehicles based on simulations of city and compact class vehicles. Wedo not consider battery vehicles for the large vehicle segment.
There is a considerable gap between test cycle results and real
driving experience because of auxiliary power needs, for example forheating, cooling and other electrical services. We have thereforeapplied a factor of 1.7 to the transfer from test cycle to real worlddriving based on simulation results. 
Battery electric vehicles carry their energy along on board in a
chemical form. The future battery technology for vehicles will mostprobably be based on Lithium because of good energy densities andcost prospects. Remaining issues associated with the application ofbatteries in vehicles are safety, long term durability and costs.However , under the most optimistic estimates for batterydevelopment, battery electric vehicles will mainly be small vehiclesand those with dedicated usage profiles like urban fleets. Otherproblems to be solved are fast recharging and cycle stability.Technical solutions have already been proposed, and the costreduction target for batteries in the long term is to reach 1/40th oftoday’s figures. An enormous amount of research is being carried out,as well as production of the first vehicle-type batteries. This scenarioassumes the introduction of battery electric vehicles from 2015.plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles
Plug-in-hybrids are a combination of conventional hybrids and
battery electric vehicles. They promise to provide both advantages:using low carbon and cheap energy from the grid, a wide travelrange and grid independent dr iving when n ecessary. Plug-in-hybrids
can be adapted from conventional hybrids by changing to a highercapacity battery, but different concepts, so-called series hybrids, arealso proposed. Again, depending on the control strategy, differentconcepts are possible. The ICE, for example, is designed as a range-extender to recharge the battery only or a battery plusICE/generator provides energy, depending on the power need. Fueland energy consumption depend very much on the system layout andcontrol strategy, combined with the distance, frequency and speeddriven. We project 2.3, 2.4, 4.5 lge/100 km following the announcedspecification for the Volvo Recharge concept car and other input
109.
By the year 2050 we project that plug-in hybrids will use 10% more
energy in electric mode compared to our projection for batteryelectric vehicles due to their increased weight. Once the battery isbelow the recharge limit, the ICE/generator will provide the energyin part or full. In this operating mode we again project 10% higherfuel consumption than their conventional hybrid counterparts. Interms of CO
2balance the distribution of kilometres driven in electric
and ICE modes is crucial. We anticipate that 80% of all kilometreswill be driven in electric mode. In this scenario the introduction ofplug-in-hybrid electric vehicles starts in 2015.
fuel cell hydrogen 
Fuel cell vehicles have reached a high level of readiness for mass
production. The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell provides highpower density, resulting in low weight, cost and volume . Averagedrive cycle efficiencies have reached 3.5 lge/100 km
111. Major
problems still to be solved are durability, operating temperature rangeand cost reductions. Hydrogen on-board storage to provide a largedriving range is a further issue not finally solved. Nevertheless, thetechnology seems ready to begin the transition into the mass market.
The main problem in fact is not so much the vehicles themselves as
the hydrogen they need. Before the vehicles can operate, a hydrogeninfrastructure needs to be established. The investment involved isrisky, not least because of the competing electric systems. Becauseof energy losses in the hydrogen production chain, electricity appearsto be cheaper , easier to handle and more environmentally friendly –at least until there is renewable electricity in abundance.
The hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might find its niche, however , where
the driving range of battery electric veh icles is too low and/or locally
emission free driving is demanded or the freedom from grid-connecting is valued more highly. We have projected a 35%improvement compared to today’s fuel cell vehicles as the targetreference value because of the potential for both fuel cell systemimprovement and lightweight, rolling resistance and aerodynamicvehicles, as already described.12cars of the future |ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
projection of future vehicle technology mix
We are convinced that the share of hybrid cars will grow enormously.
For the industrialised regions, we anticipate a sales share of 65% forhybrid power trains by 2050 and for all other regions 50%, apartfrom Africa, with 25%. This share includes all types of non-gridconnected hybrids. In 2050 the balance of different hybrids will bethat in Europe, North America and OECD Pacific roughly 20% arepowered by conventional ICE engines, roughly 40% are grid-connectable and 40% are autonomous hybrids. For all other regions,34% will be conventional, a third plug-in-hybrids and a thirdautonomous hybrids. Africa is again treated differently.To power all sizes of vehicles with the same technology does not make
sense. We have therefore further projected that a large share of plug-in-electric cars in the small vehicle segment (80%) will be batteryelectric vehicles. Two-thirds of the medium sized vehicles and all of thelarge vehicles will be plug-in-hybrids, thus still having an internalcombustion engine on board.
projection of vehicle segment split
We have disaggregated the light duty vehicle sales into three
segments: small, medium and large vehicles. This gives us theopportunity to show the effect of ‘dr iving smaller cars’. The size and
CO
2emissions of the vehicles are particularly interesting in the light
of the enormous growth predicted in the LDV stock. For ourpurposes we have divided up the numer ous car types as follows. The
small car bracket includes city, supermini, microvans, mini SUV,minicompact cars and two seaters. The medium sized bracketincludes lower medium/subcompact, medium class and compactcars, car derived vans and small station wagons, upper mediumclass, midsize cars and station wagons, executive class, passengervans (subcompact, compact and standard MPV), car derivedpickups, subcompact and compact SUVs, 2WD and 4WD. Withinthe large car bracket we have included all kinds of luxury class,luxury MPV, medium and heavy vans, compact and full-size pickuptrucks (2WD, 4WD), standard and luxury SUVs.
In examining the segment split, we have focused most strongly on
the two world regions which will be the largest emitters of CO
2from
cars in 2050: North America and China. In North America todaythe small vehicle segment is almost non-existant. We havenonetheless applied a considerable growth rate of 8% per year ,triggered by rising fuel prices and possibly vehicle taxes. For China,we have anticipated the same share of the mature car market as forEurope and projected that the small segment will grow by 2.3% peryear at the expenses of the larger segments in the light of risingmass mobility. The segment split is shown in Figure 12.5.12cars of the future |ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

181projection of switch to alternative fuels
A switch to renewable fuels in the car fleet is one of the cornerstones
of our low CO 2car scenario, with the most prominent element the
direct use of renewable electricity in cars. The different types ofelectric and hybrid cars, such as battery electric and plug-in-hybrid,are summarised as ‘plug-in electric’. Their introduction will start inindustrialised countries in 2015, following an s-curve pattern, and areprojected to reach about 40% of total LDV sales in the EU, NorthAmerica and the Pacific OECD by 2050. Due to the higher costs ofthe technology and renewable electricity availability, we have slightlydelayed progress in other countries. More cautious targets areapplied for Africa. The sales split in vehicles by fuel is presented inFigure 12.7 for 2005 and 2050. projection of global vehicle stock development
Differences in forecasts for the growth of vehicle sales in developing
countries are huge
112. We have mainly used the projections from the
Reference Scenario. Slight changes were applied to vehicle sales insaturated markets such as Europe and North America, where we believethat massive policy intervention to promote modal shift and alternativeforms of car usage will show effects in vehicle sales in the long run.

projection of kilometres driven per year
Until a complete shift from fossil to renewable fuels is completed,
driving on the r oad will be linked to CO 2emissions. Thus driving less
contributes to our target for emissions reduction. However this isnot necessarily linked to less mobility because we have relied on themultitude of excellent opportunities for shifts from ind ividual
passenger road transport towards less CO
2intense public or non-
motorised transport.
In our scenario we have taken into account the effects of a variety of
policy measures which could be implemented all over the world andsummarised them in two indicators: numbers of vehicles (see thesection above) and annual kilometres driven (AKD). For AKD wehave applied a 0.25% reduction per year , assuming the first visibleeffect in 2010, resulting in a roughly 10% reduction by 2050. Thishas been coordinated into a model which projects the shift from carto rail or bus at 5%, with the additional 5% coming from LDVs aspart of the predicted demand reduction for all modes of transport
113. 
Figure 12.9 shows the effect of vehicle travel reduction over time by
world region. China shows a less typical pattern: while in Chinatoday many vehicles are used intensively, with many kilometrestravelled per year , with a growing ind ividual mobility we assume that
AKD will move towards the global average.summary of scenario results
114
A combination of ambitious efforts to introduce higher efficiency
vehicle technologies, a major switch to grid-connected electricvehicles and incentives for travellers to save CO
2all lead to the
conclusion that it is possible to reduce emissions from well-to-wheelin 2050 by roughly 25%
115compared to 1990 and 40% compared
to 2005. Even so, 74% of the final energy used in cars will still comefrom fossil fuel sources, 70% from gasoline and diesel. Renewableelectricity covers 19% of total car energy demand, bio fuels cover5% and hydrogen 2%. Energy consumption in total is reduced by23% in 2050 compared to 2005, in spite of tremendous increases insome world regions. The peak in global CO
2emissions occurs between
2010 and 2015. From 2010 onwards, new legislation in the US andEurope contributes towards breaking the upwards trend in emissions.From 2020 onwards, we can see the effect of introducing grid-connected electric cars. The development of CO
2emissions, taking
into account upstream emissions, is shown in Figure 12.8.

184GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
At a time when governments around the world are in the process of
liberalising their electricity markets, the increasing competitivenessof renewable energy should lead to higher demand. Withoutpolitical support, however , renewable energy remains at adisadvantage, marginalised by distortions in the world’s electricitymarkets created by decades of massive financial, political andstructural support to conventional technologies. Developingrenewables will therefore require strong political and economicefforts, especially through laws which guarantee stable tariffs overa period of up to 20 years.
At present new renewable energy generators have to compete with
old nuclear and fossil fuelled power stations which produceelectricity at marginal costs because consumers and taxpayers havealready paid the interest and depreciation on the originalinvestments. Political action is needed to overcome these distortionsand create a level playing field.
Renewable energy technologies would already be competitive if they
had received the same attention as fossil fuels and nuclear in termsof R&D funding, subsidies, and if external costs were reflected inenergy prices. Removing public subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclearand applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle to the energy markets,would go a long way to level the playing field and drastically reducethe need for renewables support. Unless this principle is fullyimplemented, renewable energy technologies need to receivecompensation and additional support measures in order to competein the distorted market. 
Support mechanisms for the different sectors and technologies can
vary according to regional characteristics, priorities or startingpoints. But some general principles should apply to any kind ofsupport mechanism. These criteria are: 
effectiveness in reaching the targets The experiences in some
countries show that it is possible with the right design of a supportmechanism to reach agreed national targets. Any system to beadopted at a national level should focus on being effective indeploying new installed capacity and meeting the targets.
long term stability Whether price or quantity-based, policy makers
need to make sure that investors can rely on the long-term stabilityof any support scheme. It is absolutely crucial to avoid stop-and-gomarkets by changing the system or the level of support frequently.Therefore market stability has to be created with a stable long-termsupport mechanism. 
simple and fast administrative procedures Complex licensing
procedures constitute one of the most difficult obstacles thatrenewables projects have to face. Administrative barriers have to beremoved at all levels. A ‘one-stop-shop’ system should be introducedand a clear timetable set for approving projects.encouraging local and regional benefits and public acceptance
The development of renewable technologies can have a significantimpact on local and regional areas, resulting from both installationand manufacturing. Some support schemes include publicinvolvements that hinder or facilitate the acceptance of renewabletechnologies. A support scheme should encourage local/regionaldevelopment, employment and income generation. It should alsoencourage public acceptance of renewables, including their positiveimpact and increased stakeholder involvement.
The following is an overview of current political frameworks and
barriers that need to be overcome in order to unlock renewableenergy’s great potential to become a major contributor to globalenergy supply. In the process it would also contribute to sustainableeconomic growth, high quality jobs, technology development, globalcompetitiveness and industrial and research leadership.
renewable energy targets
In recent years, as part of their greenhouse gas reduction policiesas well as for increasing security of energy supply, an increasingnumber of countries have established targets for renewable energy.These are either expressed in terms of installed capacity or as apercentage of energy consumption. Although these targets are notoften legally binding, they have served as an important catalyst forincreasing the share of renewable energy throughout the world,from Europe to the Far East to the USA. 
A time horizon of just a few years is not long enough in the
electricity sector , where the investment horizon can be up to 40years. Renewable energy targets therefore need to have short,medium and long term steps and must be legally binding in order tobe effective. They should also be supported by mechanisms such asthe ‘feed-in tariff’. In order for the proportion of renewable energyto increase significantly, targets must be set in accordance with thelocal potential for each technology (wind, solar , biomass etc) andaccording to the local infrastructure, both existing and planned. 
In recent years the wind and solar power industries have shown that it
is possible to maintain a growth rate of 30 to 35% in the renewablessector . In conjunction with the European Photovoltaic IndustryAssociation, the European Solar Thermal Power Industry Associationand the European Wind Energy Association
116, Greenpeace and EREC
have documented the development of those industries from 1990onwards and outlined a prognosis for growth up to 2020. 13policy recommendations |TARGETS

185demands for the energy sector
Greenpeace and the renewables industry have a clear agenda for
changes which need to be made in energy policy to encourage ashift to renewable sources. The main demands are:
Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy. 
Internalise the external costs (social and environmental) of
energy production through ‘cap and trade’ emissions trading. 
Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming
appliances, buildings and vehicles.
Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and
combined heat and power generation.
Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to
the grid for renewable power generators. 
Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example
through feed-in tariff programmes.
Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to provide
more environmental product information.
Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy
and energy efficiency.
Conventional energy sources receive an estimated $250-300
117
billion in subsidies per year worldwide, resulting in heavily distorted
markets. Subsidies artificially reduce the price of power , keeprenewable energy out of the market place and prop up non-competitive technologies and fuels. Eliminating direct and indirectsubsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power would help move ustowards a level playing field across the energy sector . The 2001report of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force argued that “re-addressing them [subsidies] and making even a minor re-directionof these considerable financial flows toward renewables, provides anopportunity to bring consistency to new public goals and to includesocial and environmental costs in prices.” The Task Forcerecommended that “G8 countries should take steps to removeincentives and other supports for environmentally harmful energytechnologies, and develop and implement market-based mechanismsthat address externalities, enabling renewable energy technologiesto compete in the market on a more equal and fairer basis.”
Renewable energy would not need special provisions if markets were
not distorted by the fact that it is still virtually free for electricityproducers (as well as the energy sector as a whole) to pollute.Subsidies to fully mature and polluting technologies are highlyunproductive. Removing subsidies from conventional electricitywould not only save taxpayers’ money. It would also dramaticallyreduce the need for renewable energy support.
This is a fuller description of what needs to be done to eliminate or
compensate for current distortions in the energy market. removal of energy market distortions A major barrier preventing
renewable energy from reaching its full potential is the lack of pricingstructures in the energy markets that reflect the full costs to society ofproducing energy. For more than a century, power generation wascharacterised by national monopolies with mandates to financeinvestments in new production capacity through state subsidies and/orlevies on electricity bills. As many countries are moving in thedirection of more liberalised electricity markets, these options are nolonger available, which puts new generating technologies, such as windpower , at a competitive disadvantage relative to existing technologies.This situation requires a number of responses.
internalisation of the social and environmental costs ofpolluting energy
The real cost of energy production by conventional
energy includes expenses absorbed by society, such as health impactsand local and regional environmental degradation - from mercurypollution to acid rain – as well as the global negative impacts fromclimate change. Hidden costs include the waiving of nu clear accident
insurance that is too expensive to be covered by the nuclear powerplant operators. The Price Anderson Act, for instance, limits theliability of US nuclear power plants in the case of an accident to anamount of up to $ 98 million per plant, and only $15 million per yearper plant, with the rest being drawn from an industry fund of up to $10 billion. After that the taxpayer becomes responsible
118. 
Environmental damage should, as a priority, be rectified at source.
Translated into energy generation that would mean that, ideally,production of energy should not pollute and it is the energyproducers’ responsibility to prevent it. If they do pollute they shouldpay an amount equal to the damage the production causes tosociety as a whole. The environmental impacts of electricitygeneration can be difficult to quantify, however . How do we put aprice on lost homes on Pacific Islands as a result of melting icecapsor on deteriorating health and human lives?
An ambitious project, funded by the European Commission - ExternE
– has tried to quantify the true costs, including the environmentalcosts, of electricity generation. It estimates that the cost of producingelectricity from coal or oil would double and that from gas wouldincrease by 30% if external costs, in the form of damage to theenvironment and health, were taken into account. If thoseenvironmental costs were levied on electricity generation according totheir impact, many renewable energy sources would not need anysupport. If, at the same time, direct and indirect subsidies to fossilfuels and nuclear power were removed, the need to support renewableelectricity generation would seriously diminish or cease to exist.
introduce the “polluter pays" principle As with the other
subsidies, external costs must be factored into energy pricing if themarket is to be truly competitive. This requires that governmentsapply a “polluter pays” system that charges the emittersaccordingly, or applies suitable compensation to non-emitters.Adoption of polluter pays taxation to electricity sources, orequivalent compensation to renewable energy sources, and exclusionof renewables from environment-related energy taxation, is essentialto achieve fairer competition in the world’s electricity markets. 13policy recommendations |TARGETS

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
electricity market reform Renewable energy technologies could
already be competitive if they had received the same attention asother sources in terms of R&D funding and subsidies, and if externalcosts were reflected in power prices. Essential reforms in theelectricity sector are necessary if new renewable energy technologiesare to be accepted on a larger scale. These reforms include: 
removal of electricity sector barriers Complex licensing
procedures and bureaucratic hurdles constitute one of the mostdifficult obstacles faced by renewable energy projects in manycountries. A clear timetable for approving projects should be set forall administrations at all levels. Priority should be given torenewable energy projects. Governments should propose moredetailed procedural guidelines to strengthen the existing legislationand at the same time streamline the licensing procedure forrenewable energy projects.
A major barrier is the short to medium term surplus of electricity
generating capacity in many OECD countries. Due to over-capacity itis still cheaper to burn more coal or gas in an existing power plantthan to build, finance and depreciate a new renewable power plant.The effect is that, even in those situations where a new technologywould be fully competitive with new coal or gas fired power plants,the investment will not be made. Until we reach a situation whereelectricity prices start reflecting the cost of investing in new capacityrather than the marginal cost of existing capacity, support forrenewables will still be required to level the playing field. 
Other barriers include the lack of long term planning at national,
regional and local level; lack of integrated resource planning; lackof integrated grid planning and management; lack of predictabilityand stability in the markets; no legal framework for internationalbodies of water; grid ownership by vertically integrated companiesand a lack of long-term R&D funding. 
There is also a complete absence of grids for large scale renewable
energy sources, such as offshore wind power or concentrating solarpower (CSP) plants; weak or non-existant grids onshore; littlerecognition of the economic benefits of embedded/distributedgeneration; and discriminatory requirements from utilities for gridaccess that do not reflect the nature of the renewable technology. 
The reforms needed to address market barriers to renewables include:
Streamlined and uniform planning procedures and p ermitting
systems and integrated least cost network planning.
Fair access to the grid at fair , transparent prices and removal of
discriminatory access and transmission tariffs.
Fair and transparent pricing for power throughout a network, with
recognition and remuneration for the benefits of embedded generation.
Unbundling of utilities into separate generation 
and distribution companies.
The costs of grid infrastructure development and reinforcement
must be carried by the grid management authority rather thanindividual renewable energy projects.
Disclosure of fuel mix and environmental impact to end users to
enable consumers to make an informed choice of power source.priority grid access Rules on grid access, transmission and cost
sharing are very often inadequate. Legislation must be clear ,especially concerning cost distribution and transmission fees.Renewable energy generators should be guaranteed priority access.Where necessary, grid extension or reinforcement costs should beborne by the grid operators, and shared between all consumers,because the environmental benefits of renewables are a public goodand system operation is a natural monopoly. 
support mechanisms for renewables The following section
provides an overview of the existing support mechanisms andexperiences of their operation. Support mechanisms remain asecond best solution for correcting market failures in the electricitysector . However , introducing them is a practical political solution toacknowledge that, in the short term, there are no other practicalways to apply the polluter pays principle. 
Overall, there are two types of incentive to promote deployment of
renewable energy. These are 
Fixed Price Systems where the
government dictates the electricity price (or premium) paid to theproducer and lets the market det ermine the quantity, and
Renewable Quota Systems (in the USA referred to as Renewable
Portfolio Standards) where the government dictates the quantity ofrenewable electricity and leaves it to the market to det ermine the
price. Both systems create a protected market against abackground of subsidised, depreciated conventional generatorswhose external environmental costs are not accounted for . Their aimis to provide incentives for technology improvements and costreductions, leading to cheaper renewables that can compete withconventional sources in the future. 
The main difference between quota based and price based systems
is that the former aims to introduce competition between electricityproducers. However , competition between technologymanufacturers, which is the most crucial factor in bringing downelectricity production costs, is present regardless of whethergovernment dictates prices or quantities. Prices paid to wind powerproducers are currently higher in many European quota basedsystems (UK, Belgium, Italy) than in fixed price or premiumsystems (Germany, Spain, Denmark). 

fixed price systems Fixed price systems include investment
subsidies, fixed feed-in tariffs, fixed premium systems and tax credits.
Investment subsidies are capital payments usually made on the
basis of the rated power (in kW) of the generator . It is generallyacknowledged, however , that systems which base the amount ofsupport on generator size rather than electricity output can leadto less efficient technology development. There is therefore aglobal trend away from these payments, although they can beeffective when combined with other incentives. 
Fixed feed-in tariffs (FITs), widely adopted in Europe, have
proved extremely successful in expanding wind energy inGermany, Spain and Denmark. Operators are paid a fixed pricefor every kWh of electricity they feed into the grid. In Germanythe price paid varies according to the relative maturity of theparticular technology and reduces each year to reflect fallingcosts. The additional cost of the system is borne by taxpayers orelectricity consumers.13policy recommendations |TARGETS


187The main benefit of a FIT is that it is administratively simple and
encourages better planning. Although the FIT is not associatedwith a formal Power Purchase Agreement, distribution companiesare usually obliged to purchase all the production from renewableinstallations. Germany has reduced the political risk of the systembeing changed by guaranteeing payments for 20 years. The mainproblem associated with a fixed price system is that it does notlend itself easily to adjustment – whether up or down - to reflectchanges in the production costs of renewable technologies. 
Fixed premium systems , sometimes called an “environmental
bonus” mechanism, operate by adding a fixed premium to thebasic wholesale electricity price. From an investor perspective,the total price received per kWh is less predictable than under afeed-in tariff because it depends on a constantly changingelectricity price. From a market perspective, however , it is arguedthat a fixed premium is easier to integrate into the overallelectricity market because those involved will be reacting tomarket price signals. Spain is the most prominent country tohave adopted a fixed premium system.
Tax credits, as operated in the US and Canada, offer a credit
against tax payments for every kWh produced. In the UnitedStates the market has been driven by a federal Production TaxCredit (PTC) of approximately 1.8 cents per kWh. It is adjustedannually for inflation.

renewable quota systems Two types of renewable quota systems
have been employed - tendering systems and green certificate systems. 
Tendering systems involve competitive bidding for contracts to
construct and operate a particular project, or a fixed quantity ofrenewable capacity in a country or state. Although other factorsare usually taken into account, the lowest priced bid invariablywins. This system has been used to promote wind power inIreland, France, the UK, Denmark and China. 
The downside is that investors can bid an uneconomically low
price in order to win the contract, and then not build the project.Under the UK’s NFFO (Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation) tendersystem, for example, many contracts remained unused. It waseventually abandoned. If properly designed, however , with longcontracts, a clear link to planning consent and a possible minimumprice, tendering for large scale projects could be effective, as it hasbeen for offshore oil and gas extraction in Europe’s North Sea.Tradable green certificate (TGC) systems operate by offering
“green certificates” for every kWh generated by a renewableproducer . The value of these certificates, which can be traded on amarket, is then added to the value of the basic electricity. A greencertificate system usually operates in combination with a risingquota of renewable electricity generation. Power companies arebound by law to purchase an increasing proportion of renewablesinput. Countries which have adopted this system include the UK,Sweden and Italy in Europe and many individual states in theUS, where it is known as a Renewable Portfolio Standard. 
Compared with a fixed tender price, the TGC model is more risky
for the investor , because the price fluctuates on a daily basis,unless effective markets for long-term certificate (and electricity)contracts are developed. Such markets do not currently exist. Thesystem is also more complex than other payment mechanisms. 
Which one out of this range of incentive systems works best?
Based on past experience it is clear that policies based on fixedtariffs and premiums can be designed to work effectively.However , introducing them is not a guarantee for success. Almostall countries with experience in mechanisms to supportrenewables have, at some point in time, used feed-in tariffs, butnot all have contributed to an increase in renewable electricityproduction. It is the design of a mechanism, in combination withother measures, which determines its su ccess. 
renewables for heating and cooling Largely forgotten, but
equally important, is the heating and cooling sector . In manyregions of the world, such as Europe, nearly half of the total energydemand is for heating/cooling, a demand which can be addressedeasily at competitive prices.
Policies should make sure that specific targets and appropriate
measures for renewable heating and cooling are part of anynational renewables strategy. These should foresee a coherent set ofmeasures dedicated to the promotion of renewables for heating andcooling, including financial incentives, awareness raising campaigns,training of installers, architects and heating engineers, anddemonstration projects. For new buildings, and those undergoingmajor renovation, an obligation to cover a minimum share of heatconsumption by renewables should be introduced, as alreadyimplemented in some countries and regions. 
Measures should stimulate the deployment of the large potential
for cost effective renewable heating and cooling, available alreadywith today’s technologies. At the same time, increased R&D effortsshould be undertaken, particularly in the fields of heat storage andrenewable cooling.13policy recommendations |TARGETS
