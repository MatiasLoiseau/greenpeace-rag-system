BRIEFING

European and U.S. Energy Companies are
Responsible for Nearly USD 100 Billion to
Putin’s War Chest Since Crimea Invasion

MARCH 2022

Revenues from oil and gas projects backed by
European and U.S. companies have fueled Vladimir
Putin’s regime to the tune of nearly USD 100
billion since 2014. While the Russian government
has benefited from majority state-owned or
state-controlled oil companies such as Gazprom
and Rosneft, European and U.S.-based
corporations have also spearheaded large oil and
gas projects that filled Putin’s coffers. These oil
majors have long sought access to Russia’s vast
hydrocarbon reserves, and in many cases brought
the technological and operational expertise
needed to realize projects.

Oil and gas company investments have taken the
form of both equity holdings, such as BP’s stake in
Rosneft, and joint ventures such as ExxonMobil’s
operation of the Sakhalin-1 project.  Since Russia
invaded Ukraine in February 2022, oil and gas
companies have faced pressure to disassociate
with Russian producers, but recent divestments do
not change their long history of support for Putin’s
regime.

Table 1 shows the estimated revenues from oil
projects backed by major European and American
oil and gas companies to the Russian government
from 2014, the year Putin sent troops into
Crimea, through 2021.  This 2014 invasion was

widely condemned as a violation of international
law and should have prompted these companies to

reconsider their role in financing a military accused
of such violations. All payments found in this
briefing are taken from Rystad Energy’s UCube
economic model. A more detailed accounting could
shed more light on the economics of these Russian
oil projects, but such a study would be hindered by
a lack of transparency.  3

The first column of Table 1 shows estimated direct
payments to the Russian government due to
upstream oil and gas projects located in Russia, as
attributed by the company’s proportional share in
those projects. The second column shows
estimated payments to the Russian government by
Russian companies who have European minority
owners, attributed by the minority company’s
equity share. For example, Rosneft (of which BP
owns a 22% stake) and Novatek (of which
TotalEnergies owns a 19.4% stake). These
estimates may differ from actual payments made
by an individual company to the Russian
government for a variety of reasons, but they
provide an estimate of U.S. and European oil
company support for the Russian government
during this time period.

BP stands out because of its share of the $353
billion estimated government take from Rosneft
during this time period. In the early 2000s, BP had

a minority interest in BP-TNK, which was sold to
Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft in  4
2013, leaving BP with a 19.75% share of Rosneft
stock.  This share rose to over 22% in 2020 due
to Rosneft share buybacks, although BP maintains
its voting share at 19.75%.  BP also nominated
two members to sit on Rosneft’s board.  7

BP’s share of Rosneft’s oil and gas production, as
reported in its 2020 annual report, accounts for
30% of BP’s total 2020 oil and gas production.  8
BP's accounting method for its stake in Rosneft
allows BP to report a share of Rosneft's oil and gas
production, and revenues and profits (or loss) as
part of BP's income statement.  9

In this briefing, we have reported BP’s and
TotalEnergies’ share of the royalties and taxes paid
by the Russian companies, proportional to their
equity stakes. In response to the findings of this
briefing, BP stated that it does not consider itself
as being responsible for any share of Rosneft’s
payments to the Russian government.
we included these values to provide greater
transparency and a full accounting of these
companies’ activities in Russia on the principle that
a company’s responsibilities are proportional to its
share in the companies it owns stakes in, in the
same way that the benefits it enjoys are.

 BP uses the equity-accounting technique to report the ﬁnancial ﬂows from Rosneft. It is a method used to attribute the proportional share of the
9
investee company’s (Rosneft) ﬁnancial metrics to the investor company (BP).

 When asked for comment on these ﬁndings by Global Witness, BP disputed the ﬁndings in relation to attributing a share of Rosneft’s payments to the
10
Russian government to the company. It stated that “we simply do not recognise the numbers you cite or, indeed, any suggestion that bp was somehow
“responsible for paying” Russia “an estimated $78.4” billion since 2014”.

Although BP has announced it will divest its stake
in Rosneft, the past impact of this equity stake
cannot be negated — both in terms of the benefit
to Rosneft from the capital provided, and the cash
flowing as a result to the Russian state.

affordable. We cannot trust the oil and gas
industry — responsible not only for the climate
crisis, but also conflict, displacement, and human
suffering around the world — to be part of the
solution to climate change.

In total, these eight companies — BP, Shell,
Wintershall Dea, ExxonMobil, TotalEnergies,
Equinor, OMV, and Trafigura — are responsible
for over USD 95 billion to the Russian
government via their stakes in Russian oil and
gas projects and companies since 2014, with
BP responsible for 80% of this total.

Ultimately, the fact that Russia’s decision to invade
Ukraine was able to send global oil and gas
markets spiraling is yet another reason to speed up
the transition to clean energy sources like wind
and solar, which are far more stable and

Rather than aid the transition to cleaner and more
stable energy, U.S. and European oil majors have
spent the past decade financing Putin’s regime. Oil
majors must not be celebrated for succumbing to
political and financial pressure to sell and abandon
assets financing an autocratic, expansionist
regime, when they held those assets and made
tens of billions of dollars doing so, from Putin’s
first annexation of Crimea and Donbas right up
until after Russia finally invaded Ukraine in a full-
scale invasion.

Methodology: We use the Rystad Energy Ucube database to query the production and economics of the upstream oil and gas
industry. Upstream refers to the exploration and extraction of oil and gas. Payments to the government, labeled Government Take in
the database, include royalties, government proﬁt oil, export duties, bonuses, income taxes, and other taxes and fees. The ﬁgures
include payments derived from minority interest shares in Russian companies as well as those from assets directly owned by these
companies.
