FINDING: FAILURE TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC RISKS

FINDING: FAILURE TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC RISKS

DOW FACILITY IN FREEPORT
The Texas Operations facility in Freeport, TX is Dow’s
largest chemical manufacturing site and one of the
largest in the world. The three major complexes —
Plant A, Plant B and Oyster Creek —span more than
5,000 acres and contain 65 production plants that
manufacture 32 billion pounds of products each year.
Half of the products manufactured at these sites use
chlorine somewhere in the process. Both chlorine
and phosgene could be made and used with a
just-in-time process that would eliminate the
need for the bulk storage and transport in rail
cars, which make this facility high-risk. The
worst-case scenario reported by Dow to the EPA
is the potential release of 23,000 lbs phosgene,
but the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) warned in a Federal Register notice that
a terrorist attack, “may involve effects that are
more severe than expected with accidental risk.”

According to Dow’s own reports to the
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Risk
Management Program, its Texas Operations in
Freeport, TX puts 130,000 people at risk due to
the bulk use and storage of phosgene gas, a
compound used as a chemical weapon in World
War I. The facility also has up to 7.6 million lbs of
chlorine gas on site that could endanger a similar
or larger population in the case of a catastrophic
release. It is clear that this Dow facility has failed to
take advantage of safer available chemical processes
that would prevent a catastrophic release of phosgene
or chlorine gas resulting from a terrorist attack or
accidental release.
UNNECESSARY RISKS
These risks existed long before September 11, 2001,
and no amount of fences, security cameras, or guards
can fully secure a facility that has an inherent risk of a
catastrophic release of a lethal gas.

Dow is well aware of safer chemical processes that
would reduce or eliminate these risks, considering that
more than 284 chemical facilities have converted since
1999. In 2008, Dow announced a partnership with
K2 Pure Solutions (k2pure.com) to use a safer
just-in-time process to manufacture chlorine
on site at its Pittsburgh, CA plant. This process
eliminates the risks inherent in shipping or storing large
quantities of chlorine. In November of 2009, Clorox
announced it will be converting all of its U.S. facilities
that use chlorine gas to safer processes.

Accidents happen all too frequently, as was the case
with the fatal explosion in 2005 at the BP reﬁnery in
Texas City, TX that killed 15 workers; a costly reminder
of the catastrophic risks inherent in many chemical
processes.

Greenpeace urged Dow to switch to safer
chemical processes and break from this
lobby by joining other businesses, such as
the railroads, in supporting legislation that
would prevent disasters. On July 28th, the
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental
Accountability Committee considered H.R.
2868. It was substituted with an amendment
preserving the current law, and lauded by
the chemical industry. If made law, this policy
would handcuff the government’s ability to
set standards until 2013.

Last year, Dow provided Greenpeace
legislative language showing that Dow
could support a policy requiring safer
chemical processes. Instead, Dow is
now leading industry trade groups
supporting policy that continues to
handcuff the DHS from requiring the use
of safer chemical processes that will
protect our communities from chemical
catastrophes.

The only sure way to safeguard employees
and surrounding communities from accidents
or terrorism at high-risk chemical plants is
through prevention. In this regard, Dow has
failed to secure its Texas Operations
against catastrophic accidents or
terrorism. Compounding this failure at
the plant level, Dow has backed away
from supporting a policy in Congress that
would eliminate these catastrophic risks
at the highest risk chemical facilities.

SECURITY INSPECTIONS
The DHS began to inspect “high risk”
chemical plants this year. However, they
testiﬁed at a March 3rd Senate hearing that
they will inspect fewer than ﬁve percent of
all 4,997 high-risk plants by the end of 2010.
The DHS will also not conﬁrm which plants
they will inspect or whether those plants are
violating any rules. Under current law, the
DHS is barred from requiring the use of safer
chemical processes that would eliminate
potentially fatal consequences of a terrorist
attack or accident.

The Dow Freeport facility has only addressed
security concerns with conventional methods
such as guards, gates, and security cameras,
but these measures are unlikely to stop a
potential terrorist attack. In June of 2007,
DuPont CEO Charles O. Holliday commented
on security saying, “I feel very comfortable
that we’ve taken all the reasonable steps,
but obviously if someone wants to ﬂy
an airplane into a plant, it’s very hard
to guard against it.” Sen. Joe Lieberman,
chair of the Senate Homeland Security and
Government Affairs Committee, has said that
using safer chemical processes is “the
only fool-proof way to defeat a terrorist
determined to strike a chemical facility.”

There are several security gaps under current
law, but these loopholes would be closed
if permanent legislation (H.R. 2868) passed
by the U.S. House of Representatives last
November is enacted this fall. Dow is a
member of lobbying groups, such as the
Society of Chemical Manufacturers and
Afﬁliates, American Petroleum Institute,
and the American Chemistry Council,
which lobbied against H.R. 2868 as well
as complementary legislation in the
Senate. In a March 27, 2009 letter to Dow’s
CEO Andrew Liveris about the potential
catastrophic liability that Dow’s plants pose,

Dow's Texas Operations consists of three
complexes that span across 5,000 acres in
Freeport, TX.

All three complexes house large quanitites
of chlorine. Plant A also houses 140,000 lbs
of phosgene - a chemical weapon used in
World War I. The shaded area represents a
25-mile radius and is the area that could be
affected in the event of a phosgene leak,
according to Dow's reports to the EPA.

This photo shows the Plant B complex, the largest
of the three complexes at Dow’s Texas Operations.
The complex houses at least 26 different facilities
that contain dangerous chemicals, including 3.7
million lbs of chlorine, 290,000 lbs of sulfur dioxide,
and 44,000 lbs of phosgene – which are all toxic
inhalation hazards.

The photo shows the Plant A complex, which
houses large chlorine and phosgene facilities. In
total, this complex could contain nearly 4 million
lbs of chlorine and 140,000 lbs of phosgene in
pipelines, railcars, or other containers.

This photo shows the Oyster Creek complex,
which houses multiple chlorine facilities. Chlorine
is manufactured here and used to produce precur-
sors to PVC and other products.

This photo shows a chlorine liquefaction facility
at Dow Chemical Company’s Texas Operations
facility in Freeport, TX on Aug 24, 2010. Chlorine is
a lethal gas and this facility can contain 3,800,000
lbs chlorine gas. This facility is inherently danger-
ous due to its storage of large amounts of toxic
gas. Dow could use safer alternatives that would
eliminate the need for bulk storage of chlorine and
other toxic gases.

This photo shows the PMDI (polymeric methylene
diphenyl diisocyante) plant at Dow Chemical Com-
pany’s Texas Operations facility in Freeport, TX on
Aug 24, 2010. The worst case scenario reported
to the EPA is a catastrophic release of 23,000 lbs
of phosgene. This facility has up to 140,000 lbs of
phosgene on site and is inherently dangerous due
to its storage of large amounts of toxic gas.

Rail cars like these are used to ship toxic gases
around the facility and to other locations. A toxic
gas like chlorine or phosgene released from just
one of these rail cars could spread up to 25 miles,
killing or injuring those who breathe it in.
