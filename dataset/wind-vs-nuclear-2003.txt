Wind vs N uclear  2003
A report  commissi oned by Gre enpeace France

Dec. 4th 2003
About the Report
Greenpeace France has com missi oned a report with the French research institute
DET ENTE  to help i nform the discussion on the  European Pressurized Re actor. The
main authors are Antoin e Bondu elle and Mathias Lefère. The full  version of th e report
is onl y available in F rench at http://www. greenpeace.fr 
Intro duction
Plans being promoted by the French Industry Minister, Fontaine, are currently being
considered by the French government. The so-called European  Pressurized Reactor (EPR)  - a
ten-year o ld Framatome /Siemens design - wou ld offic ially cos t some 3.5 billion € and begin
producing electricity as early as 2010 . In the Min ister's view, the 59th  French reactor would
not be need ed to match  a growin g electricity demand at a competitive price, but to « to have
at our dispo sition a maximum  of energ y options which will enable  us to decide wheth er or
not to replace the nuclear park  entirely or partly at the time  horiz on of 2020 -  2025 1.»
The Government  was widely believed  to planning to support the Min ister's proposal but ma y
delay a decision until after the 'Energy Debate' in the French Assembl ée next  March, as
concerns have been raised about  the EPR’s  economi cs.
To help  inform this discussion, Greenpeace France has commissioned a report from  the
French research institute DETENT E compar ing the EPR op tion with  wind energy. If instead
of investing in  an EPR, the Fren ch utility EdF would instead invest as much money in wind
generation, how mu ch electricity will then be produce d and how  many jobs will be created?
In recent years  wind po wer has gone through an  industrial and techno logical revolut ion. In
Germany , some 13,500 MW  are now  operational, of which 3,200 MW have been installed last
year alone, the equival ent of the consumpti on of more than  2 milli on househo lds. Franc e is
lagging far behind with only 220MW  installed today. At a Europe an level, the European
Wind Energ y Association (EWEA)  is cauti ously estimating that the installed wind  capac ity
by 2010 wil l be 75,000MW2, tripling the  current installed capacity and adding th e equivalent
electricity produc tion of some  14 large nuclear reactors or more  than  2 reactors every year. In
reality, wind has already taken the lead and left nuclear far behind.

Meanwh ile, nucle ar power  has been at a standstill or even in decline retreat in the Europea n
Union.  No single  reactor has been  connected to the grid in the last 4 years. In reality, it will
take at least another 10 years before a new reactor could come  on line, while  a growing
number of old reactors will be permanently shut down.
The aim of the repo rt is not to present a compreh ensive energy scenario, but to clarify the
econo mic and soci al impacts of a key energ y choice about  to be made  by the French
government: either to add a 59th nuclear reactor to the nuclear overcapacity or to launch a
renewable energ y sector. The latter would be supported by 85%  the French clients of EdF3.
Methodo logy
The report compar es the job creation and electricity production of 2 energy options: a new
EPR or  wind  power:  
1.The repor t first calculates the cost of a new EPR , based on fig ures
from the French  nuclear industry and French  official references. It
then estimates the amount of electricity (TWh) that would  be
produced over its lifetime.
2.Calculates at an equal investmen t base  as 1 EPR, how many  wind
turbines could be installed, and how much electricity would be
produced. Interest rates are assumed  to be identical.
3.Compares the electricity product ion of the EPR and wind options
4.Estimates and com pares the job creation for both options
A sensitivity stud y, compar ing nucl ear and wind option under  4 scenario's:
1. DETENTE scenario, or central scen ario: based on the  construction of
1 EPR 'demonstration' reactor'
2. EoP-H scenario: lower costs nuclear – higher costs wind
3. EoP-B scenario: higher costs nuclear – lower costs wind
4. 1+4 EPR scenario: wher e 5 EPRs are constructed inste ad of 1, based
on the central scenario
The 4 scen ario's are descr ibed in more detail in the annex. It should  be noted  that the capital
base in the 4 scenario's is different, as based  on the investmen t in the nuclear capacity.
A conservative estimation of costs, in favor of nuclear
DETE NTE has preferred to use figures from  the French nuclear indust ry and French official
references (government,  parliament) in orde r to give the repor t more relevance to the
forthcoming  French  Ener gy Deba te. Howe ver, DETENT E questions the credibility and
correctness of these figures, which in general favor the nuclear option  by under -estimating
nuclear costs and over-estimating costs related to wind  power. 
3 The most recent opinion polls have been summarized in the annex of the full report (only available
in French)

Main Results
The DETENTE scenario or central scenario, is based on the mos t 'balan ced' figure s from the
French nuclear industry and official references. Comparing the cons truction of 1 EPR with  a
wind project of an ident ical investment, gives a much higher job creation and electricity
production in the  wind optio n. This is shown  in graph 1 a nd gr aph 2
Electricity produ ction
Figure 1: annual elect ricity generation – DETENTE scenario: (nuclear: red ;   total wi nd:
yellow ; offshore wi nd: blue)
A wind pro gramme  generates 2.3 times  more electricity at its full deployment than an EPR.
In electricity terms : 24 TWh / year for wind instead of 10 T Wh / year for  EPR.
This annual production is not iden tical to the actualized produc tion which is used in the
econo mic calculations of this study. Produ ction early in the studied time frame  are favored by
the actualization. The actualized wind produc tion is thus  'only' 52%  higher (111  TWh wind  –
compared to 73 TWh nucl ear over their lifetime), wher eas the annual  wind production – once
fully deplo yed – is 2.3 times higher than the nuclear produ ction.
In the wind pro gramme, the increase in capacity is more smooth  than in the nuclear option,
which  would  be an advantage in the French  cont ext of large generation overcapacity. Th e
need for new capacity will indee d be large from 20 30 onwards . The startup of an EPR as
early as 2012 will thus  be more of a com mercial handic ap to EdF.

Generated Employment
Figure 2: job cr eation in m an-years – DETENTE scenari o: (nuclea r:red ; total  wind: yello w ;
offshore wind: blue)
The results in terms of employment  are spectacular. In the EPR option, the construction
generates up to 8000 tempor ary jobs4 with a peak shortly in advance of the entry into
operation of the reactor in 2012. B ut after startup, emplo yment takes  a steep dive. In the wind
optio n, construction is more evenl y spread over time and emplo yment takes  the lead over
nuclear.
But above all, the perman ent employmen t in the nucl ear sector – either in the maintenance
and the  operation of the reactor – remain s very limit ed, even if ratios favorable to nuclear are
applied5.
In the EPR case, refurbishmen t creates tempor arily increases in employment.  In the wind
case, the decrease in employment after 2030 correspond s to the choice of this scenario not to
construct new turbines after this date.
The distribution of the creation of employmen t in time is different in the 2 cases. A
comparison of man- years of employment is howeve r possible. It correspond s more or less to
the surface under  the graphs  pres ented above.
Job creation could be valued  more by decis ion-ma kers if it arises earlier in time. This is
presented by actualizing the job creation, using  a rate of 8% as used by the Fren ch publi c
services6.
4 This figure is higher than the 5000 used  by the industry. Quoted  from 'Le Point' July 27th 2003  
5 The ratios of permanent employment in the nucle ar sector are taken from SFEN (Société Française d’Energie
Nucl éaire), and  are clearly favoring the nuclear optio n  
6 As part of the sensitivity study, a rate of 3% has been applied, which gives an even more favorable
result for wind power.

Over a time frame of 60 y ears – the official lifetime of the EPR – the number of man-years
generated by the wind option is nearly 5 times higher.  If emplo yment is actualized, reflecting
the political preference for early job creation, the ratio is still a factor 2 higher for wind.   The
wind option  thus show s major socia l bene fits.
Sensiti vity study
Starting from the 'central' DETENTE scenario, 3 other scenario's are developed, which  are
presented in more  deta il in the annex.
It is remarkable  that in every scenario, the annual produc tion by wind  energy is by far larger
at its full deplo yment.  Even in the case where 5 EPRs  are const ructed – a case considered as
unrealistic given the  large nucl ear overca pacity in Fran ce – wind still generates 30%  more
electricity (65 TWh/y instead of 50 TWh/y for the EPR) at an equal capital base.
The wind option has large social advantages with  a job creation which surp asses the nucl ear
optio n in every scenario.  Even in the 1+4 scenario, nearly 3 times  as much j obs are created
by wind (if  actualized, the ratio remains 1.6 tim es higher).
Conclusion s
Based on fig ures from  the nuclear industry and Fren ch official references which in general
favor nuclear energy, the report «Wind vs Nuclear 2003» demo nstrates that a clear choice for
wind power  instead of a new EPR would  offer  France major social and economi c benefits. At
an equa l investment, wind  power generates 5 times more jobs and 2.3 times more electricity
than nuclear. Even in  an extreme scenario with low costs  for nucl ear and high costs for wind,
wind remai ns the best option.
In the context of the Fren ch 'Ener gy Debate', the French  Parliament should  carefully and
critically evaluate the socio-economi c consequences of the proposal of the Fren ch Industry
Minister to construct the EPR.
