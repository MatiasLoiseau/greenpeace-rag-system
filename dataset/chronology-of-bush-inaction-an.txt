 Chronology of Legislation on Chemical Security 
July 25, 2002:   The Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Com mittee unanimously adopts a 
compromise version of Senator Jon Corzine’s (D-NJ) bill (S. 1602) to require safer technologies or 
chemicals where available to prevent catastrophic a ttacks. 
October 23, 2003:   The Senate EPW Committee adopts a flawed bill (S.  994) on a party-line vote.  The 
bill has no enforceable provision to prevent catast rophic attacks by requiring safer technologies or 
chemicals and rubber stamps industry’s voluntary pr ograms and never makes it to the floor. 
May 19, 2006:   Senator Inhofe (R-OK), chair of the EPW Committee , schedules a vote for May 23rd on 
his wastewater security  bill (S. 2781) but rejecte d an amendment supported by Senators Jeffords (D-VT ), 
Boxer (D-CA), Obama (D-IL) and Lautenberg (D-NJ)  w hich would have provided funding to convert 
publicly owned water facilities for hazardous chlor ine gas to safer chemical processes as recommended 
by the Government Accountability Office. 
June 14-15 2006:   Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  (HSGA) Committee votes out 
weak chemical security legislation (S. 2145).  Sena tor Voinovich (R-OH) proposes 14 weakening 
amendments.  A Voinovich amendment to preempt state s is rejected by a 9 to 7 vote.  A Lieberman (D- 
CT) amendment to add cost-effective safer technolog y requirements is rejected 11 to 5. 
July 28, 2006:   House Homeland Security (HS) Committee completes mark up of H.R. 5695.  The 
Committee embraces a compromise requiring the use o f safer technologies at high priority facilities 
offered by Representative Markey (D-MA). 
September 25, 2006:   In a rush to show voters they have done “somethin g”  the Conference Committee 
on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Approp riations approved  a 744 word unenforceable 3 
year chemical security amendment supported by the c hemical industry. 
March 6, 2008:   House HS Committee adopts H.R. 5577 which require s high risk facilities to use safer 
more secure technologies as long as they are feasib le, cost effective and do not shift risks to other 
facilities. 
June 23, 2009:  House HSC Committee rejects the most crippling ame ndments but adopts four 
weakening amendments to H.R. 2868. 
October 21, 2009:  House Energy & Commerce (E&C)Committee rejects cri ppling amendments and 
adopts a stronger version of H.R. 2868 on chemical plant security and also adopts H.R. 3258 on drinkin g 
water plant security.  Both bills conditionally req uire the use of safer chemical processes at the hig hest 
risk plants where feasible and cost-effective. 
November 6, 2009:   In a vote of 230 to 193, the House of Representat ives passed a compromise bill, the 
Chemical and Water Security Act (H.R. 2868), which conditionally requires the use of safer chemical 
processes at some of the highest risk facilities wh ere feasible and cost-effective.  The bill also put s the 
EPA in charge similar regulations over publicly own ed water treatment facilities. 
July 28, 2010:  Senate HSGA Committee substitutes Senator Collins (R-ME) three year extension of the 
interim 2006 statute (CFATS) for the House passed b ill (H.R. 2868) offered by Chairman Lieberman (I- 
CT).
