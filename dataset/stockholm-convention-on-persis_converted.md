EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The present paper is intended as an analysis and guide to assist countries with implementation
of the  POPs  treaty,  and  the  development  of  legislation  to  address  all  hazardous  substances.
The  paper  provides  reference  information  for  the  treaty  (title  and  adoption),  followed  by  a
section  on  the  process  for  the  treaty’s  entry  into  legal  force.  Section  III  addresses  the  POPs
treaty  in  the  context  of  recent  developments  in  international  policy  and  law  in  the  field  of
hazardous wastes and chemicals. Section IV covers selected key  POPs treaty provisions that
warrant special attention when adopting implementing legislation, Section V covers the basic
treaty structure, and is followed by Section VI which provides an article-by-article analysis of
the specific treaty provisions.

In general terms, the POPs treaty is a treaty based on eliminating and phasing out  POPs. The
principle of avoidance and substitution is the priority measure within the treaty for achieving
this goal, both for intentional and unintentional  POPs.  A  key  aspect  of  this  is  confining  the
problem  by  ensuring  no  new  chemicals  with  POPs  properties  are  produced,  and  no  new
facilities that generate and release unintentional  POPs  are  sited.  Once  the  problem  has  been
confined, the focus is to phase out current POPs and POPs’ sources through substitution.

Understanding  the  context  of  recent  developments  relating  to  hazardous  wastes  and
chemicals presents an opportunity to utilise the POPs treaty implementing process to advance
legislation addressing all hazardous substances. Specific recommendations include:

1.)  Adopt/improve  a  prevention  and  phase-out  legislative  regime  for  all  hazardous
substances, not only  POPs  since  this  is  necessary  to  protect  the  near  field  environment
and human health (community, national level), and it is the inevitable direction anyway,
already required under a number of international regimes;

2.)  Define  hazardous  substances  as  those  substances  that  are  toxic,  or  persistent  and
bioaccumulative,  or  substances  giving  rise  to  similar  concerns  (e.g.,  known  to  be  or
suspected  of  being  endocrine  disrupting  chemicals).  The  inherent  properties  of  a
chemical (e.g., persistent, toxic or  bioaccumulative)  should  define  the  basis  for  action,
rather  than  the  risk  assessment  approach  that  has  failed  to  adequately  address  the
chemical crisis.

3.)  Give  special  attention  and  consideration  to  the  following  selected  provisions  when

adopting implementing legislation:

1

•  NO  NEW  POPS:  Prohibition  of  new  chemicals  that  have  POPs  (hazardous)

properties thereby confining the problem from increasing;

•  ELIMINATION: Elimination as the goal (prevention and phase-out  programmes  are

the priority, rather than end-of-pipe measures);

•  UNINTENTIONAL  POPs  (DIOXINS)  ELIMINATION:  Priority  to  avoiding  and
preventing  new  facilities  that  yield  unintentional  POPs  by-products  (e.g.,  dioxins),
while  phasing-out  existing  ones.  Chlorine  industry  (chlor-alkali,  and  chlorine  use
industries,  e.g.,  PVC,  chlorine  bleaching,  solvent  production)  should  be  included  in
national dioxin elimination action plans;

•  SUBSTITUTION  PRINCIPLE:  Requiring  the  Substitution  Principle  (substitute
materials, products, and techniques) to prevent formation and release of  POPs as the
priority  for  the  Best  Available  Techniques  (BAT)  requirement  as  the  primary
strategy to implement the goal of elimination;

•  AVOIDING  INCINERATION:  Priority  to  avoiding  and  phasing  out  incineration
through  alternative  waste  management  (phase-out  hazardous  substances,  waste
separation and reuse/recover/recycle non-hazardous substances);

•  STOCKPILES  AND  WASTES:  POPs  stockpiles  and  wastes  must  be  destroyed
pursuant  to  alternative  destruction  technologies  that  do  not  yield  POPs,  rather  than
incineration;

•  PRTR  AND  RIGHT-TO-KNOW:  Pollution  release  and  transfer  registers  (PRTRs)

and right-to-know legislation; and

•  RESOURCES:  Capacity  building  and  financial  assistance  for  developing  countries
and  countries  with  economies  in  transition  to  assist  in  implementation  of  the  POPs
treaty provisions.

I. REFERENCE INFORMATION

The  Official  title  is  the  Stockholm  Convention  on  Persistent  Organic  Pollutants.  The  short
titles include Stockholm Convention, POPs Convention, and POPs treaty. The official date of
adoption is 23 May 2001, adopted in Stockholm, Sweden.

II. ENTRY INTO FORCE

1. The POPs Convention will enter into legal force and thereby become part of international
law  after  the  United  Nations  receive  ratification  by  50  countries  (plus  90  days).  As  with  all
such  treaties,  a  country  becomes  Party  to  the  Convention  and  thereby  legally  bound  by  its
provisions when that country ratifies or otherwise accedes to the treaty and it is in legal force.
Hence, there are no “Parties” until it enters force.

2. The process of entry into force is as follows:

(i)
Adoption of the final draft of the Convention (23 May 2001), and open for signature
on 23 May 2001 in Stockholm, and again at the UN headquarters in New York from 24 may
2001  to  22  May  2002.  A  country  signing  the  treaty  becomes  a  signatory  to  the  treaty  (not  a
Party)  and  thereby  demonstrates  its  political  support  for  the  treaty  and  intention  to  become
Party.  Signatory  countries  signal  their  moral  and  political  commitment  to  the  treaty,  but  are
not legally bound by its provisions. (Article 24)

(ii)
A  signatory  State  then  must  ratify,  accept  or  approve  the  treaty.  (Article  25).  This
usually  requires  the  adoption  by  parliament  (or  similar  body)  of  implementing  national
legislation  in  order  to  transfer  the  international  treaty  provisions  into  national  law.  Once
ratified,  accepted  or  approved,  an  instrument  confirming  ratification  (legal  document)  must
be deposited with the designated treaty depositary (Secretary-General of the United Nations).

(iii)
A  State  that  does  not  sign  during  the  period  open  for  signature  joins  the  treaty  by
“accession”.  Accession  is  the  legal  term  for  joining  the  treaty  after  the  signing  period  has
closed.  Reasons  for  not  signing  could  be  opposition  to  the  treaty,  but  also  could  be  internal
process, administrative delays etc. Just like ratification, acceptance or approval, an instrument
of accession must be deposited with the depositary at the UN.

The  treaty  enters  into  legal  force  90  days  after  the  50th  instrument  of  ratification  or
(iv)
accession is deposited with the UN. At this point all those ratifying and acceding are Parties
and legally bound in addition to being politically and morally bound. (Article 26). Once the
Convention is in legal force, each additional country that deposits its ratification or accession
document with the UN becomes Party (legally bound) 90 days after such deposit.

(v)
Pursuant to Article 27, no reservations are allowed. Reservations are when a country
would exclude itself from parts of the treaty, e.g., one or more provisions when they ratify or
accede.

3

(vi)
Note  that  during  negotiations  and  upon  adoption  of  the  treaty,  the  international
community  agreed  to  begin  implementing  the  treaty  before  it  enters  into  legal  force.  Hence,
countries’  efforts  to  implement  the  treaty  provisions  at  the  national  and  local  level  should
already be underway.

III.  THE  POPS  TREATY  AND  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF
INTERNATIONAL  POLICY  AND  LAW  RELATING  TO  TOXIC
CHEMICALS AND HAZARDOUS WASTES

1. The purpose of this section is to describe the context, or relation of the  POPs  Convention
vis-à-vis other recent significant developments in international policy and law in the field of
toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes. Recognising these relationships presents opportunities
to go beyond the POPs provisions to further develop and improve national legislation during
the process of drafting POPs implementing legislation.

2.  The  world  is  facing  a  chemical  crisis.  Thousands  of  chemicals  are  released  to  the
environment  with  little  or  no  knowledge  about  their  impact  on  the  environment,  including
human  health.  There  is  an  even  greater  lack  of  information  regarding  their  degradation
compounds,  and  the  effects  of  mixing  chemicals  once  released  to  the  environment.
Historically  we  have  allowed  the  chemical  industry  to  play  large-scale  laboratory  with  our
very health and the future of the environment. The result is a “cocktail” of chemicals mixing
and  mobilising  in  the  environment,  affecting  the  life  support  systems  on  which  we  depend.
Babies  born  today,  enter  the  world  with  a  toxic  chemical  burden,  passed  on  from  their
mothers.

3.  Recent  scientific  revelations  indicate  a  host  of  hormone  disrupting  chemicals  (endocrine
disrupting  chemicals)  that  is  causing  untold  damage  in  the  minutest  concentrations.  The
endocrine  disrupting  substances  are  increasingly  associated  with  damage  to  the  developing
fetus, gender determination, the immune system, and human (and other species) development
in general, again, at the most minute levels of concentration.

4.  Hazardous  substances  are  especially  dangerous  because  they  are  invisible,  and  although
they can cause acute damage, they usually cause chronic, slow, incremental destruction such
that  it  is  often  too  late  by  the  time  significant  or  irreversible  damage  is  recognised.  This
hidden, slow  death  to  the planet’s life support systems is at a crisis level, contaminating the
marine  environment,  fresh  water  supplies,  and  threatening  water  security  and  food  security,
and thereby global political security as well.

5.  The  traditional,  outdated  policy  and  legislative  approach,  called  the  assimilative  capacity
approach or permissive approach has contributed to the crisis. This past approach was based
on  attempts  to  control  “permissible”  quantitative  release  levels  of  harmful  substances  under
the erroneous assumption that the receiving environment could dilute and disperse them and
thereby  render  them  harmless.  This  approach  has  failed,  in  particular  with  respect  to
persistent harmful substances. The failure of this outdated and dangerous approach led to the
realisation  that  a  better,  more  protective  paradigm  is  needed  to  adequately  address  the
problem.

4

6. This  realisation gave rise to the adoption of the precautionary principle (sometimes called
the  precautionary  approach  principle,  e.g.,  Principle  15  of  the  Rio  Declaration).  The
precautionary  principle,  now  universally  adopted  at  global,  regional  and  national  level,
consists of four key elements:

(i)
(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

An approach based on preventive action;
Taking  preventive  action  before  waiting  for  conclusive  scientific  proof  regarding
cause and effect between the substance (or activity) and the damage, at which time it
is too late;
Reversal of the burden of proof on to the proponent of a release or activity to
demonstrate that it is unlikely to cause harm, before they may proceed; and
Implementation through clean production substitution (materials, products,
technologies, techniques), e.g., as advocated by the UNEP Governing Council in 1990

7. Indeed, it is common sense to realise that we can not continue to release persistent harmful
substances to the environment, without expecting significant and irreversible harm. Common
sense alone should dictate an approach based on the prevention and phase out of substances
that  are  toxic;  substances  that  are  persistent  and  bioaccumulative;  and  substances  that
otherwise  give  rise  to  similar  concerns,  e.g.,  likely  to  be  endocrine  disrupting.  This  is
particularly  true  given  that  many  of  the  hazardous  substances  persist  in  the  environment  to
cause damage not only to today’s generation, but also for generations to come.

8.  The  precautionary  principle  is  a  scientifically  more  robust  and  strengthened  approach
because it  recognises  and  takes  into  account  the  limitations  of  scientific  information.  Sound
scientific methodology and assessment require consideration of both what we know and what
we do not know. The assimilative capacity approach has failed precisely because it failed to
acknowledge  and  accommodate  the  limitations  in  scientific  information.  The  body  of
scientific  information  that  we  now  know  is  far  less  than  the  body  of  scientific  information
that we do not yet know. This is evident when we look at the information available 10 or 20
years  ago  compared  to  today;  compared  to  what  we  will  probably  know  in  20  years  from
now.

9.  Fortunately,  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  the  precautionary  principle,  as  well  as
commitments and  programmes  to  eliminate  hazardous  substances  are  replacing  the  failed
assimilative  capacity  approach.  The  key  today  is  to  expedite  this  change  to  ensure  the
prevention  or  substitution  of  hazardous  substances,  rather  than  end-of-pipe  measures  that
merely  concentrate  pollution  and  thereby  create  another  problem  in  the  form  of  hazardous
waste.  End-of-pipe  measures  such  as  filters  do  not  ultimately  solve  the  problem,  and  can
result in higher costs than the inevitable and ultimate solution of substitution at source.

10. In addition, there is a growing recognition and acceptance that hazardous substances need
to  be  targeted  for  prevention  and  phase-out  based  on  their  inherent  characteristics  (e.g.,
persistent,
toxic,  bioaccumulative,  endocrine  disrupting  properties).  When  persistent
substances  are  released  to  the  environment  they  can  not  be  controlled,  and  consequently
exposure is far less relevant than inherent characteristics.

5

11.  Risk  assessments  that  attempt  to  include  the  risk  of  exposure  as  another  criterion  are
dangerous when applied to substances that persist in the environment, or have their effects in
the  smallest  of  concentrations.  Furthermore,  risk  assessments  have  failed  to  keep  pace  with
the  thousands  of  chemicals  in  commercial  use  (as  well  as  unwanted  chemical  by-products)
for  which  there  is  a  tremendous  void  in  information  regarding  their  effects  in  the
environment.  The  vast  majority  of  the  thousands  of  chemicals  are  not  well  assessed,  and
indeed  many  by-products  remain  unidentified.  It  would  take  decades  to  accomplish  such
assessments, the results of which may well be irrelevant anyway, when compared to the need
to  take  action  based  on  the  inherent  characteristics  of  hazardousness,  e.g.,  persistent  and
bioaccumulative chemicals.

12. Another major and seriously dangerous shortcoming of risk assessments is their failure to
address  exposure  of,  and  effects  on  human  conception  and  the  fetus.  We  know  little  about
either, but we do know that the human  conceptus,  fetus  and  nursing  infant  are  exceptionally
vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals.

13.  Risk  assessments  are  expensive  and  scientifically  questionable  given  the  complexity  of
environmental and human health interactions. Risk assessments making exposure, rather than
inherent  characteristics,    are  a  deciding  factor  in  regulation  deriving  from  a  conflict  of
interest, i.e., from the very industry to which they are applied. The origin of risk assessment
is  the  chemical  industry,  which  advocates  the  approach  to  avoid  restrictions,  rather  than
accepting that persistent hazardous substances should not be released to the environment. The
risk of damage from persistent hazardous substances is known to be high, in many cases one-
hundred  percent.  Even  more  alarming  are  the  consequences  of  such  risks:  significant  and
irreversible  damage  (over  the  course  of  generations)  to  the  basic  life  support  systems  that
sustain  the  environment  and  human  health.  This  stands  in  marked  contrast  to  the  risks
associated with automobile accidents or other activities that risk assessment advocates often
try to use as a justification analogy.

14. The greatest danger of risk assessment is that it is being used to continue and justify the
release  of  hazardous  substances  to  the  environment,  a  situation  that  common  sense  (and  the
precautionary principle) would prevent because the practice carries a high risk of significant
and irreversible damage. On the global level, this is particularly true for persistent chemicals.
Consequently,  risk  assessment  appears
to  protect  chemical
manufacturers and polluting technology vendors, rather than constituting a reliable approach
to  protect  the  environment  and  human  health.  In  hindsight,  this  has  indeed  been  the
unfortunate result to date.

to  be  designed  more

15. Inherent characteristics  - e.g., persistent; bioaccumulative; or toxic; or characteristics that
otherwise give rise to similar concerns, e.g., suspected/known endocrine disrupting properties
–  are  sufficient  reasons  to  warrant  taking  preventive  action,  rather  than  whether  exposure  is
considered  sufficiently  high  to  warrant  action.  Indeed,  exposure  is  a  changing  parameter,
changing  over  time  as  a  result  of  mobilisation  in  the  environment  –  both  from  natural  and
human activities over which we have little-to-no control. With regard to  POPs,  some  of  the
most dangerous chemical compounds, the presence of inherent hazardous characteristics must
be the basis for preventive action.

6

16.  Consequently,  risk  assessment  approaches  requiring  exposure  criteria  before  action  can
be  taken  are  not  part  of  the  precautionary  approach,  and  at  best  they  are  scientifically
questionable  with  significant  risk  to  sustainable  development.  Given  the  magnitude  of  the
risks  involved  (significant  and  irreversible  damage  to  life  support  systems),  and  the  time
dimension involved (often many generations), risk assessment is simply far too risky.

17.  The  recent  changes  taking  place  in  favour  of  the  precautionary  principle  and  the
prevention/elimination  of  hazardous  substances  (based  on  inherent  characteristics)  are  some
of  the  most  significant  developments  of  the  international  community  in  its  attempt  to  solve
the  chemical  crisis  and  to  achieve  sustainable  development.  The  following  bodies  have
adopted this new paradigm:

(i)

North Sea Ministers Conference – all North Sea states agreed to phase out all hazardous
substances;

(ii) OSPAR Convention for the protection of the North-east Atlantic marine environment –
Western European governments and the European Commission have agreed to prohibit
new  hazardous  substances,  and  to  phase  out  within  one  generation  (25  years)  existing
hazardous  substances  defined  as  toxic,  persistent  and  liable  to  bioaccumulate,  or
otherwise giving rise to similar concerns (i.e., defined based on inherent characteristics,
not risk assessment);

(iii)  Helsinki  Convention  for  the  protection  of  the  Baltic  Sea  –  Baltic  Sea  states  agreed  to
phase out all hazardous substances defined on the basis of inherent characteristics;
(iv) Barcelona Convention for the protection of the Mediterranean Sea and its related land-
based  sources  protocol  –  Mediterranean  coastal  states  agreed  to  phase  out  hazardous
substances based on their inherent hazardous characteristics;

(v) Bamako  Convention  for  Africa  –  The  Bamako  Convention  contains  one  of  the  most
progressive  definitions  of  hazardous  wastes  (based  on  inherent  characteristics),  the
precautionary  principle,  and  clean  production.  The  convention  calls  for  the  goal  of
eliminating the generation of hazardous waste and hazardous releases at source, rather
than end-of-pipe measures;

(vi) Basel  Convention,  at  the  global  level,  addressing  hazardous  waste  generation,
transboundary  movements  and  disposal  (adopted  1989)  –  The  convention  defines
hazardous waste pursuant to inherent characteristics, not risk of exposure. Furthermore,
Article 10 calls on Parties to co-operate in the development and implementation of new
environmentally sound low-waste technologies and improve existing ones “with a view
to ELIMINATING, as far as practicable, the generation of hazardous wastes …”; and

(vii) POPs  Convention  at  the  global  level  –  The  international  community  has  agreed  at  the
global  level  to  prohibit  and  phase  out  intentional  persistent  organic  pollutants  (POPs),
and  to  adopt  a  number  of  measures  to  reduce  releases  of  unintentional  POPs  with  the
goal  of  their  continuing  minimisation  and,  where  feasible,  ultimate  elimination.  For
both intentional and unintentional POPs, elimination through substitution is a priority.

18. Other significant achievements adopted in the recent past by the international community
in the field of toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes include the following:

7

(i)

(ii)

Prohibiting  the  dumping  at  sea  of  industrial  wastes  and  radioactive  wastes  and
incineration  at  sea.  (London  Convention  at  the  global  level;  Bamako  Convention  for
Africa;  Barcelona  Convention  Protocol  for  the  Mediterranean  States;  Waigani  Treaty
for  the  South  Pacific  States;  OSPAR  Convention  for  the  North-east  Atlantic  States;
Helsinki Convention for the Baltic Sea States). These achievements of the 1990s have
essentially shut off two-thirds of the earth’s surface, i.e., the oceans, to waste disposal.

Prohibiting  the  export  of  hazardous  wastes  and  other  wastes  to  the  area  south  of  60
degrees  south  latitude  (Antarctica)  and  prohibiting  the  export  of  hazardous  wastes  for
any  reason,  including  recycling,  from  OECD  States  to  non- OECD  States.  (Basel
Convention  at  the  global  level,  Bamako  Convention  banning  hazardous  waste  imports
into Africa, Central American Hazardous Waste Trade Agreement banning imports into
the region, Barcelona Convention Waste Trade Protocol,  Waigani  Treaty  for  the  South
Pacific,  and  the  European  Union).  These  1990s  achievements,  such  as  prohibiting
ocean  disposal,  have  ended  dangerous  and  damaging  disposal  practices.  Not  only  has
this reduced pollution, but it also increased incentives especially in  OECD countries to
address the problem at source through clean production substitutes.

19. The POPs treaty with the aim of eliminating  POPs represents the most recent addition to
this  necessary  and  growing  body  of  international  policy  and  law  in  this  field.  Some  of  the
most important concepts and provisions contained in the POPs treaty include:

(i)

Elimination as a goal; both for existing intentionally produced  POPs such as chlordane
and DDT, and also for technologies and practices that yield unwanted by-product  POPs
such as incineration and thermal processes involving chlorine.

(ii)  Prohibiting  the  manufacture  of  new  chemicals  with  POPs  characteristics,  thereby

confining the POPs problem;

(iii)  Capacity  building  and  financial  resources  for  developing  countries  and  countries  with

economies in transition to assist in implementing the provisions;

(iv)  Advocating  or  requiring  the  Substitution  Principle  (substitute  materials,  products  and
processes) to prevent the formation and release of unintentional POPs as the priority for
Best Available Techniques (BAT), as well as substitution for intentional POPs;

(v)  Recognition that avoiding incineration (a major source of  POPs  formation  and  release)

through alternatives - waste separation and reuse/recycling - is a priority;

(vi)  POPs  stockpile  and  waste  destruction  pursuant  to  alternative  destruction  technologies

that do not create POPs, rather than incineration;

(vii)  Calling  for  pollution  release  and  transfer  inventories  and  public  right-to-know

measures.

20.  Collectively,  the  above  mentioned  significant  developments  over  the  past  15  years
represent a major breakthrough in tackling the chemical crisis. In the field of toxic chemicals
and  hazardous  waste  the  challenge  remains,  however,  to  ensure  that  resource  allocation,
legislation,  and  implementation  efforts  reflect  the  priority  given  to  the  application  of  clean
production  methods
and
techniques/technologies  for  hazardous  ones.  Indeed,  clean  production  application  is  the  only
real solution to the toxic crisis and is far more cost effective. Substitution is a one-time cost
and final solution, whereas attempted control and management (e.g., end-of-pipe measures) is

non-hazardous  materials,

substitute

products

that

8

a  never  ending,  ever-changing  process  of  continued  costs  without  actually  solving  the
problem.  The  cost  of  avoidance  through  substitution  is  usually  far  less,  and  it  is  far  more
efficient  and  effective  compared  to  the  real  costs  associated  with  ever-changing  attempted
controls, clean up or remediation (e.g., water supplies), and the real costs to human health and
society.

21.  Clean  production  solutions  (alternative  substitutes,  including  products  and  technologies)
are  especially  relevant  and  necessary  for  the  POPs  treaty,  a  treaty  grounded  on  the  goal  of
elimination rather than attempted control.

IV. IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION – SELECTED PROVISIONS

1.  Depending  on  the  legislative  system  in  a  country,  most  countries  will  have  to  adopt
national legislation that reflects the  POPs treaty in order to become Party to it. The adoption
of implementing legislation for the  POPs  treaty  provides  an  opportunity  to  put  into  place  a
legislation framework that reflects the significant developments over the past 15 years in the
field of hazardous chemicals and hazardous wastes. Not only should this opportunity not be
missed for the sake of the environment and human health, but also for reasons of efficiency.
The  above  mentioned  progressive  developments  clearly  indicate  the  inevitable  direction  and
consequently should be put into place now, rather than through retroactive amendments later.

2.  The  opportunity  to  adopt  legislation  to  comprehensively  cover  all  hazardous  substances,
rather than limit the legislation to POPs only (chemicals of global concern), can be even more
important  and  relevant  for  protecting  the  environment  and  human  health  in  the  near  field
(community, national and regional context). Strictly speaking, the  POPs  treaty  addresses  the
elimination of hazardous substances that are of global concern because they are persistent and
have the potential to cause severe impacts on human health or the environment. However, all
hazardous substances are in need of such regulation, not only those which are the product of
the  “lowest  global  common  denominator”  process.  The  POPs  treaty  provides  the  legal  and
policy  framework  to  eliminate  all  hazardous  substances,  including  those  that  may  not  be
classified  as  persistent  and  globally  distributed,  but  may  cause  local  or  regional  concern
because of their intrinsic properties.

3.  This  section  includes  selected  provisions  to  pay  particular  attention  to  when  adopting
implementing  domestic  legislation.  The  selected  provisions  are  further  elaborated  in  section
VI.

4.  NO  NEW  POPs  (Article  3,  paragraph  3):  In  national  implementing  legislation,  this
provision  needs  to  reflect  a  ban  on  new  chemicals  being  produced  that  have  POPs
characteristics (toxic, persistent,  bioaccumulative,  long-range  transport).  However,  it  is  in  a
country’s  best  interest  (ecosystem/human  health  protection,  efficiency  and  inevitable
direction  anyway)  to  ensure  that  this  ban  is  broadened  to  include  all  hazardous  substances
(HS), not only POPs. In Western Europe under the OSPAR marine protection regime, and for
the  Mediterranean  coastal  states  under  the  Barcelona  Convention,  hazardous  substances  are
defined as toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative, or as those that are of equivalent concern. In
Sweden,  national  legislation  defines  HS  more  progressively  as  substances  that  are  persistent
and  bioaccumulative,  in  addition  to  substances  with  toxic  properties.  In  any  case,  national

9

legislation  must  be  unambiguous  regarding  banning  new  POPs,  and  the  opportunity  to
broaden this provision in domestic legislation to include all HS should not be missed.

5. ELIMINATION LANGUAGE (inter  alia,  Article  5  chapeau):  National  legislation  should
be  based  on  the  prevention  and  elimination  of  POPs.  As  with  the  no-new-POPs  provision
above,  national  implementing  legislation  should  encompass  all  hazardous  substances  (HS),
not  only  those  strictly  defined  by  the  treaty  as  POPs  –  a  reflection  of  the  lowest  common
denominator  for  which  agreement  at  the  global  level  can  be  achieved.  Legislation  should
require phase out  programmes  for  all  HS.  And,  for  unintentional  POPs  (dioxins)  it  should
also specifically ban new source categories, as well as new sources within existing categories.
The  treaty  affirms  the  marked  change  in  environmental  policy  rejecting  the  assimilative
capacity  approach  based  on  attempted  control  of  quantitative  releases,  in  favour  of  the
common  sense  approach  of  elimination  for  hazardous  substances.  Implementing  policy  and
legislation should reflect this significant and necessary change.

light  of

6.  PRINCIPLE  OF  SUBSTITUTION  (Article  5,  paragraph  (c)):  Although  the  Principle  of
Substitution  is  inherent  for  intentional  POPs  and  expressly  stated  in  the  context  of
unintentional  POPs,  the  principle  should  be  reflected  in  national  legislation  requiring
substitution  for  all  hazardous  substances  (HS).  In
the  elimination  goal,
SUBSTITUTION MUST BE A REQUIREMENT and the primary objective, rather than end-
of-pipe  measures  that  do  not  prevent  the  formation  of  POPs  or  other  hazardous  substances.
The  DDT  obligations  in  the  treaty  provide  a  good  approach  to  required  substitution  where
continued  DDT  use  must  be  justified,  including  a  justification  that  no  viable  substitutes  are
available.  The  Principle  of  Substitution  is  not  only  applicable,  but  also  indispensable  for  all
unsustainable  activities  if  we  are  serious  about  achieving  sustainable  development.  Perhaps
one  of  the  most  important  developments  from  the  POPs  treaty  would  be  to  utilise  the
implementing  legislative  process  to  require  the  substitution  principle  specifically  for  POPs
and  all  hazardous  substances,  AND  to  incorporate  it  into  a  requirement  for  all  unsustainable
activities.  Indeed,  the  only  way  to  achieve  sustainable  development  is  to  substitute  (replace)
currently unsustainable practices, products and techniques with sustainable ones.

7.  POLLUTANT  RELEASE  INVENTORIES  AND  PUBLIC  RIGHT-TO-KNOW:  (Article
10, paragraph 5, and Article 9, paragraph 5). National legislation should require pollutant (all
HS)  release  and  transfer  inventories  (plant-by-plant  basis)  with  public  access  to  all  such
information. Again, this legislation should go beyond POPs to apply to all HS.

8. ALL  POPs  RELATED  INFORMATION  AVAILABLE  TO  THE  PUBLIC:  (Article  10).
Similar to the right-to-know issue above, implementing legislation should expressly state that
there is no business confidentiality for any and all information related to  POPs,  and  all  such
information  must  be  made  available  to  the  public.  In  balancing  the  interests  of  business
confidentiality  with  the  public  right  to  information  affecting  their  health  and  welfare,
(especially once a substance has been released to the environment), clearly the public interest
must prevail the confidentiality argument.

10

9. DIOXIN/FURAN ELIMINATION (Article 5 and Annex C): Dioxin source categories and
national dioxin elimination action plans need to include the  chlor-alkali industry and chlorine
use  industries.  As  stated  in  the  chapeau  paragraph  of  Annex  C,  Part  II  Source  Categories,
when chlorine and thermal processes are combined, dioxins are formed.
Chlorine  industrial  sectors  can  be  some  of  the  most  significant  sources  of  dioxins  for  many
countries.  In  addition,  as  mentioned  above  no  new  source  categories  and  no  new  sources
within  existing  source  categories  should  be  part  of  national  implementing  legislation
addressing  the  unintentional  POPs  in  order  to  implement  the  obligation  to  reduce  with  the
aim of ultimate elimination.

10.  AVOIDING  AND  ULTIMATELY  PHASING  OUT  INCINERATION  (Article  5  and
Annex  C):  Implementing  legislation  should  pay  particular  attention  to  ensuring  the
development  of  the  alternative  to  incineration,  in  particular  to  municipal  waste  incineration.
Legislation  should  reflect  the  priority  afforded  to  alternative  waste  management  systems
based  on  separation  and  reuse/recycling,
the  need  for  municipal
incineration.  This  is  particularly  true  given  the  tremendous  costs  of  siting,  construction,
operation  and  maintenance  of  incinerators  (and  the  fact  that  dioxins  are  still  formed  and
become a hazardous waste disposal problem), compared to avoiding incineration by investing
in  the  alternative  system,  a  system  that  also  employs  more  workers.  This  same  alternatives
approach should be pursued with respect to other sources of dioxins.

V. GENERAL TREATY STRUCTURE

1. The POPs treaty consists of a preamble, 30 articles and six annexes.

2. The intentionally produced  POPs  are  addressed  specifically  in  Article  3  (production,  use
and  trade)  and  Annexes  A  and  B.  Article  3  addresses  both  the  chemicals  to  be
prohibited/eliminated, and those to be restricted. Annex A lists the chemicals (production and
uses)  that  are  prohibited  or  to  be  phased  out,  and  the  types  of  uses  (country  specific
exemptions) allowed during the phase out period. Annex B lists and addresses the restricted
chemicals  (DDT),  and  establishes  a  DDT  Register  that  is  available  to  the  public.  Note:
Although Annex B applies to restricted  POPs  (currently  only  DDT),  the  goal  is  to  ultimately
eliminate  DDT.  Annexes  A  and  B  also  contain  in  their  respective  “Notes”  the  general
exemptions to prohibition and restriction.

3. Article 4 addresses the register that will contain the country specific exemptions that allow
countries  to  produce/use  Annex  A  or  B  chemicals  until  their  complete  phase  out.  Countries
will be named in the register and it is available to the public.

4. Unintentional POPs are addressed in Article 5 and Annex C. Stockpiles and waste disposal
is  addressed  in  Article  6.  Article  7  addresses  the  requirement  for  implementation  plans  for
each Party. Article 8, and Annexes D, E, and F address the adding of additional  POPs to the
treaty.

11

5.  The  remaining  articles  are  of  a  general  nature  and  are  typical  of  most  environmental
agreements, although Articles 9 and 10 provide additional requirements for pollutant release
registers and public right-to-know provisions. Also the financial assistance articles 13 and 14
are significant developments within the treaty.

The following section covers the Articles and Annexes in detail.

VI. SPECIFIC TREATY PROVISIONS ANALYSED

1. The Preamble

1.1 Status of Preamble: The preamble is not legally binding on Parties. It is a statement of the
rationale and context for the treaty and it also provides the basis upon which the treaty action
is to be taken. However, arguments/statements can be found in the preamble that assist in the
interpretation  of  treaty  provisions,  and  provide  general  guidance.  Below  are  selected  points
contained in the Preamble warranting specific mention.

1.2 The 2nd paragraph (preamble paragraphs are not numbered in the text) identifies LOCAL
exposure  including  to  women  and  babies.  This  supports  the  point  that  the  characteristics
toxic,  persistent,  and  bioaccumulative  are  more  important  than  the  long-range  transport
criterion  when  adding  additional  POPs  to  the  Treaty,  and  when  adopting  implementing
legislation that applies to all hazardous substances.

1.3  HUMAN  HEALTH  is  identified  in  many  paragraphs  and  in  the  objective  of  the  treaty
(Article 1).

1.4  The  9th  paragraph  states  that  the  Convention  and  WTO  (and  trade  agreements)  ARE
mutually supportive, therefore trade provisions can not supersede the POPs treaty provisions.
The WTO regime has exceptions specifically for environmental and human health protection,
whereas the POPs treaty does not have specific exceptions for free trade objectives.

1.5  The  10th  paragraph  reiterates  the  commitment  from  the  UN  Charter,  also  found  in
commitments  from  the  first  Earth  Summit  –  the  1972  Stockholm  Conference  on  the  Human
Environment–  that  countries  have  the  responsibility  to  ensure  that  their  activities  do  not
damage  areas  outside  of  their  jurisdiction.  This  commitment  underscores  the  need  for  the
expeditious phase-out of all hazardous chemicals, in particular persistent ones.

1.6  The  15th  paragraph
identifies  PRODUCER  RESPONSIBILITY.  Liability  and
responsibility of POPs producers and users, both physical and financial are in need of further
development  within  the  POPs  treaty.  Until  that  time,  governments  carry  the  primary
responsibility  for  funding  implementation,  e.g.,  the  destruction  of  POPs  stockpiles  and
wastes,  as  well  as  the  environmental  and  human  health  costs  from  current  and  future  POPs
pollution.

12

1.7  The  16th  paragraph  identifies  PREVENTION  MEASURES  AT  ALL  LIFE  CYCLE
STAGES.  This  especially  carries  implications  for  unintentional  POPs  source  categories
involving  chlorinated  materials  such  as  PVC  (and  other  halogenated  substances).  Non-
chlorinated substitution throughout the life cycle stages is the preferred prevention measure in
order to avoid dioxin formation.

1.8  The  17th  paragraph  cites  Principle  16  from  the  Rio  Declaration,  identifying  the  Polluter
Pays  Principle.  This  has  implications  for  phase-outs,  clean  up  costs,  destruction  costs  and
liability.

1.9 The 19th paragraph further supports the priority measures of alternatives and substitution.

2. The Objective of the Treaty (Article 1)

Article 1 states that the objective is to protect both human health and the environment. It also
cites  Principle  15  from  the  Rio  Declaration  on  the  precautionary  approach.  Central  to  this
approach  is  taking  preventive  action  before  conclusive  proof  regarding  cause  and  effect  is
available.  This  is  also  important  when  adding  additional  POPs  (chemicals  and  groups  of
chemicals) to the treaty. Not all evidence need be present regarding cause and effect, at which
time it is often too late to prevent the damage.

3. Definitions (Article 2)

Basic definitions are contained in Article 2.

4. Intentionally produced  POPs (Articles 3 and 4, and Annexes A and B)

4.1

NO NEW POPS

New Chemicals with  POPs characteristics are  to be  banned  (Article 3,  paragraph 3). Parties
are to incorporate into their assessment schemes the criteria contained in Annex D (persistent,
bioaccumulative,
toxicity).  Chemicals
(pesticides and industrial chemicals) being developed that exhibit these  POPs  characteristics
are  to  be  banned  from  production  and  use.  This  is  the  provision  that  “shuts  off  the  tap”  of
new POPs entering the world thereby confining the problem.

4.2 PRODUCTION AND USE OF ANNEX A CHEMICALS - ELIMINATION

4.2.1  The  production  and  use  of  existing  intentional  POPs  listed  in  Annex  A  are  to  be
prohibited/eliminated  EXCEPT  as  allowed  by  Annex  A.  Annex  A  includes  in  Part  I,  the
chemicals  Aldrin,  Chlordane,  Dieldrin,  Endrin,  Heptachlor,  Hexachlorobenzene,  Mirex,
Toxophene  and  PCBs.  Part  II  of  Annex  A  addresses  PCBs  specifically.  Annex  A  contains
general  exemptions  available  to  all  Parties  and  country  specific  exemptions  with  phase-out
timeframes.

13

4.2.2 GENERAL EXEMPTIONS: Article 3, paragraph 5, and the Notes contained in Annex
A provide for general exemptions that are available to all Parties. The general exemptions to
the prohibition/elimination (and trade limitations) include:

(i)

(ii)

Quantities of a chemical to be used for laboratory-scale RESEARCH or as a
REFERENCE standard (Article 3, paragraph 5);

(iii)  Quantities of a chemical occurring as CONSTITUENTS OF ARTICLES ALREADY
MANUFACTURED or already in use before the date of entry into force of provisions
with  respect  to  that  chemical  but  –  a  Party  must  notify  the  Secretariat  that  such  an
article  remains  in  use.  This  information  is  to  be  made  available  by  the  Secretariat  to
the public (Annex A, Note ii);

(iv)

IF notified to the Secretariat, the production and use of  Hexachlorobenzene  (and  any
additional POP not having an asterisk (*) after its name in Annex A) are allowed as a

properties.  The  notification  information  is  to  be  made  available  to  the  public  by  the
Secretariat. Such production and use shall end after 10 years unless a new notification
is made to the Secretariat. A new notification gives the Party another 10 years unless
the  Conference  of  Parties  decides  otherwise.  The  10  year  extension  can  be  repeated
(Annex A, Note iii).

4.2.3  SPECIFIC  EXEMPTIONS:  Annex  A  (and  B)  also  contains  the  country  specific
exemptions allowed. These exemptions are only available to Parties that register their specific
exemptions  in  the  Register  of  Specific  Exemptions  (Article  4).  The  Register  is  to  be
maintained  by  the  Secretariat  and  available  to  the  public.  It  will  include  a  list  of  specific
exemptions, the Parties exercising specific exemptions and the expiry dates for each specific
exemption.

4.2.3.1  All  registrations  of  specific  exemptions  EXPIRE  five  years  after  entry  into  force  of
the  Convention.  For  additional  POPs  added  to  the  Convention,  any  specific  exemptions
likewise  would  expire  five  years  after  the  entry  into  force  of  that  amendment  adding  the
chemical  to  the  treaty.  BUT,  an  extension  is  available  giving  the  potential  to  extend  the
registered specific exemption for another five years. A review process will be adopted at the
first Conference of Parties to consider a request for extension of a specific exemption. Parties
exercising the specific exemptions will need to justify their exemption extension request. The
maximum time frame for specific exemptions is a possible 10 years after entry into force with
respect to that chemical.

4.2.3.2  In  addition,  when  the  register  has  no  Parties  for  a  particular  type  of  specific
exemption, the specific exemption expires and no new registrations may be made for it.

4.2.3.3 Note that under Article 3, paragraph 6 there are additional duties on a Party exercising
a specific exemption. They must prevent or minimise human exposure and releases.

14

4.2.4  PCBs:  Under  Part  I  of  Annex  A  the  production  of  PCBs  is  banned.  Annex  A,  Part  I
provides Parties with a special type of exemption for PCBs in articles in use (available to all
Parties without the need to register). This exemption is governed by Annex A, Part II. Under
Part II of the Annex, PCBs in articles such as transformers may be used until the elimination
date of 2025, which is subject to review by the Conference of Parties. A number of duties are
required  however,  such  as  the  attempt  to  identify,  label  and  remove  equipment/articles  from
use depending on the PCB concentrations and volumes. Furthermore, the equipment can not
be  leaking  or  used  in  certain  areas  such  as  food  production.  Trade  in  PCBs  can  only  be  for
environmentally  sound  waste  management.  No  recovery  is  allowed  for  recycling/reuse  in
equipment  with  greater  than  .005%  PCB.  “Determined  efforts”  to  environmentally  sound
waste  management  (destruction)  of  PCBs  should  be  as  soon  as  possible,  and  no  later  than
2028.  This  date  is  subject  to  review.  A  report  by  each  Party  regarding  their  progress  on
eliminating  PCBs  is  to  be  submitted  to  the  Conference  of  Parties  every  five  years.  PCBs  in
other articles such as painted objects, cured caulk, and cable covers with greater than .005%
are to be addressed as well.

4.3 PRODUCTION AND USE OF ANNEX B CHEMICALS – RESTRICTED (DDT)

4.3.1  Article  3,  paragraph  1  (b)  requires  Parties  to  restrict  production  and  use  of  Annex  B
chemicals,  rather  than  eliminate  them.  As  described  below,  however,  the  ultimate  goal  is  to
eliminate Annex B substances such as DDT. The only chemical currently listed in Annex B is
DDT.  Its  production  and  use  are  governed  by  Annex  B.  Annex  B,  Part  I  restricts  DDT
production and use for “acceptable purposes” or specific exemption.

4.3.2  GENERAL  EXEMPTIONS:  The  same  general  exemptions  afforded  Annex  A
chemicals  are  available  for  Annex  B  chemicals  (DDT).  See  section  above  addressing  the
general exemptions.

4.3.3 SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS: The only specific exemption for DDT is as an intermediate
and specifically for the production of dicofol. The specific exemption is available to countries
that register pursuant to Article 4. This Annex B specific exemption is addressed in the same
manner  as  Annex  A  specific  exemptions.  See  discussion  above  regarding  Annex  A  specific
exemptions.  These  exemptions  expire  after  5  years  with  the  possibility  of  an  extension  for
another 5 years; hence a maximum of 10 years.

4.3.4  ACCEPTABLE  PURPOSE:  The  only  “acceptable  purpose”  for  DDT  is  disease  vector
control (e.g., malaria). This purpose is governed by Part II of Annex B. Part II eliminates the
production  and  use  of  DDT  except  for  Parties  that  notify  the  Secretariat.  Such  Parties  can
produce and/or use it for disease vector control. A separate DDT SPECIFIC ACCEPTABLE
PURPOSE  REGISTER  will  be  established  and  maintained  by  the  Secretariat.  It  is  to  be
available  to  the  public.  This  will  be  similar  to  the  specific  exemption  register,  but  for  DDT
production and/or use with respect to disease vector control.

4.3.5  Parties  exercising  their  acceptable  purpose  use  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  WHO
recommendations and guidelines, AND only when safe, effective and affordable alternatives
are  not  available  to  the  Party  concerned.  Parties  can  register  when  they  deem  the  need  to
exercise  the  acceptable  purpose.  Every  three  years  Parties  must  provide  the  Secretariat  and

15

the WHO with information regarding amounts used, how these amounts were used and their
disease strategy.

4.3.6  Annex  B,  Part  II,  paragraph  5  states  clearly  that  the  goal  is  to  reduce  and  ultimately
eliminate DDT. To this end, Parties using DDT should develop and implement an action plan
to  restrict  DDT  to  disease  vector  control,  implement  alternatives  and  take  measures  to
strengthen  health  care  and  reduce  disease.  Parties  are  also  encouraged  to  promote  research
and development into alternatives (chemical and non-chemical products).

4.3.7 An evaluation regarding the continued need for DDT shall be done by the Conference
of Parties at its first meeting and every three years thereafter.

4.4 TRADE IN ANNEX A AND ANNEX B CHEMICALS (Article 3, paragraph 2)

4.4.1  IMPORT:  A  chemical  listed  in  Annex  A  or  B  only  can  be  imported  by  a  Party  for  the
purpose of environmentally sound disposal pursuant to Article 6 (discussed below); or for a
use  permitted  for  the  importing  Party  allowed  by  Annex  A  or  B,  i.e.,  general  exemption,
specific exemption, or acceptable purpose.

4.4.2 EXPORT: A chemical listed in Annex A or B and allowed under the respective Annex
(general  exemption,  specific  exemption,  acceptable  purpose)  only  can  be  exported  for
environmentally sound disposal pursuant to Article 6 (discussed below); or to a Party that is
allowed  to  use  the  chemical  pursuant  to  Annex  A  or  B  (general  exemption,  specific
exemption,  acceptable  purpose);  or  to  a  non-Party  (“State  not  Party  to  this  Convention”)  if
certain conditions are met. The term “State not Party to this Convention” means either a State
that  is  not  a  Party  to  the  Convention,  or  a  Party  to  the  Convention  that  is  not  bound  with
respect to the chemical in question, i.e., an additional POP to the 12 currently in the treaty for
which it has not agreed to be bound (Article 3, paragraph 2 (d)).

4.4.3  The  non-Party  conditions  include  providing  an  annual  certification  to  the  exporting
Party containing: the intended use and that the recipient is committed to protecting health and
environment  by  minimising  or  preventing  releases;  that  they  will  comply  with  disposal
obligations pursuant to Article 6; and that they will comply in the case of DDT with Annex
B,  Part  II,  paragraph  2  (disease  vector  control  only;  follow  WHO;  and  no  safe,  effective,
affordable alternatives). The annual certification is to go to the Secretariat from the exporting
Party within 60 days of its receipt from the importing State.

4.4.4  Any  chemical  on  Annex  A  for  which  no  specific  exemption  exists  for  production  and
use, can be only exported for environmentally sound disposal pursuant to Article 6 (discussed
below).

5. Unintentional POPs (Article 5 and Annex C)

5.1 Annex C, Part I lists the unintentional  POPs subject to Article 5 provisions. The existing
list includes dioxins/furans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and PCBs.

5.2 An important priority with respect to the elimination of unintentional  POPs (e.g., dioxins)
is  to  ensure  measures  adopted  and  implemented  go  first  and  foremost  to  prevention  and

16

elimination  of  their  FORMATION  through  avoiding/prohibiting  chlorine  inputs,  and
implementing  safe  alternative  products  and  technologies,  rather  than  end-of-pipe  controls.
Another  significant  point  is  to  ensure  that  targeted  source  categories  for  dioxins/furans
include  chlorine  industries,  which  are  not  directly  very  well  reflected  in  the  list  of  source
categories  contained  in  Annex  C.  The  chapeau  in  Part  II  of  Annex  C,  however,  covers  the
chlorine  and  chlorine  use  industries  making  the  point  that  chlorine  plus  thermal  processes
equals dioxins. Consequently, chlorine and chlorine use industries need to be considered for
inclusion in the dioxin elimination action plans that countries are required to develop.

5.3  The  Article  5  chapeau  (first  paragraph)  requires  each  Party  at  minimum  to  take  the
measures  listed  in  order  to  REDUCE  the  TOTAL  releases  with  the  goal  of  their
CONTINUING MINIMISATION and where feasible, ULTIMATE ELIMINATION.

5.4  This  small  paragraph  contains  important  implications.  Parties  must  take  the  measures  to
reduce  total  releases  with  the  aim  of  elimination.  The  goal  of  ultimate  elimination  would
render  increases  inconsistent  with  the  obligation.  The  language  “reduce  with  the  aim  of
ultimate  elimination”  does  not  permit  “trading”  between  source  categories  (increasing  one
source  while  decreasing  another).  The  elimination  goal  also  underscores  the  obligation  and
need
to  substitution  (non-chlorine  material  use,  and
technologies/techniques that do not create dioxins) rather than end-of-pipe measures.

to  ensure  priority

is  given

5.5 The “where feasible” condition on elimination should be interpreted in its common usage
since  it  is  not  a  term  of  art.  This  would  mean  physical  possibility.  However,  even  if  the
phrase  was  to  include  economic  feasibility,  it  would  not  make  a  significant  difference.
Compared to the costs of inaction (not eliminating) in terms of damage to human health and
the environment, clean up costs  and the costs of inevitable increasing controls if elimination
is  not  undertaken,  it  is  virtually  always  more  economically  feasible  to  eliminate  dioxin
formation through substitution than to incur the real costs of inaction.

5.6 At the  centre  of  the  measures  required  by  Article  5  is  the  ACTION  PLAN.  This  will
usually be a national elimination action plan, but could be a regional or sub-regional one for a
group  of  countries.  The  action  plan  must  be  drafted  within  two  years  of  entry  into  force  for
the  country  in  question.  The  action  plan  is  to  identify,  estimate  and  address  the  releases  of
unintentional  POPs,  AND  to  facilitate  the  other  Article  5  provisions,  e.g.,  Substitution
Principle discussed below.

5.7 The elimination action plan must include an inventory of source categories of current and
projected  releases  and  the  estimated  releases.  Annex  C  contains  in  Part  II  and  Part  III  non-
exhaustive,  indicative  lists  of  source  categories  to  take  into  account  when  developing  the
inventories. Part II sources are considered higher priority than Part III sources.

5.8  The  Annex  C,  Part  II  chapeau  paragraph  clearly  states  the  reason  for  the  formation  of
unintentional  POPs  (hereafter  referred  to  as  dioxins,  recognising  that  there  are  others,  e.g.,
HCBs  and  PCBs.).  They  are  formed  and  released  from  thermal  processes  involving  organic
matter  and  chlorine.  Hence,  the  key  is  to  avoid  chlorine.  The  most  effective  measures
therefore  would  be  to  avoid  chlorine  inputs,  products  and  technologies.  With  respect  to
heterogeneous facilities with a broad mix of inputs, like incinerators, avoid the incinerator in

17

the first place, while during the interim phase out period, avoiding chlorine inputs like PVC
to the maximum extent possible.

5.9  The  priority  source  categories  (Part  II  of  Annex  C)  include  all  waste  incinerators,  and
cement kilns burning hazardous waste; pulp production using elemental chlorine or chemicals
generating  elemental  chlorine  for  bleaching  (note:  chlorine  dioxide  bleaching  analysis
indicates  evidence  of  elemental  chlorine  formation,  whereas  non-chlorine  bleaching
substitutes  are  available  to  the  pulp  industry);  secondary  copper,  secondary  aluminum,
secondary zinc, and sinter plants for iron and steel. Note: the secondary metallurgy industries
are probably most problematic due to chlorine contaminants involved in the recovery process.
Note: The only chlorine-use industry directly listed is the pulp and paper industry. This may
be because all chlorine industries are identified in the chapeau paragraph due to the obvious
link  between  chlorine  and  dioxin.  Hence,  countries  need  to  ensure  that  they  include  any
relevant chlorine industries located in their country (e.g., the  chlor-alkali  industry  and  major
chlorine-use  industries  such  as  PVC,  chlorinated  solvents,  and  chlorinated  pesticide
production) in their elimination action plans.

5.10 The Part III (of Annex C) sources include: open burning (note: chlorine products such as
PVC can never be sufficiently controlled to keep them out of fires); other metallurgy thermal
processes  not  included  in  Part  II;  residential  combustion  like  fireplaces;  fossil  fuel  utility
facilities  and  industrial  boilers,  wood  and  biomass  fuel  facilities;  chemical  production
especially  chlorophenols and  chloranil;  crematoria;  motor  vehicles  especially  with  leaded
fuel;  burning  of  animals;  textile  and  leather  dyeing  (chloranil)  and  finishing  (alkaline
extraction);  shredder  plants  for  e.g.,  automobiles;  copper  cables  burning,  e.g.,  to  recover
copper; and waste oil refineries.

5.11  Again,  as  long  as  chlorine  continues  to  be  used  and  spread  around  the  world,  the
contamination will continue to create dioxins when thermal processes are involved. The key
is to phase out chlorine use if the POPs treaty is to be successful.

5.12 BACK TO THE ELIMINATION ACTION PLAN: The action plan must also include a
review  of  laws  and  policies,  and  development  of  strategies  to  implement  the  elimination
action plan. Here again it is essential that the strategies envisaged reflect chlorine substitution
as a centrepiece. A review every five years is required to  analyse  the  strategies  vis-à-vis  the
results  in  meeting  the  obligations.  The  reviews  submitted  by  each  Party  will  be  sent  to  the
Secretariat  and  made  available.  The  action  plan  must  also  include  a  schedule  for
implementation of the strategies and measures to be taken.

5.13  In  addition  to  the  elimination  action  plan  as  a  measure  to  be  taken,  other  measures  are
required  as  well:  Article  5,  paragraph  (c)  contains  the  SUBSTITUTION  PRINCIPLE.  The
language  is  weakened  by  the  word  “promote”  the  development  of  substitutes,  but  it  also
includes  “where  it  (a  Party)  deems  appropriate,  REQUIRE  the  use  of  substitute  or  modified
MATERIALS,  PRODUCTS  AND  PROCESSES  to  PREVENT  the  FORMATION  and
release”  of  dioxins.  REQUIRING  substitution  should  be  at  the  centre  of  the  strategies  and
elimination  action  plan  –  chlorine  substitution/incineration  substitution  in  order  to  solve  the
dioxin problem.

18

5.14  When  implementing  the  Substitution  Principle,  each  Party  is  to  take  into  consideration
the  Annex  C  general  guidance  on  prevention  and  release  reduction  measures.  These  add  to
the  case  for  substitution.  The  general  prevention  measures  section  (Part  V,  paragraph  A)
states that PRIORITY should be given to approaches to PREVENT THE FORMATION and
release of dioxins, which could include (among others) the use of low-waste technology and
the  use  of  less  hazardous  substances  (note:  chlorine  and  chlorinated  material  substitutes).
Other  approaches  listed  in  Part  V,  A  help  supplement  the  substitution  principle,  such  as
paragraph (d) “replacement of feed materials which are  POPs  or  where  there  is  a  direct  link
between  the  materials  and  releases  of  POPs  from  the  source”.  (Note  again:  chlorine  and
chlorinated materials).

5.15 Another Annex C measure to take into consideration, in particular for the substitution of
incinerators  is  the  promotion  of  recovery  and  recycling  of  wastes  and  substances  used  in  a
process. Segregation of wastes, recovery, recycling and composting, coupled with the phase
out  of  hazardous  substances  would  avoid  the  need  for  municipal  incineration,  a  significant
dioxin source. Indeed the huge capital costs associated with municipal incinerators would be
better  spent  on  developing  this  incinerator  substitute  approach  that  would  also  increase
employment while decreasing environmental and human health damage.

5.16  Another  measure  supporting  substitution  is  (f)  when  considering  new  waste  disposal
facilities.  Consideration  is  to  be  given  to  alternatives  such  as  low  waste  products,  reuse-
recovery-recycle,  minimising  waste  generation  (municipal  and  medical)  and  waste
segregation. Measure (g) calls for  minimising  dioxins  as  contaminants  in  products,  and  (h)
avoiding elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental chlorine for bleaching.

5.17 Furthermore, in Annex C, Part V, paragraph B, (b) guidance is given on general release
reduction measures: “When considering proposals to construct new facilities or significantly
modify existing facilities using processes that release chemicals in this Annex (note: dioxins),
PRIORITY consideration should be given to ALTERNATIVE PROCESSES, TECHNIQUES
AND PRACTICES that have similar usefulness but which AVOID THE FORMATION and
release of such chemicals. This paragraph goes on to list other reduction measures that “could
also  be  considered”  which  are  primarily  end-of-pipe  for  incinerators,  e.g.,  flue-gas  cleaning,
treatment  of  residuals  and  waste  water,  process  changes  such  as  moving  to  closed  systems
and  improved  combustion.  However,  the  substitution  measures  identified  above  are  to  be
given  priority  over  the  end-of-pipe  measures.  Implementation  practice  needs  to  reflect  this
priority focus on substitution.

5.18  Another  Article  5  obligation  concerns  “best  available  techniques”  (BAT)  and  “best
environmental practices” (BEP). BAT and  BEP  are  defined  in  Article  5,  paragraph  (f)  with
further  guidance  contained  in  Annex  C,  Part  B  (BAT),  and  Part  C  (BEP).  BAT  means  the
most EFFECTIVE AND ADVANCED stage in the development of activities and methods of
operation  that  provide  release  limitations  DESIGNED  TO  PREVENT  and,  where  that  is  not
practicable,  generally  to  reduce  releases  of  dioxins.  (Note:  priority  is  clearly  given  to
prevention).  “TECHNIQUES”  are  defined  to  include  both  the  technology  used,  and  the  way
the  facility  is  designed  and  operated.  “AVAILABLE”  is  defined  as  meaning  available  to  the
operator  and  sufficiently  developed  to  allow  implementation  within  the  industrial  sector
under economically and technically viable conditions.

19

5.19 Therefore BAT can be viewed as a follow-the-leader approach. Those industrial sectors
(e.g., the pulp industry) with existing sustainable, non-toxic production techniques should be
fully transformed pursuant to the BAT goal in such a way that all facilities/plants within the
particular  industrial  sector  implement  the  BAT.  For  example,  total  chlorine-free  (TCF)
bleaching in pulp production is the lead to follow for chlorine bleaching and chlorine dioxide
bleaching facilities, since it represents BAT for the pulp and paper industrial sector.

5.20  Annex  C,  Part  V  provides  further  guidance  on  BAT.  As  mentioned  above  under  the
section on the Substitution Principle, the considerations that support substitution all relate to
BAT,  e.g.,  low-waste  technology,  less  hazardous  substances,  replacement  of  feed  materials,
avoiding chemicals that generate elemental chlorine, alternative consideration to incineration,
and PRIORITY to alternatives that avoid POPs.

5.21 BEP is defined broadly to encompass a combination of measures and strategies, and is to
be further elaborated upon by the Conference of Parties.

5.22  NEW  SOURCES  within  the  source  categories  identified  by  Parties  in  their  respective
elimination  action  plans:  Parties  are  to  promote,  and  in  accordance  with  its  implementation
schedule  for  its  action  plan,  REQUIRE  the  use  of  BAT  for  NEW  sources  of  dioxins  it  has
identified as warranting such action. Particular focus is to go to the source categories in Part
II  of  Annex  C,  e.g.,  incineration.  This  obligation  is  a  mandate  pursuant  to  the  requirement
that in any circumstance, the requirement to use BAT for new sources in the categories listed
in  Part  II  of  Annex  C  SHALL  be  phased  in  as  soon  as  possible  but  NO  LATER  THAN
FOUR YEARS after entry into force of the Convention for that Party.  BEP  is  merely  to  be
promoted. Note that “new sources” are defined as those for which construction or substantial
modification  is  started  one  year  or  more  after  the  entry  into  force  with  respect  to  that
chemical.

5.23 EXISTING SOURCES: Parties are to PROMOTE in accordance with their action plan,
the use of BAT and BEP for existing sources in source categories listed in Part II of Annex C,
and other source categories SUCH AS those listed in Part III. The same promotion obligation
applies to NEW sources within source categories listed in Part III that were not addressed in
addressing Part II.

5.24 In all cases, BAT should be viewed as a “highest common denominator” strategy. The
most protective/least polluting technology and/or method of operation in practice (or not yet
in  practice  but  considered  viable)  should  result  in  the  transformation  of  the  respective
industrial sector so that all facilities within the sector implement the best protection approach
- a follow-the-leader approach.

6. Disposal-Stockpiles and Wastes (Article 6)

6.1 Article 6 governs the disposal of stockpiles consisting of or containing Annex A or Annex
B chemicals (intentionally produced). The article also governs wastes, including products and
articles upon becoming wastes that consist of, contain, or are contaminated with Annex A, B
or C chemicals (intentional and unintentional POPs).

20

6.2  Each  Party  must  (shall)  DEVELOP  STRATEGIES  FOR  IDENTIFYING:  1)  stockpiles
with  Annex  A  or  B  POPs  and  2)  articles  and  products  in  use  and  wastes  consisting  of,
containing or contaminated with Annex A, B, or C POPs.

6.3 Then each Party must actually IDENTIFY stockpiles with Annex A or B  POPs pursuant
to those strategies.

6.4  Once  identified,  stockpiles  with  Annex  A  or  B  chemicals  (intentional  POPs)  are  to  be
defined  as  wastes  after  they  are  no  longer  allowed  for  any  specific  exemption  or  acceptable
purpose,  except  stockpiles  which  are  allowed  to  be  exported  according  to  Article  3.  The
wastes, including products and articles upon becoming wastes (with Annex A, B or C  POPs)
must  be  managed  according  to  Article  6,  paragraph  1,  (d):  environmentally  sound  handling,
collection, transport and storage; and then:

6.5 Stockpiles must be disposed of so that the POPs are DESTROYED OR IRREVERSIBLY
TRANSFORMED into non- POPs, UNLESS destruction or irreversible transformation are not
considered  the  environmentally  preferable  option  or  when  the  POPs  content  is  LOW.
Consequently,  destruction  or  irreversible  transformation  is  required  in  most  cases,  since  it  is
difficult to envisage when this would not be the environmentally preferable option. In cases
where the POPs content is low, however (or when the case can be made that destruction is not
the preferable option) disposal must be done in “an environmentally sound manner”.

6.6  The  reference  to  Annex  C  chemicals  in  Article  6,  paragraph  2  indicates  that  Annex  C
wastes,  including  articles  and  products  upon  becoming  wastes,  are  also  subject  to  the
destruction/disposal  paragraph  of  Article  6,  paragraph  1,  (d)  which  is  otherwise  ambiguous
regarding this scope of application.

6.7
Article  6  also  envisages  close  cooperation  with  the  Basel  Convention  (addressing
hazardous  waste  generation  and  transboundary  movements  and  their  disposal)  for  further
elaboration.

6.8  The  language  of  paragraph  1  (d)  is  sufficiently  clear  regarding  the  requirement  of
destruction or irreversible transformation such that alternative destruction technologies are to
be  required  (unless  the  POPs  concentration  content  is  “low”),  rather  than  incineration  (a
source of POPs).

6.9  Article  6,  paragraph  1  (d)  also  bans  disposal  operations  that  lead  to  recovery,  recycling,
reuse  or  alternative  uses  of  POPs.  This  is  an  important  recognition.  Reuse,  recovery  and
recycling are not always good. Reuse, recovery and recycling are beneficial when applied to
non-hazardous  materials  and  products.  However,  when  applied  to  hazardous  materials  and
products, the result is continued pollution (at the production, recycling, and ultimate disposal
stages), as well as a continuation and even increase in demand for hazardous production due
to recycling markets. This is counter productive when the only adequate solution is to prevent
and  avoid  the  generation  of  the  hazardous  substance  through  clean  production  substitution.
Recycling  has  no  role  in  the  context  of  hazardous  substances,  such  as  POPs  for  which  the
goal is avoidance and elimination.

21

6.10  Another  requirement  of  Article  6  is  for  each  Party  to  ENDEAVOUR  to  develop
strategies for identifying POPs contaminated sites (Annex A, B or C chemicals).

7. Implementation Plans (Article 7)

Each party must DEVELOP and endeavour “to implement plans for the implementation of its
obligation  under  this  Convention”.  The  dioxin  elimination  action  plan  is  part  of  the  overall
implementation  plan.  The  plan  must  be  transmitted  to  the  Conference  of  Parties  within  two
years of entry into force. The Parties must cooperate with  NGOs  including  women’s  groups
and health care groups especially regarding children’s health when developing, implementing
and  reviewing/updating  their  plans.  Furthermore,  Parties  are  to  integrate  the  POPs
implementation plans into their sustainable development strategies.

8. Adding more Chemicals to the Treaty (Article 8)

8.1  Article  8  governs  the  process  for  adding  chemicals  to  Annex  A,  B  or  C.  It  is  important
that groups or sub-groups of chemicals are addressed, not only individual chemicals if Parties
are to adequately address the POPs  crisis.  To  go  chemical-by-chemical  will  take  far  too  long
to prevent POPs destruction of the earth.

8.2 The process for adding chemicals to one or more of the Annexes is as follows:

(i)  A  party  may  submit  a  PROPOSAL  to  the  Secretariat  for  listing  a  chemical  in  an

Annex. The proposal must contain information specified in Annex D:

Chemical  NAMES  and  structure  AND  its  transformation  products  where  relevant;
PERSISTENCE (>2 months half-life in water OR >6 months half-life in soil, OR >6
months  half-life  in  sediment,  OR  evidence  that  the  chemical  is  sufficiently  persistent
to  justify  its  consideration);  BIO-ACCUMULATION  (bio-concentration  factor  or
bioaccumulation  factor  in  aquatic  species  is  >5,000  OR  in  absence  of  such  data,  that
the log Kow is >5, or evidence of other reasons of concern such as bioaccumulation  in
other species, high toxicity or  ecotoxicity,  OR  that  monitoring  data  in  biota  indicates
bioaccumulation potential such that its consideration is justified); POTENTIAL FOR
LONG-RANGE  ENVIRONMENTAL  TRANSPORT  (measured  levels  in  areas
distant  from  release;  OR  monitoring  data  showing  long  range  transport  may  have
occurred  via  air,  water,  or  migratory  species;  OR  environmental  properties  or  model
results  showing  that  the  chemical  has  potential  for  long  range  transport);  ADVERSE
EFFECTS  (to  human  health  or  to  the  environment  that  justifies  consideration  (note:
no need to demonstrate toxicity), OR toxicity or  ecotoxicity  data  indicating  potential
harm.

The  proposal  must  also  include  a  statement  of  the  reasons  for  concern  and  a  statement
regarding the need for global control.

22

(ii)

If  the  Secretariat  is  satisfied  that  the  information  is  sufficiently  complete,  it  forwards
the  proposal  to  a  body  called  the  POPs  REVIEW  COMMITTEE.  Pursuant  to  Article
19, paragraph 6, the Conference of Parties is to establish the  POPs Review Committee
at  its  first  meeting.  Its  members  are  to  be  appointed  by  the  Conference  of  Parties  and
consist  of  government-designated  experts  on  the  basis  of  equitable  geographic
representation.  The  Committee  is  to  adopt  recommendations  by  consensus,  unless  no
agreement  can  be  made  in  which  case  a  two-thirds  majority  can  adopt  the
recommendation.

(iii)  The  Committee  will  review  the  proposal  pursuant  to  Annex  D  and  decide  to  let  it

proceed or set it aside as insufficient regarding Annex D criteria.

(iv)  If  the  criteria  are  satisfied,  the  proposal  and  Committee  evaluation  shall  be  available
through  the  Secretariat  to  all  Parties  and  observers  inviting  them  to  submit  Annex  E
information  (Risk  profile  information  the  purpose  of  which  is  to  evaluate  if  global
action  is  warranted  as  a  result  of  long  range  transport  and  significant  adverse  effects).
The information is to include: sources - production data, locations, quantities, uses and
releases;  hazard  assessment  of  the  endpoints  of  concern  including  toxicological
interactions  with  other  chemicals;  environmental  fate;  monitoring  data;  exposure  in
local  areas;  national  and  international  risk  evaluations,  assessments  or  profiles,  hazard
classifications;  and  status  under  international  conventions.  (Note:  under  the  OSPAR,
Barcelona,  Bamako,  and  other  Conventions,  hazardous  substances  are  prohibited  or
targeted for phase out).

If  the  Committee  rejects  the  proposal  as  incomplete  regarding  Annex  D  information,  the
proposal  and  Committee  evaluation  shall  be  available,  through  the  Secretariat  to  all
PARTIES only, and the proposal shall be set aside. It may be resubmitted to the Committee.
If the Committee sets it aside again, the Party may challenge the Committee decision and let
the Conference of Parties decide.

(v)

If  the  proposal  proceeds  (per  Committee  decision  or  decision  by  the  Conference  of
Parties  in  the  event  of  a  challenge),  the  Committee  shall  prepare  a  DRAFT  RISK
PROFILE  in  accordance  with  Annex  E,  taking  into  account  the  information  already
submitted regarding Annex E. The draft risk profile shall be made available through the
Secretariat  to  all  Parties  and  observers  for  comments.  Thereafter,  the  Committee  will
complete the risk profile.

(vi)  On  the  basis  of  the  risk  profile,  the  Committee  can  decide  NOT  to  proceed  with  the
proposal.  NOTE:  LACK  OF  FULL  SCIENTIFIC  CERTAINTY  shall  not  prevent  the
proposal from proceeding. If the Committee does, however, decide not to proceed, the
risk  profile  will  be  made  available  to  all  Parties  and  observers  and  the  proposal  is  set
aside. A Party may request the Conference of Parties to instruct the Committee to invite
additional  information  during  a  period  of  up  to  one  year.  The  Committee  shall  then
reconsider  the  proposal,  and  if  set  aside  again,  the  Party  may  challenge,  and  the
Conference of Parties shall consider the issue and decide if the proposal is to remain set
aside, or proceed. If the Conference of Parties decides to proceed with the proposal, the
Committee must prepare a RISK MANAGEMENT EVALUATION.

23

If on the other hand, on the basis of the risk profile, the Committee decides to proceed with
the proposal, concluding that the chemical is likely as a result of long range transport to lead
to  significant  adverse  effects  such  that  global  action  is  warranted,  the  Committee  shall
through  the  Secretariat,  invite  all  Parties  and  observers  to  provide  information  relating  to
Annex  F.  It  shall  then  prepare  a  RISK  MANAGEMENT  EVALUATION  that  includes  an
analysis  of  possible  control  measures  in  accordance  with  Annex  F.  Annex  F  requires  an
evaluation  regarding  possible  control  measures  encompassing  the  full  range  of  options
including  management  and  elimination.  Relevant  socio-economic  information  associated
with the possible control measures is to be included.

(vii)  The  Committee  shall  make  a  recommendation,  based  on  the  risk  profile  and  the  risk
management  evaluation,  on  whether  the  chemical  should  be  considered  by  the
Conference of Parties for listing in Annex A, B, and/or C.

 (viii)  The  Conference  of  Parties  taking  account  of  the  Committee  recommendations,
including any scientific uncertainty, shall decide in a precautionary manner whether to
list the chemical, and specify its control measures, in Annexes A, B, and/or C.

9. Information Exchange and Public Information  (Article 9 and 10)

9.1  Article  9  requires  each  Party  to  designate  a  national  focal  point  for  the  exchange  of
information.  The  Parties  are  to  exchange  information  regarding  reduction  or  elimination  of
the production, use and releases of  POPs, and alternatives to  POPs. The Secretariat serves as
a clearing-house for such information provided by Parties and others including observers.

9.2 Article 9, paragraph 5 states that information on the health and safety of humans and the
environment  SHALL  NOT  BE  REGARDED  AS  CONFIDENTIAL.  And  Article  10,
paragraph  1  (b)  requires  Parties  to  promote  and  facilitate  provision  to  the  public  of  ALL
AVAILABLE  INFORMATION  ON  POPs,  taking  into  account  paragraph  5  of  article  9.
(Note: These provisions require that all  POPs release information be available to the public,
including workers since all such information is within the scope of information on health and
safety of humans and the environment.)

9.3  Article  10,  paragraph  1  (d)  also  requires  each  Party  to  promote  and  facilitate  PUBLIC
PARTICIPATION  in  addressing  POPs  and  their  effects,  and  in  developing  adequate
responses  (strategies)
level  regarding
implementation of the Convention.

including  opportunities  for

input  at  national

9.4  Article  10,  paragraph  5  states  that  each  Party  must  give  sympathetic  consideration  to
pollutant  release  and  transfer  registers  (PRTRs).  This  provision  (together  with  the  public
information provisions above) should result in the PRTR and public right-to-know legislation
as part of the implementing legislation package in each country.

24

10. Research, Development and Monitoring (Article 11)

Article  11  language  encourages  Parties  to  undertake  research,  development,  and  monitoring
related  to  POPs,  THEIR  ALTERNATIVES  and  CANDIDATE  POPs  (additional  POPs).
Paragraph 2 (e) requires Parties to make such information accessible to the public.

11. Technical Assistance (Article 12)

The Parties are to establish arrangements for technical assistance and promoting the transfer
of  technology  to  developing  country  Parties  and  Parties  with  economies  in  transition.  The
arrangements  shall  include  regional  and  subregional  centres  for  capacity  building  and
technology transfer to assist in implementing the Convention.

12. Financial Resources and Mechanisms (Article 13 and 14)

12.1  Article  13  requires  developed  country  Parties  to  provide  NEW  AND  ADDITIONAL
FINANCIAL RESOURCES to assist developing country Parties and Parties with economies
in  transition  with  implementing  the  Convention.  Paragraph  4  states  that  the  extent  to  which
developing country Parties will implement their commitments depends on developed country
Parties implementing their commitments on financial and technical assistance. The paragraph
goes on to state that sustainable economic and social development and eradication of poverty
are the first and overriding priorities of developing country Parties and that this will be taken
into account. Note:  POPs elimination is clearly an integral part of sustainable economic and
social development.

12.2  This  Article  also  establishes  a  MECHANISM  FOR  PROVIDING  FINANCIAL
RESOURCES  to  developing  country  Parties  and  Parties  with  economies  in  transition.
(paragraph  6).  The  mechanism  is  to  be  under  the  authority  of  the  Conference  of  Parties.  Its
operation shall be entrusted to one or more entities decided on by the Conference of Parties.
The  Conference  of  Parties  at  its  first  meeting  shall  adopt  guidance  for  the  mechanism,
including  guidance  relating  to  the  determination  of  policy,  strategy  AND  PROGRAMME
PRIORITIES, as well as eligibility for access to funds.

12.3  Article  14  establishes  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  as  the  interim  financial
entity  entrusted  with  the  operations  of  the  financial  mechanism  for  the  period  between  entry
into force and the first Conference of Parties. The Conference of Parties will then decide on
the entity that it wants to entrust with the operations of the financial mechanism. (Note: This
is  to  give  the  GEF  a  chance  to  prove  that  it  is  capable  of  providing  the  resources  and
conditions acceptable to developing countries and countries with economies in transition.)

13. Reporting (Article 15)

Article 15 requires Parties to report on measures taken to implement the Convention and their
effectiveness. Such reporting is to include data on total quantities (or reasonable estimates) of
production, import and export of each chemical listed in Annex A and B (intentional  POPs).
A list of states from which it imported and to which it exported each such chemical is also to
be included.

25

14. Effectiveness Evaluation (Article 16)

Four years after entry into force and periodically thereafter (to be decided by the Conference
of  Parties),  the  Conference  of  Parties  (COP)  shall  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the
Convention.  To  facilitate  this,  at  its  first  meeting,  the  COP  shall  begin  the  establishment  of
methods to provide COMPARABLE MONITORING DATA on the presence of Annex A, B
and C chemicals, and their regional and global environmental transport.

15. Non-Compliance (Article 17)

This issue is left to the COP to determine later.

16. Settlement of Disputes (Article 18)

16.1 Any dispute between Parties concerning interpretation or application of the Convention
is to be settled through NEGOTIATION or other peaceful means of the Parties choice.

16.2  When  ratifying  or  acceding  to  the  Convention,  a  Party  can  declare  in  writing  that  it
recognises  ARBITRATION  (pursuant  to  procedures  to  be  agreed  by  the  COP)  and/or
submission  of  the  dispute  to  the  International  Court  of  Justice  (ICJ)  as  compulsory  for  any
dispute in relation to any Party accepting the same.

16.3  If  a  dispute  can  not  be  settled  pursuant  to  agreement,  one  year  after  one  Party  notifies
another  about  the  dispute,  the  dispute  shall  be  submitted  to  a  CONCILIATION
COMMISSION  at  the  request  of  any  Party  involved  in  the  dispute.  The  Commission  shall
provide a report with recommendations.

17. Conference of Parties (COP) (Article 19)

The first Conference of Parties (COP) shall be held within one year of entry into force, and at
regular intervals to be decided on by the COP. At its first meeting, the COP shall adopt rules
of procedure for the COPs and financial rules for itself. The primary purpose is to keep under
continuous review and evaluation the implementation of the Convention.

18. Secretariat (Article 20)

This  Article  establishes  the  Secretariat.  The  Executive  Director  of  UNEP  is  the  designated
Secretariat unless the COP by three-fourths majority decides otherwise. The functions include
organising  meetings  of  the  COP  and  its  subsidiary  bodies  (e.g.,  the  POPs  Review
Committee),  facilitating  with  implementation,  coordination  with  other  secretariats  of
international  bodies,  preparing  reports  based  on  the  information  received  from  Parties  and
others, and undertaking other functions entrusted to it by the COP.

26

19. Amendment of the Convention  (Article 21)

19.1  Only  the  COP  can  adopt  amendments  to  the  Convention.  Any  Party  may  make  a
proposal  for  amendment.  It  is  to  be  distributed  by  the  Secretariat  to  all  Parties  at  least  six
months in advance of a meeting for its adoption. Parties are to agree by CONSENSUS, and if
that  is  not  possible,  by  a  THREE-FOURTH  MAJORITY  VOTE  (of  Parties  present  and
voting; abstentions are not counted).

19.2 Entry Into Force: An adopted amendment must be ratified, accepted or approved by at
least  three-fourths  of  the  Parties  for  it  to  enter  into  force.  Only  those  Parties  ratifying  or
accepting the amendment are bound to it.

20. Adoption and Amendment of Annexes (Article 22)

20.1 Additional Annexes: Any Party may propose an additional annex. Such proposal is to be
communicated to all Parties by the Secretariat at least six months before the meeting at which
it is to be considered. It is to be agreed by consensus and if not possible then by three-fourths
majority vote (present and voting negative or positive).

20.2 Entry into Force: Additional annexes enter into force by ‘tacit consent”. On the expiry of
one  year  from  the  date  of  the  communication  by  the  depositary  (UN)  of  the  adoption  of  the
additional  annex,  the  annex  shall  enter  into  force  for  all  Parties  that  have  not  submitted  a
notification  that  they  reject  it.  In  order  not  to  be  bound,  a  Party  may  reject  it  by  written
notification  to  the  depositary  within  one  year  from  the  date  of  communication  by  the
depositary of the adoption of the additional annex.

20.3 Amendments to Annexes A, B or C: The same procedure as the proposal (six months),
adoption  (consensus  or  three-fourths  majority  vote)  and  entry  into  force  (tacit  consent)  of
additional  annexes,  governs  the  proposal,  adoption  and  entry  into  force  of  amendments  to
Annexes A, B and C EXCEPT that such amendment (e.g., adding more chemicals) does not
enter  into  force  for  a  Party  that  makes  a  declaration  pursuant  to  Article  25,  paragraph  4.
Article  25,  paragraph  4  allows  a  country  to  declare  in  its  instrument  of  ratification  or
accession,  that any amendment to Annexes A, B or C shall enter into force only upon deposit
of an instrument of ratification or accession with respect to that amendment. This provision is
legally  unnecessary  since  a  Party  may  (by  written  notice)  reject  any  such  additional  POP
amendment  within  one  year  of  the  official  notice  of  the  adoption  of  the  amendment  in
question. Subsequently, when a Party is in a position to accept the amendment, it can simply
withdraw  the  notice  of  un-acceptance.  The  optional  provision  in  Article  25  requiring  each
additional chemical to be ratified was the unfortunate result of a few industrial countries that
apparently do not want to draw attention to themselves when they do not want to protect the
environment and human health from an additional POP agreed by the Parties. The provision
is  more designed for quietly prolonging or protecting the continued use of persistent organic
pollutants,  than  protecting  human  health  across  generations  as  agreed  by  the  Parties.  The
effective  success  of  the  POPs  treaty  would  be  threatened  if  countries  had  to  go  through
ratification  of  every  additional  POP.  Consequently,  it  is  recommended  that  countries  do  not
exercise  this  legally  unnecessary  provision  contained  in  Article  25,  since  they  always  have
the option of rejecting an amendment by written notification.
