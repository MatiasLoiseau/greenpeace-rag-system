The testing of the various components in these laptops found;

•  The  actual  levels  of  bromine  in  discrete  types  of  samples  (i.e.

very frequently found in the boards tested, with the exception

of the Sony laptops (detected in only 1 of 6 types of board) and

to a lesser extent Toshiba (detected in 2 of 5 types of board).

For  both  brands  the  motherboards  did  not  contain  bromine

at  detectable  levels.    These  results  indicate  that  the  use  of

‘bromine-free’ circuit boards is possible across a wide range of

applications.

•  For all Dell, Apple, Acer and HP laptops, almost all of the tested

boards  contained  bromine,  including  all  the  motherboards.

similar  ranges  of  concentrations  were  seen  across  these  four

does presents its own waste management problems by acting

as a source of organic-bound chlorine to the waste stream, as

well as raising additional concerns at other points in its lifecycle.

Furthermore, the use of PVC in certain applications requires the

use of additive chemicals, such as phthalate esters (phthalates)

commonly used as plasticisers (softeners).

applicable in a fraction of countries where these products are sold.

Though they have brought changes outside the EU and China, they

do not prevent the sale in other countries of products that contain

even the limited number of hazardous chemicals that they regulate,

as has been recently demonstrated in other similar investigations.

There  remains  a  need  for  suitable  regulation  of  these  and  other

electrical and electronic products in all countries in which they are

placed on the market in order to provide safeguards to consumers

and enable safe and consistent recycling practices.

As they stand, even the laws in force in the EU and China do not

regulate the use of all hazardous substances that can be present in

electrical/electronic  equipment.    As  this  study  has  demonstrated,

such  products  can  contain  additional  hazardous  substances  to

those  currently  covered  under  these  laws  (e.g.  other  BFRs,  PVC

and  phthalates).    Other  recent  studies  have  highlighted  potential

impacts that can arise from the use of BFRs that are currently not

included in legislation within the EU or other countries, including the

exposure of recycling workers to deca-BDE leading to the highest

levels  yet  reported  in  humans13,  and  potential  environmental

impacts due to the recycling and disposal of products containing

other  currently  unregulated  BFRs11.  Any  legislation  seeking  to

protect  human  health  and  the  environment  by  restricting  the  use

of  hazardous  chemicals  in  products  must  ultimately  address  all

hazardous substances.

Elimination  of  all  hazardous  chemicals  in  laptops  computers

and  other  electrical  and  electronic  equipment  can  be  achieved

through  national  legislation  and/or  self  imposed  commitments  by

manufacturers.  Experience in the EU relating to other hazardous

chemicals has recognised that the implementation of voluntary or

negotiated measures is most effective when driven by the promise

of future regulation.  This has certainly been the case for the RoHS

Directive, which had an over-riding influence on the use of materials

in laptops well beyond the EU even before its formal entry into force

in July 2006.

There is growing awareness of the use of hazardous chemicals in

consumer goods, particularly with regard to electrical and electronic

equipment such as computers.  Concerns exist over the potential

for  exposure  to  hazardous  chemicals,  as  well  as  impacts  on  the

environment,  during  the  manufacture,  use  and  disposal  of  such

products.  Unless the use of hazardous chemicals and materials is

phased out, the potential for impacts from their use is likely to rise

as worldwide the production of such goods continues to increase,

and  product  lifespans  decrease.    This  is  reflected  in  the  already

large, and rapidly increasing amounts of electronic waste (e-waste)

arising from this sector.

The EU’s RoHS Directive
and other equivalent
legislation4

The European Directive on the restriction of the use of certain

hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment,

or  the  RoHS  Directive  (Directive  2002/95),  entered  into

force on July 1st 2006.  The Directive prohibits, with certain

exemption, the placing on the market within the EU of such

equipment if it contains more than regulated amounts of lead,

mercury,  cadmium  and  hexavalent  chromium  (chromium

(VI)), or of two types of brominated flame retardants, namely

polybrominated  biphenyls

(PBBs)  and  polybrominated

diphenyl  ethers  (PBDEs,  other  than  the  decabrominated

congener  BDE-209).    Maximum  allowable  limit  values  are

set  at  0.1%  by  mass  of  homogenous  materials  for  all  but

Closely related Chinese legislation, the ‘Administration on the

it is to be expected that the introduction of legislation in one region,

or  possibly  even  one  country,  will  have  impacts  on  the  nature  of

products sold in other countries.

regulated chemicals.  Additional differences exist between the

Chinese and EU legislations.  For example, under the Chinese

legislation, maximum allowable limit values apply to individual

components  not  to  homogenous  materials,  and  there  are

currently no exemptions under the Chinese legislation.

In  Japan,  legislation  commonly  referred  to  as  ‘J-MOSS’  has

required the labelling, since 1st July 2006, of certain electrical

products that contain the same substances that are regulated

under the EU RoHS Directive.

The  national  laws  identified  above  do  not  currently  regulate

the  use  of  all  brominated  flame  retardants,  nor  the  use  of

phthalates  or  PVC  in  electrical  and  electronic  equipment.    In

addition to these national regulations, other similar measures

have been introduced in other jurisdictions around the world.



This  study  was  carried  out  to  investigate  the  presence  of  certain

hazardous chemicals in laptop computers sold both in EU countries,

and other countries around the world, following the introduction of

the EU regulations.  The presence of certain hazardous substances

was  investigated  in  a  wide  variety  of  internal  and  external

components from each laptop.  The specific hazardous substances

investigated in this study include;

•  Heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent

chromium)

•  Bromine content, to indicate the use of brominated flame

retardants (BFRs)

•  Four specific brominated flame retardants (BFRs)

•  PVC (polyvinyl chloride)

•  Phthalates esters (phthalates)

The range of substances included in this study were based in part

on  substances  controlled  under  recently  introduced  legislation  in

the EU and China which regulate specific hazardous chemicals in

electrical  equipment;  the  EU  RoHS  Directive  and  similar  Chinese

legislation (see Textbox on page 9).  In addition to the hazardous

chemicals  included  in  these  laws,  this  study  included  a  survey  of

plastic coatings of cables and wiring for the presence or absence

of the plastic PVC.  Certain plastic materials were also analysed for

phthalate esters (phthalates), chemicals widely used as plasticisers

(softeners) in plastics, especially PVC.

Phthalates are a group of chemicals possessing similar structures,

than  other  forms  of  chromium.    It  has  been  used  in  electronics

many of which are widely used as plasticizers (softeners) in plastics,

primarily for corrosion protection of metallic surfaces.  Hexavalent

the surrounding environment.  Many phthalates are toxic to wildlife

and  humans,  often  through  their  metabolites  (chemicals  to  which

they  breakdown  in  the  body).    Some  widely  used  phthalates  are

known to be toxic to reproduction, capable of causing changes to

both male and female reproductive systems in mammals12.

Mercury (Hg) is a highly toxic metal that has been used in various

applications  in  electrical  products.  Exposure  can  cause  health

effects  including  damage  to  the  central  nervous  system  and

kidneys.  Once in the environment, mercury can be converted into

compounds  which  are  highly  bioaccumulative  as  well  as  being

toxic, even at very low levels of exposure8.

Cadmium (Cd) has been used in a number of applications within

electronics products, both as a metal and as cadmium compounds.

This toxic metal can accumulate in the body over time, with long-

term exposure causing damage to the kidneys and bone structure.

Cadmium and its compounds are also known human carcinogens9.

Brominated flame retardants (BFRs); there is potentially a very

wide range of brominated chemicals that can be used as BFRs10.

Commonly  used  examples  include  polybrominated  diphenyl

ethers (PBDEs) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), as well

as  brominated  polymeric  and  oligomeric  materials.    Some  BFRs,

including certain PBDEs, have known toxic properties, and some

are highly persistent in the environment and able to bioaccumulate

(build up in animals and humans).  In whatever form the bromine is

present, impacts can result at the product’s end of life as a result

of  the  unintentional  formation  of  toxic  brominated  byproducts

(including dioxins) during some disposal or recycling operations11.

absence of specific substances was investigated in a wide variety

of  internal  and  external  components  (casing,  touch  mouse  pads,

cables,  circuit  boards,  chips,  connectors,  insulators,  etc.).    The

specific analyses carried out in this study include;

•  Lead in solder: 10 individual samples of electrical solder

were separated from different components within each laptop

(e.g. motherboard, DVD drive circuit board) and subsequently

analysed for their lead content, as well as the content of other

metals reportedly used in electrical solders5.

•  Phthalates: 2 of the materials from each laptop that were

tested for PVC content were further analysed for a range of

phthalates.  These materials were the plastic coating of an

external cable and an internal ribbon cable.

In making the sample selections, every effort was made to include

examples  of  as  many  as  possible  of  the  diverse  materials  and

components present within the laptops.  As it was not possible to

purchase identical models in all countries for Acer and HP laptops,

.3 X-ray microanalysis (XRF)

Each sample for analysis was placed in an EDAX Energy Dispersive

X-Ray  Fluorescence  (XRF)  instrument  at  room  temperature,  and

analysed for the surface concentrations of bromine (Br), cadmium

(Cd),  lead  (Pb)  and  mercury  (Hg).    The  instrumentation  employed

offers greater accuracy and precision than use of related hand-held

XRF instruments.

XRF  analysis  determines  the  concentration  of  bromine,  and  other

elements, in the surface layer of a material.  The thickness of the

surface  that  is  analysed  by  this  method  depends  on  the  nature

of  the  material  being  tested.    For  some  materials  (e.g.  metallic

surfaces)  only  a  very  thin  surface  layer  will  be  analysed,  while  for

other materials, including many plastics, the analysis will penetrate

to a greater depth.  For some non-homogeneous materials, such

as  circuit  boards  with  multiple  different  layers,  it  is  possible  that

metallic components within the material can block the analysis of

other materials below.  For each circuit board sample, XRF analysis

was carried out at a site that did not contain copper, which might

block the analysis of material below.

For circuit boards, an additional investigation was carried out into

the potential for copper at the XRF test site to inhibit analysis of the

bromine concentration in the material.  Four circuit board samples

were analysed by both surface XRF testing and also by analysis of

the  ground  and  homogenized  material  (each  sample  was  ground

to a fine powder which was thoroughly mixed and then subjected

to XRF analysis).  This analysis was carried out on 2 circuit boards

at  sites  where  copper  was  present  (confirmed  by  surface  XRF

analysis),  and  2  circuit  boards  at  sites  where  copper  was  not

present (confirmed by surface XRF analysis).

Of  all  samples  tested  by  XRF,  three  materials  consistently

The results from the range of analyses carried out on the various

components  from  the  18  laptops  are  discussed  in  the  following

sections.  It is important to note that these data relate only to those

materials and components tested, which were a fraction of the very

large number of materials and components within each laptop.  The

absence of a certain chemical in all samples tested from a laptop

does not indicate that the laptop is entirely free of that chemical.

3. Hexavalent chromium (Cr VI)

Qualitative  colorimetric  analysis  of  between  8  and  10  internal

metallic  components  from  each  laptop  did  not  detect  hexavalent

chromium  (VI)  in  any  of  the  samples.    The  analytical  method

employed is able to detect the presence of hexavalent chromium

at  levels  significantly  below  0.1%  by  weight.    All  samples  tested

for hexavalent chromium from all laptops were therefore compliant

with EU and Chinese regulations.

electrical/electronic equipment contained polybrominated

phased  out  for  some  time.    Hexabromocyclododecane

(HBCD)  is  another  commonly  used  additive  brominated

flame retardant, especially in expanded polystyrene, which

can be readily extracted if present.

PBDEs  are  a  group  of  related  chemicals  differing  in  the

amount and arrangement of bromine within each molecule.

The  most  commonly  used  in  modern  electronics  is  deca-

BDE (BDE-209), often referred to as simply ‘deca’.  A recent

study13 has demonstrated the potential for human exposure

to deca-BDE and other PBDEs as a result of the recycling

and  disposal  of  electronic  wastes,  resulting  in  the  highest

levels  of  deca-BDE  to  be  reported  in  humans.      PBBs  are

a similar group of chemicals based on a different molecular

backbone.  HBCD is also a group of related chemicals, each

with the same degree of bromination but arranged differently

within the molecule.  TBBPA is a single individual chemical.

Some  BFRs,  including  certain  PBDEs  and  PBBs,  have

known  toxic  properties,  and  some  are  highly  persistent

in  the  environment  and  able  to  bioaccumulate  (build  up

in animals and humans).  In whatever form the bromine is

present, impacts can result at the product’s end of life as

a result of the unintentional formation of toxic brominated

byproducts  (including  dioxins)  during  some  disposal  or

recycling operations11.

There is potentially a very wide range of brominated chemicals that

can  be  used  as  brominated  flame  retardants.    This  investigation

focussed on certain classes of brominated chemicals due to their

common usage as flame retardants, namely PBDEs, PBBs, TBBPA

and HBCD (see text box to the left).

Due to resource limitations, it was possible to only quantify these

brominated  flame  retardants  in  a  relatively  small  number  of  the

materials that were found to contain bromine.  Where available, a

ribbon cable (#16) and a pin connector socket from the motherboard

(#25),  were  analysed  from  one  laptop  of  each  brand.  These

materials  were  selected  in  recognition  of  their  consistently  high

bromine  content  across  all  brands.    Samples  from  two  separate

Apple  laptops  (LTOP06  and  LTOP09)  were  analysed  due  to  the

very different levels of bromine that were found in the ribbon cables

(sample 16) of the identical laptop models that had been purchased

in different countries.

In addition, BFRs were quantified in three mouse touchpads.  This

component was selected as it was the only component tested by

XRF that had consistently high bromine levels in all laptops of only one

of the brands investigated (Apple).  In one of the three Dell laptops

(LTOP01),  and  the  Toshiba  laptop  (LTOP18),  this  component  also

contained bromine at a detectable level by XRF analysis, though at

much lower levels, particularly for the Toshiba laptop.

The samples that were quantified for extractable BFRs, and those

samples  in  which  extractable  BFRs  were  found  are  presented  in

Table  9,  along  with  the  surface  levels  of  bromine  as  determined

by  XRF  analysis.    For  those  samples  in  which  extractable  BFRs

were identified, a breakdown of the type of BFRs identified and their

concentrations in the samples is given in Table 10.

Table 10. Summary of the groups of extractable BFRs, and their concentrations, in those samples in which extractable BFRs were identified; ‘-‘ indicates

no BFRs identified above method detection limits

Greenpeace l Research Laboratories Technical Note l September 2007 l 33

Of  the  three  mouse  touchpads  (#01)  analysed,  extractable  BFRs

were  identified  in  only  the  component  from  the  Apple  laptop

(LTOP09).    PBDEs  were  present  at  low  levels  in  this  sample,

including  deca-BDE  (BDE-209)  at  12.2  mg/kg  and  nona-BDEs

at  1.87  mg/kg.    This  component  also  contained  the  brominated

chemical TBBPA at a higher concentration of 125 mg/kg.

Of  the  ribbon  cables  (#16)  analysed,  the  compound  TBBPA  was

identified  in  the  Dell  laptop  (LTOP01)  and  both  Apple  laptops

(LTOP06  &  LTOP09).    No  extractable  BFRs  were  identified  in  this

component for the Acer, HP or Toshiba laptops.  The highest level

of TBBPA was found in this component from the Dell laptop, at 242

mg/kg.    Of  the  two  Apple  laptops,  a  higher  level  of  TBBPA  was

present in the laptop purchased in the USA (LTOP09) compared to

that purchased in the Philippines (LTOP06).  The same pattern was

seen for the total bromine levels in these materials as determined

by XRF analysis; 6.8% and 2.2% respectively.

For all laptops tested, the pin connector socket (#25) did not contain

detectable levels of the extractable BFRs quantified.

Deca-BDE and TBBPA are not included amongst the BFRs regulated

under the EU RoHS directive.  This Directive does restrict the use of

PBDEs, though deca-BDE is specifically exempted.  Other BDEs,

including nona-BDEs, are regulated under this legislation.  However,

a maximum allowable limit for BFRs, including nona-BDE, is set at

1000 mg/kg (0.1%) in homogeneous materials, far higher than the

levels detected in the mouse touchpad from the Apple laptop.

Where present in the components tested, the low concentrations of

both PBDEs and TBBPA are highly unlikely to provide sufficient flame

retardancy alone for the plastic material from which the components

are constructed.  Furthermore, XRF analysis has demonstrated that

these components contained far higher total surface bromine levels

(between  0.54%  and  6.8%  ,  or  5400–68000  mg/kg)  than  could

be explained by the concentrations of these extractable chemicals

alone.  Therefore the bulk of the bromine content (assuming surface

concentrations  are  indicative  of  concentrations  throughout  the

material)  must  result  from  the  presence  of  brominated  chemicals

other than those specifically quantified in this study.

of  unreacted  TBBPA  resulting  from  its  use  in  reactive  mode.    In

this  case,  the  majority  of  the  bromine  would  be  bound  up  in  the

polymeric  material  and  could  not  be  extracted  and  quantified  by

the  methods  employed.    This  alone  could  account  for  the  large

differences between the levels of extractable TBBPA and the total

levels of bromine in these materials, though the possible presence

of other oligomeric or polymeric forms of organic bromine cannot

be ruled out.

For  all  the  above  compounds,  though  the  levels  in  the  samples

were not quantified, data indicate that they were present at relatively

low  concentrations,  of  a  similar  or  lower  magnitude  to  the  levels

of  TBBPA  and  PBDEs  identified  in  other  samples.    It  is  unlikely,

therefore, that they too could account for the majority of the bromine

content detected in these samples by the XRF analyses.

information by analysis is likely to remain very difficult, such that the

only option may ultimately be to request such information from the

component manufacturers themselves.

Of  all  internal  wires  and  external  cables  tested  (#31  #36)  for  all

laptops, 44% tested positive for PVC in the plastic coating (48 out

of 108 materials).

For  each  brand,  the  average  number  of  materials  that  tested

positive for PVC per laptop was similar; between 2 and 3 materials

for  the  Dell,  Sony,  Apple  and  Acer  brands,  while  the  HP  and

Toshiba brands had an average of 4 materials per laptop.  However,

within  each  brand,  the  number  of  materials  that  tested  positive

varied  between  individual  laptops,  with  the  exception  of  the  two

Sony laptops.  For example, in one HP laptop (LTOP17) only two

materials tested positive, while in another HP laptop (LTOP15) five

materials tested positive.

There  were  generally  no  clear  and  consistent  patterns  in  the

number and type of materials that tested positive for PVC between

different brands, or even between laptops of the same brand.  The

only exception was the Sony brand; in both laptops the same two

materials contained PVC (inner and outer coatings of the cable from

the dc power transformer), while all other materials did not.

3  l Greenpeace l Research Laboratories Technical Note l September 2007

The material that most commonly tested positive for PVC was the

outer plastic coating of the cable from the DC power transformer

(in all laptops other than the Apple laptops and one Acer laptop).

However, for this Acer laptop and 3 of the 4 Apple laptops, the inner

plastic  coating  of  this  cable  did  test  positive  for  PVC.    This  inner

coating material also tested positive in many of the other laptops.

Individual laptops were purchased in different countries and regions.

Considering all laptops of all brands together, there were no clear

relationship between the country or region in which the laptop was

purchased and the number / type of materials that tested positive

for  PVC.    For  example,  the  Dell  laptop  purchased  in  Germany

contained the most PVC positive results for all Dell laptops, while

the Apple laptop also purchased in an EU country (the Netherlands)

contained the least PVC positive results for all Apple laptops.

However,  for  each  of  the  materials  of  which  samples  from  some

laptops  showed  the  presence  of  PVC,  equivalent  samples  from

other laptops showed a non-PVC containing material being used.

This illustrates that, for these applications, it is not essential for PVC

to be used.

Although  PVC  does  not  have  direct  toxicity,  this  plastic  does

presents its own manufacturing and waste management problems

by  acting  as  a  source  of  organic-bound  chlorine  to  the  waste

stream,  as  well  as  raising  additional  concerns  at  other  points  in

its  lifecycle.    Furthermore,  the  use  of  PVC  in  certain  applications

requires  the  use  of  additive  chemicals,  such  as  phthalate  esters

(phthalates) used as plasticisers (softeners).

the  cable  coating  contained  a  similar  total  level  of  phthalates  to

those in the other PVC-coated cables provided with Acer laptops,

but  the  mixture  consisted  almost  exclusively  of  DEHP,  the  most

toxic of the three main phthalates identified in these materials.  For

the other Acer laptops in which the material did contain PVC, DEHP

was a minor constituent of the phthalate mixture.

For the coating of the power transformer cables, the use of PVC-

amounts  of  phthalates.    The  use  of  other  alternative  PVC-free

materials  that  do  not  require  plasticisers  could  have  eliminated

the  need  for  phthalates  altogether.    Disappointingly,  for  the  one

Acer  model  in  which  a  PVC  based  material  was  not  used,  the

alternative material contained a very high concentration of the more

toxic  phthalate  (DEHP).    This  example  illustrates  that,  although

PVC  may  be  eliminated  in  these  flexible  applications,  it  does  not

necessarily  mean  that  the  plasticizers  commonly  used  for  flexible

components, compositional analysis of all individual homogeneous

materials in such a product is an extremely large task.  It is possible

that  some  components  or  materials  which  were  not  tested  may

contain  one  or  more  of  the  chemicals  investigated  in  this  study.

Therefore, for each laptop, the absence of a chemical in all samples

analysed  does  not  indicate  that  the  laptop  is  entirely  free  of  that

chemical.    Furthermore,  each  of  the  brands  includes  a  range  of

different  products  available  on  the  market.    The  results  from  this

study are applicable to the specific models tested for each brand,

and  may  not  reflect  the  use  of  certain  chemicals  in  the  brand  as

a  whole.    These  issues  highlight  the  great  difficulties  in  verifying

that any individual product, or brand as a whole, is entirely free of

a specific chemical, and hence whether or not a whole product is

compliant with EU RoHS, or equivalent, regulations.

Nevertheless, this study into the presence of hazardous chemicals

in laptop computers has revealed valuable information.

•  The data provide a unique comparison of the composition of

a wide range of components and materials from 18 laptop

computers representing 6 separate brands, and available for

purchase in many countries around the world.

•  Of all the brands analysed, the Sony laptops gave by far the

lowest number of samples testing positive for bromine (4

per laptop).  There was little relative difference between the

other brands for the overall frequency with which bromine

was detected in components tested; the Dell laptops yielded

the greatest number of positives (14-16 per laptop), the HP

models had the least (11-12 samples per laptop).

•  However, for those components and materials that contained

bromine, the actual levels of bromine in many types of samples

(i.e. discrete materials or components) did vary between

laptops of the same brand, as well as between laptops of

different brands.

•  There were no universal differences between the brands for

the presence and levels of bromine across all components

and materials tested.  Although differences between brands

were apparent for some individual components, these patterns

were not consistent across all component types.  However,

the Sony laptops did stand out from the other brands;

due  to  legislation  in  some  countries,  particularly  the  EU  RoHS

Directive, impacting more broadly on a globalised industry.  All of

the samples tested from all laptops of all brands were compliant

with the EU RoHS directive, whether purchased with the EU or in

non-EU countries.  Furthermore, even though legislation in China

came  into  force  after  the  purchase  date  of  these  laptops,  all

samples from the laptops purchased in China would comply with

the legislation if this type of product were to be listed as requiring

Elimination  of  all  hazardous  chemicals  in  laptops  computers

and  other  electrical  and  electronic  equipment  can  be  achieved

through  national  legislation  and/or  self  imposed  commitments  by

manufacturers.    Experience  in  the  UK  and  EU  relating  to  other

hazardous  chemicals  has  recognised  that  the  implementation  of

voluntary or negotiated measures is most effective when driven by

the promise of future regulation.
