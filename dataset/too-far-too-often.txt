TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 3
Executive Summary
In December 2014, the Dallas, Texas-based company Energy 
Transfer Partners, L .P  . (ETP) applied for permitting to build the 
$3 .78 billion Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) . The pipeline was 
to carry crude oil from the Bakken shale oil field in northwest 
North Dakota, through North and South Dakota and Iowa, 
to an oil storage and transport facility in Illinois . By the fall 
of 2016, the controversial project had gained international 
attention and notoriety  .
“Too Far Too Often” details the unethical and inappropriate 
tactics employed by ETP and related companies against 
opponents of DAPL, and highlights how, in spite of increased 
global scrutiny and intense criticism of ETP’s tactics at 
Standing Rock to intimidate and quash opposition, ETP 
continues to apply many of the same tactics and to display the 
kind of corporate behaviour that directly contributed to the 
controversy  . ETP’s repeated use of these intimidation tactics 
means that the company and its financial backers risk facing 
similar controversies in other current and future projects .
Additional information and detail can be found in the relevant 
sections of the full report  .
Violating Indigenous  
Sovereignty and Rights
||DAPL was approved without meeting international 
standards of free, prior, and informed consent of the 
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe .2 For additional context see the 
section called “Tactic 1: Violating Indigenous Sovereignty 
and Rights” in the report  .
||The company ignored calls for a voluntary halt in 
construction by the U  .S . Departments of Justice, the U  .S . 
Department of Interior, and the Army as controversy and 
questions around appropriate levels of assessment and 
due diligence arose in early fall 2016 .3 
||Dakota Access bulldozed an area of the pipeline corridor 
filled with Tribal sacred sites and burials . Documented in 
a UN report, a Sioux elder and cultural leader reported 
damage to at least 380 cultural and sacred sites along the 
pipeline route .4 Use of Intimidation and Threats  
to Free Speech
||Water Protectors and individuals opposing DAPL faced 
excessive force,5 arbitrary arrests,6 and lawsuits . For 
additional information about the use of force and 
intimidation, see sections called “Tactic 2: Silencing Free 
Speech with Intimidation” and “Tactic 4: Enabling Violence 
Against Communities” in the full report  .
INTIMIDATION THROUGH LITIGATION  
AGAINST PIPELINE OPPONENTS
||ETP and its related companies use SLAPP suits to attempt 
to silence and intimidate opposition . This included suing 
the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman and Tribal 
Councilman and several others “seeking restraining orders 
and unspecified monetary damages . ”7 
||After construction of DAPL was complete, in fall 2017, 
ETP filed a $900 million SLAPP suit against Greenpeace 
entities, Banktrack, and the movement, Earth First!, 
accusing the organizations of inciting and directing acts 
of “eco-terrorism . ”8 
||Arbitrary arrests and anti-free-speech lawsuits have 
become more commonplace across the sector in efforts to 
shut down pipeline opposition . However, ETP’s extreme 
use of litigation, including the use of RICO claims and high 
damages, could set a dangerous new precedent and have 
a chilling effect on the ability of individuals, communities, 
and organizations to vocalize and demonstrate opposition 
to future projects . See the section called “Tactic 2: 
Silencing Free Speech with Intimidation” for additional 
information .
RISE OF ANTI-PROTEST BILLS
||Following the controversy around the Dakota Access 
Pipeline, a series of more than 60 bills9 was introduced 
across the country restricting the right to protest 
and criminalizing protest, potentially deterring First 
Amendment-protected free speech activity  .10 See the 
section entitled “Tactic 3: Criminalizing Protest with Unjust 
Laws” for a detailed look at these new proposed bills .“ The world is watching what is happening in North Dakota . ”
Mr. Alvaro Pop Ac, Chair of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, August 31, 20161

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 4||ETP has directly supported11 at least one bill (in Iowa) 
through in-state lobbying efforts . It has likely influenced 
and/or supported some of these efforts through financial 
campaign contributions, a network of revolving-door 
lobbyists and government insiders, and its connection with 
the American Legislative Exchange Council12 . For more 
information about ETP’s link to these lobbying efforts, see 
the subsection “ETP , ALEC, and Anti-Protest bills . ” 
Concerns with Private  
Security Contractors
||ETP continues to work with private security companies, 
including TigerSwan, which used excessive force and 
military-style counterterrorism measures against Water 
Protectors13 and operated without a license during the 
events at Standing Rock  .14 See the section called  
“Tactic 4: Enabling Violence Against Communities”  
for additional information . 
||The activities of private security employees during that 
time raise questions about the level of due diligence 
exercised by ETP and its contractors, including TigerSwan, 
in assessing the suitability and providing oversight of 
persons hired for these situations .15 
||Despite numerous controversies and criticism of 
TigerSwan’s operation and behavior, ETP continues to have 
ties with TigerSwan, which provides services on projects 
in other states, like the Mariner East 2 pipeline project 
in Pennsylvania .16 For additional information, see the 
subsection entitled “TigerSwan in Other States . ”
Seizing Private Property
||ETP and related companies are aggressively seizing private 
property through eminent domain proceedings in all 
of their current major pipeline projects — Bayou Bridge, 
Bakken (DAPL, ETCO), ME2, and the Rover Pipeline .17 
||Private landowners are challenging the legality of the 
property seizure .18 For additional information refer to the 
section “Tactic 5: Seizing Private Property” in the full report  .Spills, Fines, and Safety Concerns
||Pipelines operated by ETP and its related company, 
Sunoco, and their subsidiaries, spilled hazardous liquids 
527 times from 2002 to the end of 2017 — an average of one 
incident every 11 days .19 
||Sixty-seven of the spills were reported to have 
contaminated water, including 18 incidents that 
contaminated groundwater, and more than 100 of the 
incidents involved 50 barrels or more . The spills caused an 
estimated $115 million in property damage .20 
||ETP has been subject to hundreds of enforcement actions 
and fined more than $355 million since 2000 .21 See the 
section called “Dirty Pipelines: Spills and Safety Concerns” 
for additional information .
ETP’s unwillingness or inability to learn the necessary 
lessons from DAPL should raise concerns among the 
company’s institutional financiers, who continue to be 
exposed to the reputational and financial impacts of  
ETP’s unacceptable practices .
Therefore, and in light of ETP’s ongoing approach to human 
rights and its poor record on pipeline spills and safety, banks 
should end any current financial relationship with ETP and 
related companies, and should not provide any further 
financial services, including loans, to the companies .

Introduction
The $3.78 billion Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) project became notorious as a display of 
abuses, oversight omissions, and unethical corporate tactics, which led to construction 
delays and to intense national and international scrutiny and criticism of the project. As 
events unfolded on the ground at Standing Rock, the behavior of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P . 
(ETP), the company behind the pipeline, attracted global attention to the story of individuals 
standing up to the company and opposing DAPL as a serious environmental and financial risk. 
Although DAPL construction was completed in 2017 and the 
pipeline is currently in operation, the controversy around 
the project will have lasting repercussions . Despite the 
international criticism following the events at Standing Rock, 
and efforts made by financial institutions, international 
agencies, and others to evaluate and investigate the issues 
that arose around DAPL, ETP largely refuses to address and 
remedy many of its corporate failures . Instead, the company 
is attributing blame to pipeline opponents and is choosing to 
instigate legal actions intended to suppress peaceful protests . 
Worryingly for ETP’s shareholders and funders, this report 
shows that in its other pipeline projects ETP is engaging in 
the same corporate behavior and employing many of the 
same tactics that directly contributed to the controversy at Standing Rock  . ETP’s continuing use of these intimidation 
tactics means that the company and its financial backers risk 
facing similar controversies in the near future .
“Too Far Too Often” is written for financial institutions 
investing in and/or lending to ETP and related companies . It 
details the tactics that ETP employed in its handling of DAPL, 
and highlights how the company continues to employ these 
unacceptable practices on other projects . In that context, we 
recommend that financial institutions should end any current 
financial relationship with ETP and related companies and 
should not provide any financial services, including loans, to 
such companies in the future .

Tactic 1: Violating Indigenous 
Sovereignty and Rights
Throughout the DAPL permitting and construction process, ETP and regulators faced repeated 
criticism and legal challenges for failure to follow due diligence in their consultation with the 
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and failure to respect sovereign rights. Significantly, the project 
was undertaken without the international standards of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) 
of the Indigenous community.22 
The Pipeline Route
The Dakota Access Pipeline begins near the border with 
Canada in northwest North Dakota in the Bakken shale oil 
fields, and runs underground 1,172 miles through South 
Dakota and Iowa to an oil storage and transport depot near 
Patoka, Illinois . Early plans in 2014 involved routing the 
pipeline across the Missouri River about ten miles north of 
the city of Bismarck, North Dakota . But when the U  .S . Army 
Corps of Engineers (whose eventual approval was required 
for critical parts of the pipeline route) evaluated that routing 
option, it concluded that it was not viable for several 
reasons, including the potential threat the pipeline would 
pose to municipal water supplies in Bismarck,23 which has a 
largely non-Indigenous population .24 
Later in 2014 before submitting the project application to 
the North Dakota Public Service Commission for necessary 
approval, the ETP subsidiary Dakota Access, LLC, itself 
changed the proposed pipeline route .25 Instead of crossing the 
Missouri River north of Bismarck, the pipeline would cross the 
river a half-mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation .
Although the pipeline does not go directly through the 
Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, it crosses through 
historic unceded treaty lands recognized as belonging to 
the Great Sioux Nation, including the Standing Rock Sioux 
Tribe, as part of the Fort Laramie Treaties of 1851 and 1868 .  
Historically the U  .S . government and corporations have 
followed a pattern of breaching Treaty agreements, and the 
DAPL process was no exception .26 
The routing change meant direct impacts on Indigenous 
communities, and potential violations of their land and water 
rights . The route takes the pipeline across the Missouri River 
upriver of the Tribe’s water intakes, and runs 100 feet under 
the Lake Oahe reservoir — the primary source of drinking 
water for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe .27 A pipeline spill could 
leave the Tribe with limited or no access to potable water  .28 The pipeline route area through the Treaty land also 
includes “numerous documented sacred sites and burial 
grounds, and serves as the source of subsistence, food, 
water, medicine, culture, religion, and life for tens of 
thousands of indigenous people . ”29 
No “Free Prior and Informed Consent”
Increasingly in recent years, international norms and laws 
have evolved to protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples 
— including their right to give or withhold “free, prior, 
and informed consent” (FPIC) to development projects 
that impact their land, health, or cultures .30 The 2007 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples upholds this FPIC right: “States shall consult 
and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples 
concerned in order to obtain their free, prior and informed 
consent before adopting and implementing legislative 
or administrative measures that may affect them . ”31 In 
addition, “a variety of non-legal but influential sources, 
such as the lending policies of multilateral banks and 
multi-stakeholder codes of conduct, have articulated the 
expectation that companies obtain FPIC . ”32 
FPIC was not obtained for the DAPL project according 
to UN standards . In July 2016, the Standing Rock Tribe 
sued the Army Corps of Engineers for alleged violations 
of various statutes and, later, the Treaty of Fort Laramie, 
maintaining that, “The construction and operation of the 
pipeline, as authorized by the Corps, threatens the Tribe’s 
environmental and economic well-being, and would 
damage and destroy sites of great historic, religious, and 
cultural significance to the Tribe . ”33 
The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Washington, 
D .C ., claimed that in issuing the permit for the project, 
the Corps violated multiple environmental and historic 

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 7preservation statutes; the suit focused on the decision to 
reroute the pipeline to the area near the Standing Rock 
reservation without adequate environmental analysis and 
consultation with the Tribe .34 In August 2016, the Tribe asked 
the court for a preliminary injunction to rescind permitting 
of the pipeline while the lawsuit could be decided .35 
In September 2016, the UN Special Rapporteur on the 
rights of Indigenous Peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, called 
for a halt to construction on the pipeline, saying, “The 
tribe was denied access to information and excluded from 
consultations at the planning stage of the project and 
environmental assessments failed to disclose the presence 
and proximity of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . ”36 
Later, in a full report in September 2017 about the impacts 
of energy development projects on Indigenous Tribes in 
the United States, the UN Special Rapporteur dedicated a 
section to the Dakota Access Pipeline, and concluded:37||The Army Corps of Engineers environmental assessment of 
the project, required by the National Environmental Policy 
Act, “failed to identify or address the concerns of the Indian 
tribes located directly downstream of the pipeline . Maps 
in the draft assessment initially omitted the reservation 
or the fact that the pipeline would cross the historic treaty 
lands of a number of tribal nations . ” 
||Although the Army Corps of Engineers said it held 
“numerous consultations” with the Tribes, the Corps 
confirmed that despite “attempts to contact affected 
Indian tribes, it was unable to hold the required 
consultations with them . ” 
||The affected Tribes, including the Standing Rock Sioux, 
explained that, “in their view, the attempted contacts were 
not made sufficiently early in the process but rather after the 
decisions regarding various aspects of the pipeline had been 
made, including its route, with limited consideration for 
sacred sites or the potential impact to their drinking water  .” 
WATER PROTECTORS
The hundreds of Tribes and Indigenous Nations gathered 
at Standing Rock represented the largest gathering of 
Indigenous Peoples in recent history  . The gathering initially 
formed near the pipeline at Iŋyaŋ Wakháŋagapi Othí, 
translated as Sacred Stone Camp, and as the protests grew, 
additional camps formed, such as Red Warrior Camp and 
Oceti Sakowin Camp  . The motto of Sacred Stone Camp, 
“Water is Life, ” became a rallying cry for a movement that 
called themselves Water Protectors, rather than protesters . 
Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with the Indigenous 
Environmental Network, explains that the word protest has 
a negative connotation that makes Indigenous People seem 
angry or violent  .38 Early on and throughout the resistance to 
the pipeline, Indigenous Peoples at Standing Rock requested 
that media refer to them as Water Protectors and briefed 
press on that preference .39 The camps themselves formed the base for many 
attempts to stop DAPL, but they were also dedicated to 
the preservation of “Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota cultural 
traditions, ” according to the Sacred Stone Camp website .40 
Lewis Grassrope, a former police officer who had earlier 
dropped out of the campaign for Tribe Chairman of the 
Lower Brule Sioux in South Dakota in order to join the Water 
Protector camps, stayed on even as winter settled in . “What 
needs to be accomplished hasn’t been, ” he said . “We need 
to stop the pipeline completely, and we need to rebuild our 
nation and re-establish our ancestral ways . ”41 At this point, 
the dissent against the pipeline and the purpose of the 
camps had grown beyond simply a pipeline protest  .
To reflect that many of the Indigenous Peoples who camped 
at Standing Rock focused on prayer and community building, 
while others engaged in peaceful protest to stop the building 
of the pipeline, throughout this report we call the Indigenous 
Peoples who came together at the camps Water Protectors, 
and specify “protesters” only in referring to specific incidents 
directly opposing the pipeline .

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 8Violations of Cultural and  
Human Rights
On-the-ground, Indigenous-led oppositional spirit camps near 
the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation emerged in the spring and 
summer of 2016 . The number of Water Protectors and allies 
grew significantly over the summer and into the fall of 2016 .42 
The historic gathering in opposition to the pipeline brought 
together some 200 Tribes that had not united in more than 150 
years,43 and gained national and global support and solidarity  . 
In early September 2016, with the court decision on the 
injunction still pending, Dakota Access bulldozed an area of 
the pipeline corridor filled with Tribal sacred sites and burials . 
As detailed in further depth later in this report, security 
officers used pepper spray and attack dogs against Water 
Protectors in the area .44 
On September 9, the court denied the Tribe’s motion for a 
preliminary injunction to block the pipeline construction . 
Minutes later, the U  .S . Department of Justice, the Department 
of the Army, and the Department of the Interior under the 
Obama Administration announced in a joint statement that 
because of “important issues raised by the Standing Rock 
Sioux Tribe and other tribal nations and their members 
regarding the Dakota Access pipeline specifically, and 
pipeline-related decision-making generally, ” the Army Corps 
would not authorize the pipeline construction around and 
under Lake Oahe “until it can determine whether it will need 
to reconsider any of its previous decisions regarding the Lake 
Oahe site under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
or other federal laws . Therefore, construction of the pipeline 
on Army Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe will not go 
forward at this time . ” 
The statement called on Dakota Access to voluntarily pause all 
construction activity within 20 miles east or west of Lake Oahe .
Dakota Access did not halt construction . The camps remained, 
and the violence against the Water Protectors continued . 
In October, the legal-government sequence was repeated: 
the court, after issuing a temporary halt in construction in 
September,45 again rejected an injunction pending appeal, 
and the Departments of Justice, Interior, and the Army again 
urged Dakota Access to voluntarily halt construction around 
the site, indicating that they were not going to issue the 
permit needed to cross the Missouri .46 
Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault 
invited Chief Edward John, an Expert Member of the United 
Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, to visit the 
protest camps “to see, firsthand, the conditions that he, his peoples and those from other communities have been facing 
in relation to the clearing of the right of way and subsequent 
construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . ”47 Chief John 
released his report on November 1, 2016, finding that:48 
||“ Regardless of both domestic and international law in favor 
of the Standing Rock Sioux, the pipeline construction 
has already damaged the security and integrity of the 
Standing Rock Sioux and the many others that have come 
to stand in solidarity with people of the Great Sioux Nation .  
Specifically, the owners and investors have in fact destroyed 
archaeological, historical and sacred sites of the Sioux  .” 
||“ Construction on the right of way is now proceeding 
on a 24-hour work day basis, seven days a week  . 
The construction is visible from the ‘south camp’ as 
equipment is literally bulldozing their way to the Missouri 
River/Lake Oahe . I was informed that the pipeline 
company has not received approval to drill on the shores 
of and under the Missouri River/Lake Oahe . Given that 
there are no approvals or authorizations in place, it is 
a significant expense and exposure for the company to 
proceed with the work  .” 
||“ …it is clear to me that the project has and will adversely 
impact the Standing Rock Sioux and their waters 
specifically, as well as cultural, spiritual, sacred and 
ancient village sites on their lands in their territory  .” 
||“ I am advised by a Sioux elder and cultural leader that so 
far some 380 cultural and sacred sites along the pipeline 
route have been destroyed by work associated with the 
right of way clearing for the pipeline . ” 
In December 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers halted 
construction on the pipeline and stated that it would conduct 
a full environmental review of the pipeline’s impacts before 
granting the final easement to allow it to cross Lake Oahe . But 
in February 2017, within days of taking office, newly elected 
U .S . President Donald Trump ordered an expedited review and 
approval to allow the pipeline construction to be completed .  
In response, Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) issued a 
statement saying that DAPL construction should not resume 
until the environmental impact review was completed and the 
Tribe’s consent was sought  . AIUSA condemned the resumption 
of pipeline construction: “This is an unlawful and appalling 
violation of human rights . The United States is obligated under 
international law to respect the rights of the Standing Rock 
Sioux Tribe and all other Indigenous Peoples . To allow this 
pipeline to go forward without sufficient assessment of how 
it will impact their land, culture, and access to clean water is a 
violation of their rights and sovereignty of their land . ”49 

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 9REPERCUSSIONS IN THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY
The overall handling of DAPL was so egregious that the lead 
financial underwriter for the DAPL project loan, Citibank, 
engaged with Energy Transfer Partners “to discuss our 
concerns and advocate for constructive dialogue with 
the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in an effort to come to a 
resolution . ”50 A consortium of banks that had participated 
in the DAPL project loan hired an outside firm, Foley Hoag 
LLP , to conduct an independent assessment to include the 
evaluation of “policies and procedures employed by the 
project’s sponsors, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco 
Logistics, in the areas of security, human rights, community 
engagement and cultural heritage . ”51 
Although Foley Hoag’s report was not made public, the 
public summary of the report confirmed that FPIC is critical 
to “international industry good practice”: “The report’s 
analysis draws extensively on the International Finance 
Corporation’s Environmental and Social Performance 
Standards (“IFC Performance Standards”), particularly 
the provisions stemming from the U  .N . Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples . These standards are a widely 
respected benchmark for good practice with regard to 
community engagement, including company consultation 
with Indigenous Peoples and security practices . ”52 
In May 2017, a group of ten European banks wrote to the 
Secretariat of the Equator Principles Association expressing 
alarm over shortcomings in the applied due diligence around 
FPIC, stating that “In addition to the reputation damage 
that this has caused to the banks involved [in the project], we believe that this is likely to damage the reputation of the 
Equator Principles (EPs) as a ‘golden standard’ and a common 
playing field for determining, assessing and managing 
environmental and social risks in projects . ”53 
The Equator Principles are a policy framework that 
establishes a minimum benchmark for socially and 
environmentally responsible lending . Ninety-two banks have 
adopted the Equator Principles, several of which were on 
the project loan for DAPL . To date, there has been a loophole 
for “designated countries” such as the United States; the 
assumption has been that there are strong U  .S . federal 
laws around Indigenous rights and FPIC, and that therefore 
the same amount of due diligence isn’t needed by banks 
participating in projects in the United States .54 Standing Rock 
proved that wrong — in fact demonstrating that U  .S . law and 
how it was interpreted and executed with regards to DAPL was 
not up to the standards and best practices expressed in the 
spirit of the Equator Principles . 
In fall 2017, the Equator Principles Association convened and 
committed to a process of updating the Equator Principles 
over the course of 18 months, addressing challenges 
“including application of Free, Prior and Informed Consent 
(FPIC) in different jurisdictions, the ‘Designated Countries’ 
approach within the EPs, climate risk… ”55 
Ahead of that meeting, Greenpeace International, BankTrack 
and more than 60 other international environmental 
organizations had already called for a formal process of 
revising the Equator Principles, citing DAPL as an example  
of their failure:56 
“ … instead of preventing non-financial and financial risk for 
banks, and preserving the only source of drinking water for 
the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes, the 
current EP framework allowed for the project to proceed in a 
violation of the principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent 
(FPIC) that has been recognised even by banks financing the 
project  . The DAPL project also resulted in substantial losses 
for several of the EP banks involved, and dealt a severe 
blow to the reputation of the EP initiative as a robust risk 
management framework  . DAPL was only the latest in a long 
line of projects affecting Indigenous Peoples’ lands that have 
been considered fully compliant with the Equator Principles 
— despite devastating impacts on Indigenous communities . ”

Tactic 2: Silencing Free 
Speech with Intimidation
As the Water Protectors’ opposition to the pipeline construction increased and received 
increased attention, ETP’s tactics, in conjunction with local law enforcement, became more 
aggressive. ETP’s consistent and unrelenting response to DAPL opposition has been to try to 
quash legitimate dissent with intimidation, violence, arrests, and lawsuits. 
Arbitrary Arrests
Open Democracy reported in December 2016 that security 
firms hired by ETP and local and state police agencies 
were routinely using “excessive force, arbitrary arrest and 
intimidation tactics to subvert the protesters constitutional 
and international rights to expression and peaceful 
assembly  .”57 In the course of one month, more than 400 
Water Protectors were arrested, “many of whom have been 
subjected to highly-questionable charges including engaging 
in riots and conspiracy to endanger by fire and explosion . ”58 
In a letter calling on the U  .S . Department of Justice to investigate 
the actions of law enforcement agencies at the Standing Rock 
site, Amnesty International cited the arrests of at least 140 
people in a single day in October 2016: “Reports from legal 
aid support based at the protest camp are that all individuals 
arrested were required to pay bail, even for minor offenses such 
as trespassing, and were all strip searched upon processing . ”59 
In November 2016, a United Nations expert on human rights 
called on ETP to pause construction activity near Lake Oahe, 
pointing to “local security forces employing an increasingly 
militarized response to protests . ” The UN Office of the High 
Commissioner on Human Rights reported, “Law enforcement 
officials, private security firms and the North Dakota National 
Guard have used unjustified force to deal with opponents 
of the Dakota Access pipeline, according to Maina Kiai, 
the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and association . ”60 “Mr  . Kiai also said an 
announcement on 8 November by pipeline operator Energy 
Transfer LLC Corporation, stating that the final phase of 
construction would start in two weeks, ‘willfully’ ignored an 
earlier public statement by federal agencies . ” Mr  . Kiai said that 
he was concerned at the “scale of arrests and the conditions 
in which people were being held”: “Marking people with 
numbers and detaining them in overcrowded cages, on the bare concrete floor, without being provided with medical 
care, amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment  .”61 In this 
report and other accounts, it is not always clear which acts 
were performed by private security and which by police, and 
what role private security had in instigating the police to those 
actions . This report seeks to highlight the interconnected 
nature of private security actions with local law enforcement 
at the Standing Rock Protests .
“This is a troubling response to people who are taking action 
to protect natural resources and ancestral territory in the face 
of profit-seeking activity, ” Mr  . Kaia said . “The excessive use of 
State security apparatus to suppress protest against corporate 
activities that are alleged to violate human rights is wrong and 
contrary to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights . ”62 His call for ETP to halt construction activity was 
endorsed by six additional UN experts on human rights and 
the rights of Indigenous Peoples .63 
As of April 2018, 253 of the 83164 state arrests from Standing 
Rock were still open, according to the Water Protector Legal 
Collective (WPLC) . Nineteen were convicted at trial (three of 
those are being appealed to the State Supreme Court), and 
337 were either dismissed or acquitted at trial .
In an attitudinal survey, the WPLC found that 75 percent 
of Morton County respondents and 77 percent of Burleigh 
County respondents had already prejudged protesters as 
guilty  .65 This information was submitted to request a change 
of venue in cases of notable defendants like Red Fawn Fallis 
and Michael “Little Feather” Giron . In both cases, the change 
of venue was denied, and like 224 others, Fallis and Giron both 
reached plea agreements . Fallis reached a plea agreement for 
two felonies and is awaiting sentencing, which could be from 
21 to 57 months in prison . Giron was sentenced to 36 months 
in prison .66 

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 11In one case, a judge sentenced two Water Protectors even 
though the prosecution was not asking for jail time .67 The 
number of arrests, combined with the court system’s inability 
to handle that volume, meant that many cases were delayed 
far longer than is typical, including nearly 200 cases that were 
abruptly rescheduled by court officials via unsigned emailed 
notice in January 2017 .68 
Strategic Lawsuits Against  
Public Participation 
In August 2016, ETP’s subsidiary Dakota Access LLC sued 
Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II, 
Standing Rock Councilman Dana Yellow Fat, and several other 
named and unnamed defendants, seeking “restraining orders 
and unspecified monetary damages . ” The suit was an attempt 
by the company to prevent Water Protectors from protesting 
near the pipeline and to make them pay damages to the 
company for past protests .69 
The court initially granted a temporary injunction before 
Chairman Archambault and the others had a chance to 
respond70 — a restraining order that would have meant that 
they could be held in contempt of court if they demonstrated 
or engaged in religious expression near the pipeline route .71 
The order was lifted a month later, and in May 2017 the ETP 
lawsuit was dismissed altogether  . 
The lawsuit against the Water Protectors has all the markings 
of a “Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation” (SLAPP),  a meritless suit meant to silence free speech through 
expensive and time-consuming litigation . The use of SLAPPs 
to shut down free speech is increasingly recognized as a 
violation of human rights . A 2016 report by the UN Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders 
stated, “Legal forums are increasingly being used to silence 
defenders, particularly those who oppose large-scale 
development projects and the actions of companies . The use 
of strategic litigation against public participation lawsuits 
silences defenders, effectively denying them their rights to 
freedom of expression and participation in public affairs . 
Defenders require support in their defence against such 
lawsuits, the financial and psychological burdens of which are 
often so great that they distract and demobilize defenders . ”72 
Recognizing the threat that SLAPP suits pose to free speech 
and human rights, a number of U  .S . states have passed 
anti-SLAPP laws that limit the use of SLAPPs to varying 
degrees . The Public Participation Project, which documents 
and campaigns for anti-SLAPP laws and works to keep them 
from being gutted, argues that, “SLAPPs are used to silence 
and harass critics by forcing them to spend money to defend 
these baseless suits . SLAPP filers don’t go to court to seek 
justice . Rather, SLAPPS are intended to intimidate those who 
disagree with them or their activities by draining the target’s 
financial resources . SLAPPs are effective because even a 
meritless lawsuit can take years and many thousands of 
dollars to defend . To end or prevent a SLAPP , those who speak 
out on issues of public interest frequently agree to muzzle 
themselves, apologize, or ‘correct’ statements . ”73

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 12A LARGER P ATTERN OF INTIMIDATION
The arbitrary arrests and anti-free-speech lawsuits are not isolated incidents of corporate intimidation tactics; however, the 
use of RICO and the high damages set the lawsuit apart from the rest, and could further embolden oil and pipeline companies 
to take this kind of action. 
||In March 2018, Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC (TM), a 
subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Canada, which faced 
overwhelming opposition in its controversial expansion 
of the Trans Mountain pipeline in British Columbia, sued 
15 individual activists and “persons unknown, ” seeking 
a permanent and interim injunction as well as damages, 
interest, and costs . The complaint claimed as a legal basis 
nuisance, conspiracy, and unlawful interference with 
economic relations . 
||In April 2018, Mountain Valley Pipeline sued tree-sitter 
protesters who had stationed themselves in trees being 
cut along the pipeline route . The company sued Theresa 
“Red” Terry and her daughter, Theresa Minor Terry, for civil 
contempt, and asked a federal court to fine them for every 
day of violation, to direct U  .S . marshals to remove the tree-
sitters, and to charge them for damages from the pipeline 
construction delay  . The women climbed down from the 
trees in early May 2018 .78 
||In October 2014, TM sued five protesters, the pipeline-
opponent group BROKE, and “persons unknown” after 
protests against its pipeline-expansion study work in 
a national park on Burnaby Mountain . The company 
sought damages it estimated at more than $5 million per 
month of delay, as well as injunctive relief, on the basis of 
trespass, assault, intimidation, nuisance, inducing breach 
of contract and conspiracy  . The lawsuit provoked wide 
controversy given that the “trespass” allegedly took place 
in a public park and that the protesters’ facial expressions constituted “assault” (prompting a viral social media 
campaign of people posting pictures of their “Kinder 
Morgan face”) . In January 2015 TM dropped the case .
||Vancouver-based Stand . earth was ordered to pay Enbridge, 
Inc .’s court fees totaling $14,500 after Stand . earth lost 
a 2014 court case against the proposed expansion of 
Enbridge’s Line 9 pipeline . The organization refused to pay 
the court as a “point of principle, ” and in October 2017, 
sheriffs arrived at the Stand . earth office to seize assets 
from the organization . The sheriffs filmed the office and 
told staff that they were not allowed to remove any of 
the items, and then left, saying they would be back with 
a moving track  . Amid a social media backlash, Enbridge 
backtracked almost immediately, cancelling the seizure 
in a pair of tweets three hours later  . Stand . earth Canada 
director Karen Mahon said, “Enbridge made $4 .6 billion 
last year  . This is not about the money  . This is an attempt to 
intimidate us from taking action on behalf of the climate 
and the public . ”79 
||After ETP filed its 2017 SLAPP / RICO lawsuit against 
Greenpeace entities and others, “litigation hold letters” 
were sent to numerous non-parties, even though — as 
non-parties — they had no obligation to preserve relevant 
documents . These letters were sent to a number of 
Indigenous groups as well as independent Greenpeace 
offices outside the United States and organizations not 
named in the lawsuit  .North Dakota has no anti-SLAPP legislation . 
In August 2017, after the pipeline was complete, ETP 
continued its use of SLAPP suits for intimidation, filing a 
$900 million lawsuit against Greenpeace entities, Banktrack, 
and the movement Earth First!, accusing the organizations 
of inciting and directing acts of “eco-terrorism . ”74 The suit 
was brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act (RICO), a law enacted in 1970 that was 
initially designed to tackle mafia activity  .75 The use of RICO 
to treat advocacy activity as inherently criminal poses a 
serious threat to free speech and advocacy  . The UN Special 
Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly has described RICO suits as “a worrying new approach” 
being misused “to intimidate advocacy groups and activists 
by enabling corporations to smear these groups as ‘criminal 
enterprises’ , while claiming exorbitant damages (RICO entitles 
plaintiffs to claim treble damages as a punitive measure) for 
the ‘harm’ they claim to have suffered . ”76 
In a 2017 interview, ETP CEO Kelcy Warren said “Could we get 
some monetary damages out of this thing, and probably will 
we? Yeah, sure . Is that my primary objective? Absolutely not  . 
It’s to send a message, you can’t do this, this is unlawful and 
it’s not going to be tolerated in the United States . ”77

Tactic 3: Criminalizing 
Protest with Unjust Laws
Following the controversy around the Dakota Access Pipeline, a series of more than 60 bills 
was introduced restricting the right to protest and criminalizing protest. As of the publication 
of this report, nine have passed and 26 are pending; three of those nine bills that have passed 
are in North Dakota, the heart of the DAPL controversy. The oil industry in general, ETP , and 
the American Legislative Exchange Council each had a role in popularizing these bills and 
spreading this legislative tactic, which is having a long-term chilling effect on free speech, 
especially around protests against pipelines.
Even just introducing these protest bills has the potential to 
chill speech and deter First Amendment protected activities .  
UN experts on freedom of expression and assembly, David Kaye 
and Maina Kiai, expressed concerns about the new influx of 
anti-protest bills following the DAPL protests: “The Bills would 
have a chilling effect on protestors, stripping the voice of the 
most marginalized, who often find in the right to assemble the 
only alternative to express their opinions . We are particularly 
concerned about the fact that several Bills directly target 
environmental activists… these Bills were reportedly proposed 
as a response to the protests organized by activists and 
opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota . ”80 
The American Legislative Exchange  
Council: Methods and Funding
The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) has 
played a significant role in introducing and popularizing 
bills that criminalize protest, especially concerning “critical 
infrastructure . ” ALEC is a controversial organization that 
avoids lobbying disclosure requirements by bringing state 
lawmakers and corporate lobbyists together in private 
meetings where they collaborate on so-called “model bills” 
for state legislatures .81 
ALEC’s most prominent and longstanding corporate members 
include fossil fuel companies Koch Industries,82 ExxonMobil,83 
and Peabody Energy,84 all of which have financed and helped 
manage ALEC operations for decades . 
Only 2 percent of ALEC’s funding comes from legislative dues; 
the other 98 percent comes from private donations through a 
variety of streams, including oil companies and trade groups 
like the American Petroleum Institute (API) .85 Despite playing 
an active role in creating legislation for state lawmakers, ALEC 
funding does not require public disclosure .ALEC’s Role In Promoting  
Anti-Protest Bills
In early 2017, during the final months of the protests at 
Standing Rock, oil companies turned to ALEC-backed 
legislators to introduce anti-protest bills in several states . 
These bills seek to increase criminal penalties for people 
planning or conducting a wide variety of protest on 
private property, or protests concerning so-called “critical 
infrastructure . ”
The first of these “critical infrastructure” bills was authored 
by Oklahoma Representative Charles McCall86, a registered 
member of ALEC87, and introduced in February 2017 . 
According to ALEC, it then inspired a model bill called the 
Critical Infrastructure Protection Act  .88 
The bills became law in North Dakota, Oklahoma89, and South 
Dakota90 . Similar bills were introduced in Georgia, Colorado, 
Illinois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania . 
Even though DAPL construction through South Dakota 
was already complete, the governor’s office said that 
passage of the law there was an “important proactive step 
toward reducing potential disruption from protests when 
construction on the Keystone XL pipeline begins in the 
state  .”91 The South Dakota law allows the governor to set up 
“public safety zones” in which protest activities can be limited 
to gatherings of 20 people or less — a measure that prompted 
Remi Bald Eagle, who works in intergovernmental affairs 
with the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, to warn that the law 
“comes dangerously close to restricting constitutional rights . 
Nowhere in the constitution did it say anything about how 
many people can assemble peaceably  .”92 

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 14The oil industry’s anti-protest push continued in 2018 . ALEC 
members in the Iowa statehouse helped pass a law93 very 
similar to the ALEC template bill .94 Wyoming’s legislature 
passed a version that was ultimately vetoed by Governor 
Matt Mead because the proposed criminal punishments were 
“imprecisely crafted” and redundant with existing law  .95 
Dozens of anti-protest bills, such as those relating to “critical 
infrastructure” or heightened trespassing penalties, are still 
being considered by legislators in several states, including 
Minnesota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania .96 
ETP , ALEC, and Anti-Protest Bills
Tracking the funding to ALEC, lobbying, and campaign 
contributions reveals connections between Energy Transfer 
Partners and ALEC as well as ETP’s own role in popularizing 
and spreading this tactic this tactic .
While it is not possible to know the full involvement of ETP 
with ALEC because funding ALEC does not require public 
disclosure, it is known that ETP spent $10,000 in 2010 for a 
Director level sponsorship of ALEC’s Annual Conference97, 
and was a “Trustee” level sponsor of the 2014 Conference98, 
buying time with lawmakers . 
In addition, Iowa State lobbying disclosures show that ETP 
directly advocated for the legislation in Iowa along with Koch 
Industries and the American Petroleum Institute .99 One of 
ETP’s two listed lobbyists on the bill, Jeff Boeyink, has been 
associated with100 ALEC in his capacity as an Iowa anti-tax 
lobbyist  . In testifying before the Senate Subcommittee, 
Boeyink pointed out the “huge monetary implications” 
of protest for ETP  . John Benson, a legislative liaison for 
the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency 
Management, said that “operators of these facilities want 
criminal charges that are appropriate for such actions . ”101 
While Iowa’s lobbying disclosures show activity on specific bills, 
other states only require lobbyists to be registered but do not 
show activity on specific legislation . However, Energy Transfer 
Equity, the parent company of ETP , spent $1 .4 million on 
lobbying in the U  .S . in 2016, at the peak of the resistance to the 
Dakota Access Pipeline102, compared to just $240,000 in 2009 .
From 2015 to 2018, ETP had two registered lobbyists in North 
Dakota: Joel Gilbertson (who was the ALEC state chairman in 
2014103) and Levi Andrist (grandson104 of former Senator John 
Andrist, who was a member of ALEC105), but had no lobbyists 
registered in North Dakota in 2014, before the controversy  . Currently, there are two other anti-protest bills pending 
in Pennsylvania106 — where ETP’s Mariner East 2 natural 
gas pipeline is currently under construction — and one in 
Ohio107 where the Rover gas pipeline is under construction . 
In both states bills have been proposed that seek to increase 
penalties for protests that hinder the functions of critical 
infrastructure facilities; the Ohio bill would even criminalize 
the flying of a drone over such a facility  . ETP lobbyists are 
registered in both states .108
Energy Transfer Partners contributed to the campaigns of 35 
candidates for the House and Senate in Pennsylvania, as well as 
to the campaign of Tom Wolf, the current Governor, for a total 
of $27,500 . Additionally, in the 2016 cycle, ETP made a donation 
to Mike Regan, the sponsor of the Pennsylvania bill .109 
The pattern of how and where these bills have been 
introduced, as well as ETP’s spending pattern on lobbying 
and campaign contributions, could imply that its role 
in promoting and lobbying for these bills is significant  . 
Additionally, Kelcy Warren’s own rhetoric around pipeline 
protesters demonstrates his own attitude regarding protest; 
he refers to social media about bank funding of pipelines as 
“terrorism110” in one interview, and says on a panel discussion 
that protesters should be “removed from the gene pool .111”


TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 15The Impact of Anti-Protest Bills
The three bills criminalizing protest in North Dakota that 
passed in 2017 were known informally as the DAPL protest 
bills .112 These newly enacted laws significantly increase 
penalties for already illegal conduct such as rioting and 
incitement to riot (a charge that implicates speech),113 and for 
criminal trespass .114 Another of the three laws creates a year-
long jail sentence for anyone wearing a face covering, including 
a hood, while committing a crime .115 One proposed bill would 
give impunity to any driver who hit or even killed a protester 
with their car as long as it was deemed unintentional,116 an idea 
that was widely criticized as appearing to encourage violence 
against protesters .117 Similar bills have been introduced in six 
other states, but so far none have been enacted .The legislative trend sparked by the DAPL protests shows 
no signs of slowing down, and the resulting impact could 
have disastrous consequences on First Amendment rights 
and free speech — consequences extending far beyond 
pipelines . Noting the trend of these anti-protest bills in 
protest hotspots, the American Civil Liberties Union wrote, 
“Legislators in states with robust protest activity should 
have one priority: listening to those voices (even if, and 
perhaps especially when, they disagree with them) . Sadly, 
we’re seeing a different trend — one that tries to silence 
them . In a year of historic activism, that response isn’t just 
unconstitutional: It’s fundamentally un-American . ”

Tactic 4: Enabling Violence 
Against Communities 
As Indigenous opposition to DAPL grew in the summer and fall of 2016, ETP private security 
and federal, state, and local law enforcement resorted to surveillance and increasingly 
militaristic tactics against Water Protectors and allies, tactics which were revealed when  
The Intercept  published a large cache of leaked documents in a series of articles.
The police were said to target protesters “with worrying 
frequency” using rubber bullets, pepper spray and attack 
dogs .118 In 2017, the ACLU described how “All eyes were 
on Standing Rock late last year as unwarranted armored 
vehicles rolled in . Law enforcement used automatic rifles, 
sound cannons, and concussion grenades against water 
protectors… Personnel and equipment pouring in from over 
75 law enforcement agencies from around the country and 
National Guard troops created a battlefield-like atmosphere 
at Standing Rock  . Escalated police militarization was used 
to intimidate and silence water protectors’ free speech and 
their right to protest a pipeline which passes near sovereign 
territory… With resilience, water protectors have already 
endured militarized crackdowns, police abuse, and daily 
intimidation — simply for defending their water rights . ”119 
On Labor Day weekend in 2016, Democracy Now! captured 
video footage of ETP private security guards using attack 
dogs and pepper spray against demonstrators . The video 
was viewed 14 million times on social media, and was picked 
up by major media outlets .120 Days later, the North Dakota 
Bureau of Criminal Investigation issued an arrest warrant for 
Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman, on charges of engaging 
in a riot121 — charges that were later dropped .122 
Chief Edward John, the Expert Member of the United Nations 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues who visited the 
pipeline site in late October 2016, reported that, “I was 
repeatedly told of constant aerial surveillance by drones, 
airplanes and helicopters and on-the-ground surveillance 
by officers in vehicles stationed on high points of land 
adjacent to the south camp  . While on site some Standing 
Rock members pointed out several law enforcement vehicles 
parked on a nearby hill that is known by tribal members as 
a burial site . This together with the presence of significant 
levels of ‘security’ forces from local police, neighboring state 
police forces, DAPL private company security contractors, and 
the national guard of North Dakota have all contributed to 
heightened insecurity and intensity…“All these actions have directly contributed to a ‘war zone’ 
atmosphere and intensified levels of scrutiny  . On the bridge 
near the south camp I witnessed burned out vehicles 
stationed to prevent passage either way  . Large concrete 
blocks have also been laid across the bridge beyond the 
destroyed vehicles . Nearby I met officers in body armor, fully 
armed and in full camouflage gear  .”123 
TigerSwan 
In May 2017 The Intercept released documents that shed light 
on the security tactics used by law enforcement and security 
firms hired by ETP  . “Police became notorious for their use of 
so-called less than lethal weapons against demonstrators, 
including rubber bullets, bean bag pellets, LRAD sound 
devices, and water cannons, ” The Intercept reported . “But it 
was the brutality of private security officers that first provoked 
widespread outrage concerning the pipeline project  .”124 
The documents included leaked internal communications 
from TigerSwan, a private security and intelligence 
contractor based in Apex, North Carolina . TigerSwan was 
founded at the height of the Iraq War by retired U  .S . Army 
Col . James Reese, who had been assigned to the Army’s 
special forces Delta unit  . TigerSwan has approximately 350 
employees, and offices in Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, 
Jordan, India, Latin America, and Japan .125 TigerSwan says 
it achieves results with what it calls “world class methods” 
registered as F3AR®, NIFE®, and “Guardian Angel, ” and its 
“mantra” is “Solutions to Uncertainty  .”®126 
In fall 2016, after the Democracy Now! video release showing 
other ETP security using attack dogs and pepper spray against 
Water Protectors, ETP hired TigerSwan as a contractor on DAPL .  
In its role, TigerSwan managed other security contractors on 
the project, which included Silverton, Russell Group of Texas, 
10 Code LLC, Per Mar, SRC, OnPoint, and Leighton .127 

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 17Despite the backlash to the violent tactics, TigerSwan and 
the contractors they managed continued to use brutal tactics 
with Water Protectors and allies at Standing Rock  . “TigerSwan 
targeted the movement opposed to the Dakota Access 
Pipeline with military-style counterterrorism measures, 
collaborating closely with police in at least five states, ” 
The Intercept noted . “Internal TigerSwan communications 
describe the movement as ‘an ideologically driven insurgency 
with a strong religious component’ and compare the anti-
pipeline water protectors to jihadist fighters . ”128 Among 
documents that The Intercept obtained through public 
records requests were “daily intelligence updates” that 
TigerSwan developed and shared with law enforcement 
officials, “contributing to a broad public-private intelligence 
dragnet  .”129 Documents obtained by The Intercept included 
daily “detailed summaries of the previous day’s surveillance 
targeting pipeline opponents, intelligence on upcoming 
protests, and information harvested from social media . ”130 
They also provide “extensive evidence of aerial surveillance 
and radio eavesdropping, as well as infiltration of camps and 
activist circles . ”131 
ETP CEO Kelcy Warren makes no secret of his opinion of 
protesters . “Warren is certain that his version of the facts 
should carry the day against protesters, ” The Dallas Morning 
News reported, “including musicians who Warren has worked 
with for years and a Norwegian bank that is helping finance 
the pipeline but raised an objection over the weekend to the 
way ETP has dealt with ‘indigenous people’s rights . ’ Warren 
totally does not buy those arguments . He said the protesters are ignoring reality  . The decision of Norway’s DNB bank was a 
mistake, he said . And other banks are also getting attacked via 
social media in an effort to cut financing to the energy industry  . 
‘That’s all that nonsense is, ’ he said . ‘It’s just terrorism . ’”132 
On October 27, 2016 hundreds of law enforcement officers 
(local, federal, and officers from several states) forcibly 
evicted Water Protectors from one of the camps, Treaty Camp, 
demolishing the camp and arresting 142 activists . TigerSwan 
had provided law enforcement with a surveillance briefing 
the day before the eviction .133 As the eviction was underway, 
Kyle Thompson, an employee of Leighton Security — one of 
the security firms managed by TigerSwan, drove a pickup 
truck at high speed toward Oceti Sakowin, a larger Water 
Protector camp  . Forced off the road by Water Protectors, 
Thompson covered his face with sunglasses and a bandana and 
brandished an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, at one point pointing 
the weapon into the faces of the unarmed protesters .134 
Thompson was surrounded by Water Protectors until he could 
be disarmed and arrested by officers from the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs . Thompson was released without charges .135 
The activities of private security employees, including Kyle 
Thompson, raise questions about the level of due diligence 
exercised by ETP and its contractors in assessing the suitability 
and providing oversight of persons hired for these situations .
OPERATING WITHOUT A LICENSE
On September 23, 2016, the North Dakota Private 
Investigation and Security Board (PISB) notified TigerSwan 
that the PSIB was aware that the company was operating in 
North Dakota without a license, and requested information 
about TigerSwan’s activities in the state . James Reese applied 
for a North Dakota private security license five days later  .136 
In correspondence between TigerSwan and the PSIB in the 
following months, TigerSwan denied that it had engaged in 
private security activities, referring to its work for ETP instead 
as “management and IT consulting . ” The PISB denied a 
license to TigerSwan in December 2016, in part because Reese 
had not disclosed his past arrests — including an arrest in 
2015 flagged as domestic violence that was later dismissed137 
— and had not provided sufficient information “for the Board 
to determine whether a reported offense or adjudication has a 
direct bearing on Reese’s fitness to serve the public . ”138 Reese 
requested an administrative review of the license denial, and 
the license was denied again after a special PISB meeting in 
January 2017 . (At that meeting board members were asked to 
destroy copies of material relating to TigerSwan and Reese at 
the close of the meeting .139)

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 18In June 2017, the PISB brought a civil suit in North Dakota 
against TigerSwan for illegal and unlicensed operations during 
DAPL construction . The suit sought fines and penalties against 
TigerSwan, and sought to ban TigerSwan from working in 
the state .140 PISB held that at the time of the suit, TigerSwan 
continued to work in North Dakota, maintaining “roving 
security teams, ” that TigerSwan personnel “acting as security 
personnel are armed with semiautomatic rifles and sidearms 
while engaging in security services, ” and that the company 
continued to provide private investigative services on behalf 
of its client, ETP  .141 The complaint also described tactics used 
by TigerSwan, including “flyover photography, ” “surveillance 
of social media accounts, ” placing or attempting to place 
“undercover private security agents within the protest group, ” 
and coordination with local law enforcement officials .142 
One of three counts in the PISB civil suit was dismissed in 
April 2018 and the remaining counts were dismissed in May 
2018 . The PISB attorney said he plans to file an appeal .143 
TIGERSWAN IN OTHER STATES
Given the incitement of police activity, the intensity of violence 
directed toward Water Protectors, and the disregard for state 
regulations that TigerSwan demonstrated in North Dakota, it is 
concerning that ETP would choose to contract with TigerSwan 
to provide security services on projects in other states, like the 
Mariner East 2 pipeline project in Pennsylvania .144 
In June 2017, TigerSwan applied for a license to operate in 
Louisiana, where construction is underway on ETP’s Bayou 
Bridge pipeline . (Additional information on the Bayou Bridge 
pipeline can be found later in this report  .) The application 
was denied in July 2017 . The executive director of the 
Louisiana State Board of Private Security Examiners cited 
the North Dakota license denials and litigation in refusing to 
certify TigerSwan .145 
Shortly after the license application was denied in Louisiana, 
TigerSwan employee Lisa Smith registered a new company 
(L TSA) and applied for a permit for private security, while 
concealing her TigerSwan employment  . Smith’s application 
was denied, with the state board noting she had “intentionally 
engaged in material omission of fact  .”146 
In February 2017, retired general James “Spider” Marks wrote 
a pro-ETP opinion article for the Daily Advertiser in Louisiana, 
without disclosing his membership on a TigerSwan advisory 
board .147 148 In March 2018, James Marks and Washington 
DC-based public relations and lobbying firm DCI Group used 
robocalls to invite Louisiana residents to take part in a “free 
informational conference call on the Bayou Bridge pipeline, ” without revealing the associations between ETP , TigerSwan, 
Marks, and DCI Group149, which has ties to the American 
Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) .150 
TigerSwan does have license to operate in Pennsylvania, 
where its tactics of harassing protesters mirror techniques it 
employed for ETP at DAPL, including monitoring resistance 
to the controversial Mariner East 2 pipeline (ME2),151 which is 
also owned by ETP and related companies . In April 2017, the 
Mariner East 1 pipeline, which runs parallel to the proposed 
path of ME2, spilled 20 barrels of ethane and propane near 
Morgantown, Pennsylvania . “It would be weeks before the 
public learned of the leak of highly explosive natural gas 
liquids, ” The Intercept reported . “According to a source with 
direct knowledge of TigerSwan’s operation, making sure 
nobody found out about the incident was part of TigerSwan’s 
mission on the project  .”152 
In September 2017, four Pennsylvania residents, including 
Elise Gerhart, sued ETP , its related company Sunoco Pipeline, 
and TigerSwan, alleging that the companies had violated the 
residents’ constitution rights when police arrested them on 
Gerhart’s property in March 2016 . The residents were protesting 
tree-cutting on an easement on the property that the company 
obtained through eminent domain to build the pipeline .  
According to the lawsuit, ETP/Sunoco entered the property 
almost a year before the final state permits were issued for 
pipeline construction, and before it was allowed to do so under 
a “writ of possession” issued by a state judge in April 2017 .153 
In a further example of TigerSwan’s use of misinformation to 
undermine pipeline opponents’ credibility, according to the 
lawsuit, TigerSwan and a publicist, Nick Johnson, another co-
defendant in the case, falsely claimed on Facebook that Elise 
Gerhart and the others are “fronts for the Russian government, 
which is trying to disrupt U  .S . energy production because it 
fears its own share of world energy markets will drop  .”154

Tactic 5: Seizing Private Property
ETP , Sunoco, and their subsidiaries are aggressively seizing 
private property through eminent domain proceedings in 
all of their current major pipeline projects — Bayou Bridge, 
DAPL, ETCO, ME2, and the Rover Pipeline — in order for ETP to 
build the pipelines through private property  . On behalf of ETP , 
state governments in seven states (Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, 
West Virginia, Michigan, North Dakota, Louisiana) are taking 
hundreds of landowners to court to expropriate their land, 
claiming that there is a public purpose or benefit  . 
The companies’ efforts to obtain and maintain easement 
agreements from property owners have been met with 
vigorous resistance in several areas, and in some cases, private 
landowners have filed lawsuits to challenge the property 
seizure, or at a minimum, to bring transparency to the process .
In some areas, the fact that a pipeline company has 
acquired an easement to build on private property concerns 
homeowners . “The [Mariner East] project has unsettled the 
residential real estate market, as some fearful homeowners 
sold out ahead of construction, and some buyers moved 
in unaware of the forthcoming disruption, ” The Inquirer 
reported . “Many who remained are basically stuck until the 
dust settles, uncertain of the value of their homes . ”155
Historically, eminent domain proceedings were used by the 
government to take private land for a public use — for example 
to build roads — while compensating the owner  . The legal 
standard was expanded to include projects that have a “public 
purpose, ” a definition that has been broadened further to allow 
the government to take private lands and transfer the rights to 
private companies . Originally, this was applied to projects that 
could provide a direct economic benefit to the locality, such as 
redevelopment to stimulate the local economy, but in cases 
such as pipeline construction it is being used for projects where 
there is active debate and no agreement that there is proven 
benefit to the immediate community  .Iowa: Dakota Access Pipeline
DAPL crosses 343 miles of land in Iowa . ETP and its subsidiary 
Dakota Access, LLC were not able to get the consent of all the 
affected landowners to allow the pipeline to cross through 
their property  . The Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) granted Dakota 
Access the permit to construct the oil pipeline through Iowa 
in March 2016, and in doing so, gave Dakota Access eminent 
domain powers in the project  . Although the use of eminent 
domain was deeply unpopular among Iowans,156 Dakota 
Access used eminent domain proceedings to seize the private 
property that landowners did not give up willingly  .
A group of landowners, together with the Sierra Club Iowa 
Chapter, brought a lawsuit against the IUB, arguing that the 
DAPL permit should not have been granted, and that both 
Iowa law and the U  .S . Constitution preclude the use of eminent 
domain to condemn property for a crude oil project  .157 In Iowa, 
a company must show that a pipeline meets the legal standard 
of providing a “public convenience and necessity” in order get a 
permit from the IUB .158 Dakota Access argued that there was an 
economic value to the public by creating construction jobs, but 
Sierra Club argued that construction jobs and general economic 
impact have nothing to do with whether the pipeline will 
provide a needed service . The Iowa Supreme Court is currently 
reviewing the case and will likely issue a decision in 2018 .“The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in 
the political process, including large corporations and development firms . As for the victims, the 
government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with 
more . The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result  .”

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 20Louisiana: Bayou Bridge Pipeline
ETP’s Bayou Bridge Pipeline (BBP) would transport crude oil 
cross 162 miles of ecologically sensitive land in Louisiana — 
passing through 11 parishes, and impacting 700 bodies of water, 
including many in the Atchafalaya Basin, an environmentally 
sensitive National Heritage Area . Like DAPL, the BBP project is 
only possible through the seizure of private lands . ETP has used 
eminent domain proceedings to expropriate more than 400 
pieces of private property in Louisiana .  
BBP already faces multiple lawsuits in federal and state courts 
regarding environmental regulations; in January 2018 three 
Louisiana organizations, Atchafalaya Basinkeeper, Louisiana 
Bucket Brigade, and 350 New Orleans, represented by the 
New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), filed 
suit to obtain public records regarding BBP’s “land grabs . ”159 
With BBP asserting that it has “legal authority to exercise 
eminent domain under state law as a ‘common carrier’ 
because its proposed pipeline is ‘in the public interest, ’” the 
groups argue that the company should be subjected to the 
same transparency requirements that would be required of 
public agencies exercising eminent domain .160 CCR had requested BBP records — including records of 
communications with local, parish, state, and federal 
agencies, as well as “any records of surveillance or other 
operations concerning opponents by private security 
companies such as TigerSwan, ”161 to “ensure the operators of 
the pipeline are transparent in all their dealings with public 
officials and landowners, ” as the companies develop “public 
relations efforts in response to local pipeline opposition . ”162

Dirty Pipelines: Spills and  
Safety Concerns
Photo shows the construction of the Bayou Bridge pipeline in Louisiana . Earthjustice and others filed a lawsuit that says a spill could harm 
the ecosystem of the Atchafalaya Basin . https://earthjustice.org/cases/2018/bayou-bridge-pipeline © 2018 Julie Dermansky / GreenpeacePipelines operated by ETP and its related company, Sunoco, spilled hazardous liquids  
527 times from 2002 to the end of 2017 — an average of one incident every 11 days.163 
Those 527 incidents, reported by the Pipeline Hazardous 
Material Safety Administration (PHMSA), released a total 
of 87,273 barrels (3 .6 million gallons, or about five-and-a-
half Olympic-sized swimming pools) of hazardous liquids, 
including 66,515 barrels (2 .8 million gallons) of crude oil . 
Sixty-seven of the spills were reported to have contaminated 
water, including 18 incidents that contaminated groundwater, 
and more than 100 of the incidents involved 50 barrels 
or more (2,100 gallons, a volume which is considered 
“significant” by the federal regulator) . The spills caused an 
estimated $115 million in property damage .164 
ETP’s violations go beyond pipeline spills and construction 
mishaps . A database combining violations and enforcement 
data across federal agencies (including environmental 
violations, energy market manipulation, workplace safety or 
health violations, and pipeline safety violations) shows ETP to 
have been subject to 146 enforcement actions and fined more than $355 million since 2000 .165 Among fine and violations 
included in this database, ETP is among the worst-ranked 
pipeline companies, followed by Enbridge (42 violations,  
$248 million in fines) and Kinder Morgan (127 violations,  
$164 million in fines) .166 These violations involve labor 
practices, workplace safety, clean air violations, market 
manipulation, and others .167
ETP’s Track Record of Spills  
and Violations
Since 2002, PHMSA has issued 106 violations against ETP and 
Sunoco and related subsidiaries, and fined them $5,675,870 . 
These violations include failures to inspect crossings under 
waterways, failures to repair unsafe pipe for five years, failure 
to report unsafe conditions, repeated failures to properly 
notify emergency responders and the public, and others .168 

TOO FAR TOO OFTEN | 22The construction of the Rover and Mariner pipelines have 
been marked with spills, environmental violations, and stop-
work orders . The two pipelines are designed to transport 
natural gas and liquids from the Utica and Marcellus shale 
production areas . By March 2018, after only 13 months of 
construction, Rover had spilled more than 2 .2 million gallons 
of drilling fluids, industrial waste, and/or sediment, amassing 
more than 100 violations/non-compliance incidents and four 
stop work orders for failure to comply with environmental 
regulations . Mariner construction has led to 108 “inadvertent” 
releases in numerous locations along the route, leading to 
more than 50 violations, and several reports of private water 
wells being impacted by construction activities .169 
Assuming the U  .S . system-wide rate for significant crude 
oil spills170 of 0 .001 per year per mile, Greenpeace USA has 
projected that the DAPL and its southern component ETCO 
would suffer 96 significant spills and Louisiana’s Bayou Bridge 
Pipeline would suffer eight significant spills, during a 50-year 
nominal lifetime .
ETP and its subsidiaries also reported 58 incidents to PHMSA 
from their extensive natural gas pipeline network  . Natural gas 
pipelines bring with them risks of explosions and exposure 
to harmful substances; in 2017, for instance, a home in Texas 
was reportedly sprayed with hydrogen sulfide gas and natural 
gas condensate after the rupture of ETP’s nearby, mostly 
unregulated natural gas gathering line .171 
In 2005, Sunoco’s Pennsylvania refineries were subject to a 
comprehensive Clean Air Act settlement that included a  
$3 million civil penalty, $3 .9 million spent on supplementary 
environmental projects, and $285 million to install emissions controls .172 The settlement was aimed at reducing emissions 
of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, hazardous air pollutants 
that can “cause serious respiratory problems and exacerbate 
asthma in children . ”173 In 2018 Sunoco (along with BP and 
Shell) agreed to pay the State of New Jersey $64 million to 
settle a lawsuit alleging contamination of groundwater from 
the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether  .174 
An analysis of EPA’s 2015 Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data 
conducted by the Political Economy Research Institute175 placed 
ETP among the “Toxic 100 Air Polluters, ” ranking ETP 75 in 
air toxics pollution176 and 83 in greenhouse gas pollution .177 
ETP also scored poorly on two environmental-justice metrics 
measuring the impact of air pollution on minorities and 
people living in poverty, largely because of emissions from the 
Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery, in which ETP holds a 50 
percent stake along with the Carlyle Group  . The refinery filed for 
bankruptcy in 2018 .178 ETP did not rank in the top 100 for water 
emissions, but pipeline spills are not reported under TRI .179 
Workplace Safety, Labor,  
and Other Violations
In general, the oil industry has one of the highest rates 
of severe workplace injury among its workers .180 In 2016, 
workers filed a lawsuit after suffering severe burns and 
injuries when safety equipment failed while they were 
servicing a Sunoco pipeline .181 Since 2000, ETP has been 
fined 39 times for workplace safety violations, resulting 
in more than $1 .4 million in fines .182 These include large 
fines for multiple violations — including repeat and serious 
violations — found at Sunoco’s facilities in Oregon, OH,183 
Westville, NJ,184 and Marcus Hook, PA .185 ETP has been 
fined three times by the National Labor Relations Board for 
back wages resulting from “unfair labor practices” totaling 
$177,000, and five times by the Department of Labor’s Wage 
and Hour Division, totaling $484,000 .186
Claims that ETP manipulated wholesale natural gas prices 
at the Houston Ship Channel hub during a period from 2003 
to 2005 led to a “record” $30 million settlement with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,187 and an additional 
$10 million penalty from the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission .188 FERC noted that it was the “highest amount 
of any settlement related to an enforcement action since 
Congress gave FERC enhanced enforcement authority under 
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 . ”189

Conclusion
Energy Transfer Partners made numerous mistakes and transgressions during the development 
and construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Its lack of respect for the rights and the free, 
prior, informed consent of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe; its continuous disregard of the 
suggestions and recommendations of government agencies, clients, and international human 
rights groups; and its condoning of militarized use of force against Water Protectors and allies 
at Standing Rock are all alarming. 
ETP’s behaviour led many banks (including ING190, DNB 
Capital191, and BNP Paribas192) to formally break ties with the 
project, selling out their stake in the $2 .5 billion DAPL project 
loan and/or further distancing themselves from the company  . 
The track record of ETP and related companies on pipeline 
spills and construction-related incidents is problematic — 
averaging about one spill every 11 days between 2002 and 
2017 . Already in 2018, the company has had significant spill 
incidents and safety violations on its pipelines currently under 
development, which has led to fines, penalties, and delays . 
Although it was only completed in 2017, DAPL has already had 
7 spill incidents .193 
Communities living in the shadow of ETP’s pipeline projects, 
including Rover, Bayou Bridge, and Mariner East 2, have faced 
harassment, loss of private property, both the threat as well as 
the consequence of pipeline spills, and more . For those who 
stand up to the company, some face retaliatory litigation and 
harsher laws which restrict free speech and freedom to dissent  . Despite global controversy following the events at Standing 
Rock, ETP and related companies continue to exercise legal 
tactics and lobbying efforts aimed at silencing opposition, 
and to retain private security firms with a track record of 
aggressive tactics . ETP’s unwillingness or inability to learn the 
necessary corporate lessons from DAPL should raise concerns 
among the company’s institutional financiers, who are 
exposed — as they were on DAPL — to the reputational and 
financial impacts of ETP’s unacceptable practices .
In light of ETP’s ongoing approach to human rights, and its 
poor record on pipeline spills and safety, we believe that 
banks should end any current financial relationship with ETP 
and related companies, and should not provide any further 
financial services, including loans, to the companies .
