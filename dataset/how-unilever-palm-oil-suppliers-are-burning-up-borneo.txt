In November 2007, Greenpeace released Cooking the Climate , an 82-page
report summarising the findings of a two-year investigation that revealed howthe world’s largest food, cosmetic and biofuel companies were driving thewholesale destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests and peatlands through growingpalm oil consumption.
This follow-up report provides further evidence of the expansion of the palm oil
sector in Indonesia into remaining rainforests, orang-utan habitat and peatlandsin Kalimantan. It links the majority of the largest producers in Indonesia toUnilever, probably the largest palm oil corporate consumer in the world.
Unilever uses 1.3Mt of palm oil or palm oil derivative every year – about 3% 
of global production.
1About half of Unilever’s palm oil supply comes from
Indonesia.2As recently as 2005, Unilever purchased 1 in every 20 tonnes
produced in the country.3
Unilever has failed to use its power to lead the palm oil sector towardsustainability, either through its own palm oil purchasing – its primary suppliersin Indonesia represent over a third of the country’s palm oil production
4– or
through its role as leader of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),whose members represent 40% of global palm oil production.
5
Through analysis of maps, satellite data, and on-the-ground investigationsbetween February and April 2008, Greenpeace has mapped out howexpansion of the oil palm plantations in Central Kalimantan is fuelling climate change and helping drive orang-utans to the brink of extinction. AsGreenpeace investigations show, this expansion into the Indonesian territory of the island of Borneo has in large part been led by companies who areUnilever suppliers and RSPO members.
NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS EXPANSION BY             
PALM OIL SUPPLIERS IS DRIVING
SPECIES EXTINCTION IN CENTRAL KALIMANTANAND FUELING CLIMATE CHANGE 


This destruction is set to get worse. By 2030, demand for palm oil is predicted
to more than double that of 2000.6Between 2006 and 2016 alone, palm oil
production is set to increase by close to 15Mt.7
To meet this growth in demand, major producers including Unilever suppliersand RSPO members are expanding their plantation areas into forests andpeatlands in Indonesia.
8This expansion – often illegal9and in breach of RSPO
principles and criteria10– is not only bad for wildlife, it is also bad for the climate
and bad for governance.
Unilever itself is implicated in the impacts of this expansion through rapidly
growing brand platforms that use significant quantities of palm oil and palm oilderivatives from companies operating in Indonesia. Product brands and brandplatforms include Dove , Dirt is Good (Persil , Omo, Surf Excel ), Knorr ,
HeartBrand (Walls ) and HealthyHeart (Flora/Becel ).
Greenpeace investigations provide new evidence that it is Unilever’s own palm
oil traders and producers (themselves RSPO members) who are leading‘aggressive expansion’ of the sector that results in the devastation of the lastremaining orang-utan rainforest and peatland habitat in Borneo. 
By failing to apply and enforce RSPO principles and criteria to both traders and
producers at group level, Unilever has failed to bring the rapidly expandingpalm oil sector under control. The growth of global brands and brand platformssuch as Dove and Dirt is Good is creating incentives for Unilever’s suppliers to
expand, ‘leading to the devastation of the last remaining rain forests inBorneo’.
11As it stands, Unilever suppliers are driving species extinction, climate
change through the significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions linked todeforestation and peatland destruction, and land conflict with forest-dependentcommunities.
Given the urgent nature of the crisis, the only solution for the global climate,
the regional environment, the wildlife and the forest-dependent communitiesrelying upon Indonesia’s forest resources is a moratorium on oil palmexpansion into rainforest and peatland areas.

The 2020 map shows probable orang-utan distribution only in areas
where distribution of 2004 matches predicted forest cover 2020. 

Indonesia now has the fastest deforestation rate
of any major forested country.14Losing 2% of its
remaining forest every year, Indonesia has earneda place in the Guinness World Records.15
According to World Bank estimates, between 1985 and
1997 alone, 60% of the lowland rainforest of Kalimantanand Sumatra was destroyed.
16The United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) estimates that 98% ofIndonesia’s lowland forest may be destroyed by 2022.
17
Indonesia also holds the global record for GHG emissions from
deforestation, which puts it in third place behind the USA andChina in terms of total GHG emissions from human industry.
18
The destruction of Indonesia’s peat swamp forests alone is oneof the largest sources of GHG emissions in the world. Thelargest portion of these emissions is associated with fires toclear the land for agricultural development.
19
Indonesia’s emissions from destroyed or degraded peatland are
around 1.8Gt CO 2per year,20equivalent to 4% of total GHG
emissions,21from less than 0.1% of the world’s land surface.22
If predicted expansion in oil palm plantations goes ahead, peatlandemissions of CO 2are set to rise by at least 50% by 2030.23
Recent Greenpeace analysis and investigations
confirm that expansion in oil palm plantationsby Unilever suppliers is having a serious impacton their habitat. Orang-utans – one of our nearest biological relatives – survive
only in the dwindling tropical rainforests of Borneo andnorthern Sumatra:25they depend on the forest for food and
nesting sites.26Cutting down forest for timber or conversion to
plantations is the main cause of their decline,27and today
orang-utans are at high risk of extinction in the wild. THE IMPACTS OF DEFORESTATION
IN INDONESIA



ORANG-UTAN DISTRIBUTION IN CENTRAL KALIMANTAN:
IMPACT OF 2000–2007 DEFORESTATION AND PROJECTEDIMPACT OF CURRENT OIL PALM CONCESSIONS 
A 2007 UNEP report recognises that oil palm plantations are
now the leading cause of rainforest destruction inIndonesia.
33Between 1991 and 2006, almost 5 million
hectares of new oil palm concession areas have beenestablished in Indonesia alone,
34equivalent to over 50
football pitches an hour. Much of this area was previouslyforest or peatland. The Indonesian Palm Oil ResearchInstitute (IOPRI) estimates that two-thirds of all currentlyproductive oil palm plantations involved deforestation.
35
On top of Indonesia’s existing 6 million hectares of oilpalms,
36the country’s central government has plans for
another 4 million hectares by 2015 dedicated to biofuelproduction alone.
37Provincial governments are even more
ambitious in terms of oil palm expansion, planning for anadditional 20 million hectares.
38
Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo,which it shares with Malaysia and Brunei, has some ofIndonesia’s largest remaining areas of forest habitat. This ishome to most of the world’s remaining orang-utans. While most current palm oil production is concentrated in
Riau and North Sumatra, oil palm groups are rapidlyexpanding their landbanks and clearing new areas. In WestKalimantan, by 2007 oil palm concessions had beengranted on more than 3.2 million ha.
39In Central Kalimantan,
by 2006 oil palm concessions had been granted on 1.1million ha.
40
As a 2008 Greenpeace investigation reveals, much of thisarea – which overlaps critical orang-utan habitat – is beingcleared of valuable forest, the peatlands drained and theland burned as oil palm plantation area expands.
As orang-utans and other species lose their rainforests to oil
palm plantations, they are deprived of their natural source offood. Seeking to survive off young palm plants, hungryorang-utans can become ‘pests’ to oil palm producers, andplantation workers commonly kill orang-utans to protect thecrop.
41According to the Centre for Orangutan Protection, at
least 1,500 orang-utans died in 2006 as a result ofdeliberate attacks by plantation workers.

These maps overlay several data sets. Orang-utan distribution is based on 2005 maps compiled by WWF.
28 The oil palm concession boundaries are based on 2006 work by Forest Watch Indonesia.
29Deforestation data is based on 2007 maps developed by Sarvision–Wageningen University in collaboration with theIndonesian Ministry of Forestry. The first map shows 2004 orang-utan distribution in Central Kalimantan.The second map projects the impact of 2000–2007 deforestation on orang-utan distribution. The third mapoverlays this with oil palm concessions. The fourth map projects that all remaining orang-utan habitatwithin concession areas will be lost.

‘The Bornean orang-utan is classified as Endangered […] indicating that it has a
very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future. The Sumatran orang-utanis classified as Critically Endangered […] indicating that it has an extremely highrisk of extinction in the wild in the near future. Since 1900, the number ofSumatran orang-utans is thought to have fallen by about 91%, with a rapidlyaccelerating loss towards the end of the twentieth century.’ United Nations Environment Programme, 2007

PROJECTED IMPACT OF 2006–2007 FIRE HOTSPOTS IN RELATION TO CURRENT OIL PALM CONCESSIONS 10
‘The main areas remaining for new
extensive plantations are the largetracts of tropical peatlands – untilrecently virgin rainforest areas. Over 50% of new plantations areplanned in these peatland areas.’ Wetlands International, 2007Peatlands
Fire hotspotsOil palm concessions
In Central Kalimantan, between 2006 and 2007, one orang-
utan rescue centre retrieved more than 200 orang-utansfrom oil palm plantations.
43Greenpeace has evidence of
orang-utans found on concessions belonging to Unileversuppliers.
44
Oil palm plantation expansion takes place with little oversightfrom central or local government. Procedures forenvironmental impact assessment, land-use planning andensuring a proper process for development of concessionsare neglected. 
Many new plantations are located on peat that should be
off-limits to development or degradation according toIndonesian law.
45This stipulates that land should not be
allocated for oil palm plantations on peat soils deeper than 2 metres; in addition, activities that damage upstream naturalswamp forests with deep peat (more than 3 metres) areprohibited.
46In other words, palm oil development on such
peatlands is illegal. Greenpeace has documented suchclearance on concessions belonging to Unilever suppliers.
47The use of fire to clear forest areas is the largest source ofGHG emissions in the world.
48The practice has been illegal
in Indonesia since 1999,49yet remains commonplace among
palm oil producers. Greenpeace has identified thousands offire hotspots (areas visible on satellite images used tomonitor forest fires) on concessions belonging to Unileversuppliers during the period 2006–2007.
50
Social conflict, including land rights and resource conflicts, is often associated with oil palm plantation expansion.
51
Greenpeace has evidence of such conflicts resulting fromthe establishment of concessions belonging to Unileversuppliers.
52

These maps overlay several data sets: peatland
distribution maps, 30oil palm concession boundaries
based on 2006 work by Forest Watch Indonesia,
31
and fire hotspots identified by NASA satelliteimagery.
32The first map shows peatland distribution
in Central Kalimantan. The second map overlaysthis with 2006 – 2007 fire hotspot data. The thirdmap overlays this with oil palm concessions,showing where they all overlap.

UNILEVER SUPPLIERS SINAR MAS, IOI, 
ADM-KUOK-WILMAR, SIME DARBY, MUSIM MAS, ASTRA AGRO AND ASIAN AGRI ARE PUSHING EXTINCTION
Unilever acknowledges that it has no idea where about 20%
of its palm oil comes from. Of the remaining 80%, it knowsthe group supplying the palm oil, but not necessarily theconcession areas from which it originates.
53
Palm oil producers linked to Unilever include Sinar Mas, IOI,ADM-Kuok-Wilmar, Sime Darby, Musim Mas, Astra Agro andAsian Agri. 
Greenpeace analysis of deforestation maps, satellite data of
fire hotspots, and orang-utan distribution maps, as well asfield investigations of oil palm operations in CentralKalimantan, show these Unilever suppliers laying claim tolarge tracts of forest and peatland, with devastating impactson climate and biodiversity. UNILEVER’S TRADERS ARE DEALING 
WITH BAD COMPANIES
Many of the largest producers in Indonesia that supply
Unilever directly are also traders. This means that asignificant portion of the palm oil they sell may come fromthird parties as well as their own operations. In this way, the identity of groups heavily reliant on deforestation andpeatland clearance is lost in the supply chain. Producer–traders include Sinar Mas, IOI, ADM-Kuok-Wilmar, Sime Darby, Musim Mas and Asian Agri. 
Another significant palm oil refiner and trader,
54RSPO
member,55and supplier to Unilever is the agricultural
commodity giant Cargill. It is the largest privately-ownedcompany in the world.
56
Industry sources confirm that roughly half of the palm oilimported into Europe by Cargill comes from Indonesia.
57
According to export data for 2007, Cargill’s Singaporetrading arm exported palm oil from 15 different oil palmconcession holders in Indonesia.
58These include some of
Indonesia’s largest palm oil producers: Sinar Mas, Wilmar,Musim Mas, Astra Agro and Asian Agri.
59
Greenpeace has traced palm oil from a Cargill refinery inEurope to Knorr , one of Unilever’s high profile brands. Cargill
is also one of Unilever’s European suppliers of palm oil forice cream.
60
PALM OIL SUPPLIERS ARE
LEADING AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION
‘A scenario released by UNEP in 2002
suggested that most natural rainforest inIndonesia would be degraded by 2032.Given the rate of deforestation in the pastfive years, and recent widespreadinvestment in oil palm plantations andbiodiesel refineries, this may have beenoptimistic. New estimates suggest that 98%of the forest may be destroyed by 2022,the lowland forest much sooner.’ United Nations EnvironmentProgramme, 2007

SINAR MAS IS INDONESIA’S LARGEST 
OIL PALM PLANTATION COMPANY
SINAR MAS IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE PALM OIL
SECTOR AND IS A MEMBER OF THE RSPOSinar Mas is a RSPO member through its oil palm plantationsubsidiary PT SMART.
61
The Sinar Mas Group accounts for almost 10% of palm oilproduction in Indonesia.
62The Group produces not just crude
palm oil, but also palm kernel oil and a wide range of refinedproducts for both food and industrial purposes.
63
In 2008, Sinar Mas branded itself ‘No. 1 in Indonesia’64for total
planted plantation area. This empire includes 360,000ha ofplantation: some 213,000ha in Sumatra, 135,000ha inKalimantan and 12,000ha in Papua.
65
Sinar Mas claims to have ‘the largest land bank in the worldfor new plantations’
66and has publicly announced plans to
expand its holdings by 1.3 million ha in the heavily forestedprovince of Papua and in Kalimantan.
67However, an internal
company presentation obtained by Greenpeace indicates thatthe company plans to develop a rainforest area of up to 2.8million ha in Papua.
68The Sinar Mas Group is involved in ‘aggressive plantationsexpansion’
69– ‘the most aggressive new planting programme
among the plantation companies’70– planting 53,000ha in
2007 with plans to plant at least 60,000ha in 2008,71
representing a growth in plantation area of over a third in atwo-year period.
72Judging by past operations and known
landbank, the vast majority of this will involve deforestation,some on peatlands and in critical orang-utan habitat.
UNILEVER’S LINKS TO SINAR MAS
Despite Sinar Mas’ ‘legacy issues’
73– including defaulting on
most of the $13.4 billion debt of its APP subsidiary in 200174–
Unilever has maintained a long-standing relationship with thecompany. A 1999 Sinar Mas document states: ‘Our majorcustomers include Cargill and Unilever. These sales weremade through foreign brokers or directly to the importerlocated in the countries to which the products wereexported.’
75The Sinar Mas 2004 and 2006 Annual Reports76
also indicate that Unilever has been an important client in2003–2006, along with Nestlé and Carrefour.

IOI AND UNILEVER’S LONG HISTORY
IOI IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE PALM OIL 
SECTOR AND IS A MEMBER OF THE RSPOThe IOI Group has a plantation land holding of nearly170,000ha in Malaysia (of which 149,000ha is planted) andanother 152,000ha in Kalimantan in Indonesia (of which43,000ha is planted) via a joint venture,
78with 72% of its
Indonesian holdings yet to be planted. These holdingsinclude 63,000ha in Central Kalimantan.
79
IOI has been involved in oleo chemicals since 1980.80In
2006, IOI emerged as the world’s largest producer of oleochemicals – chemicals often derived from palm oil that areused in cosmetics, laundry detergents and other householdproducts. IOI has a total fatty acid production capacity of700,000 tonnes a year.
81
In 2007, the Group produced 790,000 tonnes of crudepalm oil representing more than 2% of global production.
82
It also produced 185,000 tonnes of palm kernel oil,83
representing more than 4% of global production.84
In 2007, IOI is estimated to have produced around 180,000tonnes of crude palm oil in Indonesia,
85accounting for just
over 1% of Indonesian production.
UNILEVER’S LINKS TO IOI
IOI has had a long association with Unilever. In 2002–2003,IOI bought the palm oil refining company Loders Croklaanfrom Unilever
86at the same time as it acquired Unilever’s
Malaysian oil palm plantations.87Announcing the deal,
Unilever stated: ‘Loders Croklaan will continue to supplyUnilever with specialty products.’
88
In 2007 and 2008, IOI Rotterdam confirmed that it suppliesUnilever from its Dutch refineries.
89
In 2008, Unilever named IOI as one of its principlesuppliers.
90
‘The proposed Joint Venture is in line with
the Group’s strategy of growing its corepalm oil business […]. It will provideimmediate addition to planted hectarageas well as substantial suitable land bankfor sustained business growth, henceproviding the Group with the opportunityto capitalise on the very favourableoutlook for the oil palm industry.

ADM-WILMAR-KUOK IS ONE OF THE WORLD’S
LARGEST PRIVATELY OWNED GROUPS
THE ADM-KUOK-WILMAR ALLIANCE IS A MAJOR
PLAYER IN THE PALM OIL SECTOR AND IS AMEMBER OF THE RSPOWilmar is a RSPO member. It claims to be the world’s largestproducer of palm oil based biodiesel.
91The Group – effectively
a shareholder alliance between ADM92and the Kuok family93–
also controls about 570,000ha of concession area (just over athird of this has been cleared and planted), palm oil refineriesand biodiesel plants across Indonesia and Malaysia.
94Of this,
some 493,000ha is in Indonesia.95
In 2007, Indonesian production for the Wilmar Group wasaround 540,000 tonnes of crude palm oil, accounting formore than 3% of Indonesia production.
96Although Wilmar
owns substantial concession areas, more than 55% of itspalm oil production comes from third party plantations.
97
The Kuok Group was founded by Robert Kuok Hock-Nien, the uncle of William Kuok, one of Wilmar’s founders.According to Forbes, in 2005, Robert Kuok Hock-Nien wasthe richest man in Asia.
98The US-headquartered ADM claims to be the world’s leadingprocessor of agricultural crops and Europe’s leader inbiofuels.
99The company also trades crude palm oil on the
Chicago futures market (meaning contracts are signed andtraded months ahead of delivery).
100ADM is one of Cargill’s
main competitors in the palm oil sector,101although through
Wilmar, the alliance also trades with Cargill.102
UNILEVER’S LINKS TO ADM-KUOK-WILMARIn a 2006 declaration to institutional investors, Wilmarannounced that its key international customers include Procter& Gamble, Cargill, Unilever, Nestlé and China Grains & OilsGroup Corporation.
103
In the UK, most if not all of Unilever’s palm oil is supplied byADM.
104The company operates a refinery immediately next
door to Unilever’s margarine factory outside London. Reportedas the largest margarine factory in the world,
105the Unilever
factory produces brands such as Flora and Bertolli.106The
ADM refinery handles more than 300,000 tonnes of edible oilsa year, including palm oil.
107In addition to supplying products
to the Unilever factory, the company delivers products to awide range of food factories around the UK and overseas.
108
Unilever also has trade links to the Kuok Group. For instance,Unilever Pakistan purchased almost 100 tonnes of palm kerneloil from the Group in August 2007.
109Kuok Group is known 
to source palm oil from Astra Agro as well as other third-partysuppliers.
110
In 2008, Unilever named Kuok-Wilmar as one of its principle suppliers.

to ensure the livelihoods of millions of people who depend 
on forests. 
Forest destruction is responsible for about one fifth of global
GHG emissions – Indonesia and the Amazon are by far thetwo largest sources of GHG emissions from deforestation.Emissions from Indonesia’s degraded peatlands represent 4%of global GHG emissions, but the area of degraded peatlandsinvolved is relatively small – about 10 million hectares or lessthan 0.1% of the Earth’s land surface.
If we are to prevent dangerous global climate change, we
need a global effort to halt forest destruction as well asbringing about a drastic reduction in our use of coal, oil andgas by using energy more efficiently and utilising cleanersources of energy.
In order to help protect the climate, Greenpeace is calling for
an end to deforestation in Indonesia – the largest source ofGHG emissions from deforestation. 
A halt to further rainforest destruction in Indonesia is also
critical to ensuring the future for critically endangered speciessuch as the orang-utan.WHAT DOES THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT
NEED TO DO?
STOP THE PROBLEM: ZERO DEFORESTATION
Establish a moratorium on forest clearance and peatlanddegradation and ensure enforcement of the moratorium.
START THE SOLUTION: CLIMATE PROTECTION
Prioritise protection of remaining peat swamp forests and otherforest areas with high carbon storage capacity, biodiversityvalues and benefits for indigenous peoples and other localcommunities.
START THE SOLUTION: CUT ONGOING EMISSIONS
Rehabilitate degraded peatland areas with natural and native flora.
WHAT DO UNILEVER AND THE PALM OIL
SECTOR NEED TO DO? 
STOP THE PROBLEM: SUPPORT ZERO
DEFORESTATIONSupport a moratorium on forest clearance and peatlanddegradation.
START THE SOLUTION: CLEAN UP THE TRADE
Do not trade with those engaged in deforestation andpeatland degradation.
Inform suppliers that purchasers will no longer buy from
companies engaged in forest conversion and peatlanddegradation.TIME FOR ACTION: A MORATORIUM ON 
OIL PALM EXPANSION INTO INDONESIA’SRAINFORESTS AND PEATLANDS
‘A moratorium will be a strong signal. [It] can be a first step in countering peatland
degradation [,] to buy time to maximise the new opportunity of carbon finance. A moratorium needs to be part of a longer-term strategy of land-use planning.’ Yogyakarta statement, endorsed by the Indonesian Minister of theEnvironment, August 2007

‘The simplest and most effective measure to prevent a further increase
in fires and CO2emissions is by conservation of remaining peat
swamp forests and rehabilitation of degraded peat swamp forests.’ Wetlands International, 2006
