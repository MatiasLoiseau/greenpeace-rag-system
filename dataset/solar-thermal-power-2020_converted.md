FOREWORD

THE VISION IS CLEAR: SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS CAN BECOME
THE OFFSHORE WIND FARMS OF THE DESERT – EXPLOITING THE HEAT
FROM THE SUN TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE.

This report demonstrates that there are no technical,
economic or resource barriers to supplying 5% of the world’s
electricity needs from solar thermal power alone by 2040 –
even against the challenging backdrop of a projected more
than doubling in global electricity demand. The solar thermal
industry is capable of becoming a dynamic, innovative €15
billion annual business within 20 years, unlocking a new global
era of economic, technological and environmental progress.

The benefits of solar power are compelling: environmental
protection, economic growth, job creation, diversity of fuel
supply and rapid deployment, as well as the global potential
for technology transfer and innovation. The underlying
advantage of solar energy is that the fuel is free, abundant and
inexhaustible. The total amount of energy irradiated from the
sun to the earth’s surface is enough to provide for annual
global energy consumption 10,000 times over.

On climate change, a solid international consensus now
clearly states that business-as-usual is not an option and the
world must move swiftly towards a clean energy economy.
Solar thermal power is a prime choice in developing an
affordable, feasible, global energy source that is able to
substitute for fossil fuels in the sunbelts around the world.

Electricity for 100 million people
Greenpeace and the European Solar Thermal Power Industry
Association (ESTIA) have together produced this report in order
to update our understanding of the contribution that solar
thermal power can make to the world’s energy supply. The report
is a practical blueprint to show that solar thermal power is
capable of supplying electricity to more than 100 million people
living in the sunniest parts of the world within two decades.

Modern solar thermal power plants provide bulk power
equivalent to the output from conventional power stations
and can be built in a matter of months. The aim of this
blueprint is to push further forward the boundaries of
technological progress and unlock the benefits that will

follow. Solar thermal power does not need to be invented,
nor is there a need to wait for any magical ‘breakthrough’; it
is ready for global implementation today.

The vision is clear: solar thermal power plants can
become the offshore wind farms of the desert –
exploiting the heat from the sun to combat
climate change.

Urgent political commitment
The solid industrial and political commitment to the expansion of
the solar thermal power plant industry outlined in this report
shows clearly that the current surge of activity in the solar
electricity sector represents merely a foretaste of the massive
transformation and expansion it is capable of over the coming
decades. But although reports are a useful guide, it is people
who change the world by their actions. We encourage politicians
and policy-makers, global citizens, energy officials, companies,
investors and other interested parties to support solar thermal
power by taking concrete steps which will help ensure that
hundreds of millions of people will receive their electricity from
the sun, harnessing its full potential for our common good.

Following last year’s Earth Summit, the Johannesburg
Renewable Energy Coalition was formed, with more than
80 countries proclaiming that their goal is to “substantially
increase the global share of renewable energy sources” on the
basis of “clear and ambitious time-bound targets”. Political
declarations mean little if not put into practice. This report is a
blueprint for action that governments can implement, and
shows what is possible with just one renewable technology.

Solar thermal power is a global scale technology that has the
capacity to satisfy the energy and development needs of the
world without destroying it.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Power from the Sun
Solar thermal power is a relatively new technology which has
already shown enormous promise. With few environmental
impacts and a massive resource, it offers an opportunity to
the sunniest countries of the world comparable to the
breakthrough offshore wind farms are currently offering
European nations with the windiest shorelines.

generation costs ranging today between 10 and 13 US
cents/kWh. However, costs are expected to fall closer to
5 US cents in the future. Advanced technologies, mass
production, economies of scale and improved operation
will together enable a reduction in the cost of solar
electricity to a level competitive with fossil power plants
within the next 10 to 15 years.

Solar thermal power uses direct sunlight, so it must be
sited in regions with high direct solar radiation. Among the
most promising areas of the world are the South-Western
United States, Central and South America, Africa, the
Middle East, the Mediterranean countries of Europe, Iran,
Pakistan and the desert regions of India, the former Soviet
Union, China and Australia.

In many regions of the world, one square kilometre of land
is enough to generate as much as 100-200 Gigawatt hours
(GWh) of electricity per year using solar thermal technology.
This is equivalent to the annual production of a 50 MW
conventional coal or gas-fired power plant. Worldwide, the
exploitation of less than 1% of the total solar thermal
potential would be enough to stabilise the world climate
through massive CO2 reductions.

Turning Solar Heat into Electricity
Producing electricity from the energy in the sun’s rays is a
relatively straightforward process. Direct solar radiation can
be concentrated and collected by a range of Concentrating
Solar Power (CSP) technologies to provide medium to high
temperature heat. This heat is then used to operate a
conventional power cycle, for example through a steam or
gas turbine or a Stirling engine. Solar heat collected during
the day can also be stored in liquid, solid or phase changing
media like molten salts, ceramics, concrete, or in the future,
phase changing salt mixtures. At night, it can be extracted
from the storage medium to run the steam turbine.

Solar thermal power plants can be designed for solar-only
generation, ideally to satisfy demand during daylight hours,
but with future storage systems their operation can be
extended to almost base load requirements.

Electricity from solar thermal power is also becoming
cheaper to produce. Plants operating in California have
already achieved impressive cost reductions, with

Technology, Costs and Benefits
Four main elements are required to produce electricity
from solar thermal power: a concentrator, a receiver, some
form of a heat transport, storage and power conversion
equipment much the same as for a fossil fuel-based plant.
The three most promising solar thermal technologies are
the parabolic trough, the central receiver or solar tower,
and the parabolic dish.

Parabolic trough systems use trough-shaped mirror
reflectors to concentrate sunlight on to receiver tubes
through which a thermal transfer fluid is heated to roughly
400°C and then used to produce superheated steam. They
represent the most mature solar thermal power technology,
with 354 MWe of plants connected to the Southern
California grid since the 1980s and more than two square
kilometres of parabolic trough collectors. These plants
supply an annual 800 million kWh – enough for more than
200,000 households – at a generation cost of about 10-13
US cents/kWh.

Further advances are now being made in the technology,
with utility scale projects planned in Greece, Spain, Egypt,
Mexico, India, Morocco, Iran, Israel, Italy, the United States
and Algeria. Electricity from trough plants combined with
gas-fired combined cycle plants – ISCC (Integrated Solar
Combined Cycle) systems – is expected to cost
6 €cents/kWh today and 5 €cents in medium terms.

Central receiver (solar tower) systems use a circular array
of large individually-tracking mirrors (heliostats) to
concentrate sunlight on to a central receiver mounted on
top of a tower, with heat transferred for power generation
through a choice of transfer media. After an intermediate
scaling up to 30 MW capacity, solar tower developers now
feel confident that grid-connected tower power plants can
be built up to a capacity of 200 MWe solar-only units. Use
of thermal storages will increase their flexibility.

Although central receiver plants are considered to be
further from commercialisation than parabolic trough
systems, solar towers have good longer term prospects for
high conversion efficiencies. Projects are in various stages
of development (from assessment to implementation) in
Spain, South Africa and the United States. In the future,
central receiver plant projects will benefit from similar cost
reductions to those expected from parabolic trough plants.
The anticipated evolution of total electricity costs is that
they will drop to 5 cents/kWh in the mid to long term.

Parabolic dish systems are comparatively small units
which use a dish-shaped reflector to concentrate sunlight,
and heated gas or air to generate power in a small engine
at the focal point of the reflector. Their potential lies
primarily in decentralised power supply and remote,
stand-alone power systems. Projects are currently planned
in the United States, Australia and Europe. In terms of
electricity costs, an attainable mid-term goal is a figure of
less than 15 cents/kWh.

Current trends show that two broad pathways have
opened up for large scale delivery of electricity using
solar thermal power. One is the ISCC-type hybrid
operation of solar collection and heat transfer combined
with a conventional state-of-art combined cycle gas-fired
power plant. The other is solar-only operation, with a
conventional steam turbine, increasing use of a storage
medium such as molten salt. This enables solar energy
collected during the day to be stored and then
dispatched when demand requires.

A major benefit of solar thermal power is that it has little
environmental impact, with none of the polluting emissions
or safety concerns associated with conventional
generation technologies. There is no pollution in the form
of exhaust gases during operation. Decommissioning a
system is unproblematic.

Each square metre of surface in a solar field is enough to
avoid the annual production of 200 kilograms (kg) of
carbon dioxide. Solar power can therefore make a
substantial contribution towards international commitments
to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases which contribute
to climate change.

The Global Solar Thermal Market
New opportunities are opening up for solar thermal power
as a result of the global search for clean energy solutions.
Both national and international initiatives are supporting
the technology, encouraging commercialisation of

production. A number of countries have introduced
legislation which forces power suppliers to source a rising
percentage of their supply from renewable fuels. Bulk
power high voltage transmission lines from high insulation
sites, such as in northern Africa, could encourage
European utilities to finance large solar plants whose
power would be used in Europe.

These and other factors have led to significant interest in
constructing plants in the sunbelt regions. In addition,
interest rates and capital costs have drastically fallen
worldwide, increasing the viability of capital intensive
renewable energy projects. Examples of specific large solar
thermal projects currently planned around the world,
evidence of the “race to be first”, include:

• Algeria:

• Australia:

• Egypt:

140 MW ISCC plant with 35 MW

The Future for Solar Thermal Power
A scenario prepared by Greenpeace International and the
European Solar Thermal Power Industry Association
projects what could be achieved by the year 2020 given
the right market conditions. It is based on expected
advances in solar thermal technology coupled with the
growing number of countries which are supporting
projects in order to achieve both climate change and
power supply objectives.

Over the period of the scenario, solar thermal technology
will have emerged from a relatively marginal position in the
hierarchy of renewable energy sources to achieve a
substantial status alongside the current market leaders
such as hydro and wind power. From a current level of just
354 MW, by 2015 the total installed capacity of solar
thermal power plants will have reached 5,000 MW. By
2020 additional capacity would be rising at a level of
almost 4,500 MW each year.

• By 2020, the total installed capacity of solar thermal

power around the world will have reached 201,540 MW.

• Solar thermal power will have achieved an annual output

of more than 54,600,000 MWh (54.6 TWh) This is
equivalent to the consumption of over one third of
Australia’s electricity demand.

• Capital investment in solar thermal plant will rise from
US$ 375 million in 2005 to almost US$ 7.6 billion in
2020. The total investment over the scenario period
would amount to US$ 41.8 bn.

• Expansion in the solar thermal power industry will result

in the creation of 200,000 jobs worldwide, even not
counting those involved in production of the hardware.

Mexico, Australia and South Africa.

• Over the period up to 2020 a total of 154 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide would be saved from being emitted
into the atmosphere, making an important contribution to
international climate protection targets.

A further projection is also made for the potential
expansion of the solar thermal power market over another
two decades up to 2040. This shows that by 2030 the
world-wide capacity will have reached 106,000 MW, and
by 2040 a level of almost 630,000 MW. Increased
availability of plants because of the greater use of efficient
storage technology will also increase the amount of
electricity generated from a given installed capacity.

The result if that by 2040 more than 5% of the world’s
electricity demand could be satisfied by solar thermal power.

These early designs formed the basis for R&D
developments in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when
solar thermal projects were undertaken in a number of
industrialised countries, including the United
States, Russia, Japan, Spain and Italy (see
Table 1). Many of these plants, covering the
whole spectrum of available technology,
failed to reach the expected
performance levels, and
subsequent R& D has

improvement and

size of unit.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER
– THE BASICS

1. Power from the Sun
Solar thermal power is a relatively new
technology which has already shown
enormous promise. With few environmental
impacts and a massive resource, it offers an
opportunity to the sunniest countries of the
world comparable to that which offshore wind
farms are currently offering to European and
other nations with the windiest shorelines.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 6

Solar thermal power uses direct sunlight, so it must be sited in
regions with high direct solar radiation. Suitable sites should
offer at least 2,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity per m2 of
sunlight annually, whilst the best sites offer more than
2,500kWh/m2. Typical locations, where the climate and
vegetation do not offer high levels of atmospheric humidity,
include steppes, bush, savannah’s, semi-deserts and true
deserts, ideally located within ±40 degrees of latitude. Among
the most promising areas of the world are therefore the
South-Western United States, Central and South America,
Africa, the Middle East, the Mediterranean countries of
Europe, Iran, Pakistan and the desert regions of India,
the former Soviet Union, China and Australia.

In many regions of the world, one square kilometre of land is
enough to generate as much as 100-200 Gigawatt hours
(GWh) of solar electricity per year using solar thermal
technology. This is equivalent to the annual production of a
50 MW conventional coal or gas-fired power plant. Over the
total life cycle of a solar thermal power system, its output
would be equivalent to the energy contained in 16 million
barrels of oil. Worldwide, the exploitation of less than
1% of the total solar thermal potential would be enough
to meet the recommendations of the United Nations’
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for
the long-term stabilisation of the climate.

This large solar power potential will only be used to a limited
extent, however, if it is restricted by regional demand and by
local technological and financial resources. If solar electricity is
exported to regions with a high demand for power but few
indigenous solar resources, considerably more of the potential
in the sunbelt countries could be harvested for the protection
of the global climate. Countries such as Germany are already
seriously considering the import of solar electricity from North
Africa and Southern Europe as a way of contributing to the
long-term sustainable development of their power sector.
However, priority should still be given to supply for legitimate
indigenous demand.

2. Turning Solar Heat into Electricity
Producing electricity from the energy in the sun’s rays is a
relatively straightforward process. Direct solar radiation can be
concentrated and collected by a range of Concentrating Solar
Power (CSP) technologies to provide medium to high
temperature heat. This heat is then used to operate a
conventional power cycle, for example through a steam or gas
turbine or a Stirling engine. Solar heat collected during the day
can also be stored in liquid, solid or phase changing media
like molten salts, ceramics, concrete, or in the future, phase
changing salt mixtures. At night, it can be extracted from the
storage medium to run power generation plant.
Solar thermal power plants can be designed for solar-only
generation, ideally to satisfy day-time peak load demand, but
with future storage systems operation can be extended until

base load coverage. During the technology’s market
development phase, hybrid plant concepts which back up the
solar output by fossil firing are likely to be the favoured option.
This would involve, for example, Integrated Solar-Combined
Cycle (ISCC) plants for mid-load or base-load operation.

Combined generation of heat and power by CSP has
particularly promising potential, as the high value solar
energy input is used to the best possible efficiency,
exceeding 85%. Process heat from combined generation
can be used for industrial applications, district cooling or
sea water desalination.

Current CSP technologies include parabolic trough power
plants, solar power towers and parabolic dish engines (see
Part Two). Parabolic trough plants with an installed capacity of
354 MW have been in commercial operation for many years,
whilst solar towers and dish engines have been tested
successfully in a series of demonstration projects.

3. Why Concentrate Solar Power?
Concentrating solar power to generate bulk electricity is one
of the best suited technologies to help mitigate climate
change in an affordable way, as well as reducing the
consumption of fossil fuels.

Environmental Sustainability
Life cycle assessment of the emissions produced, together
with the land surface impacts of CSP systems, shows that
they are ideally suited to the task of reducing greenhouse
gases and other pollutants, and without creating other
environmental risks or contamination. Each square metre of
CSP solar field surface, for example, is enough to avoid the
annual emisson of 200 kilograms (kg) of carbon dioxide. The
energy payback time of concentrating solar power systems is
in the order of just five months. This compares very favourably
with their lifespan of approximately 25 to 30 years. Most of the
CSP solar field materials e.g. steel and glass can be recycled
and used again for further plants.

Economic Sustainability
The cost of solar thermal power is falling. Experience from
the Solar Electric Generating Systems (SEGS) in California
(see Part Two) shows that impressive cost reductions have
already been achieved, with generation costs ranging today
between 10 and 13 US cents/kWh. However, most of the
learning curve is still to come.

Advanced technologies, mass production, economies of scale
and improved operation will together enable a reduction in the
cost of solar electricity to a level competitive with other power
sources within the next 10 to 15 years. This will reduce
dependency on fossil fuels and avoid the risk of future
electricity cost escalation. Hybrid solar-fossil fuel plants,
making use of special finance schemes at favourable sites,
can already deliver competitively priced electricity.

Competition with the economics of solar thermal power plants
comes mainly from conventional grid-connected fossil fuel-fired
power plants, particularly the modern natural gas-fired combined
cycle plants in mid-load or base-load operation mode. In
small-scale off-grid generation systems, such as islands or
developing countries, the competition comes from gas oil or
heavy fuel oil-powered diesel engine generators. However, a
mixture of factors, including reform of the electricity sector, the
rising demand for ‘green power’, the possibility of gaining carbon
credits from pollution-free generation and direct support
schemes for renewable energy in some countries, are all
increasing the viability of such projects.

4. A Brief History
Efforts to design devices for supplying renewable energy
through use of the sun’s rays began some 100 years before
the oil price crisis of the 1970s triggered the modern
development of renewables. Experiments started in the 1860s,
with Auguste Mouchout’s first solar-powered motor producing
steam in a glass-enclosed iron cauldron, then continued in the
early 1900s with Aubrey Eneas’ first commercial solar motors.
In 1907 a patent was granted to Dr. Maier from Aalen and Mr.
Remshardt from Stuttgart for a device to directly use solar
irradiation for steam generation. This was based on the solar
parabolic trough technology. In 1912 Frank Shuman used this
technology to build a 45kW sun-tracking parabolic trough
plant in Meadi, Egypt.

These early designs formed the basis for R&D developments
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when solar thermal
projects were undertaken in a number of industrialised
countries, including the United States, Russia, Japan, Spain
and Italy (see Table 1). Many of these plants, covering the
whole spectrum of available technology, failed to reach the
expected performance levels, and subsequent R& D has
continued to concentrate on technology improvement and
increasing the size of units.

A major breakthrough came in the early 1980s when the
American-Israeli company Luz International commercialised
the technology by building a series of nine Solar Electric
Generating Stations in the Californian Mojave desert. The
SEGS plants range from 14 up to 80 MWe in capacity and
accumulates 354 MW capacity for the Southern
Californian grid.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER:
TECHNOLOGY, COSTS
AND BENEFITS

1. Technology Overview
Solar thermal power plants produce electricity
in much the same way as conventional power
stations. The difference is that they obtain
their energy input by concentrating solar
radiation and converting it to high temperature
steam or gas to drive a turbine or engine. Four
main elements are required: a concentrator, a
receiver, some form of heat transport media
or storage, and power conversion. Many
different types of systems are possible,
including combinations with other renewable
and non-renewable technologies, but the
three most promising solar thermal
technologies are:

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 9

Figure 1: Parabolic Trough
Parabolic trough-shaped mirror reflectors are used to
concentrate sunlight on to thermally efficient receiver tubes
placed in the trough focal line. In these tubes a thermal transfer
fluid is circulated, such as synthetic thermal oil. Heated to
approximately 400°C by the concentrated sun’s rays, this oil is
then pumped through a series of heat exchangers to produce
superheated steam. The steam is converted to electrical energy
in a conventional steam turbine generator, which can either be
part of a conventional steam cycle or integrated into a combined
steam and gas turbine cycle.

Absorber tube

Figure 2: Central Receiver/Solar Tower
A circular array of heliostats (large individually-tracking mirrors)
is used to concentrate sunlight on to a central receiver
mounted at the top of a tower. A heat transfer medium in this
central receiver absorbs the highly concentrated radiation
reflected by the heliostats and converts it into thermal energy
to be used for the subsequent generation of superheated
steam for turbine operation. Heat transfer media so far
demonstrated include water/steam, molten salts, liquid
sodium and air. If a gas or even air is pressurised in the
receiver, it can be used alternatively to drive a gas turbine
(instead of producing steam for a steam turbine).

Figure 3: Parabolic Dish
A parabolic dish-shaped reflector is used to concentrate
sunlight on to a receiver located at the focal point of the dish.
This absorbs energy reflected by the concentrators, enabling
fluid in the receiver to be heated to approximately 750°C. This
is then used to generate electricity in a small engine, for
instance Stirling engine or a micro turbine, attached to
the receiver.

Each technology has its own characteristics, advantages and
disadvantages, some of which are shown in Table 2.

What promises to be the next generation of parabolic
collector technology has been developed at the Plataforma
Solar in Spain since 1998 by a European consortium.
Known as EuroTrough, this aims to achieve better
performance and lower costs by using the same well
tried key components – parabolic mirrors and absorber
tubes – as in the commercially mature Californian plants,
but significantly enhancing the optical accuracy by a
completely new design of the trough structure. With funding
from the European Union, a 100m and a 150m prototype
of the EuroTrough were successfully commissioned in
2000 and 2002 respectively at the Plataforma Solar
Research Centre.

Technology Developments
Parabolic trough systems represent the most mature solar
thermal power technology, with 354 MW connected to the
Southern California grid since the 1980s and over 2 million
square meters of parabolic trough collectors operating with a
long term availability of over 99%. Supplying an annual 800
million kWh at a generation cost of about 10 to 12 US
cents/kWh, these plants have demonstrated a maximum
summer peak efficiency of 21% in terms of conversion of
direct solar radiation into grid electricity (see box “The
California SEGS Power Plants” on page 14).

But although successful, they by no means represent the end
of the learning curve. Advanced structural design will improve
optical accuracy and at the same time reduce weight and
costs. By increasing the length of the collector units, end
losses can be further reduced and savings in drive systems
and connection piping achieved. Next generation receiver
tubes will also further reduce thermal losses and at the same
time increase reliability. Improvements to the heat transfer
medium will increase operating temperature and performance.
Low cost thermal bulk storage will increase annual operating
hours and thereby reduce generation costs. Most important
for further significant cost reductions, however, is automated
mass production in order to steadily increase market
implementation. New structural collector designs are

An extended 4,360m2 loop of advanced EuroTrough collectors
with both 100m and 150m units is now fully commercially
operational, as part of the the so-called PARASOL project, at
the SEGS V plant in Kramer Junction, California in April 2003.
Developed by Solar Millenium AG, Germany this has received
financial support from the German Ministry for Environment.
Other new designs for parabolic troughs are under
development in the US and in Belgium.

While the commercial plants in California use a synthetic oil as
the heat transfer fluid, because of its low operating pressure
and storability, R&D efforts are under way at the Plataforma
Solar – through the DISS (Direct Solar Steam) and INDITEP
projects sponsored by the European Commission – to achieve
direct steam generation within absorber tubes and to eliminate
the need for an intermediate heat transfer. This increases
efficiency and could reduce costs by as much as 30%. In the
first DISS pilot plant, direct solar steam has been generated at
100bar and 375°C. Following this success, the current R&D
effort from the INDITEP project is focused on increasing the
steam temperature beyond 400°C. The issue of a feasible
phase change storage medium for direct steam systems will
be the future focus of R&D activities.

Another potential technology under investigation is a parabolic
line focusing concept with segmented mirrors, employing the
Fresnel principle (see below). Although this will reduce
efficiency, the developers expect a considerable potential for
cost reduction, since the closer arrangement of the mirrors
requires less land and provides a partially shaded, useful
space underneath.

An alternative to mechanical trackers is being developed in
Australia, known as Yeoman’s Floating Solar Concentrators.
These are designed as a low-tech, low-cost solution and use
5m2 concrete flotation modules and strips of low-iron glass
mirrors set in the top surface in a Fresnel structured parabolic
trough. To protect them from impact damage a simple high-flow
irrigation pump can flood the top surface of the modules in
minutes, sinking them in half a metre of water. Steam can be
produced at high temperatures and pressures at 60% efficiency.
Final efficiency will depend on turbine operation and other
factors. Full scale ponds are planned to be 110 meters in
diameter and contain 340 individual modules. They would
have an estimated peak output of 1.5 MW, and an estimated
capital cost of AU$ 1 million/MW.

Fresnel Principle Solar Collectors
A Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) array is a line focus system similar to parabolic troughs in which solar radiation is concentrated
on an elevated inverted linear absorber using an array of nearly flat reflectors. With the advantages of low structural support
costs, fixed fluid joints, a receiver separated from the reflector system, and long focal lengths allowing the use of conventional
glass, LFR collectors have attracted increasing attention. The technology is seen to be a lower cost alternative to trough
technology for the production of solar steam for power generation.

An LFR can be designed to have similar thermal performance to that of a parabolic trough per aperture area, but recent designs
tend to use less expensive reflector materials and absorber components which reduce optical performance. However, this lower
performance is outweighed by lower investment and operation and maintenance costs. Fresnel collectors also have other
advantages, such as allowing use of the land below the mirror fields for other economic purposes, such as horticulture.

In 1999 the Belgian Company Solarmundo erected the largest prototype of a Fresnel collector, with a collector width of 24 m
and a reflector area of 2500 m2. The next step should be a pilot plant to demonstrate the technology in a large scale system
under commercial operational conditions. Most convenient and cost-effective would be a plug-in solution of a Fresnel collector
connected to an existing power plant. The Australian company Solar Heat and Power is planning a 24,000 m2 pilot CLFR array
for attachment to a coal-fired station in late 2003.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 13

To date, as a result of the regulatory framework prevailing in
California during implementation of the SEGS plants (see
below), all existing commercial parabolic trough plants use a
steam cycle, with a back-up natural gas-fired capability to
supplement the solar output during periods of low radiation,
up to an annual maximum of 25% of primary thermal heat
input. From SEGS-II onwards, however, the SEGS plants can
be operated in solar only mode. Parabolic trough plants can
be built in unit sizes up to 200 MW.

Current Projects
Due to its commercial maturity, parabolic trough technology is
the preferred choice of industrial bidders and investors in
proposed utility scale projects in Europe and the South-western
United States (although only pure solar operation is eligible
under the renewable electricity incentive programmes of
Spain, Greece and Italy), while in the proposed Integrated
Solar Combined Cycle Systems being sponsored by the
Global Environment Facility in India, Mexico, Morocco and
Egypt. The following utility scale parabolic trough projects are
currently being planned:

Spain
Following introduction of a solar thermal incentive premium of
12€cents/kWh in Spain in September 2002, Solar Millennium

AG completed land acquisition and planning for the first two 50
MW AndaSol plants in Andalusia. With 510,120 m2 of solar field
and 6 hours of storage capacity, each plant will feed an annual
157 GWh of solar electricity into the Spanish grid and have an
annual efficiency of 14.7%. The EPC-specification documents
for the power block have been prepared by Fichtner Solar
GmbH. Detailed engineering and permitting documents are
being prepared by the German company Flagsol GmbH. The
AndaSol-1 project has been granted €5 million financial support
from the 5th Framework Programme of the European Union. At
the same time, the Spanish EHN group and Duke Solar (now
Solargenix Energy) are pursuing a 15 MW parabolic trough
project in the region of Navarra.

Egypt
The Egyptian New and Renewable Energy Agency published a
Request for Pre-qualification Statements in March 2000 for a
120 – 140 MW Integrated Solar Combined Cycle System to be
built near Kuraymat, 100km south of Cairo, in which the choice
of solar technology was left to the bidders. Eighteen of the 20
responding consortia offered parabolic trough technology.
In August 2003 the NREA changed the approach to
implementation by an EPC cum O&M consortium and
assigned Fichtner Solar GmbH with the preparation of the
conceptual design and the request for Proposal (RfP).

The California SEGS Power Plants
Constructed over the period 1984-91, and ranging in size from 14 MWe up to 80 MWe, the nine separate parabolic trough
systems in the Californian Mojave desert (with a total capacity of 354 MWe) are known collectively as the Solar Electricity
Generating Systems (SEGS). For power generation they use a highly efficient steam turbine fed with steam from the solar field.
The gas-fired back-up burners are used to maintain the temperature of the heat transfer fluid in hours of insufficient sunshine.
However, the power purchase conditions restrict gas use to an annual maximum of 25% of the total heat input. With more than
two million square meters of glass mirrors the plants have generated over 10 billion kWh of solar electricity since 1985.

The five 30HWe raised to build these plants came from private risk capital and, with increasing confidence in the maturity of the
technology, from institutional investors. Although backed originally by tax incentives and attractive power purchase contracts,
these have since been withdrawn, whilst a fall in fuel prices in the late 1980s led to a 40% reduction in electricity sales revenue.
Nonetheless, significant cost reductions were achieved over the construction period through increased size, performance and
efficiency. All nine SEGS plants are still in profitable commercial operation.

The 30 MWe SEGS plants at Kramer Junction, with an annual insolation of over 2,700 kWh/m2, have generating costs of 15 US
cents/kWh during high-priced daytime slots (mainly for peak load air conditioning), including an allowance to generate up to
25% of the annual output by supplementary natural gas firing. The equivalent pure solar costs would be 20 US cents/ kWh. The
80 MWe SEGS plants at Harper Lake, with the same annual insolation, have generating costs of 12 US cents/kWh. The
equivalent pure solar costs would be 16 US cents/ kWh).

In terms of efficiency, the SEGS plants have achieved daily solar-to-electric efficiencies close to 20%, and peak efficiencies up
to 21.5%. The annual plant availability has exceeded 98% and the collector field availability more than 99%. The five plants at
Kramer Junction have achieved a 30% reduction in operation and maintenance costs between 1995 and 2000.

The improvements gained in the performance of the Kramer Junction SEGS plants have been the result of successful
adaptations to the design of the solar collectors, absorber tubes and system integration by a number of companies. Ongoing
development work continues in Europe and the US to further reduce costs in a number of areas, including improvements in the
collector field, receiver tubes, mirrors and thermal storage.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 14

Solar Costs
“For the current state of technology and at very good sites a solar kWh can be generated for about 15 US cents/kWh. This
generation cost will be reduced when more projects will be implemented. The CSP industry anticipates reducing solar power
generation costs by 20%, once 400 MWe of new solar capacity has been implemented. Upon reaching 5,000 MWe of new solar
capacity, solar electricity generation cost will be fully competitive with fossil-based grid-connected power generation costs.”

Declaration of Berlin, June 2002

Mexico
Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Electricidad issued a Request
for Proposals in March 2002 for a 198 – 242 MW gas-fired
combined cycle plant with an optional integrated parabolic
trough solar field of at least 25 MW electrical output under
design conditions. The additional solar costs will be covered
by a grant from the Global Environment Facility.

India
Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation published a
Request for Proposals in June 2002 for a combined cycle
system of about 140 MW incorporating a parabolic trough
solar thermal field with a collection area of 220,000 m2 to
support a 35 to 40 MWe solar thermal plant. The additional
solar costs will be covered by soft loans from the German KfW
bank and grants from India, Rajasthan and the Global
Environment Facility. Fichtner Solar GmbH has prepared the
initial feasibility study, the conceptual design as well as the
Request for Proposal for an EPC cum O&M contract.

The collector size should be changed to: 220 000 m2.

Morocco
A grant of US$ 50 million from the Global Environment Facility
has been offered to Morocco for a 230 MW ISCC project with
30-50 MW equivalent solar capacity. Fichtner Solar GmbH is
now preparing for the national electricity utility ONE the
Request for Proposals, with the choice of technology being
left to the bidding investors.

Iran
The government of Iran is interested in the implementation of
a 200,000-400,000 m2 parabolic trough field in a 300 MW
natural gas-fired combined cycle plant in the Luth desert in
the area of Yazd. A detailed feasibility study had been
prepared jointly by Fichtner Solar GmbH and Flagsol (formally
Pilkington Solar International GmbH).

Israel
The Israeli Ministry of National Infrastructure, which is also
responsible for the energy sector, decided in November 2001
to introduce concentrating solar power as a strategic
ingredient in the Israel electricity market from 2005, with an
initial parabolic trough plant of 100 MWe. The Israeli company
Solel is currently preparing the engineering side of this project.

Italy
In 2001, the Italian parliament allocated €110 million for a CSP
development and demonstration programme. Since then, several
parabolic trough plants have started development.

United States
Sierra Pacific Resources announced in January 2003 that its
two Nevada-based utility subsidiaries had signed long-term
contracts with Solargenix Energy (formerly Duke Solar Energy)
to supply 50 MW of electricity generated by solar power using
parabolic troughs from a plant to be located in Eldorado
Valley, near Boulder City, Nevada.

Algeria
This is the most recent country to have announced interest in
implementing an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle System
with parabolic trough technology.

Australia
A 35 MWe CLFR-based array will be used for pre-heating
steam at the large coal-fired 2,000 MW Liddell power
station in Hunter Valley, New South Wales. Rather than being
a coal replacement technology, this system increases the
electrical output for a given coal input. The use of existing
infrastructure reduces costs compared to a stand-alone plant.
Promoters Solar Heat and Power expect construction to
start during 2003.

Cost Trends
The installed capital costs of the Californian SEGS
Rankine-cycle trough systems with on-peak power operation
fell from US$ 4,000/kWe to under US$ 3,000/kWe between
1984 and 1991, mainly due to the increase in size from 30 to
80 MWe units and series experience.

The investment cost of parabolic trough fields has dropped to
€210/m2 for enhanced collectors like the SKALET Euro Trough
design with large solar fields and to €130-110/m2 for high
production runs in the long term. A 15% reduction in
US/European price levels can be expected in developing
countries due to lower labour costs.

According to a World Bank assessment of the US/European
solar thermal power plant market (“Cost Reduction Study for
Solar Thermal Power Plants”, Final Report, May 1999), the
installed capital costs of near-term trough plants are expected
to be in the range of €3,500-2,440/kWe for 30-200 MWe
Rankine-cycle (SEGS type) plants and about €1,080/kWe for
130 MWe hybrid ISCC plants with 30 MWe equivalent solar
capacity. The projected total plant electricity costs range from
10 to 7 €cents/kWh for SEGS type plants and less than 7
€cents/kWh for ISCC plants.

The expected further fall in the installed capital costs of
grid-connected ISCC trough plants should result in electricity
costs of 6 €cents/kWh in the medium term and 5 €cents/kWh
in the long term. The promising long term potential is that
Rankine-cycle trough plants can compete with conventional
peaking Rankine-cycle plants (coal or oil-fired) at good solar
sites. The cost reduction potential of direct steam generation
trough technology is even greater in the longer term. In
Australia, the CLFR total plant electricity costs have been
estimated to be about AU$ 0.045/kWh when used in
conjunction with coal fired plant, and AU$ 0.07/kWh to
AU$ 0.09/kWh as a stand-alone solar thermal plant.

Table 3 shows how substantial cost reductions could be
achieved over the next five to ten years, especially for
plants with the largest solar fields. Similarly, the analysis
shows that projects could be built cheaper outside the
developed world. In a pre-feasibility study for a plant in
Brazil, for example, it was estimated that the construction
cost of a 100 MW Rankine-cycle plant would be US$
2,660/kW, 19% lower than in the US, with savings in labour,
materials and to some extent equipment. A number of
companies interested in building GEF projects have
indicated that using local labour and manufacturing

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 16

capabilities in India, Egypt, Morocco and Mexico will be
key to their bidding at a low cost.

A US initiative called the Parabolic Trough Technology
Roadmap, developed jointly by industry and the US
Department of Energy’s SunLab, identified a number of
potential improvements. The initiative suggests that further
cost reductions and performance increases of up to 50% are
feasible for parabolic trough technology.

3. Central Receiver/Solar Tower Systems
Technology Developments
Concentrating sunlight by up to 600 times, solar tower
technology has the potential advantage of delivering high
temperature solar heat in utility scale quantities at
temperatures from 500°C for steam cycles and beyond
1,000°C for gas turbines and combined cycles power plants.

The technical feasibility of central receiver technology was
first proved during the 1980s by the operation of six
research power plants ranging from 1 to 5 MWe capacity,
and by one demonstration plant with a water/steam receiver,
connected to the Southern California grid. Their total net
electrical capacity was 21.5 MWe, with an installed heliostat
mirror area of about 160,000 m2. Commercial solar tower
operation has still to be demonstrated, however. After an
intermediate scaling up to 30 MW systems, solar tower
developers now feel confident that grid-connected tower
power plants can be built up to a capacity of 200 MWe
solar-only units. Conceptual designs of units with more than
100 MWe have also been drawn up for ISCC plants.

For gas turbine operation, the air to be heated must first pass
through a pressurised solar receiver with a solar window.
Combined cycle power plants using this method will require

30% less collector area than equivalent steam cycles. At
present, a first prototype to demonstrate this concept is being
built as part of the European SOLGATE project, with three
receiver units coupled to a 250kW gas turbine.

Various central receiver heat transfer media have been
investigated, including water/steam, liquid sodium, molten
salt and ambient air. The 10 MWe Solar One pilot
demonstration plant operated in California from 1982 to
1988 with steam as the heat transfer medium. Rebuilt as the
10 MWe Solar Two plant, it was successfully operated from
1997 to 1999 with a molten salt-in-tube receiver system and
a two-tank molten salt storage system, accumulating
several thousand hours of operating experience and
delivering power to the grid on a regular basis.

As already explained, the molten salt storage system allows
solar energy to be collected during daylight hours and
dispatched as high value electric power at night or when
demanded by the utility. In the sunbelt regions of the US a
plant could therefore meet demand for the whole of the
summer peak periods (afternoon, due to air conditioners, and
evening). In developing countries, this storage capability could
be even more important, with peak times occurring only during
the evening.

Today, the most promising storage systems are considered
to be the European volumetric air technology and the US

molten salt-in-tube technology. The latter is now close to
being commercially viable, and a joint venture between
Ghersa (Spain) and Bechtel (US), with further subcontracting
work from Boeing (US), is hoping to build the first
commercial central receiver plant with the help of EU and
Spanish grants. This proposed 15 MWe Solar Tres plant in
Cordoba, Spain will utilise a 16 hour molten salt storage
system to run on a 24-hour basis.

The European system involves irradiating fine wire mesh or
ceramic foam structures, transferring the energy by
convection at a temperature range of 700-1,200°C. Tests
conducted in the joint German/Spanish Phoebus project
between 1993 and 1995 with a German 2.5 MWth pilot plant
demonstrated the feasibility of the volumetric air receiver
system concept with a ceramic energy storage system.
Spanish and German companies are now involved in
commercialising this technology through the Planta Solar
(PS10) 10 MWe project near Seville.

As with parabolic troughs, efforts are underway to develop
commercial central receiver plants using solar/ fossil fuel
hybrid systems, especially in the ISCC mode. One concept
undergoing demonstration in Israel involves a secondary
reflector on the tower top which directs solar energy to
ground level for collection in a high temperature air receiver
for use in a gas turbine. Coupling the output of the high
temperature solar system to a gas turbine could allow a

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 17

higher efficiency than current steam turbine applications, as
well as faster start-up times, lower installation and operating
expenses, and perhaps a smaller, more modular system.

Since heliostats represent the largest single capital
investment in a central receiver plant, efforts continue to
improve their design with better optical properties, lighter
structure and better control. Activities include the 150 m2
heliostat developed by Advanced Thermal Systems (USA),
the 170 m2 heliostat developed by Science Applications
International Corporation (USA), the 150 m2 stretched-
membrane ASM-150 heliostat from Steinmüller (Germany),
and the 100 m2 glass/metal GM-100 heliostat from Spain.
Initiatives to develop low cost manufacturing techniques for
early commercial low volume builds are also underway,
whilst prices for manufacture in a developing country could
be roughly 15% below US/European levels. As with many
solar thermal components, the price should fall significantly
with economies of scale in manufacture.

Although central receiver plants are considered to be further
from commercialisation than parabolic trough systems, solar
towers have good longer term prospects for high conversion
efficiencies. Meanwhile, more scaled-up demonstration
projects are needed.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 18

Current Projects
Spain
The first two commercial solar tower plants in the 10-15 MW
range are currently being planned within the Spanish feed-in-law
for CSP. The Spanish Abengoa group is promoting a 10 MW
solar tower with air receiver technology, known as PS-10. With a
90,000 m2 heliostat field, the PS-10 plant will feed an annual
19.2 GWh of solar electricity into the grid and will achieve a
10.5% annual net efficiency. In spite of the high receiver
temperatures, the system is handicapped by its small turbine
size. The Spanish Ghersa group, together with its US partners
Boeing and Bechtel, is planning a 15 MW molten salt system
with 16 hours of storage based on the Californian Solar Two
model. With its 240,000 m2 heliostat field the Solar Tres plant will
feed an estimated annual 80 GWh of electricity into the Spanish
grid. Both the PS-10 and Solar Tres projects have each been
granted €5 million in financial support from the 5th Framework
R&D Programme of the European Union.

South Africa
The South African national electricity utility ESKOM has
taken a strategic decision to assess the feasibility of molten
salt solar tower technology within its programme on bulk
renewable electricity, considering a possible 100 MW
demonstration plant.

Cost Trends
Installed capital costs for central receiver pilot plants are still
too high, and no electricity generation costs for commercially
scaled-up plants are yet available. Central receiver plants can
take credit, however, for their potential use with high
temperature energy storage systems. This will increase plant
performance and capacity factor, although not necessarily
reduce electricity costs.

Promoters of new near-term tower projects in Spain, such as the
10 MW PS-10 plant with 3 hours of storage, have indicated their
installed plant capital costs to be roughly €2,700/kWe, with
Rankine-cycle turbines and a small energy storage system, and
with the range of predicted total plant electricity costs from 20 to
14 €cents/kWh. The total capital cost for the 15 MW Solar Tres
plant, with 16 hours of storage, is estimated to be €84 million,
with annual operating costs of about €2 million.

For installing the heliostat field, expected costs range from
€180 to €250/m2 for small production runs in the USA, and
from €140 to €220/m2 in Europe. A 15% discount on the
US/ European price level can be projected for developing
countries due to lower labour costs. Heliostat field costs are
expected to drop below €100/m2 at high production runs in
the long term.

In the future, central receiver plant projects will benefit from
similar cost reductions to those expected from parabolic
trough plants. The expected evolution of total electricity costs,
according to the World Bank, is that they will drop to 8 to 7
€cents/kWh in the medium term (100 MWe Rankine-cycle
plant or 100 MWe ISCC, both with storage) and to 5
€cents/kWh in the long term period (200 MWe Rankine-cycle
plant with storage) for high insolation sites with an annual DNI
of more than 2,700kWh/m2.

4. Parabolic Dish Engines
Technology Status
Parabolic dish concentrators are comparatively small units
with a motor-generator at the focal point of the reflector.
Overall size typically ranges from 5 to 15 meters in diameter
and 5 to 50kW of power output. Like all concentrating
systems, they can be additionally powered by natural gas or
biogas, providing firm capacity at any time.

Due to their ideal point focusing parabolic optics and their dual
axis tracking control, dish collectors achieve the highest solar
flux concentration, and therefore the highest performance of all
concentrator types. For economic reasons, systems are currently
restricted to unit capacities of about 25kWe, but multiple dish
arrays can be used in order to accumulate the power output

upwards to the MWe range. Because of its size, the future for
dish technology lies primarily in decentralised power supply and
remote, stand-alone power systems.

Several small off-grid power systems with parabolic dish units
in the range of 5 to 50kWe have proved their technical
feasibility in experimental projects around the world since the
1970s. Dish/Stirling engine systems in particular have an
excellent potential for high conversion efficiencies because of
the high process temperatures in the engine. The record
energy yield so far has been from a 25kWe US dish/Stirling
system with a solar-to-electric peas efficiency of 30%.

Dish/engine prototypes which have successfully operated
over the last 10 years include 7 to 25kW units developed in
the United States by Advanco, the McDonnell Douglas
Corporation, the Cummins Engine Company and others,
although large scale deployment has not yet occurred. In
Spain, six units with a 9 to 10kW rating are currently
operating successfully. These were developed by the
German company Schlaich, Bergermann and Partners (SBP)
in collaboration with Mero (suppliers of the collector system)
and SOLO Kleinmotoren (Stirling engine). Three of these
dishes have been continually operated with great success
since 1992, accumulating more than 30,000 hours of
operating experience.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 20

The new EuroDish development, supported by the European
Union, will advance this technology further. At the same time,
two industrial teams working in the United States – Stirling
Energy Systems/Boeing Company and Science Applications
International Corporation/STM Corp – have installed several
second generation 25kW dish/Stirling prototypes for extended
testing and evaluation. Finally, WG Associates have
demonstrated the first unattended, remote operation of an
advanced technology 10kW dish/Stirling prototype.
Turnkey dish/Stirling systems, with the option of hybrid
operation with gas combustion, are currently under
development and expected to be available soon for initial
demonstration projects.

Current Projects
United States
In July 2002, the US Department of Energy’s Concentrating
Solar Power Program issued a request for proposals for a
project to deploy 1 MW or more of dish-engine systems at a
site in Southern Nevada. This field validation scheme is known
as the Nevada Solar Dish Power Project.

Europe
A demonstration project at the PSA in Spain involves six
German dish/Stirling pre-commercial units with 9 to 10kWe
capacity. Over 30,000 operating hours have been accumulated

by the earliest system. Promising advanced heat pipe
receivers and Stirling engines are currently under development
with the aim of reducing costs.

Australia
The first 400 m2 pilot “big dish” project with a capacity of up
to 150kWth has been undergoing testing at the Australian
National University since 1994. An alternative to the small unit
philosophy, this is designed for power generation using a
50kWe steam engine generator or for co-generation
applications with solar steam production.

Cost Trends
The cost trend for dish collectors has already shown a sharp
reduction, from €1,250/m2 in 1982 (40 m2 array, Shenandoah,
USA) to €150/m2 in 1992 (44 m2 array, German SBP
stretched-membrane dish).

Overall installed plant capital costs for a first stand-alone 9 to
10kWe dish/Stirling unit currently range from €10,000 to
€14,000/kWe. If a production run of 100 units per year was
achieved, this could fall to €7,100/kWe. In terms of electricity
costs, an attainable near-term goal is a figure of less than 15
€cents/kWh. In the medium to long term, with series
production, dish/Stirling systems are expected to see
drastically decreasing installed system costs.

The goal of the European EuroDish project is for a reduction
from €7,100/kWe, at a production rate of 100 units per year,
to €3,700/kWe (1,000 units/year) to €2,400/kWe (3,000
units/year) and eventually to €1,600/kWe (10,000 units/ year).
Prices are unlikely to fall below that level due to the inherently
highly modular technology. Medium to long-term installed dish
collector costs are predicted to be in the range of €125 to
€105/m2 for high production rates. Advanced dish/Stirling
systems are expected to compete in the medium to long term
with similar sized diesel generator units at sunny remote sites
such as islands.

A 1999 US study on the utility market potential for dish
systems concluded that costs will need to fall to between US$
2,000 and US$ 1,200/kWe in order to achieve any significant
market uptake. For initial market sectors, such as distributed
generation, reliability and O&M costs will be crucial factors.
Parabolic dish system commercialisation may well be helped
by hybrid operation, although this presents a greater challenge
with Stirling engines. Gas turbine based systems may present
a more efficient alternative.

5. Future Trends and Costs
Two broad pathways have opened up for large scale delivery
of electricity using solar thermal power. One is to combine the
solar collection and heat transfer process with a conventional

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 21

salt returns its thermal energy to the cold thermal fluid. The
thermal fluid heats up to keep producing steam for the turbine,
while the cooled salt accumulates again in the cold tank.

In terms of costs, commercial experience so far has been
exclusively from parabolic trough systems, such as the
Californian SEGS. For current trough systems with 100% solar
operation, costs are in the range of 12-15 US cents/kWh. This
could fall to about 8.5 US cents/kWh after 2006 for projects in
southern Europe or the Sahara Desert.

6. Environmental Benefits
Solar thermal power involves none of the polluting emissions
or environmental safety concerns associated with
conventional generation technologies. There is no pollution in
the form of exhaust fumes or noise during operation.
Decommissioning a system is unproblematic.

Most importantly, in terms of the wider environment, there are
no emissions during the operation of a solar thermal plant of
carbon dioxide – the main gas responsible for global climate
change (see panel “Climate Change and Fuel Choices”).
Although indirect emissions of CO2 occur at other stages of
the life-cycle (construction and decommissioning), these are
significantly lower than the avoided emissions.

Solar power can therefore make a substantial contribution
towards international commitments to reduce the steady
increase in the level of greenhouse gases and their
contribution to climate change (see panel “The Climate
Change Imperative”).

power plant. The most favoured current combination is the
Integrated Solar Combined Cycle System (ISCC).

Essentially, the ISCC system uses the CSP element as a solar
boiler to supplement the waste heat from a gas turbine in
order to augment power generation in the steam Rankine
bottoming cycle (see Figure 9). Although yet to be built,
studies have shown that efficiency would be improved and
operating costs reduced, cutting the overall cost of solar
thermal power by as much as 22% compared with a
conventional SEGS plant (25% fossil) of similar size.

These systems could still have an equivalent solar capacity of
30 to 40 MWe, and promise to be extremely attractive as a
way of introducing the technology to the market. They would
also have the advantage of allowing mid-load to base-load
operation, as opposed to the peak load use which is the
primary market of the SEGS plants.

Increasing attention is being paid, however, to entirely solar-
based systems. This is reflected, for instance, in the incentive
programmes currently available in both Spain and Nevada,
USA, for which only 100% solar operation is eligible, whilst the
UN and the World Bank-backed Global Environment Facility,
an important source of funding, is focussing on supporting
hybrid ISCC systems.

The market for 100% solar only operation will broaden still
further with the use of thermal storage as a way of storing the
sun’s heat until required for power generation. A recent study,
part of the USA Trough Initiative, evaluated several thermal
storage concepts, with the preferred design using molten salts
as the storage medium, as already chosen for the Solar Two
pilot plant in California. Such a storage system will also be
implemented in the first 50 MW AndaSol plant now being
planned in southern Spain.

Solar energy collected by the solar field during the day will be
stored in the storage system and then dispatched after sunset.
To charge the storage system, the salt is heated up to approx.
384°C, to discharge the system, it is cooled down again to
about 291°C. At both temperatures the salt is in a liquid state.
Cold and hot salt are stored in separate tanks, giving the
system its “two-tank” label. A thermal storage system with
separate cold and hot tanks has the advantage that charging
and discharging occur at constant temperatures.

Figure 10 shows a process flow diagram of the AndaSol-1
plant, with a two-tank molten salt storage system. In this
configuration, hot thermal fluid from the solar field is diverted
to a heat exchanger, where its thermal energy passes to the
salt flow arriving from the cold tank. This heats up and
accumulates in the hot tank. During the night or at times of
reduced radiation, the charging process is reversed, and salt
from the hot tank is pumped to the heat exchanger, where the

Climate Change and Fuel Choices
Carbon dioxide is responsible for more than 50% of the man-made greenhouse effect, making it the most important contributor
to climate change. It is produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels. Natural gas is the least dirty of the fossil fuels because it
produces roughly half the quantity of carbon dioxide as coal, and less of other polluting gases. Nuclear power produces very
little CO2, but has other major pollution problems associated with its operation and waste products.

The consequences of climate change already apparent today include:

• The proportion of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by about 30% since industrialisation began.
• The number of natural disasters has trebled since the 1960s. The resulting economic damage has increased by a factor of 8.5.

• The seven warmest years over the last 130 were recorded during the past 11 years.

• The mass of inland glaciers has been halved since industrialisation began.

• Rainfall and temperate in northern latitudes has increased by 5% since 1950. Average wind speed has also increased

significantly.

• Sea level has risen by 10-20 centimetres in the last 100 years, 9-12 cm of this in the last fifty.

Because of the time lapse between emissions and their effects, the full consequences of developing climate change have still to
emerge over the coming decades, bringing increased danger to the stability of the world’s ecosystems, economy and lifestyle.

To effectively stem the greenhouse effect, emissions of CO2 must therefore be greatly reduced. Scientists believe that only a
quarter of the fossil fuel reserves which can be developed commercially today ought to be allowed to be burned if ecosystems
are not to go beyond the point at which they are able to adapt.

The Climate Change Imperative
The growing threat of global climate change resulting from the build-up of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere has
forced national and international bodies into action. Starting with the agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 a series of targets has been set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and has
prompted national and regional measures for increasing the take-up of renewable energy, including solar power.

• The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, brokered by the United Nations, committed the world’s developed countries to reduce their

emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5% from their 1990 level. Most of the industrialised nations have taken up
this challenge.

• The European Union has set a target to double the proportion of energy in the 15 member states provided from renewable

sources. The aim is for 12% renewable energy by 2010. A specific target for solar thermal power plants is under discussion.

THE GLOBAL SOLAR
THERMAL MARKET

1. International Market Overview
Despite the success of the nine SEGS
operating in California, no new commercial
plants have been built since 1991. There are a
number of reasons for this, some of which led
to the collapse of the technology pioneer and
first commercial project developer, LUZ.
International, including the steady fall in
energy prices during the 1980s and a delay in
renewal of California’s solar tax credits.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 24

Progress on developing the market has been further hampered
by the worldwide liberalisation of the electricity sector. This
has significantly affected the viability of large, capital intensive
generating plants. Lack of either firm market prices or
long-term power purchase agreements has increased
uncertainty and shortened the depreciation times for capital
investments. The result has been a shift towards low capital
cost plant like gas fired combined cycles, with quick build
times, installed costs falling to below $ 500/kW and generation
efficiencies of over 50%. In this climate, solar thermal plant
will need to scale up to larger unit capacities in order to
compete successfully for the generation of bulk electricity.

Against this trend has been the growing pressure from
international agreements, often translated into national
targets and support mechanisms, for the accelerated
development of power systems which do not pollute the
environment and produce little or no carbon dioxide
emissions. But although ‘green power markets’ have been
advancing in both Europe and North America, with premiums
paid by customers or state funds for electricity generated
from renewable sources, solar thermal has generally not
been included in the list of qualifying technologies.

Even so, new opportunities are opening up as a result of the
global search for clean energy solutions. Some of the main
sponsors of energy investments in the developing world,
including the UN and the World Bank’s Global Environment
Facility (GEF), the German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW)
and the European Investment Bank (EIB), have recently been
convinced of the environmental promise and economic
prospects for solar thermal. Funding has also been made
available for demonstration and commercialisation projects
through the European Union’s 5th Framework Programme, with
particular interest in the sunbelt northern Mediterranean region.
Projects are already planned in Spain, Italy and Greece.

Other national initiatives will significantly advance solar
thermal development. Spain, for example, as part of its CO2
emissions limitation target, intends to install 200 MWe of
capacity by 2010. Supported by the Spanish national pricing
mechanism (see below), this could generate an annual power
production of 628 GWh. Similarly, the Italian government’s
ENEA energy/environment agency has produced a strategic
plan for mass development of solar energy. This recommends
bringing thermal-electric solar technology to the market within
three years. Commercial ventures would be encouraged
through financial incentives to show the advantages of large
scale schemes and reduce costs to competitive levels.

Bulk power transmission from high insolation sites (up to
2,750kWh/m2) in southern Mediterranean countries, including
Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, may also offer
opportunities for European utilities to finance solar plants for
electricity consumption in Europe.

In the United States, the Solar Energy Industry Association
(SEIA) and the Department of Energy have helped create Solar
Enterprise Zones in sunbelt states. These zones are aimed at
assisting private companies to develop large scale solar
electric projects of 1,000 MWe over a seven year period.
Projects in Nevada (50 MW) and Arizona (10-30 MWe) are in
the planning stage and will benefit both from Renewable
Portfolio Standards, which require a certain percentage of
electricity supply to come from renewable sources, and green
pricing. Interest from the Australian government has resulted
in Renewable Energy Showcase Grants being provided for two
projects being integrated with existing coal-fired plants.

How Spain Supports Solar Thermal Power
Law 54/1997, which introduced competition into the Spanish electricity sector, also made this principle compatible with the
achievement of other objectives such as improving energy efficiency, reducing consumption and protecting the environment, all
vital to meet Spanish commitments to reduce greenhouse gases. The Spanish Royal Decree 2818 of 1998 followed this by
establishing a special legal framework which allowed for favourable treatment towards energy systems which contributed most
efficiently to those objectives. This decree established specific premiums for the electricity generated from different renewable
sources, all of them (with the exception of solar PV) of up to 90% of the average electricity price.

In 2000 a further national law allowed for an incentive premium payment to exceed 90% of the average electricity price to be
paid for the output from solar thermal installations. The premium for solar thermal plants is currently set at 12 €cents/kWh. This
and parallel incentives for other renewable energy sources have been established in order to enable them to contribute to a
target for a minimum of 12% of Spanish energy demand to be supplied by renewables in the year 2010.

In the “Plan for Promotion of Renewable Energies in Spain”, approved by the Council of Ministers in December 1999, the
installation of 200 MW of solar thermal plants is planned by 2010.

In other countries with a large solar thermal potential,
especially in the Middle East, Southern Africa and South
America, interest is being shown by both governments and
national utilities. The attraction comes both from the
availability of post-Kyoto clean energy funding and, for
countries with oil-based electricity production, the desire to
exploit indigenous renewable resources. Apart from the four
countries which have received GEF grants (see Table 5), a
number of technology assessments and feasibility studies
have been carried out in Brazil, South Africa, Namibia, Jordan,
Malta and Iran. Many of these countries are currently
undergoing electricity sector reform, in the process
encouraging independent power producers, seen as the most
appropriate vehicle for solar thermal projects.

These factors have led to recent but significant interest in
constructing plants in the sunbelt regions from private sector
turnkey suppliers. In addition, interest rates and capital costs
have drastically fallen worldwide, increasing the viability of
capital intensive renewable projects.

Overall, it is clear that parabolic trough plants are the most
economic and most mature solar thermal technology available
today, although there are still significant areas for improvement
and cost cutting. Central receivers, with low cost and efficient
thermal storage, promise to offer dispatchable, high capacity
factor solar-only plants in the near future, and are very close to
commercialisation. Whilst the modular nature of parabolic dish
systems will allow them to be used in smaller high value and
off-grid remote applications for deployment in the medium to
long term, further development and field testing is still
needed, but with significant potential for cost cutting through
mass production.

Upscaling of the size of projects will also produce economies
of scale. Studies have shown that doubling the size of a plant
reduces the capital cost by approximately 12-14%, both
through increased manufacturing volume and reduced O& M
costs. A number of projects are now in various stages of
development (see Table 4) which, if successful, will give
valuable learning experience and a clear indication of the
potential for cost reduction in the next generation.

2. Market Breakthrough: The Race
to be First
India
After many years of planning, a 140 MW ISCC plant using
parabolic trough collectors is now scheduled to be constructed
at Mathania village near Jodhpur in Rajasthan, north-west India.
Funding has come from a mixture of development agency (GEF
and KfW) and state finance. Unlike other GEF supported
projects, which are IPPs, the plant is being commissioned by
the Rajasthan State Power Corporation.

The technical feasibility of a 35 MW demonstration project
was first established in the early 1990s by German
engineering consultants Fichtner, with assistance from the
KfW. Following a full feasibility study completed in 1995 by
Engineers India Ltd, EIL and Fichtner came up with the
option of integrating the solar thermal unit with a fossil fuel
based combined cycle power plant with a total capacity of
140 MW. The cost was estimated at US$ 200 million.

Eventually, an agreement was reached between the World
Bank/GEF and the German KfW development bank to co-fund
the project. The GEF commitment is US$ 49 million, KfW’s a
US$ 150 million loan, whilst the Indian government will
contribute about $10 million.

Morocco
This project has been developing rapidly following a four year
pre-feasibility study by Pilkington Solar International. Funded
by the EU, this provided an economic analysis of 11 designs
at different sites.

The eventual design involves the construction and operation
of a solar/fossil fuel hybrid station of around 230 MW, with the
site expected to be Ain Beni Mathar, in the north-eastern
Jerada province. A parabolic trough collector field will be
integrated with a natural gas-fired combined cycle plant, and
sited close to the new gas pipeline from Algeria to Spain.

The Moroccan state utility Office National de l’Electricite has
assigned Fichtner Solar to conduct the bidding, and
negotiations of the power purchase, fuel supply and
implementation agreements with the selected Independent
Power Producer (IPP). The IPP will be secured through either a
Build Own Operate Transfer (BOOT) or Build Own Operate
(BOO) contract, with the final design and choice of technology
left relatively open. For a BOOT contract, takeover costs for
the whole power plant are required, for a BOO contract a fixed
tariff is needed for a number of years. The exact configuration
and size will be chosen by the project sponsors after
competitive bidding. This should help to ensure that the
resulting design is more likely to be replicated by the private
sector in the future.

Egypt
The Egyptian government has endorsed the National
Renewable Energy Authority’s long-term solar thermal
programme, with planning underway for two subsequent
300 MW hybrid solar/fossil plants following from an initial
137 MW plant (see Table 5). These are expected to be on
line in 2007 and 2009. Key to the success of these projects
so far has been the firm commitment of NREA and the
support of the Egyptian Electrical Authority (EEA) and
Ministry of Energy. NREA has successfully conducted a
series of studies investigating the national solar thermal
potential, technology capacity and industrial resources, and
their implications for the national energy plan, as well as the
support of international development agencies. In August
2003 the NREA changed the approach for the Kuraymat
Solar Hybrid Power Plant to implementation by an EPC cum
O&M consortium and has assigned Fichtner Solar GmbH
with the preparation of the conceptual design and the
Request for Proposal (RfP).

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 28

Mexico
A solar thermal project is being considered as part of an
expansion plan proposed by the national Comisión Federal
de Electricidad. This would involve construction of up to 500
MW of hybrid solar/combined cycle gas turbines spread
across two sites, either Laguna or Hermosillio during 2004,
followed by Cerro Prieto in 2005.

Spencer Management Associates, working on behalf of the
World Bank and CFE, have since conducted a study on the
economic viability and technical feasibility of integrating a solar
parabolic trough with a Combined Cycle Plant at the Cerro
Prieto, Baja California Norte site owned by CFE. This has
resulted in approval of GEF part funding for the scheme. The
project has been delayed, however, both by restructuring of the
power sector in Mexico and changes in the national government,
putting political support for the project at risk.

In March 2002, however, CFE issued a Request for Proposals (RFP)
for a 198 – 242 MW gas-fired combined cycle with an optional
integrated parabolic trough solar field of at least 25 MW electrical
output under design conditions. The additional solar costs are
covered by a grant from the Global Environment Facility.

One advantage of this project is that Mexico has a well
developed industrial base and skilled labour force with the
potential to manufacture domestically most of the plant’s
equipment and components. This would lower the total cost
and possibly develop an industry supplying solar thermal
components for other plants around the world. Mexican
companies have already been manufacturing parabolic
collectors for US installations and have demonstrated their
ability to meet international quality standards.

Spain
In September 2002, Spain was the first European country to
introduce a “feed-in tariff” funding system for solar thermal
power. This means that the generation output from solar
thermal plants is guaranteed a premium payment of 12 €
cents/kWh on top of the electricity pool price which oscillated
between 2-8 cents per kilowatt hour. The official target is to
connect 200 MW of solar thermal power to the grid by 2010.

On this basis, several solar thermal project developments have
been proposed in Spain, the most prominent being:

• 10 MWe solar-only power tower plant project Planta Solar
(PS-10) at Sanlúcar near Sevilla promoted by Solucar S.A.,
part of the Abengoa Group. The PS-10 project has received
a €5 million grant from the 5th Framework Programme of
the European Union. All permits had been received by late
2002 and negotiations started with the financing banks.

• 15 MWe solar-only power tower plant Solar Tres project in

the province of Cordoba promoted by the Spanish company
Ghersa and Bechtel/Boeing employing US molten-salt
technologies for receiver and energy storage. Together with
Ghersa, Nexant and Boeing have formed a company called
Solar Tres to finance and build a fully commercial 15 MWe
solar power tower plant that can deliver this power around

grant from the EU’s 5th Framework Programme.

• 15 MWe solar trough power plant EuroSEGS at Montes de

Cierzo near Pamplona promoted by the Spanish EHN group
in cooperation with SOLARGENIX (former Duke solar), USA.

• Two 50 MWe solar trough power plants, AndaSol-1 and 2,
are being promoted by the Millennium Solar AG group and
its industrial partners in the region of Andalucia with a
510,120 m2 SKALET solar collector field and six hours
thermal storage. The AndaSol-1 project has received a €5
million grant from the EU’s 5th Framework Programme and
financial support from the German Ministry for
Environment. All permitting documents had been
submitted by the end of 2002.

Table 6 shows the Spanish government’s plans (by region)
for solar thermal power development, together with current
plans from private companies. The third column shows a
very conservative Greenpeace scenario where all proposed
private projects succeed (and thus surpass the official
targets for those regions) and the remaining regional
governments stick to their respective targets; a new
target is added for the Balearic Islands. This Greenpeace
scenario can be met, provided there is political will both
to support private initiatives and to meet public targets.
In fact, Greenpeace considers that a more ambitious target
of 1,000 MW by 2010 is feasible and necessary, and
thus the modest existing target should be raised, leading
to a new more active policy of legislative, economic
and fiscal measures in support of solar thermal power.

Jordan
Jordan has a long-standing interest in large-scale solar
thermal power generation. Nearly ten years ago a
European-based industrial consortium known as Phoebus
proposed the construction of a 30 MW volumetric-type solar
power tower. The consortium carried out site and feasibility
studies, collected weather data and identified financing.
Further project development, however, was delayed by
the onset of the Gulf war. In 1997 a START (Solar Thermal
Analysis, Review and Training) team composed of
IEA/SolarPACES representatives from Egypt, Germany, Israel,
Spain, Switzerland and the US, with guest observers from the
European Union, also visited Jordan, with the mission hosted
by the Jordanian National Electric Power Company.

In 2001, a request for solar plant proposals was published
by the government. Solar Millennium AG (Germany)
submitted a proposal to build a solar hybrid plant in the
Quwairah area of southern Jordan (35km north of Aqaba) to
generate 100-150 MW of electricity and to be implemented
on a Build, Own and Operate (BOO) basis. The solar
element will be backed up by gas or heavy fuel generation.
The project will create at least 100 jobs in Quwairah, and
will be linked to the national electricity grid. The Jordan
government now intends to conduct a detailed feasibility
study and seeks for financial sources.

South Africa
By 2007, South African power utility Eskom could be
operating the world’s largest CSP plant. Eskom is currently
in the final stages of a feasibility assessment of the molten
salt central receiver technology The study included the
possibility of manufacturing key components locally.
Ultimately, a decision will be made on a variety of factors,
including cost, and which plant can be constructed with the
largest local content.

United States
Several paths towards CSP market development have gained
momentum over the last year, all focused on projects in the
US South-west states, and encouraged by both the excellent
direct beam solar resource and growing demand for power.

In 2002, the US Congress asked the Department of Energy
(DOE) to develop and scope out an initiative to fulfil the goal
of having 1,000 MW of new parabolic trough, power tower
and dish/engine solar capacity supplying the south-western
United States by 2006. The US CSP industry and SunLab
collaborated on development of this report.

Iran
With a rapidly expanding population, an urgent need to increase
the production of electricity, and concern about the build-up of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the Islamic Republic of
Iran has shown a growing interest in renewable energy
technology, including solar power. Keen to exploit its abundant
solar resource, specifically by means of CSP technology, the
government also wants to diversify its power production away
from the country’s oil and natural gas reserves.

In 1997, the Iranian Power Development Company contracted
the Electric Power Research Centre (now the NIROO Research
Institute), Pilkington Solar International (now Flagsol) and
Fichtner (now Fichtner Solar) to execute a comprehensive
feasibility study on an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle with
trough technology. The best regions for installing solar thermal
power plants in Iran are Esfahan, Fars, Kerman and Yazd, but
Yazd was eventually selected for implementing the first plant.
The entire high plateau of the Yazd region is characterised by
an annual direct normal radiation of 2,511kWh/m2.

The government of Iran is now discussing potential funding
with the Global Environment Facility.

Israel
The Israeli Ministry of National Infrastructure, which is also
responsible for the energy sector, decided in 2001 to make
CSP technology a strategic element in the Israel electricity
market in the period up to 2005, with an initial aim for a unit of
100 MWe. There is an option to increase the CSP contribution
up to 500 MWe at a later stage, after the successful operation
of the first unit.

The investment cost of the first unit is expected to be US$ 200
million, with an estimated production cost of 9 ¢/kWh for the
electricity output, and an expected reduction to 7 ¢/kWh when
the 500 MWe unit is completed. Construction and operation of
the first unit will create around 1,000 jobs during the construction
period and 120 permanent jobs in operation and maintenance.
The Ministry of National Infrastructure has now designated a
team to locate a suitable site, with the likely location in the
Yamin Plain near Arad in the south of the country. The
technology will probably be parabolic troughs, although a final
decision may depend on the company which builds the plant.

Construction of a 100 MWe solar power plant at a cost of US$
250 million was officially agreed by the Israel Electric
Company (IEC) in February 2002, with the option to increase
the capacity up to 500 MWe. The IEC approved establishment
of the plant on the condition that the Israel Electric Authority
takes account of the higher cost of the electricity through its
national tariff policy. This will mean a slight increase in the
price of electricity to the public.

The key findings were:
• The solar resource in the US South-west is comparable in

scale to the hydropower resource of the North-west.

• CSP is clean, large-scale power that could provide a very

significant contribution to South-west US electricity needs.

• CSP could be scaled up rapidly, although it might take 6-8

years to achieve 1,000 MW because of initial project
development time.

• CSP costs are not yet competitive with conventional power,

requiring financial support for the first 1,000 MW.

• Overall cost of a programme would be $1.8 billion,

equivalent to $1.40/watt installed for troughs, $2.00/watt
installed for towers and $2.60/watt installed for dishes.

Solargenix Solar is now carrying out a planning project funded
by the California Energy Commission, and in cooperation with
Californian municipal utilities. This aims to develop the
reference PPA terms and conditions for 1,000 MW of trough
plants over ten years which will satisfy municipal utility goals
as well as industry needs. The project will also identify sites,
transmission line issues, the resource mix for utilities and the
expected cost of electricity.

Two other projects are meanwhile progressing in Nevada. A 50
MW plant using parabolic trough technology is to be built in
Eldorado Valley by SOLARGENIX, with its output supplied to
utility subsidiaries of Sierra Pacific Resources. This was made
possible by legislation requiring utilities to supply a percentage
of electricity from renewable sources. Contracts are also being
finalised for the Nevada Solar Dish Power Project, a 1 MW
demonstration plant (funded by the US Department of
Energy’s Concentrating Solar Power Program) designed to
validate the operation of a dish-engine system. A project for a
1 MW parabolic trough using an ORC engine is also in
progress in Arizona. This is being implemented by Solargenix.

A recent technical evaluation of US solar thermal power by
Sargent and Lundy, commissioned by the Department of
Energy, the most thorough technical analysis to date, shows a
declining cost curve towards 3.5-6 US cents perkWh – based
on continued technology improvements, mass production
efficiencies and larger plant sizes.

Algeria
As Algeria takes its place within the IEA/SolarPACES
programme, the country’s emerging interest in CSP
technology could lead to exciting developments in the future –
including solar power exports to Europe.

The trigger which has provided the framework for new
investment opportunities is liberalisation of the Algerian power
market, created following a new law passed in February 2002.
Two major objectives, to be achieved by 2010, are to build a
number of power plants with a total capacity of 2,000 MW,
and secondly, to construct two power export cables
(Algeria-Spain and Algeria-Italy) with an export capacity of
1,200 MW. Meanwhile, both the Algerian government and
the private sector are aware of Europe’s commitment to
renewable energy sources, in particular the European
Union’s aim to have 12% of renewable energy by 2010.

Algeria has now taken on its own domestic commitment, with
the aim of increasing the solar percentage in its energy mix to
5% by 2010. But beyond this Algeria is looking for a close
partnership with the European Union so that Algerian plants
can help deliver the green energy needed for Europe to meet
its targets. To bring these plans to reality, and to enhance the
participation of the private sector – both local and international
– a new company has been created. New Energy Algeria
(NEAL) brings together Sonatrach, the Algerian hydrocarbon
producer, Sonelgaz, the Algerian power producer and
distributor, and SIM, a privately owned company.

NEAL is to promote renewables in Algeria by helping to
develop firstly, cost effective power plants which will enable
access to energy for the whole population, secondly, the
technical, economic and financial support for plant
development, and thirdly, more efficient use of the country’s
gas reserves. NEAL’s specific interest in solar thermal power is
the result of an analysis of national strengths, since Algeria
benefits not only from abundant solar radiation but also a
ready gas supply.

NEAL’s first initiative is to build a new 140 MW ISCC power
plant with 30 MW of solar output. With the expected political
support, the aim is to have this ready for operation by 2006.
But while preparing for the near-term supply of solar thermal
power, NEAL is also working closely with the Ministry of
Energy to have a law adopted that will provide proper
incentives for renewable energy sources, underpinning their
economic viability. Part of this will involve establishing a green
certificate market.

US Policy Priorities
Three trends are giving solar thermal power some market momentum in the US. Firstly, a deregulated power generation system
has inspired state-mandated Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards, the right of interconnection and the sale of green power.
Secondly, concerns about implementing the Clean Air Act and implementing climate change emissions reductions are driving
use of cleaner technologies, including renewable energy. And thirdly, the private sector has been advancing solar thermal
technologies on its own, with a bare minimum of federal support and some at a state and local government level.

Emerging technologies need sustained orderly development, however, to attract further private capital, scale-up manufacturing
and establish installation and service capabilities to meet expanding market demand. Six policies are required to expand the
market for solar thermal and to achieve the economies-of-scale required in manufacturing, system integration and deployment.

1. National or Regional Solar Portfolio Standard – Establishing minimum set asides based on relative renewable energy resource
availability, including solar thermal power alongside other clean distributed generation, is an essential tool to create market
based mechanisms.

2. Production and investment tax credits – With energy costs slightly higher than geothermal and wind, solar thermal power

needs investment credits for its first two years of initial plant construction (with accelerated depreciation) and then production
credits (1.8 cents per kWh) for the following eight years, with waivers for investors from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).

3. Encouragement for solar electric power can come via mandated green power purchases for federal agencies and other public

and municipal bodies.

4. Expanded federal support for a solar thermal power R&D program is required to support the market expansion envisaged for
the Southwestern United States. A recent study by Sargent & Lundy concluded that further technology improvements will
result in approximately a 50% reduction in the cost of electricity from trough plants and 25% from power tower plants.

5. Federal loan guarantees – As proposed for emerging coal and nuclear technologies, these should first be applied to CSP

installations to “prove out” these federal tools in the cleanest, lowest emission technology available to displace higher cost,
higher emissions midday peak power.

6. Formal federal support to existing federal-to-state programs could yield a significant number of megawatts in both larger

central CSP generating facilities and distributed CSP generation.

There is no question that the United States has some of the world’s best high-value solar radiation, which is optimal for
concentrated solar power. There now exists a critical mass of private companies and private investment along with a range of
technologies that could play a meaningful role in the US and global markets. Policy trends relating to deregulation and
environmental protection bode well for establishing a maturing industry.

Italy
In 2001, the Italian parliament allocated €110 million for a
CSP development and demonstration programme. Since then,
several parabolic trough plant concepts have been under
development.

Brazil
Brazil applied in 1997 through the UNDP for a GEF-supported
Project Development Fund to conduct a study on “Reducing
the Long-term Cost of Solar Thermal Power Generation”. The
application was approved by GEF in early 1998 and an
implementation agreement signed with UNDP. After a period of
project reorganisation, work was started by CEPEL in
December 2001. The study is due to be published in 2003.

Australia
There are three main areas of solar thermal electricity generation
in Australia. The most commercially advanced of these is the 35
MW CLFR system to be incorporated into an existing coal-fired
power station, with construction already underway. The initial
plant is being constructed by the company Solar Heat and
Power for approximately US$ 500 per kWe (peak) without direct
subsidy. This low cost is achieved because the project uses
existing turbines and electrical infrastructure. It has no storage
and a relatively low capacity factors, but it is approximately
competitive with advanced wind generation. Further CLFR plant
proposals using storage are now being discussed with utilities
having an annual output equal to 4% of the NSW electricity
supply. Including storage for a 56% capacity factor and using a
moderate pressure turbine and generator, these will cost about
US$1400 per kWe peak according to SHP. Other analysis
suggests that large systems such as CLFR plants will be more
cost effective with a much more rapid uptake over the early
years. However, unlike trough technology, the CLFR technology
will have to be proven and thus represents a more optimistic
scenario than the European Solar Thermal Power Industry
Association approach.

The next most developed system is the 50kW parabolic dish
prototype at the Australian National University, but although the
dish is being refurbished, there is as yet no commercial project
announced. A 1.5 MW version of the Yeoman?s Floating Solar
Concentrator is currently being built. Research is also being
conducted into MTSA beam splitting technology that would both
power a photovoltaic array and provide heat to operate a
Brayton cycle micro-turbine, and a single tower prototype is
being proposed by a consortium the CSIRO, the University of
Sydney, and SHP Pty Ltd.

THE FUTURE FOR SOLAR
THERMAL POWER

The Greenpeace – ESTIA Scenario
for 2020 and Projection to 2040
This scenario was prepared by Greenpeace
International and the European Solar Thermal
Power Industry Association in order to project
what could be achieved given the right market
conditions. Its core assessment looks forward
18 years from the base year of 2002 to the
end of the second decade of the 21st century.
It is not a prediction, but a scenario based on
expected advances in solar thermal
technology coupled with the growing number
of countries which are supporting CSP
projects in order to achieve both climate
change and power demand objectives.

Over the period of the scenario, solar thermal technology will
have emerged from a relatively marginal position in the
hierarchy of renewable energy sources to achieve a substantial
status alongside the current market leaders such as hydro and
wind power. From a current level of just 354 MW, by 2015 the
total installed capacity of solar thermal power plants will have
passed 5,000 MW. By 2020 additional capacity would be
rising at a level of almost 4,500 MW each year.

At the end of the scenario period, the total installed
capacity around the world will have reached the
impressive figure of 21,540 MW.

The scenario also shows how much electricity would be
produced by solar thermal power plants. This is based on the
assumption that 1 MW of capacity produces 2,500 MW hours
of electricity per annum.

By 2020 solar thermal power will have achieved an annual
output of more than 54,000,000 MWh, or 54 TWh.

In terms of capital investment, it is assumed in the scenario
that during the initial years, solar field investment costs are at
a level of US$ 2,500/kW installed, slightly lower but close to
the US$ 3,000/kW level of the SEGS plants in California during
the early 1990s. These specific investment costs then fall
gradually over the timescale of the scenario, and are cut by
half in 2020. This means that the investment volume in solar
thermal power plants will rise from US$ 375 million in 2005 to
almost US$ 7.6 billion in 2020.

The total investment over the scenario period would
amount to more than US$ 41.8 bn.

A substantial level of employment would be an important
by-product of this expansion in the solar thermal power
industry. At the end of the scenario period, more than
20,000 highly qualified jobs will have been created just in

plant operation and maintenance. More than 40,000 jobs
would be created in plant construction, and a further 40,000
in plant component manufacture.

By 2020, about 200,000 people will be permanently
employed in the solar thermal power industry worldwide.

The final benefit from realisation of the Greenpeace-ESTIA
scenario would be to the environment.

Over the period up to 2020 a total of 154 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide would be saved from being emitted into
the atmosphere, making a substantial contribution to
international climate change targets.

The assumption here is that 1 MWh of installed solar thermal
power capacity results in the saving of 600 kilograms of
carbon dioxide. The total annual savings of 32.7 million tonnes
CO2 in 2020 is equivalent to 20 coal fired power plants.

The scenario is also broken down by region of the world and
into the main country markets. By 2020, the leading regions
will be Europe. The most promising countries according to the
scenario, each with more than 1,000 MW of solar thermal
projects expected by 2020, are Spain, the United States,
Mexico, Australia and South Africa.

Finally, a further projection is made for the potential
expansion of the solar thermal power market over another
two decades up to 2040. This shows that by 2030 the
worldwide capacity will have reached 106,000 MW, and by
2040 a level of almost 630,000 MW. Increased availability of
plant because of the greater use of efficient storage
technology will also increase the amount of electricity
generated from a given installed capacity.

This means that by 2040 the proportion of global
electricity demand which could be satisfied by solar
thermal power will have reached a share of 5%. This is on
the assumption that global electricity demand doubles by
that time, as projected by the International Energy Agency.
Long before that point, however, solar thermal power will
already be a mature, well-established and market-
orientated source of electricity supply.

PART5

POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The Political Challenge
Energy is considered to be a vital ingredient
for any economic development. The history of
industrialisation in today’s developed nations
is also a history of massive fossil energy
exploitation, with its associated benefits of
rapid availability, high energy density, and – at
least initially – low generation costs. Over the
past three decades, however, the harmful
environmental impact of fossil fuels on the
regional and global climate has been brought
into sharp focus.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 42

For those nations still in development, energy is even more
vital as they have to make up for, and keep pace with, the
mature energy infrastructure of the industrialised nations in an
increasingly globalised economy. Furthermore, it is widely
accepted in the developing world that these countries should
not just copy the historical energy patterns of the developed
world, but should consider building up a sustainable energy
infrastructure which avoida long term detriments.

Although history has shown that building up such an
infrastructure is most efficiently managed by the private
sector, governments do have a public responsibility to ensure
fair market rules, level playing fields for the market participants
and, most importantly, sustainability of living conditions for the
generations to come. Hence they face many challenges in
formulating current and future energy policies. They have to
respond to the need for security of energy supply, economic
growth, sustainable development, employment and
technological development and to combat the growing effects
of climate change. Renewable energy technologies are
considered to have a positive impact on all these parameters.

This study clearly demonstrates that solar thermal power
plants, up to now not widely known as an energy technology,
are one of the most promising renewable sources – capable
of meeting 5% of future global electricity demand by the year
2040. The developing world in particular, with its abundant
and evenly distributed solar resource, can contribute in a
cost-effective way to the bulk power supply of mega-cities,
where decentralised or fluctuating power supply would be
inadequate. This strategic power supply advantage has
already motivated development banks, such as the World
Bank, European Investment Bank and the German
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau to support the implementation
of solar thermal power plants.

Without initial political and financial support, however, solar
thermal power remains at a competitive disadvantage, largely
because of inadequate price information in the world’s
electricity markets resulting from decades of massive financial
and structural support to traditional polluting fuels and power
plant technologies.

Solar thermal power plants have to compete in a well
established, very competitive energy market segment where
older nuclear and fossil fuel power stations produce electricity
at marginal cost because the interest payments and
depreciation on their investment costs have already been paid
by consumers and taxpayers. Political action is therefore
needed to overcome those distortions and create a level
playing field in which the economic and environmental
benefits of solar thermal power can be fully exploited.

2. Successful Market Creation Policy
Measures
A clear, visible market for solar thermal power must be defined
in order for a project developer to seriously consider getting
involved. Just as with any other investment, the lower the risk
to the investor, the lower the costs can be for supplying the
product. The most important measures for establishing new
solar power markets are therefore those where the market for
solar electricity is clearly embedded in national laws, providing
a stable and long term investment environment with relatively
low investor risks and sufficient returns.

As already outlined, a key benefit of a growing solar thermal
energy market is job creation. It is estimated that direct and
indirect employment in the industry worldwide, not including
the production of components and equipment, could rise to
about 100,000 jobs by 2020. In order to attract solar thermal
power plant suppliers to establish manufacturing facilities,
markets need to be strong, stable and reliable, with a clear
commitment to long term expansion.

• Legally Binding Targets for Renewable Electricity

in the EU and US

In recent years an increasing number of countries have
established targets for renewable energy as part of their
greenhouse gas reduction policies. These are either
expressed as specific quantities of installed capacity or as a
percentage of energy consumption.

Renewable energy targets are most effective if they are
based on a percentage of a nation’s total electricity
consumption. This creates an incentive to optimise
renewable technologies in the supply mix, and provides a
guide to where immediate policy changes are required in
order to achieve the anticipated targets. But targets have
little value if they are not accompanied by policies to
achieve a level playing field in electricity markets, to
eliminate market barriers and to create an economic
framework environment that will attract investment.

The most ambitious target has been set by the European
Union. In 2001 the European Council and the European
Parliament adopted a Renewable Energy Directive
establishing national targets for each member state.
Although these are not at present legally binding, the
Directive aims at doubling the share of renewable energy
sources in the primary energy mix from 6% to 12% by 2010,
equivalent to 22% of Europe’s total electricity consumption.
If this non-binding approach appears not to be working,
then the Directive allows the European Commission to
submit proposals to the European Parliament and Council
for mandatory renewable energy targets.

Source: Directive 2001/77/EC on the Promotion of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources

The table below shows the national targets for supply from
renewable energy expected in the 15 current EU member
countries, expressed as a percentage of gross national
electricity consumption.

The majority of current supply comes from large hydro
stations, although this technology is already widely exploited
and will not represent a major new renewable source in
Europe. Most of Europe’s renewable energy supply increase
will therefore come from biomass plants, wind energy parks,
small hydro and solar thermal power plants.

In the US, Renewable Portfolio Standards have been
established to gradually increase the contribution of clean,
renewable power in the supply mix of some of its federal
states. If utility companies are failing to reach certain agreed
targets, they will be penalised through compensation
payments. This mechanism, with initial targets for 2-5% of a
state’s total electricity demand by 2005 and 2010,
respectively, already starting to work. As a result, Nevada and
Arizona are both negotiating long-term power purchase
contracts for their first new solar thermal power plants.

• Specific Policy Mechanisms – the Case of

European “Feed-In Laws”

A specific European policy mechanism which has enabled the
achievement of renewable energy supply targets is the fixed
tariff system, where a specific tariff rate or premium is
allocated to particular renewable technologies. These rates
and premiums reflect the relative cost difference of the
specific renewable technology compared to the price offered
by the liberalised power market for bulk power. Utility
companies are obliged to buy all renewable power produced
at the rates established in the specific feed-In law. The
differential cost of renewable power compared to the market
price of bulk fossil or nuclear generated electricity is borne by
the electricity ratepayer.

The most successful feed-in law schemes have been
established in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Spain, with the
most remarkable result that about 20,000 MW of wind power
is currently on stream. Biomass and small hydro power plants
are also increasing.

Surprisingly, considering its cost-effectiveness amongst solar
power technologies, solar thermal power had not been
included in any feed-in tariff system until Spain published its
“Prima” in September 2002.

3. Public-Private Partnerships for
Introducing Solar Thermal Power
• The GEF-BMU-KfW-ESTIA/SEIA Approach
At the International Executive Conference on Concentrating
Solar Power, held in Berlin, Germany in 2002, the Global
Environmental Facility, the German Kreditanstalt für
Wiederaufbau bank, the German Federal Ministry for the
Environment, and both the European and American Solar
Thermal Power Industry Associations discussed a Global
Market Initiative for Concentrating Solar Power and defined
strategies for its rapid and large-scale market introduction.
This strategy was published as the Declaration of Berlin.

The participants included politicians, senior government
executives, the financial community, donor organisations, the
CSP industry, independent power project developers and
potential plant owners from 16 countries. The participating
stakeholder groups supported the launching of a CSP Global
Market Initiative to be further substantiated at the follow-up
conference in Palm Springs, California in October 2003.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 45

GLOBAL MARKET INITIATIVE
TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND THE GLOBAL MARKET
FOR CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER (CSP)

Solar energy is the most evenly distributed and readily available renewable energy resource on the planet. Solar thermal
power plants, which make use of this concentrating solar power (CSP) technology have the capability to meet a significant
percentage of the future global electricity demand without technological, economic or resource limitations, specifically in
sun-belt regions such as the south-west U.S., southern Europe and parts of the developing world.

This capability and the ability of solar thermal power plants to dispatch power as needed during peak demand periods has
motivated development banks, such as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the German Kreditanstalt für
Wiederaufbau (KfW), as well as the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), the European Union and the U.S. Department of
Energy, to support the implementation of this technology.

At the First International Executive Conference on Concentrating Solar Power in June 2002 in Berlin, Germany, the GEF, the
KfW, the German Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMU), the European Solar Thermal Power Industry Association
(ESTIA) and the American Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) discussed a Global Market Initiative (GMI) for CSP, and
defined strategies towards the rapid and large-scale market introduction of the technology. This commitment was published
as the Declaration of Berlin, which was registered as a UNEP Market Facilitation WSSD Type-II Partnership for Concentrating
Solar Power Technologies.

The participating stakeholder groups of the Declaration of Berlin are now urging the implementation of this Global Market
Initiative to accelerate the entry of CSP into the market. However, a visible, reliable and growing market for solar thermal
power with normal risk levels must be established in order for many project developers and CSP equipment suppliers to
make the needed long-term investments to achieve lower costs.

There are three basic policy areas that will significantly impact the increased use of concentrated solar power

I.  Political and technological targets to trigger new power markets

Establish a consistent basis of national laws and regulations, such as feed-in tariffs specifically also applicable for CSP,
to pave the way for reaching the anticipated renewable supply targets committed in Kyoto.

Establish Renewable Portfolio Standards that encourage actual "portfolios" of electricity and heat generation from
renewables, and insure that the locally available energy resources are evenly utilized and encouraged.

Make green tariff schemes available for electricity imports from high insolation areas in neighboring states and/or
countries.

II. Regulatory improvements

Avoid limitations on capacity or operating strategies that make the energy production introduction more costly thus
hindering introduction of CSP technology.

Remove restrictive laws to interconnection which will allow concentrated solar plants to more easily hook into the electric
grid at the end user (customer), distribution or transmission points.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 46

III. Improve financing mechanisms

Ensure that the Kyoto instruments (emission trading) are made applicable to CSP and that the mechanisms are bankable.
Institute Production Tax Credits (PTCs) as wind energy now enjoys and which catapulted the technology globally. Maintain
investment tax credits to assist in the initial capital investments before CSP plants begin to produce power.

Establish loan guarantee programs via existing windows at multilateral banks, existing US national lending programs such
as SBA, RUS, FmHA, Regional Power Administrations, and global environmental programs such as GEF, UNEP, and
UNDP. These programs allow private sector banking institutions to do the necessary project due diligence while
providingthem with some extra insurance to loan on new technology projects which are inherently more risky.

The Global Market Initiative (GMI): 5000 MW till 2015
Recent activities indicate that CSP technologies are at the threshold of very extensive commercial deployment. One of the
primary market barriers is a lack of knowledge about the current technology and near-term potential of CSP by energy policy
makers, regulators, general contractors and would-be owners and users. With increased awareness of the numerous benefits
of using the solar thermal energy resources around the world, it is anticipated that new CSP projects will soon come on
stream. There are about 10 advanced projects underway around the world, totalling over 1000 MW of new solar capacity.

With the understanding that these projects would come online faster and be more commercial viable if there was a forum for
collaboration among interested countries and states, an international public-private partnership has been proposed to meet
this need. The goal of this partnership, called the CSP Global Market Initiative, is to facilitate the building of 5,000 MW of
CSP power world-wide over the next 10 years. Participation is open to governments in countries or states with adequate
solar thermal resources or that have an industrial capability in CSP, but lack the adequate solar thermal resources, and who
accept the framework proposed below.

Different Strategies for Different Regions
Today's CSP technologies require a minimum direct normal solar radiation level of 1,900 kWh/m2/a. This can be found in
many countries around the Sunbelt of the world. However, adequate solar radiation is just the beginning. Successful CSP
projects require adequate tariffs, long-term power contracts with credit worthy off-takers, access to commercial financing
and where needed, subsidies and supportive policies. To take advantage of the different situations and needs of both
developed and developing countries, the GMI will use three different strategies.

(1) Region I
In southern Europe, Israel, and the south-western US, most of the essential elements of the GMI (described below) already
exist or could reasonably be expected. In these countries, existing CSP-specific targets or portfolio standards will create
market-based demand and a feed-in law or system benefit charge, both of which rely on the ratepayers to cover the price
gap. In Region I, political support is primarily needed to make targets, policies and tariffs stable and predictable so that
commercial financing can be secured. Tariffs should reflect different levels of solar radiation intensity so that each region,
country or state with radiation patterns above 1,900 kWh/m2/a has the chance to built-up this strategic backstop technology.

Eventually, tariff harmonisation schemes may help to ensure that the resource is more evenly built. Capacity restrictions for
individual projects should be removed to make best use of economies of scale to help drive prices lower. Alternatively, the
demand may be aggregated to assure that CSP plants are built in sizes of 50 MW or larger.

SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS 47

(2) Region II
For developing countries that are or will soon be connected to Region I countries by a power grid, such as Mexico and North
Africa, power generated from CSP plants built in these countries may be sold to Region I countries and could receive a
premium price. As a result of excellent solar radiation resources and good grid connections, the south-western US and
northern Mexico as well as southern Europe and North Africa are two such regions. In Region II, political initiative is primarily
needed for formulating a fair scheme that accounts for both improved tariffs for clean energy generated in the Region II
countries allowing a benefit from enhanced feed-in tariffs for such energy that is imported into their service territory. To avoid
large tariff differences between cheap bulk fossil-based energy and solar power generation, access to favourable Region I
tariffs should only be offered when subsidies are no longer available on fossil power production in Region II. The tariff
difference can be further reduced through a blend of CDM (i.e., carbon tax credits), and preferential financing, such as
theEU´s energy sector infrastructure support MEDA Program for Region II.

(3) Region III
For other developing countries, not interconnected to the grid of Region I countries, such as Brazil, India, Iran, Jordan and
South Africa, preferential financing in the form of subsidies (could be grants, soft loans, carbon credits, CDM, green
premiums, etc.) provided by Region I sources will be required to support the Region III group of countries desire for
development of clean CSP power plants. An example of such sources is the $0.5 billion dollars for renewable energy that
was announced by German Chancellor, Mr. Gerhard Schroeder, in his UN Environmental Summit speech in Johannesburg in
September 2002. In the medium term, the Region III countries will profit from closing the price gap as a result of growing
installed CSP capacity in Regions I and II. Recognising that financial resources are limited, Region II and III countries,
therefore, must contribute something to help reduce the cost of the CSP plants, such as free or low cost land, infrastructure
and grid access, etc.

Organization, Structure and Management
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has agreed to endorse and sponsor the CSP Global Market Initiative (GMI). The GEF
and the CSP industry will jointly form a CSP GMI Advisory/Management Board initially consisting of 2-3 highly respected and
well-known business leaders from Region I plus 1 board member representing Region II and 1 board member from Region III.

In order to represent the participating countries and states, an Executive Committee will be formed to support the Advisory
Board, to provide input and to assure the effective and successful implementation of the Initiative.

This Executive Committee will consist of senior people, representing power project development, power project finance,
industry and government. Each participating country and state will be entitled to one Executive Committee seat. The
Executive Committee is envisioned to include representatives from the following countries and states:

Algeria
Jordan
Arizona
Mexico
California
Morocco

Egypt
Nevada
Germany
New Mexico
Greece
South Africa

Iran
Spain
Israel
Turkey
