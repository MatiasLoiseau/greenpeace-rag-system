America’s Energy Future

For decades, we have relied on oil, coal and gas to meet
our ever-increasing energy needs, and now we are facing
the  consequences  of  our  actions.  Global  warming  has
become a threat that we can no longer ignore, with over
60 percent of Americans living in areas with unhealthy air.

America  needs  an  energy  policy  makeover.  Renewable
energy  is  affordable  and  available  now.  A  national
commitment  to  clean,  renewable  energy  and  energy
efficiency  would  reduce  pollution,  create  millions  of  high
tech jobs, diversify our nation’s energy sources, enhance
our  national  security  and  save  Americans  billions  of
dollars.

Despite  the  benefits  of  clean  energy,  the  Bush  adminis-
tration insists on keeping our nation tied to the dirty ener-
gy  industr y.  By  catering  to  special  interests  like
Halliburton,  Enron,  ExxonMobil,  Sempra  and  Shell,  the
Bush  administration  has  compromised  our  health  and
spoiled the environment for future generations to come.

The Bush Administration’s Track Record

Clean Air Act: The Bush administration let the coal indus-
try off the hook by gutting the New Source Review provi-
sions of the Clean Air Act.  This industry payback allows
dirty coal plants to emit more smog and other pollutants,
causing acid rain and global warming.

Mercury: Another dangerous toxin produced by coal plants
is mercury.  The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA)
top scientist recently warned that one in every six children
is  born  each  year  with  potentially  unsafe  levels  of

mercury in their blood. Yet a component of the Clear Skies
Initiative  recommends  delaying  the  mercury  cleanup
mandated by current law for 10 to 20 years.

Drilling  on  Public  Lands: Greenpeace  and  the  American
public  keep  reminding  President  Bush  that  public  lands
belong to the public, but the administration does not seem
to  get  the  message.  President  Bush  tried  to  drill  the
pristine  Alaska  National  Wildlife  Refuge  and  proposed  a
variety of other development projects.

Energy Bill: President Bush’s energy bill could have been
the  legislation  that  built  a  clean  energy  economy;  it  is
instead laden with favors for the administration’s friends
in the dirty energy industry.  If passed, it will direct billions
of  dollars  toward  the  coal,  nuclear  and  oil  industry,  yet

does  little  to  fight  global  warming,  protect  public  health,
conserve public lands, create sustainable jobs or promote
national security.

Kyoto  Protocol: President  Bush  also  refused  to  sign  the
Kyoto  Protocol,  an  international  treaty  to  reduce  global
warming emissions.

A Vision for Clean Energy

Not  only  is  clean  energy  the  morally  sound  and
environmentally friendly choice, in many cases it is also the
economical one. Clean energy has reached a point where it
is cost-competitive with fossil fuels. With a strong federal
commitment, renewable energy prices will fall even further,
and America will regain its role in the world as the leading
technological clean energy innovator.

Greenpeace is proud to endorse the "Apollo Alliance," – a
broad  coalition  of  labor,  environmental,  business,  urban
and faith communities in support of good jobs and energy
independence.  Apollo’s  10-point  plan  centers  around  a
$300 billion investment in clean, renewable energy that will
create  over  three  million  jobs,  reinvest  the  savings  from
clean  energy  back  into  the  economy  and  decrease  our
dependence on foreign fuels.

Wind Power: Wind power is the fastest growing source of
power in the world and is quickly becoming the lowest cost
energy source across the country. Studies show that wind
power  can  supply  10  percent  of  the  world's  electricity
within  two  decades.  The  Great  Plains  states  have  been
dubbed the Saudi Arabia of wind energy – indeed, the wind
potential  there  can  supply  our  nation’s  current  energy
needs three times over.

Solar  Power: Solar  power  has  been  growing  in  a  global
capacity by 33 percent annually and can compete with local
electricity  costs  in  several  regions  across  the  country.
Greenpeace and industry research shows that with some
government  support,  the  solar  industry  could  supply
electricity to over two billion people globally in 20 years.

Energy  Efficiency: Energy  efficiency  is  the  easiest  and
least expensive way to reduce our reliance on dirt energy
sources.  New  energy-efficient  products,  like  light  bulbs,
refrigerators and hybrid cars, prove that we can drastically
reduce  our  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  and  foreign  oil.
Through  the  use  of  these  products,  Americans  saved
enough energy to power 15 million homes, saving $7 billion
last year.

Get Active

Greenpeace  calls  on  the  next  president  of  the  United
States  to  create  a  new  initiative  for  renewable  energy  in
America within the first 100 days in office. This standard
should  mandate  that  20  percent  of  our  nation's  energy
come from renewable sources like wind and solar by 2020.
In  addition,  the  federal  government  should  install  250
Megawatts  of  solar  power  by  the  end  of  the  first  term,
providing a huge boost to the U.S. solar industry.

Join Greenpeace in our nationwide campaign to make the
next  four  years  the  golden  era  for  clean  energy
development in the United States. This commitment would
slow  global  warming,  reduce  health  risks  like  childhood
asthma  and  mercur y  contamination,  while  creating
thousands of jobs and improving national security. To learn
