“(The) impact from accumulating radioactive water at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant has been “under 
control.” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, October 16th 2013.1 
 
"There is a mountain of issues, including co ntaminated water, decommissioning, compensation and 
contamination...When I think of the victims still living in difficult evacuation conditions I don't think we can use the word  
'settled'," to describe the Fukushima plant," Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Janua ry 30th 2015.2 
 
 
Introduction  
Four years af ter the start of the Fukushima D aiichi nuclear power plant disaster of March 11th 2011 the enormous 
scale of the nuclear crisis continues to unfold. In the face of the continuing disaster, even Japanese Prime Minister Abe 
appears to be revising his position of 2013 that the situation at Fukushima is under control. The INES 7 nuclear 
accident on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear event scale3, which led to the melt down of three 
General Electr ic Mark 1 Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) at Fu kushima D aiichi has created a nuclear disaster unique in 
the history of nuclear power. Plant owner, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), and sub -contracting companies 
have used tens of thousands of workers duri ng the past four years,4 in an attempt to bring the site under some form of 
control, reduce the risks of further accidents and to lower radioactive releases into the environment, including the 
Pacific Ocean. Despite the enormous efforts of these workers si gnificant contamination continues to be released from 
the site and the threats of further accident remain high. The scale of the challenges, including those yet to be identified, 
mean s that this work will continue for decades to come. As the people of Japa n remember and pay their respects to 
the victims of the Great Tohoku earthquake, and amidst all the unc ertainties about the Fukushima D aiichi nuclear 
disaster, one thing is certain, tragically there will be many more anniversaries in the years ahead when t he crisis at the 
Fukushima site will still threaten the environment and people of Japan.   
 
 
Water, water everywhere  
The multiple problems facing TEPCO in relation to the management of contaminated water are unprecedented. For 
nearly four years si nce the s tart of the Fukushima D aiichi accident, TEPCO has been pumping hundreds of tons of 
water each day into the plant to cool the molten nuclear reactor fuel reactor units 1, 2 and 3.5 Without this cooling 
water the molten fuel (corium) temperature would rise leading to additional nuclear reactions. The precise locations of 
the molten cores6 remain unknown to TEPCO or anyone else, though it is accepted that a large proportion has melted 
through the steel pressure vessels into the lower containment.7 The coolant  water with added neutron -absorbing

7 Update  on the Nuclear and Radiolog ical Situation at Fukushima Dai ichi, Large and Associat es, Greenpeace Germany May 25th 2011; TEPCO: 

 
 
 
boron is pumped and sprayed into the main vessels; it then leaks into the secondary containment through the holes 
and cracks at the bottom of the reactor vessels, into the basements of the reactor buildings and the conne cted turbine 
buildings. The molten fuel cooling operation will be required to continue for many years.  
 
It is the massive volume of cooling water that accounts for the majority of the radioactively contaminated water stored 
in approximately 1000 steel tank s assembled on the site since 2011. As of December 2014, a total of 320,000 tons of 
this highly contaminated water was stored in the tanks.8 TEPCO is operating several technologies to remove up to 62 
radionuclides from this water, not including the radioac tive isotope tritium.9 Multiple delays and technical breakdowns 
have occurred during the past years.10 However, TEPCO have scaled up their program and during the month to 
December 17th 2014, the volume of highly contaminated water was reduced by 20,000 tons . The principle 
technologies being used, including for the removal of strontium -90, a bone -seeking carcinogenic isotope – are ALPS11 
and Kurion12. In the week to February 12th, 2015, TEPCO expect to process 16,000 tons of highly contaminated 
water,13 with a predicted maximum processing of 60,000 tons of water each month according to the company.14 At 
the same time, treated water with high levels of tritium amounted to 297,000 tons as of February 8th 2015, which will 
continue to increase until they reac h the point if and when they are able remove tritium.15 
 
TEPCO's schedule was to have completed processing of all highly contaminated water by the end of March 2015 but 
was revised in January 2015 when the company announced that it had completed processing of “approximately 50 
percent”.16 A new schedule is to be announced in March, with TEPCO predicting that it will complete processing of 
water in May. At the same time, around 300 tons of water each day is required to cool the remaining core and molten 
fuel in the three reactors.17  
 
Underground water – The official estimate is that 800 tons of water flows onto the site each day, of which TEPCO 
estimate 300 -400 tons becomes contaminated. TEPCO state that the contamination of groundwater entering the site 
is due to surface contamination permeating the soil and reaching the ground water, and that 'theoretically' the

groundwater does not come into contact with water inside the reactor buildings;18as such its a theory not yet proven.  
Efforts to reduce the flow on to t he site have included pumping ground water from wells on the land side of the plant.  
 
TEPCO also launched efforts during the last year to pump up contaminated water in the drainage system immediately 
around the plant (both land side and ocean side), as we ll as at the groundwater drain in close proximity to the ocean. It 
was confirmed that this water was contaminated.19 TEPCO plans to process this water to remove radionuclides, with 
the exception of tritium20, and then release it into the Pacific Ocean – but not before 'understanding' is reached with 
local commercial fishing associations.21  
 
TEPCO is also installing what is described as an 'impermeable' wall on the ocean -side of the plant, the aim of which is 
to prevent contaminated water continuing to flow in to the Pacific. After admitting in 2013 that up to 400 tons of 
contaminated water has been flowing into the ocean since the beginning of the nuclear crisis,22 attempts to prevent 
this contamination have focussed on the construction of the 770 metre undergro und steel pipe and sheet wall. As of 
January 2015, the structure has been nearly completed.23 How effective this will be in preventing contaminated 
groundwater from entering the Pacific remains to be seen. The steel structure is located to a depth of 30 met res, 
which TEPCO asserts is below the permeable soil layer. This assumption is highly questionable due to geological 
surveys of the site, which show permeable sandstone and pumice layers from the surface to a depth of nearly 200 
metres.24 Based upon this po tentially deep ly flawed geological assessment , TEPCO has estimated that there will be a 
reduction of 97.5% of cesium and strontium released into the ocean once this wall is in place, and contaminated 
groundwater is pumped to storage tanks. Tritium discharg es are predicted to be reduced by 93%.25 
 
Ice wall  - TEPCO plans to reduce the volume of groundwater entering the site by constructing what has become 
known as a frozen ice wall – with a circumfer ence of 1.5km around Fukushima D aiichi.26 The technology to be  used 
involves drilling holes and inserting 1571 steel pipes 30 metres into the ground, which will then be cooled to minus 30 
centigrade. TEPCO's aim is that this will then gradually freeze soil to create what they hope will be an ice  wall that will 
signif icantly reduce to one third the present rate of groundwater entering the site and contaminated water on site from 
leaking out. TEPCO plans to begin the freezing operation in March 2015, with the objective to maintain it for six years – 
the time they say th at will be required to seal the reactors from the environment. In addition to looking like an 
unrealistic schedule, there are significant doubts about the effectiveness of the ice wall plan. The uncertainties include 
the actual rate of ground water migrati on, the effect this diversion of water will have on the site, the geology of the site, 
soil movement (including seismic risks) and surface temperature. For good reason, even one of TEPCO's own senior 
international advisors and a Commissioner at the Nuclear  Regulatory Authority (NRA) have questioned the prospects 
for the ice wall barrier's effectiveness and its consequences.27

Another operation that aimed to prevent 11,000 tons of highly contaminated water located in undergr ound trenches at 
the Fukushima D aiichi plant from leaking into the Pacific Ocean also involved efforts to freeze the water – this failed 
during 2014.28 TEPCO have denied29 that this delay will have any effect on the much larger ice wall construction and 
operation around the site, but it has raised further questions as to the effectiveness of their plan. The failure of this 
project would have a major impact on decommissioning plans, radiation dose to workers, and environmental impacts 
at the site over the coming decades.30 
 
Spent fuel removal  - In a positive development, by November 5th 2014, workers completed the removal of all spent 
fuel assemblies in the Fukushima D aiichi reactor Unit 4 storage pool to the common pool storage building on the site.31 
According to its decommissioning plan, TEPCO  plans to transfer 566 fuel assemblies, including 514 spent fuel 
assemblies, now at the Unit 3 reactor to either the common pool or the Fukushima -Daiichi Unit 6 pool during 2015. 
However, unlike the Unit 4 fuel transfer, the work at reactor Units 1 -3 will be done by remote control due to higher 
radiation dose levels in the building, which makes it impossible for human beings to work in the heavily contaminated 
environment. Complicating further the fuel removal is the presence of debris from the damaged cont ainment buildings 
and structures, particularly in spent fuel pools in unit 1 and 3. A range of plans have been developed for each reactor 
with major uncertainties on when they can be implemented.32 On October 30th 2014, TEPCO announced that it would 
review its plan to begin removing spent nuclear fuel from the Unit 1 pool in the first half of fiscal 2017 at the earliest.33 
The utility said it will postpone this work for two years, to sometime during 2019.  
 
Reactor cores and decommissioning schedule  – Proceed ing to decommissioning of the reactors, including accessing 
the molten cores is dependent upon gaining control over the water crisis at the plant. The current plan of TEPCO for 
the removal of 450 tons of molten/damaged fuel is to be based on the flooding o f the containment and torus with the 
aim of reducing radiation levels for workers. The effectiveness and safety implications of this plan remain 
considerable.34 However, due to the scale of damage to the reactor buildings, high radiation le vels as well as t he 
unrealistic  timeframe for removal of spent fuel and debris, there are enormous uncertainties in the actual schedule for 
when TEPCO will reach the point when actual detailed inspection and removal of the molten fuel can begin.  
TEPCO announced in October  2014 that it would reschedule its plan to begin removing the molten nuclear fuel in 
reactor Unit 1 from the first half of 2020 to 2025.35 Clearly given the complexity of t he challenges at the Fukushima 
Daiichi site the prospects for this schedule slipping further are obvious. While TEPCO have published a medium to long 
term decommissioning schedule,36 in reality a final path to decommissioning of the nuclear reactors has yet to 
materialise. Given the scale of the nuclear disaster at Fukushima and the amount of unknowns this is perhaps not 
surprising.  
 
Finally on the overall timescale for decommissioning, TEPCO is on record as indicating 30 -40 years.37 However this is 
based on completing stage 2 of the schedule by 2021 (debris removal, sealing of the plant agai nst leaks, and flooding 
of containments). That is already unrealistic. Nuclear power plant decommissioning of commercial reactors worldwide 
– and depending on the strategy adopted – is in the range of 40 -80 years.38 This timeframe is based upon reactors

that did not experience the kind of catastrophic accident, multiple reactor core meltdowns and exploded containment 
buildings, and continuing uncontrolled radiation releases to the environment as is the reality at Fukushima Daiichi. 
Deferred decommissioning i s the closest comparison with Fukushima: this is where a period of years are allowed to 
pass to reduce radiation levels. The average period estimated for this deferred process is around fifty years. The 
timeframe within TEPCO's decommissioning schedule is simply not credible.  
 
Fukushima prefecture contamination, decontamination and evacuees  
Greenpeace has conducted 23  radiation surveys in the Fukushima prefecture since March 2011.39 We have found 
radiation at levels high enough to raise health concerns for the people who continue to live daily with this 
contamination and those who may be forced to return to places in which the evacuation order has been lifted.  
 
We have also shown th at the authorities have consistently underestimated both the risks and extent of radioactive 
contamination. Based on our results in March 2011, we called for a significant extension to the evacuation area,40 
which was later implemented.41 We advised that unt il decontamination was completed, children should be held back 
from their schools to avoid high radiation levels. We have also found that official monitoring stations systematically 
underestimate the radiation risks for the population.42 
 
Our analysis of th e threats to public health have given residents an alternative to the often contradictory information 
released by Japan’s authorities since the Fukushima disaster began.43 
 
The teams are made up of Greenpeace radiation experts who have been trained in radia tion monitoring and the use of 
sophisticated measuring devices.  
 
In October 2014, Greenpeace monitoring results fr om Iitate (40km from Fukushima D aiichi), Fukushima city (60km), 
Miyakoji of Tamura city (20km) and Kawauchi village (20km) showed that efforts  at decontamination were still failing to 
reduce contamination in many areas to meet the Japanese government’s long -term decontamination target level of 
0.23micro Sv/h. In Kawauchi, part of which had its evacuation order lifted in October 2014,44 Greenpeace  monitoring 
found 59% of our radiation measurements were over the target level and, again, with higher levels found away from the 
roads.45 The decontamination efforts also do not “get rid” of the contamination – they simply move it. The process is 
generatin g vast amounts of radioactive waste, which is being piled up at temporary sites throughout the prefecture. 
Currently 120,000 residents of the prefecture remain displaced in temporary housing or elsewhere in Japan.46

The problems with the compensation proc ess for evacuees are manifold: the processing of claims is delayed, and the 
monthly payments are not enough to ensure people a living, let alone enough to set up a new life. Not everyone is 
eligible for compensation, and the lucky ones only get a fraction of the value of their lost homes. According to many 
polls, most have abandoned hope of picking up their old lives and want enough money to set up new ones.47 
However, in November 2013, a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) panel called on the government to state  that for some 
residents they will never be able to return home - "At some point in time, someone will have to say that this region is 
uninhabitable, but we will make up for it," LDP's secretary general, Shigeru Ishiba.48 
 
In some parts of Fukushima’s 20km evacuation zone, the government has partially lifted the evacuation order. A survey 
by Namie town office in 2013 found that 37.5% of residents had given up on reclaiming their old lives, and the same 
percent remained “unsure”.49 The evacuation order was lif ted in April 2014.50 Only about 19% were confident they 
would return, but even that figure is viewed with scepticism. “Why would people come back here permanently to live?” 
asks Masami Yoshizawa, a farmer who refused to leave his cattle herd in Namie. “Ther e is no infrastructure any more; 
no schools, shops or transport.”  
 
Japan’s central government refined its policy in December 2011, defining evacuation zones as “areas where 
cumulative dose levels might reach 20 millisieverts per year”. This is 20 times hig her than the limit recommended by 
the International Commission on Radiological Protection for non -accidental situations. The 2014 UNSCEAR report51 on 
radiation health consequences from Fukushima has been criticized as not scientific, including by the former  head of 
the radiation -protection program at the World Health Organization’s Regional Office for Europe.52 
 
Local governments are spending millions of dollars to persuade refugees to come back, dividing the nuclear clean -up 
costs with the central government , which handles the most toxic areas. One estimated price tag for decontaminating a 
heavily mountainous and wooded area is $50 billion U.S. dollars.53 That figure is widely considered an underestimate. 
Fighting radiation is now one of the few growth industr ies in Minamisoma, abo ut 20km north of the Fukushima D aiichi 
plant. Most of the city’s 71,000 people fled in March and April 2011. One third had yet to return as of March 2014.  
Decontamination employs about 1,000 people – a large percentage of the town’s remaining able -bodied workforce. 
Minamisoma budgeted US$230m in 2014 alone to clean local homes and businesses of radioactivity.54 
 
In spite of the massive effort and expenses inc urred, decontamination is likely to be a never ending process. The hills, 
mountains, and forests of Fukushima prefecture are heavily contaminated. As a result, radioactive material washes 
down into reservoirs and lower river basins,55 as well as to formerly  decontaminated areas. To put this in some

perspective the half life of one of the most prevalent radionuclides released from the Fukushima accident, cesium 137, 
at 30 years, means that it will remain a hazard for around ten half lives – or 300 years.  
 
Nuclear waste crisis  - As a result of the decontamination program in Fukushima prefecture, temporary storage areas 
are already near capacity and radioactive debris is being stored at about 54,000 locations in the prefecture, including 
the backyards of homes, parking lots, and parks.56 Official estimates of the storage volume required are between 15 
and 28 million cubic meters of waste, enough to fill 12 to 23 Tokyo Domes, generated from the cleanup process. This 
is based on decontamination being restricted to t owns and farmland. The estimated area of Fukushima prefecture 
contaminated above the 1mSv level is 2000 square kilometers, which if it was to be decontaminated would generate in 
the range of 100 milli on tons of  radioactive waste.57 In reality this is not po ssible, and therefore recontamination will 
continue from the forested mountains and rivers for the foreseeable future.  
 
In August 2011, then Prime Minister Naoto Kan, announced that intermediate storage facilities would be needed to 
take in the waste from decontamination in the countermeasure areas in Fukushima prefecture. The Abe Government 
announced in December 2013 that in exchange for hosting the interim storage facilities, the central government plans 
to provide a tax grant to the host municipality and  compensation to individuals whose land will be used in the project.58 
In spite of the incentives offered, plans for buying land in Fukushima were largely abandoned in June 2014,  due to 
public opposition. A total of 16 square kilometers is planned to be use d for hosting the storage facilities, but as of 
February 2015, only 2 percent of this had been secured by the Ministry of Environment, all of it in former industrial 
parks owned by private companies.59 The most likely option is that most of the land will be  acquired through a leasing 
arrangement – but it remains unclear how much of the land will be secured and it “It will take a very long time,” 
according to a senior Environment ministry official.60 
 
In January 2015, the Environment Ministry reached agreement  with Fukushima prefecture for the storage of waste at 
Okuma and Fu taba towns, near the Fukushima D aiichi plant.61 Former residents and community members have an 
legitimate fear that the 16 square kilometres site will end up being the permanent and final nu clear waste disposal site, 
despite a condition that commits the government to remove the waste no later than 2045.62 
The plan was originally to have operation of the interim storage sites by the end of March 2015. Due to the significant 
delays, this will no t be possible, with no timescale for securing sufficient capacity to store the existing nuclear waste at 
tens of thousands of sites around Fukushima, and certainly not the estimated 30 million tons predicted to accumulate 
over the coming years. The first w aste transfer as part of a year long trial will begin in March 2015 with a total of 
43,000 tons planned to be transported during the next year.63 This waste will be stored temporarily, prior to depositing 
in the actual interim storage facilities, constructi on of which is only now about to begin.

Cost of Fukushima accident  
There have been a range of figures on the costs of the Fukushima accident. Note the figures below in dollars reflect the 
yen to dollar rate at that time, since when the yen has depreciated. In November 2013, a figure of US$ 50 billion spent 
so far was published, which did not include the cost of decommissioning.64  
 
Estimates of the total cost of the Fukushima catastrophe, including compensation, fluctuate wildly. TEPCO was told b y 
an advisory panel in October 2011 to prepare for claims of 4.5tn yen ($59bn) in the two years following the disaster, 
until March 2013.65 In December 2011, a Japanese government panel estimated the total costs of the accident at 20 
trillion yen – at that time US$257 billion.66 
 
The private research institute, Japan Centre for Economic Research (JCER), put the bill over the next 10 years at 5.7tn 
yen ($74bn) to 20tn yen ($261bn) or higher.67 But, neither figure includes compensation to the fisheries and farmi ng 
industries, though the latter does budget for the purchase of contaminated land inside the 20km evacuation zone. 
Some sources calculated the cost of buying up contaminated land alone at about 4.3tn yen ($52bn).68 The same JCER 
assessment gave a total ran ge of estimated cost of the disaster, including compensation and  decommissioning the 
Fukushima D aiichi plant’s six reactors, at 40 -50tn yen ($520bn – $650bn).  
 
Conclusion  
“Workers are forced to handle contaminated water in such grim working conditions, whe re any human being should 
not be put to work...They tend to make easy mistakes under the pressure, but it’s not they who are at fault — it’s the 
conditions that force them to do terrible tasks.” Fukushima nuclear worker, March 2014.69 
 
Every day, thousands of workers struggle to make slow delibe rate progress at the Fukushima D aiichi site – confronted 
as they are with high radiation levels, contaminated water, terrible working conditions and low pay.70 In contrast to the 
government and TEPCO, it is the workers  of Fukushima that are doing their best to reduce the risks  from the 
devastated Fukushima D aiichi nuclear power plant. Many things remain unclear about the future, but what is obvious is 
that the threats from Fukushima will persist for many decades to come . Long after the present government, politicians 
and executives of Japan's electric companies are distant memories, future generations of workers will enter the 
Fukushima site each day with the aim of trying to reduce the threats to the people and environm ent of Japan.  
 
The eleventh of March 2015 is a day for us to remember the devastation brought to the lives and communities of the 
people of Japan - but they do not need an anniversary to remember. They live with the consequences every day as 
they have for the past four years, and as they and their families will continue to do for generations to come. The 
principle lesson of the Fukushima Daiichi accident is clear to the people of Japan, if not the Abe government – never 
again should nuclear power threaten t he very existence of the Japanese nation.71
