What  Are  Dioxins?

Dioxins  are  a  class  of  chlorine-containing
chemicals  widely  recognized  as  some  of  the
most  toxic  chemicals  ever  made  by  humans.
They  are  produced  as
the  unwanted
by-products  of  industrial  processes  involving
chlorine or chlorine-containing materials such as
the  manufacture  of  polyvinyl  chloride  plastic
(PVC); pesticide production; and pulp and paper
bleaching.    Dioxins  are    also  produced  when
municipal,  domestic  and  industrial  wastes  that
contain chlorinated materials, such as PVC, are
burned  in  incinerators,  cement  kilns,  industrial
furnaces  and  boilers,  open  barrels  and  when
landfill fires occur.

Consequently,

Once  released,  dioxins  accumulate  in  soils
and  sediments  and  on  vegetation,  where  they
are  ingested  or  otherwise  taken  up  by  fish,
cattle,  and  other  animals  that  serve  as  food
s o u rces.
are
concentrated  in  the  meat,  fish,  dairy,  and  other
animal products that we eat.  As a further result,
dioxins  contaminate  the  tissues,  blood  and
b reast  milk  of  people  in  all  industrialized
countries.  In  the  U.S.,  the  general  population
already  carries  dioxin  levels  that  are  near  the
levels where health effects may occur.

dioxins

In  2000,  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection
Agency  (EPA)  finally  classified  the  most  potent
of
the  dioxins  as  a  human  carc i n o g e n ,
estimating  a  1  in  1,000  risk  to  Americans  from
cancer  due  to  dioxin  exposure.  Dioxins  are
associated  with  a  wide  range  of  other  health
impacts including:

n  Altered sexual development
n  Male and female reproductive problems
n  Suppression of the immune system
n  Diabetes
n  Organ toxicity
n  Altered sex ratio (reduced number of male

offspring)

n  Mimicking or blocking the actions of

hormones.

Dioxins:  Here, There  and
Everywhere

Dioxins  are  unusually  stable  chemicals  and  do
not  break  down  readily  in  the  enviro n m e n t .
C o n s e q u e n t l y,  they  can  be  carried  gre a t
distances by air and ocean currents, circulating
through  the  global  environment.  Dioxins  do  not
dissolve  readily  in  water,  but  do  dissolve  easily
in  fats.    As  a  result,  they  build  up  in  the  fatty
tissues  of  living  organisms,  beginning  with
simple  creatures  such  as  phytoplankton  and
building  up  to  higher  levels  as  they  are  passed
up  the  food  chain.    Animals  at  the  top  of  the
food  chain,  such  as  people,  and  those  with  a
high fat content, such as whales, polar bears or
dolphins,  generally  carry  the  highest  levels  of
dioxins.

When  an  industrial  facility  disperses  dioxins
into  a  nearby  body  of  water,  the  dioxins
accumulate  in  the  phytoplankton  and  other
small organisms in the water.  They build up to
higher levels in the small fish that feed on these
simpler  organisms.  Then,  the  small  fish  are
eaten  by  larger  fish,  which  are  then  eaten  by  a
person. That person has unintentionally ingested
dioxins  that  have  built  up  at  each  step  in  the
food  chain.  As  people  age,  the  buildup  of
dioxins  continues  and  the  concentrations
become  higher,  so  that  health  impacts  are
potentially more serious.

The  Dirty  Dozen

Dioxins  are  among  the  first  twelve  Persistent
O rganic  Pollutants  (POPs)  that  have  been
targeted for elimination by the impending global
POPs  treaty  because  they  constitute  a  serious
threat to human health. Other examples of POPs
a re  PCBs  (transformer  fluids)  and  DDT  (a
pesticide).

Given  the  transfer  of  technology  fro m
industrialized to newly industrialized nations, it is
crucial  that  the  global  POPs  treaty  includes
measures to discourage wealthy countries from
p romoting  and  exporting  technologies  that
generate  dioxins,  such  as
incineration.
Measures  must  also  be  included  to  encourage
wealthy  countries  and  aid  programs  to  assist

newly  industrialized  countries  in  devising  and  implementing
programs to support the development of technologies that are
free of dioxins. Preventing dioxins from being generated in the
first place is the only real answer.

Major sources of dioxins requiring urgent action include:

n Production and disposal of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

plastic

n Incineration (municipal, hazardous and medical waste)
n Pulp and paper production that uses chlorine.

PVC Production, Use and Disposal

Taken  as  a  whole,  the  production  and  disposal  of  PVC  (or
vinyl)  plastic comprises one of the world’s largest sources of
dioxins. Dioxins are created when PVC is produced and when
it is burned in incinerators, open fires, landfill fires, etc. PVC is
one of the most common chlorine-containing products and is
found  in  many  household  items  such  as  children’s  toys,
shower  curtains,  miniblinds,  flooring,  and  wall  coverings.  Its
production accounts for nearly 40 percent of all chlorine in the
United  States  (more  than  any  other  use  of  chlorine),  is  the
single  most  damaging  of  all  plastics,  and  is  the  least
recyclable.  As the environmental and health costs of PVC are
recognized,  it  is  important  that  practical  alternatives  are
demanded  and  made  available.    The  replacement  of  PVC  by
a l t e rnative  materials  appears  to  be  highly
favorable
economically.  For example, in a Canadian analysis, replacing
PVC with alternative materials was estimated to lead to a 15-
fold  increase  in  domestic  revenues  and  a  25-fold  increase  in
jobs.

Effects of Dioxin

Recent research on the health effects from dioxins has shown
that there is serious concern for developing fetuses, children,

adults and animals.  Exposure to dioxins begins at conception

vulnerability is greatest. Exposure to dioxins prior to birth and
during  early  infancy  can  result  in  irreversible  changes  that
manifest  in  subtle  but  highly  problematic  effects  such  as
learning disabilities. Children are more vulnerable than adults
to  many  kinds  of  pollution  and  exposure  to  dioxins  during
childhood can have lifelong effects.  Adults can also face the
threats  of  lung,  skin  and  liver  cancer,  reduced  sperm  counts
and  increases  in  other  disorders  of  the  reproductive  organs.
These  trends  parallel  the  high  incidence  of  tumors  and
reproductive problems of animals exposed to dioxins.

Dioxin Source Elimination

Greenpeace  is  calling  for  a  zero  dioxin  plan,  which  seeks  to
eliminate dioxin sources, not just reduce dioxin releases. Due
to the persistent nature of these chemicals, the current global

build-up  of  dioxins  will

take  years

The  elimination  of  dioxin  sources  will  have  both  positive
and  negative  economic  impacts  in  the  communities  where
sources  such  as  manufacturing  and  disposal  facilities  are
located.    To  mitigate  potentially  negative  economic  impacts,
transition planning processes must be an integral component
of  any  strategy  to  eliminate  dioxins.  This  process  must  be
guided  by  participation  from  labor,  community  and  other
stakeholders  and  should  seek  to  minimize  the  economic
effects of the transition and insure that costs and benefits are
equitably  distributed.  For  instance,  the  Oil,  Chemical,  and
Atomic Workers Union proposed a tax on chlorine and related
chemicals;  the  revenue  would  be  used  to  encourage
reinvestment  in  affected  communities  and  to  provide  income
p rotection,  continued  health  care,  and  meaningful
opportunities  for  higher  education  and  reemployment  for
workers and their families.

Taking Action
What You Can Do
1

Avoid buying vinyl/PVC and other chlorine-containing
products whenever possible, and reduce your overall use
of disposable products.

4

Contact manufacturers of consumer products and find out
if their products contain PVC or other chlorine-containing
materials.  Demand alternatives.

Avoid burning household trash.  It often contains chlorine-
containing materials, such as PVC, which create dioxins
when burned.

Call on President Bush to support the global POPs treaty,
which is scheduled to be finalized in May 2000, at the
Stockholm Convention, and also urge him to seek U.S.
Senate ratification.
