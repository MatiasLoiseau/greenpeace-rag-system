“Doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the ‘body of
fact’ [linking smoking with disease] that exists in the mind of the general public. It
is also the means of establishing a controversy...”

Tobacco company Brown and Williamson internal document, 19691

“Skepticism is not believing what someone tells you, investigating all the
information before coming to a conclusion. Skepticism is a good thing. Global
warming skepticism is not that. It’s the complete opposite of that. It’s coming
to a preconceived conclusion and cherry-picking the information that backs up
your opinion. Global warming skepticism isn’t skepticism at all.”

—John Cook of Skepticalscience.com2

intRoDuCtion
This report describes organized attacks on climate science, scientists and scientific institutions like the
UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the IPCC), that have gone on for more than 20 years. It
sets out some of the key moments in this campaign of climate denial started by the fossil fuel industry, and
traces them to their sources.

The tobacco industry’s misinformation and PR campaign in the US against regulation reached a peak just
as laws controlling tobacco were about to be introduced. Similarly, the campaign against climate change
science – and scientists – has intensified as global policy on climate change has become more likely. This
time though there is a difference. The corporate PR campaign has gone viral, spawning a denial movement
that is distributed, decentralised and largely immune to reasoned response.

This report updates our March 2010 report1, ahead of the forthcoming 2013 release of the IPCC’s Fifth
Assessment report.

The 2010 report was published just after the hysteria that greeted the release of climate scientists’ personal
email hacked or stolen from the University of East Anglia on the eve of the Copenhagen Climate Summit
in late 2009. This scandal showed the depth and sophistication of the climate denial movement and the
willingness of the media to amplify their message, despite its lack of evidence or scientific support – and to
be distracted from the urgency of the issue by unfounded attacks on leading research scientists.

Since 2009, there have been nine separate investigations into this so-called “scandal,” each of which have
exonerated the scientists at the centre of the accusations. Yet that hasn’t stopped the continued hysteria
around the scandals. There have been two more attempts at a “climategate” type scandal, releasing more
emails, with very little effect. Unfortunately, traditional media outlets failed to properly correct the misinforma-
tion they were so culpable in helping to spread.

With this new edition of Dealing In Doubt we:

•	 detail the ongoing attempts to attack the integrity of individual climate scientists and their work.

•

look beyond the strategic parallels between the tobacco industry’s campaign for
“Sound Science” (where they labeled mainstream science as “junk”) to the current
climate denial campaign, to new research that has come to light revealing the deeper
connections: the funding, personnel and institutions between the two policy fights.

•	 detail how some scientists are now fighting back and taking legal action.

•

•

showcase the Heartland Institute as an example of how tobacco-friendly free market think
tanks use a wide range of tactics to wage a campaign against the climate science.

reveal the range of tricks used by the denier campaign, from “pal review” instead of peer review,
to personal attacks on scientists through Freedom of Information requests, self-publishing
books, and the general conspiratorial noise from the denial machine in the blogosphere.

The majority of the front groups or free market think tanks running campaigns against climate science
continue to receive funding from big oil and energy interests.

DEALING indoubtDealing in Doubt Greenpeace USA, 2013 page 7

Since our first report, the massive campaign against climate science – and action on climate, funded by
oil barons the Koch Brothers has come to light. And while fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil, whose
very products are causing global warming, continue to fund think tanks driving the campaigns, much of the
foundation funding has now been driven underground, masked by a funding front-group called the Donors
Trust – and its associate Donors Capital Fund, two “donor-advised” funds created to hide the real givers and
thus shield them from negative exposure of their support for these campaigns.

Funding to the organizations that comprise the denial machine has risen during the Obama presidency, just
as the urgency of climate solutions and promise of policy advances also rose.

“The side that has been issuing these attacks are extremely well-funded, well-organized. They have
had an attack infrastructure of this sort for decades, developed it during the tobacco wars, they honed
it further … in further efforts to attack science that industry or other sceptical interests find inconve-
nient. So they have a very well honed, well-funded organized machine that they are bringing to bear in
their attack now against climate science.

“It’s literally like a marine in battle against a cub scout when it comes to the scientists defending
themselves… We’re not PR experts like they are, we’re not lawyers and lobbyists like they are. We’re
scientists, trained to do science.”—climate scientist Michael Mann: February 20102

Meanwhile the consensus – and evidence – continues to grow

None of the climate denial machine’s counter attack has changed the harsh reality, the scientific consensus,
that climate change is underway and it is caused by humanity’s pollution and other insults to the planet.

If there wasn’t already enough proof in the years of replicated scientific evidence, a May 2013 peer reviewed
study3 examined more than 11,000 climate change papers, and of the 4,000 papers that discussed whether
climate change was caused by humans, 97 percent agreed. On the other hand, the percentage of papers
challenging this consensus didn’t move – it had flatlined. This corroborated a similar finding in 2010 from the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

The IPCC scientific assessment is a rigorous and robust process, one of the biggest organized scientific
endeavours in the world, involving thousands of scientists in hundreds of research institutes around the
world, who assess and compile the findings of thousands of published and peer reviewed papers across a
wide range of topics, from the measurement of shrinking ice caps to oceans, clouds, temperature records
and observed impacts. It is also a human endeavour and therefore not perfect.

The very purpose of the IPCC itself, and its periodic assessments and reports, is to inform governments
participating in the UNFCCC process of the latest science in order to evaluate policy measures. Science
is indeed the engine that drives the policy train. Certainty adds urgency and should spur action. The coal,
oil and gas industries have always recognized this and have therefore strived for uncertainty to slow policy
advances.

One of the most fascinating aspects of the IPCC is that the work is done entirely voluntarily. For many of the
scientists involved, it’s the equivalent of having a second job, where you spend as much, if not more time on
it as your primary job, unpaid.

Greenpeace has, and continues to have, confidence in the IPCC. There is no more reliable guide to – and
summary of – the world’s climate science than the IPCC reports. If anything, due to the long lead-in time
for the IPCC reports, they err on the side of conservatism4. In late 2012, studies that compared the IPCC’s
predictions over 22 years of weather data showed that the organisation has consistently underplayed the
intensity of global warming in its reports. The denier campaigns against the IPCC consistently accuse it of
overplaying the science, but, if anything, it has underplayed it.

PaRt 1: a bRief histoRy of Denial
The 1990s: a network of denial is created
In the early 1990’s, as governments began negotiating a global agreement to tackle climate change, a
number of lobby groups were set up to prevent it.

These early groups included the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), the Climate Council and the Information
Council on the Environment (ICE). The GCC called itself an “organisation of business trade associations
and private companies established in 1989 to coordinate business participation in the scientific and policy
debate on global climate change”. Its membership was a list of the largest coal, oil and auto companies in
the US – representing, it said, 230,000 companies and all companies that would stand to lose if they were
held to account for the carbon they were pumping into the air for free.

The Climate Council staff included lobbyist heavyweight Don Pearlman a Washington, DC lawyer who
became the right hand man of the Saudi, Kuwait and Russian governments5. (Pearlman died in 2005).

ICE was formed by a group of utility and coal companies: the National Coal Association, the Western Fuels
Association and the Edison Electric Institute6. In 1991, according to journalist Ross Gelbspan ICE:

“launched a blatantly misleading campaign on climate change that had been designed by a public
relations firm…[that] clearly stated that the aim of the campaign was to ‘reposition global warming as
theory rather than fact’. Its plan specified that three of the so-called greenhouse sceptics – Robert
Balling, Pat Michaels and S Fred Singer – should be placed in broadcast appearances, op-ed pages
and newspaper interviews.”7

ICE prepared a series of newspaper ads, one of them headlined “If the earth is getting warmer, why is
Minneapolis getting colder?” Fox News anchors suggested that the massive snowstorms on the East Coast
of the US in early 2010 called into question the scientific consensus on global warming, comments that
climate scientists rejected.8 January 2010 turned out to be among the hottest on record.9

And the scientific evidence continues to mount. In August 2013, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration’s “State of the Climate” report, drawing on contributions from 384 scientists from 52 coun-
tries, outlined the latest set of records.

“Many of the events that made 2012 such an interesting year are part of the long-term trends we see
in a changing and varying climate — carbon levels are climbing, sea levels are rising, Arctic sea ice is
melting, and our planet as a whole is becoming a warmer place,” said its press release.

This network was constructed using money provided by fossil fuel companies. But there were a few compa-
nies who were central to this campaign.

The funders:
ExxonMobil

When this report was first written, everybody focused on, at that point, the most obvious funder of the
network of think tanks and front groups promoting climate denial: oil giant ExxonMobil, has spent $27.4
million supporting the climate denial movement between 1998 and 2012 [Appendix II page 62].

In 2008, after years of adverse publicity about its funding policies, ExxonMobil stopped its funding nine key
groups, claiming their:

“position on climate change diverted attention from the important discussion on how the world will
secure the energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner.”10

Exxon slowly scaled back its funding to the denial machine from a peak of $3.5 million in 2005 down to
$766,000 in 2012. Nonetheless, ExxonMobil continues to fund at least 12 groups campaigning against
climate science, according to its own tax documents and corporate reports.

It should be noted that, due to the anonymity of Donors Trust, the decline in Exxon’s direct
funding of the denial machine doesn’t necessarily mean there is not additional funding provided
by the company’s employees that is not transparently reported.

The Koch Brothers

In early 2010, a Greenpeace investigation revealed that it wasn’t just ExxonMobil funding
the climate denial machine. David and Charles Koch, of Koch Industries, who run the “big-
gest company you’ve never heard of,” have, through their company and family foundations,
funneled at least $67 million or more into the denial machine since 1997. The Kochs’ climate
denial campaign is just part of a 40-plus year history of financing, influencing and, in some
cases, leading a much broader conservative agenda.

The Koch focus has been on fighting environmental regulation, opposing clean
energy legislation, and easing limits on industrial pollution.

This Koch money is routinely funneled through one of “charitable” foundations the Kochs
have set up: the Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation; the Charles G. Koch Charitable
Foundation; and the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation and the less-known Knowledge
and Progress Fund, used only to funnel money to Donors.

Since our investigation, many different investigations have looked further into what has
become known as “The Kochtopus” – a massive network of funding tentacles that has spread across the
US, from state to Federal level, a multi-decadal campaign involving events from local legislation to national
decisions on pipelines, from funding for tenured professors at Universities to the potential purchase of major
newspapers.

DEALING indoubtDealing in Doubt Greenpeace USA, 2013 page 10

Perhaps most significantly, the Koch brothers set up Americans for Prosperity (with the tobacco industry –
see The roots of climate denial), that masterminded the so-called grassroots “Tea Party” movement that has
helped bring widespread climate denial into the heart of US republican politics.

Donors Trust & Donors Capital: The ATM of Climate Denial

In 2007, after Greenpeace attempted11 to get a Vermont Court to release a list of clients funding climate
denier Patrick Michaels’ company, “New Hope,’ the long-time denier made this comment in his [successful]
affadavit12 opposing the Greenpeace application:

“Large companies are understandably adverse to negative publicity. Thus, the global warming con-
troversy has created an environment in which companies who wish to support New Hope’s research
and advocacy about global warming science are increasingly willing to do so only if their support
remains confidential. For this reason, some companies that support New Hope financially do so on the
understanding that their support will not be made public.”

Only recently have the efforts of these big funders to hide that they’re spending money on climate denial
come to light. In January 2012, a detailed study of Heartland Institute and other think tanks found connec-
tions with two donor advised funds based in Alexandria, Virginia: Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund, set
up in 2002.13

After a climate scientist duped Heartland Institute into revealing its funders and plans in early 2012 (See case
study, Part 2), one of the discoveries was a large anonymous donor. The detailed study plus newly-revealed
internal plans were then combined to show Barre Seid14 as the major Heartland funder, using Donors.

Between them, from 2002 to 2011, Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund provided $146 million to more
than 100 groups, most of them running climate denial campaigns and many of them active in climate denial
since the 1990s.

The Koch Brothers and wealthy businessmen such as billionaire Barre Seid have funneled money through
these trusts, on whose boards sit well-known players in the climate denial campaign. It’s not just climate
denial, but they also fight health care and other issues that could curtail corporate profit, under the banner
of “freedom from Big Government”.

In October 2012, PBS/Frontline’s “Climate of Doubt” briefly mentioned Donors15.

In February 2013, The Guardian exposed these two organisations,16 based on a Greenpeace investigation17
on the Polluterwatch.com website and first outlined18 on DeSmogBlog in 2012. Donors Trust and Donors
Capital Fund don’t reveal who their funders are, advertizing and guaranteeing anonymity for their donors,
thus shielding the funders themselves from public anger.

Further stories revealed it wasn’t just secret funders in the US financing climate denial – there was a network
of wealthy businesspeople in the UK19 doing the same especially with the Global Warming Policy Foundation
(GWPF), well-linked with related entities in the US and Canada.20

The Players
Climate denial’s “continental army”

“There’s really only about 25 of us doing this. A core group of skeptics.
It’s a ragtag bunch, very Continental Army.”
—Steve Milloy talking to Popular Science, June, 201221.

The organizations funded by Exxon, the Kochs, Donors Trust and others support
a central team of spokespeople and strategists who set out to misinform the world
and deny the science of climate change. Their names frequently appear in the media
challenging the science of global warming: Fred Singer, Sallie Baliunas, Willie Soon,
Richard Lindzen, Patrick Michaels, Steve Milloy and many others.

Many forged a career out of denying environmental problems before climate change
became a public policy issue. Together, they form a network that is still, 25 years
later, challenging the climate science, no matter how much more work and how many
thousands of scientific papers have been written since.

Steve Milloy

Although widely discredited, many of these same, media-savvy individuals continue to
pollute the airwavs and travel all over the world casting doubt on well-established scientific facts.

Steve “The Junkman” Milloy, is the man who launched his corporate science denial career with The
Advancement of Sound Science Coalition, a Phillip Morris-funded front group formed to fend off the growing
scientific consensus of the links between secondhand tobacco smoke and health problems. But today there
are many more such celebrity deniers.

We have attempted to identify “continental army” — Appendix I page 61 for the list of around
30 of the key players in the more than 20 year campaign and links to their updated profiles on
DeSmogBlog.com or Polluterwatch.com

The think tanks
The denial machine today is run by a network of free market think thanks, largely based in the US, but with
outposts around the globe.

In Part 2 of this report, we case study The Heartland Institute as an example of how these think tanks and
front groups continue to operate with their corporate cash.

In Appendix II we set out a list of the free market think tanks currently being funded by Donors Trust and
Donors Capital Fund, and a tally of  ExxonMobil’s funding. We have a full breakdown of the ExxonMobil
funding and a pdf of Donors funding.

Another set of these groups could be seen in the membership of a coalition that has been around since the
late 90’s, set up and run by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Cooler Heads Coalition.

The roots of climate denial: borne out of Big
Tobacco anti science campaigns
The fossil fuel companies were not the original architects of the blueprint for deflecting blame and denying
responsibility

In March 2013 an academic study published in the journal Tobacco Control and funded by the National
Cancer Institute at the National Council of Health found that the notorious US “grassroots” organisation at
the centre of today’s climate denial campaign and dysfunctional political system, the Tea Party, was started
in 2002 by front groups closely who had been associated with – and funded – by Big Tobacco and the Koch
Brothers since the early 1980’s.

The reason? Big Tobacco was looking for support in its fight to stop regulation on secondhand smoke. This
diagram from the study shows the web of groups set up by the tobacco industry and their staff people,
many of whom ended up working for think thanks and front groups around today.

One key group set up by Phillip Morris and its PR firms APCO and Burson Marsteller was The Advancement
of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC), set up in 1993 to “promote sound science”. Steve Milloy, hired by
Phillip Morris at TASSC in 1997, is still involved in climate denial campaigns today.

Further investigation has revealed more links between Big Tobacco to climate denial than even this study
showed.

Take the efforts of Tom Borelli, who worked at Philip Morris throughout the 90’s and into the 2000’s, when
he took up a job as a coal lobbyist at FreedomWorks. (CSE later split into two groups: Freedomworks and
the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity).

In the early 1990’s, big tobacco had taken a major hit and its credibility was low. But the issue of second-
hand smoke was hot and smoking bans were being actively discussed across the US: a major threat to the
tobacco industry. Phillip Morris and its PR company APCO were setting up The Advancement of Sound
Science Coalition in Europe.

One of the objectives suggested in a memo from APCO to Philip Morris’s man in Europe, Matt Winakur, was
to link tobacco science to more “politically correct” issues, such as global warming, to make the tobacco
science look more mainstream.

The TASSC’s draft “scientific principles” were “too vague”, so APCO got Borelli to “review and tighten” them.
As Borelli confirmed to his boss: “The principals [sic] are intended to be a basis for policymakers to evaluate
scientific studies. The principles will also serve as a foundation for state legislative criteria to review the
scientific basis for new regulations.”

Climate and secondhandsmoke science denier Patrick Michaels pitched in to help with the final draft.

Borelli went on to set up both funding and PR links with the George C Marshall Institute and the Competitive
Enterprise Institute for their reports and work on challenging the science of climate change.

the histoRy of attaCks on the iPCC
1990—The IPCC’s First Assessment Report
During the final drafting of the IPCC’s First Scientific Assessment Report in 1990, Brian Flannery, Exxon’s
Chief Scientific Advisor and climate lobbyist, took issue with the recommendation for 60 to 80 percent cuts
in CO2 emissions, in light of what he suggested were “uncertainties” about the behavior of carbon in the
climate system.23 (In keeping with UN rules, the IPCC grants industry association members like ExxonMobil
“observer status” at its meetings, along with NGO’s).

Although the consensus of opinion remained against him, Flannery continued to demand that the IPCC
report’s Executive Summary state that the range of model results were “quite scientifically uncertain”24.
He was unsuccessful: the summary concluded that greenhouse gas emissions at present rates would
certainly lead to warming25.

This statement made the IPCC report a direct threat to business as usual in the fossil fuel sector. Having
failed to derail the IPCC from within, industry set out to discredit it. The attack focused on the IPCC’s
statement that it was “certain”.

In February 1992, at a press conference in New York during the negotiations that led to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the GCC used Fred Singer to attack the IPCC science, issuing
a briefing entitled “Stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions would have little environmental benefit,” 26 in which it
cited denier Professor Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Singer is a serial denier and has published little, if any, peer reviewed climate science in the last 20
years.27 He has spoken out as a scientific expert on subjects including secondhand smoke, acid
rain, ozone depletion, nuclear energy, pesticides, and the environmental impacts of nuclear war. 28
(see Appendix I: Climate denial’s “continental army”).

Throughout 1992 the GCC used well-known climate deniers like Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling29
and Fred Singer (all of whom have been partly funded by either Exxon or other energy companies
at one time or another) as ’experts’ at press conferences in its attempts to undermine the cred-
ibility of accepted climate science and the findings of the IPCC.30

The same year, Exxon’s Flannery was quoted by the World Coal Institute in a briefing for climate
negotiators: “because model-based projections are controversial, uncertain, and without confirma-
tion, scientists are divided in their opinion about the likelihood and consequences of climate
change.”31

In 1994 The GCC continued the attack on the IPCC when it hired a public relations firm to take
climate denier Dr. Sallie Baliunas32 on a media tour.

Baliunas is an expert in astrophysics, not climate. She built her denial career downplaying the significance
of the destruction of the ozone layer, publishing a report entitled “The Ozone Crisis” in 1994 for the George
C Marshall Institute33. Baliunas was, at the time, the chair of its Marshall Institute’s Science Advisory Board
while while its Board was chaired by pro-tobacco campaigner, now deceased Fred Seitz34 (see Appendix I).

By the late-90’s the GCC started to draw heavy criticism, and leading members like Ford Motor Company
quit the coalition and distanced themselves from its agenda. It was at this point that companies like Exxon
and Mobil (who eventually merge in 1999) turned to front groups and conservative think tanks that could
continue the campaign on their behalf following the same evolution of tobacco companies in moving from
obvious industry collectives to “independent” front groups.

1995 The Second Assessment Report (SAR)
When the IPCC released its Second Assessment Report (SAR) in 1995, it met a similarly aggressive
response. Among the key findings of the IPCC was the acknowledgement of a “discernable” human impact
on climate and a prediction that sea levels could rise 15 to 95 cm by 2100, in line with temperature increases
ranging from 1 °C to 3.5 °C (1.8 °F to 6.5 °F)35.

The SAR’s Summary for Policymakers contained the conclusion that, “The balance of evidence suggests a
discernible human influence on global climate.” That one sentence set the deniers on fire. One called it the
“most disturbing corruption of the peer-review process in 60 years.”36

Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, called the report “inflammatory” 37, while
oil-producing countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia tried to delay the report’s release because of this
“strong language”, and argued against the use of the words “appreciable,” “notable,” “measurable,” and
“detectable” in place of “discernable.” 38

The attacks weren’t restricted to the science or the report. In a sign of desperation, the deniers turned to
ad hominem attacks on key scientists were added as part of an escalating strategy of increasingly under-
handed and dirty tricks, a strategy that continues to this day (See case study, Part 2).

The GCC co-ordinated vicious personal attacks on Dr. Ben Santer, one of the key authors of the report. The
aim was to discredit the process by which the IPCC worked. This began a campaign of attacks on scientists
that continues to this day, some examples of which are outlined in Part 2 of this report.

Fred Singer meanwhile used the 1997 climate negotiations to launch an attack on the chair of the IPCC,
Bert Bolin. Following a debate at the talks, Singer fabricated quotes from Bolin, attempting to suggest that
he had changed his mind about climate change, saying: “Bolin remained adamant that there has been some
human influence on climate, but conceded that “man-made increases in temperature are so small as to be
barely detectable.”39

Bolin, the chair of both the World Meteorological Organization and the IPCC for nine years, was forced to
release a press statement politely rejecting the allegations as “inaccurate and misleading”. He said:

“Regarding Singer’s self-congratulatory statement that the ‘discussion appeared to go decidedly
against Dr. Bolin’s IPCC position,’ I had rather the impression that Dr. Singer’s views did not convince
those present.”40

“I find it most annoying that the account of the meeting in Stockholm has been presented in such a
biased manner.”41

1998: the American Petroleum Institute’s secret plan

In early 1998, a small group sat down together at the American Petroleum Institute42 in the US to draw
up a communications plan to challenge climate science. The group included representatives from Exxon,
Chevron, Southern Company (a large US coal-burning utility), the American Petroleum Institute and people
from a number of the front groups and conservative think tanks that are still campaigning against climate
science today, including the George C Marshall Institute, Frontiers of Freedom, The Advancement of Sound
Science Coalition and the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. All have received long-term funding from
ExxonMobil and other big polluters43.

The plan they drew up44 proposed:

“a national media relations programme to inform the media about uncertainties in climate science; to
generate national, regional and local media on the scientific uncertainties and thereby educate and
inform the public, stimulating them to raise questions with policymakers.”

The plan would roll out up to and beyond the UNFCCC meeting (COP4) later that year in Buenos Aires. The
plan’s milestones were:

“Victory will be achieved when

•	 Average citizens understand (recognize) uncertainties in climate science;
recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the ‘conventional wisdom’

•	 Media “understands” (recognizes) uncertainties in climate science

•	 Those promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extant

science appear to be out of touch with reality.”45

Part of the strategy was to co-ordinate ”a complete scientific critique of the IPCC research and its conclu-
sions’ and to enable decision makers to raise ‘such serious questions about the Kyoto treaty’s scientific
underpinnings that American policy makers not only will refuse to endorse it, they will seek to prevent
progress towards implementation at the Buenos Aires meeting in November, or through other ways”46

This would be achieved by recruiting and training five ‘independent’ scientists – ‘new faces… without a
long history of visibility in the climate debate’ to participate in media outreach. The API aimed to ‘maximize
the impact of scientific views consistent with ours, with Congress, the media and other key audiences’ and
admitted shamelessly that it would target teachers and students, in order to ‘begin to erect a barrier against
further efforts to impose Kyoto-like measures in the future.’47

Though this plan ended up being revealed on the front page of the New York Times, it is assumed that
ExxonMobil and others went ahead with essentially the same game plan starting in 1998. The education
section of it was taken up by various groups including the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) –
see part II of this report.

2001 – The Third Assessment Report (TAR)
In its Third Assessment Report released in 2001, the IPCC reported the consensus view on climate change,
including these key findings:

“Globally, it is very likely that the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year in the instru-
mental record, (1861–2000)48” and

“[M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in
greenhouse gas concentrations49” and

“Emissions of CO2 due to fossil fuel burning are virtually certain to be the dominant influence on the
trends in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century50.”

As with the first Assessment Report, the IPCC had to contend with the fossil fuel lobby even as it was being
written. In September 2001, the IPCC met in London to reach agreement on the final chapter and summary
of the TAR. The IPCC’s draft final report contained the following line: “The Earth’s climate system has
demonstrably changed on both global and regional scales since the pre-industrial era, with some of these
changes attributable to human activities51.”

At this meeting, ExxonMobil’s Brian Flannery suggested an amendment deleting the clause: “with some of
these changes attributable to human activities.” The IPCC ignored Exxon and kept the clause 52.

American Petroleum Institute – contracted analysis of TAR

In the summer of 2001, prior to the release of the IPCC TAR working group reports, the American Petroleum
Institute distributed an internal memo53, authored by oil industry employee Lenny Bernstein that laid out the
industry’s primary talking points for attacking the conclusions of the international science body.

Bernstein54 was well positioned to critique the Third Assessment Report, given that he was one of its lead
authors. His analysis coached the API membership on how to attack the IPCC report, laying out many of the
arguments that have been repeated since by deniers, industry and the Bush administration.

“The IPCC itself is made up of government representatives… The Summary for Policymakers… have a
much more political flavour,” he wrote. Never mind that the SPM is agreed by a consensus process that
produces a very conservative outcome.

Above all, Bernstein stressed the “uncertainty” argument, asserting that climate deniers can maintain the
appearance of an unsettled ‘debate’ on climate science by repeatedly referencing the ‘considerable uncer-
tainties’ involved in this ‘complex’ area of study.

Bernstein instructed the oil industry to point out the “beneficial effects” of increasing CO2 concentrations and
rising temperatures, which have led to “longer growing seasons in Europe55” and could “help feed a growing
world population56.”

American Enterprise Institute attacks the TAR

In a now common tactic, early copies of the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) were leaked long before
they were finalized and published, creating an opportunity for an early counterattack by the denial industry.
Kenneth Green at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research’s57 ($3.615 million from
ExxonMobil since 199858) was central to this strategy. Green wrote several articles over the year before the
TAR was released, attacking the models and labeling the process political.59

He wrote in 2001 that “IPCC, a political organization, produces the policy guidance documents that
dominate international policy discussions. The reports of the IPCC are portrayed as scientific documents.
Yet IPCC reports are outlined by governmental representatives … The process departs dramatically from
standard scientific methodology and publishing procedures. Document architects only selectively include
relevant studies. The peer review process is, at best, a fig leaf.”60

Green called the Summary for Policymakers a “derivative document” which condenses and expresses IPCC
findings “in a language suitable for moderately educated readers.”61

Writing in his role as Director of Environmental Programs for another front group, the Reason Public Policy
Institute62, Green summarized the key deniers’ strategy to attack the IPCC in an October 2000 briefing
report:63 – attack the models, attack the objectivity, claim that the IPCC is “political” rather than “scientific,
attack the data and attack the scientists.

Environmental Program at Reason Public Policy Institute. See map.

Green, is a widely-quoted ‘independent’ source on climate and energy in Washington.

More long time deniers attack the TAR

Green’s attack blueprint was echoed by deniers in – and outside – the media.

“The Summary for Policymakers… represents a consensus of government representatives
(many of whom are also their nations’ Kyoto representatives), rather than of scientists. The
resulting document has a strong tendency to disguise uncertainty, and conjures up some
scary scenarios for which there is no evidence.”— Richard Lindzen, op-ed, The Wall Street
Journal, June 11, 2001.67

The release of the Summary for Policy Makers “has everything to do with political spin and very
little to do with climate science,” said Myron Ebell, who runs the global warming program at the
Competitive Enterprise Institute.

The 18-page summary, said Ebell, “is not a fair or accurate summary of the IPCC’ s full Third
Assessment Report, which is over 1,000 pages long and which has not yet been released in final form.”68

Myron Ebell

2007 – the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)
At the end of 2007, the IPCC released the final document in its fourth assessment (AR4): the Synthesis
report. It confirmed and built on the previous reports, saying that the warming of the earth’s climate systems
was now “unequivocal69”

 “Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very
likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations. It is likely that there has
been significant anthropogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent (except
Antarctica)70.

It also noted:

“There is high agreement and much evidence that with current climate change mitigation policies
and related sustainable development practices, global GHG emissions will continue to grow over the
next few decades71.”

It also outlined and updated its “reasons for concern72” on the vulnerability of ecosystems to survive climate
change, risks of extreme weather events, costs of impacts and sea level rise.

Willie Soon’s pre-emptive attack on the AR4 report

In 2003, as the IPCC was beginning its process, setting up its meetings to outline the chapters of the
AR4, then Marshall Institute “senior scientist” Willie Soon73(employed at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics ), was already on their case. He wrote to74 several other career climate deniers, including Sallie
Baliunas and Delaware climatologist David Legates, and two ExxonMobil employees and collaborators, to
work out what they could do to undermine the report.

“I hope we can start discussing among ourselves to see what we can do to weaken the fourth assess-
ment report or to re-direct attention back to science,” he wrote.

It’s worth noting here that while deniers try to argue that the science is wrong, that they are just questioning
the science and NOT being political, in this case the AR4 report had yet to be written when the deniers were
already conspiring to take it down.

The American Enterprise Institute Offers Cash To Trash IPCC

In July 2006, six months ahead of the AR4 release, American Enterprise Institute climate deniers were gath-
ering forces to undermine it. In a letter75 leaked to the media76 the AEI was looking for accredited scientists
who might be willing to “review” the upcoming Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change.77

But their “review” had a pre-determined outcome.The AEI hoped to find a scientist – at a rate as high as
$10,000 for 10,000 words – whose review “thoughtfully explores the limitations of climate model outputs as
they pertain to the development of climate policy.”

The idea behind the recruitment drive seems to have been an effort to find academic scientists with a
low-profile or non-existent record of talking to the press about global warming. That way, the AEI would be
able to use an “unblemished” critic’s credentials to support their arguments.

The story hit the media at the time of the AR4’s first report release, in February 2007 78. Professor Steve
Schroeder of Texas A&M University turned down the offer. He told the Washington Post79 that he “worried
his contribution might have been published alongside ‘off-the-wall ideas’ questioning the existence of global
warming.”

The letter’s authors were the AEI’s chief climate lobbyists Kenneth Green80 and Steven F Hayward81. Both
have a long history of connections with a number of the front groups funded by industry. Hayward is a
Director of Donors Capital Fund.82

Launch of the denier’s ‘independent’ assessment

Three days after the first of the AR4’s four reports was released in Paris in 2006, the Fraser
Institute, a Canadian think tank, held a press conference in London, headed by its senior fellow,
economist Ross McKitrick83.

The Fraser Institute released its “Independent scientific assessment”, a document whose layout
bears a remarkable similarity to the IPCC documents. The Institute questions the models, and
questions the conclusions of the IPC. The document, written mostly by S Fred Singer, was later to
be called the “NIPCC” and taken up by the Heartland Institute (See case study, Part 2).

Unlike the IPCC, which receives funding only from the UN system and relies almost totally on
voluntary input from the majority of those who work on it. The Fraser Institute’s team of “experts”
included several paid scientists with direct connections with industry front groups and conserva-
tive think tanks, none of whom appear to have published any peer-reviewed articles on global
warming84

…And the usual suspects join in

The AR4 flushed out the denial “A list” who have been campaigning to undermine the science of
climate change since the early 1990’s. Ardent attacks materialized from Fred Singer85, Richard Lindzen,
Patrick Michaels and William O’Keefe and organisations like the George C Marshall Institute, the Cato
Institute (a think tank founded by the Koch Brothers and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

Fred Singer

S Fred Singer attacked the models, and the politics in an article in the New York Sun86.

The Competitive Enterprise Institute returned to another familiar theme:

“The Summary for Policymakers is designed to be a propaganda document that will promote global
warming alarmism. It is not written by the scientists who wrote the report, but by the governments that
belong to the IPCC87,” stated Marlo Lewis, a CEI lobbyist88.

The CEI had clearly been planning for the AR4 for some time. One of its key deniers, “senior fellow” and
attorney Christopher Horner89 (not a climate scientist), releasing his new book, “The Politically Incorrect
Guide to Global Warming and Environmentalism” – an all out attack on climate science – at a special event
at the Heritage Foundation on 15 February 2007,90 halfway throughout the year of AR4 chapter releases.

See more of this story, “NIPCC: Climate change reconsidered” on The NIPCC – or “Climate
Change Reconsidered” – or “Not the IPCC” under our Heartland Institute case study in Part 2 of
this report.

Climategate: No Scandal behind these gates (updated 2013)

“The very fact that Climategate was newsworthy is evidence that reporters hold scientists to a much
higher standard than they hold denialists, even if they won’t admit it in their quest to report a contro-
versy.”—Mark Boslough91 –Physicist at Sandia National Laboratories

In late 2009, just ahead of the crucial Copenhagen climate talks, hacked emails from the University of East
Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU) surfaced on the internet. These sparked a succession of climate
stories that found willing homes in the media, with the UK media providing the staging ground. The denial
machine repeated and publicized a succession of non-stories dug up in the stolen emails, convinced that
they had found evidence of either global conspiracy or scientific failure.

As this video92 explains, nothing in the emails stolen from the CRU did anything to call into question any
climate science. That didn’t stop deniers alleging that the whole edifice of climate science was crashing
down, they also claimed the leaks had brought to light a conspiracy of truly epic proportions – claims that
some of the media were all too willing to repeat.

A total of nine investigations have now exonerated the scientists named in the so-called Climategate “scan-
dal”. Skeptical Science has the list.

Even the deniers themselves admitted that the hacked emails didn’t bring the large body of climate science
into doubt. When questioned by the UK House of Lords Science and Technology Committee on 1 March
201093, climate deniers Lord Nigel Lawson and Benny Peiser, of the newly-formed UK front group, the
Global Warming Policy Foundation94 both admitted that, at worst, the emails revealed a problem with the
CRU’s process, but didn’t actually unravel any of the climate science.95

Neither Peiser nor Lawson are climate scientists, something Peiser admitted to the Committee, yet they
continued to use the emails to undermine the climate scientific consensus. Bob Ward of the London School
of Economics pointed out an error on the foundation’s website in a graph of 21st century temperature, but
was never corrected.

“While it is a relatively small error, it is the kind of discrepancy that many sceptics would be seizing
upon if it had been found on the website of the Climatic Research Unit” wrote Ward in a blog on the
Guardian website96.

On another occasion, former IPCC working group chair, Sir John Houghton, was misquoted by Benny
Peiser in The Observer97, who claimed Houghton had said: “Unless we announce disasters no one will
listen.” “[He] thereby attributed to me and the IPCC an attitude of hype and exaggeration. That quote from
me is without foundation. I have never said it or written it,” Houghton told the Observer98.

One of the scientists at the centre of the emails, Michael Mann, was repeatedly cleared of the deniers’
accusation ‘falsifying data”. For example, one international investigation by Penn State University where he is
the Director of the Earth System Science Center in the Meteorology Department, found:

“The internal inquiry has found that Mann did not “participate in, directly or indirectly, any actions with
an intent to suppress or to falsify data.”99

He was also cleared by the National Science Foundation (NSF).100

But that hasn’t stopped the deniers from constantly referring to Mann and the accusations in the emails.
The accusations continue to this day, and Mann is still fending off attacks through Freedom of Information
requests for his communications and in court (See Part 2 of this report).

IPCC references challenged

From the leaked emails, the deniers then moved on to link the CRU’s problems to their favourite target, the
IPCC. The UK media led the charge, fed by the now lively UK denial community.

The accusations centred around three different references in the IPCC. These points have been thoroughly
rebutted by climate scientists on the “RealClimate” blog. 101 In summary, two errors were found in the IPCC
report, the third allegation having been thoroughly discounted.

The 2800-page AR4 report contains around 18,000 references. The two incorrect references identi-
fied have rightfully pointed to a need for the IPCC to review the way its processes work, a review that
the IPCC has announced it is undertaking.

The IPCC’s decision to undertake an independent review into its processes102, was a welcome move,
but, as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said when he announced the review:

“Let me be clear: the threat posed by climate change is real. Nothing that has been alleged or
revealed in the media recently alters the fundamental scientific consensus on climate change.
Nor does it diminish the unique importance of the IPCC’s work.”103

The hacked emails helped the denial machine launch an all-out campaign in the UK and revitalized
the old guard in United States: Marc Morano of CFACT, Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and Senate
climate denier, Republican James Inhofe104.

Marc Morano

Inhofe has attempted to use the hacked emails and IPCC references to run ‘McCarthy-style’ ‘criminal
investigations’ on a list of seventeen of the world’s top climate scientists and lead authors in the IPCC.
He used the (non) scandals to question not only the IPCC’s conclusions, but also to challenge the
scientific basis of proposed new US EPA rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions105.

On February 16, 2010, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, along with Fred Singer, filed a lawsuit to the US
EPA,106 demanding that, on the basis of the hacked emails and so called “flawed datasets”, the EPA drop all
its proposed regulation on C02 and other greenhouse gases. It didn’t, but continues, more than three years
later to finalized these rules against heavy industry obstruction and objection.

November 2011, “Climategate 2.0”

Despite this comprehensive trouncing of their claims, the deniers tried a second round, calling it
“Climategate 2.0”, released just ahead of the Durban climate talks.

More than 39,000 emails107 to and from the University of East Anglia were released, again with phrases
taken out of context in an attempt to challenge the way some of the world’s best climate scientists under-
took their work. This time, the scientists were ready and rallied to defend their work. The “scandal” quickly
died away.

March 2013, Climategate 3.0

The final attempt to revive Climategate took place in March 2013, when a character called “Mr. FOIA” re-
leased the final tranche of the hacked emails. He also, for the first time, posted his thoughts online. CFACT’s
Ron Arnold has them here. If Climategate 2.0 had received little coverage, this third effort barely registered.

What happened to the investigation?

The identity of the team that controlled, coordinated and timed the email releases has yet to come to light –
and is now unlikely to.

In 2009, when the first Climategate release was launched the UK’s Norfolk Constabulary, the police force
nearest to the Climatic Research Unit at the East Anglia University, took up the investigation. They failed to
find any evidence of who stole the emails, who hacked the CRU server to get them – or who coordinated
their release via a Russian web server.

In 2012 the Norfolk Constabulary announced that they had closed the case, unsolved. Senior investigating
officer, Detective Superintendent Julian Gregory, said:

“ “Despite detailed and comprehensive enquiries, supported by experts in this field, the complex
nature of this investigation means that we do not have a realistic prospect of identifying the offender or
offenders and launching criminal proceedings within the time constraints imposed by law. The interna-
tional dimension of investigating the World Wide Web especially has proved extremely challenging.

“However, as a result of our enquiries, we can say that the data breach was the result of a sophisti-
cated and carefully orchestrated attack on the CRU’s data files, carried out remotely via the internet.
The offenders used methods common in unlawful internet activity to obstruct enquiries.”

However, the investigation appeared to have slowed down well before this announcement. A freedom of
Information request in 2011 showed that the police had spent a total of £5,649.09 on the case in the previ-
ous year, with the last record of spending being in February 2011.

The AR5, fifth assessment report: The cherry-picking begins
The IPCC process requires that draft versions of the report are circulated to reviewers.
These are clearly unfinished work product and not meant for distribution.

In December, 2012, the first of the denier leaks of the AR5 report was posted on the internet
by a blogger. It was picked up by two mouthpieces of the denial machine, bloggers Anthony
Watts and James Delingpole, who claimed one particular sentence was proof the IPCC had
finally decided the sun was influencing global warming.

Blaming the sun is a favourite memes of denier arguments, fueled by astrophysicist Willie
Soon, and one that has been thoroughly discounted. The AR5 leaked draft had itself
discounted the notion, but the bloggers had cherrypicked to the extreme.

In short, the deniers leaked half a paragraph and portrayed it as a new conclusion, com-
pletely ignoring the subsequent sentence that specifically ruled out their claim.

Scientist Steve Sherwood told DeSmogBlog108:

Anthony Watts

“The single sentence that this guy pulls out is simply paraphrasing an argument that has been put
forward by a few controversial papers … purporting significant cosmic-ray influences on climate. Its
existence in the draft is proof that we considered all peer-reviewed literature, including potentially
important papers that deviate from the herd. The rest of the paragraph from which he has lifted this
sentence, however, goes on to show that subsequent peer-reviewed literature has discredited the
assumptions and/or methodology of those papers, and failed to find any effect.”

Who’s an “expert reviewer”?

The IPCC process is very open. Anyone can register as a reviewer, and submit
comments on the drafts. But only the denial machine mechanics use this as a way of
beefing up their credentials. One prime example is Lord Christopher Monckton, who
often claims this title of “expert reviewer”. In late 2012 he also claimed the title of an
“appointed” expert reviewer for the forthcoming AR5 report.

The IPCC clarified the situation:109

“Anyone can register as an expert reviewer on the open online registration
systems set up by the working groups. All registrants that provide the information
requested and confirm their scientific expertise via a self-declaration of expertise
are accepted for participation in the review. They are invited to list publications,
but that is not a requirement and the section can be left blank when registering.
There is no appointment.”

the Denial MaChine goes global
The climate denial industry has expanded out of its hub in the United States into the international arena
over the past 20 years. It remains a largely English-speaking network, centred around the US, but has also
spread further into key countries targeted by the deniers and think tanks.

Australia: A climate denial front ‘down under’
With a massive coal and mining industry backing him, Australian Prime Minister John Howard’s government
was the perfect breeding ground for climate denial. This was recognised by the Competitive Enterprise
Institute (CEI) in 1996, which began strategising to develop the Australian arm of their campaign.

In November 1996 a strategy meeting was held at the CEI in Washington that would begin to cement the
cross-pollination of people and ideas between Australia and the US110. At the meeting, RJ Smith from the
CEI argued that it was clear that “Australia if possible would be a key player in this”, so the CEI decided to
hold a conference111.

The CEI112 is a Libertarian anti-regulation “free market” think tank based in the USA. For many years it has
attacked global warming science and received more than $2 million in funding from Exxon since 1998. The
CEI coordinates the “Cooler Heads Coalition” and the website http://www.globalwarming.org. It is perhaps
best known for its bizarre “CO2 is life” advertisements113 in 2006. Shortly after these ads, ExxonMobil
dropped its funding, under pressure from, among others, the UK Royal Society114.

Interviewed by Bob Burton in 1997 Smith said: “Early last winter, right after Tim Wirth of the US State
Department announced they were going to call for mandatory controls in Kyoto, we said what do we do?
How do we stop this?”115 The CEI’s RJ Smith met Ray Evans of Australia’s Western Mining Corporation
(WMC), and the two began planning.

They held a conference in Washington in 1997, and several key deniers were in attendance, along with
the Australians. According to PR Watch it “offered blanket dismissals of the scientific evidence for climate
change and predicted staggering economic costs for any policies aimed at restricting emissions116.”
Australian Embassy Chief of Mission Paul O’Sullivan, gave the address.

In August 1997, the CEI and the anti-regulatory organization, Frontiers of Freedom sponsored another
Australian conference, this time in Canberra, along with the Australian and New Zealand Chambers of
Commerce and the WMC. Ray Evans and WMC’s Managing Director Hugh Morgan played a significant
role at the conference, and attendees included the Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer and
Environment Minister Robert Hill. Fisher claimed that tough emission reduction targets could put 90,000
jobs at risk in Australia and cost more than $150 million117.

Speakers included American climate denier Patrick Michaels, climate denier politicians, Rep. John Dingell118,
Senator Chuck Hagel and Richard Lawson (President and Chief Executive Officer of the US National Mining
Association and present at the earlier CEI meeting).

According to RJ Smith from the CEI, the purpose of the Canberra conference was to “try and buck [Prime
Minister John Howard] up a little more and let him know that there is support of the American people” for his
government’s obstructionist stance.”119 Later that year, an Australian at the CEI, Hugh Morley, noted on the
CEI’s website that “If Australia sticks to its gun (sic), there might not be a Kyoto treaty after all120.”

2013 Australia update

Fast forward to today and Australian denial remains a major force, not least in response to the
demise of Howard and moves by the Labor Government to introduce a carbon price, coupled
with a massive growth in the coal sector, and a largely climate denying opposition.

A think tank that has been at the centre of Australian denial since the outset is the Institute of
Public Affairs, a major sponsor to a Heartland Institute conference in Sydney in 2010. The IPA
doesn’t reveal its funding, but has admitted in the past that it comes from its corporate mem-
bers. A recent story in The Age revealed that the IPA’s anti-climate stance has lost it corporate
membership in recent years, and the stated that the IPA has received funding through mining
billionaire Gina Rinehart’s organisation, ANDEV.

Some of Australia’s key deniers enjoy international attention, not least Bob Carter, who is one of
the lead authors of the Heartland Institute’s NIPCC, and has admitted that he receives money
from Heartland. Carter is associated with a number of international think tanks at the heart of
the denial machine. Alongside Dr Carter is Ian Plimer, a geologist who is a director of several of
Gina Rinehart’s mining companies and who owns shares in a number of others.

Bob Carter

In response to Australia moving forward on climate policy, a number of denier think tanks, blogs and organ-
isations have sprung up, including the Galileo Movement, and the Australian Climate Science Coalition and
blogs like Australian Climate Madness.

In 2009, one man, Tim Andrews, then of the Australian Liberal Students Federation went to the US to
train with Grover Norquist’s American’s for Tax Reform and the Koch Foundation internship programme.
He gained insights from Koch mastermind Rich Fink, and returned to Australia to set up, run or become
heavily involved in, a veritable feast of think tanks and organisations, most of which aimed their wrath at the
Australian Government’s climate change programme, including Menzies House, the Australian Taxpayers
Alliance, (ATA – formed in 2000) the Australian Libertarian Society and StopGillardsClimateTax.com

The Cato Institute’s Patrick Michaels is on the advisory board of the ATA and was a science advisor to Stop
Gillard’s Climate Tax. The Galileo Movement lists a string of international deniers on their “independent
advisory panel” including Michaels, Singer, Lindzen and Lord Monckton.

UK denier Lord Monckton121 has undertaken no less than three tours of the country, in 2010, 2011 and 2013.
His 2010 tour was partly funded by coal billionaire Gina Rinehart, who, with the Association of Mining and

is the electricity industry

Exploration Companies, also funded part of his 2011 tour. In 2011, Monckton arrived in the country having
to apologise to the Government’s Climate Change advisor, Professor Ross Garnaut, for, in a US presenta-
tion, labelling him a fascist and linking his image with a swastika. Funding for his 2013 tour was channelled
through the newly established Lord Monckton Foundation, which doesn’t list its funders. During the tour he
launched a far right political party.

The country has been peppered with visits by other deniers, including Czech President Vaclav Klaus,
(IPA-sponsored, 2011), UK Telegraph blogger James Delingpole (promoting his book, 2012), head of UK
denier organisation the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Lord Nigel Lawson, 2011 (courtesy of right wing
paper, The Spectator, edited by the IPA’s Tom Switzer), and author of a book trashing the IPCC, Donna
Laframboise (2012,courtesy of the IPA), the Heartland Institute’s Jay Lehr (2009, Australia Climate Science
coalition) and blogger Anthony Watts (2010, Climate Sceptics party).

Australian now has five minor political parties who include climate denial in their policy profiles: The Climate
Sceptics Party, Rise Up Australia (launched with Lord Monckton in 2013, and whose leader, Daniel Nalliah,
said the 2009 “Black Saturday” bushfires in Victoria were God’s retribution for that State’s abortion laws),
One Nation, Democratic Labour Party (with one State Senator) and Family First.

Australia’s media landscape has played a leading role in spreading misinformation on climate change,
climate science, the role of climate scientists and the impacts of policies to reduce emissions.

In the Murdoch-owned News Ltd stable, influential political writer and prolific blogger Andrew Bolt liberally
spreads climate science denial on his blog and in his syndicated column. He also regularly invites climate
sceptics onto his Sunday morning television show The Bolt Report, where he regularly launches attacks on
climate science.

News Ltd owns the vast bulk of the popular metropolitan press in Australia. Other News Ltd columnists
sceptical of human-caused climate change include Janet Albrechtsen, Miranda Devine, Tim Blair, Piers
Akerman and business editor Terry McCrann (who claims to reach a bigger audience than any other
Australian columnist).

News Ltd’s The Australian, the country’s only national daily newspaper, regularly runs op-eds from climate
science deniers, including Lord Monckton, Lord Lawson, Matt Ridley, James Delingpole, Bjorn Lomborg
and Bob Carter and prints texts lifted directly from the Global Warming Policy Foundation website.

Editor of The Australian edition of The Spectator, Tom Switzer, is an IPA fellow.

An analysis of The Australian’s climate coverage by academic Professor Robert Manne found that news
stories arguing for action on climate change were outnumbered four-to-one by others rejecting action. In the
opinion pages, climate sceptic writers outnumbered recognised climate science experts 10-to-one.

On radio, Sydney’s most popular shock-jock Alan Jones of 4GB dismisses the science of human-caused
climate change as “witchcraft”. Jones is patron of the denial group the Galileo Movement.

New Zealand: deniers attempt to sue over temperature records
New Zealand has its own set of climate deniers, tied in with Australia and a global network, thanks to the
New Zealand Climate Science Coalition122, started in 2005. On the NZCSC board of advisors is Australia’s
Bob Carter, one of the main authors of the Heartland Institute’s so-called NIPCC.

122  http://nzclimatescience.net/

DEALING indoubtDealing in Doubt Greenpeace USA, 2013 page 29

Bryan Leyland admitted he was paid by the Heartland Institute123 to go to the climate talks in Bali in 2007,
where he joined the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow team124 in trying to challenge the science (they
were largely ignored).

In 2010, members of the NZCSC set up the NZ Climate Science Education trust to sue125 the National
Institute of Water and Atmosphere for their “series 7” set of temperature records, arguing along the same
lines as many deniers to: that the stations where temperatures are taken were somehow not measuring
temperatures accurately.

They lost their case126 in the High Court. The judge, Justice Venning, was vitriolic in his judgment, dismissing
Dunleavy’s evidence about the climate science because he was unqualified to give such evidence:

“Section 25 could only apply if Mr Dunleavy was an expert in the particular area of the science of
meteorology and/or climate. He is not. He has no applicable qualifications. His interest in the area does
not sufficiently qualify him as an expert.”

Scientist teaches climate denial at Auckland University

Chris de Freitas, who was the editor at Climate Research who published the critique of Michael Mann’s
Hockey Stick study, teaches a first year Geography class at Auckland University’s school of environment.

In 2011 an investigation by the New Zealand Herald found that de Freitas was teaching climate denial127 in
his class, using graphs that had only previously been seen in presentations by Lord Christopher Monckton.
The same investigation found128 that he had provided similarly sceptic scientific information to students at
the university’s school of public health.

The UK’s denial machine
Deniers in the UK have made repeated efforts over the years to undermine the scientific consensus and go
after the scientists. Indeed, the whole “climategate” affair was focused on a UK university.

The links between UK and US climate denial go back to the early 90’s, with the Atlas Economic Research
Foundation, the UK branch of a US front group that funnels US money into the UK and across the world. For
example, Atlas has received a combined total of more than $600,000 from Donors Capital Fund and Donors
Trust and more than $1m from ExxonMobil 1998–2009.

Atlas was working to help the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a leading UK conservative think tank. In
2001, Atlas UK changed its name to the International Policy Network, holding its first meetings at the IEA,
and with its original address based at the IEA.

The IPN’s main directors were Roger Bate and Julian Morris, who ran the IEA’s environment unit for at least
two years after the IPN was established. Chair of the board was Linda Whetsone who remains on the IEA
board to this day.

Bate and Morris had previously campaigned in support of Genetically Engineered organisms and soon
launched themselves into a “sound science” campaign and began questioning the science of global
warming.

In 1994 Bate co-founded the European Science and Environment Forum. This was exactly the same time
Philip Morris was setting up The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition in Europe. TASSC Europe didn’t
eventuate, but ESEF was established at exactly the same time, working on the same issues. Bate was
also connected with the US think tanks the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow and the Competitive
Enterprise Institute.

Morris has spoken at several Heartland Institute conferences and is an advisor to the International Climate
Science Coalition. In the late 1990’s he was a contributor to the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

In 2001 the IPN set up its North America branch, and became the direct recipient of ExxonMobil Foundation
contributions ($390,000 between 2001 and 2006).

UK denial today

Today, the main denial organization in the UK is the Global Warming Policy Foundation. While the GWPF has
always been very careful to avoid saying who its funders are, in March, 2012, The Guardian revealed one of
its major funders was Australian financier, major Conservative Party funder – and trustee of the IEA, Michael
Hintze.

Bloggers like James Delingpole (The Telegraph newspaper) lead UK denial, along with a handful of other
media figures such as the Daily Mail’s Melanie Phillips. A new voice of denial is Matt Ridley, a columnist for
The Times, who has written two books for the Institute of Economic Affairs: Down to Earth: A Contrarian
View of Environmental Problems, and Down to Earth II: Combating Environmental Myths. In 1995, the IEA
described Ridley as, “one of a number of environmentalists who are seeking to counter the inaccurate and
misleading opinions of ‘mainstream environmentalism’.”

Guardian columnist George Monbiot criticised Ridley’s economic libertarian views in a Guardian column in
2007. In particular, Monbiot contrasted Ridley’s libertarianism with his role at Northern Rock bank, which
was rescued from collapse by government intervention.

Their efforts have been rejected by the UK’s Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Ed Davey,
who slammed deniers and the media who gave them a platform, in a June 2013 speech:

“But some sections of the press are giving an uncritical campaigning platform to individuals and lobby
groups who reject outright the fact that climate change is a result of human activity. Some who even
deny the reality of climate change itself. This is not the serious science of challenging, checking and
probing.This is destructive and loudly clamouring scepticism born of vested interest, nimbyism, public-
ity seeking contraversialism or sheer blinkered, dogmatic, political bloody-mindedness.”

However, the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson’s views remain skeptical, a reflection of a faction in the
UK Conservative Party that perhaps listens to the GWPF’s Lord Lawson.

Lastly, in the UK, there is the UK Independence Party’s Lord Christopher Monckton, whose climate denial
has gained him few ears in the UK. He spends some time each year taking his climate denial to the US and
Australia, with a lot less focus in the UK.

DEALING indoubtDealing in Doubt Greenpeace USA, 2013 page 31

IPN and ATLAS take denial global
One prominent fellow of the International Policy Network was Kendra Okonski, who previously worked at the
Competitive Enterprise Institute.

Okonski set up a number of front groups across the developing world, some of which are still operating.
Okonski registered the websites for the following organizations:

IREN, Kenya

IPPA, Nigeria (the IEA’s Linda Whetstone is on their board)

Liberty Institute, India (appears to be defunct as of around 2006)

The Alternate Solutions Institute, Pakistan

The Atlas Foundation for Economic Research is today still coordinating a global network of libertarian think
tanks, most of who run campaigns based on “freedom”.

But there appears to be little taste for climate denial in most developing countries, as they face the begin-
nings of the effects of climate change.

Denial in Eastern Europe
Climate denial is still alive and well in Eastern Europe, where the EU member states are fighting to protect
their coal industry and are the laggards within the EU, holding it back from moving forward on climate
action.

Eastern Europe’s chief denier is Czech President Vaclav Klaus, who regularly travels around the world,
entertained by various front groups and is often quoted by deniers like Christopher Monckton and Anthony
Watts. He has also spoken at a number of Heartland Institue climate conferences.

In 2011, Poland’s EU Budget Commissioner, Janusz Lewandowski, told a Polish newspaper: “The thesis that
coal energy is the main cause of global warming is highly questionable…. Moreover, more and more, there is
a question mark put over the whole ‘global warming’ as such.”

PaRt 2: DenieR tRiCks anD taCtiCs
It is important to distinguish clearly between those scientists who have challenged the theories of global
warming in good faith, seeking to put forward other possible explanations for our changing climate, and the
efforts of the denier campaign to undermine the credibility of the scientific establishment.

Arguments about sunspots, the earth’s rotation about the sun, the accuracy of temperature measurements,
the likely severity of global warming and other theories have all played out over the last 20 years through the
scientific literature. The IPCC’s conclusions reflect the fact that the only remaining theory, supported by the
evidence, is that global warming is caused by emissions of greenhouse gases, and that human activity is
therefore responsible.

The IPCC consensus is now upwards of 95 percent certainty on this point, enough to convince the National
Academies of Science across the world, all major scientific institutions and even the US military.

In contrast, a handful of scientists supported by the denial machine have sought to muddy the waters of
the political debate through interventions in the academic literature. The denier campaign has consistently
sought to present its publications and claims in the style of genuine science, tactics modeled after Big
Tobacco.

This effort again is aimed at delaying action. Uncertainty and “doubt”, especially in the media and minds of
non-expert policymakers, is the objective.

Part 2 of this report documents instances of this, and we focus on the tricks pulled by one think tank, The
Heartland Institute, as an example of the kinds of tactics used.

We look at examples of scientists who have come under sustained personal attack for nothing more than
reporting their results, and the new campaign tactics that have sprung up since “Climategate” to intimidate
leading scientists and discredit their work.

We also look at the effect of these campaigns, especially on the political system in the US, with the rise of
the Tea Party.

Case study: The Heartland Institute: a clearing
house of climate denial campaign tactics
If we were to focus on one think tank that has been a leader in the campaign against climate science in
recent years, deploying the variety of tricks most other think tanks and individuals also use in climate denial
campaigns, it would be the Heartland Institute.

The Heartland Institute is a Chicago-based “free market” think tank and 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
that has become a hub for the network of individuals and organizations denying the scientific evidence for
man-made climate change.

The Heartland Institute has received:

•	 at least $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998, (but was dropped by Exxon in 2007)

•	 $14,498,497 from the combination of the Donors Trust and Donors Capital

In the 1990s, the Heartland Institute worked with tobacco giant Philip Morris to question the
science linking second-hand smoke to health risks, and lobbied against government public health
reforms around tobacco. Philip Morris executive Roy Marden was on Heartland’s board129, it
funded the think tank130, and CEO Joseph Bast had been a long-time campaigner on the issue.

Bast set out his views on climate change in 2003, in a list of “eight reasons why global warming
is a scam”, including statements like “Most scientists do not believe human activities threaten to
disrupt the Earth’s climate” and “The IPCC did not prove that human activities are causing global
warming,” before moving on to say that “Efforts to quickly reduce human greenhouse gas emis-
sions would be costlyand would not stop Earth’s climate from changing.”

Heartland continues to maintain a “Smoker’s Lounge131” section of their website which brings
together their policy studies, Op-Eds, essays, and other documents that purport to “[cut] through
the propaganda and exaggeration of anti-smoking groups.”

Heartland’s internal workings exposed

Joseph Bast

In February 2012 a series of internal Heartland Institute documents came to light132 that exposed Heartland’s
inner workings.

These documents make it clear how Heartland funding increased rapidly as it became a hub organization
of the climate denial machine. Heartland was heavily funded by an “anonymous donor” 133 , later found to be
Barre Seid.

The documents also revealed:,

•	 Heartland was planning a roll-out134 of climate denial education tools for schools across the US

•	 a fundraising strategy135 that discussed plans to appeal to the Koch brothers for funding, as well
as a major “anonymous donor” funding their campaigns [the Kochs later rejected this – they
weren’t funding Heartland for climate denial, but to attack Obama’s health care plans]

•	 Heartland was paying climate denier scientists136 across the world to work on its
“NIPCC”137 The NIPCC – or “Climate Change Reconsidered” – or “Not the IPCC”

•	 Heartland was also funding one of the most vocal denial blogs: WattsUpWithThat.

com’s Anthony Watts for his work on temperature records.

Heartland did its best to deflect the leaked documents by cooking up a “fakegate”138 scandal around the
leaker, scientist Peter Gleick, who had been in a contentious ‘discussion’ with staff at Heartland and then
duped them into emailing him their documents which he forwarded to bloggers. While Heartland tried
to argue139 that one of the documents was forged, experts disagreed.140 Many of the facts present in the
contested document are replicated in other internal Heartland documents.

Heartland’s Fake Scientific Conferences and the Unabomber

Following on from the leak debacle, and in an effort to claim back some credibility, Heartland decided
it would host another of the eight “scientific” conferences it has held since 2008 with the “anonymous
donor’s” money, the International Conference on Climate Change141 (ICCC). It was to be the eighth and final
of these conferences and CEO Joseph Bast would, by the end of it, announce that he would hold no more,
after the furore caused by his advertising campaign.

As part of the build-up to the conference, Heartland ran the first of what was to be a series of digital
billboards that was to repel many of its corporate funders. Over a tagline of I believe in global warming, do
you?” the billboard featured a photo of Ted Kaczynski, the “Unabomber”142, a recluse who had waged a
17-year mail bombing campaign across the US.

Heartland’s press release143 revealed its next billboards would feature Charles Manson and Fidel Castro and
Bin Laden. Bast initially pumped up and tried to defend the billboards, but was later to drop them and claim
they were an experiment. 144

Bast never apologized. In the wake of the backlash around the billboard, Heartland’s backers dropped their
funding145 in droves, causing the closure146 and spinoff of an entire program, Heartland’s Center on Finance,
Insurance and Real Estate147 in Washington.

The funders continued to drop out all year, culminating in pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in December, 2012,
also walking away from Heartland148. In total, Heartland didn’t receive at least $1.3 million of its prospective
funding from corporations in 2013.

The Origin of the ICCC

March 2008 was the first of Heartland’s “scientific” conferences, held in a Times Square hotel in New York
for effect. They were offering $1000 to anyone who wanted to speak at it.149

The climate scientists at RealClimate, some of whom were invited, posted a blog entitled “What if you held a
conference and no (real) scientists came?150”

“Normal scientific conferences have the goal of discussing ideas and data in order to advance
scientific understanding. Not this one. The organizers are surprisingly open about this in their invitation
letter151 to prospective speakers, which states:

“The purpose of the conference is to generate international media attention to the fact that many
scientists believe forecasts of rapid warming and catastrophic events are not supported by sound
science, and that expensive campaigns to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are not necessary or
cost-effective.”

RealClimate concluded: “So this conference is not aimed at understanding, it is a PR event aimed at gener-
ating media reports.”

The conference was attended by hundreds of people but, as Andrew Revkin noted in the New York
Times152: “The meeting was largely framed around science, but after the luncheon, when an organizer made
an announcement asking all of the scientists in the large hall to move to the front for a group picture, 19 men
did so.”

The Times also pointed out that the keynote denier scientist participants were out of synch,

“One challenge they faced was that even within their own ranks, the group — among them govern-
ment and university scientists, antiregulatory campaigners and Congressional staff members —
displayed a dizzying range of ideas on what was, or was not, influencing climate.”

ABC news’s coverage153 of the event included an interview with career climate denier Fred Singer, who
admitted during the interview that he had once received an unsolicited grant from ExxonMobil for $10,000.
The story created a storm of rage from the denier blogosphere, with Heartland and the other sponsors of
the conference putting enormous pressure on the broadcaster who refused to retract the story.

Heartland has now held eight conferences154, in New York (1,2), Washington (3,6), Chicago (4,7), Sydney (5)
and Munich(8) and dubbed ‘Denial-Palooza’ by Greenpeace. None of the speakers have come out with any
conclusion other than the premise of the conference they set out to “prove” – that “global warming isn’t a
crisis/isn’t happening.” Heartland was found to have been funding related groups in New Zealand, Canada
and likely Australia.155

The NIPCC 156 – or “Climate Change Reconsidered” – or “Not the IPCC”

The “Non-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change” was a project begun in 2003 ahead of the AR4 by
S Fred Singer and his organization, the Science and Environment Policy Project. The Heartland Institute
jumped in soon after, and published the first iteration of this report, to very little media response, in Paris in
April 2008157, followed by a full version released at one of its conferences, in New York 2009.

Skeptical science158 points out all the ways the NIPCC is different from the IPCC:

•

Its purpose is not to give clarity on climate science, as the IPCC does, but to
critique the IPCC, according to the Heartland leaked documents

•	 The scientists working for the NIPCC get paid; the IPCC scientists don’t

•	 The NIPCC report only critiques papers published by deniers, whereas the

IPCC critiques all papers, including those published by deniers.

One document in the Heartland leaks outlined the list of deniers being paid for their work on the NIPCC.
They included Craig Idso, Fred Singer, Bob Carter, Willie Soon, Robert Balling and Joe D’Aleo.

2013 NIPCC in China – or: Let not the truth get in the way of a good story

In June 2013, Heartland announced it was to launch the new NIPCC in China, and, to great fanfare, that the
report had been “published” by the prestigious Chinese Academy of Science. Except it hadn’t. The CAS
pointed this out very clearly in a series of press statements.

President Joe Bast was quoted in a Heartland release as saying “This is a historic moment in the
global debate about global warming.” Except it wasn’t. Heartland quickly took the statements
down off its website and walked back from its original statements, but not before some bloggers
had saved the text. DeSmogBlog has the full story.159

NIPCC “lead author” Craig Idso, Bob Carter and S Fred Singer went to China with Bast for an
event, which gained little traction in China.

Heartland is now expected to launch its next iteration of the NIPCC in September 2013160, ahead
of the release of the IPCC’s AR5 report.

Heartland, ALEC and the attack on science education

Also revealed in the 2012 leaks of internal Heartland Institute documents was a fundraising docu-
ment161 outlining a strategy to get climate denial taught in the US K-12 classroom curricula. The
person they wanted to pay $100,000 to do this was US Department of Energy (DOE) official David
Wojick162, a long-time climate denier who runs the Climatechangedebate.org listserve and used to
work with the Greening Earth Society.

Craig Idso

The Heartland fundraising plan spelt out how:

“Principals and teachers are heavily biased toward the alarmist perspective.”

The plan went on to say:

“Dr. Wojick proposes to begin work on “modules” for grades 10–12 on climate change (“whether
humans are changing the climate is a major scientific controversy”), climate models (“models are
used to explore various hypotheses about how climate works. Their reliability is controversial”), and air
pollution (“whether CO2 is a pollutant is controversial. It is the global food supply and natural emissions
are 20 times higher than human emissions”)

Heartland’s documents list David Wojick’s credentials: “a Ph.D in the philosophy of science and mathemati-
cal logic from the University of Pittsburgh, and a B.S. in civil engineering from Carnegie Tech.” Wojick’s does
not carry any degrees in the natural sciences nor has he published any peer-reviewed research in the field of
climate science, according to DeSmogBlog163.

More on David Wojick’s climate denial work for Heartland can be found in the Washington Post164.

The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) pushes US
state laws mandating climate denial in schools:

The Heartland Institute’s work to make US students doubt the scientific evidence of global warming has
been ongoing for over a decade. In addition to mailing books and promotional material that dismiss climate
change to teachers across the United States, Heartland has worked with the American Legislative Exchange
Council (ALEC) to pass state laws that create additional barriers for teachers wishing to give their students
an accurate overview of climate change.

ALEC’s model state bill, the “Environmental Literacy Improvement Act,” requires a false “balance” in deciding
which textbooks and other materials can be used to teach students about climate change. The bill forces
materials to be vetted by a “Council” of people who, most notably, are not allowed to have any credentials in
“environmental science.” See DeSmogBlog165 and PolluterWatch166 for more on the creation of ALEC’s bill.

Between ALEC and the Discovery Institute167 (which also promotes laws to deny evolution and include
creationism in school curricula), at least 12 US states have seen legislative attempts to weaken the scientific
rigor of climate change education.

At least four states passed laws (Tennessee, Texas, South Dakota, Louisiana) weakening teachers’ ability to
accurately present climate change science to their students.

One key denier links Heartland and ALEC: Sandy Liddy Bourne, the daughter of convicted Watergate
co-conspirator, G. Gordon Liddy. Alexandra “Sandy” Liddy Bourne ran a now-defunct oil industry front
group called the American Energy Freedom Center with former ExxonMobil lobbyist Randy Randol. Bourne
was a Heartland senior fellow for environmental issues and formerly Heartland’s vice president for policy
and strategy. Prior to joining the Heartland Institute, Sandy Liddy Bourne was ALEC’s Director of the Energy,
Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Task Force for the from 1999–2004, before being promoted
to Director of Legislation and Policy, where she oversaw all of ALEC’s task forces and helped boost state
enactment of ALEC’s corporate bills from 11 percent to 20 percent of 50 states. In Bourne’s time directing
ALEC’s environmental task force, the “Environmental Literacy Improvement Act” was created and approved
by ALEC’s board in June, 2000.

ALEC Funding:

ALEC has been around for 40 years, and claims that two thirds of all US state level political representa-
tives are members, both Republican and Democrates. But it’s not the politicians who fund ALEC, it’s the
corporations.

According to the Center for Media and Democracy168, which runs the website ALEC Exposed169, “Almost
98% of ALEC’s cash 170 is from sources other than legislative dues, such as corporations, trade associa-
tions, and foundations.” Major foundations supporting ALEC include the Charles G. Koch Foundation, the
Lynde & Harry Bradley Foundation, the Searle Freedom Trust and the Castle Rock Foundation.

ALEC’s due-paying member companies involved in ALEC’s Energy, Environment and Agriculture task
force171 include major oil, gas, coal, nuclear and chemical interests such as Koch Industries, ExxonMobil,
Chevron, BP, Shell, the American Petroleum Institute, Duke Energy, American Electric Power, Peabody
Energy, the Edison Electric Institute, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, CropLife America,
Dow Agrosciences, and the American Chemistry Council.

The State Policy Network: an Umbrella of Climate Change Denial

ALEC and the Heartland Institute are officially affiliated through an umbrella network of corporate-funded US
front groups known as the State Policy Network, or SPN. SPN helps coordinate political issue campaigns
and fundraising outreach between large companies and corporate foundations, SPN’s 59172 state-based
members173 (like ALEC and Heartland), and its national affiliates, like the Koch Industries-affiliated Americans
for Prosperity, the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. At least 34 Koch-funded
SPN members and affiliates are involved in the multifaceted campaigns to create public doubt over climate
change in the USA. From 2002–2010, SPN was the eighth-highest recipient from Donors.

Attacks on scientists
Case Study: Bad science versus hockey sticks: Michael Mann

Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University has been repeatedly singled out for harsh criticism by climate
deniers ever since the 2001 IPCC Third Assessment176 highlighted177 Mann’s graph of historic and prehistoric
temperature records, famously dubbed the ‘Hockey Stick’ graph, which illustrates the temperature spike in
the 20th century following 900 years of stable climate. The graph is easy to understand, and is a compelling
piece of scientific evidence that the temperature changes currently underway are large, fast and
significant historically.

In 2003, Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon managed to get a study published178 in “Climate
Research179” which challenged the Hockey Stick study. Mann, in an interview, said of the paper180:

“It really was one of the poorest pieces of scholarship that any of us in the climate research
community had ever seen… it was clear that there was an effort by some on the editorial
board to compromise the PR (peer review) process and allow through this deeply, deeply
flawed paper in the professional literature where it was immediately held up by those in
Washington opposed to taking action against climate change … as somehow being the
dagger in the heart of the case for global warming, when in fact it was just an extremely bad
study that never should have published”…

Mann and a dozen or so other scientists refuted the Soon/Baliunas paper in the American
Geophysical Union’s publication, EOS.

Scientific American interviewed several experts whose work was also discussed by Soon and Baliunas:

“The fact that it has received any attention at all is a result, again in my view, of its utility to those
groups who want the global warming issue to just go away,” —said Tim Barnett, a marine physicist at
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography

“The Soon et al. paper is so fundamentally misconceived and contains so many egregious errors that
it would take weeks to list and explain them all.” —Malcolm Hughes of the Laboratory of Tree-Ring
Research at the University of Arizona.

After publication it seemed that plenty of people agreed. The journal’s publisher Otto Kline, eventually
stated181 that “[the conclusions drawn] cannot be concluded convincingly from the evidence provided in the
paper”.182 The paper was acknowledged to have been partly funded by the American Petroleum Institute183.
The journal’s editor was New Zealand denier Chris de Freitas184, who published the study despite at least
one of the peer reviewers expressing concern at the paper185. The ensuing debate over the peer review
process caused three Climate Research editors to resign186.

Other deniers such as Canadians Ross McKitrick and Stephen McIntyre also attempted to take down
Mann’s work. Mann’s Hockey Stick has been replicated by a number of studies187, and was included in the
IPCC’s AR4, which has now extended the timeframe back 1,300 years. RealClimate provides the complete
details188, but Mann sums up the key point:

“Our attackers never want to look at the big picture; they never want to look at the question of whether
these critiques have any impact at all on the bottom line conclusions because they know that they
don’t. Even if they had been successful in taking down the Hockey Stick – which they haven’t been – it
still wouldn’t amount to undermining the central case for the science189.”

The hockey stick argument put up by Soon/Baliunas and McIntyre remains a key mantra of denial
arguments190, despite the fact it has been repeatedly confirmed by numerous different studies.

Since the Soon/Baliunas paper, Mann has had to defend his work time and time again. In 2003, the
leader of climate denial on the Hill in Washington and Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, Sen James Inhofe (R-OK), called on Mann to appear in the first of many hearings191, to testify
alongside Willie Soon. Inhofe, since he set foot in the house in 1989, has received $1.5m from oil and gas
interests during his political career. Koch Industries are his all time top contributors.

In 2005, Congressman Joe Barton sent letters192 to Mann and a handful of his colleagues, essentially
demanding they supply “computer programs, scripts, notes, literally every document from our scientific
careers”193 as well as data (which was already online and publicly available) so it could be discredited.

DEALING indoubtDealing in Doubt Greenpeace USA, 2013 page 40

The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), publishers of the peer-reviewed journal
Science, protested about the witch hunt in a June 2005 letter194 to Barton:

“Your letters, however, in their request for highly detailed information regarding not only the
scientists’ recent studies but also their life’s work, give the impression of a search for some
basis on which to discredit these particular scientists and findings, rather than a search for
understanding.”195

As The New Scientist reported in November 2006:

“Texas Republican Congressman Joe Barton196, chair of the House Committee on Energy
and Commerce, ordered Mann to provide the committee with voluminous details of his
working procedures, computer programs and past funding. Barton’s demands were widely
condemned by fellow scientists and on Capitol Hill. “There are people who believe that if they
bring down Mike Mann, they can bring down the IPCC,” said [Ben] Santer at the time. Mann’s
findings, which will be endorsed in the new IPCC report, have since been replicated by other
studies.”197

Barton has received $1.75 million from oil and gas interests in his political career 1998–2013.

Again, a house of cards approach by the deniers – try to discredit one scientist and one study and thereby
cast doubt on the entire scientific consensus.

A Washington Post editorial titled “Hunting Witches”198 accused Barton of “outrageous” behaviour, stating
that, “The only conceivable purpose of these letters is harassment.” Science writer Chris Mooney further
details this “congressional inquisition” in a July 2005 article in American Prospect 199 entitled “Mann Hunt”.

Mann was back before the House in a special set of hearings200 in July 2006 before the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce’s subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation, centered on George Mason
University’s Edward Wegman.

The “Wegman Report” as it became known, concluded that Mann’s work was flawed. But Wegman was
later widely discredited201 for having allegedly plagiarized parts of the report, as well as deliberately cherry-
picking computer simulation results to falsely argue that the scientist’s algorithm automatically produced
“hockey sticks”.

He ended up being under investigation202 by George Mason University for his work, which exonerated him
for a few of the earliest complaints, ignored many more, but found him at fault for a paper that had already
been retracted for plagiarism. Absurdly, part of the plagiarism in the Wegman Report was ruled not plagia-
rism, even though it was a longer version of the retracted paper.

But the attacks continued, with Sen James Inhofe (R-OK) giving a speech203 on the floor of the House in
2006.

Mann fights back

After so many years of being attacked, Michael Mann has begun fighting back.

He is currently in the middle of two court cases: one against the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the
National Journal Online – and one against Canadian scientist Tim Ball, both for defamation.

Mann’s defamation case against the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the National Journal online came
after a particularly vicious attack on his character by the think tank and the media outlet which together
accused him of producing bogus work, of being a fraud, and likening and comparing him and his science to
the actions of convicted Penn State child molester Jerry Sandusky. Skeptical Science has the full story. 204
The defendants tried to get the case dismissed in July 2013, but their motions were rejected by the court.205

Meanwhile, Mann is also suing Canadian denier Tim Ball206 and the think tank, The Frontier Center for
Climate Policy. The case was filed in Canada’s Supreme Court of British Colombia in March 2011. Ball also
accused Mann of fraud after the Climategate emails.

In an interview, an anonymous questioner asked Ball: “Various government and academic agencies have
whitewashed the Climategate scandal so far. Do you think anyone will be prosecuted for fraud?” Ball
responds, “Michael Mann at Penn State should be in the State Pen, not Penn State.”

At the time of writing, in August 2013, both court cases are ongoing.

Michael Mann has now written a book about the denier machine’s ongoing campaign against his work: “The
Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines.”207

Other attacks on scientists
Dr Benjamin Santer

Dr Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California was lead author of chapter 8 in the 1995
IPCC SAR report, the chapter that first confirmed the human impact on climate change.208 The policymakers
summary contained the sentence “The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on
global climate”, a sentence that placed Santer squarely in the sights of the deniers. In fact Santer didn’t even
write the sentence or come up with the word “discernible” – it was IPCC chair Bert Bolin.209

Nevertheless, this marked the beginning of a long-running personal attack on Santer. He was falsely ac-
cused of “scientific cleansing”, in a Global Climate Coalition (the industry coalition GCC) press release before
the report was released. He was also accused of “political tampering” with the text of the summary for
policymakers and of “research irregularities” in his own work.

Commenting on the “scientific cleansing” charge Santer said

“The GCC accused me of ‘scientific cleansing’ at a time when ‘ethnic cleansing’ was being committed
in Bosnia. My paternal grandparents died in concentration camps during the Second World War. They
were subjects of Hitler’s ‘ethnic cleansing.’ So maybe you can understand why the ‘scientific cleansing’
charge was so abhorrent.”210

In a June 12, 1996 Wall Street Journal Op Ed, Fred Seitz211 of the George C Marshall institute212 and long-
time tobacco apologist, accused Santer of working to “deceive policy makers and the public into believing
that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming.”213

Santer stated in an August 2006 interview with the journal Environmental Science and Technology: “I’d
guess that about a year of my life was spent defending that scientific conclusion and my own personal
scientific reputation… I was a messenger bearing news that some very powerful people did not want to
hear. So they went after the messenger. They were very good at it.214”

A scientist interviewed about the targeting of Santer by deniers said it was “one of the most vicious attacks I
have ever seen on the integrity of a scientist.”215

Santer has now detailed the full story on the RealClimate216 blog, in response to the whole episode being
(again inaccurately) repeated in The Guardian217.

Dr Kevin Trenberth

Five years later the Third Assessment report triggered a new round of personal attacks. This time Kevin
Trenberth, the head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research was the target.
Trenberth was one of the ten most cited authors of studies about global warming in the ten years to 2001.218

He has been repeatedly attacked for a study he co-authored219 asserting that global warming has intensi-
fied storms and hurricanes, particularly evidenced by the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season (famous for the
devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina).

Meteorologist denier William Gray220 described Trenberth as having “sold his soul to the devil,”221 and
Senator James Inhofe launched an investigation into Trenberth’s employer after the release of the study
linking increased storm intensity to global warming.222

Trenberth hit back, saying: “The attacks on me are clearly designed to get me fired or to resign.” 223

Fred Singer also joined the fray, saying Trenberth was “out of his specialty”224, an interesting accusation
coming from Singer, who has purported, at various times, to be a scientific expert on everything from
secondhandcigarette smoke, to the ozone layer, nuclear energy and the climate.

Using Freedom of Information to attack scientists

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests have long formed the backbone of climate accountability
research. FOIA and State Public Records Act requests have been used by NGOs, authors, academics and
reporters, to investigate interactions between Government and fossil fuel industry interests long before the
so-called “Climategate” attack was launched.

Such inquiries have netted evidence of Exxon representative asking in early 2001 for the for the ouster of
then IPCC Chairman Robert Watson225 and, more recently, a FOIA to the Smithsonian Institute revealed that
Dr. Soon has received well over $1 million in corporate funding for his work over past decade. 226

The scientists targeted at East Anglia University were contesting a broad Freedom of Information request
that may have been the origin of the gathered emails that were eventually stolen.

Since Climategate, there has been a notable increase in the use of Freedom of Information requests in
the United States in attempts to seize scientists’ raw data and professional correspondence. The climate
deniers came home to pursue the other end of the conversations revealed by the Climategate hackers.

They now request emails that scientists send to each other when they’re working, sharing parcels of data
analysis, emails that push and challenge both method and conclusions, part of the robust cut and thrust of
scientific endeavour.

The deniers then go through these emails to cherrypick phrases and information to twist and used against
scientists, in attempts to drum up media scandals and slow down the scientists. It has to be noted that
the scientists they target are those who are authors of papers that “prove” the science of global warming,
or the human footprint: scientists of great repute who have done groundbreaking work that furthers our
understanding of the climate science.

This freedom of information strategy is possibly also a way to waste scientists’ time and intimidate them from
participating in normal scientific practice.

The American Tradition Institute (ATI)227 was set up to specifically focus on FOIA US Freedom of Information
Act legislation) cases. Christopher Horner, of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, is an ATI senior fellow who
“provides strategic and legal counsel to ATI on cases involving Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) filings...”

The ATI has its roots in228 fossil fuel funded think tanks and oil magnates. A Southern Studies investigation
found that “ATI has connections with the Koch brothers, Art Pope and other conservative donors seeking to
expand their political influence.”

The ATI vs Mann and UVA

The group began with attempting to get hold of, through FOIA, all of Dr Michael Mann’s emails when he
was at the University of Virginia (UVA). By May, 2011, when UVA was slow in responding, the ATI joined with
a Republican member of Virginia’s House of Representatives, Robert Marshall, to sue the UVA through

the courts for Mann’s records. The University’s argument that correspondence between Mann and other
scientists should not be released to the likes of the ATI convinced a Virginia State judge, who ruled against
the move229 in September 2012.

As Mann wrote on his facebook page:230 “This finding is a potentially important precedent, as ATI and
other industry-backed front groups continue to press their attacks on climate scientists through the abuse
of public records and FOIA laws and the issuing of frivolous and vexatious demands for internal scholarly
deliberations and personal correspondences.”

The ATI case followed an attempt by Republican and Virginia State Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli to use
his office to pressure UVA to release Mann’s emails. The UVA spent close to $600,000 defending Mann’s
right to his email correspondence, and, in March 2012, won the case231 at the State Supreme Court.
Cuccinelli is currently running for Governor of Virginia.

ATI vs James Hansen and NASA

The ATI then turned its sights to another of their favourite targets, NASA’s James Hansen. The whole story
is told by Joe Romm at Think Progress, showing that one result of these requests was to distract these
scientists from their research.

Hansen: “I am now inundated with broad FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests for my corre-
spondence, with substantial impact on my time and on others in my office. I believe these to be fishing
expeditions, aimed at finding some statement(s), likely to be taken out of context, which they would
attempt to use to discredit climate science.”

ATI vs climate scientists and journalists

The ATI has now set its sights on trying to get emails232 between climate scientists and journalists.

ATI and the EPA

The Competitive Enterprise Institute, Horner’s home organisation – and the ATI – have now filed FOIA
requests233 with the EPA in an attempt to get former Administrator Lisa Jackson’s and current Administrator
Gina McCarthy’s text and Instant Messaging records.

Milloy is also working for ATI234 attacking EPA

FOI in Australia

The use of Freedom of Information has not been restricted to the US. The same tactics are also being used
in Australia.

In 2011, a number of stories235 were published outlining death threats against Australian climate scientists.

One blogger, Simon Turnill, set about trying to find out the details of those threats through a FOI request to
the Australian National University.

When those emails, released under FOI, showed abuse – but no specific death threats, bloggers and
the Murdoch-owned The Australian newspaper rushed to claim that scientists were fabricating claims
they were getting death threats. Other Murdoch columnists picked it up in Australia, with one calling it a
“mini climategate”236. The story was picked up by the denier blogs, including Antony Watts237 and James
Delingpole238.

Yet the FOI request was only for a specific 6-month period for a list of six academics at ANU. Most
of the examples quoted had been from other scientists from different universities at other times.

Conspiracy of doubt

University of Western Australia’s Professor of Psychology Stephan Lewandowsky conducted a survey to
find out about conspiracy theories. The results, now published in the journal Psychological Science,239 found
that people who rejected the science of human-caused climate change were also likely to endorse various
conspiracy theories, such as NASA faking moon landings and plots to kill Princess Diana.

The deniers rejected the findings outright, and invented a range of conspiracies about how Lewandowsky
had fabricated his results. Blogger Simon Turnill again filed a wide-ranging FOI request to find out.

The resulting emails released to Turnill showed no such conspiracy.240 Lewandowsky went on to write
another paper241 about the conspiracy theories invented by the deniers about his paper about conspiracy
theories, a paper the deniers have been fighting to stop the publication of ever since.

Personal attacks and death threats
One particularly nasty outcome of the front-group-led denial campaign has been the abuse of climate
scientists. The Scientific American242, George Monbiot in the Guardian243 and Clive Hamilton blogging
on Australia’s ABC website244 have all written recently about the storm of abuse climate scientists have
received.

The target of climate denier attacks for some years, Kevin Trenberth, told Scientific American:

“In science there’s a whole lot of facts and basic information on the nature of climate change, but it’s
not being treated that way. It’s being treated as opinion245.”

The Guardian reported an uptick of abusive emails to climate scientists after the Climategate attack:

“Professor Stephen Schneider, a climatologist based at Stanford University in California, whose name
features in the UEA emails, says he has received “hundreds” of violently abusive emails since last
November. The peak came in December during the Copenhagen climate change summit, he said,
but the number has picked up again in recent days since he co-authored a scientific paper last month
which showed that 97%–98% of climate scientists agree that mankind’s carbon emissions are causing
global temperatures to increase.”246

Clive Hamilton: “In recent months, each time they enter the public debate through a newspaper article
or radio interview these scientists are immediately subjected to a torrent of aggressive, abusive and, at
times, threatening emails. Apart from the volume and viciousness of the emails, the campaign has two
features – it is mostly anonymous and it appears to be orchestrated,”247.

Hamilton authored “Scorcher – the dirty politics of climate change248” a book where he outlines the decade-
long, coal-industry funded campaign in Australia to deny climate science and its close relationship with then
Prime Minister and climate denier John Howard who refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.

He tells of a respected climate scientist, Professor David Karoly at the University of Melbourne, who received
these emails:

“It is probably not to (sic) extreme to suggest that your actions (deceitful) were so criminal to be
compared with Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot. It is called treason and genocide” and “Oh, as a scientist, you
have destroyed peoples trust in my profession. You are a criminal. Lest we forget.”249

Comments across the blogosphere follow a similar vein, such as this, posted on a Chicago Tribune blog
explaining the robustness of the climate science conclusions:

“Global warming is a genocidalist scam to kill us all by 2050. There is no scientific basis for climate
science, there is no such thing as radiative forcing. This hoax is bringing down the US Government
and the rest because we see by their going along with this $45 trillion scam, they are just lining their
own pockets. Both the Clintons and Obamas are personally involved in this mass murder ring worse
than Hitler’s Nazi Germany, in fact this plan is Nazi in origin, like the original Green Movement.250”
– Stan Lippmann (03/03/2010, 4:30 AM)

Climate scientists are used to robust debate through the peer review process with challenges coming from
new research that proves or disproves their research. But when they are faced with a barrage of abuse from
non-scientists, fed by the denial industry, it’s much more difficult for them to deal with. This is made worse
because like most practicing academics the contact details of climate scientists are almost always publically
listed on university websites.

As (the late) Dr. Schneider pointed out to the Guardian in 2010, this pressure is not an insignificant pressure
on the scientists lives:

Schneider described his attackers as “cowards” and said he had observed an “immediate, noticeable rise”
in emails whenever climate scientists were attacked by prominent right-wing US commentators, such as
Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh.

“[The senders] are not courageous people,” said Schneider. “Where are they getting their information
from? They just listen to assertions made on blogs and rightwing talkshows. It’s pathetic.”

Schneider said the FBI had taken an interest earlier this year when his name appeared on a “death list” on a
neo-Nazi website alongside other climate scientists with apparent Jewish ancestry. But, to date, no action
has been taken.

“The effect on me has been tremendous,” said Schneider. “Some of these people are mentally imbal-
anced. They are invariably gun-toting rightwingers. What do I do? Learn to shoot a Magnum? Wear a

bullet-proof jacket? I have now had extra alarms fitted at my home and my address is unlisted. I get
scared that we’re now in a new Weimar republic where people are prepared to listen to what amounts
to Hitlerian lies about climate scientists.” 251

Attacks on the consensus
In 2004, Naomi Oreskes published a study in Science252 that reviewed 928 papers published on climate
change between 1993 and 2003, looking for any evidence that the papers might conclude that climate
change was what the denial machine claims: a “natural occurrence”.

She found no such evidence.

This analysis shows that scientists publishing in the peer-reviewed literature agree with IPCC, the
National Academy of Sciences, and the public statements of their professional societies. Politicians,
economists, journalists, and others may have the impression of confusion, disagreement, or discord
among climate scientists, but that impression is incorrect.

Oreskes then became the target of denier fury.

In 2005, the UK Global Warming Policy Foundation’s Benny Peiser, not a scientist, claimed to have analysed
Oreskes’ work, and sent his analysis253 to Science Web to publish as a “letter”. It wasn’t published. Peiser
later admitted254 he didn’t check the same abstracts that Oreskes used in her study.

“Which is why I no longer maintain this particular criticism. In addition, some of the abstracts that I
included in the 34 “reject or doubt” category are very ambiguous and should not have been included.”

In 2007, the Science and Public Policy Institute published an “open letter”255 from UK endocrinologist Mr.
Klaus-Martin Schulte, who had submitted a paper taking down Oreskes’ paper to a journal renowned for
publishing denier papers. The SPPI’s Lord Christopher Monckton weighed in with his own essay256 (one of
many “papers” Monckton claims he has had “published”), quoting Schulte’s “soon to be published” work.
The pre-publication noise was deafening.

But even the editor of the “Energy and Environment” journal, Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen (herself well-
linked with the denial machine)257, decided not to publish the paper, claiming it was a “bit patchy and nothing
new.”258

Oreskes went on to write a book, “Merchants of Doubt”259 that chronicles the beginnings of climate denial.
The media attention she has gained260 has made her an ongoing a target for the denial machine, the
latest being called “The Queen of Climate Smear”261 on an Australian blog in 2013 (cross-posted262 by The
Heartland Institute).

2013 consensus study shows 97% agree on human-caused climate change

In 2013 a new peer reviewed study was published in Environmental Research Letters263, looked at more
than 4,000 abstracts by more than 10,000 scientists that stated a position on human-caused global
warming. 97 percent of the papers, and 98 percent of the scientists endorsed the consensus. See also the
consensusproject.264

Anthony Watts led the attacks, calling the paper “fuzzy math”265 and “an epic lie of all proportions”.
Heartland’s James Taylor said in Forbes magazine the “alarmists” had been “caught doctoring”266 their
science.

Faking It
2012: “Pal review” replaces “peer review”

One of the key tests of modern science is the ability for a paper to pass “peer review” where experts review
the work of other experts in their area. This is what rigorous scientific “debate” looks like. It is through these
peer to peer checks and balances that science moves forward and traditionally happens through peer-
reviewed journals rather than in the media, where deniers like to debate.

A conspiracy theory regularly put forward by climate deniers is that climate scientists get their “pals” to do
the peer review so that they can get published. Of course scientists will know many of the other scientists
working in the same field – they are all experts. But they’re also the biggest critics of their own work and
strive to improve or strengthen the work of others. The editors of such journals also rarely tell the authors
just who the reviewers are.

In 2012, researcher and blogger John Mashey undertook a detailed investigation267 turning this particular
denier spotlight back on themselves.

Mashey looked at a run of climate denier papers published in one journal, “Climate Research” by one editor,
New Zealander Chris de Freitas, from 1996 to 2003. De Freitas published the Soon/Baliunas paper that tried
to take down Dr Michael Mann’s “Hockey Stick” paper, leading to the resignation of a number of editors in
protest at what they saw as a flawed peer review process.

Mashey selected a group of 14 climate deniers, none of whom had had papers published in Climate
Research prior to De Freitas’ editorship. From 1996–2003, 17 papers from this group of deniers were
published in Climate Research, with 14, all but three of them edited by de Freitas.

For example, Patrick Michaels was an author of seven of the papers, accounting for half of his total peer-
reviewed publications during this timeframe. Skeptical science has the full story.268

2012: Fake a Government report

The Koch-funded Cato Institute and Patrick Michaels went to new lengths in 2012 when they faked a US
Government climate report.

In 2009, the White House released a report269 on the impacts of climate change on the US, entitled “Global
Climate Change Impacts in the United States” that set out the predicted impacts of climate change across
the US.

In October 2012, Patrick Michaels, with the Cato Institute, released a report with an identical front page, with
one word added: Addendum. “Addendum: Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States”. The report
was deliberately designed to confuse policymakers and was used270 in a Congressional presentation by
denier John Christy the following month.

Greenpeace outlines the links271 between Cato, the Koch brothers and Patrick Michaels’ place in the denial
machine.

ClimateScienceWatch looks at the errors272 in the report.

Media matters has a great summary273 of how Patrick Michaels has consistently gotten the science wrong.

Fake A Counter Consensus

At a meeting of ExxonMobil shareholders in May 2000, then ExxonMobil Chairman and Chief Executive Lee
Raymond aggressively questioned the scientific consensus by citing a petition signed by ‘17,000 scientists’
that dismissed warnings of human-induced global warming274.

Doubts about the petition’s credibility were quick to surface when it turned out that the signatures included
those of the Spice Girls. The petition effort was also rebuffed by the National Academy of Sciences:

“The NAS Council would like to make it clear that this petition has nothing to do with the National
Academy of Sciences ”275 said the NAS statement, which also noted that

“The petition was mailed with an op-ed article from The Wall Street Journal and a manuscript in a
format that is nearly identical to that of scientific articles published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences”.

In reality the petition was prepared by the so-called Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, a tiny outfit in
Texas, with the ExxonMobil-backed George C Marshall Institute. Three climate scientists roundly rebutted 276
the accompanying paper.

This tactic was recycled in June 2007, the Heartland Institute and Hudson Institute published an article by
Denis Avery, entitled “500 Scientists Whose Research Contradicts Man-Made Global Warming Scares”
as part of a campaign to publicise a book written by Fred Singer and Avery. The appendix included a
long list of scientists’ research they claimed supported Singer and Avery’s allegation that global warming
wasn’t happening – or wasn’t a crisis. When blogger Kevin Grandia and others at DeSmogBlog contacted
a number of the scientists listed, and outraged climate scientists wrote back arguing their work did NOT
support the contention.

“I am very shocked to see my name in the list of “500 Scientists with Documented Doubts of Man-
Made Global Warming Scares”. Because none of my research publications has ever indicated that the
global warming is not as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, I view that the inclusion
of my name in such list without my permission or consensus has damaged my professional reputation
as an atmospheric scientist.277”—Dr. Ming Cai, Associate Professor, Department of Meteorology,
Florida State University.

“They have taken our ice core research in Wyoming and twisted it to meet their own agenda. This is
not science”278. —Dr. Paul F. Schuster, Hydrologist, US Geological Survey.

Of those scientists who contacted DeSmogBlog, none could see how their research contributing to the
IPCC effort could have supported Singer and Avery’s claims.

Fake science and polar bears

In March 2007, the journal “Ecological Complexity” published a “Viewpoint” article entitled “Polar bears
of western Hudson Bay and climate change: Are warming spring air temperatures the “ultimate” survival
control factor?” positing that polar bears were not under threat from global warming and that Arctic sea ice
decline was less severe than stated in recent peer-reviewed literature279.

Ecological Complexity publishes peer-reviewed research, but “viewpoints” aren’t subject to such review.
Because the peer-reviewed and non peer-review reports look almost identical in format it would be almost
impossible for a lay reader to tell the difference.

The authors included several scientists well connected with the denial industry: Sallie Baliunas, Willie Soon,
David Legates280 and Tim Ball281.

They argued that scientific modelling showing polar bear populations were threatened by climate change
could not be trusted. They went on to question not only the climate science showing that the Arctic was
warming and sea ice was decreasing, but also tried to show that things like tourism were a much bigger
threat to polar bears than the disappearance of their habitat282.

The article landed around the time that the US Government was making decisions on whether to list the
polar bear as an endangered species, a decision which could have had large knock-on effects in terms of
American climate legislation and the oil industry’s exploration of the Arctic for oil. It was widely quoted in
submissions by Sarah Palin, then Governor of Alaska’s office in her (unsuccessful) submission challenging
the listing of the polar bear under the ESA.

Willie Soon acknowledges in the article283 that the research was partly sponsored (for Willie Soon’s work)
by ExxonMobil, the American Petroleum Institute and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation (the Koch
Brothers have the largest privately-owned oil trading, refining and pipeline company in the US and regularly
fund climate denial organizations). Nor has he or his funders stated on the record the remit for this research
project.

In 2011, a Greenpeace investigation found that Soon has received more than $1m over the past
decade or so from fossil fuel companies – and, from 2002–2011, none of his research was funded
from sources other than fossil fuel companies. In 2011 he received $64,000 from Donors Trust.

One scientist noted when the Ecological Complexity article was published that the references cited in the
‘viewpoint’ paper stopped in 2002, after which the Arctic experienced four very warm years. Months after
the piece was published, leading polar bear experts, Stirling and Derocher, published a critical response:

“[the authors] …suggest that factors other than climate warming are responsible for a decline in the
polar bear population of Western Hudson Bay… In our examination of their alternative explanations,
and the data available to evaluate each, we found little support for any,” they said284.

The denier authors then of course got the chance to respond to Stirling and Derocher in the journal, giving
them additional undeserved credibility.285 But that’s how science is debated.

Unlike Soon and Baliunas’s article which was conveniently published just ahead of the US Government’s
decision on whether to list polar bears as endangered because of global warming, Stirling and Derocher’s
paper couldn’t be taken into account by the decision makers.

The Viewpoint article prompted a letter to ExxonMobil from Brad Miller, Chair of the US House Sub
Committee on Investigations and Oversight, which raised a key question about Exxon’s funding:

“To people outside the scientific community, one PhD may seem like another. Certainly Exxon knows
better, however. Yet according to Dr Soon, an astrophysicist by profession, ExxonMobil funded the
development of his “opinions” on global warming and its potential impact on polar bear populations.
…. The Congress and the Public have a right to know why ExxonMobil is funding a scientist whose
writing is outside his area of expertise to create the impression that expert scientists have conducted
vigorous, peer reviewed work that says the problems with polar bears [and climate change] are
unproven or unserious.286”

Can’t publish a peer-reviewed article? Self-publish a book.

“[Books] are clearly a vital weapon in the conservative movement’s war on climate science, and one of
the key means by which it diffuses climate change denial throughout American society and into other
nations.” – Dr Riley Dunlap, Oklahoma State University

In the absence of their ability to publish real science in peer reviewed scientific journals, (not least because
so many of the climate denial scientists are not actual climate scientists and the lobbyists are not experts)
one common tactic over the years has been to write a book. These books are often self-published and
printed up by the think tanks and front groups themselves, such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute or
the Cato Institute.

If one goes online to Amazon and looks up UK blogger James Delingpole’s book, “Watermelons: The Green
Movement’s True Colors287” and look at the “Customers who bought this book also bought..” section and it’s
filled with the latest books on the global warming “hoax.”

As outlined on DesmogBlog, two behavioural scientists, Dr Riley Dunlap, of Oklahoma State University,
and Peter Jacques, of the University of Central Florida, researched the publication of books by deniers and
published their study288 in the journal American Behavioural Scientist. They concluded:

“The general lack of peer-review allows authors or editors of denial books to make inaccurate asser-
tions that misrepresent the current state of climate science. Like the vast range of other non-peer-
reviewed material produced by the denial community, book authors can make whatever claims they
wish, no matter how scientifically unfounded.”

Fake – or outdated – qualifications
There’s a growing list of claims made by deniers to make their qualifications look more than what they
actually are, or to claim expertise in an area they’ve never trained for. Here’s a snapshot.

Willie Soon

Claim: “Mr. Soon, a natural scientist at Harvard, is an expert on mercury and public health issues.” (Wall
Street Journal, May 25 2011)289

Fact: Dr Wei Hock (Willie) Soon is an astrophysicist at the Harvard Smithsonian School of Astrophics, which
is not Harvard University per se. He is trained in neither public health nor a qualified expert on mercury.

Claim: Sea level rise expert

Fact: no evidence of qualifications in this area, confirmed by his own biography.290

Tim Ball (Canada)

Claim: Professor of Climatology (of 28 years, or 32 years), Winnipeg University

Fact: He was Professor of Geography at Winnipeg University for 8 years, with various associate professor-
ships and lecturing postitions before that. Winnipeg University didn’t have a Department of Climatology291.

Claim: “One of the first Climatology PhD’s in the world”

Fact: Actual qualifications: PhD in Geographical History, not climatology. When he gained his “entry level”
PhD, there were already qualified PhD’s in climatology.

Lord Christopher Monckton, Viscount of Brenchley

Claim292: General expertise in climate science, including publishing a peer reviewed paper in American
Physical Society Newsletters.

Fact: The paper published was a “letter” in a journal that didn’t undertake the peer review process. At the
top of Monckton’s article,293 the editors posted this statement: “The following article has not undergone any
scientific peer review, since that is not normal procedure for American Physical Society newsletters.”

Claim: Member of the UK House of Lords

Fact: While Monckton is entitled to use the title “Lord”, he inherited the title after 1999 when UK legislation
removed the right for inherited Lords to automatically take up a seat in the House of Lords. In 2010, the
Clerk of the House wrote to Monckton294 asking him to desist from claiming membership.

Claim: Qualifications in Mathematics

Fact: He did a course in Mathematics at university.

Claim: An IPCC “expert reviewer”

Facts: Anyone can register themselves to be an “expert reviewer” for the IPCC – it is a self-designated title.
Monckton’s criticisms of the reports were rejected by the actual experts.

Bob Carter

Claim: Adjunct Professor of Geology at James Cook University in Australia,

Fact: He lost this title in January 2013. At the time of writing he is still listed as such on a number of denier
websites, such as the Global Warming Policy Foundation.295 The Heartland Institute did so in July 2013296,
but after publicity on the issue, changed the citation.

Claim: Research Professor at the University of Adelaide

Fact: While he was a visiting professor at the University of Adelaide only until 2005, many sites still describe
him297 as a “Research Professor at the University of Adelaide.”

S. Fred Singer

Former space scientist (a rocket scientist) and government administrator.

Retired, 1994

Expertise claimed:

•	 questioned the link between passive smoking and cancer (authored report)

•	 argues that there’s no link between CFCs and ozone depletion

•	 questioned the science of acid rain

Climate denial and US politics
The political effect of climate denial

2001 – 2008 The Bush White House

The eight years of the Bush White House was a key opportunity for the climate deniers.

During the 2000 presidential campaign debates, George W. Bush declared that global warming was “an
issue that we need to take very seriously,”298. He promised to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol, but backed off
that promise soon after coming into power.

In early 2001, communications expert Frank Luntz, had written the following advice on climate change:

“The scientific debate [on climate change] remains open. Voters believe that there is no consensus
about global warming within the scientific community. Should the public come to believe the scientific
issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to
continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate…”299

This became the guiding strategy of the White House and the Republican Party for the remainder of the
administration. In 2003 the advice in the Luntz memo was circulated to all Republicans on the Hill by the
GOP press office. Interestingly, the wordsmith Frank Luntz has since changed his mind on global warming
and now believes it’s caused by human activities300.

Deniers placed in key positions

During the Bush years, the denier industry enjoyed easy access to the White House, principally via former
employees of the American Petroleum Institute (API), on whose board Lee Raymond, Exxon CEO sat until
2005 when he retired.

In early 2001 lawyer Phil Cooney301 left his 15-year stint at the API (where he was “climate team leader”) to
take up a position as chief of staff at Bush’s White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), where
he advised the President on global warming policy and science. In 2005, it was revealed that he had been
watering down scientific reports.302 He resigned soon after and went to work for Exxon.

At the API, Cooney’s boss for many years had been William O’Keefe, former chair of the Global Climate
Coalition (GCC). O’Keefe had left the API to concentrate on running his front group the George C. Marshall
Institute. From 2001–2005 he was employed by ExxonMobil to lobby the Executive Office of the President,
the White House and Senate on climate change303. Perhaps coincidentally, ExxonMobil dropped O’Keefe’s
lobby contract at the same time Phil Cooney left the CEQ to work for Exxon.

A memo obtained by the National Resource Defence Council (NRDC) under the Freedom of Information Act
showed Exxon lobbyist Randy Randol suggesting replacements the Bush Administration could make to the
IPCC membership, “to assure none of the Clinton/Gore proponents are involved in any decisional activities.”
304 The suggested recruits included John Christy and Richard Lindzen.305

It also recommended the Administration employ Dr Harlan Watson. The Bush Administration subsequently
did appoint Harlan Watson to head both its UNFCCC and IPCC delegations.306

Bush administration forces out IPCC chair Robert Watson

The same memo that recommended Harlan Watson contained a direct request:

“Can [IPCC Chair Dr Robert] Watson be replaced now at the request of the US?

Subsequently, there was launched a successful effort to oust then IPCC Chair Dr Robert Watson. Watson,
an atmospheric scientist, had been at the forefront of the climate issue for over 20 years, coordinating
international science and reaction to the ozone hole crisis, then global warming. He had served as Chair of
the IPCC between 1996–2002.

In April 2002, the Bush Administration opposed Watson’s re-appointment, instead successfully backing
IPCC vice-chairman Rajendra Pachauri, to replace him.

Robert Watson himself commented: “So those who say I’m an advocate don’t want to hear the message
that indeed the earth is warming; that most of the warming of the last 50 years is attributable to human
activities; that carbon dioxide is the key human-induced greenhouse gas and that most of it comes from
fossil fuels. There are some people who clearly don’t want to hear that message, but that is the message of
the IPCC…307”

Fred Singer made an oblique reference to Watson’s demise after the AR4 was published, saying “Compared
to earlier reports, the “Fourth Assessment” is really quite sober, perhaps because a real scientist, less given
to ideology, heads the effort.”308

2013: Republican denial

Polling in the US has consistently showed a lower level of concern about climate change compared with the
rest of the world.

A Pew Global poll309 in June 2013 found that “Concern about global climate change is particularly prevalent
in Latin America, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Asian/Pacific region, but majorities in Lebanon,
Tunisia and Canada also say climate change is a major threat to their countries. In contrast, Americans
are relatively unconcerned about global climate change.”

While there has been no conclusive research to show that this is due to climate denial campaigns, a closer
inspection of the research is revealing.

The polling in the US consistently shows a party political divide on concern about global warming. And a
June 2013 study published in the journal “Public understanding of science310” concluded that a key link
between climate change denial and conservative outlets like Fox News and Rush Limbaugh was an inherent
distrust of scientists311.

“Conservative media use decreases trust in scientists which, in turn, decreases certainty that global
warming is happening,” stated the authors.

But nowhere is the denial in the US more prevalent than in its leadership.

The fossil fuel industry and the think tanks running climate denial campaigns, such as the Koch-funded
Americans for Prosperity (that founded the Tea Party movement) spent huge sums of money312 around the
2012 Presidential election. With their pressure on candidates to ditch any climate policies, and their catchcry
that Obama was running a “War on Coal”313, they had the White House scared, resulting in little to nomen-
tion314 of climate change from either candidate in the run-up to the 2012 elections and no questions at any of
the Presidential debates on the subject.

The Washington Post noted that the Republican election platform had almost no mention of climate change,
a marked contrast to its 2008 election platform for the McCain-Palin ticket.

Post elections, the results were clear. According to the Center for American Progress315, “almost 55 percent
— 127 members — of the current Republican caucus in the House of Representatives deny the basic tenets
of climate science. 65 percent (30 members) of the Senate Republican caucus also deny climate change.”

But this strategy may be beginning to backfire. In July 2012 a poll by the League of Conservation Voters
found 80 percent support among under 35 year olds for President Obama’s climate policies. But even
among the minority who were unfavorable to Obama, 56 percent supporting climate action and just 38
percent opposed.

And in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, and widespread droughts, floods and wildfires across the US, that, in
turn, led to a rise in public concern, the White House itself has finally begun to take notice. 316

In May 2013, the National Journal’s Coral Davenport reported what she called “The coming GOP civil war on
climate change,”317

“Already, deep fissures are emerging between, on one side, a base of ideological voters and lawmak-
ers with strong ties to powerful tea-party groups and super PACs funded by the fossil-fuel industry
who see climate change as a false threat concocted by liberals to justify greater government control;
and on the other side, a quiet group of moderates, younger voters, and leading conservative intellectu-
als who fear that if Republicans continue to dismiss or deny climate change, the party will become
irrelevant.”

ConClusion
Climate change is happening now, is caused by human-induced pollution from industrial activities and will
have catastrophic consequences, three assertions that are backed by the most rigorous scientific undertak-
ing in history.

They are backed by repeated analysis of published science confirming the consensus, and will be reinforced
by the IPCC’s AR5 Fifth Assessment reports, along with the US National Climate Assessment (NCA) in early
2014.

Each of these reports brings new urgency to the climate crisis, more clarity to the scientific consensus and
also brings another counter-attack from the climate denial machine.

Attacks on the IPCC AR5 and the US National Climate Assessment are already underway, well before they
are published.

The history of the US National Climate Assessment’s publication is significant. This report is required
by US law under the Global Change Research Act of 1990 to be delivered every four years. The Clinton
Administration published the first report in 2000. The second was published in the spring of 2009 in the
early Obama Administration. That’s a nine-year gap in an Assessment that was supposed to be published
every four years, to keep the American people and government informed about the impacts of climate
change.

The nine-year hiatus was the result of the massive pressure brought to bear on the Bush White House by
the same cogs in the climate denial machine that we outline in this report, oiled by fossil fuel interests. A
flurry of emails discovered by FOIA request between some of the key players here and the White House’s
man Phillip Cooney, who came from American Petroleum Institute and later went to work for ExxonMobil are
testament to that.

This briefing outlines the lengths to which the fossil fuel industry has been willing to go to prevent the
scientific conclusions from being accepted – or from even being published at all.

It provides just a flavor – a few examples of some of the more virulent attacks aimed at undermining public
confidence in climate science, all aimed at preventing government action to fight the climate crisis. All of
which means, the correct response to attacks on climate science is scepticism.

One episode not covered in this report was the odd play by coal interests in the 1990s, the Greening Earth
Society, wherein they published a lavish media packet, videos, booklets and spokespeople like Patrick
Michaels promoting the notion that global warming is in fact a good thing, and would lead to a “greening of
planet earth”, including increased agricultural production.

This recent history, as well as the prior history of denial by the tobacco companies and chemical, asbestos
and other manufacturing industries, is important to remember because, like the other industries that came
before it, the fossil fuel industry has never admitted that it was misguided or wrong in its early efforts to
delay the policy reaction to the climate crisis. To this day, it continues to obstruct solutions.

The individuals, organizations and corporate interests who comprise the ‘climate denial machine’ have
caused harm and have slowed our response time. As a result, we will all ultimately pay a much higher cost
as we deal with the impacts, both economic and ecological.

Eventually these interests will be held accountable for their actions.

aPPenDix i: CliMate Denial’s “Continental aRMy”

“There’s really only about 25 of us doing this. A core group of skeptics. It’s a ragtag bunch, very
Continental Army.” — Steve Milloy talking to Popular Science, June, 2012.

Steve The Junkman Milloy, arguably one of the very first global warming deniers, first shot to fame
through his challenges to the links between tobacco science and health problems when he was paid by
Phillip Morris to direct the front group it set up in 1997 to defend the science of second hand smoke: The
Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC). He then turned to denial of climate change, and has
been at the heart of that campaign ever since.

Milloy has claimed the campaign is driven by a small group of about 25 people. So who might this
“Continental Army” of about 25 people be? We’ve found 31. Of course there are more who have come and
gone, but this gives a fairly comprehensive picture.

The Echo Chamber
Along with the think tanks pushing climate denial, there’s a large “echo chamber” in the blogosphere, largely
led by a small band of bloggers. They have a larger echo chamber in the form of conservative media such
as Fox News, Rush Limbaugh et al.
