threats, while weakening enforcement of
environmental laws.
  To fulfill their Congressionally established
missions, agencies must have well-qualified lead-
ers who respect the laws they are tasked with
implementing—but many political appointees
lack basic relevant credentials or exhibit outright
hostility to the missions of  their agencies, and
several have resigned over conflicts of  interest
or improper use of  agency resources. To use
taxpayer dollars efficiently, agencies must attract
and retain skilled civil servants—but as scientists
face abuses of  scientific integrity and limits on
their communication with the public and scien-
tific peers, morale suffers and employees depart.
Finally, when employees blow the whistle on abuses,
they often face retaliation, which discourages
others from speaking out.

To fulfill their Congressionally mandated
missions, agencies must have well-
qualified leaders who respect the laws
they are tasked with implementing.

  This report describes new and ongoing threats
to the use of  science in public health and environ-
mental decisions and recommends steps Congress
can take in response. Each chapter investigates
one kind of  problem and suggests solutions.
Several of  the recommendations apply to
multiple chapters:

•	 Reveal abuses of scientific integrity:

Holding hearings, seeking information from
agency heads, and requesting investigations

Introduction
F ederally sponsored scientific research

and technology development have brought
us the ability to explore outer space, con-
vert sunlight into electricity, build super-

computers, predict weather patterns, manufacture
self-driving vehicles, and use assisted reproductive
technologies to give birth. Taxpayer-funded
science and scientists also improve our quality
of  life by finding cures to cancer and other dead-
ly diseases, developing technologies that protect
public health and safety, and inventing means
for enhancing national security. When conducted
appropriately, government science programs
yield enormous benefits.
  However, when political interference occurs—
such as politically motivated censorship, misrep-
resentation of  scientific findings, or the suppres-
sion of  the free flow of  information from the
government to the public—public health and
well-being suffer. Political interference in the
way the government communicates science and
uses it to inform policy is a long-term challenge to
protecting public health, safety,  and the environ-
ment. All modern presidential administrations
have politicized science in some way. However,
scientific integrity at federal agencies has eroded
recently, with serious consequences for public
trust and our government’s ability to respond
to problems.
  Agency leaders have ignored and mischarac-
terized scientific evidence on climate change,
worker compensation, and reproductive health.
They have cut themselves off from expert advice
that could lead to cleaner air and safer workplaces.
They have suppressed information that could
help families, national parks, and communities
better protect themselves from environmental

by Inspectors General and the Government
Accountability Office, as well as Congres-
sional investigations (using subpoena authority
if  necessary), can reveal when agencies have
suppressed, ignored, or failed to appropriately
use scientific evidence—and help to discourage
such actions in the future.

•	 Pass protective laws: Legislation such as

 the Scientific Integrity Act and the Executive
Branch Comprehensive Ethics Enforcement
Act can create stronger enforcement mech-
anisms and better protect whistleblowers,
encouraging employees who witness problems
to speak up.

•	 Hold appointees accountable: All members
of  Congress can hold appointees to high stan-
dards through hearings, investigations, and
subpoenas. When nominees are subject to
confirmation, senators should carefully vet
them and vote against any who are unquali-
fied, conflicted, or demonstrate disrespect
for science or agency missions.

The organizations that contributed to this report
work to ensure that U.S. policy decision-making is
fully informed by scientific evidence and the best
available data, and that the public has reliable
access to independent scientific information and
analysis produced and acquired by the federal
government without political interference.

Politicization of Science
within Agencies
Scientific evidence plays a critical

role in public health decision-making.
In recent regulatory actions, however,
several federal agencies have sidelined

EBSA, and HHS 2017), the U.S. Department
of  Health and Human Services (HHS) and other
agencies misrepresented the extensive body of
research on contraception and health (NPWF,
JIWH, and UCS 2017).

scientific evidence and the best available data.
This section discusses several examples of  this
alarming trend and demonstrates why undermin-
ing science in federal decision-making imperils
the integrity of  the rulemaking process, erodes
public trust, and interferes with people’s ability
to make decisions about their health and lives
with the best available information.

In several recent proposed rules,
agencies have failed to uphold their
responsibilities to consider relevant
evidence and provide the public
with necessary information.

multiple agencies DisregarD
science in rulemaking
The rulemaking process is designed to provide
sufficient information and analysis to allow the
public to adequately evaluate federal agency pro-
posals. In several recent proposed rules, agencies
have failed to uphold their responsibilities to con-
sider relevant evidence and provide the public
with necessary information. In some cases, these
rules have misrepresented the state of  scientific
knowledge or practice, denying stakeholders the
opportunity to make well-informed comments
that could improve regulations and risking
erosion of  public trust in the federal government.

rule on contraceptive coverage exemption
mischaracterizes health research
Under the Affordable Care Act, most health
insurance plans must cover methods of  contracep-
tion approved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) without cost-sharing. In an October
2017 Interim Final Rule expanding exemptions
for employers and universities not wishing to
cover some or all forms of  contraception (IRS,

  The agencies claimed that there is “complexity
and uncertainty in the relationship between con-
traceptive access, contraceptive use, and unintended
pregnancy” (IRS, EBSA, and HHS 2017) when,
in fact, evidence demonstrates that access to and
use of  contraception is associated with a reduction
in unintended pregnancies, and manufacturers
of  all FDA-approved methods have had to dem-
onstrate that their products are safe and effective
through randomized controlled trials (NPWF,
JIWH, and UCS 2017). In the interim rule, the
agencies asserted lack of  benefits, even though
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) deemed family planning one of  the 10
great public health achievements of  the 20th
century (CDC 1999). The agencies also claimed
greater risks than actually exist, especially when
considering that carrying a pregnancy to term
poses far greater risks to women’s health than
using contraception (CDC 2018; CDC 2017).
Many of  the studies cited were of  poor quality
and/or out of  date, and the rule did not reference
several high-quality sources of  evidence that

6  |  Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help

CDC experts likely would have recommended
if  the rule’s authors had sought their expertise.
  Federal agencies have long been trusted sources
of  information on public health, but issuing rules
that misrepresent the science on an important
public health topic threatens to erode public trust
in our health agencies. Weakening the credibility
of  public health agencies can undermine their
ability to promote healthy behaviors in the face
of  diseases and other health threats.

The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention deemed family planning
one of the 10 great public health
achievements of the 20th century.

tip rule omits Quantitative analysis
In December 2017, a notice of  proposed rule-
making (NPRM) from the U.S. Department of
Labor (DOL) proposed to rescind a portion of  tip
regulations that prohibit tip pooling. Under this
proposal, DOL would allow certain employers to
withhold workers’ tips in order to share a portion
with non-tipped employees (DOL 2017). The
proposal did not include a quantitative estimate
of  how much money would be shifted away
from tipped workers under the proposal.
  Days before the comment period closed,
Bloomberg News reported that DOL had in fact
undertaken a quantitative analysis of  the rule’s
impacts, but leadership reportedly requested
revisions after seeing the unfavorable findings
and then ultimately omitted the data from the
NPRM altogether (Penn 2018a). DOL’s Office
of  Inspector General is in the midst of  an
audit of  the rulemaking process (Penn 2018b).
The exclusion of  this analysis from the NPRM
jeopardizes the integrity of  the rulemaking
process and public trust that government-
funded analysis will be accessible to the public.

census adds untested Question
on citizenship
U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Wilbur Ross
decided to include a citizenship question on the
2020 Census (Ross 2018), despite the fact that
the question has not been asked on the full
Census since 1950 and has not undergone the
multiyear process for suggesting and testing new
questions that the U.S. Census Bureau uses in
the current era (Pritzker and Gutierrez 2018).
The U.S. Department of  Justice (DOJ) initiated
the request for including a citizenship question
under the guise of  protecting the Voting Rights
Act (VRA). However, in a Congressional hearing
on May 18, 2018, the acting head of  DOJ’s
Civil Rights Division, John M. Gore, acknowl-
edged that enforcement of  the VRA, passed in
1965, has never depended on the use of  Census
citizenship enumeration data directly (Latner
2018). Moreover, the administration’s previous
collaboration with anti-science perpetrators of
“voter fraud” myths raises concerns that citizen-
ship data would be used to enact strict voter
suppression laws (Parks 2018; Huseman 2017).
  While evidence of  benefits from adding a citi-
zenship question to the Census is scant, evidence
of  likely harms is compelling. Indeed, we know
from Census analysis that Latino populations are
already undercounted (Mule 2008), such that the
addition of  a question that would further reduce
response rates among legal immigrant residents
will create artificially low population estimates of
VRA-protected groups, making it more difficult
to identify and remedy VRA violations. The
addition of  a citizenship question is far more
likely to inhibit the successful trial of  VRA cases
by increasing the inaccuracy of  the Census than
to improve the assessment of  VRA claims due
to greater precision. Even Thomas Brunell, once
a candidate to direct the 2020 Census, recently
acknowledged that the administration is not
making a scientific move, but “a political decision”
(Mervis 2018). Recently, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed that
Commerce Secretary Ross can be deposed in
a suit filed by several states and advocacy groups

seeking to block the inclusion of  the question,
given evidence that Secretary Ross was not accu-
rate in his Congressional testimony claiming that
the question request came from DOJ (Thrush
and Liptak 2018).

epa proposes rule that would restrict
use of science in rulemaking
In April 2018, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) announced a proposed rule titled
“Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory
Science” (EPA 2018a). This proposal is the
agency iteration of  the failed 2017 Honest
and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act
(HONEST Act), a problematic bill previously
introduced as the Secret Science Reform Act.
These bills were long championed by Represen-
tative Lamar Smith, chairman of  the House
Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,
whose office then worked with political appoin-
tees at EPA to “internally implement” the
legislation (Eilperin and Dennis 2018).
  As the bills would have done, this proposed
rule would effectively prevent EPA from using
the best available science to protect public health
and the environment by requiring that all raw
data, models, code, and other materials used in
crafting a regulation be available to the public.
Although making data publicly available may
sound beneficial, allowing regulators to only con-
sider studies whose data are public would sharply
reduce the number of  high-quality studies the
agency could consider when setting standards.
EPA rules significantly rely on research involving
public health data, which are often confidential
due to privacy concerns, as well as on confiden-
tial business information. The draft rule does
not explain whether or how the agency would
continue to rely on public studies that use indi-
viduals’ confidential data to examine the impacts
of  air pollution and toxic chemicals on health.
If, under the rule, EPA refused to consider such
studies in rulemaking, it would effectively ham-
string its ability to carry out its mission to protect
human health. Both the failed bills and the pro-
posed rule have received significant pushback
from the scientific community (Meyer 2018).

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  7

  While the substance of  this rule is in itself
troubling, the process used to promulgate the
rule was equally problematic. The agency failed
to request input beforehand from the public, its
own science advisor’s office, or its own Science
Advisory Board, and proposed a rule that lacks
detail on crucial matters (Tollefson 2018) and
misrepresents trends in peer-reviewed publishing
(Berg et al. 2018). The rule did not undergo the
standard review process at the Office of  Infor-
mation and Regulatory Affairs, and perhaps as
a result does not include the kind of  detailed
analysis of  impacts that would allow stakeholders
to evaluate the rule (Hassan et al. 2018).

EPA’s rule does not explain whether
or how the agency would continue to rely
on public studies that use individuals’
confidential data to examine the impacts
of air pollution and toxic chemicals
on health.

  Because this proposal was based on the
HONEST Act rather than an internal agency
process, the Department of  the Interior (DOI)
has already developed and implemented similar
guidance. Agencies might also adopt other failed
legislation, such as the Better Evaluation of  Science
and Technology Act (BEST Act), which proposed
applying scientific standards language from the
recently updated Toxic Substances Control Act
to all federal rulemaking. The BEST Act would
have frozen scientific standards and hindered
agencies’ ability to utilize the best and most
up-to-date scientific information (Kothari 2017).

political interference in grants
The federal grantmaking process should operate
transparently and in accordance with the goals
of  each grant program, not the personally held
beliefs and goals of  political appointees. However,
recent events have raised concerns about funding
decisions based on political considerations rather
than established program goals and criteria. In

8  |  Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help

some cases, grant funding was abruptly termi-
nated before a research project could be finished.
Halting a study before data collection or analysis
can be completed essentially wastes the money
already expended, and denies the agency and the
public the knowledge that a completed project
would have yielded (Abraham et al. 2017). It is
also at odds with the approach recommended by
the bipartisan Commission on Evidence-Based
Policymaking (Abraham et al. 2017).

Halting a study before data collection or
analysis can be completed essentially

early termination of teen pregnancy
prevention grants
The Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP
Program), administered by the HHS Office of
Adolescent Health (OAH), has been lauded by
independent experts as a strong example of  evi-
dence-based policymaking. Established by Con-
gress in fiscal year (FY) 2010, it uses a two-tiered
approach, with 75% of  funding designated to
replicate evidence-based program models that
have proven under rigorous evaluation to change
behavior (Tier 1), and 25% to support the devel-
opment, implementation, and rigorous evaluation
of  innovative approaches or significant adapta-
tions of  existing models (Tier 2). The September
2017 unanimously agreed–to report from the
bipartisan Commission on Evidence-Based
Policymaking established by House Speaker
Paul Ryan and Senator Patty Murray highlighted
the TPP Program as an example of  a federal
program developing increasingly rigorous port-
folios of  evidence (Abraham et al. 2017).

In the summer of  2017, OAH notified more
than 80 TPP Program grantees that their five-year
projects would end two years early (Kay 2017).

Grantees across the country faced the loss of
approximately $200 million in total funding to
replicate a wide variety of  evidence-based pro-
grams or conduct rigorous evaluation of  promis-
ing approaches to continue building knowledge.
HHS gave no explanation for these actions and
in recent months, four federal judges have found
HHS’s termination of  the TPP Program grants
to be unlawful (Hellman 2018). In the midst
of  these court decisions, in April 2018, OAH
released two new Tier 1 and Tier 2 funding
opportunity announcements (FOAs) that repre-
sent a troubling departure from the rigorous stan-
dards of  evidence and evaluation that the TPP
Program has used in the past. For example, the
current FOAs fail to reference the HHS Teen
Pregnancy Prevention Evidence Review, an
independent, systematic, and rigorous review
of  evaluation studies managed by the HHS
Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation
(HHS 2018). In addition, the FOAs prioritize a
single approach that emphasizes abstinence or
returning to abstinence rather than funding for a
variety of  programs that are grounded in evidence.
Several lawsuits have been filed against the FOAs
(Uzzell and Troiano 2018). Federal judges in
Oregon and New York have ruled that the
administration’s Tier 1 FOA violated Congres-
sional intent, and blocked HHS from proceeding
to award funds under that FOA (Democracy
Forward 2018).

political review of epa grants
In a sharp departure from practices under past
Republican and Democratic administrations,
EPA Deputy Associate Administrator for the
Office of  Public Affairs John Konkus began
personally reviewing all grant solicitations and
awards. Konkus reportedly told staff he was look-
ing out for mentions of  “climate change,” and
canceled nearly $2 million in grants that had
been competitively awarded to universities and
nonprofit organizations. Around the time that
U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from
Alaska, voted against a healthcare bill that most
of  her Republican colleagues supported, EPA

staffers were instructed without explanation to
halt grants to Alaska. In explaining how unusual
such a practice was, former EPA administrator
Christine Todd Whitman (who served in the
administration of  President George W. Bush)
told the Washington Post, “We didn’t do a politi-
cal screening on every grant, because many
of  them were based on science, and political
appointees don’t have that kind of  background”
(Eilperin 2017a).

halting of national academies studies
DOI abruptly instructed the National Academies
of  Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to cease
work on two studies that were under way on
impacts of  fossil fuel activities: a study into the
health impacts of  a mining technique known as
“mountaintop removal” on people living near
central Appalachia mine sites (Fears 2018) and
an investigation into how DOI’s Bureau of  Safety
and Environmental Enforcement could improve
its inspections of  offshore oil and gas develop-
ment to avoid another catastrophic incident like
the fatal 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion
(Fears 2017). Such research has the potential
to improve health and stability in areas where
mining and marine oil drilling operations occur.
In June 2018, DOI’s Inspector General found
that DOI officials failed to provide sufficient
documents justifying the decision to stop the
mountaintop removal study (Fears 2018).

cancellation of office of population affairs
research grants
In 2017, two Title X research grants funded
by the Office of  Population Affairs (OPA) were
abruptly cancelled. The first was a five-year grant
to the Guttmacher Institute, a leading research
and policy organization focusing on domestic
and global reproductive and sexual health. This
grantee was notified at the start of  year four that
the grant was being cut short “due to changes in
program priorities” (Manning 2017); Guttmacher
had long had a grant agreement with OPA to
assess the need for provision and impact of

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  9

publicly funded family planning services in the
United States. A second grant, for three years to
the University of  California–San Francisco, was
shortened to one year, also under the auspices of
the federal government’s changing programmatic
priorities. This grant supported research to validate
a patient-reported outcome performance measure
of  contraceptive counseling.

OPA’s FY 2018 grant opportunities
make no mention of the word
“contraception” and invite applications
for abstinence-only education and
natural family planning, as opposed to
providers offering comprehensive family
planning care for those most in need.

undermining the title X program’s ability
to support Quality, evidence-based care
Title X grants are typically three years in length.
In 2017, all Title X grantees were notified their
projects had been shortened so that they would
end in 2018. Several grantees were only in the
first year of  what were originally three-year
grants. Similar to the shortening of  the TPP
Program grants, no specific reason was given
to grantees. Subsequently, OPA released an FY
2018 FOA that makes no mention of  the word
“contraception” and invites applications for
abstinence-only education and natural family
planning, as opposed to providers offering com-
prehensive family planning care for those most
in need (National Family Planning and Reproductive
Health Association v. Azar 2018). It also fails to
mention nationally recognized clinical standards
for quality family planning (Coleman et al. 2018).
In August 2018, OPA awarded service grants to
several organizations that responded to the FOA,
but the grants last only seven months, rather
than the three years that have been standard
(NFPRHA 2018).

proposeD solutions
Federal agencies must consider scientific informa-
tion when making health and environmental poli-
cy decisions, and the use of  scientific information
must be protected from undue influence. Con-
gress has an important oversight role, which can
minimize the politicization of  science, promote
transparency, and bolster the use of  the best avail-
able science in agency decision-making. Specific
recommendations include:

Federal agencies must make health
and environmental policy decisions
based on scientific information, and
the information must be protected
from undue influence.

•	 Congress	should	conduct	hearings	on	issues
of  political interference in science and seek
information from agencies through letters and
subpoenas. Congress should also encourage
Government Accountability Office and
Inspector General investigations where
appropriate.

•	 Congress	should	use	the	appropriations	process
to protect the scientific enterprise by ensuring
that funds are spent as Congress intended and
rejecting attempts to politicize science through

cuts or policy riders that harm the scientific
process or impede the use of  science in
decision-making.

•	 Congress	should	pass	legislation	that	codifies
protections for science and reject legislation
that would harm agencies’ use of  science in
policymaking. Especially when unsuccessful
and harmful legislative ideas are being pro-
mulgated as agency policy (e.g., the Secret
Science Reform Act), proactive protections
for science are crucial.

•	 When	considering	confirmation	of 	an	admin-
istration’s nominees, senators should consider
nominees’ records of  either supporting or
undermining science. It is imperative that
Congress use its imbued powers to safeguard
our nation’s health and well-being by making
sure that federal agency leaders are committed
to using the best available information, includ-
ing independent, peer-reviewed science.

conclusion
When science is politicized, agencies and the
public are denied access to independent infor-
mation and unable to make fully informed
decisions. We as a nation need to ensure that
we are addressing the pressing issues facing
communities by using and disseminating
accurate, high-quality scientific information.

Threats to Science Advisory
Committees and Science Advice
The federal government has traditionally

who receive industry funding, so the result has
been to increase the number of  industry-affiliated
committee members while decreasing the number
of  academics (Reed et al. 2018). Committees
affected by the directive include the Science
Advisory Board (SAB), which provides advice

relied upon scientific advice from the
president’s science advisor, the White
House Office of  Science and Technology

Policy, the President’s Council on Science and
Technology, and advisory committees across
federal agencies. Many federal agencies and even
the White House have failed to take advantage of
this science advice infrastructure, and the current
administration has even issued sweeping direc-
tives that undercut many such advisory bodies
(Reed et al. 2018). This section examines several
of  the most egregious cases of  sidelining science
advice under this administration and explains
why these changes erode public trust and inter-
fere with people’s ability to make decisions about
their health and lives with the best available
information.

environmental protection agency
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
has 22 advisory committees operating under the
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), six of
which are dedicated to providing scientific advice
to the agency (EPA 2018b). On October 31,
2017, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt issued
a directive that banned academic scientists who
receive grants from EPA from serving on EPA
federal advisory committees (Pruitt 2017a). He
gave them a choice: either give up their grants
and remain on the committees, or keep their
grants and resign. The stated reason for then-
Administrator Pruitt’s policy shift was to obtain
independent advice and avoid conflicts of  interest
associated with the receipt of  research funding
from EPA. However, no parallel prohibition was
made for industry scientists or academic scientists

on scientific issues and assessments that cut across
the agency; the Board of  Scientific Counselors
(BOSC), which provides an independent review
of  EPA’s research program; and the Clean Air
Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), which
stems from a Clean Air Act requirement that an
independent scientific advisory committee review
EPA’s scientific criteria for setting national ambi-
ent air quality standards and recommend to the
administrator any new standards and revisions
of  existing standards.
  This disingenuous definition of  “conflict of
interest” is both unnecessary and harmful. EPA
already has policies and processes in place to
prevent advisors with conflicts of  interest from
serving on committees (EPA 2018c). The organi-
zations and processes for selecting advisory com-
mittee members and managing the advisory
committees are completely separate from those
involved in the grant award process. The SAB
staff is located in the Office of  the Administrator
and is responsible for the management of  both

12  |  Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help

SAB and CASAC. Potential committee members
are screened by staff for expertise and potential
conflicts of  interest before they are allowed to
participate in any new advisory activities. They
are hired as special government employees and
are paid for their service to the agency. Grants,
meanwhile, are awarded by EPA’s Office of
Research and Development to applicants in a

highly competitive process in which proposals
are judged first for their scientific merit and
second for their relevance to EPA’s mission, EPA’s
research objectives, and the needs of  its program
offices. Ana Diez Roux, former chair of  CASAC,
said, “The top scientists, the ones most qualified
to provide objective and transparent scientific
advice to EPA, are of  course the scientists who
will likely be the most successful at obtaining
highly competitive federal grants. . . . It would
be a disservice to the American public to exclude
those most qualified from serving on these panels”
(Thulin 2017).
  Former Administrator Pruitt followed through
on his policy shift by not renewing the committee
membership of  academic scientists whose terms
expired in 2017, even though past practice was
to renew members for a second term if  they
had provided sustained public service in their
first three-year terms. In all, then-Administrator
Pruitt replaced 21 of  42 members of  the SAB.
The BOSC has not fared any better. It has been
so depleted by terminations and resignations that
it was forced to cancel five subcommittee hearings
for lack of  membership (Whitehouse 2017). As
of  October 2018, the BOSC page of  the EPA
website lists no scheduled meetings (EPA 2018d).

  When Administrator Pruitt resigned and was
replaced by Andrew Wheeler as acting adminis-
trator, it was not clear whether Wheeler would
follow his predecessor’s footsteps by continuing
to erode science advice at EPA. While Acting Ad-
ministrator Wheeler publicly stated his intention
to “seek the facts” from EPA staff, he also told the
Washington Post that he understood “the desire to
make sure that the people serving on the board
weren’t also benefiting from science grants from
the agency” (Dennis and Eilperin 2018). Further, he
allowed EPA to eliminate scientific review panels
for ozone and particulate matter, almost ensuring
that future air pollution decisions will not be fully
informed by the best available science, which
violates the Clean Air Act (Goldman 2018).

Department of the interior
At DOI, Secretary Ryan Zinke announced in
May 2017 that the department would be formally
reviewing the “charter and charge” of  its 200-plus
advisory committees and would postpone all
scheduled meetings through the fall (Streater
2017). At the end of  the review period, DOI
disbanded its Advisory Committee on Climate
Change and Natural Resource Science. This
committee had been charged with helping  advise
the Secretary on managing natural resources
in the face of  climate change (Doyle and
Patterson 2017).
  Additionally, when the freeze was finally lifted
on some DOI advisory committees, a new charter
for at least one committee had shifted its mem-
bership breakdown to favor industry interests.
DOI’s Royalty Policy Committee (RPC) was
established in 2004 to make decisions about the
revenues collected from resource extraction leases
on federal and tribal lands (GSA 2017). Secretary
Zinke changed the charter of  the committee
and recommissioned it, shifting the committee’s
balance by including one fewer member repre-
senting the public and one more representing
the energy industry (Peterson 2017). Further,
all of  the “public interest” RPC members come
from academia or even industry; none of  them
represent NGOs or advocacy organizations. In
other words, the committee effectively has no

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  13

members representing the public interest (Peter-
son 2017). The Committee has also operated
largely in secret and with the participation of
members who appear to violate DOI regulations
governing conflicts of  interest. This incarnation
of  the RPC seems to have supplanted the Ex-
tractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
Multi-Stakeholder Group advisory committee,
a committee with a chartered interest in transpar-
ency and a balanced roster of  stakeholders that
historically included at least four members repre-
senting the public. The EITI met 21 times from
2013 through 2017, but has been effectively
suspended since early 2017 (POGO 2017). A
lawsuit challenging DOI’s formation and mainte-
nance of  the RPC is pending in the District of
Montana.
  Relatedly, in January 2018, 10 of  12 members
of  the National Park System Advisory Board
resigned before their positions were set to expire
because the department had failed to schedule
meetings, and they felt their requests to engage
had been ignored (Eilperin 2018). This commit-
tee is usually composed of  social and natural
science academics and in the past has advised
DOI on issues ranging from how to better
encourage children to visit national parks to how
the National Park System can mitigate impacts
of  climate change.

Department of labor
Similar inactivity was experienced by committee
members at DOL, specifically at the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
Four out of  five of  OSHA’s advisory committees
failed to meet in 2017, including the National
Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety
and Health and the Whistleblower Protection
Advisory Committee. Though these committees
are not designated as “science advisory commit-
tees,” the work that they do affects scientists and
science policy at the agency. At DOL, these com-
mittees are critical because, among other respon-
sibilities, they make recommendations that ad-
vance strong science-based workplace protections
for construction workers, help sick nuclear plant

facility workers obtain health benefits, and assist
in guiding the implementation of  science-based
safeguards that protect workers from exposure to
harmful substances like beryllium. Additionally,
some of  these committees help answer emerging
questions and provide guidance to strengthen
compliance with the 22 whistleblower statutes
administered by OSHA (Jones 2018).

proposeD solutions
As independent and informed science in the
government remains as crucial as ever, all voices
must continue to raise the political price of  side-
lining science. Members of  Congress have made
some strong inquiries throughout the year about
changes to advisory committees, but could do
more to protect the science advice structure at
the federal agencies and to continue to improve
the transparency and objectivity of  these bodies.
By enacting the following recommendations,
Congress can protect against political interfer-
ence, rampant conflicts of  interest, and public
mistrust. Specific recommendations include:

As independent and informed science

ever, all voices must continue to raise
the political price of sidelining science.

Congress should enact legislation

diminish the objectivity of science
advisory committees.

the legislation should extend FACA rules to
advisory committees organized by federal con-
tractors, not just committees convened directly
by an agency. In addition, representatives
and nonvoting members who regularly attend
meetings should be asked to provide informa-
tion on affiliation and conflicts of  interest.

conclusion
The science advice apparatus is crucial for the
federal government’s ability to make informed
decisions on policies that affect our public health
and safety. The advisors who serve on committees
lend an objective eye that functions as assurance

to the public that the government will be held
accountable for making evidence-based decisions
and protecting the public interest. A review of
meeting and membership data from 73 science
advisory committees across several agencies
found that science advisory committees at the
Department of  Energy (DOE), DOI, and EPA
have met less often in 2017 than at any time since
1997. Additionally, fewer experts serve on science
advisory committees at DOE, EPA, and the
Department of  Commerce than at any time since
1997 (Reed et al. 2018). While politicization of
advisory committees has occurred in previous
administrations, what sets recent incidents apart
are the dramatic process alterations that will
have significant impacts on membership, the
dissolution of  committees whose work was not in
line with the administration’s regulatory agenda,
and appointments of  conflicted individuals to
advisory committees that compromise the
objectivity of  these bodies.

Installing Unqualified and
Conflicted Government Leaders
Congress created federal agencies  to

carry out important functions, and
strong leadership is essential to effi-
cient and effective agency performance.

The current administration has
filled several key cabinet positions
with individuals who lack the bare
minimum of relevant and appropriate
qualifications.

Appointees should have the necessary qualifica-
tions to lead their agencies or programs, and
should be free from conflicts of  interest that
would prevent them from carrying out the
agencies’ missions. Some nominees are subject
to Senate confirmation, but many others are
appointed without input from Congress. Both
chambers have a responsibility for overseeing
appointees’ activities. This section gives examples
of  unqualified and conflicted appointees and dis-
cusses the possibility of  appointees transitioning
to civil service positions and outlasting an admin-
istration. We recommend steps Congress can take
to encourage administrations to select qualified
appointees who will advance their agencies’
missions.

unQualifieD appointees
The current administration has filled several
key cabinet positions with individuals who lack
the bare minimum of  relevant and appropriate
qualifications. Elected officials of  different poli-
tical backgrounds may have different preferences
for appointees, but should agree that a certain
minimum level of  qualification is essential:
Appointees should possess the subject-matter
knowledge and management expertise necessary
to fulfill their designated roles, and should not
have demonstrated through words or action
that they oppose the statutory missions of  the
agencies they are appointed to lead. Several

recent political appointees do not meet these
minimal standards.

environmental protections
Before he was nominated and confirmed as EPA
administrator, a position from which he has now
resigned, Scott Pruitt’s LinkedIn page described
him as “a leading advocate against the EPA’s
activist agenda” (Davenport and Lipton 2017).
As Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt sued
the agency repeatedly to overturn rules to limit
air pollution from power plants and protect wet-
lands (Mosbergen 2017); as EPA administrator,
he rolled back regulatory and enforcement activi-
ties designed to protect public health (Popovich,
Albeck-Ripka, and Pierre-Louis 2018; Lipton and
Ivory 2017). Contrary to overwhelming evidence,
he has stated that he is not convinced that carbon
dioxide from human activity is the main driver
of  climate change (Chiacu and Volcovici 2017).
Past EPA administrators have held different
positions about the extent to which the agency
should regulate pollutants, but former adminis-
trator Pruitt was unique in his apparent opposition
to the agency’s very mission of  assuring a healthy
environment and his unwillingness to accept the

16  |  Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help

consensus of  the scientific community on one of
the most pressing environmental issues of  our time.

agricultural science
President Trump nominated Sam Clovis to the
U.S. Department of  Agriculture’s top science post
despite his lack of  academic credentials in hard
science, and despite the Congressional require-
ment to have a qualified scientist fill the position
(Green 2017). His withdrawal from consideration
for head of  the agency’s Research, Education and
Economics division came amidst revelations about
his links to Russian officials during the presidential
campaign, rather than in acknowledgment of  his
lack of  appropriate qualifications (Eilperin 2017b).

family planning
At HHS, the deputy assistant secretary for popu-
lation affairs oversees the Title X family planning
program—yet the most recent appointees have
histories of  promoting abstinence over compre-
hensive contraceptive care and advancing claims
not supported by scientific evidence. Former
Deputy Assistant Secretary Teresa Manning,

who held the position from May 2017 to January
2018, previously claimed “contraception doesn’t
work” (Lanktree 2017), despite extensive evidence
to the contrary. Her replacement, Deputy Assis-
tant Secretary Diane Foley, previously served as
executive director of  Education for a Lifetime,
which promotes abstinence to middle and high
school students with claims such as “[b]ecoming
sexually active before marriage makes it harder
to have a good marriage later” (Lane 2010), despite
a lack of  credible evidence of  such a causal rela-
tionship. Foley has also suggested that abortion is

unsafe (Browne 2016) because this form of  care is
insufficiently regulated, despite extensive evidence
of  abortion’s safety and the fact that it is already
more heavily regulated than other healthcare
services that carry similar risks (CRHS 2018;
Jones, Daniel, and Cloud 2018).
  When an administration selects unqualified
appointees to lead agencies or programs, it hobbles
agencies’ ability to carry out their Congressionally
mandated missions and use government resources
efficiently. The consequences for public health
and our economy can be severe. Programs that
safeguard our air and water quality and that
help low-income individuals access contraception
allow more people to enjoy good health and par-
ticipate fully in their families, workplaces, and
communities. Appointees who lack understanding
or appreciation for how these programs work
can undo years of  public health accomplish-
ments, such as the recent decline in the teen
pregnancy rate.

appointees with conflicts
of interest
Numerous political appointees across the federal
government, both those who received Senate
confirmation and those who did not require
confirmation, have brought with them a variety
of  conflicts of  interest, including ties to particular
companies or industry groups. In many cases,
these officials have either been appointed using
a special hiring authority that exempts them from
the Trump Ethics Pledge, or they have simply
been given a waiver to do work directly related
to the interests of  their former employers or
clients. Some appointees also have personal
financial relationships with lobbyists or companies
that pose or appear to pose a direct conflict with
their government duties.

various epa employees
In March 2018, the Associated Press reported
that, of  59 EPA appointees they tracked over
the previous year, approximately one-third had
worked as lobbyists or lawyers for industries regu-
lated by EPA, including chemical manufacturers

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  17

and fossil fuel producers (Biesecker, Linderman,
and Lardner 2018). Although a presidential
executive order barred appointees who worked
as registered lobbyists in the two years prior to
their appointments from participating in matters
related to their previous work, many of  these
appointees received ethics waivers to work on
topics involving their former employers. Others
appeared to violate the policy and did not receive
waivers (Biesecker, Linderman, and Lardner 2018).
  Nancy Beck worked as an executive for the
chemical industry’s main trade association until
assuming the position of  deputy assistant admin-
istrator of  EPA’s Office of  Chemical Safety. In
her current role, she exercises substantial influ-
ence over regulations; staff members told the New
York Times that Deputy Assistant Administrator
Beck instructed them to rewrite standards to
reflect the chemical industry’s preferred changes
(Lipton 2017). Beck’s position was “administra-
tively determined”—a category that is neither a
political appointee nor competitively hired civil
servant, and is typically reserved for technical
experts rather than managers—and so she was
not covered by the ethics requirement. A provi-
sion to the Safe Drinking Water Act allows EPA
to hire up to 30 people without Senate or White
House approval so that experts can be brought
on board quickly; instead, former EPA Adminis-
trator Scott Pruitt hired ex-lobbyists and several
other aides, Beck among them, through this
provision (Grandoni 2018a).
  Before his confirmation as EPA deputy admin-
istrator in April 2018, now-Acting Administrator
Wheeler spent nine years working as a consultant
and lobbyist for fossil fuel companies (Hirsher
2018). His client list included coal mining firm
Murray Energy, which sued EPA over multiple
regulations, including the Clean Power Plan
(Restuccia, Guillén, and Adragna 2017).
Although an agency spokesperson has stated
that Wheeler consults with EPA ethics officials
and will recuse himself  when potential conflicts
arise, it is difficult to imagine how he can perform
his duties fully while avoiding matters that affect
his former clients.

secretary of the interior ryan Zinke
When nominated to serve as Secretary of  the
Interior, Ryan Zinke failed to disclose that he held
1,000 shares in a private company that manufac-
tures firearms and advanced weapons materials
(Vardi 2018). Secretary Zinke and his top aides
met with company executives in April 2017, his

official calendar shows, and Secretary Zinke has
signed secretarial orders and proposed a rule to
allow more hunting and gun-carrying on public
lands (Vardi 2018).
  Like other senior political appointees, Secre-
tary Zinke has also come under scrutiny for his
use of  costly flights. DOI’s Office of  Inspector
General determined that Secretary Zinke followed
the policies for most of  the chartered and military
flights he took in FY 2017, but that a $12,357
charter flight from Las Vegas to Kalispell, Montana,
likely would not have been approved if  ethics
officials had received complete information about
it—namely, that the speech Secretary Zinke gave
did not mention DOI. Another pertinent detail
ethics staff lacked was that the speech was delivered
to a hockey team owned by a donor to Zinke’s
Congressional campaign (OIG 2018).

In July 2018, DOI’s inspector general

announced an investigation of  a real estate deal
involving a foundation Zinke established and
a development team that includes the chair of
oil services company Halliburton. The deal
could raise the land value of  properties Secre-
tary Zinke owns in Whitefish, Montana, and one
of  its major players could benefit substantially
from decisions Secretary Zinke makes about
oil and gas development on federal lands
(Lefebvre 2018).

former cDc Director brenda fitzgerald
Following her appointment as director of  CDC,
Brenda Fitzgerald had to recuse herself  from
multiple matters related to her investments. Seven
months after assuming her role, she was still
unable to testify before Congress on issues such as
the opioid crisis and cancer detection (Haberkorn
and Ehley 2018). She resigned after reporters
discovered that she had purchased tobacco stocks
while working at CDC (Kaplan 2018; Karlin-
Smith and Ehley 2018). Having a director unable
to participate on key public health issues and then
facing an abrupt leadership change is challenging
for any agency; it is especially worrisome when
the agency in question is charged with responding
to public health threats such as foodborne illness
outbreaks and Ebola.

rowing”—only if  the Office of  Personnel Man-
agement determines that the agency’s hiring process
follows merit system requirements. In March
2018, the House of  Representatives passed H.R.
1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Preven-
tion Act (H.R. 1132 2017), which would prohibit
appointees from obtaining career civil service
positions for two years after separation from the
political position; a related bill (S. 2581 2018)
has been introduced in the Senate and referred
to the Committee on Homeland Security
and Governmental Affairs.

proposeD solutions
Congress has a responsibility to ensure that fed-
eral agencies are led and staffed by appropriate,
qualified, and unconflicted nominees. Both
senators and representatives should make full use
of  the tools at their disposal to ensure that this
happens. Specific recommendations include:

•	 The	U.S.	Senate,	through	its	confirmation

powers, is responsible for ensuring that federal
agencies are led by qualified, unconflicted
individuals. When nominees are subject to
Senate confirmation, senators should use their
advise and consent powers to vet the back-
grounds of  appointees, and vote against those
with conflicts of  interest or who demonstrate
a clear lack of  competence. Some nominees
have withdrawn their names from consider-
ation after concerns came to light. For example,
Michael Dourson, who was nominated to
oversee EPA’s chemical safety division despite
a long history of  helping companies that use
toxic compounds fight EPA regulatory efforts
(Kaplan and Lipton 2017a), withdrew from
consideration after facing bipartisan opposition
from senators (Kaplan and Lipton 2017b).

•	 Many	appointees	do	not	require	Senate
confirmation, and representatives do not
vote on any nominees, but this does not
mean Congress lacks influence. Members of
Congress can raise concerns about unqualified
and conflicted appointees through oversight
hearings, requests for information from agency
heads, and requests for Inspector General
investigations. Representatives can also use
subpoena power to investigate conflicts. For
instance, Representatives Donald Beyer and
Gerald Connolly requested that EPA’s Inspector
General investigate the process by which then-
Administrator Pruitt appointed former banker
Albert Kelly—who had no relevant qualifications
and had recently been fined by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation—to lead a
Superfund task force (Beyer and Connolly
2018). Days later, Kelly resigned (Lerner 2018).

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  19

•	 Congress	should	pass	legislation	such	as

the Executive Branch Comprehensive Ethics
Enforcement Act (H.R. 5902 2018; S. 2919
2018) to give the Office of  Government Ethics
(OGE) enforcement power. Currently, OGE
can identify violations of  ethics laws and
regulations but cannot compel compliance.
The Executive Branch Comprehensive Ethics
Enforcement Act would empower OGE to
enforce federal ethics laws and regulations
and allow it to compile all the relevant ethics
records. It would grant OGE’s director the
ability to request subpoenas from a federal
court to gather necessary information, and
report OGE findings directly to Congress;
authorize the agency to order corrective
actions, such as divestiture or recusal; and
establish OGE as the central repository for
ethics records deemed public information by
law or by the director, and make these records
available online in a searchable format.

•	 Congress	should	ensure	that	hiring	authority
under the Safe Drinking Water Act discour-
ages the hiring of  staff without approval and
without the same ethics requirements that
apply to other appointees.

•	 Congress	should	pass	legislation	such	as	the
Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention
Act that limits the conversion of  political
appointees to career civil servants.

Members of Congress can raise
concerns about unqualified and
conflicted appointees through hearings,
letters to agency heads, and requests
for Inspector General investigations.

conclusion
For agencies to fulfill their statutory mandates,
they must have leaders who agree with the
agency’s mission and are free from conflicts
of  interest that could compromise confidence
in their decisions. When administrations install
appointees who lack these basic qualifications,
agency performance and public trust suffer—
with potentially grave consequences for public
health and the environment. Congress should
use its oversight power to raise concerns about
unqualified and conflicted nominees; develop
stronger mechanisms for monitoring recusals
and ethics waivers; and close the loopholes that
make it easier for unqualified and conflicted
appointees to gain and keep influential positions
at federal agencies.

Reduced Communications
from Scientific Agencies
One of  the most important functions

of  scientific agencies1 is to communi-
cate the results of  scientific research to
the public and Congress in an accurate

and the public to access to scientific information.

and timely manner. In some cases, reports  to
Congress and the public are required by law.
However, political appointees are increasingly
censoring and suppressing scientific information,
as well as deterring federal scientists from com-
municating openly with the public and the press.
Such ideologically motivated constraints leave
the public without important information regard-
ing threats to public health and safety. Moreover,
suppression of  science can lead to poor policy-
making when policymakers are unable to access

the best available scientific information. This
section discusses instances in which federal depart-
ments and agencies have deliberately censored or
suppressed the normal flow of  communications
associated with scientific research. We recom-
mend remedies to ensure our nation continues to
benefit from dissemination of  taxpayer-supported
research.
  The following examples highlight some of  the
most concerning developments that have limited

censorship of scientific research
Censoring scientific research results in decision-
makers and the public having less information
about hazards that could affect their health and
well-being. Some particularly troubling examples
of  such censorship that have come to light involve
chemical hazards and climate change.

the white house blocks atsDr study
addressing the toxicity of common pollutants
In May 2018, emails uncovered through the
Freedom of  Information Act revealed that Trump
administration officials sought to block publica-
tion of  a draft toxicological profile examining the
health risks associated with exposure to per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) because the
report would be a “public relations nightmare”
(Snider 2018). PFAS are synthetic chemicals
found in everything from nonstick cookware
to firefighting foam and are highly persistent in
the environment and human body (EPA 2018e).
According to the emails, the profile, created by
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry (ATSDR), found that these chemicals
pose health risks at levels far lower than those
EPA had previously deemed safe (Snider 2018).
Significant bipartisan Congressional pressure
followed public exposure of  this suppression, and
the report was released in June 2018. This study
indeed found that the risk levels for PFAS are
7 to 10 times lower than EPA’s current standards

1  “Scientific agencies” refers to agencies that engage in generating and/or using scientific research.

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  21

(ATSDR 2018). Shortly before ATSDR released
the report, EPA held a summit to discuss PFAS,
but excluded most journalists and community
groups (Wallace 2018).

nps attempts to remove references
to human-caused climate change
A study commissioned by the National Park
Service (NPS) to assess the potential effects of
sea level rise on national parks located in coastal
areas drew the attention of  NPS employees who
attempted to remove references in the report to
human-caused climate change (Shogren 2018a).
The author, Maria Caffrey, a paleoclimatologist
at the University of  Colorado, fought to retain
the language (Shogren 2018b). Following a Reveal
news story about the issue and requests from
members of  Congress for an Inspector General
investigation (Shogren 2018a; Shogren 2018c),
the final report was issued with references to
human-caused climate change included
(Shogren 2018a).

removal of publicly available
scientific information on climate
change
In multiple instances, agencies have removed
previously available climate-change content from
the public domain. These deletions deprive the
public of  access to taxpayer-supported scientific
information and represent a failure on the part
of  these agencies to fulfill their duty to keep the
public informed about threats to our health.

fema removes climate change
from its strategic plan
The Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), the federal government entity respon-
sible for responding to natural disasters such as
floods and hurricanes, eliminated mentions of
climate change from its strategic planning docu-
ment for 2018–2022 (Flavelle 2018a). The new
strategic planning document acknowledges that
there is a “rising natural hazard risk,” but does
not mention that climate change is expected to
exacerbate that risk (FEMA 2018). This contrasts

sharply with FEMA’s last strategic plan, which
not only made explicit mention of  climate change
but required any state seeking funding for disaster
preparedness to assess the threat posed by climate
change (Gustin 2018).

On December 20, 2017, NPS
removed 92 documents describing
climate action plans for various
national parks from its website.

nps Deletes Documents relating to climate
change from its website
On December 20, 2017, NPS removed 92 docu-
ments describing climate action plans for various
national parks from its website (Bergman, Gehrke,
and Rinberg 2017a). Those documents contained
information about how certain national parks are
responding to climate change. NPS said at the
time that the documents with information about
climate change had been removed for compliance
reasons, and would be put back up by January 18,
2018 (Rinberg et al. 2017). As of  this writing,
however, several of  the links to the climate action
plans for member parks either still did not work
or came up with old versions. As a result, regional
park managers do not have access to current
resources that would help them address the effects
of  climate change on their parks and ensure
 sustainable operations, and the public no longer
has access to valuable information about the
environmental changes affecting their
communities.

epa website relaunches without
scientific materials
In April 2017, EPA removed the “Climate and
Energy Resources for State, Local, and Tribal
Governments” section from its website. Three
months later, EPA relaunched the website as
“Energy Resources for State, Local, and Tribal
Governments,” without the reference to climate.
The new site deleted references to climate change

22  |  Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help

and removed multiple links to materials aimed at
helping local officials prepare for climate change
impacts (Bergman, Gehrke, and Rinberg 2017b).
This action directly harms the ability of  state,
local, and tribal governments to access science-
based information about climate change and to
respond to it in an effective and timely way in
order to protect their citizens.

In October 2017 EPA barred three
EPA researchers from giving planned
presentations on climate change at
a conference in Rhode Island about
the health of Narragansett Bay.

preventing scientists from
attenDing anD presenting at
scientific conferences
Restricting scientists’ ability to communicate
with their scientific peers and members of  the
press limits the flow of  knowledge and can
damage agencies’ ability to attract and retain
staff with valuable expertise.

blocking scientists from attending and
presenting at scientific conferences
Several federal agency scientists have seen their
speaking engagements cancelled, particularly at
professional scientific conferences. For example,
in October 2017 EPA at the last minute barred
three EPA researchers from giving planned
presentations on climate change at a conference
in Rhode Island about the health of  Narragansett
Bay. The scientists who were prevented from
speaking, one of  whom was slated to give the
keynote address, made substantial contributions
to a 400-page report on the subject (Friedman
2017). A few months later, EPA did something
similar when it prevented 17 agency staffers from
attending the Alaska Forum on the Environment,
a conference that focuses on climate-related
issues (Flavelle and Dloughy 2017).
  This problem is not limited to EPA. In April
2017, at least 27 DOE scientists who were

scheduled to attend the International Atomic
Energy Agency Conference were told they could
no longer do so (Negin 2017). In October 2017,
Scientific American reported that William Jolly, a
research ecologist with the Forest Service, was
denied approval to attend a conference where
he was scheduled to give a presentation about
the role of  climate change in wildfire conditions
(Patterson 2017). A few months later, DOI more
than halved the number of  U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) scientists allowed to attend the
annual meeting of  the American Geophysical
Union (Kaplan 2017). Then on May 3, 2018, the
Washington Post reported that the Bureau of  Land
Management (BLM) blocked at least 14 employees,
including archaeologists, from attending the annual
meeting of  the Society for American Archaeology,
a major scientific conference. The BLM archae-
ologists were scheduled to give a presentation at
a symposium on “Tough Issues in Land Manage-
ment Archaeology,” but that symposium had to
be cancelled because the BLM scientists could
not participate (Grandoni 2018b).
  Cancelling federal scientists’ speaking engage-
ments at the last minute or preventing scientists
from attending conferences entirely is deeply con-
cerning for several reasons. First, these examples
seem to be politically motivated attempts to silence
scientific discussion around climate change or
other issues agency leadership considers conten-
tious. More broadly, attending and presenting
at professional conferences is fundamental to
the development of  scientists’ careers and to the
furtherance of  their research. Such gatherings
provide crucial opportunities to share ideas and
learn about the latest developments in the field,
as well as to network and develop relationships.
If  government scientists are deprived of  these
opportunities, not only will government research
suffer, but talented researchers will see this as a
reason not to pursue a career in government.

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  23

must allow their scientists to speak freely to the
media about their research. Increasingly, how-
ever, agencies are attempting to use restrictive
public affairs or public relations policies to
control the information their scientists can
communicate.
  On May 3, 2017, Lance Leggitt, then-chief
of  staff for HHS, sent a memorandum to em-
ployees mandating that communications with
members of  Congress and staff could not occur
without prior consultation with the Office of  the
Assistant Secretary for Legislation (Leggitt 2017).
CDC took similar action on August 31, 2017,
when a public affairs officer sent an email to
CDC employees informing them that they were
no longer allowed to correspond in any way with
the news media without prior approval from
CDC’s Atlanta Communications Office (Baker
2017). At the USGS, a new policy required
scientists to get permission before speaking to
reporters about science (Lin 2018). After report-
ers linked to the policy, it was removed from its
previous location and buried deep in the website
of  DOI, USGS’s parent agency (Halpern 2018).
  Prompted by a complaint from the Govern-
ment Accountability Project, the Office of  Special
Counsel (OSC) conducted an investigation into
whether the incidents at HHS and CDC violated
5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(13) of  the Whistleblower Pro-
tection Act, which prohibits the implementation
or enforcement of  a non-disclosure policy that
would gag employees from exercising their rights
to raise concern about agency operations (Giaccio
2018a). OSC found that there was no violation
because HHS later took “full corrective action”
by informing agency employees of  their rights
to communicate with Congress and to make
disclosures without agency clearance (Giaccio
2018a). However, this kind of  post-hoc remedy—
informing employees of  their rights after senior
management has issued repeated directives to

Agency scientific integrity policies

scientists being able to communicate
with the press and with the public
about their work in order to maintain
scientific integrity.

employees not to exercise those rights—is hardly
adequate to undo the chilling effect on employee
communication.2
  For political appointees to attempt to control
what agency scientists share about their scientific
research and knowledge is extremely troubling.
Agency scientific integrity policies generally
emphasize the importance of  scientists being able
to communicate with the press and with the pub-
lic about their work. These new restrictions on
communications at agencies represent a flagrant
violation of  both the letter and the spirit of  those
scientific integrity policies. Agency public affairs
officials are increasingly acting as gatekeepers
and campaigners, not as facilitators of  infor-
mation flow. This pattern reduces government
accountability and robs states, journalists, and
the public of  access to scientific expertise.

impacts
Breakdowns in federal agency communication
of  scientific information have myriad negative
consequences. First, state, local, and tribal govern-
ments—as well as federal agencies charged with
protecting public health and safety and managing
shared resources or hazards—require access to
scientific data and information they can use to
develop policies and plan for the future. When
agencies like CDC remove information from their
websites or prevent their scientists from commu-
nicating with the public, it becomes harder for

2  Similar directives aimed at barring employees from speaking with Congress or the press have been issued recently, including

from the Department of  Agriculture, DOI, EPA, the Department of  Transportation, and DOJ. Even if  the directives have been
subsequently “remedied” by informing employees that gag orders do not supersede their whistleblower rights or rights to communi-
cate with Congress, the initial message is clear: senior agency management will be hostile to employees who communicate without
prior approval. See Shelbourne 2017; Lartey 2017; Giaccio 2018b.

government at every level to understand, plan for,
and mitigate public health risks, environmental
dangers, and safety threats.
  When agencies fail to communicate about
science it also means that the public itself  has
less direct access to science and evidence-based
information. This, too, negatively affects public

or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste
of  funds, abuse of  authority, dangers to public
health and safety, or scientific censorship that
would result in these forms of  misconduct. Such
practices foster opacity rather than the transpar-
ency that is essential to an accountable, responsive
democracy.

Censorship and chilled communication
undermine accountability by weakening
Congress’s ability to engage in oversight
of the executive branch and to ensure
that federal agencies are fulfilling their
public missions.

health. For example, if  agency scientists conduct
research that determines that air or water pollut-
ants pose health risks in certain communities, but
the agency fails to communicate that information
to the public, citizens in those communities may
experience preventable harm.

In addition to these direct negative impacts
on public health and good governance, agencies’
failure to communicate freely about science
creates a culture in which scientists self-censor.
Scientists may not pursue research projects on
topics that are important but disfavored by political
appointees, because there is an explicit or implicit
message that they are not welcome. The result
is that science becomes politicized, the entire
scientific endeavor suffers, and both the public
and governmental entities are deprived of  im-
portant new scientific data and information
that could be used in policymaking.
  Finally, censorship and chilled communication
undermine accountability by weakening Con-
gress’s ability to engage in oversight of  the execu-
tive branch and to ensure that federal agencies
are fulfilling their public missions. Censorship can
occur both through suppression or removal and
by creating a culture where employees are afraid
to exercise their rights to report information they
reasonably believe evidences a violation of  law

proposeD solutions
Despite the importance of  open and informative
agency communications, current practices and
legal structures often leave agency employees who
become aware of  censorship or suppression of
scientific information few effective mechanisms
for correcting such situations. Congress should
take several actions to ensure that agencies both
communicate scientific information and develop-
ments appropriately and allow their scientists
to do so as well.

encourage agencies to strengthen
scientific integrity policies
In response to a presidential memorandum issued
by President Obama in 2009, many scientific
agencies have developed scientific integrity policies
explicitly stating that open communication of  the
results of  scientific studies, freedom from censor-
ship, the ability to communicate with the press,
and the ability to freely participate in professional
activities such as presenting at conferences are
all integral parts of  scientific integrity (Goldman
et al. 2017).
  While the scientific integrity policies are sound
in concept, they are generally difficult to use or
enforce to correct the kinds of  communication
failures described above because they typically
provide few specific procedural requirements
(e.g., failing to specify whether complainants are
entitled to a hearing or an appeal). Likewise, ex-
isting scientific integrity policies are largely silent
with respect to specific enforcement mechanisms
and do not obligate agencies to take any par-
ticular action if  they do find a violation.
  Members of  Congress should put
public pressure on agencies, by way of
letters, hearings, and other oversight

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  25

measures, to expand and strengthen
their scientific integrity policies to incor-
porate specific procedural protections
and enforcement mechanisms. This would
make these policies a more effective means of
addressing and correcting violations in a timely
manner.

strengthen and pass the scientific
integrity act
In addition to using its oversight authority to
encourage agencies to strengthen the scientific
integrity policies described in the 2009 presiden-
tial memorandum, Congress could address these
issues legislatively. Indeed, in early 2017 mem-
bers of  both the House and Senate introduced
a Scientific Integrity Act that would codify
the requirement that scientific agencies develop
scientific integrity policies. Passing the Scientific
Integrity Act would help to ensure that all
scientific agencies have strong scientific integrity
policies that protect both research and research-
ers. In passing the Scientific Integrity Act, Con-
gress should go even further than the initial bill
did. Congress should strengthen it by adding
requirements that agencies develop scientific
integrity policies that explicitly make attempts
at censoring scientists a violation of  scientific
integrity. Furthermore, Congress should require
agencies to develop more specific enforcement
procedures and other procedural protections
for scientists who allege a scientific integrity
violation, such as the right to a hearing and
an explicit right to appeal to a federal court.
  These kinds of  statutory protections would
go a long way toward preventing the deeply
problematic censorship of  communication from
agency scientists about their work discussed in
this chapter. Congress should strengthen
and pass the Scientific Integrity Act.

strengthen whistleblower statutes
A patchwork of  laws provides protections to
federal employees who blow the whistle on
certain kinds of  unethical or illegal behavior
within the federal government. However, existing
whistleblower laws do not currently provide much,
if  any, explicit protection for federal employees
blowing the whistle on the kinds of  reduced com-
munications about science discussed in this chapter.
  Congress should strengthen and
expand whistleblower statutes to provide
explicit protections for federal employees
blowing the whistle on censorship and
suppression of  science—regardless of
whether it constitutes waste, fraud, or
abuse. The next chapter will cover whistleblower
laws, including proposed solutions to loopholes
in the whistleblower laws, in detail.

Passing the Scientific Integrity Act
would help to ensure that all scientific
agencies have strong scientific integrity
policies that protect both research
and researchers.

conclusion
It is crucial for public health, the environment,
good governance, and the health of  the scientific
endeavor in the United States that our federal
agencies foster and conduct complete, accurate,
and timely communication of  scientific infor-
mation. However, as the examples in this chapter
illustrate, multiple agencies are failing to carry
out this responsibility in deeply troubling ways.
With the actions described above, members of
Congress can help ensure that federal agencies
communicate effectively with the public about
science.

Whistleblowing and
Scientific Integrity
Whistleblowers—employees who

report information they reasonably
believe evidences illegality; gross
mismanagement or waste of  funds;
abuse of  authority; substantial dangers to public
health, safety, or the environment; or scientific
censorship that would result in such harm—
have repeatedly been one of  the most powerful
vehicles for ensuring adherence not only to law
and policy, but to the mission of  our federal
agencies. Congressional representatives should
ensure that science, and science-based policy, are
safeguarded by protecting the rights of  federal
employees to speak out about serious abuses
of  public trust. This section highlights the im-
portance of  whistleblowing in federal scientific
agencies3 and offers prescriptive policy goals that
Congress should consider enacting to strengthen
and expand whistleblower protection rights for
employees.

whistleblowing: rights anD
risks for employees
Under the Whistleblower Protection Act of
1989 (WPA 1989), amended by the Whistleblower
Protection Enhancement Act of  2012 (WPEA
2012), most federal employees who work in the
science agencies have the right to disclose infor-
mation, free from reprisal, that they reasonably
believe evidences a violation of  law, rule, or
regulation; gross mismanagement; a gross waste
of  funds; abuse of  authority; a substantial and
specific danger to public health or safety; or cen-
sorship of  their research. These and other laws
provide federal employees with well-established,
though imperfect, rights to disclose serious abuses
of  public trust either internally (e.g., to managers,
agency Inspectors General, co-workers) or exter-
nally (e.g., to OSC, members of  Congress). If  the
information is not classified or its release specifi-
cally barred by statute, they have public freedom
of  expression with audiences like the media,
watchdog organizations, and citizen groups.
Under the WPA, whistleblowers can also “walk
the talk” by refusing to violate the law.
   Legal rights for U.S. private employees,  includ-
ing many contractors who perform scientific work
for the federal government, are more complicated.
More than 50 corporate whistleblower protection
laws exist at the federal level, along with many
state and local laws (Devine and Maassarani
2011). Each law protects, in certain cases, the
legal rights of  employees to report wrongdoing
free from reprisal and has different procedural
steps and different paths for enforcement.

Most employees stay silent in the
face of witnessing misconduct because
they fear reprisal or believe that
speaking up will not make a difference.
In a survey of corporate employees
who do speak up, 97% report concerns
internally first, variously to supervisors,
higher management, ethics officers,
and hotlines.

3  “Scientific agencies” refers to agencies that engage in generating and/or using scientific research.

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  27

Assessing the content of  the whistleblowing dis-
closure, to whom the disclosure was made, and
what kind of  reprisal was suffered by the whistle-
blower are all moving variables (Gold 2013).4
  Most employees remain silent after witnessing
misconduct because they fear reprisal or believe
that speaking up will not make a difference. In a
survey of  corporate employees who do speak up,
97% report concerns internally first, variously
to supervisors, higher management, ethics officers,
and hotlines (ERC 2012). Only when employees
are ignored or face reprisal do they consider
reporting problems externally to Congress, jour-
nalists, or non-profit watchdog organizations.
  Reprisal for whistleblowing unfortunately is
real, despite the fact that whistleblowers are often
the best, and sometimes the only, pathway toward
holding government institutions accountable,
ensuring regulatory compliance, and protecting
the public’s interest. Because it is so important to
encourage employees to report wrongdoing, even
in the most partisan periods of  Congressional
history, whistleblower protection has consistently
garnered unanimous, bipartisan support. Whis-
tleblowers can be unique resources for government
accountability, transparency, and democracy. In
essence, whistleblowing is when dedicated public
employees with insider knowledge exercise the
freedom to warn of  illegality or corruption within
their workplaces. With their expert knowledge,
whistleblowers often catalyze Congressional
oversight hearings or serve as valuable advisors
in creating effective policy.

eXamples of science-relateD
whistleblowing
From revealing gross waste of  government funds
to reporting on deadly construction flaws in

American nuclear plants, federal employees
at scientific agencies have a long tradition of
whistleblowing. Multiple administrations have
retaliated against these whistleblowers, which
can chill employees from communicating with
Congress and the public and thereby hamper
accountability. The case studies below not only
exemplify the wide variety of  issues that whistle-
blowers might address, but illustrate the impor-
tance of  whistleblowers in revealing serious
threats to the public interest.

miguel Del toral
In June 2015, Del Toral, a manager for EPA’s
Midwest water division, wrote to EPA leadership
detailing months of  study by EPA on Flint,
Michigan’s water quality. Specifically, his memo
rebuked the Michigan Department of  Environ-
mental Quality’s (MDEQ) decision to change
the city of  Flint’s water source to the Flint River
without subsequent corrosion control of  the
piping, and noted the high lead levels in Flint
resident LeeAnne Walters’ drinking water
(Del Toral 2015).
  Del Toral’s warning was ignored for weeks
at the highest levels of  EPA’s leadership. In July

2  Perhaps the most common misperception about whistleblowing is that it means leaking “classified” information. Disclosing classified
information to those without the sufficient security clearance is unprotected, because it is a federal crime and is therefore not protected
whistleblowing. Unfortunately, the aggressive prosecution of  intelligence community (IC) employees who release classified information
has fueled the misbelief  that all whistleblowing is criminal. This creates a dangerous “chilling effect” on federal employees’ legal right
to expose wrongdoing. There are lawful mechanisms for IC employees to report wrongdoing through internal channels, but they
are weak and ineffectual. Because employees fear their whistleblowing will be ignored by protected channels, some choose to risk
criminal prosecution by releasing classified information externally. The overwhelming majority of  whistleblowers are outside the
intelligence community and classification is no issue. But many intelligence and security agencies do rely heavily on science for their
missions. Although this chapter focuses primarily on non-IC employees in the science agencies, Congress should work to strengthen
channels through which IC employees may legally blow the whistle. That would strengthen national security by limiting classified
“leaks” while allowing the IC Inspector General to properly investigate whistleblower concerns.

28  |  Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help

2015 Del Toral shared his memo with Walters,
who subsequently passed it to ACLU leaders,
prompting the whirlwind of  public inquiry
into Flint’s water quality.

Flint’s nearly 100,000 residents
were exposed to unsafe levels of lead
contamination, a state of emergency
was declared, and a Legionnaires’
disease outbreak linked to the water
supply changes killed 10 people.

In retaliation, Del Toral, despite not personally
sharing the document with the ACLU, was initially
labeled as a “rogue employee” by MDEQ and
alleged that he was barred from participating in
outside meetings in reprisal for raising warnings
about Flint’s water quality (Delaney 2016).
  During this long period, Flint’s nearly 100,000
residents were exposed to unsafe levels of  lead
contamination, a state of  emergency was declared,
and a Legionnaires’ disease outbreak linked to the
water supply changes killed 10 people (Difazio
2018; Zahran et al. 2018; Southall 2016). Further-
more, 15 state officials received criminal indictments
(Ganim 2017). Today, scientists do not believe the
water is safe for Flint residents to drink (Baptiste
2018). With greater whistleblower protections that
would have required further investigation of  Del
Toral’s legitimate concerns, it is likely that the
impact of  the Flint water crisis could have been
lessened (Smith 2016).

Joel clement
Clement is a biologist who served as director of
the Office of  Policy Analysis at DOI and worked
as a top-level policy advisor for multiple presiden-
tial administrations. While at DOI, Clement—
who spent nearly seven years at the Department—
led a team studying the impacts of  climate change
upon Alaska Native communities. Yet, after
speaking publicly about the dangers climate
change poses for these remote communities,
Clement was reassigned from his senior executive

post to an accounting job collecting mineral
royalty checks (Clement 2017). Clement was one
of  dozens of  senior DOI officials reassigned in
mid-2017 with little explanation (Eilperin and Rein
2017). One-third of  those reassigned were Native
American, despite Native Americans making
up less than 10% of  DOI’s workforce (Ollstein
2018). Secretary of  the Interior Ryan Zinke had
previously testified about his intent to use reassign-
ments to eliminate employees (Clement 2017).
In July 2017, Clement filed a whistleblower
retaliation complaint with OSC. The Inspector
General’s Office determined that DOI leadership
did not consistently apply the reasons it stated for
reassignments, nor did it gather adequate infor-
mation to make informed reassignment decisions
(Barry 2018). Clement since has left the federal
government and become a public advocate
for governmental accountability and scientific
integrity (Barry 2018).

lawrence criscione
Criscione, a highly credentialed engineer and risk
analyst with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC), experienced retaliation for raising serious
concerns regarding the possibility of  major acci-
dents at a quarter of  the nation’s aging nuclear
power plants if  upstream dams fail and cause
severe flooding. As the world’s climate changes
and parts of  the United States experience severe
storms and record-breaking rainfall, nuclear
facilities face a growing risk of  cascading fail-
ures leading to core meltdown, explosions,
and the release of  highly radioactive material
(Polansky 2018).
  Duke Energy’s Oconee Nuclear Station in
South Carolina has been of  particular concern
to Criscione, who became increasingly frustrated
as his superiors ignored his repeated warnings.
He alerted the NRC Chair and sent a detailed
email (Criscione 2012) marked confidential to
Congressional staff. This email was later leaked
to the press (Zeller 2012). Instead of  addressing
Criscione’s risk assessment warnings, the NRC’s
Office of  Inspector General opened an investi-
gation into Criscione for distributing sensitive
information, even though it was his right to

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  29

communicate with Congress under the Lloyd-
La Follette Act of  1912 and civil service law
(Lochbaum 2017). The IG sought federal pros-
ecution by referring the case to a U.S. Attorney,
who rejected it for lack of  merit. Although
Criscione has been able to keep his job at the
NRC and is no longer under investigation, his
concerns have not been fully addressed (OSC
2017). He reports ongoing barriers such as being
prohibited from attending meetings regarding
nuclear plants’ flood risk and being denied access
to relevant documents. Meanwhile, severe hur-
ricanes and storms are flooding areas where these
aging nuclear power plants are located, raising
the risk of  a U.S. nuclear accident worse than
Fukushima. Criscione has filed formal whistle-
blower retaliation complaints with OSC (GAP
2015; Lawrence Criscione v. US Nuclear Regulatory
Commission 2011) and DOL. As of  late 2018,
his cases are still pending.

kevin chmielewski
Chmielewski was the most prominent whistle-
blower who revealed alleged grossly wasteful
spending and unethical abuses of  power by then-
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, demonstrating
that employees can help protect scientific integrity
even if  their direct involvement with science
is limited. Chmielewski, a former campaign
aide to President Trump who served as Deputy
Chief  of  Staff of  Operations at EPA, revealed
excessive and often illegal spending on security
and travel, as well as serious ethics conflicts.
Chmielewski’s disclosures catalyzed Congressio-
nal investigations into then-Administrator Pruitt’s
unjustified misuse of  public funds (Carper et al.
2018). Administrator Pruitt ultimately had to
resign in July 2018 (Davenport, Friedman, and
Haberman 2018). However, Chmielewski and
several others who questioned then-Administrator
Pruitt’s management practices were reassigned,
demoted, put on administrative leave without
pay, or fired (Lipton, Vogel, and Friedman 2018).

proposeD solutions
Employees who blow the whistle often suffer a
real professional cost. Stronger whistleblower

protection laws would encourage future employees
to report serious issues of  public concern as well
as deter reprisals. Below are four recommen-
dations to strengthen protections for federal
employee whistleblowers, thus encouraging civil
servants to report scientific censorship and other
serious abuses while discouraging retaliation.

access to court with Jury trials
Access to jury trials would give government
whistleblowers the same legitimate speech rights
available to corporate employees through the
right to seek justice from the citizens whom they
aim to defend. Federal whistleblowers are the
only significant portion of  the U.S. labor force
without that access to justice. Their due process
rights currently are limited to administrative
hearings at the Merit Systems Protection Board
(MSPB). The MSPB does not have independence
from political pressure or the resources to address
abuses of  power connected with national policy
issues, but those disputes are the most significant
reason we need whistleblowers. The MSPB was

The Merit Systems Protection Board
was designed to resolve office conflicts,

testimony.

designed to resolve office conflicts, not analyze
and reach decisions on highly technical, scientific
disputes of  national significance with expert testi-
mony. Providing federal employee whistleblowers
with access to federal court and trial by jury, like
all state and local government workers and nearly
all corporate employee whistleblowers, would
overcome these weaknesses. Court access also
would bypass the retaliation whistleblowers often
face from administrative judges and hearing
officers in the merit system, who traditionally
have been exceedingly hostile to those challeng-
ing the executive branch power structure.

30  |  Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help

protection from retaliatory investigations
that can become criminal prosecutions
Congress should eliminate loopholes that allow
managers to conduct some of  the most egregious
forms of  reprisal levied against whistleblowers—
retaliatory criminal investigations, prosecutorial
referrals, and prosecutions. Currently, there is
no need for those wishing to retaliate against
whistleblowers to propose official personnel
actions that trigger draining, time-consuming
due process hearings and appellate review.
Instead, federal scientific agencies increasingly
use “whistleblower witch hunts” to bully whistle-
blowers with the threat of  criminal prosecution.
Furthermore, instead of  facing a loss in a case
where they cannot find compromising informa-
tion about the whistleblower, they simply close
the first case and start a new one. Deeming these
particularly nefarious forms of  retaliation to be

prohibited personnel practices when taken against
whistleblowers would allow them to defend them-
selves, significantly reducing the intended chilling
effect on employees who witness serious problems
in the workplace.

realistic opportunities for whistleblower
interim relief
Whistleblower cases brought under the Whistle-
blower Protection Act often take anywhere from
2 to 12 years for OSC, the MSPB, and relevant
appellate courts to reach a decision (GAP 2018).

During these lengthy delays, whistleblowers
generally are unemployed, pay exorbitant fees
for legal representation, and have difficulty find-
ing a new job. All the while, they must also worry
about their personal lives, which may include
supporting a family and raising children. By the
time they win their cases, their lives may have
been irreparably harmed. The current law is
set up so that OSC can apply interim relief  for
whistleblowers quite easily, yet the agency seldom
does except in the most extreme of  cases. The
legal burdens of  proof  are unrealistically high
for employees seeking interim relief  on their
own. Congress should amend the WPA to
provide realistic legal tests for whistleblowers to
freeze retaliation until their cases are resolved.
This not only would be humane; it would also
make a tremendous difference in the willingness
of  whistleblowers to work with the court and
investigators.

conclusion
Employees who speak out about violations of  law,
gross waste, mismanagement, abuse of  authority,
and substantial risks to health, safety, and the
environment are our best resource to hold federal
agencies accountable and protect the public inter-
est. Expanded protections are essential to ensure
that employees are encouraged to blow the whistle
rather than remain silent observers of  abuse.
Federal scientists in particular work on issues that
have major impacts to public health and safety,
from nuclear waste storage to clean drinking
water. The work of  these individuals is invaluable—
as is their continued vigilance. It is therefore
imperative that Congress act swiftly and decisively
to implement robust protections for scientist
whistleblowers.

epa Declines to look critically
at pollution levels relative
to stanDarDs
Under the Clean Air Act, the New Source
Review (NSR) program requires power plants
and refineries to install modern pollution control
equipment when they are undergoing modifi-
cations that will lead to a significant increase in
emissions—e.g., if  a power plant is undertaking
upgrades that will increase its output and, con-
sequently, the pollution it emits. EPA has the
opportunity to review draft NSR construction
permits for facilities undertaking upgrades, and
in the past has examined the appropriateness of
analyses performed by plant owners and opera-
tors to determine whether plant upgrades will
increase emissions and trigger pollution-control
requirements or whether additional emissions
controls are needed (GAO 2012; United States v.
DTE Energy Co. 2017). In December 2017, then-
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt issued a guidance

memo stating that the agency “does not intend
to substitute its judgment for that of  the owner
or operator by ‘second guessing’ the owner or
operator’s emissions projections” (Pruitt 2017b).
  The “second guessing” language refers to
a court decision in which the majority opinion
cautioned EPA against “second guessing” an
owner’s projection, though the judges did not
agree on the extent to which skepticism is allowed,
and a later federal appeals court decision found
that “the focus on so-called ‘second-guessing’
is misplaced” (United States v. DTE Energy 2017).
The memo takes avoidance of  second-guessing
to  extreme, stating that when “a source owner
or operator performs a pre-project NSR applica-
bility analysis in accordance with the calcula-
tion procedures in the regulations, and follows
the applicable recordkeeping and notification
requirements in the regulations, that owner or
operator has met the pre-project source obliga-
tions of  the regulations, unless there is a clear
error (e.g., the sources applies the wrong signifi-
cance threshold)” (Pruitt 2017b). By suggesting

32  |  Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help

that EPA will remove itself  from the determina-
tion except in cases with the most obvious of
errors, the agency is practically inviting unscrupu-
lous operators preparing analyses to make the
kinds of  assumptions that are least likely to
show the need for them to invest in additional
pollution-control equipment.

EPA is practically inviting unscrupulous
operators preparing analyses to make

  Some recent major settlements announced
by EPA also suggest the agency is failing to take
an appropriately critical look at what companies
can and should do to remedy violations:

•	 ExxonMobil: EPA touted an October 31,
2017, Clean Air Act settlement with Exxon-
Mobil’s eight chemical plants in Texas and
Louisiana as an example of  EPA’s “commit-
ment to enforce the law.” EPA claimed the
settlement required ExxonMobil to spend
$300 million to install pollution controls and
eliminate hundreds of  tons of  pollutants per
year, but that estimate included emissions re-
duced since the beginning of  2013, or nearly
five years before the consent decree took effect.
In addition, the consent decree’s performance

are already required under pre-existing per-
mits, and in several cases actually authorize
emissions of  smog-forming chemicals that
are higher than these permits allow (Schaeffer
and Pelton 2018).

•	 Carbon Black: EPA advertised another series
of  settlements that required four companies to
reduce emissions from ten plants that manufac-
ture carbon black, which is used to make tires
and other rubber products. But its announce-
ment did not mention its simultaneous decision

to postpone, for up to three years or more,
the deadlines for cleaning up six other carbon
black plants under consent decrees with Cabot
Corporation and Continental Resources that
had been entered years earlier. The agency
made no serious effort to justify this extension,
which allowed Cabot and Continental to back
out of  enforceable commitments to comply
with the Clean Air that it had made years
earlier (Schaeffer and Pelton 2018).

•	 Devon Energy: In February 2018, EPA

entered into an agreement with Oklahoma-
based Devon Energy that includes a vague
one-and-a-half-page commitment to audit and
clean up emissions from its drilling sites that
will be difficult to enforce, and which requires
no penalties or expenditures to mitigate the
damage caused (EIP 2018).

fewer inspectors anD lower
penalties at epa
Since January 2017, EPA’s Office of  Enforcement
and Compliance Assurance (OECA) has seen its
staffing levels shrink dramatically (Dennis, Eilperin,
and Ba Tran 2018). At EPA headquarters, at least
73 OECA staff members had left the office and
only four new ones were hired by late July 2018
(Rosenberg 2018). As of  April 2018, EPA had
only 140 criminal investigators on staff, a drop
of  one-fifth from 2012 levels and below the 200
agents required under the 1999 U.S. Pollution
Prosecution Act (Clark 2018).
  Perhaps as a result of  EPA having fewer
inspectors and looking less critically at pollution
levels relative to standards, major polluters are
now less likely to face enforcement actions, pay
appropriate penalties, or be required to make
significant investments in pollution control or
cleanup. During the first year after its inauguration,
the Trump administration resolved 44% fewer cases
in federal court and recovered less than half  as
much in the way of  penalties from polluters, when
compared to the first year of  the previous three
administrations. When comparing inflation-
adjusted totals for civil cases and penalties for
violations of  major environmental laws such

Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help |  33

as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act (but
excluding Superfund), the Trump administra-
tion lodged 48 cases for a total of  $30 million
in  penalties, compared to 71 cases for $81 million
in President Barack Obama’s first year and 112
cases for $70 million in President George W.
Bush’s first year (Schaeffer and Pelton 2018).
  The defendants in those judicial actions
settled in Trump’s first year were expected to
spend $966 million on pollution controls needed
to remedy those violations. By contrast, EPA
anticipated that polluters would spend up to
$3.8 billion (in inflation-adjusted dollars) in
cleanup under settlements lodged within President
Obama’s first year, and $2 billion for those in
the first year of  President Bush (Schaeffer and
Pelton 2018).
  EPA typically pursues cases against very large
polluters, some of  which involve violations at
many different facilities spread across the United
States. States frequently lack the resources or
the political will to sustain enforcement actions
against corporations that spend millions on legal
representation and lobbyists (McKelvey 2018).
That is why Congress gave EPA full authority
to enforce the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act,
and other federal laws, even when states are
authorized to implement those requirements
within their borders. Without such enforcement,
the many responsible companies who make the
right decisions to clean up emissions or eliminate
the discharge of  toxic pollutants will be at the
mercy of  unscrupulous competitors who are
willing to cut corners. Communities downwind
or downstream will have to live with unhealthy
air and water that is not fit for public use.

less information anD enforcement
from osha
By enforcing workplace health and safety rules,
OSHA assures that employers mitigate and elimi-
nate hazards that could otherwise lead to disability
and death for workers. To carry out its mission
and target its limited resources, OSHA needs
timely, reliable information about conditions at
workplaces. It receives information through its
own inspections and from employers filing

mandatory reports of  occupational injuries and
illnesses. Both sources of  information have been
significantly weakened.
  As of  January 2018, the number of  federal
OSHA inspectors had dropped to 764 from 815
in FY 2017 (AFL-CIO 2018). The decline was
due in part to the federal hiring freeze, and in
late 2017 Secretary of  Labor Alexander Acosta
indicated that the agency had hired additional
inspectors and was recruiting more (Khimm
2018). In the meantime, the reduced inspection
workforce has been accompanied by a drop in
units of  enforcement, which fell from 42,900
units in FY 2016 to 41,829 in FY 2017—a drop
of  1,071 units. In the first five months of  FY 2018
alone, they fell by a further 1,163 (Berkowitz 2018).

States frequently lack the resources or
the political will to sustain enforcement
actions against corporations that spend
millions on legal representation and
lobbyists.

  Enforcement units reflect the complexity
of  inspections; because some inspections require
more time and effort, they count for more units.
While the Labor Department noted that the
number of  inspections has increased (Khimm
2018), the drop in enforcement units suggests
that this increase has come by increasing the num-
ber of  relatively simple, less-resource-intensive
inspections. OSHA began tracking enforcement
units rather than simply the number of  inspections
completed starting in FY 2016 in order to make
enforcement activity more strategic and remove
potential disincentives for undertaking complex
investigations into workplace hazards such as
heat, chemical exposures, ergonomics, and
workplace violence (Michaels 2015).
  To obtain a more complete picture of  occu-
pational injuries and illnesses that occur across
the country, OSHA relies on employers to report
fatalities, injuries, and illnesses. Employers have
long been required to keep injury and illness logs,

34  |  Protecting Science at Federal Agencies: How Congress Can Help

but only under the previous administration were
they required to submit them to OSHA periodi-
cally. In 2016, OSHA issued a final rule instructing
employers to submit these logs electronically (with
some exceptions based on employer size and in-
dustry); the agency would then remove identifying
information and make the data publicly available
online (OSHA 2016). With agency and public
access to information, OSHA explained, “em-
ployers, employees, employee representatives,

of  the new requirements for electronic injury and
illness reporting. Specifically, OSHA has proposed
repealing the reporting of  more detailed injury
information for establishments with over 250
employees (OSHA 2018). Given that employers
are already required to maintain these records,
the primary result of  this rollback is reduced
transparency and less agency and public access
to information that could help reduce occupa-
tional injuries, illnesses, and deaths.

the government, and researchers may be better
able to identify and mitigate workplace hazards
and thereby prevent worker injuries and illnesses”
(OSHA 2016). OSHA would use this information
to improve the effectiveness of  its enforcement
and compliance assistance activities in prevent-
ing injuries and fatalities. In July 2018, however,
OSHA proposed a rule that would rescind part

proposeD solutions
To ensure that regulatory agencies are carrying
out their statutory responsibilities to enforce
laws that protect public health, Congress should
hold oversight hearings and initiate inquiries
when a regulatory agency rolls back reporting
requirements that advance transparency or
displays a substantial drop in penalties or
enforcement units.

conclusion
Fair and consistent enforcement of  environmen-
tal and workplace health and safety laws averts
injuries and illnesses that strain families and
communities and lead to early departures from
the workforce. Such enforcement can also improve
public confidence in government. Regulatory
agencies should have accurate, up-to-date
information about the power plants, workplaces,
and other entities under their purview, and they
should use that information when making
decisions about penalties and settlements.

Conclusion
If  the sidelining of  science described in this

report persists, federal agencies’ reputations
as respected sources of  information will suffer
long-term damage. Worse, though, will be the

consequences of  reversing decades of  progress
that has improved air and water quality, restored
and safeguarded biodiversity, reduced unintended
pregnancy, made workplaces safer, and other-
wise advanced public health and environmental
protection.

In the 2018 survey of  federal scientists by the
Union of  Concerned Scientists and Iowa State
University, 39% of  respondents reported that
the effectiveness of  their divisions or offices had
decreased over the past year, and 46% reported
a decrease in personal job satisfaction (Carter,
Goldman, and Johnson 2018). Morale is lower
at agencies where respondents reported concerns
about leadership, including EPA and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service. Low morale can lead
to  the departure of  skilled federal employees with
valuable knowledge, experience, and institutional
memory. Such departures can both be caused
by, and exacerbate problems related to, political
interference with science, and leave agencies less
equipped to address epidemics, natural disasters,
and other threats.

damage from federal agencies’ current disregard

for scientific evidence. Its oversight role is crucial
in revealing instances in which agencies have ig-
nored or distorted scientific findings, and increased
oversight can deter future problems. Congress
has passed legislation, such as whistleblower pro-
tections and sunshine statutes, that contribute to
a stronger culture of  scientific integrity at federal
agencies. In order to create a lasting legacy,
through adequate oversight and vetting, and by
passing laws that codify strong scientific integrity
standards and create adequate enforcement
mechanisms for those standards, Congress can
help ensure that agencies base decisions on the
best available science, and secure a healthier and
more prosperous future for the United States.

Independent scientific analysis and advice are essential for effective policies

that serve the public interest. This report describes new and ongoing threats to

the communication of science and its use in public health and environmental

decisions, and it recommends steps Congress can take in response.

The organizations that contributed to this report work to ensure that U.S. policy

decision-making is fully informed by scientific evidence and the best available data

and that the public has reliable access to independent scientific information

and analysis produced and acquired by the federal government.
