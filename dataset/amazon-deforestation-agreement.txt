1Agreement on Acknowledging  
the Value of the Forest and Ending Amazon 
Deforestation  1 
 
(Translated from the original Portuguese text: ‘Pac to pela Valorização da Floresta e pelo Fim do 
Desmatamento na Amazônia’) 
 
 
Introduction 
 
The signatories to this document 2 propose that Brazil adopts a National Agreement on  
Acknowledging the Value of the Forest and Ending Am azon Deforestation which is to 
be achieved within seven years. Environmental servi ces provided by the forest must 
benefit both local and global habitats, as well as supporting regional and national 
development. 
 
High rates of deforestation are leading to an accel erated depletion of biodiversity, 
which is having a direct impact on the way of life for millions of people who rely on the 
forest to survive. Deforestation is also a signific ant source of greenhouse gas 
emissions which are contributing to increasing glob al warming. Forest conversion 
(land-use change) and deforestation are responsible  for up to 75 per cent of Brazilian 
greenhouse gas emissions. The forest plays a fundam ental role in maintaining the 
balance of global climate and is responsible for pr eserving rainfall in the south and 
southeast regions of Brazil and in the River Plate Basin. It is therefore of strategic 
socio-economic value. Destroying the Amazon could b ring about prolonged drought in 
a number of regions of Brazil and reduce the countr y’s agricultural productivity, leading 
to profound economic and social impacts.  
 
As such, deforestation does not bring about economi c development nor improve the 
quality of life of the local population. For the pa st 20 years, the majority of Amazon 
deforestation (70 per cent) has resulted from land conversion into pasture; this is still 
the case today. Growth in employment and income, wh ich have taken place during 
years of increasing deforestation, cannot be sustai ned as they have mainly been 
associated with the logging industry and falls dram atically once timber resources in an 
area have been exhausted. In fact, the per capita i ncome in the region’s deforested 
areas is similar to that in the forested areas.  
 
The elimination of deforestation in the Amazon is t herefore crucial to reducing Brazil’s 
main contribution to climate change, to conserving biodiversity and preserving the way 
of life of indigenous peoples and traditional popul ations, thereby improving the quality 
of life in the region.  
 
This Agreement proposes to reduce deforestation in the Amazon to zero within a 
period of seven years by adopting a system of reduc tion targets. In order to achieve 
this objective, we propose a combination of strong public policies and market strategies 
                                                
1 The present draft Agreement was initially drawn up  by a group of non-government organisations in 
support of the debate between the strategic social and economic players in the Amazon region. The aim 
was to outline, formulate and develop the instrumen ts for its implementation within the scope of a nat ional 
initiative. 
2   Instituto Socioambiental ( www.socioambiental.org ), Greenpeace ( www.greenpeace.org.br ), Instituto 
Centro de Vida ( www.icv.org.br ), Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazônia ( www.ipam.org.br ), The 
Nature Conservancy ( www.tnc.org.br ), Conservação Internacional ( www.conservation.org.br ), Amigos da 
Terra-Amazônia Brasileira ( www.amazonia.org.br ), IMAZON ( www.imazon.org.br) , and WWF-Brasil 
(www.wwf.org.br ). 

 2to finance existing forests and their environmental  services. It is essential to 
acknowledge the economic value of forest biodiversi ty (environmental services, carbon 
market-related, etc), and also to optimise agricult ural use in areas that have already 
suffered from deforestation. At the same time, it w ill be crucial to strengthen the 
forestry management of the States and effective con trol over illegal deforestation. 
Economic and technical support must be ensured and directed at government 
agencies, social players responsible for forest con servation (indigenous peoples, local 
communities and traditional populations) and produc ers (forestry companies and 
farmers) who will adopt strategies to reduce defore station and improve forest 
conservation. 
 
In this context, one of the main challenges is to g uarantee public policies which 
incorporate the elimination of deforestation within  a social, environmental and, for the 
most part, economic framework. It is necessary to g o beyond ‘command and control’ 
measures by promoting the revision and re-orientati on of financial incentives, which 
historically have been channelled into destructive practices. 
 
The technical, economic and institutional details o f the Agreement for ending 
deforestation and acknowledging the value of the fo rest must be developed in 
conjunction with the Amazon’s State governments and  the Federal government, with 
representatives of rural and forestry producers and  businesses, environmental 
organisations, social movements, indigenous people and traditional populations of the 
Amazon.  
 
Prerequisites of the Agreement 
 
To achieve its objectives, the Agreement is based o n the following four prerequisites: 
 
1. Regulatory and economic instruments, which ackno wledge the value of existing 
forests, aimed at the States and other social playe rs (payment for environmental 
services). 
 
2. Regulatory and economic instruments, which optim ise the use of areas that have 
already suffered deforestation (forest compensation ). 
 
3. Strengthening of monitoring, control and tax mea sures (environmental and land-
based). 
 
4. Establishment and strengthening of forestry gove rnance in public land in the region. 
 
Support for the Agreement is based on the developme nt of financial remuneration 
instruments for environmental services provided thr ough forest conservation. These 
must be aimed at: 
 
1. Strengthening forestry governance through incent ives for the States. 
  
2. Establishing economic incentives for social play ers responsible for forest 
conservation (indigenous peoples, local communities  and traditional populations). 
 
3. Establishing economic incentives for rural produ cers (private farmers and forestry 
companies). 
 
 
 

 3Deforestation reduction targets 
 
The parties to the Agreement are proposing targets to reduce deforestation in the 
Amazon to zero by 2015 (while allowing continued tr aditional use of the forest) based 
on the approximate rate of deforestation verified a s being 14,000 square kilometres in 
the period August 2005-July 2006.  
 
The reduction proposed is scaled on an annual basis  according to the table below: 
 
7-Year Target Proposals 
 
 Deforestation (ha) Reduced Deforest. 
Deforest. 05/06 1,400,000  
1st  year (25%) 1,050,000 350,000 
2nd  year (25%) 787,500 612,500 
3rd  year (30%) 551,250 848,750 
4th  year (40%) 330,750 1,069,250 
5th  year (50%) 165,375 1,234,625 
6th  year (75%) 41,345 1,358,655 
7th  year (100%) - 1,400,000 
Total 3,585,902 6,873,780 
 
The percentages are applied on the rate of deforestat ion verified in the 
immediate prior year, according to the table above 
 
System of reduction targets for the Amazon 
 
The proposed system of targets to end deforestation in  the Amazon must be 
based on shared responsibility between the States and the Federal Government 
so as to be able to clearly define the application of incentives.  
 
These targets must follow criteria, which include the r elationship between: 
 
1. The territorial extent of each State. 
 
2. The percentage of remaining forest which exists (prot ected and non-
protected). 
 
3. The effective available area (used and unused). 
 
4. The previous history of deforestation. 
 
For granting incentives, the targets should include concr ete improvements in 
management instruments intended to strengthen governanc e in the Amazon 
region and provide an inducement to reduce deforestati on. These management 
instruments must be governed by four guiding principles: 
 

 41. Increase in the percentage of rural properties adhe ring to rural and 
environmental licensing systems. 
 
2. Creation and consolidation of Conservation Units (pr otected areas). 
 
3. Establishment of land settlement methods designed fo r the Amazon (PAE, 
PDS  and PAF) 3 in accordance with their objectives and the implementat ion of 
support programmes for indigenous lands. 
 
4. Implementation of a programme of incentives to red uce deforestation.  
 
 
Financial mechanism for environmental services and forest 
conservation  
 
Financial compensation to an Amazonian State for reduci ng deforestation shall 
be based on three criteria: 
 
1. Effective reduction of deforestation. 
 
2. Achievement of reduction targets and/or conservatio n of forests. 
 
3. Satisfactory performance in implementing structural measures for achieving 
the targets.  
 
States which achieve their annual targets for reducing deforestation in a 
timeframe shorter than that which is stipulated, and d o so by implementing the 
measures contained in this proposal, will receive greate r financial compensation 
than States which fail to meet their target. However, the target may be used as 
a planning parameter for the measures and the evaluat ion of results, but its 
non-fulfilment shall not necessarily exclude the possibil ity of receiving 
compensation. Benefits will be suspended only in the cas e where there is an 
increase in deforestation. 
 
 
Amazonian Fund for payment of environmental service s 
 
Investment in the order of R$ 1 billion per year (rou ghly Euro 390 million) from 
public and private sources over the seven year period of t he agreement has 
been estimated as being required.  This figure is based  on a wide range of 
sources identified in the study “Economic Basis of the Agre ement on 
Acknowledging the Value of the Forest and Ending Amazon  Deforestation”, 
conducted by a group of distinguished economists. 4  
 
The economic study investigates two premises: firstly, that B razil attracts 
external resources to finance Amazon forest conservation pr ogrammes, but 
                                                
3 PAE-Agroextractive Settlement Project, PDS-Sustain able Development Project, and PAF-Forest 
Settlement Project. 
4 The economic study was developed by Consultoria Ma crotempo to subsidize the proposals presented by 
the signatory organisations. The following economis ts took part of the group of consultant who develop ed 
the document: Amir Khair, Carlos Eduardo Frickmann Young, Luis Afonso Simoens and Vivian Macknight.   

 5wishes to maintain its sovereignty over the region. Th e second premise is that 
Brazil is ranked as a country of medium income by intern ational financial 
institutions, which makes it difficult for the country to secure financial resources 
or donations from these bodies, with the possible excep tion, of tropical forests. 
 
The funding matrix of the present proposal should be l argely dependent on 
public resources. Therefore, Brazilian Federal and Amazon  State Governments 
must demonstrate their commitment to the proposal in o rder to attract internal 
resources and additional external funding. The level o f economic benefits 
accruing to States and social actors should be managed by a  Donation Fund for 
Amazon Forest Conservation, or Amazon Governance Fund,  which must be 
related to fulfilling the terms of the Agreement. Th e economic study also 
recommends that the Fund should be under the auspices o f the BNDES 
(Brazilian Bank of Economic and Social Development), wh ich is highly 
respected as an institution both in Brazil and abroad.  This would also allow the 
bank to attract internal resources and catalyse internal and external private 
funding for the region.  
 
The Fund is aimed at: 
 
1. Strengthening forestry management. 
 
2. Payment for environmental services (PSA) orientate d towards: 
 
• Implementation and management of Conservation Unit s; 
• Programmes for socio-environmental development in in digenous lands and 
the territories of traditional populations; 
• Programmes supporting sustainable rural development. 
 
The study also outlines two further suggestions for invest ment funds to act as 
incentives for Amazon forest protection.   
 
The three funds proposed by the economists would be estab lished using private 
and public capital. Private sources would primarily come  from external 
resources (carbon market-related), large national compa nies and other, mainly 
institutional, investors. Public funding would come from  the general budget of 
the Federal Government.  Projected growth of the Brazi lian economy would 
provide the Federal Government with additional resourc es which should be 
directed towards environmental protection.  
 
Finally, the study also points to the possibility of Amaz on States helping to fund 
the Agreement. One means of achieving this could be via the creation of a new 
Federal tax on polluting activities, with the revenue r aised being returned to the 
Amazon States.  
 
The Agreement aims for firm commitments by public autho rities and the  
BNDES to in turn attract resources from national and i nternational investors and 
donors, whether private, official bodies or bilateral g overnment arrangements. It 
is essential that the proposed structure for managing pu blic resources complies 
with all relevant legal obligations. With regard to p rivate resources, the proposal 
allows each State to maintain responsibility for the p ublic management of these 

 6resources. The Administration Council of the funds to be  set up should be 
comprised of Brazilian personalities who are well respect ed in the international 
environmental field. 
 
 
Final considerations 
 
Success in attracting significant investment to put in place  a programme to 
reduce deforestation by providing financial incentives de pends on sufficient 
capacity for planning and evaluation.  
 
Equally important is a compensation mechanism for legal reserves 5 to cover 
liabilities arising in deforested areas as well as to mai ntain remaining forest 
assets. It is also essential to develop a reliable method  of monitoring whether 
deforestation is shifting into adjacent regions (known as ‘leakage’) which are not 
covered by the Agreement, particularly the Cerrado.  
 
There is an urgent need for a national debate on per manent, long-term 
solutions to deforestation in the Amazon. Public interest  organisations are 
relying on the maturity of Brazilian society and the sh ared interest in ensuring 
that Brazil is prepared to face up to the global envir onmental crisis consistent 
with achieving sustainable development for the countr y.  
                                                
5   The legal reserve is the proportion of a landhol ding that the Brazilian Forest Code stipulates shou ld not 
be cleared of forest.
