SUMMARY

S

everal  decades  of  hostilities  in  West  Africa  have  greatly  impeded  regional

development  and  prevented  the  alarming  levels  of  chronic  poverty  from  being

reduced.

In  1992,  the  United  Nations  requested  the  enforcement  of  an  arms  embargo  on  the

area.  In  1998  a  moratorium  which  affected  the  importation,  exportation  and

manufacture  of  light  weapons  by  16  member  countries  of  the  ECOWAS  (Economic

Community of West African States) was put into effect.

This  moratorium,  however,  has  not  been  complied  with.  It  has  been  reported  that

trafficking  in  diamonds  and  other  resources  has  been  used  to  supply  funds  to  the

'warlords'.  There is also a wealth of information which would indicate that the logging

companies in Liberia play an important role in the illicit trade of arms, as well as in the

destabilisation and insecurity of the region.

The United Nations Security Council commissioned a panel of experts to investigate the

non-compliance  of  the  arms  embargo  and  its  findings  were  made  known  last

December.    The  panel  of  expert  investigators  found  evidence  to  prove  that  some

timber companies are directly implicated in the traffic of arms.  The Spanish company,

Forum Africa/Forum Liberia, is among those countries listed in the report.

As  a  result,  among  the  many  recommendations  made  by  the  UN  Security  Council's

panel  of  experts  is  the  proposed  international  embargo  on  the  importation  of  timber

from Liberia.

The Ukrainian businessman, Leonid Minin, was arrested in Italy last year.  He is the owner

of  a  timber  company  and  is  closely  linked  to  the  political  circles  in  Liberia.    He  is  also

said  to  be  the  most  important  arms  trafficker  in  Africa.  Discovered  among  the

documents seized from Leonic Minin were the names of Spanish businessmen linked to

Forum Africa.

In  1999,    Liberian  legislation  conferred  absolute  power  on  its  president,  Charles  Taylor.

According  to  the  new  Strategic  Commodities  Act  of  Liberia,  the  exploitation,

commercialisation  and  exportation  of  all  natural  resources  (minerals,  diamonds,  gas,

timber, etc.) depend solely on President's approval.   Therefore, this, and the usurpation

of  legislative  power,  makes  the  current  president  of  the  Republic  of  Liberia  the  sole

beneficiary  of  any  revenue  obtained,  with  a  total  contempt  for  the  economic  and

social wellbeing of his country.

5

In  1998,  Spain  imported  timber  from  Liberia  for  a  total  of  208.5  million  pesetas.    All  the

current  figures  indicate  that  imports  from  this  African  country  increased  in  1999  and

2000.

In accordance with the recommendations of the UN Security Council's panel of experts,

and in view of the evidence which has come to light, Greenpeace is requesting both a

temporary embargo on the imports of timber from Liberia and the blacklisting of those

companies using Spanish capital in Liberia.

LIBERIA: THE LAST REMAINING FORESTS OF
WEST AFRICA

L

iberia  has  a  total  area  of  111.369  km2  (slightly  larger  than  the  Spanish  region  of

Castile  and  Leon),  a  population  of  2.73  million  inhabitants  and  a  population

density of 25.54 inhabitants/sq. km

After one and a half centuries as a sovereign state, the internal conflicts between rival

factions  for  the  control  of  its  resources  have  plunged  the  country  into  ruin  and

deprivation, making it one of the poorest countries on the planet.  Some of its natural

resources, diamonds in particular, are instrumental in the political instability of Liberia.

As  a  result  of  the  instability  and  internal  conflicts,  Liberia  is  the  only  country  within  the

region  that  has  considerable  forest  cover.  The  majority  of  West  African  nations  (Ivory

Coast, Ghana and Nigeria) have destroyed their extensive rainforests which extended

from the coast to the interior of their countries.

In 1990 it was estimated that approximately only 12% of these rainforests remained.1  In

1997 this figure had fallen to 10%2. During the period 1990-1995 this region depleted 2.5

million hectares. The annual rates of deforestation in West Africa are among the highest

in the world, although the speed of this phenomenon has been interrupted3, principally

due to political instability and the hostilities, which have prevented large-scale forestry

operations from being undertaken.

In spite of this, the last remaining extensive areas of thick tropical forest in West Africa

are to be found in Liberia.  In 1995 these areas measured some 4.5 million hectares4 and

were  divided  into  two  large  blocks.    Lofa  and  Bomi  in  the  North-east  and  Rivercess,

Grand Bassa, Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, Maryland, Nimba and Grand Kru in the South-east5.

Between 1990 and 1995, some 134,000 hectares of forest were destroyed.

These  extensive  tropical  forests  are  home  to  species  in  need  of  protection  either

because  they  are  in  danger  of  extinction  or  because  they  are  endemic  to  that

particular area.

In  the  forests  of  Liberia  you  can  find  exceptionally  rare  zoological  specimens  such  as

the  Liberian  Mongoose  (Liberictis  kuhnii)  and  the  endemic  Pygmy  Hippopotamus

(Cherosis liberensisis).

The  religious  and  traditional  beliefs  of  the  native  population  have  enabled  some  of

these forests, which were not previously protected, to be designated as forest reserves

or national parks.

The  protection  of  the  flora  and  fauna  of  this  area  has  been  identified  as  a  global

priority,  as  highlighted  during  the  meeting  organised  by  the  NGO  Conservation

International in 19996.

In early April 2000, the Liberian Minister of Agriculture, Roland Massaquoi, stated that  “it

is  evident  that  most  of  the  country's  natural  rainforests  have  been  depleted  without

reforestation.    If  Liberians  are  not  careful  about  the  effective  utilisation  of  the  forest

reserves, the nation would face drought in the next 15 years” and he criticised the way

in which logging companies were operating.7

TIMBER PRODUCTION IN LIBERIA DURING
1999

A

ccording  to  data  compiled  by  the  Liberian  Government  8,  the  volume  of  logs

exported  to  Western  European  countries  in  1999  was  82%,  followed  by  Asia

(15.6%),  and  other  African  countries  (2.4%).  The  main  importers  of  Liberian

timber are as follows: France (37.07%), Italy (19.17%) Turkey (15.07%), China (7.77%) and

Indonesia (6.31%).

In 1999, Spain ranked sixth with imports of 6,266 m3 (3.30% of total exports).

Total  timber  exports  in  1999  were  189,940  m3  amounting  to  21,370,491  US  dollars,  an

increase of 135.5% over 1998.  Exports of sawn lumber to Europe are minimal and only

amount to 299.4 m3.

FOREST MANAGEMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE
'WAR LORDS'

D

  ue  to  the  wars  which  ravaged  the  country  during  the  90s,  the  exploitation  of

the  Liberian  forests  was  considerably  less  than  carried  out  by  its  neighbouring

countries.    However,  because  of  the  victory  of  Charles  Taylor,  chief  'warlord'

and current president, and the relative size of its tropical forests, international industries

and  their  commercial  agents  have  begun  to  set  their  sights  on  this  small  African

country.

During  the  90s  Liberia  did  not  enjoy  a  structured  economic  system.      Its  economy  was

based on the exploitation of its resources, criminal gangs and smuggling from the mines

and  timber  operations.  The  'warlords'  have  fomented  conflict  not  only  for  their  own

personal  benefit,  but  also  to  gain  control  over  and  to  exploit  the  mineral  and  timber

resources of the local inhabitants in the strife-torn areas9.

During  the  early  90s,  income  from  the  export  of  minerals  (gold,  diamonds,  iron)  and

timber constituted the principal source of revenue for the 'warlords'10.

France  supplied  arms  to  the  NPFL  (Charles  Taylor's  armed  faction)  in  exchange  for

timber.    Liberia  receives  large  supplies  of  arms  from  Europe  and  the  Middle  East.    In

December 1993, the Austrian weekly, Profil stated that the Frenchman, Werner Mehler,

supplied  Charles  Taylor  with  large  quantities  of  arms  and  munitions  from  Rumania.

Lebanese  companies  have  also  been  named  as  purchasers  of  mineral  and  forestry

resources  in  exchange  for  credits  and  access  to  equipment.      The  government  of  the

Ivory  Coast  also  helped  the  NPFL  in  exchange  for  concessions  in  mineral  and  timber

exploitations.11

The value of timber exports from areas controlled by armed factions between 1990 and

1994 is estimated at 53 million dollars.12

At the end of the war and after the 1997 elections in Liberia the forestry sector made a

slow recovery, as there was no sustained level of timber exports.13  However, in view of

the prohibition on the export of roundwood (logs) imposed on several Central and West

African countries, all the available information indicates that both the logging industry

and  international  capital  consider  Liberia  to  be  a  country  which  will  enable  them  to

continue depleting the forests14.

Having  said  this,  however,  the  international  import  sector  realises  that  the  Liberian

Government has a limited ability to manage, control and monitor its forestry activities.15

WHO BENEFITS FROM TIMBER  EXPLOITATION
IN LIBERIA?

The  FDA  (Forestry  Development  Authority)  was  formed  in  1976  and  is  a  government

body  assigned  to  manage  forest  resources  in  Liberia.    Before  1999,  anyone,  with  the

exception of the Liberian President, Vice-president and any government official, could

utilise  the  forestry  resources.  Also  excluded  were  members  of  the  Senate  and

Parliament,  members  of  the  Judiciary,  and  officers  of  the  Armed  Forces  and  Police

Service.16

Two  laws  regarding  Liberian  forestry  resources  were  passed  in  1999,  one  of  which,  the

new National Forestry Act, reconfirmed the mandate given to the FDA in 1976, making

it  responsible  for  the  monitoring  of  forestry  operations  in  order  not  only  to  ensure  a

sustainable  supply  of  timber,  but  also  to  safeguard  methods  of  extraction  so  as  to

guarantee the sustainable development of its forestry resources.

The other controversial and highly criticised law gave the President of Liberia exclusive

control over the country’s natural resources.  Known as the Strategic Commodities Act,

it  authorises  specific  people  and  entities  to  extract,  exploit,  sell  or  export  the  natural

and mineral resources of Liberia without having to pay any kind of State tax or having

to pass through Customs controls, to the economic and social detriment of the nation.

The  Strategic  Commodities  Act  empowered  the  President  of  Liberia  to,  at  any  time,

declare and designate any natural resources of Liberia, including all forestry resources.

Other resources such as gold, diamonds, gas, minerals, metal or stones which had been

discovered,  or  were  yet  to  be  discovered,  and  which  had  a  commercial  value  and

could  be  marketed  at  both  national  and  international  level,  were  also  considered

strategic commodities.17

The  President  was  also  granted  the  power  to  execute  and  negotiate  all  commercial

contracts  or  agreements  with  any  foreign  or  domestic  investor  for  the  exploitation  of

any of the strategic commodities of the Republic of Liberia, upon his sole signature.18

Charles Taylor not only controls all the natural resources of Liberia and their economic

benefits but also uses the revenue to provide support for the RUF in Sierra Leone.

17 Strategic Commodities Act, 1999

12

As well as the known link between the international diamond trade ('diamonds of war')

and the funding of the guerrilla armies in the neighbouring country, international NGO's

have confirmed that President Charles Taylor also uses the revenue obtained from the

forestry operations to fund the RUF militia groups in Sierra Leone.19

The  data  on  export  figures  in  the  Liberian  Forestry  Authority's  annual  report  does  not

coincide with information received from independent sources.20  The revenue obtained

from timber exports does not reflect actual logging operations, as a considerable part is

exempt  from  taxes  and  the  economic  benefits  are  not  recorded.    A  very  large

percentage  of  this  revenue  from  forestry  operations  is  not  reflected  in  the  official

accounts of the Republic of Liberia and is used to pay for favours received, or to fund

the trafficking of arms and diamonds.

The  Oriental  Timber  Company  (OTC)  is  the  largest  timber  company  in  Liberia  and  is

closely linked to President Charles Taylor.   It operates with complete impunity and is not

subject  to  the  control  of  the  Liberian  forestry  authority,  the  FDA.    According  to  NGO

Global  Witness  sources,  the  OTC  provided  President  Taylor  with  5  million  dollars  in

exchange for tax exemption and exclusion from controls and regulations.  In the report

of  UN  Security  Council's  Panel  of  Experts,  this  company  was  named  as  one  of  those

implicated in corruption and arms trafficking to Sierra Leone.  In fact, the roads built by

the OTC for their forestry operations have been used to transport weapons to the rebels

in Sierra Leone.21

FOREST INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL

INSECURITY

I

n  December  2000  the  UN  Security  Council's  Panel  of  Experts  published  a  report22

analising  the  role  of  countries,  people  and  companies  in  the  regional  insecurity  of

West Africa, and particularly in the internal conflict in Sierra Leone.

The report states that despite a commercial embargo on arms to Sierra Leone, several

countries  in  the  region,  including  governments  and  the  Liberian  logging  industry,  are

implicated in providing weapons in exchange for diamonds and other raw materials.

According to the report, “the timber industry is involved in a series of illicit activities and

a large amount of the revenue is used to fund extra-budgetary activities including the

acquisition of weapons".

The  report  also  notes  that  roads  built  and  maintained  for  timber  exploitation  are  used

for  weapons  movement  to  Sierra  Leone.    The  trucks  employed  in  the  transportation  of

timber are also used to transport arms.  The owners of the timber companies, which are

implicated  in  this  trade,  have  close  ties  with  President  Taylor,  to  whom  they  give

financial support.  The report also named some businessmen connected with the timber

industry.    They  are  closely  linked  to  the  circles  of  power,  and  also  have  access  to

hangars from where small aircraft used in the traffic of arms to Sierra Leone take off.

The  report  names  the  three  timber  companies  directly  implicated  in  this  trade:  Exotic

and  Tropical  Timber  Enterprises  (ETTE),  Oriental  Timber  Company  (OTC)  and  Forum

Liberia23.

Consequently, the experts made the following recommendation to the UN Security
Council:

“The principals in Liberia`s timber industry are involved in a variety of illicit activities, and
large amounts of the proceeds are used to pay for extra-budgetary activities, including
the acquisition of weapons. Consideration should be given to placing a temporary
embargo on Liberian timber exports, until Liberia demostrates convincingly that it is no
longer envolved in the trafficking of arms to, or diamonds from, Sierra Leona”.

And also:

“In  addition,  it  is  recommended  that  a  detailed  investigation  is  carried  out  into  the

Liberian  timber  industry,  particularly  of  the  Oriental  Timber  Company  (OTC),  to  enable

the  UN  Security  Council  and  other  members  of  the  global  community  to  gain  a

comprehensive  understanding  of  the  role  of  this  industry  in  Charles  Taylor's  presidency

and the conflict in Sierra Leone.”

Global  Witness24,  an  NGO  dedicated  to  the  environment  and  protection  of  human

rights  has  recently  reminded  the  UN  Security  Council  of  the  necessity  to  place  an

embargo on exports of Liberian timber as they are implicated in the arms trade to Sierra

Leone.    This  international  NGO  has  published  a  report25  in  which  it  describes  Liberian

timber as “logs of war”.

In the report published in 200026 by the office of Greenpeace España, attention is drawn

to  the  wealth  of  information  linking  the  timber  industry  to  the  causes  of  poverty,

underdevelopment and conflicts in Africa.

After pressure by Greenpeace and its allegations regarding the involvement of Spanish

importers in the illicit trade of tropical wood, the Spanish Association of Timber Importers

(AEIM) ceased to provide annual figures on their imports of timber.

Nevertheless,  despite  the  lack  of  recent  data,  all  available  information  appears  to

indicate that imports of tropical wood from Liberia have increased and will continue to

do so during the coming years.

SPANISH CAPITAL`S PROBLEMS IN THE

LIBERIAN TIMBER SECTOR

A

ccording to Liberian Government statistics,27    in  1999  there  were  at  least  three

companies  with  forestry  concessions    whose  names  linked  them  to  Spanish

capital,  namely,  Forum  Liberia,  Iberic  Forestry  Corp.  and  Spanish  Liberia  Dev.

Co.  (SLC).  Of  these  three  companies  only  Forum  Liberia  has  been  repeatedly

mentioned in documents, NGO reports, and by the media.

The partners of Forum  Liberia  are  the  Spanish  businessmen,  Jesús  Martín  Fernández  de

Velasco,  José  María  Muñoz  Suárez,  José  Fernández  Prada  (ex  president  of  Forum

Filatélico)  and  Alberto  Morales.  The  last  two  are  also  partners  of  Forum  Africa,  S.A.,

founded  in  1998  and  with  headquarters  in  Madrid.  Forum  Liberia  has  frequently

appeared in various publications under different names, such as Forum-Africa-Liberia28

or Forum Africa Limited29.

The  timber  company,  Forum  Liberia,  was  founded  in  1999  and  has  its  central  office  in

Monrovia (Liberia).  In 1999 it had a timber production of 5,364 m3, constituting 1.6% of

the  nation's  total.    It  exported  3,177  m3  of  timber  and  was  ranked  14th  in  the  list  of

Liberian timber export companies.

After  several  failed  attempts  with  other  companies,  and  before  Forum  Liberia  was

founded,  Jesús  Martín  Fernández  Velasco  contacted  Forum  Africa  and  offered  them

the  opportunity  to  join  the  timber  trade  in  Liberia  by  exploiting  the  concessions  of  the

Liberian Agricultural Company (LAC).  It was later suggested in a report by the Liberian

NGO,  The  Agenda  for  Global  Trade  Projects/SAMFU30  (AGTP/SAMFU)  that  the  Spanish

Liberian  Company  (SLC)  changed  its  name  to  Forum  Africa  Liberia  because  its

negotiations  with  the  Liberian  Agricultural  Company  to  operate  in  their  concessions

were  unsuccessful.    SLC  representatives  began  to  renegotiate  with  LAC  after  the

company was registered under the name of Forum Africa Liberia.   An agreement was

reached  with  the  Liberian  Government  for  Forum  Africa  Liberia  to  exploit  primary

forests31 in concessions belonging to LAC.

According to sources of information in the Madrid offices of Forum Africa32, the Liberian

Government received forestry exploitation taxes from both LAC and Forum Liberia.    As

a result, LAC and Forum Africa became engaged in a legal battle over the felling rights

to  85,800  hectares  of  forest.  In  a  communiqué  to  the  Forestry  Development  Authority

regarding  this  matter,  the  Attorney  General  of  Liberia  took  the  view  that  the  Liberian

Government had the right to concede the under-utilised areas of LAC's concessions to

other companies for exploitation33, therefore judging in favour of Forum Liberia.

The  conflict  was  taken  up  by  the  Liberian  media.    According  to  The  Daily  Times

Newspaper34,  Forum Africa was accused by LAC of encroachment in its concessions in

the  Grand  Bassa  region.  LAC  accused  Forum  Africa  of  illegally  exploiting  outside  its

concessions,  and  declared  that  it  had  discovered  stacks  of  logs  a  few  kilometres

outside  its  area  of  operations.  According  to  the  newspaper,  Forum  Africa  is  receiving

support  from  a  highly  placed  government  official,  presumed  to  be  Vice-president

Enoch Dogolea.

Field  investigations  carried  out  by  the  NGO  AGTP/SAMFU35  indicated  that  the  Liberian

Agricultural  Company  (LAC)  and  Forum  Africa  have  been  involved  in  confrontations

with  the  local  people  living  in  the  Liberian  forests,  over  the  anomalies  in  the  timber

exploitation.

According  to  the  same  source  of  information,  interviews  by  the  researchers  with  the

local  people  regarding  the  dispute  over  the  concession  between  LAC  and  Forum

Africa  revealed  a  general  unease  about  the  lack  of  information  on  the  operations

being  carried  out  in  their  area,  the  fact  that  there  is  no  spokesman  for  the  timber

company,  and  that  the  promises  made  have  not  been  fulfilled  at  all.    When  asked

about the legal battle between LAC and Forum Africa, the local inhabitants stated that

they  did  not  know  'who  was  who'  and  that  “  they  all  arrive,  cut  the  forest  and  then

leave'”.  When  the  local  inhabitants  have  requested  information  regarding  the  timber

operations, they have been told by the workers from these companies to “go and ask

the Government”.

This same Liberian NGO has declared that during the rainy season in Rivercess County,

the  continuous  movement  of  trucks  working  for  the  Oriental  Timber  Company,  Forum

Liberia and Rivercess Logging Company severely damaged the only road into the city

of  Buchanan  and  prevented  it  from  being  used  by  other  vehicles.      In  addition,  the

FORUM LIBERIA AND ARMS TRAFFICKING

On the night of 4th August 2000, the Ukrainian businessman, Leonid Minin, was  arrested

in  Italy  for  possession  of  20  grammes  of  cocaine  together  with  a  cache  of  diamonds.

He was convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment to be served in Italy.37

Leonid  Minin,  who  usually  resides  in  Ibiza,  Spain,  is  president  of  the  Liberian  timber

company,  Exotic  Tropical  Timber  Enterprises  (ETTE)  and  a  personal  friend  of  Charles

Taylor,  President  of  Liberia.    According  to  the  report  prepared  by  the  UN  Security

Council38, the timber company ETTE is implicated in the traffic of arms to Sierra Leone.

The United Nations consider Leonid Minin, leader of the Ukrainian mafia in Europe, to be

the most important arms trafficker in the continent of Africa.  The experts who drew up

the report for the UN Security Council confirm that his private plane has been used to

move weapons between the Ukraine and Western Africa.39

Among  the  documents  seized  from  Leonid  Minin  after  his  arrest,  is  one  dated  24

December  1999  and  titled    “Purchase-Sale  Agreement  for  Certain  Assets,  Equipment

and Machinery”, and in which the name of José María Muñoz Suárez, partner in Forum

Liberian  Corporation,  appears.    This  company  is  controlled  by  the  same  Spanish

businessmen  as  Forum  Africa  Liberia,  both  with  headquarters  in  Monrovia40.    In

November 1999, Forum Liberia handed over a cheque drawn on the USB (Union of Swiss

Banks)  for  one  and  a  half  million  US  dollars  as  the  first  payment  of  a  5  million  dollar

contract  with  Exotic  Tropical  for  timber  concessions  and  the  purchase  of  machinery41.

According  to  other  media  sources,  and  in  line  with  the  purchasing  agreement,  Minin

sold timber assets to Forum Liberia for two million dollars.42

In  1999,  José  María  Muñoz  Suárez,  partner  in  Forum  Liberia  was  made  responsible  for

the  marketing  of  timber  extracted  in  Liberia.    Having  worked  in  timber  companies  in

Equatorial Guinea for ten years, he is very well informed of their operations.

Another  character  involved  in  this  intrigue,  is  Jesús  Martín  Fernández  Velasco,  of

Valladolid, Spain.  Before he joined Forum Liberia, Fernández Velasco was partner in a

security  systems  company  from  Alicante,  Spain,  with  Eric  Van  Offlen  (Belgian  citizen,

friend of the managers of Liberian Agriculture Company) and a former Spanish police

superintendent,  Gerardo  Castaño.  According  to  other  sources,  this  company  installed

the security system in the home of Charles Taylor.43

The president of Forum Africa in Spain, Jesús Fernández Prada, used to be president of

Forum  Filatélico,  a  philatelic  investment  company.    Fernández  Prada  resigned  as

president of this latter group of companies on 31 January 200144.  According to Spanish

national  press  reports45  Jesús  Fernández  Prada  declared  that  the  only  relationship  he

had with the Ukrainian Minin was a business deal for timber:  "We bought the assets of

his  company  through  Forum  Liberia  (....)    We  only  gave  him  a  promissory  note  for  one

and a half million dollars, guaranteed by me”.  Fernández  Prada  has  also  admitted  to

the press that he has visited Leonid Minin in Ibiza.

Another  Spanish  businessman  named  in  this  affair  is  Fernando  Fernández  Robleda,

Leonid  Minin's  partner  in  Liberia,  until  his  name  appeared  in  the  media.    As  Minin's

partner, he was responsible for the purchase and sale of equipment between ETTE and

Forum Liberia46.

Forum  Africa  is  a  member  of  the  Asociación  Española  de  Importadores  de  Madera

(AEIM)  (Spanish  Association  of  Timber  Importers).    This  association  has  not  yet  made

clear that it is no longer associated with the illicit exploitation of African forests.

I

CONCLUSIONS

t is an undeniable fact that the Liberian timber industry has financed and continues

to finance both the regional and national insecurity of Sierra Leone.  In order for the

peace  agreement  in  Sierra  Leone  to  have  any  measure  of  success,  all  current

international  endeavours  are  being  focussed  on  preventing  bordering  countries,  such

as  Liberia,  from  providing  supplies  and

logistic  support  to  the  militias  of  the

Revolutionary United Front (RUF).

Given the absolute control over revenue from timber exploitation in Liberia, as with the

diamond  trade,  there  is  increasingly  more  information  which  suggests  that  President

Charles Taylor uses a considerable amount of the income obtained from the sale and

exportation of timber to provide support to the RUF.

There  is  also  evidence  to  prove  that  Forum  Africa  practices  bad  timber  management

and that its operations in Liberia are enveloped in conflict.   It is also considered to have

been  proved  that  the  partners  of  this  company,  which  uses  Spanish  capital,  have

dealings with people implicated in the trafficking of arms.

Consequently, Greenpeace demands:

A TOTAL EMBARGO ON TIMBER AND TIMBER PRODUCTS FROM LIBERIA AS

WELL AS AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

THE LIBERIAN TIMBER TRADE AND REGIONAL INSECURITY.
