‘Climate change is market 
failure on the greatest scale 
the world has seen. It results 
from the fact that the costs of 
greenhouse gas emissions 
are not paid for by those who 
create the emissions.’

‘Our actions now cast their shadow far into the future. 
[Climate policy needs to] have the economics of risk at its 
core; and go beyond the marginal changes which are the 
usual daily fare of economists. 
Nicholas Stern, former Chief Economist of the World Bank 
Every year, 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of climate changing 
greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions are released by the 
degradation and burning of Indonesia’s peatlands – 4% of global 
GHG emissions from less than 0.1% of the land on earth. 
This report shows how, through growing demand for palm oil, 
the world’s largest food, cosmetic and biofuel industries are 
driving the wholesale destruction of peatlands and rainforests. 
These companies include Unilever, Nestlé and Procter & 
Gamble, who between them account for a significant volume of 
global palm oil use, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia. 
Overlaying satellite imagery of forest fires with maps indicating 
the locations of the densest carbon stores in Indonesia, 
Greenpeace researchers have been able to pinpoint carbon 
‘hotspots’. Our research has taken us to the Indonesian province 
of Riau on the island of Sumatra, to document the current 
activities of those involved in the expansion of palm oil. These 
are the producers who trade with Unilever, Nestlé and Procter 
& Gamble, as well as many of the other top names in the food, 
cosmetic and biofuel industries.
The area of peatland in Riau is tiny: just 4 million hectares, 
about the size of Taiwan or Switzerland. Yet Riau’s peatlands 
store 14.6Gt of carbon – if these peatlands were destroyed, the 
resulting GHG emissions would be equivalent to one year’s total 
global emissions.
Unless efforts are made to halt forest and peatland destruction, 
emissions from these peatlands may trigger a ‘climate bomb’.
FORESTS  AS TICKING  
CLIMATE  bOMbS
Forest ecosystems currently store about one and a half times 
as much carbon as is present in the atmosphere. Without 
drastic cuts in GHG emissions, climate change – which is in 
part driven by forest destruction – may soon tip these carbon stores into sources of emissions. Resulting temperature 
increase could disrupt ecosystems in ways that provoke yet 
more greenhouse emissions, potentially leading to further 
acceleration of climate change.
Conclusions from the world’s leading climate scientists in the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) show 
that large cuts in GHG emissions are needed rapidly. Time is 
desperately short. The greater the delay in realising emissions 
reductions, the higher the financial, social and ecological 
costs will be.

Indonesia offers a critical example of why GHG emissions arising 
from deforestation and land-use change need to be dealt with at 
the international level, by governments and corporations. 
Indonesia holds the global record for GHG emissions through 
deforestation, putting it third behind the USA and China in 
terms of total man-made GHG emissions. During the last 50 
years, over 74 million hectares of Indonesia’s forests have 
been destroyed – logged, burned, degraded, pulped – and its 
products shipped round the planet. 
Unlike industrialised country (Annex I) signatories to the 
Kyoto climate treaty, Indonesia – as a developing country 
– is not required to set a target to reduce its GHG emissions. 
Consequently, since the Kyoto Protocol provides no 
incentives for preventing the destruction of tropical forests, 
the expansion of palm oil into carbon-rich landscapes such as 
peatlands and rainforests makes short-term economic sense 
but no ecological sense.
In December 2007, negotiating teams from governments 
around the world will gather in Bali, Indonesia to thrash out an 
agreement that will ideally lead to an international plan to deliver 
deep cuts in global GHG emissions, as an extension of the 
current Kyoto climate treaty. 
These climate negotiations are first steps toward international 
political measures to tackle deforestation. Meanwhile, global 
industry continues business-as-usual, and is expanding into the 
world’s rainforests. ExECUT ivE SUmma Ry

PALM OIL’S bOOM!
NASA’s climate scientists warn that ‘continued rapid growth of 
CO2 emissions and infrastructure for another decade’ may make 
halting high-risk increase in global temperatures ‘impractical if 
not impossible’. 
A report published by the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP), in 2007, acknowledges that palm oil 
plantations are now the leading cause of rainforest destruction in 
Malaysia and Indonesia.
Indonesia has destroyed over 28 million hectares of forest since 
1990, largely in the name of land conversion for plantations. Yet 
the area of oil palm or pulp wood plantations established in this 
period was only 9 million hectares. This clearly implies that most 
of the companies obtained permits to convert the forest only to 
gain access to the timber. Rainforest continues to be destroyed 
for plantations because of the financial value of the timber.
Oil palm plantations feed a growing global demand for cheap 
vegetable oil used in the production of food, cosmetics and fuel. 
Compared to the year 2000, demand for palm oil is predicted to 
more than double by 2030 and to triple by 2050. 
A handful of powerful players control much of the international 
trade in palm oil from Indonesia, among them Cargill, the world’s 
biggest private company, the ADM-Kuok-Wilmar alliance, 
currently the world’s biggest biofuels manufacturer and Synergy 
Drive, the Malaysian government controlled company that is 
soon to become the world’s biggest palm oil conglomerate. 
Following business-as-usual logic, industry’s current expansion 
strategy – including taking advantage of concern about climate 
change to push palm oil as a source of biodiesel – casts an 
ominous shadow over our ability to cut emissions. 
Much of the current and predicted expansion oil palm 
plantations is taking place on peatlands which are among the 
world’s most concentrated carbon stores. Ten million of the 
22.5 million hectares of peatland in Indonesia have already 
been cleared of forest and have been drained, resulting in a 
substantial and continuing increase in GHG emissions as peat 
soils dry out, oxidise and even burn.
GHG emissions from peatlands are set to rise by at least 50% by 
2030 if predicted expansion proceeds.

In early 2007, through satellite monitoring, Greenpeace 
identified fire hotspots in Riau Province. 
Comparing and overlaying maps of peatlands and 
forest concessions signalled there was significant 
overlap between the location of fires, oil palm 
concessions and peatlands. 
The peat soils of this once heavily forested province of 9 
million hectares have the highest concentration of carbon 
stored per hectare of anywhere in the world. The area of 
peatland involved is small: just 4 million hectares – about 
the size of Taiwan or Switzerland. But they store 14.6Gt of 
carbon, or 40% of Indonesia’s peatland carbon. 
Riau’s huge carbon store is at high risk from drainage, 
clearance and ultimately from fire. Destroying these 
peatlands could release GHG emissions equivalent to one year’s total global emissions or to five years’ emissions from 
all fossil-fuel power plants in the world. 
A quarter of Indonesia’s oil palm plantations are located in 
Riau. By 2005, 1.4 million hectares of oil palm plantation had 
been established in the province. Data suggest that over one-
third of oil palm concessions in Riau are sited on peat.
Riau is facing further expansion in palm oil due to its available 
infrastructure. A further 3 million hectares of peatland forests 
are earmarked for conversion over the next decade. Where 
once there was mostly forest, soon half of Riau will be 
covered in oil palms. 
According to a 2001 report by the European Union and the 
Indonesian Ministry of Forestry, ‘It is inevitable that most new 
oil palm will be in the wetlands, as the more “desirable” dry 
lands of [Sumatra] are now occupied.’RiaU: a liT fUSE

The privately-held Duta Palma group is a company with major 
operations in Riau. It is one of Indonesia’s ten-largest palm oil 
refiners. 
Duta Palma now controls about 200,000 hectares of land, over 
half of it in Riau. This landbank overlaps significant areas of deep 
peat, which are theoretically protected under Indonesian law.
Greenpeace analysed satellite data from the period 2001-
2007. This showed significant forest clearance within several 
of Duta Palma’s contiguous concessions in Riau. According 
to official maps, nearly half of the total area of the concessions 
is on peatlands with a depth greater than 2 metres. One area 
is officially designated as protected peatlands, ie more than 3 
metres deep.
Measurements made by Greenpeace of the peat depth in 
October 2007 show that the concessions lie on very deep strata of peat ranging from 3.5 metres in depth outside the boundary 
of the concession to more than 8 metres in the middle of the 
concession area. Therefore, the entire area should be protected 
under Indonesian law.
Additional field investigations by Greenpeace confirms extensive 
peat drainage, including construction of large canals, and clear-
cutting of rainforests is happening across these concessions. 
Duta Palma is also involved in the destruction of habitat critical 
to endangered and protected species including the critically 
endangered Sumatran tiger.

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is a high 
profile initiative chaired by Unilever. Its members include 
major companies along the supply chain from plantations 
through to commodities traders, including Cargill and 
ADM, to the world’s food giants, including Cadbury’s, 
Nestlé and Tesco. Together they represent 40% of the 
global production and use of palm oil.
On-the-ground investigations by Greenpeace reveal 
that RSPO members are dependent on suppliers 
that are actively engaged in deforestation and the 
conversion of peatlands.ThE food GiaNTS
The RSPO board president Unilever is a major player 
in the global palm oil trade. It uses around 1.2 millionuses around 1.2 million 
tonnes of palm oil every year , or about 3% of total or about 3% of total 
world palm oil production, most of which originates 
from Indonesia and Malaysia. It uses palm oil in brands 
such as Flora margarine. 
Other leading brands including KitKat, Pringles, 
Philadelphia cream cheese and Cadbury’s Flake and 
leading companies including Gillette, Burger King and 
McCain are complicit in the expansion of palm oil at 
the expense of Indonesia’s peatlands.Who

Much of the global trade in Indonesian palm oil is handled 
by traders based in Singapore. Some of the largest 
Singapore-based commodity traders are RSPO members, 
including the ADM-Kuok-Wilmar alliance, Cargill, Golden 
Hope and Sinar Mas.
The traders are also processors, blending palm oil which 
originates from deforestation and peatland destruction 
through their refineries and biofuel facilities.
The companies’ control over the entire palm oil supply chain 
– from plantations in Indonesia to refined palm oil or biofuel 
– means that they are in a decisive position to affect and 
change the market.One RSPO member, a major food retailer, has 
complained to Greenpeace that efforts towards 
sustainability are hampered because: ‘…the global 
palm oil industry is unable at present to provide anyone 
with evidence of traceability beyond processor, to 
plantation level’. 
Consequently, consumer companies who manufacture 
products using palm oil have virtually no way of knowing 
whether or not the palm oil they are using is from rainforest 
destruction and conversion of peatlands. 
Through carrying on business as usual, the commodity 
trade and other big players are not taking the urgent action 
necessary to abandon dest ructive and socially unjust 
practices linked to the industry’s expansion.

‘The draining of wetlands to produce any type of biofuel 
would produce a loss of stored carbon that would take 
hundreds of years to make up through the biofuels’ annual 
greenhouse gas savings.’  
European Commission, 007
The scale of global diesel consumption dwarfs currently 
available feedstocks for biodiesel production. Substituting even 
10% of worldwide demand for diesel fuel for road transport 
would require more than three-quarters of total current global 
soya, palm and rapeseed oil production.
Biofuels have a relatively low financial value compared to 
other agricultural products. Therefore, biodiesel is generally 
made from the cheapest of the bulk oil crops: soya, palm and 
rapeseed. Palm is far more productive per hectare than either 
soya or rapeseed and is the most significant vegetable oil in 
the world, accounting for 30% of world edible oil production in 
2006/7. 
Feeding the growing demand for biodiesel is likely to take 
place through expanding palm oil plantations in Indonesia. Big 
commodity traders are already planning significant expansion in 
the biodiesel infrastructure. Once this is established, it will feed 
off forest destruction and fuel not only cars but climate change. 
Supplying Europe’s demand for biofuels is being driven by 
binding EU targets covering transport fuels. In early 2007, the 
EU Summit endorsed a minimum target for biofuels to constitute 
10% of transport fuels by 2020. This almost doubles the target 
of the 2003 Biofuel Directive of a 5.75% contribution by 2010. 
The increased target is dependent on production being both 
‘cost effective’ and ‘sustainable’.
Diesel fuel currently meets around 60% of the road transport fuel demand in Europe. Europe’s diesel fuel consumption was 172 
million tonnes (Mt) in 2005. According to one RSPO member 
company, there is insufficient rapeseed available to meet EU 
targets. Of the alternatives, ‘vegetable oil sourced from palm 
oil is among the most widely and commercially available’. The 
company predicts a growth in the demand for biodiesel of 52Mt 
between 2005 and 2030 in the EU alone as road transport fuel 
demand continues to rise. 
Meeting this projected growth in demand for vegetable oil 
through palm oil, for example, would require more than 15 million 
hectares of mature oil palm plantation. This is nearly three times 
the acreage that was under oil palm in Indonesia in 2005.
Many other countries from oil-dependent regions are turning 
to biofuels from Indonesia’s rainforests. This trade amounts to 
emissions transfer, not emissions reduction. GHG emissions 
associated with palm oil production, such as forest clearance, 
are attributed to the producer country. 
The Chinese government expects that biofuels will meet 15% 
of its transport fuel demand by 2020. India has set a target of 
securing 20% of its diesel fuel from biofuels by 2012. 
Greenpeace estimates that current plans for biodiesel refineries 
in Indonesia will create an additional biodiesel production 
capacity of up to 9Mt a year, including a 5Mt ‘mega-project’ 
planned by Sinar Mas. 
To feed this desire for an expansion in capacity, companies are 
thinking ahead and turning their attention to the region of Papua 
on the island of New Guinea – the last great expanse of rainforest 
in Southeast Asia. There is already evidence of large-scale 
land-grabbing in the name of biofuel, with one company alone 
reportedly laying claim to nearly 3 million hectares of forest. Biof UEliNG

Time is running out.
The debate is not whether we need to reduce emissions from 
fossil fuels in the industrialised world or whether we should stop 
deforestation in the remaining forests of the developing world. 
The inescapable reality is that we must do both, and now.
The increasing worldwide demand for vegetable oil for 
food, combined with current land-grabbing by biofuel 
companies – many of them RSPO members – is significantly 
increasing pressure on the world’s threatened rainforests 
and other vulnerable habitats. Continued clearance of 
tropical rainforests, and their replacement with agricultural 
commodity crops like palm oil, seems inevitable unless action 
is taken now by industry and governments. MAKING  bIG EMISSIONS 
CUTS  FAST : HALTING 
DEFORESTATION
Tropical rainforest destruction accounts for about one-fifth of 
global GHG emissions – more than the world’s cars, lorries and 
aeroplanes combined. Destruction of Indonesia’s peatlands 
alone accounts for almost 4% of global annual GHG emissions. 
Curbing tropical deforestation is one of the quickest, most 
effective ways to cut GHG emissions. 
Where can big emissions be cut quickly and cost effectively?
Cut one:  Cut global deforestation: annual emissions 
savings – up to Gt C o 
According to an IPCC report, up to 2Gt CO2 (equivalent of 
up to 4% of current annual GHG emissions) can be cut cost 
effectively. The report puts the cost for making these emissions 
savings at up to $100/tonne CO2.
Significantly, this figure does not include potential to halt 
emissions from peatland and other bog fires.
Cut two: Stop indonesian peatland fires, establish a 
moratorium on peatland conversion: annual emissions 
savings – .Gt C o 
The emissions from Indonesia’s peatland fires largely represent 
new expansion and peatland clearance. The best way to avoid 
these emissions is to stop further conversion of peat swamp 
forests. Since use of fire for forest or agricultural clearance is 
illegal, as is degradation of deep peat, the only cost is that of law 
enforcement and improved governance.
Cut three: Rehabilitate indonesia’s degraded peatlands: 
annual emissions savings – 0. Gt C o
Avoiding emissions from the ongoing decay of Indonesia’s 
degraded peatlands poses a cost effective opportunity to make 
rapid emissions reductions. The area involved is miniscule 
– about 10 million hectares or less than 0.1% of the earth’s land 
surface. One project being pursued by Wetlands International 
aims to rehabilitate 43,500 hectares of degraded peatlands in 
Central Kalimantan, avoiding the emission of 3.4Mt of CO2 a 
year, for a one-off investment of €500,000 (this equates to €0.15/
tonne).  This is small change in global climate change terms. 
Total cuts: potential annual emissions savings: up to 
.Gt C o . This equates to nearly % of current annual 
GhG emissions.
