INTRODUCTION

The world’s ancient forests are home to much of the Earth’s land-based species of plants, insects,

birds and animals. These forests regulate weather patterns and help stabilise the Earth’s climate. By
storing carbon, ancient forests play a critical role in reducing global warming. Approximately 433-billion
tonnes of carbon – more carbon than will be released from the burning of fossil fuels over the next 69
years – are stored in ancient forests. Ancient forests are home to as many as 200-million indigenous and
tribal people worldwide.1

Only 20% of the world’s original forest cover remains as large undisturbed areas of ancient

forests.2 The temperate rainforest on the West Coast of Canada (see page 4) is one of these areas, and it is
also one of the most threatened. The threat comes primarily from the logging giant International Forest
Products (Interfor).

A number of companies worldwide have taken steps to help protect this and other endangered
ancient forests, including the US home improvement chain Lowe’s, which ended all purchases from the
intact rainforest, and Swedish furniture giant Ikea, which has gone ancient-forest-destruction-free. Dozens
of other companies worldwide have cancelled contracts with Interfor and other companies actively
destroying the temperate rainforest.

One of the main aims of publishing this report is to provide Japanese companies and the public
with the information to make them aware of the possibility that they could be involved in the destruction
of ancient forests due to the complicated chain of custody, even if they do not wish to participate.
Companies and consumers who buy forest products have the power to choose which products to buy.
There is no doubt that companies in Japan, which is a big consumer country of foreign timber, can have a
big impact on remaining ancient forests by their policies and measures they take against the ancient forest
destruction in the future.

Although  a few companies in Japan are beginning to reject Interfor products, in the most part,

Interfor’s destructive forest products are sold without being noticed by Japanese forest consumer
companies. In this report, Greenpeace exposes the close ties between the destruction of Canada’s ancient
forests by Interfor and the Japanese market, and asks confirmed customers to stop buying directly or
indirectly from Interfor. The information was collected from Greenpeace Japan’s questionnaire in 1999,
by research conducted at ports, Internet search and other methods.

While West Fraser is another temperate rainforest destroyer, this report focuses specifically on

Interfor and its Japanese customers. We divide these customers into five business categories, for example,
trading firms or housing companies and provide a section on each category. In each section, we first give
summary of our findings, then we highlight a few companies with particularly close relationships with
Interfor.

Before publication, Greenpeace Japan sent the final draft to all the Japanese companies identified

as customers by the research to ask them to confirm, deny or cancel their contracts with Interfor. For the
replies of companies, please refer to Appendix 2 and 3. More than 70 companies identified in this report
have already committed to cancel their contract with Interfor. Full responses from companies are available
at Greenpeace Japan’s web site. ( http://www.greenpeace.or.jp ) ( Japanese only )

MAJOR FINDINGS

Interfor’s products are deeply entrenched in the Japanese market. These include logs and timber,

as well as pulp, newsprint, and other items produced by third party companies using Interfor fibre.

Investigations conducted by Greenpeace have found over 200 companies in Japan that buys

products along the chain of supply that starts with Interfor. These companies and their products include:

• Trading firms such as Itochu, Mitsubishi, Emachu, Tomen, Nissho Iwai, and Toyota Tsusho
• Housing companies such as Sumitomo Forestry, SxL, and Chuo Jutaku
• Exterior companies such as Toyo Exterior and Xyence
• Wholesalers such as Shimizuko Mokuzai Sangyo Kyodo Kumiai and Tanizake Mokuzai
• Distributors of mouldings and other remanufactured items
• Newspapers such as Yomiuri, Mainichi and Asahi
• Paper companies such as Oji Paper, Marusumi Paper, Kami Shoji, and Nisshinbo
• Paper products such as toilet paper, tissue, shopping bags, books and magazines

By purchasing wood, chips, pulp, newsprint and paper either directly or indirectly from Interfor,
all the companies listed (except those listed as taking positive steps) in this report are or could be helping
to fuel the destruction of the temperate rainforest. The confirmed customers are written in bold within the
text.

This report also reveals companies who refused to or did not answer the questionnaire distributed

by Greenpeace Japan in 1999.

GREENPEACE’S DEMANDS

(Please refer Greenpeace’s demand for protecting world ancient forest in ‘Buying destruction: a
Greenpeace report for corporate consumers of forest products 1999’, and a description of alternatives in
‘Re-Source: market alternatives to ancient forest destruction 1999’).

Demands to customers of International Forest Products

1) Demand that Interfor comply with the measures outlined below. Should Interfor fail to or refuse to
comply with these measures, customers of British Columbia (BC) forest products should refuse to continue
doing business with Interfor, and suspend all purchasing of Interfor products and Interfor-related fibre.

Demands to International Forest Products

1) Place a long-term moratorium on logging of all intact valleys and key ecological areas within their
tenure until the completion and adoption of a meaningful conservation and ecosystem-based management
plan for the coastal rainforest.

2) Commit to constructive engagement in the development of a meaningful conservation and ecosystem-
based management plan for the coastal rainforest.

3) Introduce an alternative harvesting programme that ends the practice of clearcut logging and
introduces variable retention logging, which reduces the volume of overall logging, as outlined in the
Clayoquot Sound Scientific Panel.

THE COASTAL TEMPERATE RAINFOREST OF CANADA

4

On the West Coast of Canada, nestled between high alpine reaches and the Pacific Ocean, lies a

thin stretch of temperate rainforest. This ancient forest is home to thousands of species of plants, birds,
animals, 1000-year-old cedar trees and 90-metre high Sitka spruce. Rich salmon streams weave through
valley bottoms providing food for magnificent creatures such as orcas, black bears, grizzlies and eagles.
Already over half of the world’s temperate rainforests have been destroyed. More than a quarter

of what remains is found on the west coast of British Columbia.

‘Half of the world’s temperate rainforests have been destroyed. One quarter of what remains is in British
Columbia’ – World Resources Institute, 1997

‘Uncovering insects and arachnids previously unknown in North America ... has scientists speculating not
only about what else might be out there in the temperate and tropical rainforests of the world, but also
what may have been lost and what remains to be saved.’ – Canadian Forest Service, Pacific Forestry
Centre, 1995. Applying the lessons from the top of Carmanah: ancient temperate rainforest canopy

Interfor: the World’s Worst Destroyer of Temperate Rainforest

Despite growing international concern about the fate of the world’s remaining ancient forests,

some logging companies continue to destroy these ancient trees. International Forest Products, also known
as Interfor, is one of the worst offenders, logging over three million cubic metres of wood each year.

In the past year, new information has emerged that reveal Interfor as one of the most intransigent

logging companies operating in the world's ancient forests.  This includes: Interfor's apparent tolerance
for its employees having assaulted peaceful activists; Interfor becoming one of BC’s largest exporters of
raw logs out of the province, which dramatically curtails local employment; and Interfor having
manipulated the stumpage system to pay as little as $.25 per cubic metre of wood cut back to the
government as a fee for logging on publicly-owned land (“Stumpage Sellout”, Sierra Legal Defence Fund,
January 2001). If Interfor is serious about becoming an environmentally responsible logging company, as
a corporation it must act immediately to address these issues in a substantive manner.

Logging Intact Rainforest Valleys

Fifty-three per cent of Canada’s ancient rainforest has already been logged,3 and less than a

quarter of Canada’s large rainforest valleys remain intact. Over 400 scientists have called for an
immediate end to industrial clearcut logging in these valleys,4 and the federal government’s Pacific
Fisheries Resource Conservation Council has recommended that logging be suspended throughout much
of the area, in order to protect wild salmon spawning grounds.

As a result, some British Columbian forestry companies began working with Greenpeace to place

a moratorium on logging in and around 100 intact valleys and other key ecological areas.  They took an
important step towards finding a long-term solution to historical conflicts. Seventy-seven per of British
Columbians support this process.5

Interfor and West Fraser were both part of this process, but both companies walked away from
the negotiations in 2000. Interfor resumed logging in a number of critically important rainforest valleys.
One valley, Ista, lies within the traditional territories of the Nuxalk First Nation, whose elders and head

hereditary chief Nuximlayc have gone to jail for their peaceful attempts to stop the logging of this sacred
site. Other valleys being clearcut by Interfor are home to species at risk of extinction, such as grizzly
bears, and contain endangered salmon runs. Interfor also plans to log other areas sacred to First Nations.
In addition, the company recently began blasting logging roads into the habitat of the Kermode Bear (a
rare white bear found nowhere else on earth) and areas densely populated by wolves.

In total, Interfor plans to log 18 intact valleys and other key ecological areas in upcoming years.
Further, Interfor is currently logging the habitat of endangered species on the border of a national park in
the world-renowned Clayoquot Sound and is blasting roads and cutting down 1000 year-old cedar trees in
the Elaho Valley.
Climate Change

Harvesting mature trees in British Columbia increases greenhouse gas emissions. Conversion of

primary forests to secondary forest or plantations in BC and around the world results in very large releases
of carbon to the atmosphere. Ninety per cent of forest harvesting in BC is in primary old-growth forests.
A German Advisory Council on Global Change review of scientific literature found 12 different

studies across boreal, temperate and tropical forests showing that conversion of primary forests to
secondary managed forests or plantations consistently results in large reductions in stored carbon and also
emissions to the atmosphere. The reductions in stored carbon in secondary forests and plantations ranged
from 25-67% compared to primary forests.6

A study in Pacific Northwest Douglas Fir forests – the area most comparable to coastal temperate

rainforests in BC where Interfor logs – found that ‘the amount of carbon stored in Pacific Northwest old-
growth is huge and that harvesting old growth results in a net release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
for at least two centuries.’7 The logging of 5.4 million hectares of old-growth in the US Pacific Northwest
since 1890 is estimated to have resulted in the release of 1.6-2.0 billion tonnes of carbon to the
atmosphere.8

Forest Certification

Companies around the world are demanding that forestry companies do not log in the world’s

endangered forest areas. They also want non-pristine areas to be sustainably logged to Forest Stewardship
Council (FSC) standards. This list includes US home improvement giant Lowe’s, Swedish furniture giant
Ikea, and companies such as Mitsubishi Electric of America and the Body Shop. Sixteen FSC buyers
groups have been established worldwide, including in the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria,
Switzerland, Germany, Brazil. The UK buyers group alone represents over £2 billion per year in wood
products, and have been called ‘one of the widest reaching environmental initiatives by a charity of all
time.’9 To date, the only wood certification model enjoying widespread support from both environmental
groups as well as in the marketplace is that of the Forest Stewardship Council, with its balanced multiple
stakeholder representation and performance-based standards, globally endorsed by environmental, social
and economic interests.

While two British Columbia logging operations have recently achieved FSC-certification and the
endorsement of environmental groups, Interfor shows no signs of reforming its logging practices in order
to receive FSC certification. Instead, Interfor has chosen to be certified by the inferior ISO 14001 system.
Unlike the FSC, the ISO and other certification systems have no performance standards and do not have
balanced stakeholder representation.10 The British Columbia government writes that ‘the ISO standard

does not set specific environmental performance criteria nor does it establish absolute requirements for
environmental performance’.11 Even the ISO itself admits that ‘ISO 14001 does not establish performance
requirements or specific criteria and indicators for defining sustainable forestry.’ It further states that
‘among misleading practices that ISO wants to put an end to are … giving the false impression that ISO
9000 is a product quality label, or that ISO 14000 is a label signifying a “green” or “environmentally
friendly” product. This is not so. They are not product standards.’12

‘The ISO standard does not set specific environmental performance criteria nor does it establish absolute
requirements for environmental performance.”’ – International Standards Organization

The Forest Practices Code

From June 1995 to June 1997, Interfor was charged and penalized 136 times for violations of

provincial legislation. This includes 57 infractions of the Forest Practices Code and 66 infractions of the
Forest Act. Interfor has also failed to comply with the Forest Practices Code on an additional 414
occasions. The company has been responsible for logging inside the boundaries of parks and for causing
landslides by logging on steep slopes.

In early 1998, after intense lobbying by Interfor and other logging companies, the government of

British Columbia weakened environmental protection by introducing more than 500 changes to existing
legislation. Changes include giving logging companies permission to conduct even larger clearcuts, and
reducing the public’s opportunities to comment on logging plans.

Given this, it is not surprising that most logging companies in British Columbia, including

Interfor, have high compliance with the Code. However, in no way is this an indication of sustainable
logging practices.

In May 2000, the labour union representing Ministries of Forests and Environment staff issued a

scathing report about lack of compliance. The report states that, as a result of sweeping government
budget and staff cuts, ‘the largest forest companies operating in the province are not properly inspected or
monitored.’13

A government-appointed independent watchdog in British Columbia recently issued a report

stating that ‘basic compliance with Code requirements is not sufficient to protect environmental values.’14

The federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and the BC Ministry of Environment, Lands

and Parks have come out with similar critiques of the Code, and a legal complaint has been lodged on the
grounds that the Code’s weak standards violates Canada’s commitment under NAFTA. Even Canadian
Forest Products (Canfor) president David Emerson recently stated that the Code has not worked, and that
BC is not a model of sound forest policy.15

Clearcutting

Clearcutting remains Interfor’s dominant logging method in the coastal temperate rainforest.

This is despite the fact that competitors such as Weyerhaeuser have committed to ending all clearcutting
in the temperate rainforest. Weyerhaeuser has been open with Greenpeace and other environmental
groups and has asked for input on its transition.

Interfor is also promoting helicopter logging as an environmentally friendly alternative; in fact, it

can be more destructive. Heli-logging makes it possible for Interfor to access trees located in highly
inaccessible areas of ancient forest, which are often located on steep providing de facto wildlife refugees.
In addition, the helicopters themselves can use up to 700 litres of fuel an hour – significantly more energy
than conventional logging methods.

Violence

In 1999, almost 100 Interfor workers and friends took the law into their own hands, and
confronted local environmentalists in the Stoltmann Wilderness. They vandalized a camp and assaulted
several individuals, three of whom were hospitalized. Subsequently, one Interfor worker has been
convicted of assault and four workers have been convicted of mischief. The employees traveled to the
camp using Interfor logging trucks. A company vice-president and three directors were in the region at
the time but did nothing to stop the vigilante attack. Interfor trucks and radios were used to co-ordinate
the violence. A senior Interfor official at the attack referred to the incident as ‘ethnic cleansing’.

Some Facts about Logging in British Columbia
• In 2000, the British Columbia Ministry of the Environment stated that one-in-ten plants and vertebrate
animals in British Columbia are vulnerable to extinction. Logging is cited as one of the major threats. 16

• BC has no Endangered Species legislation.

• The Forest Practice Code’s guidelines state that in up to half the areas logged, ‘the risk of some native
species being unable to survive in the area will be relatively high.’ 17

• Ninety-two per cent of logging in BC is done by clearcutting. In the fragile temperate rainforest areas,
97% of the logging is done by clearcutting. This is what the forest industry calls ‘world class forest
practices’. 18

• The BC Ministry of Forests’ own analysis concludes that current rates of harvest are averaging almost
40% above the government’s own definition of a ‘sustainable’ rate. In one rainforest region, Interfor and
other companies are logging at a rate 47% above what the government calculates to be sustainable over
the long-term.

• BC’s Forest Practices Code is often referred to by the BC government as ‘the toughest forest standard in
the world’. In reality, the Code does not even apply to logging on private lands, it allows clearcutting right
down to the banks of small streams sheltering endangered salmon, and in 1998 the government ‘rolled
back’ over 500 provisions of the Code, gutting environmental standards even further.

• In BC and the Yukon, 764 salmon stocks are extinct or at risk of becoming extinct. 19 Investigations in
the late 1990s revealed that 83% of audited streams in selected logging areas were cut right down to their
banks. 20

• Researchers from the University of Victoria announced in June 1998 the discovery of over 300 new
insect species living in the canopy (treetop vegetation) of the ancient rainforests of BC’s Carmanah valley.
These are insect species previously unknown to scientists anywhere else on earth and are found only in
old-growth forests.21

• Seventy-seven per cent of British Columbia residents polled believe that logging in BC’s old-growth
forests should be stopped immediately or phased-out. 22

The Japanese Connection to Canada’s Temperate Rainforest

Japan is the second largest importer of forest products from BC after the USA. Canadian wood is

strongly promoted in the Japanese market, and several Canadian agencies have offices in Japan (see box
below). In 1999, Japan imported US$ 1,310 million of logs and lumber, US$ 319 million of pulp, and US$
119 million of paper.23

Interfor sold Can$ 132 million (approximately US$ 90 million) to Japan in 1998 – about 22% of
their overall sales revenue.24 As many Interfor customers in Europe and the US have stopped buying from
Interfor over the last few years,25 Interfor’s intention to enlarge their market in Japan seems to be
hardening.

To expose the relationship between the Japanese market and Canadian logging companies which

were destroying the ancient temperate rainforest at the time (Interfor, West Fraser, Doman/WFP),
Greenpeace Japan sent questionnaires to 119 companies in May 1999 and received answers from 69
companies. Twenty-two of these companies confessed that they were buying directly or indirectly from at
least one of these three ancient forest destroyers.26

In February 2000, Greenpeace Japan launched a postcard campaign asking Japanese customers of

these three logging companies to stop buying their products. Four companies then committed to make no
further purchases from Interfor or WFP. As a result of these and other contract cancellations, WFP has
agreed to place much of their logging under a moratorium, and is engaged in a solutions process with
environmental groups.

However, contrary to WFP, Interfor continues to be part of the problem.27

Canadian PR

The British Columbian forest industry associations Council of Forest Industries (COFI,

www.cofi.org/japan) and the Canadian Plywood Association (CANPLY, www.canply.or.jp) share the
same office in Toranomon, Tokyo. An industry promotion group called ‘Zairai Partnership – Japan’ was
established exclusively for the Japanese market, and shares the office of the BC Government Tokyo
Representative in Akasaka, Tokyo.28 A joint government-industry partnership, the BC Wood Specialities
Group, has an office in Osaka. This is in addition to countless delegation visits organised by the BC forest
industry, BC provincial government and the Canadian government. For example, the ‘International
forestry partnerships program Japan to Canada tour’ hosted by Canadian government from 10-18 July
1999, invited delegations from the forestry agency, newspapers, paper association, and universities. This
included tours of ‘decent’ logging operations in BC.29 A similar tour was also held in 2000.

‘Zairai Partnership – Japan’ is a project of five major Canadian forestry companies: Interfor,

Weyerhaeuser, TimberWest, Doman-Western Lumber Ltd, and Primex Forest Products Ltd. Its specific
purpose is to promote BC Western Hemlock to the Japanese market. Most major logging companies in BC
are members of the Canadian Council of Forest Industries (COFI), and additional funding for Zairai
Partnership is provided by the BC government through Forest Renewal of British Columbia. The body
produces Hemlock timber with the logo of ‘Canada Tsuga’ and Japanese dealers of the timber are also
supplied with the display board30

Trading Firms

There are eight ‘Sogo Shosha’ (general trading firms) in Japan: Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Mitsubishi

Corporation, Sumitomo Corporation, Itochu Corporation, Marubeni Corporation, Nissho Iwai
Corporation, Tomen Corporation and Nichimen Corporation. Using their ample funds, human power
and extensive global networks, these huge companies support international commodities trade either
through direct bulk imports into Japan or by working as a trade agent for Japanese/foreign manufacturers.
Their business also includes provision of financial and investment services, planning and co-ordination of
industrial projects, consulting, manufacturing and retailing of products.31 In addition, there are ‘Senmon
Shosha’ (specialised trading firms) – these are smaller scale companies that trade in more specialised
items.32 Examples of timber specialised firms include companies such as Emachu Corporation, Nice
Corporation, and Sumisho Building Materials Co. Ltd..

Through Greenpeace Japan’s research, all of the eight general and several specialised trading
firms were found to purchase lumber or raw logs directly from Interfor. Tomen Corporation, a general
trading firm, was found to be one of the top Interfor lumber customers in the world. Tomen is partly
owned by Toyota Tsusho Corporation, a major customer of Norske Skog (see Paper Products section).
Trading firms have played a huge role in importing construction timber from Canada.33 More

recently, housing companies have taken to importing considerable amounts directly from Canada (see
Housing Companies section). In addition to construction timber, trading firms also import pulp (e.g.
Toyota Tsusho, Itochu, and Nissho Iwai – see Paper Products section) and western red cedar for decking
(e.g. Toyo Exterior Co., Ltd. – see Other Wood Products section) – all derived from ancient forest
destruction perpetrated by Interfor.

building products distribution chain Itochu Building Products/Prime Source Building Products and media
sales representation for Excite Japan, Co. Ltd.35

The division trading in wood products (log, lumber, chip, paper and pulp) is called ‘Chemical,
Forest Products & General Merchandise Company’ (President: Junichi Taniyama) and its trade accounted
for 16% of the total sales between April and September 2000.36

Relationship with Interfor

This company has strong links with Interfor’s ancient forest destruction. First of all, Itochu

Corporation buys lumber from Interfor via Itochu Canada Ltd.. CIPA Lumber Co. Ltd. is downsizing
in 2001.37 Itochu answered in the questionnaire that they source 35,000 m3/year total of construction
lumber either from Interfor, WFP/Doman, or WF, but did not specify from which company (source:
questionnaire). According to Itochu’s letter to Greenpeace Japan (dated 6 March 2001), they bought about
15,000 m3 of lumber for construction from Interfor in 2000. Itochu also buys Sauder mouldings (see
Other Wood Products section), which are produced in part using Interfor wood. Furthermore, Itochu
trades pulp from both Canfor and Norske Skog Canada, produced in part using Interfor fibre (see Paper
Products section) – none of which Itochu reported on when it responded to Greenpeace’s questionnaire.
Since the summer 1999, Interfor Japan has leased the planer facilities at Itochu Lumber Co.,
Ltd. processing mill, Sodegaura, Chiba, with the aim to recover Japanese demand of Hemlock lumber
from the BC coast. Interfor Japan imports oversized rough lumber produced by Interfor’s Fraser and
Mackenzie mills in BC, planes them at Itochu Lumber mill to produce Moya, Keta, Hashirakaku and sells
them to Japanese customers.38

The premises of Itochu Lumber Sodegaura mill incorporate its own wharf, receiving 150,000 m3
of wood/year including raw logs, and lumber yard of 58,876 m2.39 Itochu Lumber sells foreign lumber and
raw logs to around 500 clients mainly in Kanto area, but also re-manufactures lumber for both traditional
houses and 2x4 housing companies.40 Polus-Tec Co., Ltd.’s biggest pre-cut factory in Japan gets lumber
from both Interfor Japan and Itochu Lumber (see Housing Companies section).

Itochu Kenzai Co., Ltd. trades products of Itochu Lumber, Polus-Tec, Lumbertec,

Weyerhaeuser Company and Sauder.41

In June 2000, Itochu Corporation wrote to Greenpeace Japan stating that it regards the global

environmental problem as one of the most important items in its management policy and that it received
ISO14001 certification in 1997.42 The Environmental Report of Itochu states that its principle is “to
promote trades with as less environmental impact as possible”, and in order to carry out “the
environmental risk management in the handling of products”, they “use the ‘Life Cycle Analysis Method’

Company Profile

Mitsubishi Corporation is another major general trading firm with 481 consolidated

subsidiaries worldwide. The division trading wood products is Living Essentials Group and its sales
accounted for 26% of the company’s total between April and September 2000.44

Relationship with Interfor

Mitsubishi told Greenpeace Japan that it imports 10,000 m3 from Interfor.45 This figure is much

higher than the 3000 m3 total from Interfor and Doman the corporation originally reported in the
questionnaire. It trades Interfor Western Red Cedar for Toyo Exterior Co., Ltd. (see Other Wood
Products section), but it also sources Douglas Fir and Hemlock for traditional housing. The company has
said that it is committed to phasing out unsustainable wood from BC, which includes Interfor, but has not
as yet either taken any concrete steps or specified a timeline for action.46

Emachu is a big consumer of Interfor lumber. It receives foreign logs and lumber at 42 Japanese

ports, owns its own timber terminals and warehouses, including Raw Log Centre in Sodegaura, Chiba,
adjacent to Itochu Lumber Sodegaura mill. Emachu also has a subsidiary in Vancouver, Elk Trading Co.
Ltd., which buys directly from Interfor. Emachu refused to answer the questionnaire.

Housing Companies

Lumber sales account for about 70% of Interfor’s total sales. The US and Japan consume almost

all of Interfor’s lumber. In Japan, most of this wood is destined for housing constructions.48

In 1999, 1,214,601 new houses were built in Japan: Traditional post & beam houses accounted
for 81% (458,146) of the 565,544 timber frame houses constructed. The 2x4 housing method, which was
introduced into Japan from North America in 1974, has been appreciated for its reliability and strength
against earthquakes and fire – it accounted for 13% (65,864) of the timber houses built in 1999.49
Some wood arrives at housing companies via trading firms such as Itochu Corporation, or other trading
firms that specialise in housing, such as Nice Corporation, Sumisho Building Materials Co. Ltd. and
Emachu Corporation (see Trading Firm sections), but increasingly, major housing companies are buying
lumber directly from BC.

Greenpeace Japan found that at least four housing companies are directly buying Interfor wood.
They are: Sumitomo Forestry Co. Ltd. (see below for more information), which ranks second in Japan in
terms of the number of wood houses supplied, SxL Corporation, ranked 7th, Chuo Jutaku, ranked 22nd
and Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd..50

Greenpeace Japan found that Mitsui Norin’s lumber section buys lumber directly from Interfor.
Chuo Jutaku belongs to the Polus Group (www.polus.co.jp) with the annual sales of 95.5

billion yen for 1999,51 which consists of 24 companies engaged in different housing related businesses
from sourcing, processing and distribution of lumber to construction, trade and maintenance of houses.52
Chuo Jutaku buys 2x4 lumber indirectly from Interfor via Interfor Japan, Nissho Iwai, Nichimen, etc53.
Although the company says it does not stipulate Canadian lumber specifically and is willing to phase out
its products from BC ancient temperate rainforest and/or from ancient forests in general,54 so far, the
company has done nothing and continues to buy from Interfor. Another company in this group, Polus-Tec
Co., Ltd. (see below), owns Japan’s biggest pre-cut factory in Iwai-shi, Ibaragi-ken.

SxL Corporation did not answer the questionnaire.

Housing companies taking positive steps: Higashi Nihon House Co. Ltd (Japan) (see page 21), the
builders of Sydney Olympics (Australia); Matsuzaki Architects (Canada), 140 building corporations in the
Netherlands (Netherlands), Centex Homes (US), Kaufman & Broad (US), Ryland Homes (US)

Confirmed customers buying directly/ indirectly from Interfor: Sumitomo Forestry Co. Ltd., SxL
Corporation, Chuo Jutaku, Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. and Polus-Tec Co., Ltd.

Companies that refused to answer or did not answer the questionnaire: Sumitomo Forestry Co. Ltd. and

Company Profile

Sumitomo Forestry belongs to the Sumitomo Group, together with Sumitomo Corporation and

Sumisho Building Materials Co. Ltd. (see Trading Firms section). Sumitomo Corporation is 2.5%
shareholder of Sumitomo Forestry.55 It is famous for building high quality houses by post & beam method.
‘Sumirin Two by Four’ is a 100% Sumitomo Forestry owned company that makes 2x4 houses.56 It uses
both Japanese and foreign lumber (from USA, Canada, Europe, Indonesia and New Zealand). The
company has offices in Vancouver, Seattle, Amsterdam, New Zealand, PNG, etc., and owns production
bases in New Zealand and Indonesia. Sumitomo Forestry is very proud of is “houses made of ‘wood’
which are kind to people and the environment”.57

Relationship with Interfor

Sumitomo Forestry is one of Interfor’s top direct customers in the world. The company uses

Hemlock, Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar and Yellow Cedar from Canada, some of which it gets directly
from Interfor. Sumitomo Forestry operates also as a lumber trading firm and supplies lumber warehouses,
sawing companies, paper and plywood manufacturers and other housing companies with wood products.58
These businesses generated 41% of the total sales for the first half of 1999 (as opposed to 55% by housing
business).59

Itochu Group, Interfor Canada and Interfor Japan (Hem-Fir and Hemlock) supply most of Polus-

Tec’s North American timber.

Polus-Tec is switching some of its supply from Canadian to European wood. There are two
reasons: (1) Hemlock  has defects from shrinking because it is not kiln-dried (note: the BC Ministry of
Forest is trying to encourage more kiln drying in BC as a result), (2) European wood is cheaper because
the Euro is weak.

Customers

Polus-Tec builds about 100 houses per month.61 In addition to its own houses, the remaining 80%

of its wood is sold to more than 100 other house construction companies. Mitsui Norin is one of its
customers, but most of the customers are small companies who could be getting Interfor lumber without
being informed of the damage it causes to the environment.

Other Wood Products

This section provides an overview of other uses and users of Interfor wood in Japan.

Exterior: Western Red Cedar has characteristics suitable for outdoor use. At least two Japanese

exterior companies use Interfor lumber. Xyence Corporation produces playing facilities, decking,
benches, bridges, etc. to be used in parks. A profile of Toyo Exterior Co., Ltd. is provided below.

Wholesalers/distributors and other wood related business companies: Greenpeace Japan found
many companies buying Interfor lumber directly. These companies are importers, lumber wholesalers,
distributors, remanufacturers, etc., and sometimes their operations cover multiple areas. Companies found
include: Shimizuko Mokuzai Sangyo Kyodo Kumiai, Tanizake Mokuzai, Shinkiba Yuso Center, and
Tokyo Kiba Seizai Kyodo Kumiai. Seven of Interfor’s customers are recommended as sources of WRC
by COFI: Rinyu Co. Ltd., Lumbertec Company, Shingu Shoko, Sanyo Lumber Co., Ltd., Nagai Co.
Ltd., Musha and Co. Ltd., M. Hasegawa & Co. Ltd..62 Rinyu Co. Ltd. buys 1200 m3/year from
Interfor,63 acts as a wholesaler of lumber or housing materials, a retailer of furniture and DIY items and
also as a housing company.64

Foreign remanufacturers: There are some Canadian or American companies such as Sauder
and Orepac that export housing materials and resawn lumber, such as, moulding, doors, flooring and
decking made from Interfor wood to various companies in Japan (see below for highlights).

Other: Joyful Honda has bought Western Red Cedar from BC, though it has not specified
whether or not it is from Interfor.65 Some companies took positive steps to end their involvement in
ancient forest destruction as Fuji Sankei Living Service did (find out what they have done in Page 21, List
of Companies Taking Positive Steps).

Other wood trading companies taking positive steps: Lowe’s (US), Menards (US), 84 Lumber (US),

Sauder is very closely linked with Interfor: it is owned by Interfor’s former CEO and main

shareholder in Interfor, and the company has shared offices with Interfor in the past. Interfor lumber is a
significant part of its supply, which it uses to produce doors, mouldings and building materials.

Itochu Corporation and other companies including Rikkyo International,69 Santa Tsusho,70

First Trading, Tsujii Home Depot, Japan Seahurst Group and Doorcraft Japan trade Sauder products
in Japan.

Newspapers

Japan is the world’s second largest consumer of newsprint. In 1999, Japan consumed 3.6 million

tonnes of newsprint, or 10% of the world’s total.71

Newspapers are highly regarded in Japan and 93% of households and offices subscribe to

newspapers and get them delivered daily.72 As a result, the circulation number is very high. In 1998, for
example, the number of newspaper circulation per 1000 people in Japan was 576, this was the second
largest circulation in the world after Norway.73

Although almost all used newspapers are collected, the recycled content of Japanese newspapers

is still low (said to be 55%).74

While there is only one mill in Japan that produces 100% recycled newsprint (Daio Paper’s

Iwaki mill produces 8,500 tonnes/month),75 the national average recycled content of newsprint produced in
Germany is almost 100%, proving it is possible to dramatically increase recycled content.76

In Japan, newspaper companies source newsprint from a variety of newsprint providers: Oji
Paper Co., Ltd., Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd. and Daishowa Paper Mfg. Co., Ltd. (these two will
merge to form the Nippon Unipac Holding in March 200177), Daio Paper Corporastion, Marusumi Paper
Co., Ltd., plus a few smaller companies and imports.

Newsprint containing Interfor fibre comes to Japan from three primary sources: Oji Paper’s

Howe Sound Pulp and Paper mill (BC, Canada), Norske Skog Canada, and Marusumi Paper
(headquartered in Ehime, Japan) (see Paper Products section). Greenpeace is working to encourage these
pulp and paper companies to shift their purchasing policies away from using Interfor fibre towards less
environmentally-damaging sources of wood fibre. Greenpeace Japan found that four major national
newspapers use newsprint containing Interfor fibre: The Yomiuri Shimbun buys newsprint from all three
of these sources (see below). Asahi Shimbun Publishing Co. and The Mainichi Newspapers Co., Ltd.
get HSPP and Marusumi newsprint. Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc.buys Marusumi newsprint. A religious
newspaper, Seikyo Shimbunsha, was also found to use HSPP and Marusumi. Around the world, a few
other newspapers buy fibre contaminated with Interfor, such as Los Angeles Times (US), Seattle Times
(US), and Oriental Daily News (Hong Kong), but in general, Japanese newspapers stand out
internationally in terms of ancient forest destruction.

Newspaper companies paper manufacturers taking positive steps: Daio Paper’s Iwaki mill, Blick
(Switzerland), New York Times (US), Aylesford Newsprint (UK), German newspaper industry (Germany)

Company Profile

Oji Paper is the fourth largest paper manufacturing company in the world, measured in
tonnes/year. It has offices worldwide, including Düsseldorf, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seattle, and Atlanta
(source: Oji Paper Annual Report).

In terms of newsprint, Oji Paper is the ninth largest producer (in weight) in the world in 2001,78

and currently supplies about 30% of the newsprint used for Japanese newspaper production.79 Oji owns
three newsprint mills. Two are in Hokkaido, Japan, capable of producing recycled newsprint, and Howe
Sound Pulp and Paper (HSPP) in BC, Canada .80

Relationship with Interfor

Oji Paper’s mill in BC is one of Interfor’s top customers for logs and chips; in fact, it is within

Interfor’s top 10 customers worldwide. HSPP produces 210,000 tonnes of newsprint/year, none of which is
post-consumer recycled.81 This is approximately 15% of Oji Paper’s total newsprint production.82 Three
major newspapers in Japan, Yomiuri, Asahi, and Mainichi and a religious newspaper, Seikyo, all use
this newsprint.

Oji Paper claims that paper production in general is environmentally friendly because it uses

only woodchips, a by-product of the lumber industry. This is incredibly misleading: not only are the wood
chips a primary product of the lumber industry (i.e. lumber mills are designed to produce both lumber and
woodchips), but Oji’s mill in BC is also the largest user of Interfor raw logs of any pulp and paper
producer in the world. In total, about half of all ancient forests logged in British Columbia are turned into
paper products.83

Company Profile

With a circulation of around 10.3 million, Yomiuri is one of the largest newspaper in the world.84

It published 37.4% of morning edition newspapers sold in Japan in 1995.85

Relationship with Interfor

Yomiuri uses Oji Paper’s Howe Sound newsprint, Marusumi newsprint, and has used Norske

Skog’s Crofton newsprint on a trial basis – all of which contain fibre from ancient forest destruction.

Other newspapers around the world have taken positive steps to end their part in forest

destruction. For example, Switzerland’s Blick newspaper increased its recycling content to 85%, and the
New York Times reduced its paper usage by changing its margins and layout. This shows that newspaper
production in Japan should be possible without using fibre from ancient forest destruction.

Paper Products

About half of the trees logged in British Columbia’s ancient forests end up as pulp and paper.86
Japan is the second largest buyer of pulp from BC after USA and bought US$ 319-million worth of pulp
in 1999.87 Japanese paper mills, concentrated in Shikoku and the Fuji areas, use this pulp to produce
thousands of products ranging from books and shopping bags to tissue and toilet paper.

Interfor’s two largest customers that buy chips and logs to produce market pulp are Norwegian-

owned Norske Skog Canada and Canadian-owned Canfor. Both have sales offices in Japan (Tokyo):
Fletcher Challenge Pulp Sales (Japan) Ltd, Fletcher Challenge Paper Sales, and Canfor-Georgia Pacific
Japan. As with lumber, Japanese trading firms play an important role as importers of pulp containing
trees from pristine valleys and ecologically important areas logged by Interfor. Eleven firms were found to
buy either from Norske Skog and/or Canfor’s coastal mills to supply around 30 Japanese paper
manufacturers. Six of these 11 firms (Itochu Corporation, Nissho Iwai Corporation, Nichimen
Corporation, Marubeni Corporation, Sumitomo Corporation, and Mitsui & Co., Ltd.) are also
implicated in the direct trade of Interfor lumber and/or raw logs (see Trading Firms section). Some of
them, such as Sumitomo, buy from West Fraser, another ancient forest destroyer in BC. The biggest
traders are (1) Toyota Tsusho Corporation (22.8% owned by Toyota Motor Corporation88) whose past
and current customers include Marusumi Paper Co., Ltd. and (2) Nissho Iwai, whose past and current
customers include Kami Shoji, Nisshinbo Industries, Inc. and Hayashi Shoji.

Note that Oji Paper Co., Ltd. appears here again as an ancient forest destroyer. Not only does

it buy fibre directly from Interfor as explained in the previous section, but also Oji Paper buys Norske
Skog Canada pulp directly, as does Japan Pulp & Paper Co., Ltd., which is 13.4% held by Oji and is the
largest trading firm specialised in the trade of pulp and paper.89 Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. also buys Norske
Skog pulp for fibre cement to use in insulating material. Other paper manufacturers that have used Norske
Skog pulp include Daishowa Paper Mfg. Co., Ltd., Hokuetsu Paper Mills Ltd., Chuetsu Pulp & Paper
Co., Ltd. and Rengo Co., Ltd..

Itochu, Nissho Iwai, Mitsui, Daishowa, Hokuetsu, and Rengo were found to have
relationships with Interfor via their purchases of pulp from Norske Skog and Canfor, however, they did
not reveal these relationships in their questionnaire answers.

Company Profile

Marusumi Paper is a large Japanese paper company. Marusumi relies increasingly on imported

chips and it ships them from Canada using its own vessels.90

Relationship with Interfor

Marusumi is probably the largest customer of Norske Skog Canada in Japan, having bought over

10,000 tonnes of Interfor-contaminated pulp in 2000 via Toyota Tsusho Corporation trading firm. The
pulp, made of trees from the coastal temperate rainforest, can get mixed up with other pulp used by
Marusumi for the production of 44,500 tonnes per month of paper, including newsprint, shopping bag
paper, telephone directory or books/magazine paper.91 Marusumi also gets chips containing interior
ancient forests logged by Interfor and other companies, via the Fibreco facility in Vancouver. This means
that paper produced by Marusumi is contaminated by ancient forest of interior BC, or in addition, by
coastal rainforests logged by Interfor.

Marusumi’s customers are wide ranging: newspaper customers have included The Mainichi
Newspapers Co., Ltd. , Asahi Shimbun Publishing Co., Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc., The Yomiuri
Shimbun, Seikyo Shimbunsha and many local newspapers; shopping bag customers have included
Kodak Japan Ltd., Cannon Inc., Fujiya Co., Ltd., Ezaki Glico Co., Ltd.; and books/magazines have

included Kodansha, Shueisha, Shogakukan, Fusosha, Hakusensha, Higashi Nihon Denshin Denwa
(NTT), Recruit, Pia Corporation, Gakken Co., Ltd., Tokuma Shoten, Nihon Bungeisha and some
governmental departments, such as National Personnel Authority, National Police Agency and Atomic
Energy Commission.  It is highly probable that all of these companies and governmental departments are
implicated in ancient forest destruction even without their will.

Tissue Companies

A number of tissue and toilet paper companies and brands in Japan have been found to contain

fibres originating from ancient forest destruction in BC, including Norske Skog Canada’s coastal mills.
Kami Shoji (Miyakawa 1-2-27, Iyo Mishima-shi, Ehime 799-0404 Japan, Phone: +81-896-23-

5400, Fax: +81-896-23-5469, www.ehime-iinet.or.jp/ehime/corp/kami/hyoushi.htm) is the Norske Skog
Canada’s largest tissue customer in Japan. It acts also as a paper and pulp trading firm engaged in
sourcing of materials, products development, production, wholesale and distribution. Kami Shoji Group
has a company called Ellemoi that produces tissue and toilet paper using pulp from Norske Skog’s coastal
mills.

Nisshinbo Industries, Inc. (Tokyo Main office: Nihonbashi Ningyo-cho 2-31-11, Chuo-ku, Tokyo

103-8650 Japan, Phone: +81-3-5695-8833, www.nisshinbo.co.jp) is another customer of Norske Skog,
which uses Norske Skog pulp to produce Peach toilet paper or kitchen towel at the Shimada mill.

Crecia Corporation, producer of Scottie brand toilet and tissue paper, has bought pulp from

Norske Skog Canada.

There are other customers that have bought some pulp from Norske Skog on a spot basis in the
past: Hayashi Shoji (producer of Hello Kitty toilet paper brand, plus other tissue products), as well as
Meiji Seishi. Bounty brand paper towels produced in the U.S. by Proctor & Gamble using fibres of
another BC ancient forest destroyer, West Fraser, are also available on the Japanese market.

JAPANESE COMPANIES TAKING POSITIVE STEPS

As a result of Greenpeace Japan’s postcard campaign in February 2000, five companies have

taken positive steps to end their participation in ancient forest destruction. A housing company, Higashi
Nihon House Co. Ltd used to buy Interfor lumber, but has either already switched or is looking for
alternative sources. Fuji Sankei Living Service, a mail order company, has made a commitment not trade
in furniture made of Interfor wood, and also plans to write to its suppliers to ask them to confirm the
source of their wood, and not to supply any products made of Canadian ancient forest destruction.
Mitsubishi Rayon Co. Ltd first replied to the questionnaire that it had made no purchase from the ancient
temperate rainforest of British Columbia. However, although it was not targeted by the postcard
campaign, Mitsubishi Rayon wrote to Greenpeace Japan that it had found such pulp in its supply, and
would try to switch to alternatives.
