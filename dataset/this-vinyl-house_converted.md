Greenpeace tested a variety of common
polyvinyl chloride (PVC or vinyl) con-
sumer products, with uses from childcare
to home furnishing, for phthalate plasti-
cizers and lead, cadmium and organotin
stabilizers. In earlier investigations, we
detected the presence of hazardous levels
of phthalates and cadmium and lead in
toys and other PVC products manufac-
tured for children. Toys, however, repre-
sent only a small part of the PVC market.
On the other hand, construction materials
including home furnishings, from hard
(e.g., window frames, pipes) to softened
(e.g., floor and wall coverings, acces-
sories) products, account for 76% of PVC
use. Although the most direct exposure
of children to hazardous additives may
be expected from toys and childcare
items, the wide variety of other vinyl
products in the home may also act as sig-
nificant sources of exposure. Greenpeace
therefore expanded its investigations to
include materials in the home made of
vinyl, such as wallpaper and floor cover-
ings, that children come into contact with
on a daily basis.

In this study, we found that:

• All products tested contained

detectable levels of phthalates, with a
maximum of 39% by weight in a drink-
ing straw. Indeed, some of the highest
levels were found in products specifi-
cally designed for children’s mouths.

• Virtually all of the products contained

significant amounts of organotins. Floor
tiles, on which children spend a lot of
time crawling and playing, and wallpa-

4     This Vinyl House

per were the two products containing
the highest levels.

• Vinyl products for everyday use, con-
taining larger amounts of hazardous
additives than any other plastic, can be
readily purchased at popular retail
stores in the United States.

Greenpeace is concerned about this
widespread availability of vinyl products
containing substantial levels of phthalates
and organotins since these additives leach
from PVC and are untested and/or are
associated with a number of serious
health effects in animals.

With respect to phthalate plasticizers,
scientific studies have shown that:

• Humans have phthalates in our bodies.
A recent Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) study confirmed the presence of
two of the phthalates detected in this
study in a test population.

• The offspring of rats fed the three

phthalates detected in this study, name-
ly diethyl hexyl-, diisononyl- and ben-
zyl butyl phthalate (DEHP, DINP and
BBP, respectively), do not follow nor-
mal patterns of sexual development.

• There is reason for concern that DEHP
may impair male reproductive system
development in human infants and
toddlers.

• DINP causes liver tumors and damages

the kidneys in rodents.

• The amount of DINP and other phtha-
lates that leach from a product does
not always correlate with the amount
the product contains.

• DEHP-exposed rats and mice have a

higher propensity for liver cancer than
non-exposed animals. Furthermore, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and the Department of Health and
Human Services (DHHS) consider
DEHP to be a probable human carcino-
gen. That is to say, DEHP may reason-
ably be considered a cancer causing
substance in people.

In the case of metal stabilizers, it is scien-
tifically accepted that:

• Breathing or swallowing organotins can
interfere with the nervous system, and
even cause death at high levels of
exposure.

• Organotins have adverse effects on
marine wildlife and rats, including
reduced reproduction and developmen-
tal problems.

• Organotins build up in the fat of fish,

rats and mice.

Greenpeace considers the use of phtha-
late plasticizers and metal stabilizers in
common PVC consumer products unac-
ceptable since it results in our needless
and avoidable exposure to hazardous
substances - exposure about which most
people remain unaware. PVC requires
more additives than any other plastic.
Eighty-six percent of all phthalates made
are used as PVC additives, and that num-
ber is expected to climb. It has also been
estimated that almost 70% of all organ-
otins are devoted for use in PVC. Clearly,
if we replaced PVC with alternate materi-
als that already exist, our direct exposure
to phthalates and organotins would drop
dramatically.

PVC’s need for chemical additives is only
part of its hazard - its lifecycle has seri-
ous, negative consequences. Dioxin is a
confirmed human carcinogen (cancer-
causing substance), and one of the most
potent toxins known to man. Together,
PVC manufacture and disposal represent
one of the largest sources of dioxin. For
these reasons, Greenpeace advocates the
phase-out of all PVC plastics.

This Graco stroller raincover contains DEHP,
a phthalate that some manufacturers have
voluntarily removed from their products.

Introduction

Reasons for conducting this study

The global production of vinyl (also
called PVC or polyvinyl chloride) was last
estimated at approximately 51 billion
pounds per year. (Stringer 2001) PVC
takes many forms, being used to produce
anything from food wrap, medical
devices and children’s toys to construc-
tion materials. To play all of these roles
however, PVC must be mixed with addi-
tives since it is a hard, brittle plastic if left
untreated. Chemicals known as phthalates
are the most commonly used to plasticize
PVC. (Bizarri 1996) These chemicals are
characteristically oily liquids that soften,
but do not bind to PVC when mixed.
Because phthalates do not form tight
bonds with PVC, they are able to leach
out of vinyl products during normal use
and after disposal. (Cadogan 1993)

Fueled by the hazards of PVC additives,
Greenpeace undertook a study to deter-
mine the amount of phthalates present in
vinyl products designed for a potentially
sensitive and vulnerable population,
namely children. That 1997 investigation
found up to 40% by weight of phthalates,
primarily diisononyl phthalate (DINP), in
toys bought in 17 countries from around
the world. (Stringer 2000) Toys, however,
represent only a small percentage of the
PVC market. Construction materials on
the other hand, including vinyl siding,
pipes, home furnishings and accessories,
account for 76% of PVC use. (Chemical
Economics Handbook 1997) Greenpeace,
therefore, undertook this study of a wider
assortment of vinyl products, including

6    This Vinyl House

wallpaper, floor coverings and childcare
items that children are likely to come into
contact with in their everyday lives. The
descriptions of the products are shown in
Table 1 (page 17).

Phthalate plasticizers are only one class
of additives that PVC requires. Without
additives, PVC is not only brittle but it is
also relatively unstable. Stabilizers, often
metals, are added to PVC to keep it from
breaking down and to give it stability
against heat. (DiGangi 1997) Lead and
cadmium were widely used for these pur-
poses, but regulations brought on by
their known human health hazards have
forced manufacturers to replace them
with other metals in some products.
Organotins have long been used in com-
merce (Sadiki 1996) and as such, they
made attractive candidates for replace-
ments of the known hazardous stabilizers.
However, the increased use of organotins
as PVC stabilizers does not mean that
they have a ‘clean bill of health.’ In fact,
evidence is mounting against them. In the
face of emerging reports that organotins
also leach from PVC (Sadiki 1999) and
are hazardous to humans (Boyer 1989,
Champ 2000, ASTDR 1992), Greenpeace
also tested the products included in this
study for their organotin content. We did
not test the leaching of either phthalates
or organotins from PVC since it is already
established to occur. (Cadogan 1993,
Sadiki 1999) Furthermore, leaching rates
are dependent upon a variety of factors
such as heat, age of the product and fric-
tion. (DiGangi 1997)

This Gerber diaper cover and The First Years
changing mat contained significant levels of
one phthalate, DINP. In addition, the changing
mat contained organotins and bisphenol A.

Routes of human intake of phthalates

A recent study released by the CDC con-
firmed that humans have certain phtha-
lates in our bodies. (U.S. CDC 2001)
Eating, breathing and skin contact, as
well as transfusion, are all ways, either
together or alone, that different phtha-
lates make their way into our systems.
According to the EPA, eating is probably
the main route by which humans are
contaminated with diethylhexyl phthalate
(DEHP), the most widely used phthalate
plasticizer. (U.S. ASTDR 1993) In the
same way, we are contaminated with
other commonly used phthalates such as
diisononyl phthalate (DINP). (Opinion on
Phthalate migration 1998, U.S. CPSC
1998a) Children may take in higher than

average amounts because their chew toys
are made of highly phthalate-softened
PVC (e.g., teethers). Indeed, the highest
levels of DINP released from teethers and
toys exceeded the acceptable daily intake
level in studies, conducted in the
Netherlands and Denmark, that simulated
children’s mouthing behavior. (Opinion
on Phthalate migration 1998, U.S. CPSC
1998b) Furthermore, a Dutch study con-
firmed what most of us have observed -
children suck or chew their fingers and
other things that are not intended to go
into their mouths more than chew toys.
(Groot 1998) This unintended chewing
undoubtedly adds to their overall intake
of phthalates.

Transfusion is another route of human
phthalate exposure. Phthalates leach from
PVC medical devices into solutions that
are then fed into the patient. (Rossi 2000,
Tickner 1999) People who are ill, espe-
cially children whose systems are still
developing, may be particularly sensitive
to this type of exposure. Concerns have
in fact been raised that the developing,
but not mature, male genital tract in
humans may be adversely affected by
high levels of DEHP. (U.S. National
Toxicology Program 2001)

Breathing in air and dust containing
phthalates that have off-gassed from PVC
flooring also adds to the amount of
phthalates in our systems. (Cadogan 1993,
Rossi 2000) Again, this is of particular
concern with respect to children since
they spend a lot of time indoors with a
breathing range close to the floor.

Although uptake of phthalates through

This Vinyl House     7

skin contact with PVC would not be
expected to play a large role in human
contamination, it should be considered
when thinking about our cumulative
phthalate intake. This is particularly true
for children who touch PVC products and
then put their fingers into their mouths.

Regulations on phthalate use

Prompted by the potential of babies to
intake dangerous amounts of phthalates
and the serious, negative health effects
they cause in animal studies, the
European Union placed an emergency
ban on the use of certain phthalates in
toys made for children under the age of
three in 1999. (Official Journal of
European Communities 1999)  This emer-
gency ban was recently renewed for the
fifth time. (European Commission 2001)
In the United States, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and
the Toy Manufacturers of America (TMA)
agreed upon a voluntary limit of DEHP at
3% in pacifiers and teethers in 1986.
(TMA 1986) Later in 1998, the CPSC
responded to Greenpeace calls and asked
toy manufacturers to voluntarily withdraw
PVC teething rings and rattles containing
DINP from the market. (U.S. CPSC 1998c)
However, such agreements do not stop
the use of, and children’s exposure to
hazardous or untested additives. DINP is
a poorly defined mix of as many 100
chemical variants, and the CPSC states
that the composition of DINP in chil-
dren’s products is unknown and was
unknown in 1986 when the toy industry
began using it after concerns about DEHP
came to light. (U.S. CPSC 1998b) In addi-
tion, the CPSC states that, "It is conceiv-

8     This Vinyl House

able that one or more existing types of
DINP for which data are unavailable
could also be more toxic and/or carcino-
genic," than the types of DINP that have
been tested. (U.S. CPSC 1998b)

Regulations are also in place for phtha-
lates in plastics that come into contact
with food such as during its processing,
transportation and storage. The Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) states that
butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and
diisononyl phthalate (DINP) "may be
safely used" at levels up to 1% and 43%,
respectively. (U.S. FDA 21CFR178.3740
2000) Closer inspection reveals legislative
provisions that are very likely to be bro-
ken. For example, the regulation states
that the plastics should be used "at tem-
peratures not exceeding room tempera-
ture." (U.S. FDA 21CFR178.3740 2000)
That suggests that eating food from a
plastic container at a summer picnic, or
warming food wrapped in plastic in a
microwave may be considered unsafe.
Worse still is that plastic products are
often unmarked, leaving consumers
unable to make informed decisions.

Routes of human intake of
organotins

Ingestion and inhalation represent the
major ways by which we take in organ-
otins, although skin contact may also be
a route of contamination. (U.S. ASTDR
1992)

Canadian studies have shown organotins
in water from PVC pipes containing
organotin stabilizers. (Sadiki 1999)
Clearly, drinking tainted water is a route

that organotins can make their way into
our bodies. In addition, organotins in the
environment build up in the fat of fish.
(Boyer 1989, U.S. EPA 2001) By eating
these fish, we again introduce organotins
into our systems.

Because organotins are found in dust
(Santillo 2001), perhaps due to their
release from plastics and other textiles,
breathing is another way that humans are
contaminated by organotins. This and
previous research conducted by
Greenpeace and the Healthy Flooring
Network in the United Kingdom con-
firmed the presence of organotins in vinyl
flooring, carpets and wallpaper. (Allsopp
2001, Allsopp 2000)

Although it is not clear whether skin con-
tact with PVC containing organotins
adversely effects our health, workers
exposed to paint containing tributyltin, or
TBT, developed skin inflammation among
other symptoms. (Boyer 1989, Champ
2000, U.S. ASTDR 1992)

Regulations on organotin use

Traditionally, organotins are used as anti-
fouling agents in paint applied to ships to
keep the growth of algae and other
marine life to a minimum. (Champ 2000)
Although organotins are very effective at
this task, marine life has unfortunately
suffered as a result. In response to this
threat, the U.S. Congress made organotins
the only chemicals to have exclusive
environmental legislation. (Champ 2000)
The Organotin Antifouling Paint Act of
1988 prohibits the use of paint containing
organotins on water vessels shorter than

twenty-five meters. The Act also prohibits
the sale of paint containing organotins
not certified by the EPA. (Champ 2000)
Other countries have even more stringent
regulations in effect. Both Austria and
Switzerland have banned all use of TBT
paints on vessels in freshwater. (Champ
2000) Germany, in addition to having
similar restrictions to those in the United
States, has regulations that limit TBT to
3.8% in paint and that require organotin-
containing paint to be safely disposed.
(Champ 2000)

The threat of organotins in products
besides paint has also been recognized.
In the United States, the FDA limits cer-
tain organotins to 3% in plastics that con-
tact food (U.S. FDA 21CFR178.2650 2000).
The organotin air limit set by the
Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) is
0.1 milligrams/cubic meter. (U.S. ASTDR
1992) Depending upon the organotin, this
number translates to 0.000002% at the
very most.

Findings

All PVC products tested contain
detectable levels of phthalates

Twenty common, vinyl consumer prod-
ucts were tested for phthalate plasticizers,
and the results of the tests are summa-
rized in Table 1 (page 17). They show
that diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP),
diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and butyl
benzyl phthalate (BBP) are found in
childcare products and vinyl home fur-
nishings that children come into contact
with in their daily lives. Taken together,

This Vinyl House      9

the results reveal that:

• All products tested contained

detectable levels of phthalates, with a
maximum of 39% by weight in a straw
from a child’s drinking cup. Indeed,
some of the highest levels were found
in products specifically designed for
children’s mouths.

• Seven out of 20 products contained

DEHP above a 3% voluntary cap set for
pacifiers and teethers. Some of these
products, although not intended for
children’s mouths, are very likely to be
chewed by children.

• Two teethers contained over 20% by

weight DINP.

• BBP is found in home furnishings at

concentrations up to 1.7% by weight.
A 1% limit on BBP in plastic that con-
tacts food is currently in effect in the
U.S.

• Vinyl products for everyday children’s
use containing hazardous levels of
phthalates can be readily purchased at
popular retail stores throughout the
United States.

In 1999, the European Union approved
an emergency ban on the use of six
phthalates in toys made for children
under the age of three. (Official Journal
of European Communities 1999) That
emergency ban was recently extended for
the fifth time. (European Commission
2001) In the United States however, a
voluntary limit of 3% DEHP is the only
recommendation on phthalate use in
pacifiers and teethers. This inadequate
regulation does not stop the use of high
levels of phthalates besides DEHP in

10     This Vinyl House

teethers, as illustrated by the over 20%
DINP content that we found in teethers
tested in this study.

Clothing for children, such as these sandals
and winter hat tested by Greenpeace, is often
made of vinyl.

The home furnishings we tested had an
overall lower phthalate content than the
children’s products, although a carpet
protector did contain phthalates up to
24.7% by weight. This result should not
be taken to suggest that products for the
home do not act as significant sources of
chemical exposure to children. Because
wallpaper and floor tiles are not designed
to be as soft and flexible as chewable
toys, they do not require as large
amounts of phthalates. However, they

have other requirements that products
such as teethers do not, namely consider-
able stability against heat and decomposi-
tion. For these reasons, they would be
expected to contain high levels of metal
stabilizers, and the results of this study
confirm that to be the case.

Although the chemical additive bisphenol
A was not a focus of this study, it was
also detected in two of the 20 items we
tested. Bisphenol A is used in glue pro-
duction, and can be found in a wide vari-
ety of products ranging from car parts to
drinking bottles. (WWF 2000) It is also
used in PVC production and processing,
and similar to phthalates, bisphenol A is
known to leach from plastic and other
materials and subsequently contaminate
humans. (ADA 1998, WWF 2000)
Leaching of bisphenol A from dental
sealants at 5 ppb (parts per billion)
prompted the American Dental
Association to contact the manufacturer
of the sealant to change its manufacturing
process. (ADA 1998) In this study,
bisphenol A was detected at 139,000 ppb
in a Safety 1st Deluxe RollerShade sun-
screen carblind from Toys R Us, and at
142,000 ppb in a changing pad made by
The First Years bought at Target. This is
of concern since bisphenol A affects the
hormone system, and causes toxic effects
such as reduced sperm production and
increased prostate, kidney and liver
weights in some animals. (U.S. National
Toxicology Program 2000, WWF 2000)

(See Table, page 17)

illness in humans. (Epidemiologic Notes
and Reports 1991) In addition, organotins
were found in the dusts from parliament
buildings in Europe, a clear demonstra-
tion that organotins are found in our
daily environment. (Santillo 2001) This
study confirmed the presence of organ-
otins in vinyl floor tiles and wallpaper.
Earlier work by Greenpeace also found
significant quantities of organotins in
vinyl flooring in addition to carpets.
(Allsopp 2001, Allsopp 2000) A possible
route by which they make their way into
the air we breathe is through off-gassing
from PVC building materials and other
organotin-containing textiles.

Discussion

In this report, we have demonstrated that
widely used PVC products, including chil-
dren’s items, wallpaper and floor cover-
ings, contain high levels of hazardous
additives. These additives, namely phtha-
late plasticizers and metal stabilizers, are
needed to soften PVC and to keep it from
degrading. (Bizarri 1996, DiGangi 1997)
Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), diisnonyl
phthalate (DINP) and butyl benzyl phtha-
late (BBP), were detected in the products
tested in this study at combined levels up
to 39% by weight of the product. The
metal stabilizers lead and cadmium were
also found in some of the products, but
organotins were present in all but one of
the items, often at high concentrations.
Concerns surrounding the use of phtha-
late and organotin additives in commonly
used PVC products are discussed below.

Metal stabilizers detected in all but
one product tested

All 20 PVC items in this study were tested
for lead and cadmium stabilizers, whereas
just 15 were tested for organotins. Five
items were eliminated from the organotin
tests based upon the high cost of the pro-
cedure and the fact that a similar item
was being tested. The results of the metal
tests are shown in Table 1 (page 17).
They reveal that:

• Fourteen out of 15 products contained

detectable amounts of organotins. Floor
tiles, on which children spend a lot of
time crawling and playing, and wallpa-
per were the two products containing
the highest levels.

• Two of the products tested contained
cadmium in amounts exceeding the
California Proposition 65 regulated
level.

• Eleven of the products tested contained
lead above the detection limit, although
none at levels exceeding the regulated
limit for vinyl. (DiGangi 1997)

Current limits of organotins in air set by
OSHA do not exceed 20 ppb (parts per
billion). (U.S. ASTDR 1992) Our results
show that a wallpaper sample contained
776,508 ppb total organotins. It is alarm-
ing that a product containing that amount
of organotins is readily available given
the lack of information about organotins
being released from PVC products by off-
gassing and normal wear and tear.
In 1988, the Washington State Department
of Health issued an advisory against the
use of tributyltin (TBT) in interior paint
since it released into the air and caused

12     This Vinyl House

Humans are contaminated with
phthalates

A recent study conducted by the CDC
confirmed that we have phthalates in our
bodies. (U.S. CDC 2001) Levels of the
metabolites, or breakdown products, of
seven phthalates were found in the urine
of at least 1,020 people ages six and
above. With respect to the phthalates
detected in our work, the CDC study
confirmed the presence of DEHP and
BBP metabolites in human urine.
Conversely, DINP metabolites were not
found in that study. This may simply
reflect, however, the difficulty in identify-
ing DINP breakdown products since
DINP is a complex mixture of as many as
100 isomers, or chemical variants.

The observation that the metabolites of
BBP and diethyl-, and dibutyl phthalate
(DEP and DBP) were detected in urine
at a higher concentration than DEHP
metabolites does not necessarily mean
that human contamination by DEHP is
lower than that of BBP, DBP or DEP.
Alternatively, the results may reflect dif-
ferences in the efficiency with which dif-
ferent phthalates are metabolized. In a
study comparing the metabolism of the
same amount of DEHP and DBP, 80% of
DBP was metabolized versus only 20% of
DEHP under the same conditions. (Kluwe
1982) However the results are interpret-
ed, they clearly show that humans are
contaminated with DEHP, BBP, DBP and
DEP.

Routes of human intake of phthalates

As discussed earlier, children may take in
particularly high levels of phthalates from
teethers and other childcare items made
of highly phthalate-softened PVC. In this
study, a Prince Lionheart crib rail teether
purchased at Babies R Us, and a hand-
held General Mills Cheerios teether from
the Burlington Coat Factory containing
20.8% and 21.7% DEHP by weight,
respectively serve as good examples.
Other items in this study that could very
likely be chewed by youngsters include a
child’s hat and a Liz Claiborne handbag.
These products are made up of over 20%
DEHP.

Children may also intake more phthalates
than adults through breathing. An initial
study conducted in Norway reported a
higher incidence of bronchial obstruction
in children living in houses with PVC, as
opposed to wooden, floors. (Allsopp
2000, Jaakola 1999) Phthalates being
released into the air could provide a pos-
sible link between these two observations
since phthalates are known to leach from
PVC into the surrounding air. (Cadogan
1993, Rossi 2000) Off-gassing of DEHP
from vinyl flooring can result in exposure
levels that exceed the highest estimates of
our daily intake by almost three times.
(Rossi 2000) In this study, a Tenex carpet
protector was determined to be 24.7% by
weight DEHP, indicating that we can be
exposed to phthalates in our homes and
offices through everyday activity. This is
of more concern with respect to children
since they spend a lot of time indoors
with a breathing range closer to the floor
than adults. In addition, children may

1993) That is to say, DEHP may reason-
ably be considered a cancer causing sub-
stance in humans. A retrospective study
conducted in Sweden found an increase
in testicular cancer in workers who were
exposed to PVC (Ohlson 2000), although
additional studies are needed to deter-
mine whether phthalates are responsible.

Small children chew on everything. It is
part of their learning process!

ingest phthalates by coming into contact
with home furnishings since they are very
likely to crawl on PVC flooring, for exam-
ple, and then put their fingers into their
mouths.

Toxic effects associated with
phthalates

The offspring of rats fed the three phtha-
lates detected in the products
Greenpeace tested here, namely DEHP,
DINP and BBP do not follow normal pat-
terns of sexual development. (Gray 2000)
In the case of DEHP-fed and BBP-fed
rats, the weight of the offspring was also
reduced. Other studies also report subtle
effects of DEHP in the testes of young
rats at levels below the accepted no-
observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL).
(Gray 2000) Recently, the National
Toxicology Program (NTP) expressed
concern over the adverse development of
babies born to pregnant women who
take in DEHP at the exposure levels esti-
mated for an adult. (U.S. National
Toxicology Program 2001) They also
expressed concern that male infants and
toddlers who substantially exceed adult
DEHP exposure estimates could suffer
problems in their reproductive system
development.

Rats and mice fed DEHP and DINP also
showed an increase in liver cancers over
animals that had not been fed DEHP.
(U.S. ASTDR 1993, U.S. CPSC 1998c)
Furthermore, DEHP has been classified as
a "probable human carcinogen" by the
EPA. The Department of Health and
Human Services has also classified DEHP
as a potential carcinogen. (U.S. ASTDR

from plastic containers and wraps into
food we subsequently eat.

Ingestion of organotin-tainted foods and
drink, and inhalation of organotin-laden
dust are the main ways that humans
become contaminated with these metal
stabilizers. (U.S. ASTDR 1992) Tests of
drinking water found organotins in water
from PVC pipes, but not in water from
polyethylene pipes. (Sadiki 1999, Sadiki
1996) This finding demonstrates that
organotins leach from PVC, and points
out a source of our exposure. Organotins
are also used as stabilizers in PVC plastics
used to protect food. (Kawamura 2000)
Similar to the phthalate plasticizers, it is
conceivable that they make their way

Although not from a PVC source, yet
another way organotins make their way
into our diets is through leaching from
paint on marine vessels and building up
in the fat of fish that we eat. (Boyer 1989,
Champ 2000, Jacobson 2000, U.S. EPA
2001)

A recent study found organotins in dusts
collected from parliament buildings in
Europe. (Santillo 2001) This finding pro-
vides us with clear evidence that organ-
otins have made their way into our envi-
ronment, perhaps from organotin-contain-
ing textiles, and also a better understand-
ing of where we might be exposed.

This Prince Lionheart crib rail teether contained over
20% phthalates.

Concerns about organotin stabilizers

Organotins, especially tributyltin (TBT),
are most widely recognized for their use
as anti-foulants in the paint on marine
vessels. (Champ 2000, Jacobson 2000)
Fouling is the growth of marine life
including bacteria, fungus, barnacles and
algae on boats. While organotins are very
effective as anti-fouling agents, they
cause adverse effects on the environment
by leaching from ships into the water
where they can remain for several
months. Organotins also concentrate in
sediments where they have a half-life of
over 20 months. (Jacobson 2000, U.S. EPA
2001) Concentrations of TBT as low as 1
parts per trillion (ppt), or
0.0000000001%, have been associated
with reduced reproduction in snails (U.S.
EPA 2001), and TBT at 7 ppt causes mal-
formations in oysters (Jacobson 2000).
Organotins also cause rats and mice to
have problems with reproduction and the
birth of normal offspring. (Kergosian
1998, U.S. ASTDR 1992) In humans, ship-
yard workers exposed to TBT-containing
paint developed symptoms such as
breathing problems, chronic skin inflam-
mation, dizziness and a weakened ability
to ward off colds and flu. (Champ 2000)

Recommendations

In this study, we have shown the pres-
ence of hazardous phthalate plasticizers
and organotin stabilizers in common PVC
consumer products. Earlier Greenpeace
investigations of phthalates (Stringer
2000) and cadmium and lead (DiGangi
1997) in toys and other children’s items
identified products that expose children

to hazardous PVC additives. In this study,
we have extended the list to include
childcare products and other materials
used for decorating around the home.

Although debate still remains surrounding
the hazards that PVC additives pose to
human health, we advocate using precau-
tion in assessing chemicals for their use
in commerce especially where safe alter-
natives that do not require additives exist.
Unequivocal scientific proof that a given
chemical causes a particular effect should
not be necessary to start the regulatory
process to remove hazardous chemicals
from consumer products in order to
avoid long-term or irreversible harm.

Inadequate regulations on only some
PVC plasticizers and stabilizers have led
to the use other hazardous substitutes.
Policy loopholes that allow ‘guilty’ chemi-
cals to be replaced with untested or
insufficiently tested ones are unaccept-
able. This is particularly true in the case
of phthalate plasticizers and organotin
stabilizers since PVC accounts for the
bulk of their use in industry, and since it
requires more hazardous additives than
any other plastic.

Hazardous additives are only part of the
threat that we face from using common
PVC products. The bulk of PVC waste is
not recycled, but ends up in landfills and
incinerators. PVC in landfills is of great
concern because its hazardous additives
leach from the plastic and cannot be
contained. (Van der Naald 1998)
Furthermore, the burning of PVC in acci-
dental landfill fires adds to the global
burden of dioxin, a potent toxin and can-

16     This Vinyl House

cer-causing substance. (Costner 2000)
Dioxin formation is also the main cause
of concern around burning PVC in incin-
erators.

In order to stop the needless exposure of
people, especially children, to the haz-
ards of PVC, Greenpeace recommends
that:

• The Consumer Product Safety

Commission (CPSC) should regulate
vinyl as a material. It should further
prohibit the use of phthalates, lead,
cadmium, organotins and other toxic or
untested additives in consumer prod-
ucts. If necessary, the CPSC should
seek new legislation in Congress to
give them the authority to do this.

• Manufacturers of products designed for
children or the home should disclose
all of the chemical ingredients in their
products.

• Manufacturers should commit to imme-
diately eliminating soft vinyl from their
products and establish a rigorous
schedule for the elimination of hard
vinyl.

• Retailers and distributors should

remove vinyl products from the market.

• Parents should not purchase vinyl

products to which children might be
exposed such as toys, childcare items,
clothing, school supplies, handbags,
sports equipment or items for the
home. Vinyl products should be
returned to the manufacturer or retailer
for a full refund.

PVC in Your Home

Consumers should beware of PVC products available for the home. Here’s a list of the
most common products on the market today. Go to the Greenpeace website for a virtual
house that will show you how to find products not made from PVC. We also offer an
online searchable database of alternatives for PVC used in construction. Over 200 compa-
nies are featured on the database.

Visit the virtual home at: http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/toxics/house.htm

Search the online database for alternatives to PVC in construction:
www.greenpeace.org.au/pvc/

Some other tips to be a PVC detective include:

• Look for packaging with the #3 recycling symbol on it.  That means it is PVC and

rarely recycled.

• Often, PVC products are labeled "non-toxic vinyl," or "washable vinyl." The words

vinyl and PVC are used synonymously.

• Plastic products that are soft and flexible and have a distinct odor are often PVC. If

you are not sure, don’t buy it. When you get home, call the product manufacturer and
demand information about materials used in the product.

APPLIANCES:

Appendix IV

Alternatives to PVC

For virtually all PVC applications, safer alternatives exist, using more sustainable, tradi-
tional materials - such as paper, wood or local materials. PVC can also be replaced by a
variety of other, less environmentally damaging plastics, although most plastics pose some
risk to the environment and contribute to the global waste crisis.

Greenpeace has developed a pyramid of plastics to assist those making material selection
to avoid PVC use. The guidance focuses on the toxic characteristics of the potential alter-
native materials. It provides a qualitative ranking based on environmental and health
problems of PVC, addressing the production, additives and product emissions during use,
disposal and recycling.

It does not include raw materials and energy inputs and therefore does not address all
criteria of a life cycle analysis. It provides guidance for interim steps on the route to clean
production. Ultimately, we should ask why we are using these materials and whether or
not they are necessary.

Pyramid of Plastics
The pyramid of plastics is a ranking of plastics according to their hazardous characteris-
tics. PVC, the most problematic plastic, is at the top of the pyramid, and bio-based plas-
tics, the least polluting of the plastics, are at the pyramid’s base. It represents an ongoing
process to qualify the main plastics in the economy. More plastics can be added as neces-
sary, and qualifications may change depending upon new information on the material,
such as in production processes or the use of toxic additives.

1) Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other halogenated plastics
2) Polyurethane (PU), Polystyrene (PS), Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS),  Polycarbonate (PC)
3) Polyethylene-terephthalate (PET)
4) Polyolefins (PE, PP, etc.)
5) Bio-based plastics

28

This Vinyl House

Notes:
• Metallocene technology is a new way to widen the range of properties and applications of polyolefins. This

will in turn help replace many rigid and soft PVC applications.

• TPE’s are thermoplastic elastomers that can be made from many different mixes of different plastic

monomers/short polymer chains.  Currently most of the building blocks are polyolefins, but can also con-
tain other polymers such as polyurethane. Therefore, TPE’s can not be generally ranked in the pyramid of
plastics.

Additives
The addition of toxic additives can significantly change the environmental impacts of a
plastic. For example, chloroparaffins or brominated flame retardants in polyolefins or bio-
based plastic products with heavy metal stabilizers would significantly increase the hazard
level of the plastic, and therefore change its position on the pyramid of plastics.
Furthermore, many additives are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and can cause serious
environmental damage.

Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)
It is essential that the production of bio-based plastics does not involve the use of geneti-
cally modified organisms (GMOs) or allow the patenting of life.

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is unique in its high chlorine and additives content, which
makes it an environmental poison throughout its life cycle. Vinyl chloride is a known
human carcinogen. PVC releases dioxin and other persistent organic pollutants during its
manufacture and disposal and cannot be readily recycled due to its chlorine and additive
content. Furthermore, additives are not bound to the plastic and leach out.

Polyurethane (PU) is mainly used in insulation and soft/foamed products like carpet
underlay. It uses several hazardous intermediates and creates numerous hazardous byprod-
ucts. These include phosgene, isocyanates, toluene, diamines, and the ozone-depleting
gases methylene chloride and CFCs, as well as halogenated flame retardants and pigments.
The burning of PU releases numerous hazardous chemicals such as isocyanates, carbon
dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, PAHs and dioxins.

Polystyrene (PS) is widely used for foam insulation and also for hard applications like
cups and toys. Its production involves the use of known (benzene) and suspected human
carcinogenic substances, such as styrene and 1,3-butadiene. Styrene is also known to be
toxic to the reproductive system.  PS can be technically recycled, but recycling rates are
low, although still higher than for PVC.

Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) is used as a hard plastic in many applications like
pipes, car bumpers and toys (hard building blocks). ABS uses a number of hazardous
chemicals. These include butadiene and styrene (see above )and acrylonitrile. Acrylonitrile

This Vinyl House      29

is highly toxic and readily absorbed by humans by inhalation and directly through the skin.
Both the liquid and its vapor are highly toxic. Acrylonitrile is classified as a probable
human carcinogen as are styrene and butadiene.

Polycarbonate (PC) is used for products like CDs and refillable milk bottles and is
usually made with the highly toxic phosgene, which is derived from chlorine gas. PC does
not need additives but does need solvents for its production, such as methylene chloride, a
carcinogen. Other solvents used may include chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethylene, tetra-
chloroethane and chlorobenzene. A number of processes have been developed to reclaim
polycarbonate from compact discs and PC milk and water bottles, for downcycling into
lower quality products such as crates or building applications, or for mixing in small quan-
tities with virgin material for higher grade products such as bottles.

Polyethylene-Terephthalate (PET) is made from ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephtha-
late. PET is generally used in packaging (e.g. bottles) and often contains additives such as
UV stabilizers and flame retardants. PET recycling rates are high compared to other plas-
tics.

Polyolefins such as Polyethylene (PE) and Polypropylene (PP) are simpler polymer
structures that do not need plasticizers, although they do use additives such as UV and
heat stabilizers, antioxidants and in some applications, flame retardants. The polyolefins
pose fewer risks and have the highest potential for mechanical recycling. Both PE and PP
are versatile and cheap, and can be designed to replace almost all PVC applications. PE
can be made either hard, or very flexible, without the use of plasticizers. PP is easy to
mold and can also be used in a wide range of applications.

In comparison with PVC, PE and PP contain fewer problematic additives, have reduced
leaching potential in landfills, reduced potential for dioxin formation during burning
(provided that brominated/chlorinated flame retardants are not used), and reduced
technical problems and costs during recycling.

Bio-based Polymers Biodegradable plastics from renewable sources (bio-based) are seen
as a promising alternative for plastic products which have a short life cycle or are impracti-
cal to recycle, such as food packaging, agricultural plastics and other disposables.  Bio-
based plastics can be made out of products obtained from raw materials produced by natu-
ral living or growing systems, such as starch and cellulose. The advantage of bio-polymers
is that they readily degrade and can be composted. Natural polymers include cellulose
(from wood, cotton), horn (hardened protein) and raw rubber. Converted natural polymers
include vulcanized rubber, vulcanized fiber, celluloid and casein protein.

Materials and Methods

Tests for Phthalates
The PVC products described in Table 1 were sent to STAT Analysis (AIHA proficient,
NIST/NVLAP accredited) in Chicago, Illinois to be tested for the following phthalates:
diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP),
diethyl phthalate (DEP), and diisononyl phthalate (DINP).  The items were also tested for
bisphenol A.  All the samples were prepared and analyzed essentially according to EPA
Methods 3550M and 8270M, respectively, as previously described. (DiGangi 1999)

Measurements of Metal Stabilizers
The levels of cadmium and lead contained in the PVC products studied here were also
determined at STAT Analysis in Chicago according to a procedure as detailed before.
(DiGangi 1997)  Organotin analysis was conducted at GALAB laboratories in Geestacht,
Germany by accredited methods after DIN EN 17025 to monitor the following organotins:
mono-, di-, tri- and tetrabutyltin, mono- and di-octyltin, tricyclohexyltin and triphenyltin.
