introduction

i GE RICE CAN’T BE CONTAINED

Proponents of genetic engineering argue that
“co-existence” of genetically engineered (GE,
sometimes called genetic modified, GM or
transgenic) and non-GE rice is possible. They
argue that countries, and even neighbouring
farmers, will be able to produce and keep
separate GE rice, non-GE (conventional), and
organic rice for export and/or domestic
consumption. However, there is strong evidence
that co-existence for rice is not possible – GE
contamination will occur.

Cultivated rice has many wild and weedy relatives with which GE rice can,
and will, cross pollinate. The main cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa,
cross pollinates (outcrosses) and produces viable offspring with close wild
relatives, notably O. rufipogon (Lu et al. 2003). O. rufipogon is thought to
be the ancestor of cultivated rice and is an endangered species in China
(Gao 2004). However, it is also regarded as a weed in rice cultivation. In
addition, weedy strains of O. sativa such as “red rice” occur where O.
sativa is cultivated. This includes southern Europe and the USA where it is
an important agricultural weed (NAPPO 2003; Messeguer et al. 2004).
These wild and weedy relatives grow in close proximity to cultivated rice.
Hence, there is a large overlap between the areas of cultivated rice and the
wild and/or weedy relatives of rice in many parts of Asia and other rice
growing areas (Lu et al. 2003).

Cultivation of GE rice will cause these wild and weedy relatives to become
contaminated with the GE transgenes (the GE DNA insert). Numerous
studies now provide a substantial amount of scientific evidence for
cultivated rice outcrossing to non-GE rice (e.g., Langevin et al. 1990; Lu
et al. 2003; Gealy et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2004; Messeguer et al. 2004;
Song et al. 2002, 2003, 2004; and NAPPO 2003). Cultivated varieties of
rice have been shown to outcross with both wild rice species (O. rufipogon
and O. nivara) and weedy rice (mostly O. sativa, or red rice).

Cultivated rice pollen has been recorded at a distance of over 100 metres
(Song et al. 2004) from the source plants and gene flow (outcrossing) has
been observed at a distance of 43 metres (Song et al. 2003). However, a
separation distance of only 10 meters is required between GE and non-GE
rice fields in the USA, which is wholly inadequate to prevent GE
contamination. Song et al. (2004) suggest an isolation distance of 100 m
between GE and non-GE rice or close wild relatives and suggest that sugar
cane may be planted as a buffer to reduce GE pollen dispersal. But, it is
unclear how practical or effective these measures would be in areas where
there are many small-scale producers, where neighbouring rice fields can
be much closer than 100 m. In any case, isolation distances will not
prevent GE contamination as there are many other routes for
contamination to occur (see “Other routes of GE contamination” below).

RICE AT RISK:
WILL THERE BE A CHOICE WITH GE RICE?

Outcrossing rates of rice are lower than those of maize or canola (oilseed
rape), but they are still significant. Measured outcrossing rates vary from
0.04 % (Messeguer et al. 2004) between cultivated rice and 0.005-0.01
% for cultivated rice to weedy rice and 1.2-2.2 % to wild rice (Chen et
al. 2004). However, the persistence of weedy rice varieties means that
these unwanted populations will become reservoirs for the escaped genes
from GE rice. Rice seed has varied dormancy, but weedy rice has a
stronger seed dormancy than cultivated rice (Gu et al. 2003), increasing
the potential for weedy rice populations to persist as reservoirs of GE
transgenes that could contaminate future non-GE rice crops. As
Messeguer et al. (2004) state: “Although the gene flow values are
relatively low, the shattering and dormancy of the red rice seeds,
which ensure their persistence in the field, lead into an undesirable
effect of durability of the transferred genes.”

Rice outcrossing already causes problems in rice cultivation. Red rice is a
problem weed in many rice-growing regions of the world, contributing to
extensive yield losses in some areas. Because of the problems that already
exist with red rice, the prospect of herbicide-tolerant red rice is a stated
fear for the rice-growing agricultural community (Danley-Greiner 2001).
There are concerns that if red rice becomes tolerant to the herbicide used
in conjunction with a GE herbicide-tolerant rice, it will become more
difficult to control, and of course, will make the herbicide-tolerant variety
useless for farmers (Gealy et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2004).

We can conclude with certainty that gene flow from GE rice to non-GE
rice, wild and weedy relatives will occur. The GE contaminated populations
of wild and weedy species of rice are likely to be persistent, becoming
reservoirs of GE transgenes for further contamination.

ii TRADITIONAL VARIETIES OF RICE THREATENED BY GE
CONTAMINATION

Traditional varieties of rice in Asia could become contaminated with GE
transgenes if GE rice is grown.Transgene contamination has already been
found in local traditional varieties of maize in Mexico (Quist and Chapela
2001; CEC 2004).

GE maize imported into Mexico from the USA for food is now inadvertently
being grown in Mexico and has resulted in contamination of local traditional
varieties through outcrossing. Farmers in Mexico traditionally save seed from
one harvest to the next; sowing and seed exchange between farmers is
common.This is in contrast to the hybrid system where seed is bought each
year from a seed merchant.The GE contamination in the traditional maize
varieties will be highly difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate. It will persist
in these local traditional varieties and can spread by seed exchange or cross-
pollination.The tradition of locally bred varieties and seed exchange is very
similar for rice in parts of Asia.Therefore, just as traditional varieties of
maize have been contaminated in Mexico, traditional varieties of rice could
become contaminated with GE in Asia.

GE contamination of locally bred traditional varieties is a cultural violation.
GE contamination could have adverse effects on biodiversity (for example, if
the GE contamination is from an insecticidal GE rice, such as Bt rice).
Importantly, it will remove farmers’ choice to grow non-GE rice by producing
widespread GE contamination.

iii OTHER ROUTES OF GE CONTAMINATION

Cross-pollination (outcrossing) of rice in the field is an important route of
contamination but it is not the only way that non-GE varieties of rice
could become contaminated. The potential for contamination unfortunately
exists at many points along both the production and distribution chains.

For example:

* Human error. GE and non-GE rice may become mixed when seed and
plants are transferred, for example during sowing; transplanting;
harvesting; moving seed or labelling or storing seed and grain. In seed
plots there can be planting errors.

* Ineffective segregation. The infrastructure requirements for segregation

of GE and non-GE rice are very high, much greater than the
infrastructure currently available in many parts of the world. This lack
of segregation capacity can lead to contamination of food supplies and
seed stocks.

* Trucks transporting GE rice can be the source of GE grains that fall on
fields or roadsides during transport and loading. This means that even if
GE rice is not cultivated but only imported, contamination of non-GE
rice and its wild and weedy relatives could still occur.

* Many small farmers do not own farm machinery and hire someone with
a machine to do seeding or harvesting for them. The machinery may
operate on several farms during a day or week. GE seed or a GE rice
crop could contaminate a non-GE rice farm if the machinery is not
specially cleaned in between farms.

* Farmers often sell their rice through middlemen who gather rice from
several farms together in one truck for transportation to processing
plants (mills). If the truck mixes a single crop of GE rice into a non-GE
consignment, it will become contaminated. Similarly, a non-GE rice
consignment may be contaminated if the truck was previously used for a
GE consignment and not carefully cleaned.

* In many parts of Asia, farmers will grow multiple crops of rice,

sometimes as many as three and a half crops in a year. It means they
continue to grow rice without a break. Rice seeds that fall in the field
during harvesting can germinate during the next cropping cycle. If the
first crop is GE, but not the next, there is potential for contamination in
the second crop.

GE rice cannot be contained – there are so many routes that can cause
GE contamination of non-GE rice. These routes can spread GE rice
contamination over long distances and will affect all types of non-GE rice,
including hybrid rice. Even if there were rigorous controls placed on the
distribution, planting and transport of GE rice, GE contamination would
still occur because of human error. GE rice contamination would be highly
difficult to eradicate and would probably increase because of the
persistence of populations of wild and weedy relatives, which would also
become GE contaminated.

iv PHARMACEUTICAL GE RICE – A SPECIAL THREAT

Some crop plants, including rice, have been genetically engineered to
produce pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals (GE “pharm” crops).
Box 1 shows some of the wide variety of compounds that are currently
being engineered into rice plants. These pharm crops are not intended to be
eaten by humans and animals, but to be used by drug companies or in
industrial processes. The compounds produced by these plants are often
biologically active chemicals and all are potentially toxic to animals and
humans. The genetic engineering industry insists that they can produce
these compounds by genetically engineering crops such as maize and rice
and keep them out of the human and animal food supply. However, many
people, including scientists, doubt that these pharm crops can be kept out
of animal and human food supplies and are concerned about the possible
consequences (see, for example Anon 2004).

Pharm rice could pose a special threat to farmers saving their seed.
Ellstrand (2003) considers a hypothetical example of a pharm crop
genetically engineered to produce a non-edible, commercial, biochemical
compound. The GE transgene producing the chemical is passed to wild or
weedy relatives of the crop, which then act as a reservoir for the escaped
transgene. This “reservoir” can then return the GE transgene back to the
crop at a different place and time, resulting in GE pharm contamination.
This becomes especially problematic if farmers follow the tradition of
saving seed from one harvest for planting for the next. The frequency of the
GE transgene could increase year-to-year as the seed is saved. Eventually,
the concentration of the commercial biochemical compound could reach
toxic levels in the harvested seed and have an impact on human health. As
Ellstrand (2003) states, the scenario is very unlikely, but none of the steps
are unrealistic. Therefore, if GE pharm rice ever became mixed with, or
contaminated, local varieties of rice where seed is saved, it has the
potential to have serious impacts on human health.

conclusion - co-existence is not possible

Proponents of GE argue that “co-existence” of GE and non-GE rice is
possible. Lessons from Mexico show that GE contamination cannot be
prevented. There are several routes that can lead to the contamination of
non-GE rice, and preventing contamination all along the production and
distribution chain is impractical and impossible. This contamination will
threaten traditional varieties and remove farmers’ choice. Rice must be
protected and kept GE-free.

“Contamination of human foods with plant-made pharmaceuticals
can occur through dispersal of seed or pollen. Wildlife, especially
waterfowl, can transport seed for long distances, as can extreme
weather events such as floods or tornadoes. Harvesting equipment
can carry seed residues to conventional fields, seeds can be spilled
from trucks, or unharvested seeds can sprout as volunteers amid the
following year’s crop. Cross-pollination occurs at considerable
distances in high winds or by insect, even with self-pollinating crops
such as rice.” (Freese et al. 2004).

Moreover, widespread contamination of the non-GE (conventional) crop
seed supply in the US increases doubts that GE pharm crops can be
contained. As Freese et al. (2004) conclude:

“When certified and even breeder seeds, whose cultivation is subject
to extraordinary gene confinement measures, become contaminated,
it becomes impossible to believe in 100% containment of pharm
genes, no matter how stringent the gene confinement measures that
are applied (including geographic isolation).”
