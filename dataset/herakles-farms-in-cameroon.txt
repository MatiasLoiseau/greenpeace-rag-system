Executive Summary
Herakles Farms —  
setting a bad example
The palm oil project being developed by the US-owned 
company Herakles Farms in Cameroon demonstrates 
the threat posed by badly managed expansion of oil 
palm plantations. The project covers 73,086 hectares (180,599 acres)
3 of forest and existing farmland and 
is home to an estimated 14,000 people,4 mostly small 
farmers. Residents are fiercely opposing the plantation, 
fearing it will deprive them of their farmland and access 
to forest products. International and Cameroonian NGOs and scientists are also critical of the project
5 on 
the grounds of illegality6, social and economic injustice 
and environmental destruction.
Cameroon lies within the Congo Basin, home to the 
second largest rainforest in the world, and this project threatens to become a dangerous model for deforesta -
tion driven by palm oil across the entire area. Situated in the Southwest Region , the plantation would cover most of the land linking five protected areas including 
Korup National Park. This region is part of the Guinean 
forests of West Africa, identified by Conservation International as a “biodiversity hotspot” —one of the 
world’s top 25 critical areas for biodiversity conserva -
tion.

Maps covering the Herakles Farms project area, 
compiled by Greenpeace, show it includes 62,433 
hectares (154,209 acres) of dense natural forest,8 
constituting 89% of the proposed concession.
Illegal forest destruction
In 2010, Herakles began illegally clearing forest9 
to establish oil palm nurseries, in the absence of a presidential decree authorizing the concession, which 
is required by law.
10 Herakles has also violated a court 
decision, made in the town of Mundemba, to suspend 
all activity of its plantation following a complaint filed 
by local people. Furthermore, the company was found guilty of illegal logging; forestry officials issued a report 
detailing these activities in April 2012.land gra BBing in africa r EprESEntS a SE riou S dang Er to th E liv Elihood S of S mall

Executive Summary
When residents protested against the plantation 
in June 2012 they were met with intimidation and 
arrests.11 In August 2012, Nasako Besingi, the director 
of Cameroonian NGO SEFE (Struggle to Economize Future Environment), was physically assaulted by 
people associated with Herakles, while he visited the area with French journalists.
12
In November 2012, while preparing a peaceful demonstration, Besingi and other members of SEFE 
were arrested at the organization’s headquarters, and 
held without charge.
13 They were released following 
international criticism, including an appeal from the 
World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) and the 
International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).14
Herakles has commissioned reports attempting to cover up the negative impacts of the project. Its 
environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) 
is inadequate. It acknowledges the project will have “major” impacts on livelihood
15 but makes no 
provision for mitigation. Residents report that they 
were not consulted, and complain of verbal promises 
that have not been fulfilled and that farmland was demarcated without consent.
16 The assessment of 
the High Conservation Value (HCV) forests in the 
project area claimed that only small patches should 
be preserved,17yet an independent review of the data 
concluded that the report indicates that “most of the 
area should be dense lowland rainforest and therefore 
of high conservation value.”18Failing international standards 
and deterring customers
Herakles Farms say they are committed to “meeting 
or exceeding” Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 
(RSPO) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) 
standards.19 However, Herakles Farms withdrew its 
RSPO membership in August20 2012 after official 
complaints by NGOs accused it of not complying 
with standards.21 The project would also fail IFC 
Performance Standards on a number of criteria, including breach of national law.
22 Major multinational 
buyers of palm oil such as Nestlé, Unilever, WalMart and McDonalds —the companies Herakles sees as 
potential customers
23—are adopting policies that, 
from 2015, they will only buy RSPO-certified palm oil, 
meaning Herakles’ disregard for environmental and 
social issues is likely to exclude the company from one of its target markets.
The wrong project in the wrong place
Herakles Farms is imposing its plantation without the free, prior and informed consent of the communities 
that will be directly affected and in the face of op -
position from the people who will be most impacted. 
The project would remove land and resources that 
are critical to the livelihoods of local communities 
and would disastrously impact biodiversity as well as produce millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions.
Following such as model would send Africa’s forests 
down the path seen in Indonesia and Malaysia where oil palm plantations have caused millions of hectares 
of deforestation.
24 African countries and investors are 
at a crossroads. They can choose an alternative way by promoting small-scale agricultural investments. 
They can also prioritize investment in projects that not only respect people’s rights and livelihoods but also 
preserve the forest’s biodiversity and carbon stocks.

Introduction: 
The great African land grab
Since 2000, foreign investors in agriculture have report -
edly bought or leased over 56 million hectares of Africa: 
an area almost the size of Kenya.25 Some are govern -
ments, particularly from the Middle East and China, while others are corporations, including plantation companies 
and speculators that view land as a good investment in a time of rising crop prices.
26
A recent analysis of land grabs found that “Reported land deals in Africa concern an area equivalent to 4.8% 
of Africa’s total agricultural area.”
27 This represents a 
serious threat to the livelihoods of small farmers and to food sovereignty in the often very poor countries where 
control of large areas of fertile land is being handed to foreign interests. Reports suggest the majority of land 
acquired by foreign investors will not be used to meet 
local needs or improve food security
28 but to grow crops 
for export—both food and biofuel feedstock.29
Land grabs also threaten Africa’s forests, which contain rare habitats and huge quantities of stored carbon. 
Unabated land grabbing for commercial agriculture 
represents a massive new threat to biodiversity and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. In the Congo 
Basin, logging companies already control some 44 
million hectares of forest
30, while another several 
hundred thousand hectares are threatened by new palm 
oil ventures.
Palm oil is a major driver of new land acquisitions. 
The oil palm is native to west and central Africa and is widely cultivated in the region, but currently most oil 
palm production comes from Malaysia and Indonesia.
31 
Rapidly increasing demand for palm oil for food use and biofuels
32 is leading to a new wave of industrial-scale 
planting in Africa. Research conducted by Greenpeace International in 2012 found that 27 palm oil projects were 
reported in Central and West Africa covering around 2.6 million hectares of forest.
33 Many of these are in the early 
stages of development. This huge area is likely to be 
cleared if the plantations are not stopped.Herakles Farms—  
setting a bad example
The US-owned Herakles Farms’ palm oil project in the 
Southwest Region of Cameroon exemplifies the threat 
posed by ill-conceived expansion of oil palm plantations. 
It covers 73,086 hectares (180,599 acres)34—an area 
more than ten times the size of Manhattan. Herakles 
Farms, through its subsidiary SG Sustainable Oils Cam -
eroon (SGSOC), plans to plant around 60,000 hectares 
(148,200 acres) of oil palms.35 The Cameroonian Minister 
of the Economy signed the establishment convention 
for the project in 2009 and the plantation is currently at 
the early planting stage. The project as a whole presents major social, environmental and legal issues.
The allocated land is home to at least 14,000 people, 
according to the company,
36 and lies on or near the 
borders of five protected areas, including Korup National 
Park. This is “an ecologically vital area—one of the 
largest surviving tracts of lowland forest in the Gulf of Guinea”, according to a group of leading scientists.
37 A 
2012 study by Greenpeace International shows that the 
forest in the project area contains a high carbon stock, 
meaning the project threatens to produce millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions when the forest is cleared 
to make way for oil palm trees.
The area includes 62,433 hectares (154,209 acres) of 
dense natural forest
38 as well as farmland and agrofor -
estry smallholdings. There is extensive local opposition 
to the project, which residents fear will deprive them 
of their land and access to forest products: like many farmers in Africa, most lack formal title to their land. A 
Greenpeace team documented that the setting up of 
one of the project’s nurseries at Fabe deprived people of access to a valuable collecting area for forest products,
39 
and that cocoa farms have been taken without farmers’ 
consent.40 Locals were not properly consulted before the 
establishment convention was signed. The convention gives Herakles Farms the exclusive right to farm in the 
area
41 and includes no provisions for compensation of 
residents. The company claims “a huge outpouring of 
support from communities”, and says its project will not 
displace people,42 yet simultaneously communities have 
consistently objected to the plans by complaining to the 
government, signing petitions and organizing peaceful 
demonstrations.


 7
Cameroonian and international NGOs and scientists 
have also opposed the project43 citing illegality, a 
lack of respect for people’s rights, damage to local 
livelihoods and environmental destruction. Two local 
NGOs, the Centre for Environment and Development (CED) and Réseau de lutte contre la faim (Relufa) have 
laid out how the establishment convention violates 
both national and international law.
44 They have also 
shown that, although the agreement gives the com -
pany “exclusive use” of the land,45 the area includes 
zones that had already been officially designated for 
a mining exploration permit, a logging concession 
(yet to be awarded), and two small-scale logging permits.
46 Such overlap in intended land usage could 
cause legal conflicts between Herakles Farms and 
other future permit holders. More importantly, they 
illustrate the confusion and damage unplanned land allocation is causing. Greenpeace supports the call 
from CED and Relufa for a moratorium on the granting 
of new concessions until Cameroon sets up compre -
hensive land-use planning and clarifies the processes 
for land allocation.

Residents
SGSOC’s Environmental and Social Impact Assessment states that the 
project area is home to more than 14,000 people. 50 Greenpeace France 
and the Cameroonian NGO the Citizens’ Association for the Defense 
of Collective Interests (ACDIC) have conducted research into farming 
systems in the districts covering the Herakles Farms project area. Most of the inhabitants are small farmers, growing cassava, palm oil, bananas 
and other crops for subsistence and to supply local markets. Some 
areas produce cocoa as a cash crop.
51 Palm oil is mostly processed on 
an artisanal basis to supply unrefined (red)  oil for local sale.52 Gathering 
forest products such as bush mango (Irvingia gabonensis) , monkey 
cola (Cola lepidota)  and bush pepper is also important, particularly for 
women: forest products provide around 30% of women’s cash income in the region.
53 Herakles’ promise of plantation jobs may be of little help to 
local farmers: the researchers estimate that an average cocoa grower in 
the area currently earns around twice as much a year as an agricultural 
laborer at the Cameroonian company Pamol’s nearby oil palm plantation in Ndian.
54 Farmers face an array of problems, ranging from a lack of 
formal land rights to exploitation by cocoa traders. Losing farmland and 
forest to the Herakles’ plantation would only exacerbate these difficulties.

A biodiversity hotspot
The plantation would cover the majority of the land 
linking five protected areas: Korup National Park, Bakossi 
National Park, Mbanyang Mbo Wildlife Sanctuary, Nta 
Ali Forest Reserve and Rumpi Hills Forest Reserve. This area is part of the Guinean forests of West Africa, 
identified by Conservation International as a “biodiversity 
hotspot”—one of the world’s top 25 critical areas for biodiversity conservation.
55
The protected areas are home to many threatened species, including the Drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus) , 
Preuss’s red colobus (Procolobus preussi) , the Nigerian 
subspecies of the chimpanzee (Pan trogolodytes ellioti)  
as well as rare amphibians, birds and plants. Plans 
belonging to the management teams for Korup National 
Park and Nta Ali Reserve have indicated that larger animals, such as elephants, chimpanzees and the 
endangered Drill, use the forests in the Herakles project 
area to forage and move among the different protected areas.
56 The forests perform a vital function in linking 
populations of large threatened mammals. Aerial survey 
shows that the forest cover within the project area is 
very similar to that in neighboring Korup National Park, indicating the biodiversity value of the habitat.
The global climate
Greenpeace International carried out detailed satellite mapping and an aerial survey of the Herakles Farms proj -
ect area in November 2012 and found the area contains 62,433 hectares of dense natural forest
57 —constituting 
89% of the area surveyed.58 If it were cleared for planta -
tion, most of the forest‘s carbon would be released—a 
massive yet totally avoidable addition to climate change.

Herakles Farms’ illegal 
forest destruction
Herakles Farms began clearing land for its plantation 
in 2010, despite overwhelming evidence of the forest’s 
global, regional and local importance.59 The project 
has from the beginning, been conducted in violation of national law
60. At the time of writing, the company 
has not received a presidential decree authorizing the concession, which is required under Cameroonian law.
61 
In 2010, Herakles began creating nurseries for oil palms, without authorization for forest conversion and before 
being issued a “Certificate of Environmental Conformity” by the Ministry of Environment, Nature Protection 
and Sustainable Development. In April 2012, ministry 
investigators confirmed illegal felling of trees and land clearance at the Talangaye site. They seized equip -
ment and issued SGSOC with a summons to which
62 
Herakles Farms has reportedly failed to respond.63 A 
month later, a visit by ministry officials and Cameroon’s 
EU-financed Independent Forest Observer’ confirmed 
illegal acts had taken place.64 In early November, a flight 
over the area, organized by Greenpeace International, 
documented ongoing clearing.Residents of the villages of Toko and Fabe organized 
a protest against the plantation during a visit of the 
regional governor in June 2012: they were met with 
intimidation and arrests.65 In November 2012 activists 
from Cameroonian environmental group Struggle to 
Economize our Future Environment (SEFE), who have 
been organizing non-violent protest against Herakles Farms, were arrested and held for several days, 
without charges
66—part of a pattern of harassment 
against the organization.
In September 2012, Herakles CEO Bruce Wrobel 
published an open letter denying illegality in relation to the project. The letter was issued in response to a 
report by the Oakland Institute in collaboration with 
Greenpeace International.
67 The letter repeats Her -
akles’ claim that the project will create “tremendous 
economic, social and environmental benefits”.68 Wrobel 
claims that the forests in the project area have been “logged and farmed repeatedly” and are of little value, 
yet on the same page claims that Herakles will harvest timber so the government can sell it for “many millions 
of dollars.”

Herakles Farms’ illegal forest destruction
Wrobel has set up a charitable organization, All For 
Africa, which, amongst other activities, claims to 
tackle poverty by establishing palm oil plantations. The 
organization’s Palm Out Poverty initiative is subsidizing up to 1 million oil palm trees. However, All For Africa 
has taken money donated to it for charitable purposes 
to start and manage oil palm nurseries in Cameroon. Although the nurseries have AFA’s name on them, they 
are being used to pave the way for the commercial 
development of the Herakles’ plantation.
Herakles Farms has been unable to produce evidence 
of any proper authorization permitting either clearing 
or planting, despite several demands to do so by Greenpeace, and despite their own claims their 
activities are legal. They have been equally unable to 
demonstrate the alleged low value of the forest after their HCV assessment was called inadequate by the 
HCV Resource Network (a group dedicated to the 
improvement of the HCV concept).

Herakles Farms’ illegal forest destruction
How Herakles Farms ignores High 
Conservation Value Forest
Herakles Farms has carried out an environmental and 
social impact assessment (ESIA) of the project, as re -
quired by Cameroonian law. The government accepted the report despite criticism from scientists and NGOs. The methods used in the ESIA environmental surveys 
were inadequate: plant and animal surveys lasted only 
22 days during the rainy season, when it is difficult to detect animals; and the surveys covered less than 
0.003% of the project area,
71 with many locations 
close to roads or settlements and hence less likely to find rare species.
72 Although the ESIA refers to carbon 
emissions, it makes no attempt to assess the actual carbon stock of the land to be cleared or to quantify 
potential greenhouse gas emissions, merely noting that “The planting of oil palm trees and cover crops 
over most of the area cleared will offset the clearing of 
biomass, but the total biomass will not be restored.”
73
The ESIA also misrepresents the social impact of the project. It claims the “vast majority” of local people 
“had a favorable opinion of” the Herakles project.
74 
Although acknowledging the project will have “major” impacts on livelihoods,
75 it makes no provision for a 
mitigation plan, recognizing only that “losses of some traditional livelihood opportunities, particularly those 
related to Non-Timber Forest Products and hunting” are to be expected.
76 By contrast, filming in the area by 
the Oakland Institute with the support of the organiza -
tion SAVE-Wildlife demonstrates there was a lack of consultation with little benefit to locals.
77 Residents 
of Fabe village report that they were not consulted 
and have made no written agreements with Herakles 
Farms; they complain that promises made verbally have not been fulfilled. They point to a water pump 
installed by the company as an example; situated next 
to a large billboard advertising the company, they say it has not worked in 13 months.
78 In Ekita, villagers 
accuse Herakles of demarcating areas without the 
consent of farmers while they were absent and 
without their consent, marking farmland to be part of the plantation.
79
Herakles also commissioned an assessment of the High Conservation Value (HCV) forests in the area, 
required for meeting Roundtable on Sustainable 
Palm Oil standards. The HCV Resource Network peer-reviewed the assessment report and found that 
it was “not rigorous enough for a project of this scale 
and intensity…not adequate to comply with RSPO principles”.

Herakles shows only small isolated patches of forest, surrounded by massive blocks of plantation, and sites 
listed in a table are mostly less than 25 hectares, or on steep slopes unsuitable for oil palm cultivation.

Herakles Farms’ illegal forest destruction
Failing international standards
Herakles Farms claims it is “committed to meeting or exceeding RSPO Principles & Criteria, as well as the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards”.84 The company is failing to meet these commitments.
The stated aim of RSPO is to promote the use of sustainable oil palm products that adhere to a set of global standards. 
In reality these standards are still too weak to be able to call RSPO-certified palm oil “sustainable.” Furthermore they do 
not prevent deforestation and peat land clearance85, Herakles Farms does not meet even these imperfect standards. 
Herakles’ subsidiary SGSOC was an RSPO member but left in August 201286 after official complaints filed by NGOs 
accused it of not complying with RSPO’s standards.87 Herakles claims it withdrew its membership because “the... 
grievance process is preventing the company from moving forward during a critical and time-sensitive period, in which 
we must move our first planting of seedlings from the nursery to the field”.88 The company’s real commitment to the 
RSPO Principles and Criteria can be judged by its decision to withdraw as soon as its failings were exposed and before the complaints were resolved. Meeting these standards was a major plank of Herakles’ public relations strategy,
89 so the 
withdrawal indicates failure on the company’s own terms.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards applicable to palm oil plantations are weak and 
full of loopholes. For example, they use language suggesting companies should “minimize”, “mitigate” or make “efforts to avoid” negative impacts on sensitive ecosystems and local communities.
90 However, it is clear that Herakles Farms’ 
project would fail even these standards, in particular because the project is in breach of national law.91 The project 
also breaches more specific standards, such as by not limiting or even quantifying its greenhouse gas emissions (PS3, 
paragraphs 7-8) and by confiscating land with no provision for compensation92 (PS5 paragraphs 25-29). The IFC has 
told Greenpeace that since it has no investment in Herakles Farms, it has no duty to assess whether Herakles meets its standards.
93 In the absence of a credible independent assessment, Herakles’ claims can be treated as pure PR.

Herakles Farms’ illegal forest destruction
Sourced through habitat destruction, through land 
grabbing from local people and through emitting 
millions of tons of carbon, Herakles Farms palm oil 
will fail ethical and ecological standards.
Delilah Rothenberg, the Herakles Farms project 
manager, told the Cameroon Professional Society 
in 2011 that, although the African market is the primary target, her company hopes to sell to 
major multinational buyers of palm oil: “Nestlé, 
Unilever, WalMart, McDonalds…We expect them to be our customers.”
94 But in reality these 
companies could not buy Herakles’ palm oil from 
Cameroon. All four, along with many other large 
consumers of palm oil, have adopted policies committing to only buying RSPO-certified palm 
oil from 2015 forward: a certification whose 
standards Herakles has failed to meet. Nestlé goes even further with its “Responsible Sourcing 
Guidelines”, which require suppliers to “protect 
high carbon stock forest”.
95 A 2010 commitment 
by the international business group the Consumer 
Goods Forum, to which WalMart, Unilever, and 
Nestlé belong, aims for zero net deforestation by 2020,
96 suggesting many companies are moving 
towards tighter criteria than those stipulated by 
RSPO standards.Nestlé: “By 2013, we are

The Wrong Project In The Wrong Place
Herakles Farms is imposing its version of development without consent in the face of opposition from the people who will 
be most affected. Instead of adhering to its own commitment to meet RSPO and IFC standards, Herakles is breaching 
Cameroonian law, denying the project’s impact on biodiversity and ignoring the significant amount of greenhouse gas 
emissions it would cause.
The plantation would take almost all of the land currently used by communities, undermining local food sovereignty as 
people are forced into wage labor at a time of rising global food prices. Muyali Boya Meboka, the division member of 
parliament, for Ndian, has suggested Herakles wants to “buy off” local communities with token development.101
Internationally, while the market for “sustainable” palm oil is expanding rapidly and large buyers are beginning to tighten their standards on deforestation, Herakles Farms is pursuing an outdated model of environmentally damaging and 
ethically unacceptable production.
Both via its practices and its withdrawal from RSPO, Herakles has admitted that it fails to meet “international standards”. 
Any customers of or investors in this kind of project would be at risk of association with legal, social and environmental 
scandals.
Following the Herakles Farms model would send Africa’s forests down the disastrous path seen in South-East Asia, 
where unchecked expansion of industrial agriculture, including palm oil, has caused millions of hectares of deforestation.

Cameroon and other African countries should establish a moratorium on new large-scale land lease agreements for agro-industrial projects until clear safeguards are established. These safeguards would protect the rights of land 
users as well as natural forests and other high-value ecosystems. Participatory land use planning should be used to 
reconcile economic, social and environmental factors and reduce the risk of conflicting land use

Area of natural beauty within the concession area 
leased by Herakles Farms in the coastal rainforest of Cameroon. Despite lacking a Presidential Decree granting the concession, as required by Cameroonian law. The concession area is in a biodiversity hotspot, home to endangered species including forest elephants and chimpanzees, and it provides a crucial migration corridor for these animals between five protected areas. Local people, who depend on the forest to provide food, medicine and building materials, have protested against the project and have faced intimidation and arrest as a result.

The Sakbayeme river within the coastal rainforest 
of Cameroon. This forest, at the fringe of the Congo Basin, is a biodiversity hotspot, home to endangered species including chimpanzees and forest elephants. It also provides hunting and fishing grounds, building materials, fuel wood and medicine for local communities. The forest, and the people and animals who depend on it, are being threatened by a proposed palm oil plantation that would flatten an area eight times the size of Manhattan. The corporation behind the proposed project, US-based Herakles Farms, is pressing ahead with forest clearance, despite widespread local opposition.
