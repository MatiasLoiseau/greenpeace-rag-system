E xecutive summary 
paper protection for the Amaz o n
Almost ten years ago, world leaders g a t h e r ed in Rio de Janeiro, Br a z il. The meeting, known as the Earth
S u m m i t , became one of the defining moments of the fight to reverse the worldwide trend of envir o n m e n t a l
d e g radation. T o ge t h e r , more than 180 countries r e c o g n i z ed the harm being infl i c ted on our fr a g ile earth
and vowed to put the world on a more sustainable path. Central to this was the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD). This leg a lly binding agreement was intended to provide a comprehensive framework f o r
the pr o tection of the world’s thr e a tened natural habitats, including ancient f o rests and the l i fe that
depends upon them.
A decade lat e r, the world’s ancient f o rests are still waiting for governments to keep their Earth Summit
p ro m i s e . To d a y , some 80% of the world’s f o rests have been degraded or destroyed. The Amaz o n
ra i n fo r est is no exception. Last year def o restation of the Br a z ilian Amazon was gr e a ter than at any time
since 1995.2Fu e lled by high international market demand, mahogany ( Sw i e tenia macrophyl l a) is driving
the destruction of the r a i n fo r ests of the Br a z ilian Amaz o n .
The vast majority of Br a z il ’s mahogany is exported. Luxury products from Br a z ilian mahogany are sold in
some of the most prestigious r e t a il outlets in the world’s wealthiest countries. But the glamourous image
hides a corrupt industry that is undermining tr a ditional cultur e s, and leading the il l e gal destruction of the
w o r l d ’ s most precious ancient f o re s t , critical to the survival in the wild of cr e a t u r es such as the jaguar. 
O f ten re fe r r ed to as ‘green gold’, mahogany can f e tch over US$1, 6 0 0/m3. Ill e gal mahogany opens the door
for il l e gal logging of other species, and for widespread exploitation of the Br a z ilian Amazon. The Br a z ili a n
G o v e r n m e n t ’ s assessment of the problem is that 80% of all Amazon timber originates from il l e gal sour c e s.
At the core of il l e gal logging is widespread corruption.
D e s p i t e many years of campaigning by NGOs such as Gr e e n p e a c e , the plethora of domestic and
i n ternational agr e e m e n t s , action pr o g rammes and laws pledging to pr o tect the Amazon or control the
m a h o g any trade have proved hopelessly inadequate. Over the last decade, numerous int e r n a t i o n a l
a g reements have been signed to pr o tect species such as mahogany and the remaining intact ancient
fo rests in which mahogany occurs. These include the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Gr o u p
of Eight (G8) Nations’ Action Programme on F o r e s t s and the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES). These agreements are not working.
Recent Greenpeace investigations in the Br a z ilian state of P a rá reveal just how
deeply r o o ted the problem r e m a i n s . No r e liable legal chain of custody exists
for mahog a n y. Ill e ga l ity is widespread. The key players are ruthless. 
This report sets out the evidence and names many of the key actors involved
in the supply and trade of il l e gal mahogany from Br a z il. Osmar Alves F e r re i r a
and Moisés Car v a lho P e re i r a are two kingpins in the state of P a rá, which
s u p p l ies the vast majority of Br a z il ’s mahogany tr a d e. Ill e gal mahogany is
l a u n d e r ed through fraudulent use of official documents. By the time it is
shipped from the Amazon, the mahogany appears legal and its il l e gal origins
a re untr a c e a b l e . 
Fe r re i r a and Moisés are connected to at least five export companies –
E x p o r t a d o r a Pe ra c c h i / S e r r aria Cotia , Tapajos Timber , S e m a s a , M a d e i re i r a
M C P and J u a ry/ J a to b a – that t o gether control around 80% of exports fr o m
the state of P a rá. On the importing side, just four companies in the North –
A ljoma Lumber , DLH Nord i s k, J Gibson McIlvain Co Ltd a n d
I n te r continental Har d w o o d s – account for over 80% of the tr a d e.

However unwittingly, manuf a c t u r ers and r e t a ilers in North America, Eur o p e
and Japan are aiding and abetting high level crime. This goes for high- c l a s s
re t a il outlets in the USA carrying lines from F u r n i t u r e Brands Int e r n a t i o n a l ,
L i feStyle Furnishings International, Stickley and Ethan Allen; Harrods and
John Lewis Partnership in the UK; International Design Centres in Japan; and
others are all involved in the scandal. Whatever these companies may claim,
t h e re is no way of knowing whether the mahogany they sell is legal – and the
odds are that it is not.
The trade in il l e gal mahogany is just the tip of the iceberg. It signals the
fa il u re of world governments to act to pr o tect the Amazon – just one of the
w o r l d ’ s last remaining ancient f o re s t s .
The 2002 Ancient F o rest Summit3
At the April 2002 Ancient F o rest Summit at The Hague in The Netherlands, world governments will meet to
decide a t e n -year plan for the ancient f o re s t s . The outcome of this meeting will determine the f a te of the
w o r l d ’ s remaining ancient f o rests and the plants, animals and people they support. Whether g o v e r n m e n t s
act to stamp out the il l e gal and destructive trade in mahogany will be but one test of their ability to move
beyond rhetoric and into the realm of action.
Governments must act to s top the destruction , clean up the timber tr a d eand fund the pr o tection of
ancient f o re s t s .

The law of the land
c a r t e blanche for destruction
Logging companies bet on the incapacity of the [Brazilian] government to
c a r ry out enforcement measures; or they just change activities when caught
because timber is just another business front and considered a t e m p o r a r y
activity; the same way the forest is considered as a t e m p o r a r y stage on the
road to regional development .4
– Ibama, 1997
Most of the remaining stock of mahogany lies in indigenous reser v e s, and a
large proportion of Brazi l ’s mahogany harvest is extracted from them.
Mahogany logging has been impl i c a ted in serious social d i s r u p tion of
i n digenous communities, including assassination, alcohol and drug relat e d
p r o b l e m s , increased prostitution and the spread of d i s e a s e s . 5

M a h o g any – green gold 
M a h o ga n y , the green gold of the Amazon, is the most valuable Amazon timber. The demand for mahog a n y
is almost exclusively driven by the international mark e t.6To d a y , dealers are willing to pay up to $1, 6 0 0/m3
for this precious and increasingly r a re commod i t y. 
B ra z il ’ s ‘mahogany belt’ covers some 80 million hectares of the Br a z ilian Amazon. A region of f o rests rich
in ra re and wonderful wood species and areas of enormous ecological d i v e r s i t y , it str e tches from the south
of Pa rá to Acre, crossing the north of Mato Gr o s s o, Rondônia and southern Amaz o n a s . Unsurprisingly, this
region f a lls within the Amaz o n’s ‘def o restation belt’. 
M a h o g any pr o s p e c t ors fly hundreds of ki l o m e t r es over dense f o rest in search of scatt e red mahog a n y
t re e s , often fewer than one per hectare. To gain access to a single mahogany tr e e, loggers often bul l d oze
ill e gal access r o a d s , criss- c rossing previously untouched f o re s t . Logs are extr a c ted up to 500km from the
n e a rest sawmill. 
The high value of mahogany pays for the long pioneer
roads that cut through the Amazon to reach the infr e q u e n t
m a h o g any tr e e s. These logging roads are the first step in
to d a y ’s colonization process of f o rest clear a n c e , lead i n g
to agricultural and r a n c h i n g .7For instance, the president of
the T a il â n d ia logging industry association admits that he
sees the introduction of soya plantations to Southern P a rá
as the industry’s future once the logging is finished.8
Thousands of ki l o m e t r es of il l e gal roads have been opened
in P a rá State, the largest mahogany producing and
exporting region in Br a z il. Intensive and pr e d a to r y log g i n g
p ractices have already depleted the mahogany stocks of
the South of P a rá. Indian lands have been heavily exploit e d
in the hunt for remaining st o c k s.

Invasion of Indian lands
Who pr o f i t s ?
Although il l e gal, it is not unpr e c e d e n t ed for Ind i a n s, including some members of the Kayapó, to
a llow loggers onto Indian land in order to make some meagre earnings themselves. However,
w h ile Indians receive at best R$80 (US$3 0 )9per tr e e, the sawn timber from that tree then sells on
the export market for upwards of US$3,3 0 0.1 0This same tree supplies enough mahogany timber
to assemble between 12 and 15 twelve - s e a t er solid mahogany dining room tables, which
wholesale for US$4, 1 50 and r e t a il to the public for US$8, 5 50 each.
H e n c e , the products from one 5m3m a h o g any log have a r e t a il value of up to US$128,250 when
sold at prestigious r e t a ilers such as Harrods in the UK11– equivalent to the sale of 4275 mahog a n y
t rees in the f o re s t .
The largest remaining concentrations of mahogany are found on or around Indian lands in P a rá State.
F i f teen Indian lands cover 16, 2 4 3,000 hectares of f o re s t1 2– an area roughly the size of Nepal or W a s h i n g to n
S t a te in the USA – mostly in the south of the state.13
On paper, the Br a z ilian Constitution pr o tects Indian lands from all industrial exploitation. However, the
h u ge profit made by the individuals and companies that control the mahogany market explains the motive
for the widespread il l e gal invasion of Indian lands. By the end of 1992,1 4m a h o g any logging had ext e n d e d
o n to all 15 Indian lands and has continued since.
Lawyers at the Social-Environmental Institute1 5working on behalf of Indians say they have never seen a f a i r
and legal contract for mahogany log g i n g.1 6The standard tactic used by the loggers is to enter the Ind i a n
l a n d s , fe ll the trees and then neg o t i a te on the basis of the trees that have been cut down.1 7
W h e r e contracts have been neg o t i a ted with Ind i a n s, it has
o f ten led them into debt bondage to the sawmil l s. As
M e ga r on, a Kayapó chief, explains: ‘The Kayapó… are
fo rced to pay with more mahog a n y. Indians cannot l i v e
f rom wind.’1 8
Many violent conflicts resulting from the il l e gal industry
have been r e p o r t ed on Indian lands. Indians have been
fo rced to take d i rect action to halt the il l e gal invasion of
their lands by logg e r s. Tra g i c a ll y , this has sometimes
ended in violence. An unknown number of Indians have
been mur d e red because of their opposition to the
i n d u s t r y.1 9E n ding the il l e gal logging on their land r e q u i re s
sustained efforts to find alternatives that provide the
I n dians with income from the f o re s t , without destroying it. 
P a r t n e r s  i n  m a h o g a n y  c r i m e
One five metre mahogany log supplies enough timber to make up to 15 of these
tables – a total ret a il value of US$128,250

The Middle Land 
The Indian lands in P a rá surround the ‘ Terra do Meio’ or Middle Land, a region of F e d e ral public land about
the size of Austria (8.3 million hectares). One of the largest relatively undisturbed areas of r a i n fo r est in the
e a s tern Amazon, the Middle Land is situated on the northern edge of the mahogany belt, between the
Xingu and Tapajós rivers. The region is of critical importance to wi l dli fe and Indian people. It shelt e r s
n u m e r ous species including jaguars, giant all i ga to r s , spider monkeys and ant e a te r s , all of which are
c u r rently under threat of extinction in the wild. 
Recently loggers and miners have crossed the Xingu river
h e a d ing west, invading public lands within the Midd l e
Land. Even José Altino Machado, the famous leader of the
A m a z on g a r i m p e i r os (gold pr o s p e c to r s ) ,2 0is amazed by
the speed of the invasion. In an int e rview published in
August 2001,21 Machado said that since 1995 loggers and
farmers had opened 600km of roads between São F é lix do
Xingu, an important logging town at the edge of the
M i d d le Land, and Itaituba. 
A c c o r ding to José Altino, another 400km of roads are
c u r rently opening up the r e g i o n .2 2Recent Gr e e n p e a c e
field investigations show that one of these roads is being
opened by Osmar F e r re i r a, one of the key players in
B ra z il ’ s ill e gal mahogany tr a d e, to transport logs to the
s a w m i ll he is bui l ding in the town of Uruará, along the
Tra n s a m a z onian Highway.2 3

A problematic sect o r
The forest industry in Brazil is not a sector with problems,
but a problematic sect o r.2 4
– Ibama, 1997
What logging companies present to Ibama as being
‘management plans’ are just f a ke papers that ‘legal i ze’
activities that are never monitored or controlled by the
federal agency. These ‘management plans’ are just
bureaucratic requirements for the release of mahogany
export l i c e n s e s . 25

Fraudulent ATPFs – covering the tracks of the illegal logg e r s
In Br a z il, there is widespread fraudulent use of official documentation at the initial stages of the
supply chain.26 This renders subsequent national and international measures to control the il l e ga l
t rade in timber such as mahogany almost meaningless. 
The Br a z ilian government issues ATPF (Authorization for the Transport of F o rest Pr o d u c t s )
documents in an attempt to control the timber tr a d e. In theory, ATPFs should prevent the
t ransport of logs that are not legal in origin. In pr a c t i c e , an industry r e p resentative has not e d ,
ATPFs can easily be purchased for around US$1/m3of timber.27– creating a blank cheque for il l e ga l
l o gging activities. Mor e o v e r , ATPFs are frequently reused many times to launder r e p e a t ed ill e ga l
s a l e s .
Once il l e gal mahogany has reached the sawmill using fraudulent A T P F s, it is ‘leg a li zed’. Ibama, the
B ra z i lian f e d e ral environment ag e n c y, acknowledges that many sawmills present documentation
in perfect or d e r, fraudulently declaring il l e ga ll y- s o u r ced timber as originating from an appr o v e d
FM P.28
One common practice is for companies to over e s t i m a t e the volume of timber in a given area of
fo rest in the FMP they present to Ibama. Often, Ibama does not inspect the f o rest bef o re the
p roject is approved. The over e s t i m a t e gains a company spare ATPF papers, which can be used to
launder il l e gal timber from outside the FMP area. F e d e ral Pr o s e c u t or Ubiratan Cazetta not e s:
‘Many F o rest Management Plans are the object of fraud. The d i f fe rence between the volume of
m a h o g any r e a lly existing (in the f o rest) and what is specified in the FMPs serves as the starting
point that supports the ‘leg a li z a t i o n ’ of mahogany coming from Indian R e s e rv e s .29
T h e re have been several initiatives by official Br a z ilian agencies to clamp down on the il l e gal mahog a n y
t ra d e . In 1996, f o llowing the release of sat e lli te images exposing the extent of def o restation in the Amaz o n ,
and a strong campaign led by Greenpeace and other NGOs, the Br a z ilian government put in place a two-
year mor a torium on any new F o rest Management Plans (FMPs) for mahog a n y. This stopped the expansion
of the mahogany mark e t. The mor a torium on new FMPs has been extended and will remain in place until
June 2002. 
In 1999, f o llowing an evaluation of 65 r e g i s te r ed mahogany FMPs in P a rá State, the Br a z ilian g o v e r n m e n t
suspended 39 FMPs and cancelled 13 F M P s. Reasons included lack of g e o g raphical co- o rdi n a tes for the
FM P, inaccur a te maps and overestimation of the volume of mahogany in the f o re s t .30The r e s p e c te d
B ra z i lian r e s e a r ch institute EMBRAPA noted that FMPs ‘only exist to satisfy a legal demand’3 1– i.e. they
exist on paper to supply the industry with the official ATPF documents necessary to launder il l e ga l
m a h o g any into the legal mark e t. 
P a r t n e r s  i n  m a h o g a n y  c r i m e
I llegal mahogany is laundered through the fraudulent use of official documents

A c c o r ding to r e c o rds held by Ibama in P a rá State, only 13 FMPs for mahogany extraction r e m a i n
re g i s te re d .32 A ll of these FMPs are inside or around the Middle Land. The owners of eight of these F M P s
have been impl i c a ted in il l e gal log g i n g. Official Authorization for the Transport of F o rest Products (A T P F )
documents relating to these FMPs have been used fraudulently to cover the tracks of the il l e gal tra d e.
In 1998, the Br a z ilian Government l i s ted mahogany under Appendix III of CITES in an effort to help it
re g u l a t e the international tr a d e. Bra z il also fixed quotas for mahogany exports, which are det e r m i n e d
yearly and have been pr o g ressively reduced. For 2001, the quota is l i m i ted to 20, 0 0 0 m3in the first half and
1 0,0 0 0 m3in the second half. CITES Appendix III does not certify the leg a lity of mahogany at point of origin,
nor does it deal with domestic trade or processed products such as plywood and other finished pr o d u c t s .33
These measures have been a first step in the right d i rection, but the government has still f a iled to ful l y
c o n t r ol the activities of those players remaining in the industry t o d a y . A shortage of money and equipment
p revents Ibama, the government body in charge of contr o lling f o rest exploitation and the timber industry,
f rom monitoring the origin of the timber that enters the mark e t. Hence, only a tiny fraction of il l e ga l
m a h o g any exploited on Indian lands is picked up. For instance, O Lib e r a l re p o r t ed in 1997 that ‘sawmil l s
receiving il l e gal timber are located only 100 metres from the São F e lix do Xingu Airport… The head of
Ibama states that he is aware of the exploitation, but blames the situation on the org a n i z a t i o n ’s lack of
equipment and financial r e s o u rc e s. ’34
Even when Ibama int e rvenes and proves the il l e gal origin of logs, government authorities r a rely succeed in
punishing those r e s p o n s i ble for the crime. Rate of collection of fines issued against timber companies f o r
i n f ractions is extremely low. As the then president of Ibama, Eduardo Martins, declared in 1997:
‘ P ra c t i c a l ly 100% of the fines r e l a ted to Ibama’s issuing documents of infraction against those destr o y e r s
of fauna and f l o ra are not paid.’3 5A l s o, companies are adept as using judicial appeals and other leg a l
m a n o e u v r es to retain control of il l e ga ll y- s o u r ced timber.36
The ban on new mahogany FMPs has consol i d a ted control of the trade into the hands of the f e w, and the
continued strong global demand and high market value for mahogany products cr e a tes a strong incentive
for P a rá ’s reis do mogno – the mahogany kings – to log il l e ga ll y .

The mahogany business in Br a z il is made up of a chain of
i n formal actors and middle men. It is dominated by a small
é li te group of sawmills and exporters contr o lled largely by
two powerful players: Moisés Car v a lho Pe re i r a and Osmar
Alves F e r re i r a. Between them, these two mahogany kings
a re connected to at least five export companies
( E x p o r t a d o r a Pe ra c c h i / S e r r aria Cotia, Tapajos Timber,
Semasa, Madeir e i ra MCP and Juary / J a toba), which contr o l
over 80% of the total mahogany timber export trade fr o m
Pa rá. They also have connections to at least six of the 13
remaining F M P s, pro v i ding ready access to official A T P F
documentation widely used to launder il l e gal mahogany in
the legal mark e t.
Moisés Carvalho P e re i r a 
Moisés exploits mahogany from Kayapó Indian lands. He pays them R$80/m3 [US$30] and resells it f o r
R $ 3,500 [US$1390]. Most of the timber is exported to the UK.3 8
Epoca, August 2001
Moisés is said to be the most powerful mahogany king, r e p o r t ed to make about US$1 million a day during
the logging season. Money gained from this trade is laundered into other enterprises – Moisés is also a
rancher and his fortune from mahogany has been used to finance a car dealership, a hotel and a r e g i o n a l
television station and a long list of other businesses.39 Most of them are in the logging town of R e d e n ç ã o , in
the South of P a rá. 
A c c o r ding to sources within the Br a z ilian government and documents cited at Ibama in Br a s ilia, Moisés is
li n ked with several companies involved in the il l e gal chain of supply of mahogany to the export mark e t.
These include Madeir e i ra Juary / J a toba (sawmill and exporter), 2M (sawmill), Madeir e i ra MCP (sawmill and
e x p o r t er), Millennium (sawmill), Madeir e ra Prizina (one FMP), Madeir e i ra Rio Pr e to (sawmill), Ouro V e rd e
( s a w m i ll), Rio Negro (sawmill) and Serraria Mar a j o a r a/Semasa (three F M P s, sawmill and export e r ) .
In August 1998, ‘ Operação Mogno ’, an investigation on the Kayapó Indian R e s e rve in P a rá by Ibama and
the F e d e ral Po li c e , confirmed the involvement of the company Juary in il l e gal mahogany logging on Ind i a n
l a n d s . The investigation showed that Moisés’ original application for the FMP near São F e lix do Xingu
( J u a r y I farm) was based on false inventories of the volume of mahog a n y. The official documents were
being used to launder mahogany il l e ga l ly extr a c ted from Kayapó lands.40/41
O p e r ação Mogno also r e s u l t ed in a similar charge against the company 2M for having il l e ga ll y
o v e re s t i m a t ed by 16, 1 56 m3the volume of mahogany existing in two F M P s.
In 2000, Moisés closed Juary, only to open another company, Jat o b a .4 2Neither Juary nor Jatoba official l y
c o n t r ols any of the mahogany FMPs r e g i s te r ed to d a y . Last year, Juary / J a toba sold mahogany through the
Danish-based trader DLH Nordisk to the USA, the UK, The Netherlands and Germany. Juary also sold to
A ljoma Lumber in the USA – the largest single mahogany importer in 2000.4 3
P a r tn e r s  i n  m a h o g a n y  c r i m e
In August 2001, Epoca – Brazi l ’s second largest weekly news magazine – l i n ke d
then president of the Brazilian Senate, Jader Barbal h o, with illegal mahogany
trade through Moisés

Semasa is another company l i n ked to Moisés and is the largest single holder of currently r e g i s te re d
m a h o g any F M P s, contr o lling thr e e. Semasa sells mainly to the USA via DLH Nordisk and through UK
i m p o r t er Allan Thomas Cr a i g. In 1994-95, Semasa traded in excess of the authorized volume for its
( u n i n v e n t oried) F M P s. That authorized volume was itself based on a company estimate for the density of
m a h o g any that was three times the regional aver a ge. Ibama has also cancelled one of Semasa’s F M P s
because it was a fiction – existing on paper only. 4 4
Moisés – front man for Senator Barbalho?
E p o c a , Bra z il ’s second largest weekly news mag a z i n e , recently al l e ged that Moisés is just the ‘ te s ta -d e -
fe r r o’ – the front man – in the mahogany trade for the former president of the Br a z ilian Senate, Jader
B a r b a lh o .4 5A c c o r ding to E p o c a : ‘Jader stands accused of association with the il l e gal trade in mahogany in
Pa rá.’ On 5 October 2001, after a long political scandal, Senator Barbalho resigned the presidency of the
S e n a t e, thereby avoiding prosecution and retaining his political rights to be a cand i d a te in the 2002
e l e c t i o n s . E p o c a n o tes that he is accused of irregularities in payments for the repatriation of land fr o m
l a r ge landowners. On the basis of a review of public tr e a s u r y documents, Senator Barbalho is suspected of
having embezzled more than R$3 million (US$1.1m) from P a rá State Bank and the former F e d e ra l
Department for Regional Development.46
Osmar Alves F e r re i r a
The other kingpin in P a rá ’s mahogany trade is Osmar Alves F e r re i r a. According to sources within the
B ra z i lian government and documents cited at Ibama in Br a s ilia, companies l i n ked to F e r re i r a include
Fe r re i r a Madeiras e Desmatamentos (former producer sawmill r e g i s te r ed to F e r re i r a), Madeir e i ra Serra
D o u r ada (two FMPs), Madeir e i ra Sol Nascente / Kernvald & St e dler (sawmill), Tapajos Timber (export e r ) ,
M a d e i re i r a Castelo (sawmill) and Exportadora P e racchi (sawmill and exporter). After being bought by
Fe r re i r a, the P e racchi sawmill was renamed Serraria Cotia47and was gr a n ted an export quota by Ibama f o r
the first half of 2001.4 8
Fe r re i r a and Moisés frequently work in
c o njunction. For instance, some suppliers sell to
Fe r re i r a one year and Moisés the next. Two F M P s,
Wagner L B de Freitas and Cilla, have st o re d
m a h o g any for F e r re i r a but are part of Moisés’
n e t w o r k .49

Greenpeace investigators documenting continued illegal logging in 2001 in an
area where Greenpeace investigations the previous year had led to large - s c a l e
seizures of illegal timber by Brazilian Federal pol i c e

The assault on the mahogany of the Middle Land began in the early 1990s when Exportadora P e ra c c h i
d e c l a r ed ownership of areas along the road opened by the Canopus mining company. The road opens the
fo rest between the Xingu River and the Iriri river and further south, bordering Kayapó Indian land. 
Time and again, the mahogany kings have proven adept at manipulating the legal s y s tem and exploiting its
li m i t a t i o n s . In the mid 1990s, one group of Indians sought help from the courts to expel P e racchi, Maginco
and Impar from their lands where these companies were il l e ga l ly log g i n g. They also sought to f o rce the
l o ggers to pay the r e c o v e r y plan for the devastation caused. P e racchi made numerous appeals ag a i n s t
Fe d e ral court injunctions that pr o h ib i t ed the company access to the il l e gal logging road inside Indian lands.
Pe racchi argued that the F e d e ral court in Br a s ilia had no jurisdiction in the area and that the matter should
be decided by a local judge in São F é lix do Xingu. The local NGO, Nucleo de Dir e i tos Ind i ge n a s , acting on
behalf of the Ind i a n s, was ‘t o t a lly against such tr a n s fe r , because a local judge would be more vulnerable to
p o li t i c a l / economic pr e s s u r e’ .53 
In another case in September 1999, the F e d e ral Prosecution Office in P a rá filed charges against the
companies Serra Dourada and P e racchi with the F e d e ral Judge of Marabá. Quoting an Ibama report about
the results of Operação Mogno from 1998, the F e d e ral Pr o s e c u t or Ubiratan Cazetta stated: ‘F o ll o w i n g
confirmation that the timber [extr a c ted from Indian Lands] was tr a n s p o r t ed to sawmills in São F e lix do
Xingu, Tucumã and R e d e n ç ã o , [the authorities] carried out an assessment of the companies’ existing
m a h o g any stocks as well as in the companies’ r e c o rds of the volume traded to date.’ 
A c c o r ding to the Pr o s e c u to r , the investigation revealed a striking good order in the paper w o r k . Too perf e c t
in fa c t. The inspectors decided to investig a te the two FMPs owned by Serra Dourada. ‘The field inspection
showed that the [volume of mahogany in the] FMP was over e s t i m a t ed. The volume of mahogany simply
does not exist in that ar e a . ’54With an over e s t i m a t ed st o c k, Serra Dourada was able to get from Ibama
documents covering the exploitation of an additional 21, 0 8 6 m3. These were used to launder the mahog a n y
obtained il l e ga ll y . ‘It is easy to conclude that the d i f fe rence between the volume of mahogany existing in
the plan and in the f o rest is coming from Indian Lands . ’5 5D e s p i t e these find i n g s, both FMPs – 38 3 8 /93 and
2 4 8 0 /94 – are today authorized to log mahog a n y. Pe racchi was also found to have over e s t i m a t e by
1 6,5 54 m3the mahogany in its three FMPs (077/ 9 0, 156 1 /91 and 3773/92) all r e g i s te r ed in São F e lix do

Caught in the act

investigations in the
M i d d le La n d
In July 2000, a Greenpeace investigation team inspected il l e gal logging operations in the Middle Land and
in the Indian lands surr o u n d ing it. This was the second Greenpeace expedition to the area, f o ll o w i n g
s u rveys in 1999 to document il l e gal logging in P a rá State. Greenpeace fieldwork in the São F e lix do Xingu
region found il l e gal mahogany operations on Kayapó Indian lands (see map). 
Video documentation of the findings was del i v e red to environmental authorities a few days lat e r, to ge t h e r
with a call for immed i a te action. Gr e e n p e a c e , Ibama and the F e d e ral Po lice initially estimated the volume
of ill e gal mahogany at 6000m3. When Ibama and the F e d e ral Po lice flew over the area in early Sept e m b e r
2 0 0 0 , they estimated that 20, 0 0 0 m3of mahogany was lying in log- y a rds on Kayapó land or being tugged on
the Xingu river.
For two whole months after receiving incontr o v e r t i ble evidence of large-scale il l e gal log g i n g, the
government f a iled to act. A F e d e ral Po lice agent told Greenpeace that the loggers had been informed and
w e re removing the timber from the Indian lands. Not until late September 2000 did the F e d e ra l
government task f o rce start Operação Xingu. It was not until November that they got results – seizing
timber at the r e g i o n ’s sawmills worth roughly R$6 million (US$3m).
Two companies l i n ked with Moisés were involved. Madeir e i ra Pirizina was found with 26 4 2 m3of mahog a n y
logs and was later fined R$7 9 2,594 (US$4 0 0,000). Madeir e i ra Rio Pr e to was found with 2332m3o f
m a h o g any logs and was fined R$1.2 million (US$600,000) for possession of il l e gal timber. 
Two companies l i n ked with F e r re i r a were also involved. Serra Dourada was apprehended with about
2 8 0 0 m3of timber. P e racchi was found with 1712m3of mahogany logs and 123m3 of sawn timber – r e c e i v i n g
a total fine of over R$800,000 (US$4 1 0,000) 
In total, Ibama apprehended over 16, 0 0 0 m3of ill e gal timber from Kayapó land at seven sawmills in S ã o
Fé lix do Xingu, which included 7 9 2 4 m3of mahogany logs and 123m3of sawn mahog a n y. 
But in January 2001, three of the companies – Serra Dourada, Pirizina and Ouro V e rde – received a
p rovisional decision from a local judge allowing them to trade the il l e gal mahog a n y. As il l e gal logging is
c o v e r ed under the F e d e ral Environmental Crimes Law, the issue is outside of the jurisdiction of a local
j u d ge. The judge was later suspended on suspicion of corruption. The investigation showed that all the
documents r e l a ted to Operação Xingu had d i s a p p e a r ed from the judge’s office in São F é lix do Xingu.

e q u i p m e n t , Greenpeace documented logging roads and airstrips on the Ar a w e t ê, Apit e rewa and K a y a p ó
I n dian lands, as well as in the Middle Land itself. 
The most significant finding was located at the position S 07o26'802" W 052o41'169" – the same position
w h e r e Greenpeace documented evidence in 2000 that led to the f e d e ral go v e r n m e n t ’ s Operação Xingu.
H e re in 2001, Greenpeace documented a large log- y a rd on the Kayapó land, on the left bank of the Xingu
R i v e r . It was full of trucks, cars, bul l d ozers and hundreds of logs. A large road heads west from the log- y a rd
i n to the Kayap Menkragnoti f o re s t . At the log- y a rd, also used as the port, boats wait to take the logs to
s a w m i ll s. An aerial survey of the log- y a rd exposed large log - rafts of mahogany heading down river t o w a r d
São F é lix do Xingu. Greenpeace also found a smaller log- y a rd at the edge of the Kayapó land, on the right
bank of the Xingu, north of the Kayapó and Gor o t i re land. A logging road leads into the f o re s t .
G reenpeace has del i v e red a copy of the video and phot o g raphs to the F e d e ral Prosecution office

C I T E S
E x p o r te r s , tra d e r s , manuf a c t u re r s , re t a ilers and end consumers of mahogany participate in the process of
devastation of the Amazon driven by profit on the one hand and ‘pr e s t i g e’ on the other. The glamour o u s

both destructive and corrupt.

ancient f o rest until r e p resentative pr o te c t ed area networks and areas of sustainable use are ful l y
e s t a b li s h e d .
•C re a t e a global ancient f o rest fund of at least US$15bn annually to fund implementation of these
m e a s u re s .
Action on mahog a n y
E s t a b l ish immed i a te MORAT O R I A
•Place an immed i a te mor a torium on all industrial logging in the Middle Land until a full assessment of the
ecological values of this area has been completed and a cr e dible land-use plan developed and
i m p l e m e n t ed. 
•Place a mor a torium on the Br a z ilian mahogany trade until the measures below are fully implement e d .
Implement immed i a te MEASURES
•C a r ry out a full inspection of existing F M P s, with the participation not only of governmental bodies but
also independent scientific experts and r e p resentatives from NGOs.
•Permanently r e v o k e the FMPs of all companies found laundering il l e gal mahogany logs or other species.
•C o m p l e t e a comprehensive invent o ry of remaining mahogany stocks bef o re approving new FMPs f o r
m a h o ga n y .
•U p g r ade Br a z ilian mahogany from CITES Appendix III listing to Appendix II so that world g o v e r n m e n t s
can more closely r e g u l a t e the tr a d e. 
•Adopt F o rest St e w a r dship Council (FSC) independent certification as the only int e r n a t i o n a ll y
acceptable standard for ensuring that the timber trade is both legal and ecologically and social l y
re s p o n s ib l e .
A ll o c a t e MONEY
•P rovide adequate funding and r e s o u r ces to Ibama, Br a z il ’s environment ag e n c y, in order to establ i s h
e f fective monitoring and enf o rcement of existing Br a z ilian laws. 
•P rovide adequate funding to ensure that Indian groups currently involved in the il l e gal mahogany tr a d e

33In many ways, CITES Appendix III is an ineffective mechanism for

counterproductively, it legitimizes the trade in the market place by the 
ostensible regulation through chain of custody documentation.34O Liberal (01 February 1997) ‘Indios ajudam no contrabando do mogno ’

80Timbmet and International Timber (part of Saint Gobain) are two of the 
main UK traders of mahogany. Both belong to the WWF95+ Group of 
companies, which has the strongest commitment to buy from legal and 
well-managed sources to standards of the Forestry Stewardship Counci l
(FSC). However, these companies continue to buy mahogany, primarily 
from DLH which sourced for the UK market between February 2000 and 
May 2001 from Exportadora Peracchi, Tapajos Timber, Jatoba and MCP .
