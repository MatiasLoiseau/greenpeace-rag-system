Key Findings

1.Coal  ash production has grown by 2.5  times  in the eight  years  since 2002, when China began  to rapidly

expand its installed capacity of coal-fired plants. Coal ash is now the country’s single largest source of solid

industrial waste.

2.In 2009, China produced in excess of 375 million tons of coal ash, equivalent to more than twice that year’s

urban waste production. The total volume came to 424 million cubic metres (m3) – enough to fill one standard

swimming pool every two and a half minutes or one Water Cube (National Aquatics Center) every day.

3.Climate change increases the risk of extreme weather events like heavy rains and floods. These events in

turn increase the risk of disasters at coal ash disposal sites, which, with their vast quantities of harmful waste,

become a grave danger to public health and the environment.

4.In this investigation, Greenpeace detected more than 20 different kinds of harmful substances (heavy metals

and chemical compounds) in samples collected from the coal ash disposal sites of 14 power plants across the

country.

5.Greenpeace  estimates  that  the  total  coal  ash  waste  produced  by  China’s  coal  power  sector  each  year

contains 358.75 tons of cadmium, 10,054.25 tons of chromium, 9,410 tons of arsenic, 4.25 tons of mercury

and 5,345.5 tons of lead. Altogether, that’s 25,000 tons of heavy metals.

6.In  samples  of  surface  water  taken  near  ash  disposal  sites,  Greenpeace  detected  pollutants  in  excess  of

concentrations  stipulated  in  the  “Environmental  Quality  Standards  for  Surface  Water”  and  “Standards  for

Irrigation Water Quality” at four out of six power stations.

7.In  samples  of  underground  well  water  taken  near  ash  disposal  sites,  Greenpeace  detected  pollutants  in

excess of concentrations stipulated in the “Sanitary Standards for Drinking Water” at three out of eight power

stations.

8.The majority of the 14 power stations investigated failed to observe site selection criteria when locating their

coal ash disposal sites. Many of the coal ash disposals had inadequate measures to prevent dust dispersal,

leakage and run-off of pollutants into the environment.

9.While it is widely believed that over 60% of coal ash is reutilized in China, in reality the rate is likely less than

half of this. This deceptive impression results from the reporting of false data by the power companies as well

as inadequate government supervision, and is one of the key reasons for the long neglect of the problems of

coal ash pollution in China.

10.China lacks effective policy to monitor coal ash once it is reutilized and recycled into other products. There

is  a  severe  lack  of  safeguards  for  public  health  in  regards  to  harmful  substances  found  in  bricks  and  other

products made from coal ash.

Preface

Some  200  years  ago,  coal  helped  to  bring  about  the  industrial  revolution  and  advance  the  development  of
modern civilization. Today, coal is still part of the backbone of world economic growth. In 2009, China – home
to one-fifth of the global population – consumed over 3 billion tons of coal, more than any other country in the
world and more than three times greater than the amount used by the second-ranked country, the U.S. Over
70% of China’s energy needs are met by coal. Over the last two decades, coal has provided a crucial energy
foundation for the country’s economic boom.

Seen  from  another  angle,  however,  China’s  staggering,  coal-powered  economic  ascent  comes  with  huge
environmental,  social  and  economic  costs.  Coal  pollution  has  already  become  the  country’s  biggest
environmental problem. Three years ago, in association with several other organizations, Greenpeace published
a report called The True Cost of Coal, which examines China’s coal use from a macroeconomic perspective.
That report showed the total external cost of coal used in 2007 alone to be RMB 1.745 trillion, equivalent to
7.1% of China’s GDP. Every ton of coal burned that year cost RMB 150 in environmental damages. This figure
does not even include the substantial costs associated with climate change, which coal combustion emissions
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases help fuel.

Building on that report, in August 2010 Greenpeace collaborated with the Chinese Centre for Disease Control
and Prevention to publish The True Cost of Coal – Air Pollution and Public Health, a new research report geared
at educating the Chinese public about the health threats of air pollution from coal combustion.

This latest report, The True Cost of Coal – An Investigation into Coal Ash in China, focuses on a long-ignored
type of coal pollution. An inevitable byproduct of coal power generation, coal ash is also China’s largest single
source of industrial solid waste. In 2009 alone, China generated at least 375 million tons of coal ash – more
than  twice  the  amount  of  urban  domestic  waste  produced  in  the  same  time  period.  Coal  ash  is  also  toxic,
containing large quantities of pollutants such as heavy metals and radioactive substances, which pose a huge
threat to both the environment and public health.

However, because of regulatory loopholes and poor policy implementation by governments and industry, coal
ash’s environmental problem has long been over-looked and underestimated. One of the key issues is that coal
ash re-utilization rates have been widely exaggerated to over 60%. The reality, however, is that the rate is likely
not even half that.

To  better  understand  the  current  state  of  coal  ash  pollution  in  China,  Greenpeace  conducted  an  onsite
investigation into 14 power plants across the country, collecting samples of coal ash for analysis and conducting
interviews with specialists, industry and government departments. We present this research with the hope that
it will help lead to improvements in China’s coal ash pollution prevention legislation, strengthen environmental
law enforcement and provide a valuable source of information. At the same time, we hope that it will encourage
more policy makers and researchers to pay more attention to this topic.

We would like to extend our special thanks to Professor Zhou Hanhua and his team at the Law Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences for providing policy analysis and legal recommendations. We would also
like to thank Mr Hao Zhibang, an Inner Mongolia environmental protection senior engineer, who offered advice
and guidance during the writing of this report. Finally, we would like to thank our volunteers Ma Zhiyao and
Zhang Zheng for meticulously and patiently checking the data in this report.

Due to limitations in time and research capability, this report definitely has room for improvement. We sincerely
welcome and value any suggestions from experts, people in the industry and other readers for improvements.

Chapter One
Coal Ash in China

Coal ash1 is the solid particulate matter produced when coal is burned in power
stations.  The  term  coal  ash  includes  both  fly  ash,  trapped  by  dust  collection
systems,  and  waste  materials  (often  called  bottom  ash)  that  collect  on  the
furnace  floor.    Fly  ash  that  is  not  captured  by  the  dust  collection  systems
escapes into the atmosphere and becomes particulate-matter air pollution.

The True Cost of Coal
–– An Investigation into Coal Ash in China (2010)

1. Current situation

(2) Air pollution

China has long been over-dependent on coal for its energy

needs.  Currently,  more  than  70%  of  China’s  energy  is

generated by burning coal, and as the economy continues

to grow at a fast rate, so too does its coal consumption.

The power sector is one of the largest consumers of coal,

with  more  than  half  of  national  coal  consumption  going

towards electricity generation.

Coal  ash  is  the  inevitable  waste  product  from  coal

combustion.  Generally  speaking,  every  four  tons  of  coal
burned  produce  one  ton  of  coal  ash2.  In  2009,  China

About 20% of coal ash particles are hollow, making them

easily  dispersible  by  wind.  Regardless  of  whether  dry

or  wet  disposal  methods  are  used,  without  a  properly

enclosed storage system, coal ash can easily be scattered

into the atmosphere as secondary dust pollution. This will

have serious consequences for people living downwind of

the coal ash impoundment. When wind speeds reaches

level four (5.5-7.9 m/s), coal ash can spread over an area
spanning 100,000  and 150,000 square  kilometre  (km2)8.

Thus,  coal  ash-induced  air  pollution  can  affect  areas  far

from their original location. The strong northwestern winds

consumed  more  than  three  billion  tons  of  coal,  more

originating from provinces such as Inner Mongolia, Shanxi

than half of which was used to generate electricity. Using

and  Xinjiang,  where  big  coal  and  power  industries  are

conservative estimates, the coal ash produced that year

reached 375 million tons. This is equivalent to more than

twice  the  urban  domestic  waste  produced  in  the  same
year3 and a volume of 424 million cubic metres4—enough

located, further intensifies the spread of coal ash pollution
towards southeastern China9.

the  coal  ash  soaks  in  the  water,  the  heavy  metals  and

There  are  two  methods  to  dispose  of  coal  ash.  It  can

be buried in an “impoundment” on land procured by the

power station either as wet ash disposal (in an ash pond)

or dry ash disposal (in a dry landfill). Or it can be recycled

(comprehensive  utilization)  into  other  materials,  such  as
concrete and other construction materials.6

2. Coal ash pollution

(1) The composition of coal ash

Coal  contains  harmful  heavy  metals  and  radioactive

substances, which are left behind after combustion in coal

ash  in  much  higher  concentrations.  The  main  chemical

components  of  coal  ash  are  silicon  dioxide,  aluminium

other  harmful  substances  can  leach  out  into  the  earth,

ultimately  seeping  into  the  groundwater.  This  can  cause

the  contamination  of  local  water  sources,  the  discharge

of  suspended  matter  into  drinking  wells,  the  fluoridation

and alkalization of water and so on. Coal ash can also be

blown by the wind into rivers and lakes.

(4) Soil pollution

As China continues to expand its fleet of coal-fired power

plants,  the  problem  of  coal  ash  disposal  is  becoming

increasingly serious. Scattered by wind across the lands,

coal ash can cause soils to turn alkaline, which damages

agricultural production and the ecology.  The spilled coal

ash can seep into nearby fields, reducing yields or even

oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, potassium oxide,

killing crops.

sodium oxide, sulfur trioxide and partially burned organic
matter7. Coal ash also contains antimony, arsenic, boron,

cadmium,  chromium,  cobalt,  copper,  lead,  manganese,

mercury,  molybdenum,  nickel,  selenium  and  vanadium,

among other heavy metals and radioactive elements such

as radium, thorium, and uranium.

(5) Human health impacts

Figure  1  shows  how  coal  ash  pollution  from  a  coal-fired

power plant can threaten human health, either by directly

entering  the  body  or  indirectly  through  contamination

of the food chain. Coal ash can pollute the environment

through  many  channels,  including  air,  water  and  soil.

The True Cost of Coal
–– An Investigation into Coal Ash in China (2010)

Even when coal ash has been recycled into tiles or other

(6) Geological hazards

building materials, it can still threaten human health.

Once  the  heavy  metals  and  other  harmful  substances

from  coal  ash  build  up  to  a  certain  concentration  in  the

body,  they  can  cause  many  serious  diseases  (see  Table

1).  The  radioactive  elements  in  coal  ash  also  pose  a

threat  to  human  health.  Present  in  naturally  occurring

coal, thorium and uranium are not changed chemically by

combustion  and  are  left  behind  as  contaminants  in  coal

ash.  Radioactive  elements  are  about  three  times  more
concentrated in coal ash than in “raw” coal10.

Most coal ash waste deposits are deeper than 20 metres,

while  the  height  of  an  ash  dam  is  usually  around  30

metres.  Heavy  rains,  floods  or  other  natural  disasters

increase  the  chance  of  accidents  such  as  ash  dam

collapse, landslides and mudslides. In the event of such

disasters,  the  heavy  metals  and  other  pollutants  in  coal

ash  can  leak  into  the  environment  and  threaten  human

health.  As  the  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events  is

increasing with climate change, it is beyond doubt that the

likelihood of coal ash disasters will only grow as well.

Example of coal ash dam disasters:

Kingston Fossil Fuel Plant, Tennessee, U.S.

On December 22, 2008, in the U.S. state of Tennessee, the retaining wall of a five-hectare ash pond collapsed,

spilling 500 million gallons (2 million cubic metres) of coal ash. The spill destroyed houses, polluted the earth,

rivers, and air, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. According to the Tennessee Valley Authority,

owner  of  the  Kingston  Fossil  Fuel  Plant,  the  ash  spill  covered  more  than  160  hectares  of  road  and  lands,
affecting an area greater than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. It took six weeks to clean up the accident12.

Cases of ash dam failures in China:

In 2009, a dam belonging to the Jiangdian Coal-fired Plant failed, causing a large surface impoundment of coal
ash to collapse (Jiangyou city, Sichuan province)13.

In 2006, a 30-metre deep ash dam failed at the Pan County Power Plant when a retaining wall near the bottom

gave away. All the coal ash contained flooded out, pouring directly into the Tuozhang River, part of the Pearl

River system. According to experts’ estimates, in the space of a few minutes about 300,000 tons of ash
slurry spilled directly into the Tuozhang River, polluting both the Tuozhang and Beipan Rivers14,15.

In 2006, an ash dam belonging to the Chenming Paper Factory failed, spilling over 110,000 cubic metres of

coal ash. The ash slurry flooded 12 hectares of farmland and flowed into the Tumenjiang River (Longjing city,
Jilin province )15.

In 2005, the collapse of a 40-metre-high ash dam at the Neijiang Power Company of the China Huadian Group

caused the death of a worker. After the collapse, the edge of the ash dam had moved forward by 30 metres
(Neijiang city, Sichuan province)16.

In 2004, an ash dam of the Nayong Power Plant failed at its lower part (Liupanshui city, Guizhou province)17.

The True Cost of Coal
–– An Investigation into Coal Ash in China (2010)

Onsite  investigations  by  Greenpeace  focused  on  three
key areas: 1) the heavy metals and chemical compounds
contained  in  the  coal  ash;  2)  the  pollutants  found  in
water sources close to the coal ash disposal site; 3) the
management of the coal ash disposal site.

1. Investigation of the components of coal ash

In  order  to  minimize  the  interference  of  any  external
environmental  influence  on  the  coal  ash  samples,
Greenpeace  staff  took  care  to  collect  only  coal  ash  that
was  newly  discharged  to  inside  or  outside  the  disposal
site.  The  analysis  was  arranged  by  the  Greenpeace
Research Laboratory at the University of Exeter20. In this
investigation, Greenpeace detected more than 20 different
kinds of harmful substances (heavy metals and chemical
compounds)  in  samples  collected  from  the  coal  ash
disposal sites of the 14 power plants across the country.
See Table 2.2 for a summary of the results.

Every  year,  through  the  burning  of  coal,  power  plants
release a substantial quantity of harmful substances into our
environment. While the concentration of heavy metals and
other toxic substances in coal ash is not so high compared
to that of some types of industrial pollution, the scale of coal
ash production is so great as to make it a highly serious
pollutant  indeed.  What’s  more,  coal  ash’s  effects  on  the
environment and human health are usually long-term and
chronic, and thus even more likely to escape notice.

Many heavy metals and harmful pollutants are not formally
monitored under China’s environmental laws, and related
standards  are  lacking,  rendering  pollution-prevention
measures  even  less  effective.  However,  the  government
is starting to pay more attention to heavy metal pollution.
At the end of 2009, seven government bodies, including
the Ministry of Environmental Protection, put forward the
“Guiding Principles on Strengthening the Prevention and
Control of Heavy Metal Pollution.” This document focused
on  pollution  by  lead,  mercury,  cadmium,  chromium  and
arsenic (a metalloid).

Table 2.3 displays the results of testing for these five heavy
metals in the samples from the 14 power stations. Using
rough estimates22, China’s coal power generation sector
produces  enough  coal  ash  waste  every  year  to  contain
358.75  tons  of  cadmium,  10,054.25  tons  of  chromium,
9,410 tons of arsenic, 4.25 tons of mercury and 5,345.5
tons of lead. Altogether, that’s a total of 25,000 tons of heavy
metals. It is important to note, however, that the margin of
error in using such estimation methods is undeniably high,
as heavy metal content varies depending on the type of coal
burned by the coal-fired plant.

2. Water quality near coal ash disposal sites

To  test  for  coal-ash  pollution  in  water  sources  near  the

disposal sites, Greenpeace staff collected water samples
from the discharge outlets of ash ponds or surface water
close to ash ponds at six power plants. Greenpeace staff
also collected samples from underground well water near the
ash-disposal sites of eight power stations. The samples were
tested for the presence of heavy metals and other harmful
pollutants. See Table 2.4 for a summary of the findings.

Research conducted in China and overseas23 has shown
that the action of wind and rain can cause poisonous heavy
metals  inside  coal  ash  (such  as  cadmium,  chromium,
arsenic, mercury, and lead) to leach or dissolve into water
systems. As coal ash accumulates in an ash pond and soaks
in alkalized water over a long period of time, an increased
concentration of poisonous heavy metals leaches out from
the coal ash. This can result in the pollution of nearby soil,
surface water and groundwater.

This  investigation  assessed  water  samples  from  the
discharge  outlets  of  coal  ash  ponds  and  surface  water
taken close to the ash ponds against the “Environmental
Quality Standards for Surface Water” and “Standards for
Irrigation  Water  Quality”  (see  Table  2.5).  The  well  water
samples  were  assessed  against  “Sanitary  Standards  for
Drinking Water” (See Table 2.6).

Surface water samples taken from four power stations out
of six showed concentrations of pollutants that exceeded
levels stipulated in the “Environmental Quality Standards
for  Surface  Water”  and  “Standards  for  Irrigation  Water
Quality”.  Water  samples  from  Douhe  Power  Plant  had
traces  of  fluorides  233%  higher  than  the  concentration
allowed  by  the  “Environmental  Quality  Standards,”
while  water  samples  from  Chifeng  Thermal  Power  Plant
contained fluoride at concentrations 187% higher than that
allowed. As for the “Standards for Irrigation Water Quality,”
water samples from Douhe Power Plant contained fluoride
at  concentrations  of  67%  over  the  maximum,  while  the
Chifeng  Power  Plant’s  water  sample  showed  boron  at
concentrations  of  29%  over  the  maximum  and  fluorides
at  43%  over  the  maximum.  At  Fengzhen  Power  Plant,
boron exceeded maximum concentrations by 400%, and
at  Datong  Number  Two  Power  Plant,  boron  exceeded
concentrations by 17%.

Of  the  samples  of  underground  well  water  taken  from
near  eight  power  stations,  three  of  them  contained
concentrations  of  pollutants  that  exceeded  levels  set  by
the  “Sanitary  Standards  for  Drinking  Water.”  At  Douhe
Power Plant, the concentration of nitrates was 36% over
the  maximum;  at  Chifeng  Thermal  Power  Plant,  boron
was  found  in  concentrations  80%  over  the  maximum;
at  Yuanbaoshan  Power  Plant,  boron  concentrations
exceeded  the  maximum  by  270%,  m olybdenum
concentrations by 103%, nitrate concentrations by 74%,
and fluoride concentrations by 180%s.

3. Investigation on the environmental
management of coal ash disposal sites

Coal  ash  is  treated  as  a  solid  industrial  waste  in  China,
with  the  main  regulations  governing  its  management
laid  out  in  the  “Standards  for  Pollution  Control  on  the
Storage  and  Disposal  Sites  for  General  Industrial  Solid
Waste.” These standards cover storage and handling, site
selection,  design,  operations  management,  site  closure,
and  pollution  control  and  monitoring.  However,  from
Greenpeace’s onsite investigations, we discovered that the
majority of coal ash disposal sites had far from adequate
site  selection  and  preventative  measures  against  dust
dispersal, leakages and run-off of pollutants.

(1) Site selection

According to Regulation 5 in the “Standards for Pollution
Control  on  the  Storage  and  Disposal  Sites  for  General
Industrial Solid Waste,” sites for a coal ash-disposal facility
“should  be  consistent  with  the  locality’s  overall  planning
requirements,  be  located  downwind  of  industrial  and
residential  areas,  and  be  at  least  500  metres  away  from
the nearest residential area.”

However,  during  Greenpeace’s  onsite  investigations,  we
discovered that the majority of ash disposal sites were much
closer to the nearest villages than 500m.  At Douhe Power
Plant, the coal ash disposal dam was less than 50 metres
away from Lijiayu village as the crow flies. There are villages
on all four sides of the coal ash disposal sites of Shentou
Number  2  Power  Plant,  Pannan  Power  Plant,  Fengzhen
Power Plant, Yuanbaoshan Power Plant, Datong Number
2  Power  Plant,  Fengcheng  Number  1  Power  Plant  and
Fengcheng Number 2 Power Plant. Some well-known dairy

farms are located very close to the ash disposal sites of
Fengzhen Power Plant and Yuanbaoshan Power Plant, while
at Chifeng Thermal Power Plant and Jiujiang Power Plant,
the ash disposal sites are located within city boundaries,
where the population density is very high. Dongjiao Badui
village is located less than 50 metres downwind of Chifeng
Thermal Power Plant’s coal ash disposal site.

(2) Prevention of dust dispersal

During the investigation, we discovered that in the water-scarce
region of northern China, coal ash disposal sites tend not to be
equipped with effective safeguards (such as water spraying) to
prevent the wind dispersal of dry ash. In the southern areas,
power plants will add water to coal ash to prevent the wind
dispersal of dry ash. But this measure has limited effectiveness,
with nearby villages and farmland still receiving various levels of
dust pollution from the coal ash sites.

Villagers  living  near  the  14  power  plants  investigated  in
this  study  all  said  that  they  suffered  from  skin  disease
and  respiratory  diseases  (including  lung  problems).
Near  the  ash  disposal  sites  of  Fengzhen  Power  Plant,
Yuanbaoshan Power Plant, Togtoh Power Plant, Shentou
Number  2  Power  Plant,  Fengcheng  Number  1  Power
Plant  and  Fengcheng  Number  2  Power  Plant,  cows
and  sheep  suffered  from  diarrhoea,  reduced  milk,  a
fall  in  birth  rates  and  increased  mortality,  possibly  from
eating grass contaminated by coal-ash dust pollution. A
substantial amount of dust floats down and contaminates
neighbouring fields, causing soil salinization.

(3) Leakage prevention

To  prevent  the  leakage  of  general  solid  industrial  waste
and leachate, ash disposal sites are required to “construct

11

The True Cost of Coal
–– An Investigation into Coal Ash in China (2010)

retaining  walls,  embankments,  etc,  use  natural  or  man-
made  impermeable  materials,  and  if  necessary,  install
leachate  treatment  facilities.  At  least  three  water-quality
monitoring wells should be established near the coal ash
storage and handling facility to assess leachate pollution
of groundwater”.

and  Ganyugou  villages  near  Douhe  Power  Plant  and
Shuimotou  village  near  Shentou  Number  2  Power  Plant
had cracked and deformed from the absorption of rising
ground water due to increasing water-level pressure from
the coal ash dams. The majority of these houses are now
becoming uninhabitable.

Because all the ash disposal sites at the 14 power stations
in this investigation had already started operations, it was
impossible for Greenpeace to conduct a technical analysis of
their leakage prevention facilities. Datong Number 2 Power
Plant was the only one that was currently building a new coal
ash disposal site. During Greenpeace’s fieldwork, workers
were in the process off laying out anti-leakage lining. These
15-centimetres-width liners were laid down at the bottom of
the newly constructed ash dam and bonded piece by piece
with only adhesive materials, which lack the effectiveness to
prevent leakage in the long run.

Suspended  matter,  fluoridisation  and  alkalization  were
also found in water samples taken from village well water
near  the  coal  ash  disposal  sites  of  Douhe  Power  Plant,
Chifeng  Thermal  Power  Plant,  Fengzhen  Power  Plant,
Yuanbaoshan  Power  Plant,  Shentou  Number  2  Power
Plant  and  Jiujiang  Power  Plant.  Because  ground  water
was  contaminated  by  leachates  from  coal  ash  disposal
sites,  villagers  were  forced  to  change  their  source  of
drinking water, with some people having no choice but to
buy relatively expensive bottled water.

In  addition,  the  building  foundations  of  houses  in  Lijiayu

(4) Run-off prevention

In  June  2006,  the  ash  dam  at  the  Pannan  Power  Plant
in  Guizhou  province  (one  of  the  14  power  stations
Greenpeace  investigated  in  2010)  failed.  About  300,000
tons of ash slurry directly flowed into the Tuochang River.

While  investigating  Shentou  Number  2  Power  Plant,
Qujing  Power  Plant  and  Fengcheng  Number  1  Power
Plant, Greenpeace discovered that their coal ash disposal
sites did not have a secure dam structure, and in some
cases  not  even  a  retaining  wall.  In  August  2010,  two
months after our onsite investigation, a 100-metre section
of  ash  dam  gave  way  at  the  Shentou  Number  2  Power
Plant in Shanxi province. Toxic coal ash sludge spilled out,
submerging about 120 hectares of fields.

We  also  discovered  that  the  coal  ash  disposal  sites  of
Fengcheng  Number  1  Power  Plant  and  Fengcheng
Number 2 Power Plant are both located within the flood
zone of Fengcheng city.  In the event of a flood, it is very
likely that coal ash could pollute a substantially larger area
of farmland and residential land.

Government  Agencies  Responsible  for
Handling Coal Ash

Coal ash is either recycled into other materials (comprehensive utilization) or disposed
of  in  a  coal  ash  impoundment.  The  two  government  agencies  that  are  most  closely
connected  with  coal  ash  management  are  the  National  Development  and  Reform
Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP). The NDRC is
responsible for managing coal ash utilization while the MEP is concerned with preventing
coal ash from polluting the environment.

development of a circular economy and environmental-protection industry.

Within  the  department,  the  Environmental  Standards  Administration  is

responsible for environmental standards covering the handling of coal ash,

while the Environmental Technology Division is responsible for guidance on

coal ash comprehensive utilization technology. For example, the Department

The True Cost of Coal
–– An Investigation into Coal Ash in China (2010)

1. Growing hand-in-hand: coal-fired power
plants and coal ash waste

Coal ash is the inevitable by-product of burning coal, and
as  the  country  expands  its  coal-fired  power  sector,  the
amount  of  coal  ash  waste  is  also  increasing.  The  coal-
fired power industry’s explosive rise began in 2002, driven
by  the  fast  pace  of  economic  development  and  market
demands. At the end of 2002, China’s installed capacity
of  electricity  generation  was  357  GW29.  This  year  it  is
expected to exceed 900 GW30, of which more than 70%
is  coal-fired  power.  In  other  words,  over  the  past  eight
years, the installed capacity of coal-fired plants has grown
by an annual average of over 47.5 GW. That’s equivalent
to building a new coal-fired power plant every week. Such
a speed is unprecedented in the world.

This  expansion  of  power  generation  has  created  the
foundation  for  the  country’s  economic  rise,  helping  to
reduce poverty and raise living standards. But at the same
time,  China’s  heavy  dependency  on  coal  has  created
worrying environmental consequences. Over the last eight
years, with the coal-fired power sector’s rapid expansion,
the amount of coal ash produced has increased by over
2.5  times.  Coal  ash  is  now  the  single  biggest  source  of
solid  industrial  waste  in  China,  and  it  has  become  an
enormous challenge for environmental management.

2. Exaggeration of coal ash utilization results
in underestimation of coal ash pollution

In  the  early  stages  of  China’s  industrial  development,
provisions  on  the  handling  of  coal  ash  were  quite
extensive. After the 1980s, the comprehensive utilization of
coal ash was aggressively developed, with the concept of
“combined storage-use” gradually becoming the guiding
principle behind coal ash management.  As China entered
the 21st century, however, greater emphasis was placed
on “scientific development” and environmental protection,
and governments at all levels began focusing on coal ash
utilization. This has resulted in the guiding principle behind
coal-ash handling becoming, simply, “utilization”.

In 2005, the Chinese government put forward the “Eleventh
Five Year Plan (2006-2010): Guiding Principles behind the
Comprehensive  Utilization  of  Resources.”  It  states  that
“by  2010,  the  rate  of  comprehensive  utilization  of  solid
industrial waste should reach 60%; within this, the rate of
coal-ash  comprehensive  utilization  should  reach  75%.”
In 2007, a “State Council Notice on Energy Conservation
and  Emissions  Reduction  Comprehensive  Work  Plan”
also stipulated that “by 2010, the rate of comprehensive

utilization  of  solid  industrial  waste  should  exceed  60%.”
This included coal ash. After the announcement of these
key goals at the central government level, many regional
governments also included this 60% target into their own
provincial  or  regional  objectives.  In  addition  to  setting
objectives,  central  and  many  local  governments  also
introduced  measures  to  advance  coal  ash  utilization31,
such  as  establishing  special  funds,  offering  tax  benefits
and other preferential policies.

Because  the  government’s  utilization  target  was  set
fairly  high  and  included  appropriate  incentives,  these
preferential policies have helped to increase the country’s
coal  ash  utilization  capacity.  Despite  this,  however,  coal
ash utilization has lagged far behind the growth in coal-ash
production. Manufacturing building materials with recycled
coal ash waste is more expensive than with conventional
materials,  and  consequently,  these  additional  costs
have  made  it  impossible  to  increase  coal  ash  utilization
as  much  as  desired  in  such  a  short  time.  In  reality,  the
utilization  rate  of  coal  ash  is  far  below  60%.  Based  on
interviews  with  companies  and  experts,  research,  and
ground investigation, Greenpeace estimates that the real
utilization rate of coal ash is only about 30%. This means
that  at  least  262.5  million  tons  of  coal  ash  needs  to  be
stored in impoundments every year.

Unfortunately, this serious discrepancy between coal ash
utilization objectives and reality has received little attention.
The problem has arisen not only out of the difficulties of
verifying  data  from  the  coal-fired  plants,  but  also  from
loopholes in existing policies.

The  power  sector’s  exaggeration  of  coal  ash  utilization
rates  is  a  prevailing  problem.  Under  the  existing  policy
framework, it is the users of coal that are responsible for
improving  the  rate  of  coal  ash  utilization.  This  approach
allows  power  plants  to  casually  “adjust”  their  figures
in  order  to  fulfill  the  utilization  target  of  60%  under  the
pressure of political demands.

The other problem is that although power companies must
submit their data to the NRDC, the MEP and the Statistics
Office  every  year,  under  current  laws  and  regulations  it
is not clear who is in charge of verifying that data. Also,
China has not assigned legal culpability to individuals or
corporations who falsely report coal ash utilization data.

These  problems  have  created  a  false  impression  that
China  is  recycling  most  of  its  coal  ash  waste  –  and
therefore coal ash causes limited environmental damage.
This  has  led  both  the  government  and  the  public  to

16

seriously  overlook  the  scale  and  degree  of  coal  ash
pollution in China.

3. Flaws in Environmental Pollution
Prevention and Control Policies

In  China,  coal  ash  falls  under  the  management  of  solid
industrial  waste.  The  policy  most  closely  related  to
the  prevention  of  coal  ash  pollution  is  the  “Law  on  the
Prevention  and  Control  of  Environmental  Pollution  from
Solid Waste,” (revised 2004). The MEP is responsible for
its  enforcement.  Other  existing  relevant  environmental
laws are the “Environmental Protection Law,” “Air Pollution
Prevention  and  Control  Law”  (revised  2000),  “Water
Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Law”  (revised  2008),
“Marine  Environment  Protection  Law”  (revised  1999),
“Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Law,”  “Law  on  the
Prevention  and  Control  of  Radioactive  Pollution,”  and  a
variety of local and regional statutes What is noteworthy
about this is that they are all part of the basic framework of
laws on environmental protection and resource utilization.
Nevertheless, as the content of these basic laws is fairly
general, they are difficult to apply in practice.

Of  those  used,  the  “Standards  for  Pollution  Control  on
the  Storage  and  Disposal  Sites  for  General  Industrial
Solid  Waste”  is  the  most  relevant.  These  mandatory
standards  are  primarily  concerned  with  preventing  the
dispersal, leakage or run-off of pollutants. However, coal
ash is different from other types of solid industrial waste.
Because  China’s  power  sector  is  overly  reliant  on  coal,
the amount of coal ash produced is enormous, resulting
in  a  huge  amount  of  toxic  substances  (such  as  heavy
metals,  etc) being released into the  environment. As the

coal power industry expanded over the last few decades,
much of the resulting coal ash waste has been stored in
impoundments, which creates a significant risk of pollutant
dispersal,  leakage  or  run-off.  Consequently,  it  is  crucial
that pollution-prevention technology requirements for coal
ash  impoundments  be  even  higher  in  order  to  minimize
the health and environmental threats from coal ash.

In addition to the “Standards for Pollution Control on the
Storage  and  Disposal  Sites  for  General  Industrial  Solid
Waste,” more than 20 national and industry standards are
currently in use or are being drawn up. Only a minority of
these  is  mandatory;  the  others  are  voluntary  standards
that industries are merely encouraged to adopt. Therefore,
irrespective  of  the  content  of  these  standards,  their
effectiveness is too limited to serve as a strong control to
the practices of coal-fired plants. This is one of the main
reasons that it is very difficult for China to make any major
headway on preventing coal ash pollution.

There  is  a  clear  need  for  China  to  further  improve  its
pollution  control  legislation  because  existing  laws  and
regulations  on  the  prevention  of  coal  ash  pollution  are
difficult  to  apply  in  practice,  and  the  implementation  of
standards is neither targeted nor compulsory.

4. Weakness in Environmental Law
Enforcement

Flaws in pollution prevention and control policies seriously
hamper  the  enforcement  of  legislation  on  coal  ash.  We
have seen an evolution in China’s coal ash management,
which  has  moved  toward  emphasizing  utilization.  The
powerful economic ministries and their resource-utilization

The True Cost of Coal
–– An Investigation into Coal Ash in China (2010)

policies  have  grown  stronger,  while  the  environmental
ministries  and  their  environmental  protection  legislation
have been relatively weakened. The implementation space
for  environmental  protection  legislation  has  continuously
shrunk. Comprehensive utilization work is given more and
more  attention  and  resources,  whereas  pollution  control
work has been marginalized. At the same time, there has
been  a  lack  of  cooperation  mechanisms  between  the
bodies governing comprehensive utilization and pollution
control.

Considering  the  severity  of  China’s  coal  ash  problem,
MEP  law  enforcement  methods  appear  relatively  weak.
The most common method is to levy a pollution charge.
The  “National  Standards  and  Management  Practices  for
Sewage  Fee  Collection”  stipulates  that:  “if  either  non-
specialized storage facilities or handling facilities, as well
as specialized storage facilities or handling facilities, do not
meet environmental protection standards on the discharge
of industrial solid waste (that is, they are unable to prevent
pollutant  dispersal,  leakage  or  run-off),  a  one-off  solid
waste emissions fee will be levied.” One ton of discharged
coal ash carries a 30 yuan fee. Here, the standards used
are those governing the construction of facilities to prevent
the dispersal, leakage or run-off of pollutants.  Specifically,
it  refers  to  the  “Standards  on  the  pollution  control  of
regular industrial solid waste storage and disposal sites.”

In  practice,  unless  a  coal-fired  plant  fails  to  build  any
kind of coal ash storage facility, or is discovered directly
discharging coal ash waste into water sources or engaged
in other very serious polluting behaviour, the chances of it
being charged pollution fines are extremely low. Even if it is
charged RMB 30 per ton, this is not an effective deterrent.
But because of a lack of effective regulations, apart from
levying  fees,  the  MEP  has  no  other  recourse  to  force  a
coal-fired plant to improve its coal ash storage facilities.

Moreover,  when  a  coal-fired  plant  is  selecting  a  site  for
its  coal  ash  impoundment,  the  MEP-led  environmental
assessment  is  often  just  a  formality.  Sometimes
construction  of  the  coal-fired  plant  starts  without  even
its  environmental  impact  assessment  being  approved.
Greenpeace investigations in the field have also uncovered
that some local environmental bureaus have ignored the
environmental  laws,  creating  a  lack  of  enforcement  in
environmental monitoring.

5. The absence of comprehensive utilization
and environmental administration

Since  the  1990s,  there  have  been  major  developments
in  administrative  laws  and  regulations  aimed  at
encouraging  the  comprehensive  utilization  of  coal  ash.
The  most  relevant  of  these  are  the  “Eleventh  Five-Year-
Plan  on  National  Environmental  Protection,”  “Law  to
promote  Circular  Economy”,  “National  Policy  Outline  on
Technology  for  Comprehensive  Utilization  of  Resources”
and the “Administrative Measures on the Comprehensive
Utilization of Coal Ash” (revised in 1994).

In  addition,  many  local  governments,  including  Beijing,
Shanghai,  Chongqing,  Hebei,  Shandong,  Hunan,
Guizhou,  Nanjing,  Fushun,  Guangzhou,  Datong,  Dalian,
Harbin, Wuhai, and Tangshan, have drawn up their own
regulations on coal ash comprehensive utilization.

Coal  ash  contains  harmful  substances,  which  remain  in
the coal ash after being recycled and continue to threaten
public health and the environment.  However, according
to  China’s  current  policy,  once  coal  ash  (a  solid  waste
product)  has  been  recycled  into  other  byproducts  or
finished products (for example concrete, bricks, subgrade,
dam materials, etc), it no longer falls under the jurisdiction
of  environmental  protection  laws  on  solid  waste.  This
has created a gap in environmental protection legislation
and government monitoring on coal ash utilization. Unlike
the  European  Union,  which  regulates  recycled  coal  ash
products as commercial chemical products, China lacks
such a corresponding regulation. There is an urgent need
for such new rules and codes of conduct to be introduced
in China.

At both the central and local government levels, existing
legislation  on  the  comprehensive  utilization  of  coal  ash
pertains  only  to  the  utilization  of  resources,  and  fails
to  include  plans  for  the  supervision  and  management
of  harmful  substances  in  coal  ash  when  and  after
it’s    recycled.  Of  the  16  standards  applied  to  coal  ash
utilization  management,  none  has  a  comprehensive
provision to deal with the levels of the toxic and radioactive
elements present in coal ash waste. Although the ultimate
purpose  of  comprehensive  utilization  is  to  protect  the
environment  and  to  promote  sustainable  development,
existing regulations fail to provide specific safeguards for
the environment and human health.

Chapter Five
Policy Recommendations

The following policy recommendations (split into two parts) have been drawn up
by Greenpeace, with the aim of reducing the threat of coal ash pollution to public
health and the environment.

The True Cost of Coal
–– An Investigation into Coal Ash in China (2010)

1. Highlight and strengthen environmental law
enforcement within the existing legal framework

1.The  Standing  Committee  of  the  National  People’s  Congress
should incorporate the “Law on the Prevention of Environmental
Pollution by Solid Waste” into the law enforcement, supervision,
and  inspection  plan.  They  should  also  supervise  and  urge  all
regions  and  government  departments  to  actively  perform  their
legal duties. The intervention of the highest organ of state can
strongly highlight the importance of preventing coal ash pollution
to all parts of society.

2.The  State  Council  should  conduct  a  nationwide  specialized,
targeted  corrective  campaign  on  coal  ash  environmental
pollution.  This  campaign  should  include:  to  conduct  a
comprehensive audit on the coal-fired plants’ coal ash utilization
rate  to  determine  an  accurate  picture  of  the  scale  of  coal  ash
waste;  to  focus  on  identifying  deficiencies  or  weaknesses  in
environmental  management  facilities,  as  well  as  the  potential
causes  of  secondary  geological  disasters  at  coal  ash  disposal
sites; and to set corrective deadlines for the above.

3.China should incorporate environmental management of coal
ash  into  local  government  official’s  performance  evaluation
criteria;  promote  and  implement  administrative  and  local
government  accountability  mechanisms;  and  strengthen  the
administrative  authority  of  coal  ash  pollution  management  in  a
similar way to the handling of mine safety and accidents.

4.The  MEP  should  strengthen  enforcement  of  the  “Law  on
the  Prevention  of  Environmental  Pollution  by  Solid  Waste”
as  well  as  strengthen  the  monitoring  and  research  of  coal
ash  environmental  pollution.  They  should  provide  the  public
with  information  on  coal  ash  treatment  that  does  not  meet
environmental  protection  standards  through  environmental
information  disclosure  procedures;  ensure  proper  investigation
and punishment according to the law; and hold officials involved
accountable.

2. Improve coal ash pollution management
legislation

1.Based on the existing “Law on the Prevention of Environmental
Pollution  by  Solid  Waste,”  the  State  Council  or  the  MEP  can
take  the  lead  on  formulating  an  implementable  “Coal  Ash
Environmental  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  Measures.”
They  should  also  operationalize  the  general  provisions  of  the
laws through administrative regulations or directive orders. The
above  proposed  “Measures”  should  work  in  concert  with  the
“Administrative  Measures  on  the  Comprehensive  Utilization
of Coal Ash”  (revised in  1994)  in  order  to promote the guiding
principle  of  paying  equal  attention  to  the  twin  problems  of
utilizing coal ash and managing its environmental pollution.

China  should  learn  from  the  experiences  of  the  U.S.,  the
E.U.  and  other  developed  countries  in  handling  coal  ash
environmental  pollution.  This  include:  the  careful  selection
of  coal-fired  plant  and  ash  impoundment  locations;  the

planning  and  setting  of  standards  for  environmental  impact
assessments,  as  well  as    methods  for  public  participation;
the management of coal ash pollution that complies  with the
“three-simultaneous system”32  requirement; impermeable layer
design requirements; monitoring groundwater and soil pollution;
standards on the environmental monitoring of comprehensive
utilization;  standards  for  the  conditions  and  qualifications  of
recycled  components;  scope  and  legal  responsibilities  of  the
subject of duty in environmental protection; supportive financial
and taxation policies; fines and standards on coal ash pollution
discharges;  law  enforcement  mechanisms  and  procedures;
planning  for  regulatory  adjustments  during  interim  periods;
the  relationship  between  old  and  new  regulations;  and  more
targeted  and  practical  systems  and  standards.  Based  on
the  above  proposed  “Measures,”  China  should  draw  up  a
complete  new  set  of  corresponding  environmental  standards
on pollution prevention, or make existing voluntary standards
mandatory, and ensure that each key part of the provisions has
clear operational specifications and requirements.

2.The relevant legislation should increase the number of specialized
provisions on coal ash treatment in order to break down tasks on
coal ash pollution prevention and control and incorporate it into law.
The following relevant laws are currently in the legislative process:
“Land Management Law” (revised), “Air Pollution Prevention and
Control Law” (revised), “Energy Law,” “Law on Nature Reserves,”
“Environmental Protection Law,” “Coal Law”(revised), and “Soil
Pollution Prevention and Control Law,” etc.

3.In  the  revision  of  the  “Measures  on  the  Comprehensive
Utilization of Coal Ash,” the experiences of  the EU and other
developed  countries  should  be  used  as  a  reference  point  to
explore  the  ways  in  which  China  can  improve  its  handling  of
pollution prevention in coal ash utilization, implement a wide-
ranging  set  of  regulations  to  monitor  the  overall  utilization
production process, and fill the pollution and control legislative
gap on coal ash utilization.

The  MEP  should  be  more  actively  involved  in  the  revision  of
“Measures  on  the  Comprehensive  Utilization  of  Coal  Ash”
and  other  related  legislation  in  order  to  ensure  that  pollution
prevention and control objectives are reflected adequately in all
policy legislation. At the same time, there is a need to establish
a  permanent  information-sharing  and  communications
mechanism  between  the  NRDC  and  the  MEP.  Whenever  it
becomes difficult to automatically coordinate policy objectives
between  the  two  parties,  they  should  immediately  initiate  an
effective conflict-resolution mechanism.

4.China should take the next step in improving the coal pricing
system through introducing a carbon tax, a resource tax or other
relevant policies as ways to internalize the external costs of coal. At
the same time, China should make great efforts to improve energy
efficiency and develop the renewable energy. The government should
promote the optimization of the national energy mix, and gradually
move away from its over-dependency on coal as a surefire means of
controlling coal ash pollution at its source.
