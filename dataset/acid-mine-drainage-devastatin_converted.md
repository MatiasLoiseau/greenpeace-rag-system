Acid Mine Drainage: devastating to aquatic life

Summary
Acid streams resulting from mining activities from certain types of mineral deposits such
as those at Rapu Rapu are highly toxic to the aquatic environment. The extreme acidity is
toxic to most aquatic life and even after neutralisation the precipitate formed continues to
affect  aquatic  organisms.  Toxic  elements,  such  as  copper,  cadmium  and  zinc  are  often
associated  with  acidic  mine  drainage,  contributing  substantially  to  the  devastating
ecological effects of acid mine drainage.

An  outflow  of  acid  mine  drainage  from  the  Lafayette  mines  in  Rapu  Rapu  into  the  sea
would undoubtedly affect local marine life. It could silt up corals causing coral mortality
and cause the depletion of bottom dwelling organisms, which would have domino effects
up the ecosystem, reducing the food sources available for animals at the top of the marine
food chain, e.g. sharks. The toxic elements could also be taken up into the marine food
chain, causing long term health effects to marine life, and some may bioaccumulate up the
food chain.

Although AMD can be treated at the mine to some degree, e.g. by neutralisation at source,
this process is never fully efficient. Furthermore, accidents with the treatment system are
inevitable. Earthquakes, tropical storms and typhoons occur regularly in the Philippines.
These  could  cause  tailings  dams  to  break  or  cause  flooding,  sending  a  large  pulse  of
either acid mine drainage, or the precipitate downstream, which could have devastating
effects on corals and marine life. Mining accidents with this type of mine have occurred
recently in Europe and also in the Philippines. These have resulted in adverse environmental
and ecological effects, with the possibility of, as yet unquantified, long term impacts.

Therefore, Greenpeace demands that there should be no mining in Rapu Rapu because of
the risk of severe adverse effects on the corals and marine life. Lafayette(cid:146)s discharges flow
into  the Albay  Gulf,  an  acknowledged    migration  path  for  whale  sharks  and  five  out  of
seven of the world(cid:146)s marine turtles, thus, making it wholly unsuitable for a mine site.

What is acid mine drainage?
Acid mine drainage is predominantly caused by the weathering of pyrite. Pyrite oxidises to produce
very  acidic  waters  (pH  <  3),  which  can  solubilise  heavy  metals  and  other  toxic  elements  and
cause them to be transported downstream, eventually ending up in the sea (Pentreath. 1994;
Jenkins et al., 2000.)

Pyrite is a mineral composed of iron and sulphur (FeS2), often called (cid:147)fool(cid:146)s gold(cid:148) because of its
gold colour. Pyrite sometimes occurs in large quantities in various types of mineral deposits, such
as that at Rapu-Rapu. In addition to pyrite, these mineral deposits often contain other, much more
valuable metals such as copper, zinc and gold, which are mined. Pyrite, however, is not normally
mined.  One  extremely  r  toxic  metal  associated  with  these  types  of  mineral  deposits,  but  not
necessarily mined, is cadmium.

Mineral deposits containing pyrite are usually present as sulphides, deposited in the layers of rock
beneath the earth(cid:146)s surface, where there is little or no oxygen. When mining occurs, these deposits
are brought to the surface and crushed. The mineral deposits are crushed, the valuable minerals
containing copper or zinc or gold taken out and the waste rock containing pyrite is left at the mine
site. Thus, large amounts of pyrite become exposed to surface air and water the pyrite weathers,
or oxidises. Although acid streams can occur naturally (e.g. Yellowstone National Park, USA),
most are a result of mining activities giving rise to acid mine drainage. (Jenkins et al., 2000.)

The weathering of pyrite produces acid. The sulphide in pyrite oxidises to sulphate, to become
sulphuric acid. The iron in pyrite also oxidises or rusts, which drives the reaction further. Specialist
oxidising bacteria that can survive the extreme conditions catalyse the reaction. Crushing also
increases the rate of weathering, which increases the surface area exposed to the atmosphere.
Hence, the weathering of pyrite in mine-waste proceeds quickly compared to normal weathering
of rock and mine wastes containing pyrite can produce extremely acidic waters. The reactions go
on, not only during the life of the mine, but also for many decades and even centuries beyond.

The acid waters dissolve many of the minerals present causing iron and potentially toxic elements
from the ore, such as copper, cadmium and zinc, to be solubilised. The waters are then discharged
into a stream and, at Rapu Rapu, into the sea. The acidity can be neutralised slowly by the stream
or rapidly by the ocean.

Whilst copper and zinc are essential trace elements for plant and animal life (including humans),
at higher doses they are toxic. There are no known beneficial properties of cadmium. It is highly
toxic to plants, animals and humans and many aquatic species are very sensitive to cadmium.
When  present  in  bioavailable  forms,  bioaccumulation  has  been  observed  in  both  aquatic  and
terrestrial organisms (Savinov, 2003)

Environmental and ecological effects of acid mine drainage
Acidity and metal toxicity
The high acidity of acid mine drainage and the high amounts of dissolved heavy metals (such as
copper and zinc) generally make acid mine drainage extremely toxic to most organisms (Pentreath,
1994). Many streams derived from acid mine drainage are largely devoid of life for a long way
downstream.

Sedimentation
Drainage  water  from  acid  mine  drainage  is  initially  clear  but  turns  a  vivid  orange  colour  as  it
becomes neutralised because of the precipitation of iron oxides and hydroxides. This precipitate,
often called ochre, is very fine and smothers the river bed with a very fine silt. Thus, small animals
that used to feed on the bottom of the stream or ocean (benthic organisms) can no longer feed
and so are depleted. Because these animals are at the bottom of the aquatic food chain, this has
impacts higher up the food chain into fish. So, even if the acidity and heavy metals are neutralised,
acid mine drainage still affects wildlife a long way down stream because of these indirect effects.

In addition to killing bottom dwelling organisms, this smothering ochre or orange precipitate reduces
the amount of gravel for fish to lay their eggs on, and hence affecting fish breeding. (Pentreath,
1994). The sediment also contains the toxic elements that were dissolved in the acid mine drainage
before  neutralisation.  These  are  now  transported  as  particulates  downstream  and,  eventually,
into the sea.

Effects on marine ecosystem
Acid  mine  drainage  will  be  neutralised  by  the  sea,  unless  it  is  already  neutralised. The  ochre
(orange  precipitate)  may  be  formed  in  the  sea  as  the  stream  enters  the  sea,  or  the  ochre  is
formed in the stream and washed in to the sea by the stream (e.g. at high flow). Either way, the
ochre will increase sediment loads carried into the sea in the vicinity of Rapu Rapu. although
some ochre may be carried away by ocean currents.

It is not clear what the effects of acid mine drainage would be, but adverse effects from the mining
are highly likely. Similar effects of the precipitate would be seen in the marine environment as the
fresh water. The coral reef surrounding Rapu Rapu is highly likely to also be affected by the ochre
precipitate. The ochre will increase smother the coral reefs in the vicinity of the stream estuary,
causing  coral  mortality. Again,  this  will  not  only  affect  the  coral  reef  itself,  which  is  a  valuable
ecosystem, but there are likely to be knock-on effects up the food chain.

The ochre precipitate could reduce the area available for fish to lay their eggs on by smothering
the seabed near the estuary, hence affecting fish breeding. The smothering would cause loss of
bottom dwelling organisms on the seabed, having domino effects up the food chain by reducing
the food sources available for animals at the top of the marine food chain, e.g. fish and sharks.

There is potential for acid mine drainage to influence the food chain in the near vicinity, resulting
in possible negative effects on the whale shark and other marine life.

Not only could there be a reduction in the area available for fish spawning caused by the smothering
ochre precipitate, but this ochre contains toxic elements such as copper, cadmium and zinc.

Accidents do happen
Can AMD be controlled?
Although AMD can be treated at the mine to some degree, e.g. by neutralisation at source by
limestone, settling and tailings ponds or wetlands, this process is never fully efficient. Furthermore,
accidents with the treatment system are inevitable. Earthquakes, tropical storms and typhoons
are known to occur in the area. These could break dams, or cause flooding, sending a large pulse
of either acid mine drainage, or the precipitate downstream, which could have devastating effects
on marine life. Indeed, similar accidents have happened previously, both in the Philippines and
elsewhere.

Learning from history
a) Aznalc(cid:243)llar, Southern Spain. In April 1998, a tailings dam at a zinc mine in Southern Spain
ruptured  and  caused  the  largest  environmental  pollution  accident  recorded  in  Spanish  history.
The tailings were highly acidic as a result of pyrite waste rock and contained predominantly iron
and sulphur with copper, zinc, lead and arsenic. As the dam broke, an estimated 2 million cubic
metres  of  black  acidic,  metal-rich  sludge  and  water  flowed  down  river  to  the  estuary,  Doæana
(Grimault et al., 1999). This area is an internationally important wetlands area for resident and
migrating birds but became coated in a layer of toxic mud.

All fish and shellfish present in the watercourses of Doæana died and tonnes of dead fish were
collected from the area. Emergency clean up measures costing 200 million Euros, such as removal
of  the  toxic  sludge  and  setting  up  a  water  treatment  plant  help  alleviate  the  disaster,  but
contamination from the spill still persists (Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2006). Follow up studies indicate
that arsenic and copper liver levels were elevated in waterbirds that died in the months after the
spill. Copper and zinc have entered the food chain (Taggart et al., 2006), whilst arsenic may be a
long-term risk to species feeding on roots of aquatic plants as these have become coated with
arsenic  containing  ochre  (Taggart  et  al.,  2005).  Thus,  the  tailings  spill  in  Spain  not  only  had
catastrophic  short  term  effects  of  this  tailings  spill,  there  are  likely  to  be  long-term  effects  on
wildlife.

b) Marinduque, Philippines. In 1996, a severe spill occurred from a tailings pond at Marcopper
Mine, Marinduque, when over 1.5 million cubic metres of mine tailings flowed down the Boac river
and into the sea. Subsequent studies have made this a well documented case of the impacts of
acid  mine  drainage  and  mine  tailings  on  heavy  metal  concentrations  in  the  river  and  marine
environment. Coastal sediments near the river outflow contain high amounts of copper, manganese,
lead and zinc and there are concerns that the toxic metals are persisting and may be taken up into
bottom dwelling organisms and hence into the food chain (David, 2002). Corals in the area show
bands of high toxic metal concentration, which have been dated to the 1996 spill. There is also
evidence  of  high  sedimentation  rates  in  the  corals  compatible  with  ochre  precipitation  (David,
2003). The impacts on the health of the coral and reef as a whole are, as yet, unknown.

These spills are evidence that a similar occurrence at a fully operational Rapu Rapu would result
in increased acidity in rivers, increased sedimentation on corals the environment and increased
concentrations of toxic elements in the riverine and marine ecosystems, with possible long term
effects.

Conclusion
An outflow of acid mine drainage from Rapu Rapu into the sea would undoubtedly affect
local  marine  life.  It  could  cause  coral  mortality  and  the  depletion  of  bottom  dwelling
organisms, which would have domino effects up the ecosystem. The toxic elements could
also be taken up into the marine food chain, possibly causing long term health effects to
marine life, and some may bioaccumulate up the food chain.

Mining accidents with this type of mine have occurred recently in Europe and also in the
Philippines. These have resulted in adverse environmental and ecological effects. Therefore,
Greenpeace demands that there should be no mining in Rapu Rapu because of the risk of
severe adverse effects on the corals and marine life. Lafayette(cid:146)s discharges flow into the
Albay Gulf, a migration path for whale sharks and five out of seven of the world(cid:146)s marine
turtles, thus, making it wholly unsuitable for a mine site.
