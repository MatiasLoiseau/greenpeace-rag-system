The Struggle to Stop Coal  Fired Power Plants in Bo Nok and Ban Krut, Thailand
www.cleanenergynow.org

01edison outImagine if an electricity company tried
to build a dirty coal fired power planton a rural beach near a national park in,say, southern California in 2002. 
Now, imagine if that coastal area was a breeding ground for whales and
dolphins. Most likely, the company would be laughed out of the state. 
But that’s exactly what one Southern Californian company, Edison, is try-
ing to do in Thailand against the bitter objections of local farmers andfisherfolk. 
The battle over two-coal plants proposed by Edison and some corporate
friends has emerged as one of Thailand’s most intense and longest run-ning struggles. CONTENTS

greenpeace   02The struggle against Edison is a fight for human
rights and environmental protection from the manynegative impacts of coal plants, not least amongstthem global warming.
At issue is a proposal to build two huge coal-fired
power plants in two villages on the Gulf of Thailand,Ban Krut and Bo Nok. The question as to whetherthese plants can be built has gathered steam overthe last seven years as communities in the area haveorganized a solid resistance campaign. In it, despiteoften harsh repression, they have won support fromaround the world and delayed the plants. 
Edison International, a U.S. corporation, is at the
center of a consortium pushing this model of powergeneration on to the community and government ofThailand. Villagers say that the plant developers rep-resent foreign multinationals seeking to practicegross double standards at the expense of peopleand places on the other side of the world. If theEdison Consortium has its way it will have seriousnegative affects including the following:
•uproot a sustainable community that is opposed
to such industrial development
•create a pollution problem that will despoil local
ecosystems and public health
•grossly contribute to climate change through 
carbon dioxide emissions, and 
•reduce the potential for Thailand to meet its 
electricity with clean energy.
Greenpeace aims to expose the hypocrisy of Edison
in pursuing this power plant over the wishes of thelocal community, and its failure to address the cli-mate change potential of its plans, which will be atthe expense of us all. The deeper that emergingeconomies like that of Thailand become embeddedin the dirty energy pathway, the worse global warm-ing will be in years to come. The good news is thatthere are viable alternatives to fossil fuels in theThai setting: namely wind, solar and biomass-powergeneration.
But Edison and its partners want only to bring old
King Coal to Thailand. The technology that thedevelopers would use at both the plants wouldnever meet the environmental and social protectionstandards in California, homestate of the EdisonCorporation. Yet the companies involved wouldgladly spend two billion dollars on building theseplants that would cloud the air, sully the water andchoke the children of Thailand.
Ban Krut power plant
would have the generat-ing capacity of 1,400MW of electricity. Theplant covers an area of162 hectares along theBan Krut coast, in theThongchai subdistrict,Bang-saphan district,Prachuab Khiri KhanProvince. The projectbelongs to Union PowerDevelopment Co., Ltd.(UPDC - 15%) which isshared by TomenCorporation ( Japanese -29%), Toyota Tsusho(Japanese - 15%), ShubuElectric (Japanese - 15%)and Hong Kong Electric(26%).Bo Nok power plant
would have thecapacity of generat-ing 734 MW of elec-tricity. The plant cov-ers an area of 162hectares along thecoast in the Bornoksub-district, Muangdistrict, Prachuab KiriKhan Province. Theplant belongs to GulfPower GenerationCo., Ltd. which isshared by GulfElectric Co., Ltd.(60%) and EdisonMission Energy(40%).

Edison International is a holding company, head-
quartered in Southern California. It is the “ultimate ”
parent company of Edison Mission Energy, whichowns the 40% stake in the proposed Bo Nok powerplant in Thailand. EIX, as Edison International isknown on the stock exchange, is also infamous as theparent of Southern California Edison. Its total assetsamount to U.S.$36.9 billion according to the compa-ny’s most recent tax filings. 
Southern California Edison is an embattled electricity
utility in the Los Angeles area of California that buysand sells power. SCE, the acronym by which Edison isbest known throughout the United States, services 11million customers and is literally a household name incentral and coastal Southern California. It is virtuallybankrupt at the time of writing, and has sought statesupport —a bailout —to continue its services in
California.
Edison Mission Energy is a global power generating
company that is wholly-owned by EdisonInternational. EME has 76 assets, with a net generat-ing capacity of nearly 19,000 megawatts. Projectsspan the globe, from Australia, Italy and NewZealand, to Thailand, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.It also owns significant interests in coal mines inAustralia and Indonesia —preferred sources for the Bo
Nok power plant.
There are other companies under the umbrella of
Edison International: Edison Capital provides capitaland financial services for global power and infrastruc-ture projects, Edison Enterprises is the company ’s retail
subsidiary, and Edison O&M Services provides powerplants with operations and maintenance services. Global Highlights:
Doing Business With Dictators: Located in East Java,
Indonesia, Edison ’s Paiton project consists of two
units, each producing 615 megawatts of electricity. Itis backed in large part by taxpayer money: the U.S.Export-Import Bank has helped to finance U.S. equip-ment and services exports to Paiton worth more than$500 million, while the Export-Import Bank of Japanis contributing $900 million, with other funding fromthe U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation(OPIC). On October 7, 1999, Indonesia ’s national
power company filed a lawsuit against Paiton to nul-lify the 30-year power purchase agreement signed bythe previous management of the state company in1994, under the allegedly corrupt administration offormer president Suharto.

Polluting Our National Landmarks: If you ’ve visited
the Grand Canyon and had trouble seeing it, it waspossibly because of air pollution from Edison ’s
Mojave power plant. Located in Laughlin, Nevada,the 1,580 megawatt plant burns a slurry, or soup, ofpowdered coal and water piped 275 miles from thehighly controversial Black Mesa mine. The Mojavepower station is said by some to be the largest singlesource of greenhouse gas emissions in NorthAmerica, and its torrent of air pollution halves visibil-ity in the Grand Canyon. It burns coal with no pollu-tion controls for mercury, smog, or acid rain. The onlycoal slurry line in the U.S., itdraws 3 million gallons ofancient water —the
U.S.Geological Survey esti-mates that it is 10,000 to35,000 years old —each day
from an aquifer that is oneof the few sources of waterin that region of the U.S.A.

January 24, 2002
Thousands gather in protestas Prime Minister ThaksinShinawatrat visits the siteof both plants. He promises a decision on theplants by mid-April.
18TIMELINE


05edison outOn January 24, 2002 , thousands of local villagers gath-
ered on the beach at Bo Nok in Thailand ’s Prachuap Khiri
Khan province for a visit by Thai Prime Minister ThaksinShinawatrat, who had come to tour the site of the EdisonConsortium ’s proposed coal-fired plant.
19Although the
protest was peaceful, some opponents had a clear warningfor the Prime Minister and the Edison consortium: “You
build, we burn ”. 
Greenpeace does not support property damage, but the
protesters ’ slogan reveals how contentious the 7-year bat-
tle over the two proposed coal-fired power plants inPrachuap Khiri Khan has become. It is also a clear signalfor the California-based company —Edison Mission Energy,
which owns 40 percent of one project
20—that is the cause
for so much consternation. Building this plant would be abad business decision. It should be a blinding wake up callfor anyone investing in Edison: get out while you can.
After touring both plant sites and looking at whale bones
displayed by local villagers —a symbol of the rich marine
ecosystem threatened by the project —the Prime Minister
said he would make a final decision on the plants by April13, the traditional Thai new year.
21So even though the
government has already granted the necessary licensesand signed long term power contracts with the Edisonconsortium, a potent grassroots opposition campaign hassucceeding in stalling the project —at least for now. Build up to the Stand Off
When large amounts of land started changing
hands around the Bo Nok sub-district in 1995,locals were told that developers were planning anew golf course and resort.
22By the time residents
found out about the coal-fired plant slated forthe site, it was practically a done deal: the gov-ernment had already endorsed the project andbefore long entered into long-term power con-tracts with the Edison group for years to come. 
Villagers were immediately suspicious of the
project, having heard horror stories about theinfamous coal-fired power plant complex in MaeMoh, a village in the northern Thai province ofLampang. In October 1992, the Mae Moh plantstarted leaking toxic gases, killing cattle andsending more than 4,000 people to seek medicalattention. Despite the installation of pollutionmitigation equipment, the plants leaked again in1998, with similar results.
23
“I just didn ’t believe the company and the gov-
ernment, ” says Amnvay Songying, a Bo Nok aloe
vera farmer. “In the case of Mae Moh villagers
have complained about pollution and healthproblems like asthma. ”PKK POWER STRUGGLE

greenpeace   06The Edison consortium soon adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy,
movement leaders say. Anan Pongpattana-Sagul, principal of BanNong Pulok School, organized a group of teachers to examine thedetails of the project. But after the company paid for some of theteachers to take a trip to see coal-fired power plants in Mae Moh andin the United States, many of them dropped their opposition. Mr Anansaid, “I knew that it was the company ’s trick to buy us ”.
24
Despite the company ’s efforts, local opposition grew steadily among
the community of fishers, farmers, and merchants. Villagers sentdozens of letters to federal and local authorities, staged demonstra-tions, and attracted widespread media attention. 
Crackdown
In December 1998, tired of being ignored, thousands of people ralliedin front of the Prachuap Provincial Hall. After officials failed to meetwith them, the group proceeded to block the Southern Highway, themain route between Bangkok and the south of Thailand. Althoughthe gathering was peaceful, riot police were sent in with trucks tobreak up the crowd, injuring 25 people. Even with the crackdown theprotest lasted until the Deputy Interior Minister promised villagersthat the plants would not be built as long as he is in office.
25
It was only then that the government agreed to hold public hearingson the plants. But fearing their participation would legitimize a cor-rupt process, opponents boycotted the September 1999 hearings,demanding that the Government first revoke the plant permits andmake the power contracts available to the public. Hundreds of protest-ers registered their objections by gathering outside of the hearingroom in protest.
26
Charoen Wat-aksorn, 34, a pineapple merchant and leader of theopposition movement, says that the villagers have tried for years toget attention to their cause through political channels but that onlyradical grassroots organizing ensures they are heard. “It must be a
large group of people or the threat of violence or the governmentwon’t listen, ” he said. 
Verging on Victory
The government appears to now be finally listening. The fact that the
Prime Minister visited the area of the plants in January 2002 was amilestone for the movement. Before it, in December, the Senate com-mittee on Environment urged the government to relocate the twopower plants to avoid “another riot ’’.
27But tensions are still running
high and will not abate until the proposed plants are scrapped. 
Pressure on the government to do this has been growing in recent
months. In January, 533 leading Thai academics signed a petition call-ing on the government to abandon the two projects and to set up anindependent body to review the contracts, which critics suspect gavethe companies a sweetheart deal.
28The petition made front page news
in the leading Thai newspapers. Meanwhile, the StudentConfederation of Thailand also launched a petition campaign in oppo-sition to the plants.
29POWER PLAY

07edison outWhen a researcher from Thailand ’s Science Ministry
recently reported the “discovery ” of whales off the
coast of Bo Nok, local fisherman Wirot Pongnoi wasn ’t surprised. He says he has seen whales feeding
off the coast of Bo Nok since he was a kid. “We did
not make a big deal out of it, because we justthought whales were common in the gulf, ” says the
46-year old Pongnoi.  
These days, the Bryde ’s whale has become a symbol
for the movement against the Edison group ’s power
plant at Bo Nok, and for good reason. The endan-gered whales depend on the rich marine life in thearea, just as Pongnoi and his fellow fisherman do fortheir livelihood. The developers maintain their coal-fired plant will be whale-friendly. But the existenceof whales in the area was not even mentioned in theEdison Consortium ’s Environmental Impact
Assessment. And according to a government report,coal-ash from the power plants could pose a signifi-cant threat to the whales. 
Besides whales, the area is habitat to more than 190
species of fish and several species of dolphin. TheScience Ministry ’s investigation also confirmed many
of the local villagers ’ worst fears about the project.
Among other things, it determined that the plants ’
turbines could draw in an estimated 550 minnowsper minute or some 578 million young fish per year,
killing virtually all of them and severely affecting themarine food chain.
“That would affect the marine ecosystem severely,
and this was not taken into consideration in either ofthe EIA reports for the two projects, ” said Suphavit
Piamphongsarn, head of the ministry ’s investigation
committee. “This figure we have is the minimum. It ’s
possible that the real impact would be more. ”
The plant ’s cooling system will pump hot wastewater
back into the sea, further endangering marine life.Thorn Thamrongnawaswas of Kasetsart University,told the Bangkok Post that the Bo Nok and Ban Krutpower plants would destroy 10 billion fish over theplants 25 year operational lifespan.
Fishermen are also concerned about plans to build a
2 mile-long pier, which they say will obstruct theirboats and nets. The 330,000 cubic metres of ash pro-duced by the plant would be stored within 50 feet ofa canal used by local fisherman every day. To makematters worse, debris would be dumped into theocean during construction. 
The threat to the local fishery and coastal biodiversity
are just some of the plant ’s worst social and environ-
mental impacts. DEADLY IMPACT

greenpeace   08Other impacts include:
• Loss of farming income: For generations, farmers
in Bo Nok have grown coconuts and pineapples,among other crops. Acid rain caused by the emis-sion of sulphur dioxode, and ash, could pollute theland and waterways contaminating their crops andlowering yields. This has been the experience offarmers near the Mae Moh plant in northernThailand, where sulfur dioxide releases have dam-aged rice fields, according to the Thai greengroup, Terra.
• Damage to nearby wetlands: The project poses a
threat to nearby Sam Roi Yot National Park, a wet-land park that is home to more than 200 species.
30
The Park has been nominated as a wetland of inter-national importance under the Ramsar Convention,a global environmental treaty dealing with wetlandpreservation. The Environmental Impact Assessmentconceded that sulphur dioxide from the plant willdrift over the wetlands, which scientists say couldharm the wetlands and erode the coastal limestonecliffs in the Sam Roi Yot National Park.   
• Threats to human health: When asked why they
doubt the company ’s safety claims, opponents of
the plant frequently point to the case of Mae Moh,a lignite-fired plant in Northern Thailand, whichhas released high levels of sulphur dioxide andcaused 42,000 local people to suffer from breathingproblems.
31This is why coal power plants are effec-
tively outlawed in California, the homestate of theproponent, Edison International 
(see p 12) .• Climate Change: Scientists, politicians and business
leaders around the world acknowledge thathumanity is causing global warming. Continuedglobal warming will cause the melting of glaciersand the polar ice caps, rising oceans, droughts,massive flooding, coral bleaching and an increasein storm activity. Coal is the largest contributor ofcarbon dioxide of any of the major forms of elec-tricity generation, and the single largest source ofglobal warming gases. 
As a result of these impacts, the costs for which are
not “internalized ” to the price paid for electricity by
consumers but ultimately borne by the public, coal issignificantly more expensive than power from naturalgas or biomass, two other options in Thailand. Oncethe true cost of these “externalities ”—the public
health impacts, lower agricultural productivity andother impacts from pollution —are included, coal is a
very expensive energy option. Wind power world-wide is competitive with coal even without thesecosts being internalized to the price.
The good news is that thanks to new, cleaner, renew-
able technologies, these coal plants are not even neces-sary. In Southeast Asia, Greenpeace is actively promot-ing policies and projects that favor energy generatedby wind, solar technology and biomass-based power,the potential for which in Thailand is huge. A separatereport on the clean energy now available to Thailandhas been published by Greenpeace and is availablefrom the website http://www.cleanenergynow.orgCOAL’S COST

09edison outAs the Thai government decides whether or not to
approve the stalled power plants, the PrimeMinister ’s office has ordered the state energy author-
ity to investigate the power contracts with Edisonand its partners, which one top official called “unjus-
tified and suspicious ”.
32
At issue are three amendments to the Edison plant ’s
contract, which critics say put the Government at a dis-advantage. Chaturon Chaisaeng, the Prime Minister ’s
appointee in charge of energy policy, said he believedchanges to the terms had been made in the 1990s thatunduly favored the companies. Canceling the contractswas therefore among the options, he said. 
“The contracts, at a preliminary glance, seem unfair
to the government as it has to take all responsibilitieseven though errors have been made by the privatesector, ” Mr Chaturon said.
33
Two of the three amendments increased the “avail-
ability payments ”—money transferred to power gen-
erators in exchange for making their generationcapacity available, independently of whether energyis actually provided or not.The National Energy Policy Office has claimed that
canceling the two contracts will result in a hefty fineof more than 10 million baht. These costs, the gov-ernment claims, will be passed on to electricityratepayers.
34
But Witoon Permpongsacharoen, from the Project forEcological Recovery, said at a recent public debatethat the government would be within its rights toscrap the projects without paying any compensation.There are many factors it could cite in annulling thecontracts with the company, such as the 1997 eco-nomic crisis or the fact that the company has failedto demonstrate its financial readiness to implementconstruction, he said.
35
Even if it is forced to pay the penalty, critics say, thatmight be cheaper than allowing the plants to pro-ceed. According to an analysis by the Thai groupAEPS, due to the “take-or-pay ” nature of the power
purchase agreements, consumers will have to pay forthe Edison group ’s power whether it is needed or
not. In addition, the government will save millions ofbaht required to build transmission facilities to trans-port the power to Bangkok. And given the potential-ly exorbitant social and environmental costs, 10 mil-lion baht may be a small price to pay.
36SWEETHEART DEALS
Edison and their partners have spent thousands on ads in Thai newspapers to greenwash theirproposed coal power plants. These ones outline the supposed benefits of "clean coal".

greenpeace   10As if standing up to their own government and a major developer
weren ’t enough, the Thai opponents of the Bo Nok power plant may
have a third obstacle to overcome: pressure from the U.S. government. 
On September 1999, the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Richard
Hecklinger met with Savit Bhotiwihok, the then Minister of the PrimeMinister ’s office in charge of energy policy of the country. In an inter-
view after the meeting with a Thai newpaper, The Nation, the PrimeMinister said Hecklinger described the United States government as“particularly concerned ” by delays in the Bo Nok project. Hecklinger
implied that the repercussions for Thailand could extend to other U.S.investment, according to Savit ’s interview with The Nation newspaper:
“The ambassador was also quoted as saying that while Thailand has the
potential to become a centre for economic activity, problems and delaysas in the Bo Nok project could erode the potential for investment. Thedelay in the public-hearing process could, he said, become an obstacle inthe way of future investment. ”
Hecklinger ’s comments outraged grassroots groups, who charged the
Ambassador with interfering in the country ’s internal affairs. A leading
academic, Danai Kimpadanai, said: “This is pressure on the Thai govern-
ment to approve the project ’s construction. ”
37
The U.S. embassy responded to the criticism by saying it “has a duty 
to advocate U.S. business in the same way Thai embassies do in
other countries. ”38The Edison Consortium
had attempted tosecure U.S. taxpayerfinancing for the BoNok plant. The Export-Import Bank of theUnited States —a tax-
payer funded govern-ment agency devoted tocorporate welfare —had
been in discussions withthe proponents aboutfunding the Bo Nokproject. But in the faceof pressure from Thaiactivists and the U.S.environmental groupFriends of the Earth, theExIm Bank claimed inspring 1999 that it hadofficially withdrawn theproject for funding con-sideration.

11edison outDEAR SHAREHOLDERS*
Dear Shareholders*
As you know, the past few years have been difficult for our company. California ’s power
crisis pushed our utility, Southern California Edison, to the brink of bankruptcy.However, through a three-pronged strategy of creative accounting, blackout threats,and political juice, we succeeded in protecting the assets of our parent company whilegetting our ratepayers to bail out SCE. Here ’s a little of the history to remind you:
The California deregulation law required us to sell off most of our power plants in the
state. But that was OK, for several reasons. First, we were able to sell them at abovebook value to deregulated companies. The law also forced taxpayers to bail us out forour bad nuclear investments. Meanwhile, we shifted billions from the utility to our par-ent company, to fund dividends and stock repurchases. We then went on a global shop-ping spree, snatching up old, polluting power plants throughout the world. The valueproposition from all this change is that we no longer have to deal with California ’s
annoying environmental laws. Now, most of the power we produce around the world isfrom coal, something we could never have gotten away with in the Golden State. 
In 2000 the California power crisis hit. Wholesale power rates skyrocketed, and our utili-
ty started running up big debts. Some suggested that our parent company —which had
siphoned off all the utility ’s profits —should help pay those bills. Instead, we jacked up
rates by 40 percent. Then, we found a loophole in the law that allowed EdisonInternational to say, for the purposes of paying off debts, that we had never heard ofSouthern California Edison, or even Southern California for that matter. Check out ourcool website disclaimer on this very subject at www.edison.com!
We figured that if we turned the lights out often enough, the state would bail out the
utility. There was the little problem that, despite our friend Governor Davis ’ efforts, the
California legislature refused to pay off our debts. So we had to bring in our lawyersand lobbyists to meet secretly with the state regulators, arranging a lucrative bailoutthat sticks our customers with the bill. This type of corporate strategy is what makes usan innovative leader in the industry as we move back to the future with coal worldwide. 
Environmentalists have recently criticized some of our investment decisions. They ask,
why are we building a coal-fired plant smack dab on a beach in a tranquil Thai fishingvillage, something we could never get away with in California? Answer: Because we can!
Make no mistake —Edison ’s environmental commitment remains as strong as ever; we
spend millions of dollars every year crafting and communicating a green image. Andthose who doubt our commitment to the environment should talk to our CEO JohnBryson, one of the founders of the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
As long as we continue to pursue this strategy —gouging our consumers in California
and foisting polluting power plants on developing countries —we believe that Edison
International will have a bright and powerful future. 
* Although this is not Edison ’s real letter to its shareholders we think it should be.

greenpeace   12Myth #1: 
Unless the Plants Are Built, Thailand Will Run Out of Power
When the two coal-fired power plants slated for Prachuap
Khiri Khan were first approved, the Thai economy was ridinghigh and power use was projected to skyrocket. But with thedevaluation of the Thai currency, the baht, in 1997 the coun-try’s economy went into a tailspin and has been in the dol-
drums ever since.  Now, critics are questioning whether itnow needs the additional power from the plants at all.
The National Energy Policy Office maintains that the coun-
try’s reserve margin would drop to precarious levels if the
plants are cancelled. But others contend that NEPO ’s
demand forecasts are overly optimistic: In 1997, the state ’s
“electricity load forecast panel ” used an economic growth
figure of 4.7% to predict energy demand and power plantinvestment for the following five years. In reality, economicgrowth has not exceeded 2%.
40
Myth #2: 
Coal is the Cheapest Alternative 
When you add the environmental and social costs into the
equation, coal suddenly becomes much more expensive.Even if Thailand ’s environmental laws are properly
enforced, a coal-fired plant still emits more sulfur-dioxode,nitrous-oxide, carbon-dioxide, particulates and heavy met-als than other types of power plants.
41These pollutants
have damaging health and environmental effects. Powerfrom a renewable technology like biomass is actually abouta third cheaper than that from coal once social and envi-ronmental costs are taken into account (see page 8 forinternalization of costs). 
Myth #3:
The Plants will use high quality “Clean Coal ” 
The Edison consortium claims that it will use “clean coal ”
technology. “Clean ” or “Enviro-coal ” is a misnomer: even
the cleanest of these new technologies is still dirtier thannatural gas, for example. And studies show that even thebest “clean coal ” technology has minimal effect on green-
house gas emissions. Also, dangerous levels of air andwater pollution have been recorded in areas burning so-called clean coal. And whether the coal is low in sulfur ornot, coal mining often involves human rights violations. 
The low sulfur coal for Bo Nok will be supplied by
Indonesia ’s Adaro coal mine, which is partly owned by
Edison. PT Adaro, located in the province of SouthKalimantan, has come under protest since it opened bylocal residents who say dredging in the area had createddust problems and polluted water supplies. In September1999, human rights and environmental activists inIndonesia called for a halt to all coal mining in the provinceat a protest rally outside their governor ’s office and the
local assembly. They said coal mining brought suffering tolocal people and destroyed the environment.
42Myth #4:
Edison Could Build the Same Plant in California 
The Edison group insists that the Bo Nok plant will employ
the latest technology, minimizing its impacts on the envi-ronment. In response to questions from environmentalistsand government officials, President Robert Driscoll, EdisonMission Energy senior vice president for Asia Pacific Region,has said that Bo Nok would use the same technology evenif it were built in southern California.
But could such a plant really be built on Edison ’s home turf?
No, according to Curtis Moore, energy expert and formercounsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment andPublic Works. He says the emissions from the proposed plantwould be many times above what would be allowed inCalifornia. For example, the Thai plant is expected to emitnitrogen oxides, which impacts lung function and can causeasthma attacks, at 170 parts per million. New Californiaplants would be limited to 2.5 parts per million. “There is no
doubt that the Thai plant greatly exceeds anything new orold that is retrofited in California, ” says Moore.
43
Thai environmental activist Ponglert Pongwanan accuses
Edison of using an unethical double standard. “Why, if they
can’t build it in the United States, are they allowed to build
it here in Thailand? ” he asks.
Myth #5: 
Coal Power Plants will create Local Benefits 
Companies argue that the construction of large-scale coal-
fired power plants will bring about increased employmentfor local community members and also positive income forthe local government from royalties and other proceedsfrom hosting power plants. These are rarely forthcoming, asthe experience with multinational owned coal plants in thePhilippines has shown. As far as employment goes, the proj-ect would indeed create some short-term construction jobs.But in the long run, coal is much less labor intensive thanrenewable energy technologies. A study, based on UnitedStates plants, found that both wind and photovoltaic plantsprovide 40% more employment than coal plants
