FOREWORD

The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Enterprise sees the photovoltaic industry
as a key high-technology sector and has been a major contributor to the creation of a European
Photovoltaic  Technology  Platform.  This  initiative  will  help  secure  the  innovation,  high
investment and strong collaboration between research and industry required by the sector and
also help take Europe closer to the Lisbon goal of becoming “the most competitive and dynamic
knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more
and better jobs and greater social cohesion”.

Climate change is a key challenge that needs to be tackled by competitive eco-technologies. The
European  Union  has  played  a  leading  role  in  defining  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  The  forthcoming
implementation  of  the  emissions  trading  instrument  will  pave  the  way  to  greater  use  of
renewable sources and to more rational use of energy. Photovoltaic technology, which converts
the  sun’s  energy  directly  into  electricity,  will  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  emissions  in  the
medium  to  long  term,  not  only  through  cleaner  projects  in  Europe,  but  also  in  developing
countries through the transfer of technology.

The sun provides more than 10,000 times the energy humanity consumes, meaning that there
are  few  limits  to  the  potential  of  photovoltaic  technologies.  For  the  last  five  years,  the
photovoltaic sector has experienced one of the highest growth rates worldwide (over 30% in
2003) and for the 20 next years, the average production growth rate is estimated to be between
27% and 34% annually. Currently the cost of electricity produced using photovoltaic technology
is above that for traditional energy sources, but this will fall with technological progress and
more efficient production processes.

This EPIA / Greenpeace blueprint traces possible future developments in the photovoltaic sector
over  the  coming  decades,  foreseeing  significant  benefits  for  the  environment,  but  also  for
society: the photovoltaic sector might employ more than 2 million people by 2020.

These  developments  will  only  occur  if  governments  and  the  public  at  large  welcome  this
technology.  I  am  convinced  this  publication  will  promote  this  process  and  look  forward  to
photovoltaic  technology  starting  to  play  the  role  it  deserves  in  establishing  sustainable
development for our benefit and that of future generations.

FOREWORD

This report demonstrates that there are no technical, economic or resource barriers to supplying
1.1%  of  the  world’s  electricity  needs  from  solar  power  alone  by  2020;  and  this  against  the
challenging  backdrop  of  a  projected  near  doubling  of  electricity  demand  by  that  date.  Solar
energy  is  a  success  story.  It  already  supplies  electricity  to  several  hundred  thousand  people,
provides  employment  for  over  10,000  people  and  generates  business  worth  more  than
¤ 3 billion annually

In the future, the pace of change and progress could be even more rapid as the solar industry
unlocks its hidden promise.

By  the  end  of  2003  more  than  2,400  Megawatts  (MW)  of  solar  photovoltaic  power  had  been
installed world wide, generating enough electricity to power more than 700,000 households
with an average European consumption. As outlined in the opening chapters, the success of the
industry to date has been largely created by the efforts of just three countries - Japan, Germany
and the USA. It is obvious that if other countries matched these efforts, the impact would be far
greater. This underlines the fact that today’s technology is merely the tip of the iceberg, and a
huge potential remains untapped. Solar power is capable of continuing its successful history
over the next two decades if a positive political and regulatory framework is implemented, one
that removes the obstacles and market distortions that currently constrain the industry’s real
potential.

The  benefits  of  solar  power  are  compelling:  environmental  protection,  economic  growth,  job
creation, secure and distributed generation, diversity of fuel supply and rapid deployment, as
well as the global potential for technology transfer and innovation. The underlying advantage
of solar energy is that the fuel is free, abundant and inexhaustible. The total amount of energy
from the sun that reaches the earth’s surface every year is enough to provide for annual global
energy  consumption  10,000  times  over.  Yet  these  benefits  remain  largely  untapped;  most
energy  decisions  taken  today  overlook  solar  power  as  a  modular  technology  which  can  be
rapidly  deployed  to  generate  electricity  close  to  the  point  of  consumption.  Phasing  in  solar
photovoltaics  therefore  requires  a  shift  from  centralised  to  decentralised  power  production,
allowing far greater control to individual consumers.

There is now a solid international consensus on the threat of dangerous climate change and
that business-as-usual in the energy sector is not an option any more; the world must move
into a clean energy economy. The rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels has already in 2004
propelled the price of crude oil above US$ 50 per barrel for the first time, and has demonstrated
that production of “cheap” fossil fuels can no longer grow as fast as demand. Economies that
have  not  prepared  themselves  for  diversification  of  their  energy  mix  will  particularly  be
affected  by  these  developments  in  world  oil  markets.  Solar  power  is  a  prime  choice  in
developing an affordable, feasible, global power source that is able to substitute for fossil fuels
in all climate zones around the world.

The European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA) and Greenpeace have produced this new
edition of Solar Generation in order to update our understanding of the contribution that solar
power can make to the world’s energy supply. The report is a practical blueprint to show that

4

solar power is capable of supplying electricity to more than 1 billion people within two decades,
even if we nearly double our overall electricity use in that time.

This clear industrial and political commitment to the expansion of the PV industry implies that
the current surge of activity in the solar electricity sector represents merely a foretaste of the
massive  transformation  and  expansion  that  this  sector  will  bear  witness  to  in  the  coming
decades.

This joint initiative adopted the title “Solar Generation” because it aims to define the role that
solar  electricity  will  play  in  the  lives  of  a  global  population  born  today  as  it  develops  into  a
major  energy  consumption  group  and  starts  to  enter  the  job  market.  The  aim  has  been  to
examine how solar electricity will be perceived from both a consumer and business point of
view within the time scale of a generation. The report highlights the triple benefits which solar
energy  offers  the  world  -  for  the  environment,  for  industry  and  for  economic  and  social
development.

The international conference “Renewables 2004” held in June 2004 in Bonn was a small but
important step towards an expansion of renewable energies world wide, responding to the call
of  the  Johannesburg  summit  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  and  to  keep  up  the
momentum generated by the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition. The European Union
has played an important role in this process, following the recommendation of a preparatory
regional conference to Renewables 2004 held in Berlin in January 2004 to:

“...urge  EU  institutions  to  start  a  political  process  of  setting  ambitious,  time  bound  targets  for
increasing the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption addressing the medium
(2020) and long term time frames in due time to the Renewables 2004 in Bonn. A target value of
at least 20% of gross inland energy consumption by 2020 for the EU is achievable.”

This number could be even higher if coupled with stronger energy efficiency policies. Targets
for  renewable  energy  act  as  a  powerful  catalyst  for  governments  to  develop  the  necessary
framework conditions for investments in renewable energy technologies. A powerful example
is the EU Directive on the Promotion of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources, which sets
national indicative targets for all EU Member States. The targets have initiated political actions
throughout  the  entire  European  Union  to  put  in  place  framework  conditions  for  renewable
energies. Targets are an important first step in developing the clean energy sources of tomorrow
that will contribute substantially to climate protection, but they must be followed by concrete
political action.

Reports are a useful guide, but it is people who change the world by their actions. We encourage
politicians and policymakers, global citizens, energy officials, companies, investors and other
interested parties to support solar power by taking concrete steps which will help ensure that
more  than  a  billion  people  will  get  electricity  from  the  sun,  harnessing  the  full  potential  of
solar power for our common good.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

GLOBAL STATUS OF SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAICS

The  solar  electricity  market  is  booming.  In  the  year  2003  the
cumulative installed capacity of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems
around  the  world  passed  the  landmark  figure  of  2,400  MWp.
Global shipments of PV cells and modules have been growing at
an  average  annual  rate  of  more  than  35%  for  the  past  few
years.

Such has been the growth in the solar electricity industry that it
is now worth more than an annual ¤ 3 billion.

Competition  among  the  major  manufacturers  has  become
increasingly intense, with new players entering the market as
the  potential  for  PV  opens  up.  The  world  wide  photovoltaics
industry, particularly in Europe and Japan, is investing heavily
in new production facilities and technologies. At the same time,
political support for the development of solar electricity has led
to far-reaching promotion frameworks being put in place in a
number of countries, notably Germany and Japan.

Since the first edition of Solar Generation was produced in 2001,
the  global  market  has  continued  to  expand  at  the  rate  then
predicted.  While  some  countries,  such  as  the  United  States,
have lagged behind their expected development, others such as
Germany have exceeded expectations. There is also evidence of
new enthusiasm for solar power in some of its most promising
potential world markets, such as China.

This  clear  commercial  and  political  commitment  to  the
expansion of the PV industry means that the current surge of
activity  in  the  solar  electricity  sector  represents  merely  a
foretaste  of  the  massive  transformation  and  expansion
expected  to  occur  over  the  coming  decades.  The  target:
realisation  of  a  common  goal  of  substantially  increasing  the
penetration of solar electricity into the global energy mix while
also cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

Much work still needs to be done to turn potential into reality.
One crucial step is to bring a far broader range of actors into the
sector,  particularly  in  the  investment  finance,  marketing  and
retailing areas. At the same time, there is a need to transmit to

as  wide  an  audience  as  possible  the  message  that  solar
industrial  and
electricity  will  bring
environmental benefits to regions which proactively encourage
its uptake.

SOLAR GENERATION:
A PROJECTION TO 2020

Numerous analyses about the potential market development of
solar  photovoltaics  have  been  published  in  the  past.  The  aim
here  has  been  to  compile  a  detailed  quantitative  knowledge
base,  coupled  with  clearly  defined  and  realistic  assumptions
from  which  extrapolations  could  be  made  on  the  likely
development  of  the  solar  electricity  market  up  to  2020  and
beyond.  The  results  which  have  emerged  from  this  extensive
analysis point to a technology that will make a major impact on
the everyday adult lives of the population born today.

Clearly,  this  transformation  will  not  happen  by  itself.  It  will
require  the  far  reaching  commitment  of  both  consumers  and
industry,  as  well  as  significant  political  will.  The  level  of
commitment needed, however, has already been demonstrated
in  those  countries  which  show  the  greatest  growth  in  their
solar  electricity  industries.  We  must  learn  from  those  lessons
and adapt and deploy the corresponding catalysts on a global
level if solar electricity is to play a major role in the lives of the
next generation.

SOLAR GENERATION:
METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS

Taking  its  lead  from  success  stories  like  those  in  Japan  and
Germany,  this  EPIA/Greenpeace  report  looks  forward  to  what
solar power could achieve - given the right market conditions
and an anticipated fall in costs - over the first two decades of
the  twenty  first  century.  As  well  as  projections  for  installed
capacity and energy output it makes assessments of the level of
investment  required,  the  number  of  jobs  which  would  be
created  and  the  crucial  effect  which  an  increased  input  from
solar electricity will have on greenhouse gas emissions.

This  scenario  for  the  year  2020,  together  with  an  extended
projection  forwards  to  2040,  is  based  on  the  following  core
inputs.

SOLAR GENERATION:
PV’S CONTRIBUTION TO GLOBAL ELECTRICITY SUPPLY

The EPIA/Greenpeace scenario shows that by the year 2020, PV
systems  could  be  generating  approximately  282  TWh  of
electricity  around  the  world.  This  means  that  enough  solar
power  would  be  produced  globally  in  twenty  years’  time  to
satisfy  the  electricity  needs  of  10%  of  the  entire  EU-25  (2003
figure).  Put  another  way,  this  would  represent  the  annual
output from 76 coal-fired power plants.

in

Global  installed  capacity  of  solar  power  systems  would  reach
205  GWp  by  2020.  About  half  of  this  would  be  in  the  grid-
connected  market,  mainly
industrialised  countries.
Assuming that 80% of these systems are installed on residential
buildings, and their average size is 3 kWp, the total number of
people  by  then  generating  their  own  electricity  from  a  grid-
connected solar system would reach 93 million. In Europe alone
there would be roughly 31 million people receiving their supply
from solar electricity generation.

Although  the  key  markets  are  located  now  mainly  in  the
industrialised  world,  a  global  shift  will  result  in  a  significant
share - 30 GWp - being taken by the developing world in 2020.

The following assumptions have been employed:
Market  growth  rates:  The  average  annual  growth  rate  of  the
worldwide  PV  market  up  to  2009  is  projected  to  be  27%,  then
rising to 34% between 2010 and 2020. Although initial growth
is  expected  to  be  fastest  in  the  grid-connected  sector,  by  2010
the off-grid sector will play a steadily increasing role.

Electricity  generation:  Figures  for  the  growth  in  global
electricity  demand  up  to  2020  (on  which  comparisons  with
expected PV development are based) are taken from projections
by  the  International  Energy  Agency.  These  show  total  world
power  demand  increasing  to  25,578  Terawatt  hours  (TWh)  by
2020.

Carbon  dioxide  savings:  Over  the  whole  scenario  period  it  is
estimated that an average of 0.6 kg of COc would be saved per
kilowatt-hour of output from a solar generator.

Projection  to  2040:  For  the  period  2020-2040  a  moderate
annual growth rate of 15% has been assumed, as well as a very
conservative lifetime of 25 years for PV modules.

The  scenario  is  also  divided  in  two  ways  -  into  the  four  main
global market divisions (consumer applications, grid-connected,
remote industrial and off-grid rural), and into the regions of the
world  as  defined  in  projections  of  future  electricity  demand
made  by  the  International  Energy  Agency.  These  regions  are
OECD Europe, OECD Pacific, OECD North America, Latin America,
East Asia, South Asia, China, the Middle East, Africa and the Rest
of the World.

SOLAR GENERATION:
KEY RESULTS OF THE EPIA/GREENPEACE ANALYSIS

The  key  results  of  the  EPIA/Greenpeace  scenario  clearly  show
that,  even  from  a  relatively  low  baseline,  solar  electricity  has
the  potential  to  make  a  major  contribution  to  both  future
global electricity supply and the mitigation of climate change.

achieving  greater  penetration  of  solar  electricity  into  the
energy mix at local, national, regional and global levels.

A number of key political actions are required:

•

•

•

 Firstly, an annual world PV market growth of 3.7 GWp+ by 2010
will  only  be  achieved  through  the  extension  of  best  practice
support schemes, appropriately adapted to local circumstances,
to encourage the uptake of solar electricity amongst consumers.
The  German  and  Japanese  experiences  highlight  the  impact
which  such  actions  can  have  on  the  global  photovoltaics
industry.
 Secondly,  the  inherent  barriers  to  the  take-up  of  solar  power  -
and  the  subsidies  available  to  fossil  and  nuclear  fuels  which
currently penalise renewable sources - must be removed.
 Thirdly,  a  variety  of  legally  enforced  mechanisms  must  be
implemented  which  secure  and  accelerate  the  new  market  for
solar  photovoltaics.  Particularly  in  industrialised  and  emerging
economies,  the  introduction  or  expansion  of  premium  feed-in
tariffs  with  guaranteed  lifetimes  must  be  a  cornerstone  of  all
future promotion mechanisms for solar electricity.

Our  goal  now  must  be  to  mobilise  the  necessary  industrial,
political  and  end-user  commitment  to  this  technology  and,
more importantly, the service it provides. We must redouble our
efforts to ensure that the generation born today benefits from
all  the  socio-economic  and  environmental  benefits  that  solar
electricity offers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Since system sizes are much smaller and the population density
greater,  this  means  that  up  to  a  billion  people  in  developing
countries would by then be using solar electricity. This would
represent  a  major  breakthrough  for  the  technology  from  its
present emerging status.

By  2040,  the  penetration  of  solar  generation  would  be  even
greater. Assuming that overall global power consumption had
by  then  increased  from  25,578  to  36,000  TWh,  the  solar
contribution would equal 21% of the world’s electricity output.
This  would  place  solar  power  firmly  on  the  map  as  an
established energy source.

SOLAR GENERATION:
PV’S CONTRIBUTION TO INDUSTRY, EMPLOYMENT
AND THE ENVIRONMENT

For the solar production industry, global annual shipments of
PV  modules  will  rise  from  750  MWp  in  2003  to  more  than
48,000 MWp in 2020. This represents an increase by a factor of
64.

For the job seekers of the 2020 generation, this would represent
a major contribution towards their employment prospects. On
the  assumption  that  more  jobs  are  created  in  the  installation
and  servicing  of  PV  systems  than  in  their  manufacture,  the
result  is  that  by  2020,  more  than  2.25  million  full  time  jobs
would  have  been  created  by  the  development  of  solar  power
around the world. The majority of those would be in installation
and marketing.

By  2020  solar  PV  would  also  have  had  one  other  important
effect. In environmental terms, it would have reduced annual
COc  emissions  by  169  million  tonnes.  This  reduction  is
equivalent  to  the  emissions  from  all  45  million  cars  currently
operating in Germany, or 76 coal-fired power plants. Cumulative
COc savings from solar electricity generation between 2003 and
2020 will have reached a level of more than 730 million tonnes.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

In order to supply up to a billion people with solar electricity by
the year 2020, and go on to achieve a global electricity share of
21%  by  2040,  a  major  shift  in  energy  policy  will  be  needed.
Experience  over  the  past  few  years  has  demonstrated  the
effectiveness  of  joint  industrial  and  political  commitment  to

THE SOLAR POTENTIAL

There is more than sufficient solar radiation available around
the world to satisfy a vastly increased demand for solar power
systems.  The  proportion  of  the  sun’s  rays  which  reaches  the
earth’s  surface  is  enough  to  provide  for  global  energy
consumption 10,000 times over. On average, each square metre
of land is exposed to enough sunlight to produce 1,700 kWh of
power every year.

The statistical information base for the solar energy resource is
equally  solid.  The  US  National  Solar  Radiation  database,  for
example,  has
logged  30  years  of  solar  radiation  and
supplementary meteorological data from 237 sites in the USA.

The greater the available solar resource at a given location the
larger  the  quantity  of  electricity  generated.  Tropical  regions
offer  a  better  resource  than  more  temperate  latitudes.  The
average  irradiation  in  Europe  is  about  1,000  kWh  per  square
metre,  for  example,  compared  with  1,800  kWh  in  the  Middle
East.

Figure  1.2  shows  the  estimated  potential  energy  output  from
solar  PV  generators  in  different  parts  of  the  world.  The
calculation used here takes into account the average efficiency
of  modules  and  converters  as  well  as  the  correct  angle  to  the
sun required at different latitudes.

WHAT IS PHOTOVOLTAIC ENERGY?

The word “photovoltaic” is a marriage of two words - “photo”,
meaning
light,  and  “voltaic”,  meaning  electricity.  So
photovoltaic  technology,  the  scientific  term  used  to  describe
solar energy, involves the generation of electricity from light.

The secret to this process is the use of a semi-conductor material
which  can  be  adapted  to  release  electrons,  the  negatively
charged particles which form the basis of electricity. The most
common  semi-conductor  material  used  in  photovoltaic  (PV)
cells is silicon, an element most commonly found in sand.

All  PV  cells  have  at  least  two  layers  of  such  semi-conductors,
one positively charged and one negatively charged. When light
shines  on  the  semi-conductor,  the  electric  field  across  the
junction  between  these  two  layers  causes  electricity  to  flow,
generating DC current. The greater the intensity of the light, the
greater the flow of electricity.

A photovoltaic system does not therefore need bright sunlight
in order to operate. It also generates electricity on cloudy days,
with  its  energy  output  proportionate  to  the  density  of  the
clouds. Due to the reflection of sunlight, days with only a few
clouds can even result in higher energy yields than days with a
completely blue sky.

Solar PV is quite different from a solar thermal system, where
the sun’s rays are used to generate heat, usually for hot water in
a house, swimming pool etc.

The Advantages of Solar Power
•
•
•
•
•

 The fuel is free
 No moving parts to wear out or break down
 Minimal maintenance required to keep the system running
 Modular systems can be quickly installed anywhere
 Produces no noise, harmful emissions or polluting gases

In terms of final demand, the report “Solar Electricity in 2010”
(European Photovoltaic Industry Association, 2001) shows that
the  market  segment  grid-connected  PV  rooftop  systems,  the
most dynamic growth area in the market, has the potential to
generate  an  average  of  16%  of  electricity  consumption  across
the OECD (industrialised) countries. This is about the same as
today’s contribution from hydro power.

PV Technology
The  most  important  parts  of  a  PV  system  are  the  cells  which
form  the  basic  building  blocks,  the  modules  which  bring
together  large  numbers  of  cells  into  a  unit,  and,  in  some
situations,  the  inverters  used  to  convert  the  electricity
generated into a form suitable for everyday use.

PV Cells and Modules
PV  cells  are  generally  made  either  from  crystalline  silicon,
sliced  from  ingots  or  castings  or  from  grown  ribbons,  or  thin
film,  deposited  in  thin  layers  on  a  low  cost  backing.  The
majority of module production (89% in 2003) has so far involved
the former, while future plans will also have a strong focus on
the  latter.  Thin  film  technology  based  on  silicon  and  other
materials  is  expected  to  gain  a  by  far  larger  share  of  the  PV
market in the future. This technology offers several advantages
such  as  low  material  consumption,  low  weight  and  a  smooth
visual appearance.

Crystalline silicon
Crystalline silicon is still the mainstay of most power modules.
Although in some technical parameters not the ideal material
for solar cells, it has the benefit of being widely available, well
understood  and  uses  the  same  technology  developed  for  the
electronics  industry.  Efficiencies  of  more  than  20%  have  been
obtained  with  silicon  cells  in  the  laboratory,  but  production
cells  are  currently  averaging  13-17%  efficiency.  The  theoretical
limit for crystalline modules approaches 30%.

Thin film
Thin  film  modules  are  constructed  by  depositing  extremely
thin  layers  of  photosensitive  materials  on  a  low  cost  backing
such  as  glass,  stainless  steel  or  plastic.  This  results  in  lower
production  costs  compared  to  the  more  material  intensive
crystalline technology. This price advantage is counter balanced
at the moment, however, by substantially lower efficiency rates
and less experience of the modules’ lifetime performance.

Three types of thin film modules are commercially available at
the moment. These are manufactured from amorphous silicon
(a-Si),  copper  indium  diselenide  (CIS,  CIGS)  and  cadmium
telluride (CdTe). All of these have active layers in the thickness
range of less than a few microns. This approach allows higher
automation once a certain production volume is reached, while
they all use an integrated approach to the module architecture.
This  is  less  labour  intensive  compared  to  the  assembly  of
crystalline modules by interconnecting a number of individual
cells.  At  approximately  6%  in  2003,  the  market  share  of  thin
film  technology  is  still  fairly  low,  but  can  be  expected  to
increase in the future.

Figure 1.3: Market shares of different cell technologies
sold in 2003 (installed capacity)

mono c-Si
33,2%

ribbon-/sheet
c-Si 4,3%

CIS 0,7%

a-Si 4,5%
CdTe 1%

poly c-Si 56,3%

Amongst  these  three  commercially  available  thin  film
technologies, a-Si is the most important in terms of production
and installation (4.5% of the total market in 2003).

Multicrystalline  thin  film  on  glass  (CSG)  is  a  promising  thin
film technology under development, but not yet available on a
commercial  scale.  Microcrystalline  technology,  in  particular
the  combination  of  amorphous  silicon  and  microcrystalline
silicon (a-Si/µ-Si) is another approach with encouraging results.
The  efficiency  world  record  for  cells  with  this  technology  is
currently  14.7%,  while  modules  are  already  commercially
available  with  an  efficiency  of  10%  stabilized.  The  aim  is  to
increase this level to 12% in 2005.

Other cell types
Concentrator  cells  focus  light  from  a  large  area  onto  a  small
area  of  photovoltaic  material  using  an  optical  concentrator
(such  as  a  Fresnel  lens),  thus  minimising  the  quantity  of  PV
cells  required.  The  two  main  drawbacks  with  concentrator
systems are that they cannot make use of diffuse sunlight and
must  always  be  directed  towards  the  sun  with  a  tracking
system.

Spheral solar technology uses minute silicon beads bonded to
an  aluminium  foil  matrix.  This  offers  a  big  cost  advantage
because of the reduced requirement for silicon. Two companies,
from  Canada  and  Japan,  are  planning  to  commercialise
modules  with  spheral  solar  cells,  with  one  of  them  already
predicting  a  module  efficiency  of  11%.  This  represents  an
excellent  example  of  the  rapid  technical  progress
in
photovoltaics.  When  the  first  edition  of  Solar  Generation  was
published  in  2001,  the  development  of  spheral  cells  was  not
even  at  a  stage  that  allowed  a  detailed  prediction  of  its
commercial availability.

Modules
Modules are clusters of PV cells incorporated into a unit, usually
by soldering them together under a sheet of glass. They can be
adapted in size to the proposed site, and quickly installed. They

In  countries  with  a  premium  feed-in  tariff,  which
is
considerably higher that the usual tariff paid by the customer
to  the  utility,  usually  all  electricity  produced  is  fed  into  the
public  grid  and  sold  to  the  utility.  This  is  the  situation  in
countries such as Germany or Spain.

Grid Support
A  system  can  be  connected  to  the  local  electricity  network  as
well as a back-up battery. Any excess solar electricity produced
after the battery has been charged is then sold to the network.
Ideal for use in areas of unreliable power supply.

Off-Grid
Completely independent of the grid, the system is connected to
a  battery  via  a  charge  controller,  which  stores  the  electricity
generated and acts as the main power supply. An inverter can
be  used  to  provide  AC  power,  enabling  the  use  of  normal
appliances without mains power. Typical off-grid applications
are industrial applications such as repeater stations for mobile
phones  or  rural  electrification.  Rural  electrification  means
either small solar home systems (SHS) covering basic electricity
needs  or  solar  mini  grids,  which  are  larger  solar  electricity
systems providing electricity for several households.

Hybrid System
A solar system can be combined with another source of power
-  a  biomass  generator,  a  wind  turbine  or  diesel  generator  -  to
ensure a consistent supply of electricity. A hybrid system can be
grid connected, stand alone or grid support.

THE BENEFITS OF SOLAR POWER

Photovoltaic power systems offer many unique benefits above
and  beyond  simple  energy  delivery.  That  is  why  comparisons
with conventional electricity generation - and more particularly
comparison  with  the  unit  energy  costs  of  conventional
generation  -  are  not  always  valid.  If  the  amenity  value  of  the
energy service that PV provides, or other non-energy benefits,
could  be  appropriately  costed,  it  is  clear  that  the  overall
economics of PV generation would be dramatically improved in
numerous  applications,  even
in  some  grid-connection
situations.

PART ONE: SOLAR BASICS

are  also  robust,  reliable  and  weatherproof.  Module  producers
usually guarantee their performance for 20-25 years.

When  a  PV  installation  is  described  as  having  a  capacity  of  3
kWp(eak), this refers to the output of the system under standard
(STC),  allowing  comparison  between
testing  conditions
different  modules.  In  central  Europe  a  3  kWp  rated  solar
electricity  system,  with  a  module  area  of  approximately  27
square  metres,  would  produce  enough  power  to  meet  the
electricity demand of an energy conscious household.

Inverters
Inverters  are  used  to  convert  the  direct  current  (DC)  power
generated  by  a  PV  generator  into  alternating  current  (AC)
which  is  compatible  with  the  local  electricity  distribution
network.  This  is  essential  for  grid-connected  PV  systems.
Inverters are offered in a wide range of power classes, from a
few hundred Watts through the most frequently used range of
several  kWp  (3-6  kWp)  up  to  central  inverters  for  large  scale
systems with 100 kWp and above.

Components for Stand-alone PV Systems
Stand-alone (off-grid) PV systems contain a battery, still today
frequently of the lead acid type, in order to store the energy for
future use. New high quality batteries designed especially for
solar  applications,  with  life  times  of  up  to  15  years,  are  now
available. However the lifetime of the battery strongly depends
on  the  battery  management  and  the  user  behaviour.  The
battery is connected to the PV array via a charge controller. The
charge  controller  protects  the  battery  from  over  charge  or
discharge, and can also provide information about the state of
the  system  or  enable  metering  and  pre-payment  for  the
electricity used. If AC output is needed, an inverter is required
to convert the DC power from the array.

TYPES OF PV SYSTEM

Grid Connected
The  most  popular  type  of  solar  PV  system  for  homes  and
businesses  in  the  developed  world.  Connection  to  the  local
electricity network allows any excess power produced to be sold
to  the  utility.  Electricity  is  then  imported  from  the  network
outside  daylight  hours.  An  inverter  is  used  to  convert  the  DC
power produced by the system to AC power for running normal
electrical equipment.

Climate Change and Fuel Choices
Carbon dioxide is responsible for more than 50% of the man-made
greenhouse  effect,  making  it  the  most  important  contributor  to
climate change. It is produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels.
Natural gas is the most environmentally sound of the fossil fuels
because  it  produces  roughly  half  the  quantity  of  carbon  dioxide
and  less  of  other  polluting  gases  than  coal.  Nuclear  power
produces  very  little  COc,  but  has  other  major  safety,  security,
proliferation and pollution problems associated with its operation
and waste products.
The  consequences  of  climate  change  already  apparent  today
include:
•

 The  proportion  of  COc  in  the  atmosphere  has  risen  by  about
one third since industrialisation began.
 The  number  of  natural  disasters  has  trebled  since  the  1960s.
According  to  insurance  company  Munich  Re  the  resulting
economic damage has increased by a factor of nine.
 The eight warmest years over the last 130 were recorded during
the past 11.
 The  mass  of
industrialisation began.

 Rainfall in temperate and northern latitudes has increased by

 According  to  a  UN  study,  the  economic  damage  of  climate
change will reach an annual figure of $ 300 billion by 2050.
 Sea levels have risen by 10-20 centimetres in the last 100 years,
9-12 cm of this in the last fifty.
 According  to  a  WHO  study,  as  many  as  160,000  people  are
already dying each year as a result of climate change.
 According  to  a  study  published  in  Nature  (January  2004),  a
mid-range  level  of  warming  could  result  in  the  extinction  of
1,000,000 terrestrial species by the middle of this century.

Because of the time lapse between emissions and their effects, the
full consequences of the climate change to which we have already
committed  the  planet  have  still  to  emerge  over  the  coming
decades, bringing increased danger to the stability of the world’s
economy and lifestyle. To effectively stem  the greenhouse effect,
emissions  of  COc  must  therefore  be  greatly  reduced.  Scientists
believe that only a quarter of the fossil energy reserves which can
be  developed  commercially  today  ought  to  be  allowed  to  be
burned if ecosystems are not to go beyond the point at which they
are able to adapt.

Space-saving installation
PV  is  a  simple,  low  risk  technology  which  can  be  installed
virtually anywhere there is available light. This means there is
a huge potential for the use of roofs or facades on public, private
and industrial buildings. PV modules can be used as part of a
building’s  envelope,  providing  protection  from  wind  and  rain
or  serving  to  shade  the  interior.  During  their  operation  such
systems can also help reduce buildings’ heating loads or assist
in ventilation through convection.

Improving the electricity network
For power companies and their customers, PV has the advantage
of providing relatively quick and modular deployment. This can
offset  investment  in  major  new  plant  and  help  to  strengthen
the  electricity  network,  particularly  at  the  end  of  the
distribution line. Since power is generated close to the point of
use,  such  distributed  generators  reduce  transmission  losses,
can  improve  service  reliability  for  customers  and  help  limit
maximum demand.

Other places where PV can be installed include the sound bar-
riers along communication links such as motorways. To satisfy
a significant part of the electricity needs of the industrialised
world there is therefore no need to exploit otherwise undistur-
bed areas.

Protecting the environment
Solar  power  involves  none  of  the  polluting  emissions  or
environmental  safety  concerns  associated  with  conventional
generation  technologies.  There  is  no  pollution  in  the  form  of
exhaust fumes or noise during operation. Decommissioning a
system is unproblematic.

Most importantly, in terms of the wider environment, there are
no emissions of carbon dioxide - the main gas responsible for
global  climate  change  (see  paragraph  “Climate  Change  and
Fuel Choices”) - during the operation of a PV system. Although
indirect emissions of COc occur at other stages of the life-cycle,
these are significantly lower than the avoided emissions. Solar
power can therefore make a substantial contribution towards
international commitments to reduce emissions of greenhouse
gases and their contribution to climate change (see paragraph
“The Climate Change Imperative”).

Enabling economic development
PV  offers  important  social  benefits  in  terms  of  job  creation,
energy  independence  and  rural  development.  Significantly,
much  of  the  employment  creation  is  at  the  installation  point
(installers  and  service  engineers),  giving  a  boost  to  local
economies.

PART ONE: SOLAR BASICS

The Climate Change Imperative
The  growing  threat  of  global  climate  change  resulting  from  the
build-up of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere has forced
national  and  international  bodies  into  action.  Starting  from  the
Rio Earth Summit in 1992 a series of targets have been set both for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the take-up of
renewable energy, including solar power. Ten years later, however,
the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg
still  failed  to  agree  on  legally  binding  targets  for  renewables,
prompting  the  setting  up  of  a  “coalition  of  the  willing”.  The
European Union and more than a dozen nations from around the
world expressed their disappointment with the Summit’s inaction
by  issuing  a  joint  statement  called  “The  Way  Forward  on
Renewable Energy”. Later renamed the Johannesburg Renewable
Energy Coalition, more than 85 countries had joined by the time of
the Renewables 2004 conference in Bonn.
The  1997  Kyoto  Protocol,  now  ratified  by  124  nations,  has
meanwhile  committed  the  world’s  industrialised  countries  to
reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5%

from  their  1990  level.  Kyoto  will  not  come  into  force  unless  it  is
ratified by countries responsible for 55% of industrialised nations’
greenhouse  gas  emissions.  In  June  2004  the  proportion  had
reached  44%,  with  Russia’s  17%  waiting  to  tip  the  balance.  In
October  2004,  however,  the  Russian  government  announced  it
would  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  bringing  it  into  force  in  early
2005.

Other climate change prompted
commitments include:
The European Union has set a target to double the proportion of
energy  in  the  15  member  states  (before  the  latest  enlargement)
provided  from  renewable  sources. The  aim  is  for  12%  renewable
energy by 2010. This includes a specific target to achieve 3 GWp of
PV  capacity. The  EU  also  has  a  target  for  1  million  solar  roofs  as
part  of  its  renewable  energy  “Campaign  for  Take-Off”.  Other
countries around the world have similar targets for large numbers
of grid-integrated PV systems (see Part Three: The Solar Race).

Solar power  can be easily installed  in remote and rural areas,
places which may not be targeted for grid connection for many
years.  Installation  of  transmission  and  distribution  lines  are
avoided  and  remote  communities  can  reduce  reliance  on
energy imports.

Energy payback
A popular belief still persists that PV systems cannot ‘pay back’
their energy investment within the expected lifetime of a solar
generator  -  about  25  years.  This  is  because  the  energy  used,
especially  during  the  production  of  solar  cells,  is  seen  to  far
outweigh the electricity eventually generated.

Data  from  recent  studies  shows,  however,  that  present-day
systems already have an energy payback time (EPBT) - the time
taken for power generation to compensate for the energy used
in  production  -  of  3  to  4  years,  well  below  their  expected
lifetime.  With  increased  cell  efficiency  and  a  decrease  in  cell
thickness,  as  well  as  optimised  production  procedures,  it  is
feasible  that  the  EPBT  for  grid-connected  PV  will  decrease  to
two years or less for crystalline silicon modules and to one year
or less for thin film modules.

PART TWO

THE SOLAR POWER MARKET

PART TWO: THE SOLAR POWER MARKET

Solar  power  is  booming.  By  the  end  of  2003  the  cumulative
installed  capacity  of  all  PV  systems  around  the  world  had
reached the landmark figure of 2,400 MWp. This compares with
a figure of 1,200 MWp at the end of 2000, reflecting a doubling
of the total installed capacity in just three years. Shipments of
PV cells and modules around the world have been growing at
an average annual rate of more than 35% since 1998.

Such  has  been  the  growth  in  the  solar  industry  that  sales  are
now worth an annual ¤ 3 billion. Competition among the major
manufacturers  has  become  increasingly  intense,  with  new
players entering the market as the potential for PV opens up.

Although the expansion in recent years has been primarily in
the  grid-connected  sector,  the  international  PV  demand  side
market  divides  up  into  four  clear  sectors.  These  market
categories are used throughout this report.

DEMAND SIDE MARKET SECTORS

Consumer goods and services

Applications
Solar  cells  or  modules  are  used  in  a  wide  range  of  consumer
products  and  small  electrical  appliances,  including  watches,
calculators and toys, and to provide power for services such as
water sprinklers, road signs, lighting and phone boxes.

Typical  of  a  new  development  is  the  use  of  PV  to  control  air
conditioning  in  cars.  A  small  system  integrated  in  the  roof
keeps the temperature inside at a constant level by operating a
ventilator when the car is parked, especially in the sun during
summertime.  This  results  in  lower  peak  temperatures  inside
the  car  and  a  much  cheaper  air  conditioning  system  due  to  a
lower requirement for power. Manufacturers may also be able
to save on the cost of expensive heat resistant materials in the
vehicle’s interior.

Market development
In  the  year  2003  this  sector  accounted  for  roughly  35  MWp,
about 5% of global annual production. As demand for a mobile
electricity  supply  increases,  it  is  likely  to  continue  to  grow,
especially  with  the  attraction  of  innovative  low  cost  solar
electricity  technologies  such  as  organic  solar  cells.  In  2004
Siemens  announced  the  development  of  an  organic  solar  cell
with 5% efficiency.

Grid-connected systems

Applications
PV can be installed on top of a roof or integrated into the roofs
and  facades  of  houses,  offices  and  public  buildings.  Private
houses are a major growth area for roof systems as well as for
BIPV  (Building  Integrated  PV),  with  the  average  capacity  of
domestic  systems  in  Germany  now  above  5  kWp.  For
comparison,  a  3  kWp  solar  electricity  system  in  southern
Germany  delivers  more  than  2,700  kWh/year,  sufficient  to
supply  up  to  100%  of  the  electricity  needs  of  an  energy
conscious household.

PV  is  also  used  increasingly  as  a  design  feature  by  architects,
replacing elements in a building’s envelope. Solar roof tiles or
slates can replace conventional materials, for instance. Flexible
thin  film  modules  can  even  be  integrated  into  vaulted  roofs,
while  semi-transparent  modules  allow  for  an  interesting
mixture of shading and daylight. PV can also be used to supply
peak  power  to  the  building  on  hot  summer  days  when  air
conditioning systems need most energy, thus helping to reduce
the maximum electricity load.

If a solar electricity system is recognised as an integral part of a
building,  then  the  money  spent  on  decorative  materials  for
facades,  such  as  marble,  can  instead  be  invested  in  solar
modules.  Solar  power  doubles  up  as  both  an  energy  producer
and  a  building  material.  For  prominent  businesses  it  can
provide the public face of their environmental commitment.

Distributed  generation  using  solar  facades  or  roofs  can  also
provide benefits to a power utility by avoiding grid replacement
or strengthening and potentially reducing maximum demand
for conventional electricity, especially in countries with a high
cooling load.

Large scale grid-connected PV arrays have not so far become a
major  part  of  the  market,  mainly  because  of  the  difficulty  in
finding enough space in built-up areas. In Europe, however, it
was estimated in 1998 that the potential for integrating PV into
noise  barriers  then  planned  for  construction  alongside
motorways  and  railways  was  as  high  as  1,100  MWp.  Sun-
drenched  desert  regions  present  good  opportunities  in  the
longer  term,  especially  as  module  prices  continue  to  fall,  for
instance in the south west United States, Africa and Mongolia.

In Germany, large scale ground based systems in the megawatt
class have become a new market in recent years. This offers a
new source of income for farmers, who can rent their land to
investors  in  large  PV  systems  and  with  the  advantage  of  a
secure revenue for at least 20 years.

Market development
This  sector  is  the  current  motor  of  the  PV  boom,  with  most
development  taking  place  in  the  OECD  countries.  More  and
more national governments see PV as an important technology
for the future and have already established, or are in the process
of establishing, support programmes. While in 1994 only 20% of
new capacity was grid-connected, this had grown to over 70%
by 2003.

Examples  of  market  stimulation  programmes  include  Japan’s
70,000  rooftop  proposal,  the  100,000  roofs  initiative  in
Germany, the current Renewable Energy Law in Germany, and
the million solar roofs programme in the United States, which
includes both PV and solar thermal applications. These support
programmes  will  continue  to  provide  an  impetus  for  market
growth for some years to come, and are likely to be followed by
similar initiatives in other countries (see Part Three: The Solar
Race).

16

17

The  other  side  of  the  grid-connected  domestic  market  is  the
control which PV systems allow the consumer over their power
supply. Not only is electricity generated at the point of demand
but the consumer is effectively transformed into the operator of
his or her own power station. As international power markets
steadily liberalise this is likely to have increasingly important
market implications.

Off-grid electrification

Applications
PV  provides  vital  power  for  communities  in  the  developing
world who have no access to mains electricity. About 1.7 billion
people  around  the  world  currently  live  without  basic  energy
services.

Among the uses made of solar electricity in off grid situations
are  for  domestic  lighting,  solar  lanterns,  TV  sets,  water
pumping, refrigerators and providing lighting for shops, health
centres or small market places.

PV has the potential to deliver much more than just electricity
for lighting or improved health care, however. By providing the
power supply for computers, for example, it can enable people
not just to have access to information through the internet, but
to improve their economic situation through better marketing
of products or buying goods at more reasonable prices.

Market development
Apart  from
its  clear  social  advantages,  the  economic
justification  for  using  PV  is  through  the  avoided  fuel  costs,
usually  expensive  diesel,  or  by  comparison  with  the  cost  of
extending  the  grid.  For  subsistence  level  communities  the
initial stumbling block is often the capital cost of the system.
But although numerous rural development programmes have
been initiated in developing countries, supported both by multi
and  bilateral  assistance  programmes,  the  impact  has  so  far
been relatively small.

There is also a major need to provide clean drinking water in
the developing world. The World Health Organisation estimates
that  10,000  children  die  each  day  from  water-borne  diseases.
Solar-powered  water  purification  systems  and  pumps  are
easily transportable, easy to maintain and simple to use and, as
part of rural health initiatives, could be an important tool in the
fight against disease.

Off-grid industrial

Applications
Industrial  uses  for  off  grid  solar  power  are  mainly  in  the
telecommunications field, especially to link remote rural areas
to  the  rest  of  the  country.  In  India,  for  example,  more  than  a
third of the PV capacity is devoted to the telecommunications
sector.  Repeater  stations  for  mobile  phones  powered  by  PV  or
hybrid systems (PV/diesel) also have a large potential.

Other  applications  include  traffic  signals,  marine  navigation
aids,  security  phones,  weather  or  pollution  monitors,  remote
lighting, highway signs and waste water treatment plants.

Market development
Apart from avoided fuel costs, for example by totally or partly
replacing  a  diesel  engine,  industrial  PV  systems  offer  high
reliability  and  minimal  maintenance.  This  can  dramatically
reduce  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  particularly  in  very
remote or inaccessible locations.

The  demand  for  off-grid  industrial  PV  systems  is  expected  to
continue to expand over the next decade and beyond, especially
in response to the continued growth of the telecommunications
industry. Mobile telephone masts and repeater stations offer a
particularly  large  potential,  especially  in  countries  with  low
population  densities.  Providing  communications  services  to
rural  areas  in  developing  countries  as  part  of  social  and
economic  development  packages  will  also  be  a  major  future
market opportunity for photovoltaics.

PV Around the World

 A 1.1 MWp solar electricity system was installed on the roofs of
the  new  trade  fair  building  in  Munich,  Germany  in  2002.
Together with an existing 1 MWp system this now represents
the largest roof mounted solar electricity system in the world,
providing electricity for more than 700 households.
 Senegal’s countryside is being transformed by projects run by
the Senegalese Agency for Rural Electrification, a government
department formed in 2001. With workers busily putting up
solar panels and poles to connect them to the grid, the project
aims  to  raise  the  percentage  of  Senegal’s  324  rural  counties
with electricity from nine to 15% by 2005, and to at least 60%
within 20 years.
 If the home team isn’t winning at the new Stade de Suisse in
Berne,  Switzerland  there  will  at  least  be  a  tour  of  the

energy  platform  to  power  the  building  and  its  surrounding

PART TWO: THE SOLAR POWER MARKET

SUPPLY SIDE MANUFACTURE

Solar Cell and Module Production
The  manufacture  of  solar  cells  and  modules  is  presently
concentrated in three key areas - Europe, Japan and the United
States. Japan leads the world, with solar cell shipments reaching
more than 365 MWp in 2003, a 48% increase over the previous
year. This corresponds to 48% of total world production. Europe
came  second  in  2003  with  202  MWp,  a  43%  increase  over  the
previous  year,  and  corresponding  to  27%  of  world  production.
Production in the United States reached only 109 MW, however,
a decrease of 6%, with the global share of US production falling
dramatically from 21% in 2002 to 14% in 2003.

flourishing market, Germany has seen a steady increase in both
solar cell and module manufacture from 1995 onwards. During
the period of the 100,000 roofs programme, from 1999 to 2003,
more than ¤ 1 billion was invested in new production facilities.
Further encouraged by the Renewable Energy Law, updated in
2004, production of cells increased from 32 MWp (2001) to 110
MWp  (2003)  and  of  modules  from  31  MWp  (2001)  to  80  MWp
(2003). It is anticipated that cell production will increase to 500
MWp, and module production to 380 MWp, by the end of 2006.
For  comparison,
(2001-3)  Japanese
in  the  same  period
production  of  solar  cells  rose  from  170  to  365  MWp  and  of
modules from 172 to 400 MWp.

The rest of the world, with its key players in Australia and India,
produced  85  MWp  in  2003.  Of  particular  interest  is  how
production  capacity  in  China  will  develop  over  the  next  few
years.  The  Chinese  company  Suntech  announced  an  expected
cell  production  capacity  of  75  MWp  by  the  end  of  2004  and
further expansion to 150 MWp in 2005. Overall, the growth of
global PV shipments since 1995 can be seen in Table 2.2.

The leading manufacturers of solar cells can be seen in Table 2.1.
Although until a few years ago the market was dominated by
BP  Solar,  a  subsidiary  of  the  multinational  oil  company,  this
situation has radically changed with the entry of new Japanese
and European players. In 2003, the two leading producers of PV
cells/modules  were  Sharp  and  Kyocera,  both
Japanese
companies. Sharp further strengthened its position as leading
cell producer with an increase in production to 197 MWp, which
corresponds to roughly 25% of world production. A breakdown
of  the  main  companies’  involvement  in  regional  and  country
markets can be seen in Table 2.1. The latest world market survey
by  trade  magazine  Photon  International  (April  2004)  records
298  types  of  modules  being  produced  by  78  different
manufacturers in more than a dozen different countries.

Europe  has  seen  an  expansion  in  production  from  traditional
cell producers such as RWE Schott Solar, which increased its cell
production  from  29.5  MWp  in  2002  to  44  MWp  in  2003,  and
Isofoton, which increased from 27 MWp in 2002 to 35.2 MWp in
2003. New players in the market are also showing impressive
growth  rates.  The  German  company  Q-Cells,  for  example,
expanded  its  production  from  9  MWp  (2002)  to  28.2  MWp
(2003), while Deutsche Cell expanded from 1 MWp (2002) to 17
MWp (2003).

An  important  issue  for  manufacturers,  especially  smaller
companies  who  do  not  have  the  backing  of  a  multinational
parent, is being able to match the opening of new production
capacity  with  expected  demand.  Investors  need  a  planning
horizon that goes beyond a typical factory’s write-off period of
five to seven years. Some smaller companies have nonetheless
been  able  to  obtain  investment  from  public  share  ownership,
often  through  one  of  the  increasing  number  of  green
investment funds.

MANUFACTURING AND OPERATING COSTS
The  cost  of  manufacturing  both  solar  cells  and  modules  and
other  components  has  been  falling  steadily.  As  a  result,  the
price of PV systems has fallen by an average of 5% per annum
over  the  last  20  years.  It  is  expected  that  this  rate  of  price
decrease can be maintained in the future.

Prices for PV systems vary between countries and according to
the  level  of  market  development  in  different  regions  of  the
world,  but  an  average  price  estimate  for  a  turnkey  solar
electricity system of a few kWp capacity would be ¤ 6000/kWp
for grid connected systems and about ¤ 8,500 for stand-alone
systems. This would result in life-cycle running costs for solar
electricity ranging from ¤ 0.25/kWh up to ¤ 1/kWh, depending
on  the  available  insolation  and  financial  assumptions.  These
costs make PV an economically advantageous choice in a large
variety of applications where no mains electricity is available.

This  is  why  the  relative  stability  of  systems  like  the  German
Renewable  Energy  Law  (see  Part  Three:  The  Solar  Race)  has
proved  crucial  to  business  commitment.  In  anticipation  of  a

By  contrast,  the  grid-connected  market  must  still  depend  for
the  moment  on  government  incentive  programmes.  In  Japan,

PART TWO: THE SOLAR POWER MARKET

however,  where  subsidies  were  cut  dramatically  by  50%  in
March 2004, the level of applications for PV systems to the New
Energy Foundation continued to remain at the same level in the
immediate aftermath of the cut. This suggests that the market
has  already  reached  a  substantial  level  of  sustainability  as  a
result of the former incentive programmes, a pattern which can
be expected to repeat itself in other countries with expanding
markets.

As  with  any  technology  the  development  of  a  learning  curve
leads  to  cost  reductions.  In  the  case  of  PV  the  cost  decrease  is
expected  to  be  around  20%  every  time  the  total  installed
capacity is doubled.

TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS

The production of PV cells is constantly improving as a result of
both  technology  advances  and  changing  industrial  processes.
About 60% of installation costs are represented by the module,
15% by the inverter and 25% by balance of system components
and assembly of the unit.

EPIA’s aims for further improvements include:

As larger PV cell and module factories come into operation, the degree of

automation in the production process is increasing. A number of European

solar  cell  producers  have  developed  highly  automated  solar  cell  plants

since 2001. The fact that the 1999 cell production capacity in Europe was

just 80 MW, while the 2003 production capacity in Germany alone was

110  MWp,  clearly  indicates  the  potential  for  automisation  and  major

improvements in the production process.

Conventional  methods  of  cell  production  produce  a  wafer  from  bulk

silicon  crystal  through  a  cost-intensive  and  material-inefficient  sawing

process. Losses during the transition from ingot to solar cell reach about

50%, mainly in the form of saw slurry. One way of eliminating the sawing

step is to grow ribbons of multicrystalline silicon which are already wafer

thin  and  the  correct  width  for  use  as  PV  cells.  This  method  is  being

pioneered by RWE Schott Solar at one of its factories. EPIA has adopted the

following technological aims in this field for 2010 (2020):

•

 Material (Si) consumption for mono crystallline-Silicon from 16 g/Wp

to 10 g/Wp (continuing to 8 g/Wp)

•

•

•

 Ribbons from 10 g/Wp to 6 g/Wp (continuing to 5 g/Wp)

 Wafer thickness from 300 µm to 180 µm (continuing to 100 µm)

 Kerf loss in the sawing process from 250 µm to 160 µm (continuing to

150 µm)

Since the first solar cell was developed 50 years ago major improvements

in efficiency have been achieved. With much potential still to be exploited,

EPIA has defined the following aims for the European PV industry up to

2010 (2020):

•

 Efficiency  increase  for  monocrystalline  silicon  from  16.5%  to  20%

(continuing to 22%)

•

 Efficiency  increase  for  multicrystalline  silicon  from  14.5%  to  18%

(continuing to 20%)

•

 Ribbon efficiency from 14% to 17% (continuing to 19%)

Improvement in the lifetime of solar modules is another road to further

reducing solar electricity prices. EPIA’s aim is to expand their lifetime to 35

years,  for  example  by  longer  lifetime  encapsulation  material  or  new

module architectures.

Thin  film  cells,  constructed  by  depositing  extremely  thin  layers  of

photosensitive  materials  on  a  low  cost  backing,  offer  the  potential  for

significant  cost  reductions.  Firstly,  material  and  energy  costs  should  be

lower  because  much  less  semiconductor  material  is  required  and  much

lower  temperatures  are  needed  during  manufacture.  Secondly,  labour

costs  are  reduced  and  mass  production  prospects  improved  because,

unlike  thick  crystalline  technologies  where  individual  cells  have  to  be

mounted in frames and wired together, thin films are produced as large,

complete modules.

EPIA has defined two targets for thin film technology up to 2010 (2020):

•

 Thin film aiming at efficiencies between 10% and 12% (a-Si/µc-Si, CIS

and CdTe) (continuing to 15%)

•

 Building integrated PV (BIPV) with low cost per mC, price reduction of

50% (continuing with an additional 50%)

PART THREE: THE SOLAR RACE

As  the  vast  potential  of  solar  power  as  a  clean  energy  source
begins to emerge, national governments around the world have
started to support its development through both research and
market  support.  Pursuing  their  regional  and  international
commitments  to  combat  the  effects  of  climate  change,  a
number of countries have given strong backing to an emerging
solar  market.  Importantly,  they  have  also  persuaded  their
general  publics
important  social  and
there  are
environmental benefits to be captured.

that

The  argument  in  countries  like  Japan  and  Germany  is
straightforward: by offering market incentives for the installa-
tion  and  operation  of  solar  arrays,  a  dynamic  relationship  is
created  between  market  promotion  and  industrial  growth,
eventually encouraging a flourishing manufacturing base and
export  potential.  The  environmental  dividend  is  a  cleaner
planet. These are the leaders in a solar race which will soon see
others joining the pursuit.

Germany

•  PV capacity end 2003: 416 MWp

 Support system: Premium price per kWh, financing opportunities
from the German Bank for Reconstruction

Germany is the European leader in solar energy. Having already
developed  the  world’s  largest  installed  capacity  of  electricity
generating wind turbines, Europe’s most populous state is now
looking  to  push  photovoltaics  into  an  equally  prominent
position.

In  terms  of  installed  capacity,  Germany  overtook  the  USA  in
2001 to achieve second position globally behind Japan. At the
end of 2003 total capacity had reached 416 MWp, with 130 MWp
installed last year alone. In the 2001 edition of Solar Generation
it was ambitiously estimated that the country could achieve a
figure of 438 MWp by 2004. This has in fact been almost reached
by  the  end  of  2003,  and  with  the  expectation  that  more  than
650 MWp will be installed by the end of 2004.

In  the  background  to  this  success  is  the  German  Social
Democrat/Green  government’s  Kyoto-led  commitment  to
reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases by 21% over the period
1990 to 2008-11. This will be achieved by a mixture of shifting
energy  production  towards  cleaner  sources  and  a  programme
of energy efficiency. Two successive pieces of legislation have
been crucially important in supporting the first of these aims -
the  100,000  roofs  programme  started  in  1999  and  the  2000
Renewable Energy Law, updated in 2004. One result is that the
wind  energy  industry  has  seen  a  capacity  of  over  15,000  MW
installed, representing roughly 5% of electricity supply, and an

estimated  45,000  jobs  created  in  less  than  a  decade.  The
German solar industry has now started a similar boom for PV.

THE ROOFTOP PROGRAMMES

Germany  has  been  a  pioneer  in  grid-connected  PV,  with  an
extremely effective “1,000 Rooftop Programme” running from
1990  to  1995.  More  than  2,250  rooftop  installations  were
connected  to  the  grid  during  this  period,  with  an  average
capacity of 2.6 kW per roof. In 1995, total system costs averaged
® 12.27/W and produced an average 700 kWh per kW installed
over the year.

At the end of this programme the German PV market suffered a
significant  breakdown,  however,  and  Greenpeace  and  other
organisations started extensive lobbying work to encourage a
follow-up. Greenpeace launched a solar pioneer programme in
1995 and has continued since then with extensive information
work  in  favour  of  solar  PV.  Between  1995  and  1999  about  40
cities  and  towns  also  implemented  their  own  “rate  based”
incentive schemes. These allowed residential customers to sell
electricity from their rooftop PV systems to the utility for up to
¤ 1.02/kWh. The purchase price was usually supported by a 1%
levy on electricity sales, mostly introduced after a vote among
local  electricity  customers.  This  support  was  eventually
superseded by the national Renewable Energy Law.

In 1999, a new five year programme was launched to promote
the installation of PV on 100,000 German roofs, with a budget
of ¤ 460m. The aim was to develop a total generating capacity
of  300  MWp.  For  both  private  households  and  businesses  the
incentive came through a guaranteed ten year low interest loan
(1.9%  per  annum),  and  with  no  repayments  in  the  first  two
years. Such loans were considered a proven method of avoiding
PV’s currently high start-up investment costs.

Although  initial  reaction  to  the  “100,000  Roofs”  programme
was  disappointing,  the  new  Renewable  Energy  Law  (REL)
introduced in April 2000 accelerated the market dramatically.
Under the REL, anyone who installed a solar generation system
received  a  buy-back  rate  of  ¤ 0.5  per  kWh  over  20  years.  This
payment then reduced by 5% each year from 2001 onwards for
newly  installed  systems,  a  fall  intended  to  mirror  the
anticipated reduction in the price of PV.

This combination of the solar roof programme and the REL has
proved a potent mix. Such was the overwhelming response that
the 2000 PV loans budget of ¤ 92m was already used up by the
almost 4,000 applications approved during the first quarter of
the year. Thousands more applications had to be postponed due
to lack of funds. During 2000 alone more than 8,000 systems
were approved, with a total capacity of 41.66 MW. The average
size also increased to 5.18 kWp, with over 100 plants in the 50 to
120  kWp  range  -  a  sign  that  the  market  was  moving  into  the
business/industrial  sector.  With  the  ending  of  the  100,000
roofs programme the Renewable Energy Law was revised (see
table  below).  There  are  also  still  possibilities  to  receive  a  low
interest  rate  loan  for  investment  in  a  PV  system,  for  example
under the COc abatement programme.

The outcome of the 100,000 roofs programme (1999-2003) with
support from the 2000 Renewable Energy Law is impressive:

•
•
•

•
•

 345.5 MWp installed
 Total investment by customers ¤ 1.77 billion
 Market  volume  increase  from  12  MWp  in  1999  to  130  MWp  in
2003
 PV system price reduction of 20%
 Investment by the PV industry of ¤ 1 billion

FUTURE PROSPECTS

The German government, strongly supported by public opinion,
clearly  considers  PV  to  be  a  viable  long  term  option  for  bulk
production of carbon-free power. Public funding of R&D, about
¤ 17,25m in 2003, is therefore likely to continue. Its focus will be
firstly on reducing the costs of solar cell and module production,
and  secondly  on  improving  the  efficiency  and  reliability  of
systems.

Most  importantly,  the  Renewable  Energy  Law  has  provided  a
secure,  medium-term  planning  base  for  investment,  at  the
same time helping to move the technology forward from small-
scale manufacturing for niche markets to mass production for a
broad range of applications.

 Spain  has  an  overall  target  to  double  its  proportion  of
renewable  energy  to  12%  by  2010.  The  1998  feed-in  law  was
revised in March 2004, with some significant changes and new
conditions  which  should  be  excellent  tools  for  getting  the  PV
market moving. These include:
-   41.4  ¤ cents/kWh  up  to  system  sizes  of  100  kWp  (until  150
MWp installed, then new calculation of the tariff for further
systems)
-  21.6 ¤ cents/kWh for system sizes above 100 kWp (until 200

 Italy launched a solar roof programme in 2001, but success has

 Luxemburg  has  an  extremely  attractive  support  system,  with

 The United Kingdom had 5.9 MWp of capacity installed by the
end of 2003, mostly the result of capital grants totalling ¤ 56
million offered by the government.
 After several years of regional programmes, Austria introduced
a national feed-in tariff at the beginning of 2003. Due to the
very limited installed capacity (15 MWp) supported, applications
were accepted for a period of less than one month.
 In Greece the implementation of a feed in tariff for PV is under
discussion.
 Other European countries are also pursuing solar programmes,
mainly targeted at the grid-connected sector.

industry’s goal is to sustain a 30 to 35% annual growth over the
next 20 years. In terms of installations, PV has reached a level of
275 MWp, with 63 MWp being installed during 2003.

Access to PV systems is growing fast in California, but is limited
in  the  rest  of  the  country.  Over  80%  of  systems  have  been
installed in California, where more than 4 out of 5 people favour
doubling  the  state’s  supply  of  renewable  energy  sources  by
2010.  Other  states,  including  Arizona,  Connecticut,  Maine,
Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania,
Texas  and  Wisconsin  have  introduced  Renewable  Portfolio
Standard  programs,  which  have  increased  renewable  energy
use, but have had a limited impact on PV development.

The  US  PV  production  market  is  largely  in  the  hands  of
multinational  companies.  AstroPower  has  been  bought  by
General Electric, while the biggest US producers, Shell Solar and
BP Solar, account for nearly two thirds of solar cell production.

ECONOMICS

There  is  no  national  price  incentive  programme  for  PV,  as  in
Germany, and support is largely dependent on individual state
initiatives.  “Commercial”  PV  (not  domestic)  is  eligible  for  a
federal 10% tax credit, but this has not been enough by itself to
stimulate the market.

Various  support  measures  have  been  considered  by  the  US
Congress.  The  2001  National  Energy  Security  Policy  Act,  for
instance, would have offered a 15% residential solar tax credit of
up to $ 2,000 and a buy-down payment starting at $ 3 per watt
of

installed  capacity.  The  buy-down

renewable  electricity),

The US PV industry has also benefited from state incentives and
policies  designed  to  increase  the  use  of  renewable  energy.  A
number of initiatives beneficial to solar power, including green
pricing  schemes  (where  consumers  agree  to  pay  extra  for  a
supply  of
renewables  portfolio
standards (commitment that a specific percentage of the state’s
power  should  come  from  renewables),  and  system  benefit
charges  (where  a  levy  is  made  on  all  electricity  users  to  fund
renewables) have been passed by individual states. In addition,
more than 35 states have introduced net metering, where the
power  utility  agrees  to  pay  the  same  amount  for  the  output
from a solar system as consumers pay for their supply.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

The  US  Department  of  Energy  directs  research  focused  on
increasing domestic capacity by lowering the cost of delivered
electricity  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  PV  modules  and
systems.

Specific goals up to 2006 are to:
•

 Reduce the direct manufacturing cost of PV modules by 30% to
$ 1.75/W

•

•

•

 Establish  greater  than  20  year  lifetimes  for  PV  systems  by
improving the reliability of balance-of-system components and
reducing recurring costs by 40%
 Work  with  the  PV  industry  to  facilitate  achievement  of  its
roadmap  goals  of  1  GW  cumulative  US  sales  (export  and
domestic) by 2006
 Ensure that the National Solar Program shares the costs in areas
of fundamental research, technology development and advanced
materials and devices

The total federal budget for the photovoltaic component of the
National  PV  Subprogram  totalled  $ 64  million  in  2003,  with
additional  Congressional  funding  of  $ 10.7  million  for  the
Million Solar Roofs Program, an inverter initiative and various
specific PV installations.

FUTURE PROSPECTS

Government  projections  suggest  that  solar  PV  will  be  the
fastest growing source of generation in the US over the next 20
years,  with  its  use  expanding  at  a  rate  of  more  than  19%  per
year up to 2020. All renewables, including geothermal, biomass
and  wind,  could  be  providing  8%  of  the  country’s  electricity
over the same time scale.

The  US  PV  industry  has  meanwhile  presented  a  longer  term
strategy which looks further ahead than the five year cycles of
the  government’s  PV  programme.  Marking  out  a  20  year
roadmap  for  research,  technology  and  market  priorities,  this
framework assumes a world wide annual growth rate of 25% up
to  2020,  and  with  the  goal  of  reaching  a  40%  share  for  US
module  manufacturers.  By  2020,  this  means  that  the  US
industry could be supplying at least 6 GW to be installed world
wide, with 15 GW installed in the US itself. On that basis the PV
industry would be approaching a turnover of $ 10 billion a year,
creating tens of thousands of jobs and enormous environmental
benefits.

The future for PV in the US is crucially dependent, however, on
the  ongoing  stance  on  energy  issues  taken  by  the  Bush
administration, especially over climate change. At the time of
writing  the  US  has  still  refused  to  sign  up  to  the  latest
international  agreement  resulting  from  the  Kyoto  Protocol,
which  details  how  developed  countries  will  reduce  their
greenhouse gas emissions.

On current trends US Americans are expected to use 27% more
energy in 2020 compared to 1998, with electricity use increasing
the  fastest.  Without  a  significant  commitment  to  energy
efficiency and renewable energy, high electricity consumption
could result in 1,000 new power plants being built by 2020, the
vast majority powered by fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, the United States has tumbled from its position as
a leader in the solar industry. In 1995 the US produced 45% of
the  world’s  solar  cells,  but  the  lack  of  a  national  policy
promoting  solar  energy  has  held  growth  down.  Without  the
support of state governments such as California (see box), the
country would have fallen even further behind.

PART THREE: THE SOLAR RACE

State Initiatives in the US
Solar Initiatives in California
California is driving the US market for solar energy almost entirely
because  of  incentive  programs  offered  through  the  state’s
electricity suppliers. The main subsidy programs are the California
Energy  Commission’s  Emerging  Renewables  Program  -  which
offers $ 3 per watt towards capital costs and resulted in 3,200 solar
installations  in  2003  -  the  California  Public  Utility  Commission’s
Self-Generation  Incentive  Program  and  programs  run  by  Los
Angeles  Department  of  Water  and  Power  and  Sacramento
Municipal  Utility  District.  PV  installations  under  these  and  a
handful of other small programs reached 14 MW in 2002 and 26
MW in 2003, with a total of nearly 79 MW installed by June 2004.
The  California  Energy  Commission  has  also  simplified  the  rules
and  tariffs  for  net  metering,  and  reduced  the  paperwork  for
interconnection  requirements  for  grid-connected  photovoltaic
systems.
San Diego: The city of San Diego has committed to a first-of-its-
kind clean energy initiative to meet the city’s growing electricity
demand. Under this plan, San Diego will generate 50 MW of clean
energy  over  the  next  ten  years  to  meet  the  region’s  projected
energy  shortfalls  and  stop  another  energy  crisis.  The  City  is
expected to meet the majority of that demand with solar power.
This is  the first time a major US city council has initiated such a
plan as the solution to its energy needs, and was a major victory
for the Greenpeace Clean Energy Now team.
San Francisco: In November 2001, San Francisco voters approved a
$ 100  million  revenue  bond  for  renewable  energy  and  energy
efficiency that pays for itself from the savings, costing taxpayers
nothing. The bond pays for solar panels, wind turbines and energy
efficiency  measures  for  public  buildings.  The  money  that  would
have  gone  to  buy  electricity  from  power  plants  instead  goes  to
finance the bond.

University of California: The university is committed to install 10
MW of solar units across its ten campus network. Greenpeace was
instrumental in securing this commitment.
Other State Initiatives
•

 The  state  of  New  Jersey  offers  a  $ 5.50/Wp  subsidy  for
photovoltaic  systems.  The  Clean  Energy  Rebate  Program  has
budgeted $ 16.2 million up to 2008. The program has supported
(or reserved incentives for) 91 projects totalling over 3,300 kW
of power.
 Illinois:  LLed  by  the  strong  "Brightfields”  program  in  Chicago,
where abandoned ”brownfield" factory sites are converted  to
either photovoltaic manufacturing plants (owned and operated
by  Spire  Corporation)  or  installed  photovoltaic  systems.  The
state of Illinois passed the largest subsidy in the United States
for photovoltaic systems, $ 6/Wp. Over 1 MW of PV was installed
in the state in 2002.
 New  York:  New  York  has  agreed  over  $ 50  million  to  support
new  industry,  new  installations  and  studies  to  accelerate
commercialisation of photovoltaic systems. New York increased
the  photovoltaic  subsidy  to  $ 5/W  in  May  2002  for  grid-
connected systems.
 Virginia:  Virginia  offers  a  $ 0.75/W  cash  rebate  for  installed
photovoltaic  modules  produced  in  the  state.  This  program  is
capped at $ 6 million per year.
 Connecticut: The Connecticut Clean Energy fund has allocated
$ 5.3 million in subsidies, with $ 5.75/Wp offered for residential
PV systems.
 Nevada: The Nevada Demonstration Program offers up to $ 5/
W  for  residential,  small  businesses,  Indian  tribes  and  schools.
The program has $ 20 million to distribute over 3 years.
 North Carolina: Carolina offers a 35% tax credit for photovoltaic
system installations.
 Ohio:  Support  for  50  public  schools  to  have  photovoltaic
systems/training modules installed.

 PV capacity end 2003: 860 MWp
 Support  system:  Various  government  programmes,  including
grants for domestic PV roofs, and net metering support provided
by utilities

Renewable energy is seen as an indispensable part of Japanese
climate change policy and carbon reduction targets, as well as
an  emerging  technology  to  be  exploited.  Various  supportive
policies  to  encourage  growth  in  the  renewables  market  have
been introduced by the government, including significant solar
research  and  development  programmes  from  the  1970s
onwards. These policies have received backing from across the
spectrum of public bodies, academics, NGOs and the business
community.  Japan  now  has  PV  systems  on  thousands  of
schools,  hospitals,  factories,  warehouses,  offices,  houses  and
railway stations.

By  the  end  of  2003  a  total  of  860  MWp  had  been  installed  in
Japan,  with  government  plans  for  4.8  GWp  by  2010,  an
ambitious target requiring an annual growth rate of 30%. The
annual growth rate since 1998 has been up to 45%, however. If
the current trend continues, 70 to 80% of installations in Japan
will be rooftop systems with an average size of 3.8 kWp.

The national Japanese programme is aimed at rapid expansion
in the number of units coupled with a decreasing percentage of
subsidy. The overall goal is to stimulate production, bring prices
down,  create  market  awareness  and  leave  Japanese  industry
with a fully economic market which will encourage competitive
exports to the rest of the world. In pursuit of these objectives,
the  budget  for  the  residential  PV  system  dissemination
programme was cut from $ 223 million in 2002 to $ 100 million
in 2003, and by a further 50% this year. This reduced the subsidy
per kWp from $ 862/kWp in 2003 to $ 430/kWp in 2004. Even so,
the  market  has  continued  to  grow,  the  number  of  subsidy
applications  increased  during  2003,  while  the  price  for  PV

installed  capacity  has  continued  to  fall  to  a  present  level  of
about  $ 6,500/kWp.  One  specific  result  is  that  the  National
Institute  of  Advanced  Industrial  Science  and  Technology  in
Tsukuba,  Ibaraki  has  installed  PV  demonstration  facilities
amounting  to  over  1  MWp.  This  is  the  largest  ever  in  Japan,
providing 1 GWh of clean electricity and a COc reduction of 300
tons annually.

GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

The  Japanese  government  has  focussed
large  financial
resources on the PV market in order to establish internationally
competitive  mass  production.  Comprehensive  financial,  tax
and  system  support  measures  are  used  to  promote  solar  and
other “new energy” (renewable) technologies which are already
established but not yet commercially competitive.

Most  of  this  funding  -  for  a  mixture  of  R&D,  demonstration
programmes and market incentives - has been made available
since  1980  through  NEDO,  the  New  Energy  and  Industrial
Technology  Development  Organisation  and  the  New  Energy
Foundation.  Japanese  PV  budgets  grew  almost  linearly  from
$ 20 million in 1980 to $ 240 million in 2004.

The following programmes are in place for PV promotion and
technological development.

PART THREE: THE SOLAR RACE

Japan’s  national  programmes  for  renewables  during  2004
include:

•

•

•

•

 RPS  Law  (2003)  obliges  electric  utilities  to  achieve  a  target  for
1.35% of their electricity supply to come from renewable energy
sources, including solar, by 2010.
 The Regional New Energy Introduction Project aims to accelerate
the  introduction  of  new  energy  (renewable)  technologies  by
supporting  regional  government  projects.  Half  of  system
installation costs are subsidised.
 The Subsidy Programme for New Energy Industrialists supports
businesses which plan to introduce new energy, including PV.
 The programme for development of regional new energy visions
helps local government and related bodies  to create visions for
facilitating promotion of renewable energy at local levels.

ECONOMICS

Japan has had an aggressive PV R&D programme since the late
1970s,  with  virtually  all  funds  directed  at  developing  an
industry capable of competing in the world market, and with
cost reductions that would also serve the domestic market.

In the past five years PV system costs have reduced by another
33%.  In  the  future  it  is  expected  that  the  average  price  of  a
residential PV system will fall even further, to below $ 4,000/
kWp.  Even  so,  the  cost  of  PV  electricity  is  still  presently  more
than twice the price of conventional domestic power, which is
exceptionally  expensive  in  Japan.  If  the  added  value  of  solar
systems in environmental terms was monetised for customers,
however,  PV  would  be  able  to  compete  much  earlier  than
expected.

28

One other factor is the introduction of premium green pricing
for  renewable  electricity.  All  ten  Japanese  regional  power
utilities introduced a “Green Power Fund” at a monthly rate of
$ 1-4  from  October  2000,  with  the  companies  matching  this
amount  towards  the  installation  of  new  renewable  plants.
Most electric utilities also have net metering systems by which
they buy PV electricity from individual customers. As a result of
the RPS law, however, some utilities have refused to buy at the
same  price  level  when  they  cannot  use  credits  from  the  PV
electricity  put  into  the  grid  by  individual  customers  for
achieving  their  respective  RPS  targets.  In  these  cases,  the
purchase price has fallen dramatically to 3-5 cents per kWh.

NATIONAL TARGETS

Following the climate change summit at Kyoto in 1997,  Japan
announced (in 2001) an accelerated target to install 4,820 MW
of  PV  by  2010.  Projections  by  the  Japan  Photovoltaic  Energy
Association (JPEA) show that annual installations could reach
1,230  MWp  by  2010,  with  a  corresponding  market  size  of  $ 4.5
billion. Looking further ahead, the goal set by JPEA is to increase
the annual market to 4,300 MWp by 2020, with a total capacity
of 28,700 MWp installed. For 2030 the goal is to reach an annual
market of 10,000 MWp, with a cumulative installed capacity of
82,800  MWp.  By  then  the  PV  industry  in  Japan  would  have
created 300,000 jobs, the PV installation rate would be at 45%
for detached houses and the price for a kWp PV system would
have fallen below $ 2,000.

The total future potential for PV power generation in Japan is as
much  as  173  GW,  according  to  calculations  made  by  the
government agency METI in 2000.

Prime Power
PV has been installed on a new building at the official residence
of  the  Japanese  Prime  Minister,  a  symbol  that  solar  power  is
central to the country’s future energy regime.

PART FOUR

THE SOLAR FUTURE

PART FOUR: THE SOLAR FUTURE

THE GREENPEACE/EPIA
“SOLAR GENERATION” SCENARIO

Methodology & Assumptions

If PV is to have a promising future as a major energy source it
must  build  on  the  experiences  of  those  countries  which  have
already led the way in stimulating the solar energy market. In
this section of the report we look forward to what solar power
could  achieve  -  given  the  right  market  conditions  and  an
anticipated  fall  in  costs  -  over  the  first  two  decades  of  the
twenty-first  century.  As  well  as  projections  for  installed
capacity and energy output we also make assessments of the
level of investment required, the number of jobs which would
be created and the crucial effect which an increased input from
solar electricity will have on greenhouse gas emissions.

Projection to 2040: For the period 2020-2040 a very conservative
lifetime  of  25  years  has  been  assumed  for  PV  modules.  As  a
result, the capacity installed in the first year of the scenario has
been  subtracted  from  the  figure  for  cumulative  installed
capacity  reached  after  25  years.  This  methodology  has  then
been applied to all subsequent years.

The scenario is also divided in two ways - into the four global
market  divisions
(consumer  applications,  grid-connected,
remote industrial and off-grid rural), and into the regions of the
world  as  defined  in  projections  of  future  electricity  demand
made  by  the  International  Energy  Agency.  These  regions  are
OECD Europe, OECD Pacific, OECD North America, Latin America,
East Asia, South Asia, China, the Middle East, Africa and the Rest
of the World.

This  scenario  for  the  year  2020,  together  with  an  extended
projection  forwards  to  2040,  is  based  on  the  following  core
inputs.

installations  and  manufacturing

These are the headline findings of the Greenpeace/EPIA “Solar
Generation”  scenario.  They  show  clearly  that,  even  from  a
relatively low baseline, PV electricity has the potential to make
a major contribution to both future electricity supply and the
mitigation of climate change.

Table 4.1: The Greenpeace/EPIA “Solar Generation” Scenario

The following assumptions have been employed:

Global Solar Electricity Output
in 2020:

282 TWh

Market  growth  rates:  For  Europe,  Japan  and  the  US,  growth
rates have been based on market development over the last few
years and on targets laid down by some countries for installed
PV capacity by 2010. For other countries the market expectations
are based on their likely take-off as the technology spreads. The
average annual growth rate worldwide up to 2009 is projected
to  be  27%,  then  rising  to  34%  between  2010  and  2020.  Initial
growth  is  expected  to  be  fastest  in  the  grid-connected  sector,
but by 2010 growth rates in the emerging off-grid rural sector
are expected to have overtaken, due to a significant reduction in
costs  and  the  likelihood  of  competitive  electricity  production
prices.

Electricity  generation:  Figures  for  the  growth  in  global
electricity  demand  up  to  2020,  on  which  comparisons  with
expected PV development are based, are taken from projections
by  the  International  Energy  Agency.  These  show  total  world
demand  for  power  increasing  from  15,300  TWh  in  2000  to
20,900 TWh in 2010 and 25,579 TWh by 2020.

Carbon  dioxide  savings:  An  off-grid  solar  system  which
replaces  an  average  diesel  unit  will  save  about  1  kg  COc  per
kilowatt  hour  of  output.  The  amount  of  COc  saved  by  grid-
connected  PV  systems  depends  on  electricity  production  in
different countries. The world average figure is 0.6 kg COc per
kilowatt-hour.  For  the  whole  scenario  period  it  has  therefore
been assumed that PV installations will save on average 0.6 kg
COc per kilowatt hour.

satisfy  the  current  electricity  needs  of  10%  of  the  expanded
European Community (EU 25).

The  global  installed  capacity  of  solar  power  systems  would
reach 205 GWp by 2020. More than half of this would be in the
grid-connected  market,  mainly  in  industrialised  countries.
Assuming that 80% of these systems are installed on residential
buildings,  and  their  average  size  is  3  kWp,  each  serving  the
needs  of  three  people,  the  total  number  of  people  by  then
generating  their  own  electricity  from  a  grid-connected  solar
system would reach 93 million. In Europe alone there would be
roughly  31  million  people  receiving  their  supply  from  grid-
connected solar electricityB.

In the non-industrialised world approximately 30 GWp of solar
capacity is expected to have been installed by 2020 in the rural
electrification sector. Here the assumption is that as an average
a  100  Wp  stand  alone  system  will  cover  the  basic  electricity
needs of 3-4 persons per dwelling. Since system sizes are much
smaller and the population density greater, this means that up
to  950  million  people  in  the  developing  countries  would  by
then  be  using  solar  electricity.  This  would  represent  a  major
breakthrough  for  the  technology  from  its  present  emerging
status.

By  2040,  the  penetration  of  solar  generation  would  be  even
deeper. Assuming that overall global power consumption had
by  then  increased  from  25,578  to  36,000  TWh,  the  solar
contribution would equal 21% of the world’s electricity output.
This  would  place  solar  power  firmly  on  the  map  as  an
established energy source.

2. Employment

More  jobs  are  created  in  the  installation  and  servicing  of  PV
systems  than  in  their  manufacture.  Based  on  information
provided  by  the  industry,  it  has  been  assumed  that  today’s  17
jobs  per  MW  in  production  will  be  reduced  to  15  in  2010,
decreasing  to  10  jobs  per  MW  between  2010  and  2020.  About
30 jobs per MW will be created during the process of installation,
retailing and providing other local services up to 2010, reducing
to 26 jobs per MW between 2010 and 2020. As far as maintenance
is concerned it is assumed that with the more efficient business
structures and larger systems of the industrialised world, about
one  job  will  be  created  per  installed  MW.  Since  developing
world  markets  will  play  a  more  significant  role  beyond  2010,
however,  the  proportion  of  maintenance  work  is  assumed  to
steadily increase up to 2 jobs per MW by 2020.

The result is that by 2020, an estimated 2.25 million full time
jobs  would  have  been  created  by  the  development  of  solar
power  around  the  world.  Over  half  of  those  would  be  in  the
installation and marketing of systems

3. Costs and Investment

The  falling  cost  of  PV  cells  and  modules  has  been  a  crucial
factor  in  the  recent  development  of  the  technology.  An
indication  of  the  potential  for  increased  efficiency  in  the
production  of  cells  has  been  given  in  Part  Two,  together  with
the likely shift in favour of cheaper thin film technologies.

In  this  scenario  it  is  projected  that  the  price  per  Wp  for
additional production sites will drop from today’s $ 1.69 to $ 1.12
by  2010.  Between  2010  and  2020  a  further  price  decrease  is
anticipated.  On  the  basis  that  the  current  progress  ratio  is
maintained,  an  ex-works  price  of  ¤ 2/Wp  for  crystalline
modules will be achieved by 2010.

In  terms  of  delivered  electricity,  it  is  possible  to  make
predictions  for  the  output  from  grid-connected  systems.  The
results are given for an average consumer in some of the major
cities of the world (see Table 4.4). These show that by 2020 the
cost  of  solar  electricity  in  the  most  insolated  regions  -  the
Middle  East,  Asia,  South  America  and  Australasia  -  will  have
more  than  halved  to  as  little  as  10-13  S cents/kWh  in  the  best
conditions. This would make PV power competitive with typical
electricity prices paid by end consumer households.

Of  equal  importance  in  relation  to  falling  costs  is  the  level  of
investment  in  manufacturing  capacity.  Here  the  scenario

shows  that  the  global  value  of  the  solar  power  market  will
have reached more than $ 70 billion by the end of the scenario
period. Investment in new production facilities will reach $ 13.2
billion by 2020. The overall market volume for PV systems will
increase to $ 62 billion. Just over $ 9.6 billion of that value will
be located in Europe, $ 8.7 billion in the Pacific region and $ 5.6
billion in Africa.

4. Carbon Dioxide Reductions
A reduction in the levels of carbon dioxide being emitted into the
world’s  atmosphere  is  the  most  important  environmental
benefit  from  solar  power  generation.  Carbon  dioxide  is  the  gas
largely  responsible  for  exacerbating  the  greenhouse  effect,
leading to the disastrous consequences of global climate change.

PART FOUR: THE SOLAR FUTURE

As the world’s solar electricity production increases, there will
be  equivalent  reductions  in  the  amount  of  carbon  dioxide
thrown  out  into  the  atmosphere.  As  already  explained,  PV
systems produce none of the harmful emissions resulting from
fossil fuel power generation. Every solar system installed will
therefore result in the avoidance of generation from a polluting
source.

At the same time, modern solar photovoltaic installations have
a very good energy balance. The COc emissions resulting from
manufacture,  installation  and  servicing  over  the  life-cycle  of
solar  generators  are “paid  back”  within  the  first  three  to  four
years  of  operation  for  crystalline  technology.  According  to  PV
manufacturers  this  will  further  decrease.  For  thin  film  tech-
nologies  energy  pay  back  times  of  less  than  one  year  are
realistic.

The benefit to be obtained from carbon dioxide reductions in a
country’s energy mix is dependent on which other generation
method or energy use solar power is replacing. Where off-grid
systems replace diesel generators, they will achieve COc savings
of  about  1  kg  per  kilowatt  hour.  Due  to  their  tremendous
inefficiency,  the  replacement  of  a  kerosene  lamp  will  lead  to
even larger savings - up to 350 kg per year from a single 40Wp
module,  equal  to  25  kg  COc  per  kWh.  In  the  consumer
applications and remote industrial markets, on the other hand,
it  is  very  difficult  to  identify  exact  COc  savings  per  kilowatt
hour.  As  already  explained,  over  the  whole  scenario  period  it
was therefore estimated that an average of 0.6 kg COc would be
saved per kilowatt hour of output from a solar generator. This
approach is quite conservative, so higher COc savings may well
be possible.

Cumulative  carbon  dioxide  savings  from  solar  electricity
generation  between  2000  and  2020  will  reach  a  level  of  664
million  tonnes,  equivalent  to  two-thirds  of  Germany’s  COc
emissions  in  2000  (or  almost  as  much  as  the  total  emissions
from Canada or Brazil).

External costs of Electricity Generation
The external costs to society incurred from burning fossil fuels or
from  nuclear  generation  are  not  included  in  most  electricity
prices. These costs have both a local and a global component, the
latter  mainly  related  to  the  eventual  consequences  of  climate
change. There is uncertainty, however, about the magnitude of
such  costs,  and  they  are  difficult  to  identify.  A  respected
European study, the “Extern E” project, has assessed these costs
for fossil fuels within a wide range, consisting of three levels:
•
•
•
Taking a conservative approach, a value for the external costs of
carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels could therefore be in
the range of $ 10-20/tonne COc.
The  assessment  above  concludes  that  solar  power  reduces
emissions  of  COc  by  an  average  of  0.6  kg/kWh.  The  resulting
average  cost  avoided  for  every  kWh  produced  by  solar  energy
will  therefore be in  the range of 0.25 - 9.6 U cents/kWh. These
external  costs  must  be  taken  into  account  when  comparing
solar systems with other energy sources.

 Low: $ 4.3/tonne COc
 Medium $ 20.7 - 52.9/tonne COc
 High: $ 160/tonne COc

5. Regional Development

The  development  of  the  PV  market  is  expected  to  vary  from
region  to  region  around  the  world.  The  overall  pattern  of  the
scenario is that while the OECD regions, especially the US, Japan
and Europe, will dominate the global market up to 2010, after
that much faster development is expected to take place in other
regions, especially South Asia and Africa. By 2020 installed PV
capacity in the OECD regions will have fallen to less than half
the world total (see Figures 4.6-4.8).

By  2020  the  Solar  Generation  scenario  shows  that  the
worldwide  expansion  of  PV  would  be  reducing  annual  COc
emissions by 169 million tonnes. This reduction is equivalent to
the  emissions  from  all  45  million  cars  currently  operating  in
Germany,  or  the  entire  COc  emissions  from  the  Netherlands.

The  major  driving  forces  behind  the  future  growth  of  PV
capacity  in  each  of  the  most  important  regions  is  described
below, together with the conclusions reached in the scenario.

The European Union’s current target, part of a broader strategy
for renewable energy, is to reach at least 3 GWp of installed PV
power  by  the  year  2010.  This  scenario  demonstrates  that  this
goal can be exceeded and a capacity of almost 5 GWp in Europe
by 2010 is possible.

Reasons for this optimism include the fact that the PV market
in  Germany  grew  by  56%  between  2002  and  2003.  This
demonstrates  the  impressive  growth  rates  which  can  be
triggered by clearly defined and attractive support mechanisms
such  as  the  German  “feed-in  tariff”  offering  fixed  premium
prices for renewable energy output.

PREMIUM FEED-IN TARIFFS

Since  the  first  edition  of  Solar  Generation  in  2001  other
European  countries  have  also  implemented  various  incentive
programmes,  mostly  based  on  premium  tariffs  and  in  some
cases combined with investment subsidies. Spain, Austria, Italy
and  Luxembourg  have  all  introduced  incentive  schemes  for
solar  electricity,  some  more  successfully  than  others.  Spain
revised its support scheme for solar electricity, which is mainly
based on a premium feed-in tariff, and Italy is about to do so,
also  adopting  a  premium  feed-in  tariff  for  solar  electricity.
Luxembourg has a combination of feed-in tariff and investment
support, resulting in the highest per capita installed PV capacity
in  the  world.  Greece  is  also  planning  to  introduce  a  solar
electricity programme in the near future.

The  situation  in  Europe  differs  from  Japan,  which  has
experienced  a  similar  solar  boom  to  that  in  Germany.  PV
systems in Japan are mainly sold as part of new houses, offering
the  advantage  that  the  costs  can  become  part  of  the  home
mortgage.  This  system  is  also  possible  because  the  Japanese
construction  industry  is  dominated  by  a  very  few  large
companies offering standardised houses with standardised PV
systems. By contrast, the construction industry in Germany and
other European countries is much more diverse and the houses
more customer tailored.

Looking at the growth in different European markets over the
past  few  years  it  has  become  evident  that  premium  feed-in
tariffs  are  the  most  appropriate  tool  for  creating  an  eventual
self-sustaining  solar  electricity  market.  The  development  of  a
large  number  of  substantial  solar  electricity  markets  will  be
essential  for  the  long  term  stability  of  the  European  solar
electricity market and for lowering the risk attached to today’s
focus  on  the  German  market.  A  strong  demand  side  in  the
European PV market is crucial in order to provide the basis for a
strong  and  expanding  industry.  If  an  installed  capacity  of  4.7
GWp by the end of 2010 is to be achieved, it must therefore be a

solar electricity at a European Union level.

PART FOUR: THE SOLAR FUTURE

Industry  Association

The EPIA Road Map
(EPIA),
The  European  Photovoltaic
representing the majority of the European PV industry, published
a new road map in 2004. This manifesto outlines the European
PV  industry’s  priorities  for  achieving  the  objectives  of  the
European  Union  in  relation  to  installed  PV  capacities.  EPIA  has
devised  a  programme  of  specific  actions  which  the  European
industry,  in  collaboration  with  other  key  stakeholders  from  the
research,  policy,  finance,  electricity,  construction  and  other
sectors,  should  adopt  in  order  for  Europe  to  capitalise  on  the
global PV market.
The EPIA road map highlights the key obstacles and issues that
must be resolved before PV can contribute substantially both to
European and global energy supply. It is intended  to serve as a
guide for the European industry, including research priorities, up
to 2010 and beyond, and as a framework for political action to
help  realise  solar  electricity’s  potential  to  become  a  major
contributor to electricity generation during this century.

CASE STUDY: SOLAR GENERATION IN GERMANY

Germany is currently the key player in the European PV market.
As  a  result  of  the  support  provided  by  the  Renewable  Energy
Law,  together  with  the  100,000  roofs  programme  (available
until mid 2003), the average annual growth rate between 2000
and 2005 is expected to be 30%. Following the conclusion of the
roofs programme in 2003, however, the annual growth rate is
assumed  to  drop  to  25%  between  2006  and  2009  and  to  20%
between 2010 and 2020.

Table 4.6 summarises the findings of a case study on Germany
in  which  we  looked  at  the  potential  increase  (at  five  year
intervals) in installed capacity, as well as electricity generation,
carbon  savings,  jobs  created  and  the  total  value  of  the  PV
market.  The  results  show  that  the  electricity  output  from  PV
generation  could  reach  3.2  TWh  by  2010.  This  is  equivalent  to
the output of a centralised coal-fired power plant. By 2015 solar
electricity would cover more than 1.5% of Germany’s electricity
demand and by 2020 more than 3.5%. The cumulative installed
capacity would reach 18,477 MW by 2020.

Government policy and programmes

Following  a  1,000  roofs  programme  in  the  1990s,  the  100,000
roofs  programme  was  introduced  in  1999,  a  programme  that
provided low interest loans for the purchase of PV systems. By
itself,  this  programme  had  a  limited  success,  and  the  solar
boom  in  Germany  only  started  with  the  introduction  of  the
Renewable Energy Law in April 2000, which provided premium
tariffs  for  solar  electricity.  Until  mid  2003  the  100,000  roofs
programme and the premium tariff system operated in parallel.
After the ending of the 100,000 roofs programme, the feed-in
tariff  was  revised  at  the  beginning  of  2004  in  order  to
compensate for the fact that low interest loans were no longer
available.  These  new  and  higher  premium  feed-in  tariffs
triggered an even stronger solar electricity boom in Germany.
Estimates  for  new  capacity  expected  to  be  installed  during
2004 range up to 300 MWp.

Apart  from  the  attractive  feed-in  tariff  payments  there  are
several  factors  responsible  for  the  success  of  this  support
scheme.

•

•
•

•

•

•

•

 The  level  of  the  feed-in  tariff  is  high  enough  to  make  solar
electricity a viable choice for the investor.
 The utility is obliged to buy solar electricity at the fixed tariff.
 The extra costs for solar electricity are not paid by the state but
by all electricity customers, resulting in a very limited additional
financial burden (in 2003 the extra cost per household was ¤12).
 The  system  favours  the  installation  of  high  quality  solar
electricity  units  and  the  owner  has  a  strong  incentive  to  both
maintain the system and maximise energy output for at least 20
years.
 The tariff is fixed for 20 years, which means security of planning
for investors.
 At the beginning of each year the feed-in tariff is reduced by 5%,
but only for solar electricity systems newly installed that year. For
existing systems the tariff remains the same. This feature aims to
reflect the expected price decrease in solar electricity and provi-
des  an  important  incentive  for  the  PV  industry  to  reduce  its
costs.
 The  support  scheme  has  led  to  financial  pay  back  periods  of
between 13 and 15 years, leaving the owner with a surplus after
20 years.

Within the next 20 years the German PV industry could create
80,000  jobs  in  installation,  service  and  maintenance  alone.  If
all  the  modules  were  manufactured  in  Germany  itself  this
would create up to 50,000 additional jobs.

If the Solar Generation scenario is to be realised then the feed-
in tariffs available under the Renewable Energy Law, need to be
maintained until 2020 in order to avoid a collapse of the solar

Japan offers by far the largest and most developed PV market in
this  region.  The  Japanese  target  is  to  reach  almost  4.8  GWp
installed capacity by the year 2010. Since 2001 the market has
grown  by  75%,  a  growth  rate  based  on  a  strong  national  PV
support  programme  in  which  the  residential  sector  plays  an
important role. Japan also has a clear policy of linking domestic
demand  to  an  expanding  industrial  sector.  Alongside  this
regional leader, a smaller but increasingly important market is
expected to develop in Australia. The scenario shows that, with
annual  growth  rates  on  a  substantial  but  realistic  level,  the
region  will  eventually  become  the  strongest  market  in  the
world.

CASE STUDY: SOLAR GENERATION IN AUSTRALIA

Australia  has  the  potential  to  develop  its  own  large  solar  PV
industry  and  become  a  significant  force  in  the  Asia  Pacific
region.  In  the  1980s  Australia  led  the  world  both  in  research
and development and installed capacity of PV. Due to a lack of
federal or state government support and a meaningful policy
framework, this position was lost, but against the background
of  government  action  in  Japan  and  Germany  to  create  a  PV
market, Australia now has the opportunity to rebuild.

PV  market.  The  tariff  should  decrease  annually  in  relation  to
progress in reducing production costs. This phased programme
should lead to a self-sufficient market and much lower costs for
PV installations.

An export market will also become increasingly important for
the  expanding  PV  industry  in  Germany,  and  will  be  vital  to
maintain the market development assumed in this scenario. In
March  2001  a  new  export  initiative  was  launched  by  German
PV manufacturers and dealers, coordinated by the Fraunhofer
Institute for Solar Energy Systems. The aim of this initiative is
to provide better information and develop new mechanisms to
expand the use of off-grid applications.

PART FOUR: THE SOLAR FUTURE

Renewable Remote Power Generation Program
The Renewable Remote Power Generation Program was established to
support a reduction in diesel-based electricity generation by providing
up to 50% of the capital costs of off-grid renewable energy installations.
Recently it was extended to “fringe-of-grid”, and selected large projects
will be able to claim up to 70% of their costs. PV makes up 91% of the
installed capacity. The amount allocated to water pumping is limited
to 5% of the total funds provided to each state. Seven RRPGP Programs
are currently operating in five states, with an eighth,  the Indigenous
Community  Support  Program  (Bushlight),  managed  federally  across
several states.
Program funds total AUS$ 264 million and are allocated on the basis of
the relevant diesel fuel excise paid in each state or territory by public
generators in financial years 2000/01  to 2003/4. By  the end of 2003
AUS$ 25.5  million  had  been  allocated  to  small  projects  and  a  further
AUS$ 14.7  million  to  major  projects.  AUS$ 5.9  million  had  also  been
allocated  to  industry  support  activities,  including  test  facilities,
standards and certification. By  the end of 2003, 2.13 MWp of PV had
been  installed  in  small  systems  and  a  further  0.28  MWp  in  utility-
operated diesel grid systems. Although the program extends to 2009/
10,  it  is  likely  the  funds  will  have  been  exhausted  by  then.  Currently
some rural communities have difficulty finding matching funding.

Photovoltaic Rebate Program
The PVRP initially provided AUS$ 31 million over a three and a half year
period to meet up to half the PV system capital costs for both grid and
off-grid installations. Although it was recently extended with another
AUS$ 5.8  million,  the  program  will  finish  by  the  end  of  2004  or  mid
2005.
In  2003,  1,025  systems  (1.37  MWp)  were  installed,  with  AUS$ 6.03
million allocated in rebates. This brought  the program  total  to more
than 4,800 systems (5.4 MWp), with rebates of AUS$ 26.4 million.

Mandatory Renewable Energy Target
A national review of the MRET was conducted in 2003 and among its
recommendations were the following most relevant to PV:
•

 that  the  9,500  GWh  target  for  2010,  maintained  until  2020,  be
changed to increase to 20,000 GWh by 2020.
 that  the shortfall charge be indexed  to  the Consumer  Price Index
from 2010 onwards.
 that the deeming time for PV systems with a rating not more than
10 kW be extended from 5 to 15 years.
 that the eligible threshold for PV generation capacity be increased
from 10 kW to 100 kW
 that  a  review  be  undertaken  to  determine  how  further
consideration can be given to special assistance for the Australian
PV  industry,  either  through  enhancement  of  MRET  or  other
measures.

•

•

•

•

However,  in  its  2004  Energy  Paper  the  government  ruled  out  any
increases  to  the  size or  duration of  the  target,  and  no reference was
made to the other recommendations.

interval  metering  and

Solar Cities
Announced  in  the  2004  Energy  Paper,  the  Solar  Cities  program  will
provide  AUS$ 75  million  for  three  urban  areas  to  directly  support
uptake  of  PV  and  solar  hot  water,  as  well  as  energy  efficiency  and
efficient  pricing  signals.  These  arrangements  would  include  time-of-
cost-reflective  buy-back
day  pricing,
arrangements for electricity. They aim to capture the benefits of PV in
matching  peak  demand,  thus  reducing  transmission  and  generation
costs.
Expressions of interest will be called in late 2004, with selection of the
Solar  Cities  some  time  after  that.  However,  although  this  program
should  provide  valuable  information  for  the  PV  industry,  it  is  not  a
suitable replacement for (an ongoing) PVRP, as it focuses on only three

regions, will not start until 2006-7, runs for only about seven years and
will not provide long term national market transformation.

Policy Outlook
With  the PVRP  to be  terminated,  the recommendations of  the MRET
Review  unlikely  to  be  implemented  and  the  Solar  Cities  program
providing  only  limited  localised  support,  the  RRPGP  will  be  the  only
significant  market  development  program  operating  in  Australia.
However, it applies only to off-grid and fringe-of-grid systems, and the
federal  government  plans  to  remove  excise  on  diesel  fuel,  making  it
hard to compete with diesel generators. It is likely therefore that the
Australian PV industry will enter a slump, affecting local installation
more than manufacturing, since in 2003, 64% of locally manufactured
cells and 49% of modules were exported.
What  the  industry  needs  is  long-term  market  support  to  provide
certainty.  Current  policies  are  likely  to  result  in  a  boom/bust  cycle.
Research into the capability of PV to reduce exposure to peak loads on
the  distribution  network  and  exposure  to  peak  generation  prices  is
needed. The industry development and employment creation potential
needs to be recognised, especially for exports. Administrative barriers
are  not  particularly  problematic.  The  most  significant  barrier  to
market expansion is high capital cost.

The Role of Utilities
The  attitudes  of  electricity  retailers  and  grid  network  operators
(DNSPs)  to  PV  vary.  Although  most  are  generally  supportive,  dealing
with  small  systems  is  not  cost-effective,  and  sometimes  given  low
priority.  Some  DNSPs  have  high  barriers  to  entry,  such  as  connection
costs  that  are  much  higher  than  the  costs  they  actually  incur,  while
others provide connection (including metering) for free. Some retailers
will not reimburse system owners for electricity exported to the grid (in
excess of imports) and claim all Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs),
while others pay more for exported than for imported electricity and
guarantee  to  pay  the  system  owner  the  market  price  for  all  RECs
(currently  offering  AUS$ 37/MWh).Some  research  is  currently  being
carried  out  into  the  benefits  that  PV  has  for  DNSPs  and  retailers  in
terms of reducing exposure to peak loads on the distribution network
and exposure to peak generation prices. It is hoped that the Solar Cities
program will help quantify these benefits.

The Australian PV Industry
Cell production increased in 2003 from 20.5 to 26.3 MWp and module
production from 7 to 9.6 MWp. Cell production capacity also increased
to  33.5  MWp  by  the  end  of  2003,  with  a  further  5  MWp  capacity  in
concentrator systems.
BP Solar currently operates a 35 MWp facility in Sydney, and plans to
expand this to 40 MWp in 2004/05. Origin Energy is currently building
a  $ 20  million  5  MW  manufacturing  plant  in  South  Australia  using
Australian National University developed Sliver® cell  technology. If it
meets design objectives it will be expanded to 25 MW. Sliver® cells are
long,  narrow,  highly  efficient  and  bifacial  and  enable  up  to  12-fold
(92%) savings in silicon feedstock and 25-fold (97%) savings in wafers
needed per MW of module production. Because of  these advantages
they will significantly reduce the costs of PV.
Pacific Solar had plans to build a 20 MW Crystalline Silicon on Glass PV
factory in 2005, but decided to move it to Germany because of the lack
of a local market.
In 2003, 64% of cells and 49% of modules were exported, while around
30% of modules installed in Australia were imported. The industry has
a net value of around AUS$ 164.8 million. This is made up of AUS$ 95.1
million from the domestic market, AUS $ 106.26 from exports, but less
AUS$ 36.56  for  imports  of  wafers  and  module  components.  These
values  do  not  include  education,  R&D,  ongoing  operation  and
maintenance or BOS exports.

the Australian PV industry. This figure could be even higher if
the manufacturers also focused on exports.

In August 2004 the Australian PV industry released its own PV
Road Map. This includes targets and strategies for the different
PV market sectors, and with overall targets for 2010 and 2020 in
terms of installed capacity, employment, market value and COc
abatement. These differ somewhat from the global Greenpeace/
EPIA  Scenario,
for  example  where  specific  Australian
assumptions have been taken for the level of carbon reduction.

Government policy and programmes

There  are  currently
three  main  market  development
programmes provided by the government for PV in Australia:
the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program (RRPGP), the
Photovoltaic  Rebate  Program  (PVRP)  and  the  Mandatory
Renewable  Energy  Target  (MRET).  The  latter  sets  a  national
requirement  for  power  companies  to  source  an  increasing
proportion  of  their  electricity  from  renewable  energy.  Some
regional  authorities  provide  top-up  funds.  A  Solar  Cities
program,  announced  in  June  2004,  is  expected  to  begin  in
2005.

The Jurisdictional Regulators in the states of New South Wales,
Victoria and South AustraliaB have released rulings stating that
new  meters  on  non-market  generatorsC  must  be  able  to
measure  positive  and  negative  flows  of  electricity  separately.
However,  despite  this  regulation,  net  metering  may  still  be
legal where all parties agree.

If a system owner wishes to be rewarded for network support
and  reduced  exposure  to  peak  prices,  they  must  be  able  to
measure  the  gross  flow  of  electricity  to  the  grid  at  specific
times, especially during peak demand. Net metering does not
have this capability, and either interval metering or an inverter
with separate monitoring or data download is required.

Australian PV Market Status

Installed capacity has increased from 7.3 MWp in 1992 to 45.6
MWp in 2003, with 6.5 MWp installed during 2003 (4.8 MW off-
grid,  1.7  MW  on-grid).  Installations  are  dominated  by  off-grid
applications  (87%  of  the  total),  with  57%  industrial  and  30%
residential. The cumulative total to 2003 is made up of off-grid
domestic  (30%),  off-grid  non  domestic  (57%),  grid-connected
distributed (10%) and grid-connected centralised (3%). The size
of systems installed through government support programmes
(see  page  38)  have  remained  steady,  with  grid-connected
systems averaging around 1.5 kWp and off-grid systems around
1.1 kWp. Some larger systems are being installed.

Off  grid  systems  include  a  56  kWp  system  installed  at  the
remote Aboriginal community of Bulman  in 2002  at  a cost of
AUS$ 0.9 million and a 225 kWp system installed at a national
park  tourist  facility  in  Kings  Canyon  in  2003  at  a  cost  of
AUS$ 2.9 million.

Grid-connected systems include:
•

 The  Athletes’  Village  which  formed  part  of  the  Sydney  2000
Olympics  complex,  now  part  of  the  new  Sydney  suburb  of
Newington at Homebush. All 665 permanent houses have 1 kW
grid-connected systems.
 Kogarah  Town  Square,  a  recent  development  of  residential,
commercial and retail spaces, public library and car parking, has
a total of 165 kWp of grid-connected PV, made up of 148.6kWp of
amorphous laminate, and 11.4kWp of transparent glass PV.

systems are classified as non-market generators.

PART FOUR: THE SOLAR FUTURE

Government Policy and Programmes

In  order  for  the  ambitious  target  of  4.82  GWp  by  2010  to  be
realised,  appropriate  policies  must  be  put  in  place.  Rapid
expansion of PV installations in Japan has been made possible
by  a  set  of  efforts  by  the  government,  PV  manufacturers  and
utilities,  including  net  metering  schemes.  Home  applications
have been playing an important role in the PV market in Japan,
representing  90%  of  installations  last  year.  The  subsidy  for
home  applications,  however,  has  been  decreasing  and  is
scheduled  to  end  in  fiscal  year  2005.  If  the  promising  home
application market is to continue to flourish, either the current
support scheme should be continued or a replacement devised.

One significant issue is that consumers currently pay a monthly
figure  of  about  $ 20  to  support  the  programme,  and  further
efforts must be made to reduce the cost of PV systems. Reaching
a level of $ 5,000 per kWp would make the price acceptable to
PV  installers  and  could  lead  to  a  rapid  expansion  in  home
applications.

The Renewable Portfolio Standard enacted by the government
in 2003 should be expanded from its current target of 1.35% by
2010 in order to provide an incentive for increased use of solar
energy.  It  should  also  differentiate  between  (more  expensive)
solar generation and other renewable sources such as biomass
and wind.

Overall, energy policy in Japan continues to focus on fossil fuels
and nuclear energy. More attention needs to be given to the use
of
clearer
commitments made by the government for further expansion.

All  retailers  currently  pay  the  same  tariff  for  imported  and
exported electricity, except for Australian Inland Energy, which
pays  1  cent  more  for  export.  Some  retailers  may  only  pay  the

Distributed  Network  Service  Providers  (DNSPs)  are  currently
reviewing their grid-connect arrangements.

CASE STUDY : SOLAR GENERATION IN JAPAN

Japan is currently the world leader in PV applications and the
EPIA/Greenpeace  scenario  expects
to  be
maintained for a further 15 years. The success of Japan has been
largely attributable to a focus on support for home applications,
accounting  for  over  70%  of  the  total  installed  capacity.  If
strengthened policies are put in place, the annual growth rate
between 2005 and 2010 is expected to be 30%.

showing  future  prospects  for  installed  capacity,  electricity
generated,  avoided  COc  emissions,  the  total  value  of  the  PV
market and job creation. Installed capacity is projected to reach
well over 5 GWp by 2010, with electricity output of about 5 TWh.
By 2020 it will have exceeded 30 TWh, covering 2.5% of Japan’s
electricity  demand  and  with  an  installed  capacity  of  over  30
GWp. Over the next 15 years the number of jobs created by the
PV industry in installation and maintenance services would be
more than 126,000.

OECD North America

Growth rates envisaged in this scenario for the North American
PV market are the most moderate in the industrialised world.
This  is  a  result  of  the  energy  policy  adopted  by  the  US
government, which is not presently fostering the development
of  PV  in  a  serious  way.  Even  though  solar  irradiation  and  the
operating  conditions  in  the  large  North  American  land  mass
are extremely favourable to PV, growth rates are expected to be
moderate. Canada does not play a significant role as yet, with a
total installed capacity of 7 MWp and a growth in 2000 of just
1.3 MWp.

The importance of the US market for the global PV industry will
therefore decrease if there is no shift in policy within the next
few  years.  While  the  annual  solar  power  markets  in  OECD
Europe and OECD Pacific are expected to grow by 30% per year
and exceed 8 GWp by 2020, the market in OECD North America
will  by  then  only  be  around  0.8  GWp.  On  the  other  hand,  a
change  in  the  US  approach,  particularly  over  climate  change,
could dramatically improve future prospects.

CASE STUDY:
SOLAR GENERATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Because  of  the  key  position  of  the  US  in  the  future  solar  PV
market, two different scenarios have been calculated. The first
assumes  “business  as  usual”,  with  an  annual  growth  rate  of
20% up to 2020. The second “take-off” scenario is based on the
assumption  that  the  US  market  will  make  a  determined
attempt to catch up with its European competitors.

The first table below shows the expected outcome if the United
States  continues  with  its  present  lukewarm  approach  to  PV
support. As a result of serious budget cuts and repeated delays
in PV support programmes, the annual growth rate is expected
to remain at 20% throughout the scenario. If the US government
doesn’t  invest  in  PV,  then  the  country’s  market  will  be  five
times smaller in 2005 than the EU’s. By 2010 the US solar market
would be even smaller than Germany’s. By 2020 the US would
have a world market share of just 2%.

If the US government decided to establish a nationwide support
scheme similar to those operating in Germany or Japan, then a
different  market  development  would  be  possible  (see  Table
4.11).  This  “take-off”  scenario  assumes  that  the  US  domestic
market  will  develop  along  the  lines  of  Europe,  with  an
ambitious target for 3,500 MWp of cumulative capacity by 2010.
To  achieve  this  strong  market  growth  is  required,  with  the
assumption  that  after  2010  the  annual  growth  rate  would  be
the same as in Europe. This dramatic development would have
a serious impact on the world PV market. It would mean that
half of the estimated world market volume would be installed
in the USA, and the industry would create more than 220,000
jobs.

Government Policy and Programmes

The conclusion of the scenario for US federal and state energy
planners  is  that  if  the  government  decided  to  support  the
industry with a national programme, such as a reducing fixed
rate  tariff,  then  the  market  growth  could  be  equal  to  that  of
Europe.  The  US  PV  industry  would  then  be  among  the  world
leaders.

PART FOUR: THE SOLAR FUTURE

South Asia

The solar market in South Asia is dominated by India, both on
the  supply  and  demand  side.  A  flourishing  domestic  PV
industry has developed in the large Indian market, and there is
long  term  experience  of  the  technology.  The  high  level  of
demand  for  electricity  in  those  areas  of  the  region  which  are
not connected to the grid, coupled with a domestic PV industry
and
conditions,  offer  excellent
opportunities  to  tap  the  vast  solar  electricity  potential.  The
most  difficult  issue  is  about  how  adequate  financing  is  made
available for PV systems to be installed in rural areas where per
capita income is very low.

favourable  operating

CASE STUDY: SOLAR GENERATION IN INDIA

The only country in Asia with a government department solely
devoted  to  the  promotion  and  support  of  renewable  energy,
India’s  national  energy  policy  is  to  achieve  a  10%  share  of
electricity from renewables by 2012.

Various  PV  incentives  have  been  introduced,  including  a  50%
capital  subsidy  for  solar  home  systems  and  subsidies  of  50%
and  67%  respectively  for  isolated  and  grid-connected  solar
power projects which do not exceed a capital cost of $ 5.50/Wp.
A solar lantern subsidy is also available of up to $ 42.

The Greenpeace/EPIA scenario is based on an average growth
rate  between  2000  and  2020  of  35%.  By  2020,  the  Indian  PV
market would have a market volume of more than $ 5 billion a
year.  If  all  the  systems  installed  were  manufactured  in  India
itself  this  would  add  a  further  roughly  80,000  jobs  to  the
112,870  expected  to  result  from  work  on  installation  and
maintenance.

 Government Policy and Programmes

The  Indian  government  needs  to  continue  demonstrating  its
commitment  to  mainstream  PV  by  providing  incentives  to
developers  and  manufacturers  of  the  technology.  It  should
establish  a  nationwide  support  scheme  with  the  aim  of
achieving equal market conditions throughout the country. The
national  agencies  should  also  look  towards  attracting  foreign
investment  either  through  independent  power  projects  or
public  sector  programmes  designed  specifically  for  PV.  One
further incentive would be the removal of all subsidies for fossil
fuel technologies.

East Asia

The East Asian market, currently quite small, is still expected to
be one of the key markets over the coming decades. Thailand
will be an important player in this region.

CASE STUDY: SOLAR GENERATION IN THAILAND

The Thai government supports the development of renewables
through its Energy Conservation Program. Financial incentives
are provided through subsidy schemes, including a 50% grant
towards  the  capital  cost  of  rooftop  PV  systems  during  a  pilot
phase. The National Energy Policy Office and the Department of
Energy Development and Promotion are also in the process of
preparing  a  National  Renewable  Energy  Policy  which  should
specify priorities and further support measures.

Total installed capacity of PV in Thailand is currently about 5
MW, with just 1 MW installed during 2003. To build up a stable
and  self-supporting  solar  PV  market  by  2010  a  support
programme is therefore needed. The Greenpeace/EPIA scenario

The  Energy  Department  recently  relaunched  the  rural
electrification programme called PERMER (Renewable Energies
Program for Rural Markets) funded by the World Bank and by
subsidies  from  the  GEF.  The  aim  is  to  invest  a  total  of  $ 59
million, with additional grants from the national and provincial
governments.

There has been no experience of PV installations connected to
the grid in Argentinian cities. Regulatory barriers and the lack
of  specific  incentives  to  promote  solar  power  have  so  far
inhibited  this  development.  A  pioneering  effort  to  spread  the
technology among architects and designers was made at a 1999
seminar in Buenos Aires, resulting in a design competition to
develop  examples  of  PV  integration  into  buildings  and  urban
spaces.

In  April  2001,  Greenpeace  unofficially  connected  the  first
photovoltaic generator to the grid in Argentina. This technically
illegal  installation  sparked  an  ongoing  discussion  about  the
technological  basis  for  a  future  national  regulation  allowing
connection  of
renewable  energy-powered
equipment to the grid.

In  the  same  year  Argentina  suffered  a  significant  economic
crisis,  with  an  extraordinary  depreciation  of  its  currency,
resulting  in  the  costs  of  PV  systems  rising  threefold.  For  this
reason  the  scenario  for  Argentina,  originally  compiled  before
the  economic  crisis,  has  been  changed.  To  build  up  a  solid
ongoing solar PV market in Argentina it is clear that a national
support programme is needed.

The  Greenpeace/EPIA  scenario  is  still  based  on  a  target  of  90
MWp of installed capacity by 2010. From then on, even with a
moderate growth rate of 30% between 2010 and the end of the
scenario period, the market in Argentina looks very promising.
With solid development over the succeeding years, the country
could achieve a 10% share of the Latin American market. Within
ten years this would create more than 3,800 jobs in installation
and  maintenance.  By  2020  more  than  14,000  jobs  could  be
expected  in  installation  and  maintenance,  with  additional
potential in manufacture and development.

is based on a target for 120 MW installed capacity by 2010. With
a market growth rate of 35% between 2010 and the end of the
scenario  period,  Thailand  could  become  one  of  the  most
important PV markets in the East Asia region. Within ten years,
this level of market development would create more than 1,000
jobs  in  installation  and  maintenance.  By  2020  more  than
20,000 jobs could be expected in installation and maintenance,
with additional potential in manufacture and development.

 Government Policy and Programmes

The  Thai  government  should  demonstrate  its  commitment  to
PV by providing incentives for developers and manufacturers.
An essential element of this would be a law similar to India’s
which removes all institutional, market and policy barriers to
the  operation  of  renewable  projects,  including  PV.  The  Thai
authorities should also investigate tapping foreign investment
through  private  or  public  sector  projects.  One  simple  step
would  be  to  capitalise  on  the  flourishing  overseas  tourism
industry by ensuring that all resorts and hotels are supplied by
solar electricity.

Latin America

CASE STUDY: SOLAR GENERATION IN ARGENTINA

Although  significant  regional  and  seasonal  differences  exist,
Argentina has a huge natural potential for solar energy use. The
central region of the country has an insolation of about 1,600
kWh/m2/year,  an  excellent  resource  compared  with  most
regions  of  Europe.  This  potential  remains  largely  untapped,
however, with installed capacity presently around 5 MWp.

So far, solar power use in Argentina has been mainly in isolated
areas,  for  example  for  telecommunications,  houses  without
electricity supply, water pumping, cathodic protection and sign
posting.  Rural  electrification  programs  have  been  supported
with funding from the World Bank and the Global Environment
Facility.  Despite  activity  in  this  area,  however,  there  still
remains a huge un serviced rural market.

According  to  the  Argentinian  Energy  Department,  5%  of  the
population  is  still  without  an  electricity  supply,  representing
about 1.8 million people or some 300,000 homes. At least 2,000
rural schools are estimated to operate without electricity.

Government Policy and Programmes

A  national  regime  for  grid  connected  renewable  systems,
including net metering and low interest credit for home solar
systems, is badly needed. This could be financed by switching
current subsidies for nuclear power to solar systems. A national
law needs to be passed in the National Congress to establish a
target for 8% of national electricity to come from renewables by
2013  -  a  target  already
in  the  government’s
International  Action  Plan  presented  at  Renewables  2004  in
Bonn.  Clean  energy  projects  such  as  solar  PV  should  also  be
made a priority for CDM investment under the Kyoto Protocol
mechanisms.

resources.  80%  of  the  Chinese  population  lives  in  rural  areas,
and 30 million people have no access to electricity. In 1998 the
government  announced  the  linking  of  three  state  agencies
involved  in  renewable  energy  -  the  Ministry  of  Science  and
Technology, the State Development and Planning Commission
and  the  State  Economic  and  Trade  Commission  -  to  work
together  on  a  programme  for  New  and  Renewable  Energy
Development in China up to 2010. Included in their targets is for
the  equivalent  output  from  4.67  million  tons  of  coal  to  be
produced by solar energy.

The  same  three  organisations  have  also  launched  a  PV
programme  know  as  the “Sunlight  Program”.  Operating  until
2010 this is expected to:

•
•

•
•

 Upgrade the country’s manufacturing capacity
 Establish large scale and PV-hybrid village power demonstration
systems
 Promote home PV projects for remote areas
 Integrate grid-connected PV projects

Besides  these  initiatives,  a  Global  Environment  Facility-World
Bank  renewables  development  programme  is  scheduled  to
support the installation of 200,000 solar home systems with a
total  capacity  of  10  MW.  China  had  already  installed  a
generation  capacity  of  about  42.5  MWp  by  the  end  of  2002,
distributed as follows:

Newly  installed  capacity  in  China  during  2004  is  expected  to
reach  approximately  35  MWp.  Within  the  programme  “Song
Dian  Dao  Xiang”  (sending  electricity  to  villages)  alone,  it  is
planned to install 100 - 150 MWp over the period 2005 to 2010.
This  programme  is  completely  initiated  and  funded  by  the
Chinese government.

In parallel to this, the Chinese PV industry is also growing. At
the  19th  European  Photovoltaic  Solar  Energy  Conference  and
Exhibition in June 2004, 32 companies and organisations from
China  were  represented.  Three  years  before,  only  two
companies were present.

In the Greenpeace/EPIA scenario China is expected to produce a
growth rate of about 30% over the next decade. This will rise to
45% between 2010 and 2020.

In 2020 the Chinese solar PV market could be the third largest
in the world, creating nearly 230,000 jobs in installation alone.
The  total  energy  output  in  2020  would  be  31.3  TWh,  the
equivalent  of  31  coal-fired  power  plants.  This  market  develop-
ment needs a strong and long-term support programme.

Government Policy and Programmes

As well as providing incentives to developers and manufacturers
of solar PV systems, the Chinese government should introduce
legislation  which  both  encourages  renewable  energy  sources
and removes all institutional, market and policy barriers to the
operation  of  PV  projects.  The  Sunlight  programme  should  be
expanded in order to play a more important role. China should
also  look  towards  more  pro-active  involvement  from  foreign
investors.

PART FIVE: WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE
SOLAR GENERATION

The rapid rise in the price of crude oil in 2004 and its subsequent
knock  on  effect  on  conventional  energy  costs  across  the
domestic  and  industrial  sectors  worldwide,  has  once  again
highlighted  the  urgent  need  for  both  industrialised  and  less
developed economies to rebalance their energy mix. This hike
in the oil price is not just the result of concerns about security of
supply,  but  also  of  rapidly  rising  demand  in  the  emerging
economies in Asia, particularly China. Production of “cheap” oil
can no longer expand at the same rate as the rise in demand. As
such, higher oil prices - and subsequently, higher energy prices
in general - are here to stay and world economies will have to
adjust to meet this challenge in order to grow.

It  is  in  this  climate  of  run  away  energy  pricing,  that  those
economies that have committed themselves to promoting the
uptake  of  solar  electricity  are  starting  to  differentiate
themselves  from  those  countries  that  have  relied  heavily  or
almost  exclusively  on  conventional  energy  sources.  There  are
clear signs that the next decade will seeing numerous countries
having to rapidly reduce their dependence on imported oil and
gas. This abrupt transition will particularly be accompanied by
significant  pain  in  those  countries  which  have  paid  little
attention  so  far  to  the  role  that  solar  electricity  can  play.
However  -  on  the  positive  side  -  there  is  still  time  for  these
economies to catch up if they now rapidly introduce innovative
policies to promote solar electricity use.

The speed with which the solar electricity sector is increasing
its  market  share  in  those  economies  that  have  committed
themselves  to  promote  this  clean  power  source,  coupled  with
the  transformation  of  its  customers  from  power  recipients  to
power generators, represents a revolution comparable to that in
the  telecommunications  market  over  the  past  decade.  Such
industrial revolutions give rise to both winners and losers.

The undisputed winners in such industrial revolutions are the
customers  who  have  access  to  greater  choice.  Other  winners
include the market players who recognise the potential of such
an  expanding  market,  and  those  who  have  committed
themselves to investment in the sector.

One of the main arguments heard from critics of solar electricity
is  that  its  costs  are  not  yet  competitive  with  those  of
conventional  power  sources.  Clearly  it  is  an  essential  goal  for
the  solar  industry  to  ensure  that  prices  fall  dramatically  over
the  coming  years  and  decades.  However,  there  are  many
examples  of  innovative  products  and  services  where  offering
customer  choice  has  led  to  their  popular  uptake  at  a  price
considerably higher than that previously available.

Two examples of such innovative market entrants are mobile
phones, offering a service at a far higher price than conventional
fixed line networks, and bottled mineral water, a product which
in the middle and higher price ranges costs more per litre than
petrol.  With  the  right  product,  therefore  -  offering  customers
the  type  of  added  value  they  are  looking  for,  coupled  with
innovative  marketing  -  technologies  such  as  solar  electricity
should  be  able  to  compete  with  grid  power  in  industrialised
countries.

The  extension  of  customer  choice  in  the  electricity  sector  to
embrace  solar  power,  however,  requires  a  commitment  to
creating  an  appropriate  framework  to  allow  consumers  to
access solar power in an efficient and cost-effective way.

PREMIUM FEED-IN TARIFF FOR SOLAR ELECTRICITY

On  the  support  side,  customers  must  not  be  penalised
financially  for  making  a  choice  to  be  supplied  by  solar
electricity. In most industrial countries, conventional electricity
is heavily subsidised, and the negative environmental impacts
of  its  production  are  not  reflected  in  the  cost  to  end  users.
Changes  to  this  system  appear  to  be  some  way  off  and  other
mechanisms  for  supporting  solar  power  must  meanwhile  be
promoted.

The rapid uptake of solar electricity in Germany has been the
result  of  the  introduction  of  a  national  feed-in  tariff  for  solar
electricity which offers customers an attractive price for selling
their produced electricity to the utility grid. A crucial element
of the German feed-in law is the fact that the tariff is set at the
point of connection to the grid and this level is guaranteed for
20 years. The fact that the lifetime of this tariff is clearly defined
at the outset offers customers planning security which makes
the installation of a solar electricity system so attractive. One
other crucial aspect of the German approach is that the cost of
the  feed-in  tariff  is  not  paid  by  the  government  through  a
subsidy,  but  is  rather  financed  by  a  small  surcharge  on  all
electricity users. This ensures that the scheme - once introduced
with  political  support  -  is  less  likely  to  become  a  political
football during times of budget reductions at the government
level.

The  success  of  the  German  feed-in  tariff  model  -  which  has
resulted  in  the  creation  of  a  large  number  of  new  jobs  in  the
solar  electricity  industry  -  is  now  being  adopted  in  other
countries in Europe. Extending such feed-in tariff mechanisms
beyond Germany is a cornerstone of the European Photovoltaic
Industry  Association’s  strategy  for  promoting  the  uptake  of
solar  electricity  in  Europe.  The  simplicity  of  the  feed-in  tariff
concept  and  its  low  administrative  costs  means  that  it  is  a
highly effective and efficient tool for boosting the role of solar
electricity in national energy mixes.

GUARANTEED GRID ACCESS

Given its major advantages for modern society, solar electricity
should be given priority and guaranteed access to the grid. In
many  countries  there  is  an  enormous  over-capacity  in
conventional  electricity  generation,  with  a  range  of  power
sources - from fossil fuels through to renewables - all jostling
for the right to be fed into the grid. Solar electricity generators
must be guaranteed automatic access, otherwise there is a risk
that they will be squeezed out of the market completely. While
instruments  such  as  the  European  Union’s  Directive  on
Renewable  Electricity  provide  for  priority  access  for  solar
power,  this  does  not  guarantee  that  solar  generators  will  be
able  to  sell  the  power  which  they  produce.  Given  the  still

achieve  a  sustainable  market  in  solar  electricity  in  the
industrialised world, that such access guarantees are a foremost
consideration.

NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Clearly,  just  as  with  other  emerging  technology  markets,
decisions  are  not  without  their  associated  financial  risks.  The
clear upward trend of current market developments, however,
points to major opportunities for both existing and new players
in the solar electricity sector. The expanding list of companies
and  consortia  currently  formulating  strategies  for  exploiting
the solar market is evidence of this.

For  the  market  really  to  take  off,  however,  the  pioneers  of
yesterday  who  have  evolved  into  the  market  leaders  of  today
must be joined by a widening industrial base so that the whole
sector  can  secure  the  business  successes  of  tomorrow,  the
potential for which has been mapped out in this report.

Entry  into  the  solar  electricity  market  is  not  the  preserve  of
companies only active in the clean energy sector. Many of the
leaders  in  the  solar  electricity  industry  were,  and  still  are,
leading lights in the “old” energy economy. These global players
have taken on board the challenge to integrate a solar electricity
business  into  a  traditional  energy  production  and  retail
structure. The sustained commitment of these companies will
be  appropriately  rewarded  if  we  create  the  right  climate  to
ensure  that  the  whole  solar  electricity  business  sector  moves
rapidly ahead.

Against  this,  there  are  also  potential  losers  in  the  energy
industry.  Amongst  these  are  those  companies  that  have
continued to focus solely on conventional energy technologies.
With no base or limited expertise available to them in the solar
sector, it will become increasingly difficult for these companies
to  benefit  from  the  expanding  photovoltaics  market.  Its
expected  growth  over  the  next  few  decades  will  rapidly
enhance  the  role  that  this  technology  will  play  in  the  energy
mix. For any organisation missing the boat, the consequences
could be similar to those for data processing companies which
failed  to  predict  the  impact  that  personal  computers  would
have on every aspect of business and domestic life in the 1980s.
Even  once  mighty  blue  chip  companies  such  as  IBM  are  still
trying to recover from a lack of vision at a critical moment.

GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY COMMITMENT

Governments  that  have  taken  steps  to  broaden  their  energy
supply  base  with  an  abundant  clean  technology  such  as
photovoltaics will also be able to count themselves among the
winners. Such diversification not only brings benefits in terms
of  greater  security  of  energy  supply  but  also  leads  to  wider
environmental  benefits  though  the  deployment  of  zero-
emission  technologies  which,  according  to  the  predictions
presented  here,  will  make  a  significant  impact  on  global  COc
emissions over the coming decades.

At present, the nations of the industrialised world vary greatly
in their commitment to solar electricity. While countries such
as Germany and Japan, as well as others in Europe, have moved
forward  from  discussion  to  implementing  the  necessary
support  schemes,  others  have  actually  cut  back  their  solar
electricity programmes. In the United States in particular, this
could severely affect the ability of the national solar electricity
industry to fulfil its promise as a global exporter providing for
sustainable employment at home.

Both industry and governments, however, will have to extend
their differing commitments to the solar sector if the potential
identified in this report is to be fully exploited. On the industry
side, continuing and accelerated investment in the expansion
of production facilities is needed in order to meet the demands
of  the  market  and  to  ensure  that  the  cost,  and  ultimately  the
price  of  the  technology,  is  brought  down  through  production
up-scaling and introduction of new manufacturing techniques
and materials. On the government side, the commitment to the
solar electricity sector in many countries needs to be extended.
Besides the introduction of net metering and premium tariffs,
building  regulations  need  to  be  adapted  to  provide  a  greater
incentive for the deployment of solar electricity systems in the
built environment.

Like  every  other  industry,  the  solar  electricity  sector  will  only
move forward if sufficient investment is committed to provide
for  its  expansion.  New  sources  of  equity  and  debt  financing
need to be tapped. Such investment opportunities must attract
new  entrants  to  the  sector  from  financial  institutions  which
have been made aware of the potential of the solar electricity
business. It is significant, for example, that investment in solar
production and supply companies is being taken increasingly
seriously  by  international  investment  analysts,  while  the
influential  Economist  magazine  has  portrayed  solar  cells  as
part of a new “micropower” revolution.

In  summary,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  global  electricity
business  will  undergo  a  significant  expansion  over  the  next
few decades. All indicators point in that direction. Solar power
will certainly play an ever more significant role in the supply
mix. However, the extent to which solar electricity will make its
impact on that market will depend very much on ensuring that
the potential winners in this business are made fully aware of
the opportunities available.

Those opportunities will only be realised if both industry and
governments  continue  to  strengthen  their  commitment  to
broadening  the  energy  supply  base  and,  through  the
deployment  of  solar  electricity  technologies,  offering  greater
choice  to  customers.  This  will  have  the  added  effect  of
demystifying  the  energy  process,  offering  individuals  greater
control over the provision of their electricity needs. This in itself
constitutes a revolution in the energy market.
