Summary and introduction

In 2001 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) published the last comprehensive
assessment of knowledge about global warming.
In one area there was a particular black hole.
“Estimates of the costs of adaptation are few,” said
the Synthesis of its Third Assessment Report.
Partly the reason for this is because, as the IPCC
says, “the available estimates indicate that costs are
highly sensitive to decision criteria for… specific
adaptation measures.”

The other reason is possibly one of embarrassment.
First, because governments in rich countries are still
withholding from the general public the full scale of the
changes needed to both stop and live with climate
change. And, secondly, because of the pitifully small
resources that are being made available by rich countries
that created the problem, to poor countries who will suffer
it first and worst. The clearest indication of this is the large
sums of money, hidden across countless different
government budget lines, being spent by rich countries to
adapt at home to the global warming that is already
inevitable.

Such a gap between rhetoric, obligation and reality is not
new.

In 1992, at the original Earth Summit, the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) was
signed along with the detailed general programme of
action Agenda 21. Inconveniently for politicians today,
because it gives us all a ruler with which to measure our
governments’ response, the secretariat of the Earth
Summit put a price on what it would cost to implement the
new environmental agreements and meet their targets:

“Implementing Agenda 21 in low-income countries
would cost an average of more than US$600
billion annually between 1993 and 2000, of which
$125 billion would have to come in the form of
international donations or concessions.”

But even in the euphoric atmosphere and optimism of the
end of the Cold War, aid didn’t go up, it went down. And
the downturn began immediately after the Earth Summit

in the period 1992–94. The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that
the cumulative shortfall from 1992–98, based on the level
that aid would have reached if earlier trends had
continued, was $88.7 billion. In 1998 alone the shortfall
on the prior trend was $21 billion. In just one example, an
extra three billion ECU promised at the time by the
European Commission simply failed to materialise.1

Today, still no estimate has been made of what it will
cost the majority world to adapt to global warming. The
few lines of international assistance that do exist
developed from arrangements made at the time of the
Earth Summit.

The main conduit of funds set up at the time dedicated
to sustainable development was the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), operated jointly by the World Bank, the
UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and the
UNDP (United National Development Programme). The
GEF now administers three new funds under the Climate
Convention and Kyoto Protocol – a special climate
change fund, a least-developed-countries’ fund and an
adaptation fund. In the year 1999–2000, GEF funding for
climate change was $1.4 billion. Of this, only $199 million
was grant funding; the rest was leveraged through
co-financing.

In Marrakech in 2001 at the seventh Conference of the
Parties to the climate convention (COP7) rich countries
committed themselves to provide $ 0.41 billion per year
by 2005 to help developing countries “manage their
emissions and adapt to climate change”.2 Since then,
however, only about $0.02 billion has been found. But

even the larger figure looks modest compared to the
annual subsidy given by rich countries to their own,
heavily polluting, fossil fuel industries, conservatively
estimated at around $73 billion per year for the late
1990s.3 And, compared to the scale of the problem, even
the committed funds look hopelessly inadequate. As the
official US Global Change Research Information Office
points out:

“It is estimated that with 1.0 metre sea-level rise,
protection of the vulnerable portion of the
coastline of Dar es Salaam would cost US$380
million and protecting the populated coastline of
Tanzania would cost US$14.6 billion.”4

Wealthy members of the international community,
overwhelmingly responsible for current global warming,
are obliged by international legal norms and moral codes
to meet much of the cost of the problem in poor
countries. This briefing illustrates their chronic failure yet
to do so. It also reveals the current ‘I’m all right Jack’
approach by showing some of the projected costs for
adaptation measures planned or underway in the
industrialised world. Though not directly comparable for a
number of reasons, these examples highlight the
unacknowledged scale and cost of the challenge facing
poor countries. They show a wealthy minority casting the
rest of the world adrift amidst a problem they had no role
in creating. The IPCC comments that “there are few
comprehensive estimates of the costs of adaptation.”
Even so, compared to the sums on offer from rich to poor
countries, in just one case the cost of maintaining the
functions of Japanese infrastructure alone against a one-
metre rise in sea level is estimated to be between 11.5
and 20 trillion yen (roughly £65–100 billion).5 Ironically,

estimates show that in the US, energy demand would
increase significantly to help adapt to climate change.
The cost of meeting the higher demand might be
between $200 and $300 billion, with annual costs rising
by $33–73 billion.6

A note on blurred definitions
This briefing gathers together many of the general
estimates and several specific examples of measures to
adapt to global warming. But the difference between
spending on mitigation – measures to curb greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions and arrest the problem – and
adaptation – measures designed to help us live with now
inevitable change – is not always clear-cut. For example,
a deliberate shift towards low-input sustainable
agriculture could both reduce the fossil fuel intensity of
farming and increase crop resilience in the face of
extreme weather. It would be a case of simultaneous
mitigation and adaptation. The field then does not always
have clear boundary markers. To isolate spending on
adaptation is notoriously difficult. It can, for example, get
swept up in the costs of post-disaster reconstruction. For
example, how much of the money spent in Germany to
clean up after severe flooding in 2002 which required
about 17,000 people to be evacuated, could be called
spending on adaptation?7 Across the rest of Europe the
flooding affected over 600,000 people and cost at least
$15 billion. Or, similarly, how much of the money that
went to reorganize health and social services in Europe
following more than 20,000 deaths from the freak
heatwave of 2003 could be called adaptation spending?

Cast adrift

For one big reason, forcing a distinction between the
cost implications of either can be counter-productive.
Whilst mitigation and adaptation might seem expensive
in the short-to-medium term, the failure to do either will
mean much greater, and possibly incalculable, cost in
the long-term.

The UNEP’s Finance Initiative estimates that on current
trends, worldwide economic losses due to natural
disasters – the vast majority being hydro-meteorological
and therefore directly affected by climate change – will
hit $150 billion per year in the next decade: roughly three
times the size of the global aid budget. As a former
director of one of the world’s largest insurance
companies, CGNU, Andrew Dlugolecki did his own sums
and came to an even more dramatic conclusion.
Comparing annual average economic growth figures with
a linear projection of rising climate-related damages, he
concluded that by about 2065 damages would exceed
gross world income. In other words, climate change will
have bankrupted the global economy. The important
thing, then, is action. Action to stop climate change, but
not to ignore that for many people living in resource-poor
countries ‘dangerous’ climate change is already with us.
And, at the moment, these people are being cast adrift
and left to sink by rich countries in a warming world.

Climate change adaptation costs for
industrialised countries

Wildly varying estimates exist for what it will cost rich
countries to adapt to climate change. Even when it
comes to the more direct costs of implementing the
Kyoto Protocol, the estimate for the European Union
ranges from about €4 billion to €30 billion per year.

General cost estimates
The reason that even this better-studied area is so
fraught with difficulty is summed up by the European
Environment Agency (EEA):

“Important factors that influence the estimates
include differences in cost definitions and
baseline scenarios, the assumed effectiveness of
policies and measures for reduction of emissions,
and the greenhouse gases that have been taken
into account (only carbon dioxide or all gases).
A further important factor is different assumptions
about using the Kyoto mechanisms: joint
implementation, clean development mechanism,
emissions trading and the EU internal emissions
trading scheme.”8

Putting difficulties in finding the right numbers aside,
Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the
EEA concludes:

“The substantial financial costs for Europe’s
economy, people and ecosystems means
everyone has to play a role and take account of
climate change in their policy decisions…
strategies are needed, at European, regional,
national and local level, to adapt to climate
change.” 9

The range of adaptation challenges in Europe, even with
all its enormous economic resources, is huge. They
include:

(cid:1) More frequent and costly storms, floods, droughts and

other extreme weather hitting every aspect of
peoples’ livelihoods and the economy.

(cid:1) Wetter conditions in northern Europe but drier weather

in the south threatening agriculture.

(cid:1) More frequent and more intense heatwaves, a proven

and fatal threat to the elderly and frail.

(cid:1) Melting glaciers, with three-quarters of those in the
Swiss Alps likely to disappear by 2050, which will
change the face of Europe.

(cid:1) Rising sea levels threatening major infrastructure for

centuries to come.

According to the EEA, two-thirds of catastrophic events
since 1980 have been climate-driven by floods, storms,
droughts or heatwaves. Such disasters doubled during
the 1990s compared to the 1980s and now cost around
$11 billion annually and account for 79 per cent of
economic losses from catastrophic events.10 The annual
cost of adaptation in Canada was put at $11.6 billion by
one 1999 study.11

Table 1 shows the range of adaptation strategies needed
by Europe.

Insurance and business at risk
Climate change will necessarily have a growing impact
on all economic sectors – an impact that is currently
going largely unaddressed. The extent of the ‘value at
risk’ from climate change could be as much as
15 per cent of the total market capitalisation of major

companies12 – potentially some £165 billion of the
market capitalisation of companies on the FTSE All Share
Index.13 Failure to address the potential risks associated
with climate change, which are faced by every business
and investment portfolio, raises serious questions about
the proper exercise of corporate governance and
fiduciary duty. In addition, the failure of firms to report on
their exposure to climate-related risk is creating a
perverse incentive for investment in carbon intensive
industries.14 In one sense, the very scale of value
potentially at risk means that the cost of corporate re-
engineering to reduce that risk might appear to be
negligible or negative in the long term. But corporations
exist in the here and now and, initially, adapting to global
warming is going to cost.

The risks to business from climate change fall into two
broad categories. First there are the direct impacts from
climate change in the form of flood damage resulting
from rising sea levels, changing weather patterns and
singular extreme weather events. Then there are the
indirect risks associated with changing factor prices,
demand conditions, policy changes resulting from carbon

mitigation schemes (such as carbon emissions trading
schemes, climate change levy etc.), political unrest,
international conflict, risk to reputation and risk of litigation.

More immediate risks to business are, however, posed
by the indirect effects of climate change. These include,
but are not limited to, the introduction of carbon taxes
and carbon trading regimes for large GHG emitters, plus
the change in factor prices which will result from these
additional costs. A recent Royal Society report promoting
the replacement of the Climate Change Levy with a
carbon tax, estimates that to reduce emissions in line
with the UK’s Kyoto commitment would require a 10 per
cent increase in the price of petrol and a 15 per cent
increase in the price of electricity.15 If this relatively
modest measure were to be taken up, adaptation in the
business sector would mean having to rework their
accounts to absorb such price rises.

A 15 per cent increase in the price of electricity, based
on 2002 data, would represent an annual cost of more
than £2 billion (see Table 2), just under half of it falling on
the private sector, and slightly more falling on
households.16

In a theme which keeps repeating itself, the most striking
insight is the degree to which business is flying blind
about the likely impacts of across-the-board adaptation.
The IPO (initial public offering) by company Xstrata is a
case in point. This major coal mining firm’s Listing
Particulars runs to 500 pages and yet climate change
issues receive only a fleeting mention in two paragraphs.
Significantly no mention is made of emissions restrictions
or carbon tax or any other element of climate-related risk
when discussing “Factors affecting the Business”.
Although from the statements that are included, such as:
“Commodity prices are significantly affected by changes
in global economic conditions and related industry
cycles” and “Prices of commodity products… can vary
significantly when supply and demand fluctuate” the
section is rather short on useful information of any sort.
Xstrata had to defend itself against criticism for its lack of
disclosure following the announcement by the Japanese
Government that it intended to impose a levy on coal as
part of its commitment to reduce GHG emissions. Xtrata
plc’s share price fell 9 per cent in the space of an hour of
this news and traded at a low of 490p, over
40 per cent below its price on flotation.17 This information
should not, however, have come as a surprise to Xstrata,
since Japan, one of Xstrata’s main customers, is a Kyoto
signatory with a commitment to reducing carbon
emissions by 8 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2012.

Similarly Alcan, in a Listing related to its merger with the
Alusuisse group, did not find space to discuss its CO2
emissions, other than in the context of the potential
increased demand for the aluminium that would be
required by automotive manufactures to reduce weight
and increase efficiency in response to concerns about
CO2 emissions.18 This ignored the fact that aluminium
production is a particularly intense source of GHGs, and
highly vulnerable to emissions legislation as a result.

Legal adaptation
Yet another adaptation cost comes from the potential for
legal liability, as those affected by climate change seek
redress in the courts from those they view as responsible.
As scientific predictions on global climate change become
more certain, and courts become more willing to hear
cases from overseas parties, these risks may increase.

Already action is being brought before the US courts by
Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the City of Boulder
Colorado against the US Government. The plaintiffs claim
that two government agencies – the Export-Import Bank
of the United States (Ex-Im) and the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC) – have invested millions
of dollars in overseas fossil fuel projects thereby
contributing to global warming in contravention of the
National Environmental Policy Act.

Increasingly there is the potential for companies to face
lawsuits similar to those that have affected the tobacco

and asbestos industries, particularly where companies
are open to accusations of negligence in the face of
clear scientific evidence. Parallels have been drawn, for
example, between tobacco companies who knew of
tobacco’s addictive properties yet made claims to the
contrary, and oil companies – specifically Exxon – who
have consistently attempted to undermine scientific
findings on climate change.19

With the Kyoto Protocol now cleared to enter into force,
there could be a logical adaptation and application of
international economic rules. Outgoing EU Trade
Commissioner Pascal Lamy indicated recently that
businesses of non-ratifying countries like the US could be
subjected to new trade restrictive measures from other
trading nations who have ratified the Protocol, in the
name of levelling the economic playing field.

There have already been clear hints from Pascal Lamy,
outgoing EU Trade Commissioner, that Europe feels well
within its rights to use economic measures against
America. The most likely economic weapons would be
so-called ‘counter-subsidy’ measures or ‘border tax
adjustments’. Both are acceptable in international trade
where environmental agreements like Kyoto have been
negotiated in good faith. In direct response to such a
proposal, Pascal Lamy’s reply was an example of the art
of ‘denial, non-denial’. It was a “thought provoking
contribution”, he said, though at the time
“counterproductive” to contemplate trade action while the
EU was persuading Russia to ratify Kyoto. But then he
wrote, “There is a clear case for being aware of any
adverse effects on our industry and doing everything in
our power to minimize these”, and further, “In that sense
it is relevant also to keep under review the scope for
action under WTO rules to ‘level the playing field’.”

Reputation risk
An area in which companies have not been slow to
recognise the risk to their immediate future is in relation
to the threat to their reputation and the threat to carefully

cultivated brand images. As the example of ExxonMobil
illustrates, it can be very damaging to brand image, sales
and thereby market values to be seen as ‘environmental
enemy No.1’ – some estimates have put the value at risk
from the ‘Stop Esso’ campaign at 10 per cent of its
market value. With consumers increasingly willing to join
in campaigns to boycott a company’s products,
companies are increasingly careful to appear sensitive to
environmental issues.

Indeed the cynic might suggest that the vast majority of
corporate initiatives on climate change and
environmental concerns generally are mere window
dressing aimed at mitigating just this type of risk. BMW,
as a single example among many, makes much in its
advertising and marketing literature of its commitment to
and investments in fuel cell technology. Yet to date, not a
single vehicle is in production. The global value of
climate-focused cause-related marketing might be seen
as another adaptation cost.

Such figures are not available but Exxon, for example,
announced a $100 million endowment to Stanford
University for climate research, particularly technological
solutions. Many observers have suggested that this is
more of an attempt to buy back some of the reputation
lost through involvement in opposition to the climate
change debate rather than a genuine acceptance that the
company’s future may depend on such research activities.

Insurance
More than many other sectors, the insurance industry is at
the cutting edge of economic adaptation to climate
change. Global firms like Swiss Re and Munich Re

Cast adrift

provide much of the original data on the economic costs
of extreme weather events. From the household level to
global agricultural production it is through insurance that
the true costs of adaptation are most likely to be revealed.

Insurance estimates and rising dividend payments may
also provide the missing link in bringing legal claims for
compensation into the heart of the global warming issue.
For example, when massive flooding hit Germany in the
summer of 2002, interior ministry officials estimated the
damage at €9 billion. One-third of a million people were
affected. In 2003, heatwaves in Paris killed more than
11,000 people above the seasonal average, leaving
countless aggrieved relatives. And the only thing holding
back court claims has been the problem of attribution.

Looking at how the insurance market works for science
journal Nature, Myles Allen from the physics department
at Oxford University suggests that problem is now largely
solved. “All you have to do”, he writes, “is work out a
‘mean likelihood-weighted liability’ by averaging over all
possibilities consistent with currently available
information.” Unpacked, that means that if past GHG
emissions increase flood risk tenfold, and a flood
happens, 90 per cent of subsequent damages can be
attributed to past emissions. Because carbon dioxide
mixes itself in the global commons of the atmosphere,
“an equitable settlement would apportion liability
according to emissions”.20

As the Association of British Insurers (ABI) points out:

“Climate change is not a remote issue for future
generations to deal with. It is, in various forms, here
already, impacting on insurers’ businesses now.”

The sector’s response gives a window on private sector
adaptation. It reports the main ways in which climate
change currently affects the insurance business:21

(cid:1) Changing customer needs, requiring new underwriting
skills as customers seek to limit new liabilities arising
from climate change regulation, or exploit new assets.

(cid:1) Changing patterns of claims, principally on the

household, property and business interruption accounts.

(cid:1) New and tightening regulation, driving business costs

and, increasingly, impacting on the investment
environment.

(cid:1) A source of reputational risk, requiring the industry to
communicate effectively with customers, government
and other stakeholders, so that they understand the
financial consequences of climate change, the
options for managing these and the response of the
industry to these challenges.

The ‘risk transfer mechanisms’ of insurance are likely to be
applied in various ways to deal with their increasing
exposure to extreme weather; to insure new technologies,
such as renewable energy assets; and to manage new
liabilities like directors being held responsible for the
environmental impact of their businesses in the future.

For Britain alone, the ABI reports that weather risks are
increasing by 2–4 per cent per year for households and
other property due to changing weather. Claims for storm
and flood damages doubled to over £6 billion between
1998 and 2003, compared to the previous five years.
Other insurance areas that saw rising claims from
climate-related effects including rising motor insurance
claims, and human health effects that could “influence
the balance between state and private provision of health
care and pension products”. Overall, for the industry, with
damages hitting $150 billion per year in 10 years,
insurers stand to be hit with at least $30–40 billion in
claims annually.22

Insurance premiums are the reverse side of the coin of
climate-related damage costs. They are deliberately long-
term, so they are likely to represent a significant
adaptation cost. As we are locked into an inescapable
degree of climate change over the next 30–40 years due
to past emissions of greenhouse gases, the insurance
cost for particularly vulnerable infrastructure and sectors
will continue to rise.

After flooding in autumn 2000, £25 million extra motor
claims were made. Without further action, the ABI
estimates that river and coastal flooding damages could
increase from £1 billion per year to £20 billion per year.

It’s increasingly evident following several severe flooding
incidents in Europe and the United States that climate
change will have a significant impact on the built
environment.

According to the UK Government, the value of domestic
property with a current one per cent risk of flooding is
estimated at £200 billion. Floods in the winter of 2000/1
were estimated to have cost the insurance industry £750
million.23 Box 1 indicates the comprehensive range of
threats and likely measures needed for adaptation.
There are enormous difficulties, and several unknowable
factors, in estimating what the cost of adapting existing
building stock, and ‘climate proofing’ new buildings will be.

But, as an example of what such costs might be, one
analysis by British-based environmental consultants ERM
gives an indication. Technical problems with dealing with
economic, environmental and political variables, and the
clash between climatic uncertainties and the ‘need for
precision in defining design specifications for
infrastructure’ means the cost estimates are given over a
fairly wide range. Their conclusion was that Britain would
face a 1–5 per cent increase on current building costs
adding up to £26 billion ‘aggregated over the entire
building stock’. This estimate excludes the cost of
adapting new-build commercial stock.24

If the estimate of 1–5 per cent of construction costs as
additional costs for adaptation to climate change in the
UK is broadly representative of other OECD countries, this
would suggest adaptation costs in this sector in the order
of US$15–74 billion per annum for OECD countries as a
whole, around one-third of this arising in the US, and
one-fifth in Japan.

Investments in early warning systems
and weather forecasting
Catalysed by the progress of global warming, major new
investments are being made in climate warning and
weather forecasting systems. At the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US they believe they
are close to finding the ‘Holy Grail of climate science’. A
joint project potentially to be launched with NASA will be

Box 1: Climate change impacts on buildings and adaptation

Problem: Flooding of buildings will be more common
under climate change. Flooding leads to damage of
building contents, possible contamination from sewage,
and structural collapse. Some buildings could become
uninsurable if they are in particularly flood-prone areas.

Adaptation: Flooding can be avoided by careful siting of
buildings, and buildings can be protected by
embankments, or designed to minimise damage, e.g.
using water-resistant materials.

Problem: Increased rates of coastal erosion, due to sea-
level rise and storm surges, can have catastrophic
consequences for buildings in vulnerable locations.

Adaptation: Improving coastal defences can alleviate local
problems, but they need to be carefully sited to avoid
adverse consequences at adjacent areas of the coast.

Problem: Subsidence is expected to increase in buildings
on clay soils, due to higher temperatures, lower summer
rainfall, and increased evapo-transpiration.

Adaptation: New buildings should include improved
foundation design. Underpinning would reduce the
effects of subsidence in existing buildings.

Problem: If climate change leads to more frequent
depressions (storms), there will be increased structural
damage to buildings.

Problem: Increased driving rain will occur, affecting
building facades and internal structures and lead to more
rain penetration around openings. More intense rainfall
events could lead to drainage systems (including roof
drainage, sewer systems, carriageway drainage etc.)
being unable to cope.

Problem: Higher ground temperatures would lead to
ground contaminants becoming more active, and
consequently attacking foundations. Climate change will
affect the durability of materials – in some cases the
impacts may be helpful, while others will be detrimental.

Problem: Climate change is expected to reduce summer
rainfall, so that pressures on water resources are likely to
increase.

Problem: Higher summer temperatures could lead to a
significant increase in the demand for air conditioning in
buildings, and hence in higher summer energy demand.

Problem: Flooding on site is expected to become more
common.

Adaptation: The level of damage could be reduced if
more buildings were built to regulatory standards than is
the case at present. Higher building standards may be
needed in future, but careful design can also reduce the
aerodynamic load on a building. For existing buildings, the
options are more limited, and in some cases, retrofit of
new roofs might need to be considered.

Adaptation: Drainage systems and drainage design
standards may need upgrading. Attenuation measures for
dealing with surface water runoff, e.g. through the use of
sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS), lagoons,
and soakaways should be promoted.

Further research is needed.

Adaptation: Planning for new developments, particularly
intensive water users, will need to consider whether water
resources can meet their requirements and should aim to
improve water use efficiency.

Adaptation: Air conditioning should be seen as a ‘last
resort’ adaptation option. More favourable options are to
design-in more shading and natural ventilation, and to
increase the thermal mass of a building.

Adaptation: The construction process could adapt to the
impacts, however – for instance by increasing
prefabrication.

Problem: When a building regulation comes up for
review, it is examined to see where it may be necessary
to revise the technical requirements, in the light of climate
change.

Adaptation: Changes to building standards, codes and
regulations will help to avoid the worst potential impacts of
climate change, but dissemination to industry of information
about climate change impacts is also important.

Benefit and problem: Higher winter temperatures under
climate change would help reduce the UK’s death rate
from hypothermia, and decrease winter energy
consumption. However, milder, more humid winters will
lead to more mould growth in housing, which is already a
major course of respiratory allergies.

Benefit and problem: The implications of climate change
for the construction process are in some cases, in the
short term, beneficial: less working days would be lost, as
less snow and frost occur, but workers will be more likely
to suffer heat stress in summer.

The United States
In the US, there are roughly 20,000 km (12,000 miles) of
coastline and more than 32,000 km2 of coastal wetlands.
The land area of coastal counties comprises about 25
per cent of the total land area of the United States, and
accounted for 53 per cent of the US population (141
million people) in 1997. The size of the coastal zone
potentially at risk from sea-level rise is enormous and
could have disastrous consequences.

Estimates of the cost of adapting to a half-metre sea-
level rise in the US have ranged from $20 billion to $138
billion, where the southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts are
the most vulnerable. One estimate of the financial cost of
protecting all developed areas from a half-metre sea-
level rise is $50–66 billion, with $115–174 billion for a
one-metre rise.29 Another estimate comes from a recent
OECD paper, which projects that the costs of adapting to
a one-metre sea-level rise would amount to $156 billion,
representing three per cent of GNP.30

Not adapting has also proved costly. In 1993, for example,
water flows in the Mississippi and Missouri watershed
exceeded all measures ever recorded, leaving a bill for
damages of between $12 billion and $16 billion.31 Not
surprisingly, insurance prices for coastal properties have
followed suit and are increasing at a higher rate than the
value of all insured US properties. Between 1988 and
1993, the total value of insured property in coastal
counties from Maine to Texas increased by 69 per cent,
from $1.9 trillion to $3.15 trillion.32 Roughly 1,500 homes
per year will be lost to coastal erosion for several
decades, at a cost to property owners of $530 million. It is
estimated that a half-metre sea-level rise by 2100 could
cause cumulative impacts to US coastal property of
$20–150 billion, without even including the prospects of
increased storm frequency or intensity.33

Europe
A recent report from the European Commission highlights
the 132,300 km under the direct threat of coastal erosion
in the enlarged EU.34 Roughly one-third of this area is
rich in biodiversity and represents important ecosystems.
Most of these sites are part of the EU’s NATURA 2000
network of protected areas. The total value of economic
assets located in the threatened area, which includes
beaches, agricultural land and industrial facilities, is
between €500 billion and €1,000 billion.

The report shows that 875 km of the enlarged EU
coastline started to erode within the past 20 years and
that the adaptation costs are increasing: in 2001 they
were estimated to be €3.2 billion.35

used to measure soil moisture which they describe as
“data needed to predict global change, assess global
warming and support the Kyoto Protocol”. The project is
costing $218 million to design, build and launch.
Such initiatives are key to adapting to the increasingly
volatile weather patterns associated with climate change.
Without them, vital economic sectors like agriculture
become more vulnerable.

Citing the drought in the US Midwest in 1988 which
started in a small area, the MIT team explains how, “the
soil became dry and there was less evaporation, which
meant less precipitation. Soon, crops and cattle were dying
as the drought spread. The opposite happened in 1993,
when the Mississippi River flooded for weeks on end.”

Amongst industrialised countries, Canada has done more
work than most to address the issue of adaptation. The
government body Environment Canada estimates that
$150 billion of their nation’s economy is weather-
sensitive.25 The observed rise in the number of weather-
related disasters has led to significant investment in
adaptation and forecasting.

Of actual spending on ‘Weather and Environmental
Predictions’ in the year 2002/3, $188.3 million (73 per
cent) went to reducing the impact of weather and related
hazards on health, safety and the economy, and $71
million (27 per cent) went on adaptation to day-to-day
and longer-term changes in atmospheric, hydrological
and ice conditions.

An innovative scheme in Britain called U R @ RISK
promoted by the official body, the Environment Agency,
in collaboration with the Met Office, involves sending
flood warnings to people by mobile phone text message,
e-mail and through the digital TV sets.26 The scheme is
funded by £2.7million of government money and has a
target to “deliver effective and timely flood warnings to
80 per cent of those at risk by 2010”. The Agency and
Met Office also contribute their own funds to the £3.9
million total cost of the project over two years. Total
spending on flood management by central and local
government in the UK was budgeted at £492 million for
2004/5 and £550 million in 2005/6.27

Sea and river defences
The impact of climate change on sea and river levels is
one of the areas that policy-makers have not been able
to ignore, due to the imminent threat to important
infrastructure and housing. The most apparent cases are
small islands under threat, but there are also some
considerable losses to be made by not protecting the
shores from mounting water levels in OECD countries.

In the past century, the sea level rose by between 0.8 mm
per year and 3.0 mm per year in Europe, and it is expected
to continue to rise. Between 1990 and 2100 the projected
rate of sea-level rise is between 2.2 and 4.4 times higher
than the rate in the twentieth century.28

Overall, some 12,200 km of the EU’s coastline is eroding –
nearly one-fifth of the total – the worst affected countries
(in absolute terms) being Greece, the UK and Italy. If the
costs of coastal protection in the EU were similar to those
for the US, estimated at $500–2,600 per metre (but much
more for sea walls and bulkheads whose price range
goes up to $13,200 per metre),36 the overall cost would
be between $6 billion and $32 billion (see Table 5).

There are numerous other ‘spot’ costs and estimates that
have been made. This is a selection.

(cid:1) Italy — The high economic value of the Italian coast
makes it particularly vulnerable to sea-level rises. If
the sea rises by 100 cm by 2100, Italy will need to
protect almost its entire coast. One way of doing this
would be to reconstruct the pre-existing dune as a
first barrier to sea-level rise, which would cost about
€30–50 million. In addition, houses worth €30–50
million would need to be demolished and there are
also other additional costs, where no cost estimate is
available.38 The present value of the area at risk of
permanent flooding between 2002 and 2100 varies
from €130 million to €270 million.39

(cid:1) The Netherlands — The Netherlands has already

suffered from substantial flooding damages, and the
potential for more is huge. Estimates show that losses in

the order of €100 billion resulting from sea floods and
€50 billion for river floods are conceivable. Relatively
minor river flooding in December 1993 (loss of €100
million) and January 1995 resulted in total losses of
€180 million. In September 1998, heavy rainfall
occurred which caused losses of some €500 million.40

A staggering 67 per cent of the population in The
Netherlands would be affected by a one-metre sea-
level rise. To protect the affected area would cost
about $12 billion, or 5 per cent of GNP.41 Some
staggering amounts have already been paid or are
projected for protection against flooding. The
construction of embankments in the province of
Limburg in 1995 ended up costing about €80 million.
The costs of flood protection of the Zandmaas/
Maasroute have been estimated between €380
million and €1,045 million.42

However, the concern is not just about rising sea
levels. Climate change could enhance the risk of
persistent drought, with corresponding low water
levels. This could have substantial effect on transport,
which could lead to a 10 per cent increase in
transport costs by 2050. The annual costs of transport
on the River Rhine could rise with between €80
million and €600 million.43

(cid:1) UK — There are approximately 21 million properties in

England and Wales, of which around 1.8 million
homes and 130,000 commercial properties are at risk
from inland or coastal flooding, along with 5 million
people. Together with agricultural land at risk, these
represent assets in the region of £220 billion.44

Over the past 6 years, storm and flood losses in the
UK have exceeded £6 billion – twice the previous
period. The Government’s Foresight report shows that
if no action is taken against climate change, the
annual average damages from river and coastal
flooding could increase from the current figure of £1
billion to between £2 billion and £21 billion. The
increasing risk posed by coastal erosion is the main
driver behind increased national flood risk.45

The risk is now so high that the ABI is worried about
being able to cope. The Environment Agency will object
to any planning application that is not accompanied by
its own Flood Risk Assessment in local authority areas
that are not guided by a Strategic Flood Risk
Assessment. The lack of an appropriate Flood Risk
Assessment currently accounts for over half of all
sustained objections from the Agency. The targeting of
new developments in Thames Gateway has led to
time-consuming and costly processes for individual
developers, costing around £50,000 per assessment.46

The Environment Agency has estimated that the
costs of upgrading the Thames’ flood defences could
be between £4 billion and £6 billion over the next 20
years. However, these figures are likely to be grossly
underestimated, as they have been calculated without
incorporating any impacts of climate change on

present-day storm-surge heights.47 DEFRA
(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs)
has a long-term strategy to invest about £5 billion in
coastal infrastructure between 2000 and 2015.48

However, despite the scale of these figures, the ABI is
concerned that it is not enough. For example, it points
out that the £4–6 billion required to fund the upgrade in
flood defences for the Thames Estuary over the next 20
years would take over half the national flood defence
budget if no contribution from new developments were
included. The Government’s Foresight report suggests
that a real increase in expenditure of £10 million to £30
million each year would be required to manage flood
risk over the century and that by 2020, expenditure
would need to be closer to £1 billion per year.

(cid:1) Germany, Japan, and Poland — The adaptation/

protection cost for Germany for a one-metre sea-level
rise is estimated at $23.5 billion, which represents
2.2 per cent of GNP.49

The adaptation/protection cost for Japan for a one-
metre sea-level rise is estimated at up to $156 billion,
representing up to 12 per cent of GNP.50 The total
expenditure to keep the present level of functions and
stability for about 1,000 Japanese ports is estimated
to be $110 billion in the event of a one-metre sea-
level rise.51

The adaptation/protection cost for Poland for a one-
metre sea-level rise is estimated at up to $1.4 billion,
representing 2 per cent of GNP.52

Drainage
Drainage costs, due to rising sea levels around Italy are
estimated between €50 million and €100 million. This is
cheaper than doing nothing, as potential damages are
estimated at €130 million to €270 million, although it is
believed that the adaptation cost is reasonably low, as the
drainage system is already developed and works well.53

The ABI has pointed out that it is essential that UK water
companies be allowed to raise the necessary funds
(£1.2 billion according to their draft business plans) to
maintain and improve their assets to reduce the
incidence of sewer flooding.54

In Toronto, Canada, adaptation costs for wastewater
treatment are estimated between CAN$633 million and
CAN$9.4 billion, depending on risk aversion, while those
for Niagara are CAN$8–24 million, Halifax and Penticton
are estimated at CAN$8–14 million, around CAN$6.5
million and CAN$15–28.5 million respectively. However,
no adaptation costs are anticipated in Montreal or
Yellowknife.55

Based on draining projects in the Ottawa area, it is
estimated that each 5 per cent increase in rainfall intensity
increases the cost of pipes by 4–8 per cent and the cost
of end-of-pipe storage by between 10 and 35 per cent.56

The cost of adapting the drainage system in the Fondi plain
in Italy to an expected rise in the sea level is estimated at
€50–100 million over the course of the next century.57

Health
While no comprehensive picture exists for health
adaptation costs, indications can be drawn from related
experiences. But changes to extreme weather patterns
and new vector-borne diseases will bring inevitable
adaptation costs.58

In the summer of 2003, an estimated 11,435 people died
in France when a record-breaking heatwave struck in the
first two weeks of August. A ministry of health report on
the response of the public health system found a “lack of
anticipation, organization and coordination”. Responding
to the report, Health Minister Jean-François Mattei,
announced $748 million in extra funding for hospital
emergency services.59

Malaria was officially eradicated in Europe in 1975 but is
experiencing a come-back, with 12,000 cases per year in
Western Europe. According to the World Health
Organisation’s Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Global
Partnership, launched in 1998, fighting malaria can
account for 40 per cent of government spending on
public health. Poor families in the developing world
spend up to 25 per cent of their annual income on
treatment and prevention of malaria. The RBM initiative
estimates that it will take “$2 billion per year to finance
effective malaria control in Africa, and $1 billion per year
for other malaria-endemic areas”.60

Despite the lack of a comprehensive cost estimate for
adaptation in the North, a picture emerges of the scale of
the challenge. Picture these examples repeated across

the developed world and the predicament facing
developing countries is clear. In the US city of
Philadelphia, its Hot Weather Health Watch/Warning
System is estimated to have cost $50,000–60,000 to set
up in 1995, with annual direct operating costs of $75,000
in 1995–98, rising to $115,000 in 2002.61

Another estimate for the cost of developing and installing
a heat warning system in Rome, Italy is between $50,000
and $75,000.62 Health Canada recently supported three
projects totalling $700,000 to integrate research and
policy on climate change and health.63

Analysing all the health-related outcomes of climate
change and predicting human response to those
outcomes may sound like an impossible task, but the US
Environmental Protection Agency has enlisted dozens of
researchers from 11 universities and public institutions to
do just that. The Climate Change and Human Health
website stems from a $3 million Environmental Protection
Agency grant to Johns Hopkins University, and fulfils one
of the Agency’s main objectives. “One of the key purposes
of the grant was to make this information public,” explains
Rebecca Freeman, a doctoral student in the Department of
Geography and Environmental Engineering at Johns
Hopkins, and the creator of the website.64

Water
Watershed degradation will be a common feature of a
warming world. New York City’s decision to invest in
upgraded protection of its Catskills watershed gives an
indication of the kind of costs involved in such major
projects. Building a filtration plant was estimated to cost
$6–8 billion, with annual operating costs of $300 million
while repairing the degraded watershed would take “$1
billion to $1.5 billion, for land acquisition, new watershed
rules and regulations, and financial assistance to
watershed communities to promote environmental quality
and their local economies”.65

One Libyan project to pipe water 1,000 km from the
southern Nubian Desert to the Mediterranean was
estimated to cost $25 billion, but because the groundwater
would have run out in 40–60 years, it was abandoned.66 A
water pipeline from Alaska to Lake Shasta, California
(2,200 km), another adaptation measure in the face of
climate change, would have cost US$110 billion.67

Other proposed projects include some short-distance
cross-border water sales (Canada–US) by pipeline, e.g.,
from Coutts, Alberta to Sweetgrass, Montana. The US
Army Corps of Engineers investigated water transfer from
Mississippi/Missouri to High Plains.68

Agriculture
One cruel twist of global warming is that many of the rich
countries responsible could, in the short-to-medium term,
benefit agriculturally, with a longer growing season and
the chance to extend the range of crops grown. The
same cannot be said for much of Africa which faces a
drop in the productivity of its farming.

However, the shape of agricultural adaptation in the
North is also highly uncertain. As Britain’s Ministry of
Agriculture Food and Fisheries said in 2000:

“Even small changes in precipitation will have
profound consequences for plant production…
Decreased spring and summer rainfall would have
serious implications, decreasing crop water
supply, especially in light soils, increasing moisture
stress and reducing growth. The impact on
horticultural crops would be severe. Demand for
irrigation would probably increase.” 69

One of the perverse possibilities of a warming climate for
Europe is a new mini-ice age that could result if the Gulf
Stream that warms Britain and Western Europe is
‘switched off’. In this case the challenge and cost of
adaptation are likely to be great.

Any change in the climate, however, is likely to involve
investments in agricultural technology; funds needed to
develop new equipment; costs for disseminating
information; education costs; the cost of climate
information; and higher, per-unit costs of water.70

The cost of agricultural adaptation to the current climate
in Canada has been estimated at over $1.3 billion, and
the costs of other adaptations, for example, crop
insurance, irrigation, research and development, are also
likely to increase under climate change.71

A range of water-related problems point to the need for:
“improving irrigation systems and adjusting the selection
of planting dates and cultivars… longer and warmer
growing seasons may allow earlier planting and

16

harvesting dates” to avoid arid late summer conditions.
According to the Canadian government, “these
strategies, along with water transfers and changes to
crop insurance programs, are adaptation options often
suggested for dealing with future climate changes.”72

To help farming adapt to changing climate conditions, in
1996–97 the Agricultural Research Institute of Ontario
(ARIO) received CAN$42,356,784 from the Ontario
Government for research purposes. A year earlier the
federal government earmarked CAN$276.1 million for the
Research Branch of Agriculture and Agri-food Canada.73
An estimate for the benefit of adapting US agriculture to
climate change was put at US$7–11 billion.74

Fisheries
Globally, while many key fish stocks are already under
threat due to over-fishing, there is a reported degree of
optimism about fisheries’ ability to adapt to climate
change. This, however, may be due to an assumption
“that changes are gradual and predictable”, which may
not be the case.75

The challenge will then be to adapt: in living ecosystems
populations can crash or relocate suddenly in response
to new environmental signals. Adaptive interventions are
needed. For example, Canada spent $15 million in 2000
dredging the Great Lakes in response to low water levels.

Tourism
Reliable weather is often one of the guiding principles for
a tourist’s decision to go to a particular destination. So far,
the tourism industry has been slow to react to the
challenges that climate change holds in store, despite the

fact that over half of the world’s 715 million international
tourist arrivals (2002) are concentrated in relatively few
destinations, most which are part of the OECD. Over 50
per cent of the arrivals go to only ten destinations: the US,
Germany, the UK, Japan, France, Italy, China, The
Netherlands, Canada and Belgium/Luxembourg.76

in a case study area was projected to reduce by up to 16
per cent in the 2020s and up to 32 per cent in the
2050s. Snowmaking would increase by up to 144 per
cent in the 2020s and up to 187 per cent in the 2050s.
Without snowmaking, the season would reduce up to 57
per cent in the 2050s.79

In Europe, cold winters are expected to more or less
disappear by 2008 and hot summers are expected to
become more frequent. Ski resorts in the northern
hemisphere have for some time been experiencing less
and less snow and it has been estimated that the annual
snow cover has decreased by about 10 per cent since
1966. The snow cover period shortened by about a week
between 1971 and 1994 and this trend is likely to
continue over the twenty-first century. Glaciers are also
currently retreating, which will affect summer skiing in
glacial regions.77

The European skiing industry is slowly waking up to the
need for adaptation, but there remains a lot of scepticism.
A focus-group study among tourism representatives in
Switzerland revealed that while climate change was a
known phenomenon, the information disseminated on the
subject wasn’t trusted. On the other hand, they did use
climate change to legitimately forward strategies, which
implies that some form of adaptation is already taking
place, although not on a large or measurable scale.78

The impact of climate change on the skiing industry in
Australia, Canada and the US is not expected to be as
high as in Europe, due to an already high level of artificial
snowmaking. However, the economic impact of
additional snowmaking requirements remains an
important uncertainty. In Canada, the average ski season

Areas that are currently regarded to have a pleasant
summer climate, like the Mediterranean, are also
expected to suffer as the destinations become too hot.
Sea-level rise is another problem that could put popular
beaches under water, thus diverting tourists elsewhere.
Northern Europe is sometimes seen as an alternative,
but unpredictable weather makes this less likely. Extreme
weather conditions will also take their toll on sensitive
monuments and buildings, leading to faster deterioration
and increased conservation costs.

What is far more apparent than adaptation costs is the
scale of income loss for tourism destinations expected
from changes in the climate. On average, each
international arrival in Europe generates an estimated
expenditure of $580, excluding transport costs. A change
in tourism flows could have substantial effects on
European economies. It is estimated that the
Mediterranean might forego between 111 and 198 million
arrivals by 2050 due to climate change, amounting to
$64–110 billion in receipts.80 In the US, for example,
recreational beach visits account for almost 200 million
visitor days per year. The total annual value of these visits
has been estimated to be over $3 billion, something that
could be under threat due to sea-level rise and increased
temperatures.81 In Switzerland, it is estimated that the
potential annual cost of climate change accounted for by
tourism could be as high as $1.2 to $1.6 billion.82

Conclusion

The purpose of this briefing is two-fold. First, it is to
show the comprehensive scale of adaptations that
will be required the world over in the face of global
warming. And, secondly, it highlights the shameful
abdication of responsibility by industrialised
countries, overwhelmingly responsible for creating
the problem, to pay to help others, with far fewer
resources, live with it.

The additional costs of adapting to climate change are
unknown. An initial assessment based on the best
available predictions for various scenarios of warming is
needed. Until that happens, however, rich countries
could, as a minimum, make additional funds available
equal to the amount they use to subsidise their domestic
polluting fossil fuel industries. Using the late 1990s as a
benchmark, a conservative estimate suggests that rich
countries’ fossil fuel subsidies stood at around $73 billion
per year.84 That would, perhaps, be a good place to
begin the upward bidding.

Against the meagre pledge of $0.41 billion in additional
funds to help poor countries adapt to the problem, rich
countries are making billions available to protect
themselves. France alone is spending nearly twice that
figure to adapt its health service in response to just one
severe heatwave in 2003.

In the UK, official adaptation priorities are
comprehensively laid out.83 They cover coastal and river
flood defence programmes, where spending already
exceeds the total new amount committed to help the
whole of the developing world. But also:

(cid:1) Improved water resource management.

(cid:1) Enhanced resilience of building and infrastructure.

(cid:1) Management of wildlife, forestry and agriculture.

(cid:1) Co-ordinated approaches to planning.

(cid:1) Awareness raising of climate change impacts.

(cid:1) Improved long-term and short-term risk prediction.

Given rich countries historical responsibility for global
warming, and the resources at their disposal, at the very
least we believe that funds available for adaptation
should be raised substantially. But to what level? We
need to take account of the globally agreed Millennium
Development Goals for poverty reduction, which have
their own costs attached, costs far higher than the nature
and level of current aid programmes will pay for.
Excluding health and sanitation this calls for an extra $50
billion per year.

One of the other things we do

Current priorities are climate change,
ecological debt and local sustainability

Local Works: Local people must be put back at the heart
of their local economies. Policies that favour the large
and remote are threatening the vibrancy and diversity of
our communities, bringing Ghost Town Britain. Giving real
power to local people can reinvigorate our local rural
and urban economies.

nef is leading this campaign
characterised by a highly diverse
membership that seeks to combat
the spectre of ‘Ghost Town Britain’.
It promotes the importance of local
sustainability and self-determination.
For example, Local Works was a big
part of the campaign to defend
community pharmacies. Taking as
a starting point the fact that local
communities should be more in charge
of their own economies, education,
healthcare, consumer and leisure
needs, Local Works is campaigning
for a legal framework that can make
this happen.

The needs of communities must be at
the heart of environmental, social and
political justice. At a time of growing
disenchantment with political processes,
individuals and communities can and
should have a real impact on how
money is spent in their communities
and what they invest in. Having a
tangible impact on the delivery of
services is a vital tool for political,
social, environmental and economic
reinvigoration in all of our communities.

Local Works recognises that there
is no single blueprint, but that
communities should draw up and
implement their own plans to achieve
these goals.
