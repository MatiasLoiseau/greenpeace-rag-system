EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report reveals the cost of air 
pollution from fossil fuels and highlights 
solutions that can protect our health 
and benefit our communities. Air 
pollution generated by burning fossil 
fuels is attributed to approximately  
4.5 million premature deaths worldwide 
every year, the report shows. Air 
pollution increases the incidence 
of chronic and acute illnesses and 
contributes to millions of hospital visits 
and billions of work absences due to 
illness each year. It also damages our 
economies and the environment.
For the first time, Greenpeace Southeast Asia and 
the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air 
(CREA) have quantified the global cost of air 
pollution from fossil fuels, finding that it has reached 
an estimated US$8 billion per day, or 3.3% of the 
world’s GDP. While coal, oil and vehicle companies 
continue to push outdated technologies, our health 
and our communities are paying the price.
The economic cost of air pollution reflects pollution 
concentrations, population size and the availability 
and cost of healthcare. We found that the China 
Mainland, the United States and India bear the 
highest costs from fossil fuel air pollution worldwide, 
at an estimated US$900 billion, US$600 billion and 
US$150 billion per year, respectively. 
We estimate that exposure to PM2.5 and ozone from 
fossil fuels is responsible for 7.7 million asthma-
related trips to the emergency room each year. 
Exposure to fossil fuel generated fine particulate 
matter (PM2.5) alone is attributed to an estimated 1.8 
billion days of sick leave annually. 
Air pollution is a major health threat to children, 
particularly in low income countries. Worldwide an 
estimated 40,000 children die before their fifth  
birthday because of exposure to PM2.5 pollution. We 
found that air pollution from fossil fuel-related PM2.5  
is attributed to an estimated 2 million preterm births 
each year.Yet while toxic air pollution is a global threat, the 
solutions are increasingly available and affordable. 
Moreover, many solutions to fossil fuel air pollution 
are also the solutions to climate change. Clean 
transport and renewable energy not only bring 
significant reductions in toxic pollutants such as 
PM2.5, NOx and ozone, but also help to keep climate 
change-causing greenhouse gases out of the 
atmosphere.
A phaseout of existing coal, oil and gas infrastructure 
brings major health benefits due to the associated 
reduction in air pollution. Research shows that the 
closure of coal-fired power plants can yield health 
benefits that exceed the value of electricity 
generated.1 According to a study published in the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, an 
expanded fossil fuel phaseout and investment in 
clean energy sources could reduce premature deaths 
related to air pollution worldwide by up to nearly two 
thirds2.
In addition, a transition to affordable and carbon 
neutral transport is critical to ensuring healthy cities. 
Effective public transport systems and good walking 
and cycling infrastructure enable mobility, reduce air 
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and 
correlate with a decrease in rates of cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, mental illness, and 
respiratory disease3.
One of the most important ways that governments 
can catalyze sustainable transport is to set a phase-
out date for diesel, gas, and petrol cars, and to 
introduce comprehensible and affordable public 
transport, with safe walking and cycling 
infrastructure. We need to move away from private 
cars as the primary mode of transport, and initiatives 
like car-free days allow us to imagine what our cities 
would look like without traffic and pollution.
The transition to renewable energy is essential both 
to prevent catastrophic climate change and to 
protect our health. While fossil fuel companies 
continue to market outmoded technologies, our 
communities pay the price. A just transition to 
renewable energy is possible, but we can’t afford to 
delay any longer.

Toxic air: The price of fossil fuels  
February 20201.0 INTRODUCTION
This report, ‘Toxic air: The price of fossil 
fuels’, assesses the impacts on global 
health and the economic cost of air 
pollution from the continued burning 
of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. 
Using data published in 2019 – including 
the first study to assess the contribution 
of fossil fuels to global air pollution 
and health4 – the report provides a 
global assessment of the health impact 
of air pollution from fossil fuels in 
2018 and a first-of-its-kind estimate of 
the associated economic cost. Case 
studies relating to transport and power 
generation show that reducing air 
pollution is feasible, achievable and cost 
effective.
This report uses the most recent evidence and data 
on pollution levels, health effects and demographics 
to quantify the effects of air pollution on global and 
regional levels. The analysis includes an estimate of 
the financial cost of the health burden on the global 
economy. Using case studies, the report discusses 
how the phaseout of fossil fuels will have the 
co-benefit of mitigating climate change and 
reversing some of the most pressing global health 
problems5.
1.1 Air pollution: a brief overview
The primary focus of ‘Toxic air: The price of fossil 
fuels’, is the impact of air pollution from burning fossil 
fuels on human health and the associated financial 
costs. The study is limited to the pollutants; fine 
particulate matter (abbreviated to PM2.5), ozone (O3) 
and nitrogen dioxide (or NO2),  and only that 
pollution which is emitted by fossil fuel combustion. 
1.1.1 What are the key air pollutants?
This report only considers the impact of fossil fuel-
related air pollution and only those pollutants for 
which there are well understood relationships 
between changes in pollutant concentration and 
health impacts. The following pollutants are included:• Nitrogen oxides.  When fossil fuels are burned in 
air, nitrogen oxides (NO  and NO2, collectively 
referred to as NOx) are created from molecular 
nitrogen in the air and in the fuel that is being 
burned. NOx pollution, along with sulfur dioxide, 
which is also produced when fossil fuels are 
burned, reacts with water to form acid rain, snow 
and fog, and with other substances to form 
particulate matter (see section 1.1.1) and smog.  
The health impacts of exposure to nitrogen oxides 
include cardiovascular diseases, exacerbated 
symptoms of asthma, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disorder and other respiratory 
diseases6,7. Acid rain is detrimental to plants and 
animals.
• Ozone.  Ozone (O3) is found in the stratosphere, 
one of the Earth’s protective atmospheric layers. 
Stratospheric ozone protects the Earth’s surface 
from ultraviolet radiation from the sun, but ozone 
also forms at near-ground level, where it is an air 
pollutant that causes smog. Ground level ozone 
forms when NOx pollution reacts with chemicals 
called volatile organic compounds. Ozone 
pollution causes acute human health problems, 
including chest pain, throat irritation and 
inflammation of the airways. Ozone can also impair 
lung function and increase the symptoms of 
bronchitis, emphysema and asthma8. It also 
adversely affects vegetation and crops.
• Particulate matter.  Particulate matter, (also known 
as particle pollution or PM,) is a term used to 
describe extremely small particles and liquid 
droplets in the atmosphere.  In relation to exposure 
to particulate matter, the World Health 
Organisation says: “There is no evidence of a safe 
level of exposure or a threshold below which no 
adverse health effects occur” 9. These particles can 
be a combination of different chemicals and are 
classed according to particle size: PM10; PM2.5; and 
ultrafine particles (Figure. 1).
a. Ultrafine definition.  Ultrafine particulates have 
no formal definition but the general consensus is 
that they are any particles with an aerodynamic 
diameter of ≤ 0.1 μm. Ultrafine particles are 
respirable, which means that they are small 
enough to reach the gas exchange region of the 
lungs.  
 

3
b. PM2.5 definition.  PM2.5 refers to any particulate 
matter with an aerodynamic diameter that 
measures ≤ 2.5 μm, including ultrafine particles. 
As with ultrafine particulates, PM2.5 particles are 
respirable, which means that they are small 
enough to reach the gas exchange region of the 
lungs10. 
c. PM10 definition.   PM10 particles are ≤ 10 μm in 
diameter11. These particulates are inhalable and 
can lodge in the respiratory tract12.
Figure 1. A graphic representation on a logarithmic scale showing example sources of different sized air pollution particles (blue, red, beige, 
green) and the size fractions of particulate matter to which they contribute (dark to light grey)13.1.1.2 What are the sources of air pollution?
Natural
Particulate matter occurs naturally in the environment. 
Airborne desert dust, sulfates, volcanic emissions and 
organics released by vegetation are natural sources of 
PM14. Nitrogen oxides are released into the 
environment from natural sources such as microbial 
processes in soils, lightning and forest fires15. Many of 
these processes can be exacerbated by human-
induced global warming and environmental changes. 
Anthropogenic
Human activities that contribute significant quantities 
of particulate matter include road- and non-road 
transport, including shipping and air traffic; public 
energy production by fossil fuel power plants; 
commercial and residential combustion sources (cooking and heating); industrial activity; biomass 
burning (forest, shrub, grass and agricultural waste); 
and agriculture. In urban areas, traffic and combustion 
are the primary sources16 of PM2.5. 
Nitrogen oxides are released during any combustion 
reaction, particularly at high temperatures. The 
primary anthropogenic sources of NOx are vehicles, 
non-road vehicles, (for example, construction 
equipment,) industrial sources such as power plants, 
turbines, industrial boilers and cement kilns, boats and 
heating for buildings17.
Primary and secondary pollutants
Air pollutants are classed as primary if they are 
emitted directly from the source – a factory chimney 
or vehicle exhaust, for example. Secondary air 
pollutants are formed when a chemical reaction 
occurs in the atmosphere involving a primary air 
pollutant. Ozone is a secondary air pollutant created 
when oxides of nitrogen react with a group of 
chemicals called volatile organic compounds. Some 
particulate matter pollution is secondary pollution. For 
example, sulfur dioxide can oxidise to form sulfuric 
acid, which can then produce ammonium sulfate 
particles if it reacts with ammonia.

February 20201.2 Air pollution from burning  
fossil fuels
Burning fossil fuels – primarily coal, oil and gas – 
emits pollutants, contaminating the air that we 
breathe and leading to adverse health effects. Major 
sources responsible for emitting pollutants into the 
atmosphere including power generation, transport, 
(including petrol and diesel vehicles), residential 
energy use, agriculture and industry. 
Historically, energy from fossil fuels has dominated 
power generation (Figure. 2), but as the cost of 
establishing and maintaining renewable sources of 
power (such as wind and solar) continues to fall, 
these options are now frequently less expensive than 
the fossil fuel alternative. Research by the International Renewable Energy 
Agency published in 2018 took into account the 
lifetime cost of electricity in its calculations of cost 
comparisons to generate power from renewable 
sources versus fossil fuels. Although in most parts of 
the world newly commissioned power plants that use 
renewable sources, such as wind and solar, will be 
cheaper or at a similar cost than from fossil fuels, 
including coal, oil and gas18, companies continue to 
push outdated technologies with the outcome that 
fossil fuels continue to dominate, creating air 
pollution when cleaner alternatives are readily 
available.   
Figure 2: Global active power plant capacity added per year, still active in 2014. Fossil fuel use has dominated energy supplies for decades, but 
the use of renewable technologies has been rapidly expanding, particularly since the mid-2000s19.1.0

51.3 Air pollution, health and cost
Air pollution affects physical and mental health 
because it contributes to acute and chronic diseases 
that can reduce quality of life. Evidence from public 
health studies suggests that exposure to an air 
pollutant or combination of air pollutants, such as 
PM2.5, NO2 or ozone, is associated with increased 
incidence of diseases including ischaemic heart 
disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), lung cancer, lower respiratory 
infections, premature birth (preterm birth), type II 
diabetes, stroke and asthma20,21,22,23. Health impacts 
from air pollution generate economic costs from the 
cost of treatment, management of health 
conditions, and from work absences. 
The properties and effects of air pollution vary from 
country to country; different locations are affected 
by different pollutants, pollution sources and 
environmental conditions. Combined with 
differences in population and lifestyle, the health 
impacts from air pollution change significantly 
depending on the geographical location24,25,26. For 
example, a computer modelling study27 looked at 
seven different sources of PM2.5 and ozone air 
pollution: industry; land traffic; residential and 
commercial energy; biomass burning; power 
generation; agriculture; and natural. Using the 
model, the researchers calculated premature 
mortality resulting from air pollution generated by 
each of the seven sectors. Of premature deaths 
attributed to air pollution globally in 2010, almost 
one-third were attributable to exposure (while 
outdoors) to air pollution from residential and 
commercial energy28, which was the principal 
source of air pollution-related premature deaths in 
India and China Mainland. Globally, land traffic was 
attributable for 5% of air pollution-related 
premature deaths and power generation for 14%. 
Countries where air pollution from land traffic 
emissions were particularly high included the US, 
Germany, Russia, Turkey and Japan. The 
contribution of  power generation to premature 
mortality was particularly high in the US, Russia, 
Turkey, China Mainland and Japan29. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has created 
guidelines that describe the level of air pollution 
above which there is strong evidence of negative 
health impacts30. These guidelines are derived from 
the latest available evidence on the health effects 
of ambient air pollutants and undergo regular 
review31. In 2019, around 91% of the global 
population lived in places where levels of air 
pollution exceeded the WHO guidelines32. 
1.4 Air pollution and climate
The phaseout of fossil fuels and switch to renewable 
forms of energy is  beneficial both for reducing air 
pollution and mitigating anthropogenic climate 
change33. Events that may be affected by climate 
change such as sandstorms, wildfires and heat waves 
can worsen air pollution by, for example, increasing 
the quantity of particulate matter in the air. Reducing 
the health burden attributed to air pollution while 
simultaneously reducing emissions of climate 
pollutants can be achieved by, for example, removing 
coal from the energy industry or limiting emissions 
from the transport sector34.
Air pollution and the climate crisis are clearly linked. 
Replacements for the coal, oil and gas that are 
currently used to generate power, for transport and 
for domestic heating will need careful consideration 
to ensure that alternative combustion processes are 
avoided. For example, if future energy generation is 
obtained by burning biomass the likely scenario is 
increased emissions of harmful air pollutants such as 
PM2.535. The pathways chosen to meet greenhouse 
gas-reduction targets must champion renewable 
technology and resource efficiency without 
negatively affecting air quality.INTRODUCTION

THE ECONOMIC COST  
OF AIR POLLUTION  
FROM FOSSIL FUELS
2.1 Introduction
This section presents the first global assessment of the 
economic burden of health impacts from fossil fuel air 
pollution. Analysis commissioned by Greenpeace Southeast 
Asia and carried out by the Centre for Research on Energy 
and Clean Air (CREA) has estimated the global and national 
impact of air pollution from fossil fuels. This chapter presents 
the findings from the analysis. Air pollution from non-fossil 
fuel sources (see section 1.1.2) is not included in the analysis. 
The CREA/Greenpeace analysis suggests that air pollution from burning fossil 
fuels costs an estimated 3.3% (95% confidence interval 2.4–4.7%) of global gross 
domestic product, equivalent to US$8 billion per day (95% confidence interval 
US$5.5–11.0bn) and 12,000 (95% confidence interval 9,000–17,000) premature 
deaths every day.
The assessment incorporates recent research that quantifies the contribution of 
fossil fuels to global air pollution levels. It uses published global datasets 
describing surface level concentrations of PM2.5, ozone and NO2 to perform a 
health impact assessment and subsequent cost calculation for the year 2018. Full 
details of the methodology are provided in Appendix 1.
The health and economic impacts included in the CREA/Greenpeace analysis 
only consider fossil fuel-related air pollution and are shown in Table 1. Only those 
impacts for which there is sufficiently robust data relating pollutant 
concentrations to population level health impacts are included. Therefore, these 
figures represent only a proportion of the total burden of all air pollution. Finally, 
because not all real world health impacts from fossil fuel air pollution are included, 
the analysis presented in this chapter is a conservative estimate of the global 
impact of fossil fuels on air pollution, health and the economy.
The health impacts are determined by combining pollutant concentration 
maps36,37 representing the year 2018, with country or region-level demographic 
data and health statistics. Concentration response functions for each pollutant are 
used to relate a pollutant concentration to the response or impact of that 
pollutant on a population. Published concentration–response functions, described 
in Appendix 1, were used to calculate the impact of the mapped fossil fuel air 
pollution at a population level for the calendar year 2018. Using research carried 
out by the World Health Organization’s project called ‘Health risks of air pollution 
in Europe’ (HRAPIE)38, it is possible to estimate the number of working days lost 
through exposure to PM2.5, but statistics are not available to calculate the impact 
of other air pollutants on work absences. The concentration response functions 
used to calculate the incidence of the health and economic outcomes shown in 
Table 1. Full details of the economic impact calculations used in the CREA/
Greenpeace analysis are provided in Appendix 1. 
Previous studies have estimated global and regional mortality and disease 
incidence rates resulting from exposure to air pollution and fossil fuel derived air 
pollution. The methodology applied in this work builds on recent scientific 

7
findings and models of the health risks of air pollution exposure. An updated model of mortality risks due to 
outdoor PM2.5  pollution in 2018 found substantially higher risks than earlier studies and consequently revised 
the estimates of premature deaths upwards39. A new cohort study on ozone similarly led to a large increase in 
deaths attributed to ozone pollution in 201740. For these reasons, the estimates of death and disease in our 
study exceed many earlier results, sometimes leading to the number of deaths attributed to fossil fuels 
exceeding the total number of deaths from air pollution reported in some earlier studies. Full details of the 
health and economic impact calculations used in the CREA/Greenpeace analysis are provided in Appendix 1.

2.2 Health impacts and costs
2.2.1 Health
The CREA/Greenpeace analysis suggests that an estimated 3 million premature 
adult deaths each year are attributed to cardiovascular diseases, respiratory 
diseases and lung cancer through exposure to PM2.5 air pollution from fossil fuels. 
An estimated 500,000 premature deaths from chronic diseases are attributed to 
fossil fuel-related NO2 pollution and 1 million premature deaths are attributed to 
fossil fuel-related ozone pollution annually. Combined, total premature deaths per 
year attributable to fossil fuel-related air pollution is estimated at 4.5 million.
The data calculated for this report estimates that 40,000 children may die before 
their fifth birthday due to illnesses related to exposure to PM2.5 from fossil fuels 
and shows that those deaths occur mainly in low-income countries. The loss of a 
child is tragic and devastating to the families affected. In economic terms, infant 
mortality has a high fiscal cost to society because that child is prevented from 
contributing  to society in adulthood (Table 2).
Millions of people around the world are living with asthma and other chronic 
respiratory diseases where exposure to pollution from fossil fuel combustion is a 
contributing factor. Chronic diseases can lead to substantial healthcare costs and 
prevent people from participating in the workforce. Exposure to PM2.5 is the 
leading cause of health and economic impacts arising from air pollution and in 
2018 contributed to a higher number of premature deaths than those we can 
attribute to exposure to NO2 and ozone combined (Fig. 3).

2.2.2 Economic cost
Data generated by the CREA/Greenpeace model suggests that an estimated 
annual cost of US$2.9 trillion (central estimate), equivalent to 3.3% of global GDP 
or US$8 billion per day, is attributed to air pollution from fossil fuels (Table 3, 
Figure 4). These costs are the result of respiratory and non-communicable 
diseases made more likely by elevated pollution levels. An economic valuation of 
the years of life lost through premature death is also included. The impact of 
premature death can be quantified using a measure known as ‘years of life lost’. 
The personal tragedy of a premature death also brings an economic cost through 
lost contributions to society and economy. This means that when premature 
deaths occur, especially in children and younger people, the economic cost can be 
large. 
Costs of US$350 billion and US$380 billion are attributed to NO2 and ozone air 
pollution from fossil fuels respectively, each equivalent to 0.4% of global GDP.
PM2.5 air pollution leads to the greatest health impact and the greatest financial 
cost of the three pollutants. PM2.5 from fossil fuels is attributed to  increased work 
absences, causing an estimated 1.8 billion (central estimate) days of work 
absences annually worldwide  (Table 3).Project name. Photography by xxxxxxx.THE ECONOMIC COST

2.3 Regional examples of the cost of air pollution
This section presents findings generated by the CREA/Greenpeace data in 
particular relevance to different global regions.
2.3.1 Health
The health impact of fossil fuel air pollution in a country or region is determined 
by factors including the nature and distribution of pollution sources, the local 
environment, weather conditions, background rates of disease not related to air 
pollution, population size and population density, among others.
The data generated in the CREA/Greenpeace analysis includes the projected 
number of asthma-related emergency room (ER) visits attributable to PM2.5 and 
ozone. Globally, the findings estimate 7.7 million (confidence 4.8–10.0 million) 
asthma-related ER visits annually. Of these, 37,000 (24,000–47,000) ER visits are 
in Russia; 62,000 (37,000–83,000) in South Africa; 196,000 (125,000–248,000) in 
the US; and 266,000 (166,000–340,000) in Indonesia, for example. A breakdown 
of cost and premature death data by location is provided in Appendix 2.
Approximately 2 million (1,032,000–2,093,000) preterm births worldwide are 
attributed to PM2.5 exposure as a result of fossil fuel use. Of these, an estimated 
350,000 (184,000–367,000) are in China Mainland; 14,000 (6,700–14,500) are in 
South Africa; 981,000 (517,000–1,031,000) are  in India; and 11,000 (6,000–12,000) 
are in Thailand.
The incidence of stroke has been linked to PM2.5 exposure and the CREA/
Greenpeace data estimates that 600,000 (268,000-904,000) deaths annually 
can be attributed to stroke relating to fossil fuel derived PM2.5 exposure.
Across the EU, around 400,000 annual premature deaths are attributed to 
exposure to air pollution from fossil fuel use. Of those deaths three-quarters are 
related to PM2.5 exposure with the remainder being related to NO2 and ozone 
exposure (Table 4, Figure 5).

estimates are provided representing 
a 95% confidence interval.
In East Asia the absolute number of early deaths attributed to air pollution is 
dominated by those in China Mainland. Despite rapid improvements in PM2.5 air 
quality since 201541, pollution continues to affect a large proportion of the 
population. Annually 1.8 million (1.3-2.5 million) premature deaths are projected 
across China Mainland. The estimated number of annual premature deaths 
relating to fossil fuel emissions is 40,000 (28,000-61,000) in South Korea, 16,000 
(12,000-24,000) in Taiwan and 100,000 (75,000-150,000) in Japan.
Across East Asia, the majority of premature deaths are attributed to PM2.5 
exposure (Figure 6). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) is a leading 
cause of early deaths. Data from the present analysis attribute 582,000 (366,000-
827,000) deaths to COPD-related to PM2.5 exposure from fossil fuels in China 
Mainland, approximately 40% of the global incidence. In South Korea 5000 
(3,000-7,000) premature deaths from COPD are projected with 4,000 (2,000-
6,000) in Taiwan; and 15,000 (9,000-22,000) in Japan.

2.3.2 Economic cost
Population size is a significant driver of the absolute cost of air pollution for 
society. Also important are factors such as the local availability and cost of 
healthcare and the rate of infant mortality.  Nations that have large populations 
often have a large absolute cost burden from fossil fuel-related air pollution, and 
where high air pollution levels intersect with dense populations the impact is 
magnified.  
The cost of fossil fuel air pollution equates to a large percentage of many nations’ 
GDP. The projected cost of fossil fuel air pollution as a percentage of GDP is 
greatest in China Mainland, where it equates to 6.6% (confidence 4.7-9.0%) of 
GDP. By comparison, it is 3.4% (2.2-5.1%) and 2.5% (1.8-3.7%) in South Korea and 
Japan respectively.  In Bulgaria, Hungary, Ukraine, Serbia, Belarus, India, Romania 
and Bangladesh the cost (central estimate) is greater than 5% of GDP. The 
estimated cost of fossil fuel-related air pollution in Southeast Asia, the Middle East 
and North Africa is shown in Table 7 and Table 8. 
Across East Asia the estimated cost of fossil fuel-related air pollution is high, 
accounting for more than 2% of GDP across East Asia.  Work absences in 2018 
from exposure to fossil fuel-related PM2.5 are estimated at 748 million (642–853 
million) days in China Mainland, costing the economy an estimated US$39 billion 
(US$33–US$44 billion). In South Korea, Taiwan and Japan the figure is 18 million 
(16–21 million) days, 5 million (4–6 million) days and 20 million (17–23 million) days, 
respectively. 
In Southeast Asia, the estimated cost of fossil fuel-related air pollution is greater 
than 2% of GDP in Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar (central estimate). Only 
in Brunei and Timor Leste is the figure less than 1% of GDP (Table 7).

WHAT CAN BE DONE  
ABOUT ANTHROPOGENIC  
AIR POLLUTION?
Realistic scenarios for phasing out fossil 
fuels are capable of simultaneously 
reducing air pollution and greenhouse 
gas emissions42. Decarbonising the 
global economy can bring rapid health 
gains for society, especially by reducing 
exposure to air pollutants, most notably 
PM2.5 which has the greatest impact on 
our health43.  
Solutions to the air pollution crisis, such as emissions 
controls in Europe, have helped bring about huge 
reductions in health impacts for citizens. Policy to 
reduce air pollution does not need to be expensive, 
and, where interventions are costly to implement, the 
benefits can outweigh the costs. For example, the 
United States Clean Air Act has returned 
substantially greater economic benefits in relation to 
the costs of implementation, and the benefits 
exceeded a ratio of 30:1 over the period 1990–2020. 
Put another way, for every US$1 invested, the US 
economy saw benefits of at least US$30 returned44. 
Many strategies to control pollution are likely to be 
cost-effective in cities and countries whatever their 
level of income45.
In this section we demonstrate with examples that it 
is possible and affordable to drastically reduce the 
health burden of air pollution from fossil fuels, 
through actions that also support efforts to mitigate 
anthropogenic climate change. This section focuses 
on two different fossil fuel burning sectors: transport 
and oil; and electricity and coal. We demonstrate that 
action on air pollution is practical, feasible and cost 
effective.3.1 Case study one: Switch to 
sustainable transport
The ways in which humans travel — particularly in 
highly populated urban areas — must change if we 
are to tackle the dual threats of air pollution and 
climate emergency46,47. As millions of people take 
private vehicles on a daily basis for work, school or 
leisure, neighborhood streets are not only clogged 
with traffic but diesel and petrol engines contribute 
to poor air quality and lead to an increased 
concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases. It is 
clear that to reduce harmful levels of particulates and 
halt global climate heating, a transport revolution is 
needed, one that ensures a clean, carbon-neutral and 
universal mobility system for all. Our cities need to 
support lifestyles that are healthy for residents and 
for the planet. Low-cost, active and carbon neutral 
transportation is an important part of this transition, 
having the combined benefits of reducing urban 
pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and rates of 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, 
mental illness, and respiratory disease48. One of the 
most important steps governments can take to 
initiate a move towards a sustainable transport 
system is to set a phase-out date for diesel and 
petrol cars, while implementing various urban 
transport measures, such as restricting cars’ access 
into certain neighborhoods or districts, banning 
whole categories of cars within city limits, and 
promoting  car-free days. Such initiatives allow 
residents to imagine what their city could be like 
without congestion and particulate pollution, with 
the added benefit of encouraging physical activity. In 
this case study, we investigate initiatives that national 
governments have undertaken to improve public 
health and air quality by removing petrol and diesel 
cars from city streets.
There are many examples of city authorities that 
have undertaken initiatives to create cleaner air, for 
example by promoting pedestrian and cycle-friendly 
spaces and alternatives to private vehicle transport, 
such as car clubs or vehicle sharing schemes, and 
public transport powered by renewable energy. In the 
UK, Transport for London announced that (correct as 
of January 2020), four bus routes through the city 
centre are fully electric49. In Shenzhen, all diesel 
public buses were replaced with electric vehicles in 
2018, making it the world’s first fully electric fleet50.  

20
Toxic air: The price of fossil fuels  
February 2020In the United States, New York City’s Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority (MTA) is working towards a 
zero-emission bus fleet and is in the final stages of a 
three-year trial of all-electric buses51.  In 2019, Oslo 
closed central city streets to privately owned vehicles 
and cut city centre parking spots52. Oslo residents can 
enjoy a cleaner environment, where walking, cycling, 
and public transport use is encouraged. Restricting 
private vehicle use is an effective strategy to reduce 
fossil fuel use and improve air quality, and in 
conjunction with alternate and public transport 
systems, access can be maintained for those unable to 
walk and cycle53.
No city has become entirely vehicle free, but car-free 
days which have operated in cities for many years 
provide an opportunity to see the potential for health 
and environmental co-benefits. Car-free events take 
place in cities around the world, often annually but in 
some locations, like Bogota, Colombia, roads are 
closed to cars on a weekly basis54. These examples 
show that, although occasional car-free days are a 
positive first step, to be effective for human health, 
car-free events should take place on a regular or 
continuous basis and attract a high proportion of the 
community.
As we can learn from the car-free cases, ensuring 
streets aren’t clogged with cars leads to significant 
health and financial benefits. However, car-free cases 
are only a partial policy approach to resolve 
congestion and air pollution in urban areas. The bigger 
shift is happening globally to move the transport 
system away from fossil fuels and approach mobility in 
a way that is sustainable and equitable for all.
More than 15 countries have announced plans to phase 
out new petrol and diesel cars, and, in some cases, 
hybrids. Although not perfect, these announcements 
send a strong signal to markets that there is no future 
for fossil fuel vehicles. Both to ensure safe air and avoid 
the worst impacts of climate change, it is necessary to 
phase out the internal combustion engine and develop 
alternatives to mass car ownership55.
It is clear that with technological and social changes, 
cities can eliminate fossil fuel-powered vehicles, rapidly 
reduce pollution and help find solutions to climate 
change. Major cities can pioneer this change, leading 
the charge toward more sustainable urban spaces that 
put social equity and justice at the heart of creating a 
carbon-neutral mobility system for all. In turn this will shape national and global debates on the future of 
urban transport56 and empower national governments 
to set ambitious phase-out dates for petrol and diesel 
cars while investing in public transport and e-mobility.
On your bike: The benefits of Bogotá’s Sunday 
street closure 
One of the longest-running examples of a car-free 
day event in a city is the Ciclovía in Bogotá, 
Colombia which was initiated in 1974. The Ciclovía 
is a weekly event that takes place every Sunday 
and public holiday in central Bogotá, in which 
roads are closed to motorised traffic to allow 
cyclists, skaters and pedestrians traffic-free access 
to 120 kilometres (74.6 miles) of roads. Similar 
events take place in more than 15 countries in the 
Americas and the Caribbean. The aim of the 
Ciclovía was to encourage more people to take up 
physical activity, and some people may choose to 
exercise during Ciclovía precisely because there is 
no traffic and lower air pollution.57 The inclusive 
nature of the Ciclovía boosts its potential  to 
promote activity in children and prevent them 
from developing obesity.58 
The cost-benefit ratio in terms of health cost 
savings of the Bogotá Ciclovía 
In terms of health costs savings, the estimated 
cost–benefit ratio of the Bogotá Ciclovía ranges 
from US$3.20 to US$4.30 per US$1 invested in the 
programme.59  The range reflects uncertainty in 
the number of adult users, which in a study period 
between 2005 and 2009, was estimated to be 
between 516,600 and 1,205,635. A cost–benefit 
ratio calculated for Medellín, Colombia’s second 
city, which runs a similar Ciclovía programme, 
found that every US$1 invested yielded a health 
cost saving of US$1.80. The total benefits of the 
Ciclovía events however may have been 
underestimated because only some beneficial 
factors were included in the analysis. The cost of 
the Ciclovía programme, based on data collected 
in the study period in 2005 and 2009, was 
estimated to be US$6 per capita. For open streets 
events to be successful, the researchers suggest 
that the route should pass through different 
neighbourhoods, be promoted among under-
represented ethnic and age groups, and have 
secure funding to ensure longevity60. WHAT CAN BE DONE

3.2 Case study two: Generate 
electricity from renewables, not fossil 
fuels
Modelling studies suggest that 65% of air pollution 
related global premature mortality can be attributed 
to fossil fuel emissions61. Replacing fossil fuels with 
renewable energy from sources such as wind and 
solar reduces both greenhouse gas emissions and 
emissions of air pollutants, creating a dual benefit for 
climate and human health. This transition is both 
feasible and achievable, and power generated by 
renewable systems is increasing used globally, as 
technology has matured and installation costs have 
fallen drastically. 
In the US between 2007 and 2015, the combined 
contribution from wind and solar to the national grid, 
as well as from distributed photovoltaic power 
sources, increased from  ∼10 GW to ∼100 GW62.   
Pollutant emissions avoided by this wind power 
generation are estimated to have delivered air quality 
and public health savings of between US$28.4–107.9 
billion through the avoidance of an estimated 2,900–
12,200 premature deaths, as well as climate benefits 
savings of US$4.9–98.5 billion. The estimated 
benefits due to solar power generation were US$1.3–
4.9 billion for air quality and public health and 
US$0.4–8.3 billion for climate benefits, with an 
avoided 100–500 early deaths. 
Air pollution benefits from the closure of coal-fired 
power stations can exceed the value of the electricity 
they generated63. As we adopt renewable power and  
phase out fossil fuels, large health benefits can be 
realised by prioritising infrastructure with the 
greatest potential to reduce exposure to air 
pollutants. Power generation from coal, oil and gas 
contribute to air pollution and the climate crisis. 
Phasing out these technologies promises 
environmental and health benefits. The benefits of a 
fossil fuel phaseout can be most significant for coal 
power stations because of the higher SO2, NOx, and 
PM2.5 emission rates associated with coal64. Emission 
standards and plant closures in the United States 
power generation industry drove emission reductions 
of 20%, 72%, 50% and 46% for CO2, SO2, NOx and 
PM2.5 respectively between 2007 and 2015.      A breath of fresh air: The benefits of phasing out 
coal-fired power plants
The closure of existing coal-fired power plants is 
beneficial to the environment and human health. 
Air quality studies show that the closure of 
coal-fired power plants brings health benefits to 
people living and working in their vicinity. 
• One study that evaluated the impact of coal-
fired power plants on childhood development65 
followed two groups of non-smoking pregnant 
women living within 2.5 kilometers of the 
Tongliang power station in Chongqing, China. 
The first group (n=150) was enrolled in 2002 
and had been exposed to polyaromatic 
hydrocarbons from a power plant; the second 
group (n=158) were enrolled in 2005 and had 
not been exposed to the same source because 
the plant closed in 2004. Exposure to PAHs has 
been linked to developmental problems, 
particularly in unborn and young  children. The 
coal power plant which operated between 
December and May until 2004 did not use 
modern pollution reduction technology. The 
study found that reduced exposure to PAH in 
the second group was associated with 
beneficial effects on neurodevelopment as well 
as molecular changes related to improved brain 
development and health. The researchers 
recommend reducing exposure to toxic 
pollutants to help enhance neurodevelopment. 
• Monitoring66 that took place from 2011 to 2014 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, found 
that, following the closure of three coal-fired 
power plants, there was a downward trend in 
ambient PM2.5 levels. The researchers used PM2.5 
measurements from 12 ground stations and 
from satellites to monitor the aerosol optical 
depth (AOD), observing a decline in AOD over 
the study period.
• A well-documented case study67 in Dublin, 
Ireland, describes how a 1990 ban on 
bituminous coal sales reduced wintertime black 
smoke by 70% and decreased deaths from 
respiratory illness by 15% (about 116 people per 
year).  WHAT CAN BE DONE

4.1 Costs
We estimate that air pollution resulting from fossil 
fuels causes approximately 4.5 million premature 
deaths each year globally. Air pollution from fossil 
fuels costs us an estimated 1.8 billion lost working 
days worldwide per year through poor health. This 
hits our economy and seriously damages people’s 
well-being. Combining health costs and work 
absences, an economic cost equivalent to 3.3% of 
global gross domestic product, or US$8 billion per 
day, is estimated to arise from fossil fuel-related air 
pollution, according to this study.
The air pollution health crisis is driven by burning 
fossil fuels, which – because burning coal, gas and oil 
emits greenhouse gases – also contributes to the 
climate emergency. Governments making 
investments to replace fossil fuels with clean 
renewable energy stand to benefit from long-term 
economic returns and to deliver improved health and 
wellbeing to their citizens. 
The need to move away from reliance on fossil fuels 
is clear and, while the cost of our reliance on coal, oil 
and gas continues to soar, life-saving alternatives are 
increasingly widespread and affordable.  
4.2 Transport
Car-free initiatives have demonstrated that radical 
changes to our transport systems have the potential 
to boost physical activity, reduce emissions of 
harmful air pollutants and greenhouse gases and 
improve health. The money saved through these 
health benefits has been demonstrated to return 
multiple times the cost of implementation. It also 
shows the extent to which fossil fuel companies are 
currently profiting at the expense of our 
communities,  who pay the price for air pollution. 
Investment in alternative sustainable alternative 
transport systems can be financially sound and 
positive for health, wellbeing and the planet.Our transport systems urgently need to be 
reorganised so that they use energy and resources 
efficiently and operate without either directly or 
indirectly emitting harmful pollutants. Our cities need 
fewer and cleaner vehicles operating alongside 
greater use of public transport and widespread 
investments in shared mobility, walking and cycling. 
To achieve this, national governments must 
implement ambitious phase-out dates for diesel and 
petrol cars while investing in sustainable transport 
and enabling low-carbon alternatives, such as 
walking or cycling. Pioneering cities and regions can 
lead the way, helping to shape national and global 
debates on the future of urban transport.
4.3 Energy
A phaseout of existing fossil fuel power plants and an 
end to the construction of new projects is essential 
to limit  global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial 
levels, but it will also reduce the emission of air 
pollutants that today disperse over hundreds of 
kilometers. 
Emissions from coal combustion have been linked to 
a broad range of illnesses, including developmental 
problems in children and premature deaths from 
respiratory illnesses. Deployment of renewable 
technology in the electricity grid in parts of the US 
has reduced reliance on fossil fuels and reduced the 
emission of pollutants. The removal of fossil fuels is 
helping to prevent premature deaths and bring vast 
savings in health costs.
Economic savings from the improved air quality 
resulting from coal-fired power station closures can 
exceed the value of the electricity they generated68. 
Moving our energy generation sector from fossil fuels 
to renewables is an essential step towards preventing 
catastrophic climate change and protecting our 
health. A just transition to renewable energy is 
feasible, and we can’t afford to wait any longer. Cities, 
governments and companies need to take action 
now.4.0

Toxic air: The price of fossil fuels  
February 2020This paper presents the first global estimate of the 
economic burden caused by air pollution from fossil 
fuels. We use global datasets describing surface level 
concentrations of PM2.5, ozone and NO2 to perform a 
health impacts assessment and subsequent cost 
calculation. The health impacts are determined by 
combining pollutant concentration maps with 
population data, country or region-level health 
statistics and pollution exposure response functions 
for the year 2018. The complete methodology is 
presented below.
Exposure to air pollution from fossil fuels
The concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone linked to fossil 
fuel emissions have previously been estimated 
globally for 201569, and total NO2 pollution levels for 
the year 2011 have been mapped at high resolution70. 
As NOx emissions sources are heavily dominated by 
fossil fuel burning, we assume that NO2 
concentrations above the thresholds described in 
Table A1 represent NO2 resulting from fossil fuel use. 
For example, for deaths linked to NO2 exposure, the 
threshold is a concentration 20 μm/m3 to link those 
deaths to fossil fuels. This assumption can be 
considered conservative because NOx emissions are 
heavily dominated by fossil fuels globally, particularly 
in cities where the majority of harmful exposure takes 
place.
The surface PM2.5 and NO2 data then are scaled to 
represent concentrations in 2018. The scaling is 
completed using satellite based observations of the 
respective years using MODIS and OMI data 
products. NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution 
Imaging Spectroradiometer) is an Earth observation 
instrument that is carried on two NASA satellites, 
Terra and Aqua. It monitors aerosols in the 
atmosphere and completes a scan of the globe every 
1-2 days71. OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) 
monitors pollutants including NO2 from the NASA 
AURA satellite. These satellite-based measurements 
quantify the total atmospheric amount of each 
pollutant, rather than surface concentrations, and are 
only used to adjust the surface level maps. Ozone is 
not adjusted from 2015 levels.
To calculate pollutant exposure, ozone and the 
adjusted 2018 PM2.5 and NO2 data are combined with 
population and health datasets updated to the latest 
available data (2017-2018)72,73,74,75.Health impacts and costs
We use the adjusted 2018 PM2.5, ozone and NO2 data 
and concentration-response functions to determine 
the incidence of health impacts for a given 
population76. A concentration response function 
relates a pollutant concentration to the response or 
impact of that pollutant on a population. Deaths, 
years of life lost and years lived with disability due to 
PM2.5 exposure are calculated using non-linear, 
age-specific risk derived by Burnett et al77 and Global 
Burden of Disease, which give the increase in risk of 
different health effects as a function of pollutant 
concentration, compared with clean air. Other health 
impacts are projected using log-linear risk functions 
that are expressed as increase in relative risk per 
10μm/m3, or 10 ppb increase in pollutant 
concentration, and an assumed no-risk threshold, 
usually based on lowest concentration in study 
datasets that detected health risks. The following 
health impacts are considered:
Deaths of small children from lower respiratory 
infections
This health impact is assessed using the PM2.5 
concentration results from Lelieveld et al (2019) and 
the Global Burden of Disease risk function for lower 
respiratory diseases78.
The economic losses from these air pollution-related 
deaths are assessed based on the resulting reduction 
in life expectancy, with one year of life lost equating 
to economic losses of  EUR56,000 in the European 
Union, following the EEA cost-benefit methodology79, 
and adjusted by GNI PPP by country or region, with 
an elasticity of 0.9 as recommended by OECD80.
Diabetes, asthma and other chronic respiratory 
diseases, and disabilities caused by stroke
The Global Burden of Disease project81 has quantified 
the degree of disability caused by each disease into a 
“disability weight” that can be used to compare the 
costs of different illnesses. APPENDIX 1:  
METHODOLOGY

27
The economic cost of disability and reduced quality 
of life caused by diabetes and chronic bronchitis is 
assessed based on these disability weights, 
combined with the economic valuation of disability 
used by the UK environmental regulator DEFRA82. 
The valuation is adjusted by GNI PPP for other 
countries. For example, type 2 diabetes without 
complications has a disability weight of 4.9%, 
meaning that the cost of one year lived with diabetes 
is estimated at 4.9% of the cost of one year lived with 
disability, or US$4000 in the UK and US$1600 at 
world average income level.
The economic cost of asthma related to fossil fuel 
pollution is assessed based on two indicators: new 
cases of asthma linked to NO2 exposure, and 
emergency room visits related to PM2.5 and ozone 
exposure. An assessment of the direct and indirect 
cost per year associated with childhood asthma, 
including medical costs and loss of income to the 
child’s caregiver, found a cost of US$3,800 and 
US$4,000 in two different communities in California, 
US83. The midpoint of these two valuations is used for 
the estimates, adjusted by the ratio of California’s 
Gross Regional Product to US national average, and 
by GNI PPP for other countries. The cost of an 
emergency room visit is taken from the same study.
Exposure to PM2.5 is very likely linked to an even 
larger number of new asthma cases globally than 
exposure to NO2, but uncertainty in the estimates is 
large84, so this effect is not included. Instead, we 
include the economic cost of emergency room visits 
for asthma linked to PM2.5 and ozone exposure, which 
is only a small part of the overall cost of the burden 
of asthma linked to PM2.5. Preterm Birth
PM2.5 exposure to pregnant women increases the 
likelihood of preterm birth and low birth weight, 
which in turn increases the risk of many health and 
development issues throughout a baby’s life. 
Approximately 2 million preterm births per year can 
be attributed to the exposure of pregnant women to 
PM2.5 pollution from fossil fuels specifically, based on 
CREA analysis using the Lelieveld et al (2019) 
concentration results and the concentration-response 
relationship established by Trasande et al85. The same 
study estimated the economic costs of a preterm 
birth, primarily lower economic productivity and 
increased health care costs, at US$300,000 per birth 
in the US. This concentration-response function and 
cost estimate is used in the analysis; the valuations 
are adjusted using GDP PPP within regional groups.
Work Absence
Exposure to PM2.5 air pollution from fossil fuels leads 
to increased work absences due to illness (sick 
leave). We estimate the incidence of work absences 
using WHO recommended concentration response 
functions86. The economic cost of these sick leaves is 
evaluated at EUR130 per day in the European Union, 
based on EEA recommendations87, and adjusted for 
other countries based on GDP PPP.APPENDIX 1:
