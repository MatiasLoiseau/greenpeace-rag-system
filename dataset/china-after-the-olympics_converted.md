Executive
Summary

Beijing is a city of 16.33 million and China overall boasts 1.3 billion
people  –  20%  of  the  world’s  population.    As  a  rapidly  developing
nation  with  growing  energy  and  resource  needs,  no  nation  has  a
more important role to play than China in making the urgent transition
to sustainable development.

Section 1: Executive Summary

Greenpeace’s rating of Beijing should be
taken in the context of a number of factors:

•	As	a	developing	country,	China	faces	serious		environmental

challenges associated with its rapid growth, population

and  limited  experience  in  environmental  solutions.  Yet,

the  environmental  Olympic  initiatives  and  investment

made  by  Beijing  in  some  cases  far  exceed  those  of

many  developed  and  developing  countries  with  vast

experience in managing environmental issues such as

Sydney and Athens.

•	A	 number	 of	 Beijing’s	 achievements	 represent	 the

world’s  best  environmental  practice  —  a  huge  leap

from  the  existing  polluting  or  destructive  technologies

and systems currently in use throughout the developing

world. In this, Beijing has been able to show that making

the transition to more sustainable approaches is possible

when a concerted effort is made.

•	Despite	 Greenpeace’s	 earlier	 on-going	 engagement

with  the  Beijing  Organizing  Committee  for  the  Games

of  the  XXIX  Olympiad  (BOCOG)  in  the  form  of  regular

consultations,  during

the  drafting  of

the

report,

Greenpeace  did  not  have  sufficient  access  to

important  information  regarding  Beijing’s  environmental

progress.	 This	 has	 made	 it	 difficult	 for	 Greenpeace	 to

accurately gauge how successful Beijing’s environmental

initiatives have been.

In  our  analysis  from  the  information  available,  Greenpeace

found  that  Beijing  achieved  and  in  some  cases  surpassed

original  environmental  goals  but  also  missed  some

opportunities  that  could  have  ensured  a  better  short-  and

long-term environmental Olympic legacy for the city.

This  report  aims  to  provide  an  independent  assessment

of  the  environmental  initiatives  of  Beijing’s  2008  Olympic

Games. In 2006 Beijing’s population was 16.33 million and

China overall boasts 1.3 billion people – 20% of the world’s

population.  As  a  rapidly  developing  nation  with  growing

energy and resource needs, fewer nations have a more

important role to play than China in making the urgent transition

to sustainable development.

The Olympics “Green” theme has been the force driving both

short-term projects and long-term infrastructure initiatives in

Beijing. Planning for this international mega event has presented

unique environmental challenges and opportunities for Beijing as

it has for all Olympic hosts.

Beijing’s original bid and additional environmental
commitments include the following:

•	While	air	quality	during	the	period	of	the	Games	in	2008

will  be  of  a  high  quality,  and  meet  Chinese  and  World

Health Organization (WHO) standards, Beijing municipal

government is nonetheless committed to achieve a high

standard for the whole year.

•	Cleaner	 energy	 will	 be	 supplied	 to	 the	 urban	 area	 for

domestic  usage  and  natural  gas  consumption  will  be

increased	by	a	factor	of	five	by	2007.

•	By	2007	exhaust	from	new	vehicles	will	be	reduced	by	60%.

A full list of commitments is provided throughout this report.1

Beijing’s key achievements include:

•	The

introduction	 of	 state-of-the-art	 energy	 saving

technology  in  Olympic  venues  —  for  example  the

Olympic Village will showcase various technologies such

as  solar  hot  water,  geothermal,  and  solar  photovoltaic

(PV)  systems.  These  represent  a  welcome  shift  away

from a reliance on polluting fossil fuels.

•	Beijing	 has

increased

its	 new	 vehicle	 emissions

standards to EURO IV ahead of schedule for the Games

in an attempt to improve air quality. This is amongst the

most stringent emissions standards in the world.

•	Beijing	has	added	four	new	rail	lines	for	the	city,	as	well

•	BOCOG’s	 dialogue	 and	 consulting	 with	 NGOs	 during	 the

Games  represent  a  positive  step  towards  the  increased

collaboration between government and civil society in China.

•	Sponsors	 have	 delivered	 specific	 environmental

commitments.  100%  of  Coca-Cola’s  5  658  units  of

Olympic coolers and vending machines will feature HFC-

Overall,  Greenpeace  believes  that  the  environmental  efforts  of  BOCOG  and  the  Beijing  municipal
government have created a positive legacy for the city of Beijing. Beijing did more than Athens and
should be commended for its efforts in using the Games as an opportunity to upgrade and improve city
infrastructure as well as to integrate leading energy saving technologies in Games venues. Many of
Beijing’s environmental initiatives have set a good example for other Chinese cities to follow. However,
in part due to inadequate transparency and engagement with third party stakeholders, Beijing’s green
Games  efforts  do  not  meet  the  comprehensive  approach  of  the  Sydney  Government  before  and
during  the  2000  Games.  In  addition,  the  International  Olympic  Committee  (IOC)  has  an  important
role to play in ensuring that all Olympic host cities meet some minimal environmental standards and
should require the use of independent verifiers for large-scale Games venues to encourage the best
environmental legacies for all Olympic Games.

Greenpeace and the Olympic Games
Greenpeace  became  actively  involved  in  campaigning  for

the inclusion of environmental solutions through the Olympic

Games  in  1992  when  the  organization  commissioned  an

architect  to  design  a  green  Olympic  Athlete’s  Village,  which

was  submitted  to  an  anonymous  competition  initiated  by

Sydney  organizers.  Greenpeace’s  design  was  one  of  the

winners and the concept of a Green Olympics was hatched

to extend to all of Sydney’s Olympic development.

Greenpeace	 produced	 its	 first	 complete	 Olympics	 environmental

assessment report2 on Sydney’s efforts just before the Games

in  2000  to  provide  an  independent,  third  party  assessment

of how effective the city was in achieving its goals. After the

Games, Greenpeace released a new set of guidelines — The

Greenpeace  Olympic  Environmental  Guidelines3—  to  assist

the IOC, future Olympic host cities and the organizers of any

large  event  to  learn  from  and  surpass  Sydney’s  efforts.  In

2004, a second assessment4 by Greenpeace was carried out

in  Athens  to  test  whether  the  lessons  learnt  at  Sydney  had

been	taken	up	to	further	fulfill	the	guidelines	and	commitments

made in the name of a Green Olympics.

The Sydney Games were able to set an example in the areas

of non-incineration remediation technology for toxic contamination

on site and to introduce various energy saving and water saving

technologies for Olympic facilities. More importantly, the Sydney

Games  were  able  to  set  an  example  of  how  sustainable

technological  solutions  could  be  introduced  into  Olympics

design and planning. The success stories in Athens, compared

with Sydney, were mostly in the area of public transportation

development — the extension of the metro and the construction

of a new tramway and suburban rail — while fewer initiatives

were taken by the Athens government and the Athens Olympics

organizing committee for the Olympic Games itself.

In	2000,	Sydney,	Australia	hosted	the	very	first	Green	Games,

Research Methodology
This  report  is  based  on  the  information  currently  available.

While Greenpeace attempted to carry out some independent

investigation and research, overall this report relies heavily on

official	data	provided	by	the	Beijing	municipal	government	and

United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). Greenpeace

has used two major sources of information regarding Beijing’s

environmental  Olympics  deliverables  —  the  UNEP  “Beijing

2008  Olympic  Games  –  An  Environmental  Review”  report

and  BOCOG’s  information,  particularly  its  “Beijing  2008:

Environmental  Protection,

Innovation  and

Improvement

2001-2006 Update” report. In addition, Greenpeace met with

officials	 from	 BOCOG	 and	 Beijing’s	 Municipal	 Environmental

Protection	Bureau	to	verify	information,	facts	and	figures	on

Beijing Olympic venues and city initiatives.

In this evaluation, Greenpeace focuses on six key environmental

areas that are of importance for the city of Beijing: air quality,

energy  use/climate  change  and  refrigerants,  transportation,

water, forestry, and toxics and waste. We have used the city’s

initial	 bid	 commitments	 as	 stated	 in	 the	 official	 candidacy

file5  and  Beijing’s  Green  Olympics  Action  Plan6  as  well  as

Greenpeace’s recommendations for Olympic host cities drafted

in 2000 after the Sydney Games, to compare this to Beijing’s

achievements  and  missed  opportunities  delivered  for  the

Games.7 Greenpeace also includes some recommendations

for  the  city  of  Beijing  and  the  IOC  that  extend  beyond  the

Games. Greenpeace believes that all future host cities should

requests,  Greenpeace  could  mostly  only  obtain  access  to

information that was already publicly available from BOCOG

and  relevant  governmental  departments.  Therefore,  some

crucial data needed to comprehensively assess the Olympics

were  unavailable.  For  instance,  Greenpeace  has  learn

that  the  Olympic  Village  may  be  Leadership  in  Energy  and

The IOC should provide leadership in ensuring that future host

cities are more forthcoming in offering relevant environmental

information.  All  information  related  to  the  Olympics  should

be  made  publicly  available  to  third  party  stakeholders.  The

IOC  should  also  set  a  minimum  benchmark  from  which  the

environmental  achievements  of  cities  could  be  measured

and  rendered  comparable.  Greeenpeace  also  recommends

China beyond 2008

Successful  environmental  achievements  of  the  Olympic

Games  should  continue  to  be  extended  not  only  in  Beijing

but  throughout  China  after  the  Games.  Although  Beijing’s

current  efforts  to  develop  mass  transportation  and  to

implement  various  environmental  regulations  and  policies

are  encouraging  signs  that  environmental  understanding  is

growing within government, it is imperative that other Chinese

cities  which  will  undergo  similar  types  of  transformation

as  Beijing  over  the  next  twenty  years  learn  from  Beijing’s

achievements  and  mistakes.  Greenpeace  urges  that  all

Chinese  cities  consider  environmental  protection  when

devising  economic  development  policies.  Given  the  serious

environmental  challenges  China

faces  as  one  of  the

fastest  growing  economies  in  the  world,  the  environmental

achievements  of  the  Beijing  Games,  especially  long-term

infrastructural improvements, need to be broadly applied to

other cities in China beyond 2008.

Other Chinese cities need to:

Lessons learnt in Sydney and reality check for Beijing

Below  are  some  lessons  that  Greenpeace  took  away  from  the  Sydney  Games  and  the  realities  for  the  Beijing  Games.

Greenpeace believes that these lessons should be incorporated into the planning of every major sporting event in order to

ensure sustainable outcomes.

Table 1

LESSONS LEARNT IN SYDNEY

  REALITY CHECK FOR BEIJING

1
Make	 specific	 environmental	 commitments	 as	 part	 of	 your
development	 plans	 well	 before	 design	 plans	 are	 finalized	 and
construction begins. Make these commitments public.

2
Environmental	guidelines	must	be	clear	with	specific	benchmarks
that are non-negotiable, measurable and backed up by law. These
benchmarks  must  be  included  in  all  of  the  tenders  offered  for
Olympic developments and made public.

3
Olympic  organizers  and  developers  must  be  required  to  collect
and report information on all environmental aspects of their project
and make this information publicly available.

4
Independent auditing of all environmental information is essential
to ensure credibility.

Beijing	issued	environmental	commitments	in	its	candidacy	file	as
well as a list of major environmental initiatives. These documents
are  publicly listed on the BOCOG website.9

As for all host cities, Beijing’s environmental commitments, although
an important part of their bidding process, were not binding.

Although BOCOG has issued a set of guidelines about purchasing,
these  guidelines  were  not  made  mandatory.  Due  to  a  lack  of
transparency, it has been hard to verify whether these guidelines
have been honored.

Various  Chinese  universities  have  undertaken  environmental
assessments	of	specific	venues.	In	2007	the	UNEP	released	its
own environmental review of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games,
which	relied	on	site	visits	and	government	figures.	To	date,	this
is  the  only  comprehensive,  publicly  accessible  assessment  of
the Beijing Games.

5
No matter how Olympic construction is managed –with one project
manager  or  as  independent  projects  and  contracts-  Olympic
organizers  must  ensure  that  the  best  and  most  cost-effective
environmental systems and materials are used project-wide.

Although  the  Beijing  organizing  committee  has  issued  a  set  of
guidelines  about  purchasing,  they  were  however  not  mandatory.
Due to a lack of transparency, it has been hard to verify whether
these guidelines have been honored.

6
Great enthusiasm for and expertise in environmental building and
event management exists at all levels internationally. Seek out and
engage  those  innovative  and  creative  experts  and  companies
interested in the environmental success of your event.

7
High-level  and  consistent  consultation  with  the  community,
environmental  and  social  groups  is  essential  and  must  be
part  of  the  project  from  the  beginning.  A  clear  process  for
conflict	 resolution	 should	 be	 established	 as	 part	 of	 the	 city’s
Environmental Guidelines.

8
Education  about  environmental  initiatives  undertaken  and  the
benefits	gained	is	essential	at	all	levels,	from	the	public	to	athletes,
sponsors, the media and the commercial sector.

Beijing  has  partnered  with  various  international  governmental
for
institutions  such  as
Environmental  Protection  and  various
international
companies in Olympic venue design.

the

Environmental NGO representatives from Friends of the Earth and
Global Village of Beijing were invited to act as environmental advisors
for the Games. World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Conservation
International  (CI)  and  Greenpeace  were  also  consulted  on
environmental issues. The Games represented a good opportunity
to open the channels of communication between government and
NGOs in China. However, channels of communication need to be
more frequent and systematic for public participation.

A  number  of  environmental  and  public  education  campaigns
were  undertaken  by  BOCOG  and  partner  NGOs  with  support
from sponsors and media. However more transparent information
about what BOCOG achieved would create more understanding
on environmental initiatives at all levels of society.

385 Chinese species are listed as endangered.11 Of greatest

concern are China’s rapidly increasing greenhouse gas (GHG)

emissions levels over the past ten years. China is one of the

world’s largest GHG emitters, with an estimated 6 200 million

tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) released in 2006 from burning

The	environment	figured	prominently	in	Beijing’s	original	bid,

of  the  construction  of  the  Olympic  venues  and  the  relevant

planning, and preparation for the 2008 Olympics. The “Green

environmental protection issues.

Olympics” theme was one of three main themes of the 2008

Games.  In  the  Green  Olympics  Program  (GOP)  formulated

during  Beijing’s  bid  for  the  Games,  Beijing’s  action  plan  set

aside  a  total  investment  of  101.02  billion  RMB  (12.2  billion

USD) for green initiatives:  46.37 billion RMB (5.6 billion USD)

for the period of 1998-2002 and 54.65 billion RMB (6.6 billion

USD)16  for  the  period  of  2003-2007.17  From  1998-2007,

Beijing spent a total of 120 billion RMB (15.7 billion USD) on

environmental initiatives.18

To host an Olympic Games requires an enormous investment

in  infrastructure.  For  events  themselves,  some  31  venues

are needed inside the city of Beijing along with six venues in

other cities, namely a sailing venue in Qingdao, an equestrian

venue in Hong Kong and four venues for football preliminary

matches  in  Tianjin,  Shanghai,  Shenyang  and  Qinhuangdao.

Moreover,  there  are  76  training  venues  in  use  prior  to  and

during the Games.

Of the 31 Olympic competition venues, 12 are newly constructed

venues,  11  are  renovated  or  expanded/upgraded  venues

and  eight  are  temporary  venues.19  Key  venues  include  the

National Stadium (known as the Bird’s Nest), the National

Aquatics Centre (known as the Cube), the Shunyi Olympic

Rowing and Canoeing Park,  The  National  Indoor  Stadium,

and the Workers’ Stadium.

Post Olympics, the ownership of these venues will return to

various  municipal  governmental  agencies  with  the  largest

venues  to  be  owned  by  the  Beijing  municipal  government.

Others renovated venues will return to the State Sport General

Administration, and various district government administrations

and universities such as the Fengtai District Government, the

Haidian  District  Government,  Beijing  University,  and  Beijing

University of Technology.21

When  evaluating  physical  venues,  this  report  does  not

consider Olympic venues outside of Beijing.

The Beijing 2008 Games Environmental
Performance Evaluation

The following section evaluates Beijing’s commitments, achievements,
and  failures  in  six  different  areas.  As  well,  this  section  examines  the
initiatives and missed opportunities of sponsors and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) projects before and during the Games.

Air Quality

The	 Beijing	 municipal	 government	 identified	 air	 quality	 as

a  major  health  and  environmental  issue  long  before  the

Olympic Games. From 1998 to 2008, the government has

implemented various measures to reduce air pollution such

as upgrading industrial technology and relocating factories,

controlling  vehicle  emission  standards,  reforming  energy

structure  by  increasing  natural  gas  use,  and  introducing

renewable  energy  to  the  city.33  Beijing  is  currently  in  the

14th Phase of the city’s air pollution reduction measures. Air

quality  remains  a  major  concern  not  only  for  residents  but

also for athletes and international visitors alike.

Beijing’s  air  quality  is  subject  to  Standard  II  in  the  National

Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996).34 The

city’s ambient air quality is monitored by Beijing’s Environmental

3

/
g
µ

Monitoring Station, which includes a central monitoring station

and 27 automatic substations including nine national stations.35

The four main air pollutants related to human health impacts

currently  monitored  daily  by  the  Chinese  government  are

sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide

(NO2), and particulate matter (PM10).36 (For CO2 emissions, see

the Climate Change and Energy section).

According	to	official	figures	collected	by	the	monitoring	stations,

Beijing’s  annual  air  quality  has  shown  a  steady  improvement

since  1998.  In  most  cases,  most  monitored  pollutants  have

remained very similar from 2005 to 2007, however, the rate of

air quality improvement was most evident from 2000 to 2004.

The high annual mean level of PM10, the pollutant that stays

consistently above Chinese National Air Quality Standard II and

WHO Standard, remains a challenge for Beijing.

40. For SO2 WHO standards also sets Interim targets for pollutants. For SO2 the 24-hour concentration interim target-1(IT-1) is 125µg/ m3, interim target-2 (IT-2) is 50µg/m3.
41. For PM10 WHO standards also sets Interim targets for pollutants. For SO2 the 24-hour concentration interim target-1(IT-1) is 150µg/ m3, interim target-2 (IT-2) is 100µg/m3.
42. For an explanation of Ozone, please see the PM2.5 and Ozone section below.
43. At the time of Beijing’s bid for the Games in 2001, the most current WHO Air Quality guideline was the 1999 WHO Guidelines. The 1999 and 2005 guidelines differ in
that for SO2, the guideline value was decreased from the 1999 24-hour concentration of 125µg/m3 to 20µg/m3 in 2005. NO2 concentration remains the same while the
1999 WHO guideline offers no clear guideline for PM concentration.

growing energy demands while reducing emissions. Hosting

the  Olympics  has  provided  Beijing  with  a  great  opportunity

to test a range of approaches for rapid emissions reductions

that can be useful for the country overall. Until recently, Beijing

was the city with the highest energy consumption in China.

Shanghai has recently taken its place.

in  the  process  of  reforming  its  energy  structure  towards

cleaner and renewable energy sources, and these changes

are perhaps most evident in Beijing. China’s 11th Five-Year

Plan on energy development states that the country aims to

increase the share of natural gas in the primary energy mix

from 2% to 5.3% by 2010 and up to 10% by 2020.54 Beijing’s

ratio of natural gas consumption to total energy consumption

increased from 0.5 % in 1997 to 7 % in 2007.55 In 2000, the

Greenpeace Guidelines

Guideline 1 – Take all measures to minimize energy use in

the overall eco-cycle of the development project at all stages

— construction, use and maintenance of the development as

well  as  re-use,  recycling  and  deconstruction.  Solar  passive

design,  insulation,  natural  ventilation  and  energy-saving

materials should be given preference. Heating, cooling, lighting

and appliances are key areas where energy conservation or

systems requiring no energy should be used.

Guideline 2 – Eliminate the use of fossil fuel energy source

(coal, oil, gas) and replace them with renewable energy sources

such as solar, wind, hydro, wave, geothermal and bio-energy

development of clean renewable energy.

The most important initiatives are:

•	GHG emissions reduction

According	 to	 official	 data	 from	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Science	 and

Technology, the following emissions reductions were achieved

in Olympic venues and facilities:

Fengtai  Softball  Stadium  and  Chaoyang  Park
Beach Volleyball venue:Fengtai Softball Stadium also
has a solar PV system with a 27 kW capacity comprising

of 135 solar panels with 200kW capacity. The Chaoyang

Park  beach  volleyball  venue  has  a  40  kW  electricity

generation system.

Olympic Forest Park: A small solar photovoltaic power
station  with  an  area  of  1  000  m2  and  a  generation
capacity of 65 kW79 is currently being constructed at the
south main gate of the Forest Park for energy provision

and  educational  purposes  and  is  scheduled  to  be

completed in time for the Games.

Renewable Energy and Efficient Lighting – Grid-
connected solar PV lighting systems have been used in

and around seven Olympic venues, including the National

Stadium. These systems have a total capacity of more

than  600  kW  and  generate  more  than  580  000  kWh

every year. They are estimated to reduce 570 tonnes of
CO2 every year.80

Olympic Green: Solar semiconductor illuminating lawn
and  street  lighting  have  been  installed  throughout  the

Olympic Green. This solar lighting system captures solar

energy in the daytime and uses it for illumination at night.

The electricity generated by this system is used for 90%
of the lawn and street lighting in the Olympic Green.81

Various  venues:  Low  energy  “Light  Emitting  Diode”
(LED) lighting has been used in various venues such as the

National Aquatics Centre (Water Cube), saving 60-70% of

electricity use for the venue. This technology is also used

for the indoor lighting in the multi-purpose broadcasting
tower in the center of the Olympic Green.82

Contract  hotels:  BOCOG  has  also  encouraged  its
contract  hotels  to  switch  to  energy  saving  light  bulbs.

More	than	20	000	efficient	light	products	were	purchased
by a number of hotels.83

Beijing’s citywide energy initiatives (additional
to venues)
Technical renovation of large scaled plants
At the end of 2007, 16 000 large-sized coal-fueled boilers,

had  been  converted  to  cleaner  energy,  such  as  natural

gas (the majority) or LPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas) as well

as clean renewable solar and geothermal energy. 44 000

smaller  boilers  were  also  upgraded  to  become  more

energy	efficient.	Upgrading	industries	should	be	viewed	as

a priority for Beijing as moving away from a heavy reliance

on coal as a major energy source is needed for long-term

emissions reductions.

Geothermal wells for household heating
Between  1999-2006,  Beijing  invested  35.4  million  RMB
(4.53  million  USD)84  in  geothermal  wells  to  provide
household	heating.	According	to	official	data	released	by
the Beijing Municipal Bureau of State Land and Resources,
118  plants  were  in  operation  by  1998  and  174  new
geothermal wells were constructed between 1999-2006.
Of the 174 new wells, 141 provide heating to the city. At
the end of 2006, 6.6 million m2 had been connected to
the municipal geothermal well system, while 1.2 million m2
were used for household heating. This is the equivalent of
saving 180 000 TCE each year.85

Wind energy development
The  Olympics  have  played  an  important  role  in
the  development  of  wind  power  in  Beijing  and  its
surrounding areas. 20% of the Olympic venue electricity
used  during  the  Games  will  be  purchased  from  clean
wind  sources  supplied  by  the  Guanting  wind  power
station.	 This	 is	 Beijing’s	 first	 wind	 power	 generation
station with 33 wind turbines capable of generating 100
million  kWh  of  electricity  a  year.  The  Guanting  station
is being constructed in time for the Games. According
to  Chinese  news  sources  the  electricity  generated  by
this station is enough to meet the demands of 100 000
families per year.86 According to the national Renewable
Energy Law, a national subsidy has been put into place
for  renewable  energy  and  municipal  governments  are
also  encouraged  to  provide  their  own  special  funding
to  support  renewable  energy.  Renewable  wind  power
used at the Games will be subsidized by 0.3RMB more
per kWh.

Energy efficient light initiative
Since  the  start  of  Beijing’s  energy  saving  “Green
Lighting  Program,”  Beijing  has  changed  over  seven
million incandescent bulbs to energy saving CFLs in all
elementary  and  high  schools,  care  homes  and  across
the rest of the city.87

106. In the United States, emissions standards are regulated nationally through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), however California has introduced its own set of stricter
emission standard guidelines, which are managed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Other states may choose to follow either the national or California standards.
States currently following California’s standard (otherwise know as CARB) include Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

107. Although different emission standards developed by nine different regions in the world are not easily comparable due to differences in policy, approaches, test drive
cycles and units of measurement, some studies have developed a methodology to compare these programs. The “Comparison of passenger vehicle fuel economy
and greenhouse gas emission standards around the world,” prepared by Feng An and Amanda Sauer for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, concludes that in
terms of fuel economy and GHG emissions the new Chinese Standards are more stringent than those in Australia, Canada, California and the United States, but they
are less stringent than those in the European Union and Japan. For the detailed study please see: http://www.pewclimate.org/docUploads/Fuel%20Economy%20

the Beijing Hydro Demo Park and began operations in the same

year. These three buses will be used to transport international

and national athletes within the Olympic compound during the

Games  and  will  also  serve  to  raise  public  awareness  about

low-emission transport solutions.116

Public and free transportation during the
Games

BOCOG  is  encouraging  public  transportation  use  in  Beijing

throughout the Games. Those with tickets to Olympic events

can  travel  throughout  the  city  free  of  charge.  Free  public

transportation for ticket holders will last for 51 days.117

Hosting  the  Olympic  Games  presents  a  unique  opportunity

for  Beijing  to  introduce  state-of-the-art  technology  to  meet

the  transport  demands  of  a  mega  event  and  the  growing

transport needs of a fast developing city. Greenpeace strongly

recommends  Beijing  to  continue  to  focus  on  low-emission

public transport options for the city long after the Games.

In addition, with up to eight million bicycles in the city, Beijing

residents are one of the biggest groups of bicycle users in the

world. As Beijing develops, aside from investments in public

transportation,  Greenpeace  strongly  recommends  the  city

to actively support, encourage and enable bicycle use as a

major aspect of its transportation plan. Bicycle use has the

potential	 to	 provide	 both	 environmental	 and	 health	 benefits

for  residents  as  well  as  being  a  low-cost  transport  option.

Development of mass transit systems is the only way for large

cities such as Beijing to tackle pollution caused by vehicles

and	traffic	congestion.	Beijing	needs	to	continue	to	promote

mass public transport and move away from building highways

for private vehicles in its future development in order to set an

example for other Chinese cities to follow.

visitors during the games.

Missed Opportunities and Mixed Results
Beijing has made great strides in introducing cleaner energy

vehicles  for  the  Games.  However,  given  Beijing’s  problems

with  air  quality  caused  by  the  rapidly  increasing  number  of

private  vehicles,  Beijing  could  have  taken  more  aggressive

measures  to  tackle  the  fast  increasing  car  ownership  rate

in the city. Beijing could have also acted earlier to construct

public transit. Other Chinese cities should learn from Beijing’s

mistakes  and  prioritize  public  transportation  development

from the beginning stages of development.

Future Olympic Games - Recommendations
to the IOC
The IOC should highly encourage the development of mass

transportation systems as well as to promote bicycle use in Olympic

venues to minimize the negative impact of the Games on a city.

Water treatment system at Olympic Venues:
The  sewage  and  wastewater  reuse  systems  at  the

Olympic  site  use  various  treatment  methods  for  water

processing such as the Fixed Activated Sludge Treatment
(FAST)  wastewater  system134  which  uses  cultivated
microorganisms  to  digest  the  wastewater  to  transform

it	 into	 a	 clear,	 odorless	 and	 high-quality	 effluent.	 FAST

has	 obtained	 certification	 from	 the	 Canadian	 Great

Lakes water quality standard (the most stringent marine
standard in the world).135 Another technology that is used
for  wastewater  treatment  is  the  Membrane  Biological
Reactor  (MBR).136  These  technologies  have  allowed
some venues to achieve “zero-waste.”

Each	of	the	five	venues	including	the	National	Aquatics

Center (Water Cube), the Shunyi Water Park, the Olympic

Tennis Center, the Olympic Forest Park, and the Olympic

Center  all  have  wastewater  treatment  systems,  with  a

treatment capacity of  one million tonnes in total.

enterprises  in  the  catchment  area  close  to  the  reservoir  to

guarantee the quality of water supply to the city.138	Official

sources  report  that  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  quality  of

water  from  Miyun  and  Huairou  Reservoirs  will  continue

to  meet    portable  water  standards,  relevant  government

authorities	 have	 banned	 illegal	 construction	 and	 fish

farming, closed down small mines on the upper stream, as

well as developed rural sanitation facilities in the protection

zones for ground water resources.139

Missed Opportunities and Mixed
Results
Water	 efficiency	 is	 the	 most	 effective	 way	 to	 reduce	 water

demand.  Upgrading  outdated  water  infrastructure  is  vital

to	 ensuring	 efficiency.	 The	 Olympics	 offered	 Beijing	 a	 great

opportunity	to	improve	the	efficiency	of	its	water	infrastructure

to meet increased demand from the Games. While innovative

water  reuse  technologies  were  installed  in  Olympic  venues,

more could have been done to incorporate these technologies

in infrastructures more broadly across the city. Such initiatives

would	reduce	water	demand	and	improve	water	efficiency.

In  many  cases,  although  water  reuse  technologies  were

introduced into venues, they did not go far enough to ensure

that the Games had a minimal impact on the city’s precious

water  supply.  The  Shunyi  Olympic  Rowing  and  Canoeing

Park,  the  third  largest  venue  in  the  Games,  is  one  such

example. This venue is designed with water saving features:

it combines rowing and canoeing venues into one facility —

Olympic  water  demands.  There  will  also  be  a  72  000  m3/

However, this venue still draws a vast amount of water from

the  Miyun  water  reservoir.140  This  large,  water-demanding

The  Department  of  Finance  and  the  State  Environmental

Selected Achievements
Reforestation and greening

Olympic Forest Park:

The  Olympic  Forest  Park  is  located  directly  north  of  the

Olympic Green and occupies an area of 680 hectares, about

Olympic  venues.  Beijing  missed  an  excellent  opportunity  to

show  its  commitment  to  sustainable  forestry  by  developing

a	clear	and	specific	policy	and	to	openly	disclose	where	its

timber was sourced.

Beijing  has  also  missed  an  opportunity  to  establish  a  more

stringent  set  of  wood  purchasing  standards.  Beijing  could

have  furthered  its  greening  effort  to  exclusively  use  FSC-

certified	timber	in	Olympic	venues,	as	the	Sydney	organizing

sourced.  The  lack  of  a  binding  procurement  policy  and  a

lack of independent auditing mean that there is no third party

produces  5000-7000  tonnes  of  green  waste  a  year,  which

includes  grass,  leaves  and  branches  that  are  produced  by

plant life in the park. The treatment center at the north end

of  the  Park  can  process  about  3000  tonnes  of  waste  per

annum. There will also be a unique “yellow water” treatment

system that will process human waste to allow these waste

products to return to the park as fertilizer.

Beyond ozone-friendly — climate-

How do refrigerants used in air-
conditioning and food and beverage
cooling contribute to climate change?

In  the  race  to  save  the  ozone  layer  in  the  late  1980s,  the

chemical  industry  invented  a  new  set  of  chemicals  called

HFCs. These chemicals were to replace CFCs and HCFCs,

which  were  widely  used  in  refrigeration  and  air-conditioning

and were to be phased out under the Montreal Protocol due

to their ozone-destroying properties.

Selected Achievements

The Coca-Cola Company

Greenpeace has lobbied successfully for Coca-Cola to make

100% of its 5 658 coolers used in the Olympic venues HFC-

free. Coca-Cola’s coolers and vending machines will instead

be powered by CO2. Ironically, while CO2 is a potent GHG,

when  used  as  refrigerant,  it  has  a  negligible  impact  on  the

climate.170  Coca-Cola’s  coolers  will  be  the  largest  number

of HFC-free commercial refrigerators of this kind to ever be

introduced into China.

China’s  largest  home  appliance  manufacturer  is  providing

over  30  different  product  categories  to  the  Games.  Haier

receives  credit  for  promoting  prototypes  of  climate-friendly

and	 energy	 efficient	 solar-based	 HFC-free	 air-conditioners.

These prototypes, which use water — a natural refrigerant —

for cooling, will be partially showcased in the Olympic Village,

the tennis center and other venues. 172

Haier  is  to  be  commended  for  showcasing  HFC-free  air-

conditioner  prototypes,  however,  the  majority  of  Haier’s  air-

conditioners for Games venues still heavily rely on HFCs as

refrigerants.  Moreover,  while  Haier  has  provided  Coca-Cola

with  HFC-free  coolers,  which  can  be  seen  all  throughout

Olympic	 venues,	 Haier	 has	 also	 provided	 a	 large	 fleet	 of

commercial coolers using HFCs for other sponsors who did

not request Haier to supply HFC-free cooling technology.

Presently, a few prototypes of HFC-free air-conditioners exist

but this has not been taken up by the industry. HCFCs—which

are  to  be  phased-out  under  the  Montreal  Protocol—and

HFCs—which are to be regulated as part of Kyoto Protocol’s

basket of GHGs—still dominate the air-conditioning industry.

2008	 Games	 are	 the	 first	 time	 a	 developing	 country	 has

placed  sustainability  and  environmental  initiatives  at  the

forefront of its efforts to host the Olympics. The environmental

problems  Beijing  and  China  face  are  immense.  Beijing  has

come a long way and its efforts and achievements must not

be underestimated. For a developing country such as China,

the  Games  should  be  seen  as  an  opportunity  to  showcase

and to implement state-of-the-art energy saving technologies

in  new  infrastructures  and  as  a  catalyst  to  extend  Olympic

achievements  and  successful  environmental  policies  from

Beijing to other Chinese cities well beyond 2008.

Many  of  Beijing’s  problems  are  similar  to  other  developing

cities  and,  as  China  urbanizes,  the  lessons  learned  in  the

Beijing Olympics are vital for China to build sustainable cities

beyond 2008.

Future Olympic Games - Recommendations
to the IOC

The environmental achievements of the 2008 Beijing Games

demonstrate the positive impact that the Olympics can have

on	a	city	in	raising	the	profile	of	environmental	issues.	Many	of

the missed opportunities during these and other attempts to

host a green Games demonstrate the necessity for the IOC

to  set  a  minimal  comparable  set  of  standards  and  to  place

the  environment  at  the  forefront  of  policy  considerations  in

the planning of international events. As global efforts towards

addressing  climate  change  intensify,  and  the  impact  of  our

ecological  foot  print  becomes  more  evident,  it  is  time  for

the  IOC  to  issue  some  minimal  mandatory  standards  for

environmental protection to ensure that the goals expressed

in	 its	 Agenda	 21	 are	 fulfilled.	 Future	 Olympic	 organizing

committees  and  host  cities  should  be  required  to  meet

environmental guidelines.

In addition to being evaluated by organizations such as the

UNEP, the IOC should issue a set of standards for host cities

so  that  their  environmental  efforts  and  achievements  are

From Sydney to Beijing, host cities have taken a number of

excellent  initiatives  in  combining  environmental  awareness

with  the  Olympic  Games.  While  a  number  of  lessons  have

been  learned,  there  is  a  need  to  strengthen  efforts  in  other

areas, such as sponsors’ environmental records, as well as the

need for more transparency and independent assessments.

It  is  high  time  for  the  IOC  to  issue  a  set  of  environmental

standards for all host cities. The goals of the green Olympics

can only be realized through these concerted efforts.
