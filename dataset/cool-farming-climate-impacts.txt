Overall finding and conclusions:
Agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG). Agricultural soil and livestock directly emit
large amounts of potent greenhouse gases. Agriculture’sindirect emissions include fossil fuel use in farm operations,
the production of agrochemicals and the conversion of land
to agriculture. The total global contribution of agriculture,considering all direct and indirect emissions, is between 8.5 –
16.5 Pg CO
2-eq1,2, which represents between 17 and 32% of
all global human-induced GHG emissions, including land use
changes (Figure 1).
Some historic anomalies in the atmospheric GHG
concentrations can be attributed to early changes in farming
practices such as the development of wet rice cultivationseveral thousands of years ago. In the last century, there havebeen even more substantial changes in agriculture, with the
uptake of synthetic fertilisers, development of new crop
varieties (“Green Revolution”) and the adoption of large-scale
farming systems. The sustainability of modern “industrial”agriculture has been questioned.
The solution to the environmental problems caused by today’s
agricultural methods lies in a shift to farming practices which
could provide large-scale carbon sinks, and offer options for
mitigation of climate change: improved cropland management
(such as avoiding bare fallow, and appropriate fertiliser use),
grazing-land management, and restoration of organic soils as
carbon sinks. Since meat production is inefficient in its
delivery of products to the human food chain, and alsoproduces large emissions of GHG, a reduction of meatconsumption could greatly reduce agricultural GHG
emissions. Taken together, these could change the position ofagriculture from one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters toa much smaller GHG source or even a net carbon sink.Executive Summary

6Overview: The main sources of
greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture
Agriculture directly contributes between 5.1 and 6.1 Pg CO 2-
eq (10 – 12%) to global greenhouse gas emissions. These
emissions are mainly in the form of methane (3.3 Pg CO 2-eq
yr-1) and nitrous oxide (2.8 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1) whereas the net
flux of carbon dioxide is very small (0.04 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1). 
Nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions from soils and methane (CH 4)
from enteric fermentation of cattle constitute the largestsources, 38% and 32% of total non-CO
2emissions from
agriculture in 2005, respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions aremainly associated with nitrogen fertilisers and manure appliedto soils. Fertilisers are often applied in excess and not fully
used by the crop plants, so that some of the surplus is lost as
N
2O to the atmosphere. Biomass burning (12%), rice
production (11%), and manure management (7%) account for
the rest (Table 1).
Clearing of native vegetation for agriculture (i.e. land use
change rather than agriculture per se) does release largequantities of ecosystem carbon as carbon dioxide (5.9 ± 2.9Pg CO
2-eq yr-1).
The magnitude and relative importance of the different
sources and emissions vary widely between regions. Globally,agricultural methane (CH
4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions
have increased by 17% from 1990 to 2005, and are projected
to increase by another 35 – 60% by 2030 driven by growingnitrogen fertiliser use and increased livestock production.Table 1. Sources of direct and indirect

8Agrochemicals and climate change
In addition to the direct agriculture emissions mentioned
above, the production of agrochemicals is another important
source of greenhouse gas emissions. Especially the life cycleof fertiliser contributes significantly to the overall impact ofindustrialized agriculture. The production of fertilisers is energyintensive, and adds a noticeable amount, between 300 and600 million tonnes (0.3 - 0.6 Pg) CO
2-eq yr-1, representing
between 0.6 - 1.2% of the world’s total GHGs. The greatest
source of GHG emissions from fertiliser production is the
energy required, which emits carbon dioxide, although nitrateproduction generates even more CO
2-eq in the form of nitrous
oxide. With the intensification of agriculture, the use offertilisers has increased from 0.011 Pg N in 1960/61, to 0.091Pg N in 2004/2005. Application rates vary greatly betweenregions with China contributing 40% and Africa 2% to globalmineral fertiliser consumption.
Compared to fertiliser production, other farm operations such
as tillage, seeding, application of agrochemicals, harvestingare more variable across the globe with emissions between0.06 and 0.26 Pg CO
2-eq yr-1. Irrigation has average global
GHG emissions of between 0.05 and 0.68 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1.
The production of pesticides is a comparatively low GHG
emitter with 0.003 to 0.14 Pg CO 2-eq annually. 
Land use 
The amount of carbon stored in croplands is the lowest of all
land types (with the exception of deserts and semideserts).
Therefore, all land use change to cultivated land will result in anet emission of carbon. However, the actual contribution ofland use change has a high uncertainty, but is estimated to be5.9 ± 2.9 Pg CO
2-eq. Land use change is mainly driven by
economics and legislation, but also by the availability of land.The main expansion of global croplands is thought to be over,
though expansion into tropical forests continues to be a majorproblem. Global woodland areas are projected to decrease atan annual rate of ~43,000 km
2, but developed countries are
projected to increase their woodland area by 7,400 km2
per year . Animal farming 
Animal farming has a wide range of different impacts, ranging
from the direct emissions of livestock, manure management,
use of agrochemicals and land use change to fossil fuel use.Enteric fermentation contributes about 60%, the largestamount, to global methane emissions. The demand for meatdetermines the number of animals that need to be kept.Furthermore, the livestock sector is the largest user of land,
with a shift in practice away from grazing to the growth of
livestock feed crops. The use of high energy feed crops has
recently encouraged the deforestation of the Amazonrainforest in Brazil, a major producer of soya used in animalfeed. The demand for meat is increasing steadily, driven byeconomic growth, and is likely to encourage the expansion ofintensive animal farms. The greatest increase in meatconsumption is observed in developing countries (77%increase between 1960 and 1990), which previously had avery low meat consumption (8% of calories from animalsources) compared to developed countries (27% of calories
from animal sources) in 1960. Sheep and beef meat have the
highest climate impact of all types of meat, with a globalwarming potential of 17 and 13 kg CO
2-eq per kg of meat,
while pig and poultry have less than half of that.Executive Summary

9Mitigation
Agriculture has a significant climate change mitigation
potential, which could change the position of agriculture from
the second largest emitter to a much smaller emitter or evena net sink. There are a wide range of mitigation options in
agriculture with an overall potential of up to 6 Pg CO
2-eq yr-1,
but with economic potentials of around 4 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1at
carbon prices up to 100 US$ t CO 2-eq-1. This overall potential
could mitigate close to 100% of agriculture’s direct emissions.By far the greatest mitigation contribution originates from soil
carbon sequestration (5.34 Pg CO
2-eq yr-1), but also methane
(0.54 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1) and nitrous oxide (0.12 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1)
emissions can be considerably reduced.
The low carbon concentration in croplands means that there
is a great potential to increase carbon content through
beneficial management practices. Where land uses havechanged to become predominantly agricultural, restoration of
the carbon content in cultivated organic soils has a high per-
area potential and represents the area of greatest mitigation
potential in agricultur e.
The most prominent options for mitigation in agriculture
emissions are:
1. Cropland management (mitigation potential up to ~1.45 Pg
CO
2-eq yr-1) such as: 
•Avoiding leaving land bar e: Bare soil is prone to erosion
and nutrient leaching and contains less carbon than the
same field with vegetation. Important solutions are “catch”and “cover” crops, which cover the soil in between theactual crop or in fallow periods, respectively.
•Using an appropriate amount of nitrogen fertiliser by
avoiding applications in excess of immediate plant
requirements, by applying it at the right time, and by
placing it mor
e precisely in the soil.  Reducing the reliance
on fertilisers by adopting cropping systems such as use ofrotations with legume crops has a high mitigation potential. 
•No burning of cr
 op residues in the field.•Reducing tillage: No-till agriculture can increase carbon in
the soil, but in industrial farming settings this maybe of
fset
by increasing reliance on herbicides and machinery.
However, for organic systems some preliminary study
results showed that reduced tillage without the use of
herbicides has positive benefits for carbon sequestrationin the soil. 
2. Grazing land management (mitigation potential up to ~1.35
Pg CO
2-eq yr-1) such as reducing grazing intensity or reducing
the frequency and intensity of fires (by active fire management).
These measures typically lead to increased tree and shrub
cover, resulting in a CO 2sink in both soil and biomass.
3. Restoration of organic soils that are drained for cr op
production and restoration of degraded lands to increase
carbon sinks (combined mitigation potential ~2.0 Pg CO 2-eq
yr-1): avoid drainage of wetlands, carry out erosion control,
add organic and nutrient amendments. 
4. Improved water and rice management (~0.3 Pg CO 2-eq yr-
1); in the off-rice season, methane emissions can be reduced
by improved water management, especially by keeping the
soil as dry as possible and avoiding waterlogging.
5. Lower but still significant mitigation is possible with set-
asides, land use change (e.g., conversion of cropland to
grassland) and agro-forestry (~0.05 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1); as well
as improved livestock and manure management (~0.25 Pg
CO 2-eq yr-1). 
6. Increasing efficiency in the manufacturing of fertilisers can
contribute significantly with a reduction of up to about ~0.2 Pg
CO 2-eq yr-1. Improvements would be related to greater energy
efficiency in ammonia production plants (29%), introduction of
new nitrous oxide reduction technology (32%) and other
general energy-saving measures in manufacturing (39%).
7. Consumers can play an important role in the reduction of
agricultural GHG emissions. A reduction in the demand for
meat could reduce related GHG emissions considerably.
Adopting a vegetarian diet, or at least reducing the quantity of
meat products in the diet, would have beneficial GHG impacts.A person with an average US diet for example, could save 385
kcal (equating to 95 – 126 g CO
2) of fossil fuel per day by
replacing 5% of meat in the diet with vegetarian products.

12Agricultural practices have changed dramatically since the
time of hunters and gatherers, which initially were related toland use change and changes in management practices likeirrigation and tillage. Several historical greenhouse gas (GHG)anomalies are thought to be associated with these shifts like,for example, an increase in the methane concentration with
the start of paddy rice farming in Asia about 5000 years ago
(Desjardins et al., 2007). These anomalies are presented in
detail by Ruddiman (2003), and Salinger (2007). With an ever
incr
easing population to feed, larger scale changes were
needed to meet the demand for food. During the 20thcentury,
agronomic research focused on creating high yielding
varieties, and agriculture intensified by mechanisation and theuse of agrochemicals such as mineral fertilisers, herbicidesand pesticides. The “Green Revolution” enabled, for example,cereal production in Asia to double between 1970 and 1975with a concurrent land use change to agriculture of only 4%.However, it generally encouraged the further expansion into
previously uncultivated areas due to higher profits (IFPRI,
2002). Intensive agriculture relies on high external inputs,particularly of fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides, irrigation andfossil fuels, applying management strategies that are simpleto maintain at a large scale (Jackson et al., 2007). The
environmental and social costs (pollution, loss of biodiversityand traditional knowledge) ar
e high and may potentially
undermine future capacity to maintain required levels of foodproduction (Jackson et al., 2007) (Foley et al., 2005).It is curr
ently estimated that there is still more land under
extensive agriculture (17%) compared to intensive agriculture(10%), with an even greater share occupied by domesticlivestock (40%). However, with an increasing demand forfood, this may change in favour of more and more intensivelyfarmed land (Jackson et al., 2007). Indeed, some have
argued that since land suitable for conversion to agricultur
e is
dwindling (Desjardins et al., 2007), intensification on the
agricultural land currently available will be the only way to feedthe pr
ojected 9 billion people on the planet (FAO, 2002) by the
end of this century (Riedacker and Dessus, 1997). In additionthe increasing competition for access to the dwindling stocksof fossil fuels will increase the competitiveness of crops grown
for bioenergy and will cause a financial incentive to increase
the amount of land used for intensive arable purposes, andultimately lead to higher prices for agricultural and for estry
products (Sims et al, 2006) and competition for land between
energy and food pr
oduction.
Agriculture is a major contributor of GHGs to the atmosphere,
but the emissions vary depending on the land use and the waythat the land is managed. However, a quantified separation ofintensive and extensive agriculture is difficult for a number of
reasons, a) there are many complex interactions between
different practices and effects, b) statistics on intensity of landuse are rarely available (statistics are collected in a differentform), and c) often, intensive and non-intensive farming
practices are present on the same farm, making categorisationof farms as intensive / non-intensive very difficult. For thisreason, we focus on the individual practices known to influence
GHG emissions to the atmosphere, and were possible wepresent information at the aggregated systems level to examinethe impacts of intensive vs. non-intensive agriculture. 1. Introduction

132. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture
©B Arnold/Greenpeace
Recently, the contribution of Working Group III to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) FourthAssessment Report assessed greenhouse gas emissiontrends from agriculture (IPCC WGIII Ch.8, 2007). The followingtwo sections are largely derived from that report. 
2.1 Global GHG emissions from
agriculture, excluding land use change
Agricultural lands (lands used for agricultural production,
consisting of cropland, managed grassland and permanent
crops including agro-forestry and bio-energy crops) occupy
about 40-50% of the Earth’s land surface. Agriculture
accounted for an estimated emission of 5.1 to 6.1 Pg CO 2-eq
yr-1in 2005 (10-12% of total global anthropogenic emissions
of GHGs). Methane (CH 4) contributes 3.3 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1and
nitrous oxide (N 2O) 2.8 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1. Of global
anthropogenic emissions in 2005, agriculture accounts forabout 60% of N
2O and about 50% of CH 4(IPCC WGIII Ch.8,
2007). Despite large annual exchanges of CO 2between the
atmosphere and agricultural lands, the net flux is estimated tobe approximately balanced, with CO
2emissions around 0.04
Pg CO 2yr-1, though clearing of native vegetation for
agriculture (i.e. land use change rather than agriculture per se)
does release large quantities of ecosystem carbon as carbon
dioxide (5.9 ± 2.9 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1(IPCC, 2001)). 
Globally , agricultural CH 4and N 2O emissions have increased by
nearly 17% from 1990 to 2005, an average annual emission
increase of about 0.06 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1. During that period, the
five regions composed of developing countries and countries
with economies in transition showed a 32% increase, andwere, by 2005, responsible for about three-quarters of totalagricultural emissions. The other five regions, mostlyindustrialised countries, collectively showed a decrease of 12%in the emissions of these gases (IPCC WGIII Ch.8, 2007).
Nitrous Oxide emissions from soils and CH
4from enteric
fermentation constitute the largest sources, 38% and 32% of
total non-CO 2emissions from agriculture in 2005, respectively
(US-EPA, 2006a). Biomass burning (12%), rice production(11%), and manure management (7%) account for the rest.Both the magnitude of the emissions and the relativeimportance of the different sources vary widely among worldregions. In Africa, North America, Europe and most of Asia(seven of the ten world regions as defined by US-EPA 2006a),N
2O from soils was the main source of GHGs in the
agricultural sector in 2005, mainly associated with N fertilisersand manure applied to soils. In Latin America and the
Caribbean, the countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus
and Central Asia, and OECD Pacific (the other three regions in
US-EPA 2006a) CH
4from enteric fermentation was the
dominant source (US-EPA, 2006a; IPCC WGIII Ch.8, 2007).This is due to the large livestock population in these threeregions which, in 2004, had a combined stock of cattle and
sheep equivalent to 36% and 24% of world totals,
respectively (FAO, 2002).
Emissions from rice production and burning of biomass were
heavily concentrated in the group of developing countries,
with 97% and 92% of world totals, respectively. While CH
4
emissions from rice occurred mostly in South and East Asia,
where it is a dominant food source (82% of total emissions),those from biomass burning originated in Sub-Saharan Africaand Latin America and the Caribbean (74% of total). Manuremanagement was the only source for which emissions where
higher in the group of developed regions (52%) than in
developing regions (48%; US-EPA, 2006a).
The balance between the large fluxes of CO
2emissions and
removals in agricultural land is uncertain. A study by US-EPA
(2006b) showed that some countries and regions have net
emissions, while others have net removals of CO 2. Except for
the countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central
Asia, which had an annual emission of 0.026 Pg CO 2yr-1in
2000, all other countries showed very low emissions or
removals.
Globally, agricultural CH 4and N 2O emissions increased by
17% from 1990 to 2005, an average annual emission
increase of 0.058 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1(US-EPA, 2006a). Both
gases had about the same share of this increase. Thr ee
sources together explained 88% of the increase: biomass
burning (N 2O and CH 4), enteric fermentation (CH 4) and soil
N2O emissions (US-EPA, 2006a). 

142. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture
2.2 Projected changes in GHG emissions
from agriculture over the next 25 years
Agricultural N 2O emissions are projected to increase by 35-
60% up to 2030 due to increased nitrogen fertiliser use and
increased animal manure production (FAO, 2002). Similarly,Mosier and Kroeze (2000) and US-EPA (2006a) estimated that
N
2O emissions will increase by about 50% by 2020 (relative to
1990). If demands for food increase, and diets shift as
projected, then annual emissions of GHGs from agriculture
may escalate further. But improved management practices
and emerging technologies may permit a reduction inemissions per unit of food (or protein) produced, and perhapsalso a reduction in emissions per capita food consumption.
If CH
4emissions grow in direct proportion to increases in
livestock numbers, then global livestock-related methane
production (from enteric fermentation and manure
management) is expected to increase by 60% in the period1990 to 2030 (FAO, 2002). However, changes in feeding
practices and manure management could ameliorate this
increase. US-EPA (2006a) forecast that combined methaneemissions from enteric fermentation and manure
management will increase by 21% between 2005 and 2020.
The area of rice grown globally is forecast to increase by 4.5%
to 2030 (FAO, 2002), so methane emissions from riceproduction would not be expected to increase substantially.There may even be reductions if less rice is grown under
continuous flooding (causing anaerobic soil conditions) as a
result of scarcity of water, or if new rice cultivars that emit less
methane are developed and adopted (Wang et al., 1997).
However
, US-EPA (2006a) projects a 16% increase in CH 4
emissions from rice crops between 2005 and 2020, mostlydue to a sustained increase in the area of irrigated rice.
No baseline agricultural non-CO
2GHG emission estimates for
the year 2030 have been published, but according to US-EPA
(2006a), aggregate emissions are projected to increase by~13% during the decades 2000-2010 and 2010-2020.Assuming similar rates of increase (10-15%) for 2020-2030,agricultural emissions might be expected to rise to 8 – 8.4,with a mean of 8.3 Pg CO
2-eq by 2030. With projected globalmedian emissions of about 55 Pg CO 2-eq in the same time
period, agriculture would contribute about 15% (IPCC WGIIICh.8, 2007) equating to a 3% increase of its contribution.
However, this slight increase has a high uncertainty
considering the wide potential ranges of future emissions. The future evolution of CO
2emissions from agriculture is
uncertain. 
The Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa
have the highest projected growth in emissions, with acombined 95% increase in the period 1990 to 2020 (US-EPA,2006a). Sub-Saharan Africa is the one world region where
per-capita food production is either in decline, or roughly
constant at a level that is less than adequate (Scholes andBiggs, 2004). This trend is linked to low and declining soilfertility (Sanchez, 2002), and inadequate fertiliser inputs.Although slow, the rising wealth of urban populations is likely
to increase demand for livestock products. This would result
in intensification of agriculture and expansion to still largelyunexploited areas, particularly in South and Central Africa(including Angola, Zambia, DRC, Mozambique and Tanzania),with a consequent increase in GHG emissions.
East Asia is projected to show large increases in GHG
emissions from animal sources. According to FAO (FAOSTAT,
2006), total production of meat and milk in Asian developingcountries increased more than 12 times and four times,
respectively, from 1961 to 2004. Since the per-capitaconsumption of meat and milk is still much lower in these
countries than in developed countries, increasing trends are
expected to continue for a relatively long time. Accordingly,US-EPA (2006a) forecast increases of 153% and 86% inemissions from enteric fermentation and manure
management, respectively, from 1990 to 2020. In South Asia,
emissions are increasing mostly because of expanding use of
N fertilisers and manure to meet demands for food, resulting
from rapid population growth.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, agricultural products are
the main source of exports. Significant changes in land useand management have occurred, with forest conversion to
cropland and grassland the most significant, resulting in
increased GHG emissions from soils (CO
2and N 2O). The
cattle population has increased linearly from 176 to 379million head between 1961 and 2004, partly offset by adecrease in the sheep population from 125 to 80 million head.All other livestock categories have increased in the order of 30to 600% since 1961. Cropland areas, including rice andsoybean, and the use of N fertilisers have also showndramatic increases (F AOST AT, 2006). Another major trend in
the region is the increased adoption of no-till agricultur e,
particularly in the Mercosur area (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay,and Uruguay). This technology is used on ~300,000 km
2
every year in the region, although it is unknown how much ofthis area is under permanent no-till (IPCC WGIII Ch.8, 2007).
In the countries of Central and Easter n Eur ope, the Caucasus
and Central Asia, agricultural production is, at present, about
60-80% of that in 1990, but is expected to grow by 15-40%
above 2001 levels by 2010, driven by the increasing wealth ofthese countries. A 10-14% increase in arable land area is
forecast for the whole of Russia due to agricultural expansion.
The widespread application of intensive managementtechnologies could result in a 2 to 2.5-fold rise in grain andfodder yields, with a consequent reduction of arable land, butwill increase N fertiliser use. Decreases in fertiliser N use since
1990 have led to a significant reduction in N
2O emissions.
But, under favourable economic conditions, the amount of N
fertiliser applied will again increase, although unlikely to reachpre-1990 levels in the near future, due to the increasing costof manufacture driving efficiency in use. US-EPA (2006a)projected a 32% incr ease in N
2O emissions from soils in these
two r egions between 2005 and 2020, equivalent to an
average rate of increase of 0.004 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1.
OECD North America and OECD Pacific are the onlydeveloped regions forecasting a consistent increase in GHG
emissions in the agricultural sector (18% and 21%,respectively between 1990 and 2020). In both cases, thetrend is largely driven by non-CO
2emissions from manure
management and N 2O emissions from soils. In Oceania,nitrogen fertiliser use has increased exponentially over thepast 45 years with a 5 and 2.5 fold increase since 1990 inNew Zealand and Australia, respectively. In North America, in
contrast, nitrogen fertiliser use has remained stable; the main
driver for increasing emissions is management of manurefrom cattle, poultry and swine production, and manureapplication to soils. In both regions, conservation policieshave resulted in reduced CO
2emissions from land
conversion. Land clearing in Australia has declined by 60%since 1990 with vegetation management policies restrictingfurther clearing, while in North America, some marginalcroplands have been returned to woodland or grassland. 
Wester n Eur ope is the only region where, according to US-
EPA (2006a), GHG emissions from agriculture are projected to
decrease up to 2020. This is associated with the adoption ofa number of climate-specific and other environmental policies
in the European Union, as well as economic constraints on
agriculture (IPCC, WGIII, Ch. 8, 2007).
2.3 Indirect emissions arising from
agricultural practices
In the previous two sections only the direct agricultural
emissions are considered, however, for a complete analysisthe indirect carbon emissions, which arise from use of farmmachinery, production of fertilisers, production and use of
pesticides and irrigation should be added to estimate the totalGHG emissions from agriculture. 
Table 2 shows a summary of global GHG emissions of
different farm operations (Lal, 2004c). The large ranges in
values reflect different management practices, but still there isa high uncertainty associated with these values. This is aresult of the extrapolation to the total cropland and arable
land, which may in general not all require irrigation and
therefore is generally overestimated. On the other hand,permanent pastures have not been considered at all, whichare in some parts managed to some extent. Generally,management practices and therefore energy consumption willvary widely in different global regions, which is reflected by thewide range (one order of magnitude!) of emissions that may
be emitted at a global level (Table 2). In contrast, the emission 

162. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture
range of fertiliser production and use is much narrower.
Emissions from fertiliser are based on the global consumption
and the minimum value (0.284 Pg) is actually very similar tothe global emissions (0.283 Pg) as given by Kongshaug(1998). The sum of all farm practices (including fertiliser)contributes a significant amount to global carbon emissions,
between 0.4 and 1.7 Pg of CO
2-eq. Here, the production of
fertiliser is the largest single emitter (0.3 – 0.6 Pg CO 2-eq),
followed by the use of farm machinery for a variety of
management practices (0.06 – 0.26 Pg CO 2-eq), irrigation
(0.05 – 0.68 Pg CO 2-eq) and pesticide production (up to 0.14
Pg CO 2-eq).Total global agricultural GHG emissions will be the sum of
agricultural emissions (5.1 – 6.1 Pg, 10 – 12 % of total global
emissions), land use change (5.9 ± 2.9 Pg; 6 – 17 % of totalglobal emissions), agrochemical production/distribution (0.3 –0.7 Pg, 0.6 – 1.4 % of total global emissions) and farmoperations (including irrigation) (0.1 – 0.9 Pg, 0.2 – 1.8 % of
total global emissions). Consequently, the total global
contribution of agriculture considering all direct (such as soil
and livestock emissions) and indirect (such as fossil fuel use,fertiliser production and land use change) would be between16.8 and 32.2 %, including land use change (see section 3.2).

3.1 Greenhouse gas emissions from the
production, transport and use ofagricultural fertilisers
Fertilisers are increasingly used in agriculture (Figure 3 and
Figure 4). The life cycle of fertiliser contributes significantly tothe overall impact of conventional agriculture. The productionof fertilisers is energy intensive, and emits about 1.2% of the
world’s total GHGs (Wood and Cowie, 2004). Before 1930,
nitrates used to be mined but this practice is now moreexpensive than the synthetic fertiliser production using fossilfuel energy with which it has been replaced. There is a greatdifference between the energy requirements, and hence GHGemissions, for the production of different types of fertilisers(Table 3). Generally, fertilisers containing N compounds
consume up to 10 times more energy and consequently
result in more GHG emissions. In comparison, fresh manure is
a very low carbon emitting alternative when it is available to
provide land with nutrients (Lal, 2004c) (Table 3). However, theactual energy consumed during the production can varywidely as very modern plants have the potential to efficientlyuse the heat produced during the reaction process and hence
may even have a negative energy balance, for production of
nitrate will also generate nitrous oxide as a by-product.Considering that nitrous oxide has a global warming potentialof ~296 compared to carbon dioxide, this is the main GHG inthe nitrate production (Brentrup et al., 2004) (Wood and
Cowie, 2004). As a r
esult, nitrous oxide contributes 26%
(0.074 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1) of the global total fertiliser production
GHG emissions (0.283 Pg CO 2-eq yr-1) (Kongshaug, 1998).
The energy consumption of superphosphate and muriate of
potash will mainly be associated with mining activities.Additional greenhouse gas emissions will arise from thetransport of these fertilisers as mines are not evenlydistributed around the world (www.fertilizer.org). Generally,transport and storage will add more to the total GHGemission of fertiliser use (Table 3 & Table 4).
The final use of the fertiliser on the farm will have again a
variety of impacts. The machinery used to apply the fertiliserwill require fuel, adding to the GHG emissions. Fertilisers arenot used fully by the crop, which on average globally onlyrecover about 50% of fertiliser N supplied (Eickhout et al.,
2006). Consequently, a great pr
 oportion accumulates in soilsand is either lost directly as nitrous oxide, or leaches intowater courses, enhancing downstream, indirect nitrous oxideemissions. The amount lost will greatly depend on many otherfactors such as climate, soil and management practices(Brentrup et al., 2004) (Eickhout et al., 2006).
3.1.1 Effect of agriculture intensification on
fertiliser use and emissions.
The intensification of agriculture has greatly increased the use
of fertilisers in the last century, which is reported to have
increased by over 800% in about 45 years, from 0.011 Pg N
in 1960/61, to 0.091 Pg N in 2004/2005 (www.fertilizer.org).
However, application rates vary greatly between differentcountries (Figure 3) with rates mainly driven by economy andlegislation. Generally, there is a great difference in the fertiliser
consumption between developed and developing countries
(Figure 4). The decreasing trend in developed countries isdriven by environmental legislation, which may imposethreshold levels with associated fines. Furthermore, consumerpressure through supermarkets encourages the uptake of
Environmental Management Systems, which address a varietyof issues resulting in the optimisation of fertiliser use (Furness,2003). Within the developing countries China (40% globally;95% of East Asia) and India (20% globally; 80% of SouthAsia) are the main drivers of the increase in fertiliser use(Figure 4). In China, the cost of fertilisers has been very low,
achieved by subsidies for production and distribution before
1985 (Zeng, 2003). Consequently, application rates are muchhigher than in other parts of the world (Figure 3). This causesnot only an increase in GHG emissions, but also pollution andeutrophication of watercourses. In this case, the high number
of small-scale farmers makes it difficult to monitor fertiliser use
and enforce more sustainable practices (Zeng, 2003). The
Chinese case is contrasted by the situation in Africa, which
only uses 2% of the total global fertiliser consumption(www.fertilizer.org). In fact, the amount used by small-scaleAfrican farmers is usually underneath the recommended level
for the maintenance of soil fertility, resulting in nutrientdepletion and loss of soil organic matter (i.e. lower carbon
levels in the soil) (Batjes, 2004).

203.2 Greenhouse gas emissions from
deforestation and land conversion causedby the expansion of agriculture intouncultivated areas. 
Generally, intensively managed land will have lower carbon
stocks than natural vegetation (Table 5 & Figure 5). Croplands
have the lowest “carbon stock concentration” of all earthbiomes, except for deserts and semideserts. In contrast,wetlands have by far the greatest “carbon stockconcentration” (more than eight times that of croplands) butthey do not even contribute twice as much to the global
carbon stock due to the small percentage of land covered by
wetlands (Table 5). As a result, the conversion from one land
use to croplands can have a considerable effect on carbonstocks (Figure 5).
Houghton (1999, 2003) estimated the net global emissions
resulting from land cover change to be about 8.1 Pg CO
2yr-1
in the 1990s (compared with 23.4 Pg CO 2yr-1from fossil-fuel
emissions). Here, agriculture was the most importantcontributor to land conversion (croplands 68%, pastures13%, cultivation shift 4%, harvest of wood 16% andestablishment of plantations -1%) (Houghton, 1999) and
contributes to around 20% of total GHG emissions. In
contrast, the IPCC published values of 5.9 ± 2.9 in 2001(IPCC, 2001). Estimates of land use changes are probably themost uncertain within the GHG inventory (Figure 6 & Figure 7),
as actual emissions will depend on several factors
(Ramankutty et al., 2007). Despite the uncertainty, it is clear
that land use change is a major contributor to global GHGemissions. In some ar
eas, such as e.g. Brazil, it will even be a
more important source of GHG than fossil fuels (Cerri et al.,
2007). Brazil alone contributed 5% of total global GHG
emissions by deforestation in 1990 (Fearnside, 2005).
However
, the total emissions resulting from this deforestation
will be even greater, since future changes in land use couldresult in further emissions (Fearnside, 2005).
For a complete estimation of the impact of land use change
on global climate there are also several non-GHG effects to
consider, which alter the physical properties of the land
surface. These effects are discussed, for example, in Pielke Sr et al., (2007), Foley et al., (2005).

3.2.1 Historic and future trends
Land cover change is the oldest global impact of human 
kind (Kates and Parris, 2003). However, the rate of change
has increased dramatically, and since 1945 more land wasconverted to cropland than in the previous two centuries
combined (Cerri et al., 2007). In the last four decades,
agricultural land increased by about 10% (4.43 M km
2), which
was achieved at the expense of forest land and other landmainly in the developing world (Table 6). Croplands andpastures are among the largest ecosystems on the planet,rivalling forest cover in extent and together occupy ≈ 35% ofthe ice-free land surface (Ramankutty et al., 2007). This
amount of land is still mor
e than half as much than would be
required if crop yields would have remained at the levels from1961 (Mooney et al., 2005). The period of major expansion
into uncultivated lands is thought to be over 
, as most arable
land with a good quality is already being used apart fr om
some areas in humid, tropical regions (Desjardins et al.,
2007). Generally two global trends can be observed:“decreasing tropical and incr
easing temperate boreal forests”
(Kates and Parris, 2003). Both these trends are driven mainlyby economics. Agriculture in temperate regions has become
less viable on more marginal lands that are often convertedback to woodland. Siberia is an exception wheredeforestation rates are still very high (Kates and Parris, 2003).
On the other hand, in tropical rainforest regions, global tradeencourages the destruction of the forest to make way forcroplands and grasslands. Consequently, the area of for est
has been reduced by almost 10% since 1980 (Desjardins et
al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2006) forecasting that by 2030 the
annual global incr
ease in agricultural, arable and permanent
cropland will be 45,250, 12,690 and 89,130 km2, respectively.
In contrast, permanent pasture and woodland areas will in thesame time decrease by an annual rate of 40,490 and 42,860km
2, respectively . Here, again there is a marked differ ence
between different regions generally with developed countries,particularly Europe,  showing a reverse to the global trend asthe area of woodlands is expected to increase annually by7,400 (developed countries) and 13,720 km
2(Europe), 
(Zhang et al., 2006).Brazil experienced a defor
estation of 93,700 km2between
2001 and 2004 (Morton et al., 2006). The deforestation
occurr
ed at a rate of between 10,000 and 30,000 km2yr-1
since 1978. There is no consistent trend, but the rate is linked
to macroeconomic factors. A rising demand for soybean andbeef contributed to increased Brazilian deforestation rate from
2001 to 2004 (Fearnside, 2005) (Morton et al., 2006).
Similarly 
, Southeast Asia lost 23,000 km2between 1990 and
2000 for timber harvest and agricultural expansion. In
contrast, forests are being replanted in East Asia with Chinaincreasing its woodland area by almost 100% (from 127,400
to 231,100 km
2) (Zhao et al., 2006). This trend, though to a
lesser extent, can also be observed in Japan and South
Kor
ea. However, a reduction in the water surface through
building of dams and drainage of wetland areas can beobserved all over the Asian continent (Zhao et al., 2006).

specific agricultural practices

25Generally, animal farming produces significant GHG emissions
resulting from emissions from the animals themselves andactivities associated with the farming of animals. Sources are:
1. Direct livestock emissions 
2. Manure management3. Use of agrochemicals (fertiliser, pesticides and antibiotics)4. Land use
5. The use of fossil fuels for a variety of applications
We examine these in more detail below.
4.1 Direct livestock emissions
When farming ruminant animals, the animals themselves
produce the greatest amount of GHGs (up to 60%) through
enteric fermentation in the rumen. Other components of theoverall GHG emissions contribute roughly similar amounts,with the use of diesel and electricity being at the lower end(Casey and Holden, 2006). Globally, livestock is the mostimportant anthropogenic source of methane emissions (US-
EPA, 2006a). Methane is a powerful GHG with ≈ 20 times the
global warming potential of CO
2.
There are considerations when comparing intensive versusnon-intensive livestock production, not least animal welfareissues. Whereas non-intensive systems can be shown to be
far more desirable in terms of animal welfare, the position with
respect to GHG emissions is less clear. The amount of
methane emitted by animals is directly related to the number
of animals, so that a more intensive farm will have higheremissions (http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/newsanddoc/article_2087_en.htm), though the emissions perunit of product (e.g. meat, milk) might be lower (IPCC WGIII
Ch.8, 2007). The demand for meat products determines thenumber of animals that need to be raised. An intensive farmmay spare land for other purposes by optimising yield on highquality land and, hence, minimising the area that is used foragriculture (Mooney et al., 2005, Dorrough et al., 2007).
However
, it is argued that using less land directly for
agriculture will still have an effect on surrounding lands due to
high concentrated emissions and different requirements to the
infrastructure (Matson and Vitousek, 2006). Furthermore, thelength of time it takes to rear an animal has decreaseddramatically in intensive farming systems (e.g. from 72 days in1960 to 48 days in 1995 for broiler chickens). Generally,chickens and pigs use concentrated feed (high protein) moreefficiently compared to cattle, which enabled a considerablereduction in the rearing time. As a result, the production ofthese meats has also increased (Naylor et al., 2005). Given
that the demand of meat has to be met (expecting large,
unfor
eseen global shifts in projected consumption patterns),
intensive farming reduces the time necessary to produce the
same quantity of product, hence reducing GHG emissions perunit of product. Furthermore, the increase in the production ofchickens and pigs may also be favourable considering that
these animals produce much less GHG (pig: 1 – 1.5 kg CH
4
head-1yr-1) by enteric fermentation compared to cattle (dairy
cattle: 36 – 100 kg CH 4head-1yr-1) and sheep (5 – 8 kg CH 4
head-1 yr-1) (US-EPA, 1998). 
4.2 Manure management
There are several ways of managing animal manure, whichcan either be stored wet (e.g. slurry) or dry (e.g. farm yard
manure). Methane emissions occur mainly when the manureis managed in liquid forms (lagoon or holding tanks) or remainwet. Generally, intensive livestock systems use liquid manure
management due to the large quantity of manure producedand the method of collection (Reid et al., 2004). A typical
system for large scale pig operations ar
e lagoons (although
not in Europe). Manure deposited on fields and pastures or
otherwise handled in dry form do not produce significantamounts of methane (Reid et al., 2004). Emissions also
depend on the animal’ 
s diet: Higher energy feed produces
manur e with more volatile solids, i.e. decomposable organic
matter that may emit more GHG depending on surroundingenvironmental conditions. Pig production produces the largestshare of manure, followed by dairy (Steinfeld et al., 2006). If
the liquid manur
e is used for methane production (biogas
plants) that is used for energy to replace fossil fuels then the
net GHG emissions could be significantly less for pig
production than ruminant production.4. Impacts of intensive animal
farming on the global climate

264.3 Use of agrochemicals
GHG emissions associated with the production and use of
fertiliser have been discussed is section 2. Intensive animal
farming will have a high demand on the supply of feed crops,hence, furthering the use of fertiliser. Here, even crops that
are associated with N fixing organisms (such as soybean) and
require less additional nitrogen, are fertilised (Steinfeld et al.,
2006). Feed cr 
ops will also receive pesticides to ensure the
protection against pests, which may reduce yields. The
production of pesticides is also energy-intensive and hence
adds to the overall GHG budget of intensive animal farming(Table 2) (Lal, 2004c).
Intensive conventional farms may also make use of antibiotics
as a preventive measure rather than for treating actual
diseases. Considering the high density of livestock, this
measure is perceived to be necessary to avoid the
development of devastating epidemics. Furthermore, drugs,
such as antibiotics and steroids, are often given to speed up
the fattening process (Centner, 2003), though these are
banned in some regions. These extra resources have
associated energy and GHG costs.
4.4 Land use
Livestock is the world’s largest user of land with a shift from
grazing to the consumption of feed crops. Industrial livestock
systems are now often separated from feed crops and the
end consumer to take advantage of lower costs and
potentially less rigid environmental regulations (Naylor et al.,
2005). This r
esults in further emissions from transport. The
great demand of feed and space for animal farming furthers
cultivation of land, especially deforestation of rain forest.
Generally, intensive farming uses more supplement feed
rather than feeding the livestock on grassland (Eickhout et al.,
2006). Some of these feeds ar
e often not produced in the
same country. Here, soya plays an important role as a highenergy feed for which Brazil is one of the main producingcountries (FAOSTAT, 2007). Intensive animal farming indirectlysupports the deforestation of Brazilian rain forest for soyaplantation (Fearnside, 2005) with some European countriesshowing a negative carbon / GHG balance due to livestockfeed imports (Janssens et al., 2005). On the other hand, the
use of supplement feed for ruminants is known to r
educe
methane emissions from enteric fermentation (IPCC WGIIICh.8, 2007). The impact of feed crops can be reduced ifindustrial food waste (e.g. mash from ethanol production orresidue from vegetable oil milling), which is not suitable for
human consumption, is used as animal feed. This approach
covers about 70% of the animal feed in the Netherlands
(Nonhebel, 2004).
Intensive animal farming may also result in overgrazing of
grassland, which may then reduce the carbon stocks and
even lead to desertification (Steinfeld et al., 2006).
4.5 Fossil Fuel use
Energy consumption varies widely between different practicesand farming systems. Generally, more modern systems use
the bulk of total energy input on the production of feed. Apart
from fertiliser, this includes seed, pesticides, machinery andelectricity (water supply, heating, drying). The on-farm energy
consumption of intensive systems can exceed the carbon
dioxide emissions of the N fertiliser production.
On the other hand, processing of the agricultural product may
often be less efficient at a smaller scale, so that intensivesystems may conserve energy (Barrett et al., 2001). Generally,
the dairy sector is one of the highest energy-consuming
sectors due to pasteurization, cheese making and dried milk.
Furthermor
e, the required refrigerated transport is energy
intensive and vehicles are often not loaded to full capacity(Steinfeld et al., 2006).
4.6 Effect of increasing meat (and animal
feed) demand on future agriculturalemissions of greenhouse gases
Economic growth is usually accompanied by an increasing
demand for meat, as more people can af ford it (Eickhout et al.,
2006). In addition, populations are still increasing in developingcountries which will fuel an incr
eased demand for food even in
the absence of dietary changes. The UN predicts that the
world population will continue to increase from the present
about 6.5 billion and stabilise at over 9 billion (UN, 2004).4. Impacts on the global climate
of intensive animal farming

Currently, meat consumption is still greater in developed
countries than in developing countries (Table 7). However, thedemand for animal products is rapidly increasing indeveloping countries and rose from 11 to 24 kg capita
-1yr-1
during the period 1967-1997, corresponding to an annualgrowth rate of more than 5% (IPCC WGIII Ch.8, 2007). IPCC
WGIII Ch.8 (2007) concluded that 
•Growing demand for meat may induce further changes in
land use (e.g., fr
om forestland to grassland), often
increasing CO 2emissions, and increased demand for
animal feeds (e.g., cereals). Larger herds of beef cattle will
cause increased emissions of CH 4and N 2O, although use
of intensive systems (with lower emissions per unit
product) is expected to increase faster than growth in
grazing-based systems. This may attenuate the expected
rise in GHG emissions.•Intensive production of beef, poultry, and pork is
incr
easingly common, leading to increases in manure 
with consequent increases in GHG emissions. This is
particularly true in the developing regions of South and
East Asia, and Latin America, as well as in North America.
(IPCC WGIII Ch.8, 2007)
The FAO (2002) forecasts a further increase of 60 % in global
meat demand by 2030, mostly in South and Southeast Asia,
and Sub-Saharan Africa. The greatest increases in demandare expected for poultry (83% by 2020; Roy et al., 2002).
Annual GHG emissions from agriculur
e are expected to
increase in the coming decades (included in the baseline) dueto escalating demands for food and shifts in diet (IPCC, WGIIICh.8, 2007).

The emissions of GHGs from agriculture depend on the
combination of production system and site factors. The sameproduction system can have different impacts on different soiltypes, etc. On mineral soils, the amount of standing biomass(above - and below ground) and annual input of organicmatter to the soil will determine carbon storage. The most
important carbon mitigation mechanism in the short term is to
avoid deforestation, primarily in tropical countries (IPCC WGIII
Ch.8, 2007). This strategy has other environmental benefits aswell. Any practice that can give rural income without more useof land, or by taking degraded land back into production,should therefore be encouraged. All benefits obtained on aper hectare basis of one land use type - have to be seen inconnection with the total area of land required to produce the amount of food or other product needed.
Activities such as agr oforestry may be useful to increase soil
fertility as well as carbon stocks (Cacho et al., 2003), though
this depends on the initial land condition and use and the
management methodology
. The highest benefits can be
obtained if degraded soils can be reclaimed (IPCC WGIIICh.8, 2007). Some estimates of carbon mitigation potentialare given by Bloomfield and Pearson (2000). Targeting small-
holders for carbon sequestration programmes can be a good
strategy, both in terms of carbon sequestration and povertyalleviation, but the transaction costs (administration,verification) may be higher for smallholdings (Cacho et al.,
2003). Generally, forest projects are r elatively inexpensive and
cost e.g. around 40 to 100 times less than Activities
Implemented Jointly (AIJ) energy pr
ojects (Table 8). However,
forest projects are less standardised in regard to baselinesand actual costs so that values given in Table 8 should beconsidered with caution. It still becomes clear that a largerscale makes the costs much more economic with the biggestproject (target area 750 km
2) costing much less (0.25 $ Mg
CO 2-1) compared to the smaller projects (10 – 60 km2) at a
price of around $ 3.5 per Mg of carbon dioxide.Smallholder farms may often store more carbon thancommercial arable agriculture due to more trees (Roshetko et
al., 2002), but it is not known if they also use a larger area topr
oduce the same amount of food (see below).
There are not many studies where small scale and intensivefarming systems are compared. Mrini et al., (2002) compares
energy use under traditional and intensive farming systems inMor 
occo, and concludes that the energy use is less in the
traditional system, which uses less energy per unit produced(0.73 and 1.10 MJ kg
-1respectively). The main reason for the
difference in energy use between the two systems was the
irrigation system used. However, they also compared their
results with other studies of intensive and traditional farmingsystems, and they found that generally, the traditional farmingsystems used less energy per unit of product. Although it canbe difficult to compare systems, it does suggest thattraditional systems may be more energy efficient (at least
measured on per product rather than per ha basis). The
reasoning for this may be less use of machinery.
In developed countries, organic agriculture has been
championed as the most sustainable form of agriculture.
Williams et al., (2006) performed a life cycle analysis of the
global warming potential of some food products in Englandand Wales (T
able 9). They found clear GHGs benefits for
some products, but not all. While organic milk, eggs andpoultry showed no benefits in terms of GHGs, organic wheat
bread, oil seed rape and potatoes showed benefits (lower
global warming potential) than conventional ones (Table 9,Williams et al., 2006).

They show examples of the benefits that can be obtained in terms of carbon sequestration, as well as the costs (from Cacho et al., 2003).Organic field crops and animal products generally consume
less primary energy than non-organic counterparts, owing in
part to the use of legumes to fix N rather than fuel to make
synthetic fertilisers (Williams et al., 2006). In relation to this,
many studies have found that the emissions r
elated to crop
production are lower in organic farms than in conventional
farms when measured as a per hectare basis, but this
advantage of organic production is less clear in units of crop
yield, since yields are lower for some crops in organic farms(Flessa et al., 2001, Tzilivakis et al., 2005, Petersen et al.,
2006).
Organic farmers usually apply practices that pr
omote carbon
sequestration in the soil and could favour GHG savings fr om
organic cropping. Common organic practices like the use of
cover crops, growing trees and shrubs around croplands andavoiding bare soils are all proposed mitigation options foragriculture (IPCC WGIII Ch.8, 2007) already in place in many
organic farms worldwide. More scientific research is needed
to evaluate the specific carbon benefits of these practices in
organic farms.Table 9: Global warming potential (CO 2

Agriculture has a significant mitigation potential, which could
change the position of agriculture from one of the largestemitters to a much smaller emitter or even a net sink. Thepotential has been estimated by several researchers and hasbeen summarised by the IPCC, 2007 (Figure 8). Mitigation isdefined by the IPPC WGIII (2007) as a technological change or
substitution which reduces the GHG emissions or enhances
carbon sinks. The potential can be calculated by comparing the
current or projected emissions/sink under a given baseline (e.g.business as usual with no mitigation put in place) with theemissions/sink occurring if a change in management (i.e.mitigation) were put in place. Much of the information containedin this section is drawn from IPCC WGIII Ch.8 (2007).The most recent estimate of mitigation potential fromagriculture by Smith et al., (2007), which is also one of the 
only two global estimates, gives a maximum global mitigationpotential of 6 Pg CO
2-eq yr-1. However, not all of the technical
potential can be realised. The economic potential is amaximum of 4.3 Pg CO
2-eq yr-1at a carbon price of 100 
US$ t CO 2-eq (Smith et al., in press). Here, by far the 
gr
eatest mitigation contribution originates from soil carbon
sequestration (89%) and only some potential in mitigatingmethane (9%) and nitrous oxide (2%) emissions (Smith et al.,
in pr 
ess) (Figure 8).

Generally, the impact of mitigation measures is very versatile.
They can act on mainly one GHG or more than one GHG. Inthe latter case, there may be positive impacts on more thanone GHG, or there may be trade-offs between gases.Consequently, a combined effect of all the gases has to beconsidered. In addition, the effectiveness will depend on
region and climate (with the exception of livestock mitigation)
so that the same measure may have opposite effects in
different parts of the globe. The length of mitigation impactwill also vary, with some effects being indefinite and othersreaching saturation over time. This means that mitigationpractices are not universally applicable but need to beassessed individually for each agricultural environment (IPCCWGIII Ch.8, 2007). In the following sections, the potential ofseveral mitigation options is described separately. Generally,several options may operate via similar mechanisms.
Where a practice affects radiative forcing through other
mechanisms such as aerosols or albedo, those impacts also
need to be considered (Marland et al., 2003; Andreae et al.,
2005), though these impacts ar
e small relative to the impact
on GHGs.
6.1 Mitigation potential from increasing
carbon sinks. 
There are several options to increase carbon sinks; these can
be divided into two main approaches: 1) restoration of naturalvegetation and 2) sustainable management practices of thefarmed land. 
6.1.1 Restoration of natural vegetation
Croplands contain the lowest concentration of carbon (apartfrom deserts and semideserts) compared to any other landuse (Table 5 & Figure 5). Therefore, the reversion of croplandto another land cover, typically one similar to the nativevegetation is one of the most effective methods of reducingemissions / increasing carbon sinks. Considering that theopposite land use change, from natural to cropland
contributes considerably (20%) to global GHG emissions, itwould also be desirable to conserve the current naturalvegetation. Generally, land use change is limited by the available land,which is usually limited to surplus agricultural land or
croplands of marginal productivity. A conversion may either
occur “over the entire land area (set-asides or abandonedfarms)”, or “in localized spots, such as grassed waterways,field margins, or shelterbelts” (Follett, 2001; Freibauer et al.,
2004; Lal, 2004b; Falloon et al., 2004; Ogle et al., 2003)”.
W
ithin the restoration of natural vegetation one can
distinguish between two fundamentally different types: 
a) dry vegetation and b) wetlands.
The conversion of arable cropland to grassland or for est
typically acts as a carbon sink (Guo and Gifford, 2002). 
This is a result of less soil disturbance and reduced carbon
removal, which would usually take place in the form of
harvest. Uncultivated grasslands and forests will also usually
emit less N 2O provided that the previous cropland was
fertilised, higher rates of CH 4oxidation, but recovery of
oxidation may be slow (Paustian et al., 2004).
Converting drained cr
oplands back to wetlands can result in
an even greater carbon sink (Table 5 & Figure 5 ). On the
other hand it may stimulate CH 4emissions because water-
logging creates anaerobic conditions (Paustian et al., 2004). 
6.1.2 Sustainable management practices 
The low carbon concentration in croplands (Table 5) means
that it has a great potential to increase in carbon content
through beneficial management practices. In contrast, grazing
lands already have higher carbon stocks as they are usuallyless intensely managed and disturbed. General approaches toincrease soil carbon stocks in croplands are: 
•Increase of yield
•Reduction of soil disturbance
•Agroforestry
•Avoiding bare soil. 

Increase of yield:
An increased yield will also increase the amount of carbon
that is sequester
ed by the plant and released into the soil
during growth, or when incorporating plant residues into the
soil. Furthermore, less land may be required, which may then
be available for land use change to natural vegetation, asdiscussed above. 
Apart from fertilisation (discussed below), there are several
means through which the crop yield can be increased. These
include water management, improved locally adapted cropvarieties, and the introduction of legumes into grassland. The
effectiveness of irrigation will depend on the energy that is
required to deliver the water and its availability. Furthermore,
soil with higher water content may also be a greater source of
nitrous oxide (Liebig et al., 2005, Schlesinger 1999, Mosier et
al., 2005, Follett, 2001; Lal, 2004a). Crop varieties could be
improved in a number of ways to increase their yield, which
may not necessarily incr
ease the net photosynthesis but
addresses other issues. The crop could, e.g., have a greaterwater or nutrient use efficiency, increasing the yield at thesame input, or enabling a reduction in external inputs, and theassociated energy required to supply this input whilst
maintaining the same yield. For example, water intensive
varieties of maize could be replace by other locally adaptedvarieties that need less water or nutrients and produce thesame yield. Similarly, the introduction of leguminous species
into grassland will increase the productivity or reduce the
amount of fertiliser that is required (Sisti et al., 2004; Diekow
et al., 2005, Soussana et al., 2004).
Reduction of soil disturbance and residue management:
Soil disturbance by tillage aerates the soil which enhances
micr
obial decomposition, and hence the loss of carbon. The
traffic by machinery or livestock and the tillage will also lead tosoil erosion and compactions and poor drainage. Thesedisturbances can be reduced by minimal (conservation) or notill practices and less intensive grazing. The carbon benefitsfrom no-till agriculture may be offset by increasing reliance inherbicides and machinery (both practices contribute to GHGemissions) and may affect biodiversity negatively (CBDTechnical series no. 10).With regard to grazing, there is an optimal stocking rate, atwhich the carbon accrual will be greater than on ungrazedland. (Liebig et al., 2005; Rice and Owensby, 2001). The
ef
fects are inconsistent, however, owing to the many types of
grazing practices employed and the diversity of plant species,
soils, and climates involved (Schuman et al., 2001; Derner et
al., 2006). The influence of grazing intensity on emission of
non-CO 2gases is not well-established, apart from the direct
effects on emissions from adjustments in livestock numbers.
Systems that retain crop residues also tend to increase soil
carbon because these residues are the precursors for soil
organic matter, the main carbon store in soil. Avoiding the
burning of residues (e.g., mechanising sugarcane harvesting,
eliminating the need for pre-harvest burning (Cerri et al., 2004)
also avoids emissions of aer
osols and GHGs generated from
fire, although CO 2emissions from fuel use may increase
(IPCC WGIII Ch.8, 2007). 
Agro-forestry: 
Agro-forestry is the pr oduction of livestock or food crops on
land that also grows trees for timber, firewood, or other tree
products. It includes shelter belts and riparian zones/buffer
strips with woody species. The standing stock of carbonabove ground is usually higher than the equivalent land use
without trees, and planting trees may also increase soil
carbon sequestration (Oelbermann et al., 2004; Guo and
Giffor 
d, 2002; Mutuo et al., 2005; Paul et al., 2003). But the
ef
fects on N 2O and CH 4emissions are not well known
(Albrecht and Kandji, 2003).
Avoiding bare soil:
Bare soil is prone to erosion and nutrient leaching. In regard
to soil carbon it will always be lower than the same crop with
vegetation due to the carbon in the above and belowgr
ound
biomass. This can be reduced by using “catch” and “cover”crops which will cover the soil in between the actual crop or in
fallow periods, respectively. (Barthès et al., 2004; Freibauer et
al., 2004)
326. Potential for the mitigation of greenhouse
gas emissions from agriculture

The sequestration of carbon into agricultural soils contributes
the largest part (89%) of the total agricultural mitigationpotential (Smith et al., 2007). Here, management practices will
be able to stor 
e more than twice as much carbon than land
use change to wetland and other natural vegetation. This is
due to the greater proportion of land available for thismanagement change. Within land use change, restoration oforganic soils contributes by far the greatest mitigation
potential due to the high per-area potential.
6.1.3 Mitigation potential from grazing
land, livestock, and manure management 
Grazing land management
The management of grazing land for the mitigation of carbon
emissions has been partly cover
ed in the previous section. An
additional significant practice is the management of fire ongrasslands. This is carried out to renew the grass. The fireitself will release GHGs as well as reactive hydrocarbon andnitrogen gases. The smoke aerosols will also have a complexeffect on the atmosphere. The effect on woody biomass canbe either positive or negative, depending on the occurrence of
spontaneous fires or the purpose of the fire to clear woodybiomass. Therefore, the mitigation can either involve 1) the
reduction of the frequency or extent of fires through moreeffective fire suppression; 2) or the reduction of the fuel loadby vegetation management; and burning at a time of year
when less CH
4and N 2O are emitted (Korontzi et al., 2003).
Although most agricultural-zone fires ar
e ignited by humans,
there is evidence that the area burned is ultimately underclimatic control (Van Wilgen et al., 2004). In the absence of
human ignition, the fir 
e-prone ecosystems would still burn as
a result of climatic factors. Reducing the frequency orintensity of fires typically leads to increased tree and shrubcover, resulting in a CO
2sink in soil and biomass (Scholes and
van der Merwe, 1996). This woody-plant encroachmentmechanism saturates over 20-50 years, whereas avoided CH
4
and N 2O emissions continue as long as fires are suppressed.Livestock management
There are several approaches by which the direct livestock
emissions can be r
educed.
Improved feeding practices: Methane emissions can be 
reduced by feeding more concentrates, normally replacing
forages (Blaxter and Claperton, 1965; Johnson and Johnson,1995; Lovett et al., 2003; Beauchemin and McGinn, 2005).
Although concentrates may incr 
ease daily methane emissions
per animal, emissions per kg-feed intake and per kg-product are
almost invariably reduced. The magnitude of this reduction per
kg-product decreases as production increases. The net benefitof concentrates, however, depends on reduced animal numbersor younger age at slaughter for beef animals, and on how the
practice affects land use, the N content of manure and emissions
from producing and transporting the concentrates (Phetteplace
et al., 2001; Lovett et al., 2006). Other practices that can reduce
CH
4emissions include: adding certain oils or oilseeds to the diet
(e.g., Machmüller et al., 2000; Jordan et al., 2006); improving
pasture quality
, especially in less developed regions, because this
improves animal productivity, and reduces the proportion ofenergy lost as CH
4(Leng, 1991; McCrabb et al., 1998; Alcock
and Hegarty
, 2006); and optimising protein intake to reduce N
excretion and N 2O emissions (Clark et al., 2005).
Specific agents and dietary additives: A wide range of specific
agents, mostly aimed at suppr
essing methanogenesis, has
been proposed as dietary additives to r educe CH 4emissions.
They include vaccines (Wright et al., 2004), probiotics(McGinn et al., 2004), halogenated compounds (Wolin et al.,
1964; V 
an Nevel and Demeyer, 1995), ionophores (Benz and
Johnson, 1982; Van Nevel and Demeyer, 1996; McGinn et al.,
2004), and others. Some of them ar
e still under development
and their indirect effects for health and the environment are
not certain (Steinfeld et al., 2006).
Longer-term management changes and animal breeding:
Increasing productivity through breeding and bettermanagement practices, such as a reduction in the number of
r
eplacement heifers, often reduces methane output per unit of
animal product (Boadi et al., 2004). Although selecting cattle
dir
ectly for reduced methane production has been proposed
(Kebreab et al., 2006), it is still impractical due to difficulties in 

accurately measuring methane emissions at a magnitude
suitable for breeding programmes. With improved efficiency,meat-producing animals reach slaughter weight at a youngerage, with reduced lifetime emissions (Lovett and O’Mara, 2002).However, the whole-system effects of such practices may notalways lead to reduced emissions. For example in dairy cattle,
intensive selection for higher yield may reduce fertility, requiring
more replacement heifers in the herd (Lovett et al., 2006).
Manure management
Animal manures can release significant amounts of N
2O and
CH 4during storage, but the magnitude of these emissions
varies. Methane emissions from manure stored in lagoons or
tanks can be reduced by cooling, use of solid covers,mechanically separating solids from slurry, or by capturing theCH
4emitted (Amon et al., 2006; Clemens and Ahlgrimm, 2001;
Monteny et al., 2001, 2006; Paustian et al., 2004). Themanur 
es can also be digested anaerobically to maximise CH 4
retrieval as a renewable energy source (Clemens andAhlgrimm, 2001; Clemens et al., 2006). Handling manur es in
solid form (e.g., composting) rather than liquid form cansuppr 
ess CH 4emissions, but may increase N 2O formation
(Paustian et al., 2004). Preliminary evidence suggests that
covering manur
e heaps can reduce N 2O emissions, but the
effect of this practice on CH 4emissions is variable (Chadwick,
2005). For most animals worldwide there is limited opportunity
for manure management, treatment, or storage; excretionhappens in the field and handling for fuel or fertility amendmentoccurs when it is dry and methane emissions are negligible(Gonzalez-Avalos and Ruiz-Suarez, 2001). To some extent,emissions from manure might be curtailed by altering feedingpractices (Külling et al., 2003; Hindrichsen et al., 2006; Kreuzer
and Hindrichsen, 2006), or by composting the manur
e (Pattey
et al., 2005; Amon et al., 2001), but if aeration is inadequate
CH 4emissions during composting can still be substantial (Xu et
al., 2007). All of these practices require further study from the
perspective of their impact on whole life-cycle GHG emissions.
In comparison with managing cr
oplands and grassland as
carbon sinks, the direct potential carbon mitigation by
livestock management is relatively small (only 10% rather than89%). However, livestock require feed and as such have anindirect effect on cropland and grassland management.6.1.4 Other mitigation possibilities and
implications for sustainable development.
There are several other mitigation potentials that have not been
covered by the previous points and will be discussed here.
Rice management 
Cultivated wetland rice soils emit significant quantities of
methane (Y
an et al., 2003). Emissions during the growing season
can be reduced by various practices (Y
agi et al., 1997;
W
assmann et al., 2000; Aulakh et al., 2001). For example,
draining wetland rice once or several times during the gr
owing
season reduces CH 4emissions (Smith and Conen, 2004; Yan et
al., 2003; Khalil and Shearer, 2006). This benefit, however , may
be partly offset by increased N 2O emissions (Akiyama et al.,
2005), and the practice may be constrained by water supply .
Rice cultivars with low exudation rates could of
fer an important
methane mitigation option (Aulakh et al., 2001). In the off-rice
season, methane emissions can be reduced by improved water
management, especially by keeping the soil as dry as possible
and avoiding water
-logging (Cai et al., 2000, 2003; Kang et al.,
2002; Xu et al., 2003). Increasing rice productivity can alsoenhance soil organic carbon stocks (Pan et al., 2006). Methane
emissions can be r 
educed by adjusting the timing of organic
residue additions (e.g., incorporating organic materials in the dry
period rather than in flooded periods; Xu et al., 2000; Cai and
Xu, 2004), by composting the residues before incorporation, or
by producing biogas for use as fuel for energy production (Wang
and Shangguan, 1996; W
assmann et al., 2000).
The system of rice intensification (SRI) was developed in
Madagascar to help farmers increase rice production without
extra inputs (Stoop and Kassam, 2006). The cultivation system
involves gr
owing the rice plants widely spaced without flooding
and with only organic amendments as fertilisers. There areanecdotal reports of high yield using the system (Uphoff, 2004).
However, the merits of the system remain controversial (Sinclair ,
2004). No investigation of the GHG emission from the system
are known to us, but based on general knowledge about thepractices that promote and reduce emissions we predict that
methane emissions will be greatly reduced, as it is not flooded.
Some nitrous oxide emissions are expected, but they may not
be large as mineral nitrogen is not added. Organic amendments
may increase nitrous oxide emissions, but this is not always

gas emissions from agriculture

observed (Wassmann et al., 2004). The most important point
may be the downstr
eam effects. Sinclair (2004) notes that large
quantities of organic fertilisers are needed to maintain high yields.It is important from the point of view of a total GHG balance,where and how this organic material is grown.
Management of organic/peaty soils
Organic or peaty soils contain high densities of carbon
accumulated over many centuries because decomposition issuppr
essed by absence of oxygen under flooded conditions. To
be used for agriculture, these soils are drained, which aerates thesoil, favouring decomposition, and therefore high CO
2and N 2O
fluxes. Methane emissions are usually suppressed after draining,but this effect is far outweighed by pronounced incr eases in N
2O
and CO 2(Kasimir-Klemedtsson et al., 1997). Emissions fr om
drained organic soils can be r
educed to some extent by practices
such as avoiding row crops and tubers, avoiding deep ploughing,and maintaining a shallower water table. But the most important
mitigation practice is avoiding the drainage of these soils in the first
place or re-establishing a high water table (Freibauer et al., 2004).
Restoration of degraded lands
A large proportion of agricultural lands has been degraded by
excessive disturbance, er
osion, organic matter loss, salinisation,
acidification, or other processes that curtail productivity (Batjes,1999; Foley et al., 2005; Lal, 2001a, 2003, 2004b). Often,carbon storage in these soils can be partly r
estored by practices
that reclaim productivity including: re-vegetation (e.g., plantinggrasses); improving fertility by nutrient amendments; applyingorganic substrates such as manures, biosolids, and composts;reducing tillage and retaining crop residues; and conservingwater (Lal, 2001b; 2004b; Bruce et al., 1999; Olsson and Ardö,
2002; Paustian et al., 2004). Where these practices involve
higher nitrogen amendments, the benefits of carbonsequestration may be partly of
fset by higher N 2O emissions.6.2 Mitigation potential from fertiliser
management, especially from improvedefficiency and reduced over-use of fertilisers 
The addition of fertiliser increases crop productivity but may also
increase nitrous oxide emissions. Therefore, crop fertilisationcan be positive or negative in regard to the total GHG budget.
The effect of increased productivity has been discussed
earlier and as such the addition of fertiliser will have the 
same mitigation potential if the cropland is nutrient deficient(Schnabel et al., 2001; Conant et al., 2001). As such, fertiliser
additions will have a beneficial ef
fect in extremely nutrient
deficient regions like large parts of Africa (Sanchez, 2002).
However, the use of fertiliser will equally generate more GHGemissions during production (CO
2) (Schlesinger, 1999; Pérez-
Ramírez et al., 2003; Robertson, 2004; Gregorich et al.,
2005), and often after application (N 2O) (Conant et al., 2005)
ther
eby offsetting some of the benefits. 
The reduction of the reliance on fertilisers by adopting
cropping systems that maintain high yields has a high
mitigation potential (Paustian et al., 2004). An importantexample is the use of r 
otations with legume crops (West 
and Post, 2002; Izaurralde et al., 2001). This reduces ther 
equirement of external N inputs although legume-derived N
can also be a source of N 2O (Rochette and Janzen, 2005).
This approach is usually acquired by organic practices.
Nitrogen applied in fertilisers (but also other input such as
manur es) is not always used efficiently by crops (Galloway et
al., 2003; Cassman et al., 2003). The surplus N is particularlysusceptible to emission of N
2O (McSwiney and Robertson,
2005). Consequently, improving N use efficiency can reduceN
2O emissions and indirectly reduce GHG emissions from N
fertiliser manufacture (Schlesinger, 1999). By reducing leachingand volatile losses, improved efficiency of N use can also
reduce off-site N
2O emissions. Practices that improve N use
efficiency include: adjusting application rates based on precise
estimation of crop needs (e.g., precision farming); using slow-or controlled-release fertiliser forms or nitrification inhibitors
(which slow the microbial processes leading to N
2O formation);
applying N when least susceptible to loss, often just prior to

plant uptake (improved timing); placing the N more precisely
into the soil to make it more accessible to crops’ roots; oravoiding N applications in excess of immediate plantrequirements (Robertson, 2004; Dalal et al., 2003; Paustian et
al., 2004; Cole et al., 1997; Monteny et al., 2006).
Generally 
, fertiliser production has a potential to reduce its
global GHG emissions by more than half from 0.283 to 0.119
Pg CO 2-eq yr-1. Improvements would be related to greater
energy efficiency in ammonia plants (29%), introduction ofnew nitrous oxide reduction technology (32%) and othergeneral energy-saving measures in plants (39%) (Kongshaug,
1998).
6.3 Changing diet and consumption
patterns – impact of consuming less meat
A vegetarian diet produces much less GHG over a lifetime.
The average consumption of grain and forage for productionof one kg of animal products in Table 10 shows that
producing lamb and beef requires between four and ten times
more grain than producing pigs or chicken (see details Table
10). For ruminants, methane production further increasesGHG emissions per unit of food. Therefore, the consumption
of less meat will save GHG, and so will consuming poultry
instead of beef or lamb (Table 10). The average amount of
kcal fossil energy used per kcal of meat produced is 25. This
is more than 11 times that of plant-based products, with anaverage input/output ratio of 2.2 (Pimentel and Pimentel,2003). Using numbers from Pimentel and Pimentel (2003) wecalculated that 385 kcal of fossil fuel per person per daycould be saved by substituting just 5% of the meat in the dietwith vegetarian products, assuming an average US diet asbaseline. Considering that fossil fuels emit different amountsof CO
2per kcal (Sims et al., 2006), this amounts to between
95 and 126 g of CO 2.
Foster et al., (2006) calculate that the energy needed to
pr
oduce one kg of sheep meat is 23 MJ, one kg of poultry 
is 12 MJ and one kg of potatoes is 1.3 MJ in the UK. Whilstboth a plant-based and a meat-based diet in developedcountries require significant quantities of non-renewable fossilfuel, a meat based diet requires more (Pimentel and Pimentel,2003) (T able 11). If developing countries were to eat as muchmeat as developed countries per capita, the amount ofagricultural land required world wide would be about twothirds larger than today (Jackson et al., 2005). For individuals
wishing to r
educe their GHG footprint, adopting a vegetarian
diet, or at least reducing the quantity of meat products in thediet, would have beneficial GHG impacts.
