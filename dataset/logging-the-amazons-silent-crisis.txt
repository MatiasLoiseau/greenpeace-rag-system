3The Amazon’s Silent CrisisThe Amazon rainforest is the world’s largest 
tract of intact forest and is home to over 
24 million people in Brazil alone,1 including 
hundreds of thousands of indigenous people.2 
The forest is essential to their survival, 
providing food, shelter and medicines, as 
well as playing an important role in their 
spiritual life of many. It is also the habitat of 
an estimated quarter of all known land or 
freshwater species, including the jaguar, the 
pink river dolphin and several species of sloth. 
In fact, the Amazon Basin is one of the richest 
places on the planet with regard to ﬂora and 
fauna. It supports approximately 40,000 
plant species, 427 mammals, 1,294 birds, 378 reptiles, 426 amphibians and some 3,000 
species of ﬁsh.3
The Amazon Basin covers an area of 
approximately 6.5 million km² in nine South 
American countries, making up 5% of the Earth’s 
surface. It is home to the largest river system 
on the planet, containing about one-ﬁfth of the 
world’s total volume of fresh water.4 Some 63% 
of the Amazon Basin (4.1 million km²) is inside 
Brazil’s borders. To date some 700,000km2 of 
Brazil’s Amazon forest has been deforested – 
equivalent to more than twice the area of Poland.5 
Some 18% of the Brazilian Amazon forest has 
been lost within the past three decades.6

4The Amazon’s Silent CrisisThe Amazon  
and the climate
 
As well as its incredible biological richness, the Amazon 
plays an essential role in helping to control the entire 
planet’s atmospheric carbon levels. Its trees take up huge 
amounts of carbon dioxide from the air, helping to offset 
greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity. 
The Amazon Basin is a vast carbon store, containing 
approximately 100 billion tonnes of carbon7 – over 10 
times the global annual emissions from fossil fuel.8 
However, deforestation not only reduces the amount of 
carbon the forest can store, but also leads to emissions 
of greenhouse gases as cleared vegetation decays 
or is burnt to prepare the land for agriculture. It also 
leaves the remaining forest fragmented and vulnerable 
to further deforestation, commercial exploitation, 
invasive species and the impacts of climate change, 
such as drought-induced ﬁre. The more vulnerable a 
forest is to climate change, the greater the danger of its 
remaining carbon stocks being lost to the atmosphere. 
Deforestation therefore increases the risk of runaway 
climate change. 
As climate change impacts are felt, there are concerns 
that the Amazon forest may reach a ‘tipping point’ 
in which it undergoes a rapid transition to savannah. 
The 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
assessment9 reported that the probability of reaching 
this tipping point was increased by the combination 
of climate change and fragmentation acting together. 
Such a dramatic change would in turn lead to disastrous 
losses both of biodiversity and of vital ecosystem 
services currently provided by the forest, such as 
provision of clean water and climate regulation.
Predatory logging for high-
value species degrades 
intact forest and opens it 
up to wholesale clearance 
for ranching and  cash crop 
agriculture.

Selective logging and 
fragmentation
Besides actual deforestation (clear-felling), selective 
logging is an important agent of forest fragmentation and 
degradation of the forest’s ecological integrity. It is well 
documented that the selective logging of mahogany trees 
in intact primary Amazonian forest was a key driver of the 
fragmentation process until trade was strictly controlled 
in 2003 by the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), 
which has substantially reduced the scale of the problem.10 
Mahogany logging was the ﬁrst step in a forest colonisation 
process involving slash-and-burn agriculture. Colonists 
advanced along roads built by logging companies, 
deforesting areas alongside the roads and converting 
them to arable land and cattle ranches which broke up the 
continuity of the forest.11 
Even though the trade in mahogany has been curbed, 
selective logging remains a massive problem in the 
Amazon, with similar consequences. If left unchecked, 
forest fragmentation will ultimately lead to the 
disappearance of whole tracts of forest. One of the main 
drivers of fragmentation today is the demand for high-
value species such as Ipê.12


5The Amazon’s Silent CrisisIpê – the new mahogany
The group of species known as Ipê ( Handroanthus spp .13) have 
been described as the ‘new mahogany’. Just like mahogany, 
they are highly prized, sought-after timber trees, and loggers 
are willing to go deep into intact primary forest in search 
of them.14 Ipê species form large canopy trees that display 
brilliant pink, yellow or white ﬂowers in August and September 
– distinguishing them from the rest of the canopy at that time. 
They yield a valuable timber, known for its durability, strength 
and natural resistance to decay. Ipê growing in the Amazon 
has a low population density, with an average of one tree per 
10 hectares.15 This means that large areas of forest need to be 
opened up to access these valuable trees.  
Ironically, Ipê is best known as a tree planted in many Brazilian 
cities. Ipê is an integral part of Brazilian indigenous history, with 
various species being used by indigenous peoples for their 
hunting bows. Ipê bark is widely reputed to have medicinal 
properties, and is used by the traditional and herbal medicine 
industries as a remedy for cancer, ulcers, arthritis and fungal 
infections, among others.16 
Ipê wood (also referred to as Brazilian Walnut or Lapacho) is 
now the construction industry’s top choice for commercial and 
residential decking, and is often portrayed as a green option 
as it does not require weatherprooﬁng or pesticidal treatment with toxic chemicals. In the DIY market, Ipê is sold as decking 
and ﬂooring. In the United States, Ipê has been used for many 
piers, boardwalks and bridges in New Jersey, California, 
New York (including the Brooklyn Bridge) and elsewhere. In 
Europe Ipê has been used for decking at iconic sites including 
the World Trade Centre in Geneva, the Antwerp Law Courts 
in Belgium and the National Library in Paris (Bibliothèque 
François Mitterrand). In Europe Ipê has been used for decking 
at iconic sites including Geneva’s World Trade Centre, the 
Antwerp Law Courts (Gerechtsgebouw Antwerpen) and Paris’ 
National Library (Bibliothèque François Mitterrand). In Brazil, 
Ipê timber is found in many cities, and was recently used for 
ﬂooring in the library of the Presidential Palace.
Even leaving aside the impact of illegal logging, Ipê species 
are at risk of serious over-harvesting. Logging companies are 
permitted to fell 90% of commercial-sized adults, with a second 
cut permitted after 35 years. However, it has been estimated 
that after an initial 90% felling it would take at least 60 years 
for commercial volumes of one species ( H. impetiginosus ) to 
recover to pre-harvest levels.17
Ipê is the most valuable Brazilian tropical timber, and among 
the most expensive globally. While the volumes of Ipê 
harvested and exported have declined in recent years, the 
price continues to increase – driving loggers ever deeper into 
the forest in search of it.Ipê, also known as Brazilian Walnut or 
Lapacho, is the most valuable Brazilian 
tropical timber, and among the most 
expensive globally. By the time it is 
exported as decking boards, it is worth 13 
times its value as newly felled timber.

6The Amazon’s Silent CrisisTimber from the  
Brazilian Amazon
Under pressure from vested interests, the Brazilian government 
has recently relaxed rules on deforestation and has limited the 
capacity of the federal environmental agencies that enforce those 
rules. Accordingly, while annual deforestation rates in the Brazilian 
Amazon had fallen in recent years, between August 2012 and July 
2013 deforestation actually increased by 28% compared with the 
previous year.20  
The states with the largest increase in deforestation by area, 
Mato Grosso and Pará, also have the highest levels of illegal 
logging. Pará state is the largest timber producer and exporter in the Brazilian Amazon,21 yet between August 2011 and July 
2012 an estimated 78% of logging (by area) in the state was 
illegal.22 Similar analysis of Mato Grosso, the second-largest 
producer and exporter,23 shows that over the same period 
54% of the total logged area was logged illegally.24
This illegal logging is fuelled by a lack of governance in public 
areas, indigenous lands and other protected and community 
lands; a lack of inspection and enforcement capacity on the 
part of local authorities; high demand for timber, including 
high-value species; and illegal deforestation for agriculture 
(with illegal timber as a by-product). 
Governance of the timber sector in the Brazilian Amazon is 
weak and open to exploitation. Studies have demonstrated 
vast discrepancies between volumes of timber harvested and 
the quantities actually authorised. The national system for 
approval of forest management plans is structurally ﬂawed, as 
is the chain-of-custody system, leading to systemic crime in the 
logging sector. Large amounts of illegal timber enter national 
and international timber markets after being laundered using 
genuine documents obtained by fraudulent means (see The 5 
ways to launder illegal timber, p11).  
According to the Brazilian Institute of Environment and 
Renewable Natural Resources (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio 
Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis  – IBAMA), the 
federal environmental agency responsible (alongside state 
environmental secretariats) for monitoring and inspecting 
the Amazon timber industry, in Maranhão and Pará states 
alone almost 500,000m³ of timber had fraudulent documents 
in 2013 – enough to ﬁll 14,000 trucks.25 Given the magnitude 
of the fraud and corruption, there is no question that ofﬁcial 
documents issued in Brazil to certify the legality of timber 
are largely unreliable and cannot alone be considered as 
evidence of legality.

is necessary
The timber industry in the Brazilian Amazon is currently a key 
driver of forest degradation and a catalyst for deforestation. 
Logging, particularly for valuable timber species including 
Ipê, is the ﬁrst phase in the deforestation cycle, drives 
colonisation of once remote intact forest areas, and is a 
major source of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to 
environmental damage and biodiversity loss, it also leads to 
social conﬂict when timber is taken from public or indigenous 
lands and other conservation areas without community 
knowledge or in deﬁance of community wishes. Furthermore, 
illegal logging is characterised by appalling working 
conditions, often using slave labour, and is accompanied by 
violence, death threats and sometimes even assassinations 
of those who oppose it.A different way of approaching the forest and those whose 
livelihoods depend on forest products is not only possible, but 
absolutely necessary. Investment and capacity building need to 
be focused on giving communities the skills to undertake quality 
community forest management. The Brazilian government 
must strengthen the regulation of timber harvesting, and the 
enforcement of regulations. Surveillance, monitoring and 
enforcement systems should be transparent and able to 
operate in real time so that communities, civil society and other 
stakeholders can be sure that those harvesting timber are 
complying with rigorous government regulations. Such changes 
will give those purchasing Amazon timber greater reassurance 
that it is not linked to forest destruction and social conﬂict. 
Protecting the Amazon and creating a sustainable and fair 
development plan for the region could generate opportunities for 
forest-dependent peoples, at the same time as preserving the 
region’s rich biodiversity and safeguarding its important role in 
the ﬁght against climate change.

The Amazon’s Silent Crisis
LOGGING  
REGULATION  
AND 5 WAYS  
TO LAUNDER
The timber-producing states of Pará and Mato Grosso, 
responsible for 75% of the sawn wood production in the 
Amazon, have a duel system of timber industry governance.1 
This consists of a regulatory system overseeing the 
management of estates and harvesting of timber, and a 
chain-of-custody system intended to ensure traceability of 
timber from forest to end user. Both are open to a range of 
abuses by those who aim to proﬁt from illegal logging, as a 
result of which 78% and 54% of the land exploited for timber 
in Pará and Mato Grosso respectively was logged illegally 
during 2011–12.2
In 2006, new forestry legislation passed much of the 
responsibility for logging industry regulation from the Brazilian 
Federal Government (Ministry of Environment) to state 
governments (usually the State Environmental Secretariat 
(Secretaria Estadual de Meio Ambiente  – SEMA)).  
Overnight, the analysis, approval, monitoring and evaluation 
of Sustainable Forest Management Plans ( Planos de Manejo 
Florestal Sustentável  – PMFS) became a matter for individual 
states, as well as the registration of timber consumers and 
producers and the monitoring of the chain of custody.   
Unfortunately this has increased the opportunities for forest 
fraud because of a lack of capacity at state level, as well as 
mismanagement and corruption within the SEMAs.
Although the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and 
Renewable Natural Resources ( Instituto Brasileiro do Meio 
Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis – IBAMA) 
continues to conduct inspections of logging operations 
and timber consignments independently of the SEMAs, its 
interventions are insufﬁcient to address the systemic gaps in 
enforcement that enable the trade in illegal timber to thrive.The regulation of the 
Brazilian Amazon 
logging industry

12The Amazon’s Silent Crisis
Regulation of timber  
management and harvesting 
Forest timber may be legally harvested from either private or 
public land (including Federal and state protected areas) with the 
correct authorisation. Much harvesting on public land takes place 
in areas managed by communities living in Federal settlements. 
Harvesting on private land is subject to regulations that permit 
clear-felling of up to 20% of an estate and selective logging of 
much of the remainder.
In Pará and Mato Grosso, the oversight of timber harvesting 
is exercised by the SEMA through the Integrated System for 
Environmental Monitoring and Licensing ( Sistema Integrado 
de Monitoramento e Licenciamento Ambiental  – SIMLAM), 
a computerised system by means of which estates are 
registered and monitored, and licences issued for their 
activities, including logging. The PMFS approval process is 
conducted via SIMLAM. 
A PMFS is obligatory for landowners who wish to harvest 
timber beyond the 20% of an estate that is allowed to be 
completely deforested. It is typically drawn up for the SEMA’s 
approval by an independent forest engineer contracted by 
the landowner or the company that is to carry out logging on 
the landowner’s behalf, and once approved is valid for up to 
ﬁve years. It speciﬁes an Area of Forest Management ( Área 
de Manejo Florestal  – AMF) within the property, which may 
amount to as much as 80%, or more if the owner agrees not to 
clear-cut the 20% to which he or she is entitled. 
The AMF may be subdivided into Annual Production Units 
(Unidades de Produção Annual  – UPA), depending on the 
landowner or operator’s capacity to harvest the area over the 
space of one year. Any environmentally sensitive Permanent 
Preservation Areas ( Áreas de Preservação Permanente  – APP) 
within each UPA must be excluded from logging – the remaining 
area to be logged is termed the  
  
 
 
 
Forest Management Unit ( Unidade de  Manejo Florestal   –  
UMF). Each UPA is in turn divided into Work Units ( Unidades 
de Trabalho  – UT), by which the locations of individual trees are 
identiﬁed. 
To harvest timber, the landowner/operator must have a Logging 
Authorisation ( Autorização de Exploração Florestal  – AUTEF), 
issued by the SEMA via SIMLAM and valid for one year, with 
renewal possible for another year. This document generates 
credits for timber transactions within the Sisﬂora chain of custody 
system (see below). There must be an AUTEF associated with all 
timber sold or transported.
For each UPA, the person or company responsible for the 
management plan must present an Annual Operation Plan ( Plano 
Operacional Anual  – POA), including a forest inventory specifying 
what will be harvested over that year (number of trees, their 
location and species, and the estimated cubic metres of timber 
in each tree).3 If it approves the POA, the SEMA issues an AUTEF. 
In the Amazon, harvesting is currently limited to 30m3 of timber 
(equivalent to two to ﬁve trees, depending on species and size) 
per hectare every 35 years. 
Illegal harvesting of timber
In spite of this regulatory system, however, the Amazon is awash 
with illegal timber. Timber may be illegal because it comes 
from land on a private estate that has been clear-felled without 
a deforestation authorisation, or logged without an AUTEF; 
because it has been harvested in excess of the maximum 
authorised for a given area; or because it has been taken without 
permission from public land, or even from areas protected for 
wildlife or indigenous peoples and other communities. Between 
2007 and 2012, unauthorised logging in Pará  state alone covered 
717,000ha, 79% of the total logging (905,000ha).4

The Amazon’s Silent CrisisRegulation of the timber  
chain of custody
 
One of the key weapons in the ﬁght against such illegal timber 
is a chain of custody system that prevents the transport or 
sale of timber than cannot be traced to a legal origin. In Brazil, 
responsibility for the system for tracking timber from origin to 
destination is split between federal and state authorities. The 
national system, called the Forest Origin Document ( Documento 
de Origem Florestal – DOF) system, is duplicated by the System 
for the Commercialisation and Transportation of Forest Products 
(Sistema de Comercializaç ão e Transporte de Produtos Florestais  
– Sisﬂora), implemented by Mato Grosso state in 2006, and since 
adopted by Pará. Confusingly, the latter system is also based 
around a transport document known by IBAMA as a DOF, though 
more commonly referred to as a Guia Florestal  (GF). For each 
PMFS, an identity within the Forest Products Producers and 
Consumers Register ( Cadastro de Exploradores e Consumidores 
de Produtos Florestais  – CEPROF) is created on Sisﬂora (or on the 
DOF system in states that do not use Sisﬂora).
Both systems are intended to enable consignments of 
timber being transported by truck or boat to be compared 
with the declarations made by estates and sawmills. 
However, due to capacity limitations, inspection agents 
rarely check timber consignments in the ﬁeld in real time.   
 
 
 
Moreover, the Sisﬂora system does not capture data on end 
users of timber beyond the Amazon.
Timber is tracked using the credits generated by the issue of an 
AUTEF, which are transferred from the SIMLAM system onto the 
DOF or Sisﬂora systems. Every time wood moves between two 
stages of the chain of custody, it must be accompanied by a GF. 
The GF is generated in the Sisﬂora (or DOF) system. When a GF 
is generated, the amount of wood of each species speciﬁed in it 
is deducted from the credits of the consignor, and credited to the 
recipient. A producer should not be able to sell timber for which it 
does not have credits, and a mill or exporting company should not 
handle timber that is not covered by credits. 
Laundering of illegal timber
As explained above, Amazon timber is being illegally harvested 
on a huge scale – a crisis that the Sisﬂora system is intended to 
help prevent. Unfortunately, a wide range of fraudulent activities, 
ranging from the creation of fake management plans to the 
inﬂation of the number of trees of regulated species in an area, 
enable this illegal timber to be transported and commercialised 
with apparently clean documentation.

14The Amazon’s Silent CrisisThe ﬁve ways to launder illegal timber 
Logging authorised  
in area already harvested  
or deforested
 
 
 
 
 
As a result of either negligence or collusion on the part 
of a SEMA ofﬁcial, a fraudulent PMFS is approved 
for an already harvested or deforested area that is 
incapable of supplying any timber of sufﬁcient size to 
be marketed, or indeed any timber at all. In due course 
the SEMA approves a POA and grants an AUTEF, along 
with credits that are then used to provide documentary 
support for illegal timber logged elsewhere.1Overstating of the total volume 
within a PMFS area of trees 
belonging to valuable species  
Species such as Ipê and Jatobá have high commercial 
value. However, they are also scarce, and a truthful 
forestry inventory will generally list only a small number 
of these trees per hectare. In addition, the declared total 
volume of such trees present within a UPA is estimated, 
rather than being based on exact measurements, thus 
opening the way for inﬂated volumes to be declared. 
Overstating the number and size of such trees (and 
hence the volume of timber), provided the actual 
harvesting level is kept somewhat below the 30m3/ha 
maximum permitted, generates excess credits that can 
be used to launder illegally harvested high-value timber 
from other areas.
Authorised area  
with no signs of  
timber extraction
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this case, a PMFS is created simply to generate 
credits and documentation for the transportation 
of illegally harvested timber from other areas – no 
harvesting takes place within the licensed area.2
3Credits issued for more  
timber than the AUTEF 
authorises to be harvested 
 
 
This involves inﬂation of the number of credits 
associated with an AUTEF on the Sisﬂora system. 
This fraud depends upon the cooperation of an ofﬁcer 
at the SEMA, since the credits are entered onto the 
system manually. In Pará, for example, the SIMLAM 
and Sisﬂora systems are not interconnected. SEMA 
employees therefore have to enter the credits generated 
by each AUTEF manually onto Sisﬂora – a process that 
lends itself to fraud. Once again, the fraud generates 
excess credits that can be used to launder illegal timber.
Credits issued  
without an  
AUTEF or PMFS 
This is the most ﬂagrant fraud of them all. This is because, like the previous example, it depends on the direct involvement of 
a SEMA ofﬁcer responsible for entering credits onto the system. However, in this case the credits entered onto Sisﬂora are 
not merely excessive in terms of an AUTEF that has been granted, but have no supporting AUTEF or PMFS at all. Instead 
they depend on the ofﬁcer generating a fake forestry identity (CEPROF), usually registered in the name of a company or an 
individual (not a PMFS). By this means fake credits are issued directly to a non-existent sawmill. Once again, the only reason 
to fabricate such credits is to launder illegal timber.4

16The Amazon’s Silent CrisisA pioneering  
project
 
 
The Virola-Jatobá Sustainable Development Project (PDS) 
was created in 20021 out of an earlier government-sponsored 
agricultural settlement project. Its land is located near the 
city of Anapu, 25km from the Trans-Amazonian Highway. 
Together with the Esperança PDS, it was the ﬁrst such project 
in Pará,2 the result of the activist nun Sister Dorothy Stang’s3 
work to develop a new model of settlement intended to 
ensure settlers a secure additional source of income based 
on managed harvesting of timber, without destroying the 
forest. Land conﬂicts between the settlers and loggers led to 
Sister Dorothy’s murder in 2005, inside the Esperança PDS. 
According to the Brazilian National Institute for Colonisation 
and Land Reform (INCRA), 236 families live on the Virola-
Jatobá PDS’s land.4 Some of them make up the Associação 
Virola-Jatobá (AVJ), a community association set up to carry 
out forestry activities via a Sustainable Forest Management 
Plan (PMFS) on the bulk of the   
 
 
 
 
 
PDS land (principally the Legal Reserve – the 80% of the 
estate that is not permitted to be cleared for agriculture).
It was only in 2007 that AVJ received approval for its ﬁrst 
management plan, together with the logging authorisation 
(AUTEF) for its ﬁrst Annual Production Unit (UPA) out of 
15.5 In order to manage its forestry project, AVJ established 
a partnership with a private company, Vitória Régia 
Exportadora,6 whose responsibilities were to include 
implementing the management plan, producing the forest 
inventory for the next UPAs and ensuring that forestry activity 
met Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards. The 
relationship between AVJ and Vitória Régia was formalised 
through a contract validated by the Sustainable Forest 
Management Support Project in the Amazon (ProManejo – 
set up by the Institute for the Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources (IBAMA)), as well as by INCRA and the 
Federal Public Prosecutor in Pará.

The Amazon’s Silent Crisis
Social and  
environmental  
disaster
By the time Greenpeace visited the area in 2013, however, this 
model had resulted in a veritable social and environmental 
disaster. Vitória Régia Exportadora, which had been sold to 
the timber products company Arbor Native, was no longer 
operating the Virola-Jatobá FMP directly: management had 
been passed to another company, Bortolanza. Nevertheless, 
Vitória Régia remained the contract holder, and had failed to 
fulﬁl its agreements with the community to use low-impact 
management methods meeting FSC requirements and to 
provide subsidised farming implements and supplies to the 
families living within the PDS area. 
Community members who worked in the Forest Management 
Area (AMF) claimed to have discovered that online printable 
Sisﬂora forestry documents for transportation of timber (GFs) 
had been printed from a computer somewhere outside the 
Virola-Jatobá PDS area, indicating that operations were being 
concealed from the community. They also claimed that the same 
documents were used repeatedly for different truckloads of 
timber, though they are supposed to be used once only. According to community members, the company operating 
the plan had abandoned felled timber in the stockyards, 
telling the community that there was no need to cut more 
because the yards were full and because it (the company) 
was not actively pursuing sales at that time. It thereby avoided 
paying the community for their timber, while using the credits 
from the abandoned logs to launder timber from elsewhere. 
Greenpeace found a large number of logs (including some 
hollow trunks, which a competent forestry operation would 
not have felled) lying in the PDS’s stockyards and forest.
On the few logs that had identiﬁcation plates, the Greenpeace 
inspection team found that identiﬁcation consisted of only 
the number of the log and in some cases the Work Unit (UT), 
but not the UPA, in violation of the law and the traceability 
arrangements agreed between AVJ and Vitória Régia. 
In addition, the Greenpeace inspection team identiﬁed 
harvesting of inventoried trees outside the boundary of the AMF. 
The team also found many trees within the UPAs that had been 
designated for felling in the AUTEFs but had not been logged. 
Along with the abandoning of felled trees, this strongly suggests 
that AVJ’s credits were being used to launder illegal timber 
from elsewhere. We have reason to believe that signiﬁcant 
percentages of these credits have already been traded.

93% of the credits issued in respect of 
AUTEF 633/2009, and 52% of the credits 
issued in respect of AUTEF 2018/20107,  are 
known to have been used in transactions 
with four sawmills in the region (though

assumed not to have come from the AMF):

Madeball Indústria e Comércio 
Ltda has a track record of illegality. 
Between 2005 and 2008, IBAMA 
charged the company with nine 
infractions, of which seven are still 
making their way through the courts. 
The offences of which the company was accused included the sale of 
sawn timber without authorisation  
for shipping or sale, and the storage  
of timber without a licence or proof  
of origin.8 
In June 2013 a district court judge 
ordered the Madeball mill to shut down 
for 16 months, in the culmination of a 
court case instigated by IBAMA, which 
had caught the company in possession 
of 170m3 of illegal timber in 2007.9 Days 
before the June 2013 ban, Madeball had 
been ﬁned R$100,000 (US$45,000) for 
falsifying information on Sisﬂora.10 

18The Amazon’s Silent CrisisInternational customers 
for suspect timber
 
Greenpeace knows of 13 companies that have exported 
timber purchased from the four sawmills associated with 
the Virola-Jatobá PDS; between them they have exported 
to Canada, the USA, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the UK and Israel. These export 
companies include Vitória Régia Exportadora itself, which 
despite withdrawing from management of the PDS continues 
to purchase timber from two sawmills linked with it. 
Vitória Régia Exportadora is an important client of the 
Madeball mill and also exports timber from Bortolanza’s mill. 
Founded in 2001, Vitória Régia exported to 11 countries in the 
year to February 2014, including the USA, France, Germany, 
Canada, Portugal, Italy and Sweden. 
Vitória Régia emphasises sustainability in its advertising. It is  
FSC-certiﬁed, and its successful products include Ecoﬂooring,   
 
 
 
a plywood ﬂooring made partly of recycled wood.11  
In contrast to its public image, however, in April 2013  
the company was ﬁned over R$600,000.00 (US$270,000)  
for stocking and selling wood with no valid documentation.12 
Export companies that have sourced from Vitória Régia 
have sold timber to well-known retailers including Lumber 
Liquidators, A relatively young American company,  
Lumber Liquidators is featured in US TV programmes  
such as Extreme Makeover, This Old House and Dream 
Home,13 broadcast on cable TV in many countries. The 
Lumber Liquidators website reports that its ﬂooring can be 
found in the homes of Donald Trump, Angelina Jolie, Kim 
Basinger and other celebrities.14 These customers are  
probably unaware that Lumber Liquidators purchases 
Brazilian timber from companies associated with forest 
industry illegality.Virola -Jatob á’s tainted mark ets

20The Amazon’s Silent CrisisA shady past  
The Agropecuária Vitória Régia estate, located in the municipality 
of Anapu, is said in its 2009/10 logging authorisation (AUTEF) 
to belong to Agropecuária Vitória Régia, a company owned by 
Laudelino Délio Fernandes Neto,1 who has twice been charged 
with ﬁnancial offences committed in the Amazon. 
In 2002, Fernandes Neto (or Délio, as he is known) was 
charged2 with siphoning off around R$7 million3 (US$3.15 
million) from the now-defunct Superintendency for the 
Development of the Amazon (SUDAM) in 1998–99. The case 
is still going through the courts.  
Besides this corruption charge, in 20094 and 20125 Délio was 
charged by the Federal Public Ministry (MPF) in Altamira, Pará 
with environmental crimes committed via straw owners, through 
the company ACosta e Figueiredo Ltda-EPP.6  
 
 
 
The MPF asserted that Délio’s straw owners and co-defendants, 
Hugo Cirilo Fernandes, Jerônimo Plácido Barbosa and Gerson 
Rene Benvindo Figueiredo, used Authorisations for the Transport 
of Forest Products (ATPFs) to launder 1,165m3 of timber that the 
company had felled illegally in excess of the permitted harvesting 
level.7 In 2006, Fernandes e Figueiredo Ltda (the same company 
referred to by the MPF in documents relating to the court case 
as ACosta e Figueiredo Ltda-EPP) had been ﬁned R$117,000 
(US$52,000) by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and 
Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) for felling the timber in 
question.8 The case is still ongoing at the Regional Court.
In 2009, Agropecuária Vitória Régia was ﬁned over R$169 million 
(US$76 million) for supplying wood for charcoal kilns without 
going through Sisﬂora.9 This was the one of the highest ﬁnes 
issued by IBAMA between January 2009 and December 2013.

The Amazon’s Silent Crisis
Laundering illegal 
timber
In 2009, IBAMA embargoed Délio’s activities 
on the Agropecuária Vitória Régia estate,10 
after discovering irregularities in information 
submitted concerning vehicles supposedly used 
to transport timber purchased by JFQ Madeiras 
Ltda.11 The registration numbers given proved 
to belong to cars and motorcycles, which could 
not possibly have transported the timber in 
question – the aim, according to IBAMA, being 
to generate surplus transport documents (GFs) 
for the shipping of illegal timber from elsewhere 
using these vehicles’ registration numbers.12 
The case is still ongoing, and meanwhile the 
company is still legally permitted to operate. Forest  
degradation
When a Greenpeace team inspected the Agropecuária Vitória Régia 
estate in November 2013, it found a large active area of illegal gold 
prospecting near the entrance, which had caused signiﬁcant damage 
to legally protected wetlands. Also observed were evidence of illegal 
harvesting of timber within the Annual Production Unit (UPA) of logging 
authorisation (AUTEF) 671/2009 after the expiry of the AUTEF, felling 
activities within the Permanent Preservation Area (APP), and felling of 
protected tree species. At least one Brazil nut tree ( Bertholletia excelsa ) 
had been cut down, its fall damaging an area of approximately 300m2. A 
200613 Federal Decree prohibits the cutting of Brazil nut trees. Moreover, 
the species is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union 
for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)14 and appears on a list of threatened 
species compiled by the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment. 
Greenpeace’s conclusion was that the forest within the PMFS area was 
being systematically degraded. There was evidence that unauthorised 
timber harvesting was ongoing and had stopped only days before the 
inspection was made.  
A ﬁnal signiﬁcant infraction noted was the large number of logs abandoned 
along the roadside, generally from trees below the legal minimum diameter 
for harvesting. Moreover, eleven of the abandoned logs found were without 
proper identiﬁcation. 
The satellite images above show Agropecuária Vitória  
Régia SA in 2008 and 2011. Greenpeace geo-referenced 
analysis determined that there is no alteration (which 
indicates no tree extraction) within the AUTEF’s area - the 
yellow boundary - which is producing timber credits.

22The Amazon’s Silent CrisisInternational customers 
for suspect timber
 
According to Greenpeace’s investigations, 97% of the 
credits issued in the name of Agropecuária Vitória Régia 
were traded,15 though many of them were presumably used 
to launder illegal timber logged elsewhere. Timber sold 
under the credits went to eight sawmills. These mills are in 
turn known to sell timber to over 40 exporting companies 
(including the unrelated Vitória Régia Exportadora, 
p.15), which export timber to at least 11 countries: 
Germany, Belgium, Canada, Spain, the USA, France, the 
Netherlands, Israel, Italy, Portugal and the UK.Agropecuária Vitória Régi a’s tainted mark ets

24The Amazon’s Silent CrisisA history of  
illegal logging
Ceser Busnello, who was murdered in October 2012, 
according to media reports as a result of a land dispute,1 
owned two properties of 1,800ha each known as Fazenda Agro 
Santa Fé I and II in the municipality of Prainha in Pará state, and 
held approved Sustainable Forest Management Plans (PMFS) 
covering the whole of both properties. 
Fazendas Agro Santa Fé I and II were not the only properties 
associated with Busnello. In November 2011, after the Pará 
Land Institute (ITERPA) discovered a bogus land title2 in his 
name relating to the Jatobá Farm, in the municipality of Juruti 
in the west of the state, a joint ﬁeld operation was mounted 
by the State Environmental Secretariat (SEMA), the Forestry 
Development Institute (IDEFLOR), the Environmental Police and 
the Renato Chaves Centre for Scientiﬁc Investigation. A total of 
4,018m³ of illegally harvested logs were seized, and the PMFS, 
held by an individual who leased the property from Busnello, 
was suspended.3 
The forest engineer who drew up the PMFS for 
Busnello’s Fazenda Agro Santa Fé I estate, according   
 
 
 
to logging authorisation (AUTEF) 985/2010, was 
Rejane Guedes de Moura, an individual who had 
already been accused of operating illegally. As 
Greenpeace has previously reported, in December 
2006 she was arrested and charged by the Federal 
Police during an operation aimed at combating illegal 
logging and related crimes in the Prainha area. In 2012 
she was convicted.4   
She also drew up the PMFS for the Taperinha Farm (see 
case study 4, p.27), owned by the estate of Violeta Elizabeth 
Hagmann, another location highlighted by Greenpeace as the 
scene of dubious timber practices. 
The Agro Santa Fé I estate had its registration in the 
Forest Products Producers and Consumers Register 
(CEPROF) suspended by the SEMA in November 2012, 
immediately after Busnello’s death. According to the 
SEMA, the suspension was imposed after a report from 
its Juridical Department (CONJUR) found ‘irreparable 
damage to the environment’.5

The Amazon’s Silent CrisisGenerating excess credits
 
In November 2013 a Greenpeace inspection team checked a 
sample of the trees mentioned in the forest inventories for AUTEF 
985/2010 and AUTEF 2173/2012. Of 11 trees checked, only 
three were found to exist or to have existed. Furthermore, the 
formula used to estimate the overall volume of timber in Fazenda 
Agro Santa Fé I had been incorrectly applied, resulting in an 
overestimate of more than 5,500m3 (nearly 14%). This in turn 
resulted in the issuing of excess timber credits that were almost 
certainly used to launder illegal timber. Processing
 
Greenpeace’s investigation has found  that 99.8% of the credits 
generated by AUTEF 985/2010, and 70% of the credits of AUTEF 
2173/2012 were  traded.6 They were used used to sell timber to 24 
different sawmills, including Madesa Madeireira Santarém Ltda, 
a logging and timber processing and exporting company with a 
long history of illegality and non-compliance with regulations.
Madesa  
– a serial offender7
Madesa began operations in Santarém in 1987 and received 
its ﬁrst ﬁne from the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and 
Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) two years later. Between 
1990 and 2007, it was ﬁned around 25 times for shipping, storing 
and selling illegal timber, as well as attempting to prevent the 
authorities from carrying out environmental inspections.8
In September 1997 Greenpeace accompanied an inspection 
conducted by IBAMA and the National Institute for Colonisation 
and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) of two of the company’s PMF 
areas, which found that harvesting had been carried out in a 
disorganised and predatory manner.9  
In July 2001, one of the company’s management plans, 
covering around 2,500ha of federal public land, was 
terminated – but only after the company had harvested the 
area and exported all the timber. According to the Federal   
 
 
 
Public Ministry in Santarém, the company also harvested 
timber without authorisation on 7,500ha of other public land. 
The directors of the company were found guilty of illegal 
timber harvesting, but have appealed to the Regional Federal 
Court. The case is still ongoing.10
In 2006 Madesa was ﬁned for storing 2,369m³ of 
undocumented timber, and it was ﬁned again in 2007 for 
shipping 37m³ without a valid licence. In August 2006, INCRA 
caught the company illegally harvesting wood within the 
boundaries of the Renascer II Sustainable Development Project 
(PDS). Although it was on public land, the company alleged that 
40% of the area belonged to it, and continued to harvest timber 
there in 2008, as reported by Greenpeace.11 
According to IBAMA, the company is on the embargo list, with an 
embargo dated from 2008 and still current.12

26The Amazon’s Silent CrisisInternational customers 
for suspect timber
Since February 2013, mills that have purchased and processed 
timber identiﬁed with Fazendas Agro Santa Fé I and II’s credits 
are known to have resold the sawn timber to no fewer than 71 
exporting companies. These include Vitória Régia Exportadora, 
(see case study 1, p.15), and Madesa (see above), which as well 
as exporting timber from its own mills has handled timber from 
several of the other mills involved. 
Among the almost 60 countries to which companies 
associated with Fazenda Agro Santa Fé I have exported are 
Germany, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, 
Spain, the USA, France, Holland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Portugal, 
the UK, Lebanon and Turkey.

28The Amazon’s Silent CrisisA historic site  
The Taperinha estate, 50km from Santarém (Pará), is well 
known to Brazilian and international travellers, naturalists and 
researchers as a focus of scientiﬁc investigation for over three 
centuries.1 According to the Museu Emilio Goeldi in Belém, Pará, 
geologists, zoologists, botanists and archaeologists have all been 
regular visitors, and the estate is the locality from which over 150 
species of animals new to science were ﬁrst described.2 
Among the famous researchers who spent time at Taperinha was 
the American archaeologist Anna Roosevelt, who explored   
 
 
the shell middens on the estate during the 1980s.3 Her research 
was fundamental for the understanding of the pre-Columbian 
settlement of the Amazon.  
The Taperinha estate was acquired in 1917 by Godofredo 
Hagmann, a former zoologist at the Museu Goeldi.4 He managed 
the property until 1946, the year of his death.5 Taperinha passed 
to Erica Hagmann and Violeta Elizabeth Hagmann, and it is now 
owned jointly by all six of Godofredo’s grandchildren, one of 
whom is manager.6 
 The Estate of Violeta Elizabeth 
Hagmann, in the municipality 
of Santarém, is well known to 
Brazilian and international 
travellers, naturalists and 
researchers as a focus of scientific 
investigation for over three 
centuries. Despite its long and 
illustrious history, the estate has 
now become a tool of forest crime. 
A Sustainable Forest Management 
Plan (PMFS) for low-impact timber 
harvesting has been approved in 
2009, however, there is evidence 
of practices intended to produce 
surplus credits to be used for 
laundering of illegal timber.

29
The Amazon’s Silent CrisisDegradation  
and fraud
 
In spite of its long and illustrious history, however, the estate has 
now become a tool of forest crime. In 2009, a Sustainable Forest 
Management Plan (PMFS) for low-impact timber harvesting was 
approved. But a Greenpeace ﬁeld inspection of the PMFS area 
in November 2013 observed evidence of practices intended to 
produce surplus credits to be used for laundering of illegal timber.
Signiﬁcant errors were found in the forest inventory for logging 
authorisation (AUTEF) 1515/2010: nine out of eleven trees checked 
by Greenpeace had been incorrectly described there. Five trees 
listed in the inventory as Ipê were in fact Jarana ( Holopyxidium 
jarana ), a commercially less desirable species. These trees, 
marked for harvesting, had actually been left intact in the forest, 
despite the entire volume of the AUTEF having supposedly been 
used up, which should mean that they had been harvested. 
Moreover, according to Greenpeace’s calculations the total 
amount of Ipê reported in the inventory for the AUTEF was 
2,105m3. The combination of the errors noted above and the   
 
 
 
signiﬁcant volume of Ipê reported in the inventory strongly 
indicates that credits issued for Ipê are being used to 
launder timber cut illegally elsewhere. 
As Greenpeace reported in 2006,7 the forest engineer in 
charge of the PMFS application had a controversial history, 
having been arrested and charged in 2006 in connection 
with a police investigation into illegal logging in the Prainha 
area. In 2012 she was convicted.8   
The same engineer also approved the PMFS for Fazenda 
Agro Santa Fé I (see case study 3, p.23), so it is perhaps 
unsurprising that generating of excess timber credits through 
forest inventory errors was discovered on both estates.
In February 2012, after an IBAMA operation in the 
Santarém region, the Taperinha PMFS was suspended. 
The IBAMA notice of suspension stated that the PMFS 
was inactive.9
The satellite images above shows Violeta Elizabeth 
Hagmann’s Estate in 2010 and 2012. Greenpeace geo-
referenced analysis determined that there is no alteration 
(which indicates no tree extraction) within the AUTEF’s 
area, which is producing timber credits.

30The Amazon’s Silent CrisisProcessing
According to Greenpeace’s investigation, 
all the credits relating to the Taperinha 
estate’s AUTEF 1515/2010 were used to 
sell timber to the timber yard MADEVI 
Ltda.10 Located in Santarém, in the 
interior of the state of Pará, MADEVI has 
a history of environmental illegalities and 
circumventing of logging regulations.   
 
In 2007 alone, MADEVI was sanctioned 
by IBAMA at least six times for various 
infractions such as illegal logging and 
failure to verify the origin of timber. The 
resultant ﬁnes totalled over R$1 million 
(US$450,000).11 Between 2009 and 2011, 
MADEVI received ﬁve ﬁnes totalling more 
than R$26 million (US$11millon).12  
 
 
 
More recently, in 2012, the Public 
Ministry of Labour began legal action 
against the company, after the local 
forestry workers’ union13 alleged 
that it had failed to abide by a Term 
of Adjustment of Conduct signed in 
2008, which committed it to minimum 
working conditions.14

As of 2011, MADEVI sold sawn timber to at least 3 exporters, 
as identiﬁed by Greenpeace: Batista & Farias Transformação 
de Madeiras Ltda–Me, Wizi Indústria, Comércio e Exportação 
de Madeiras Ltda, and Madeireira Rancho da Cabocla Ltda. In 
addition, MADEVI also exports timber directly to various countries. 
According to Greenpeace research, since February 2013, MADEVI and the 3 exporters mentioned above have between them 
exported timber to Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the UK, Israel, and the USA.
Greenpeace has identiﬁed importers with which MADEVI has 
conducted business directly, including Vandecasteele Houtimport 
in Belgium and DLH in France and Denmark.

The Amazon’s Silent CrisisAn environmentally 
sensitive application
 
The Marituba estate is located in the municipality of Anajás 
(Pará State), in the centre of the island of Marajó at the mouth 
of the Amazon.
Tecniﬂora began the Sustainable Forest Management Plan 
(PMFS) application process in August 2011 and obtained a 
Logging Authorisation (AUTEF) in July 2012.1 The company 
was authorised to harvest some 152,000m³ of timber, on 
approximately 5,150ha of the 8,650ha estate. 
According to SEMA’s analysis of Tecniﬂora’s PMFS application, 
the estate is situated inside an Environmental Protection Area 
(APA),2 and is only 8km from the Mapuá Extractive Reserve 
(RESEX),3 created in 2005 and under federal management.  
In addition, consideration is being given4 to designating 
the area as a Conservation Unit (UC),5 while the State 
Environmental Secretariat (SEMA) is attempting to get 
the whole island of Marajó designated as a Biosphere 
Reserve by UNESCO.6 For these reasons Tecniﬂora’s PMFS 
application was referred by the SEMA to the state Protected 
Areas Directorate, which however made no objection to it.7 
Accordingly, after a technical inspection the SEMA approved 
the PMFS and issued the ﬁrst AUTEF.
The forest engineer responsible for the Tecniﬂora PMFS 
previously represented another company (Agropastoril 
Eldorado Industria e Comércio de Madeiras Ltda), accused 
by IBAMA of illegally deforesting 650ha of native vegetation.8

34The Amazon’s Silent CrisisEvidence of  
forest fraud
The Marituba estate is located in the centre of the island of 
Marajó. The island consists mainly of low-lying wetland areas9 
that ﬂood periodically, as a result of which there are only 
small quantities of commercially viable tree species (which 
occur only in drier areas). Nonetheless, the inventory included 
with AUTEF 2281/2012 for Tecniﬂora’s PMFS consists 
predominantly of species typical of drier habitats. The 
document also claims densities for species such as Ipê far 
above what would be expected on the basis of the scientiﬁc 
literature. Furthermore, forest inventories produced for the 
Brazilian Geological Agency10 show no Ipê or other dry land 
species in the region. 
When Greenpeace researchers overﬂew the management 
area in September 2013, they observed no logging activity, 
log yards, dragging tracks or even access roads for the 
transportation of logs. This indicates that the credits generated 
by this management area were used to legitimise illegal timber 
coming from elsewhere – a conclusion that was conﬁrmed by 
an ofﬁcial investigation.11
Subsequent to the issuing of the AUTEF, another technical 
inspection had been scheduled for April 2013 with the aim of 
evaluating the compliance of the harvesting activities with the 
AUTEF.12 However, the SEMA’s agriculture and forest management 
division (GEPAF) requested that the inspection be rescheduled 
due to illness, and it was then suggested that it should be 
conducted only after the start of the rainy season in July.13 
In July, an inspection mission was ﬁnally scheduled for 
September.14 This 6-month delay gave Tecniﬂora a period of 
respite during which it could continue to use its timber credits 
issued for Marituba to launder timber illegally harvested in 
other areas. After the inspection, the State Environmental 
Secretariat announced on its website15 that it had uncovered evidence of the illegal transfer of timber credits from the PMFS 
on the Marituba estate. 
According to an article published on the Brazilian G1 news 
website16 in September 2013:17 
Tecniﬂora, a company whose Forest Management Plan had 
been approved by the SEMA and which had been given a logging 
authorisation and timber credits, came under investigation when 
the inspectors from the secretariat identiﬁed signs of the irregular 
use of the credits.
... The environmental crime was conﬁrmed when the SEMA 
team went to the forest management area in the municipality 
of Anajás armed with reports produced by the secretariat’s 
monitoring department, containing an analysis over time of 
satellite images and data on the sale of credits in the System 
for Commercialization and Transportation of Forest Products 
(Sisﬂora), and conﬁrmed various irregularities in the execution of 
the management plan, the main one being that less than 5% of the 
forest had been harvested, proving that there had been no sale of 
timber but rather a sale of forest credits. 
... Regarding the analyses of the use of forest credits, the 
data from the monitoring department of the Environmental 
Secretariat showed that for the volume of 151,943.48 cubic 
metres of authorised native timber, 830 transport documents 
(GFs) were issued, of which 33 were used for consignments of 
timber that were shipped exclusively by road, which would not 
have been possible [if they had come from the Marituba estate], 
since the area is accessible only by river, with the nearest road 
being 54km away as the crow ﬂies. 
In addition, the satellite images showed untouched areas 
where logs were supposed to have been removed. Other 
cases show shipping partly by river and partly by land of 
quantities so large (for example 752.9m³) that they could not 
have been shipped in less than three days by a single truck, 
from Anajás to Moju, for example. It was evident therefore that 
the timber [from the Marituba estate] had not been physically 
sold, since besides the large volume, the time claimed for 
delivery of the timber was insufﬁcient.

The Amazon’s Silent CrisisGiven all the irregularities found, which also included the non-
existence of companies that had supposedly purchased the 
timber (in practice, only credits were purchased), the SEMA not 
only ﬁned the companies [that had purchased the credits], but 
also blocked their registration in the Forest Product Producer 
and Consumer Registration System (CEPROF).
Some of the companies who had laundered wood using 
Tecniﬂora credits subsequently went to court to reinstate 
their CEPROF registrations, since their activities had been 
brought to a complete halt. The case went to the Brazilian 
Supreme Court, where on 12 March 2014 the Minister and 
President of the Court Joaquim Barbosa refused to reinstate 
their registrations.18International customers 
for suspect timber
 
According to Greenpeace’s investigation, Tecniﬂora 
traded 99.9% of the credits generated by AUTEF 
2281/2012. The company sold timber claimed to be 
from the Marituba PMFS area to nine sawmills.19 These 
mills are known to have had dealings with no fewer 
than 40 export companies, which between them 
have shipped timber to at least 13 countries including 
Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, 
Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain the UK 
and the USA.

The Amazon’s Silent CrisisAMAZON TIMBER  
IN THE US  
MARKET AND  
THE LACEY ACT
 
 
 
The USA represents the largest export market for Brazilian 
timber.2 Exotic species are bought at a premium and tend to be 
used in high-end architecture for decking, siding (cladding), and 
ﬂooring. Major institutional buyers such as cities, universities 
and companies with large campuses also purchase massive 
quantities of Brazilian and other tropical timber for walkways and 
piers; New York City, for example, is one of the largest purchasers 
of such timber in North America.3 These institutions see some 
South American tropical hardwood varieties, Ipê in particular, as 
a long-term investment because of their durability and weather 
resistance.4 However, buyers of Amazon timber may be not only 
ﬁnancing forest destruction but also violating US law. ‘ The truth is that there are many people 
who are buying Ipê (from Brazil) which 
they think has been legally logged, but 
who may actually be getting something 
that has, for lack of a better term, been 
laundered.’ 1

38The Amazon’s Silent CrisisBuying Brazilian timber 
and breaking US law
The trading of illegal timber is banned in the USA under the Lacey 
Act.5 This law, in force since 1900, bans trade in illegal wildlife. 
In 2008 the US government amended it to include trafﬁcked 
plants as well as fauna, representing the world’s ﬁrst trade ban 
on illegal timber.6 The amended act requires buyers to ﬁle ‘Lacey 
declarations’ that specify the scientiﬁc name, value, quantity 
and country of harvest of imported timber. Most importantly, 
it bans trade in timber that was acquired in any manner that 
violated an underlying US, foreign or international law.7 Trade in 
timber acquired in violation of any underlying Brazilian law is thus 
prohibited under US law. Given the high incidence of illegality in the 
Amazon timber sector, it is very likely that many US purchases of 
Brazilian timber have been and continue to be in violation of US law.
The Lacey Act has provisions for both civil and criminal penalties 
that range in severity depending on the intent of the buyer, whether 
or not the buyer knows that the timber is illegal and whether or 
not the buyer has taken ‘due care’.8 Due care is a legal standard of 
diligence that differs according to context: high-risk origins may 
require additional scrutiny on the part of the buyer in order to ensure 
that timber is legal.9 The Act also has strict liability provisions, 
meaning that even if a buyer has taken due care to prevent the 
purchase of illegal timber, they can still be held responsible if any 
timber purchased proves to be illegal, although the penalties are not  
 
 
 
 
as severe as those for buyers who did not take due care.10 
Given the systemic ﬂaws in the Brazilian timber regulatory system, 
due care for purchases from Brazil requires an enhanced level 
of scrutiny from buyers. This should include looking beyond 
Brazilian legal documentation, which has been shown to be easily 
misappropriated. Many US vendors of Brazilian timber claim that 
they review legal documents from exporters and occasionally make 
site visits.11 However, looking at the documents in isolation does not 
address the issue of whether or not they match the timber that they 
accompany. In order to ensure that the wood purchased actually 
comes from the location claimed in the documents, buyers may 
need to invest additional resources in site visits, third-party auditing, 
or origin veriﬁcation technology such as DNA or isotope testing. 
Although third-party certiﬁcation schemes such as that run 
by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) maintain legality as a 
fundamental principle for certiﬁed operations, the US government 
recognises certiﬁcation only as an indicator of due care, not as 
stand-alone proof of legality.12 Several situations could occur that 
might result in illegal timber being traded under the FSC label, 
such as a company further up the supply chain violating laws in 
the country of origin,13 or the timber’s true origin being hidden from 
the buyer by means of misappropriated documents.

The Amazon’s Silent Crisis
Amazon under  
foot in the USA
Greenpeace’s two-year investigation into logging in the Amazon 
has found cases that demonstrate how easy it is to fool the 
regulatory system at the forest management plan level and so 
introduce unauthorised timber into the market. The ease with 
which timber can be laundered helps explain how it is possible for 
illegal logging to occur on such a large scale. 
The investigation has uncovered ﬁve cases, each relating to 
a different property, which illustrate the illegal activities of the 
Brazilian logging trade. Greenpeace was able to trace these 
properties’ sales to certain sawmills in Pará state and then to 
map out sales from those sawmills to exporters. The exporters 
identiﬁed as doing business with these tainted sawmills sell to a 
wide range of high-proﬁle importers and businesses in the USA. 
Below are given a few examples of companies that do not have 
satisfactory assurances as to where their timber is coming from, 
and that should be concerned in view of the sources from which 
they are buying. 
Lumber Liquidators, headquartered in Virginia, is the USA’s 
largest national speciality hardwood ﬂooring retailer, with over 
318 storefronts in 46 states and Canada, and over US$1 billion in 
annual net sales.14 The ﬁrm positions itself as a competitive source 
of bargain ﬂooring.15 Unlike its competitors Lowe’s16 and Home 
Depot,17 it still sells large quantities of tropical timber species 
and does not have a public endangered forest policy. Lumber 
Liquidators claims that it sources from ‘managed forests’, but this 
claim is not backed by any meaningful minimum standards.18  
 
 
 
The company was the subject of a recent report by the NGO 
Environmental Investigation Agency which found that it sourced 
solid wood ﬂooring from a factory that admitted it regularly 
dealt with illegal timber from the Russian Far East.19 This report 
coincided with a raid on the company’s headquarters by US 
Federal agents, and the company is still under investigation for 
violations of the Lacey Act.20 
Lumber Liquidators’ website admits that the ﬁrm still does 
not ‘engage third party auditors or veriﬁers’ to monitor its 
supply chain.21 Lumber Liquidators is actively trying to 
increase the market for Brazilian wood products in the USA. 
The company recently petitioned the US government to 
redesignate imports of Brazilian timber products as duty-free; 
it claimed that as a company it refuses products it suspects 
to be illegal and that the Brazilian government has ‘made 
signiﬁcant efforts to eradicate illegal logging and to protect 
the sustainability of its forestry’.22
On Lumber Liquidators’ store shelves, exotic solid wood 
ﬂooring commands the highest prices. Species for sale include 
Ipê, Jatoba, Massaranduba and Cumaru.23 Lumber Liquidators 
buys solid wood ﬂooring from the Amazon from suppliers 
Exportadora De Madeiras Amazonica Ltda. (‘Exmam’), 
Juruá Florestal Ltda (‘Juruá’) and Pampa Exportações Ltda. 
(‘Pampa’).24 These three exporters have all purchased Ipê from 
the sawmills Itapuranga Indústria E Comércio De Madeiras 
Ltda. (‘Itapuranga’) and Madeball Industria E Comércio Ltda. 
Lumber Liquidators store in Rockville, Maryland, USA.

40The Amazon’s Silent Crisis(‘Madeball’),25 both of which have purchased Ipê since the 
beginning of 2013 from the Associação Virola-Jatobá (see  
Case Study 1, p.15) or the companies that manage its forest. 
Juruá has bought from Madeireira Alto Giro Belem Ltda (‘Alto 
Giro’), which sourced timber said to be from one of Ceser 
Busnello’s estates (see Case Study 3, p.23).
Exmam is located outside Belém, Pará but is owned by an 
American holding company, Paciﬁc States Industries, Inc.26 Also 
part of the same group is Redwood Empire, a Northern California 
timber company that sells Exmam’s products.27
Lumber Liquidators supplier Pampa has purchased timber from 
sawmill Vargas E Vargas Ltda, which has in turn also sourced 
timber claimed to have come from one of Busnello’s estates. 
Pampa has a history of environmental violations and has been 
ﬁned over $2.5 million (US$1 million) in recent years.28
International Forest Products, headquartered in Massachusetts, 
is a major timber importer owned by the Kraft Group – a 
sports, real estate and manufacturing group29 that also owns a 
major professional American football team, the New England 
Patriots.30 International Forest Products purchases Ipê from 
Monção e Souza Ltda (‘Monção’), Ipêzai Comercio De Madeiras 
Ltda (‘Ipêzai’) and K.M. Comercio E Exportação De Madeiras Ltda (‘K.M. Comercio’).31 Monção and Ipêzai have purchased 
Ipê from the sawmill Xingu Indústria E Comercio Imp. E Exp. 
De Madeiras Ltda (‘Xingu’), which has also sourced timber 
supposedly from one of Ceser Busnello’s estates, as has the 
sawmill Alto Giro, from which Ipêzai has also purchased. K.M. 
Comercio has bought Ipê from Madeireira Vitória Indústria e 
Comércio Ltda, a sawmill that has processed timber purchased 
from Agropecuária Vitória Régia Ltda (see Case Study 2, p.19).32 
Timber Holdings USA sells Ipê as ‘Iron Wood’ on account of 
its durability.33 Wisconsin-based Timber Holdings imports its 
Ipê from sources such as K.M. Comercio, Madeireira Rancho 
Da Cabocla Ltda. (‘Rancho Da Cabocla’), Vitoria Exportacao 
De Madeiras Ltda. (‘Vimex’) and Ipêzai. The exporter Rancho 
Da Cabocla has bought timber from MADEVI, the only sawmill 
known to have processed wood purchased from the estate 
of Violeta Elizabeth Hagmann (see Case Study 4, p.27).34 The 
exporter Vimex buys timber from the sawmill WR Indústria E 
Comercio De Madeiras Ltda, which has purchased timber from 
Agropecuária Vitória Régia Ltda.35 Timber Holdings claims to 
have supplied high-proﬁle construction projects including the 
new United States Census Bureau headquarters, rooftop decks 
and benches at Harvard University, Treasure Island Casino 
in Las Vegas, the Miami Beach Boardwalk, Disney World and 
several projects in New York City.36

destruction
 
Many of the purveyors of tropical timber in the USA 
bombard customers with specious statements that 
greenwash the product. A typical marketing ploy entails 
presenting a false choice to consumers: ‘If we do not 
“manage” this forest, it will lose its value and be converted 
into agriculture.’ One company even claims that by buying 
tropical timber, customers are ‘helping save the rainforest’.42 
Such claims ignore the well-documented role that logging 
plays in degrading tropical forests and making them more 
vulnerable to ﬁre and wholesale conversion for agriculture.43 
Several sellers also prominently display the FSC chain-of-
custody certiﬁcation logo on their websites and marketing 
materials, even though a substantial portion of the products 
they sell are not FSC-certiﬁed.44 The issue of the legality of 
the products is addressed in many marketing materials, but 
very few traders offer any assurances beyond the fact that 
their timber comes with ofﬁcial documents.Scratching  
the surface
 
There are many other US importers that buy from exporting

Busnello respectively.41

42The Amazon’s Silent CrisisAMAZON TIMBER 
IN THE EU MARKET 
AND THE EUTR
Europe is a key market for tropical timber exports 
from the Brazilian Amazon, with one-third of all 
timber exported from the region going to EU 
countries. In 2013, EU countries imported tropical 
timber products worth US$148 million from the 
Brazilian Amazon.1 Almost half of all timber imported 
from the Brazilian Amazon into the EU during this 
period came from the state of Pará, half of whose 
timber exports went to the EU.2 Nearly 80% of the 
area logged in Pará between August 2011 and July 
2012 was harvested illegally.3
Companies within the EU are bound by the EU Timber 
Regulation (EUTR),4 which prohibits the placing on the 
market of illegally harvested timber. Yet Greenpeace’s 
investigations have discovered that a number of 
companies in the EU have recently bought and 
imported timber from high-risk export companies in Brazil – companies that have handled wood from 
sawmills that have processed (either knowingly or 
through wilful negligence) illegal timber laundered by 
misusing ofﬁcial documentation. 
France is the world’s second-largest importer of 
tropical timber from the Brazilian Amazon, with 
imports totalling over €40 million (US$54 million) in 
2013. Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain are all 
within the top 10 global destinations; Portugal and 
Germany sit within the top 15, followed by Denmark, 
Italy and the United Kingdom within the top 20.5
Tropical timber is used primarily for construction (40% 
of tropical timber imported into France, Belgium and 
Italy is used in this way), decking (approximately 30% in 
France and Belgium, and 70% in Spain and Germany), 
sea defences, furniture and road construction.6European Unio n

The Amazon’s Silent CrisisResponsibilities of 
European timber 
importers
 
Under the EUTR, which came into effect in March 
2013, it is illegal for companies to place illegally logged 
timber and timber products on the EU market. Importing 
companies, deﬁned as ‘operators’ under the legislation, 
are also responsible for assessing their suppliers and 
taking appropriate steps to prevent illegal timber and 
timber products from entering their supply chain – 
referred to as due diligence. 
Downstream purchasers, known as traders, must keep 
records of their transactions, so that any potentially 
illegal timber can be traced back to the company that 
imported it. EU Member States are expected to set up 
appropriate legal and administrative structures to enforce 
the regulations and, where necessary, impose sanctions 
on companies that disregard them.
When importing from a high-risk country or region, 
operators are expected to take even greater care to 
avoid illegal timber. In particular, where documentation 
is frequently misused or falsiﬁed, as is the case in the 
Brazilian Amazon, operators cannot rely solely upon 
paperwork to demonstrate compliance with the law. 
They must seek further assurances from their suppliers to mitigate the risk of illegality, and should not import any 
timber from the supplier or region in question until the risk 
has been successfully reduced to a negligible level.7
The EUTR applies to, for example: 1) imports of sawn 
timber to be processed in the EU to make products 
such as decking or ﬂooring and resold; 2) imports of 
timber products such as ﬂooring for sale in the EU; 
and 3) imports of timber products such as ﬂooring and 
decking from outside the EU for the importer’s own use 
(e.g. a hotel chain importing ﬂooring for use in its hotels, 
with no intention of selling the goods on).
Our investigations, supported by other widely 
available and easily accessible information, 
show that illegal logging and timber laundering 
remain serious and systemic problems in the 
Brazilian Amazon in general and in the state 
of Pará in particular. Operators should act on 
this information, incorporating it into their 
risk assessments and implementing effective 
mitigation measures. Each EU Member State’s 
competent authorities should investigate its 
country’s trade in timber from the Brazilian 
Amazon and ensure that operators are acting 
correctly, in compliance with the due diligence 
obligations laid down in the EUTR, and are not 
violating the EUTR prohibition on placing illegally 
harvested timber on the EU market.

44The Amazon’s Silent CrisisFrance
France is the largest European importer of timber 
from the Brazilian Amazon and the largest importer 
of Ipê speciﬁcally (to a value of $8 million in 2013).8 
Companies importing timber from the Brazilian 
Amazon into France include Tradelink Wood Products 
Ltd, Ets Pierre Robert & Cie, Guillemette & Cie, 
Rougier Sylvaco, Ets Peltier, Décoplus and J. Pinto 
Leitão SA. Each of these companies has recently 
bought and imported timber from companies in Brazil  
whose supply chains are contaminated by wood from 
sawmills that have processed illegal timber laundered 
with ofﬁcial documentation .9
Belgium
Belgium is the second-largest importer of Brazilian 
Amazon timber in the EU. Last year, it imported timber 
worth US$23 million, making it the ﬁfth-largest importer 
globally.10 It is also the third-largest importer of Brazilian 
Amazon Ipê, following the USA and France, with imports 
valued at US$6.8 million.11 The port of Antwerp also 
functions as an important hub for distribution of tropical 
timber products to other EU and non-EU countries.12 
Greenpeace has identiﬁed a number of Belgian 
companies that have recently bought and imported 
timber from companies in Brazil whose supply chains 
are contaminated by wood from sawmills that have 
processed illegal timber laundered with ofﬁcial 
documentation. These are: Vogel Import Export NV, 
Vandecasteele Houtimport, Somex NV, Leary Forest 
Products BVBA, Van Hoorebeke NV, Craco and  
Saelens Trading BVBA.13 
The Netherlands
The Netherlands is the sixth-largest destination 
worldwide for Brazilian Amazon timber, and the third-
largest one in the EU. Export data from Brazil show a 
value of over US$21 million in 2013.14 Large importers 
buying from Brazil have shown a trend towards sourcing 
responsibly produced hardwood (i.e. certiﬁed by 
the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)).15 However, 
Greenpeace investigations have uncovered trade links 
between the Netherlands and companies that have 
handled wood from sawmills that have processed illegal 
timber laundered by misusing ofﬁcial documentation. 
These including Madeireira Rancho Da Cabocla Ltda, 
LN Guerra Indústria E Comercio De Madeiras Ltda. and 
Madesa – Madeireira Santarém Ltda.16 Spain
Spain has traditionally been a big market for 
Amazon timber, especially during the pre-recession 
construction boom. Despite the recent decline 
in construction, Spain remains the fourth-largest 
destination for Brazilian Amazon timber in the EU and 
eighth-largest destination globally with exports worth 
US$12 million in 2013.17 In Spain, Ipê has been used 
in a number of public building projects, including the 
Pedro Arrupe Bridge over the Río Nervión in Bilbao, 
the Ebro Environmental Centre in Zaragoza, Diagonal 
Avenue in the Poblenou in Barcelona, and the 
Arganzuelas Bridge over the Manzanares river  
in Madrid.18
During 2013, timber companies including López 
Pigueiras SA, Maderas Casas SA, Tarimas Tropicales 
y Exóticas SL and Maderas Rías Baixas SL imported 
timber from high-risk companies in Brazil.19 The 
number one importer of Ipê in Spain, López Pigueiras 
SA, has a history of trading with law-breaking 
companies in Brazil. In 2006, Greenpeace revealed its 
links with Brazilian companies involved in illegalities 
related to fake land titles and forest management 
plans; the management plans were subsequently 
suspended by the Brazilian environmental authorities.20
Germany 
Exports of Amazon timber to Germany reached nearly 
US$7million in 2013 which makes Germany among the 
top 15 destinations globally for all Brazilian Amazon 
timber exports – and the sixth-largest importer of Ipê 
from the Brazilian Amazon in the EU.21 Several German 
companies have recently bought and imported timber 
from companies in Brazil whose supply chains are 
contaminated by wood from sawmills that have misused 
ofﬁcial documents to launder illegal timber.22
Italy
Exports to Italy amounted to nearly US$6 million in 
2013 ranking the country among the top 20 destinations 
globally for Brazilian Amazon timber exports and 11th 
for Brazilian Amazon Ipê. Ipê is used primarily in exterior 
decking for both private and public properties, such 
as lake- and seafront boardwalks (Lesa, Golfo Aranci), 
piers (Misano Adriatico) and terraces (the Polytechnic 
University of Turin). Key suppliers to the Italian market 
include New Timber and Ipêzai, each of which has traded 
with high-risk companies in Brazil in the last year.23Amazon Brazilian

45
The Amazon’s Silent CrisisDenmark
Denmark is also among the top 20 destinations 
globally for Brazilian Amazon timber exports, 
importing timber worth over US$6 million in 2013.24 
Major importers to the Danish market include 
DLH Denmark and Keﬂico A/S. These and other 
companies have recently bought and imported 
timber from companies in Brazil whose supply chains 
are contaminated by wood from sawmills that have 
misused ofﬁcial documents to launder illegal timber.25
Portugal
Exports to Portugal were nearly US$9 million of Brazilian 
Amazon timber from Brazil, ranking the country the 
12th largest destination in 2013. Signiﬁcant amounts of 
Brazilian Amazon timber, including Ipê, are imported into 
Portugal by J.Pinto Leitão SA.26 J. Pinto Leitão is known to 
purchase timber from companies in Brazil whose supply 
chains are contaminated by wood from sawmills that have 
misused ofﬁcial documents to launder illegal timber, such 
as UTC MADEIRAS LTDA.27The UK 
Exports of Amazon Brazilian timber to the UK were 
over US$5 million US$ in 2013. The UK is among the 
top 20 destinations globally for Brazilian Amazon 
timber exports in general and also for Ipê speciﬁcally.28 
Key suppliers to the building trade are Tradelink 
Wood Products and International Timber (part of the 
Saint-Gobain group). In addition to specialist decking 
suppliers, Brazilian hardwood decking, including Ipê, 
is available from Jewson (also part of the Saint-Gobain 
group) and AW Champion Timber. Over the year to 
February 2014, Tradelink Wood Products, Wood and 
Beyond Ltd, and DLH imported timber into the UK that 
was bought from high-risk companies in Brazil.29

46The Amazon’s Silent CrisisISRAELI TRADE  
IN AMAZON  
TIMBER
Israel has become a key destination for 
Amazon timber: in 2013, it ranked as the 
11th biggest importer in terms of value for 
all Brazilian Amazon timber and 8th for the 
valuable Ipê wood.1 The vast majority of 
Ipê imported into Israel is used for decking, 
and nearly all the decking projects currently 
being carried out by public bodies are 
being constructed with this timber.2 Notable 
examples of Ipê decking in Israel are at Tel 
Aviv Port commercial and entertainment 
district,3 the First Train Station complex in 
Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv Promenade, where 
there is an ongoing project to install decking 
and pergolas (see below). 
In 2013 Israel imported nearly 5,000 tonnes4 of 
Amazon timber, the vast majority believed to 
be Ipê. Some 80% of the total came from two Amazon states, Pará and Mato Grosso,5 where 
illegal logging in 2011–12 is estimated to have 
represented 78%6 and 54%7 respectively of the 
entire area logged. 
The main export ports for Amazon timber 
destined for Israel are Belém, Itajaí, and 
Paranaguá. Generally, Ipê and other 
Amazon timber is loaded into containers, 
which are shipped to the port of Ashdod 
via other countries.8
Importers and traders of Amazon timber in Israel 
include Etz Vetza, Brotim, Treelog, Ordilan, 
Botvin, May Hasharon, A.Z. Gerbi, Averbuch, 
Ashdod Timber Trade, and Shamayim Yerukim 
(Green Sky). Retailers include well-known Israeli 
companies such as the DIY store Home Center 
and Carmel Carpets.9


47
The Amazon’s Silent Crisis
Carmel Carpets
Carmel Carpets purchases its Ipê from Ordilan,10 believed 
to be the biggest timber importer in Israel.11 Amazon 
timber suppliers to Ordilan include DLH. Greenpeace’s 
investigation has established that DLH buys timber from 
several sawmills that have handled timber from estates 
engaged in illegality, including those owned or held by 
Agropecuária Vitória Régia SA, the Associação Virola-
Jatobá, the late Ceser Busnello, Tecniﬂora Ltda and the 
estate of Violeta Elizabeth Hagmann. Ordilan also purchases 
timber from Marine Box, which has sourced timber said to 
be from one of Ceser Busnello’s estates. Etz Vetza
Etz Vetza is one of the best-known timber importers in Israel. 
This family business operates in several locations, including 
Ashdod port and a showroom in the prestigious design 
centre in Bnei Brak. Etz Vetza has a certiﬁcate of origin for 
the Ipê it sells. However, this names the ﬁrm’s Ipê supplier 
in Brazil as Tradelink.12 Greenpeace’s investigation has 
established that Tradelink buys timber from several sawmills 
that have handled timber from estates engaged in illegality, 
including those owned or held by Agropecuária Vitória 
Régia SA, Associação Virola-Jatobá, Ceser Busnello, and 
Tecniﬂora Ltda.13

as a pergola, and more decking and another 10 pergolas are planned. 
The timber contractor for the ﬁrst stage of the project was Shamayim Yerukim, whose 
Brazilian suppliers include K.M. Comercio E Exportação De Madeiras, which buys 
timber from several sawmills that have handled timber from landowners Agropecuária 
Vitória Régia SA and Tecniﬂora Ltda,14 both shown by Greenpeace’s investigation to 
have laundered illegal timber. Shamayim Yerukim is believed to be Israel’s biggest 
contractor for Ipê work.


48The Amazon’s Silent CrisisDEMANDS
The timber industry in the Brazilian Amazon is a key driver of forest degradation 
and deforestation. Thanks to inadequate governance, logging opens up 
intact forest areas to colonisation, damages the region’s rich ecosystems and 
contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, widespread illegal 
logging causes social conﬂict and is characterised by the use of slave labour 
and by acts of violence against its opponents. In view of these multiple impacts, 
it is clear that a new approach to the Brazilian Amazon forest is required – one 
that will tackle the excesses of the timber industry, protect biodiversity and 
the global climate, provide safeguards and opportunities for forest-dependent 
communities, and reassure timber buyers that they are not contributing to 
forest destruction. Clockwise from top left:

The Amazon’s Silent Crisis
Companies trading Brazilian 
Amazon timber must:
t stop buying timber from the Brazilian Amazon unless their suppliers 
can provide credible assurances that it is legal - which requires a 
standard of proof beyond current ofﬁcial documentation - and has not 
contributed to deforestation, forest degradation, biodiversity loss, or 
negative social impacts.
t immediately  classify Brazilian Amazon timber as high risk, given the 
chronic problems with the Brazilian Amazon timber management, 
monitoring and enforcement, and take them into account when 
complying with the regulations or legislation to which they are subject. 
t implement  strong procurement policies to ensure the 
timber they purchase is from legal sources and has 
not contributed to deforestation, forest degradation, 
biodiversity loss or negative social impacts .
t support  reform of the Brazilian system of timber industry 
management, monitoring and enforcement to ensure that timber 
from the Amazon is produced legally and has not contributed to 
deforestation, forest degradation, biodiversity loss, or negative 
social impacts.
Brazil’s  Federal Council  
of Engineering and  
Agronomy (CONFEA) must: 
t suspend  the professional licenses of forestry engineers accused 
by authorities of being involved in illegalities, and cancel licenses of 
those convicted.The Brazilian  
government must:
t  undertake an immediate review of all forest management plans 
(FMP) approved in the Amazon since 2006.
t draw  up and implement new, more stringent rules to ensure 
effective assessment and approval of forest management plans.
t create  and implement a more robust governance, monitoring 
and enforcement system for Amazon timber extraction which is 
transparent and standardised nationally.
t review  all sawmill licenses and create a new 
regulatory system for their operation.
t increase  the capacity of state and federal environmental agencies 
by improving infrastructure and increasing funding for surveillance, 
monitoring and enforcement, and enforce the penalties for those

The Amazon’s Silent CrisisMETHODOLOGY
Greenpeace’s investigation into timber laundering in 
the Brazilian Amazon began with a systematic review of 
every Logging Authorisation (AUTEF) on record in the 
state of Pará.
Between 2006 and 2013,  1,325 AUTEF applications 
were made. Excluding applications whose approval was 
still pending, and AUTEFs that had been cancelled or 
suspended, these applications resulted in the issuing 
of 1,036 AUTEFs that were still ‘active’,1 146 extensions 
of pre-existing AUTEFs, and 15 AUTEFs that had been 
concluded without suspension or cancellation as of 
September 2013. These 1,197 AUTEFs formed the pool 
that we began to ﬁlter in order to arrive at a shortlist for 
closer investigation. They were reﬁned using a three-
stage process, which produced a shortlist of 18 AUTEFs 
that appeared to involve overestimation of the volume 
of Ipê [http://www.chegademadeirailegal.org.br/doc/
doc01pt-br.pdf] present in the corresponding Annual 
Production Unit (UPA) – probably far fewer than had 
actually been involved in illegality.2 
The identiﬁcation of these 18 AUTEFs was conducted as 
follows. In the ﬁrst phase, Greenpeace identiﬁed those 
AUTEFs whose forest inventories listed Ipê trees. This 
produced a longlist of 763 AUTEFs.
In the second phase, these AUTEFs were examined for 
possible overestimation of Ipê in the forest inventories. 
First, AUTEFs that declared a large overall volume of Ipê – 
3,000m3 or more – were marked for further investigation. 
Then, for those AUTEFs that did not meet this criterion, 
the total volume of Ipê declared was assessed against 
a benchmark volume per hectare ﬁgure derived from 
known ﬁgures for average population density and 
average volume of wood per tree.3 In total, 104 of the 
AUTEFs on the longlist (nearly 14%) either declared over 
3,000m3 of Ipê, or declared a volume of Ipê per hectare 
that was more than 60% above the average of 2.4m3/ha.
At this stage Greenpeace undertook aerial inspections 
of several Sustainable Forest Management Plan (PMFS) 
areas to assess their state of conservation and note any 
logging activities. Finally, the 104 remaining AUTEFs were ﬁltered using a number of criteria, including property size 
and the year of validity of the AUTEF. 
Points were awarded for each of these criteria, and 
priority given to those AUTEFs that were most recent 
and contained the most Ipê, while ensuring that both 
large and small properties were represented. The 18 
AUTEFs with the highest scores were selected for ﬁeld 
visits, which were carried out in November 2013. These 
AUTEFs related to 15 PMFSs.
Two teams were assembled to run the ﬁeld visits, each 
consisting of Greenpeace staff and a representative from 
the Pará State Environmental Secretariat (SEMA). One of 
the teams also included a representative of the Federal 
Public Ministry (MPF). One team covered the region of 
Altamira, and the other covered Santarém. 
The ﬁeld visits were conducted under the legal 
compliance assessment criteria outlined in the Guide 
for Forest Management Plan Field Inspections , the 
ofﬁcial handbook used by the Brazilian Enterprise for 
Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA) and the Brazilian 
Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural 
Resources (IBAMA).4 
On the basis of these criteria, Greenpeace concluded 
that 14 of the 18 AUTEFs had enough infractions to 
warrant a recommendation of suspension. These 14 
AUTEFs related to 12 PMFSs, which belonged to 11 
owners. The 18 shortlisted AUTEFs are shown on a 
map below.
Following the ﬁeld investigation, we selected four case 
studies for publication that best illustrated the different 
types of apparently fraudulent activities that we had 
uncovered. An additional case, not selected by the 
original ﬁltering process, was added because of its size, 
ecological importance and signiﬁcance as a location 
where SEMA had uncovered timber fraud too late to 
prevent it. 
In each case, a majority of the credits generated by these 
AUTEFs had been traded,5 even though in some cases 

52The Amazon’s Silent Crisisthere was no evidence that logging activities had taken 
place. This suggests that documentation relating to these 
AUTEFs was being misused to launder illegal timber.
Finally, our researchers mapped out the supply chains 
that linked our chosen cases to export markets. Using 
publicly available MPF data,6 we identiﬁed sawmills 
that had purchased timber covered by credits from the 
12 PMFSs for which signiﬁcant infractions had been 
found, then companies that were selling this timber to 
export markets. Subsequently, we analysed Brazilian customs and 
export data, from which we were able to produce a list of 
importing companies worldwide that bought timber from 
these identiﬁed exporters in the period of March 2013 
to February 2014. From this analysis we can therefore 
conﬁrm that these importers  have purchased  timber 
from companies in Brazil whose supply chains have 
been contaminated by wood from sawmills that have 
processed (either knowingly or through wilful negligence) 
illegal timber that logging companies have laundered by 
means of fraudulent use of ofﬁcial documentation.

 remaining credits that have not yet  
 been traded. An operator   
 may apply at any time to extend such an  
 AUTEF for a further year,   
 even if its initial period of validity has  
 expired. However, remaining credits of  
 an expired AUTEF may not be traded  
 until an extension has been approved.
2 Ipê species, while among the most  
 valuable trees in the Amazon today,  
 are not the only ones whose numbers   are inflated. The same thing occurs  
 with other valuable species, meaning  
 that a much larger number of AUTEFs  
 can be assumed to be backed by some  
 sort of false information concerning  
 volumes of wood. The case of Ipê was  
 chosen as emblematic of the wider  
 problem.
