Key Points

1.  America’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG)
exporter, Cheniere Energy, has launched a
major effort to greenwash its fracked LNG
with a new certification scheme called Cargo
Emissions Tags (CETs).1 Cheniere began is-
suing CETs with LNG cargoes delivered to its
“long-term LNG customers” in June 2022.

2.  Our analysis of a paper2 detailing the meth-
odology behind Cheniere’s CETs found broad
discrepancies between the company’s claims
and the limitations of currently available data.
For example:

- Cheniere’s emissions estimates rely on
facility-level methane emissions data col-
lected from its upstream suppliers by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Stud-
ies have found that EPA data substantially
underestimates methane emissions from
the oil and gas sector by relying on outdated
emissions factors that do not accurately
capture emissions from large “super-emitter”
events.

- A sensitivity analysis found in the paper’s
supplemental information shows that when
more accurate emission factors that better
incorporate high-emissions events are used,
the full lifecycle emissions increase signifi-
cantly. This finding was not incorporated into
the paper’s result and conclusions.

- Cheniere claims its methodology is “suppli-
er-specific”, but 42% of the gas supply as-
sessed in the paper is pooled gas for which no
supplier-specific data exists.

- The authors note that the complexity of
the natural gas network and the lack of data
make it “difficult” (even for industry insiders)
to track the “exact pathway” that gas trav-
els from wellhead to terminal. As a result,
it seems unlikely that the current iteration
of the CETs will be able to provide granular

4

enough information to associate a given LNG
shipment with a specific subset of upstream
suppliers.

- The published methodology paper only
analyses the company’s Sabine Pass LNG
plant and does not provide any information
about the supply chain for its Corpus Christi
LNG plant. This plant is primarily supplied
from the Permian Basin, which has one of the
worst methane emissions rates in the coun-
try. As a result, the discrepancy with EPA data
could be even more pronounced with Corpus
Christi than with Sabine Pass, and the total
lifecycle emissions for Corpus Christi cargoes
could be very large.

3.  Cheniere states that the prime purpose of the
CETs is to inform customers of the emissions
value of cargoes so that they can ‘accurately’
offset emissions with carbon credits. Offsets
are a poor substitute for the systemic change
that is required for addressing the climate cri-
sis, and in most cases they create additional
environmental and social justice issues.

4.  Cheniere’s claims that CETs are part of a solu-
tion to climate change ignore the fact that the
company’s growth ambitions are out of sync
with the trajectory of gas and LNG in climate
safe scenarios. While methane emissions
reduction is fundamental to climate action,
it must go hand-in-hand with winding down
the fossil fuel industry, including the supply of
gas and LNG. The recent IPCC Working Group
III concluded that “Reducing [greenhouse gas]
emissions across the full energy sector re-
quires major transitions, including a substan-
tial reduction in overall fossil fuel use.”3

5.  The CETs say nothing about the wide range
of impacts associated with the U.S. fracked
gas and LNG industries, including community
impacts and environmental injustice.

Introduction

In recent weeks, a major U.S. energy company has
launched a massive effort to greenwash the export
of U.S. fracked gas. America’s largest liquefied natu-
ral gas (LNG) exporter, Cheniere Energy, has begun
marketing its LNG with so-called Cargo Emissions
Tags (CETs) in an effort to convince the world that its
LNG is part of the solution to climate change.4

However, our analysis of the methodology behind
these CETs has found serious flaws as well as a
lack of transparency. We urge customers, investors,
and governments to question both the method of
calculating these tags, as well as the madness5 of
continuing to expand global trade in fossil gas over
the coming decades, despite the clear imperative to
wind down all fossil fuel use.6

Decision (FID) for the Phase 3 expansion of its Cor-
pus Christi terminal, as well as a 15-year purchase
agreement with Equinor for delivery of 1.75 million
tons of LNG per year starting in 2026.8 This new
agreement will significantly expand Cheniere’s gas
exports to Europe. Other companies have quickly fol-
lowed suit, with Southwestern Energy announcing a
multi-year agreement to supply so-called “responsi-
bly sourced gas” to Uniper, one of Germany’s largest
energy companies.9

While Europe’s urgency to replace Russian gas with
new sources has triggered a new wave of infrastruc-
ture and consequent emissions lock-in, it is more
important than ever that significantly greater scru-
tiny is applied to the U.S. industry’s effort to green-
wash its gas via certification schemes.10

In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, re-
newed interest in U.S. LNG exports has seen several
major projects gain financial approval. In March
2022, President Joe Biden signed an agreement with
the EU to increase U.S. LNG shipments to Europe.7
Cheniere recently announced a Final Investment

Quantifying lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
sions is seen by the U.S. fracked gas industry as
crucial in persuading European governments and
companies that American gas is an acceptable
energy source.11 To this end, methane monitoring

has increased significantly over the last two years,
with the industry claiming greater emissions trans-
parency.12 The drive to clean up methane is also in
response to the alarm bells raised within the U.S. in-
dustry after the French energy company, Engie, can-
celed an LNG contract in late 2020 due to concerns
over methane emissions in the Permian Basin.13

In August 2021, a paper was published in the Ameri-
can Chemical Society’s Sustainable Chemical and
Engineering Journal detailing the methodology that
Cheniere is developing to quantify life cycle emis-

subject area has in any way influenced the research
process or outcomes.

But there are other concerns too. The article high-
lights some of the key claims the company intends
to make around the CET program, specifically that
the methodology is both “supplier-specific” and
“improved”. In the article’s Abstract, the authors
claim that GHG emissions associated with cargoes
supplied from Cheniere’s Sabine Pass LNG plant,
one of two the company operates, “are estimated
to be 30–43% lower than other analyses employing

sions associated with its LNG operations and supply
chain.14

Cheniere funded the study, and the corresponding
author is a company employee, whilst other authors
are either linked to, or have worked with, the oil and
gas industry. The model described in the paper is
itself called the Cheniere Lifecycle Analysis Model
(CLAM). It has been shown that corporate funding of
such research can influence what research questions
are answered, as well as potentially driving re-
search away from critical areas relating to a topic.15
Cheniere’s funding clearly raises questions about
the lack of independence of this research, as well
as whether the company’s financial interest in this

national or regional average emission profiles.”
The study goes on to estimate that if Cheniere’s
LNG is used to generate electricity in China instead
of coal, “the effect of fuel switching in China is a
47–57% reduction in GHG emission intensity, cradle
through power generation.”

Our analysis of the methodology described in the
paper raises concerns about the integrity of the CETs
that Cheniere will issue using this methodology or
variations of it. Our critique has been submitted to
the journal in question for review - pending response
- and is summarized, along with other issues, in this
briefing. This briefing therefore questions both the
method and the purpose of CETs.

Questioning the Method 1:
Cheniere’s Methodology Paper is Flawed

The journal article detailing the methodology that
forms the basis for Cheniere’s published emissions
estimates on the CETs contains a number of fun-
damental flaws. These flaws are primarily derived
from the way that methane emissions associated
with the supply of gas to Cheniere’s LNG plant are
estimated.

A crucial issue in any lifecycle emissions analysis of
LNG shipments is its treatment of methane emis-

As a part of its annual Greenhouse Gas Inventory
(GHGI), the U.S. EPA provides national emissions
estimates broken down by economic sector and
GHGs emitted.18 For the petroleum and natural gas
systems sectors, the EPA constructs “bottom up”
inventories that estimate national emissions by
multiplying set emissions factors (for various types
of equipment and activities) by total equipment or
activity counts. For these sectors, the GHGI incorpo-
rates data from the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Report-

sions along the supply chain. Methane is a GHG
with a global warming potential (GWP) that is 84-87
times stronger than carbon dioxide over a 20-year
timescale.16 When burned to generate electricity, gas
can emit roughly half the carbon dioxide per unit of
power generated than does coal. However, due to
the high global warming potential of uncombusted
methane, that advantage is eroded and potentially
reversed if leakage rates are larger than around 3.2%
to 3.4% of total gas production (again considering
GWP for a 20-year time period).17

ing Program (GHGRP).19 The official EPA “bottom up”
estimate of the national methane leakage rate is
about 1.4%.

However, “top down” studies – which rely on air-
craft, satellite, or other field measurements – find
much larger methane emissions from oil and gas
activity. Alvarez et al. (2018) estimated that total na-
tional methane emissions in 2015 were ~60% higher
than the official GHGI estimates, mainly driven by
emissions from the production segment that were

7

twice as large as the GHGI.20 The reason for this dif-
ference appears to be that the official EPA estimates
rely on outdated emission factors and miss the
contribution from the very largest emission events,
or “super-emitters.” A recent paper by Rutherford
et al. (2021) constructed a “bottom up” model that
used more recent emissions factors.21 They showed
that their model is consistent with the “top down”
findings of Alvarez et al., and that in particular the
discrepancy with the GHGI estimate is bridged by the
top 5% largest emission events in their simulations.

The production segment of the Cheniere lifecycle
analysis is built on facility-level data from the EPA
GHGRP, so the key concern with its methodology is
that it is underestimating methane emissions for the
same reasons as the GHGI. The authors do note the
limitations of the EPA data and conduct a sensitivity
analysis using the updated emissions factors from
Rutherford et al. for leaking equipment and tank
leaks. Although these findings are minimized in the
main text of the paper, the Supplemental Informa-
tion shows that properly sampling from the Ruther-
ford et al. emissions factors increases total life-cycle
emissions by 32-37% for leaking equipment, and by
5-6% for tank leaks.

The Cheniere methodology also reveals other data
limitations that call into question claims of “supplier-
specific” CETs. For gas delivered to Sabine Pass,
only 58% was sourced from the 50 known produc-
ers identified by 2018 Cheniere purchasing records,
with the other 42% coming from gas marketers who

do not provide sourcing information (and which are
modeled using U.S. average emissions).22 The au-
thors note that the complexity of the natural gas
network and the lack of data make it “difficult” (even
for industry insiders) to track the “exact pathway”
that gas travels from wellhead to export terminal.23
Because of these limitations, it is not clear if the
current iteration of the CETs provide granular enough
information to associate a given LNG shipment with
a specific subset of upstream suppliers. Instead, the
published methodology appears to provide the an-
nual weighted average of EPA-reported emissions
estimates over Cheniere’s entire set of upstream
suppliers.24

The upstream methane emissions data used in
the methodology paper are not the result of direct,
continuous monitoring of the large number of facili-
ties that supplied gas to Cheniere. Instead, they are
estimates based on outdated emissions factors and
a methodology with known flaws. While some of
the shortcomings of this data were discussed in the
paper’s Supplemental Information, their implications
were not fully discussed in the results, conclusions,
and abstract. As a result of these issues, we believe
that Cheniere’s methodology, as published, contains
significant flaws. Without substantial improvements
in the data collection and analysis, together with
much greater transparency, the emissions estimates
in the CETs issued by Cheniere should be viewed
with caution by customers, investors, policy-makers,
and the general public.

Questioning the Method 2:
The Permian Basin is a Methane Hotspot

Cheniere has two large LNG plants, one at Sabine
Pass in Louisiana and the other in Corpus Christi,
Texas. The methodology paper only analyzed the
supply chain of the Sabine Pass plant, which sources
gas from all over the United States via a complex
pipeline network. The Corpus Christi plant is directly
connected via pipelines to the Permian Basin in West
Texas. On an earnings call in November 2021, CEO
Jack Fusco told analysts, “about 100% of the gas at
Corpus Christi right now is coming out of the Perm-
ian Basin”.25

The Permian Basin has earned a reputation for hav-
ing one of the highest methane venting and leakage
rates in America. A peer-reviewed study published
in early 2022 estimated that as much as 9.4% of gas
produced in the New Mexico side of the Permian
Basin is being dumped into the atmosphere.26 This
suggests that generating electricity produced with
gas from the Permian could have full lifecycle green-
house gas emissions that are larger than coal.27

We expect that there will be significant differences
in the CETs between shipments from Sabine Pass
and Corpus Christi. However the Cheniere methodol-
ogy paper does not provide any information on the
potential scale of that difference. While it appears
that the vast majority of Corpus Christi LNG ship-
ments are currently relying on gas sourced from the
Permian, it is unknown what the proportion of gas
sourced from marketers might be, how many identi-
fied upstream suppliers there are, and what their
respective GHGRP emissions profiles look like. Given
the significant upstream emissions observed in the
Permian, the discrepancy with EPA data could be
even more pronounced with Corpus Christi than with
Sabine Pass.

In June 2022, the U.S. House Committee on Science,
Space and Technology released a report on science-
based approaches to methane monitoring in the oil
and gas sector. It chose to focus on the Permian Ba-
sin, “due to the centrality of that region as a source

of oil and gas sector methane emissions.”28 The
report focuses primarily on “super-emitting leaks”
which, as discussed above, are underestimated in
the EPA’s data.

The committee sent letters to some of the largest
producers in the basin to find out what they were
doing to monitor, measure, and prevent these super-
emitting events. The companies’ responses raise
serious questions about how much Cheniere, whose
Corpus Christi plant is among the biggest destina-
tions for Permian Basin gas, can really know about
methane emissions associated with the Permian
Basin gas it receives and processes for export. The
report states the following about the company re-
sponses:

Even where oil and gas companies are deploying in-
novative LDAR a technologies at greater frequency
and scope, flawed approaches are undermining the
ability of LDAR programs to target super-emitting
leaks. In response to Chairwoman Johnson’s request
for information regarding any “specific LDAR proce-
dures or initiatives” in their LDAR programs designed
to address methane super-emitters, and intermittent
super-emitters specifically, the ten operators provided

lean answers and scant evidence of deliberate effort
to mitigate super-emitters.  (...) Some cited the use of
remote operational monitoring systems that can detect
equipment disruptions which may indicate leaks, with-
out acknowledging that such systems cannot them-
selves distinguish between the small number of super-
emitters and the far larger mass of tiny leaks. A few
operators argued that distinct procedures to address
super-emitting leaks were simply unnecessary, as tradi-
tional practices were sufficient to solve the problem, or
declined to specify any targeted procedures at all. These
responses indicate a troubling lack of initiative on the
part of the oil and gas sector to proactively implement
LDAR practices designed to reduce super-emitting
leaks.b

There is substantial evidence that producers in the
Permian Basin are failing to reduce methane emis-
sions. The widely documented high emissions rates
in the basin suggest that emissions associated with
Cheniere’s cargoes from the Corpus Christi plant are
likely very high.

Questioning the Madness 1:
With or Without Methane Reduction, the
1.5°C Limit Requires Declining Gas Use

Cheniere’s Executive Vice President and Chief Com-
mercial Officer, Anatol Feygin, recently made clear
his company’s strategic interest in methane moni-
toring. Speaking at the Clean Future for Natural Gas
event in Doha in March 2022, he said the reason for
emissions monitoring was “enlightened self-interest
in preserving our social license to operate for de-
cades and decades to come. We are firm believers in
the role of natural gas and LNG in solutions to help
the world decarbonize.”29 But Cheniere’s “enlight-
ened self-interest” ignores the basic math of the
climate crisis.

gas industry’s growth ambitions clearly run counter
to the goal of limiting warming to 1.5oC.30

Energy scenarios that align with 1.5oC clearly show
a decline in gas production and consumption this
decade. In representative scenarios assessed by
the IPCC,31 global gas demand falls 65% below 2020
levels by 2050. In the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions (NZE)
scenario, it falls 56% (see Figure 1).32 This compares
to over 30% growth by 2040 in IEA’s business-as-
usual STEPS scenario, which could lead to an aver-
age global temperature rise of 2.6oC, and therefore
extreme climate change.33

The world’s remaining carbon budget to limit warm-
ing to 1.5°C clearly indicates an urgency to reduce all
fossil fuel use, including gas. While reducing meth-
ane emissions is welcome if it can be consistently
implemented and transparently monitored, the U.S.

Cheniere’s forecast for global LNG demand projects
demand growing 50% to nearly 700 million tons per
annum (Mtpa) by 2040, including over 200 Mtpa
from “new supply” (see Figure 2).34 In contrast,

No new natural gas fields are needed in the NZE
beyond those already under development. Also not
needed are many of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) liq-
uefaction facilities currently under construction or at
the planning stage. Between 2020 and 2050, natural
gas traded as LNG falls by 60% and trade by pipeline
falls by 65%. During the 2030s, global natural gas de-
mand declines by more than 5% per year on average,
meaning that some fields may be closed prematurely
or shut in temporarily.

It is clear that Cheniere plans to grow its LNG busi-
ness into the future, despite the clear scientific im-
perative to wind down the fossil fuel industry. While
methane emissions reductions are a crucial compo-
nent for addressing the climate crisis, such action is
undermined by moves to increase LNG trade.

the IEA’s Net-Zero scenario shows inter-regional
LNG trade peaking by 2025 and declining rapidly to
2050.35 (Note: the IEA data does not include intra-re-
gional trade and is therefore somewhat smaller than
estimates of total global supply.) It is also worth
noting that the IEA projects North American LNG de-
clining to a very low level by 2050 as the remaining
demand is supplied by cheaper producers, primarily
in the Middle East.36

A recent report by Climate Analytics shows that “the
decline in fossil gas power generation starts im-
mediately in 1.5°C pathways. Fossil gas use falls to
15% of total global electricity generation by 2030,
reaching very low levels by 2035 (below 10% in SR15
pathways, and lower in AR6 pathways). (...) The fos-
sil gas phase-out date occurs at most 5-10 years
after the coal phase-out date in both developed and
developing economies.”37

A decline in global gas consumption also strictly
implies a decline in LNG. The IEA’s Net Zero report
states the following about global gas in its NZE
scenario:38

Questioning the Madness 2:
Using Cargo Emissions Tags for Carbon Offsetting
In the May 2022 edition of LNG Industry Magazine,
Cheniere’s Senior Vice President for Corporate De-
velopment and Strategy Tim Wyatt stated that, “CE
Tags will be a necessary prerequisite to credible carbon
offsetting.”39 This clearly indicates that customers
who receive CETs with their LNG cargo may use the
emissions estimate to buy carbon credits to offset
the emissions associated with the cargo. The article
went on to cite 36 cargoes of so-called carbon-neu-
tral LNG having been traded to date.

of ‘learning by doing’, is the quality still so poor?”41
Both Oxfam and Credit Suisse liken the carbon offset
market to the “wild west”, with Oxfam warning they
could be used “as a means to continue business
as usual”.42 “There’s growing scrutiny by investors,
regulators and even consumers to ensure claims are
appropriate and not greenwashing,” adds the bank.43

But the $1 billion unregulated carbon offset market
has been widely discredited by experts, academics,
banks, and regulators for failing to reduce carbon
emissions. One climate expert has called offsets a
“fig leaf to cover business-as-usual that rarely deliv-
ers real gains for the atmosphere,” adding that over
60 percent of credits on the market are from proj-
ects that have “questionable additionality claims.”40

Barbara Haya, the director of the Berkeley Car-
bon Trading Project at the University of California,
who has studied offsetting for two decades, told
the Financial Times in June 2022: “It didn’t work 20
years ago; it still doesn’t work. Why, after 20 years

These concerns led the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to propose greater transparency around
carbon offset use.44 But there is little evidence that
the system can deliver genuine emissions reduc-
tions. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that
many of the forest-based schemes lead to unac-
ceptable community impacts,45 particularly for In-
digenous Peoples46 and people of color. Offsets also
do nothing to reduce local air pollutants that harm
frontline communities, and essentially are allowing
these sources to continue polluting. The potential
role of Cheniere’s CETs in bolstering a discredited
and destructive carbon offset market threatens to
undermine company efforts to reduce emissions in
its operations by creating a veil of carbon neutrality
around a product that is anything but.

BOX: Japan’s SMBC Leads the Finance for Cheniere’s Flawed Tag Scheme

While it is currently unclear if Cheniere will receive a premium for LNG it exports with CETs, the

company has already secured favorable financing terms for the scheme.

In November 2021, Cheniere closed the refinancing of a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility

loan with a consortium of banks led by the Japanese bank Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
(SMBC) and France’s Societe Generale.47 The loan facility was described as an “innovative ESGc
finance transaction” because it offers reduced financing costs for Cheniere if it achieves certain

ESG goals and milestones.

During a November 2021 earnings call, Cheniere’s Chief Financial Officer told analysts:

“the amended facility includes bespoke ESG loan features that provide economic incentives

related to defined ESG milestones. Specifically, these incentives include potential reductions

in interest rate and commitment fees for certain sustainability-linked expenditures such as
expenses to support our QMRVd programs and the achievement of specified climate-related
milestones like establishing the cargo emissions tags in the coming year.”48

SMBC has been the focus of a targeted campaign to end the bank’s financing and support
for fossil fuels.49 This year, two shareholder resolutions were filed to push the bank to stop
financing fossil fuel expansion and develop short and medium range targets to meet the Paris

goals. SMBC will continue to face pressure as it invests in Cheniere and other companies, and

such issues are diverting attention away from the urgent need to end fossil fuel expansion and

phase out the use of fossil fuels.

Environmental Justice:
Wider Impacts of Fracking not Covered

The Cargo Emissions Tags also exclude the widely
documented and extensive local health, ecological,
environmental justice, and other community impacts
associated with the production of fracked gas.50 A
growing body of scientific research has identified a
number of threats to human health associated with
oil and gas production, transport and processing. A
compendium of scientific and medical research on
the impacts of fracking in the U.S. summarized its
findings by saying, “Our examination uncovered no
evidence that fracking can be practiced in a man-
ner that does not threaten human health directly
and without imperiling climate stability upon which
public health depends.”51 A variety of studies have
associated proximity to oil and gas activity with
health problems such as respiratory impacts (e.g.,
asthma),52 cancer,53 poor birth outcomes,54 and
more.55

And poor communities and communities of color
repeatedly suffer the most. In south Texas, there is
evidence that fracking wastewater disposal wells are
disproportionately located in Black, Brown, Indige-
nous, and poor communities.56 Similarly, south Texas
oil and gas flaring is found to disproportionately
occur in Hispanic communities,57 and the risk of birth
complications is higher among Hispanic women.58 In
the Permian and Eagle Ford basins in Texas, a major-
ity of the population living near gas flares are people
of color.59

A more recent study combining data from four
states found “robust evidence that minorities, es-
pecially African Americans, disproportionately live
near fracking wells, but less consistent evidence for
environmental injustice by income or educational
attainment.”60 A series of reports from the Clean Air
Task Force analyzed the natural gas supply chain,
looking at both air toxins61 and ozone formation.62
The studies concluded that a total population of

nine million “face cancer risk above EPA’s one-in-a-
million level of concern due to toxic emissions from
oil and gas operations.”63 In particular, emissions at-
tributed to natural gas infrastructure led to elevated
cancer risk impacting one million Black/African-
Americans, as well as 138,000 asthma attacks and
101,000 lost school days for Black/African-American
children.64

The tags also say nothing about the specific ecologi-
cal, cultural, and climatic impact of the Corpus Christi
LNG plant itself, which has a history of air pollution
violations and negative impacts for the local Latino
community.65 This pollution is being allowed to hap-
pen by the regulators. In June 2022, Reuters reported
that Cheniere’s Corpus Christi LNG plant had “ex-
ceeded its permitted limits for emissions of pol-
lutants such as soot, carbon monoxide and volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) hundreds of times since
it started up in 2018”66.

The article added that, “Instead of levying penalties
for such violations, the Texas Commission on Envi-
ronmental Quality (TCEQ) has responded by granting
Cheniere big increases in the plant’s pollution limits
(…) The facility is now allowed to chuff out some 353
tons per year of VOCs, double the limit set out in its
original permit eight years ago.” Elida Castillo, direc-
tor of Chispa Texas, an organization representing
local Hispanic communities, told Reuters. “We’re the
ones who are left to suffer with all the pollution.”67

And things are set to get worse: The proposed ex-
pansion of the plant would also emit an additional
estimated 51 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent each year, equivalent to the annual emis-
sions from nearly 14 coal plants or 11 million cars.68

Conclusions

Cheniere’s new cargo emissions tags appear to be a deeply flawed attempt at greenwashing U.S. fracked gas
and LNG. Fundamental methodological issues undermine the company’s claims that the tags represent an
accurate and transparent assessment of the emissions associated with LNG cargoes. Attempting to offset
LNG cargo emissions, whether based on information from Cheniere’s tags or otherwise, is not an effective
means to reduce emissions.

Reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector is central to tackling the ongoing climate crisis.
Methane’s extreme potency in warming the atmosphere means the benefits of reducing methane emis-
sions could be substantial in the race to stop warming at 1.5°C – a limit that is rapidly approaching. However,
methane emissions reductions must go hand-in-hand with reducing the production, trade, and consumption
of gas, consumption that produces carbon dioxide emissions. We must produce and use less gas tomorrow
than we do today.

Rather than facilitating the orderly phase out of gas, however, Cheniere’s emissions tags are intended to
secure a long-term future for U.S. gas exports.69 We must question both the methods and the madness of
Cheniere’s Cargo Emissions Tags, while planning for a just and equitable decline of the gas industry.
