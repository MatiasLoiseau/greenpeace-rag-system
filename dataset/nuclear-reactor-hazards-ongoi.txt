Executive summa ry
This r eport gives a compreh ensiv e assessment of the ha zards of op erational reactors, ne w
'evolutiona ry' designs and futu re reactor concepts. I t also addresses the risks associated with the
mana gement of sp ent nu clear fuel. T he first p art of the  report describes the characteristics and
inherent fl aws of the main  reactor designs in op eration tod ay; the second p art assesses th e risks
associated to n ew d esigns; the thi rd part the 'ageing' of op erational reactors; th e fou rth part the
terrorist threat to nu clear power and th e fifth a nd final part the risks as sociated with c limat e
change impacts – su ch as floodin g – on nu clear power.
The main  conclusions a re: 
•All op erational reactors have very serious inh erent safety flaws which cannot b e
eliminated b y safety upgrading;
•A ma jor accident in a light-water reactor – th e large major ity of the reactors – can lead
to radioactive releases equiv alent to s everal times the release at Che rnobyl and about
1000 ti mes that released by a fission w eapon.  R elocation of th e popul ation c an
become necessary for large areas (up to 100.000 km2). The num ber of cancer deaths
could ex ceed 1 mill ion;
•New reactor lin es are envisaged which are heralded a s fundamentall y safe. However,
apart from having their own spe cific safety problems, those n ew reactors would
require enormous  sums for their development,  with un certain outcome;
•The average age of the w orld's reactors is 21 y ears and ma ny count ries are planning to
extend th e lifetime of their reactors beyond the original design lifetime.  This leads to
the degradation of c ritical components  and th e increase of severe incidents.  The age-
related degradation m echanisms  are not well unde rstood a nd diff icult to predict;
•De-regulation (liberalisation) of electricity markets has push ed nu clear utilities to
decrease safety-related inv estments  and limit staff. Util ities are also upgrading their
reactors by increasing reactor pressure and ope rational temper ature and th e burn-up of
the fuel. Thi s accelerates ageing and decreases safety margins. Nuclear regulators are
not a lways able to fully cope w ith this new re gime;
•Highly radioactive spent f uel mostl y is stored emplo ying active cooling. If this fa ils,
this could l ead to a ma jor release of radioactivity, far more important t han the  1986
Chernobyl accident;
•Reactors cannot b e sufficiently protected against a terrorist threat. There are several
scenario's – a side from a crash of an airliner on the reactor buildin g – whi ch could
lead to a major accident;
•Climate  change impacts , such as floodin g, sea level rises and extreme  droughts,
seriously increase nuclear risks.
Com mercial Reactor T ypes and  Their Shortco mings
At th e start of 2005 the re were 441 nu clear pow er reactors, op erating in 31 c ountries.   The age,
size a nd design type of all of the se reactors vary considerably.
The most  prevalent d esign in operation i s the Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR),  with 215 in
operation a round th e world. The PWR design was originally conceived to propel mili tary
submarin es.  The refore, the reactors are, relative to oth er designs, sma ll, but wit h a high-energy
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 5

output.  Consequ ently, the cooling water in th e reactor’s primary circuit is at a higher
temper ature and pressure than oth er compa rable reactor designs. These factors can accelerate the
corrosion of compone nts; in particular, the steam generators now f requently have to b e replaced.
Similarly, extensiv e document ation now exis ts on the  problems of cracking in th e vessel head
penetrations. This cap at the top of th e reactor pressure vessel contains the pip es that allow the
control rods to b e inserted int o the reactor core, to c ontrol th e chain reaction.  I n the early 1990s
cracks began to appear in th e reactor vessel heads of som e reactors in Fr ance. 
Worldwide inv estigations w ere carried out a nd similar problems were found in r eactors in
France, Swed en, S witzerland an d the U.S.   The mos t serious example  discovered to d ate
occurred at the Davis B esse reactor in O hio, USA.  In this c ase the cracking had be en al lowed to
continu e unchecked fo r around a  decade, despit e routin e checks and wh en dis covered th e crack
had penetrated th rough the 160 m m thick pressure vessel with onl y the 5 m m steel linin g of th e
vessel -which w as bul ging from the pressure- stoppin g a breach of th e primary coolin g system,
the most  important s afety barrier. 
Of all commercial reactor types, the PWR has accumulat ed th e largest number of r eactor-years
in op erating expe rience. It is remarkable that despit e this, this reactor type can still expe rience
new and complet ely unexpect ed pr oblems.  A st riking example is the risk of sump  strainer
clogging that was not r ecognized until 2000.
Of similar d esign and his tory to th e PWR is the Russian VVE R reactor.  There are currently 53
of these reactors deployed in seven countries in E astern Europe in th ree ma in reactor designs.
The old est, VVE R 440- 230, h as significant and se rious d esign flaws a nd consequently, the G8
and EU b elieve that they cannot e conomicall y be brought up to a n acceptable safety standard.
The lack of a  second ary containment  system a nd adequate eme rgency core coolin g system ar e of
particular concern.   
The second g eneration of VV ERs, the 440 -213s, h as int roduced a more e ffective emergency
core coolin g system but do es not d eploy a full s econda ry containme nt system 
A thi rd de sign of VVE R, the 1000 -320s, int roduced further design changes but d espit e this, th e
reactors are not co nsidered as  safe as contempora ry PWRs. In fact, foll owing unification of
Germany, VVERs of all generation w ere closed o r construction a bandon ed. B oth s afety and
economic considerations w ere given fo r these decisions,  with s afety concerns more h eavily
weighted.
The second mos t prevalent reactor design is the Boilin g Water Reactor (BWR)  (there are 90 in
operation a round th e world), whi ch w as developed from the PWR.  The modifications w ere
undertaken to i ncrease the simplicit y of th e design and create higher thermal efficiency by using
a single circuit and generating steam within the reactor core. How ever, thi s modifi cation has
failed to i mprove s afety. The result is a reactor that still exhibits  most  of th e hazardous f eatures
of the PWR, while introducing a numbe r of new p roblems.
BWR s have high pow er density in th e core as well as high pressure and te mperature in th eir
coolin g circuit, although all of th ese paramete rs are somew hat low er than in a  PWR.
Furthermore, th e plumbing of th e eme rgency core cooling system is muc h more complex  in a
BWR  and the  control rod inj ection c omes  from underneath th e pressure vessel. Thus, em ergency
shutdown c annot d epend on g ravity, as is th e case in PW Rs, necessitating addition al active
safety systems. 
Significant c orrosion p roblems have been obs erved in man y BWRs. In the early nineties, a vast
amount  of cracking has been detected in a  num ber of Ge rman BWRs, in pipin g of a mate rial tha t
was regarded as resistant to so-called stress corrosion c racking.
   6 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

There is another persisting problem in BW Rs occurred in 2001. P ipes ru ptured at Hamaoka -1
(Japan) and at Brunsbü ttel (German y). The cause in both c ases was an explosion  of a mixture of
hydrogen and ox ygen, which w as produced by hydrolysis in the coolant w ater. If an
oxyhydrogen explosion  damages crucial components  of th e reactor’s control an d protection
system a nd/or the containment  envelope, a severe accident with catastrophi c radioactive releases
(compar able to t hose a t the Chernobyl accident) will d evelop.
The next most  prevalent reactor currently deployed is th e Pressurised Heavy Wa ter Reactor,
of whi ch th ere are 39 c urrently in op eration in s even co untries.  Th e main  design is the  Canadian
CANDU  reactor, whi ch is fu elled by natural uranium  and is heavy water cooled and moder ated.
The reactor’s primary containment  surrounds th e 390 i ndivi dual pressure tub es.  Th e reactor
design has som e inherent design flaws, most  notably that it suff ers from posit ive void
coefficient, wh ereby should th e reactor loose c oolant the level of r eactivity increases.  Se cond ly,
the use of natural uranium  significantly increases the vol ume of uranium in th e core, whi ch can
lead to instabilities.  Th e pressure tub es that co ntain th e uranium  tubes are subject to si gnificant
neutron bombardment.  Experi ence in Can ada has show n that they subs eque ntly degrade and th at
expensiv e repair programmes have had to b e und ertaken, in some  cases after only twenty years
of op eration.
These and other operational p roblems have caused hu ge safety and ec onomic  problems for the
CANDU  fleet.  In June  1990, six  reactors of th e top t en in wo rld lifetime  performance were
CANDU  reactors, fou r of thos e from Ontario H ydro. Within six years, load factors dropped
drastically due to wh at a technical journal called a “maintenance me ltdown” . Furthermore, the
operation o f eight of Ont ario Hydro’s CAND U reactors was suspende d or indefinit ely deferred
in the late 90s – althou gh some  have now r estarted.
The oth er design serialised in Russia w as the RBM K reactor, whi ch is a  graphite moderated
boilin g water reactor and us ed at the Che rnobyl station in Uk raine, whi ch w as the  site of th e
world’s wo rst civilian nu clear pow er accident in 1986.  Th e reactor exhibits  some  of the same
design problems of the CANDU , namely positiv e void c oefficient an d core instability but h as a
series of additional problems that ex acerbate the se problems - in particular, the large number of
pressure tub es (1693 i n the RBMK 1000s ).
Some of the design problems of the RBMK have been rectified as a result of th e experiences
learned from Chernobyl and th is has led to a n increase in u ranium enrichment and a change in
the control rods.  H owev er, for technical or economic  reasons other problems remain.  F or
example,  only two of th e remaini ng twelve reactors have installed full y independent a nd div erse
second shut -down s ystems, and hence the remainin g ten do not c onform to IAEA safety
requirements.
RBMK r eactors also contain more zi rconium alloy in th e core than any other reactor type (about
50 %  more tha n a convention al BWR).  They also co ntain a  large amount  of graphite (about
1,700 tonn es). A g raphite fire can seriously aggravate an accident situ ation - it can also react
violently with wa ter at higher temper atures, producing explosiv e hydrogen.  
Failure of a single pressure tub e in an RBMK do es not n ecessarily lead to c atastrophi c
consequences.  How ever, the large number of t ubes a nd pi pes n ecessitates a simila rly large
number of w elds, and constitutes a system th at is diff icult to inspect and to maintain.  Th e
pressure supp ression capacity of the containment system of RBMKs has been improved so t hat
simultaneous r upture of up to n ine pressure tubes c an be controlled. How ever, in the  case of
flow blo ckage after a loss-of-coolant a ccident, sufficiently high temperatures could b e reached
that would l ead to ruptures in up to 40 c hannels. A c atastrophi c destruction of th e whol e reactor
core could fol low.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 7

The fund ament al design flaws of the se reactors have lead to the  internation al community
classifying these reactors as ‘non-upgradable’ and se eking their closure.  Clos ure has occurred or
will o ccur in L ithuania and Uk raine, but d espit e this, in Russia, e fforts are underway to extend
the lives of th ese reactors rather than r etire them early.
The Unit ed Kin gdom has developed from the plutonium  production r eactors two d esigns - the
Magnox - air-cooled, g raphite-mode rated natural uranium reactor – and subse quently - the
Advanced  Gas Reactor (AGR).  M agnox reactors h ave very low pow er density and
consequently large cores. In an attempt  to ove rcome this p erceived w eakness, pow er densit y was
increased by a factor of two in th e AGR, but it is still low c ompar ed to l ight wa ter reactors.
Carbon dioxide  gas circulates in the  primar y circuit. Gas circulation is mor e complex  in AGR s
as the higher temperature requires a special gas flow th rough the graphite moder ator.
In both d esigns, the reactor core is lo cated insid e a large pressure vessel. The Magnox reactors
with old er steel pressure vessels have suff ered from corrosion. T hese problems are aggravated
by thermal ageing and ma terial degradation c aused by neutron-indu ced embritt lement.
Brittle failure of the  pressure vessel could l ead to tot al los s of th e primary coolant, and po ssibly
large radioactive releases. F or this an d oth er reasons, a number of Ma gnox stations have already
been shut down.
Neither Magnox nor AGRs  reactors have a secondary containment. Both reactor types have a
high pot ential for large radioactive releases.  Th e old Ma gnox reactor fleet mus t be regarded as
particularly hazardous du e to these man y safety deficiencies. 
In addition to th e different inh erent p roblems of th e various re actor designs, op eration al internal
and ext ernal factors ma y conspi re to fu rther reduce the  safety margins.  These factors inc lude: 
Ageing: 
There is general consensus that the extens ion of the life of r eactors is of th e foremost import ance
today for the nuclear indus try. The International En ergy Agency point edly sums it up a s follows:
“If th ere are no c hang es in poli cy towards  nuclear power , plant li fetime is th e singl e mos t
important d eterminan t of nu clear e lectricity production in th e com ing de cade.”
 Across the wor ld over the last two de cades the re has been a general trend a gainst o rdering new
reactors. As a  consequence, the average age of nu clear reactors around th e wo rld has increased
year on y ear and is now 21.
At th e time  of th eir construction it w as assumed that the se reactors would not op erate beyond 40
years.  Howev er, in o rder to max imise profits, lifetime exten sion offers an attractive propos ition
for the nuc lear operators.
Ageing processes ar e difficult to de tect because they usually occur on th e micr oscopi c level of
the inn er structure of ma terials. Th ey frequently become  apparent onl y after a component  failure,
for example  when pi pe breakages have occurred.
The consequences of ageing can roughly be described as  two-fold. F irstly, the number of
incidents and reportable events at an NPP  will in crease – small  leakages, cracks, sho rt-circuits
due to c able failure etc. Se condl y, the aging process is l eading to the gradual weakening of
mate rials that c ould l ead to c atastrophi c failures of components  with subs equent severe
radioactive releases. Most not able among th ese is th e embr ittleme nt of th e reactor pressure
vessel, whi ch in creases the risk of th e vessel bursting. Failure of th e pressure vessel of a  PWR or
a BWR constit utes a n accident b eyond the design basis for which there is no s afety system -
inevitably leading to a catastrophi c release of radioactive mate rial to th e environme nt. As the
world’s nu clear pow er plants get older, there are efforts to p lay down the role of a geing. Those
efforts inc lude conveniently narrowin g the definition of a geing.  Furthermore, the most  basic and
   8 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

severe shortcoming o f international r egulatory norms resides in th e fact that no c ountry has a
compreh ensive se t of t echnical criteria for decidin g when fu rther operation of a  nuclear pow er
plant is no lon ger permitted. As a  consequence reactors are being allowed to op erate lon ger.
It is clear that the risk of a  nuclear accident g rows significantly each year, once a nuclear pow er
plant h as been in operation f or about t wo decades.
Terrorist Threats to : 
Nucl ear Power Plants : 
Even before the attacks in N ew Yo rk and Washing ton in 2001, co ncerns had been raised ov er
the risk of nu clear facilities from terrorist a ttacks.  Nu clear facilities have been targeted in th e
past leading to th eir destruction – su ch as the attack by Israel on th e Osi rak re actor in I raq.   The
threats to nuclear pow er plants f rom terrorist attacks a nd acts of wa r can be summarized as
follows:
●Because of their import ance for the electricity suppl y system, th e severe
consequences of  radioactive releases as well as because of the ir symbolic character,
nuclear pow er plants are “attractive” targets for te rrorist as well a s for militar y
attacks.
●An a ttack on a  nuclear pow er plan t can lead to r adioactive releases equiv alent to
several times  the release at Chernobyl. Relocation of  the popula tion can become
necessary for large areas (up to 100.000 km2). The num ber of cancer deaths could
exceed 1 million.  
●Nuclear pow er plants could be targets in case of war if a mili tary use is sus pected.
●The sp ectrum  of possible modes  of attack is very diverse. At tacks could b e
performed by air, on th e ground and f rom the water. Different means/w eapons c an be
used.
●Protective m easures against terror attacks are of very limited  use. Furthermore, a
number of c onceivable measures cannot be implemented  in a democr atic society.
Reprocessing P lants and Sp ent Fu el Storag e Areas.
The amount  of plutonium  in storage is steadily increasing. While the US and Russia a greed to
dispos e each of 34t of “ excess” weapons g rade plutonium,  the wo rld’s “civil” plu tonium
stockpile exceeds 230t. As of th e end of 2002, the  largest holder of plut onium is the UK with
over 90t foll owed b y France with 80t a nd Russia with ov er 37t. Pl utonium  has two p articular
characteristics; it i s of hi gh strategic value as primar y weapon in gredient an d it is hi ghly
radiotoxic.  A fe w kilograms are sufficient in o rder to manufa cture a simple  nuclear weapon with
only a few micro grams inhaled sufficient to d evelop ca ncer.
Unfo rtunately, none of th e bui ldings at Sell afield o r La Hague have been designed to wit hstand
extreme impacts, fo r example  by fully-fuelled large-capacity aircraft or ballistic missi les. The
probability that they would re sist such impact i s limited. The worst r elease mech anism  for
plutonium,  usually stored in oxi de for m, is a large fire that woul d render plut onium  particles
airborne in micron size s that are easily inhalable. 
Spent nu clear fuel a nd central radioactive waste storage facilities contain b y far the largest
inventories of ra dioactive substances of a ny facility throughout th e nuclear fuel chain. S pent
nuclear fuel in c ooling pools a s well as uncondit ioned high level radioactive wastes in liqui d and
sludge form, are particularly vuln erable to a ttack. The  main reason fo r this i s that the y are
present in r eadily dispersible form in storage facilities that a re not d esigned to withst and a  large
aircraft crash or an attack with heavy weapons . Storage facilities at reprocessing plants contain
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 9

several hund red of times  more th an the radioactive inventor y that was released as a conseque nce
of the Chernobyl disaster.
Cask Storag e Facilities: 
Like other forms  of sto rage, spent fue l in casks a re vuln erable to terrorist a ttacks. Result ant
radioactive releases are likely to be smaller tha n thos e that would r esult fr om attacks on sto rage
pools. On th e other hand, a ccessibility to casks appears to b e greater than of sp ent fu el pools
located in mas sive buil dings. Improvements  to th e storage concept a re conceivable. How ever,
they are only likely to have a chance of b eing imple mented  if the inv entories are not too l arge.
Nucl ear Transports: 
Terrorist attacks against the  transportation of r adioactive material can occur almos t anywhere in
any indus trialised country. Since each shipment is unl ikely to exc eed s everal tonn es, th e
expe cted release wil l be smaller by orders of mag nitud e than thos e which would re sult from an
attack on a  storage facility – ev en if th e transpo rt containers are severely damaged. On t he oth er
hand, th e place wh ere the release occurs cannot b e foreseen, as attacks ca n occur, in pr inciple,
anywhere along urban transportation routes such as  rail or in por ts. 
Climate Change  and Nucl ear Technol ogy: 
Glob al climat e change is a reality. There is a  broad consensus amon g scientists regarding this
issue. The  global average surface temperature has inc reased by 0.6 ±0.2°C  since the late 19th
century. The results of re search performed  by climate scientists indi cate that even sli ght changes
in temper ature have a tremendous i mpact on th e correspondin g number of extr eme weather
events. More intens e precipitations a s well as storms will occur more f requently, which c an and
have impa cted upon th e operation of nu clear facilities and in p articular nuclear pow er plants.
About 700 n atural hazardous e vents were registered globally in 2003. 300 of th ese events w ere
storms and severe weather events, a nd ab out 200 we re major flood e vents.
These unus ual severe weather events impac t upon nuc lear pow er operation by causing floodi ng
or draughts affecting the cooling or other safety systems.  I n addition, s torms can directly impact
upon nu clear operation o r indi rectly, by damaging the electricity grids.  He avy storms can lead to
multiple  damage of the transmission  lines, and hence to los s of of f-site pow er. Every nuclear
power plant h as emergency pow er suppli es, which are often diesel-driven. How ever, eme rgency
power systems with diesel generator are noto riousl y trouble-prone. If the emergency diesel
generators fail, the  situation a t the plant becomes critical (“station blackout ”). A station bl ackout
at a nuclear power station is a  major c ontributo r to se vere core damage frequency. Withou t
electricity the ope rator loos es ins trumentation a nd control pow er leading to an inability to cool
the reactor core. A natu ral disaster that di sables the incoming powe r lines to a  nuclear pow er
station c oupled with t he failure of on- site eme rgency generators can result in s evere accident.
Regulations a nd practices governing these precautions still reflect the condit ions of the  1980 s
and ar e not a ppropriate for the present situ ation of in creasing hazards to th e electricity grid due
to climate c hange as well as due to th e liberalization of t he electricity mark ets and th e increased
threat of terrorist attacks.
New Reactor Designs
While there are only about 25 r eactors und er construction a round th e world – some  of whi ch
may never be complet ed, fu rther development  of th e technolo gy continues, which is
distin guished in t wo categories.
Generation II I
   10 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Throughout the wo rld th ere are around 20 dif ferent concepts fo r the next generation of r eactor
design, know n as Generation III.  Mos t of them are “evolut ionary” designs th at have been
developed from Generation I I (i.e. cu rrent) reactor types with some  modifications, but without
introducing drastic changes. Some of th em represent more innov ative approaches. Ho wever,
only in Jap an are there any commerci al scale reactors of Generation III in operation -  the
Advanced Bo iling Water Re actors (ABWR).  The next most advanced design is the European
Pressurised Water Rea ctor (EPR), which is b eing built in F inland a nd ma y be also sit ed in
France.  
These reactors tend to b e modified version of existin g reactors, in th e case of th e EPR,  it is
simpl y a later version of c urrent reactor designs – the  French N4 reactor and G erman y Konvoi -
with some  improvements, but al so with r eductions in sa fety margins and fe wer redunda ncies fo r
some  safety systems.
Generation IV
Under the leadership of th e Unit ed St ates the “Generation IV International Forum”  (GIF) has
been established in 2000. Cur rently, there are six reactor designs being considered, includi ng;
Gas-Cooled  Fast Re actor System; Lead-Cooled Fast Re actor System; Molten Salt Reactor
System; Supe rcritical-Water -Cooled Re actor System; Sodi um-Cooled Fa st Rea ctor System;
Very-High-Temper ature Reactor System. However, it is un clear what design of r eactor will be
promoted,  what is th e mos t appropriate size, should th ere be an open or closed fu el cycle or what
is the target date for commerci alisation. The  basic concepts of th e “new generation” have been
around a s lon g as nuclear pow er, but the y were forced out of th e mark et in the early years by the
light water reactors – not without r eason, c onsidering the expe riences so far, whi ch ar e
dominated b y technical and economic  problems, and sa fety deficits. In order to ov ercome  these
problems, mate rials, processes and op erating regimes th at are significantly different fr om those
of currently operating systems o r previous s ystems have to b e developed. Res earch and
developme nt are needed to c onfirm the viabilit y and safety of new d esign approaches.  
Each of th ese reactors has large variations a nd relative advantages and dis advantages over one

A. Comme rcial Reactor Types and Their Shortcomings
Introduction
At th e start of 2005 the re were 441 nu clear pow er reactors, op erating in 31 c ountries.   The age,
size a nd design type of all of the se reactors vary considerably.   Some of th ese are still th e ‘first’
generation of nu clear reactors designs, built in the  1950 s and 60 ’s directly from milit ary uses –
plutonium  production o r submarin e propulsion.  However, most  of th e reactors are the second
generation of d esign, developed in t he 1970s a nd beyond.  The major ity of these are Light Water
Reactors (LWR). Th ey fall in three main  categories, the Pr essurized Water Re actor (PWR) of
which th ere are 215 in op eration, th e Boiling Water Re actors (BWR ), 90 in op eration and th e
Soviet -designed Pr essurized Wate r Reactors (VVER), 53 in op eration.   
Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR )
The pressurized w ater reactor (PW R) was developed from the reactors used to p ropel
submarin es.  How ever, PWRs use low e nriched uranium  whereas submari ne reactors use high-
enriched uranium  fuel. D espite this significant dif ference, the PWR still exhibi ts the basic
properties of a militar y reactor, opt imized to give high pow er output whi le taking up a s little
volume  as possibl e.
Pressurized wa ter reactors are the most  common comm ercial reactor type, by far: About 50 %  of
the wo rld’s operating nuclear powe r plants a re PWRs.
PWRs have the highest core pow er density of al l reactor types currently in general use. Their
primary circuit is c haracterized by high pressure and hi gh temperature. Chemicall y reactive
zirconium  alloy is us ed as fuel c laddin g in the  core, although in smalle r qua ntities than, fo r
example,  in BW Rs or RBM Ks. Whe n zirconium  reacts with steam,  hydrogen is produced,
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 15


leading to the danger of a hydrogen explosion  in th e course of a n accident. The core is lo cated
insid e a steel reactor pressure vessel, th e integrity of whi ch is cr ucial to s afety. Pressure vessel
steel embrittleme nt und er neutron bomba rdment  is a known ph enom enon  (especially in old er
plants with a  high copper or nickel content in th e welds). I ts effect on th e behaviou r of th e vessel
under high stress, how ever, is stil l neither entirely know n nor predictable.
Flawless v essel walls an d, in p articular, flawless w elds a re rarely achieved in p ractice.
Therefore, manufa cturers and utiliti es have to a pply stringent control procedures. In-service
inspection for int ernal flaws is und ertaken usin g ultrasoni c and eddy current techniqu es.
Experi ence shows , however, that these techniques are limited  in accuracy and reliabilit y. In
cases of hi gh embrittl ement,  critical crack sizes can be close or even be low the  resolution limit
of these techniques. (This can al so constitut e a problem for other parts of th e reactor like the
main  coolant pip es, wh ere embrittl ement  plays no ro le but c orrosion a nd erosion mech anisms
endanger the integrity of th e mate rials.)
In spite of the  limit ations of insp ection techniqu es, of ficial safety philosoph y assumes  that the
reactor vessel wi ll and cannot bu rst, or that the probability for vessel bu rst is so low it ca n be
safely neglected (vessel embrittleme nt is also discussed in s ection C ).
The steam generators, the link b etween th e primary and second ary circuits, are a notorious ly
weak point in many PWRs. Damage occurs frequently, up to r upture of generator tubes.
Leakages provide a pathway for radioactive releases outside the containment;  they also require
action to p revent a  severe accident.
Steam generator failures lik e the rupture occurring at Mih ama-2 pow er station in Japan in
February 1991 ha ve been traced back to a  variety of causes, su ch as manufa cturing defects or
corrosion, as well as inst allation faults l eading to vibr ations a nd fretting. In-service insp ection of
the often more th en 10,000 ind ividual tub es in a  single steam generator is very difficult a nd
potentially hazardous fl aws may remain und etected.
Due to the high pow er density and th e correspondin gly high densit y of decay heat generation
after shut down, PW Rs depend h eavily on a  large array of complicat ed, active safety systems.
These systems h ave to fun ction f ast and reliably. Active systems depend on a  continuous
electricity supply. Emergency pow er suppli es of nu clear pow er plants therefore must  be
considerably more r eliable than in oth er indus trial plants. Experi ence indicates that this has not
been achieved. Th is issue is very important in c ase of n atural hazards (s ee section D.2 ).
Safety systems are usually redund ant (i.e. more c omponents a re provid ed for a task th an needed).
Failures of individu al components  therefore do not n ecessarily lead to a catastrophi c accident.
How ever, redund ancy becomes  useless if a  so-called ‘common cause-failure’ disables all
parallel trains of a safety system. F or exa mple,  the eme rgency core cooling system of modern
German PW Rs consists of four  parallel trains with fou r storage tanks fo r borated w ater. At th e
Philippsbur g-2 plant, it was dis covered in 2001 th at all fou r tanks w ere not fill ed to th e required
level du ring start-up of the  plant – h ence, the eme rgency core cooling system had not been fully
operation al. Investigations show ed th at this i rregularity had persisted despite 16 y early revisions,
with on e exception. Addit ionally, in th ree of th e four tanks bo ron c oncentration was below th e
required value. In the same year, similar p roblems were reported at  two other German PWRs
[BMU  2001] . In the case of th e stor age tank p roblem at German  PWRs, the reason w as poo r
safety culture – in oth er words, carelessness of th e plant p ersonn el, who a pparently had been
taking shortcuts wh erever possibl e. 
There is a continuous t rend wo rldwide towards in creasing automation  in nu clear pow er plants,
which pot entially can reduce the hazards of human  error. On th e other hand, in creasing reliance
on softw are creates its own problems.  The int erface between m achin e and huma n is noto riousl y
   16 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

prone to e rrors. Furthermore, a utomation  can be seriousl y disadvantageous in c ases of a ccidents
with unfo reseen developments,  if it impedes improvised measu res, whi ch experi enced personnel
might a ttempt.  In addition, it actually prevents the acquisition of practical know ledge and
expe rience by the personnel, whi ch would b e needed in su ch critical situations.
Due to its n egative voi d coefficient –wh ereby when reactor pow er increases and th e water
moder ator starts boi ling, power is reduced again -, a PWR will become  sub-critical wh en heating
up and left to its elf. Howev er, a considerable amount  of energy would be released before suc h an
“inherent” shutdown. Th erefore, rapid and reliable control rod inj ection (r eactor scram) is
required to a chieve sub -criticality fast. Th e scram system, how ever, is also sensitive to c ommon
cause-failures.
The primary circuit o f the reactor, plus some auxilia ry compone nts, are usually located wi thin a
steel or concrete containment  designed to with stand int ernal pressure bui lding up du ring
anticipated accidents (design basis a ccidents- DB As). How ever, thi s containment  is penetrated
in man y places. If isolation fails, r adioactivity will b e released even in t he case of D BAs. To
prevent co ntainment  failure during more s evere accidents, filtered venting systems h ave been
installed in man y PWR plants. Nevertheless, accidents with e arly destruction of th e containme nt
are poss ible which render the venting system us eless – fo r example,  reactor pressure vessel
burst, st eam explosion,  or ejection of molten  core mate rial out of the  reactor vessel at high
pressure. 
Hydrogen explosions  constitut e another mechanism  for early containment  failure. In the last
decade, passiv e autocatalytic recombine rs have been installed in man y PWRs world-wide, whi ch
recombine hydrogen with ox ygen at concentrations b elow the flammability limit,  without
requiring exte rnal pow er suppl y. As a  result of the heat the y produce, the y also increase
convection in t he containment,  which leads to better mixing of th e atmosphe re and ca n prevent
high local hydrogen concentrations. Thus, t he hydrogen hazard has be en somewhat r educed, a t
least for large, dry containme nts (i.e. the type of co ntainme nt of mos t PWRs).
A considerable hazard is p resented by the spent f uel sto rage pool, whi ch is lo cated in o r near the
reactor buildin g, in some  cases insid e the containme nt. Reactor accidents ca n be the trigger of
fuel pool a ccidents a nd vice versa, leading to in creased radioactive releases. F urthermore, in
two-unit plants, sometimes with int erlocking systems, a n accident in on e reactor can affect the
safety of th e oth er.
The radioactive releases associated with s evere accidents in a PWR can be very high,
compar able to o r even hi gher than th e releases from the Chernob yl accident. Up t o 90 %  of th e
caesium  inventory of th e reactor core ma y be released [HAHN  1999] . For a reactor with a power
of 1300 M We and hi gh burn-up fu el, thi s corresponds to a bout 350.000 T era-Becquerel of
caesium- 137. Th e release of th e same nuclide in Che rnobyl was about 85.000 T era-Becquerel.
The difference stems mainl y from the fact that in Chernobyl, “only” 20 – 40 %  of the core
inventory was released; fu rthermor e, due to low er bu rn-up c ompa red to a  PWR, the inv entory
was somewhat low er.
The design of PW Rs varies considerably in dif ferent c ountries. However, there is no
straightforward wa y to jud ge which de sign is “ better” or “worse”. For instance, the indi vidual
loops of th e eme rgency core cooling system a re less interlocked in the  German PW Rs than in th e
US, French, Sovi et or Japanese types. This reduces the risk of f ailure propagation th rough the
system. On th e oth er hand, it g ives less flexibility in switching over compone nts from one loop
to another.
The levels of di versity (provision of different systems to p erform the same task a nd redund ancy
-multiple  provision of s ystems fo r one  task-) also vary between countries. US  reactors seem to
have more div ersity in th eir emergency core coolin g systems. Regarding redund ancy, the
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 17

German principle of 4x50%  capacity compares favour ably to the 2x100%  found in som e other
PWRs (for exa mple,  in Fr ance), since it allows fo r failure of one loop with simultaneous r epair
of another one. Design pressures of th e em ergency core cooling systems a lso v ary considerably.
Regarding the containme nt, many US plants have a significantly lower design pressure than th e
average plant wo rldwid e. A small  numbe r of US and Japanese PWRs have a particularly
problematic i ce condenser containment.  This t ype of containment is equipped with a  pressure
supp ression s ystem consis ting of large baskets of ic e that serve to condense steam in the event o f
coolant lo ss from the primary circuit. It is no table for a particularly low design pressure and
small  containment  volume.
Safety problems of P WRs are exacerbated b y increasing fuel bu rn-up, i. e. by increasing the
energy gained per ton of fue l. The trend to r aise burn-up h as persisted fo r many years, for
economic reasons; it h as int ensified in the last decade. Wher eas originally, 30 o r 35 M Wd/kg
were typical fuel bu rn-ups, v alues above 50 MW d/kg a re increasingly achieved in man y
countries. This is accompanied with in creases in the  enrichment  of the fresh fuel.
Higher burn-up leads to hi gher loads to fu el element  hulls. I t is to b e exp ected tha t the failure
rate of fue l rods will in crease with in creasing burn-up. Al so, the handlin g of th e spent fu el
elements become s more dif ficult –se e section D.1.ii -.
Of all commercial reactor types, the PWR has accumulat ed th e largest number of r eactor-years
in op erating expe rience. It is remarkable that nevertheless, this reactor type can stil l experience
new and complet ely unexpect ed pr oblems.  A st riking example is the risk of sump  strainer
clogging which w as not re cognized unt il after the year 2000.
The em ergency core cooling system, whe n activated because of c oolant loss from the primar y
circuit, draws w ater from the borated wa ter tanks a lready mentioned. When  thos e tanks h ave
been emptied, intake is swit ched ove r to t he so -called sump,  i.e. the low est part of the
containme nt whe re the water leaking during a loss-of-coolant a ccident c ollects by virtue of
gravity. Thus, a  kind of co oling circuit is establish ed.
How ever, in th e course of a loss-of-coolant a ccident, ins ulation fr om pipes might b e dislodged
and trapped to t he containment  sump,  together with oth er debris, which might b e present. T his
can lead to c logging of th e sum p intake of the emergency core cooling system, s eriously
impairin g this system’s ope ration – unl ess sump  strainers are adequately designed.
This p roblem has been known sin ce 1992, a fter an incident in a  Swedish BWR. Backfits took
place in ma ny BWRs  worldwid e. PW R operators, how ever, argued that their risk was much
lower because of l arger sump screens. Onl y recently, how ever, expe riments in France and th e
U.S. show ed th at strainer size w as no t the onl y relevant factor and th e clogging potential
represented a substantial increase in c ore damage risk.
In early 2005, th e problem is still not c ompletel y resolved as in man y plants; backfits a re still
under way or in th e planning stages [NUC WEEK 03_04].
Because of this p roblem, the Biblis-A PW R (German y) was not p ermitted  to resume operation
after a brief planned shutdown  in mid- April 2003. Af ter long and controversial debates between
licensing authorities and pl ant own er RWE Powe r, strainers were upgraded and the  plant started
up again on D ecembe r 30 of th e sam e year [DATF  2003] .
In December 2003, El ectricité de France (EdF) became th e first op erator of a  large PWR fleet to
plan backfits to all of its re actors on a  rapid schedule. Backfits are to begin 2005. Ba ckfits were
also being push ed in B elgium.
The U.S.NR C initially was slow to fo llow up the issue, holdi ng up p rogress in oth er countries
like Spain o r Japan  that tradition ally follow the NR C’s lead. H owev er, efforts gained mo mentu m
   18 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

during 2004, foll owing a joint workshop of the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency and the NRC  in
February. Representatives attended this workshop f rom mos t countries op erating PWRs
worldwid e, including VVERs  [NEA  2004].
In December 2004, th e NRC finally approved an evaluation method  for analyzing the sump
performance in U.S.  PWRs and laid down a  timetable for operators to r esolve this issu e.
How ever, it a ppears tha t the issue, in spit e of its hi gh significance for risk, is not regarded as
particularly urgent. Th e beginnin g of corrective actions can be postpon ed unt il April 1, 2006,
and th e conclusions of these actions onl y have to b e complet ed by December 31st, 2007 [N RC
2004].
Anoth er problem that only emerged after decades of P WR operation a nd has persisted fo r over a
decade is reactor vessel head penetration c racking. Vessel head penetrations al low the control
rods to mano euvre into the pressure vessel. Th e rupture of on e or several such penetrations
could th erefore lead to los s-of-coolant combined w ith a severe reduction of r eactor control.
Source:  WCPN1
Vessel head penetration c racking (VHPC)  was first discovered at several French reactors in
1991. F ollowing that dis covery, cracks we re also found a t PWRs in Swe den, Swit zerland, th e
USA  and oth er countries [SCHNE IDER 1993].  This a geing-related problem is still no t
complet ely resolv ed; in th e USA,  in particular, extensiv e vessel head replacing is und er way and
scheduled to b e completed b y 2007 [NU CWEEK  23_03].
The degradation o f the vessel head did no t in every case stop at “me re” cracks: During the repair
of a cracked noz zle at Davis Besse PWR (USA), ext ensive c orrosiv e damag e to th e vessel head
was dis covered. Th e case of t his “record” damag e – on ly a thin st ainless steel lin er, whi ch had
already started bul ging, prevented a very severe loss-of-coolant ac cident – i s treated fu rther in
section C .
Soviet-designed Pressurized Water Reactors (VVER )
The VVER  (water-water-energy-reactor) reactor line wa s developed in t he Sovi et Uni on.
VVERs  are pressurized w ater reactors, and basically the section on P WRs also applies to th em.
How ever, VVERs not onl y have certain design features in c ommon,  they are also b eset with
specific and particularly severe safety deficiencies which de serve separate treatment.  In
particular, the first generation (VVER-440/230 ) – along with the RBMKs – has come into fo cus
1 http://www.wcpn.org/news/2002/07-09/image s/roc k_radiation/ve ssel-head-deg-large.gif
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 19


because of th e effect on pl ant safety of th eir subst andard design features. These reactors have
been de clared as “non up gradeable” or high risk reactors by the European Union a nd th e G7.
[G7] They mus t be closed in all new EU member  states.
Originally, thos e reactors were not eq uipped with a n eme rgency core cooling system d eserving
this n ame,  but with a  make-up w ater system of low c apacity, designed onl y for rupture of a  pipe
with 100 m m inside di ameter. A s the main  coolant pip es’ diameter is 500 mm , far worse
leakages are possi ble.
The reactor doe s not h ave a second ary containme nt system in stead a so-called confin ement
system c omprisin g several sealed and int erconn ected compar tments is present as a barrier
against radioactive releases. A hi gh leak rate, low d esign overpressure and un reliable vent v alves
ventin g directly into the atmosphe re characterize this c onfinement system.
The safety of fi rst-generation V VERs is fu rther reduced by deficiencies in r edund ancy and
diversity of equipment, as well as by problems with re actor materials. The pressure vessel is
particularly prone to embr ittlement.
Significant b ackfittin g has been implem ented a t VVER  440/230 -plants in th e 1990 s. Most
notably, the water system us ed for  eme rgency core cooling was up graded and the leak tightness
of the confin ement system was  impr oved by up to a  factor of 100. Howe ver, design basis
accidents still do not in clude the break of a  main  coolant pipe; onl y pipe breaks up to 200 m m
diamet er can be controlled. Furthermore, it do es not a ppear feasible to b ackfit the pl ants w ith a
containme nt system th at co uld pr ovide a similar d egree of protection a s the containme nts of
modern w estern PWRs [WENRA  2000].  Nevertheless, e ight first-generation VVERs  are still
operating by early 2005: Two units a t Bohunice in Slovaki a, two a t Koz loduy (Bulgaria), two at
Kola (Russi a) as well as the two p rotot ypes at Novo -Voronezh (Russia).
   20 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards


Second -generation V VERs (440/213) a re fitted with a n eme rgency core cooling system d esigned
to cope wit h the break of a  500 m m main coolant p ipe. Th ey have a containme nt with p ressure
supp ression vi a a bubbl e tow er system, in p rinciple resembling we stern BWR  containments.
Containment  leak rates are high compa red to w estern reactors, and th e containment system
generally is inf erior to th e full-pressure containments  of most western PW Rs. The complex
behaviour  of the  water-filled pressure-supp ression trays has been tested for design basis
accidents and appears to be adequate for thos e; how ever, no t ests h ave been performed  for
severe, beyond-design-basis accidents [NEA  2003] . It is to be feared that sa fety margins are very
small  in case of suc h event.
Anoth er problem of second -generation VVERs  is th e poo r quality of ma terials (for example,
regarding reactor pressure vessel and pipin g). Also, problems with qu ality of equipment  and th e
hazards o f common- cause failures due to lack of spatial separation of pip es, cables and trains fo r
instrumentation &  control r emain to some  extent in spit e of r ecent backfitting activities.
Furthermore, th ere is an  unfavou rable arrangement of th e turbin es relative to th e reactor
buildin g, leading to the pos sibility of co nsequential damage followin g turbine failure [GRS
1991].
The newer VVER-1000 model  is th e first Soviet r eactor to b e fitted w ith a full-pressure single
containme nt, and there are further improvements  regarding the redund ancy of safety and control
systems. Th e containme nt, how ever, has a basic sho rtcoming not e ncount ered in w estern PWRs.
The low er containment  bound ary (containment  basemat) is not in c ontact with t he ground, but is
located at a higher level insid e the reactor building. In case of a  severe accident, melt -through
can occur within a bout 48 hou rs. Th e containment  atmospher e will then bl ow down int o parts of
the reactor building that a re not le ak-tight. Hi gh radioactive releases result. Furthermore, th e
reactor buildin g – includin g the main  and eme rgency control rooms  – will h ave to b e abandon ed
[FEA  2004; ATPP  2001] .
Other safety concerns lie with th e qua lity and reliability of ind ividual equipment,  especially with
the inst rumentation a nd co ntrol systems. Th e plant layout has weaknesses that make th e
redund ant sa fety systems vu lnerable to h azardous s ystems interactions a nd comm on-cause
failures due to f ires, int ernal floods  or exte rnal hazards [WENRA 2000].
The embri ttlement of th e reactor pressure vessel also constitut es a potential problem and the data
base for the prediction o f embrittleme nt progress over the years is generally inade quate with
formulas  used for  prediction a re not n ecessarily conservative. Th e problem is particularly severe
since welds in VVER-1000 pr essure vessels freque ntly have a rather high content of i mpurities
that accelerate embrittl ement,  like ni ckel and man ganese. The processes occurring are still no t
complet ely understood.
Steam generator integrity is a further issu e of c oncern, in p articular regarding the steam
generator collector. Up t o 1999, cr acks have developed on 25 st eam generators in op erating
VVER-1000s. I n three cases, damage was found b ecause a leakage of radioactive water into t he
second ary circuit had already taken pl ace [IAEA 1999] . Improved mate rials are being used now
in the steam generators of some VVER-1000 pl ants.
Regarding protection against exte rnal events, the level found a t VVERs  is low er than that
correspondin g to the  best western pr actice but r oughly compar able wit h that of western plants of
the same vintage.
There are extensiv e debates on th e hazards o f all generations of VVER  plants in c omparison to
western PWRs. The issue of wh ether they can reach a western standard by backfitting has been
subject of ma ny studi es and dis cussions. How ever, the simple fact of wh at happened to th e onl y
genuine VV ERs that c ame und er the supervision of th e authorities and technical suppo rt
organisations of a  Western Eu ropean state shoul d not b e forgotten.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 21

The uni ts of G reifswald -1 to - 4 (first generation VVE Rs) were shut dow n immediatel y when
Germany was reunifi ed. G reifswald -5, a second-generation VVER  that had reached first
criticality in early 1989, wa s decommissioned  whil e still in th e start-up ph ase. And the units
Greifswald -6 to -8 as well as Stend al-1 and -2, second- and thi rd-generation VVERs  in va rying
stages of c onstruction w ere never complet ed. B oth s afety and economic  consid erations were
given for these decisions, with sa fety concerns, how ever, predominant.
Design deficits, embrittl ement  and ot her mate rials’ problems made the  need fo r immediate
shutdown obvious fo r the first generation VV ERs. For the other plants, un certainties as to th e
success of b ack fittin g measures lead to the conclusion that further investments were not wor th
the effort. The situ ation w as exa cerbated by the less than w ell-ordered state of plant
documenta tion; a great numbe r of modifi cations h ad been imple mented during construction a nd
it proved extremely difficult to obt ain a  clear picture on th e up-to-date plant st atus.
Boiling Water Reactors (BWR )
The boi ling water reactor (BWR) was developed from the pressurized water reactor, in a n
attempt  to modif y the PWR towards g reater simplicity of design and hi gher thermal efficiency
by using a single circuit and by generating steam within th e reactor core. How ever, thi s
modification h as failed to impr ove safety. The result is a  reactor that still exhibits  most  of th e
hazardous fe atures of the  PWR, while intr oducing a large number o f new problems.
BWR s have high pow er density in th e core as well as high pressure and high temperature in th eir
coolin g circuit, although all of th ese paramete rs are somew hat low er than in a  PWR. The
uranium  inventory in the core is higher than in P WRs. (The water inventor y in th e cooling
circuit is also higher than in P WRs, this ca n be advantageous in som e accident situations). T he
   22 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards


amount  of chemical ly reactive zirconium  alloy fuel c laddin g is two to three times  that of a  PWR.
The “primary circuit” of a BWR  passes outside the reactor containment.  Thus, a  leak in this
circuit, coupled with f ailure of i solation valves, off ers a direct pathw ay for unc ontrolled releases
into th e atmosphe re.
As in a  PWR, the reactor core of a BWR  is loc ated in a  pressure vessel. T he basic problems of
the PWR vessel apply here too, bu t with modifi cations. Neutron fluxes  are considerably lowe r
than in a  PWR vessel (by a factor of 10 ), leading to si gnificantly less embri ttlement. On the
other hand, th e vessel is much  larger; longitudinal w elds ma y be required, wh ereas there are only
circumfer ential w elds in a  PWR vessel. Th ere is a lso a muc h more complicated inn er structure,
as well as many penetrations a t the bottom. Flawless manufa cture of such vessels is particularly
difficult, their inspection hind ered by the penetrations.
Like a PWR, a BWR  depends h eavily on fast and reliable active safety systems, but th e
plumbing of th e eme rgency core cooling system is muc h more complex  in a BWR.  Control rod
injection i s from unde rneath th e pressure vessel. Thus , it cannot d epend on g ravity, as in P WRs,
necessitating additional active systems. Re gulating the operation of a  BWR  is generally more
complex  than in a  PWR. Und er certain c ircumstanc es, th e collapse of so -called steam voids in
the core can lead to in creasing reactivity and thus in creasing pow er during an accident. ( BWRs,
like PWRs, have a negative voi d coefficient. Thus, w hen the reactor heats up an d more bubbl es
form, the chain re action wi ll become weaker, creating less pow er. This f eature can become
hazardous , how ever, wh en steam bubbl es collapse.)
Old BWR s have an exte rnal wa ter recirculation circuit wit h a pipe inlet below the  top of th e
reactor core. A b reak in thi s pipe would le ad to a particularly hazardous s ituation, s ince the core
would r apidly be exposed, a s water was lost. Mod ern BWR s have internal recirculation pumps,
avoidin g the exte rnal circuit but n ecessitating additional p enetrations of th e reactor vessel from
below.
As oppos ed to P WRs, the coolant of BWR s generally has compar atively high oxygen content,
and significant c orrosion problems have been obs erved in man y BWRs. In the early nineties, a
vast amount  of cracking has been detected in a  number of Ge rman BWR s, in piping of a mate rial
(stabilized austenitic steel) that w as regarded as resistant to so- called stress co rrosion c racking.
BWR  containments exhibi t one crucial difference from most  PWRs: even fo r design basis
accidents (DBAs), they depend on a  pressure supp ression s ystem to retain containment integrity.
During an accident, th e pressure suppr ession pool would b e subject to h eavy stresses. A s in
PWRs, beyond design basis accidents ( BDBAs) are possible th at co uld lead to c ontainme nt
destruction, even with a  functionin g pressure supp ression. I n older BWR designs, such as  the
German “Series 69 ” and th e US  Mark 1 c ontainment,  core melt will almost  inevitably lead to a
rapid b reach of c ontainment,  resulting in very high releases of r adioactivit y.
Containment  isolation in th e BWR  is generally poor and susceptibl e to f ailure. Most BWRs now
emplo y containme nt inertisation ( i. e. limiting the  amount  of fr ee oxygen by introducing inert
gases into t he containment) wi th nitrogen to prevent hydrogen explos ions that co uld lead to
containme nt failure in case of a ccidents. A ccess to th e containment during operation, how ever,
is serious ly impe ded by this measu re. Thi s can be very problematic, as illust rated by the
Brunsbuettel event of De cember 2001 d escribed be low.
The basic BWR design varies in different countries. All US BWRs have an exte rnal water
circuit. Older Swedish BWR s also have exte rnal recirculation, but t he fou r more r ecent plants do
not. I n Germany, none of th e BWR s still operating has external recirculation.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 23

Redund ancy in the eme rgency core cooling system is somew hat higher in G erman  BWRs. On
the oth er hand, US  BWRs have higher, thou gh still limited, diversity. Some  Swe dish power
plants h ave more diversity in th eir options fo r eme rgency pow er supply.
Most of th e European BWR s have systems fo r filtered containme nt venting as a precaution
against over-pressurization. As in th e case of PW Rs, there are accident sequences for which
ventin g is useless. I n the USA  and Japan,  venting systems are not c onsidered necessary to
prevent co ntainment  over-pressurization.
Even after decades of operation of BWR s, safety problems persist which have been know n and
studi ed fo r a long time,  and can even get more serious with n ew fu el types. A typical example  is
neutron flux  oscillations. Such os cillations ca n occur during (otherwise com paratively harmless)
transients and permissible  loads to fu el rod claddin g may be exce eded if the y are not rapidl y
supp ressed, leading to cladding failure.
In the 1980s a nd early 90s, several such events have been ob served in BWR s in Sweden, the
USA,  German y and oth er countries. After a pause, flux  oscillations th en occurred again at
Oskarshamn-2 BWR  (Sweden) and Philippsburg-1 BWR  (German y). A new core design aiming
at low n eutron le akage, new fu el assemblies for higher burn-up a nd oth er changes had reduced
the mar gin between the no rmal operation al parameters and the ins tability region.
At present, s o-called in- phase oscillations (w hen the entire core oscillates in ph ase) seem to be
sufficiently understood to b e avoided. How ever, the me asures to c ontrol ou t-of-phase
oscillations still need to b e developed further. (In this case, parts of the  core oscillate in counter-
phase to e ach other.) [GRS 2003]
There is another persisting problem in BW Rs that became more p rominent  in 2001, with fi rstly
pipes ruptured on Nov ember 7 a t Hamaoka -1 BWR  (Jap an) and then on D ecembe r 14 at
Brunsbüttel BWR  (Germany). The cause in bo th cases: An explosion  of a mixture o f hydrogen
and ox ygen, which wa s produced by hydrolysis in the coolant w ater.
Oxyhydrogen is generated continuous ly during BWR  operation. I t is present in th e cooling
circuit and pipes. No rmall y, the gas is mixe d with st eam,  and the  explos ive pot ential is th erefore
supp ressed. How ever, slight changes of t empe rature can lead to s team condensation, l eading to
the formation of ox yhydrogen bubbl es.
In the late 1980 s, there had al ready been occasional problems with explos ive gases collecting in
German BWRs, leading to valve damage. Counter mea sures had be en taken, su ch as installation
of recombiner s and temper ature monit ors for the timel y recognition of th e cooler zones wh ere
oxyhydrogen bubbl es might c ollect. Clea rly, how ever, thos e measu res were not suffi cient, o r had
not b een implemented to a sufficient degree at all plants.
After the Brunsbütt el accident, l engthy investi gations of th e issue took pl ace in G ermany.
Addition al counter measures were implemented a t BWR plants. It became c lear that there are
basic problems in connection with th e explosion  hazard in BWR s which are not y et fully
understood – in p articular, concerning the strength of d etonations if c omple x gas mixtures,
containin g other components  in addition to ox yhydrogen, are involv ed [AMNT  2004].
This issu e is c rucial for the safety of BW Rs: A pip e rupture as had occurred at  Brunsbütt el can
lead to a loss-of-coolant a ccident, which in pr inciple can be controlled if th e safety systems
function a ccording to de sign. How ever, if an  oxyhydrogen explos ion also da mages crucial
components  of th e reactor’s control an d protection s ystem and/or the containme nt en velope, a
severe accident wit h catastrophic radioactive releases (comparable to thos e at the Che rnobyl
accident) will d evelop.
   24 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Anoth er problem hit Japanes e BWR s in 2002/ 2003.  All 17 BWR s operated by TEP CO had to be
shut down wh en it was revealed th at there were defects in c ore internals. Thi s was linked with
very serious d eficits in “safety culture”: TEPCO  staff had routinely covered up ins pection
findin gs that shoul d have been reported to re gulators immediately. During the inv estigations,
addition al problems surfaced – fo r example,  debris items were found in th e suppression pools of
several units. Repl acement of core shrouds w as required in some  cases [NU CWEEK 02_04 ;
NUC WEEK 48_04].
Several BWRs operated by other utilities suf fered from similar p roblems Chubu  Electric’s
Hamaoka -1 and -2 have already been shut dow n for several years; core shroud r eplacement  is to
performed and expe cted to b e completed b y 2007 an d mid- 2005, re spectively [NUCWEEK
48_04].
With  TEPCO, the problems also led to lon g outages and the BWR  units were only gradually
taken back on lin e. By April 2004, 8 of t he 17 r eactors were operating again [NE I 2004];  even
by December 2004, ov er two y ears after the problem was first discovered, not a ll units
concerned w ere back on lin e, with two BWRs  still not op erating [NUC WEEK 06_05].
Graphite M odera ted B oiling Water React ors (RBMK)
The Sovie t RBMK  reactor was originally designed fo r dual-purpose civilian-milit ary operation.
It is built fo r on- load refuelling, and can therefore be used for the production of h igh-grade
plutonium  in fu el elements  that remain in the  core for a short period o f time, whil e at the same
time being operated fo r electricity production.  On -load refuelling also has consid erable
economic advantages. In water-cooled reactors, it necessitates the use of p ressure tub es
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 25


surround ing individu al fuel elements (1693 i n an RBMK -1000 ) rather than a pressure vessel
containin g the whol e core.
Like first-generation V VERs, RBMK reactors are regarded as “non up gradeable” by EU a nd G7
[G7]
Because of th eir combination of graphite mode rator and light water cooling, RMBK re actors
have a positive void coefficient. T his mea ns that if the water coolant e vaporates, th e number of
neutrons in creases and the fiss ion process can run away with its elf. This is a  particularly
dangerous feature; it re quires extremely rapid c ontrol rod ins ertion in t he event o f an accident
and ca n lead to a  large energy release wit hin the core. (The void c oefficient is n egative onl y for
low fu el bu rn-up.)  In the original RBM K design, this hazard w as exa cerbated by the so- called
“positive scram effect” – co ntrol rods, b eing rapidly introduced into th e core, were actually
increasing reactivity at first because of a  design sho rtcoming. Th e result of thos e deficiencies
became apparent a t the Che rnobyl accident in 1986.
Since 1986, measu res have been taken to r educe the pos itive void c oefficient a nd to c orrect the
deficiencies of th e control ro ds to eliminate th e posit ive scram effect [DONDE RER 1996;
BUTCHER  2001] .  Fuel enrichme nt has been increased, a ddition al absorber rods h ave been
installed to p rovid e a larger reactivity margin, and th e time  needed fo r complet e rod ins ertion
has been reduced. It is no lon ger possible to swit ch off th e scram system whil e the reactor is in
operation. To ma ke huma n error less p robable, control rooms  have been fitt ed wi th new
computeris ed facilities to p rovide a more compr ehensiv e reactor control system.
How ever, a major safety deficit still persists in early 2005, in a ll RBMK pl ants but t wo: Th e
reactors do not h ave a fully indep endent an d div erse second s hutdown system, and hence do not
conform to IAEA safety requirements. This issue has lon g been id entified as having high priority
[IAEA 1999].  How ever, there are only two RB MKs where such a  system h as been ins erted. Th is
system c onsists of a separate set of f ast-acting control rods th at can provid e rapid shut down of
the reactor. On e of th e RBMKs suppl ied wit h such a system is Ignalina-2 in L ithuania, wh ere
this improvement  was imple mented, a fter fou r and a half years of pl anning and inst alling work,
in autumn  of 2004, mor e than 18 y ears after the Chernobyl accident [BU TCHER 2001;
NUC WEEK 39_04].  Even now, how ever, impleme ntation at Ignalina-2 is not f ully concluded
since further improvements  are required in the diversity of control rod drives, whi ch should b e
complet ed by the end of 2006.
The oth er RBMK unit where an ind ependent a nd div erse shut down system has been inst alled is
Kursk-1, a Russian fi rst-generation RBM K. Howev er, various sho rtcoming s have been
identified in c onne ction with this s ystem a t Kur sk-1. T here is no c omplet e fault sc hedule for the
system, suffi cient re liabilit y of the system software has not b een demons trated so f ar, and system
mainten ance during operation i s permitted,  greatly reducing diversity. Apart from the shut -down
system, th e safety analyses performed  for Kursk-1 by the operators has man y other deficits,
regarding missing a nalyses of se vere accidents, l ack of an analysis of systems’ reliabilit y, lack of
a discussion of sa fety culture etc. [C HOUHA  2004].  Kursk-2 is to be the next plant wh ere an
independent a nd div erse shutdown s ystem is to be inst alled.
The oth er RBMKs so far only have a very limited second ary shutdown c apability through boron
injection v ia the eme rgency core coolin g system.
There is another issu e connected to re activity problems which is still not c ompletely resolved: If
coolant is lost in the channels of the  reactor’s control and protection s ystem (CPS),  an increase
in reactivity results which the  CPS cannot co pe with. B y introduction of n eutron a bsorber
mate rial around th e tip of th e control rod, thi s effect can be halved, but no t entirely eliminated
[IAEA 1999].
   26 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

RBMK r eactors contain more zirconium  alloy in the core than an y other reactor type (about 50
% more tha n a convention al BWR).  They also co ntain a  large amount  of graphite (about 1,700
tonnes). A g raphite fire can seriously aggravate an accident situ ation; g raphite can also re act
violently with wa ter at higher temper atures, producing hydrogen. On the other hand, w ithout ai r
intrusion, the large graphite mass  will slow down co nsiderably the he ating up of th e reactor core
after cooling failure.
Failure of a single pressure tub e in an RBMK do es not n ecessarily lead to c atastrophi c
consequences, as would major failure of the reactor vessel in P WRs and BWRs. How ever, a
large number of tub es and pi pes n ecessitates a similarly large number of w elds, an d constitutes a
system th at is dif ficult to insp ect and maintain. Multipl e pressure tub e failure constitut es an
important s afety issue.
The pressure supp ression capacity of the containment  system of R BMKs has been improved so
that simultaneous r upture of up to nin e pressure tubes c an be controlled. How ever, in c ase of
flow blo ckage after a loss-of-coolant a ccident, high temper atures could b e reached, leading to
ruptures in up to 40 c hannels of th e total of about 1700 [BU TCHER 2001].  A catastrophi c
destruction of the  whol e reactor core can follow.
Since 1997, c racking occurred in the  stabilized stainless steel pipi ng of RBMK r eactors. It has
the characteristics of s tress c orrosion cracking as expe rienced by western BWR s. Ruptur e of the
pipes concerned has the pot ential to d amag e the reactor core; releases of ra dioactivity into the
atmosphe re can result. The  causes of th e cracking phenomena a re very comple x. So far, no
through wall cracks have been detected. Th ere is no c onsensus, how ever, between w estern and
Russian expe rts whether crack growth through pipe walls c an be safely exclud ed [IAEA 2002].
The reactor core of an RBMK is v ery large, with low pow er densit y. This can lead to re activity
instabilities du e to the heterogeneous distribution of xenon,  a fission produc t exhibiting high
neutron a bsorption. In addition, fu el elements  are frequently changed, whi ch means th e
configuration of fu el elements o f different bu rn-ups is varying. These factors, as well as the
positiv e void c oefficient (which ha s only been reduced by upgrading, not e liminated ), make
monitorin g and regulation of the  reactor complicated a nd cumbe rsome.
In RBMKs, s cram rods en ter the reactor from above as well as from below ( not onl y from below
as in or dinary BWR s), which can be seen as a safety advantage. Likewise, the  RBMK’s
emergency core cooling system is e quipp ed wit h a pressure accumulato r for fast core flood ing,
which is not found in o rdinary BWR s.
The containme nt of a n RB MK consists of s everal cells (for the main  components ) designed to
withst and in creased pressure, whi ch for some  cells are considerably higher than th e design
pressure of a n ordinary BWR containment.  This “cell-type” containment,  how ever, is no t total.
Between th e reactor and th e refuelling hall di rectly above  it, th ere is no hi gh-pressure barrier,
despite the uppe r cap of the working channels being a critical point in th e whol e design. The
function ing of th e containment  depends on a  pressure suppr ession system. (As has been poin ted
out a bove, this system cannot cope with the  rupture of more th an 9 p ressure tub es out of a bout
1700 ).
As in o rdinary BWR designs, there is a broad sp ectrum  of event chains in RBMK r eactors that
can lead to l arge radioactive releases. The complexi ty of th e reactor’s control system makes it
particularly vuln erable to human  error and sabotage as accident ini tiating events. On-load
refuelling opens up a dditional possibilities fo r loss -of-coolant ac cidents.
In RBMK r eactors, sp ent fuel is stored in ponds insi de th e reactor building. The  reactors are
built exclusiv ely as twin inst allations, with th e two units sha ring common systems, am ong them
the spe nt fuel pool.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 27

Radio active releases from an RBMK can be very high, as was ill ustrated by the 1986 ca tastrophe
at the Chernobyl pow er plant. I t is startling to no te that more than 18 y ears after the accident, th e
precise sequence of events is still not known, a nd exp ert opin ions di ffer wid ely.
The pressure tub es are subj ected to massive neutron-indu ced embr ittlement  and oth er ageing
effects. Tub e replacement programm es have been initiated in man y RBMKs  in th e late 1980s.
Furthermore, th e gas gap between the pressure tube a nd th e surround ing graphite closes after
approximatel y 17 y ears of pl ant op eration, leading to conditions in whi ch th e plant ca nnot b e
operated fu rther. Re-tubi ng strategies have been developed by Russ ian designers [IAEA 1999] .
All in a ll, there have been significant impr ovements  at RBMK pow er plants sin ce the Chernobyl
accident, but non e of th e pot entially hazardous f eatures dis cussed here has been complet ely
eliminated. Anoth er catastrophic accident, with comparable or even mor e severe releases than
the accident of Ap ril 26, 1986, c annot b e exclud ed.
In spite of c lear and present h azards o f the RBMK type, all sixteen RBMKs in op eration a t the
time of the Che rnobyl accident (apart from the stricken reactor) continu ed to produce electricity
for mor e than fi ve years, and onl y four have been shut down s ince, the last one at December 31,
2004. B y early 2005, el even RBMKs a re still operating in R ussia, and on e in L ithuania, in th e
European Union. Fo r some  plants, lif e extension h as even been licensed (see section C). 
Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR )
Different lines of pressurized heavy water reactors have been developed in v arious countries.
How ever, almost all PHWRs operating worldwid e tod ay belong to th e Can adian CA NDU line or
are based to some  extent on CANDU  technolo gy. This t echnolo gy has been export ed wo rldwide
   28 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards


to several Asi an countries (China, India, South  Korea and Pakis tan) as well as to R omania  and
Argentina. Its natural uranium,  heavy water cooled and moder ated, p ressure tube design has both
advantages and di sadvantages from a safety perspective, but th e possibility of uncontained
accidents involving meltin g fuel has not b een eliminated.
Due to the predominanc e of CANDUs  amon g PH WRs, this s ection wil l concentrate on t he
CANDU  type.  
As fo r the RBMK, th e pressure tub e design precludes the pos sibility of ma ssive p ressure vessel
failure, but th e accompan ying greater length, su rface area and complexity of th e primary system
pipin g results in a greater risk of l oss-of-coolant a ccidents. The capabilit y for on-load r efuelling
also introdu ces addition al means b y which loss -of-coolant c an be initi ated. The  refuelling
machin e is a lso the ma jor pathw ay for releases of ra dioactive “hot particles” – particles tha t have
broken of f the fuel or other activated metal p articles, in p articular the lon g-lived cobalt-60.
The main  pressure bearing components,  in this case the pressure tubes, are expos ed to the full
neutron flux,  with c onsequent we akening effects. There have been problems with delayed
hydride cracking as a result of d euterium- zirconium  alloy reactions. Th e amount  of blist ering
and cr acking was found  to be so s erious a t the Pickering and Bruce reactors tha t complet e tube
replaceme nt schemes  had to b e devised for all 16 r eactors at those sites in the late eighties and
early nineties. (One reactor contains 390 p ressure tub es.) Also, pressure tub e fretting corrosion
appears to be a generic flaw of the  CAND U design. This d egradation mecha nism has been
traced back to vibrations of the  pressure tubes a nd could le ad to a  loss-of-coolant accident.
Advanced tub e fretting has been dis covered in th e early nineties at the Bruce and Da rlington
reactors.
Probl ems with CAN DU pressure tub es persist. At Point  Lepreau powe r station, p remature
degradation of the  tube s resultin g from ageing was recently reported after only about 20 y ears of
commerci al operation, r equiring a costly refurbishment  program [ ENBP  2002].  At th e Ko rean
CANDU  Wols ong-1, pressure tube r eplaceme nt also might b ecome necessary before the design
lifetime (30 years) is reached [KYOUNG- SOO  2003] . Hydride cracking and fretting were
observed in th e last years at the Cernavod a-1 plant in Romania,  which on ly started op erating in
1996 [RA DU 2003].
Althou gh the large pool of relatively cool h eavy water moder ator provid es an  additional heat
sink fo r decay heat remova l, and a compar atively benign environm ent for control and safety
instrumentation, the re have been problems with un reliable neutron flux  monitor ing. The
combination  of natural uranium  and heavy water has serious n egative safety implications. The
void c oefficient o f reactivity is positiv e, so th at an y loss-of-coolant ac cident could lead to a
power excu rsion. A los s-of-coolant with sc ram failure in a  CANDU will r esult in rapid meltin g
of the fuel and po ssibly comm on mode  breach of th e containme nt. The extens ive u se of
zirconium  in the core (about th e same amount  as in a  BWR) leads to a  large zirconium- steam
reaction pot ential in case of accidents.
Due to its relatively large size, the core is “decoupl ed”, whi ch means th at neutron flux  may
significantly vary in dif ferent parts of th e core, leading to flux  oscillations. This design-inherent
characteristic make s the CA NDU reactor particularly vulnerable to los s-of-regulation ( LORA)
accidents, wit h subs equent pow er excursion. I n Sept ember 1990, a  “severe flux tilt” with l arge
power shifts in the reactor core occurred at the Pick ering-2 reactor. Plant personn el spent two
days trying to st abilize the reactor before finally shut ting it down [NAP  1997] .
The use of h eavy water as coolant an d moderator results in th e production of l arge and

Ontario foll owing a heavy water leak from a heat exch anger at Pick ering-4. Sev eral other cases
of leaks occurred in the 1990s [NAP  1997].
CANDU  designers have attempted to r espond to th e inh erent sa fety problems by emplo ying two
separate scram systems a nd generally resorting to hi gh levels of div ersity and re dundancy in the
control and sa fety systems. A p robabilistic approach to sa fety has been taken, how ever, at the
expens e of a ttention to c omm on-mode  and common-cause failures. Th e record of th e indu stry
indicates pe rsistent fa ilure in a chieving safety system reliabiliti es and ov er-reliance on th e
containme nt as the final barrier against a large release.
Two diff erent c ontainment  designs have been applied to CA NDU reactors. The  standard 600
MWe reactor (CANDU 600 ) whi ch has been marketed int ernationall y has a stand-alone
containme nt co nsisting of a concrete dome  that encloses the entire steam generating plant. The
containme nt relies on a n active spray system fo r pressure supp ression in c ombination with a n
active system for  filtered air discharge.
Ontario H ydro’s multi- unit stations h ave a comm on containment  envelope in whi ch several
reactors are connected to a  single large “vacuum building” by pressure relief du cts. Th ese
systems d epend on th e operation of v alves that no rmally keep the  reactor buil dings isol ated from
the vacuum building but ar e designed to op en w hen th e pressure increases beyond a certain point
insid e the reactor building. Of p articular concern are the possibilities fo r comm on-mode
accidents that d amage the containment  and/or the vacuum  building, whi ch is designed to
withst and a  release into the  containment  of a single reactor, but not a ccident c onditions in
several reactors at once.
In some  stations th ere is the poss ibility for loss o f primary coolant outsid e the containment,  since
components  like boilers or mainten ance cooling circuits pe netrate the massive co ntainment
structure.
The basic safety features of th e CANDU  600 h ave not d eveloped very much over the years
[WENRA 1999] . The design has not c hanged fund amentally; the safety deficiencies have
persisted into t he new century. In particular, the containme nts of the two unit s of this type at
Cernavoda  in R omania (one reactor in op eration, one und er construction) h ave the sam e
shortcoming s as older CANDU  600 c ontainments  [WENISCH  2002] .
As with oth er reactors, C ANDU  containme nts are not d esigned to withst and wo rst case
accidents, for example  hydrogen detonations.
The general trend shows op erational pr oblems  to become  more and more s evere at the existin g
CANDU  plants. At old er plants, whi ch started up in t he early 1970 s, the effects of a geing are
beginning to take their toll . Economic  pressure and th e resulting neglect of mainten ance
programmes are other import ant factors contributing to th e decline of th e CANDUs’
performance.
This d ecline was dramatic ind eed. As o f June 1990, six  reactors out of th e top te n in w orldwid e
lifetime performance were CANDU reactors, fou r of t hose from Ontario H ydro. Within six
years, load factors dropped drastically due to wh at a technical jou rnal called a “maintenance
meltdown” [ PEM 1998].  The operation of e ight of Ont ario H ydro’s CANDU  reactors wa s
suspended or  indefinitely deferred in t he late 90s ( three of t hose w ere reported “operable” by the
end of 2003 [ WNIH 2003, 2004] ). As of June  2004, t he onl y CANDUs  amon g the  top t en

Magnox and Advanced Gas-C ooled Reacto rs (AGR)
Magnox reactors were developed in Great Britain fr om early air-cooled, g raphite-moder ated
natural uranium  reactors that produced pl utonium  for the British weapons p rogramme. Magnox
plants ca n be adapted to operate for the dua l purpose of plutonium  production and electricity
generation. The  Adv anced G as-Cool ed Reactor (AGR) r epresents a  further development of the
Magnox design, with a  significantly higher operating temper ature and man y technical
modifications. B oth reactor types are designed fo r on-load re fuelling.
Magnox reactors have very low pow er densit y in th e core, leading to la rge cores and, h ence,
large facilities. In an attempt  to ov ercome  this perceived w eakness, pow er density was increased
by a factor of two in th e AGR, but it is still low c ompar ed to li ght water reactors. C arbon
dioxide  gas circulates in th e primar y circuit. Ga s circulation is mor e complex in AGRs  as the
higher temperature necessitates a special re-entrant g as flow through the graphite moder ator.
There is no zi rconium in either reactor design. Howe ver, a fire risk exists,  since a significant
mass  of graphite is located in th e core, whi ch ca n ignite after an air intr usion. This ri sk is
enhanced by the so-called “Wign er effect”, whi ch leads to a n increase in th e graphite
temper ature during the op eration al life of th e reactor. Furthermore, s mall carbonaceous particles
generated by radiolysis reduce the ignition threshold. M agnox reactors contain inflammable
magnesium  and uranium alloys in the core.
AGRs  have expe rienced problems with th e dynamics of the  gas flow th rough the core, which as
led to vib rations in th e fuel assembly stringers (clusters of fu el elements are joined to gether end-
to-end in s tringers whi ch are placed in vertical holes in th e graphite moder ator), especially when
refuelling at full r eactor power. As a  consequence, on-load refuelling at full pow er was
suspended in 1988. Be cause of economic  pressure (achieving high load factors), it w as
attempted  again in th e mid- 90s. How ever, in J anuary 1996, a n incident o ccurred at Heysham-2
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 31


AGR  when a fuel rod became stu ck in th e reactor core during on-load refuelling. The reactor
was automatic ally shut down. Anoth er attempt also failed, leading to a second shut down. A
serious accident c an result if a  fuel rod gets stuck an d the core overheats [WISE 1996].  Only
refuelling at low po wer is now und ertaken at AGRs.
In both d esigns, the reactor core is lo cated insid e a large pressure vessel. The older Magnox
reactors, with a  steel pressure vessel, have suffered from steel corrosion in the  vessel and its
internals. Thermal ageing and mate rial degradation aggravate these problems by neutron-
induced em brittlement.
Brittle failure of the  pressure vessel could l ead to tot al los s of th e primary coolant, and po ssibly
large radioactive releases. F or this an d oth er reasons, a number of Ma gnox stations have already
been shut down. Op erators claim that there would b e a leak giving adequate warning of an
impendin g problem before any rupture in t he pressure vessel. How ever, it is unlik ely that the
leak-before-break (LBB) concept is generally applicable to t he entire primary circuit. Th e
existin g leakage detection s ystems must  therefore be consid ered ins ufficient to r ule out ma jor
primary circuit r uptures. F urthermore, volume tric in-service inspection do es no t cover all critical
components  of th e primary gas circuit – p ressure vessel, st andpip es, ductwo rk and boil ers. Th eir
structural integrity therefore cannot b e guaranteed. This p articularly applies to th e refuelling
machin e, ins pection of whi ch is regularly done onl y for surface defects.
Emer gency shutdown is a ccompli shed in th ese gas-cooled reactors by rapid c ontrol rod
insertion. I f the inner core restraint s ystem fails, causing loss of co re, integrity, and th e control
rods c annot e nter, the chain reaction wil l continue. Th ere are, however, several secondary shut-
down s ystems. So me of the se are terminal  in the sense that the  reactor cannot be operated any
longer afterwards; an example  of thi s is th e water floodin g provision in th e AGR . In Magnox
reactors, a back-up bo ron b all shutdown s ystem h as been provid ed, a ctivation of whi ch is not
fail-safe.
   32 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards


Four, maybe six out of fou rteen AGRs have a reduced safety margin in th eir pressure vessel, du e
to incorrect pre-stressing of th e tendons of th e concrete pressure vessel.
For Magnox as well as AGRs,  post -trip cooling depends on ac tive systems. Th e design basis
accident scenarios assume  continued fun ctioning of boi lers and/or gas circulators. In case of
complet e loss of pow er, graphite temperature wil l increase dramatically in A GRs.
The suppo rt and sa fety systems o f both reactor types are very simple  compa red to th e complex
systems of li ght water reactors. Th ey generally fall sho rt of mode rn standards due to th eir lack of
diversity and segregation, p articularly the electrical systems. Ste am pressure in the  seconda ry
circuit is consid erably higher than gas pressure in th e primar y loops . The possibili ty of a
multiple  boiler tube leakage is a major w eakne ss in AG Rs. In this e vent, wa ter intrusion could
be follow ed by a violent g raphite-steam reaction.
Neither Magnox nor AGRs  have seconda ry containme nt. Both re actor types have a high
potential for large radioactive releases. A po ssible event c hain in a n AGR , for exam ple, is steam
intrusion in the reactor core due to multiple  boiler tube failure, follow ed by failure of th e
pressure vessel. In a Magnox reactor, air int rusion after pressure vessel failure, an d subs equent
graphite ignition, could lead to a  large release.
All in a ll, the rather ancient M agnox reactor line must  be regarded as particularly hazardous du e
to man y safety deficiencies. This reactor type is being phased out. B ut on ly half of t he 24
Magnox units in G reat Britain h ave been shut down b y 2004, f our mor e are to follow  in 2005,
and th e reminde r will be shut down a s late as 2010 [ WNIH 2004 ; NUCWEEK 41_04].
Due to increasingly severe ageing problems,  the operating periods of the  AGR s also might b e
limited.  There are indication s that their planne d lifetime of 35 y ears may not b e achievable, and
that plans for lif e extensi ons beyond that point w ere wildl y over-ambiti ous.  A ma jor pr oblem
that dis covered late in 2004: A n ew type of graphite cracking in the  reactor that might en danger
the integrity of th e core. This f ailure mec hanism had not b een anticipated by analytical methods
applied before in s afety analyses. It can have adverse consequences fo r the movement  of control
rod, the  exch ange of fu el an d the flow of t he coolant g as [NUC WEEK 50_04].
There are also ag eing problems in connection w ith the boi ler integrity at several AGR  stations
[NUCWEEK 32_04] . It is we ll poss ible that the era of th e British g as-cooled reactor lines will
be over within the next 10 y ears.
Sodium-cooled Fast Breeder Reactors (SFR )
Fast reactor designs with sodium  cooling have been und er development from the very beginning
of nu clear pow er in the  late 1940 s. Indeed, for several decades they were heralded as the solution
to all energy problems since, in th eory, breeder reactors permit the complete use of n atural
uranium  as nuc lear fuel by systemati cally breeding fissile pluton ium-239 out of non -fissile
uranium- 238. T hus, uranium  reserves would th eoretically be extended by about a  factor of 100.
On th e oth er hand, p roliferation p roblems of this re actor types are particularly severe, since large
amounts  of weapon s-grade pluton ium would b e produc ed, separated and us ed fo r fuel
production. 
The reactor is typically arranged into the  fission zone ( 20-30 %  PuO2 and UO2) and t he
surround ing breeding zone (“ blanke t”, UO2), and th is arrangement ha s to b e as compa ct as
possibl e to pr eclude high neutron leakage out of th e core. A c oolant with a  high heat capacity
and low n eutron ab sorption is r equired fo r this d esign, hence the  selection of sodium.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 33

How ever, the core arrangement, in c onnection w ith the liquid  sodium  as coolant, exhibi ts some
serious risk features. The sodium void coefficient is positiv e. As most  cores are not in th eir
maxi mum reactivity configuration, v ariations in c ore geometry can lead to hi gher reactivity.
Rapid a nd un controllable nuclear pow er excursions (s o-called Bethe-Tait ac cidents) are thus
possibl e, wi th subseque nt meltdown and vaporization of th e fuel – fo r example if the  coolant
pumps  shut do wn and th e reactor fails to s cram.
The large number o f events that might tr igger pow er excursions a lso in cludes abs orber element
ejection, pr opagation o f local coolant blockages, geometrical instabilities due to e arthquake or
failure of th e core-hold p late, failure of th e grid plate, and fission g as or vaporized oil entering
the core. The dangerous reactivity characteristics are particularly pronoun ced in l arge reactors.
The catastrophi c radiological consequences that c ould r esult f rom a release of fis sion products
would b e aggravated by the release of v aporized plutonium.
Other accidents are made pos sible by the strong chemical r eactivity of sodium  with a ir and
water. Sodium fires, wi th the danger of subsequ ent c ommon-mode failures, can be initiated b y
sodium  leaks f rom either the primary or the second ary circuit. I f water shoul d find its w ay into a
sodium  circuit, th e result woul d be an explosion,  possibl y, breaching the containment,  and a
major r elease of r adioactivity. Steam generator tubes are especially vuln erable to r upture.
The disadvantages of sodi um coolant we re drastically illust rated in D ecember 1995 whe n 700 k g
of molten  sodium  leaked from the second ary circuit of t he Ja panese breeder Monju.  A fire
creating exten sive de struction r esulted.

Coolant t emper atures in th e primar y circuit can considerably exceed 500° C.  This c an lead to
problems of th ermal embri ttlement and the rmally indu ced stresses. Cor rosion c onstitu tes another
risk factor. It is impossi ble to build a  containment  capable of c oping with the  energy release
from Bethe-Tait accidents, as no re liable upp er bounds h ave yet been es tablished. E ven if th ese
were determined,  containme nt designs would h ave to be  extremely strong and mas sively
expensiv e. Lack of an adequate containment was on e of th e main safety concerns a bout the
German SNR-300 f ast reactor, whi ch ne ver obtained th e required op erating license.
The suppo rt and sa fety systems in f ast reactors are generally less complex than in li ght water
reactors. Du e to the reactor’s high sus ceptibility to rapid pow er excu rsions , its sc ram system is
particularly importan t. Even thoug h control rod inj ection is suppo rted by accelerators and
gravity, shut -down may be impos sible in t ime in th e event of very rapid re activity increases,
accompani ed by sodium  boiling and leading to un controllable, “run-away” conditions in the
reactor.
Other fast reactor designs will be discussed in s ection B .2.

B.1 Overview of New Reactors – “Generation III”
Introduction
Among c ommerci al nu clear pow er plant types, four generations o f reactors are commonly
distin guished. Ge neration I  were prototype commercial reactors developed in the 1950s a nd
1960s. Most, but not a ll of th em have already been decommissioned; the Magnox plants some  of
which ar e still op erating in G reat Britain tod ay belong to G eneration I.
The vast majority of the reactors in c omm ercial op eration wo rldwid e tod ay belong to G eneration
II (PW R, VVER,  BWR,  RBMK, CANDU, AGR).
Generation I II are the so-called “A dvanced Reactors”, three of whi ch are already in op eration in
Japan, a nd more a re under construction or planned. A bout 20 dif ferent d esigns fo r Generation III
reactors are reported to b e unde r development [IAEA 2004; W NO 2004 a]. Most of th em are
“evolutionary” designs th at have been developed from Generation I I reactor types with some
modifications, but without int roducing drastic changes. Some of th em represent mor e innovativ e
approaches. G eneration I V reactors are described as radically different designs. Partially, they
have closed fu el cycle.
According to th e World  Nuclear Association, r eactors of G eneration III are characterized by the
followin g point s [WNO 2004b] :
•a standardised design for  each type to expedit e licensing, reduce capital cost and reduce
construction time, 
•a simpler an d more rugged design, makin g them easier to op erate and less vuln erable to
operation al up sets, 
•higher availability and lon ger operating life - typically 60 y ears, 
•reduced pos sibility of core me lt accidents, 
•minimal effect on th e environment,  
•higher burn-up to r educe fuel use and th e amount of waste, 
•burnable absorbers ("poisons ") to extend fu el life. 
It is quit e clear that tho se goals mainl y are directed tow ards better economics . Their addressing
higher safety remains r ather vague.
The distin ction be tween G eneration I II and G eneration I V is not a lways clear-cut. Ge neration I II
is generally considered to also inc lude some  reactor types which inc orporate more th an
evolution ary innov ations; th e best known among  those  is the Pebbl e Bed Modular Re actor
(PBMR), whi ch is some times classified as “Generation III+”.
Generations I II and IV are more c learly separated, how ever, by their respective time  horizons .
While some reactors of Ge neration I II are already operating, and demonstration p lants for
several concepts of this g eneration ar e to be operation al by about 2010, G eneration IV reactors
will not, e ven from the m ost optimistic  advocates be operational before 2020, with oth ers
suggestion 2045, if a t all.
In this s ection, two exam ples for Generation III reactors will b e presented and discussed with
their main safety deficits a nd hazards. F or both of th em, concrete projects have already been
started. T hey illust rate the variety of this g eneration: Th e European Pressurized Water Re actor
(EPR)  is not f ar rem oved f rom the French and G erman  PWRs from which it was developed; it is
a light-water cooled and moder ated type with large capacity (1,600 MWe).  The Pebbl e Bed
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 39

Modul ar Reactor (PBMR), on the  other hand, is a n offspring of earlier high-tempe rature reactors
significantly developed further; it is helium cooled and graphite moder ated and to b e buil t in
small  modules (110 – 125 M We).
Furthermore, exam ples for oth er Generation I II reactors in op eration, und er construction or
planned wo rldwide will b e given.
The European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR )
The EPR  is a pressurized w ater reactor that represents a development  from the French N4 a nd
the German K ONV OI reactor line, the latest G eneration I I reactors whi ch w ent taken into
operation in thos e countries. [HA INZ 2004]
The goals stated for  EPR developme nt are to impr ove the safety level of th e reactor (in
particular, reduce the probability of a severe accident by a factor of t en), achieve miti gation of
severe accidents b y restricting their consequences to the  plant itself, a nd to reduce costs.
Compared to its p redecessors, how ever, the EPR  displays several modif ications whi ch constitute
a reduction of sa fety margins: T he volume  of the reactor buildin g has be en reduced by
simplif ying the layout of th e eme rgency core coolin g system, and by usin g the results of n ew
calculations w hich p redict less hydrogen development  during an accident. F urthermore, the
thermal outpu t of th e plant w as increased b y 15 %  relative to th e N4 by increasing core outlet
temper ature, letting the ma in coolant pum ps run at higher capacity and modif ying the steam
generators.
In some  cases, the EPR actually has fewer redund ant trains in safety systems than th e KONVO I
plant; for  exam ple, its eme rgency core cooling system has on ly 4 accumulators (pressure tanks)
whereas the KONVO I plants’ has 8 su ch tanks.
Several oth er modifications a re hailed as subs tantial safety improvements:
•The incontainment  refuelling water storage tank (IRWST) is lo cated at the bottom of the
reactor buildin g and combines coolant sto rage and sump function. Du ring a loss-of-
coolant ac cident, switchov er from safety injection to sum p recirculation is thu s avoided.
In this w ay, som e sources of failures are avoided. T he ov erall safety gain, howe ver,
appears rather small.
•The core catcher has the func tion to cont rol a core melt  accident. In the EPR , the molten
core collects in the reactor cavity below th e pressure vessel. After meltin g through a
bulkh ead, it then passes through an outlet condui t and sp reads in sp ecifically designed
area. By means o f passive features, the  water of the IRWST  is the n released for  floodin g
and co oling the core melt  in th is area. The floor of th e spreading area is provid ed with a
coolin g system to a void excessiv e tempe ratures in th e structural concrete of th e reactor
buildin g.  However, even before the melt  reaches the core catcher, a violent st eam
explosion  could t ake place in th e reactor pressure vessel, pos sibly leading to containment
failure. Furthermore, s team explos ions can also occur later in th e course of th e accident,
when the m elt in the spreading area comes  into contact with IRWST  water. Even if this
does no t happen, it is no t clear that effective coolin g of th e spread molten  core will b e
possibl e. A solid l ayer on th e surface of th e melt  could fo rm, preventin g heat removal,
and th e core could eat into t he concrete below th e spreading area.
•The containme nt heat remova l system is taken from the N4 d esign. Its purpose is to
lower containment  pressure and thus , avoid ov erpressure failure. Thi s system mus t
remain op erable over a long period of t ime to ensure coolin g. No inf ormation  on its
failure probabilit y is available.

•Hydrogen recombiners    serve to r educe hydrogen conc entration in th e containment  by
passiv e, catalytic processes. Such recombiners are already emplo yed in many PWRs
worldwid e. The y probably are effective in r educing the hazard of h ydrogen detonations,
but c annot complet ely exclude it.
•The EPR  is equipp ed with a n instrumentation a nd co ntrol system on a di gital basis. The
use of such a  system is ve ry demandin g on the  developer and it is very difficult to verify
its correct implem entati on.  A similar s ystem wa s inst alled at the German  PWR Neckar-1
in 2000; th e system fa iled and fo r a while the ability for fast reactor shut down (scram)
was blo cked.  A di gital ins trumentation a nd control s ystem h as been in stalled at the UK
PWR Sizewell B  from the beginning; in April 1998, it l ed to a  severe degradation o f the
reactor protection s ystem.
The protection of th e plant a gainst airplane crash is e quivalent to th at of th e German K ONVOI
plants an d hence does no t reach a new, higher safety level.
In spite of the  changes being envisaged, the EPR appears to be plagued by a problem which is
widespread am ong PWRs of G eneration I I, and still not full y resolved fo r thos e (see section A ):
According to th e Finnis h regulatory authority, sum p strainer clogging is an  issue with t he EPR,
in spit e of c laims  by French expe rts that thi s problem is not r elevant du e to design diff erences
compar ed to wit h existing reactors. The issue has been ide ntified by the Finnish authority man y
years ago, but still appears to be  a big challenge for the EPR [NU CWEEK  11_04].
All in a ll, there is no g uarantee tha t the safety level of the  EPR does indeed represent a
significant improve ment compa red to N4 a nd K ONVO I; in particular, the reduction of th e
expe cted core melt  probability by a factor of t en is not p roven. F urthermore, th ere are serious
doubts a s to wh ether the mitig ation a nd control of a core melt  accident with th e “core catcher”
concept will actually work as envisaged.
The Pebble Bed M odular Reac tor (PBMR)
The PB MR is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR). Th e HTGR  line has been pu rsued
until th e late 80s in se veral co untries; how ever, only protot ype plants w ere ever operated, all of
which we re decommissioned after about twelve years of op eration at most (Peach Bo ttom 1 an d
Fort St. Vrain, USA,  in 1974 a nd 1989; W infrith (UK) in 1976, H amm-Uentrop, G ermany, in
1988 ) [WNIH 2004].
Unlik e light water reactors that us e water and st eam, the PBMR design uses pressurize d helium
heated in th e reactor core to d rive a series of tu rbines that attach to a n electrical generator. The
helium  is cycled to a recuperator to b e cooled down b y a seconda ry helium circuit and returned
to cool th e reactor. Helium temper ature at the core outlet is ab out 900° C , at a pressure of 69 b ar.
The secondary helium circuit i s cooled by water [ESKOM 2005].
Designers claim there are no a ccident scenarios that would r esult in s ignificant fu el damage and
catastrophi c release of r adioactivity. These claims  rely on th e heat resistant qu ality and int egrity
of the tennis b all-sized graphite fuel assemblies or "pebbles," 400,000 of whi ch are continuous ly
fed from a fuel silo th rough the reactor to ke ep th e reactor core. Each sph erical fue l element  has
an inn er graphite core embedd ed wit h thou sands of sm aller fuel p articles of enriched uranium
(up to 10 % ), encapsulated in m ulti-layers of non -porous hardened carbon. Th e slow c irculation
of fu el thr ough the reactor provid es fo r a small core size th at mini mizes excess core reactivity
and low ers pow er densit y, all of whi ch is cr edited to s afety. How ever, so m uch credit is given to
the integrity and qu ality control of th e coated fu el pebbles to re tain the radioactivity that no
containme nt buildin g is planned fo r the PB MR design. Wh ile the elimination  of the  containment
buildin g provides a  significant cost savings for the utilit y – perhaps m aking th e design
economically feasibl e – th e trade-off is publi c health and safety [GU NTER 2001].
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 41

According to th e prospectiv e PBMR  operator Eskom , the reactor is “walk-away-safe”. This is
meant to impl y that even should the plant p ersonne l leave the site, the reactor would no t get into
a critical condition. It is claime d that fuel temper ature will peak at 1600° C  in any case, whereas
fuel damag e will not b egin below 2000° C  [ESKO M 2005] .
How ever, the temper ature limit of 1600° C  is not g uaranteed in re ality. It depends on s uccessful
reactor scram as well as  on th e fun ctionin g of the  passiv e cooling systems ( which can be
impeded, fo r example,  by pipe breaks a nd leaks in c oolers). Furthermore, fiss ion pr oduct
releases from the fuel elements  already begin at temperatures just a bove 1600° C.  In this
context, it is i rrelevant th at severe fuel damage or meltin g onl y occurs above 2000°C . Massive
radioactive releases can take place well below thi s temper ature.
While it is true that core heating proceeds rather slowl y after cooling failure, thi s thermal inertia
causes its ow n problems:  By the use of graphite as moder ator and structural mate rial. If air
enters the primar y helium circuit, a  severe accident wit h graphite fire, leading to catastrophic
radioactive releases, can be the consequence. Also, in c ase of w ater ingress through the
second ary circuit, f or example  due to l eakages in th e heat excha ngers, violent graphite-steam-
reactions c an occur. Burning of graphite is probably the most  risk si gnificant a ccident scenario
possibl e for the PBMR [HAH N 1988].
Other “Generation III” Reactor Designs
Many different c oncepts b earing the label “Generation I II” are in various stages of development
and implementation  today. A complete l isting will not b e attempted here. In the following, the
most  import ant examples  as mentioned by the World  Nuclear Association [WNO  2004b]  and
the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA 2004]  will b e provid ed. Usua lly, the concepts
are classifi ed int o two ca tegories: Large designs – a bove 700 MWe ; small  and medium  designs –
below 700 MWe.
Pressurized W ater Reactors :
The principal large designs are APWR (Mitsubishi/ Westinghous e), AP WR+ (Mitsubishi ), EPR
(Framatome ANP), AP-1000 ( Westinghou se), KSNP+  and APR- 1400 ( Korean Industry) and the
CNP- 1000 ( China Nation al Nu clear Corpo ration ).
Regarding VVERs,  an advanced VVER-1000 h as been developed by Atomenergoproject and
Gidropress in Rus sia.
The main  small- a nd mediu m-size advanced PWR designs ar e the AP-600 (Westin ghous e) and
the VVER-640 ( Atomen ergoproject and Gid ropress).
Boiling W ater Reactors:
The main  large concepts are the ABWR and th e ABWR- II (Hitachi, Toshiby, General Electric),
the BWR  90+ (Wes tinghous e Atom  of Sweden), the SWR-1000 ( Framatome  ANP) a nd th e
ESBW R of G eneral Electric.
The HSB WR and H ABWR (Hitachi) are small- and medium- sized ad vanced BWR  concepts.
Three ABWRs are already operating in Ja pan: Two a t Kashiw azaki -Kariwa since 1996, a  third
started op erating in 2004. 
Heavy Water Reactors:
The ACR- 700 is a n evolut ionary CANDU  design (Atomic Energy of Cana da Limited). 
   42 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

India is developi ng the AH WR (Advanced H eavy-Water Re actor), a heavy water moder ated,
boilin g light water cooled evolution ary design.
Gas-cooled Reactors :
Apart from the PB MR (ESKOM/ BNFL), a small gas turbine modular h elium  reactor (GT-MHR )
is being developed in a n internation al effort; th is reactor is d iscussed in s ection B .2.
Fast Br eeder Re actors :
No e volutiona ry breeder type is being developed. Sev eral fast reactors are amon g the concepts
under consid eration fo r Generation I V.
During the last years, a “revival” of small  nuclear pow er reactors is c laimed  to occur by nuclear
promote rs. The main  driving force is th e desire to r educe capital costs and to p rovide pow er
away from main grid systems. So me of the concepts d eveloped w ith this a im could also b e
classified as Generation III – for example  the LWR designs CAREM (Argentina) and SMART
(South Ko rea) [WNO 2005] .
Conclusion
Generation I II is characterized b y a multitude of di fferent d esigns on th e one hand, an d very few
plants al ready under operation on the  other. Indeed, of about 20 co ncepts wo rldwide, only one
has so f ar reached the stage of operating pow er plants ( three ABWRs in Japan).
It is obvious th at the  large num ber of Ge neration I II concepts does not r epresent a  correspondin g
number of r eally new reactor types. The  effort of d evelopin g so man y genuinely new reactor
lines is disproportionate to th e limited  number of c oncrete projects with any chance of
realisation. I ndeed, the EPR is typical for man y Generation III types in th at it c onstitutes, as
point ed out a bove, simpl y a slightly modified  version of c urrent reactor designs (in this c ase,
French N4 a nd G erman Konvoi ), wit h som e improvements,  but a lso with reduction of sa fety
margins and fewer redund ancies fo r some safety systems.
The same holds, fo r example,  for the Korean KSNP+  which simply is th e latest KSNP
(Generation I I) plant wit h optimisation  and simpli fication  of some features, some  improvement
in monitorin g systems and some  changes regarding building mate rials and co nstruction concepts
to save time  and costs [ JAE YOUNG YANG 2003]  – hardly a new reactor generation.
Atomic  Energy of Canada’s ACR-700 c ombines features from current U.S.  light water reactors
with CANDU  technolo gy; a combination  of w ell-know n technol ogy primari ly aiming not a t
improved s afety, but a t better economics  (for example,  by requiring a smaller h eavy water
inventory, and ext ending fuel life) [FABIAN 2004] .
Other Generation I II concepts are still in ra ther early phases of impleme ntation and appear as
showpi eces to b e presented to the  public and/or playground for und er-emplo yed reactor experts,
rather than as serious c oncepts with c hances of c ommerci al implementation.
The U.S.  AP-1000, fo r example,  shows some  more innov ative characteristics than th e EPR does
or other purely evolut ionary types. It is hailed as poss essing passive safety features and really to
belong to Generation I II+; its safety systems, how ever, it actually rely on v alves as well as on
active heating, ventilation and coolin g units. The AP-1000 is s till some  way away from being
built. Th e U.S .NRC’s  design application p rocess is in a n advanced stage, but no t yet completed,
but expe cted by the end of 2005 [ PAU LSON 2002; NE I 2004].  (Other Generation I II concepts
are still in th e pre-application r eview ph ase in th e U.S ., namel y, ESBWR, ACR-700, S WR-1000
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 43

and PBMR – along with t wo Generation IV concepts ( GT-MHR and IRIS, see section B .2)
[NRC 2005].
The French/German SWR-1000 B WR concept is also characterized b y a mixture of p assive and
active safety features, as well as design simplifications aiming at lowe r costs [KTG  1998] . It is
probably even further removed f rom practical realisation th an is AP -1000 a nd w as developed in
the 1990 s mostl y to keep G erman reactor expe rts busy and the ir know -how a live.
The PB MR is a special case with in Generation III – being an evolutionary development  from a
reactor line which was int ended to b e part of Ge neration I I, but n ever really made it into this
generation. The  PBMR still displays the main  hazardous f eatures of its fo rerunners, the
prototype HTGRs.
All in a ll, “Generation I II” appears as a heterogeneous c ollection of dif ferent reactor concepts.
Some are barely evolved from the current Ge neration I I, with modifications a iming p rimar ily at
better economics,  yet bearing the label of being safer than current reactors in th e hop e of
improvin g publ ic acceptance. Others are mos tly theoretical concepts so fa r, with a  mixture of
innov ative and convention al features, whi ch are being used to underpin th e promis e of a safe and
bright nu clear future – whi le also not fo rgetting about simpli fication and co st-cutting.

B.2 Generation IV 
Introduction
The U.S.  Department of Ene rgy (DoE) launched the  “Generation IV International Fo rum” (GIF)
in 2000. Tod ay, ten mem ber co untries are participating in thi s initiative (Argentina, Brazil,
Canada, France, Japan, Republi c of Ko rea, South  Africa, Switzerland, U.K ., U SA), as well as
EURATOM.  Their goal is to develop innov ative nuclear systems (reactors and fuel cycles) likely
to reach technical maturity by about 2030, bu t many suggest that this is op timistic. These
Generation I V reactors are expected to b e highly economical, in corporate enhanced safety,
produce minima l amounts  of waste, an d be impervious to p roliferation. Last but not le ast,
Generation I V systems should address these issues in a  manne r that pr omotes  greater publi c
acceptance.
Goals for  Generation I V are defined in four  broad areas:
•Sustain ability 
•Economics
•Safety and reliability
•Prolif eration resistance and ph ysical protection. 
Groups of int ernational expe rts from indust ry, universities and nation al laboratories were
organized to und ertake the identifi cation and evaluation of candidate systems, a nd to d efine
research and development  (R&D) activities to suppo rt them.
Some 100 dif ferent reactor designs were identified as candidates and evaluated. Th ese designs
ranged from concepts that really belonged to G eneration I II+ to a few th at were radically
different from all known t echnolo gies. At th e end of th e process, six concepts w ere
recommended  for further development (see below ). The  GIF noted th at some  of th e concepts
might ultimatel y not b e viable or might not a chieve comm ercial deployment. 
A Roadmap  describes the R&D r equired to develop e ach of th e six selected Ge neration I V
systems a s well as  the approxim ate time  and cost fo r completion.  Many of the technolo gical
gaps are common to mor e than on e system a nd the Roadm ap identi fies several areas whe re
crosscutting R&D wi ll be required. The necessary R&D will be very expens ive an d no sin gle
country has the necessary facilities and expe rtise to carry it ou t alone, hence the need fo r
international collaboration [ DOE 2002] .
The Generation I V program also establish ed a separate effort to e valuate nuclear pow er plant
designs th at migh t be deployed as commerci al op erating units b y 2010. L ight water and gas-
cooled systems are being consid ered.
To fu rther encourage and strengthen research and development  for Generation IV reactors, th e
United Stat es, Canada, France, Japan a nd th e U.K . signed th e International Forum Framework
Agreeme nt on F ebruary 28, 2005 in Washington. Spe cial emphas is appears to li e in d evelopi ng
systems fo r the generation o f hydrogen as well as electricity [NNF  2005 a; ANDERSON  2005].
In 2001, th e IAEA has initiated a similar initi ative, th e International Projects on I nnovative
Nuclear Reactors an d Fuel Cycles (INPRO ). INPRO is lik ely to focus on mor e than one system
dependin g on regional needs. I t is fund ed through the IAEA budget. As of Nov ember 2004, 21
countries or entities4 have become  membe rs of INPRO. G IF and INPRO h ave agreed to
4 Argentina, A rmenia, Brazil,  Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Czech Repub lic, France, Ge rmany, India, Indonesia,
Republic  of Korea,  Pakistan, Russian Fed eration, Sout h Africa, Spain, S witzerland,  Netherlands, Tu rkey and the
   46 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

formalize  cooperation at the technical level. (T he U.S.  has been reluctant to p articipate in
INPRO because it was  seen as a Russian-inspi red initi ative [NUCWEEK 14_02].)
Concepts Selected for Generation IV
As point ed out ab ove, six concepts we re selected for  further developme nt in the framework of
GIF. They are briefly discussed in th e followin g.
GFR – Gas -Cooled Fast Re actor System:
The GFR system is a helium-cooled reactor with f ast-neutron s pectrum and closed fu el cycle. It
is primar ily envisioned for electricity production and actinide ma nagement. T he G FR is not
intended fo r hydrogen production.
The reference reactor (288 M We) i s operating with an outlet temper ature of 850°C,  using a
direct cycle gas turbine. The GF R reference assumes  an integrated, on -site spent fuel treatment
and re-fabrication pl ant, but th e viability of the  planned technolo gy has yet to be demonstrat ed.
Fuel cycle technolo gy is the m ost compreh ensive technolo gy gap of the  GFR. 
The viability has to b e demonstrat ed al so in th e area of safety, including decay heat removal
systems, fu el forms and core design. Core configurations a re being considered bas ed on pin - or
plate-based fu el assemblies or prisma tic blo cks. 
It is hop ed th at the  GFR may benefit f rom development  of th e HTGR  technology (which is also
beset wi th many problems; see discussion of VHTR  below ) as well as from development  of
innov ative fuel and very-high-temper ature mate rials fo r the VHTR.  
In spite of la rge technology gaps, according to G IF, the G FR system is top -ranked in
sustainability because of its cl osed fuel cycle and exc ellent p erformanc e in a ctinide
mana gement. It is ra ted good in s afety, economics,  as well as proliferation resistance and
physical protection. The  GFR is estimated to be deployable by 2025 [DOE 2002].
Several GIF members have a specific interest for a sequenced development  of gas-cooled
system: Th e first step of th e ´Gas Technol ogy Path` aims to develop a  modular H TGR, the
second st ep would b e the VHTR,  and th e third step the  GFR [CARRÈ  2004] . The gas-cooled
systems VHTR  and G FR are seen as the top p riorities in Eu rope and the USA.  
LFR – Lead -Cooled Fast R eactor S ystem:
LFR systems are reactors cooled by liquid metal ( lead or lead/bismuth) with a  fast-neutron
spectrum and closed fu el cycle system. A full a ctinide recycle fuel cycle with central or regional
facilities is envisaged. A wid e range of unit sizes is pl anned, from ´batteries` of 50–150 M We,
and modular units of 300 -400 MW e to large single plants o f 1200 MWe . The LFR battery option
is a small factory-built tu rnkey plant wit h very long core life (1 0 to 30 y ears). It is designed for
small  grids, and fo r developin g countries that ma y not wi sh to deploy a fuel cycle infrastructure.
Among th e LFR concepts, this battery option is regarded as the best, concerning fulfilment of
Generation I V goals. How ever, it also h as the largest research needs and lon gest developme nt
time.  
The LFR is cooled by natural convection wit h a reactor outl et coolant temper ature of 550° C.  It
is envisaged to reach a reactor outl et coolant temperature of 800°C . The fuel is metal- or nitride-
based [DOE 2002] . Expe rience with the technology is restricted to seven Russian A lpha c lass
submarin es, whi ch stopp ed ope ration in 1995, a nd on th e advanced liquid- metal fast breeder
reactor (ALMR), the design of whi ch w as wi thdrawn f rom NRC  review at an early stage
[WANO 2004b].  
Europ ean Commission
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 47

Important L FR technolo gy gaps are in th e areas of s ystem fu els and ma terials, w ith some gaps
remainin g for the 550 ºC options, a nd large gaps for the 750–800 ºC opt ion (only the higher
temper ature makes t he produc tion of h ydrogen possible), includin g: nitride fuels developme nt,
high-temperature structural mate rials and environmental is sues with l ead. Nit ride fuel is clearly
required for the higher-tempe rature option. I t is estimated that 10–15 y ears will be necessary to
qualify any new fu el. Th erefore, the nearer-term options fo cus is on e lectricity production, a nd
hydrogen produc tion is envisaged for the  longer-term options [ DOE 2002].  
Althou gh Russia, wh ere almost  all the experience LFRs is c oncentrated, w as not a  part of G IF,
this d esign corresponds with Rus sia's BREST reactor [NEI 2002 a]. (BREST  is a fast neutron
reactor, of 300 MWe  with lead as the primary coolant. A pi lot unit is b eing built at Beloyarsk
[WANO 2004b].)  Among t he G IF members,  only Switzer land has a major interest in th e
developme nt of L FR. The U.S.  has initiat ed design explor ations. Not eworthy amon g them is th e
Small Secure Transportable Aut onom ous Reactor (SSTAR).
The LFR system is top -ranked in sust ainability because a closed fu el cycle is aimed  at, and in
proliferation resistance and ph ysical protection be cause it emplo ys a long-life core. It is ra ted
good in sa fety and economics . The LFR system is estimated to be deployable by 2025
[DOE 2002].
MSR – M olten Salt Reactor S ystem:
The MSR  system is b ased on a  thermal neutron sp ectrum and a closed fu el cycle. The uranium
fuel is disso lved in th e sodium  fluoride salt coolant th at circulates through graphite core
channe ls. The heat, directly generated in the molten  salt, is tr ansferred to a  second ary coolant
system, a nd th en through a tertiary heat excha nger to th e pow er conversion system. I t is
primarily envision ed fo r electricity production a nd w aste burn-down. The reference plant h as a
power level of 1,000 M We. Coolant tempe rature is 700°C  at very low p ressure. The  temperature
margin to the  salt boi ling temperature (1400°C) is l arge. 
Since the fuel is a liqui d, it could b e cleansed of fission p roduct impuri ties without t he need to
shut down th e reactor. Fission pr oducts are removed c ontinuous ly, whil e plutonium  and oth er
actinides can be added along with U-238. Be cause of the liqui d fuel, th ere is no n eed fo r fuel
fabrication. Th e MSRs  have a low inv entory of fi ssile mate rials compar ed wit h other reactors.
How ever, one  of the major d rawbacks of the technolo gy is th e highly corrosive nature of th e
salts. 
During the 1960 s the USA  developed the  molt en salt breeder reactor as the primar y back-up
option fo r the convention al fast breeder reactor (cooled by liquid metal ). A small  prototype (8
MWth),  the Mol ten Salt Re actor Experiment (MSR E), was operated for on ly four years. The
next project planned, the Molt en Salt B reeder Reactor (MSBR), was never built. Th e present
work rests only on th ese projects. Detailed designs of a  MSR  have not been produced sin ce the
1970s [FORSBE RG 2002].  
There are man y technolo gy gaps, for example:  At the high tempe ratures in an MSR, the tritium
can diffuse th rough the heat exch angers into the second ary system. T ritium  control technolo gies
need to b e developed. Non -proliferation was not a  concern whe n the  MSR technolo gy was first
developed. R esearch is required to d etermine if design changes are required. No work was don e
to convert the wastes into acceptable forms  for disposal. Ne vertheless, according to G IF, the
MSR  system is top-ranked in sustainability because of it s closed fue l cycle and exce llent
performance in w aste burn-down. It is ra ted good in s afety, and in p roliferation resistance and
physical protection, a nd it i s rated neutral in e conomics  because of i ts large numbe r of
subsystems. Th e MSR  is estimated to b e deployable by 2025 [DOE 2002].
   48 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

The GIF selected th e MSR as the m ost innov ative non-classical concept. Of a ll six reactor
systems, MSR  requires the highest costs for development  (1000 million  US$ ). All i n all, the
interest of the  GIF mem ber st ates in the MSR is rather low. Th e high developme nt costs and th e
required time  frame could e liminat e the M SR system from Generation I V altogether
[NUCWEEK 02_05] .
SCWR – Sup ercritical-Water-Cooled R eactor S ystem:
The SC WRs are high-temper ature, high-pressure water-cooled reactors that op erate above the
thermod ynamic critical point of w ater (i.e. at pressures and te mper atures at whi ch th ere is no
difference between liqui d and vapor phase). Th e reference plant h as a 1700 M We power level,
an operating pressure of 25 MPa, a nd a reactor outl et temper ature of 550°C.  Fuel is uranium
oxide.  Passi ve safety features similar to those of th e simplified boiling water reactor (SBW R)
are incorporated. SCW Rs could b e designed as  thermal or as fast-spectrum reactors, but c urrent
worldwid e efforts fo cus on th e thermal design.
The thermal efficiency of a SCWR can approach 44%, compar ed to 33–35 % fo r LWRs.  Because
no change of ph ase occurs in th e core and th e system u tilizes a direct cycle (like the BWR),
steam separators, dryers, pressurizes a nd recirculation pumps  are not r equired, resultin g in a
considerably simpler a nd mor e compa ct system th an tradition al light-water reactors (LWR).
SCWRs are expe cted to b e more e conomical th an LWRs , due to pl ant simplification a nd hi gh
thermal efficiency.  The  Gov ernments of Ja pan, the U.S.  and Canada are developin g the SC WR.
There have been no p rototypes built so f ar.
The technol ogy for the SC WR is based on th e existin g LWRs  and sup ercritical-water-cooled
fossil -fired powe r plants. Howev er, there are important SC WR technol ogy gaps in the  areas of:
mate rials and structures, includin g corrosion and st ress c orrosion c racking (SCC),  safety and
plant d esign. Onl y few data exist  on th e behaviou r of materials in SCW R under irradiation a nd
in the temper ature and pressure ranges of int erest. At p resent, no c andid ate alloy has been
confirmed for use as the cladding or structural material. Th e ma in feasibility issues are the
developme nt of su itable in-core mat erials and th e demonstr ation of ad equate safety and st ability.
The SC WR system is p rimar ily envisioned for electricity production, with a n opt ion fo r actinide
mana gement. According to G IF, the SCW R system is highly ranked in e conomics  because of th e
high thermal efficiency and pl ant simplification. Th e SC WR is rated good in s afety, and in
proliferation resistance and ph ysical protection, a nd neutral in sust ainability because of its op en
fuel cycle. (If the fast-spectrum option c an be developed, th e SC WR system will b e ranked hi gh
in sust ainability.) The SC WR system is es timated to b e deployable by 2025 ( with development
cost of 870 million  US$ ) [DOE 2002].  
Almost  all GIF members  display a high interest in th e development  of th e SC WR – almost  as
high as for the gas-cooled reactors.
SFR – Sodium -Cooled Fast R eactor System:
The SFR system c onsists of a  fast-neutron r eactor and a closed fu el cycle system. Th ere are two
major options: On e is a  medium size ( 150 to 500 M We) re actor with metal a lloy fuel, suppor ted
by a fuel c ycle based on p yrometallurgical reprocessin g in collocated facilities. Th e second is a
medium  to large (500 to 1,500 MW e) reactor with M OX fuel, suppo rted by a fuel cycle based
upon a dvanced aqueous r eprocessin g at a centralized lo cation se rving a number of r eactors. Th e
primary coolant system c an either be arranged in a pool l ayout or in a  compact loop l ayout. The
outlet temper ature is approxim ately 550 °C  [DOE  2002 ; LINEBERRY 2002] . 
According to G IF, the SF R has the broadest development base of a ll the Generation I V concepts.
The existin g know -how, ho wever, is b ased mainl y on ol d reactors, whi ch have already been
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 49

shutdown fo r various re asons ( safety, economics,  resistance from the popul ation ). Onl y three
prototypes of sodi um-cooled breeders were operating in 2004.
Because of its histo ry, as well as  because of th e significant h azards o f this reactor line (see
section A ), it is hard to und erstand wh y the SFR  has been se lected by GIF. According to G IF,
research on bot h the fuel c ycle and the  reactor system is n ecessary to bring the SFR to
deployment. Furthermore, there is impor tant work to b e don e regarding safety. Key needs a re to
confirm reliability of passiv e feedback from heat-up of r eactor structures and to e stablish th e
long-term ability to cool the oxide  or metal fuel d ebris after a boundi ng case accident
[DOE 2002].
The primary mission for the SF R is the manag ement of hi gh-level wastes. It is also hoped th at
the SRF  becomes economic ally competit ive as an electricity producer. The SF R system is top-
ranked in sustainabilit y because of its c losed fu el cycle and pot ential fo r actinide mana gement. I t
is rated good in s afety, economics,  and proliferation r esistance and ph ysical protection. The  SFR
system is e stimated to b e deployable by 2015 [DOE 2002].
VHTR  – Very-High- Temperature Reactor System:
The VHTR  system us es a thermal neutron sp ectrum  and a once-through uranium  fuel c ycle. The
reference reactor concept has a 600-MW th graphite-moderated helium- cooled co re based on
either the prismatic blo ck fue l of the GT- MHR  or the pebble bed of the PB MR. It is regarded as
the most  promising a nd efficient system for hydrogen production, e ither usin g the thermo-
chemical iodin e-sulphu r process, or from heat, water, and natural gas by applying the steam
reformer technolo gy at core out let temperatures greater than about 1000°C.  The VHTR  is also
intended to g enerate electricity with hi gh efficiency (over 50% at 1000°C ). It is planned to drive
the helium  gas turbine system di rectly with the primar y coolant loop. H owev er, a high
performance helium  gas turbine has to be sti ll developed. The VH TR requires significant
advances in fu el performanc e and hi gh-temperature ma terials [DO E 2002] . 
The VHTR  is a next step in th e evolutionary development of high-temper ature gas-cooled
reactors (HTGR). The technolo gy is based on some  decommissioned  thermal spectrum  HTGR
pilot a nd demons tration p rojects, a ll of whi ch ha d rather short and unsu ccessful overall
operating times,  such as the small Dragon reactor expe riment  (20 M Wth,  1966 - 1975, U.K .), the
AVR  (15 MWe,  1967 -1988, G erman y), the THTR (308 MWe,  1986 -1988, G ermany) as well as
the U.S.  plants at  Peach Bo ttom (42 MWe , 1967 -1974 ) and Fort St. Vrain (3 42 MW e,1976-
1989 ). 
Furthermore, it is hop ed th at the concept c ould benefit from the experience gained with th e
Japan ese HTTR and the  Chin ese HTR-10 p rojects, which are still in th e test ph ase, as well as
from the GT -MHR  and th e PBMR projects at present in th e plannin g phase. 
The Chines e HTR-10 i s an expe rimental 10 M Wth pebble bed HTGR . Full-pow er operation w as
achieved in Janua ry 2003. The  test operation schedule was distu rbed by the out break of the
SARS  epidemic in A sia in 2003 [ NUCWEEK 38_03].  
The HTTR  (30 MWth),  a prismatic c ore research reactor, is op erating in Japan to d emonstr ate
the feasibility of reaching core outlet temper atures of up t o 950°C  and to p erform tests fo r
hydrogen produc tion. Unde r construction for eight years, the HTTR reached its fi rst criticality in
1998. At th e end of 2001, a  core outl et coolant temper ature of 850°C  was reached for the first
time.  Operation a t higher temperatures (950°C ), howe ver, will not b e achieved in th e short term.
During operation in th e last years, core temper atures reached higher values than anticipated.
Therefore, it is to b e feared that core temper ature limits  will be exc eeded if outl et temperature is
raised fur ther [POH L 2002].   (For mor e information  on GT -MHR,con cerning PBMR,  see
section B .1.)
   50 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

According to G IF, the V HTR system is r anked hi gh in e conomics  because of its h igh hydrogen
production efficiency, and in s afety and reliabilit y because of th e inh erent safety features of th e
fuel and reactor. It is rated good in p roliferation resistance and physical protection, a nd neutral in
sustainability because of its op en fu el cycle. The VH TR system is seen as the nearest-term
hydrogen produc tion s ystem available, estimated to b e deployable by 2020 [DOE 2002].
Other Pro jects Regard ed as G eneration IV
Apart from the concepts selected by GIF, and outsid e the framework of G IF proper, other
concrete projects are under development  which a re labelled as “Generation IV” by their
promote rs. Two important ex amples  for such p rojects will b e briefly discussed he re.
International Re actor Innovative and Se cure (IRIS):
IRIS is a modular P WR (335 M We) b eing developed by an internation al consortium including
twenty-one organizations (i ndus try, utilities, laboratories and univ ersities) from ten countries. In
1999, Westinghous e formed  the group to d evelop a  reactor for deployment by 2015. I t is
intended to sa tisfy the Generation IV goals [NE I 2005;  WESTI NGH 2005].  
IRIS has an integral configuration. Th e reactor vessel hous es not onl y the nuclear fuel a nd
control rods, but a lso all the major reactor coolant system components. This d esign enhances
safety, because it eliminates exte rnal loop pipin g and thus, accidents involv ing a large loss of
coolant (LOCAs) [NU CNE WS 2003].  On th e other hand, the  integral vessel is larger than a
traditional PW R pressure vessel and flawless manufac ture of suc h vessels, includin g inspection,
is more diffi cult (see also section A , sub-section on BWR s).
The incorporation of th e control rod drive mech anisms insid e the vessel is e liminatin g the
possibilit y of head failures. On e of th e improved  features of th e steam generator design is that
the high-pressure primary coolant flows  on th e outs ide of the tub es. Thus, th e probability of tube
failure is re duced. On th e other hand, insp ection a nd ma intenance of in tegral steam generators
require new tools a nd methodolo gies.
IRIS was a candidate system under consideration in G IF. It was not se lected as one  of the six
concepts for further development, how ever, because of th e difficult insp ection of t he primar y
system [NER AC 2002].  It is remarkable that international e fforts are nevertheless unde rtaken to
further develop this “ loser” system.  This is p robably for economic  reasons as  because of its
simplified  design requiring fewer pumps,  valves, pip es, and oth er components, it is a imed  to
shut down th e reactor for major maintenance only every four years. The entire reactor core is
replaced after eight years; therefore the handli ng of sp ent nu clear fuel is not n ecessary at the
plant.
The reactor requir es uranium  that is more hi ghly enriched tha n that used in c onventional reactors
– 5 %  for the first reactor core and 9 %  for su ccessive reactor cores. It is aimed  to develop a  15-
year operating cycle for the fuel, at  15 % enrichment [NE INST 2005].  With high burn-up fu el,
the reactor uses up mor e of the fiss ionable material tha n does a conv entional reactor, reducing
the amount  of nu clear waste produc ed. B ut currently, only fuel enrichment  up to 5 % U-235 is
licensed. Th erefore, the IRIS first-of-kind -plant would u se standard enrichment fuel (4.95%) in a
fuel assembly that is practically identical to currently operating PWR. 
The capability of emplo ying high burn-up, l ong-life cores, whi ch, to gether with the capability of
operating four years without shutdown fo r mainten ance, addresses the proliferation -resistance
requirement, but, more important, in creases the capacity factor and decreases the operation a nd
mainten ance costs [NUCNEW S 2003].
IRIS is offered in c onfigurations of single or multiples  modules.  Within a multiple  unit man y
systems a nd ph ysical facilities are shared, in cludin g the control room.  Thus, costs can be
minimised; on the oth er hand, sha ring of facilities creates new ri sks: Th e hazard of common
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 51

cause failures is in creased, a nd th e new h azard of cr itical situ ations a rising because of mi xing-up
of units is c reated.
The core damage frequency for IRIS is estimat ed to be in t he order of 10-8/yr. It is clear that not
all accidents n ecessitating an off-site eme rgency response are being completel y eliminated.
Nevertheless, it is int ended to h ave IRIS licensed without a ny eme rgency respons e requirements,
due to th e claimed  low p robabilit y of severe accidents – in spi te of th e fact that all probability
estimates are beset wi th large uncertainties, particularly those below about 10-6/yr. Thus, publi c
acceptance is to be increased and th e possibilit y to site IRIS closer to popu lation centres op ened.
The NRC  pre-licensing application will b e complet ed by 2005. A ccording to W estinghous e, no
prototype is needed fo r design certification sin ce IRIS does not r epresent a  new technolo gy, only
new engineering [NU CNEWS 2003]. 
Gas Tur bine Modul ar Helium  Reactor (GT-MHR ):
The GT -MHR is a modula r gas cooled reactor, based on HTG R technolo gy. It is being
developed by General Atomics  (USA) in pa rtnership with Russia 's Minatom, suppor ted by Fuji
(Japan) and is ba sed on G eneral Atomics’ MHTGR  (modula r high-tempe rature gas-cooled
reactor) concept th at was developed in th e 1980s. Th e initial a pplication is int ended to b e the
consumption  of plutoni um from dismantled  weapons in c onjunction with th e generation of
electricity. Future commercial deployment for electricity production usin g low e nriched uranium
fuel is a nticipated. Th e current design is claimed  to mee t the Generation IV nuclear programme
goals [LABAR  2004].  
The GT -MHR module  couples a gas-cooled modular h elium  reactor (MHR) with a  modular g as
turbine (GT) energy conversion s ystem contained in a n adjacent vessel. T he reactor and pow er
conversion v essels are located in a  below ground c oncrete silo. The  use of a  direct gas turbine
cycle instead of a  steam-water circuit re presents the onl y subs tantial point in whi ch the GT -
MHR  has been developed fu rther from the MH TGR. The main  motivati on be hind thi s
modification is to s ave costs – it in creases the efficiency, simplif ies the pow er plant a nd reduces
the number of s ystems an d components , in particular avoidin g the need for steam generators
[LABAR  2004] .
The cylindrical co re consists of 102 h exag onal fuel element  columns  of graphite blocks with
channe ls for helium  and control ro ds. Half th e core is r eplaced every 18 months.  The preliminar y
design stage was complet ed in 2001. Pl ant co sts are expect ed to b e less than 1000 US$  /kW.  The
developme nt timeline is for a prototype to be constructed in R ussia 2006 -09, f ollowin g
regulatory review th ere [W ANO 2005] . 
The GT -MHR will b e buil t as modules  of 285 MWe each, fou r of which make  up the full plant
rated at  1140 M We. As in the modul ar IRIS concept, it is in tended that systems be shared
between modules , whi ch gives rise to n ew, sp ecific hazards (see above, sub -section on I RIS).
The GT -MHR produces less radioactive waste than ot her reactor options b ecause of th e plant’s
high thermal efficiency and hi gh fue l burnup [ LABAR  2004].  The diff erence, how ever, is not
dramatic. (Compa red to a n LWR of th e same size, a  GT-MHR  produc es about 40 %  of the
actinides. R egarding waste handling, transpo rt, and final disposal, this c annot b e regarded as a
significant di fference.) 
The propone nts of the  GT-MHR  forward the same claims  concerning safety, performanc e, and
economy as do t he propon ents of th e PBMR.  As a  matte r of fact, how ever, the  GT-MH R is beset
by the same weaknesses as  is th e PBMR (see section B. 1).
Regarding safety, key questions therefore remain unansw ered, for exam ple related to
confin ement requirements  [HITTNER 2004].  As far as published in formation  goes today, the
GT-MHR appears to have no co ntainme nt, only a “containment  structure” the design of whi ch is
   52 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

not c lear [GA 2005].  How ever, the feasibility of adding a containme nt to th e MHTGR  concept
has already been studi ed by DOE in th e 1980 s – with the result th at this would b e possible, with
the cost between 30 a nd 90 million  US$  (1989), depending on th e containme nt co ncept [MHB
1990].  If nevertheless no c ontainment  were ind eed foreseen for the GT -MHR, this would c learly
illust rate that cost cutting, not i mprovem ent of sa fety, is th e main drivin g force behind the
developme nt of Ge neration I V reactors.
Evaluation of Generation IV; Conclusions
Unanticipated technical problems, accidents, the uns olved nuclear waste problem as well as  the
high costs o f nuclear pow er, combined  with lack of pub lic acceptance, have lead to a  decline of
nuclear pow er. Th e nuclear share of electricity production is expec ted to d ecrease in most
regions of the wo rld [SCHNEIDER 2004].
This is th e background fo r the Generation IV initiative of th e U.S.DOE.  A label is created whi ch
is to s ell the illusion  to the  public that a completel y new g eneration of r eactors is b eing
developed, w hich is f ree from all the problems  which are plaguing current nu clear installations.
DOE h as been careful not to id entify specific reactor designs th at it considers compatibl e with
Gen IV principles. It prefers to focus on g eneral criteria [NUMA RK 2000].  
The messa ge for the media, polit icians and th e popul ation is: G eneration I V means a  safe,
economically compe titive, proliferation- resistant pow er source wit hout the problem of
increasing greenhouse gas emissions  [INEEL 2003].  Generation IV is even presented as
sustainable – a  label whi ch is usually, and with g ood re ason, r eserved fo r renewabl e energy
sources, and conservation. T he fact that non e of th e six reactor concepts selected fo r
developme nt fulfils all Generation I V aims is usu ally not me ntioned. 
Due to economic  and pol itical reasons, the era of a single compan y’s or nation ’s developing and
deploying a new type of nu clear plant h as passed. The refore, about two thi rds o f all countries
with nu clear pow er plants ar e cooperating in the  framework of G IF (other countries had be en
invited bu t declined to p articipate). The membership  in this int ernation al forum commits
participating countries to suppo rt lon g-term research efforts. Th is includes – via EURA TOM –
countries which are basically oppos ed to nuclear pow er.
Althou gh the nuclear indust ry strongly suppo rts th e idea of a  revitalization o f nuclear pow er,
there is considerable debate as to wha t reactor type should b e used. In particular, among  indust ry
expe rts, th ere is a  raging controversy between propon ents of Ge neration I II and Ge neration I V.
Support ers of Ge neration I II argue that there is no n eed to abandon tod ay’s mature LW R
technol ogy, in order to expe riment  with half-developed but “alternative” concepts
[NUCWEEK 19_04].  
In the end, it all comes down to s electing between two b ad alternatives. The U.S.  government  is
attempting a  compro mise  and div ides the (sparse) financial means d evoted to th e development
of new g eneration reactors ab out e qually between Ge neration I II and Ge neration I V. Of the 300
million  US$ for DOE ’s nu clear energy activities in fis cal 2004, t he Nu clear Powe r 2010
initiative (concerning Generation III) received 20 m illion US$,  and th e Generation IV initiative
24 million  US$ [NUC WEEK 46_03].
A primar y goal of G eneration IV lies in th e securing of fin ancial mea ns for nuclear research.
Today, nuclear pow er still receives a large amount  of R &D m oney – half of th e energy R&D
budget (87.6 b illion US$) sp ent b y 26 OECD  mem ber st ates between 1991 a nd 2001 w ent to
nuclear research; onl y about 8 %  to renewables [SCHNEIDER 2004] . Graduall y, how ever, a
shift a way from nuclear pow er is taking place. The Generation IV initiative attempts  to reverse
this shift b y makin g nuclear energy attractive and presentin g it as sustainable and CO2-free –
labels usually (and with justification ) reserved fo r renewabl es.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 53

This st rategy will help the nuc lear indus try and nu clear research institutions to su rvive. W hethe r
it will r eally lead to th e development  of new reactors remains hi ghly doubtful . The estimated
costs for the development  of the six Generation I V concepts are about 6 bill ion U S$ (about 600
to 1000 million  US$  per system, plus a bout 700 million  US$  for cross-cutting research) [DOE
2002].  It is m ore than lik ely that ov erruns will o ccur both f or costs a nd for the time required.
According to on e of th e strongest suppor ters of the G IF programme,  the French government,
Generation I V “will a t best be ready for commercial deployment around 2045 ” [NU CWEEK
20_04],  and not 2030 a s offi cially envisaged by GIF.
This is to b e seen before the  background tha t nuclear energy is currently not c ost competitive in
the deregulated mark et; not wi th coal and natural gas [MIT 2003] , and also not wi th wind
energy. A recently publish ed study demons trates that for the same investment, wind g enerates
2.3 times  more electricity than a nuclear reactor [GR EENP EAC E 2003].
As nu clear power generation ha s become  established sin ce the 1950s, th e size of r eactor units
has grown from 60 M We to more th an 1300 M We, with c orrespondin g economies  of scale in
operation. Tod ay there is a  move  to develop smalle r units, whi ch m ay be bui lt independently or
as modules  in a larger complex,  with c apacity added inc rementally as required. T he driving
forces for small NPP s are the reduction of the  financial risk and th e need fo r integration into
smalle r grids in man y developing countries [WANO 2005].  The largest increase in nu clear
generation is p rojected fo r the developing world, wh ere a potential market for Generation IV is
seen. Ho weve r, an IAEA expert has voi ced doubt c oncerning these prospects: Developin g
countries will not order new NPP s that have not demons trated th eir constructability and
operation ability. They would not lik e to h ave completel y new types of innov ative NPP s unless
they have been bui lt and ope rated successfull y elsewhe re [NPJ 2002] . 
Furthermore, th e opinion th at the onl y way to make nu clear pow er cost competit ive is the  use of
small  modules is not sha red by all nuclear indus try expe rts.
Anoth er attempt to improve th e economics  of nu clear powe r is to g o into the production of
hydrogen, which is en visaged for several of the  Generation I V concepts. “ Hydrogen is on e of the
three pillars of nu clear hop es fo r the future (the oth ers are the need to ph ase out foss ils fuels and
the increased demand  for pow er expe cted from developin g countries)” [GORDON 2004].  
According to G IF, a closed fuel cycle is celebrated as a major  advantage of G eneration IV
concepts. A system with a closed fue l cycle is regarded as more effective, and sust ainable.
How ever, not a ll of t he six  concepts selected fo r developme nt emplo y a closed fu el cycle. The
VHTR,  most favou red, relays on a n open cycle; and for  the SCWR, once-through constit utes th e
nearer-term option. F urthermore, it is qu estion able wh ether it wi ll actually be pos sible to
successfully develop and implement  the closed c ycles.
Finally, the costs of su ch fue l cycle concepts woul d be very high.  A ccording to th e recently
publish ed study “The Future of Nu clear” of th e U.S . Mas sachusetts I nstitute of Technolo gy
[MIT 2003],  a convincing case has not y et been ma de that th e lon g term waste mana gement
benefits of ad vanced closed fu el cycles involvi ng reprocessing of sp ent fuel a re not inde ed
outw eighed by the sho rt term risks and costs, in cludin g proliferation risks. A lso, the MIT study
found th at the  fuel cost with a closed cycle, including waste storage and disposal c harges, to be
about 4.5 times  the cost of a  once-through cycle. Therefore it is no t realistic to expec t that there
ever will be new reactor and fu el cycle technolo gies tha t simult aneous ly overcome  the problems
of cost, safe was te dispos al an d proliferation. As a  result th e stud y concludes that the onc e-
through fuel cycle best mee ts the criteria of low c osts and proliferations-resistance [NEI 2003 c].
For thermal reactors, “sustainability” is to be achieved by higher enrichment.  This, how ever,
does no t solve th e was te problem. On th e contrary – exp erts are pointin g out that so-called hi gh
   54 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

burn-up f uel e lements  will lead to a dditional pr oblems  not onl y during reactor operation, but
also dur ing intermedia te storage and final disposal [BORN  2002].
As w as to be expected, sho rt-term efforts wil l concentrate on th ermal reactors. A ccording to a
recent announ cement  of the  U.S.DOE,  the GIF efforts have been divided into n ear-term Gen IV-
A thermal systems that wil l use advanced hi gh-burnup fu els and the  longer-term Gen IV-B that
will us e fast reactors [FABIAN 2004].
All in a ll, Generation I V reactors are far away from the goal to su ccessfully mini mize and
mana ge their nuclear waste.
In addition to not b eing economica l, reprocessin g separates plu tonium,  which is a serious
proliferation concern. The  Nuclear Control Institute (NCI) warned th at transmutation  of sp ent
nuclear fuel is no g uarantee against p roliferation [EN S 2004].  Furthermore, th e growing
concerns ab out th e safe and secure transpo rtation of nu clear mat erials and th e nuclear security of
nuclear facilities from terrorist a ttacks is not ad equately taken into a ccount in any of th e
concepts.
Regarding proliferation, it is g enerally recognized that it is a practical impos sibility to render
civilian nuclear energy systems proliferation -proof. Thus , it cannot b e expe cted th at Generation
IV will a chieve a great leap forward in this r espect [ANDER SON 2005].
The basic c oncepts of the “new generation” have be en aroun d as lon g as nuclear pow er, but
they were forced out of the  market in th e early years by the light water reactors – not withou t
reason, c onsidering the experi ences so far, whi ch are dom inated by technical and economic
problems, and safety deficits.
In order to overcome these problems, materials, p rocesses and op erating regimes th at are
significantly different from thos e of c urrently operating systems o r previou s systems have to b e
developed. 
Research and development  are needed to c onfir m the viability and safety of new d esign
approaches. Nu clear pow er plants are very complex  systems that cannot b e complet ely mode lled
in an accurate manner – in pa rticular regarding passiv e systems that represent a  mark ed
departure from established co ncepts. Th e actual plant response to a ll conceivable events ca nnot
be tested. Th e safety issues surroundin g nuclear pow er are also especially difficult because of
the pot entially catastrophic and irreversible consequences of s evere accidents.
Nuclear regulators in th e U.S.  are not enthusiastic about th e new reactor concepts. New nuc lear
power plants should be based on e volutionary, not r evolutionary, technolo gy, according to an
NRC  commissioner. The commissioner  cautioned against “too much inno vation” which would
lead to new p roblems with unt ested designs, and urged the  indust ry not to “overpromi se” the
capabilities of n ew reactor systems [NNF  2005b].  
Even nu clear indust ry representatives are very sceptical tow ards the G eneration IV systems. “We
now th at the paper-moder ated, ink -cooled reactor is th e safest of a ll. All kinds of un expect ed
problems may occur after a project has been launched” [GÜLDNER 2003].
A closer look a t the technical concepts shows  that man y safety problems are still complet ely
unresolved. Saf ety improvements  in on e respect some times create new sa fety problems.  And
even th e Generation IV strategists the mselves do not exp ect si gnificant impr ovements  regarding
proliferation resistance.
But ev en real technical improvements  that might b e feasibl e in p rinciple are only implemented  if
their costs are not too hi gh. Th ere is an enormous discrepancy between th e catch-wor ds used to
describe Generation IV for the media, politi cians a nd the publi c, and th e actual basic drivin g
force behind t he initi ative, whi ch is e conomic  competitiven ess.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 55

The one concept th at ap pears to b e most  innov ative (the MSR ) is not pu rsued with hi gh priority,
since the development  costs a re too h igh. Interest appears to fo cus on th e VHTR,  which is an
evolution ary development  of th e HTGR line, with un resolved safety issues.
Anoth er problematic aspect of Ge neration I V developme nt is tha t it pr ovides a reason to k eep
operating old a nd obsol ete reactors – like, for example,  the Phénix  breeder reactor in France.
This r eactor is expe cted to play an important r ole in the development  of th e Generation IV
international program. However, operating Phén ix is co ntroversial because of it s age – it f irst
achieved criticality in 1973 [NE I 2003 a, b].  But it is the onl y European power reactor whe re
expe riments  in th e transmutation  of lon g-lived radionu clides are condu cted. T he CEA is
promoting t he us e of fast reactors for long-lived-waste transmutation  in a future closed nu clear
fuel cycle and intends to ope rate Phénix for another six cycles to 2009 [NU CWEEK  25_04] .
Wha t is the real moti vation behind t he Ge neration I V initiative? It seems that neither the nuc lear
indust ry, nor the electrical utiliti es believe in thos e new co ncepts. A revival of nu clear pow er is
not to b e expe cted – it wil l remain costly, is not c ompe titive fo r hydrogen production a nd no t
suitable for developin g countries. Is Generation IV a desperate attempt to get into hydrogen
production in s pite of a ll obst acles? Or is th e goal simpl y to keep obs olete research installations
running, which otherwise would b e shut down due  to safety concerns and la ck of n eed? Is there
a serious a ttempt  to de velop th e HTGR technol ogy, selling it as innov ative whil e pursuing an
evolution ary path? Or is it a ll onl y about a n impr ovement  of the  image of nu clear energy, to be
able to perform life extens ion of exis ting reactors whil e talkin g about G eneration I V?
Fact is that subst antial amounts  of mone y are to be inv ested in a n effort that do es not sol ve at all
the problems of nu clear pow er – mone y which could be to b etter uses.

B.3: Problems of Fusion Reactors
Nuclear fusion w as the subj ect of early dreams  about sa fe and cheap energy: About 50 y ears ago,
fusion p ropon ents we re convinced tha t it would b e best to s kip fission re actors because they are
too d angerous, and go straight for fusion reactors. In the early 70s, it was  expe cted th at there
would b e “competit ive fus ion” by the year 2000 [HE INDLER 1995].
At th e turning of th e century, how ever, it w as clear that an enormous  development  effort is sti ll
needed until a fusion pow er station c an go into operation. En gineers aim at the middle  of th e 21st
century for the first availabilit y of an economical fusi on reactor [SCHAP ER 1999].  The
EURATOM  Scientifi c and Techni cal Co mmittee prudently stated recently that it would t ake
twenty years before it c ould b e determined wh ether fusion is a  viable option fo r electricity
suppl y in th e 21st century at all [STC 2003].
The timetabl e for the International Thermonucle ar Experimental R eactor (ITER) reflects th e
scale of the  efforts still required. ITER is me rely a first s tep, sti ll far away from a comm ercial
fusion pow er plant: The feasibi lity of a self-sust aining fusion r eaction is to be demonstrated.
Present co nstruction c ost estimates for this e ffort lie in t he range of 5 bi llion Euros, with
operation al co sts expe cted to b e similar . If construction b egins in 2006, th e plant is to b e
operation al by 2014; a bout 20 y ears would th en be required to com plete the research work
[NUCWEEK 08_04, 49_04] . It is qu estionable wh ether this s chedule will b e kept sin ce the site
for this project still h as not b een selected in e arly 2005 [NUC WEEK 06_05].
All in a ll, it is hi ghly question able whe ther fusion will b e wo rth all the efforts pl anned for  the
next decades. Already, it is fo reseeable that it will b e neither safe, no r clean, no r proliferation-
resistant.
The radioactive inve ntory of a fusion r eactor is expe cted to b e high, compa rable to th at of a
fission r eactor of th e same size. Co mpar ed to a  fission reactor, the  fusion inve ntory is generally
less toxic  and sho rter-lived because it c onsists of tritium and activation products, and contains
no fission p roducts and actinid es. How ever, there are activation products with h alf-lives in the
order of mill ions of years. 
Accident mechanism s are different from thos e as fission pow er plants. Event sequences in a
fusion r eactor resulting from initiators lik e, for exa mple,  plasma disruption or loss of coolant
flow a re not c ompletely understood [BÄH R 1995].  Reli able risk estimates wil l only be possibl e,
if at all, when a  concrete design for a comm ercial plant has been developed in d etail. From the
present vi ewpoint, a ccidents with c atastrophi c releases of ra dioactivity appear possible
[SCHAPER 1999].
Tritium  releases du ring normal operation a re expected to b e least ten time s higher than thos e of
pressurized w ater reactors; estimations vary by about thr ee orders of mag nitud e [SCHAP ER
1999].  Routine emis sions of ae rosols a re could be higher than thos e of fission pow er plants by a
factor of 100 to 10,000 [HE INDLER 1995].
Because of th e high expos ure to particle radiation and heat, the components  of a fusion reactor
which ar e facing the plasma  mus t be replaced re gularly. They constit ute the main  part of the
radioactive w astes arising from fusion r eactor and co ntain a ctivated m etal and tritium. Further
radioactive w astes arise by contamination of oth er plant p arts. The wa ste amounts  correspond to
the waste from a fission reactor or are even higher. As h as been po inted out, on t he oth er hand,
the wastes are generally shorter-lived than thos e of nu clear fiss ion. H owev er, a particularly
problematic nu clide often ov erlook ed in a nalyses is beryllium-10, wi th a half live of 1.51 milli on
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 59

years. All in a ll, lon g-term radioactive was te mana gement wi ll be required fo r fusion pl ants
[SCHAPER 1999].  They give rise to a waste problem compar able to th at of fiss ion pow er plants.
Regarding proliferation issu es, a fusion reactor as such do es not c ontain nor would pr oduce
mate rials usable for fission w eapon s. However, the neutron r adiation c ould b e emplo yed to
produce plutoni um or uranium- 233. Th e hard en ergy spectrum of fusion ne utrons is p articularly
“favour able” to th e production of hi gh-quality weapon plu tonium, much more so th an th e
neutron sp ectrum of a light water reactor.
The fuel of a fusion reactor as envisaged at present co nsists of d euterium  and tritium. Tritium is
not required fo r simple  fission bombs.  Howeve r, advanced nu clear weapons ( “boosted”
weapons ) emplo y tritium to inc rease the strength of th e fission c hain reaction b y addition al
fusion n eutrons. F or states with a n advanced militar y nuclear program, therefore, a fusion
reactor could b e interesting from the viewpoint of tr itium suppl y.
Furthermore, som e processes involv ed in fusion research are similar to thos e in a  hydrogen
bomb.  Therefore, there are fusion expe riments  that could be “helpful” in th e development  of
thermonucle ar weapons .

C: Ageing, PLEX and Safety
Introduction and Overview
There is general consensus that the extens ion of the life of r eactor is of th e foremost importance
today for the nuclear indus try. The International En ergy Agency point edly sums it up a s follows
[IEA 2001]:  “If there are no c hange s in policy towards nuclear pow er, plant  lifetime is th e
singl e mos t important d eterminant of nu clear e lectricity produ ction in th e coming d ecade.”
Across the wor ld over the last two de cades the re has been a general trend a gainst o rdering new
reactors.  This h as been ca used by a variety of factors; fear of a nuclear accident, followin g the
Three Mile Island, Che rnobyl and Monju a ccidents; histo ric over capacity of generation;
increased scrutiny of economics  and fin ancing of nu clear pow er with th e introduction of
liberalised electricity mark ets; and environme ntal factors, such as waste manageme nt or
radioactive dis charges.  As a  consequence of this la ck of o rders the average age of nu clear
reactors have increased year on y ear and is now 21 y ears old [Schneide r 2004] .
Source: IAEA, PRIS,  20055
At th e time  of th eir construction it w as usually assumed that the reactor would not op erate
beyond 40 y ears.  How ever, now, in o rder to r etain th e nuclear share of t he electricity suppl y and
to max imise profits – with in the ory the large construction a nd decomm issioning  costs paid fo r-
life extension off ers an attractive proposition fo r the nuc lear operators.
What is Ageing?
In any indust rial plant, mate rial properties are deteriorating during operation due  to th e loads th e
components  are subj ected to. The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) defines a geing as
5 http://www-ns.iaea.org/conve ntion s/nuclear-safety.htm
   62 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

a continuous  time-dependent loss of qu ality of ma terials, c aused by the operating conditions
[IAEA 1990].
Ageing processes ar e difficult to de tect because they usually occur on th e micr oscopi c level of
the inn er structure of ma terials. Th ey frequently become  apparent onl y after a component  failure,
for example  break of a  pipe, has occurred.
Failure rates generally are higher after start-up of a  plant, wh en construction e rrors or design
shortcoming s become  evident. I n this ph ase, considerable efforts ar e usually undertaken to
correct all problems, since there is a  high economic  incentiv e to a chieve smooth  plant operation
as soon a s pos sible.
During the ‘middl e age’ of a plant, p roblems tend t o be at a mini mum. Later, as ageing processes
demand  their due, there will b e a gradual increase of failure rates. Th e result is a “bathtub -curve”
as shown in th e figure below:
Typical bathtub-curve of t ypical failure rates at an NPP
This is a  process that is not a lways easy to recognise and to follow, a nd w hich in creases pl ant
risk considerably. For a nuclear pow er plant, whatever the reactor type, the ageing phase wil l
begin after about 20 y ears of op eration. This, how ever, is a  rule-of-thumb  number onl y and
ageing phenom ena can begin earlier.
As th e wo rld’s nuclear powe r plant popul ation g ets old er, the re are efforts to pl ay down th e role
of ageing. Thos e efforts includ e conveniently narrowin g the definition of a geing. In a German
study of th e late 90s, a geing-related damages are limited  to damages caused by unfo reseen lo ads
during operation, in spit e of d esign and ope ration b eing in accordance with the requirements.
Damages oc curring later in pl ant life because design, manufa cturing, commissioning o r
operation i s not in a ccordance with r equirements are not re garded as ageing-related
[LIEMERSDORF  1998].
On this b asis, a ccording to a recent stud y, only a small  percentage of failures in G erman nuclear
power plants appear to b e due  to ageing. This r estriction, however, is not a cceptable. The
restriction is a rtificial and ar bitrary since it is not pos sible to c ompletel y avoid deviations f rom
requirements in components o f nuclear plants; their possibilit y always has to b e taken int o
account during plant op eration. On th e other hand, f ailure to for esee a load in the design phase
could w ell be regarded as a design error.
Thus, a geing will b e und erstood in a  compreh ensive ma nner here, according to the IAEA
definition quot ed above .
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 63


PLEX and PLI M
PLEX (Plant Life Extensi on) appears to be a fairly straightforward and a clear concept. T he
definition of li fe exten sion, howeve r, gets somew hat muddled  if the definition of plant lif e time
itself is l ess then cl ear.
This do es not ap ply to the USA  whe re operating licenses are granted for 40 y ears and life
extension c learly begins after this time.  In the UK, op erating periods ar e likewise fixed (for
example,  originally 30 y ears for the Hinkl ey B AGR s). Similar rules apply in Russia a nd Eastern
and Cent ral European countries.
In man y countries, on t he oth er hand, op erating licenses are not explicit ly limited  in their
validity. Assumptions concerning the lifetime are usually contained in th e proof of s afety for a
nuclear pow er plant, g iving, potentially a considerable amount  of flexibilit y. How ever, the re
often is a  requirement  for a decennial safety review of th e plant.
In France, for example,  30 y ears appear have been generally recognised a s the exp ected pl ant
lifetime in th e past; lon ger periods are now unde r consideration. T he situation i s similar, e .g., in
Spain a nd G ermany. In the latter country, there is a ceiling for the amount  of electricity to be
produced by each NPP , roughly correspondin g to th e commerci al lifetime  as generally
envisaged. Amounts  of electricity can be transferred, how ever, from older to newer plants, thu s
providing leeway for life extension.
The distin ction be tween measu res to make sure that th e lifetime  originally planned is re ached,
and measu res aiming at prolon ging the lifetime  becomes  unclear in man y countries – p articularly
so sin ce the mea sures are basically the same in e ach case. This complication h as to be well kept
in mind.
Nuclear pow er plant op erators and th eir technical suppor t organisations ap pear to ta ke advantage
of this situ ation b y emplo ying wording which is d eliberately enigmatic. “Plant Ope rational Life”
increasingly is not r egarded as a pre-defined period, wi th the consequence that “[the] term
PLEX  is now  falling out of f avour b ecause, of ‘ Plant L ife’ or ‘O perationa l Life’ is undefined, it
is then illog ical to talk about plan t life extension.”  Instead, the general term PLIM (Plant L ife
Management) is emplo yed which can relate either to activities required to ke ep a plant in a n
adequa te condition to meet th e intended amortisation p eriod, o r to a ctivities whi ch aim to extend
plant op eration in time  [LMD 2002].
Thus, th e intention to op erate a plant b eyond the original design lifetime can be hidd en in PLIM
measu res. For greater clarity, therefore, we will use the term PLEX in t his report, even if it i s ill
favou red in some  circles.
Phenomena of Ageing
Ageing already occurs during the period u sually regarded as typical com mercial lifetime (30 to
40 years). Naturally, with PLEX, ageing mecha nisms will become increasingly important ov er
the years, contributing significantl y to ov erall plant risk.
The most  import ant influ ences leading to ageing processes in a nuclear pow er plant a re
[MEYER  1998]:
•Irradiation
•Thermal loads
•Mechanical loads
•Corrosiv e, ab rasive and erosive processes
   64 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

•Combinations and interactions o f the processes me ntioned above
Chan ges of mec hanical properties frequently cannot b e recognised by non-destructive
examinations.  Therefore it is difficult to g et a reliable, conservative assessment  of th e actual
state of ma terials. I n man y cases, non -destructive examinations  permit to monitor  crack
developme nt, changes of su rfaces and wa ll thinnin g. How ever, because of limited  accessibility
due to th e layout of components a nd/or high radiation levels no t all components  can be
examined  one hund red percent. Th erefore, it is necessary to re ly on model  calculations in o rder
to determine  the loads a nd th eir effects on mate rials. Those models  can only be validated with
the aid of simplifi ed systems, sa mples  or mock-up s. Non -quantifiable uncertainti es remain. Not
even th e most complex  calculations c an cover all conceivable synergistic effects.
With  increasing age of plants, damage mech anisms might o ccur whi ch have not been fo reseen,
or whi ch had even been ex cluded ( for example,  stress c orrosion c racking in tit anium-stabilized
austenitic steels), exa cerbating the ageing problems.
The me asures to monitor  and control a geing processes are know n as ageing mana gement.
Ageing mana gement c onsists of pr ogrammes  with a ccelerated sam ples, safety reviews a nd also
the precaution ary exchange of components  in case cracks or other damag es have been found
during inspections. F urthermore, it in cludes optimi zing of op erational procedures in o rder to
reduce loads. I n the Uni ted States, a specific ageing management p rogramme for reactor
pressure vessels (time limited  ageing analyses) has been developed [R INCKEL 1998] .
New, int egral methods  for the monitor ing of NPP  operation have been developed in t he late 90s
which at tempt to predict the futu re behaviou r of individu al compone nts on th e basis o f limit ed,
known info rmation.  This w as motivated b y the increasing age of nuclear pow er plants
worldwid e as well as by the general trend tow ards life extension. The aim is, at the one hand, to
arrive at insp ection p rogrammes  which are economicall y more e fficient a nd save time; on th e
other hand, ac tual failures are to be avoided to k eep down -times short, impr oving ec onomy and
safety in parallel [A LI 1998; B ARTON ICEK 1998 ; BICEGO 1998; D UTHIE 1998;
ESSE LMANN 1998; H IENSTORFER 1998; ROOS  1998] .
Ageing Effects at Specific Components
Ageing can occur in man y different manifes tations at  different components . The most impor tant
ones are, for light water reactors (PW Rs includin g VVERs , and BWR s):
Reactor Pressure Vessel:
•Materials close to th e core: Embrittlement  (reduction of tou ghness, shift of th e ductile-
to-brittle-transit ion temperature) through neutron irradiation. This e ffect is particularly
relevant if impurit ies are present. Coppe r and phospho rus favou r embrittl ement,  as well
as nickel at very high neutron f luences as encount ered at VVER  reactor vessels. Neutron
embrittl ement  is mostl y relevant fo r PWRs. Because of a  potential flow r ate effect
(higher damage at low er flow rates, for a given ov erall do se), it c an also become  relevant
for BWRs.
•Welds:  Crack growth b ecause of c hanging thermal and mech anical loads. F or PWRs, this
occurs mostly in embrittled we lds close to th e core; for BWR s, in lon gitudin al welds.
•Vessel head penetrations: Crack fo rmation  and growth du e to c orrosion mech anisms;
concerns P WRs [MEYER 1998].
•Penetrations of v essel bottom:  Damages due to c orrosion, a brasion and th ermo-
mech anical fatigue; concerns BWR s.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 65

•Inner edge of nozzles:  Stron g concentration of str esses because of varying wall thi ckness,
with c hanging thermal and mec hanical loads as well as corrosion a nd erosion effects.
This l eads to the hazard of c rack formation  or growth of cr acks which were formed
during vessel production. The  situation is exa cerbated by the fact that insp ections are
hindered by geometric lay-out an d high wall thi cknesses. Rel evant fo r PWRs and B WRs.
•Core internals, core shroud: E mbrittlement  due to high neutron f luences, as well as
damages by corrosion a nd erosion. Can onl y be inspected visu ally. If mate rials
containin g cobalt are used, th ere is th e addition al hazard of a ctivated cobalt getting into
the cooling water – leading to contamination  problems, for exa mple  at refuelling.
Relevant fo r PW Rs and BW Rs.
•Bolts and nu ts und er pressure: Localised leakages of th e borated c oolant (f or example,
due to st ress re laxation a nd accordingly, reduction of st retch elongation) can lead to
corrosive damage at flange surfaces and screws’ mate rials. R elevant fo r PW Rs and
BWR s.
Pipelines:
Cracks h ave been found i n titanium- stabilized austenitic steel pipes o f all Geman  BWR s, which
are mainl y due to st ress corrosion cracking [ERV E 1994].  In all pip elines which have not b een
exch anged, further damage is possibl e. Because of th e more b enign water chemistry, damage
due to st ress co rrosion cracking is no t expected in PW Rs. How ever, strain-indu ced co rrosion
and er osion c orrosion a re poss ible at longer operating times.  Apart from mech anical loads, there
is increasing influen ce of th ermal loads which are not suffi ciently known ( i.e. because of t hermal
layering) and w hich are higher than as sumed in pl ant specifications [ ZAISS 1994].  Wall
thinnin g and mat erial’s fatigue because of r esonance vib rations, water hammer e tc. are very
difficult to keep und er surveillance. For all thos e reasons, damag es become  more lik ely with
ageing of mat erials.
Particularly regarding materials’ behaviou r in austenitic pip es in BWR s, there are still open
questions toda y. Not a ll damage me chanisms occurring are complete ly unde rstood, fo r example
crack propagation du e to st ress corrosion c racking in mat erials which have not b een thermall y
sensit ized [KILLIAN 2000] . This implies  that the occurrence of new, unexpected ph enom ena
cannot b e exclud ed.
In connection with p ipe failures, the leak-before-break criterion i s increasingly relied upon.
According to this c riterion, l eakages can be detected, b efore a dangerous break occurs. How ever,
complet e “guillotine” breaks h ave already occurred at nuclear pow er plants – for example,  in
Surry 1987 as  well as  in L oviisa 1990, wh ere there was a break in the  secondary circuit without
leakage beforehand [AH LSTRAND  1991].  In February 1992, sudd en break of t he th ermall y
embrittl ed feedwater pipe at the convention al pow er plant K ardia-1 (Greece) occurred
[JANSKY 1993].  Therefore, it is to be  feared tha t under unf avour able circums tances, breaks
without p receding leak ca n occur.
Main Coolant  Pumps :
Crack for mation and crack growth c an occur due to thermal and high-frequency fatigue
processes, suppo rted by corrosive influ ences. Inspections a re difficult. This p roblem concerns
PWRs and B WRs. In nuclear standards, ASME  (USA) a s well as KTA (German y), corrosive
influ ences seem to have been und erestimated wh en determining the design curves fo r fatigue
[RINCKEL 1998].  Therefore, in spi te of as sumed  suffi cient lon g-term strength, th ere have been
breaks of pump  shafts af ter compar atively short operating times  (for example,  four years)
[SCHULZ 1987] .
   66 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Steam Ge nerators :
Corrosiv e and erosive damage as well as wall thinni ng in th e steam generator tubes h ave lead to
compreh ensive ag eing mana gement a ctivities worldwid e. In the last years, this in creasingly
includes exchange of th e whol e compone nt [MEYER 1998].  Of course, the problem only applies
to PW Rs and is particularly severe for VVER-1000 r eactors (see section A ).
Turbines
Ageing phenomena b ecause of c orrosion, erosion a nd th ermo-mechanical fatigue are to be
expe cted for the tu rbine casing, the turbine shaft an d turbine blades. L arge forged pieces always
contain in -hom ogeneities (inclusions, segregations, small  cracks), whi ch can lead to d amag es
due to th e influences mentioned. Embrittlement  has been obs erved at turbine shaft ma terials
(12Cr -steel an d stellite 6B) because of e rosion du e to liquid ph ase impact [ LEE 1998].
Concr ete Structures:
Structural components lik e the concrete parts of the containment,  protective out er hulls of
buildin gs, biological shields, b asis structures and coolin g towers are subj ect to th ermo-
mech anical loads, but a lso to e ffects of the weather, chemic al attacks an d partly also to high
radiation dos es. This is r elevant for  PWRs and BWR s.
Corrosiv e damage of st eel reinforcements are difficult to insp ect. He nce reduction s in strength
may occur unnoti ced. Th e damage mec hanisms  to concrete through corrosive processes similar
to high radiation dos es are still la rgely unknown. I t is particularly difficult to qu antify the
uncertainties of th e models  that we re developed, a nd to validate thos e mode ls with expe rimental
data [NAUS  1996].
In the Uni ted States, a data bank ( Structural Materials’ Information C enter) has been compiled
in order to as sess e nvironmental in fluences and ageing factors for concrete. A c ompr ehensive
study on th e ageing of F rench co oling towers lead to th e conclusion th at the design lifetime of 40
years is lik ely to be reached, safety margins, howe ver, are considerably smaller than a ssumed
[BOLVIN 1993] . In Switzerland, a  systematic ageing surveillance programme  for NPP
structures was begun 1991 [ ZWICKY 1993].  
Seismic  safety analyses generally are performed  with design mate rial paramet ers. So far, little
notice has been taken of th e weakening of structures through ageing in th is context, in spit e of
the importan ce of th is issue: „The  evaluation for se ismic load ing is pa rticularl y important
because the degrad ed structures or co mpon ents c ould b e mo re vulnerabl e to th e seismic loads.
From a s eismi c anal ysis poin t of view, the aging or  d egrada tion may  affect dynami c prop erties,
structural r esponse, resistance or ca pacity, failur e mod es, and lo cations of fai lure initiation.“
[SHAO 1998] .
Cables :
To begin wi th, the mechanical stability deteriorates wh en cables age, due to em brittlement  of th e
isolating layers. At fi rst, the electrical properties are not infl uenced, e ven if c racks have formed.
How ever, an aged cable with cracked isol ation constitutes a hazard in humid  or chemically
aggressive surroundin gs, particularly in case of ac cidents [ SLITER 1993].
Electroni c Devices:
In an NPP,  many electronic devices are being used. T emper ature and radiation are the main
factors leading to ageing. Addit ional degradation c an occur due to humidit y and chemical
attacks. Because of t he great variety of dif ferent devices and th e complex  ageing phenomena,
which have not been systematically investigated so f ar, reliable lifetime  estimates are very
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 67

difficult. The possibility of flow r ate effects, particularly in semiconducto r elements, c onstitutes
an additional hazard [IAEA 1990].  With increasing age of a plant, th e reliabilit y of electronic
devices can thus b e reduced – whil e at the sam e time, safety margins in the whol e system a re
decreasing.
Most of wh at has been said above about light water reactors (PWRs and BWR s) also applies to
other reactor types.
Beside those e xplicitly mentioned h ere, all other components  of an nuclear power plant a re also,
in principle, subject to c hanges of th eir mate rial properties due to a geing, and thus to a reduction
in fun ctionality. The operational hazard, whi ch in creases ov er time , is exacerbated by the
combination  of all thos e negative changes that d efy quantitative modelli ng and estimation.  In the
course of ma intena nce and ageing manag ement, NPP  operators have reacted to d amages by
repairs and exch ange of components. N evertheless, experi ence shows th at ag ain and again,
unexpec ted ageing-related damages occur – fo r example,  the graphite cracking discove red in
British AGRs in 2004, o r the cracking of austenitic steel pipes in G erman BWRs in the early
1990s ( see section A ). Aus tenitic steel is a  type of st eel optimi zed for corrosion resistance.
Embrittlement  is a particularly severe problem for pressure tub e reactors lik e CANDUs and
RBMKs, sin ce the tub es’ mate rial is located insid e the core and hence, subj ected to a
particularly high neutron flow. Extensive p rogrammes of pressure tub e exchanges have been
implemented  for both thos e reactor types (see section A).
Reactors with g raphite mode rator are subj ect to th e spe cific problems of graphite ageing.
Graphit e cracking in AGRs  has recently been obs erved, whi ch can be a hazard to c ore integrity.
In RBMKs, g raphite swelling leads to g ap closure (see section A ).
Ageing constitutes a particularly severe problem for passiv e components , i.e. components
without movable p arts. Not onl y is it often diffi cult to d etect ageing phenomena. Repl acement
usually was not expe cted fo r compone nts like pip elines or graphite parts, and no pr ovisions
made fo r it.
Regarding active components  like pumps  and valves, deterioration us ually manife sts itse lf in a n
obvious manne r, and exch ange of com ponents  can often be performed  during regular
mainten ance wor k. Ne vertheless, ageing of active components c annot b e neglected as a risk
factor, as the possibilit y of catastrophi c failures of ma in coolant pumps  and tu rbines illustr ate. In
electronic and electric devices, too, d amage can cumulat e unnoti ced unti l the point i s reached
when a dramatic failure occurs.
Various individual a geing-related problems have been studied in s ome detail in th e past. A
number of mech anisms are know n; nevertheless, they are not complet ely understood.
For example,  the dose rate effect in steel irradiation embrittl ement,  already mentioned s everal
times  above, has been known fo r man y years. But it still c annot b e described reliably and
quantitatively today, giving rise to a n increased risk of p ressure vessel failure in older NPPs.
Anoth er problem not fully understood is th e propagation o f cracks in a ustenitic steel pip es.
The lack of complet e knowl edge in crucial areas is of c ourse exa cerbated wh en pl ant li fe is
extend ed. F or example,  regarding the prediction of n eutron embr ittleme nt, there are standard
surveillance programs for monit oring reactor pressure vessels du ring their design life (usually,
up to 40 y ears of op eration ).
In Spain, wh ere plant operators are considering to extent se rvice life from 40 to 60 y ears, it has
been shown  that it is necessary to introduce modif ications in the present su rveillance programs
in order to a chieve a more p recise reactor pressure vessel int egrity evaluation [BA LLESTEROS
2004].  This i s highly problematical since surveillance programs require irradiation of sa mples
   68 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

over years and, to y ield mos t reliable info rmation, have to be  planned before start-up of a  reactor
and not a fter decades of op eration.
Furthermore, a geing processes ca n have far-reaching effects into oth er fields that are not
immediatel y obvious. F or example,  a U.S.NR C-initiated wo rking group (w orking group an “Fire
Induced Dam age to El ectrical Cabl es and C ircuits) found  that in a geing plants wi th deteriorating
cable isolation ma terials, short-circuits and subs equent c able fires seem to appear with
increasing frequency. This c an lead, fo r example,  to erroneous a ctuation of s afety-relevant
valves and cr eates higher demands regarding fire protection measu res [RÖ WEKAMP 2004].
Consequences of Ageing Processes
The consequences of ageing can roughly be described as  two-fold. On th e one hand, th e num ber
of incidents an d reportable events at an NPP will in crease – small  leakages, cracks, sho rt-circuits
due to c able failure etc. In German y, for example,  the ten ol der plants (out of 19 NPPs  in
operation ) are responsi ble fo r about 64 %  of all reportable events in th e time  span 1999 – 2003
(severity of th e events taken into a ccount) [BMU 1999 – 2003] .
On th e oth er hand, th ere are effects leading to gradual weakening of ma terials w hich ma y never
have any conseque nces until t he reactor is shut down, but whi ch could also lead to c atastrophic
failures of components w ith subsequ ent severe radioactive releases. Most not able amon g thos e is
the embrit tlement of the reactor pressure vessel, increasing the hazard of v essel bursting. Failure
of the pressure vessel of a  PWR or a BWR  constitutes an  accident b eyond the de sign basis.
Safety systems are not d esigned to c ope with thi s eme rgency. Hence, there is no c hance that it
can be controlled. F urthermore, p ressure vessel failure can lead to im mediate containme nt
failure as well, fo r example  through the pressure peak after vessel bu rsting, or the formation  of
high-energy fragments .  Catastrophi c radioactive releases are the consequence.
Pressure tub e em brittlement  of RBMK o r CANDU  reactors also falls into th e category of ag eing
processes with pot entially catastrophi c consequences. In case of f ailure of a single or a small
number of tub es, th ere is a  chance that the accident c an be controlled – but not with l arge
numbers f ailing.
Anoth er example  are corrosion processes which ma y be overlook ed fo r years – as a recent event
at the U.S . pressurized w ater reactor Davis Be sse illust rates (see appendix of this section ).
In probabilistic risk assessment  studi es (PRAs), whi ch are increasingly used a s a tool b y nuclear
regulators, ageing is usually not t aken into a ccount. PRA s assume that equipme nt failure rates
are taken from the low c enter portion of th e “bathtub curve”. Th is leads to und erestimation of
the risk [LOC HBA UM 2000].  There are some  attempts to inc lude ageing in su ch studies, for
example  in a recent PRA of Bez nau NPP  (PWR, Switzerland). How ever, the  consideration o f
ageing appears to b e incomplete, an d the available infor mation is some what contradictory [FEA
2004].  Since some  ageing mech anisms  are still not c omplet ely understood, a s has been pointed
out a bove, a complet e and satisfactory treatme nt of a geing effects in the framework of a  PRA  is
not possibl e today and woul d require extens ive further research.
Thus, it is c lear that th e risk of a  nuclear accident g rows significantly with each year, once a
nuclear pow er plant h as be en in op eration for  about two d ecades. B ut it is not possibl e to
quantitatively describe this continuous  increase of risk. I ncreased vigilance during operation a nd
increased efforts for mainten ance and re pairs have the pot ential to counteract this t endency, at
least to some extent. Ho wever, in th e age of liberalization a nd growing economic  pressure on
plant op erators, th e trend r ather goes in th e oppo site direction, e ven as  the reactor fleet is ag eing.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 69

Counter-M easures
In principle, the same mea sures are required to c ounter non -anticipated ageing phenome na
during the planned lif etime  of an NPP , and to extend this lif etime.
Whe n discussing countermeas ures to a geing, a distinction has to b e made b etween replaceable
and non -replaceable components.  There is a wide consensus amon g plant op erators that in
principle, all components  crucial for safety in PW Rs or BWRs can be replaced exc ept two: T he
reactor pressure vessel (RPV), a nd th e containment  structure. For the ex-Sovie t reactor type
VVER-440, st eam generator replacement  also does not se em to be  feasible due to t he so -called
box system [LMD 2002].
The reactor pressure vessel mos tly is regarded as the component  decisive for limiting a  nuclear
power plant’s lifetime.  Therefore, in recent years, investigations h ave been performed  whether
RPV  replacement  could not b e poss ible after all. Siemens studied this op tion [WISE 1998] ; a
feasibility stud y for a BWR was also und ertaken in Japa n [DAISUKE 1999].  The result o f the
latter was that an integrated jud gment was  needed for RPV  replacement th at lay outsid e the
scope of the  stud y, but te chnical feasibilit y was confir med. All in a ll, how ever, RPV
replaceme nt is no t an option s erious ly considered at the mo ment;  pressure vessels are generally
considered to b e irreplaceable [LMD 2001].
RBMKs a nd CANDUs  have an advantage in this re spect sin ce their pressure tubes c an be
exch anged; ind eed, exten sive refurbishment  programmes have already taken pl ace. They are,
however, costly and time-co nsuming.  The lifetime  of a pressure tube  is consid erably shorter than
that of the  average pressure vessel, because tubes are subj ect to c onsiderably higher neutron
influ ences.
For the counter measu res available, four levels generally can be distin guished:
•Exchan ge of compone nts:    This is th e onl y option – a part from permanent shutdown – in ca se
of obvious sho rtcoming s, leakages developin g and other problems that directly influ ence the
power plant op eration. E ven large compone nts like steam generators and reactor pressure
vessel heads (as well as  pressure tub es) can be exch anged.
The costs of measures at this l evel usu ally are high. Excha nge of compone nts also includes
the generation of a dditional radioactive w astes.
•Redu ction of lo ads:    This applies primar ily to the reactor pressure vessel. To a void the rmal
shock eme rgency coolin g water can be preheated. To r educe neutron irradiation ( and hence
the progress of embrit tlement), neutron f luency in the  vessel wall can be reduced by puttin g
dummy elements or highly burnt-up fu el elements in out er core positions. In principle,
measu res of this kind c ould also be applied to ot her components  – ho wever, they can run
counter to the  trend fo r pow er uprating. Cos ts are moder ate at this level.
•Intensify inspections a nd pl ant monitoring :    Ageing effects in m aterials can be ‘compens ated’
by more f requent examinations  and/or be intensification of plant monitorin g, coupled with
appropriate mainten ance, on th e optimistic  assumption  that cracks and oth er damage and
degradation wil l be detected before they lead to catastrophic failure.
The costs of such mea sures are relatively low, particularly regarding plant monitor ing.
•Redu ce safety margins:    By reducing cons ervatism in proofs  of safety, longer lifetimes  result
– at least on pa per.
Such measu res are cheaper than all other opti ons.
The opt ion to repair components  has not b een in cluded here since repairs are largely part of th e
measu res required regularly during plant op eration a nyway, independe nt of PLEX. On e

   70 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Cent ral Eu rope, a method  to reduce em brittlement that is how ever questionabl e regarding the
longer-term benefits, since there is no suf ficient kno wledge to date on th e re-embrittl ement
behaviour  of a vessel after annealing.
Most r ecent pub lications on a geing emphas ize, on a  general level, th at the counter-measures
practised a re adequate to c ontrol the effects of ageing. On the other hand, thi s conclusion is
strongly qualified, if not r efuted, b y frequent st atements  that fu rther inve stigations in to ageing
issues are urgently required.
For example,  a French/G erman publ ication [ MORLENT 2001]  states that according to
international analyses, there is a trend tow ards more and mor e ageing-related events, r equiring
further investi gation. Al so, “operating e xperience has show n that n ew ins ights concerning  the
assessment of th e ageing b ehaviour of [struc tures, systems and c ompon ents] may  come to li ght
in the course of time. It is th erefore seen as a n ecessity that the investiga tions p erformed are
continu ed in o rder to ob tain indi cations of an y safety-signif icant ag eing-related chang es at an
early stag e”. 
Under present c ircums tances, e conomic  pressure is se vere to t he extent th at even inspections a re
being reduced – t he oppos ite of wh at would b e required fo r ageing control. T his is combined
with g eneral cost-reduction strategies of nu clear utilities because of th e liberalization of th e
electricity markets, accompanied by deregulation and inc reased competition. It is claimed  that
intensifi cation o f plant monitor ing can be a sufficient replacement fo r insp ections [ SCHULZ
2001];  how ever, this claim rather appears as an attempt  to mask  the reduction of s afety margins,
and is by no m eans reassuring.
Increasingly, on-site storage of sp ent fu el is p ractised o r being implemented for  lack of
alternatives (in the U SA, German y, Central and Eastern European countries and oth ers). In the
countries concerned, a  necessary precondi tion for  PLEX, whi ch has received very little at tention
so far, is the in crease of sto rage capacity, leading to a correspondi ng increase of the radioactive
inventory at the site.

As can be seen f rom the overview on PL EX programmes presented above life extensions a re
planned in most  countries ope rating nuclear power plants, fo r man y NPPs.  The overview
presented in th e table is suppleme nted here by several important ex amples.
In the Uni ted States, licensin g for life extens ion from 40 to 60 y ears is now w ell und er way, after
a difficult start-up p eriod.  At f irst, safety and licensing problems had in teracted with econom y
in ways not anticipated by the applicants, as became a pparent in case of th e U.S . lead pl ant
Yankee Rowe, where a license renewal procedure ironically lead to p rematu re shut -dow n in
1992 ( for details, s ee appendix  to this se ction). This gave rise to c onsiderable uncertainty amon g
U.S. reactor owners [NU CWEEK 50_97].  There is in creasing optimism, how ever, sin ce the first
extensions w ere granted in spr ing 2000 ( for Calvert Cliff  and O conee) and license renewal
appears to be speeding up in th e USA  [NU CWEEK 41_00].
In France, there are definite plans to extend th e lifetime  of th e whol e PWR fleet from 30 to 40
years [NUC WEEK 40_03] . Lifetime extension will b egin at the earliest, 900 MW e-series PWRs
for which the  30th year-outage could b ecome the springboard to life exten sion. Th e backfi ts
required are already being planne d and wil l be implemented from 2008 onw ards, when th e head-

   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 73

For the Olkiluot o plant in F inland ( two BWR  units), lif e ext ension was performed,  after a
modernization p rogramme 1994 -1998, f rom 30 to 40 y ears. It is pl anned to gradually validate
the units fo r a total lifetime  of 60 y ears [RASTAS 2003].
Life extensions a re also planned in South  Korea, Swe den (to up to 60 y ears), India and oth er
countries. Even for NPPs  with Sovi et-designed reactor types, PLEX is a lready unde r way or
planned. T he operating lifetime  of Paks nuc lear pow er plant in Hun gary (four units of se cond-
generation VVERs) i s to be increased from 30 to 50 y ears, i.e. lon ger than for man y western
reactors [NU CWEEK 47_04] . The Uk rainian government  recently has approved a
compreh ensive p rogramme for life exten sion of th e 13 nu clear units op erating at four pow er
plants. L ifetime is to b e increased by 10 to 15 y ears [NUC WEEK 23_03; NUC WEEK 22_04].
Life extension pl ans do not e ven stop for the most  hazardous a nd obso lete Soviet reactor types,
first-generation VVE Rs and R BMKs. For example,  in Russ ia, operating lifetime  of th e two Kol a
VVER-440/230s is to b e extended b y 15 y ears [NUCWEEK 33_04].  Leningrad-1 RBMK
reached its d esign lifetime  at Janua ry 2004. Aft er a “modernization p rogram” which w as
complet ed in October, lifetime  was extend ed by 15 y ears, despite protests f rom scientist s
working at the All -Russian R &D-Institute for Atomic  Powe r Engineering. Life exten sion is also
planned for the  three oth er RBMK units of th e Leningrad NPP  [NUC WEEK 05_04;
NUC WEEK 45_04].
The Cost Angle
The consequences of ageing which become apparent a s events and in cidents t end to r educe the
NPPs  availability, and thu s, the amount  of electricity produced and sol d. Therefore, there is – up
to a point – a  clear motivation  for the plant op erator to implement  modernization a nd counter
measu res.
On th e oth er hand, th e consequences whi ch “me rely” increase the probability of some
catastrophi c failure, whi le this p robability remains small compar ed to everyday expe rience, carry
no di rect economic  penalty (as lon g as luck wil l have it). Th erefore, there is no p articular
incentive, from an economic  viewpoint, to inv est in c ountermeasu res against such ageing
mech anisms,  and operators will try to ke ep th e costs involv ed as low as  possible.
Accordingly, there is a tendency of NPP  operators to r emain a t the two low er levels (reductions
of load, a nd of sa fety margins), and restrict ex change of components  to sm aller parts.
Exchan ge of large components h as been (and will be) practised extens ively only whe never the
remainin g (possibl y increased) lifetime was sufficient to amorti se the inv estment. For exam ple,
steam generators have been exch anged in nu clear pow er plants in mos t Western c ountries with
NPPs  with pr essurised water reactors, and re actor vessel heads a re being exch anged in France
and oth er countries.
The quantitative economic  evaluation of P LEX measu res is compli cated and depends on th e
concrete circums tances fo r each plant. I n several studies, subs tantial benefits are described. F or
example,  a US analyst recently claimed  that the costs of P LEX for a US nuclear power plant are
about 10 – 50 US$/k W, whereas construction of t he cheapest non -nuclear alternatives w ould
cost 325 – 405 U S$/kW. Life extens ion of a coal fired powe r plant, fo r 20 mor e operating years,
would c ost 100 – 250 U S$/kW [MA CDOUGA LL 1998].  New nu clear capacity would b e
considerably more expensiv e than al l those options ( far above 1000 US$/ kW).
Russian a uthors, quot ing US  sources from the late eighties, reported considerably higher costs
for PLEX meas ures: up to 300 U S$/kW [BARANENKO  1998].
A systematic study unde rtaken by the IAEA demonstrat es the large spread of c ost estimates for
PLEX. Based on r esponses to a  questionn aire, whi ch w ere received from NPP  operators in 12
   74 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

countries, the range is given as  120 – 680 US$  per kW. How ever, this re presents only the central
part of the various e stimate s; the probability of th e actual costs l ying below the low er value
given is 20 % , as well as the probabilit y of it being above the higher value. The cost d ata are
presented as ranges only in th e IAEA report because of d ata confidentiality due to the
competitive e nvironment  in the  electricity sector [IAEA 2002].
French Industry Secretary Pierret, advocating life extension fo r French reactors, stated tha t each
year of op eration be yond the nominal  30 y ears-lifetime  would b ring a gain of about 70 mil lion
US$ [NU CWEEK 47_00] . For the whol e French reactor fleet, 10 extr a years of lif e are reported
to represent a  cumulative cash flow of € 15 to 23 billi on [NUCWEEK 40_03].
Compared to this, th e cost of PL EX for one NPP according to th e low est estimate quot ed above
(10 – 15 million  US$) ap pears to be more th an reasonable; the higher limit  of the range given by
the IAEA, how ever, correspond s to costs of 650 to 900 m illion US$  per NPP , representing a
considerable inv estment  which would not b e wor thwhi le unless a bout two decades of a dditional
operating time  are guaranteed.
Taking into a ccount tha t a complete steam generator replacement  for a PWR alone costs a bout
150 to 200 million  US$  [EPRI 2003; K LIMAS 2003],  it seems plausibl e that the costs of PLEX
measu res in many cases will b e closer to the higher estimates quot ed ab ove.
Apart from those g eneral cost estimates, c oncrete cost figures have been publish ed fo r some
PLEX projects. F or example,  mode rnization of th e two Olki luoto B WRs for ten years’ life
extension is r eported to h ave cos t about € 130 mil lion [RA STAS 2003].  At P aks NPP,  20 y ears’
extension fo r the fou r VV ER units wi ll cost about € 700 mil lion [NU CWEEK 47_04].  For the
Ukrainian life extensions pl ans ( by 10 to 15 y ears), it is claimed  that they will b e about th ree to
four times less expen sive th an construction of new pl ants [ NUCWEEK 23_03] . Life extension
at the Kol a first-generation V VERs by 15 y ears cost about € 150 mil lion for both units
[NUCWEEK 33_04] .
Costs  of license extension  preparation a nd regulatory review fe es constitute only a
compar atively small, yet not n egligible, part of P LEX costs. For example,  for the two units of
Nine Mile Poi nt BWR  (USA) , they are estimated a t about US$  25 million  [NUCWEEK 48_03].
There are some  cases in whi ch ageing mech anisms  forced shut-down of a n NPP, because the
measu res of li fe exten sion whi ch would h ave been required w ere regarded as too costly by the
plant op erator. On e example,  Würgassen BWR  in G erman y, whe re shut -down e ven occurred
considerably earlier than the  design lifetime originally envisaged, is treated fu rther in t he
appendix  to this s ection.
Compared to n ew re actors like the Finnish EPR,  which w ill cost the utilit y TVO € 3 bi llion,  the
costs of modern ization m easures for PLEX appear almost modest.  Com pared to ot her, cheaper
alternatives lik e modern g as-fired pow er plants with inv estment  costs in the order of onl y 20 to
25 percent of t hose of a  new NPP , PLEX costs in th e order of € 100 m illion or more, on th e
other hand, ap pear quite subs tantial.
It is clear that PLEX therefore creates an economic  compulsion  to really operate the pl ant fo r the
whol e additional lifetime  envisaged, and possibl e beyond that – wit h all the hazards of
increasing ageing effects this e ntails. Onl y in case of “P LEX light” which would c orrespond to
the low est cost estimates quot ed above, economic  pressure would b e less ov erpow ering. This
implies,  how ever, that no o r only mini mal refurbishment  is und ertaken and hence, ageing
hazards wi ll be still higher than in no rmal PLEX cases.
Operational h azards and economic  pressure is increased fur ther if PLEX is c ombined  with
power uprating and other measures to economize  plant op eration.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 75

Power Uprating
Powe r uprating is an economicall y attractive option fo r NPP  operators that usua lly goes largely
unnoti ced by the publi c. It pays off particularly well when c ombined  with lif e extension.
Powe r uprating is practised in m ost countries wh ere NPP s are operated. Up grading turbines and
steam generators yielded an additional 4 %  of nu clear generating capacity in Spain b etween
1995 a nd 1997. Dur ing the last years, pow er uprating has continued in this c ountry. Powe r
output of th e Cofrent es BWR has been raised by about 11 %  at the beginning of 2003
[FORATOM  2004] . Capacity was increased by 600 MWe  in Swe den [VAR LEY 1998].
The outpu t of th e Finnish NPP  Olki luoto was boo sted by 18,3 %  [RA STAS 2003].  In Germany,
output of a  number o f plants w as increased. Unti l mid- 2004, powe r uprates amounted  to about
800 M We, or 4 %  of inst alled nu clear capacity. Anoth er 450 MW e are planned [DATF  2003;
ATW  2004].  Powe r uprating is also p ractised extensiv ely in th e USA. For exam ple, the output
of Ginn a PWR (at present, 495 M We), wh ere life extensi on is also pl anned, is to be  increased by
17 %  within five years. This seems to be  achieved with h ardly any costs for safety systems’
refurbishm ent, since the inv estment  costs per kWh are reduced ac cordingly [NUCWEEK
48_03].  Uprating measures are also implemented a t obsolete Soviet r eactor types. For example,
the for unit s of second -generation V VERs at Paks in H ungary are to be uprated from the (already
slightly increased) pow er level of a bout 470 M We to 510 M We [NUC WEEK 47_04].
In order to uprate the  electrical pow er of a  nuclear pow er plant, th ere are two opti ons (which are
often combined):
•At constant reactor power, thermal efficiency of th e plant is inc reased. T his is mos tly
achieved by optimising th e turbin es. Ope rational safety of th e plant remains on th e same
level.  Al so, replacement  of the  steam generators can increase efficiency if the new he at
exch angers have higher efficiency.
•Thermal pow er of the reactor is raised, us ually by increasing coolant temperature. Thus ,
more st eam is produced and th e reactor can produce more e lectricity via the turbines
(which have to b e modified  as well). An in crease of th ermal pow er implies  more nuclear
fissions a nd thus in creases op erational r isk. Also, higher loads to the  reactor materials are
unavoid able. There is g eneral consensus, that an inc rease of r eactor pow er reduces
operation al safety margins and at the same time accelerates ageing processes. 
The poss ibilities for pow er up rates through improvement  of th e thermal efficiency have, to a
large extent, a lready been realised in the last years. Thus , there is a trend tow ards up rates
through raising the reactor power. For exa mple,  all uprates planned tod ay in G erman y fall in to
the latter category.
Furthermore, in creasing the thermal power of a  reactor is regarded as a particularly cost-
effective w ay to increased electricity production [FRAMATOM E 2004] .
For PW Rs, reactor powe r is in creased by raising the average coolant temper ature, accompanied
by increasing the tempe rature rise in t he core. This le ads to d ecreasing safety margins: Corrosion
of fu el element hulls b ecomes more li kely and primary circuit p ressure will r each higher peaks
during transients. Furthermore, the radioactive inventor y in the reactor core is in creased
proportion ally to th e pow er uprate. Measures to c ontrol or mitigate critical situ ations b ecome
more diffi cult. For example, in case of c ontainment  ventin g, the venting rate has to be increased
[BORNEMANN  2001] .
Similar problems arise for pow er uprates of ot her reactor types. For exam ple, pow er uprating of
Quad City 2 BWR in the  U.S. lead to vib ration s of th e main  steam line, whi ch in t urn d amaged
other compone nts and necessitated se veral shut-downs a nd repairs [UCS 2004] .
   76 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Increasing the fuel bu rn-up ( i.e. getting more energy per ton of fu el) is another way in whi ch
NPP operators attempt to impr ove the econom y of th eir plants. This requires a correspondin g
increase of th e enrichme nt of th e fresh fu el.
The trend towa rds hi gher burn-up ha s started very early; in the last years, the efforts to increase
burn-up h ave been intensified. Sev eral decades ago, typical burn-up of P WR spent fu el was
around 30.000 MWd /t or slightly higher. Today, burn-ups o f 50.000 MWd/t  have been re ached
and 60.000 MWd/ t are aimed  for. Th e situation is si milar for BWR s, although at a slightly lower
level.
Increasing burn-up a lso increases th e hazard of fue l hull f ailure and hence, radioactive
contamination of th e cooling water. Fu rthermor e, the influ ence of high burn-up on th e behaviou r
of fu el rods und er accident co nditions i s not f ully understood.
The use of hi gh burn-up fu el can also reduce operation al safety margins. For example,  the
hazard of n eutron flux  oscillations in B WRs is in creased (s ee section A ).
Increased burn-up re duces the ma ss of sp ent fue l produced annually by a pow er reactor. On th e
other hand, h andli ng, transport, sto rage and dispos al of sp ent fuel b ecomes  more diff icult a nd
hazardous b ecause of h igher radiation int ensity, higher heat development and hi gher content of
long-lived actinide nuclides.
Regulators’ Perspective
Althou gh there is general consensus th at the main  responsibi lity for safe operation o f a nuclear
power plant lies with t he op erator, the regulatory authorities pl ay a very importan t role regarding
the safety standards uph eld in different c ountries, and th e level of h azard regarded as acceptable.
Therefore, the regulators’ perspective and the problems nuclear regulators are faced with
regarding ageing and life extension  deserve to b e discussed here. Unl ess ind icated oth erwise,
this s ection is b ased on a  recent report by the OE CD Nuc lear Energy Agency’s Committee on
Nuclear Regulatory Activiti es, whi ch primarily consists of s enior nuclear regulators from many
countries [CNRA 2001].
Nuclear regulatory practice varies co nsiderably between countries. This holds p articularly true
concerning regulation of ag eing and lif e extensi on.
To begin wi th, some countries (for exa mple,  the USA  and Finland) issu e operating licenses for a
fixed  period of time.  In Switzerl and, t here are limited  licenses for some  pow er plants and not for
others. Mos t countries, how ever, issue licenses tha t are basically indefinite, subject to c ontinu ed
safe operation of th e plant.
Periodic safety reviews play an increasingly import ant role, particularly in countries with
indefinite licenses, to justif y further operation. In this r espect, too, there are considerable
variations b etween countries. Th ere is divergence in th e extent of do cumenta tion and oth er
information  that has to be  suppl ied by the operator. Th ere are also differences in the extent to
which th e regulatory authority carries out an inde pendent e valuation of th e safety case.
Practices also v ary widely regarding development  and upd ating of rules and regulations. I n all
countries, regulation is mos tly based on d eterministic methods  and cr iteria. The importance of
probabilistic methods , howeve r, is g rowing. In some  countries, they are already formally
integrated into the licensing process, wh ereas regulators in oth er countries remain more
sceptical.
One fairly com mon feature of r egulatory approaches worldwide is that regulators usu ally review
the entire design basis of a  plant in o rder to decide whi ch safety improvements  can be required
and expe cted from the ope rator. Eve n in this r espect, how ever, there is a notable exc eption: T he
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 77

license renewal process in th e United St ates foc uses on th e detrimental e ffects of ageing and
does no t review th e current licensin g basis of a  plant.
In spite of thi s heterogeneous picture, there are a numbe r of problems which regulators are
facing all over the world. Th e most  basic and severe sho rtcoming of re gulatory practice
everywhere is that no c ountry has a comprehensiv e set of te chnical criteria for deciding when
further operation o f a nuclear pow er plant can no lon ger be permitted.
A generally valid principle is that the licensin g basis of a plant is to b e maint ained thr oughout its
life. In addition, a few countries (for exa mple, Swit zerland) have the explicit requirement that
nuclear plants should c onform to th e state-of-the-art in s cience and te chnolo gy. In many other
countries, this requirement is implicit  in th e regulatory approach. T his criterion i s regarded as
potentially very onerous. Th e extent to whi ch it is p racticable for older plants g enerally requires
a very difficult jud gement f rom regulatory authorities.
In practice, backfitting of modern r equirements to o lder NPPs  is on ly demanded by the
regulators to t he extent that it i s “reasonabl y practicable”, taking into a ccount sa fety gains and
costs, as the respons es to a  questionnai re circulated by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency show .
Of course, this fo rmula  leaves considerable leeway for interpretation a nd compromises.
Generally, deviation s from modern st andards a re evaluated by regulators on a  pragmatic, case-
by-case basis.
The trend towa rds in creasing use of pr obabilistic methods  also constitu tes a problem for
regulators. Prob abilistic an alyses are increasingly used as regulatory tools. Howev er, regulators
are mos tly unwil ling to a ccept that p robabilistic arguments a lone shoul d be sufficient to r everse
licensing decisions taken on d eterministic  grounds. This may become  more a nd more
contentious as plant op erators attempt  to ma ke arguments, on th e basis of probabilisti c
assessme nts, about wh at is reasonably practicable for them regarding backfitting of older plants.
Anoth er difficult t ask fo r regulators is to contribute to ensuring that there is a continuin g suppl y
of compet ent personne l to op erate and m aintain old er plants whe re design details, t echnical
limits  etc. may be less well documented th an fo r mode rn one s. Th is problem can be exa cerbated
by the gradual retirement  of pl ant d esigners as well as operators that were working at the plant
from start-up.
Impact of Electricity M arket Rest ructuring
The most  severe problem regulators are facing, however, very likely results f rom the re-
structuring and pr ivatisation of el ectrical utiliti es occurring worldwide. T his development  exerts
considerable pressure on t he op erators’ safety culture and manag ement of safety. Regarding this
issue, it is well wo rth letting the conclusions of th e nuclear regulators constituting the OECD
NEA ’s Co mmittee on Nu clear Regulatory Activities sp eak for  themselves (emphasi s added by
the authors):
 “The rapidl y-changing  economi c and industrial en vironments in m any countri es over the pas t
few years had pr esented major c hallenges to bo th the nuclear op erators and t he regulators. I n
the privatised and d eregulat ed situations  that now  existed (or wer e com ing int o being) in man y
countries, the op erators were acutel y aware o f the pote ntial lifetimes  and long-t erm
profitab ility of their plants when maki ng decisions abou t upgrading, undertaking  PSRs
[Periodic Safety Reviews] or appl ying for formal  licence renewals.  Plant  manage ment was
under  incr easing  pressure to f ind the c orrect balanc e between operating the plant  safely and
not spending  money u nnecessarily. The re gulatory challenge was  to find appropriat e ways to
check and monit or this without  interfering undul y in th e licensee's busin ess. The impa ct of
safety culture, safety manage ment, and th e competence and l evel of staff ing on th e safety of
NPPs  will continue to d emand c onsiderable regulator y attention.
   78 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Anoth er challenge to r egulators, in th e new environment, is to find a l ogical way to d eal with
requests f rom operators for relief from some  of the existing  regulatory c onstraints.  This is a
sensiti ve regulatory issue that can easily generate public and  politi cal suspi cion, if not
handled  openly and  prop erly. How ever, a s elected increase in th e appar ent level of risk may b e
acceptable by som e regulator s if re search or op erating experience allow the uncertainty in th e
risk ass essment to b e reduced, to the  extent tha t the realistic safety mar gins are still sufficient to
cover the remaining un certainty. The in creasing us e, and wider a cceptabilit y of, ris k-infor med
regulations may help to c larify such de cision-m aking. ( It is recomm ende d that C NRA  should
have an in- depth e xchange  of experience on t his topic at a futur e meeting).”
In view of a ll thos e problems, the goal set by the Swiss  nuclear regulatory authority [TIPPING
2003]  appears to be rather unrealisti c:
“Generall y, from a nucl ear regulator’ s standpoint, plant  lifetime m anag ement str ategies
practised b y operators must a t least c ontribut e to main taining presentl y existing s afety levels by
ensuring th e suitability of al l aspects of NPP  operation ( …). Ideally, lifetime manag ement
strategies should al so be instrumental in i ncreasing overall saf ety levels of N PPs.”
Indeed, increasing safety is more l ikely to remain a n dream, rather than an ideal whi ch can
realistically be achieved, in view of ma ssive e conomic  pressure and other problems facing
nuclear regulators wo rldwide.
Conclusions
From the discussion above, it is c lear that nu clear operators are faced with a  dilemma which is
gets more and mor e pressing the lon ger a nuclear power plant is op erating and ageing
mech anisms  become virulent: Measures fo r life ext ension ( as well as power uprating) on th e one
hand ca n be economica lly attractive and of fer a chance to improve th e overall ec onomic  balance
of NPP  operation. On t he oth er hand, th ey exacerbate the hazards of a geing and inc rease the risk
of a nuclear catastrophe with s evere radioactive releases.
With  very few exc eptions, it appears the economy triumphs  over safety and PLEX programmes
are implemented. T he situation is p articularly grave since such a programme generally can onl y
make e conomic  sense fo r plant own ers if the  plant is op erated for one or two more d ecades after
its implementation.
PLEX me asures certainly compar e favou rably, from an economic  point of vi ew, with the
construction of new nu clear pow er plants. B ut this is by no means tr ue for comparison with
other alternatives, lik e the construction of mode rn gas-fired plants.
PLEX therefore creates strong pressure to k eep an NPP  on the  grid, to g et an adequate return on
the inv estment, and to i gnore or play down the hazards of ageing. This pressure is strengthened
if further mone y has been spe nt on pow er uprating. In addition, th ere is p ressure to keep
expens es for PLEX programmes as low as possible.
All this is h appening in an economic  context of lib eralisation of th e energy economy, general
cost pressure and in creasing competition, which is l eading to decreasing safety margins,
personnel reductions an d reduced efforts for insp ection a nd ma intenance – wh ereas the trend
towards an ageing NPP  popul ation would r equire exactly the opposit e.
At th e same time,  safety margins are further reduced by pow er uprating and in creasing fuel bu rn-
up.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 79

Examples of Age Related Problems
In this a ppendix,  some  examples  for nuclear plants with a geing problems which le d to
decomm issioning,  or to pr olonged shutdown p eriods are presented.
Yanke e Rowe PWR (USA, 185 M We) was permanen tly shut  dow n in February 1992, af ter only
about 31 y ears of op eration.
Ironically, Yankee Row e was to b e the U.S.  lead plant for license renewal to obt ain lif e
extension f rom 40 to 60 y ears. The license renewal procedure was started early because it w as
the first attempt of this kind. Review of the  safety case for the reactor pressure vessel showed
that embri ttlement of th e weld near the core had already reached a critical stage, mainl y because
of high content o f copper impur ities.
The operator tempora rily shut down th e plant in O ctober 1991, two da ys before the U.S.NR C
would h ave ordered a shutdown. A petition of t he Union of Conc erned Sci entists h ad prompted
the NRC
A programme of reactor pressure vessel testin g and analyses was under consid eration, wit h the
aim to demonstrat e sufficient safety margins af ter all. This six month  programme  was exp ected
to cost US$  23 million.  However, the plant’s own er, Yankee Atomic  Electric Compan y,
declared th at thos e costs were too great, particularly in vi ew of th e fact that the  path le ading to
restart of the plant wa s not suf ficiently clear. Yankee Atomic  emphas ized that the shut-down
was exclu sively motivated b y economic,  not s afety concerns [WEISSMANN  1992].
This c laim, how ever, does not ap pear credible in vi ew o f the compar atively low c osts me ntioned
above. It is more th an likely that the pl ant owne rs kn ew it would no t be possible to c onstruct a
credible safety case, and he nce decided on a  shut -dow n without a ttempting fu rther analyses.
Würgassen BWR  (German y, 670 MWe)  was permanently shut down in M ay 1995, a fter less
than 24 y ears of op eration.
During the overall ma intena nce insp ections b eginning August 1994, sp ecial inspections of the
core shroud w ere performed  in addition to r outine ins pections, because cracks had been found in
this c omponent  in 13 boilin g water reactors in oth er countries. Th e Würg assen core shroud wa s
found to b e severely cracked.
Repairing the core shroud plus th e necessary accompan ying backfits and mode rnization
measu res would h ave cost DM 350 – 400 million  (about € 220 million  at 2004 v alue). The  plant
owner, PreussenElektra, decided against performing th e repairs and decommissioned  the pl ant
[JATW 1995 ; NNI 1995].
Davis B esse PWR (USA,  925 M We) was tempora rily shut down af ter a hole was dis covered in
the reactor pressure vessel head on M arch 6, 2002. The  reactor was off th e grid for more than
two y ears and restarted on Ap ril 8, 2004.
The hol e went through the w hole thickness of th e vessel head; onl y the stainless steel lin er
welded to i ts inner surface was still int act. This liner (less than 5 m m thick) was the last
remainin g barrier to prevent a severe loss-of-coolant a ccident. I t had already bulged by about 3
mm unde r the high pressure in th e RPV.
Unnoti ced, this incident h ad begun 1990, w hen a crack had developed in the  nozz le of a control
rod drive me chanism  (CRDM). Over the years, the crack grew through the nozz le, boric acid
leaked out a nd a corrosive attack on the  outside of th e vessel head begun. Onc e opened, th e hol e
widened by nearly 50 m m per year. Nevertheless, it w as ov erlooke d at visual insp ections in 1998
and 2000.
   80 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Cracks in CR DM nozzles  have been observed wo rldwid e since 1991. I n 1993, G reenpeace
International petition ed the  U.S.NR C to require inspections of CRDM  nozzles  at all U.S.
reactors. Thos e inspections v ery likely would h ave lead to a n early identification of th e problems
at Davis B esse (as well as at other plants). Howev er, it was denied in 1994 [U CS 2002] .
Total costs for the  shut -down, in cluding replacement pow er costs, w ere about US$  600 mil lion.
From the NRC,  Davis B esse is now li censed unt il Apr il 2017 in s pite of the serious l ack of
safety culture whi ch had be come  apparent at the plant, wh ere a problem was allowed to g row for
12 years.
Stade PWR (Germany, 662 M We) was pe rman ently shut down in Nov ember 2003, aft er less
than 32 y ears of op eration, although the amount  of electricity assigned to th is plant b y the
German Atomic  Law (revision of 2001 ) had not b een produc ed yet.
Similar to th e situ ation a t Yankee Rowe, c ritical welds in th e Stad e reactor pressure vessel we re
particularly prone to embr ittlement  due to a  high coppe r content. T his had been known fo r man y
years, but expe rts from the TÜV, th e technical suppo rt organisation wo rking for the sup ervising
authority, kept c onfirming tha t a sufficient s afety margin existed fo r 40 y ears of op eration.
In the early 90s, th e sup ervising authority (Minist ry for the Environment  of the St ate of L ower
Saxon y) commissioned another technical organisation, G ruppe  Ökolo gie Hannov er, to look into
the embrit tlement situation. In 1994, th e new experts submitted  their results th at showed th at
operation o f the NPP was only safe, at most, for about on e more year.
Under pressure from the plant op erator PreussenElektra, the state authority did not f urther
emplo y Gruppe Ökolo gie. Und er leadership of TÜV ( an organisation which had ov erlooked the
critical situation fo r man y years to begin with) , an urgent investigation p rogramme  was started.
Given th e circumstanc es, it is not sur prising that after hectic wo rk 1995 t o 1997, to TÜV exp erts
mana ged to c onfirm the safety case of Stad e RPV  after all.
In 2003, Stad e was shut down; so f ar, the onl y NPP which has been decommissioned  since the
red/green coalition c ame to pow er in G ermany 1998 whos e goal it is to g radually phase-out
nuclear pow er. Und er the G erman  Atomic  Law, Stade would still h ave been permitted  to
continu e electricity production. Th e plant owner emphasize d that the reasons fo r the shut -dow n
were entirely economic  – the capacity of Stad e was too small,  it was claime d, for economic
operation. Ho wever, the old er Obrigheim PWR with onl y half of Stad e’s capacity is still in
operation. O wners even transferred an addition al amount  of electricity to this P WR from
another, newer plant. H ence, it might b e a good guess that Stade in f act was prematurely shut
down b ecause of em brittlement  problems.
Thos e examples  clearly show th at there are significant sa fety problems due to a geing at
“western” reactors, and th at they are not a lways dealt with rigorously and efficiently by the
respons ible authorities.
There are very severe ageing problems at man y “eastern” reactors, too. H owev er, the situ ation is
more c omplic ated for  the ex-S oviet reactor types. Ageing problems and general design and
construction deficiencies are usually closely interwoven. F urthermore, ap art from small  plants,
militar y production re actors and early protot ypes, eastern reactors mostl y were onl y
decomm issioned  in case of se vere pressure from the West  (Chernobyl-1 to - 3, Ignalina-1,
Kozlodu y-1 and -2 and A rmenia -1) and th ere is no c lear-cut ca se stud y for a plant b eing shut
down b ecause of on e particular technical issue. Th e VVERs at Greifswald which c ame unde r the
supervision of th e Federal Republi c of G erman y after reunification c onstitute a notable
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 81

exception; these were shut down qui ckly by German  authorities, again because of a  multitude of
shortcoming s (see also section A ).
It has to b e not ed, how ever, that pressure vessel embrittlement  probably was the single most
important s afety issue in case of G reifsw ald-1 to - 4 as well as the Kozlodu y VVER-440s.

D.1.i: Acts of Terror ism and War – Vulnerability of Nuclear Power
plants
The Terror Threat
Long before Sept ember 11, 2001, numerous d eliberate acts of terrorism have taken pl ace in th e
20th century. The terrorist th reat appears to be  particularly great, how ever, in th e early 21st
century. The overall situation, whi ch is d etermined b y economic,  military, ideological and
politi cal factors, cannot b e discussed a nd evaluated here.
It is important, how ever, to not e the followin g: Althoug h general attention i s focussed on t he
threat from the dir ection o f Islamic funda mentalism  right now , there are, worldwid e, man y
different ideological positi ons and organisations fr om which pot ential terrorists c ould be
recruited. F or example,  the bom bing of a  buildi ng of th e U.S.  federal governme nt in Okl ahom a
on Ap ril 19, 1995, w hich killed 169 p eople and inj ured mor e than 500, w as committed by
Ameri can extremis ts of the  right [THOM PSON  1996].  At p resent, the growing threat of N eo-
Nazi terrorism in G ermany also illust rates this point [FR 2005b, c].
There are numerous pot ential targets for terrorist attacks. Industrial ins tallations, offi ce buil dings
in city centres or filled spo rts stadium  can appear “attractive”, if a  terrorist g roup plans to kill a s
many human  beings as possible in on e attack. A nu clear pow er plant (NPP),  on th e other hand,
could b e selected as target for on e of th e followin g reasons, o r a combination  of thos e reasons:
1.Because of th e symbolic character – nu clear pow er can be seen a s the epitome  of
technol ogical developme nt, as typical “high-tech”. Furthermore, i t is a technolo gy of an
ambi guous c ivilian/mil itary nature. Ma ny people therefore regard it as potentially very
hazardous – jus tifiably so. Th erefore, attacks against nu clear pow er plants can have a
particularly strong psychological impact.
2.Because of th e long-term effects – an  attack can lead to f ar-reaching radioactive
contamination with lon g-lived radio-nuclides. Th e state that is b eing attacked will b ear
the mark of d estruction for a long time. Furthermore, th ere wil l be economic  damage for
decades. L arge areas (cities, indust rial complexe s) will have to b e evacuated fo r an
indefinite period, whi ch could destabilize entire regions.
3.Because of th e immediate e ffects on th e electricity generation in the region affected –
nuclear pow er plants are, wherever they are operated, large and centralised components
of the electricity supply system. Th e sudden shutdown of su ch a large plant can possibl y
lead to a collapse of the  local electricity grid.
4.Because of th e longer-term effects on e lectricity generation, not onl y in th e affected
region, bu t also in oth er regions ( possibly even in a ll states where nuclear pow er plants
are operated) – a successful attack against a nuclear pow er plant in on e country is also an
attack against all nuclear pow er plants in th e world [BRAUN  2002].  After such an  attack
has demons trated the vuln erability of an  NPP,  it is pos sible that oth er NPPs  will be shut
down in th e country affected, but a lso in ot her countries.
There are also co nceivable reasons, f rom the point of vi ew o f a terrorist group, a gainst a nuclear
power plant as  target: A nu clear installation c an be less vuln erable than ot her targets;
radiological damage could o ccur in l arge distances in non -enemy countries; and th e attacked
country could react with extreme violence [THOM PSON 2005].  There seems to be no c hance,
however, to es timate probabilities that certain targets would b e attacked, or  not. I t is clear and
undisput ed th at a terror attack against a nuclear pow er plant is possible; and also, th at the re are
many types of other targets for such at tacks as well.
   86 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Terror-attacks ag ainst nuclear power plants c an be performed with a large variety of means. I t is
not possibl e to list a ll conceivable scenarios s ince it is absolut ely impossible  to anticipate all
products of human  fantasy. Since Sept ember 11, 2001, a uthorities have been focussi ng on
airplane suicide attacks. How ever, totally different sc enarios are also pl ausible.
In principle, attacks c an vary with r espect to th e me ans being used, th e concrete target, the
organisation, number a nd effort of t he attackers as well as other factors. For each of tho se
variables, th ere are man y possibiliti es of implementation.  Even th e attempt  to complet ely list
what is foreseeable therefore would lead to a  matrix  with a  large number of di fferent sc enarios.
Therefore, some  exam ples only will be presented here, to show th e div ersity of th e threat. Thos e
examples  will in clude scenarios th at, so fa r, have hardly received attention in th e expe rt and
publi c debates.
Terror attacks against nu clear plants are not pu rely theoretical. In the past, a number of su ch
attacks h ave already taken pl ace. Luckily, they did not le ad to a  catastrophi c radioactive release
so far. A few examples can illustrate the record [COEY TAUX  2001; T HOMPSON  1996;
NISSIM 2004; T MI 2005; N UCWEEK  46_94]:
•On 12 Nov ember 1972, thr ee hijackers took c ontrol of a  DC-9 of Southe rn Air lines and
threatened to c rash it on th e Oak Rid ge military nuclear research reactor. The  hijackers
flew on to Cub a after they obtained two mil lion dollars.
•Decembe r 1977: Ba sque separatists s et off bombs  damaging the reactor vessel an d a
steam generator and killing two wo rkers at the Lemoniz  NPP  under construction in
Spain.
•Decembe r 1982: A NC guerrilla fighters set off f our bom bs inside th e Ko eberg plant
under construction in South  Africa, despit e tight security.
•May 1986 : three of th e fou r off-site pow er lines leading to th e Palo V erde NPP  in
Arizona w ere sabotaged by short-circuitin g.
•February 1993: At Th ree Mil e Island NPP  (Pennsylvania), a man  crashed his station
wagon through the security gate and ramm ed the vehicle und er a partly opened doo r in
the turbine buildi ng. Security guards found hi m hidin g in tha t buildi ng four hou rs later.
•In 1993, th e terrorists b ehind th e car bombing a gainst the World Trade Centre, belonging
to the terrorist n etwo rks th at claimed  to be part of the Islamic jihad, th reatened to t arget
nuclear sites in a  letter received by the New Yo rk Times  and authenticated by the
authorities. In addition, t he inv estigation is s aid to h ave revealed tha t the terrorist g roup
trained in N ovember 1992 i n a camp near Harrisbu rg, in Pennsylvania 15 km  away from
the Three Mile Island nuclear pow er station.
•Novembe r 1994: B omb threat at Ignalina NPP , Lithuania. How ever, no explosion
occurred and no bomb  was found in th e pow er plant.
Acts of War
Milit ary action a gainst nuclear installations c onstitutes another danger deserving special
attention in th e present g lobal situation. Sinc e the fall of the  Iron Curt ain, the re is an  increasing
tendency towards “ small”, regionally restricted w ars of lon g duration. Thos e wars can be
connected with the falling apart of a large state; or with e fforts of groups in a  popul ation to
achieve independence [MÜNKLER 2003].  The reasons for terror attacks list ed above could, in
such a war, moti vate one of th e conflict parties to attack a nuclear plant.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 87

Wars  of int ervention are another form of wa rlike conflict. They can occur as a consequence of a
regional war of long duration, a s mentioned a bove. In the course of su ch w ars, countries attack a
state from which em anates a real or alleged threat. The  political goals and int erests of the
attacking states usually play an important role in thi s case. If there are nuclear plants in th e
attacked country, there is th e risk that thos e could b e damaged unint ention ally during the
fighting. Furthermore, an intervening pow er might a ttack pow er plants to p aralyze electricity
suppl y in th e attacked country. There would b e efforts to a void radioactive releases. Be cause of
the compact layout of th e individu al parts of a nuclear pow er plant, how ever, safety relevant
installations might n evertheless be damaged. Also, in t imes of w ar, the electrical suppl y system
might c ollapse without di rect attacks a gainst pow er plants. In combinati on w ith further
destruction of inf rastructure, this , too, c ould in th e end lead to in cidents or accidents in nu clear
power plants, with c onsequences for the surroundin gs.
It is also conceivable tha t nuclear plants, which se rve milita ry purpose s or are feared to s erve
such pu rposes, will b e deliberately destroyed. In this c ase, the release of ra dioactive materials
might b e accepted by the attacker.
In June  1981, a  large (40 M Wth)  research reactor und er construction a t the Tuw aitha research
centre in I raq was destroyed by the Israeli air force because of I sraeli fears that the reactor could
be used (d irectly or indir ectly) for a nuclear arsenal. Du ring the 1991 Gulf Wa r, two smalle r
reactors at the same site were destroyed in a night attack by U.S. aircraft [THOM PSON 1996].
Threats through acts of w ar cannot b e exclud ed in a ny region. Du ring the Balkan confli cts in th e
early 90s, th e Sloveni an nu clear pow er plant Kr ško w as endangered several times.  In June  1991,
three fighter bombe rs of the Yu goslavian air force flew ov er the plant. The re was no at tack;
however, thi s act clearly constituted a warnin g. In Sept embe r 1991, wa r again approached th e
Sloveni an bo rder. Th ere was fighting in the  surroundin gs of Z agreb, whi ch could e asily have
spread to Sl ovenian territory [HIRSCH  1997] .
In case of a warlike conflict, commando attacks might o ccur in c ombination  with acts of w ar
(performed  by special forces active behind e nemy lines, or by a “fifth c olumn”). This d anger is
particularly high in c ase of an asymmetric war – wh ere an enemy attacks a much  weaker
country, for exam ple during a war of int ervention-. Scruples about a ctions mos tly directed
against the enemy’s civilian popu lation, might b e drastically reduced if th e attacked country has
no oth er options o f hitting back against an all-pow erful e nemy, and/or has already suffered
severe civilian lo sses itself.
The use of nu clear weapon s against nuclear pow er plants (through terrorist or mili tary attack)
will not b e discussed here. Ho wever, it should b e mentioned th at the de struction of a  nuclear
power plant co uld si gnificantly increase the radioactive contamination  produc ed by a nuclear
fission w eapon – th e fission pr oduct inv entory of a commercial nu clear pow er plant is in the
order of ma gnitude of 1000 times  that released by a fission w eapon.
Targets, and Their Vulnerability
Of all nuclear plants a nd ot her facilities with toxi c inventories, such as chemical factories,
nuclear pow er plants are probably the most  “attractive“ targets for terrorist or militar y attacks.
They are wide-spread (at least in a  number of indust rialized countries), contain a  consid erable
radioactive inv entory and are, as already pointed out , important c omponents  of th e electricity
suppl y system. F urthermore, they are large buildin gs with a  typical structure, visibl e even over
large distances.
The area of a nuclear pow er plant co nsists of se veral tens of thous ands of squ are me ters. The
core piece of th e installation i s the reactor buildin g, whi ch, a s the name indicates, contains th e
   88 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

reactor with th e highly radioactive nuclear fuel (in the order of ma gnitud e of 100 tonn es), as well
as important c ooling and safety systems.
It is lik ely that the reactor building will b e the primary target in case of an attack. If the reactor is
operating as the attack occurs, and if th e cooling is int errupted, a core melt  can result withi n a
very short time  (about 1 hou r). Even if th e reactor is shut down, th e decay heat is still
considerable, and the  fuel will also m elt – although somewh at slower.
In case of destruction of th e reactor building with f ailure of th e coolin g systems, a  core melt
accident of th e most  hazardous c ategory results: R apid melting with op en containment. The
resulting radioactive releases will be particularly high, and occur particularly early.
The spent fuel sto rage pool i s another vuln erable component  with c onsiderable radioactive
inventory. In som e plants, it can contain se veral times the amount  of fu el (and thus mor e long-
lived ra dioactive sub stances) than th e reactor core itself. In some  nuclear power plants, this pool
is located ins ide the containment  and is protected against exte rnal impacts by a concrete hull ( for
example  in G erman  pressurized wa ter reactors). In many cases, how ever, the pool is ins talled in
a separate bui lding with l ess p rotection (this applies to man y U.S.  nuclear pow er plants). The
pool in G erman  boiling water reactors of generation 69 i s located insid e the  reactor building, bu t
above the containment,  and protected to a  consid erably lesser degree than th e reactor.
Apart from the reactor build ing and, if a pplicable, the buildin g with the  spent fu el pool, th ere are
further buildings and inst allation o f varying safety significance. The  mos t importan t are, in c ase
of a modern p ressurized w ater reactor (PWRs, including VVERs, account fo r about 60 %  of the
world’s op erating plants):
•Switch gear buildin g   wit h control room and central electric and electroni c inst allations
•Auxiliar y building with ins tallations fo r water purification and ventilation
•Machine hall wi th turbine and generator
•Transformer station with c onnection to grid and st ation tr ansformer
•Emer gency pow er build ing with em ergency diesel uni ts and chilled w ater system
•Emer gency feed bui lding with ins tallation s for eme rgency feeding of steam generators
(i.e. cooling of reactor via the secondary cooling circuit), with r emote shutdown st ation
•Off-gas stack
•Workshop building with st aff am enities
•Coolin g tow ers (if required)
•Buildin g for coolin g water intake and disc harge
The situ ation i s similar fo r a boili ng water reactor. How ever, the re is no eme rgency feed
buildin g in this case, sin ce BWR s have onl y one coolin g circuit and thus, no st eam generators.
Instead of th e eme rgency feed bui lding, some BWRs are suppl ied wit h an eme rgency standb y
buildin g with an emergency control room permitti ng control of th e most  vital safety function s.
So far, not al l nuclear pow er plants h ave been spe cially designed against exte rnal, huma n-made
impacts ( for example  aircraft crash). In the case of t hose th at have been, a n impa ct in on e spot
only has been assumed  (correspondi ng, for exam ple, to the crash of a  small  militar y aircraft).
Spati al separation of s afety relevant inst allations w as the most  impor tant counter measure. This
should g uarantee that onl y one inst allation vi tal for safety could b e destroyed by an impact – a
situation wh ere compensation is possibl e. Fo r exam ple, in case of f ailure of the auxiliar y pow er
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 89

suppl y via the correspondi ng transfo rmer, the emergency pow er suppl y with diesel generators
can be activated.
Even if the reactor build ing remains int act in c ase of a n attack, it is st ill possi ble fo r the situation
to get out o f control, if more th an one  safety relevant installation of th e plant is destroyed. This
can happen even in c ase of sp atial separation of important c omponents,  if th e attack has effects
that are spread ov er on th e site.
For example,  in case of th e simultaneous f ailure of pow er suppl y from the grid (via station
transformer) and eme rgency pow er suppl y, there are no more c oolant pumps  operable. In case of
simultaneous d estruction o f control r oom and eme rgency feed building (emergency standby
buildin g), a situation c ould a rise wh ere the safety system re quired are still op erable, but c annot
be controlled any more. F ar-reaching destruction on t he pl ant a rea can furthermore have the
effect that a ccess by personn el, and thu s eme rgency meas ures and repairs, are rendered
impossible  – at least not with in the required time span of a  few hou rs.
Destruction of th e coolin g water intake building alone already has the effect that all cooling
chains o f the pow er plant ar e interrupted. How ever, a critical situation is slow to de velop in this
case, sin ce there are various w ater reservoirs av ailable at the pl ant a rea. Thus, there is time  for
improvised measu res – unl ess those a re hind ered by further destructions at the site.
Regarding other nuclear inst allations o r nuclear transports as targets, see the other sub-sections
of section D.1.
Conceivable Attack Scenarios
As point ed out ab ove, the public debate tends to c oncentrate on sui cide attacks with a
commerci al airliner sin ce Sept ember 9, 2001. I n fact, th e threat is m uch more div erse and
complex.
In the followin g, various possibiliti es fo r terror attacks on NPPs  are listed, as  examples . Almost
all of the m could a lso take place in time s of w ar, com mitted by com mando  troops o r a fifth
column.  Some of the scenarios co uld b e impleme nted, with minor changes, in th e course of
militar y operations.
Attack from the air:
Deliberate crash of c omme rcial airliner, freight plane or one or several busin ess jets
(possibly loaded with explosives )
Deliberate crash of a  helicopter loaded with explosives, o r droppin g a bomb  from
helicopter
Attack by military plane (with bombs  and/or other weapons ), pos sibly combined with
deliberate crash of mil itary plane
Deliberate crash of a  pilot -less ai rcraft (drone) loaded with explosives
Attack from the water:
Crash o f boat loaded with explosives into c oolin g water intake structures from sea or
river;
Deliberate explosion  of gas tanker close to NPP
Firing on pl ant from a distance:
Shellin g with field howitzer, with explosive grenades (from ground or water)
Firing with a rmour -piercing weapons (r ockets), from ground, w ater or from the air
   90 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Intrusion of a ttackers onto plant ar ea:
Use of on e or more car bomb(s)
Intrusion of a rmed attackers, carrying explosives, f rom land o r water
Intrusion of a rmed attackers, carrying explosives, b y helicopter or ultralight aircraft 
Attacks involvi ng insid ers:
Insiders suppo rt attack from outsid e, for exa mple  through creation of co nfusion,
obstruction o f counter measu res or simultaneous at tack from insid e
Explosives  are being smug gled on th e site and into bui ldings; are exploded in safety-
relevant sectors
A knowl edgeable group of insid ers directly intervenes in the op eration of th e plant,
triggering a severe accident
Insiders perform sabotage during repair and maint enance
Armed  mem bers of the security personn el perform an attack from the ins ide or support
an attack from outside
Attacks a gainst inst allation s located out side th e plant p erimete r:
Attack against the  cooling water intake buildin g of a nuclear pow er plant from the water
(with boa ts, possibly divers), usin g explosives
Attack against the  grid connection of a  nuclear powe r plant (or other nuclear plants), for
example  by blowin g up pow er connections, an d against on-site pow er supply (emergency
diesels etc.)
Not a ll nuclear plants a re vuln erable to the  same ext ent. Most a ttack opti ons listed he re can lead,
in the wo rst case, to v ery severe releases. Some  will h ave rather limited  effects. Different p arts
of a plant c an be vuln erable to dif ferent mode s of attack to a  different extent.
How ever, all these aspects will no t be discussed in d etail here. It is not th e intention of th e
authors to p rovid e “useful” info rmation to terrorists o r mili tary planners, whi ch could be used
for the pl annin g of attacks.
Consequences of an Attack on a Nuclear Power Plant
One example,  from the lon g list of po ssible scenarios, will be disc ussed in more d etail here –
shelling of a  nuclear pow er plant. Such a n attack can lead to a reactor accident of th e most
severe category: Core melt  with early containme nt failure. It would b e more e ffective than an
attack with a rmour - or concrete-piercing missiles.
A possibl e scenario would b e shelling with a 15.5 cm-howitze r, transported by road, as part of
militar y operations o r as terror attack. Almost every army of the  world tod ay poss ess suc h a
weapon; it is conceivable that terrorists are able to a cquire one. A 15.5 cm -howit zer can be
brought to th e vicinity of an NPP  under camoufl age; it ca n be made r eady to fi re within minutes.
If shelling takes place from a distance of 12 to 15 km,  an area of about 50 m  x 50 m  on th e site
can be hit several time s. If the dis tance is smalle r and w eather condit ions a re favou rable,
accuracy will be signifi cantly increased. Mul tiple hits of th e reactor buildin g are possibl e.
If high-explos ive shells are used, th e reactor buil ding will be partly destroyed. Severe damage
will o ccur inside. Plant personn el wi ll be kill ed or inju red. At th e site area, shots which are
slightly off-target will create further devastation. This c an be deliberately enhanced by the use of
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 91

fire shells and oth er types of munit ions. It will be extr emely difficult to imple ment  effective and
rapid c ounter measu res.
With in a few hou rs, core melt will occur, with s evere releases of r adioactivity. The amount
released to th e atmosphe re can be about 50 – 90 %  of the radioactive invento ry of vol atile
nuclides like iodi ne and caesium,  plus a few percents of fu rther nuclides like stronti um-90. In
case of a  nuclear pow er plant with 1000 M W electric pow er, this c orresponds, amon g oth ers, to
several 100.000 T era-Becquerel (TBq) of C s-137 [ HAHN  1999],  compa red to a bout 85.000 T Bq
Cs-137 a t Chernob yl [NEA  1996].
The consequences amount  to a catastroph e with e ffects ov er a large region: Up to 10.000 km2
would h ave to b e evacuated in t he sho rt term. There would b e up to 15.000 a cute radiation
deaths a nd up to 1 mil lion cancer deaths, as well as uncount ed cases of g enetic damag e. The area
that would b e contaminated in th e lon g term to a degree necessitating relocation of th e
popul ation c an mea sure up to 100.000 km2. The economic dama ge has been estimated at  about
6.000 billion Eu ros [HAHN  1999].
For many reactors, the probabilit y of destruction or severe damage of the spent fuel pool is hi gh.
In this c ase, releases can be several times  thos e given above, with c orrespond ingly more severe
consequences.
During a certain p eriod of time,  intervention c ould b e possibl e to p rovide cooling of th e fuel. If
the pool c oolin g system fa ils because of th e attack an d water gradually boils off, it wil l take
between one and ten days (depending on a mount  and co oling times  of th e spent fuel in the pool )
until th e tops of the fu el elements  are exposed. I f the pool i s damaged and the wa ter drains off,
this point, of c ourse, can be reached much  faster. Onc e the fuel is expos ed, radiation shi eldin g is
complet ely lost and int ervention b ecomes  impossi ble because of th e prohibi tive radiation dos e
rates
Freshly discharged fuel would th en reach the poi nt where it bu rns in a ir (900° C ) and very severe
radioactive releases begin with in hou rs [A LVAREZ 2003].
Countermeasures and Their Limits
Several meas ures are conceivable which could possibl y provid e a certain d egree of protection
for nuc lear pow er plants, against acts of war and te rror attacks. Regarding terror attacks, such
measu res are at present under examination  by NPP operators and authorities. Some  have already
been imple mented  or are in a concrete planning stage.
The most  import ant op tions ar e the followin g, whi ch ar e, to som e extent, also subject of publ ic
debate:
1.Preventive shut -dow n
2.Structural backfittin g against d eliberate aircraft crash and oth er hazards
3.Cove ring buildings with a  smoke  screen as protection a gainst deliberate aircraft crashes
4.Addition al personnel (and equipment ) at the site, fo r the mitig ation of th e consequences
of an attack
5.Strengthening the guard force
6.Implementing additional measures of accident ma nagement
Furthermore, th e effects of a  core melt accident indu ced by a terror or military attack could b e
somewhat mitig ated by reducing the potential sou rce term (e.g. by removin g spe nt fuel from the
storage pool n ear the reactor, or by stopping plutonium  fuel manufa cturing and us e)
   92 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Potenti ally, all those m easures can also in crease protection against acts of wa r.
In connection with te rror attacks, fu rther mea sures are also under consid eration, whi ch belong to
the militar y, police or administrat ive sector.
Preventive shut down:
Preventive shut down of a  nuclear pow er plant in c ase of a threat can increase safety margins
against all types of attacks. I n particular, it c an increase the time  span available for counter
measu res after the attack (intervention time).
In order to achieve a significant safety gain, intervention times  of about on e day should b e
available. (In case the primar y circuit is d estroyed and thus, the barrier around th e fuel elements
does no t remain intact, even thi s would no t be sufficient for effective counter-measures.) The
longer the spent fu el has cooled in th e shut down re actor, the slower it will h eat up a fter an
attack and th e lon ger the intervention ti me available will be. Since th e thermal pow er of th e fuel
elements decreases rather slowl y, how ever, after the reactor has been shut dow n, it would b e
necessary to shut do wn a nuclear pow er plant (light water reactor) several months  before the
attack, a t the latest.
If barriers are compr omised, in particular, if th e reactor pressure vessel and/or the cooling circuit
are damaged, e ven preventiv e shutdown c annot g uarantee appropriate intervention times.  Also,
the pot ential advantages of preventive shutdown are mostl y irrelevant if th e spent fu el pool i s in
an exposed po sition in the  reactor building – as  is th e case in ma ny nuclear pow er plants.
Structural backfittin g against d eliberate aircraft crash and oth er hazards:
In principle, structural backfitting could b e a protective meas ure against attacks o f all kind f rom
the air, but also against some other types of attacks. Th e followin g options a re conceivable:
•Protective buildi ngs against air attacks (e.g. tow ers)
•Obst acles on th e ground a gainst car bomb  attacks
The construction of protective bui ldings around the  reactor buil dings, on th e oth er hand, i s under
consideration – fo r example,  in G erman y. The construction of su ch buildin gs, how ever, woul d
create specific new p roblems:  If the buildin gs are placed at a greater distance from the reactor
buildin g, their height would h ave to b e considerable. Thus, th e bui ldings would b e visible from a
large distance. They could serve as orientation points in c ase of oth er attacks. I f they are placed
closely to th e reactor building, on th e other hand, th ey will c reate hind rances fo r traffic on th e
site.
The erection of massive r einforced concrete structures leads to a nother problem. The destruction
of su ch a structure by aircraft attack leads to the formation of heavy concrete pieces that can
create damage on t he sit e.
The situ ation i s different regarding the intrusion of a ttackers with v ehicles on th e ground. I f such
intrusion ont o the site is e ffectively precluded, th e options fo r terrorist are reduced. In particular,
the use of car bombs  in the vicinity of a nuclear plant ca n be made c onsiderably more diffi cult.
Such obst acles could hind er even a milit ary attacker. How ever, the traffic frequency is usually
high in the  surroundin gs of nu clear plants, and to s ome extent a lso on the  site itself. Thi s, in
practice, creates limits  to th e impleme ntation of this mea sure.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 93

Cove ring buildings with a  smoke  screen:
Conc epts fo r covering nuclear power plants w ith smokesc reens, ma inly for the protection a gainst
deliberate crash of a n aircraft, are being planne d in G ermany, where, smokesc reens c onstitute
the central element of th e NPP  operators’ protective concept.
Adaptation of a military concept is envisaged. Thi s is problematical, sin ce milit ary
smokesc reens ar e used unde r completel y different ci rcumstances. For example,  a militar y
smokesc reen can protect a warship a gainst attack by an automatic, t arget-seeking missile.  Und er
cover of th e smoke screen, the ship will then withd raw. I n case of a n attack against a nuclear
power plant, the target is no t movable. Furthermore, a  human  pilot who c an circle for some  time
over the target until th e smoke  has disp ersed guides the aircraft. Also, it will probably be more
difficult to misle ad a human  pilot, than a n automa ted rocket system.
The timely triggering of this measu re constitutes a further problem. Many nuclear pow er plants
are located cl ose to la rge airports and ai r traffic routes. Thus, i t is po ssible that an intention to
attack cannot b e recognised suff iciently early. Furthermore, e ven if a  screen is su ccessfully
created, it will b e rather easy to find th e target nevertheless.
If, in times  of peace, there are air attacks a t low h eight, by helicopter or milit ary aircraft, th e
smokesc reen system w ill be completel y useless. In this c ase, the attack will onl y be recognised
as such whe n it is too l ate. Furthermore, the deliberate triggering of th e smokesc reen by
terrorists (faking an air attack) cannot be excluded – possi bly, to launch a ground at tack during
the resulting confusion.
In times  of w ar, smokesc reens probably give better protection, since the system has originally
been tailored to militar y needs, and it is mor e likely that ap proaching enemies  will b e recognised
in time.  For the protection of a n immovable t arget, the position of whi ch is well known,
however, a smokes creen alone will n evertheless not b e suffi cient.
Addition al personnel (and equipment ) at the site:
In order to mitiga te the conseque nces of an  attack, expe rts in v arious fi elds ( medical personnel,
fire fighters etc.) are needed on th e site. The pos sibilities an d chances for mitig ation wil l be
improved if th e numbe r of this p ersonne l is in creased – b e it lo cated dir ectly on-site, or in
installations in th e vicinity. The correspondin g equipment and ma terials could also be stored at
the site.
Strengthening the guard force:
In principle, strengthening of th e guard force at the site is a suitable mea sure to improv e
protection against a terror attack on th e ground. Th e task of the  guard force consists in r epelling
the attacks of small  groups, as well as in delaying larger attacks at least until po lice and/or
militar y forces arrive.
Strengthening of th e guard force, however, can lead to other risks: Members of th e guard force
could b e blackmailed or bribed in to suppo rting attacks; and protective inst allations on th e site
(in pa rticular, weapons ) could b e taken over by terrorists. I n case of pr ivate guard services, th ere
is also the  issue of s ufficient qu ality control and vetting of guards.
In a recently published re port on th e U.S.-fi rm Wackenhut, whi ch is, among oth ers, respon sible
for security at 30 U .S. NPP  sites, man y shortcomings a re listed. This c oncerns, for example,
poorly maintained weapons ’ inventories, inappropriate storage of explos ives, inadequate control
over access badges and improperl y positioned guards [SEIU 2004].  Anoth er investigation
concludes that guard forces frequently are under-manned,  under-equipp ed, und er-trained, und er-
paid a nd uns ure about th e use of d eadly force in c ase of a terrorist attack [POG O 2002].
   94 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Furthermore, in c ase of a  stronger attack, the  guard force is to us e delaying tactics, whil e calling
for reinforcements.  How ever, a terror attack is lik ely to be “successfully” concluded with in three
to tw enty minutes,  and will not n ecessarily be not iced im mediatel y – and help fr om outsid e wil l
need about one or two hou rs to r each the nuclear pow er plant. I n case of military attacks of l arge
units, in p articular if thos e are equipp ed with h eavy weapon s, the guard force is s till less lik ely to
be able to mount  an effective defence.
Addition al measu res of accident ma nagement:
For many years, measu res of a ccident man agement are planned in mos t nuclear pow er plants
worldwid e, to c ontrol a severe accident o r to at least mitig ate its effects. In connection with th e
protection against terror attacks, th ere have been new considerations since Sept embe r 11, 2001
to further impr ove accident ma nagement. How ever, it i s questionable to whi ch extent the
measu res already planned could b e expand ed further. Conc rete information  on th is issue has not
been publi shed so f ar.
Remark on militar y, police and administrativ e me asures against terror attacks:
Conc erning milit ary, police, secret services and administrat ion, th e foll owing measu res, are
conceivable and have, to som e extent, a lready been impleme nted in some countries: 
1.Protection of pl ants by milit ary (includin g anti-aircraft defence and control of
neighbour ing waterways).
2.Measures to p revent hij acking of airplanes, fo r example  improvin g control of passengers
and improved p rotection of milit ary airplanes.
3.Measures fo r the early recognition of a  skyjacking, for ex ample  by impr oved control of
air traffic, and fo r preventin g attacks with sk yjacked airplanes.
4.Intensifying measures for  vetting and control of pl ant emplo yees (includin g sub-
contractors) – leading to better protection against insid ers.
The first measure mentioned c learly could a lso improve protection against acts of w ar.
How ever, measures lik e the “militarization” of th e energy econom y or extensive control of fli ght
passengers as well as intensifi ed ve tting and control of personnel must  be severely limited,  in
order to r emain c ompatible with a n ope n and democratic soc iety.
In German y, the “Air Security Act” (Luftsicherheitsgesetz) of Ja nuary 2005 p ermits shootin g
down of sk yjacked planes by the German  air force, if ot her measures are not successful a nd it
has to be  assumed  with hi gh probability that the lives of th e passengers would b e lost anyway.
This A ct is hi ghly controversial and criticised b y leading German  politi cians, amon g them the
Federal President [FR 2005 a].
If plants are protected by military units th e protection mea sures themselves can lead to n ew
risks, ju st as in the  case of private guards as mil itary personnel, too c ould b e recruited b y
terrorists using bribes or blackmail.  Furthermore, milit ary installations at the site could b e taken
over by terrorists. Furthermore, militar y installations lo cated dir ectly at the plant sit e alone will
be largely useless a gainst certain kinds o f attacks, if th ere is no time ly warnin g – for ex ample  in
case of a  tree-height attack with helicopters.
The insid er problem is of particular complexity. Generally, at present, qu alified pe rsonn el for
nuclear plants a re scarce. Sub-contractors are extensively used. Thi s consid erably increases the
“chances” for terror organisations to re cruit insid ers.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 95

Conclusions
The threats to nuclear pow er plants form terror attacks a nd acts of w ar can be summ arized as
follows:
•Because of th eir impor tance for the electricity suppl y system, th e severe consequences of
radioactive releases as well as because of th eir symbolic character, nuclear pow er plants
are “attractive” targets for terrorist a s well as for mil itary attacks.
•Nuclear pow er plants could be targets in case of wa r if a  militar y use is sus pected.
•The spectrum  of po ssible modes  of attack is v ery diverse. At tacks could b e performed  by
air, on the  ground an d from the water. Diff erent means/we apons c an be used.
•An a ttack on a  nuclear pow er plant can lead to r adioactive releases e quivalent to s everal
times  the release at Che rnobyl. Relocation of th e popul ation c an become  necessary for
large areas (up to 100.000 km2). The num ber of cancer deaths c an reach more th an 1
million.
•Protective measures against terror attacks are of very limit ed use. Furthermore, a  num ber
of conceivable measu res cannot b e implemented  in an open and democratic society.
•There is no p rotection against militar y attacks, in p articular if h eavy weapons a re used.
Taking into a ccount the  vulnerability of nuclear plants as discussed above, it is p articularly clear
that nu clear pow er is p art of the “hard” path of e nergy supply, not of the “soft”, sust ainable path
– and th at ph ase-out of nu clear pow er would b e the best an swer to the terrorist th reat.
The use of nu clear energy requires construction a nd op eration o f a relatively small num ber of
large, centralised inst allations, with a n enormous  concentration of c apital as well as economic
and polit ical pow er. “Hard” energy systems a lways have mark ed militar y implications. Th is
centralisation a lso leads to a  particular vuln erability against terror or warlike attacks.
The “soft” path, with a  maxi mum of efficiency of energy use and th e reliance upon r enewables,
implies  the production o f energy in ma ny small decentralized plants. “ Soft”, sustainable energy
systems a re, contrary to nu clear installations, not under the suspicion of being used for mil itary
purposes and, thu s, will not be targets of attacks fo r this r eason. F urthermore, th ey are generally
less vuln erable to a ttacks than “ hard” systems.

D.1.ii Vulnerabilities of Reprocessing Plants and Spent Fuel
Storage Pools to Terrorism Risks Reproc essing Plants
“It is har d to t hink o f a nuc lear terrorist att ack which  could, a t least in th eory, be more
catastrophi c than a s uccessful atta ck on e ither the tan ks at Sellafield that contain th e liquid
fission produ cts se parat ed from spent r eactor fu el elements b y the  two reprocessing pl ants or on
the stor es holding the plu tonium s eparat ed by the  reprocessing plants.”  
Dr. Frank  Barnaby
Introduction
Spent nu clear fuel reprocessin g plants contain b y far the largest invento ries of radioactive and
strategic nuclear mate rials of an y of th e elements of the  nuclear fuel chain. Th e sites of th ese
nuclear-chemical pl ants t ypically store significant qu antities of sp ent fu el (the equivalent of
several dozen nuclear reactor cores), several dozen metri c ton s of pluton ium, thous ands of ton s
of reprocessed uranium  and te ns of thou sands o f tons o f nuclear wastes in v arious chemical and
physical forms. Reprocessing plants also store significant amounts  of traditional dangerous
mate rials like fuel, g as and chemic als.
There is a high probability that a  massive a ttack on s uch a  facility would lead to c atastrophi c
consequences [LARGE]. Howev er, the ext ent of the  damage and devastation c aused largely
depends on th e poin t and type of impact. The followin g part of th e study is int ended to p rovid e a
rough overview o f potential issues involv ed and do es by no means p rovid e a compreh ensiv e
review of th e complex  problem. Detailed analysis is particularly difficult b ecause of obvious
confid entiality issues.
The Spent Fuel Pools
Every nuclear pow er plant h as a spent fuel pool wh ere the nu clear fuel is coolin g off a t least fo r
a few y ears. The fuel is kept und er several mete rs of w ater that constitute a n effective radiation
barrier. Unshi elded, radiation of sp ent fu el at short distance would be lethal within a  few
minutes.  The mini mum time  the fuel stays in th e on-site pools b efore it can be transferred into a
shippin g container depends on the  type of fuel a nd on th e burn-up. Th e theoretical ma ximum
intermediat e stor age time is several decades and th erefore likely extends b eyond the operational
life of the pow er plant. 
In practice the storage time for spent fue l in on -site pools is limited  by the capacity of th e pool s,
safety and se curity consid erations as  well as  the decision in favou r of oth er spent fuel
mana gement options ( dry storage, centralised away from the reactor storage or reprocessing). In
many cases the quantiti es of sp ent fu el stor ed per poo l have been in creased th rough so-called re-
racking, that is in creasing the density by re-organising the placement of th e fuel in th e pool s.
The quantities of sp ent fu el sto red in poo ls at a given reactor site can reach several thou sand
metri c tons a nd therefore constitute a very significant radioactive inventor y. How ever, the
largest quantities of sp ent fu el are stored at reprocessin g plants a nd at few centralised aw ay-
from- reactor (AFR) intermediat e storage facilities.

As can be seen f rom the table above the largest AFR wet sto rage facilities are in th e countries
that op erate spent fu el-reprocessing facilities (F rance, Russ ia, UK, Ja pan).
The onl y exception is Sweden w ith a centralised sp ent fu el sto rage facility at Oskarshamn with a
capacity of about 8,000 ton s where about 4,000 tons a re already stored (as of F ebruary 05).
How ever, the Swe dish CLAB concept provid es particular protection for the fuel. Th e eight spent
fuel pools a re in 30 m  to 40 m  depth in a  rock formation.  The site shou ld withstand majo r
external impa ct like aircraft crash or  armed a ttack.
The opposit e exam ple is th e main  French plutonium  separation fa cility. As of th e end of June
2004, th e La Hague reprocessing site stored about 7,900 tons of spe nt fuel of whi ch close to 500
tons of sp ent MOX fuel (plutonium- uranium mixed oxide) containing a significantl y higher
toxic  invento ry than s tandard uranium  fuel. R ather than decreasing the stor age density as one
possibl e post -9/11 pr ecaution ary measu re, COGEMA  was authorised to increase the La Hague
spent fuel storage capacity by 26% to 17,600 t. Non e of th e buildin gs at the site are specifically
designed to w ithstand th e crash of a  large aircraft.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 99

In order to simpli fy the evaluation o f the risk pot ential, on e can limit  the consid eration to
potential release of r adioactive caesium- 137 th at, in th e case of t he Che rnobyl disaster, has
contributed approximatel y 75% of th e radiological impact. S pent light water reactor fuel with a
burn-up of 33,000 MWd/t  cont ains, after a typical cooling time  of seven years, roughly 1 kg of
caesium- 137 p er ton of fu el. At 45,000 M Wd/t the ratio is a bout 1.5 k g/t. Th e French fu el
currently reaches an average of 45,000 MW d/t with a  licensed limit  in th e reactor of 52,000
MWd/t . The spent f uel in th e cooling ponds o f La Hague has probably an average burn-up of
around 40,000 MWd /t and, a t about 1.2 k g/t, contains a round 10,000 k g of caesium- 137, whi ch
is ov er 370 times  the amount  released at  Chernobyl.
In fact, the  new op erating license of th e La Hague facilities, granted in 2003 [J OURNAL
OFFICIEL 1993],  allows f or bu rn-up levels for up to 75,000 M Wd/t . Such high burn-up fue ls
would h ave much larger fission product contents than c urrent bu rn-up f uels with th e same
coolin g time.
In a widely com mented stud y [SCHNE IDER 2001] , in 2001 W ISE-Paris had calculated th e
potential release of ca esium  from a single La Hague spent fu el sto rage pool. I ndustry and safety
authorities have argued that the assumption  that up to 100%  of a given inv entory of caesium
could b e released du ring a major accident would b e “unrealistic”. WISE-Paris had based this
assumption  on a  2000 NRC  report that had analysed the pot ential risks of sp ent fu el pool
accident [US NRC  2001].  
The La Hague operator COGEMA h as argued that even in t he case of tot al los s of co olant “ the
risk of sub sequent melt -down c an be discarded”. Th e emptying of th e pools “ would no t be
immediate a nd th e heating of th e radioactive mate rials w ould stretch out ov er several days
leaving the time  for the anti-fire brigade of th e plant to e ffectively intervene”. [C OGEMA ] The
official Institute for Radiation Prot ection a nd Nu clear Safety (then IPSN, now I RSN) stated in a
confid ential no te to th e Secretary of Sta te for Industry that the caesium  release rate would r ather
be limited  to “less than 10%”. In various di scussions w ith the author, IRSN representatives have
argued that the heat output woul d be smalle r than an ticipated (because of the  average age of th e
fuel sto red) and th erefore less fuel would b e damaged and less caesium released in c ase of
accident. Howev er, it should  be not ed that IRSN comments on a ccident scenarios onl y and
explicitl y refuse s to di scuss sp ecific terrorism scenarios. Th erefore the statements do no t cover
any scenario tha t would either impl y a significant exte rnal heat sou rce, such as the impa ct of a
fully loade d large aircraft on the  site, or major impac t on intervention possibili ties, su ch as major
destruction after a large explosion. Also, n either the COGEMA  nor the IRSN statements  have
been ba cked up b y any publi shed technical reference document.9
In a recent statement on the situation a t pow er plant d ecomm issioning projects, th e NRC  has
downpl ayed its ow n findin gs in th e 2000 s tudy. “From the studies completed thu s far, it is clear
that current decommissioning pl ant EP  [Emergency Preparedness] programs are adequate given
the age of sp ent fue l contained in th eir pools. Mode stly aged fuel wil l be air cooled und er a loss
of sp ent fu el pool w ater accident. Th e age of spent fu el dictates the time  it would take to he at up
the fuel, pot entially releasing radioactive nuclides. All spent f uel a t the current fleet of
decomm issioning  plants i s older than fi ve years and is th erefore very slow to ov erheat ev en
under these more challenging conditions. Regardless of the spent f uel a ge or configurations
considered, the current a nalyses show tha t spent fu el heat-up time  is lon ger than p reviousl y
estimated by NRC  in draft N UREG-1738 ( …). Based on th e analysis performed to date, the staff
has no t identi fied an y spent fuel pool ac cident issues that would inv alidate the EP planning
basis.”[US  NRC  2004]
9 Repeated  spec ific docume ntation request s from the au thor to IRS N (letters dated  1 and 11 March 05), Thie rry
CHARLES, Director  for plant, labora tory, transport  and waste safety have not p roduced any noteworthy result.
   100 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

While there are many possible scenarios for terrorist a ttacks on sp ent fu el pools a nd in spit e of
the new N RC position, a t least two cases remain of particular relevance to spent fuel pool
integrity, the deliberate aircraft crash and th e deliberate explosion of a large gas tanker at the
coast.
In the followin g exam ple one out o f five coolin g pond s at La Hague would b e severely damaged
in the course of a  plane crash scenario. Th e middle  sized D pond wit h a c apacity of 4,600 t h as
been taken as example  and a 50% load factor is envisaged. The potential for a self-sustaining
zirconium  fire, followin g loss of w ater, increases with th e packing of fu el poo ls to h igh
densities. In 2003 C OGEMA  was authorised to in crease the storage capacity of th e pond b y
1,110 t ( +32%). Und er the present scenario, th e loss of w ater in the D coolin g pond c ould lead,
because of exothe rmic oxidati on reactions of zi rconium  and other metals, to the release of
caesium- 137 a nd oth er fission p roducts contained in 2,300 t of sp ent li ght water reactor fuels
stored. If one consid ers a release of onl y 5% or 150 k g of the  close to 3,000 k g of caesium in the
pond, it would c orrespond to ov er five times  the tot al amount  of ca esium- 137 re leased as a
consequence of th e Che rnobyl accident. 
It should b e stressed that this is a  rather conservative estimat e because:
-The spent fuel pool co uld c ontain twi ce as muc h fuel.
-The caesium content p er ton of fu el increases almost linearly with bu rn-up, so t he
caesium  content might b e much  higher because of in creasingly higher burn-ups;
-The caesium release rate could be much higher than 5% ;
-The caesium contained in 10 y ear old light water reactor spent fu el represents onl y about
half of the  fission produc t activity;
-Impact on L a Hague could d estroy more than on e pool, d amage safety equipment  and
make sho rt term access to th e poo ls impossible;
-In addition, the five La Hague pools c ontain a  no lon ger publish ed amount  of non -
irradiated w aste from the MOX fabrication. The  amount  is certainly considerable,
probably around 100 tons o r more co ntainin g several tons o f plutonium;
-The release pattern could b e much  worse and lead to much  higher contamination  levels
than in th e case of Che rnobyl when initial explos ions and a 10-day lastin g fire dispersed
most  of th e released radioactivity high into the atmosphere and ov er very large territories.
A group of US  scientists h as calculated th at ev en for a limited  release (equivalent to 1.75
times  the Che rnobyl caesium  release) due to a  spent fuel pool ac cident a t a US nuclear pow er
plant o r the attack against the facility the areas calculated as “contaminated above 100
Ci/km2  are 5–9 times  larger than th e area contaminated to this l evel by the 2 m illion Ci
release from the Che rnobyl accident” [ALVAREZ].
The La Hague example  above covers only light water reactor fuel. Oth er fuels h ave other
particular problems. As th e British nuclear consult ant John  Large points out: “ For Magnox
elemental metal fuel, both th e cladding and fu el are pyrophoric and in -situ bu rning of the fu el
could r esult in a  very significant release of re spirable-sized fission product particles10 again
released with emulsions  of aviation fu el wi th greater efficacy of disp ersion.”11 
10 The Magnox magnesium alloy cladding  will ignite in air at about 600-700oC and the Magnox uran ium metal at
about  220oC or lower if hydrides h ave formed  on the surface.11 Personal  comm unication, 11 March 05

Precauti onar y Measures
In October 2002, the  Attorneys General of 27 St ates of the  USA,  in an unp recedented move ,
wrote a letter to the key representatives of Con gress: “An int eragency Task Force—chaired by
the NRC  and wo rking in concert with the Director of Homel and Security, should b e created and
tasked to r ecomm end changes to e nhance the  physical security of nu clear plants, increase
security mea sures, expand eme rgency respons e capability, and enhance protections fo r one of
the most  vuln erable compone nts of a nuclear pow er plant—i ts spent fuel pool s”. [ATT ORNEY
GENERA L] 
There are several ways to re duce the pot ential risks of a ccidental or voluntary impacts on
spent fuel we t storage facilities:
-Increase physical protection;
-Lower density in sp ent fu el pools;
-Lower inve ntories of s torage facilities.
While the significant in crease in ph ysical protection of a n existin g spent fu el poo l beyond a
certain level (access restriction, su rveillance, ph ysical barriers, etc.) is com plex, the transfer
of as much  spent fu el as possible from pool s into dry storage casks would a llow to de crease
at the same time  the radioactive inv entory at a given sit e and to d ecrease the storage densit y
per pool. A g roup of US  academics suggests the followin g for the case of US  spent fu el
stored at  reactor sites, an estimated 96 % in pools . [ALVA REZ]: 
“To reduce both  the cons eque nces and probabil ity of a spent-fuel-pool  fire, it is
propose d that all spent f uel b e transferred from wet to d ry storage within f ive years of
discharge. The cost of on- site dry-cask storage for an a ddition al 35,000 tons  of older
spent fuel is e stimated a t $3.5–7 bill ion doll ars or 0.03–0.06 ce nts per kilowatt -hour
generated from  that fuel. Later cost savings coul d offset s ome of this cost when the fuel
is shipped off site. Th e transfer to dry storage could be accomplished  within a d ecade.
The removal of  the o lder fuel would r educe the average inven tory of 137C s in the
pools  by about a  factor of four, brin ging it down to  about twi ce that in a reactor core. It
would also m ake possible a return to open -rack storage for the remaining mor e recently
discharged fuel. If accompanied by the instal lation of l arge emer gency doors or blow ers
to provid e large-scale airflow th rough the buildin gs housi ng the pools, natu ral
conv ection ai r cool ing of this sp ent fu el should b e possible if airflow h as not been
blocked by collapse of the  buildin g or other cause.”
There migh t be some  costing differences in the  case of oth er countries, but it is obvious th at the
principle is v aluable for any wet spent fu el sto rage facility, whether at reactor sites or AFR. The
only noteworthy exception r emains th e Sw edish example  of th e subs urface intermediat e storage
facility CLAB.  Howe ver, centralised sto res always need shipment between the reactor and th e
storage facility and therefore entail exposur e to vul nerabilit y during transpo rt (see section
D.1.iv ). 
In April 2005, th e US  National Re search Council  publi shed a report whi ch concluded tha t the
spent fuel c urrent sto red in ponds may be at risk from terrorist at tacks and called for addi tional
analyses to obt ain a  better understandin g of potential risks and to e nsure tha t pow er-plant
operators take prompt  and effective measu res to re duce the possible consequences of s uch
attacks.  The report ide ntified several scenarios that c ould h ave serious co nsequences at some
plants in cludin g that a n attack whi ch partially or complet ely drains a  plant's spent fuel pool
might b e capable of st arting a high-temperature fire that c ould r elease large quantities of
   102 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

radioactive mate rial into t he environment  and called fo r measu res to c ounter the threat [UCNRC
2005]
The Plutonium Stores
The amount  of plutonium  in store is st eadily increasing. Wh ile the US  and R ussia agreed to
dispos e each of 34 t of “ excess” weapons g rade plutonium,  the wo rld’s “civil” plu tonium
stockpile exceeds 230 t. As of th e end of 2002, the  largest holder of plut onium is the UK with
over 90 t, of whi ch 20 t own ed by foreign utilities, fol lowed by France with 80 t, of whi ch 32 t
owned by foreign utilities and R ussia with ove r 37 t. The  plutoni um in th e UK is sto red at the
Sellafield site, mos t of th e plu tonium  in France at La Hague and most  of th e Russian plutonium
in M ayak.
It is remarkable that the bul k of th e pluton ium stocks in the wo rld are at the sam e sites as the
largest concentrations of sp ent fuel. P lutoni um has two p articular characteristics, it is of high
strategic value as primar y weapon in gredient and it is hi ghly radiotoxic.  A few k ilograms are
sufficient in o rder to manufa cture a fission w eapon, a  few m icrograms inhaled are suffi cient to
develop c ancer.
In March 2002 t he Ro yal Soci ety of Ed inburgh (RSE) st ated: “W hat the Sept ember 11 e vents
also necessitate is improved ph ysical security of se parated plutoni um storage, sufficient to
withst and di rect impact b y fully-fuelled large-capacity aircraft and ballisti c mis siles and capable
of being policed and defended against all foreseeable forms of terrorist attack”
Unfo rtunately, none of th e bui ldings at Sell afield o r La Hague have been designed to wit hstand
any of th ese extreme  impacts. W hile this does not me an that the structures co uld not withst and
such an impa ct und er some  circumstanc es, the probabilit y that the y woul d resist impact is
limited.  The wo rst release mech anism  for plutonium,  usually stored in oxide  form, is a large fire
that would re nder plutonium  particles airborne in micron sizes th at are inhalable.
According to Frank Barnaby, former director of S IPRI “if evenly distribut ed, a  kilogram o f
plutonium  in th e Sell afield sto re wil l, on a verage, contaminat e more than 300 s quare kilometres
to the level at which th e NRPB  [National Radi ation Prot ection B oard] recommends  evacuation.
A terrorist a ttack on a  plutoni um store at Sell afield could contaminat e a huge area of land.”
[BARNABY ] 
The Radioactive Waste Storage
The sites of large-scale reprocessin g plants not onl y hold th e largest inventor ies of sp ent fu el an d
separated plutonium  but a lso th e largest quantities of a great variety of conditioned and
uncondition ed ra dioactive wastes of an y nuclear site.
As of 1 Ap ril 2001, th e UK radioactive was te mana gement a gency NIREX includ ed in th e
inventory for Sellafield th e followin g wa stes:
-1,440 m3  high level was te in liquid fo rm stored in 21 sto rage tanks;
-340 m3  of conditi oned ( vitrified) high level waste; 
-51,000 m3  intermediat e level wastes (ILW); only 15% of UK I LW is conditioned;
As of th e end of 2002, th e French radioactive was te mana gement a gency ANDR A presented th e
followin g inventory of hi gh and int ermediat e level wastes fo r La Hague (excerpt) [ANDRA]:
-1,162 m3  uncondition ed liquid hi gh level waste;
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 103

-7,697 c ontainers with vit rified hi gh level waste (122 x  1018 Bq);
-807 t of un condi tioned hull s and nozzles ;
-3,740 d rums  of hull s and nozzles  to be reconditioned;
-969 t of un condi tioned g raphite sleeves;
-9,301 m3  of un conditi oned plutonium  bearing sludges;
-10,244 bitumen  packages.
The presence of unconditioned wa stes is p articularly problematic be cause they are close to a
dispersible state. Th e storage of high-level liquid waste stemm ing from the spent fue l dissolution
represents th e highest po tential hazard be cause of the combinati on of th e large inventories of
radioactivity and the ph ysical-chemical st ate. W hile the fission p roducts sto red in the form of
liquids a t Sellafield a nd La Hague contain several hund red times  the amount  of cesium- 137 th at
was released at Chernob yl, uncondition ed sludges often contain hi gh levels of plu tonium. The
9,300 m3  of slud ges at La Hague contain a n estimated 160 kg of plu tonium.  This situ ation l eads
also to severe safeguards difficult ies. Faced with the impos sibility to properly account for an
estimated 1.3 t of plutonium  in the B30 pond a t Sellafield, in M arch 2004 th e European
Commission issued a directive against the UK for  non-compliance with its s afeguards
regulations. 
While the specific problem of the liqui d high-level wa ste at Sell afield has been the subject of
many publi cations and particular action b y the UK safety authorities12, the situ ation a t La Hague
has gone entirely unnoti ced. W hile the original sto cks fr om the reprocessing at the old UP2-400
should h ave been absorbed a long time  ago, the situation seems to have deteriorated ove r the
years or, at best, has been stable. The  stock has increased b y 50 m3 between 2001 and 2002.
According to th e French Nu clear Safety Autho rities, at the end of Sept ember 2004 t he stock
stood a t 1,145 m3 of whi ch 230 m3 whe re stored a t UP2-400, 760 m3 at UP2-800 a nd 155 m3 at
UP3.  [TER NEAUD]
At th e middle  of 1992, a ccording to a representative of th e Saf ety Authorities, the volume  of
liquid w aste at UP2-400 stood a t 930 m3,  down fr om 1,200 m3 at the end of 1990. Th e volume
at UP3  was at 180 m3 (as of th e end of 1991). [CSPI] Howe ver, in a  Decembe r 1992 not e the
Safety Autho rities state that “after having culminated a t 1,070 m3  up to 1990 -91 ( about h ave of
the storage capacity), the volume  of the stored fission p roduct solut ion has be en reduced to 724
m3 in June  1992. I t is planned th at the volume  will b e reduced to 445 m3 as of 1 J uly 93 in o rder
to be stabilised a t 400 m3 as of 1994.”   [SAFETY  AUTHOR ITY] Ten years later, the volume  is
three times the level. 
The representative of the  Safety Authority has declined to i ndicate any data on th e radioactive or
thermal inventory or on th e evolut ion of t he stocks or any reasons fo r the current size of th e
stocks. [SCHNE IDER 2005]  He simpl y indicated th at the Autho rity would c onsider the storage
facilities at La Hague “perfectly safe” and “not c ompar able” to th e installation s at Sellafield.
How ever, he declined to indi cate in wh at respect the design of th e facilities would make the m
safer than th e Sell afield sto rage. He also stated th at the stock would h ave declined from the
September 2004 fi gure, but c ould not indi cate by how much.
12 See for  example  NII, The Stora ge of Liquid High Level W aste at BNFL Sellafiel d - An Upd ated Review of Safety,
Februar y 200 0 and NII,  The storage of liquid high level waste at BNFL,  Sellafield  - Adde ndum to Februa ry 2000
Report, August 2001. In 200 0 BNF L agreed to a reduction st rategy that would limit the stock to  a bu ffer quantity of
200 m3 by 201 5. Instead,  in September 2001, BNFL w as ordered to shut down its rep rocessing plan ts because, due
to malfunction ing of t he vitrificatio n facilities, the stock h ad risen by another  100 m3 o ver the year
   104 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Conclusion
Spent nu clear fuel a nd central radioactive waste storage facilities contain b y far the largest
inventories of ra dioactive substances of a ny facility throughout th e nuclear fuel chain. S pent
nuclear fuel in c ooling pools a s well as uncondit ioned high level radioactive wastes in liqui d and
sludge form are particularly vuln erable to a ttack. The  main reason fo r this i s that the y are present
in readily dispersible form in sto rage facilities that are not d esigned to with stand l arge aircraft
crash or an attack with heavy weapons . Storage facilities at reprocessing plants co ntain hund reds
of times  the radioactive inv entory that was released as a consequence of the  Chernobyl disaster.
In addition reprocessing facilities store doz ens of tons of pl utoni um, some  of whi ch could be
dispersed as a result of a  major fire that co uld b e triggered by accident o r terrorist attack. Th e
inhalation o f a few dozen micro grams (milli onth of a gram) can trigger a lethal lun g cancer.
Plutonium  could also be div erted for weapons pu rposes. Several kilograms are sufficient for  the
manufa cture of a  crude nuclear device.
The situ ation a t the La Hague facility raises man y questions. Public a ttention h as so f ar focussed
on th e risk pot ential of th e spent fue l pools , while at Sellafield th e stor age of liqu id high level
radioactive w aste has been th e subj ect of ma jor concern. Ho weve r, the La Hague site also stored
very significant amounts  (> 1,100 m3  as of Sept embe r 04) of un condition ed liqu id high level
radioactive w aste, a fact that has not b een the subj ect of a ny indep endent expe rt review o r any
publi c attention so far.

D.1.iii: Terror ist Attacks on Spent Fuel Storage Sites with Cask
Storage
Introduction
Increasingly, dry storage in casks is b eing practised wo rldwide fo r longer-term intermedi ate
storage of sp ent fuel. Aft er a decaying period of se veral years in the nuc lear pow er plant’s
storage pool, th e spe nt fuel is lo aded into massive c ontainers that are then pl aced in a  storage
facility, which is usu ally located at the power plant sit e. Casks a re cooled by passive ai rflow.
Cask sto rage facilities are in us e in ma ny countries. Th ey are planne d, and to some  extent
already built, a t all but on e of t he sit es of nu clear pow er plants op erating in German y; in
addition, the re are three central cask sto rage facilities in that country. In the United Stat es, about
30 facilities of this t ype were operational by mid-2004 [REU TERS 2004].  Belgium, the Czech
Republi c and Japan, a mong oth er countries, are also using this concept [WNIH 2004].
The casks are designed to p rovid e protection a gainst exte rnal impacts. F or example,  the
CASTO R V/19, a  mode rn Ge rman c ask type, is a cast iron c ylinder with a  length of a bout 6 m
and a diameter of a bout 2.5 m.  Wall  thickness is 0.42 m.  The weight of th e cask, lo aded with 19
spent fuel e lements, is about 125 t [EO N 2000].
In most  countries, casks are set up in a  light buildin g designed to g ive shieldin g against the
weather. In the Unit ed Sta tes, casks are usually put on c oncrete found ations in op en air.
Spent fu el in c asks is generally less vulnerable to a ttacks tha n is f uel sto red in pools . In a pool,
once the water cooling circuit i s interrupted, a  severe accident c an develop le ading to m elting of
all the fuel in th e pool, a nd accordingly, to very large releases (see section D.1.i ). In a cask
storage facility, there are no c entral coolin g systems the de struction of whi ch co uld lead to
compar ably all-encompa ssing effects.
How ever, casks in a  storage facility at the reactor site can be better accessible for attacks, in
particular if th ey are standin g in the open. Th ere are several modes  of at tack th at could lead to
destruction of on e or several casks. W hile releases would tend to b e smaller tha n releases
resulting from the attack of a  pool s torage facility of compar able capacity, they could be no
means b e regarded as negligible or trivial.
Conceivable Attack Scenarios
Most of th e attack scenarios list ed in s ection D.1.i a lso ap ply for cask storage facilities. Some
examples  are given here whi ch are particularly relevant fo r cask sto rage.
The scenarios h ere are discussed wit h the “massiv e” cask type in mind,  i.e. a cask type the walls
of whi ch are thick enough to provid e shielding. They basically are also valid f or the oth er type of
cask presentl y in us e, consisting of thin -walled ca nister plus overpack. Worldwide,  the
“massiv e” cask type is predominantly used; in some  countries, particularly the Unit ed Stat es,
however, the oth er type is also currently employed.
Attack from the air:
The deliberate crash of a  large airliner like the Boeing B-747 o r the Airbus A -380 w hich will be
commissioned  for com mercial flights 2006 c an lead to c onsiderable radioactive releases from a
cask sto rage facility. The large volumes  of kerosene thos e airliners can carry in the ir tanks (mor e
than 200 m3 for the B-747, more th an 300 m3 for the A-380) constitut e the main  risk factor.
An inv estigation of poss ible accident scenarios fo r the cask sto rage facilities licensed a t NPP
sites in s outhe rn German y led to the  following results: I f about 150 m3 kerosene get into t he
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 107

storage area, a hot fi re with a  duration of s everal hours can result. A large numbe r of casks – in
the order of 20 – would b e subj ected to this fire. Th ey woul d be heated up, a nd th e seals of th e
cask lids would e ventually fail. Volatile radionu clides would th en be released into th e
atmosphe re [UBA 2002].  The fire is likely to be sho rter in c ase of an  open-air facility, since in
that case, the kerosene will be more e asily dispersed th an in case of a fire in a (partly destroyed)
storage buildin g. Thi s is the  only case, how ever, were stor ing casks wi thout a  protective bui lding
actually can be advantageous.
Also c onceivable is a  bombing a ttack with a militar y airplane the pilot of whi ch has been bribed,
blackma iled o r “converted” by a terrorist g roup. A 2000 pound bomb  like the BLU-109 th at can
be carried by fighter-bombers ar ound t he wo rld could be used; th e BLU-109 is spe cifically
designed to p enetrate hardened targets [BGT 2004 ; GLOBAL SECUR ITY 2004].  A light
buildin g would be no ob stacle; the bomb  could enter deeply into the cask wall. Th e subseque nt
explosion  would s everely damage the cask. I n case of li ght water reactor fuel, zircalloy
fragments would b e produced from the fuel element hulls th at would st art burning since air can
ingress into th e cask. Eve ntually, all or most  of th e zircalloy inventory of the  cask would
participate in th e fire. A si gnificant amount  of th e vol atile radionu clide invento ry of th e cask
would b e released.
Attack wit h armour -piercing weapons f rom outsid e the  facility:
Armour-pi ercing weapons l ike the U.S.  Javelin, th e French/Canadian Eryx or the Ge rman
Panze rfaust 3 can go through 600 m m of st eel and more an d hence are more th an pow erful
enough to penetrate spe nt fuel sto rage casks. They can be carried and fired by one or two people
and ar e widely used in a ll armies ov er the world.
The attack can be performed  from a distance of 50 to s everal 100 m.  If the casks were located in
a buildin g, the building’s wall would h ave to b e pierced first. Thi s could b e achieved, for
example,  by firing a different type of w arhead with t he w eapon us ed or  by shelling with a
morta r. If a cask is hit an d its w all penetrated, p art of th e fuel content will b e vaporized, a nd a
further part will b e broken up int o small particles. If air enters the cask, a  zircalloy fire will
result, further increasing releases.
Attack by entering the storage facility:
Attackers entering the storage area could s everely damag e casks with explosives a nd other
equipment  that could be carried by a group of people. It would b e diff icult in this ca se for the
attackers to e scape unh armed;  how ever, sui cide attacks c annot b e excluded.
Usin g shaped charges, or an oxygen lance to pierce holes into the wall of a  steel or iron c ask
which ar e then fill ed by explosive s, large openings could b e created in th e wall(s) of on e or
several casks. Th ey would allow a ir intrusions in to the cask(s), and hence a zircalloy fire.
Furthermore, shi eldin g of th e radiation from the spent fuel e lements  would b e significantly
reduced; large parts of the  storage area would b e subject to v ery high dos e rates. Counter
measu res like attempting to c over the openings in th e casks wall thus woul d be practically
impossible.  Significant re leases, as in th e case of an  air attack, c an result.
Consequences of an Attack on a Cask Storage Facility
Releases wil l be discussed here usin g caesium- 137 as  lead nu clide. Cs-137 i s radiolo gically
important du e to i ts hard gamma-radiation; and it is one of t he most  volatile radionuc lides.
The quantity released wil l depend on th e detailed circums tances of the attack, the configuration
of the storage area as well as the damage don e to th e buildi ng if th e storage is no t in op en air.
Furthermore, it d epends on the cask inv entory – i.e . the mass an d burn-up of th e spe nt fuel
   108 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

elements. Only the possible orders of mag nitud es of releases can be given here for orientation. A
cask with a n inv entory of 10 t of sp ent P WR fuel wi th typical burn-up is a ssumed.
In case of the crash of a  com mercial airliner with k erosene fire, releases can be in th e order of
1,000 T Bq of Cs-137 ( possibly less for an open air facility).
For the oth er attack mode s, releases from 500 T Bq (a ttack w ith an armour- piercing weapons an d
damage of on e cask, no zir calloy-fire) up to a bout 100,000 TB q (bombing at tack from the air,
two c asks hit, zircalloy fire as well as fire from incendiary bombs)  must  be expe cted, with
somewhat hi gher values in c ase of a n open ai r facility.
At th e Che rnobyl accident, 85,000 T Bq of C s-137 w ere released [NEA 1995].  Thus, r eleases in
case of an  attack at a cask storage facility can be in t he order of magnitude from about on e
percent of Che rnobyl releases to a bout 100 p ercent or even somew hat mor e. These releases do
not reach the extent possibl e for accident at large spent fue l pools , but nevertheless th ey have to
be regarded as catastrophic.
Countermeasures
There is little scope to r educe the vuln erability of th e casks as  such. F urther thickening of the
cask walls hardly seems feasible, with cask masses a lready around 100 ton s. Handlin g in th e
storage facility would b ecome diffi cult, a nd transport a near impos sibility, if the  mass was
significantly increased. ( It shou ld be noted tha t many storage casks ar e dual-purpose and are also
used for  transports.)
Thick-walled, smalle r casks with sma ller fuel inv entory are conceivable. How ever, the
vulnerable surface of a  storage facility would b e thus increased. Al so conceivable woul d be the
provision of additional ov erpacks lik e a concrete hul l for each cask th at could go a little way
towards better protection.
The most  promising c ountermeas ure appears to modif y the layout of the w hole storage facility
towards a “robust a nd dispersed” concept whi ch has already been proposed in th e Unit ed Stat es
[THOM PSON 2002].  This concept implies spacing of th e ind ividual c asks at greater distances
and su rroundin g each cask with a  massive co ncrete structure (bunk er), as well as a conical
mound  of earth, gravel and ro cks.
Sitin g the storage facility below g round woul d provid e further protection ; on th e oth er hand, it
would r aise the danger of becoming a  final reposito ry by default ( which also, to some extent, h as
to be seen in c onnection with the  robust and dispersed storage concept). The robust and
dispersed sto rage concept requires a significant a rea per cask and hence appears best feasibl e and
secure for small  inventories of spe nt fuel. Large inventories would r equire spreading the facility
over a large plot of land, r endering guarding and securing against attacks or infilt rations on th e
ground d ifficult.
Some expe rts request  protection measu res for dry storage facilities which are still going further.
Arjun M akhijani, President of th e Institute for Energy and Envi ronmental Res earch (IEER)
considers that “dry cask sto rage of sp ent fu el in p resent d ay systems licensed b y the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission also do es not me et the criteria of secure, hardened storage”.
[MAKH IJAN I 2003] 
Makhijani d efines his criteria for Hardened On -Site Stor age (HOSS)  of sp ent fu el against
terrorist attack as  follows :
1.It should not  result in catastrophic releases and should be  able to re sist almost  all types of
attacks. Th e estimated am ount of r adioactivity that would b e released in e ven sev ere attacks
should be small enoug h that the storage system would b e unattractive as a terrorist target.
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 109

2. It should b e abl e to withstand a  direct hi t by a large commerci al airliner full of fu el or anti-
tank we apons without ca tastrophic offsite r eleases.
3. The ind ividual c anister locations shoul d not b e easily detectable from offsit e. Th is means th at
it must  not be visibl e from offsite and the  infrared signature should be obscured enough to
prevent a direct hit in case of attack with  infrared guided munitions.”
One pos sibili ty envisaged by Makhijani is th e construction of silos “ resembling s mall hardened
missile  silos. Spent f uel c ould b e put in l arge casks th at are then em placed in th ese silos. A
buildin g would cover the entire set of silos. ”
Conclusion
Storage of spent fu el in c asks is vuln erable to terrorist attacks, like oth er forms  of sto rage.
Radio active releases from attacks a re likely to be smaller tha n thos e that would r esult fr om
attacks o f storage pools. On t he oth er hand, a ccessibili ty of casks appears to be greater than of
spent fuel pool s located in massive buildin gs.
Improvements  of th e storage concept a re conceivable. How ever, they likely only have a chance
of being impleme nted if the inv entories are not too l arge; for example,  in case of a rapid ph ase-
out of nu clear power.

D.1.iv: Terrorist Attacks on Nuclear Transports
The commercial use of nu clear pow er is dependent on a  worldwid e system of t ranspo rts of
radioactive mate rials. Ma ny transpo rts occur year by year, between uranium mining a nd
processing, enrichment, fuel element  fabrication, nu clear powe r plants, int ermedi ate waste
storage facilities, reprocessing plants and oth er installation s.
During transpo rt, radioactive subs tances are a potential target for terrorists. Of th e nume rous
mate rials being shipp ed, the  following are the mos t important:
1.Spent fu el elements from nuclear pow er plants and hi ghly active wastes from
reprocessin g (high specific inv entory of radioactive subst ances)
2.Plutonium  from reprocessing (high radiotoxicit y, particularly if released as aerosol)
3.Uranium  hexafluor ide – uranium  has to be concerted into t his chemica l form in order to
undergo enrichment  (high chemical toxicit y of released sub stances, resulting in
immediate h ealth effects in case of release)
Since the am ounts transported with on e shipment  are about se veral tonnes a t most,  the releases
to be exp ected will be smalle r by orders of ma gnitud es than thos e that result f rom attack of a
storage facility – even if th e transport containers are severely damag ed. On the oth er hand, th e
place where the  release occurs cannot b e foreseen, a s attacks c an occur, in p rinciple, everywhere
along the transpo rt routes. Thos e routes often go through urban areas; for example  at ports or
during rail transport.
Thus, r eleases can take place in d ensely popul ated regions, leading to severe damage to m any
people, even if th e area affected is compa ratively small.
The hazards of t errorist attacks against nu clear transpo rts wil l be illustrated in this s ection b y
two examples:  Spent fuel or highly active reprocessing waste transports, and uranium
hexafluor ide transports. I n the first case, the hazard is due to t he int ense radiation of th e released
subst ances; in th e second, to th eir high chemical toxicit y.
Attack of a Spent Fuel or Highly Active Waste Transport [HIRSCH 2001 ]
Transport casks fo r spent fuel or  highly active waste from reprocessing typically are massive
cast iron or  steel container with a  weight of ar ound 100 t ons. (For more details, see sub- section
D.1.iii ) They are transported on a  heavy truck or special rail wagon.
A transport cask for spent fuel or  highly active reprocessing waste can be penetrated by an
armour -piercing weapon, w hich c an be fired from a distance of se veral hundr ed mete rs (see sub -
section D .1.iii). Rel eases can be in t he order of 500 T Bq of c aesium- 137 ( which is t aken as the
lead nu clide here, du e to it s radiotoxicit y and vol atility) or more.
Most of th e caesium  released will s ettle over an area of a few 1000 m2 around th e location of th e
damaged ca sk, creating an intense radiation field whi ch will r ender the rescue of p eople
extremel y difficult an d hazardous, a nd countermeasu res (such as sealing the opening in the cask
wall) all but impos sible.
Part of th e caesium  will sp read fu rther, in wind di rection, a s a radioactive cloud of small
particles. Ground will b e contaminat ed by fall-out ( and was h-out in c ase of ra in). If there are
unfavou rable weather conditi ons, ground c ontamination can reach values to n ecessitate
permanent r esettlement  of th e popul ation in d istances of 5 km  down wind, or more. Thus,
villages and small  towns at the transport route might h ave to b e evacuated to a  large extent, a nd
   112 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

cease to exist  as functionin g social un its. Effects can sti ll be more severe in c ase of sp ent fuel
transpo rts if cask d amage is such to permit  sufficient a ir ingress so th at fuel hull s, consistin g of
inflammable  zircalloy, can start burning.
Attack of a Uranium Hexafluoride Transport
Uranium  hexafluor ide is transpo rted in containers of th e type 48”Y, if it i s mate rial yet to be
enriched, o r depleted uranium.  Thos e are steel containers with a wall thi ckness of me rely 16
mm; they can be loaded wit h up to 12.5 t U F6. One container can be t ransported on a t ruck; in
case of ra il transport, up to th ree on a  wagon [UR ENC O 2001].
If a road transpo rt of u ranium  hexafluoride is attacked, a tanker with petrol o r liquid g as could
be used as a “weapon”, particularly in case of a  suicide attack. Aft er a violent collision with t he
uranium  hexafluo ride transpo rt, th e tanker will be severely damag ed (particularly if it a lso
carries an explosive loa d). At th e site of th e accident, a  hot fi re lastin g several hou rs will result.
A container of t he type 48”Y will f ail after about 50 minut es in a fire with a  flame tempe rature
of 800° C.  Failure will occur earlier in c ase of hi gher flame temper atures (1000° C  and m ore
could in f act be reached). Th e steel cylinder will burst. Pa rt of the UF6 will b e ejected hi gh into
the air, the  remainder will be thrown piecewise in the  nearer surroundin gs. Chemical reaction
with th e humidit y of th e air will produce, among oth ers, H F (hydrofluoric acid). HF is a  very
severe respiratory poison a s well as contact poison.
It is qu estion able wh ether the fire brigade will b e able to extin guish suc h a severe fire before the
container bursts. Att empts  to extin guish th e fire with water, after the container has failed, c an
increase formation  and release of H F.
In the immediate vi cinity of the site of th e accident (u p to a bout 100 m  distance), there is acute
mortal d anger. In a distance of up t o 500 m,  people will suff er severe poisonin g and burning
from HF. In case of l onger exposur e times, there is mortal d anger also in this r egion. Ev en in
distances of more th an 1 km,  there is th e risk for health d amage for sensitiv e people
[ALBRECHT 1988].
The sho rt-term consequences of su ch an attack, regarding health effects and deaths c aused by
HF, can be drastic – in pa rticular, if t he attack takes place in a densely popul ated region. It is
possibl e tha t thous ands of people will b e killed and in jured. Addition al effects will r esult fr om
uranium  contamination.  Uranium  is a metal of relatively low sp ecific activity, but considerable
chemical toxicit y. If it is the product of r eprocessin g, it could c ontain fu rther toxic  radio-
nuclides. If the attack takes place in a rural area, on th e oth er hand, th ere will b e severe damage
to plant a nd anima l life.
Conclusion
Terrorist attacks against tr ansports of r adioactive mate rials ca n occur almost  everywhere in
indust rialized countries. Th e consequences, in t erms of radiological land c ontamination  and/or
chemical po isoning, ca n be dramatic.
This h azard is one more reason wh y nuclear mat erials’ transports should b e avoided as far as
possibl e, and th e ma terials sto red at  the pl ace of t heir origin. To m ake storage facilities less
vulnerable, robust a nd disp ersed st orage concept should b e imple mented,  as described fo r spent
fuel casks in sub-section D.1.i ii.
Regarding uranium hexafluoride, uranium  should  be neither transpo rted, no r stored in this
chemical form. Conve rsion to m ore chemically inert and ph ysically stable compounds  is
possibl e.

D.2 Climate Change and Nuclear Safety 
Introduction 
Glob al climat e change is a reality. There is a  broad consensus amon g scientists regarding this
issue. The  exceptionall y hot sum mer of 2003 in Eu rope will not r emain an exc eption. On t he
contrary, such extr eme weather events ma y become  the norm [MUNICH 2005].
In this s ection, extreme weather events and th eir effects on th e hazards o f nuclear pow er plants
will b e discussed. T he dis cussion will c oncentrate on thos e parts of th e wo rld wh ere most
nuclear pow er plants are operating.
Regarding climate change and the consequences to be expe cted, the  section is b ased ma inly on
publi cations of th e Intergovernmental Pan el on Climate  Chan ge (IPCC) a nd of the  Muni ch Re
re-insurance company. The IPCC has been establish ed in 1998 b y the WM O (World
Meteorological Or ganisation) a nd the UNEP  (United Na tions Envi ronment  Programme)  to
assess sc ientific, technical and so cio- economic  information relevant fo r the und erstanding of
climate ch ange, its pot ential impa cts and options fo r adaptation a nd mit igation. Th e IPCC’s
Third  Assessm ent R eport was complet ed in 2001 [ IPCC 2001].  The G eo Risks Research team at
Muni ch Re has been analysing and do cumentin g natural hazards an d the effects of climate
change throughout th e wo rld fo r about 30 y ears now. For risk ma nagers in th e insu rance indus try
it is important not onl y to look a t the indivi dual e vents in isolation but a lso and above that to
consider identifiable trends. 
In order to demons trate the beginning climat e change, natural extr eme events which ha ve
occurred in th e years 2003 a nd 2004 will b e briefly reported. Of p articular importan ce are storms
and floods, whi ch also may occur in c ombination. Furthermore, in cidents that h ave already taken
place at nuclear pow er plants during extreme weather conditions a nd whi ch can be regarded as
the harbingers of futur e events will be discussed. Thos e incidents clearly show how c omplex the
situations cr eated by extreme natural events can be. Site -specific problems became apparent in
most  cases. F urthermore, it b ecame clear that the personn el of th e plants c oncerned we re not
prepared fo r this t ype of eme rgency and that the  access to th e site from outsid e, and hence the
possibiliti es to b ring in outsid e help, were severely restricted.
For a realistic assessment of the hazards, th e possibility of two ext reme events o ccurring at about
the same time  also has to b e taken into a ccount. T wo extr eme events c an have the same cause
(as in the case of a  tropical cyclone which is a ccompa nied by strong rain, giving raise to floods ).
Furthermore, b ecause of t he in creasing frequency of extr eme events, it cannot b e exclud ed th at
an NPP  site will b e hit b y two inde pendent e vents within a short time – the second e vent
occurring while the damage from the first has not y et been repaired. 
Extreme  weather conditions c an lead to f ailure of the electricity grid. In this situ ation,
emergency pow er systems are required whi ch are not necessarily suffi ciently reliable and the
failure of whi ch can lead to a severe accident. Therefore, blackout s ituations a re specially
considered in this s ection.
Finally, counter-meas ures and th eir limit s are briefly discussed.

Climate Change – an Overview
Observed Changes in th e Climate System
It is more th an lik ely that human  activiti es have already caused a discernibl e impa ct on obs erved
warming t rends. There is a high correlation b etween inc reases in global temperature and
increases in c arbon dioxi de and oth er greenhouse gas concentrations du ring the era of rapid
indust rialization a nd popul ation g rowth, fr om 1860 to th e present. Th e IPCC describes the
observed changes in th e climate s ystem a s follow [I PCC 2001]:
•The global av erage surface tempe rature has increased by 0.6 ±0.2°C  since the late 19th
century. More hot d ays and heat waves ov er nearly all land ar eas are expe cted.
•Annu al precipitation on l and ha s continued to i ncrease in th e middle  and hi gh latitudes of
the No rthern Hemispher e (in the  order of 0.5 % to 1% /decade), exce pt over Eastern As ia. 
•A decrease of th e cover of l and b y snow a nd ic e continu es to be pos itively correlated
with in creasing land-surface temperatures. Sat ellite data show th at, very likely, there
have been decreases of a bout 10 % in th e extent of snow cover. 
•Based on ti de gauge data, the rate of global mea n sea level rise during the 20t h century is
in the range 1.0 to 2.0 m m/yr, with a central value of 1.5 m m/yr. Deep ocean
temper atures change only slowl y; therefore, thermal expansion w ould continue for man y
centuries. Aft er thermal expan sion, t he me lting of mountain  glaciers and ice caps is
expe cted to m ake the largest contribution to th e rise of se a level over the next hund red
years. 
Based on th e temper ature forecasts, the IPCC h as produced a list of lik ely effects of c limate
change, most  of whi ch are negative for human  living conditions. Th ese include mor e freque nt
heat wa ves; more int ense storms (hurricanes, tropical cyclones, etc.); increased in tensity of
floods a nd droughts; warmer su rface temper atures, especially at higher latitudes; rising sea
levels, which could inund ate coastal areas and sm all island nations.
Extreme Events
The results of re search performed by climat e scientists indi cate that ev en slight ch anges in
temper ature have a tremendous impact on t he correspondi ng extreme values (v alues within th e
upper or lowe r ten percentiles). It is to be  feared tha t extreme events whi ch can be traced to
climate ch ange will have increasingly grave consequences in th e future. How ever, in g eneral, the
analysis of ext reme events in both obs ervations a nd co upled models  is not w ell developed.
Trends in s evere weather events ar e noto rious ly difficult to detect because of th eir relatively rare
occurrence and large spatial variability [IPCC  2001].
Precipitation
Precipitation amounts  increase if the earth gets warmer b ecause more w ater evaporates an d the
atmosphe re can hold mor e water vapour . The water cycle becomes more intense as a result a nd
the probability of torrential rain rises sub stantially. It is lik ely that total atmospheri c water
vapou r has increased se veral percent per decade over man y regions of the No rthern Hemis phere
(where 99 %  of all NPPs  are located). New analyses show that in regions wh ere total
precipitation h as increased, it is v ery likely that there have been even more p ronoun ced increases
in heavy and extreme precipitation events. I n some  regions, however, heavy and extr eme events
have increased despite the fact that tot al precipitation h as decreased or remain ed constant. Mo re
intense and mor e frequent p recipitation e vents in creased flood, l andslide, avalanche und
mudslide  damage, and also soil e rosion.

Storms
Analysis of and co nfidence in extreme event simulations with in climate mode ls are still
emerging, particularly for storm tracks an d sto rm freque ncy. “Tropical-cyclone-like” vortices are
being simulated in c limate m odels, althou gh considerable uncertainty remain s over their
interpretation to w arrant caution in projections of tr opical cyclone changes. 
The regions affected by rare and exc eptional events in 2004 w ere regions wh ere the exposur e to
tropical cyclones was well-known f rom historical time  series. What made 2004 sp ecial w as the
fact that tropical cyclones had reached regional frequencies and – in the  case of Hurricane Ivan –
intensiti es that w ere obs erved for the first time in the time ever since meteo rological data are
available. To a ttribut e this to th e natural variability of sto rm activity is no lon ger really plausible.
The results of cl imate simulations  indicate that the storm hazard in th e Atl antic will c ontinue to
increase in th e long term. 2004 w as a year of sto rm records not on ly in th e Atl antic but a lso in
the West  Pacific. The  number o f tropical cyclones in Japan w as the highest ever since the
systematic recording of tr opical cyclone track data first began [MUN ICH 2005] .
 Projection s of Fu ture Change s in Extreme Events
Precipitation extr emes are projected to in crease more th an th e mean va lues. The freque ncy of
extreme precipitation events is p rojected to in crease almost  everywhere.
There is little agreement yet among models  concerning future changes in mid- latitude sto rm
intensit y, frequency, and variability. There is littl e consistent e vidence concerning the changes in
the projected freque ncy of tropical cyclones and areas of formation. Howeve r, some  modellin g
studi es su ggest that the upp er limit  of th e intensiti es could increase. Me an and peak precipitation
intensiti es from tropical cyclones are likely to in crease appreciably.
An in crease of hot d ays and heat waves is very likely over nearly all land a reas. 
Very small-scale phenome na such as thunde rstorms, tornadoe s, hail, a nd lightning are not
simulated in g lobal models , but an inc rease is a lso feared [IPCC  2001].  
Uncertain ties
A full a ssessment  of the  range of climate change consequences and probabilities involv es a
cascade of un certainties regarding emis sions, carbon cycle respons e, climate respons e, and
impacts. F urthermore, there are uncertainties associated with the probabilities generated with
carbon c ycle modell ing, and, e qually impor tant, uncertainties sur roundin g climate response
sensit ivity estimated from climate m odels . The IPCC a lso suggested th at, particularly for rapid
and subst antial temperature increases, climate change could t rigger “surprises”: rapid, non -linear
respons es of the climate s ystem to a nthropogenic influenc es expe cted to o ccur when
environmental th resholds are crossed and new equilibriums are reached.
Furthermore, un expect ed fe edback effects and irreversible phase transitions in th e comple x
“atmosphere – ea rth – o cean – ice” system (e.g. changes in ocean currents) can make al l
prognoses wo rthless. Ho wever, in a ccordance with th e precaution ary principle, humankind
would b e well-advised to b e prepared fo r dramatic changes [SCHNE IDER 2005]

Consequences of Climate Change for NPP Hazards
The pot ential threat climat e change constit utes for nuclear power plants can be illust rated by

with th e beginning climate change and mus t be regarded as precursors of wo rse incidents and

•USA,  1993: I n July 1993, th e operator of t he Coope r NPP  on the Mis souri Rive r, Nebraska,
was fo rced to shut do wn the reactor as dykes and levees collapsed a round th e site closin g
many eme rgency escape routes in the region. B elow g rade rooms  in th e reactor and tu rbine
buildin gs had extens ive in-leakage with rising water levels. Th e NRC  inspe ctors no ted tha t
plant p ersonnel “had not  establi shed m easures to divert th e water away from impo rtant

•USA,  1992: I n August 1992, Hu rricane And rew passed di rectly over Turkey Point NPP
(Florida), with a  sustained wind s peed of 145 – 175 mph  (230-280 km/h).  There are two
nuclear reactors and two oil -fired pl ants at the site. The plant lost all offsit e pow er during the
storm and th e followin g five days. Fortunately, about two years ago the op erator was fo rced

   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 119

because the Turkey Point sit e includes two fossil -fueled units. Th e fuel oil sto rage tank of

combustible  fuel oil onto the  site. Fortunately, the fu el oil did not i gnite with the passin g
storm [GUNTER 2004; WI SE 1992a ].
•USA,  1998: I n June 1998, th e Davis-Besse nuclear pow er station ( Ohio ), whil e at 99%
power was hit by a tornado wit h wind s between 113 a nd 156 mph  (180 a nd 250 km/h).
Lightning strikes to th e station’s switchyard and w inds ca used a loss-of-offsite pow er
automatic ally shutti ng the reactor dow n. Three independe nt offsite powe r lines were
knocked dow n along with th e station’s telephon e fibre opt ic system. The eme rgency diesel
generators (EDG ) A and B  were started to power priority safety systems. EDG A h ad to b e
started locally because bad swi tch contacts in th e control room prevented a remote s tart.
Then, p roblems due to faulty ventilation e quipment arose, threatening to ov erheat the
emergency diesel generators. Ev en with the  EDG s running, the loss of of fsite pow er meant
that electricity supply to certain eq uipment  was interrupted, in cludin g the cooling systems
for the ons ite spent fu el pool. Water t emper ature in the pool r ose from 43° C  to 58° C.
Offsit e pow er was narrowly restored to D avis-Besse safety systems a fter 23 hour s just a s
diesel generator B was fin ally declared inop erable [GUNTE R 2004].
•France, 1999: Th e French electricity grid was hit h ard by storms on D ecember 27: About 180
high-volt age towe rs broke dow n and nin e mill ion people found th emselves c ut off f rom the
grid. The NPP  at Blayais suffered th e loss of a uxiliar y 225 kV powe r suppli es fo r the fou r
units a t the site, as well as a loss of th e 400 kV powe r grid at units 2 an d 4. Th e loa d
shedding design that allows the unit s to self-suppl y with e lectrical pow er after disconn ection
from the grid failed. This l ed to a n automatic shut- down of th ese two units. The diesel
generators we re started and fun ction ed until the  connection to th e 400 kV pow er grid wa s
restored, a fter about three hou rs. Furthermore, a  flood caused by the confluence of th e rising
tide with exc eptionally strong winds re sulted in th e partial subm ergence of t he Blayais site.
The flood s tarted two hou rs before the tidal peak. At 10: 00 pm, a high wa ter alarm for the
Gironde was transmitted  to unit 4. I t is not eworthy that the information  concerning the high
level was  not tr ansmitted  to units 1, 2, a nd 3.
The winds push ed th e water over the protective dyke. Invading the sit e through und erground
service tunn els, th e water flood ed th e pumps  of uni t's 1 e ssential service water system
(ESWS), and one of th e two t rains (with two e ssential service water system pum ps each) was
lost b ecause the motors  were flooded. Furthermor e, other facilities were flooded; mos t
notably:
- Some utility galleries, particularly thos e running in the vi cinity of th e fuel building linking
the pump  hous e to th e platform;
- some  rooms  containing outgoing electrical feeders. The presence of w ater in t hese rooms
indirectly led to th e unavailability of certain electrical swit chbo ards;
- the bottom of th e fuel build ing of Units 1 a nd 2 c ontaining the rooms  of the two L HSI
pumps  and the two c ontainment  spray system pumps.  The nuclear operator considered that
the pumps  were completely unavailable. The systems to whi ch th ese pumps  belong are vital
for safety and are designed mainl y to compens ate for breaks in th e primar y system.
The French standard safety rule contains two c riteria for flood pr otection: (1 ) placing the
platform that suppo rts safety-relevant e quipment at a level at least as high as the ma ximum
water level; and (2) blocking any possible routes through whi ch exte rnal wa ters could r each
reactor safety equipment  located be low the  level of th e site platform. At Bl ayais, both
criteria were not me t: the concrete platform was 1.5 me ter too low; a nd the resistance of th e
fire doo rs in th e tunn els to th e und erground s afety equipment  was miscal culated: the  waters
surged into t he tunn els and simply broke through the doors. Before the incident, ED F

•Germany, 2004: On F ebruary 8, both Bi blis PW Rs (A and B)  were in op eration at full

incorrectly set electrical switch and a faulty pressure gauge, the Biblis-B turbine did not

Vulnerability of Atomic Power Plants in the Case of Grid Failure 
Nuclear pow er plants generate electric pow er and suppl y it to th e offsit e grid. On the other hand,
the plants thems elves are dependent on a  continuous el ectric pow er suppl y to op erate,
particularly for the instrumentation a nd safety systems, even wh en th ey are shut down. A t ypical
nuclear pow er station is conne cted to the  electric grid through three or mor e transmission lines.
Heavy storms can lead to multiple  damage of the  transmission  lines, and hence to loss o f off-site
power. Also, there can be grid failures even if transmission lines in the  vicinity of th e NPP
remain int act. The  probability of general grid failures wi ll also in crease du e to present
developme nt trends not r elated to th e climate (liberalisation, c ost p ressure). 
Should  the pow er lines to the  NPP  be cut-off o r a regional electrical grid collapse occur, onsite
emergency generators are designed to a utomatic ally start. Ev ery nuclear powe r plant h as
emergency pow er suppl ies, whi ch are often di esel-driven. Th ese generators provide pow er to
special electrical safety distributi on panels. Th ese panels in tu rn suppl y pow er to thos e
   Nuclear Reactor Hazards 121

emergency pumps,  valves, fans, and oth er components  that are required to operate to k eep th e
plant in a  safe state. 
If the emergency diesel generators (EDG ) fail, the  situation a t the plant becomes critical
(“station blackout”). A n atural disaster that disables the in coming pow er lines to a nuclear pow er
station c oupled with t he failure of on- site eme rgency generators can result in s evere accident.
Apart from the di esel generators, th ere are also batteries that suppl y direct current in c ase of an
emergency; how ever, the batteries ca nnot p rovid e electricity for large components  such as
pumps  and have onl y very limited  capacity (typically for about 2 hour s).
NRC  reviews in recent years have show n that a station blackout a t a nuclear pow er station is a
major c ontribut or to s evere core damage frequency. According to NR C studi es, over 50% of a ll
postul ated accidents l eading to a core melt  accident begin with a  station bl ackout [PORZTLINE
2001].  Without electricity the operator loos es instrumentation a nd control pow er leading to an
inability to cool the reactor core. Counte r measu res (accident ma nagement ) are practically
impossible.  If the blackout l asts fo r a long time,  not onl y the reactor, but a lso th e fuel in th e
spent fuel pool ca n overheat, contributin g to radioactive releases.
Every nuclear pow er plant h as at least two em ergency diesel generators. Th ese generators are
typically tested on e or two t imes per month,  when th ey are run fo r about one to four  hours.
Several times per year, the di esels may be run for up to 24 hou rs to e nsure that the equipment
would fun ction du ring a loss of offsit e pow er.
How ever, emergency pow er systems with diesel generator are notor iously troubl e-prone.
Distu rbances in the eme rgency power system are respons ible for a considerable number o f
reportable events in nu clear pow er plants. Emergency diesel generator defects and problems at
US nuclear plants as reported to occur on a w eekly basis. In 1999, th ere were 32 r eports
affecting virtually half (4 9.5%) of a ll US  nuclear plants [PORZT LINE 2001] . Over 40% of U.S.
nuclear pow er plant eme rgency diesel generators (EDG) are obsolete. EDG volt age regulators,
typically of 1950 -60 vint age, have recently expe rienced ageing and ob solescence problems that
have created a heightened awareness among nu clear utilities because of th e threat to ov erall
EDG p erformance [EPRI 2004].
In German y, 24 %  of all reportable events in 2003 o ccurred in the  emergency powe r suppl y
system – a bout h alf of the m concerning the Diesel generators, and half other compone nts [BFS
2004].
In addition, the fuel in store for the EDG is limited. If a failure of th e off-site electricity suppl y is
connected with adverse effects on the traffic inf rastructure, whi ch appears probably in the event
of natural hazards, it is qu estionable whe ther additional fuel can be brought to th e site in time.
All in a ll, there is r eason fo r concern regarding the precautions fo r emergency power suppl y at
NPP sites. Re gulations an d practices governing these precautions still r eflect the conditions  of
the 1980 s and are not a ppropriate for the present situ ation of in creasing hazards t o the electricity
grid due to climate c hange as well as due  to th e liberalization of the electricity mark ets an d the
increased th reat of t errorist a ttacks.
Indeed, the grid failures and bl ackouts that have occurred in 2003 c learly show th e increasing
danger. The grid failure in th e USA and Cana da in Au gust led to the shut down of 22 NPPs
[WISE 2003].
In the same year, two major e lectricity blackout s also occurred within on e week in Eur ope. Both
might h ave been connected to w eather conditi ons. The first bi g blackout o ccurred Sept ember 23
in Denmark an d Swe den. Aft er a scram at the Swedis h NPP  Oskarshma n-3, Ringhals-3 and -4
also scrammed due to technical problems at a relay station, possibly caused by high winds
[NUCWEEK 47_03] .
   122 Nuclear Reactor Haz ards

Italy was hit b y a blackout on 28 Sept ember. The failure started du e to problems in a high-
voltage connection line between Switzerl and a nd Italy, possibl y because of sto rms.
In all three cases, problems at one single line or station r esulted in a  cascading event wh en more
and more lin es and st ations started to t rip and dis conn ect.
The blackout in No rth Am erica pos sibly also caused da mage to som e of the  affected NPPs.
Restart of Indian Poi nt-3 was  delayed, as repairs were needed on e lectrical cables in the  control
rod mech anism. Fermi-2 we nt back to pow er after damage was  repaired at turbine equipment,
pumps  and circuit boards. Th e components  got damaged wh en th ey were overheated in the
sudd en pow er loss. Davis-Besse suff ered un expe cted damage during the bl ackout. A me tal
bellow in a  containment  air cooler was deformed,  apparently by a surge in w ater pressure
(bellows are attached to th e water pipi ng leading to each cooler to a llow i t to expand a nd
contract in respons e to t empe rature changes) [NUCWEEK 38_03].
The Oskarshamn-3, re actor scrammed Sept. 23, c ontributin g to grid failure and a massive
blackout in sout hern Sweden. W hen operators attempted to restart the unit, a  thermal transient
occurred, with c oolant te mper ature increase exceeding operating limits.  Both regulators and
plant op erators were concerned th at the incident, ra ted Level 1 on I NES (International Nu clear
Event Sc ale) could h ave caused damag e to th e vessel, when hot a nd co lder water met
[NUCWEEK 47_03] .
Thos e events illustrate that the direct ini tiation o f a nuclear accident is not th e onl y hazard
associated with g rid failure. Such f ailures can also have ind irect effects affecting plant safety.
Furthermore, in c ase of a  grid failure of longer duration, t raffic and communication
infrastructures will be ma ssively impair ed. T hus, eme rgency measu res that migh t be required in
case of an  accident with radioactive releases (for example,  information  of th e popul ation,
evacuation) will b e hind ered. Monit oring and alarm systems migh t not b e operational.
Vulnerability of Atomic Power Plants in the Case of Flooding 
Coolin g needs of nu clear reactors dictate a location a t the sea or at a large river. All r eactors on
sea coasts are endangered by sea level rise. Ov er the next hundr ed years there will b e significant
rises, while many sea coasts, for exam ple in E ngland, a re gradually sinki ng. Many closed
nuclear reactor sites could be flooded, in cludin g the stored nu clear waste. Th at co uld
contaminate the coast lin es fo r decades. B ack in 1992 a  stud y was performed  in th e U.K. on
flood th reats to U .K. nuclear reactors. All bu t one of the U.K. reactors are located on s ea coasts
at or near sea level. By 2025, s everal nuclear sites are predicted to be  under water. Until now, no
protective meas ures around nu clear sites in the U.K. o r anywhere else have been taken [WIS E
2000b].  It also seems likely that natural land move ments  along the south -eastern coastlin e of
China ( currently sinking), where the Chines e NPPs  are located, w ould exacerbate the effects of
sea level rise [WISE 1992b].  
New measu rements show tha t the world's oceans h ave heated up just a s predicted in c omputer
models,  and, more ominousl y, that massive amounts  of freshwater from melti ng A rctic ice are
seeping into th e Atl antic Ocean [BORENS TEIN 2005] .
Recently, an IAEA Safety Guide w as publi shed w hich is to p rovid e recommendati ons relating to
the evaluation of t he flood h azard fo r a nuclear powe r plant on a  coastal or river site so a s to
enable the identifi cation o f hazardous phenomena a ssociated with f loodin g events to the  site
[IAEA 2003].
According to this I AEA Safety Guid e, the region sha ll be assessed to de termine  the pot ential for
floodin g due to one  or more n atural causes su ch as runoff re sulting from precipitation o r sno w
melt,  high tide, storm surge, seiche and wind w aves that ma y affect the safety of th e nuclear

installation. Th e pos sible combinations  of th e effects of several causes sh all be examined.  The
potential for instability of th e coastal area or river channel du e to erosion o r sedimentation sh all
be inv estigated. Information relating to upst ream water control structures shall b e analysed to
determine  whether the nuclear installation would b e able to withst and th e effects resulting from
the failure of on e or more of th e upstream structures.
According to IAEA, the effects of floodin g on a  nuclear power plant sit e ma y have a major
bearing on th e safety of th e plant a nd ma y lead to a  postul ated in itiating event th at is to be
included in th e plant sa fety analysis. The expe cted ma in effects of floodin g on NPP  are as
follows [ IAEA 2003]:
•The presence of water in man y areas of th e plant ma y be a com mon cause of failure for
safety related systems, such as the emer gency pow er suppl y systems o r the electric
switchyard, with th e associated possibilit y of losin g the external connection to the
electrical powe r grid, the decay heat removal s ystem a nd oth er vital systems. 
•Considerable dama ge can also be caused to s afety related structures, systems a nd
compone nts by the infiltration of w ater into int ernal areas of the plant, induc ed by high
flood le vels caused by the rise of th e water table. W ater pressure on w alls and
found ations m ay challenge their structural capacity. Deficiencies in the s ite drainage
systems and in non-w aterproof structures may also cause floodin g of the site.
•The dynamic effect of th e water can be damaging to th e structure and the  founda tions  of
the plant as well as the many systems and c ompone nts located outsid e the plant. I n such
cases there could a lso be  major  erosion a t the site bound ary.
•A flood ma y transport  ice floes in v ery cold weather or debris of a ll types which ma y
physically damage structures, obstr uct w ater intakes or damag e the water drainage
system.
•Flooding may also af fect the communication and t ransport networks a round th e plant
site. The effects may jeopardize the imple mentation  of safety related mea sures by
operators and th e emergency planning by making es cape routes impassable and is olating
the plant site in a possible  emer gency, with consequent diffi culties in com muni cation
and s upply.
•Flooding can also contribute t o the dispersion o f radioactive material to th e environm ent
in an accident [IAEA 2003] .
Isolation o f the site is a specific consequence of a n ext ernal event whi ch mus t be taken into
account when definin g the required eme rgency provisions.
All in a ll, it appears lik ely that in the decades to come, th e hazards a ssociated with floodin g will
increase for man y nuclear pow er plants wo rld-wide and could e ven become  dominant  in some
cases. It is highly questionable wh ether NPP  operators an regulatory authorities are fully aware
of this p roblem.
Vulnerability of Nuclear Power Plants by Other Natural Hazards
In the sum mer of 2003, th e highest tempe ratures occurring so far were recorded in Fr ance. The
heat wa s exce ptional in both int ensit y and du ration. A pot ential impact on t he safety level of
French NPP  units was seen th rough high air temperature, high cooling water temper ature and
low c oolin g water level [T HUMA 2004].  
Long-lasting and repeated heat wa ves can also lead to un expect ed acceleration of a geing
processes, in creasing the probability of safety system failure in c ase of an  accident.

Other risk factors are the possibilit y of in creased frequency and int ensity of hailsto rms and
sleets. Also, heat and dry weather have led to an increased occurrence of forest fi res in th e last
years.
Possible Counter-measures
Nuclear pow er plant str uctures, systems, and compone nts impor tant to safety are to be designed
to withst and th e ext ernal effects of natural ph enomen a such as  tornadoes, hu rricanes, or floods
without loss of c apability to perform their safety functions. Extreme  values for wind,
precipitation, s now, temper ature and sto rm surges, based on em pirical data from the weather
statistics, are used fo r calculating the design paramet ers and estimating the impact lo ad from
severe weather conditions. 
The apparent increase of f requency and intensity of extr eme weather conditions in th e past few
years has resulted partially in a re-assessment of po tential consequences of su ch effects, and
heightening of the  standards fo r NPP  design. For exa mple, regarding floodin g of nuclear pow er
plants in G ermany, the plants now h ave to be designed against an event wi th a probability of
1:10,000 p er year, while it wa s 1:1,000  years before [KTA  2004].
The estimation of probabilities for extr eme events resulting from climate c hange, how ever, is
extremel y difficult du e to f act that there is no suffi cient d atabase for suc h estimates.
Furthermore, b ecause the situation is c onstantly evolving, any data that can be acquired ma y be
outdated by the time their evaluation is c oncluded.
The time lag is still more drastic for the drafting of new rules and regulations by the authorities,
and th eir implementation  by the NPP  operators. It seems hardly possible to win this r ace against
time – particularly in th e face of economic  pressure that might l ead to the  result th at onl y low-
cost measures are realised.
The inadequate protection a gainst floods at  the Blayais site illustrates the problem of delayed
backfitting (however, in t his case, even the backfit woul d not h ave prevented floodin g).
In spite of the  fact that the hazards of cl imate change are becoming more a nd more obvious,
safety reassessments and improvements  generally are only impleme nted – if at all – af ter an
event o ccurred. Th is practice is ag gravated by the fact that an event in on e NPP  does not
necessarily lead to backfits in a nother plant, let alone to b ackfits w orldwid e.
Regarding the new re actor generations ( Generation I II and IV), the in creasing hazards du e to
climate ch ange have not b een taken into a ccount in th eir design, as far as can be seen tod ay.
Apart from improving d esign, advance warning in case of extreme events can contribut e to
safety. For example,  the U.S.  NRC is now ob serving the development  of sto rms. In connection
to tropical cyclones, factors lik e ext reme wind spe ed, p ressure and precipitation a re of
importan ce. About 12 hou rs before expe cted hu rricane-force winds, NRC will e nter one of its
respons e mode s and begin receiving continuous st atus upd ates from all of th e nuclear facilities
in the hurricane's path [NR C2005 ]. According to NR C, severe tornadoe s can produce winds a nd
tornado miss iles that can badly damag e steel reinforced concrete structures. (Ageing
mech anisms  can aggravate such effects- see section C.) I t was assumed  that a tornado c ould a lso
significantly damage support s ystems fo r onsit e irradiated fuel storage ponds . Furthermore,
tornadoes may induc e floods a nd consequently may be the cause of a ddition al indir ect damage.
In Cent ral Eur ope, too, t ornadoe s have received increased a ttention in the  last years [NRC
2005].
An a dvance warning system ca n permit the implementation  of protective me asures at NPP sites
before the hurricane arrives. It is not c onceivable, howe ver, to avoid large-scale grid failures

with th e aid of p rotective measu res. Th e ma in problem is th at most  grid lines are above ground
and thu s, very vuln erable. Their masts  are not designed to w ithstand severe storms.
