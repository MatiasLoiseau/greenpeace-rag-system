The mechanism would seek to properly align
incentives for both industrialised and developing
countries.  Industrialised countries’ financing
obligations would be directly linked to the amount of
their total domestic greenhouse gas emissions and
those countries who take drastic action to reduce
emissions at home would only have to make a
minimal mandatory contribution to REDD.  Developing
countries who accurately monitor and report on their
mitigation actions would receive a higher return for
their services, providing a strong incentive for
countries to continually improve their forest protection
programmes.  The system would provide individual
industrialised countries with some compliance
flexibility while providing a significant and reliable
stream of financing for tropical forests.

Below, we outline and elaborate on some of the
critical elements of the proposal, followed by a brief
comparison of market-linked mechanisms with
market-offset mechanisms.

Introduction

The Greenpeace Forests for Climate (Tropical
Deforestation Emission Reduction Mechanism
TDERM)1 proposal for a hybrid market-linked
fund would provide the financing needed to help
protect the world’s remaining tropical forests by
reducing emissions from deforestation and
forest degradation in developing countries
(REDD).  This new mechanism would become
part of the next (post-2012) phase of the Kyoto
Protocol, although financing could be made
available as early as 2009.  A critical element of
this proposal or any REDD mechanism would be
to attain both climate and biodiversity objectives
in a manner that fully respects the rights of
local and indigenous peoples.

Forests for Climate builds upon the polluter pays
principle and the agreement struck in Bali that
industrialised countries help finance mitigation
actions in developing countries.  In addition to their
obligations to make deep cuts in domestic
emissions, industrialised countries would provide
financing for REDD proportional to their overall
emission allowances (Assigned Amount Units,
AAUs) in the second commitment period.  Financing
for a new forest fund would be provided through the
purchase of a newly created currency, forest units
(Tropical Deforestation Emission Reduction Units,
TDERUs).2 Reductions in forest emissions would be
additional to, not at the expense of, domestic
reductions made by industrialised countries.  This is
a significant distinguishing factor between the
market-linked mechanism proposed here and
proposed market-offset mechanisms for REDD,
which would allow industrialised countries to
increase their domestic emissions in exchange for
emission reductions in developing countries.

Case study:
Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund (MPMF)

The Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund (MPMF)
provides funds to help developing countries comply
with their obligations under the Protocol to phase out
the use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) at an
agreed schedule.  It embodies the principle agreed
at the United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development in 1992 that countries have a
“common but differentiated responsibility” to protect
the natural environment.  Developed countries
contribute to the Fund to help developing countries
halt their use of ODS.  An important aspect of the
Fund is that it finances only the costs essential to
the elimination of ODSs, i.e. the additional costs
incurred in converting to non-ODS technologies.
This process has provided a precedent for striking a
balance between developing countries’ national
sovereignty issues and donor country control over
funding priorities, while ensuring the efficient
allocation of resources to actors at the sub-national
level as needed.

The Fund is managed by an Executive Committee
with an equal representation of seven industrialised
and seven developing countries which are elected
annually by a Meeting of the Parties.  The
Committee reports annually to the Meeting of the
Parties on its operations.  National governments
develop national plans of actions for ending their use
of ODSs which identify activities and actions that the
nation would like to see funded by the MPMF.  The
MPMF then conducts an analysis and cost
assessment of the various activities to determine
which are funded and how much funding they should
receive.  The Fund provides finance for a broad
range of actions including the closure of ODS
production plants and industrial conversion,
technical assistance, information dissemination,
training and capacity building aimed at phasing out
the ODS used in a broad range of sectors.

New fund for forests

Deforestation results from a complex set of direct and
underlying causes.3  While the direct economic drivers
are well known and generally the focus of REDD
discussions, the indirect causes must also be
successfully addressed in order for REDD to
succeed.4 The challenge is to establish a REDD
mechanism that can address different drivers, the
varying capacities of the countries with tropical
forests, and the rights of local and indigenous
peoples.

While any REDD mechanism will have to deal with the
many issues associated with implementation, the
overall architecture of the mechanism could affect the
way implementation takes place.  A mechanism
designed to provide offset credits for compliance
purposes could lead to policies and actions very
different to those promoted by a mechanism whose
goals are to reduce emissions, protect biodiversity,
and respect the rights of local and indigenous
peoples.

The governance and administration of the REDD
mechanism will be critical to ensuring the equitable
distribution of benefits among and within countries
with tropical forests.  The broadest participation of
countries will be needed to address the problem of
leakage and a fund would have the flexibility to
encompass countries in very different stages of
development.  The fund should include a supervisory
board with equal representation from developing and
industrialised countries, as well as other stakeholders
including indigenous peoples, civil society members,
and representatives of the other Rio Conventions.5
This could include representatives from the UN
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII),
providing greater participation and transparency to the
decision-making and implementation processes.

Fund fact: flexibility

A fund can be designed to do whatever its designers
would like it to do.  A fund can act like a market or can
provide financing under only the strictest of standards.
For instance, a fund could hold a reverse auction with
revenues received whereby countries with tropical
forests would bid on the amount offered per tCO2e
from REDD. The benefit of such an approach
compared to the direct inclusion of fully fungible
REDD credits in the markets is that the revenues
provided would better approximate the costs of
actions to REDD, rather than be driven by the market
price for tCO2e. The flexibility of a fund to address the
many complex issues associated with REDD provides
a strong argument for its adoption by Parties to the
Kyoto Protocol.

In terms of implementation, developing countries
with tropical forests should establish national
strategic action plans for REDD, in coordination with
their long term land use, development, and
infrastructure plans.  The plans should clearly lay out
the consultation and participation process with local
and indigenous peoples.

Both market-offset and market-linked mechanisms
could provide ex post payments for verified emission
reductions.  However, a market-linked fund could go
beyond this to provide payment for performance
which perhaps could not be easily quantified as an
offset credit, such as the prevention of deforestation
in countries with forests at risk (e.g. stabilisation)
and capacity building efforts (if needed).  Different
tracks for developing countries with differing
capacities could be established, providing an
incentive for developing countries to consistently
improve their forest protection programmes in order
to receive a higher rate of return for their services.
Financing for mitigation actions could then be
provided consistent with the quality of their
strategies, governance structures, monitoring and
reporting capabilities, and willingness to take on
liability.  This would provide an incentive for the
greatest number of countries to take immediate
action to protect their tropical forests regardless of
their capacities and historical deforestation rates.

A new currency for forests:
Benefits for industrialised and developing
countries

A major benefit for industrialised countries is that the
units would act as hard currency for compliance
purposes, since the fund would be responsible for
achieving the emission reductions.  The price of the
new unit for tropical forests therefore be would
linked to the world market price of other high quality
carbon permits whose emission reductions are
guaranteed.  A major benefit for developing
countries is that a certain significant amount of
funding for REDD would be guaranteed, which
would not be the case with a market-offset
mechanism.  Obtaining a high value for these units
would also allow the fund to expend resources not
only on reducing deforestation, but also preventing
deforestation in high risk areas and on capacity
building efforts (if necessary).

New currency for forests

Forests for Climate (TDERM) would create a new
currency, forest units, which would signify a visible
commitment by the global community to begin valuing
tropical forests for the environmental services they
provide.  Building upon the polluter pays principle,
industrialised countries would be required to purchase
a mandatory minimum of the new forest units
proportional to their total emission permits (AAUs),
which they currently receive for free.  Tropical forests
would become fully incorporated into the next phase
of the Kyoto Protocol and a significant guaranteed
level of funding would be available to countries who
commit to protecting their tropical forests.

While industrialised countries would bear ultimate
responsibility for financing their tropical deforestation
reduction commitment, the creation of forest
compliance units could create opportunities to pass on
the purchasing of the units to companies and other
purchasers of compliance units.  Although financing
from the purchase of the new forest units would be
genuinely additional to industrialised countries’
domestic reduction commitments, they could offered
in a manner that would provide these countries some
flexibility in their compliance efforts.  This purchase
could be done as part of the greater auction (see
below) or through a sale of forest units at a price
linked to the world market price for emission
allowances.  The availability and initial purchasing
price for these units, as well as the actions they fund,
could be set in a manner to encourage their purchase
over other generic emission allowances.

6

Industrialised countries’ overall commitment to climate

Market-linked mechanisms like Forests for Climate (FFC) offer the ability to reduce emissions beyond the
commitment made by industrialised countries. For instance, if Annex I countries agreed to a 30% reduction target,
they could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30% through Forests for Climate. Under a
market-offset approach, the original 30% commitment would likely be weakened due to the REDD problems of
leakage, additionality and permanence.

A new compliance unit for tropical forests would also
provide other major benefits.  The forest units would
make transparent the transfer and operation of other
carbon units within domestic and regional carbon
markets, in turn helping to improve future rules
relating to trading, holding, etc.  The transparency of
these systems will help ensure the comparability of
efforts.  Also, compared to generic emission
allowances and other options, the forest units could
be an attractive compliance option for companies
wishing to bolster their image as contributing to
climate change mitigation. Finally, if the fund is
successful in attaining its objectives, the creation of
a new unit could open up additional financing
opportunities by allowing the fund to generate and
sell non-compliance forest units to countries,
companies, non-governmental organisations and
others interested in financing the protection of
tropical forests could contribute to the fund’s efforts
to safeguard the climate, biodiversity, and local and
indigenous rights.

New auction for forests

Industrialised countries would be required to make a
“tropical deforestation commitment” and purchase of
the new forest units proportional to a small amount
of their overall emission permits (AAUs). This
mandatory minimum purchase would guarantee a
significant and steady stream of funds to protect
tropical forests in developing countries.  For
instance, the purchase of only 2% of these units
could raise approximately €9 billion per year (see
Table 16).  This minimum contribution could be
achieved either through a separate sale of units at a
price linked to the world market price of comparable
units, or in combination with the auctioning of all
forest units.

Individual industrialised countries would then be
allowed to purchase additional forest units up to an
established limit, which could provide them with
some compliance flexibility while addressing the
“free rider” problem associated with the negotiation
of individual targets.7 The total amount of forest units
made available would be limited consistent with the
overall target established by Annex I Parties.  For
the purposes of this auction (or sale), individual
industrialised countries would be assigned an
emission reduction range.  Each unit purchased by a
country would be one unit less than could be
purchased by another country.  Thus, unlike with
forest offset credits, the new forest units would mean
that industrialised countries collectively meet or
exceed their overall emission reduction target.

Greenpeace supports holding general auctions with
individual limits on purchases and a collective limit
tied to the overall cap for industrialised countries.
This would guarantee that reductions from
deforestation are entirely supplemental to
industrialised countries emission reduction
commitments and ensure that all industrialised
countries take significant actions to reduce their
domestic emissions.  Another option would be to
remove the limit on individual country purchases and
hold a general auction across all industrialised
countries.  While this option would likely attain the
highest price for the units, a single country could
potentially monopolise the purchase of units (and take
little domestic action on emissions).  Finally, countries
could establish their limits such that the mean (or
some standard deviation from the mean) of the
collective individual target ranges would be roughly
equivalent to the overall Annex I reduction target.
Under this option, each country would have the
unrestricted option to purchase additional forest units
up to its allotted cap without regard to the quantity
purchased by other countries.  However, we do not
support this option since it could potentially allow
industrialised countries to fail to meet their overall
emission reduction target.

Finally, forest units could be made available to
purchasers in any number of ways.9  The best option
is for the forest fund to hold an international auction
of forest units with the responsibility for purchasing
units falling to each industrialised country.10 Under
certain circumstances, countries might be allowed to
pass purchasing the units onto companies in their
domestic or regional emissions trading scheme.
Alternatively, industrialised countries could dedicate
the revenues from auctioning a set percentage of
their domestic emission allowances to the new forest
fund.  This approach, however, would not have the
advantages of an international auction in terms of
transparency, efficiency, and uniformity.  In terms of
timing, there could be a single auction held for the
entire commitment period or auctions held every
week.  Periodic auctions of the forest units are likely
to provide the best mix in terms of compliance
flexibility and financing and address the numerous
other concerns.11

Financing and flexibility with new forest units

Under the Forests for Climate proposal, industrialised countries would be required to purchase a minimum
amount of forest units, then have the option of purchasing additional units, up to a limit, through an auction.

Comparison of approaches to REDD

Market offset mechanisms for REDD:
Do the numbers add up?

Potential supply of REDD offset credits 5.8-7.2
billion (deforestation only, not including
degradation).12

Potential demand of REDD offset credits from
carbon markets:
USA: 867 million offset credits13
EU: 261 million offset credits14

There is a significant over supply of potential
REDD offset credits relative to the anticipated
demand for such credits in the next (post-2012)
phase of the Kyoto Protocol.  This has led to fears
that the inclusion of REDD offset credits in the
carbon markets could deflate the price of carbon and
destabilise (or even “flood”) the markets.

Environmental integrity

The single overriding principle Parties must consider
in establishing a mechanism to Reduce Emissions
from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) is to
ensure its consistency with goal of keeping global
temperature rise as far below 2oC as possible.
Competing REDD proposals must be carefully
examined with respect to their role in the overall
climate regime and whether as part of this package
they would bring the world closer to (or further away
from) the UNFCCC objective of avoiding dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate.

REDD offers an excellent opportunity to reduce global
greenhouse gas emissions in a cost effective and
equitable manner; yet some industrialised countries
may be seeking to turn this opportunity into an offset.
While the argument is often made, there is little to no
evidence that industrialised countries would be willing
to take on stricter legally binding domestic targets in
the hope that they can meet the tougher target by
purchasing offset credits from developing countries
who both choose to, and are successful in, reducing
their emissions from deforestation and forest
degradation.  Thus, the proposed inclusion of forest
offset credits in the carbon markets under the next
phase of Kyoto is an attempt to provide additional
means for industrialised countries to weaken their
domestic emission reduction commitments.

Below we discuss some concerns with market-offset
mechanisms for REDD and their ability to attain
certain environmental and equity goals in comparison
to a market-linked mechanism, specifically the hybrid
market-linked fund proposed by Greenpeace.  We
conclude by arguing that market-offset mechanisms
for REDD should not become part of the Kyoto (post-
2012) agreement on climate change and that newer
more innovative alternatives should be pursued.

10

Implications for global greenhouse gas emissions from market-linked mechanisms
versus market-offset mechanisms

Emission reductions achieved through auctioning emission allowances or the purchase of forest units under the
Greenpeace Forests for Climate proposal would be additional to industrialised countries’ domestic reduction
commitments. Due to problems of leakage, permanence and additionality, a market-offset mechanism for REDD
could potentially increase global greenhouse gas emissions.

11

Consistency with UNFCCC and the 2oC goal

Leakage, permanence, baseline uncertainties

In order to avoid catastrophic climate change the
world must keep global temperature rise as far
below 2oC as possible.15

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA)
have demonstrated that carbon prices will need to
increase in a consistent and rapid manner to bring
about the infrastructure changes needed to avoid a
2oC rise in global temperatures.16  The IPCC has
shown that carbon prices in 2030 would need to be
in the range of 80 to 200 dollars per tonne of CO 2,
with the International Energy Agency (IEA) arguing
that even higher prices would be needed to deliver
at least a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions by 2050.17

Recent studies have shown that including cheap
forest offset credits in the carbon markets could
crash the price of carbon by almost 50%.18  The
finding is consistent with prior studies which have
found that forest offset credits would have a similar
impact on the price of carbon allowances.19  These
studies also indicate that the inclusion of REDD
credits would significantly reduce incentives to invest
in clean and renewable technologies in both
industrialised and developing countries.20  While
discussions have largely focused on the impacts of
including REDD credits in the carbon markets on
incentives in industrialised countries, scant attention
has been paid to the impact of forest credits on
energy and technology investments in developing
countries, particularly in China and India.  However,
some recent models clearly show that cheap REDD
credits would “crowd out” the more expensive credits
generated from energy and industrial emission
reductions.21  The ability of forest credits to crowd
out fossil credits would have significant implications
for overall architecture of the next international
agreement on climate, specifically the need for
developing countries with significant energy and
industrial emissions to take national mitigation
actions to reduce such emissions.

12

Leakage (emissions displacement) refers to forest
destruction halted in one part of a country being
moved to another part or across an international
border.  Additionality refers to the need to prove
that compensated reductions would not have
occurred in the absence of the rewarded activity.
Permanence refers to the need for emission
reductions to be permanent, not temporary.  This is
especially problematic for forest emissions due to
possible reversal of carbon benefits caused by
human or natural disturbance (fires, disease, pests
or even climate change).  A major issue with
permanence is who would be liable (buyer, seller,
joint, other) in the event that the forest is later
destroyed.

Any approach to REDD will have to deal with the
significant problems of leakage, permanence (and
liability), and baseline-setting.  However, these
issues are especially problematic with market-offset
mechanisms, which would allow energy and
industrial emissions to increase if “equivalent”
reductions in forest emissions are made.  For
example, under a market-offset mechanism, if a
country’s baseline is incorrectly established, it could
end up generating non-additional reductions – i.e.
“fake” emission reduction credits (or “hot air”) - and
allow an industrialised country to increase its
emissions.  The result is that global greenhouse
gas emissions could actually increase under a
market-offset mechanism.

In order to provide real benefits for climate and
biodiversity, a REDD mechanism must meaningfully
address the problems of national and international
displacement (or “leakage”).  Although international
leakage may not be explicitly addressed in other
sectors, the risk of leakage is likely greater in the
area of deforestation than in other sectors. A fund
approach is best equipped for these purposes as it
could be designed to make financing available to
the broadest array of countries with tropical forests,
including those with differing capacities as well as
those with high and low deforestation rates.
Carbon markets must retain their strict entry
standards in order to provide a level playing field for
market participants and to prevent countries from
gaming or cheating the system.  However, most
developing countries with tropical forests are
unlikely to meet these standards in the next
commitment period and attempts to water down
these high standards would severely undermine the
environmental integrity of the system.

Limiting the amounts of forest offset credits allowed

Given the problems associated with allowing an unlimited
number of forest offset credits to enter the carbon
markets, many proponents are now proposing to allow a
limited number of REDD offset credits to enter the carbon
markets.  These proposals remain problematic for a
number of reasons.  First, limits on REDD credits would
do nothing to change the quality of such reductions and
their equivalency and comparability to fossil fuel
emissions.  Such credits still suffer from the problems of
leakage, permanence, baseline-setting, etc. and the
argument for focusing the markets on the more easily
quantified and comparable trade in fossil fuel emissions
would not be changed.  Second, the payments obtained
for REDD credits would likely bear little to no relation to
the cost exerted to reduce forest emissions, resulting in
windfall profits for countries and the inefficient
expenditure of resources for mitigation.22  Third, the risk
of market monopolisation would be increased since offset
purchasers seeking low-cost low-risk opportunities would
likely cluster around the one or two countries with
traditionally high rates of deforestation who could deliver
reductions on a continuous basis.

Potential for fake emission reductions

This in turn would increase the risks of international
emissions displacement (i.e. “leakage”) and provide
little or no benefit to climate or biodiversity.  Fourth,
because of their anticipated low costs, studies have
shown that such credits would likely “crowd out”
investments in clean and renewable energy
technologies in developing countries.  Finally, while
limiting the amount of forest offset credits allowed
might minimise the direct impacts on the price of
carbon, they would not decrease the less quantifiable
indirect effects on investment strategies in the energy
and industrial sectors.  As long as the potential for
more cheap forest offset credits is there, private and
government actors could anticipate their future
availability (and carbon stock offsets, etc.), or worse,
use their resources to continuously lobby for their
increase instead of devoting resources to low-carbon
technologies.  Such “slippery slope” arguments
appear especially relevant for proposals to allow in
only a limited amount of forest offset credits.

The graph on the left shows the difficulty in establishing an accurate baseline for deforestation. Under a
market-offset mechanism, a baseline that is established incorrectly (through genuine error or political
manoeuvring) could lead to the generation of non-additional REDD offset credits and increase global
emissions.

Equity

Deep cuts in industrialised countries’
domestic greenhouse gas emissions

Significant and reliable financing for developing
countries with tropical forests

In Bali, industrialised countries committed to
making deep domestic cuts in greenhouse gas
emissions and to providing financing and other
incentives for significant emission reductions in
developing countries including REDD-related
actions.  However, there appears to be movement
among some industrialised countries to do less at
home in exchange for cheaper reductions in
developing countries.  Not only does this
represent a back-tracking from commitments
made in Bali, but it also takes the focus off of the
need for countries historically responsible for the
climate crisis to reduce emissions at home.

Tens of billions of dollars per year (or more) will likely
be needed to reduce and ultimately halt tropical
deforestation.23  Developing countries who take
action to protect their tropical forests must be
rewarded for their successes.

While much has been made of the potential financing
for forests available through carbon market offset
credits, none of this financing is guaranteed.  Actual
finance would be subject to the decisions of a large
number of independent actors.  Furthermore, recent
analyses indicate that the inclusion of REDD credits
in the carbon markets would not provide financing at
the scale or timeframe needed to end tropical
deforestation.24

The unpredictability of offset financing could diminish
the number of developing countries willing to
participate in a REDD mechanism.  Developing
countries facing difficult development decisions may
find it difficult to significantly change their current land
use practices when there is no guarantee their
actions will be rewarded down the line.  The promise
of future payment based on an estimated demand
that may never materialise will likely not be a
sufficient incentive for developing countries faced
with many short-term needs.

The urgency of the climate and extinction crises
demands that industrialised governments provide
countries with tropical forests an incentive to change
policies immediately.  Parties must commit to
providing funding for REDD in a predictable manner
at the scale needed to halt emissions from
deforestation within a decade.  As shown above,
auctioning even a small percentage of the overall
emission allowances would raise financing in the
range of many billions of Euros per year.

14

Equity among countries: an approach open
to the greatest number of countries with
tropical forests

A solution is needed that will get as many
countries with tropical forests involved as quickly
as possible.  Most drivers of deforestation are
global in nature, caused by demand for wood
products and agricultural commodities.  The
international approach to REDD must halt forest
destruction where it has traditionally occurred and
prevent it from shifting to other places at risk.
Otherwise, benefits to the climate, biodiversity,
and forest peoples will be marginal at best.

Experiences with carbon markets to date raise
concerns about whether a market offset
mechanism for REDD could provide for the
participation of a large number of countries with
tropical forests.  The most relevant example is the
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), where
approximately 90% of all credits have been issued
from four countries (China, India, South Korea,
and Brazil) and about 1% spread among the least
developed countries (LDCs).25  While incentives
should be performance-based, a system that
would only define performance as ex post
financing for verified emission reductions would
be skewed towards a very small number of
countries with high tropical deforestation rates and
biased against countries with low deforestation
rates and limited capacities.  This would have
major implications for certain developing
countries, such as those located in the Congo
Basin.

The global situation calls for the creation of a
flexible mechanism that could address the very
different circumstances and capacities of
countries as diverse as Brazil, Indonesia, and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.  A system
solely dependent upon the creation and trade of
fully fungible forest credits seems ill suited for
addressing deforestation emissions in a
comprehensive manner.

A forest fund could provide financing to developing
countries where provisions for emission reductions,
biodiversity protection, and the protection of local and
indigenous rights have been made.  National
approaches are needed to reduce transaction costs,
address domestic leakage and ensure the integrity of
baselines.  But, in instances where national
governments may not have sufficient capacities,
those governments in combination with the fund’s
board could allow for the direct financing of sub-
national programmes and activities.  Such financing
becomes defensible when the projects are not being
used as offsets and the mechanism has objectives in
addition to emission reductions.

15

Watering down standards for REDD?

Carbon markets are significant tools in the fight
against climate change and must remain stable to
be effective. Strong uniform standards are critical
to ensure quality reductions and the comparability
of actions.  Under existing rules, industrialised
countries who take on binding national targets
under the Kyoto Protocol, and meet its strict
monitoring, reporting and verification
requirements, are allowed to generate and sell
offset credits generated from forestry if such
reductions exceed their overall emissions target.
Therefore, there are no legal or political objections
to preventing developing countries from selling
REDD offset credits on the carbon markets so
long as they take on Annex B commitments and
meet all applicable standards and requirements.
Existing proposals for market-offset mechanisms
for REDD are problematic because they would
lower the standards required of countries to sell
credits on the carbon markets.  Issues of
permanence and liability, additionality, and
leakage raise the stakes for the issue of REDD.
Allowing standards to be weakened would call into
question the environmental integrity of the carbon
markets and the overall climate regime.

Equity within countries: an approach that
promotes climate and biodiversity objectives
while respecting the rights of local and
indigenous peoples

There is little reason to believe that a market offset
mechanism for REDD would encourage reductions
that meet goals unrelated to carbon and compliance,
such as biodiversity and respect for local and
indigenous rights.  For instance, the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) was established
with dual objectives of promoting sustainable
development and assisting Annex I parties with their
compliance efforts.26  However, experience with this
market mechanism shows that investments have
flocked to the least expensive offset credit providers
based on costs, without little to no regard for the goal
of promoting sustainable development.27  Half of all
the offset credits issued through March 2008 came
from trifluoromethane (HFC-23) emission reduction
projects, yielding significant profits for chemical
companies and carbon traders but no benefit for
sustainable development.28

16

UNDRIP and REDD

On 13 September 2007, the United Nations
General Assembly adopted the U.N. Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)
after over twenty years of negotiations between
indigenous peoples and governments.  UNDRIP
has major implications for REDD, the long term
success of which will largely depend upon the
attention paid to rights, social and livelihood
issues.  In order to be successful in the long term,
Greenpeace believes that REDD must fully
respect the land, resource use and ownership
rights of indigenous peoples and directly engage
such communities in the development and
implementation of a REDD mechanism.  REDD
policies must provide for the free, prior, and
informed consent of these communities and
ensure that benefits are equitably shared.  Parties
to the UNFCCC should therefore seek to establish
a REDD mechanism which fully respect the rights
of local and indigenous peoples, consistent with
the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples.

Indigenous peoples and local communities

Serious questions have been raised by
Indigenous Peoples Organisations (IPOs) and
southern civil society organisations about the
impacts of REDD on their rights and livelihoods.29
While every REDD mechanism will have to
address issues of implementation, the overall
architecture of this mechanism will have a
profound impact on how it will work in practice.
These concerns seem especially poignant when
dealing with systems that would seek to generate
offset credits for compliance purposes, i.e. market
offset mechanisms.  In this context, placing
forests directly into the carbon markets could have
the added risk of pitting forest peoples whose land
tenure rights have either not been acknowledged
or not enforced against a model seeking to
provide services at the lowest possible cost.30

A properly designed REDD mechanism could
strengthen and advance the rights of indigenous
and other forest dependent peoples while a poorly
designed policy could potentially place their rights
at risk.  While any system will have to address this
issue, a mechanism with a stronger governance
structure, such as a fund, has a much better
chance to be designed and implemented with
outreach, participation, and transparency and
other criteria that will help ensure that the rights of
local and indigenous peoples are fully respected.
A governance structure that includes developing
and industrialised countries as well as civil society
representatives would also provide for the greater
comparability of efforts and their relative
successes and failures.

17

Instead, parties should focus their resources on a
well-designed mechanism for REDD that will promote
both climate and biodiversity objectives while fully
respecting the rights of local and indigenous peoples.
This could be done by prioritising countries with large
intact forests and other natural forests with high
biodiversity values at risk of deforestation.  Benefits
would be provided to countries showing progress in
attaining both climate and biodiversity objectives, with
the free, prior and informed consent of local and
indigenous peoples. Only countries meeting these
standards would be eligible for REDD incentives.

Parties have supported collaboration between the
UNFCCC and the UNCBD34 and must communicate
a strong position that any future REDD mechanism
be designed and implemented to promote the
objectives of both Conventions consistent with the
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Biodiversity

Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson has argued that we
are in the midst of the world’s sixth greatest
extinction.31  But unlike the other historical mass
extinctions, this one is completely man-made.

The United Nations has acknowledged this crisis
and, in response, has adopted the target to
significantly reduce global biodiversity loss by
2010.32  Recent scientific studies have confirmed
the urgency of this extinction crisis, and one
recent report demonstrated that 20-30% of the
world’s remaining species would be at increased
risk of extinction if global temperature rise
exceeds 2ºC.33  Thus a REDD mechanism that
would weaken efforts to stay well below 2oC could
perversely result in catastrophic climate change
that may be worse for tropical forests than the
status quo.

Forests are more than carbon. Yet, the UNFCCC
does not distinguish between ancient forests that
have stood for hundreds of years and
industrialised tree plantations planted 30 years
ago. Focusing REDD on gross emission
reductions and ascribing value to biodiversity is
essential to avoid creating market incentives to
turn natural old growth forests into production
forests (with a corresponding loss of species and
livelihoods) or to allow their continued destruction
to be offset by industrial tree plantations at the
national level. It would be perverse to support a
system to protect the Earth’s climate that would
not be designed to protect its inhabitants.

A market offset mechanism would render the
protection of biodiversity to mere chance.
Biodiversity and social considerations could be
viewed as an added “cost” by project developers,
carbon traders and companies engaged in a “race
to the bottom” to provide offset credits for
compliance purposes at lowest possible costs.
Given the anticipated revenues for REDD, a
domain which has to date largely been
encompassed by non-governmental
organisations, could very quickly become a for-
profit enterprise.  Drivers of deforestation (such as
logging companies and agricultural commodity
producers) could shift from high-carbon low
biodiversity areas to low-carbon high biodiversity
areas, resulting in net gains in terms of climate but
losses in terms of biodiversity.

18

Efficiency

Efficiency in the context of REDD means the
ability to provide permanent emission reductions
in forest emissions at lowest costs.  However, in
the REDD debate, efficiency is often discussed in
terms of how to lower the short term compliance
costs for large industries in developed countries.
These two interests are not necessarily the same.

Greenpeace believes that the long term success
of REDD will be determined by the extent to which
financing for REDD is directed to protect
biodiversity and the rights of local and indigenous
communities.  A mechanism designed to provide
offsets at lowest costs for compliance purposes in
the short term, may not be implemented in a way
that encourages developing countries to progress
along a long-term sustainable and rights-based
development pathway.

A major efficiency issue is the extent to which the
market price paid for forest offset credits would
bear a relation to the forgone opportunity costs of
not deforesting.  One recent study seemed to
demonstrate that the demand for offset credits
would drive the price more than the supply, which
could result in significant profits for REDD offset
credit providers at the expense of greater
mitigation efforts.35  One study has shown that
prices paid for CDM offset credits in the European
Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) were 10-100
times greater than the costs of the reductions
themselves.36

In contrast, a fund for forests could be designed to
compensate countries only for foregone costs of
not deforesting.  That is the experience of the
Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund (see above)
which only compensates countries and projects
for the incremental (i.e. “additional”) costs to
conversion to non-ozone depleting technologies.
The result would be the more efficient expenditure
of limited mitigation resources and lower overall
compliance costs for industrialised countries.

The efficiency of offsetting with REDD

Advocates of market-offset mechanisms for
REDD often argue it would provide the most
efficient means of reducing forest emissions.
However, the mismatch between the anticipated
supply of REDD credits and the likely demand for
such credits from the carbon markets significantly
undermines such arguments since the price paid
for a REDD offset credit would likely bear little
relation to the actual costs incurred in reducing
deforestation.  For instance, in one well-publicised
expose, chemical companies and carbon traders
providing offset credits to European and Japanese
credit purchasers were expected to garner nearly
$6 billion in payments for reductions whose actual
costs were approximately $100 million.37  The
result is the inefficient expenditure of mitigation
financing and windfall profits for a select few
beneficiaries.  Would a market-offset mechanism
for REDD do the same?

Private vs. public funding

The financing discussion for REDD often focuses
on the identity of the funding source(s), rather
than on the availability and predictability of
financing to reward countries for successful
mitigation actions.  Both public and private
sources of finance could apply under either a
market-offset mechanism or a market-linked
mechanism.  Similarly, both funds and markets
could enable public, private, and non-
governmental entities to finance the
implementation of REDD actions and activities.
However, arguments that significant efficiencies
would be gained by allowing the private sector to
provide direct financing for REDD may be
overstated, since emission reductions from REDD
should be achieved at the national level, and the
world’s remaining tropical forests are largely
contained within a small number of developing
countries.38

19

Conclusion

Given the limited time in adopting a REDD
mechanism prior to Copenhagen, parties should
allow the carbon markets to remain focused on
the more easily quantifiable and comparable
fossil fuel emissions rather than introducing the
complexity and uncertainty associated with forest
emissions.  At this juncture, market-offset
mechanisms for REDD could become an
inequitable, inefficient, and potentially
counterproductive way of addressing the urgency
of the climate crisis.  Perhaps solutions to the
aforementioned problems can ultimately be
found, but this will not occur in the timeframe
needed to adopt and implement a REDD
mechanism for the next (post-2012) phase of the
Kyoto Protocol.

Therefore, the ongoing negotiations on REDD would
best be served by developing an innovative new
mechanism which can ensure the reductions are
genuinely additional to deep domestic reductions in
industrialised countries and finance performance
which achieves both climate and biodiversity
objectives consistent with the rights of local and
indigenous peoples.  Only then can the potential
rewards of REDD, outweigh any potential risks.

Both country and civil society representation should include participants from all major regions with tropical forests.

Financing amounts would depend on the targets established by industrialised countries and the world market price for other
emission allowances. Estimates provided are at 1990 emissions levels at a forest unit value of  €20.

The free rider problem described the likelihood that each individual country will negotiate in a manner that would result in an
individual target that is less than its fair share of the total burden agreed to by Annex I parties.  The price of forest units could initially
be offered at a rate slightly lower than the world market price for similar emission allowance.

Modified table from Tropical Deforestation Emission Reduction Mechanism:  A Discussion Paper (December 2007). We use forest
units here interchangeably with the TDREU forest units described in the Discussion Paper.

every 5 years)

Countries could choose to finance their purchase in any number of ways such as through auctioning at the domestic (or regional
level); the imposition of domestic levies or taxes, etc.

The auction(s) could be designed to promote a number of values including: historic responsibilities; flexibility for industrialised
countries and emission sources the free rider problem; the creation of secondary markets; etc.

While it is difficult to generalise about the myriad of proposals on REDD, this graph provides a brief comparison of three major
competing proposals based on important criteria. While it is possible that sufficient amounts of Official Development Assistance
(ODA) could be provided for purposes of REDD, the amount of ODA historically directed towards forest programmes makes this
unlikely. The Greenpeace Forests for Climate (TDERM) proposal is applied in the table above where there may be variation among
market-linked mechanism proposals.
