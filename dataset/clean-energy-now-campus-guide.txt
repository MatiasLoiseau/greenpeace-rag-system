Global Warming : The Most Serious Environmental Threat Facing our Planet
The Problem
The scientific consensus is in: global warming is real and it is the most serious
environmental threat facing our planet. It is no longer possible to talk of some future time
when the heating of the planet will begin to have adverse effects: that time is now and
global warming is already happening.  The United Nation’s report by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading scientific body evaluating
global warming, predicts a temperature increase of up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the
next 100 years, an increase in the frequency of storms, floods and droughts, and an
increase in heat related illnesses and infectious diseasees  as the sea level rises.
The Culprit
Global warming is caused by an accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in our
atmosphere.  The most abundant greenhouse gas is human-made carbon dioxide (CO2).
CO2 emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels like oil, coal and natural gas.  Fossil
fuel companies, in addition to causing global warming, are behind much of the opposition
to implementing global warming solutions.
The U.S. Position
So what is the U.S. government doing to stop this problem? Virtually nothing! Upon
taking office, President Bush withdrew the United States from the international treaty to
combat global warming. In the summer of 2002, President Bush refused to attend the
World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa. In doing so, Bush is
working to block our nation from joining the global community to stop global warming.
Furthermore, the United States is the largest emitter of global warming pollution,
responsible for 25 percent of the problem.  While the White House refuses to move away
from our dependence on polluting fossil fuels, citizens across the country are taking
matters into their own hands. Students, schools, cities and businesses are choosing
positive solutions – like solar, wind and hydrogen power – to meet their energy needs.
Take Action: Contact President Bush and call on him to promote Clean Energy Now!
Email him at president@whitehouse.gov  or fax (202) 456-2461.
The Solutions
In order to stop global warming, we are going to need to reduce CO2 emissions by
changing the way we use and produce energy on this planet.  Instead of burning fossil
fuels, we need to move toward clean, renewable sources of energy like hydrogen, wind
and solar.  These solutions are readily available in the United States, are better for the
environment and will increase our energy independence.  For more information on clean
energy, please check out: www.cleanenergynow.org

Students Are Taking Action Now: Let’s Change the World, One Campus at a Time!
What will the class of 2003 –2007 be remembered for in 10, 20, or 30 years? A Clean
Energy Revolution – if students take action now! From the civil rights movement in the
60’s to the anti-war movement in 2000, students are legendary for their central role in
spearheading political and social change.
Universities and colleges are virtually small cities within themselves.  They provide
housing, food, and many other amenities for their students.  As institutions, they also
consume vast amounts of energy.  Colleges, as academic institutions, are also considered
national trendsetters, and a shift within the college community toward clean energy has
the potential to reverberate throughout our country’s other institutions creating an impact
far beyond the campus.  There is also a wide pool of resources on college campuses
which can make the switch away from fossil fuels more accessible: professors with
knowledge in these fields, access to decision-making bodies like student governments
and a concentration of students who care about these issues.
Students across the United States have run successful campus clean energy campaigns.
They have worked to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy,
ultimately reducing their campus’ global warming footprint. The success stories below
will inspire and show you how easy it is to make a difference.
Due to student pressure, in July 2003, the University of California (UC) Board of Regents
passed a system-wide Clean Energy and Green Building policy.  The policy that was
unanimously approved by the Board of Regents mandates that:
• Each of the 10 campuses install approximately one megawatt of on-site renewable
energy (equivalent to the power used by 5,000 homes).  Currently only 40 megawatts
of solar energy is grid-connected in California and 52 megawatts across the nation.
• The immediate purchase of 10 percent of the university’s utility purchased energy
from clean energy sources, ramping up to 20 percent by 2017 (enough to power
26,000 homes).
• All new campus buildings be built in compliance with green building standards.
• Reduction of system-wide energy use to 10% below 2000 levels by 2014 in order to
reduce consumption of non-renewable energy sources.
Here are some other brief examples of successful student clean energy campaigns:
• Connecticut College has committed to purchasing 100 percent renewable energy for
electricity needs.
• University of Colorado at Boulder will be run by 27 percent wind energy.
• California State University will reduce energy consumption by 15 percent by 2004.

• Stanford University will “meet or beat” the Kyoto protocol target of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions of by 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2007.
• Oberlin College plans to make its campus “climate neutral”- that is to produce no net
greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
• Brown University will invest $30 million in green building and energy efficiency
design.
• Emory University will use a stringent green building design standard, LEED, for all
new and renovated buildings.
These are just some of the major campus successes that have jump started a national
clean energy campus movement.  Currently there are approximately 3000 two- and four-
year colleges and universities in the United States.  Just imagine , if each of these
institutions implemented a policy similar to the University of California’s, the nation
could have:
• 2,300 MW of new grid-based renewable energy – that’s enough to power 2.3 million
homes!
• 3,000 MW of new solar photovoltaic installations, 1.5 times more solar than is
currently installed globally, which according to industry reports could reduce the
price of solar by 23%, making it cost effective in many applications.
• At least 3,000 new green buildings (assuming one green building per campus), 3
times more then are currently certified or awaiting certification around the world.  
As students, you have the power to make a huge difference and help curb the impacts of
global warming by moving your university to utilize energy from clean, renewable
resources.  In many cases, doing so will not only help to protect the environment, but also
save money over time that can be better spent improving the quality of education. It’s
easy! Join the hundreds of other campuses already involved in the movement! Read more
about how you can catalyze the Clean Energy Revolution on your campus!

1. How to Make Your Campus a Leader in Clean Energy
Goals and Overview
Students can lead the way to a clean energy future and help stop global warming. Every
student’s goal should be for his or her college or university to commit to 100 percent
clean energy.
There are many ways to achieve this goal. In this “How To” guide, two successful
strategies are outlined. The first strategy is a campaign pressuring college or university
decision-makers to commit to a clean energy policy.  Students at the Los Angeles
Community Colleges and the University of California followed this strategy leading to
win their historic clean energy victories. The second strategy is a campaign to get the
student body to vote in favor of a student referendum financing the purchase of clean
energy from local energy companies and/or solar panels for campus buildings.  Student
activists with the University of Colorado Environmental Center successfully
implemented this strategy and persuaded the student body to vote to increase their student
fees by $1 each semester for four years so the university could purchase wind power to
meet a portion of its energy needs. Both of these strategies can be applied on any campus
in the United States.
All is takes is a small, committed group of students to really change the world!
2. Campus Clean Energy Policy Campaign
There are many reasons why you may decide to run a Clean Energy Policy campaign –
maybe your campus doesn’t have the referenda option or perhaps you attend a small
school making it difficult to gather enough money from the students to purchase clean
energy. For whatever reason, you can work through the student government and
eventually the main decision making body, i.e.: the Board of Trustees or Board of
Regents, to get your campus to commit to a campus-wide policy, setting a standard for
clean energy.   Here’s how!
1.   Do some renewable research.
• Set up a meeting with your campus facilities manager to determine ways that your
campus may already be addressing global warming.
• What are the different sources from which your campus receives energy?
• How much energy does your campus consume each year?
• How much does your campus spend on electricity each month/year?

2.   Write a campaign plan.
• Form a core group of student activists that are committed to working on the campaign
for the school year
• Set a goal (i.e.: get your administration to pass a comprehensive clean energy policy
by the end of the school year).
• For example, students at the Los Angeles Community College District set a standard
that all new and significantly renovated buildings use 50 percent clean energy, 25
percent of which would be generated on site with solar panels. In addition, they called
on all new buildings to meet strict green building guidelines developed by the U.S.
Green Building Council called LEED.
• Remember to set your goals high.
• Make a timeline and stick to it (see sample campaign plan).
3.   Write a student resolution (see sample resolution).
• The resolution should clearly state a standard that you would like the school to adopt.
• Your resolution should also include:
• A provision that either the student government or your group creates a larger
proposal with specific recommendations aimed at reducing your school’s
greenhouse gas emissions by a certain amount by a certain date.
• Environmental/Scientific Information --What impact is your school’s energy
consumption making now? What environmental impact will it make under
your plan?
• Economic Information-- What does your energy/electricity cost now? How
much more/less will it cost under your plan? What will be long-term energy
savings (with solar panels)?
4. Pass the resolution through student government.
• This will show that the student body supports your campaign for clean energy. It is
also a great time to build networks and get media.
• Leading up to this resolution, you want to network with as many organizations and
individuals as possible, and have them sign on as co-signers of the resolution.
5. Get the approved student resolution on the school’s decision-making body’s (i.e.:
Board of Trustees or Board of Regents) agenda.
• With the endorsement of your student government, you may simply be able to get
your item on their agenda.  In other cases, someone on your campuses decision-
making body may have to submit the item.  If the later is the case, you may try to get
the student representative on that body to propose your item.
• Once the student resolution is on the agenda, force the school’s leadership to vote on
the standards.

• Often, the decision-makers set up a formal process to evaluate the feasibility and plan
of implementation of the standard. After the process is complete, the decision-makers
will vote to approve a clean energy standard.
6. Win the Campaign!
• Recruit more students to join the campaign.
• Network with other student organizations.
• Get faculty and staff to endorse the campaign.
• Visibility: Organize events on campus, like concerts, to draw attention to the
campaign.
• Media: Get the school and local newspapers, radio and TV to cover the campaign.
Hold press conference before and after the vote with local environmentalists and
friends of the campaign or put out a press release.
• Educate: Table everyday on campus to bring awareness about the issue.
• Have fun! Hold a victory party after you win!
7. Follow-up
• Maintain your campus Clean Energy Now! coalition to do necessary follow-up work
to ensure that your administration will implement the policy that they approved.
• Remember your overall goal of moving your campus to go 100 percent clean energy
down the road.
• Spread the word about your campus’ success to other students around the country.
Campus Clean Energy Policy Case Study: The University of California (UC)
In July 2003, the UC Board of Regents passed a comprehensive Clean Energy and Green
Building Policy for the entire UC system by following this campaign model.  This
historic decision was made after a full year of student campaigning on each campus.  UC
campuses will now have green buildings that use fewer resources, while creating a
healthier learning environment for students, faculty and staff.  The academic institution
will also be purchasing clean energy from power companies to comply with the
California Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) while generating electricity from
renewable resources like solar photovoltaics at each campus.
The adoption of the University of California Clean Energy and Green Building Policy is a
success for the many stakeholders that provided the critical energy needed to meet the
challenges and obstacles of developing this comprehensive policy.  Yet, the student effort
is what ignited the process, sustained it, and ultimately will be responsible for making
this historic achievement spread from campus to campus across the country.
Within the first three months of the student UC Go Solar! Campaign, 14 student
government resolutions were passed by both the undergraduate and graduate student

councils on all nine of the UC campuses.  As momentum grew, students organized the
first-ever UC student environmental coalition named the California Student Sustainability
Coalition (CSSC).  The coalition garnered the support of 72 other campus organizations
and generated a record 10,000 student signatures and 170 faculty endorsements.
California State political leaders including Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante and Secretary
of State and Consumer Affairs, Aileen Adams, also supported the student goals for a
sustainable UC along with six other prominent Californian government officials.  By the
end of the campaign over 1,000 students had volunteered for the campaign by posting
flyers, organizing solar-powered Earth Day concerts, planning campus teach-ins and
public forums, and writing editorials in campus newspapers.  This level of student
involvement is possible on any campus!
The University of California policy is a comprehensive initiative that mandates:
• Ten Megawatts (equivalent to power used by 5,000 homes) of on-site renewable
energy be installed across the 10 campuses (currently only 40 MW of solar energy is
grid-connected in California and 52 MW across the United States).
• The immediate purchase of 10 percent of the university’s utility purchased energy
from clean energy sources, ramping up to 20 percent by 2017 – enough to power
26,000 homes.
• All new campus buildings across the state be built to green building standards (except
acute care facilities).
• Reduction of system-wide energy use to 10 percent below 2000 levels by 2014 in
order to reduce consumption of non-renewable energy sources.
Here are some of the important lessons learned during the UC campaign:
• Engage students (especially graduate students if available) who have technical
expertise in renewable energy.  They can serve as great liaisons between your student
movement and the campus administration.
• Work closely with all levels of the administration! In order to successfully get your
administration to adopt a policy and to ensure that it is properly implemented, it is
critical to communicate with as many administrators, staff and faculty as you can!
Pay particular attention to individuals in the Business and Finance, Planning and
Building and Facilities Management departments.
• Be willing to learn from the administrators, staff and faculty that you engage with.
• Don’t give up! Be persistent!  This alone with ultimately bring you success in
whatever you do J

3. Clean Energy Student Referendum Campaign
You may decide that on your campus it would be better to run a campaign that urges the
student body to vote to increase student fees in order to finance a clean energy project.
Follow the steps below to run a successful Student Referendum campaign.
1.   Do some renewable research.
• Set up a meeting with your campus facilities manager to determine how your school
can purchase clean energy directly from the campus’ energy provider. Typically,
energy providers have a “green power” program in which customers can purchase
clean energy for a very small increase in cost (between one to three percent).
• Set up a meeting with a local solar company. Work with the company to identify
buildings or soon to be constructed buildings that are suited for solar and get
estimated cost for installation and maintenance.
2.   Write a campaign plan.
• Form a core group ofstudent  activists that are committed to working on the campaign
for the school year.
• Set a goal (i.e.: get students to purchase clean energy from energy company or to get
students to purchase solar panels for campus buildings).
• Make a timeline and stick to it.
3.   Write a Referendum.
• Get the Referendum on your campus election ballot in the spring, which will fund the
purchase of clean energy through a small increase in student fees.
• Determine the regulations of your school’s election code.  Most schools require you
to write the referendum for the spring ballot and collect enough signatures in support
of the referendum to represent 10 percent of the student body.  Contact Greenpeace
when you decide this, and we can connect you to folks from Boulder and Connecticut
College who have successfully done this.
4.   Win the Campaign!
• Recruit students to join the campaign.
• Network with other student organizations.
• Get faculty and staff to endorse the campaign.
• Visibility: Organize events on campus, like concerts, to draw attention to the
campaign.
• Media: Get the school and local newspapers, radio and TV to cover the campaign.
Hold press conference before and after the vote with local environmentalists and
friends of the campaign or put out a press release.
• Educate: Table everyday on campus to bring awareness about the issue.
• Hold a “Get Out the Vote” rally the day before the elections.

maureen.cane@sfo.greenpeace.org
11
• Have fun! Hold a victory party after you win!
5. Follow-up
• Maintain your campus Clean Energy Now! coalition to do necessary follow-up with
your administration to ensure that proper steps are taken to purchase or install clean
energy.
• Remember your overall goal of moving your campus to go 100 percent clean energy
down the road.
• Spread the word about your campus’ success to other students around the country.
4. Sample Fall Semester Timeline for your Campaign
Here is a sample timeline to help you plan out your campaign to get your campus to
become a clean energy campus.  The exact timing will vary depending upon how
receptive your administration and student body are, so treat this as a basis, not a bible.
In creating your plan for the semester, start by figuring out what you can reasonably
accomplish in the semester and set a goal.  For example, your goal may be to get the
university to adopt the resolution by the end of this semester, or it may be to get other
campus organizations, the student government and the faculty senate to endorse your
resolution and to pass it next semester.  This timeline is built around getting a student
resolution adopted in one semester.   Set yourself an ambitious goal, but make sure it is
realistic and accomplishable.  Adjust the timeline accordingly, but make sure to have
one!
September
• Research: Figure out whom you need to talk to get a resolution/referendum adopted
and implemented (who has the decision-making authority?).
• Meet with the university administration and ask them to adopt an initial resolution to
purchase clean energy (and bear the costs).  If they agree, then congratulations,
you’ve won!  Negotiate a plan and timeline to implement the purchasing of clean
energy, and make sure you hold them accountable.  Plan a press conference to
announce your victory!
• If they haven’t agreed to immediately adopt the resolution, begin your campaign to
pass a referendum through the student body.  Hold a kick-off press conference to
launch your campaign, then begin building coalitions with other groups on campus.
October
• Begin building coalitions.
• Get professors to sign-on to the campaign.
• Find out what is necessary to get your referendum on the ballot.
• Petition!  Get students to sign a petition in support of your referendum.

For questions, contact
Maureen Cane at
1-415-255-9221 ext 318
maureen.cane@sfo.greenpeace.org
12
• Begin research on economics and environmental benefits of your referendum.
November
• Finalize your referendum, with information on costs per student, overall economic
savings/costs, environmental benefits etc.
• Continue building coalitions.
• Get the faculty senate to endorse your referendum.
• Get the facilities manager and department to endorse your referendum.
• Meet with the administration and ask them to adopt the referendum (take on costs).
• If they still say no, begin education campaign (tabling, op- eds, stickering etc.) on the
negative effects of global warming and benefits of clean energy to prepare for vote.
December
• Referendum passes (if your school only votes once a year, adjust times accordingly)
• Celebrate and hold press conference.
5. Sample Clean Energy Resolution
A Resolution in Support of Green Building and Clean, Renewable Energy
Authored by: The University of California Sustainability Coalition
WHEREAS:  The Talloires  Declaration of 1990, an official statement made by university
administrators of a commitment to environmental sustainability in higher education,
articulates the urgency of our environmental problems: local, regional, and global air and
water pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion
of forests, soil and water; depletion of the ozone layer and emission of "greenhouse"
gases that threaten the survival of humans and millions of other living species, the
integrity of the earth and its biodiversity , the security of nations, and the health and rights
of future generations (Source: www.ulsf.org/programs_talloires.html) ; and
WHEREAS:  The California legislature has found and declared that global warming is a
matter of increasing concern for public health and the environment and that the control
and reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases are critical to slow the effects of global
warming (Source: www.leginfo.ca.gov/
pub/bill/asm/ab_14511500/ab_1493_bill_20020722_chaptered.html); and
WHEREAS:  Governor Davis has recently taken steps towards sustainability by issuing
Executive Order D-16-00 promoting the integration of sustainable and cost-effective
building design and construction within the State as well his endorsement of SB 532
mandating an increase in the percentage of renewable energy in the state's energy
portfolio ( Source: www.energy.ca.gov/ releases /

13
WHEREAS:  The U.S. Green Building Council developed the Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System as a voluntary, consensus-
based, market-driven building rating system based on existing proven technology that
evaluates environmental performance from a "whole building" perspective over a
building's life cycle, providing a definitive standard for what constitutes a “green
building” with the convergence of the primary objectives: implement high energy/water
efficiency, conserve natural resources  and  create a healthy indoor environment, all
resulting in substantially lower operating, maintenance and healthcare expenses and
higher occupant productivity (Sources: www.usgbc.org, www.buildinggreen.com,
www.greenbuild.com) ; and
WHEREAS:  LEED Silver rated buildings cost no more than non-LEED buildings when
the appropriate design concepts, technologies and materials are incorporated at the
beginning of the design process (Source: www.rmi.org/images/other/GDS-
WhyBuildGreen.pdf); and
WHEREAS:  There is great opportunity to enact a UC policy of responsible, cost-
effective, development and consumption of resources as demonstrated by the design,
construction, and use of the LEED Platinum rating Donald Bren Hall at UC Santa
Barbara (Source: www.esm.ucsb.edu/ about/donald_bren_hall.html); and
WHEREAS:  The Los Angeles Community College District recently adopted responsible
development policies requiring that all 40-50 new Proposition A buildings be LEED
Silver rated buildings or higher with at least 15-25 percent renewable energy standard
and with at least 10 percent being generated on site with energy from the sun (Source:
www.cleanenergynow.org/media/pressreleases/ 07122002.html); and
WHEREAS:  An UC energy portfolio with a higher percentage of clean, renewable
energy generated within the state and on campuses will increase safety and security by
reducing dependence on energy firms and other states and nations for energy, lessen
pollution and our contribution to global warming, create many skilled jobs, and keep
more energy sector profits and taxes in California for our local and state governments
(www.calpirg.org/reports/renewableswork.pdf); and
WHEREAS:  UC is the leading public educational institution for research and
development in the state, nation, with a tremendous influence over environmental,
economic and social policies; and
WHEREAS:  It is the duty of Regents to work with students, staff, faculty and
administration within the UC system to address the pressing issues facing our state by
shaping our environmental, economic, and social policies into a responsible strategy that
ensures the well being of current and future generations; therefore be it

RESOLVED:  The Regents of the University of California adopt a policy that all new
and renovated buildings at UC campuses be designed and built to a LEED Silver rating or
higher; and be it further
RESOLVED:  The Regents of the University of California provide that all such new and
renovated LEED Silver rated buildings consume 50 percent or more of their energy
generated from clean, renewable sources and that at least 25 percent of that energy be
generated on site by solar, wind, fuel cell and/or other clean, renewable sources.
6. Writing a News Advisory and News Release (Samples Included)
Writing a news advisory and news release is relatively simple.  We’ve included samples
of both to help you in writing one.
The news advisory should be a half page and include the who, what, when and where, as
well as a few choice tidbits to get reporters interested, without giving away the story.
Make sure to include the contact person’s name and phone number in case the reporter
has any questions.
The news release is a little more complicated.  It is essentially the article you would write
if you were the reporter, and as such it should be formatted like a newspaper article.  The
format is:
• The first paragraph should sum up the article and grab the reader’s attention.
• The next paragraphs should go into more detail and offer any pertinent background
information, such as who are the major players and what has happened to lead up to
this event.
• Add in quotes from people involved in the campaign, such as the spokesperson and
any key endorsers (such as a professor).
• Talk about why this event, campaign, etc. is important and relevant.
••  The final paragraph should summarize the article again.

STUDENTS CALL FOR SCHOOL TO PURCHASE SOLAR POWER
Global warming necessitates move to clean energy
ANYTOWN  – Students at ANYSTATE University launched a campaign today to work
to have their campus purchase 100 percent clean energy and stop global warming.  The
students are calling for their school to commit to initially purchasing 20 percent of their
school’s energy from a local solar power provider.
“Clean energy, like wind and solar, are solutions to stopping global warming,” stated
JANE ACTIVIST, spokesperson for the ECOCLUB.  “Our government is doing little to
stop global warming, so students are leading the way to a clean energy future.  Students
and the American public are way ahead of their elected representatives on this one, and
we’re going to prove them wrong by doing it ourselves.”
The Clean Energy Now! Campaign is a national student movement to push campuses to
lead the way to changing the energy path we are taking in the United States.  Clean
renewable energy like wind and solar are solutions to stopping global warming and
increasing energy independence.  These technologies are readily available in the United
States.
Over the next few months, the students will be educating the campus community and
building student support for purchasing clean energy from a local provider.  The goal is
to develop a plan to pass a student bond resolution to fund the campus to move to 20
percent clean energy and over time move toward 100 percent clean energy.
“Global warming is the most serious environmental threat facing our planet,” Said JOE
SCIENTIST, a professor at ANYSTATE University.  “Increased global temperatures,
more severe weather patterns such as floods and droughts, and rising sea levels pose
significant risks to our planet.  The actions that ANYSTATE are taking to purchase clean
energy will show governments around the world that it is time to take serious action on
this issue.”

7. Sample Clean Energy Now! Petition
We, the undersigned students, understand that global warming poses a serious threat to
environmental and public health.  We therefore believe that our campus should work to
limit its contributions to global warming pollution by purchasing a percentage of its
power from clean, renewable sources of power like solar and wind.

8. Basic Information on Purchasing Clean Energy in a Deregulated State
As a result of deregulation, some companies are offering the option to institutions like
schools to purchase renewable energy directly.  You can search for providers at the links
below, but further research will probably be necessary, as these engines are not all-
inclusive, or verified.  Even in states that are not deregulated you may still be able to
purchase green power directly.  Contact your state Public Utility Commission.

9. Basic Information on Purchasing Solar Panels
Photovoltaic solar panels are one of the most versatile and cleanest forms of energy
production available.
They:
• Are easily incorporated into building designs or added onto existing buildings.
• Eliminate the need for power lines.
• Eliminate inefficiencies and losses during transmission.
• Supply consistent power during peak hours.
• Provide clean power, preventing tons of CO2 emissions over their lifetimes.
• Often yield net economic gains over their lifetimes.
