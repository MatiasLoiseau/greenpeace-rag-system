INTRODUCTORY LETTER

As a military officer who spent decades assessing true threats to national security, I can

say this with clarity: deep sea mining is not a strategic necessity—it’s a manufactured

crisis built on corporate greed and deception. What we are witnessing is not a fact-based

response to a military need, but an attempt by private actors to drape a speculative

commercial venture in the flag of national defense.

First, it was framed as essential for the energy transition. Now, facing market rejection,

deep sea mining proponents are rebranding their pitch—claiming seabed metals are vital

for military readiness. But the Department of Defense isn’t asking for these minerals.
Viable alternatives exist through allied supply chains, recycling, and stockpiles. The deeper

truth is this: “national security” is being invoked not to protect the country, but to secure

investor returns.

We must be clear-eyed about what is truly at risk. Deep sea mining threatens the largest

living space on the planet—one that regulates climate, supports biodiversity, and sustains

the oceanic systems on which all life depends. Destroying it in the name of hypothetical

threats would be not only irresponsible—it would be strategic malpractice.

The bedrock of national security is not simply weapons or minerals—it is global stability,

rule of law, and ecological resilience. Mining the deep ocean in defiance of international

consensus would degrade all three. It would erode U.S. credibility, fracture alliances, and

set a dangerous precedent for unilateral resource exploitation.

A moratorium is not a political stance. It is a strategic imperative. Before a single

commercial operation begins, the world must reckon with the true costs of deep sea

mining—ecological, legal, and geopolitical. The only responsible path forward is restraint.

Let us not be deceived by opportunistic and materialistic appeals that are shrouded in
false patriotism. The business of national security demands rigor and truth, not rhetoric

and greed.

Sincerely,

Major General (Ret.) Randy Manner

On 27 March 2025, The Metals Company (TMC) set off a

Trump administration issued an Executive Order sig-

naling its readiness to unilaterally authorize deep sea

mining in both U.S. and international waters, the latter

in contradiction to the United Nations Convention on

the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an international treaty to

which—unlike the vast majority of nations—the U.S. is

not party. Days after the Executive Order, TMC applied

to the U.S. for both licenses for exploration and permits

for commercial mining.

Crucially, this latest act of U.S. exceptionalism could

have far-reaching implications—not only for mining

governance, but for fisheries, naval operations, shipping

lanes, marine scientific research, environmental pro-

tection, and maritime boundaries. UNCLOS establishes

a package of rights that all states enjoy, whether they

have ratified the treaty (like most of the world) or not

pillaging the seafloor we risk climate disaster, geopolit-

ical vulnerability, and potential mineral shortages that

could jeopardize national security. Nothing could be

further from the truth.

In addition, there is a very real risk that deep sea mined

minerals could infiltrate global supply chains and be

used for military purposes, undermining the fundamental

principles enshrined in UNCLOS that the international

seabed is the common heritage of humankind and must

only ever be used for peaceful purposes and for the

benefit of all humankind. Once the deep sea mining genie

is out of the bottle it will be very difficult to prevent

minerals taken from the international seabed entering

the military-industrial complex.

The claim that a Mining Code will solve these problems

is an illusion—even more so in light of the threatened

U.S. unilateral action. Such a code has been on the

negotiation table at the ISA for years, but no set

of rules can adequately govern an industry whose

very premise is rooted in environmental destruction,

downplaying scientific warnings, exploiting geopolitical

volatility, and opportunistic lobbying by a handful of

corporations. With or without a code, pursuing deep sea

mining will increase security risks—environmentally

and geopolitically.

What is needed now is not regulation, but restraint: a

global moratorium to protect the global commons and

stop deep sea mining before it starts.

evidence linking the deep sea mining industry with
military contractors, pro-defense representatives,
and venture capitalists. From Norway to the United
States, corporations hoping to launch a new deep
sea mining industry are opportunistically trying
to link underwater mineral resources to national
security in order to attract new investment and
political support.

  2  As Sandor Mulsow, former Former Head, Office
of Environmental Management and Mineral
Resources at International Seabed Authority
points out, this risks an “exploration war in order
to secure such resources in the future.” This view is
shared by Randy Manner, retired Major General in
the U.S. Army, who sees “money and business” as
the only real motivation for deep sea mining.

  3  “National security” is overtaking “energy

transition” as the narrative du jour for deep sea
tycoons. In their search for political support and
funding, deep sea mining hopefuls are getting
closer to influential military circles, particularly in
the United States.

  4  The Metals Company (TMC), the Vancouver-based
deep sea mining start up, has largely pivoted from
their energy transition narrative to hyping up the
risks of the U.S. depending on Chinese-dominated
supplies of critical metals and playing up national
security concerns. Having lobbied for years to
accelerate the adoption of a Mining Code by the
ISA, TMC’s CEO Gerard Barron has now garnered
the support of Republican defense hawks and
military veterans in the U.S., and recently boasted
about visiting the White House.

viii

DEEP DECEPTION  5  Traditional defense contractors are retreating from
deep sea activities, but keeping their options open.
Lockheed Martin has kept U.S.-issued exploration
licenses in the Pacific’s Clarion-Clipperton Zone
(CCZ) for more than forty years, outside of any
international legal framework, but never taken
active steps to start exploitation. In the meantime,
Norwegian state-owned defense operator
Kongsberg had taken stakes in Loke Marine
Minerals (which held UK-sponsored exploration
licenses in the CCZ) and was also an investor in
TMC, before it recently declared bankruptcy in yet
another deep sea mining cautionary tale.

  6  Our investigation finds that deep sea mining is a
supply-driven venture, not a response to genuine
market demand. Despite decades of promotion, the
industry has failed to prove its relevance to any
critical supply chain—civilian or military. Claims
that polymetallic nodules are essential to defense
applications appear to be a marketing narrative,
not a procurement reality. Defense contractors
are unlikely to rely on an unproven, high-cost
extraction model when more stable, terrestrial
sources or recycling pathways exist. In the absence
of compelling technical or material need, the
industry’s prospects hinge almost entirely on
political endorsement—not market viability.

  7  The continuous change in narrative unfolded

by the deep sea mining industry—the latest of
which is to appeal to national security concerns—
demonstrates that the industry is driven by greed,
not need. Their quest for investments and political
support in the defense sector could usher in the
militarization of the deep sea. Once deep sea
mined minerals enter global supply chains it
will be impossible to stop them being used for
military purposes, contradicting UNCLOS Article
141, which states that the resources of the
international seabed shall be used “exclusively
for peaceful purposes”.

  8  Additionally, deep sea mining risks becoming a

flashpoint in the broader buildup of geopolitical
conflict over the ocean, particularly in the Pacific.
This threatens to transform the international
seabed from a zone of peace and cooperation into
a contested theater of resource extraction and
geopolitical brinkmanship.

  9  Despite the realities outlined above, the deep sea
mining industry appears to have found shared
interest with U.S. President Donald Trump. A new
Executive Order, “Unleashing America’s Offshore
Critical Minerals and Resources,” signed on 24
April 2025, launches a process for U.S. agencies to
begin licensing deep sea mining in both domestic
and international waters. In bypassing UNCLOS,
this act of U.S. exceptionalism undermines
the multilateral governance of the high seas,
could exacerbate geopolitical risks, and would
have serious implications for both the U.S. and
international order on issues like illegal fishing,
military navigation, and extended continental
shelf rights. In addition, any company seeking to
exploit the international seabed through licenses
issued by the U.S. outside of UNCLOS risks serious
litigation challenges on multiple fronts.

 10  To maintain peace, harmony and stability in

the governance of our shared global commons,
and ensure that decisions on the future of the
international seabed are made collectively by all
nations and not dictated by private profit-driven
companies, the only viable political solution
is for all countries to agree to adopt a global
moratorium on deep sea mining both nationally
and internationally.

A DESPERATE iNDUSTRY SEEKiNG TO JUSTiFY iTS EXiSTENCE

The deep sea mining industry, once touted as a game-changing solution for the clean energy transition, is now
grappling with mounting setbacks, fractured legitimacy, and fading momentum. Over a century after polymetallic
nodules were first discovered during the HMS Challenger expedition in 1873, the arc of deep sea mining—from Cold
War-era intrigue to speculative commercial ventures—has reached a critical inflection point.

Companies like The Metals Company (TMC), which once marketed itself as a climate champion, have increasingly
adopted a national security rhetoric—reframing seabed minerals as critical to securing supply chains for defense
technologies and strategic autonomy. In its most brazen move to date, TMC announced plans to bypass the
International Seabed Authority (ISA) entirely by seeking a U.S. exploitation license under the long-dormant Deep
Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA), directly courting favor with the Trump administration and undermining
multilateral governance.

This pivot comes amid rapidly advancing battery recycling technologies, weakening market interest, growing
environmental opposition, and widespread calls for caution. With over 30 ISA member states supporting a moratorium
or precautionary pause, leading insurers refusing to underwrite deep sea mining activities, and TMC recently
surrendering a third of its Clarion-Clipperton Zone claim area, the sector’s viability is under deep scrutiny. Confidence
has further eroded with the March 2025 bankruptcy of Norway’s Loke Marine Minerals—until recently seen as deep sea
miming’s most viable private player.

As TMC pivots from the ISA to pursue licensing through the U.S. government, the industry is increasingly seen not as
a frontier of sustainability or security—but as one grasping for relevance. Having failed to justify its existence through
environmental benefit or commercial promise, deep sea mining now leans heavily on geopolitical fear to open a door
the world is not ready—or willing—to walk through.

danger is that deep sea mining becomes a flashpoint

in the broader build up of geopolitical conflict over the

ocean—transforming the international seabed from a

zone of peace and cooperation into a contested theater

of resource extraction and geopolitical brinkmanship.

This report aims to show that deep sea mining is being

rushed forward, not because of any genuine global
need for the minerals that could potentially be sourced,

nor any strategic question of national security, but

because of corporate greed and political opportunism.

The best way to combat this deep deception is for all

countries to agree to a global moratorium on the prac-

tice of deep sea mining.

Rather than advancing the race for seabed minerals,

TMC and the Trump administration’s aggressive pivot

risks provoking a global backlash—galvanizing calls

for a moratorium not only on environmental grounds,

but as a geopolitical safeguard. In the face of rising

great-power tensions, the international community

must recognize deep sea mining for what it is: not a

pathway to shared prosperity, but a catalyst for con-

flict—one that must be halted before it crosses a dan-

gerous threshold.

What is deep sea mining?

the nodules themselves are rich in manganese, cobalt,

nickel, and copper, as well as traces of molybdenum
and metallic rare earth elements.10

FOR GREED, NOT NEED

1.1. Early deep sea mining supporters
appealed to fears of foreign control
over minerals

Fifty years ago, no one could have foreseen that deep
sea mining would one day be opportunistically re-
framed as a means to quench the mineral thirst of the
energy transition. Even the concept of an “energy tran-
sition” barely existed before Harrison Brown, a chemist
from the California Institute of Technology, first coined
the term during a conference in 1967.13 A few years lat-
er, the 1973 and 1979 oil crises would prompt leaders
to start seriously contemplating alternative sources of
energy to reduce their reliance on oil producing nations.

The strategy used in the 1970s by John E. Flipse, pres-
ident of Deepsea Ventures, was to present deep sea
mining as instrumental for the United States to prevent
a “cartelization” of terrestrial mining in the hands of
a few developing countries.14 The risk, Flipse claimed,
was that the “New Economic Order”15 being pursued by
newly independent countries would result in this “car-
telization as a resurgence of unsavory national, instead
of business, monopolies”, thus putting the U.S. supply of
critical minerals at risk.

Even as recently as the early 2010s, when Lockheed
Martin secured new deep sea exploration licenses
with the UK government, “no one really understood that

critical metals were going to be needed for green tech-
nologies, which were really small at the time”, recalled
Chris Williams, who managed the licenses for Lockheed
Martin, in an interview with a freelance journalist.* He
explained that, “I think it’s fair to say that one of the
key drivers for the UK interest in this at the time was
geopolitical” because “it was understood that China was
strengthening its position across the world in terms of the
upstream part of minerals.”

It was only during the diplomatic lead up to the 2015
Paris Agreement16—where parties committed to “[hold]
the increase in the global average temperature to well
below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and [pursue] efforts to
limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C” (Article 2.1(a))—
that the energy transition began to rise to the top of the
international agenda. The Agreement also emphasized
the need for “making finance flows consistent with a path-
way towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-re-
silient development” (Article 2.1(c)), prompting a surge
in public and private sector interest in so-called “green”
technologies. Aspiring deep sea miners jumped on the
bandwagon and began shaping a shiny new narrative to
grasp for a much needed “social license to operate”.

*  Greenpeace USA hired a team of investigative journalists to conduct interviews with government officials, defense contractors and deep
sea mining industry executives to ask for their perspectives on the linkages between deep sea mining, national security and defense.

DEEP DECEPTION1.2. Climate change offered a
chance for credibility, but the story
was rejected by science, markets,
and governments
a. Tech pundits co-opted the
energy transition to frame the
public debate on deep sea mining

Deep sea mining companies latched onto climate

change in a desperate attempt to transform the

energy transition into an opportunity to attract

investors and political patrons. Newer entrants to the

market, like Canada-based The Metals Company (TMC,

formerly DeepGreen Metals), began describing them-
selves as “an explorer of the world’s largest estimated
undeveloped source of critical battery metals”.17 Until very
recently, TMC planned to apply for an ISA contract to

extract minerals from the ocean floor by June 2025

via its contractor relationship with the Pacific Island
state of Nauru,18 and—despite its subsidiary TMC USA
applying for a license unilaterally through the U.S. (as

described in the Introduction)—in this fast-changing

arena, it still may.

Meanwhile, TMC’s CEO, Gerard Barron, never missed a

chance to deploy a metaphor to downplay the envi-

ronmental impacts of deep sea mining and mislead

audiences, regularly describing polymetallic nodules as

“potato-sized rocks” lying on a “golf driving range”, or
promising “a battery in a rock.”19 In its presentations to
investors, TMC purported that deep sea mining-sourced

metals could enable the manufacturing of 280 million

electric vehicles (EVs) with less environmental im-
pact than terrestrial mining.20 Electrifying the world’s
passenger car fleet, the company claims, would require
“56 million tons of nickel, 7 million tons of manganese,
7 million tons of cobalt, and 85 million tons of copper.”21

But these dated figures no longer hold up to scrutiny in
the rapidly evolving EV battery market.22

Impossible Metals, another North American startup,
promoted a similar narrative: “A growing population,
continued urbanization, emerging market economies and

the transition to carbon neutral energies will continue to
demand critical metals in volumes,” the firm writes.23
The five-year-old company headquartered in Califor-
nia, that’s on a mission to develop a Remote Operated

Vehicle (ROV) able to collect underwater minerals, has

claimed to be “sustainably-minded” and shows off a

trophy room of “planet-friendly” logos on its website,

including B-Corp and Pledge 1%, claiming that the

company “directly supports” a number of Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs). But in reality, these initia-

tives do little to monitor corporate activities against

any credible environmental or social standard.

It also appears that the key data underlying the indus-

try’s pro-deep sea mining narrative was either internal-

ly produced by the companies themselves or authored

in academic journals by people with a vested interest in

the deep sea mining industry. For example, an often-cit-
ed academic paper published in 2020 in the Journal of
Cleaner Production,24 comparing the life-cycle climate
change impact of deep sea mined nodules to land ores,

was authored by (among others) Daina Paulikas and

Saleem H. Ali, who at the time were both serving as
advisors to TMC (formerly DeepGreen).25 Paulikas now
advises the Seafloor Minerals Fund (SMF), a newcomer

in the deep sea mining market. Another of the article’s

article in the journal Biodiversity and Conservation, along
with TMC’s Environmental Manager, Michael Clarke, in

which they asserted the opinion that deep sea mining

show that the environmental narrative used to justify

to compare biodiversity between the deep sea and

rainforests in order to assess the impact of deep sea
mining.30 But TMC was not alone. In 2022, an academic
paper arguing in favor of the low carbon footprint of
polymetallic nodules, again published in the Journal of
Cleaner Production, was co-authored and designed by
Chris Duhayon, who was Metallurgical R&D Manager at
Global Sea Mineral Resources (GSR) at the time.31 GSR
is a subsidiary of the DEME Group, a Belgian company

specializing in dredging and building marine infrastruc-

tures, which holds a Belgium-sponsored exploration
contract in the CCZ that expires in 2028.32

The findings of these studies have been questioned.

Planet Tracker, an ESG-focused think tank, has crit-

icized both Paulikas et al.’s 2020 paper and the
GSR-funded research for their methodological bias.33
The former excluded 95% of the deep sea nodules’

manganese content from its life-cycle impact assess-

ment, while the latter failed to apply decarbonized

refining technologies to its land-based mining compar-

ison—despite using such assumptions for seabed pro-

cessing. In addition to these critiques, a 2023 peer-re-

viewed study by Benjamin Fritz et al. found that, under

certain realistic conditions, mining polymetallic nodules

from the deep sea could result in a 28% higher climate

impact than producing the same metals from land-
based sources. Notably, the Fritz at al. study is one of

the few independent life-cycle assessments not funded
by a deep sea mining company.34

Even TMC itself acknowledged the uncertainty of

comparing the impact of deep sea mining to land-based
mining. In its financial filings, the company warned: “It
may also not be possible to definitively say whether the

b. … but deep sea mining is
losing support from the electric
vehicle and battery industries

As early as March 2021, major car makers BMW

Group and Volvo Group joined forces with WWF,

Samsung SDI and Google to sign a call for a morato-
rium on deep sea mining .36 “Before any potential deep
seabed mining occurs, it needs to be clearly demonstrated

that such activities can be managed in a way that ensures
the effective protection of the marine environment”, the
four companies declared to the Associated Press.37
They have since been joined by Volkswagen and Sca-

nia, Polestar, Renault and Rivian, along with several

battery manufacturing and charging infrastructure

companies, including Addvolt, Charge and Northvolt.

As of May 2025, 64 companies from all sectors had

signed the Business Statement calling for a moratori-

um on deep sea mining activities, and committed not

to source minerals from the deep sea, to exclude such

minerals from their supply chains, and not to finance
deep sea mining activities .38

Meanwhile, several American automakers that have not

signed onto the Business Statement, including GM, Ford

and Tesla, are members of the Initiative for Responsible

Mining Assurance (IRMA). IRMA is a certification and

accountability standard for industrial-scale mining that

promotes best practices in environmental and social

responsibility. IRMA does not certify or endorse deep

scientific knowledge, the inability to audit impacts, and

the risk that IRMA’s Standard could be inappropriately

Regulations such as the Corporate sustainability due

diligence directive (CSDDD), adopted by the EU in June

2024, are likely to further deter car makers and bat-

tery manufacturers from exposing their supply chains

to environmentally and socially undesirable extractive
processes like deep sea mining.40

In addition to the ecological argument, EV and bat-

tors focused on NMC chemistry,47 despite a changing
battery chemistry landscape that has reduced demand
for manganese and nickel in EV batteries.48

Impossible Metals takes this dissonance even further.

Rather than adapting to a technological shift away from

nickel- and cobalt-heavy battery chemistries, CEO Oliver

Gunasekara has publicly argued that deep sea mining

could reverse this trend by lowering the cost of these

metals—thus removing the incentive to innovate beyond
them.49 This self-serving logic reflects a broader industry
stance: rather than responding to material and techno-

logical innovation, deep sea mining proponents seek to

technological shift is undermining the claim that deep

sea mining is required to achieve the energy transition.
They contend that “rapidly expanding sales of Lithium
Iron Phosphate [LFP] and other EV batteries that don’t use

metals sought to be mined from the deep sea have elimi-

nated the purported need for DSM to meet the growing de-
mand for EVs.”41 According to the International Energy
Agency: “Over the last five years, LFP has moved from a
minor share to the rising star of the battery industry, sup-

plying more than 40% of EV demand globally by capacity
in 2023, more than double the share recorded in 2020.”42

Batteries using LFP chemistries are increasingly pre-

ferred for certain applications due to their lower cost,

safer operation, and avoidance of critical metals like
cobalt and nickel. 43 In some cases, these chemistries
also emit less greenhouse gas over their life cycle

than traditional NMC (nickel manganese cobalt ox-

ide) batteries—especially when supply chains rely on

By undercutting the market signals driving the transi-

tion to safer, more scalable battery chemistries like LFP

and sodium-ion, this strategy risks locking the clean

energy sector into less sustainable, extraction-heavy

supply chains. In doing so, deep sea mining not only lags

behind technological innovation—it threatens to derail it.

What’s being sold as a solution for the future is, in reali-

ty, an attempt to resurrect the economics of the past.

These rates are expected to rise.

Some of the strongest opposition comes from the
Pacific, where deep sea miners are looking to strike

first. As the President of Palau declared at the ISA in

this initial model, a hypothetical 3-megaton nodule

mine was valued at $2.9 billion (inflation adjusted to
2025).59 But this is wildly overestimating the contri-
bution of manganese, and a 2023 update reduced the
valuation to $1.6 billion.60 Both estimates relied on
peak prices for cobalt and nickel—prices that have since

plummeted. By early 2025, the ISA’s hypothetical mine
stood at just $1.3 billion dollars in projected value. In

total, the hypothetical mine has lost over $1.6 billion in

less damaging to our planet.”63 This is expressed even
more deeply by Indigenous voices from Pacific Islands.

Solomon Kaho’ohalaha, a Hawaiian elder and co-chair
of the Pacific Islands Heritage Coalition states: “This
culture of ours is based on our intimate relationship with

the ocean, and any harm done to the ocean is a direct
attack on our way of life.”64 For Kaho’ohalahala and
others, the seabed is not a site of untapped wealth—it

is part of a sacred genealogy, a place of origin and

responsibility, not profit.

This rejection of deep sea mining and the industry’s

attempted climate justification—what many critics call

a greenwash—is adding political weight to the growing

movement for a moratorium.

DEEP DECEPTIONTogether, these trends are putting the already fragile

deep sea mining business model at even greater risk.

Faced with mounting obstacles to their questionable

energy transition claims, since around 2022 pro-

spective deep sea miners have once again started to

reshape their strategic narrative, this time returning

to the home turf of the first movers in the industry:

national security, specifically targeting the U.S.

Far from advancing the green transition, deep sea

mining is increasingly being justified through the lens

of military strategy and geopolitical competition. But

like every other self-serving pivot, this is being driv-

never-ending quest to justify their existence and finally

make some money, rather than the current priorities or

From Cold War Cover-Up to Corporate Capture
In 1975, investigative reporter Jack Anderson revealed the CIA’s $4.7 billion deep sea mining boondoggle (inflation adjust-
ed to 2025). “Project Azorian”—a personal project of then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger—was a covert CIA operation
to salvage a Soviet submarine from the floor of the Pacific, about 1,600 miles northwest of Hawai`i and about 16,500
feet deep.65,66 To build a vessel capable of recovering the submarine undetected, the CIA tapped eccentric billionaire
Howard Hughes to launch a venture to mine the polymetallic nodules of the deep Pacific and provide the perfect
cover for Project Azorian. The result was the Glomar Explorer, a deep sea mining ship equipped with a capture vehicle
deployed from a moon pool hidden in the hull. Defense contractor Lockheed Corp. built the capture vehicle.67

The operation was an intelligence failure and only

recovered one-third of the submarine. The Soviets had
vessels tailing Glomar Explorer throughout. Ironically,
Anderson’s leak produced the only political benefit: with

the operation unmasked, the U.S. released a video of

the at-sea burial of six Soviet sailors and returned the

ship’s bell to the Kremlin—an unexpected moment of

Cold War cooperation.

A few years earlier, in August 1970, a fledgling company

called Deepsea Ventures Inc. had announced that it had
completed the “world’s first successful test of a system

verted into the United States’ first deep sea mining ship had lifted “10 to 60 tons of nodules per hour”, from some
3,000 feet below the surface.69 Deepsea Ventures’ founder, John E. Flipse, predicted optimistically that, “a single ship
designed for the operation could gather a million tons of Pacific Oceans nodules in a year”. The South Carolina News and
Courier declared that: “  Mining the ocean for manganese and other valuable minerals could lead to a unique multi-billion
dollar industry.”70

The rush for this mythical deep sea bonanza was just getting started. Companies began meddling in seabed explo-

ration, including major players in the mining, oil and gas, steelmaking, and defense industries, and several consortia

were formed to compete for seabed wealth. Among them, the Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO) stands out because
it included a defense contractor: Lockheed Corp.71

Project Azorian’s deep sea mining cover story unintentionally boosted commercial interest in seabed minerals. But

Kissinger quickly denied Deepsea Ventures’ request for exclusive mining rights in the Pacific’s Clarion-Clipperton
Zone,72,73 with the Department of State emphasizing that the appropriate avenue for addressing seabed mining
issues in the high seas was the ongoing United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) negotiations.74
This rejection indicated the U.S. government’s openness at that time to multilateral agreements over chaotic, uni-

lateral scrambles for oceanic resources. It also signaled its reluctance to endorse private exploitation of the seabed

without an international framework.

Project Azorian was a failure. It also served to buoy a nascent and likely economically non-viable industry. By sup-

porting the cover story, the CIA funded research into the viability of deep sea mining, propped up media interest in

the industry, and financed the construction of a vessel designed for deep sea mining, thus removing the financial
burden from its favored defense company: Lockheed Corp., which would continue using the Glomar Explorer for deep
sea mining exploration for almost two decades.

Over the next few years, while the UNCLOS negotiations lagged, the evolution of a new American law would usher

Lockheed Corp. further towards deep sea mining. That law was the 1980 Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act
(DSHMRA),75 passed as a stopgap measure while the international negotiations were underway. But, though UNCLOS
was adopted in 1982, the U.S. never ratified the treaty. Instead, DSHMRA established a proxy framework designed
to allow U.S. citizens to pursue seabed mining exploration activities in the high seas.76 In 1984, NOAA issued
exploration licenses based on the DSHMRA for four sites beyond U.S. jurisdiction in the CCZ. Two of these original

DSHMRA licenses—USA-1 and USA-4—remain active and are periodically renewed by their holder: defense giant
Lockheed Martin.77

The regime’s low profile persisted for decades—until April 2025, when TMC ignited controversy by becoming the

first company to submit an application for a commercial deep sea mining license under DSHMRA. This bid to activate

the Cold War–era framework has drawn sharp international rebuke, highlighting concerns over unilateral U.S. action

and the erosion of the global seabed regime. Unlike Henry Kissinger, President Trump’s Executive Order on 24 April

2025 signals that the current U.S. administration may look favorably on TMC’s application, bypass UNCLOS, and

undermine multilateral governance of the common heritage of humankind: the deep sea.

DEEP DECEPTIONa. Canada-based The Metals
Company invokes U.S. national
security

In early 2022, TMC began actively framing deep

sea mining as a national security imperative. While

still publicly emphasizing its role in enabling the green

transition, TMC’s lobbying efforts—targeting defense

and industrial policy stakeholders—reflect a strategic

effort to re-anchor deep sea mining within U.S. nation-

al security discourse, reviving Cold War-era narratives

that once positioned seabed extraction as a matter of
geopolitical advantage.79

By January 2024, Gerard Barron made this focus

explicit in an op-ed for C4ISRNet—a media outlet

dedicated to defense and government technology—
entitled “Deep sea mining of polymetallic nodules needed
for national security.”80

A transition in TMC’s talking points is also evident in its

own press releases. The company’s rhetoric has shifted

repeatedly to match the political moment, revealing a

pattern of opportunistic storytelling aimed at whatever

message will unlock investor interest or policy support .

Just a few years ago, TMC press releases trumpeted the

projected volume and dollar value of the metals con-

tained in polymetallic nodules—framing the seabed as
a literal goldmine.81 When cobalt prices collapsed and
their central talking point eroded, TMC swiftly shifted

to promoting nickel as the new cornerstone of their

business model, abandoning their moral appeals about

ethical sourcing and child labor in the Democratic

Republic of the Congo previously used to justify mining
the ocean floor.82,83

Beginning in 2022—and increasingly throughout 2023

and 2024—TMC also began minimizing or omitting

financial projections in its investor materials. Whereas

earlier filings and investor decks included bold revenue

forecasts and billion-dollar valuations,

more recent disclosures have con-
spicuously avoided such claims.84 This
coincided with TMC’s increasing use of

national security framing: positioning

itself as vital to U.S. strategic autono-

my and lobbying for public investment

in domestic nodule processing. TMC

press materials began touting defense

relevance, positioning its operations

as essential to U.S. competitiveness

with China and critical mineral inde-

pendence, signaling a deliberate pivot
from climate-solution branding to
defense-sector alignment.85,86

This rhetorical sleight-of-hand reflects

not a principled commitment to either

sustainability or security, but a compa-

ny scrambling to remain relevant and—
most importantly—funded.87,88,89,90

DEEP DECEPTIONSAFE Harbor? TMC Courts the Defense
Sector While Experts Cast Doubt on
Security Claims

TMC’s public movements—where it speaks, who it meets with—
show that the company has increasingly been trying to insert
deep sea mining into the U.S. national security agenda. One
forum for achieving this goal is the annual SAFE (Securing
America’s Future Energy) Summit in Washington, D.C.

In February 2022, 17 retired generals, admirals, and officers—
including 13 members of SAFE’s Energy Security Leadership
Council (ESLC)—sent a letter to the U.S. Department of De-
fense urging support for seabed mineral extraction. Though
the U.S. military’s actual demand for metals like cobalt and
nickel remains limited, the letter claimed that “defense systems
increasingly rely on critical and rare earth minerals.”91 The letter
closely paralleled TMC’s own advocacy,92 reflecting a shared
narrative of deep sea mining’s role in securing critical mineral supply chains.

TMC CEO Gerard Barron celebrates “making friends” with U.S. national
security leaders at a D.C. critical minerals forum in March 2024—part
of the company’s pivot from environmental to geopolitical messaging.

By 2023, TMC had secured sponsorship at the SAFE Summit, a platform that convenes former military brass and
business leaders to advance U.S. energy security. In March 2024, TMC CEO Gerard Barron took the stage at the SAFE
Summit to pitch a new strategy: “forget about mining, [and] focus on refining.”93 After the event, Barron posted on
LinkedIn: “I like it here in D.C. So many U.S. heavyweights, Generals, Admirals, Secretaries and Ambassadors who care about
the environment AND security of critical mineral supply, all in one town. Very efficient.”94

Yet this message shifted leading up to President Trump’s April 2025 Executive Order, which signaled White House
support for using the 1980 Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA) to issue deep sea mining licenses.
While the 1980s legal framework already existed—though it had never been used to authorize commercial ex-
traction—TMC quickly announced it would proceed under the existing U.S. seabed mining code, capitalizing on the
political opportunity generated by the Executive Order. In doing so, the company pivoted from its former focus on
U.S.-based refining and paused its long-pursuit of a commercial license through the International Seabed Authority
(ISA), instead turning to NOAA for direct commercial mining approval.

The move suggests that TMC shifts its narrative opportunistically with the political winds—possibly seeking a
bump from investors amid an increasingly precarious financial position—not out of any principled commitment to
U.S. industry or genuine defense needs. SAFE’s public embrace does not equate to a wider endorsement of deep
sea mining from active U.S. defense institutions. SAFE’s high-profile military figures are retired, and many are now
affiliated with private sector interests. A 2024 letter obtained by The Wall Street Journal95 called on U.S. Senators to
ratify UNCLOS in part to preserve seabed claims under DSHMRA, but deep sea mining was only one in a long string
of justifications for UNCLOS ratification. There is no evidence that deep sea mining is a core driver of U.S. military
planning or procurement.

DEEP DECEPTIONAt the SAFE Summit in April 2025, Leticia Carvalho, Secretary-General of the ISA, offered a counterpoint to the
emerging security narrative. In her keynote, she emphasized that seabed minerals fall under international jurisdic-
tion and “the [International Seabed] Authority is the only international body legally mandated to govern mineral-related
activities in the seabed beyond national jurisdictions…our mandate is clear: to manage these resources for the benefit of all
humanity … the deep seabed belongs to no one, but to all of us.”96

b. Connecting the dots: playing
on geopolitical fears to cash in on

concerns over the vulnerability of U .S . critical miner-

c. Deep sea mining opportunists
contrive support from
Republican defense hawks

Despite these onshoring and friendshoring efforts,

the desire to secure mineral supply chains in tumul-

tuous times has been obsessing Capitol Hill officials,
and deep sea mining proponents have been vying

to convince policymakers that mining the deep sea

is now a matter of national security. It is against this

backdrop that Oliver Gunasekara of Impossible Metals
claimed that “the only resource of scale that can really
change [Chinese dependency] is deep sea minerals” to an
independent researcher hired by Greenpeace USA. How-
ever, the most strident efforts to unite the interests of

deep sea mining and the defense industry have argu-

ably been led by TMC. In search of fresh support for

deep sea mining, from an outside perspective it appears

the company has built a new influencing strategy tar-

geting three key players in the U.S. public debate: for-

mer military officials and veterans, Republican Members

of Congress, and the Department of Defense (DOD).

The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which

sets the levels of funding for the U.S Army and for

defense priorities, is the key piece of legislation that

TMC has been seeking to influence to achieve its goals.

With a record-breaking $883.7 billion in spending voted

for the fiscal year 2025—$849.9 billion of which was
allocated to DOD101—the NDAA accounts for more than
half of the entire discretionary spending of the U.S.

government. Therefore, it encompasses a large array of

policies considered matters of national security, going

procurement, and stockpiling policies. In particular, the

NDAA for fiscal year 2024 (NDAA FY24) required DOD

to develop a strategy, within one year, to secure critical

mineral supply chains, independent from “countries of
concern”, by 2035.102 The NDAA FY25 mandates the
DOD to provide a comprehensive feasibility study fo-

cused on domestic refining capabilities for polymetallic
nodules to the House Armed Services Committee.103

Records show that TMC spent nearly half a million dol-
lars over two years to hire two firms, the Vogel Group

and Bracewell LLC, to lobby Congress and influence
the NDAA votes in June 2023 and June 2024.104 In
the House Report on the NDAA FY24 released in June

2023, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) di-

rected the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial
Base Policy to deliver a report “assessing the processing
of seabed resources of polymetallic nodules domestical-
ly”.105 This was later confirmed when the bill became
Public Law in December 2023.106

The decision was hailed by TMC on its website in Jan-

uary 2024, and Barron declared in March 2024 on X
that “our interactions with DOD and Congressional officials
give us confidence that those preparing the next Pentagon

report understand the challenges of metals procurement

and the major opportunities for nodule processing in the
United States.”107

TMC’s lobbying campaign on NDAA FY25 helped lead to
DOD being directed to produce yet another study “to
assess the feasibility of improving domestic capabilities

for refining polymetallic nodule-derived intermediates into

high purity nickel, cobalt sulfate, and copper for defense
applications”, according to a bill released by the House

TMC’s public relations strategy and lobbying activities

came to fruition in March 2024, when Representatives

Carol Miller (R.-WV) and John Joyce (R.-PA) introduced

the Responsible Use of Seafloor Resources Act of 2024
(RUSRA).122 The bill provides unequivocal support to
deep sea mining, stating that “the collection of seafloor
nodules is integral to ensuring the United States does not
continue its over-dependence” on foreign countries of
concern. Data from opensecrets .org shows that TMC is

the only corporation to have recorded lobbying activi-
ties on that bill.123 If adopted by Congress, the RUSRA
would, among other objectives, task DOD “to provide
resources for the build out of domestic nodule processing
capacity to produce high purity critical minerals.”124 As
of March 2025, the bill has been referred to compe-

The invitation to TMC was not long in coming. On 10

that masks a deeper uncertainty about the viability,

risks and legitimacy of deep sea mining.

But Greenpeace USA investigations have discovered

that Barron didn’t stop at the door of the DOE. In

November 2022, TMC’s U.S. subsidiary DeepGreen

Resources, LLC applied for a $9 million grant from

a Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III program for
feasibility work on a domestic refinery for nodule-de-
rived intermediate products.127 Through DPA Title III,
the President of the United States can issue grants,

loans and loan guarantees to secure onshore produc-

tion, ranging from equipment relevant to combating

Covid-19 pandemics to critical minerals processing

facilities or mining.

The decision on TMC’s 2022 grant application is now

in the hands of the Trump administration’s Office of

Manufacturing Capability Expansion and Investment

Prioritization at the DOD. In November 2023, five Rep-

resentatives from Texas wrote a letter to the Assistant

Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy in

support of TMC’s application. According to the docu-

ment, the processing facility is planned to be located in
Texas.128 The letter argues that “support for the project
would represent an investment in our national security,

domestic economy and production of materials to support
the energy transition.” But the DOD may also be subject
to TMC lobbying activity. When asked by a freelance

journalist about TMC’s connections to the Pentagon, a
TMC representative reckoned that, “given the national
security [context], we speak a lot to the DOD. (...) They are
very well aware of the potential of [our] industry”.

e. Weaponizing the deep sea
mining narrative: national
security as industry strategy

TMC is not alone in its effort to build bridges be-
tween the deep sea mining industry and defense-mil-

itary interests. Deep sea mining proponents are

garnering support from a growing number of veterans

through venture capital firms in search of funding

opportunities in defense-related technology startups.

An increasing number of former senior U.S. military offi-

cers, once retired, are joining the ranks of venture cap-
ital firms with a national security focus.129 In December
2023, The New York Times listed at least 50 high-ranking
veterans who had joined venture capital firms while still
interacting with DOD and Congress.130 Some veterans
are now showing a keen interest in deep sea mining.131

don’t come from the

Only a small fraction of military-relevant minerals can be mined in volume from the deep sea nodules.

stockpiles, allies, and recycling.

the deep sea mining industry. The omnipresence of

For certain alloys used in the defense industry (e.g.

titanium), shortened supply chains with few layers of

U.S. and global military needs. But due to supply chain

complexities, it is very hard to find reliable estimates

of the military demand for other metals—making

over-simplified corporate narratives of scarcity mislead-

ing and unsubstantiated.

Three of the potentially profitable metals contained

in polymetallic nodules are manganese, nickel, and

cobalt. They respectively account for 29%, 1.4%,

and 0.25% of the metals contained in nodules from
the CCZ,148 and they do have military applications:

However, the scale of this military use is relatively

modest compared to global civilian demand—dwarfed
by the commercial manufacturing sector.149 Cobalt, for
instance is important for the superalloys used in jet

engines, yet military uses represent less than 10% of
global demand.150 Applications like electric vehicles,
renewable energy infrastructure, steel production, and

consumer electronics drive the overwhelming majority

of global mineral demand.

Manganese was the original economic justification for
the development of the deep sea mining industry. In the

early 1970s, when demand for manganese was near its

height, manganese made up over 70% of the value of

a polymetallic nodule. The value of manganese relative

to other critical minerals has since declined, largely due

to changes in steel manufacturing, which accounts for
approximately 90% of manganese use.151

Manganese is the only major product of deep sea min-

ing for which the U.S. is wholly dependent on imports.

Manganese ore is imported principally from Gabon
(62%), South Africa (24%), and Mexico (13%).152

Manganese is a curious case, as it makes up a large pro-

portion of the recoverable minerals from a polymetallic

nodule mine but is in much lower demand compared

with cobalt and nickel. Even in the 1970s, forecasters

noted that manganese prices were highly volatile and

that a relatively modest commercial deep sea mining

operation producing 1 million tons of nodules per year

(about a third the annual production volume that the

ISA predicts from the first commercial mining leases)

would be ten times the annual consumption of manga-
nese in the U.S. in 1970.153

substantial deep sea mining development could nearly

double the global supply of manganese in its first year,

resulting in an immediate oversupply of the metal. Sub-

sequent deep sea mining projects would likely result

in significant reductions in the value of manganese

and the mining operation as a whole. For comparison,

in 2023, a 10% nickel production surplus resulted in a
21% collapse in nickel prices.154

Nearly all defense needs for manganese are related

to steel production. The U.S. maintains a stockpile of
322,000 tons of manganese ore in Wenden, Arizona.155
Manganese recycling is negligible.

Nickel is a shiny, silver metal that is essential to a vari-

ety of industries, but 85% of domestic nickel consump-

tion goes towards the production of stainless steel and

other alloys. The U.S. consumed approximately 190,000
tons of nickel in 2024.156 Nickel is used in military ap-
plications for armor and aircraft alloys, but, like cobalt,

its most pressing use is in high-capacity batteries for

electric vehicles and energy storage.

The U.S. imports nickel from Canada (46%), Norway

(9%), Finland (7%), and Russia, (7%). Worldwide nickel
production was 3.3 million tons in 2022.157 Over half
of that production was from Indonesia, whose market

dominance is projected to grow throughout the decade.

Nearly half of U.S. nickel imports come from Canada,

with the Department of Defense awarding significant

funding to Canadian nickel producers to increase pro-
duction.158 The Russian Federation is the world’s third
largest nickel producer, accounting for 8% of global

production and Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has

led to major volatility in the metal commodities mar-
ket.159 The U.S. produces roughly 17,000 tons of nickel
from a single mine in Michigan. That nickel is exported

to Canada for processing.

While the cost of nickel can be extremely volatile, it

does not have the same supply chain disruption risks as
cobalt.161 Nickel is readily recycled and over 50% of U.S.
nickel consumption in 2023 was from recycled nickel.162

Cobalt is a grey lustrous metal commonly extracted

in conjunction with copper and nickel. The U.S. used

approximately 6,400 tons of cobalt in 2024, represent-

in superalloys, primarily for aircraft engines; 25% was

used in chemical applications; 15% in other metallic

applications; and 10% in carbides for abrasives and
cutting tools.163 Cobalt has numerous military appli-
cations, including for temperature-resistant alloys for

jet engines, magnets for stealth technology, electronic
warfare, as well as alloys for munitions.164 However,
globally, lithium ion batteries are the leading use of
cobalt; according to the Cobalt Institute, “battery appli-
cations account for 73% of cobalt demand and are the
dominant driver of market growth.”165

DEEP DECEPTIONThe U.S. imports cobalt from Norway (25%), Canada

(15%), Finland (13%), and Japan (12%) and produc-

es some cobalt domestically. There are nickel-copper

mines in Michigan and Missouri, both of which produce

cobalt as a secondary product. The U.S. attempted to

commission a mine in Idaho, which would be only the

second mine in the world whose primary production

was cobalt, but production was suspended due to the

declining price of cobalt. The U.S. has approximately

69,000 tons of cobalt reserves and has identified ap-

proximately 1 million tons of potential cobalt deposits
within the country.166

While numbers for pure defense needs are not general-

ly available, and much of the strategic need for cobalt

is wrapped up in lithium-ion batteries used for both
civilian and military purposes, at the peak of the Cold

War, the U.S. maintained a defense stockpile of 13,000

tons. That number has shrunk to an estimated 333
tons.167 Recycling accounted for approximately 25% of
cobalt consumption in 2023.

Although the global rise in military spending may con-

tribute to increased demand for critical minerals in gen-

eral, including cobalt, sales of electric vehicles are what

is driving global demand. Accordingly, the rapid shift to

Lithium Iron Phosphate and sodium-ion battery chem-

istries is likely to reduce the EV industry’s demand for

cobalt. In an interview with Reuters, Defense Logistics
Agency (DLA) spokesperson Joe Yoswa said: “DLA ... con-
ducts critical material supply chain assessments biennially

to determine NDS (National Defense Stockpiles) require-

ments. Cobalt is not currently presenting as a vulnerability
requiring stockpiling.”168

Of the dominant critical minerals potentially produced

by deep sea mining, cobalt is the most vulnerable to

disruption, economic and trade volatility, and supply
risk.169 Even given the volatility of the cobalt supply
chain, the U.S. possesses internal production capacity

b. Military needs are already
addressed by alternative supply
strategies

The notion that deep sea mining is necessary to en-

sure military readiness or strategic autonomy over-

looks the robust and ongoing investments in sus-

tainable supply solutions. Governments are already

working to diversify and secure mineral inputs through:

•  Domestic and allied sourcing agreements (e.g. U.S.-

Australia and EU-Canada critical minerals partnerships).

•  Recycling and circular economy approaches, espe-

cially for cobalt and nickel from spent batteries.

•  Strategic stockpiling programs, such as the U.S.

National Defense Stockpile managed by the Depart-
ment of Defense.

•  Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) involving G7

and allied countries to coordinate non-deep sea min-

ing mineral security.

These strategies are far more aligned with long-term

security priorities than opening an ecologically fragile,

In short, the defense sector’s limited demand, combined

with the availability of reliable allied supply chains and

strategic stockpiling measures, undercuts the argu-

the defense sector’s critical mineral needs—especially

when considered against the potential environmental

and geopolitical costs of initiating industrial mining in

the deep ocean.

However, TMC is always ready to seize any opportu-

exploitation license following President Trump’s April

use of these in defense applications is quite significant.
So, you know, of course, there will be interest,” said Rory

And no one but TMC is acting like procuring deep sea

clearly by the DOD’s recent decision that there is no

Article 141 of UNCLOS affirms that “the Area shall

amendments to provisions in Part XI, Congress declined

to ratify the treaty, leaving the U.S. in a unique situation

as the largest economy that is not a member of the ISA.

While joining UNCLOS would grant the United States

more influence at the ISA, UNCLOS ratification remains

politically unlikely. It conflicts with long-standing oppo-

sition to international legal constraints and the Trump

administration’s broader rejection of multilateral agree-

ments, starkly evidenced by his decision to withdraw
the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on his very first day
in office.178

Politics, not policy, continues to keep ratification off

argue that it would allow Washington to have a vote at

the ISA. But rather than taking a seat at the negotiation

national law”. The company reveals to investors that
this “could affect international perceptions of the project

DSHMRA lost their international standing, as they are

not recognized under the ISA regime established by

UNCLOS. While these licenses remain valid under U.S.

law, their legitimacy under international law is limited,

and overlapping ISA designations underscore their lack

of enforceability beyond U.S. jurisdiction. Under the
DSHMRA, exploration licenses permit U.S. entities to

the U.S. and other countries. UNCLOS establishes a

package of rights which all states, including the U.S.,

enjoy. Acting unilaterally on deep sea mining would not

only lead to legal challenges but also weaken the abili-

ty of the U.S. to demand compliance from other states

on matters such as illegal fishing, military navigation,

and the enforcement of extended continental shelf

Among Pacific Island nations—who steward vast swaths

of ocean space under national jurisdiction and hold a

moral stake in international seabed governance—de-

bates over seabed mining remain deeply complex. Many

governments are weighing the industry’s promises of

economic development against the risks of geopolitical

entanglement, and cultural and environmental harm.

As Satyendra Prasad and Emily Hardy of the Carnegie
Endowment observe: “A concern for many Pacific states is
that deep sea mining in the Blue Pacific will become a new

theater of resource conflict as high-income states descend
on identified clusters of polymetallic nodules.”183

This is all symptomatic of growing global geopolitical

to marine ecosystems, the cultural consequences of

tensions for the control of seabed infrastructure and

seabed exploration, and the risks of financial liabilities.

Civil society leaders, ocean experts, and Indigenous

stewards across the region are voicing alarm about the

opacity of decision-making and the pace of industry

advancement.

As Kaho‘ohalahala, Native Hawaiian elder with the Maui
Nui Makai Network and ardent ocean advocate, con-
veyed to Greenpeace USA: “We are not here to be a test
bed for the world’s extractive industries. The ocean is not
a frontier to conquer, but a relative to protect.” His words
echo a deep cultural worldview that sees the ocean not

tut Polytechnique de Paris notes, “Underwater resources
are seen as a new front for asserting sovereignty” and
“The seabed is emerging as a new geopolitical arena, with
its own rationales and fault lines.”188

Deep sea mining is a geopolitically risky business. The

prospect of opening up a new resource frontier is already

creating and exacerbating tensions. These tensions will

inevitably be heightened if deep sea mining is allowed to

From Washington’s perspective, China is
viewed as an increasingly assertive actor in

the Pacific region—and perceived as active-

ly expanding its influence across the Global

South. In this geopolitical framing, deep

sea mining is recast not as an ecological

or cultural question, but as a competitive

variable in securing access to critical in-

frastructure, supply chains, and alignment
with emerging economies.

DEEP DECEPTION3.2. Militarizing resources,
socializing losses, privatizing
profits: mining the seabed could
violate UNCLOS
a. Deep sea mining and the
weaponization of the deep sea

The growing jockeying for influence and access

signals that the deep seabed is at risk of becoming

a new theater of geopolitical contest. While there

is no clear evidence that deep sea mining is currently

driven by national defense requirements, nor that mil-

itary procurement systems are shaping the market,

there is growing concern among experts that deep

sea minerals—especially if sourced through unilateral

frameworks like the U.S. DSHMRA—could end up in

defense supply chains by default.

The possibility that minerals extracted from the inter-

national seabed could be funneled—either deliberate-

ly or inadvertently—into military supply chains would

further erode the peaceful intent of UNCLOS Article
141, that “the Area shall be open to use exclusively for
peaceful purposes by all States”. Once deep sea mined
minerals enter global supply chains, it will be very

difficult to prevent them being incorporated into

military applications through defense contracting and

manufacturing.

The potential militarization of deep sea-sourced min-

erals, even unintentionally, would contradict both the

spirit and the letter of UNCLOS. This raises serious

legal and ethical questions and should be a matter of

urgent concern for all governments .

b. From common heritage to
corporate asset: how corporations
are claiming the seabed

Alongside its commitment to peace, UNCLOS declares

the international seabed to be the “common heritage

of humankind”, meant to benefit all nations. But in

practice, deep sea mining is advancing along very differ-

ent lines. Private companies like TMC now control vast

swaths of the international seabed, including areas orig-

inally reserved for developing countries. Through legal

loopholes and sponsorships by small island states, these

corporations have secured prime territory—undermining

both the equity and intent of the UNCLOS framework.

President Trump’s April 2025 Executive Order further

tilts the balance, framing seabed mining as a national

security imperative and positioning U.S. corporations as

instruments of geopolitical power. Under this narrative,

the seabed is no longer a shared global resource—it is a

strategic asset to be exploited in the name of defense.

But war-making and the security priorities of wealthy

nations are not the shared benefits UNCLOS envisioned.

What’s unfolding is not equitable benefit-sharing, but a

global resource grab. One where the Global North profits,

the deep sea suffers, and the world’s poorest nations are

left with the consequences of corporate greed .

These stark asymmetries have alerted the European Jus-

tice Foundation. In a recent analysis for the UK’s Foreign

Affairs Committee’s inquiry on Critical Raw Minerals, the
London-based NGO flagged “a significant concern from a
justice perspective [on] how companies based in the Global

North have secured access to areas reserved for developing
countries. [...] Given the privileges awarded to developing

states, it should be scrutinized whether such partnerships

do not undermine the principle of the common heritage of

mankind and the objective to realize benefits for mankind
as a whole.”189

39

DEEP DECEPTION3.3. A legal minefield:
unilateral deep sea mining would
face serious litigation challenges

Any licensing of deep sea mining through the U .S . Deep

Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA) would

be expected to face several significant legal chal-

lenges—both domestically and internationally. These

challenges will likely raise questions about the legitimacy,

enforceability, and geopolitical consequences of issuing

commercial licenses outside of the UNCLOS framework.

Although it is not a party to UNCLOS, the U.S. recog-

nizes most of its provisions as customary international
law. Article 137 stipulates that “no State shall claim or
exercise sovereignty or sovereign rights over any part of
the Area or its resources.” Only the ISA has the authority
to grant rights to explore and exploit resources in “the

DEEP DECEPTIONLockheed, Kongsberg, and Loke: A cautionary tale
Major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Kongsberg have been involved in deep sea mining since its

inception, but their presence reflects technological alignment more than strategic necessity. From subsea robot-

ics to surveillance systems, they offered capabilities—not demand.

Despite the rhetoric of TMC and renewed political attention under the Trump administration, key defense indus-

try players appear to have stepped back from deep sea mining. Lockheed Martin, which holds the only remaining

active U.S. exploration licenses under the DSHMRA (USA-1 and USA-4), has never conducted any at-sea explo-

ration activities under those claims. According to a 2022 notice from the NOAA, Lockheed’s license extension

requests included no proposals for in-water operations. The company cited unfavorable market conditions and
the lack of international recognition of U.S. deep sea mining licenses as reasons for delaying further activity.192
NOAA has also made clear that any at-sea operations would require prior written authorization and additional
environmental review—none of which Lockheed has sought.193 It costs Lockheed nothing to renew these leases,
while allowing the U.S. to maintain an ongoing political stake in the development of the CCZ. As Walter Sognnes,

former CEO of Loke Marine Minerals (now bankrupt, see below), reflected when interviewed by a freelance jour-
nalist: “Think about it as a lottery ticket that you renew every five years. You get it for free, but you never know when
the lottery is happening. Why should you not take that ticket?”

After nearly five decades of investment in

the development of deep sea mining, Lock-

heed Martin sold its remaining international

assets in early 2023, including the ISA-issued

exploration leases held through its UK Sea-

bed Resources subsidiary, to Norwegian Loke

Marine Minerals.

Deep sea mining has attracted a swirl of

opportunistic investors—from retired military

officials to speculative venture financiers—

drawn by the hype around critical minerals.

Into this space stepped TMC CEO Gerard

Barron, not as a defense visionary, but as

its marketer-in-chief. Flagship partnerships
have crumbled. Kongsberg, Norway’s state-

owned defense and aerospace firm, became a

cornerstone investor in Loke Marine Minerals

in 2023—just before Loke acquired seabed

assets from Lockheed Martin and became

the largest holder of licenses in the CCZ. Less

than two years later, Loke went bankrupt. If

industry’s viability.

Greenpeace Nordic activists launched a 2024 protest action against Loke Marine
Minerals, a Norwegian company that wanted to start deep sea mining in the

All of this extra burden should not be understated. It

important basis for multilateralism in the ocean space,

UNCLOS, is threatened by unilateral action. It would pro-

eral action by a single company or country will not be

DEEP DECEPTIONGuiding Principles for Mineral Sourcing and Use

Greenpeace recommends a set of guiding principles for mineral sourcing and use.198 These principles present
a pathway for ensuring just and equitable use of minerals for a fast, just, and green energy transition.

Reducing demand and finding alternative supplies where available (for example through circularity and
recycling) are key parts of this.199 There is no reason to ever open the global seabed as a new frontier for
destructive exploitation.

Individual governments and those convening as the ISA must play an important role through policy, regulatory,

and accountability measures for mineral use and sourcing. Companies should act responsibly even if states

lack the ability or willingness to protect and respect human rights and the environment.

Recognizing that each country and community has unique realities shaping feasibility and impact, the

following principles can support energy transition when adapted into local contexts and that of the

international seabed:

1.  Minimize Warming to No More Than 1.5ºC (The Guiding Star)

•  Limiting global warming to no more than 1.5ºC is critical for the sake of climate, nature and humanity.

As such, minerals must be prioritized for energy transition above other non-essential uses.

2.  Find Just & Equitable Solutions (The Foundation)

•  Justice and equity is foundational to energy transition and must be embedded in all the related

solutions for the use and sourcing of minerals.

3.  Reduce Demand (Use Less)

•  Slowing mineral demand growth is essential. There are many ways to reduce demand, such as improving

public services and transport, fostering sharing and reuse, enhancing the efficiency of technology, and

substituting technologies. The surest way to reduce the national security risk from dependence on

critical minerals is to invest in novel and alternative technologies which reduce that dependence, rather

than increasing the complexity of vulnerable supply chains via unproven technologies with unknown

impacts in areas beyond national jurisdiction.

4.  Source from “Above Ground” (Use What we Already Have)

•  Recycling must become a preferred source of minerals in the coming decades. Recycling

infrastructure, incentives, and supporting policies must be key priorities for governments to

maximize this supply.

5.  Protect Sensitive Areas, and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (Restrict Mining)

•  Mining and ore processing activities continue to pose serious risks to people and the environment.

“No-Go Zones” including significant natural ecosystems such as the deep sea should be off-limits. The

rights of both coastal and terrestrial Indigenous Peoples and local communities must be respected,
and stronger protections are needed to prevent harm.

In stark contrast to their peers, however, some major U.S.
automakers have not yet voiced any concern regarding deep
sea mining and the use of polymetallic nodules as a source
for critical minerals in the manufacturing of EV batteries.
On 4 June 2024, only 12% of General Motors’ shareholders
voted in favor of a resolution sponsored by As You Sow, a
non-profit shareholder advocacy organization, to disclose the
company’s policies on the use of deep sea mined minerals
across its supply chain. Ten days later, Tesla shareholders
