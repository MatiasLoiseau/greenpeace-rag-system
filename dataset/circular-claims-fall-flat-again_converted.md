EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

A recent Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) report projects that global plastic
use and waste will nearly triple by 2060 with a meager
increase in plastic recycling, resulting in a doubling of
global plastic pollution.2 The United States Department
of Energy (U.S. DOE) estimated that the volume of plastic
waste in the U.S. rose to 44 million metric tons in 2019,3
which is about 295 lbs per person.4

The plastics and products industries have been

promoting plastic recycling as the solution to plastic waste
since the early 1990s.5 Some 30 years later, the vast majority
of U.S. plastic waste is still not recyclable. The U.S. plastic
recycling rate was estimated to have declined to about
5–6% in 2021, down from a high of 9.5% in 2014 and 8.7%
in 2018, when the U.S. exported millions of tons of plastic
waste to China and counted it as recycled even though
much of it was burned or dumped.6

In February 2020, Greenpeace USA published a

comprehensive survey of plastic recycling in the U.S. titled
“Circular Claims Fall Flat.”7 In that report we predicted
that “the economic driver for collecting, sorting and
reprocessing post-consumer plastic products is likely to
worsen as expansion of plastic production lowers the cost
of new resin.”8 That prediction has proven true as the U.S.
plastic recycling rate has continued to decline.

Since 2020, an even greater barrier to plastic recycling

than poor economics has come into focus through scientific
research and testing: the toxicity of recycled plastic.
According to a 2021 report published by the Canadian
Government, toxicity risks in recycled plastic prohibit “the
vast majority of plastic products and packaging produced”
from being recycled into food-grade packaging.9

2022 UPDATE TO 2020
COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY

The 2020 survey examined plastic products accepted
by the U.S.’s approximately 370 material recovery
facilities (MRFs), and U.S. domestic plastic waste
reprocessing capacity. The survey results revealed that
only some types of PET#1 and HDPE#2 plastic bottles
and jugs could be legitimately claimed as recyclable
and led to the conclusion that most types of plastic
packaging were economically impossible to recycle at
the time and would remain so in the future.

This 2022 update of the survey shows little change:
only PET#1 and HDPE#2 plastic bottles and jugs are widely
accepted by the 375 MRFs in operation in the U.S. today.
This finding is consistent with the 2021 California Statewide
Recycling Commission’s determination that only PET#1
and HDPE#2 bottles and jugs are recyclable in California.10

3

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT AGAIN 2022 UPDATEThe 2022 update also confirmed a key finding of the
2020 report: acceptance of a plastic item by a MRF does
not mean that the item will be recycled. As reported by
the Wall Street Journal in August 2022, a California MRF
admitted to accepting PP#5 tubs and disposing of them.11
The City of Knoxville, Tennessee, also publicly states that it
accepts plastics #3-7 at its recycling facility but disposes
of them because “there is no end-market buyer.”12

Moreover, the reprocessing capacity for the two
widely accepted plastic items remains marginal, at
20.9% for PET#1 and 10.3% for HDPE#2 – well under the
30% threshold set by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s
New Plastics Economy (EMF NPE) initiative for
determining whether a plastic product is recyclable.13 In
short, no type of plastic packaging in the U.S. meets the
EMF NPE definition of “recyclable.”

FIVE REASONS WHY MECHANICAL AND
CHEMICAL RECYCLING FAIL

Mechanical and chemical recycling of plastic waste has
largely failed and will always fail because plastic waste
is: (1) extremely difficult to collect, (2) virtually impossible
to sort for recycling, (3) environmentally harmful to
reprocess, (4) often made of and contaminated by
toxic materials, and (5) not economical to recycle.

Paper, cardboard, metal, and glass do not have these
problems, which is why they are recycled at much
higher rates.14

Due to toxicity risks, post-consumer recycled
plastic from household waste is not being produced
at commercial scale for food-grade uses globally or
in the U.S., and likely never will be. While there is limited
availability of food-grade PET#1 for beverage bottles only,
there are growing toxicity concerns there, too.15

As described in a May 2022 OpEd in The Atlantic,
“The problem lies not with the concept or process of
recycling but with the plastic material itself – it is plastic
recycling that does not work.”16 The high recycling
rates of post-consumer paper, cardboard, and metals
in the U.S. prove that recycling can be an effective
way to reclaim valuable natural material resources.
Plastic recycling in particular has failed because
the thousands of types of synthetic plastic materials
produced are fundamentally not recyclable.

WE’RE AT A DECISION POINT
ON SINGLE-USE PLASTICS
AND PACKAGING
As scientific evidence of the harm caused by plastic
waste and pollution and the toxic risks of recycled

plastic continue to mount, discussions about what to do
regarding single-use plastics and plastic packaging are
underway at the global level through the United Nations
Environment Programme’s (UNEP) plastics treaty,17 in the
U.S. Congress and city halls and state capitals across
the country, and in corporate board rooms.

The failure of the concept of plastic recycling is
finally becoming impossible for the companies and
industry associations that promote it – and the non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) that they fund
for this purpose – to ignore. After three decades and
billions of dollars of taxpayer spending, the excuse
offered by the American Chemistry Council (ACC) that
plastic recycling is still “in its infancy” can now be seen
for the delaying tactic that it is.18

Corporate plastic pledge performance reporting

does not reflect the failure of plastic recycling
because it relies on the theoretical possibility of
recycling a plastic item, rather than actual plastic
waste processing rates. The reported shares of
recyclable, reusable, or compostable plastic
packaging used by EMF NPE and U.S. Plastics Pact
member companies – 65.3% at the global level19 and
37% in the U.S.20 – can hardly be taken at face value
when credible estimates show that only 9% of plastic
was recycled globally in 201921 and only 5–6% of
plastic waste was recycled in the U.S. in 2021.22

WE ARE AT A DECISION
POINT ON PLASTIC WASTE
AND POLLUTION:

Will we allow companies to
continue to promote the failed,
toxic plastic recycling myth or
will we demand a pivotal change
that dramatically reduces
the production of single-use
plastics? Instead of continuing
on this false path, companies
in the U.S. and around the world
must urgently phase out single-
use plastics by replacing their
packaging with reuse and refill
systems and offering packaging-
free products.

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT AGAIN 2022 UPDATE

1.  2022 UPDATE OF

COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY

In February 2020, Greenpeace USA published a
comprehensive survey of plastic recycling in the U.S.
titled “Circular Claims Fall Flat.”23 The survey examined
plastic products accepted by the U.S.’s approximately
370 material recovery facilities (MRFs) and U.S. domestic
plastic reprocessing capacity to determine which plastic
products meet the legal definition of “recyclable” in the
U.S. In this 2022 update of that comprehensive survey,
U.S. MRFs and plastic processing facilities were again
assessed to determine which specific plastic products
meet this legal definition, or the EMF NPE Global
Commitment’s definition of recyclable.

1.1    U.S. LEGAL DEFINITION

OF RECYCLABLE

To legitimately claim a product as “recyclable,” the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that
recycling facilities be available to a “substantial
majority” of U.S. residents, defined to be at least
60%, and that the collected product be used in the
manufacturing or assembly of a new item.24 The FTC
focuses on “established” and community-based
recycling systems, rather than privately operated
mail-back or retail store take-back programs, in
determining recycling availability.25

But acceptance of a plastic item at a MRF alone
does not provide a sufficient or “reasonable” assurance

to a customer that it will be manufactured into another
item. Sufficient market demand and domestic recycling/
reprocessing capacity must exist for a plastic product
to be considered “recyclable.” Without market demand
and domestic recycling/reprocessing capacity, the
plastic material collected by the MRFs will not be bought
by manufacturers and will not be recycled into another
product. According to the FTC, “unqualified recyclable
claims for categories of products that municipal recycling
programs collect, but do not actually recycle, may be
deceptive. To make a non-deceptive unqualified claim, a
marketer should substantiate that a substantial majority
of consumers or communities have access to facilities that
will actually recycle, not accept and ultimately discard,
the product. As part of this analysis, a marketer should
not assume that consumers or communities have access
to a particular recycling program merely because the
program will accept a product.”26

1.2    NEW PLASTICS ECONOMY
DEFINITION OF RECYCLABLE

Figure 1 shows that the EMF NPE Global Commitment
definition of “recyclable” requires an item to have
a 30% recycling capacity in a region of 400 million
people.27 However, companies are not required to use
that definition when self-reporting recyclability rates
of their product portfolios.28

7

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT AGAIN 2022 UPDATEFIGURE 1: EMF GLOBAL COMMITMENT DEFINITION OF RECYCLABLE29

HOW ARE RECYCLABILITY AND COMPOSTABILITY
ASSESSED IN THE GLOBAL COMMITMENT?
The definitions used by Global Commitment signatories to assess the
proportion of recyclable or compostable packaging in their portfolios are
more stringent than most other definitions.

The commitment to 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable plastic
packaging by 2025 is based on definitions that ask signatories to go beyond
designing packaging for the technical possibility of recycling or composting, and
requires that recycling or composting is proven to work ‘in practice and at scale’
for any given packaging design. The threshold to prove recycling or composting
works ‘in practice and at scale’ is a 30% recycling/composting rate achieved
across multiple regions, collectively representing at least 400 million inhabitants.
To support reporting on recyclability, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation has for
the last two years conducted a global survey of organisations with expertise on
recycling rates with the aim of filling gaps in data required to provide evidence of
where these thresholds are being met.

1.3   2022 COMPREHENSIVE

SURVEY RESULTS

The results of the 2020 survey indicated that only
certain types of PET#1 and HDPE#2 plastic bottles and
jugs met the legal definition of recyclable, and that
most types of plastic packaging were economically
impossible to recycle then and would remain so in
the foreseeable future. This 2022 update shows little
change: only PET#1 and HDPE#2 plastic bottles and jugs
are widely accepted by MRFs, and U.S. reprocessing
capacity for those items remains marginal at 20.9%
for PET#1 and 10.3% for HDPE#2 – well below the 30%
threshold set by the EMF NPE for determining whether
a plastic product is recyclable in a region. In short, no
type of plastic in the U.S. meets the EMF NPE definition
of “recyclable.” The results of this nationwide survey are
consistent with the 2021 California Statewide Recycling
Commission’s determination that only PET#1 and
HDPE#2 bottles and jugs are recyclable in California.30
The 2022 comprehensive survey assessed the

following, across the U.S.:31

1.  Collection and sortation (MRF) facilities: The

contents of the publicly posted lists of specific types
of plastic products accepted in the curbside recycling
bins of the 375 operating U.S. residential MRFs were
surveyed. (Details provided in Appendix A – 2022
Survey of U.S. Material Recovery Facilities.)

2.  Plastic waste reprocessing facilities: The

reprocessing capacity of the facilities that turn the
collected/sorted material into plastic resin was
assessed to determine the total U.S. processing
capacity of specific types of post-consumer
plastics. (Details provided in Appendix B – 2022
Survey of U.S. Recycling/Reprocessing Capacity for
Post-Consumer Plastic Waste.)

Table 1 summarizes the 2020 and 2022 survey
results and provides an assessment of whether
each product listed can legitimately be labeled as
“recyclable” according to the requirements of the FTC
Green Guides or the EMF NPE definition. The columns
are described in detail in the footnotes to the table.

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT AGAIN 2022 UPDATE

The 2022 survey results are consistent with the findings

of a May 2022 report by The Last Beach Cleanup and
Beyond Plastics, which estimated a dismal recycling rate of
5–6% for post-consumer plastic waste in the U.S. in 2021.34
They can be summarized as follows.

PET#1 and HDPE#2 Bottles and Jugs: The 2022 U.S. MRF

Survey showed that these items are accepted by nearly
100% of MRFs. Based on up-to-date estimates by The
Recycling Partnership (described in Appendix A.3), 60% of
the total U.S. population has access to curbside and drop-
off recycling service of some type. It is assumed that drop-
off recycling centers also accept PET#1 and HDPE#2 bottles
and jugs. Therefore, it is assumed that the 60% acceptance
rate required by the FTC is met for these items.

Polypropylene (PP#5) Tubs and Containers: The 2022
U.S. MRF Survey showed that these items are accepted by
52% of U.S. MRFs. Based on up-to-date estimates of access
to curbside and drop-off recycling, described in Appendix
A.3, only 29% of the total U.S. population has access to
collection of PP#5 tubs and containers.

As described by the Wall Street Journal in August 2022,
it is critical to acknowledge that the acceptance of a PP#5
tub by a MRF is not proof that the PP#5 tub will actually
be recycled into a new product.35 When a MRF accepts it,
PP#5 is typically collected as part of a mixed plastics #3-7
bale, which is not a “market-ready” bale as required by
the Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) in its definition of
“recyclable” plastic.36 The plastics industry acknowledges
that individually most plastics #3-7 “are not available in

the quantities necessary to justify investments in optical
sorting and are difficult to sort manually due to a variety
of resins used for a wide range of similar applications (i.e.,
creating ‘look-a-like’ materials and products). Therefore,
most MRFs that accept PP#5 produce a mixed plastic, ‘#3-
7’ or ‘pre-picked’ bale that requires further sorting prior
to recycling.”37 However, the economics of that sorting
have proven to be insurmountable. The last remaining U.S.
secondary plastic recycling facility that sorted mixed #3-7
plastics from MRFs, Titus Company in Los Angeles, closed
operations in 2020.38 As detailed in the 2020 “Circular
Claims Fall Flat” report, it appears that MRFs are still
accepting PP#5 tubs in curbside recycling bins and then
disposing of them.39 Examples include a California MRF
that accepts PP#5 tubs and disposes of them40 and the
City of Knoxville, Tennessee, which publicly states that its
recycling facility accepts plastics #3-7 but disposes of
them because “there is no end-market buyer.”41

Compounding the problem of recycling post-consumer

PP#5 plastic items is that there are a limited number of
plastic reprocessing facilities that will buy post-consumer
PP#5 plastic. Analysis in Appendix A.2 shows that there
is less than 2% U.S. domestic reprocessing capacity for
PP#5 post-consumer waste. The facilities are primarily in
the South and East U.S., with the largest U.S. processor of
PP#5 located in Alabama; however, the polypropylene
recycling capacity of that recycler is only 100 million lbs
per year, which is less than 1% of the total U.S. PP#5 plastic
waste produced.42 The cost to transport PP#5 waste from

10

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT AGAIN 2022 UPDATE© Made Nagi / Greenpeace

the West Coast is prohibitively high, which is a driving factor
of lack of acceptance of PP#5 at California MRFs and thus
to the 2021 California Statewide Recycling Commission’s
determination that PP#5 is not recyclable in the state.43
It is technically very difficult to safely recycle PP#5
waste into food-grade plastic due to toxicity and other
barriers.44 As plastic recycling expert Edward Kosior
stated in October 2020, “While food-grade PP will
claim to be recyclable, the fact is that to date there is
no food-grade recycled PP available for re-use into
new packaging – as a consequence, we still produce
virgin PP for all food-grade requirements.”45 In 2022,
the situation has not changed: food-grade PP#5 is not
commercially produced from PP#5 post-consumer
household plastic waste anywhere in the world.46
Indeed, the economics of collecting, sorting,

and recycling post-consumer polypropylene
products are becoming even more stressed and
do not provide a sufficient driver for MRFs to invest
in collection or separation of PP#5 post-consumer
products from mixed plastics #3-7 bales. Recycled
PP#5 competes with new PP#5, which is declining
in cost, with the trend likely to continue thanks to 2
billion lbs of new PP#5 production starting in North
America in 2022 and strong gasoline demand.47 The
feedstock for the production of PP#5 is a byproduct
of gasoline refineries, and the cost of the new PP#5
is largely driven by U.S. demand for gasoline, which
has increased in the economic recovery after the

peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, causing propylene
inventories to rise and prices to fall.48

Chemical industry analysts Wood Mackenzie predict a

downturn in the global polypropylene market with severe
short-term overcapacity during the current investment
cycle (2022 to 2026) as new additions in the market will far
outpace demand growth.49

Thermoforms (pods, clamshells, cups, trays, lids

and caps, and other rigid, non-bottle packaging):
Thermoforms are heat-molded plastic packaging and
products that may be made from plastics #1-7. They
have very low acceptance rates by MRFs and very
low to negligible recycling rates, according to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).50 As stated by
the president of the APR, MRFs have limited incentives
to separate out thermoforms, which are viewed as “a
relatively low-volume commodity that doesn’t justify the
sorting costs and bunker space.”51
Single-Use Plastic Food Service Items: The 2022 U.S. MRF
Survey confirmed the finding of the 2020 survey that no
type of single-use plastic food service item (such as those
used at fast food restaurants) can legally be claimed as
recyclable in the U.S., as shown in Figure 2. As the “2021
Fast Food Plastic Survey” performed by The Last Beach
Cleanup revealed, fast food companies serve many types

UNRECYCLABLE PLASTIC PACKAGING
CLAIMED AS “RECYCLABLE” BY U.S.
PLASTICS PACT

In the U.S. Plastics Pact’s “2020 Baseline Report,”53
numerous types of plastic packaging are claimed as
“recyclable” that fail to meet either the U.S. FTC or EMF
NPE Global Commitment definitions of “recyclable.”
These examples are highlighted in the U.S. Plastics Pact
Case Studies and shown in Figure 4:

#2: PE insulated box liners are not recyclable in the
U.S. Consumers have no access to established
recycling systems that collect them, and there are no
manufacturers known to be recycling the liners into
new products. If consumers place items with PE liners in
curbside recycling bins, the flat liners are most likely to
contaminate paper or cardboard bales.

#3: PE flexible film is not recyclable in the U.S. Less

than 1% of U.S. residents have access to established
recycling systems that accept plastic films. According
to a lawsuit contesting the sale of plastic bags in
California, no evidence has been found of this type of
post-consumer household plastic film being recycled
into new products via store drop-off programs,
either.54

#4: Polyester flexible plastic is not recyclable in the U.S.
Consumers have no access to established recycling
systems that accept plastic polyesters, and no
evidence was found that this type of post-consumer
household plastic waste is recycled into new products.

FIGURE 4: U.S. PLASTICS PACT CASE STUDIES INCLUDING NON-RECYCLABLE PLASTIC PACKAGING EXAMPLES

U.S. PACT CASE STUDIES

1.   To eliminate single-use packaging in Walmart’s
InHome Grocery Delivery Program, Returnity
custom designed a durable reusable bag and the
collection and cleaning system that increased
performance through tech integration and an
enhanced customer experience.

2.   To reduce packaging waste in meal kits, especially
insulated box liners made of multi-laminated
materials, PAC Worldwide designed PE insulated box
liners that are fully recyclable.

3.   Amcor’s AmPrimaTM PE Plus solutions employ a variety
of technologies, including proprietary techniques to
deliver unmatched levels of stiffness, clarity, graphics
performance, heat resistance, and run speeds in a
recycle-ready PE-based solution for flexible firms.

4.   Evertis partnered with a supplier to switch to

ECOSEAL film, which replaced the PE layer with a
specialty polyester that offers enhanced sealing
capabilities, creating a monomaterial film that is
100% recyclable in the PET stream.

Palmolive Company redesigned and chose HDPE,
the “No. 2” plastic used to make milk jugs and other
plastic bottles. Colgate-Palmolive also shared its
recyclable tube design with the broader industry.

6.   The Clorox Company worked with Algramo to
minimize plastic waste while providing flagship
Clorox products that are affordable, accessible and
convenient. Algramo’s refill system allows customers
to purchase how much product they need, when they
need it, based on what they can afford.

7.   Since its launch in 1959, The Coca-Cola Company’s
Sprite has always sported a signature green bottle.
But in 2022, the entire Sprite PET portfolio will evolve
from its iconic green color packaging to clear PET
to optimize the package for recycling, and in turn,
increase rPET supply.

8.   PakTech chose 100% recycled and recyclable

HDPE as the preferred material for its sustainable
packaging handles. PakTech has also partnered with
more than 500 businesses to establish dedicated
recycling sites so the handles can be turned into park
benches, planter pots and new PakTech products.

THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY UNPACKEDFIVE REASONS
WHY PLASTIC
RECYCLING FAILS

The plastics, packaging, and recycling industries have
waged a decades-long misinformation campaign to
perpetuate the myth that plastic is recyclable.55 In its 2016
treatise on “Rethinking the Future of Plastics,” the Ellen
MacArthur Foundation acknowledges the many barriers
to plastic recycling, but then quickly dismisses them with
the proclamation that a global effort called the New
Plastics Economy will succeed where “fragmented” and
“small-scale” efforts have failed (see Figure 5).56 This and
subsequent EMF reports expand on the contrived premise
of the circular economy of plastics and imagine benefits
built on the fiction that plastic recycling will someday work,
thanks to the implementation of a “global plastics protocol”
and “large-scale, targeted ‘moon shot’ innovations.”57

FIGURE 5 – ELLEN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION
PROCLAMATION THAT A GLOBAL NEW PLASTICS
ECONOMY WILL OVERCOME DECADES OF PLASTIC
RECYCLING FAILURE

Through overcoming these
drawbacks, an opportunity beckons:
moving the plastics industry into a
positive spiral of value capture, stronger
economics, and better environmental
outcomes. Actors across the plastic
packaging value chain have proven
time and again their capacity to
innovate. Now, harnessing this capability
to improve the circularity of plastic
packaging – while continuing to expand
its functionality and reduce its cost –
could create a new engine to move
towards a system that works: a New
Plastics Economy.

U.S. households reportedly generated an

estimated 51 million tons of plastic waste in 2021, 2.4
tons of which was recycled.58 In an effort to boost
demand for recycled plastic, the APR launched a
Recycling Demand Champion Campaign in the U.S. in
2017;59 it continues to tout the program as a success
even though demand from participants dropped
from 175 million lbs/year in 202060 to 138.7 million lbs/
year in 202161 – an amount that represents only 0.14%
of the total plastic waste generated in the U.S. that
year. This is not the sort of “moon shot” needed to
truly make a difference.

Even when faced with legal jeopardy, the

petrochemical companies that make plastic continue
to assert that plastic recycling will someday work. On
April 28, 2022, California Attorney General Rob Bonta
announced that a subpoena had been issued to
ExxonMobil to determine whether the fossil fuel giant
had lied to the public about both the negative effects
of plastics and the success of plastic recycling.62 The
ACC,63 the leading petrochemical business association
and ExxonMobil64 responded by promoting another
old myth about plastic recycling, claiming that they are
committed to “advanced recycling” technology that will
work in the future.

However, the primary advanced recycling process,

called “pyrolysis,” actually incinerates plastic waste
to fuel itself to high temperatures and recycles only a
small portion of the waste.65 In effect, the majority of
the plastic waste involved in this process is burned.
The document filed with the U.S. EPA by Brightmark
Energy regarding its planned pyrolysis plant in Ashley,
Indiana, for example, reportedly states that 70% of
the feedstock would be combusted and 10% would be
waste char, meaning that only 20% of the feedstock
material would be reclaimed as pyrolysis oil (which still
requires further refinement).66

Indeed, advanced recycling has long been
recognized as a failure. Figure 6 shows a 1993 article
from the Lincoln Star Journal where a plastic recycler
states that the American Plastics Council is hindering true
plastic recycling efforts by promoting pyrolysis, which is
described as “a form of incineration, not recycling.”67

Plastic manufacturers accused

GRAND ISLAND (AP) – Plastic
manufacturers  are  not  living  up  to
their claim that they want to promote
recycling of their product, according
to an advocate of recycling.

Instead  of  promoting  plastic
recycling,  manufacturers  spend

said

Association Convention.

As recently as six years ago, he
said less than 1 percent of plastic was
being recycled in the United States.

He  noted  that  60  billion  pounds  of
plastic  are  sold  each  year,  with  59
billion pounds thrown away.

Forman said the American Plastic
Council  is  spending  more  than  $30
million this year but less than 1 percent
is spent on recycling efforts.

However,  $30  million  will  go  to
advertising that tells people to “take
another look at plastic,” he said.

One

lobbying  effort

that

hinders  recycling  encourages  a
process  called  Pyrolysis,  which
Forman  described  as  a  form  of
incineration, not recycling.

“Burning  up  resources  is  not

recycling,” he said.

Forman  said  there  are  some
legitimate  recycling  efforts  such
as  automated  sorting  of  plastics.
However,
these  early  efforts
have  been  abandoned  in  favor
of  Pyrolysis  by  the  American
Plastics Council, he said.

Forman  said  only  soda  bottles
and milk jugs are being recycled to
any  significant  extent.  Almost  all
other plastic is discarded.

Plastics companies are now apparently recycling false
promises made 30 years ago about the use of chemical
recycling methods to recycle plastics.

For example, Figure 7 shows an excerpt of the
1991 congressional testimony by Eastman Chemical
Company where it announced plans to “close the
loop” by producing PET with recycled content for
food packaging, including plastic soft drink bottles.
The company stated that it would “use Eastman
Kodak’s existing methanolysis unit in Rochester, NY, to

convert recycled PET into its raw materials. These will
be blended with virgin feedstock at Carolina Eastman
Company.”68 According to company officials, Eastman
planned to produce about 50 million lbs of recycled
plastic per year – enough to manufacture about 500
million soda bottles annually.69

Greenpeace USA and The Last Beach Clean Up were

unable to find any evidence that a PET bottle recycling
facility was ever operated at Eastman Kodak’s Rochester,
NY, facility, and the facility was fully shut down in 2012.70

In 2019, Eastman again announced plans to build a
PET#1 methanolysis plant.71 As of July 2022 the plant was
still under construction and had not yet started up or
proven to be commercially viable.72

Mechanical recycling techniques have proven
insufficient, failing to raise the percentage of plastic
waste that is recycled in the U.S. over 10%73 – so the
plastics industry continues to try to fool the public and
legislators with the promise of “moonshot” technologies
that always seem to be 10 years away from commercial
use.74 A representative of Chevron Phillips Chemicals
likened the commercialization of chemical recycling to
“going to Mars.”75

In reality, so-called advanced or chemical recycling is

not technically, environmentally, or economically viable.
It has failed and will continue to fail for the same down-
to-earth, real-world reasons that mechanical recycling
of plastics has failed. And, as described in reports by
Greenpeace USA,76 the Global Alliance for Incinerator
Alternatives (GAIA),77 and the Natural Resources Defense
Council (NRDC),78 toxic emissions from chemical recycling
could cause new environmental and health harms.

Mechanical and chemical recycling of plastic waste has
largely failed and will likely always fail because plastic waste
is: (1) extremely difficult to collect, (2) virtually impossible to
sort for recycling, (3) environmentally harmful to reprocess,
(4) made of and contaminated by toxic materials, and (5)
not economical to recycle. Paper, cardboard, metal, and
glass largely do not have these problems, which is why they
are actually recycled at high rates.79

These challenges are recognized by plastic producers.
Amcor – one of the world’s largest packaging companies,
which produces packaging from a range of materials –
has reportedly acknowledged that recycling of plastic
packaging is extremely limited, whereas the big mainstream
paper, metal, and glass suppliers are already using a larger
percentage of recycled materials. Those industries typically
also have roadmaps to meet zero-emissions goals by 2050,
unlike the plastics industry, which Amcor describes as “the
only industry that [still] has these little artisanal recyclers
making the recycled content we’re trying to find.”80

REASON 1:
PLASTIC WASTE IS EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT TO COLLECT
Single-use plastics can be thought of as trillions of pieces
of plastic confetti spewed from retail and fast food stores
to over 330 million U.S. residents across more than 3 million
square miles (not counting Alaska and Hawaii) each year.
It’s simply not possible to collect the vast quantity of small
pieces of plastic sold to U.S. consumers annually.

The plastic, products, and recycling industries
themselves admit that the collection of plastic waste
from consumers is a major barrier to increasing plastic
recycling rates. In response to a California lawsuit alleging
that plastic bags are not recyclable because they are
not collected and recycled,81 the APR reportedly allowed
that collection was a major barrier, stating: “Reusable
plastic bags are recyclable. The issue is simply that they
are difficult to channel back to recyclers.”82 The APR
further blames lack of collection for the overall low plastic
recycling rates in the U.S. (approximately 5% in 202183),
stating that recyclers “can only recycle what’s made
available to them”84 and claiming that “The biggest issue
is that our collection infrastructure is based on 1970s and
1980s technology. Our infrastructure is woefully lacking and
woefully behind the packaging stream that we have today.
Plastic recyclers operate at about 60% capacity today.
We can recycle a lot more material. We can’t get it. We can
recycle anything if it’s collected and sorted properly.”85
Under the guise of “infrastructure,” the APR calls for more
public investment in plastic collection – which actually
means more trucks on U.S. highways, because actual
physical conveyance infrastructure (pipelines and electrical
wires) is not used to transport waste.86

Ironically, volunteer cleanup stunts, often funded
by the plastics industry, also prove the impossibility of
systematically collecting the trillions of pieces of plastic
waste produced every year. Keep America Beautiful
(KAB), a non-profit organization that is infamous for its
greenwashing and advertisements from the 1970s,87 is
funded by plastics and fast food companies like Dow and
McDonald’s.88 For decades, KAB led volunteer cleanups
to collect plastic pollution. While KAB and sponsors
celebrate collecting bags of plastic waste, the continual
need for cleanups demonstrates that collection and
recycling programs are not keeping plastic waste out of
the environment. Tennessee’s Chattanooga River, still filled
with plastic pollution despite continual cleanups, is a stark
reminder that volunteer cleanup efforts cannot keep up
with the flow of new plastic waste into the environment.89
In response to continuing low plastic recycling rates, The
Recycling Partnership, which is funded by the plastics and
products industries,90 called for massive investment in its
2021 “Paying It Forward” report.91 U.S. residents currently
pay about $4.2 to $5.9 billion/year for the collection of
recycling materials from curbside bins, with these services
chiefly financed through local taxation.92 On top of that,
The Recycling Partnership called for a $17 billion investment
over five years, with $1.2 billion provided each year for
“education and outreach strategies to improve recycling
behavior.”93 The $17 billion also includes a one-time
investment of $4 billion to create a recycling system for
unrecyclable plastic film waste.

While The Recycling Partnership claims that lack of
curbside recycling bins and collection is the main reason
for low recycling rates,94 California’s low plastic recycling
rate suggests that isn’t true. Curbside residential recycling
has effectively been mandatory in California since 1989,
when the California Integrated Waste Management Act (AB
939) made all California cities and counties implement solid
waste diversion plans, which required curbside recycling
collection to achieve.95 Still, in 2021, the California Statewide
Recycling Commission determined that only PET#1 and
HDPE#2 bottles and jugs are recyclable in California.96 This
suggests that lack of access to curbside recycling is not
the main cause of low plastic recycling rates or limited
acceptance of plastic items for recycling.

REASON  2:
MIXED PLASTIC WASTE CANNOT
BE RECYCLED TOGETHER
Spending billions of consumer and taxpayer dollars to
increase collection could be a waste of money. Even if it
were all collected, mixed plastic waste cannot be recycled
together, and it would be functionally impossible to sort the
trillions of pieces of consumer plastic waste produced each
year into separate types to be reprocessed.

Plastics Recyclers Europe, an organization representing

plastics recyclers, reportedly observed in June 2022 that

© Greenpeace

“a lack of sorted plastics is undermining the businesses
of European recyclate producers and the shortage is
negatively impacting the operations of plastics recyclers
across Europe.”97 Yet, as a representative of a major
Californian recycling company was quoted as stating
earlier in the year, “There’s just so many types of plastic. We
can’t recycle them all. We can’t manage them all. You can’t
recycle your way out of the larger plastic problem.”98

There are thousands of different plastics, each with

its own composition and characteristics.99 Different
plastics have different melting points, dyes, and colorants.
Different types of chemical additives give plastics specific
characteristics, such as flexibility or rigidity.100 Polyethylene
terephthalate (PET#1) bottles are made by blow-molding
and cannot be recycled with PET#1 cups, trays, or
clamshells, which are made by thermoforming and are a
different PET#1 material.101 Green PET#1 bottles cannot be
recycled with clear PET#1 bottles.102 To combat this issue, all
beverage companies operating in Japan have voluntarily
used only clear PET#1 since 1992,103 and South Korea
banned colored PET#1 in 2020.104 Other types of plastics,
including high-density polyethylene (HDPE#2), polyvinyl
chloride (PVC#3), low-density polyethylene (LDPE#4),
polypropylene (PP#5), and polystyrene (PS#6), all must be
separated for recycling.105

Sorting plastics can also waste plastics. The Recycling
Partnership admits that “in today’s system, upwards of 15%
of all the PET bottles that enter a MRF never come out the

19

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT AGAIN 2022 UPDATEother side,” meaning that they are not properly sorted into
PET bales but are disposed of in the MRF contamination
stream.106 Colored PET#1 bottles have negligible market
demand and are a serious source of contamination in
PET#1 bottle bales. Indeed, a 2019 study by the Plastic
Recycling Corporation of California (PRCC) determined
that colored PET#1 bottles cause valuable clear PET bottles
to be inadvertently disposed of. The PRCC stated: “During
the bale analysis, project leaders saw colored PET was one
of the areas where a lot of clear PET loss was occurring.
That’s because colored PET makes up a high percentage of
what’s removed from the bales, so more clear PET escapes
with colored PET than with other contaminants.”107

Since 1994, when the U.S. DOE published its final
report on waste plastic recycling, it’s been known that
no type of chemical recycling can successfully process
mixed plastic waste from households.108 The most
common pyrolysis process requires a consistent amount
of good quality feedstock (without any PET#1 or PVC#3)
to function effectively,109 but household plastic waste
contains significant amounts of PET#1 bottles, clamshells,
cups, and some PVC#3 packaging that looks just like
PP#5 and HDPE#2 plastic.

Starting in 2018, the Renewlogy pyrolysis plant in Salt

Lake City, Utah, was heavily promoted by Dow110 and
the ACC111 as able to reprocess mixed plastic waste from
Boise, Idaho, households through the Hefty EnergyBag
program112 and turn it into diesel fuel. But, as exposed in a
2021 Reuters investigation, the project was halted within
a year due to contamination of the pyrolysis process.113
Instead of being recycled, the mixed plastic waste
collected by Boise is now burned in cement kilns, with
significant carbon emissions.

Even though chemical recycling failed at the heavily
touted Renewlogy plant, that failure has not stopped the
plastics industry from continuing to make baseless and
exaggerated claims, such as “Even mixed plastics and
plastics with food residue can now be remade into new
plastics approved for food, pharmaceutical, and medical
use – through advanced recycling.”114

industry.119 Importantly, there’s no proof that plastic waste
from households is being reprocessed at these facilities.
In fact, the Nexus pyrolysis plant in Georgia has admitted
that it can’t process much mixed household plastic waste
and primarily uses “post-commercial and post-industrial”
plastic film waste.120 Recycling industrial and commercial
plastic film, however, doesn’t reduce the over 3.2 million
trash trucks per year of U.S. consumer plastic waste going
from fast food restaurants and households to landfills or
incinerators, or ending up as plastic pollution.121

Fortunately, the Mayor of Macon, Georgia, did not

automatically accept the claims made by Brightmark Energy
when the company recently sought $500 million in public
bonds to build a pyrolysis plant in Macon.122 The city wisely
required Brightmark to prove that its first plant, constructed
in Ashley, Indiana,123 was operating as promised. Since
the Ashley plant had not started commercial operation,
Brightmark Energy could not prove performance and the
proposed Macon project was halted.124

REASON 3:
PLASTIC RECYCLING IS WASTEFUL,
POLLUTING, AND A FIRE HAZARD
If all plastic waste is somehow collected and sorted, then
the reprocessing of plastic waste itself makes plastic
waste. In their announcement about construction of a new
PET#1 bottle recycling facility in Mexico, Coca-Cola and
ALPLA state that 30% of plastic PET#1 bottles received
will be wasted.125 This is consistent with the 2018 National
Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR) report
on PET#1 beverage bottle recycling, which stated that due
to contamination and process losses about a third of the
collected bottle material is disposed of.126

Microplastics are generated in mechanical

recycling and are removed by washing operations. The
microplastics are discharged to the environment via
either untreated wastewater or wastewater treatment
plant sludge streams.127

Amcor, however, disagrees with the plastics industry’s

Recycling plastic has also been shown to be toxic to

claim that mixed plastics can be chemically recycled,
stating on its website that “There is often a misconception
that with chemical recycling it will be possible to throw
anything in and get virgin quality resin back. That may work
in theory but it’s unlikely in the real world.”115

According to a 2022 report by the NRDC116 and a recent

statement by the ACC’s VP of Plastics,117 there are only a
handful of chemical recycling facilities operating in the
U.S. today. Greenpeace USA estimates the total capacity
of the operating facilities to be about 121,600 tons/year –
which is only 0.24% of the 51 million tons of plastic waste
generated by U.S. households each year.118 That’s hardly
the “massive wave of projects” claimed by the plastics

workers. Researchers at Leeds University in the United
Kingdom performed a review of over 4,000 sources
of information to evaluate the risks of (1) toxics in
recycled plastics and (2) toxic exposure to workers and
communities in plastic recycling operations.128 Workers
were found to be exposed to toxics in mechanical plastic
recycling operations.

As reported by Canada’s National Observer in 2021,

“Most plastic products contain toxic chemicals added
to give plastic desirable traits, like flexibility or non-stick
properties. When they are broken down during recycling
or incineration, these toxins – everything from endocrine
disrupters to cancer-causing chemicals – can escape

20

recycling facilities and landfills to contaminate people and
the environment.”129

Residents who live near U.S. plastic recycling facilities

report plastic pollution spewing from the recycling
plants and onto their property, including a resident
of Lowell, Arkansas, who found pieces of plastic film
and plastic dust covering her children’s backyard
playground equipment in May 2022.130 As the KFSM
news film report shows, a nearby plastic film recycling
plant grinding plastic waste to be made into “green”
decking was the cause of the plastic pollution.

Plastic is highly flammable, so plastic recycling can
be dangerous to neighboring communities due to the
risk of fires at the recycling facilities, which can release
toxins into the air. For example, in August 2022, 39
neighbors of a plastic recycling facility in Dallas, Texas,
filed a class action lawsuit against Poly America for
toxic health impacts from a fire that burned for 23 hours
in August 2020.131 A map of the many fires at plastic
recycling facilities in the U.S. and world is shown on The
Last Beach Cleanup’s website.132

REASON 4:
RECYCLED PLASTIC OFTEN
HAS HUGE TOXICITY RISKS
Plastics are not inert like metal and glass. Plastic products
themselves may contain toxic additives or absorb
chemicals, and these products are generally collected in
curbside bins that may be filled with problem materials
like plastic containers used to store pesticides or motor
oil.133 According to a report published in late 2021 by
the Canadian Government, toxicity risks in recycled
plastic prohibit “the vast majority of plastic products
and packaging produced” from being recycled into
food-grade packaging.134 This means that the billions

of pounds per year of plastic used for food service
packaging cannot be safely recycled back into food
service packaging, leaving only two remaining options:
downcycling the plastic waste into lower-value products
or disposing of it via landfill or incineration.

REASON 5:
PLASTIC RECYCLING
IS NOT ECONOMICAL
It has always been exorbitantly expensive to collect, sort,
truck, and safely reprocess plastic waste. The significant
jump in diesel prices in 2022 is making the cost of trucking
plastic waste even greater; in May 2022 a Midwest recycler
stated that trucking plastic waste to Canada was “two-to-
three times more expensive than it was six months ago.”135
New plastic directly competes with recycled plastic, and
it’s far cheaper to produce136 and of higher quality – and
the petrochemical industry is rapidly expanding, which is
lowering the cost of new plastic even further.

The basic economic premise of the “circular economy
of plastics” is false. The Ellen McArthur Foundation claimed
in 2016 that “After a short first-use cycle, 95% of plastic
packaging material value, or USD 80–120 billion annually,
is lost to the economy.”137 But they produced this estimation
by simply multiplying the price of new plastic by the amount
of plastic waste generated per year. This is like equating the
value of old shoes to the cost of a new pair of shoes. In fact,
mixed plastic waste has zero to negative value because
there is a disposal cost to get rid of it.138

Since new plastic is cheaper and higher quality than

recycled plastic, product companies will continue to
buy new plastic instead. At the fifth session of the UN
Environment Assembly in early 2022, Unilever admitted that
it wouldn’t increase its use of recycled plastic if the price
was much higher than that of new plastic.139

3. THE WORLD IS
AT A DECISION
POINT ON
SINGLE-USE
PLASTICS AND
PACKAGING

As scientific evidence of the harm caused by plastic pollution
and the toxic risks of recycled plastic continues to mount,

discussions about what to do about single-use plastics
are underway at the global level through UNEP plastics
treaty,140 in the U.S. Congress and city halls and state
capitals across the country, as well as in corporate board
rooms.

After more than 30 years, it is time to accept that
plastic recycling is a failed concept. Unlike with paper or
metals, there are two insurmountable barriers that prevent
plastic recycling from ever working at scale: toxicity and
economics. Plastic cannot be safely recycled from post-
consumer household waste back into new food-grade
plastic products. The flood of 400 million tons/year of
cheap new plastic production141 kills the business case
for large-scale investment in plastic recycling. And the
problem lies not with the concept or process of recycling
but with the plastic material itself – it is plastic recycling that
does not work.142

Greenpeace believes that companies must take action
now to eliminate single-use plastics and packaging and not
rely on false solutions such as recycling (advanced, chemical,
or otherwise), recycled content, and material substitution.
Viable alternatives to single-use plastics and packaging,
such as reuse and refill systems, exist and need to be rapidly
scaled up and invested in by the world’s biggest plastic
polluters. These companies can no longer use recycling as a
smokescreen to divert attention from the systemic changes
that are needed.
GREENPEACE IS CALLING
ON COMPANIES TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING
STEPS:

•  Urgently move to reuse systems and

packaging-free approaches. Set targets to
have at least 50% reusable packaging by 2030.
Note: Sectors for which a switch to reuse is
comparatively easy – such as soft drinks, mineral
water, alcoholic beverages, and coffee chains –
should set more ambitious targets.

•  Commit to collaborating with others to

standardize reusable packaging and build shared
reuse systems and infrastructure.

•  Phase out all single-use plastics (packaging and
products),143 not just “virgin” or “new” plastic.

•  Be transparent. Annually release verified data about

your company’s single-use packaging footprint, including
single-use packaging reduction rates and reusable

25

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT AGAIN 2022 UPDATEpackaging uptake. Disclose where plastic used
originates and report on the full lifetime climate footprint
of packaging production, use, and disposal.

•  Advocate for political action to drive industry-wide
transformation. Promote an ambitious global plastics
treaty that addresses the entire life cycle of plastic
products and emphasizes reduction. Support regional
and national legislation that promotes the slow circular
economy and extended producer responsibility, bans
single-use plastics, and fast-tracks reuse, refill, and
packaging-free systems.

APPENDIX A. 2022 SURVEY OF PLASTIC
WASTE COLLECTION/SORTATION AND
REPROCESSING: TECHNICAL APPROACH
AND
DETAILED RESULTS
To meet the threshold for the “recyclable” label, the
FTC Green Guides stipulate that at least 60% of the U.S.
population must have access to an established recycling
program that can collect or otherwise separate a product
from the waste stream and reuse it in manufacturing or
assembling another item.144 In this comprehensive survey,
the following were assessed:

1.  Collection and sortation (MRF) facilities: The

contents of the publicly posted lists of specific
types of plastic products accepted in the curbside
recycling bins of the 375 operating U.S. residential
MRFs were surveyed. (Details provided in Appendix
A.1 - Survey of U.S. Material Recovery Facilities.)

2. Plastic reprocessing facilities: The reprocessing
capacity of the facilities that turn the collected/
sorted material into plastic resin was assessed
to determine the total U.S. processing capacity
of specific types of post-consumer plastics.
(Details provided in Appendix A.2 - Survey of
U.S. Recycling/Reprocessing Capacity for Post-
Consumer Plastic Waste.)

3. Current U.S. access to established municipal

collection and sortation systems

A.1 2022 SURVEY OF U.S.
 MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES
A.1.1 SURVEY METHODOLOGY
AND PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY

The original comprehensive, objective survey of acceptance
of plastic items at U.S. residential MRFs for curbside
recycling has been continually updated since its creation
in October 2019 and was reverified in August 2022. The
survey was performed and verified by technically qualified
volunteers of The Last Beach Cleanup:145 two registered
professional chemical engineers and a recycling industry
expert. The technical experts involved have no financial
conflicts of interest related to legitimate recyclable labels
for plastic products that would influence the assessment or
results. The acceptance information was found in the public
domain and is publicly shared to promote transparency
and establish a traceable account of facts related to
“recyclable” claims and labels for plastic products. The
details of the survey were captured in a spreadsheet that is
publicly available on the Greenpeace USA website.
Survey of Plastic Item Acceptance: A “MRFshed”
approach was employed to survey the acceptance of
plastic items sent to recycling facilities by U.S. residents
who have access to curbside recycling. A MRFshed is
defined “as a group of communities that funnel material
into the same materials recycling facility (MRF).”146
Through web searches, each MRF was investigated for
the public disclosure of items accepted for curbside
recycling. About one-third of the MRFs provided
information on acceptance of plastic items at the facility.
When MRF acceptance information was not found,
a search of websites of local cities or counties that
direct recycling to a specific MRF was performed. If this
secondary approach revealed no information about
the MRF, recycling guidance provided by the MRF owner
(e.g., Republic Services’ Recycling Simplified147 guidelines
to customers) was captured. The acceptance guidance
provided by MRFs and local municipal governments
ranged from complicated “wizard” search tools to easily
understandable text and photos. Where there was
inconsistency between text and photo guidance, all items
listed or shown were considered accepted. This approach
was intentionally conservative to avoid bias.

information on the capacity of U.S. plastic recyclers/
reprocessors for specific types of post-consumer plastic
waste. Estimates of U.S. domestic post-consumer plastic
recycling/reprocessing capacity are made to determine
if sufficient capacity exists to assure customers that a
plastic product has a sufficient likelihood of actually
being recycled into a new product if it is accepted by
a MRF. The estimates are summarized in Table A-2 and

A.2.1 U.S. EPA 2018 PLASTIC RECYCLING RATES

Recycling rates for plastic items provide a basic indication
of recycling capacity because production rates are a
portion of production capacity. The most recent U.S. EPA
recycling rates published are for the year 2018 and are
shown in Appendix B and summarized in Table A-3.149 The
“recycled” material, totaling 3.09 million tons, includes
a significant amount of exported material: in 2018, 943
million kg (1.04 million tons) of U.S. plastic waste was
exported (not including to Canada).150 If the exported
plastic waste counted as “recycled” is deducted from the
total, then only 2.05 million tons, or 5.7% of the total U.S.
plastic waste generated, were recycled. The 2018 data for
“Total Recycled %” therefore provides a high estimate of
U.S. plastic waste reprocessing capacity, because exports
are included. Note that the EPA’s definition of “Containers
and Packaging” does not include plastic food service
items such as cups and plates.

A.2.2 2022 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING
CAPACITY FOR POST-CONSUMER POLYETHYLENE
TEREPHTHALATE (PET) PLASTIC #1 WASTE

A.2.3 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING
CAPACITY FOR POST-CONSUMER HIGH-DENSITY
POLYETHYLENE (HDPE) PLASTIC #2 WASTE

Available data indicates that the current U.S. domestic
reprocessing capacity for post-consumer PET plastic
waste is approximately 20.9% of the total post-consumer
PET plastic waste generated. This estimate is supported
by the 18.5% recycling rate reported by the U.S. EPA in
2018 and other evidence.
Evidence supporting this estimate:
1.   According to the most recent data published by the

APR, in 2020, the U.S. reclaimer capacity was nearly 2.4
billion lbs.151 NAPCOR previously reported that at the
end of 2017 there were 22 PET recycling/reprocessing
plants operating in the U.S., with a total annual
nameplate capacity of 2.3 billion lbs.152 However,
NAPCOR did not report the number of recyclers or
capacity in its 2018 report.153 Detailed NAPCOR reports
are no longer free and accessible to the public for
viewing, and the report’s cost of $4,000 is prohibitive
for access by non-industry stakeholders.154
2.   As shown in Table A-3, the U.S. produced 5.29

million tons (10.6 billion lbs) of PET waste in 2018.
Assuming a 4% annual growth factor through
2020,155 the figure for 2020 can be estimated at
approximately 11.5 billion lbs. The existing U.S.
domestic capacity for recycling/reprocessing PET
waste is therefore estimated to be about 20.9%
(2.4 billion lbs of reprocessing capacity for 11.5
billion lbs of waste produced).

Available data indicates that the current U.S. domestic
reprocessing capacity for post-consumer HDPE#2 plastic
waste is approximately 10.3% of the total post-consumer
HDPE#2 plastic waste generated. This estimate is
supported by the 8.9% recycling rate reported by the U.S.
EPA in 2018 (see Appendix B) and other evidence.
Evidence supporting this estimate:
1.   The APR reports a total U.S. HDPE#2 post-consumer
reclamation capacity of 1.3 billion lbs for 2019.156
2.   As shown in Table A-3, the U.S. produced 6.3 million

tons (12.6 billion lbs) of HDPE#2 waste in 2018.
Therefore, existing U.S. domestic capacity for
recycling/reprocessing HDPE#2 waste is estimated
to be about 10.3%.

A.2.4 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING
CAPACITY FOR POST-CONSUMER HIGH
POLYVINYL CHLORIDE (PVC) PLASTIC #3 WASTE

The U.S. EPA data in Table A-3 indicates that the current
U.S. domestic reprocessing capacity for post-consumer
PVC#3 plastic waste is negligible. When it is accepted
by a MRF, PVC#3 is typically collected as part of a mixed
plastics #3-7 bale. There is negligible demand for these
bales across the country. 157 As detailed by numerous
examples in Greenpeace’s 2020 “Circular Claims Fall Flat”
report, collected mixed plastics are often disposed of to
landfills or destroyed by incineration.158

28

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT AGAIN 2022 UPDATEA.2.5 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING
CAPACITY FOR POST-CONSUMER LOW-DENSITY
POLYETHYLENE (LDPE) PLASTIC #4 WASTE

The U.S. EPA data in Table A-3 indicates that the
current U.S. domestic reprocessing capacity for post-
consumer LDPE#4 plastic waste is less than 5%. When
it is accepted by a MRF, LDPE#4 is typically collected
as part of a mixed plastics #3-7 bale. There is negligible
demand for these bales across the country, and the
collected mixed plastics are often disposed of in
landfills or destroyed by incineration.

A.2.6 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING CAPACITY FOR POST-
CONSUMER POLYPROPYLENE #5 PLASTIC WASTE

Available data indicates that the current U.S. domestic
reprocessing capacity for post-consumer PP#5 plastic
waste is approximately 2–5%. This conservative estimate
is supported by the low (0.6%) recycling rate reported by
the U.S. EPA in 2018 (see Appendix B) and other evidence.
When it is accepted by a MRF, PP#5 is typically collected
as part of a mixed plastics #3-7 bale. There is negligible
demand for these bales across the country, and the
collected mixed plastics are often disposed of in landfills
or destroyed by incineration.
Evidence supporting this estimate:
1.   Polypropylene is reportedly “one of the least

recycled post-consumer plastics, at a rate below 1
percent for post-consumer recovery.”159

2.   KW Plastics (Alabama) is reported to be the largest
processor of U.S. post-consumer polypropylene
plastic waste; however, it only has the capacity
to process 100 million lbs/year of polypropylene
waste.160 As shown in Table A-3, the U.S. produced
8,150 million tons (16.3 billion lbs) of polypropylene

waste in 2018. Therefore, KW Plastics has the
capacity to process less than 1% of U.S. post-
consumer polypropylene plastic waste.
3.   Assuming that KW Plastics processes about

one-half of post-consumer polypropylene plastic
waste,161 the total current U.S. capacity to recycle/
reprocess polypropylene plastic waste is estimated
to be less than 2%.

A.2.7 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING
CAPACITY FOR POST-CONSUMER
POLYSTYRENE (PS) PLASTIC #6 WASTE

The U.S. EPA data in Table A-3 indicates that the
current U.S. domestic reprocessing capacity for post-
consumer PS #6 plastic waste is less than 1%. When it
is accepted by a MRF, plastic #6 is typically collected
as part of a mixed plastics #3-7 bale. There is negligible
demand for these bales across the country, and the
collected mixed plastics are often disposed of in
landfills or destroyed by incineration.

A.2.7 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING
CAPACITY FOR PLASTIC #7 WASTE

Plastic #7 waste includes multiple types of plastics
“other” than plastics #1-6, including bio-based
plastics such as polylactic acid (PLA) plastic. The U.S.
EPA data in Table A-3 indicates that the current U.S.
domestic reprocessing capacity for “other” plastic
waste is negligible. When it is accepted by a MRF,
plastic #7 is typically collected as part of a mixed
plastics #3-7 bale. There is negligible demand for
these bales across the country, and the collected
mixed plastics are often disposed of in landfills or
destroyed by incineration.

29

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT AGAIN 2022 UPDATEA.3 CURRENT U.S. ACCESS TO
MUNICIPAL COLLECTION AND
SORTATION
To legitimately claim a product as “recyclable,” the
FTC requires that recycling facilities be available to
a “substantial majority” of U.S. residents, defined
to be at least 60%. The FTC focuses on established
recycling systems, rather than privately operated
mail-back or retail store take-back programs, in
determining recycling availability.162

In its 2021 “Paying It Forward” report, The Recycling
Partnership estimated the access to various kinds of
recycling for U.S. households:163
•  Curbside recycling: 52%
