1. Introduction

Tuna is one of the world’s favourite fish. It provides a
critical part of the diet for millions of poor people, as
well as being at the core of the world’s luxury sashimi
markets. But global tuna stocks are under threat. Many
tuna species are now listed as either endangered or
critically endangered. In fact, global tuna stocks are
disappearing.

Stocks of the most iconic and valuable of all the tuna
species, the magnificent bluefin, are on the brink of
collapse. Those of other species, such as bigeye and
yellowfin, are fully or over-exploited in all oceans.

How did we get to this point?

It is not a complicated story. Over the last few decades the
world’s voracious appetite for tuna has spurred a surge in the
number and capacity of tuna-fishing vessels. Industrial tuna
fleets from Japan, the European Union (EU), Taiwan, Korea,
the US and increasingly China and the Philippines, fishing
far from their home ports, are squeezing the last remaining
financial benefits out of the planet’s tuna stocks. Even tuna
fisheries that were considered healthy just a few short years
ago, such as those of the Western Pacific Ocean, have joined
the global depletion trend.

Tuna are highly migratory. Over their life cycles they travel vast
distances, crossing the high seas and darting in and out of
the waters of many coastal States on their migratory routes to
breed and feed. To keep fishing year round, industrial tuna
fishing fleets must pursue these stocks and follow them into
the waters of coastal States. To do so legally they rely on
what is known as fisheries access agreements, often
negotiated on their behalf by their governments. Fisheries
access agreements are highly controversial. In their worst
manifestation they are a form of government extortion.
Powerful fishing nations use their financial clout to pressure
developing coastal States to exchange access to their fish
resources for cash payments or even aid. More often than not
these legal agreements lead to resource depletion for the
coastal State. This report is a detailed look at these access
arrangements as they relate to tuna. It examines how they are
used by powerful fishing nations to sustain their distant water
fleets. It also shows the impact this has on the economies
and natural resource sustainability of the coastal countries
which sell the access.

Taking Tuna out of the Can: Rescue Plan for the World’s Favourite Fish

There is no end in sight to the global demand for tuna or to
the pressure being brought to bear on developing coastal
States to provide foreign fleets with access to their fisheries
resources. While tuna access agreements are necessary and
in some cases the only viable current option for some coastal
States, it is unacceptable that these agreements lead to
resource depletion, unfavourable terms and impoverishment
for developing coastal States and a worsening situation for
the poor in these countries. This report offers strategies for
how coastal States faced with unsustainable agreements
might turn their situation around. It shows how coastal States
could increase their revenues from access agreements by
reducing and controlling access to their tuna. It provides
recommendations and principles for what could become fair
tuna fisheries agreements. These proposals are an attempt to
translate the rhetoric of sustainable development into
concrete steps that will maximise the chances of reversing the
global decline of tuna stocks, place the tuna fishery on a long-
term sustainable footing, and deliver a more equitable
outcome to coastal nations through the provision of local
economic opportunities within their communities.

Our Planet’s Rapidly Shrinking Tuna Stocks

There are five main commercially harvested tuna species:
skipjack, yellowfin, big eye, albacore and bluefin. The most
prolific in terms of catch volume is skipjack, a species
destined primarily for canning and fished mostly by industrial
seiners. In 2004, over two million metric tonnes of skipjack
were landed, about 55% of the world’s total combined
landed volume of all tuna species.1 The Western Central
Pacific Ocean (WCPO) and the Indian Ocean supply most of
the world’s skipjack2, the bulk (approximately 60% of the
world supply) coming from the WCPO. In turn most of the
WCPO’s skipjack comes from the waters of small island
states where it is fished primarily by distant water seine fleets
under access agreements.3

The second most important tuna species in volume terms –
35% of world catch – is yellowfin, a much more commercially
valuable species than skipjack. Although some yellowfin is
canned, most is destined for the higher value sashimi trade.
Albacore and big-eye, the latter a very valuable species for
sashimi, make up most of the rest of the world’s tuna catch.

Divided into Pacific, Atlantic and Southern stock groups the
majestic bluefin only represents 1.5 % of the world’s landed
volume of tuna but its dollar value is astronomical. In 2001,
a single bluefin weighing over 200kg set an all-time record
when it sold for $ 173,600 (US) at Tokyo’s main fish market.4

All Southern bluefin tuna, the Western Atlantic stock of
Northern bluefin, South Atlantic stock of albacore, Pacific
bigeye, and Eastern Atlantic bluefin are now listed as critically
endangered or endangered on the World Conservation Union
(IUCN) Redlist5, meaning they are at high risk of extinction in
the near future.6 The United Nation’s Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) now considers bigeye stocks as either
fully or over-exploited in all the world’s oceans and yellowfin
as fully exploited in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and
moderately to fully exploited in the Indian Ocean. The areas
with the highest proportions (46-60%) of over-exploited,
depleted and recovering stocks of tuna and tuna-like species
are the Southeast Atlantic, the Southeast Pacific, and the
Northeast Atlantic, as well as the high seas, particularly those
in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

1. Introduction

1.1 Distant Water Fleets and the Legal Basis
for Fisheries Access Agreements

their prime fishing grounds as they came under exclusive
coastal State control.

Distant water fishing is not new. Basques were fishing off the
Faeroe Islands as early as 875 AD and their fleets began
crossing the North Atlantic to harvest cod off the coast of
what is now Newfoundland at least a century before John
Cabot arrived there.7 Jacques Cartier, credited with mapping
the mouth of the St Lawrence, noted the presence of 1,000
Basque fishing vessels when planting a cross on the Gaspé
Peninsula.8 In Cabot’s wake European distant water fishing for
cod became a fixture off North America and continued
unabated for the next 400 years without any noticeable
impact on fish populations. That changed after the Second
World War when advances in fishing and refrigeration
technology fundamentally changed the nature of distant water
fishing. For the first time in history, onboard freezing capacity
allowed industrial bottom trawling vessels to remain on prime
fishing grounds for extended periods without having to land
their catch. Transshipment of catch that had been frozen at
sea and the resupply of fishing vessels on the fishing grounds
meant industrial vessels could continue fishing for months on
end. European nations, the Soviet Union and Japan were the
first to exploit this opportunity. Concerns about their
overfishing motivated several South American coastal nations
to extend their fisheries jurisdiction to 200 nautical miles
beginning in the late 1940s and 1950s. By the 1970s, many
other coastal States had followed their lead, and the world
community subsequently enshrined the 200 mile principle in
international law with the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS)9 which was adopted in 1982.

By extending coastal State sovereignty over marine resources
beyond narrow coastal zones UNCLOS severely pushed back
the application of the freedom of the seas, a principle of
international oceans law from Grotius in the 17th century,
which asserted that the seas were not property and therefore
were free for all nations to use.10

UNCLOS’ 200-mile EEZ seriously threatened those States
whose large distant water industrial fleets used the freedom of
the seas to fish within a few miles of shore anywhere in the
world. These countries and their fleets risked losing access to

UNCLOS, however, addressed their interests through a
special provision: the notion of a “fishable surplus” inside the
EEZ. While coastal States got the exclusive right to fisheries
within their 200-mile zone, this right was conditional on their
obligations to conserve these resources, determine what
portion their national fleets could harvest and make the
surplus, if any, available to other nations.

1.2 The UNCLOS Fisheries Provisions

UNCLOS Articles 61, 62 and 69 contain the critical provisions
on the obligations of coastal States in relation to the
management of their living resources and foreign access to
fisheries resources within an EEZ.

Article 61 lays out the coastal State’s obligations for
conservation of living resources within the EEZ by requiring it to:

• determine the allowable catch within its exclusive

economic zone (61.1)

• ensure, through proper conservation and management
measures, that living resources are not endangered by
over-exploitation (61.2)

• maintain or restore harvested species at levels which can

produce maximum sustainable yield (61.3)

Article 62 then lays out how these resources should be
utilised by requiring the coastal State to:

• Promote the “optimum” utilisation of the living resources in

the EEZ (62.1)

• determine its capacity to harvest the living resources within
the EEZ and where it does not have the capacity to harvest
the entire allowable catch, to give other states -particularly
land-locked developing states - access to the surplus
through “agreements or other arrangements” (62.2)

where equitable fishing opportunities/quotas are exchanged
between the parties respecting the longstanding traditional
fishing patterns in the North Atlantic which were threatened
by UNCLOS.

This northern, developed-country pattern of rapidly
diminished foreign presence or reciprocal opportunity was
not, however, repeated in the EEZs of developing countries in
the aftermath of UNCLOS. Instead, foreign fleets have
become entrenched in resource-rich developing country
waters and, moreover, have expanded their activities to
countries and waters they never fished prior to the adoption
of UNCLOS. The industrial distant water fleets of Europe,
Russia and Japan have been joined by other powerful and
emerging distant water fishing nations such as China, Taiwan,
Korea and the Philippines, leading to huge increases in fishing
capacity and a situation where all now compete for resources
on both the high seas and, under fisheries access
agreements, in the waters of developing nations.

7

• In doing so, balance various factors including the national
interests of the coastal State, the interests of nearby
developing countries, and the need to minimise economic
dislocation in States that have habitually fished in the EEZ
or have made substantial efforts in research and
identification of stocks (62.3).

If the coastal State determines that there is a surplus, then it
must grant access to others, firstly to neighbouring, land-
locked developing countries and then to States that had
habitually fished in the zone or which have made substantial
efforts in research and identification of stocks.

“Coastal States must take into account the need to minimise
detrimental effects on fishing communities and economic
dislocation in states whose nationals have habitually fished in
the zone.” (Art. 69.4).

The UNCLOS negotiators were clearly attempting to balance
different interests – those of the coastal State, those of
neighbouring land-locked countries and those of countries
that had traditionally fished the waters of the soon-to-be
legally sanctioned EEZs – in preparation for the curtailment of
foreign fishing within the new 200 nautical mile zone.

The inherent logic of UNCLOS was that distant water fishing
would diminish and eventually wither away as coastal States
increased their harvesting capacity inside their own EEZs.
This was assumed for instance in Article 69.3, which tried to
accommodate developing land-locked countries in that
situation. Indeed, this quickly happened in the advanced
industrial economies of the North such as Canada, which
extended its fisheries jurisdiction in 1977 and immediately
assumed exclusive harvesting rights over its rich groundfish
stocks. Since then, foreign fishing in Canadian waters has
become a marginal activity for very limited quotas of species
considered “under-utilised” by the Canadian fishing industry.

A similar process occurred in the United States. The last
direct foreign fishing took place in 2001 although the US
continues to allow foreign access to stock surpluses under its
principle of reciprocity.11 This principle also governs the
fisheries access agreements between the EU and its northern
fishing neighbours Norway, Iceland and the Faeroe Islands,

1. Introduction

1.3 The United Nations Fish Stocks
Agreement

The UNCLOS convention brought some 90%12 of the world’s
commercial fish stocks under the control of coastal States
through its EEZ provisions. But the EEZ’s 200 nautical mile
limit did not cover the full extent of continental shelf areas off
some states and left some productive fishing areas outside
coastal State control.13 Nor did UNCLOS completely do away
with the concept of the freedom of the seas. Article 87
declared the high seas “open to all States, whether coastal or
land-locked” including “freedom of fishing” (Article 87 (e)).

UNCLOS did, however, oblige fishing States to co-operate to
conserve stocks that either straddled the EEZ of two or more
coastal States or overlapped the coastal State’s EEZ into the
adjacent high seas, the so-called straddling stocks, (Article
63) and highly migratory stocks, like tuna, which migrate
across vast oceans expanses and in and out of EEZs (Article
64). In the aftermath of UNCLOS, distant water fleets that
were pushed out of coastal State EEZs refocused their efforts
on these high seas stocks and highly migratory species,
particularly tuna. Concerns that distant water fishing nations
were not meeting their UNCLOS obligations to co-operate to
manage these stocks increased the international pressure for
a new treaty that would address these issues.

This led to a second UN oceans instrument, the UN Fish
Stocks Agreement,14 which implements the articles of
UNCLOS relating to the conservation and management of
straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. Adopted in 1995,
it came into legally-binding force in December 2001 and
contains several important provisions regarding the fishery
conservation responsibilities of states, including obligations to
cease overfishing, adopt a precautionary approach, protect
biodiversity and ensure that States authorising vessels on the
high seas do so in conjunction with regional management
measures, UNCLOS and the Fish Stocks Agreement.

The Agreement also requires recognition of the special
requirements of developing States, including their
dependence on living marine resources, and the need to
avoid adverse impacts on, and ensure access to fisheries
by, subsistence, small-scale and artisanal fishers and
fishworkers, as well as indigenous people in small island
developing States (Article 24.2).

1.4 The FAO Compliance Agreement

The FAO Compliance Agreement was designed to address
problems caused by over-capitalisation and ever larger fishing
boats, flags of convenience (FOC), and other deficiencies
contributing to what is now known as illegal, unregulated and
unreported (IUU) fishing.15 The purpose of this Agreement is
to establish clear flag State responsibility for the conduct of
fishing vessels on the high seas and deter vessels from
seeking registry in countries with lax enforcement capacity to
avoid having to comply with international conservation and
management measures.

The Agreement was adopted in 1993 and entered into
force ten years later. As of November 2007, 35 signatories
had agreed to be bound by it, including the EU.16 Some
notable exceptions are China and Taiwan - two important
distant water fishing powers - and Panama, Honduras and
St. Vincent’s and the Grenadines, three flag-of-convenience
nations with a large registry of industrial high-seas fishing
vessels.17

1.5 The FAO Code of Conduct for
Responsible Fisheries

Other instruments, including the FAO Code of Conduct,
though voluntary, or ‘soft’ law, have important provisions
relevant to coastal States. The Code calls for protection of
the marine environment, including the protection of all critical
fishery habitats, and recognises the contributions of
subsistence, artisanal and small-scale fisheries and
emphasises a participatory approach, including the
participation of industry, fishworkers and environmental
organisations in decision-making processes. Under the
Code, four International Plans of Action (IPOA) have been
developed on seabirds, sharks, managing fishing capacity,
and IUU fishing.18

2.1 Japan and its Fisheries Access
Agreements

Japan is the world’s largest importer and one of the largest
consumers of fish and fish products, a reflection of the
importance of fish in Japanese daily life and cultural identity.
An estimated 602,000 tonnes of the fish consumed in Japan
comes from its distant water fleets operating on the high seas
and in the EEZs of foreign countries through access
agreements.19 Fisheries access agreements, therefore, play an
important role in sourcing fish for the Japanese domestic
market.

2.1.1 Gaikaku Dantai or Affiliated
Organisations

The Government of Japan has resisted coastal State
sovereign rights over migratory species. As a result, its official
role in negotiating fisheries agreements is limited to “umbrella”
agreements with coastal States that establish broad principles
of co-operation between the two governments, usually
framed in terms of mutual benefit.20 The details of the actual
terms and conditions of access are spelled out in subsidiary
agreements between the coastal State and Japanese fishing
industry associations. 21

This dichotomy gives the impression that a clear separation
exists between the Japanese Government and its fishing
industry, with the State’s interest in establishing the broad
principles of access and the private sector negotiating the
more difficult and detailed terms and conditions.

Nothing could be more misleading. In reality, the Government
of Japan, its specialised fishing institutions and its fishing
industry associations work closely together to negotiate and
secure access to foreign coastal State fishery resources in a
complex and sophisticated manner.

Specific government support for the fishing industry comes
from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries (MAFF), and its direct fisheries arm, the Japanese
Fisheries Agency (JFA). The MAFF and JFA in turn sponsor
what has been described as “a thick layer” of organisations
affiliated to government known as gaikaku dantai that are
conduits for “the money and influence” that flows between

the Japanese bureaucracy and the fishing industry. These
industry organisations have all the trappings of autonomous
organisations and in other countries would be considered
typical civil society associations but in Japan they are created
and sustained by the government.22

A key gaikaku dantai or affiliated organisation for fisheries
access is the Overseas Fisheries Co-operation Foundation
(OFCF), established by the Japanese Government and
industry groups in 1973 to subsidise co-operation between
Japan’s fishing fleets and coastal States.23 OFCF supports
Japan’s continued access to foreign fishing grounds through
fisheries aid, which it provides in the form of both goods and
technical services, as well as through the vetting of fisheries
projects funded by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) and the Japan International Co-operation Agency
(JICA).24 Through its ability to influence and even direct
Japanese fisheries and overseas development aid to coastal
States, the Japanese fishing industry is able to play an
important additional card in its negotiations for access.

Another critical gaikaku dantai industry association is the
Federation of Japan Tuna Fisheries Co-operative Associations
(also known as “Japan Tuna” or its Japanese name
Nikkatsuren), the main organisation representing Japan’s
distant water tuna fleets. Japan Tuna works closely with the
Japanese Fisheries Agency to develop and implement policy,
a process greatly facilitated by another Japanese practice
called amukudari: seconding senior bureaucrats to industry
associations or having them take up leadership positions in
the industry associations when they retire from the civil
service.25

The Japanese Government’s strategy of supporting its
industry associations’ fishery access negotiations with aid
packages makes it difficult to determine exactly how much
the Japanese Government pays for fisheries access since the
bilateral aid is kept separate from the access agreement
signed between the industry association and the coastal
State. The value of the aid package therefore acts as a hidden
subsidy to the industry associations that benefit from the
access. It does appear, however, that this approach has been
successful in keeping the access fees paid by the Japanese
fleets below the rates paid by other foreign fleets.

9

2. Review of Access Agreements

Japanese linking of aid and access agreements has not been
without controversy in recipient countries, notably those in the
Western and Central Pacific. While the fisheries aid packages
provided by the OFCF and JICA were meant to compensate
for the lower access fees, Tarte found that the aid delivered
was sometimes inappropriate.26 Moreover, despite the claims
that the fisheries aid was meant to assist the coastal State in
developing its fisheries, Tarte found that Japan was reluctant
to fund indigenous fishing capacity that would compete with
its own fleets. Rather, the aid often coincided with Japan’s
own strategic fisheries interests.27

The practice of tying aid, directly or indirectly, has implications
for good governance and transparency.28 Access agreements
tied to aid may hinder or deter coastal States from supporting
necessary measures aimed at sustainability of fish stocks and
the ecosystem, either due to concern for lost revenue or due
to more direct pressure.

2.2 The EU and its Fisheries Access/
Partnership Agreements

The EU’s29 fisheries agreements30 are based on clearly
articulated commercial interests – maintaining access to fish
resources for its distant water fleets to protect fishing jobs at sea
and at home. EU fleets have had a long historical presence in
the waters of Africa, Norway, Iceland, Faroe Islands and North
America. According to the European Commission’s Directorate
General for Fisheries and Marine Affairs (DG Fish), these
agreements annually supply 2.5 million tonnes of fish to the EU
(about 40 % of the EU’s catches), generate 40,000 EU jobs and
allow 3,000 EU vessels to operate either solely or partially in the
waters of third countries or on the high seas.31 As of the end of
April 2007 there were 14 bilateral fisheries agreements in force
under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) between the EU and
third countries. The EU separates its fisheries agreements into
two broad categories: Northern Agreements and Southern
Agreements.

2.2.1 Northern Agreements

These are agreements between the EU and its northern
European neighbours: Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands.
The distinguishing characteristic of these agreements is that
they are reciprocal, and involve the EU obtaining fishing
opportunities in neighbouring countries for quotas of certain
species in exchange for providing these same countries with
access to equivalent quotas in the waters of the EU Member
States. According to the EU, this reciprocal arrangement is
called for because these developed countries “have the means
to exploit their own resources” fully.

2.2.2 Southern Agreements

All of the Community’s access agreements for tuna fall under
the category of Southern Agreements. Unlike the Northern
Agreements, which are based on the reciprocal exchange of
fishing opportunities between developed countries, the
Southern Agreements, between the EU and (in most cases)
developing countries, are based on the commercial principle
of cash payment for the purchase of a good, in this case, the
right to fish.32 Under these arrangements the EU negotiates a
framework agreement with a coastal State that sets the
financial compensation, as well as other conditions, such as
gear restrictions, for the EU distant water fleets in those
waters.33 The rationale for this type of arrangement is rooted
in the UNCLOS notion of a fishable surplus.34
The cash payment is made up of two components: a financial
contribution paid by the EU, and a licence fee paid by the
vessel owners that benefit from the access arrangement.

2.2.3 The Shift to “Partnership” and
“Coherence”

The EU’s cash-for-access arrangements have been
controversial and criticised for failing to meet sustainability
criteria, not least because of the unequal power relationships
between the EU and the poorer countries with which it has
these agreements.35

With the reform of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in
2002, the EU set out to address these concerns by
“transforming” its access agreements into “genuine
partnerships for the development of sustainable and

responsible fisheries”.36 The objective of this new generation of
Fisheries Partnership Agreements (FPAs) is to move away from
the purely commercial nature of the pay to fish arrangement,
towards agreements that reflect the wider goals of the EU’s
fisheries, development, environment and trade policies.37 In the
words of the European Commission, these new partnership
agreements aim “to help the developing countries put in place
their own fisheries policies that can help them meet their aim
of economic development while protecting fish resources.”38

Unchanged, however, remains the fact that the EU insists on
maintaining its vessels’ presence in the waters of these third
countries. Partnership agreements are seen as the best means
of protecting the interests of the EU’s distant water fishing
fleets and the important domestic investor and employment
interests linked to them.39

It is too early for substantive evaluations of the EU’s new
generation of FPAs, but ongoing negotiations with the Pacific
Island Countries, appear to show that a substantial gap still
exists between the EU’s interests in the region’s fisheries and
what can be considered a “genuine partnerships for the
development of sustainable and responsible fisheries”.

2.2.4 Second Generation or Joint Venture
Agreements

Joint venture arrangements, or second generation
agreements, involved the setting up of joint ventures between
the fleets of individual EU Member States and investor
interests in the coastal State’s EEZ, with the condition of
obtaining access to fish quotas.40 This policy was aggressively
pursued by EU Member States throughout the 1990s under a
programme that subsidised the transfer of surplus EU vessels
to developing countries.41 While the EU discontinued this
programme in 2004, joint ventures may become more
prominent again in the future. For example, the EU’s most
recent negotiations of reciprocal free-trade agreements with
coastal States such as Chile and South Africa offer liberalised
access to the EU market conditional upon the opening up of
respective coastal State waters to the fishing fleets of EU
Member States through investment.42

2.3 The US Multilateral Agreement with the
Pacific Island Countries

The US is not known as a Distant Water Fishing Nation, with
the exception of its tuna seine fleet in the Western and Central
Pacific Ocean.43 The US tuna seine fleet has been fishing in
the WCPO since 1988 under a treaty that the US Government
negotiated with 15 Pacific Island Countries.44

This is the only access agreement that is multilateral, which is
extremely significant when dealing with a highly migratory
resource like tuna that no one State can claim as its own.
Coastal States that host and share the same stocks at
different times during their migrations have an interest - and
indeed an obligation under UNCLOS - in co-operating in the
sustainable management of these stocks. Distant water
fishing nations, however, have consistently resisted coastal
State initiatives to negotiate access on a multilateral basis,
preferring instead to play one coastal State off against
another. To its credit, the US did not take this approach, and
its vessels can now reap the benefits of long-term secure
access to prime fishing grounds without having to negotiate a
dozen or so separate agreements in the region. The US Treaty
is also exceptional in terms of the monetary returns it provides
to Pacific Island Countries.

The treaty between the US and the Pacific Island Countries45
outlines the basic elements of the fishing agreement, including
the US responsibility as flag State for the conduct of its
vessels, the detailed conditions under which fishing and
transhipment can take place, the national fishing laws with
which US vessels must comply, provisions for a fleet-funded
observer programme, the number of licences available and
the costs of these to the US fleet.46 Each time the US
Agreement was extended, the fees payable increased
significantly, and in the last extension, the number of licences
decreased.47 Other amendments in the 2003 extension
included VMS coverage, changes to the observer programme
and reporting, recognition of WCPFC, opening of part of the
Solomon Island’s EEZ and closure of Papua New Guinea’s
archipelagic waters.48

2.4 Other Distant Water Fishing Nations
and their Fisheries Agreements49

The US, Japan and the EU are not the only distant water
fishing nations, nor are they the only governments negotiating
fisheries access. Korea, Taiwan, China and increasingly other
countries such as the Philippines are extensively involved in
distant water fishing for tuna. In fact, data from the FFA shows
that Taiwan, Korea and the Philippines have the second, third
and fourth largest tuna seine fleets fishing in the WCPO as well
as an important stake in the tuna fisheries of the Indian Ocean.

2.4.1 Korea

The Korean distant water strategy is to supply fish both to its
domestic market and to the highest international bidders,
primarily Japan, the EU and the US. Korean tuna purse seine
vessels are also major suppliers to key global canneries
located in American Samoa, Thailand, Mauritius, Seychelles,
Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal and Ghana. The Korean Government
supports its distant water fleets with an extensive network of
21 overseas support bases.

There were an estimated 410 Korean distant water fishing
vessels operating in the oceans of the world in 2005,
targeting mostly tuna, squid and demersal species. Of these,
29 were tuna purse seiners, 177 were tuna long-liners and
146 were bottom trawlers. The majority of the vessels are
based in the Pacific (242), followed by the Atlantic (139) and
the Indian Ocean (29). Access agreements are normally
negotiated by the Korea Deep Sea Fisheries Association on
behalf of its members. Countries that Korean vessels have
had or have fisheries access agreements with are: Kiribati, the
Solomon Islands, the Cook Islands, Tuvalu, Mauritania and
Papua New Guinea. Korean vessels are also operating under
direct licensing arrangements or joint ventures in Surinam,
Guinea, Gabon, Marshall Islands, Angola, Nauru, Federated
States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, Kenya
and Madagascar.

2.4.2 Taiwan

Taiwanese foreign fishing supplies its domestic market with
squid, mackerel, shark and tuna but most of its catch is
exported. The bulk (62%) goes to Japan, which imports
almost all of Taiwan’s high quality long-line yellowfin and
bigeye tuna production. Other principal markets are the US,
Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore. Taiwanese seiners also
supply canneries in Thailand, American Samoa and
elsewhere. In 2003 Taiwan had access agreements with 28
different countries. Like Korea, it maintains a network of
foreign bases to support its fishing operations, with 33 ports
in the Atlantic including the EU port of Las Palmas in the
Canary Islands, 26 in the Indian Ocean and 12 in the Pacific.

Taiwan provides fisheries aid to developing countries
channelled through an organisation called the Overseas
Fisheries Development Council (OFDC) and funded by both
government and the private sector. A principal objective of the
OFDC’s aid is to reward countries willing to recognise Taiwan
diplomatically. There are four Taiwanese industry organisations
involved in access agreements. The principal one for tuna is
the Taiwan Deep Sea Tuna Boat-Owners and Exporters
Association with 569 members and 629 vessels including an
agreement with Papua New Guinea for the 34 seine
Taiwanese purse seine vessels fishing in the WCPO.

2.4.3 China

China only began its distant water fishing operations in 1985
when the China National Fisheries Group first sent its bottom
trawler fleet to West Africa where it still maintains a very
strong presence. The distant water operations have expanded
significantly since then and, with government encouragement,
Chinese State-owned fishing corporations now have access
and joint venture agreements with 38 countries. In 2002, an
estimated 1700 Chinese vessels were fishing in foreign waters
and on the high seas in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic
Oceans, employing an estimated 27,000 workers in
harvesting and processing fish worth an estimated $ 5 billion
(US). Chinese distant water fishing production is highly traded.
A significant portion is returned to China but also exported to
the EU, the US and Singapore. Lower quality and low value
species are also supplied to Africa. Foreign fishing is a means
of relieving pressure on China’s own overfished domestic
fisheries. Only 2% of 1999 distant water fishing production of
900,000 tonnes came from tuna, 20% from squid and 78%
from bottom trawling on demersal species. China reported a
tuna catch of over 73,000 tonnes in 2006, almost double the
catch two years earlier.50

2.5 Comparing Fisheries Agreements
across the Pacific

The Japanese Government does not negotiate access directly
with coastal States but tailors government fisheries and
development aid to support the access objectives and
negotiations of its fleets. The US has a much more limited
distant water fishing experience, focused on tuna in the
WCPO. It has developed a long term partnership relationship
with the countries of the region that is exemplary in terms of
its financial importance, its commitment to multilateralism and
responsible fishing.

With the paucity of detail available on the arrangements with
other countries and fleets in the WCPO it is difficult to make
direct comparisons between the US’s multilateral arrangement
and those of other nations. However, Japanese agreements
with Pacific Island Countries, which were entered into during
the same time period, are well below the standard set by the
US both in terms of return to the coastal States and formal
flag State commitment to the principles of responsible fishing.
The US also set a standard that the EU, despite its claims of
responsible fishing and commitment to development, regional
integration and co-operation, has been loath to meet.

Although in no way comparable with the US Treaty, the EU is
somewhat more generous than others in the rate of return it
provides the WCPO coastal States through its access
agreements. Under its three tuna agreements in the WCPO,
EU seine vessel owners pay
which the EU fortifies with an additional
65 per tonne. This
works out to approximately US $145 per tonne, considerably
more, for example, than the US $45 to US $48 per tonne that
Papua New Guinea charged to achieve a 6% rate of return on
catch value under the private agreements it negotiated for the
2006-2007 access period with Japan.51 However the EU has
not yet been willing to match the US in terms of a multilateral
regional approach52 despite requests from Pacific Island
Countries to do so as part of the ongoing EU-EPA
negotiations.

3. The Limited Options for Coastal States
offering Fisheries Access under Tuna
Agreements

All coastal States involved in fisheries access agreements
seek, in one way or another, to maximise the benefits they
receive from the access arrangements. Many explicitly include
the maximisation of benefits as a formal policy objective.53

Our review of the different strategies pursued since the 1970s
shows that the coastal States have pursued three different
strategies: 1) they can become essentially Resource Renters
by attempting to maximise the amount of income they receive
from the sale of access rights; 2) they can become
Conditional Resource Renters by attaching some conditions
to this access or 3) they can pursue a Domestication option
by “nationalising” the foreign fleet.

Unfortunately, all three of these options are sub-optimal for
coastal States seeking to maximise the social and economic
benefits of their fisheries resources with the exception of
some special circumstance tuna fisheries which will be
explained later in this report.

3.1 Resource Renter Strategy

The resource renter strategy is pursued by all coastal States
involved in the sale of access rights. While it can provide a
secure source of foreign exchange to cash-strapped
governments, often augmented by substantial amounts of
aid, it can result in coastal States becoming dependent on
this income. This dependency can extend to their fisheries
management institutions, creating a situation where their
major foreign funder makes access demands on them that
undermine their conservation and social objectives.

While foreign industrial fleets have become permanent fixtures
in coastal State waters and dependent on access to tuna, as
self-contained industrial units they provide little to no fishing
employment benefits to the coastal States and no upstream
or downstream benefits. As such, foreign fleets can enter into
conflict and competition with domestic fleets (both artisanal
and large-scale) over fishing grounds and markets,
undermining the viability of the domestic industry. Foreign
industrial overfishing can alter marine ecosystems and
threaten the food security of coastal States. Coastal States
are constrained in the level of fees they can extract from the
foreign fleets; competition (rather than co-operation) for
access agreements with neighbouring coastal States keeps
fees low for foreign fleets,54 and the low levels of resource
rents generated by most fisheries make it difficult to extract
higher fees from the fleets.

Maximising Resource Rents – Key to
More Equitable Returns to Coastal States

Resource rent is a concept widely used in resource
economics. In fishing, it refers to the amount of money that
is left over after all the costs of operations, including normal
returns to both capital and labour, are deducted from
revenues (DFID). This residual amount is what the resource
owner, in theory, should seek to maximise. A coastal State
that wants to maximise the amount of money it can earn
from providing access to its fishery resources (assuming
that maximising the resource rent is the preferable option
for the coastal State55) must ensure initially that the fishery
is profitable for all participants and that it generates
revenues (rents) beyond normal returns that the state can
then capture.

The problem that occurs in over-subscribed fisheries is that
the resource rent gets completely eaten up or dissipated
and fleets end up with returns to capital (what ship owners
invest) and labour (crew incomes) that are below “normal”.
In fact, in many fisheries, fleets operate at a loss, which is
the main reason states are heavily involved in subsidising
their operations.56 The problem that fleet over-capacity
poses for countries wishing to maximise or even increase
the amounts in fees (or rents) they receive from fisheries
access is best illustrated by the situation in the WCPO.

Since the early 2000s, global over-production has kept
tuna prices down while fleet costs have spiralled upwards,
largely because of increased fuel prices. Under current
conditions most analysts agree that the distant water tuna
fleets in the WCPO (and throughout the world) are
operating under very tight margins and that access fees in
the range of 5% to 6% of catch value, which most Pacific
Island Countries seek and are able to achieve, are near or
at the maximum which the fleets will pay.57 It is impossible
to determine the accuracy of these rent estimates without
reliable cost and earnings surveys.58 These, however, do
not exist,59 as fleet operations in the WCPO (and
elsewhere) are the tightly guarded secrets of their foreign
corporate owners. Where most analysts agree, however, is
that distant water tuna fleets are in an over-capacity
situation that is both seriously reducing their profitability
and the potential returns to coastal States.

Studies have shown that by reducing the number of
vessels that are given access to the Pacific tuna fishery, the
access fees earned by the Pacific Island Countries could
increase by between 10% and 40% of gross revenues. At
their highest level, they could possibly double the amount
of aid provided to the region by, for example, Japan.60 In a
modelling exercise conducted in 2000, theoretical
reduction of Pacific seine fleet effort to less than 50% of
1996 levels showed fleet revenues would fall by only 15%
but that costs would fall by 30%. Most significantly,
resource rent (i.e. access fees) would have more than
doubled and returns to coastal States from tuna access
fees would have risen by 39% under the existing fee
structure.61

A more recent study by Kompass and Che (2007)62 shows
that a 36% effort reduction in the Pacific purse seine effort
and 12%-19% reductions in the frozen and fresh long-line
fisheries in the short term would increase the profitability of
the fishery by 30% over a 50 year planning horizon. This
economic research makes it clear that reducing the seiner
effort in domestic waters is the key to generating higher
rents from access fees because the seine fleets, which
catch the most tuna and generate the bulk of fees, catch
65% of their tuna inside the EEZs of the Pacific Island
Countries. Considering that the Pacific is the last frontier
of the global tuna fleets the economics of the tuna
industry are likely to be in even more dire state elsewhere
in the oceans.

Agreements

3.2 Conditional Resource Renter Strategy

Applying conditions on foreign fleets to complement the
payment of fees is one method coastal States can pursue to
improve access agreements and increase the spin-off benefits
flowing into their economies. In general, as conditions
increase so do the benefits; onshore processing of catch is
seen as an optimal generator of employment. Conditions on
the ground in coastal States can, however, limit their ability to
impose conditions despite their official policy objectives. For
example, Kiribati, which has limited port infrastructure and
cannot accommodate deep draught vessels, has specific
constraints on its ability to demand local landings and
processing as a requirement of access.

Providing supplies and services to distant water fishing
vessels is an option some coastal States can pursue with a
degree of success. For example, Mauritius, a strategically
situated Indian Ocean Island State, generates over
140
million a year in port revenue, roughly the same it generates in
tuna processing export earnings.63 Making Mauritius the hub
for distant water tuna fleets in the Indian Ocean is one of the
Government’s main development strategies.64

€

The lure of access to fisheries has also allowed numerous
African, Caribbean and Pacific group (ACP) coastal States
to sign tuna access agreements with conditions that have
brought significant employment benefits to their local
economies. Many ACP countries (Côte d’Ivoire, Mauritius,
the Seychelles, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands)
have been able to create, to varying extents, shore-based
operations linked to tuna supply agreements. While it is
generally difficult to generate significant employment spin-off
from access agreements, tuna canning is an exception.
However, the significant employment gains already achieved
in this area through conditional access do not appear to be
sustainable given the trends in globalisation and WTO rules.
The case of the Seychelles helps illustrate both the successes
of conditional tuna agreements and the fragility of these
arrangements.65

Seychelles Case Study

The Seychelles is a small island state (population, 80,000)
situated in the Indian Ocean. It is close to valuable tuna
resources, has a deep-water port and, as an ACP country,
enjoys preferential access to the EU market under the
Cotonou Agreement.

The Government of the Seychelles has or has had tuna
fisheries access agreements with the EU (since 1984), the
Federation of Japan Tuna Fisheries Co-operative
Associations and the National Federation of Fisheries Co-
operative Associations of Japan (since 1988), the Taiwan
Deep Sea Tuna Boat-Owners and Exporters Association,
and the Government of Mauritius, as well as a series of
“private” arrangements with individual purse seiners.

The Government of the Seychelles pursues a Conditional
Resource Renter strategy by trying to maximise the
benefits to the Seychelles’ economy from access
agreements, not just to maximise the income from access
fees. It does so by linking fishing access to the use of its
main port and supplying its tuna canning plant. The most
recent access agreement with the EU, for example,
stipulates that the seiners “shall participate in supplying
tuna to the Seychelles at the international market price”
and makes transshipment in Seychelles ports mandatory.
Similar conditions also apply to the private agreements.
Conditions such as these have made tuna processing the
dominant feature of the Seychelles economy. The
Seychelles fisheries sector in 2001 employed an estimated
4,600 people (14% of the total formal workforce).

The Seychelles cannery is the second largest in the world
and probably the first in terms of turnover value.66 In the
early 2000s it processed 90,000 tonnes of tuna and
produced 360 million cans. The Seychelles cannery is the
country’s single biggest private employer, the single biggest
buyer of electricity, the biggest exporter and the biggest
earner of foreign exchange. Canned tuna represented 91%
of total fish exports and 87% of the country’s total export
earnings in 2000-2001.

However, while these figures are impressive they mask the
reality of tuna canning being a low-margin activity with
superficial contributions to an economy in terms of real
value addition.

• 50% of the workforce is from the Philippines, Kenya and
Madagascar, a reflection of the low status of fish plant
work.

• Industrial fishing vessels spent an estimated US $46
million in the Seychelles in 2001, but 71% of this
expenditure was for bunkering of imported fuel, an
exercise that other studies suggest contributes at
best 8% added value to the local economy.

• Canned tuna exports are the Seychelles’ most important
foreign exchange earner, but tuna export earnings are
considerably offset by tuna import costs ( the tuna
caught by foreign-flagged vessels are considered imports
despite coming from the Seychelles EEZ) and the costs
of related imports for processing, such as cans, edible
oils and machinery. Such costs place small island
economies at a huge comparative disadvantage in the
globalised canned tuna economy.

The Seychelles geographic and natural advantages are not
sufficient to offset these increased production costs.
Rather, its preferential EU market access under the
Cotonou Agreement, avoiding the 24% duty applied to
imports from other countries outside the ACP, is probably
the most crucial factor helping in its attempt to carve out
significant employment gains from tuna.

Challenges to the EU’s preferential access for ACP canned
tuna, lodged under the WTO by Thailand and the
Philippines, are likely to result in this preferential access
disappearing, with most analysts agreeing that the canning
operations that ACP countries have established in West
Africa, the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific will
disappear as well.67

3. The Limited Options for Coastal States
offering Fisheries Access under Tuna
Agreements

3.3 Domestication Strategy

Domestication strategy usually involves either (a) re-flagging
foreign vessels and placing them under the jurisdiction of the
coastal State; or (b) joint venture arrangements under which
they remain under foreign flags but operate as locally-based
vessels. In many ways this is an extension of the Conditional
Resource Renter option. Its intent is to maximise coastal State
employment by linking the harvesting with shore based
operations, especially value-added processing activities. The
domestication strategy necessarily involves a loss of access
fees for the coastal States and can also involve tax concessions
to entice foreign investment.68 In the Papua New Guinea case,
for example, domestic class licences cost US $1,510 versus
US $90,000 for those under access agreements.69 However,
this loss of access and fiscal revenue can be more than offset
by the substantial job creation that flows from onshore
investments in processing as the Philippines and Taiwan
ventures in Papua New Guinea discussed above show.

A study by Campling and others70 points out that the
domestication approach, however, requires clearly articulated
investment expectations by the coastal State to avoid “brass
plate” partnerships i.e. situations where the domestication
remains superficial in terms of real domestic benefits in
economic growth, diversification and job creation.

RFMOs: Regularly Failing to Manage
our Oceans

Greenpeace believes the present system of high seas
oceans management is fundamentally flawed. Instead of
working to ensure conservation of marine biodiversity, the
current high seas governance regime allows the fishing
industry to operate with very few restrictions and to put its
short-term interests before the long term conservation of
functional marine ecosystems.71

Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) are
the international bodies charged with the management of
fishing activities targeting fish stocks on the high seas, as
well as fish stocks which migrate through the waters of
more than one state.

The United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA)
mandated RFMOs as the primary mechanism for managing
and conserving high seas straddling and highly migratory
fish stocks, such as tuna. UNFSA Articles 5 and 6 are the
legal cornerstones for applying the ecosystem approach
and the precautionary principle to fisheries management.
Despite this legal obligation, RFMOs have all too rarely
taken decisions consistent with a precautionary
approach.72

This was recognised recently when the UN Fish Stocks
Agreement Review Conference, held in New York in May
2006, agreed that 'most RFMOs are not performing
impressively in their core duty, which is to achieve the long-
term sustainability of fish stocks'.73

Twelve years after the adoption of the UNFSA, RFMOs still
lack the will to say “enough is enough” and impose strict
controls on the fisheries they manage. Tuna RFMOs also
have a track record of toothless consensus decision
making, allowing countries with the biggest interest in the
fisheries to prevent implementation of the measures
required to not only maintain sustainable fish stocks and
profitable fisheries, but also to protect and preserve the rich
marine biodiversity of our oceans.74

20

Taking Tuna out of the Can: Rescue Plan for the World’s Favourite Fish

On the opposite side of precaution:
The northern bluefin tuna
'non-recovery' plan.

Even when relying on models that are excessively
optimistic about the status of tuna stocks, RFMOs and the
governments that are party to them sometimes fail to take
the advice of their own scientific committees. In few cases
has this been clearer than at the 15th Annual Meeting of
the International Commission for the Conservation of
Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) that took place in Dubrovnik
(Croatia) in November 2006.

In 2006 the ICCAT Scientific Committee on Research and
Statistics (SCRS) carried out an assessment of the bluefin
tuna population, and its result left no doubt about the risks
being faced by the eastern stock of bluefin tuna. According
to the ICCAT SCRS, current catches were more than three
times the sustainable level, a rapid decline in the spawning
biomass was occurring and the population was facing a
high risk of collapse. As a result, scientists recommended a
maximum total catch of around 15,000 tonnes, a minimum
size limit of 30 kg, and a closure of the fishery that should
include June, when most of the spawning occurs.

In November 2006 a new 'recovery plan' for bluefin tuna
was approved by ICCAT contracting parties. This
management plan, which is currently in force, established a
total quota of 29,500 tonnes for 2007, almost double the
scientifically recommended level; established a seasonal
closure that excluded the peak of the spawning season in
June; and set a 30 kg catch limit that was subject to
numerous exceptions.

4. Recommendations for Coastal States -
Pursuing an Alternative Model for Tuna
Fisheries Development

There is overwhelming evidence that fisheries access
agreements, as they have been implemented over the last 30
years, are by and large unsustainable.75 The results of
independent evaluations of tuna agreements, while less
damning than the mixed-species agreements, also show that
they are negotiated and executed with a complete disregard
for responsible fishing practices.76 Access agreements
respond primarily to industrial fishing country interests and
needs, leaving coastal States to assume all of the long-term
risks associated with resource depletion, and undermining
regional fisheries agreements aimed at achieving sustainability.

There is no shortage of principles and legal obligations to
guide the conduct of distant water fishing nations under
fisheries access agreements. Both the “hard” and “soft”
instruments of international law, from UNCLOS to the FAO’s
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, provide more
than enough guidance. However, powerful fishing nations
have shown a blithe disregard for their obligations under
international law in their pursuit of tuna resources. Sadly,
coastal States with weak management capacity are most
often unable to enforce them.

4.1 Recommendation #1: Shifting to
Domestic, Small-Scale Harvesting to Build
a Fisheries Economy

Building a domestic fisheries economy is required to
maximise the employment benefits of the fishery.
Greenpeace believes that the best means of doing so for
job-starved coastal States is to develop labour-intensive,
domestically built and financed, small-scale fishing fleets77
based exclusively on passive and highly selective fishing
gear, preferably hook and line78, pots and fish traps.

Providing foreign industrial purse-seine and long-line fleets
with access to coastal tuna resources is the worst possible
fisheries development and conservation option for coastal
States. Industrial tuna fleets damage a coastal State’s ability
to generate employment from the fishery. Distant water
industrial tuna fleets make only marginal job contributions to
coastal States, usually in the form of limited service and
supply purchases and only in those few countries where they
make port calls. Industrial tuna seiners and long-liners are

self-contained production units with economic umbilical cords
that attach firmly to their home ports and markets.79

For some coastal States—for example, small atoll countries in
the South Pacific with very small populations, limited
infrastructure, vast EEZs and considerable tuna resources—
maximising access fees may be the only viable option for
maximising the economic potential of the fishery. However, for
other countries, especially those with significant tuna
resources in their coastal waters and an existing fishery, there
is very little evidence to suggest that pursuing resource rent
maximisation through foreign access is a sustainable or
optimal objective. A number of coastal States have pursued
strategies to maximise the returns from tuna beyond simply
selling access. Several countries have policies to restrict long-
lining to nationals, making it accessible to local investors. In
Fiji, the small-scale long-line model has also created a
successful export-oriented industry and the pole and line fleet
in the Solomon Islands, which lands a superior skipjack
product, has also created a substantial bait fishery in that
country’s coastal waters.80

Some studies suggest that the employment gains from the
switch to this strategy could be significant, as small-scale
fisheries can be up to 100 times more labour-intensive than
the industrial option.81 From an upstream employment
generation perspective, what matters most is the opportunity
for the local economy to produce the vessels needed to
manage and use the country’s fisheries resources, relying on
local financing, skills and materials, and according to local
design specifications and preferences. While it is unlikely that
developing country coastal States will ever be able to produce
industrial inputs like engines and navigation equipment that
even the smallest of vessels now require, there is nothing
stopping the development of vibrant boat building industries
in most coastal States.

22

Taking Tuna out of the Can: Rescue Plan for the World’s Favourite Fish

4.2 Recommendation #2: Shifting to
Increased Domestic Handling and
Processing

The combination of ecologically compatible passive,
selective gear and short fishing trips allows a small scale
fishery to land a high quality product that can fetch a
premium price compared to its industrial rivals, as well as
opportunities for coastal State enterprises to engage in
export activities that until now have been assumed by the
foreign fleets. Tuna fisheries could be an important
generator of employment and induce both upstream and
downstream employment opportunities in many countries.

Upstream jobs flow from the array of connected industries
needed to build, supply and maintain fishing vessels; while
downstream jobs come from the activities needed to get fish
products to the final consumers once they are landed (e.g.
handling, processing and marketing).

As well as maximising upstream and direct harvesting
employment in coastal States, moving to a domestically
financed, built, serviced and supplied small-scale fleet would
also create the opportunity to maximise downstream
employment through the handling, processing and marketing
of catch. Because small-scale production offers the best
option for optimising value from lower output, selective
production of the landed value of fishery products would also
likely increase over time without increasing production
volume.

If a small-scale fish harvesting strategy is accompanied by
other fisheries management measures, such as precautionary
catch levels and the adoption of the ecosystem approach, it
should be possible to place tuna harvesting on a more
sustainable footing. A distinguishing feature of the small scale
fishery is its attachment to local ports and the length of fishing
voyages: either day-trips or trips limited to a few days by the
carrying capacity and lack of refrigeration.

While opportunities for upstream development are clear,
development of the downstream sector poses many more
obstacles. To start with, the small fishing villages that host
artisanal and small-scale fleets are some of the poorest and
most isolated places on earth. They often lack the most
minimal of conditions (good road and other communication
links, electrification, potable water) needed for integration into
the national economy. These conditions also make it
extremely challenging to maintain the cold chain for
artisanal/small scale fishery products from the moment of
capture, a critical factor in maximising catch value, and
particularly for penetrating the international markets. This will
require innovative solutions at a national and regional level,
such as the use of renewable energy technologies. For
example, any temporary generation surpluses from variable
sources such as wind and solar could be used to make ice.82

The Ecosystem Approach – Protecting
Marine Life in All its Forms

Most fisheries management measures focus on single
species and do not consider the role of the species in the
wider ecosystem. In contrast, the ecosystem approach to
the management of activities in the marine environment
requires consideration of whole ecosystems at a scale that
ensures that ecosystem integrity is maintained. It
recognises the complex interactions between species that
make up marine ecosystems, and so is underpinned by
principles of community biology and ecology.

Given the scientific uncertainty and unpredictability of
marine ecosystems, it is vital that the ecosystem approach
is applied in conjunction with a precautionary approach.
What this means in practice is that a lack of knowledge
does not excuse decision makers from taking action, but
rather that they err on the side of caution.

In November 2006, an international group of ecologists and
economists, led by Professor Boris Worm of Dalhousie
University, published a study in Science that brought the
extent of the degradation of our marine ecosystems into
stark relief. Looking at marine biodiversity on a global scale,
the study shows that loss of marine biodiversity is
drastically reducing the ocean's ability to produce seafood,
resist diseases, filter pollutants and rebound from stresses
such as overfishing and climate change. The team's
projection that all commercial and seafood species are on
the brink of collapse was shocking enough to make news
headlines across the world. However, the study was not all
doom and gloom, for it also showed that closing areas to
fishing by establishing marine reserves increases the
abundance, productivity and diversity of species found in
the reserves. This applies to fish at least as much as it
applies to other species, which means that marine reserves
boost fish stocks and ultimately the catch per unit effort in
waters adjacent to the reserves. This should be a wake-up
call to us all. If we take action now, the oceans possess the
potential to rebound; if we do nothing, we will witness
further fisheries collapses until there is nothing left to fish.

In order to ensure sufficient protection across the whole
range of marine ecosystems it will be necessary to
establish a representative network of fully protected marine
reserves. To be effective, such networks must therefore
span large geographic distances and be of sufficient scale
to protect against catastrophes and ensure the long-term
health and stability of marine ecosystems. In order to
reverse the current decline in the health of our oceans,
Greenpeace is calling for 40% of the oceans to be
protected by marine reserves.

For exclusively marine migratory species such as tuna,
the creation of marine reserves to protect known spawning
grounds, nursery areas and migration bottlenecks are all
likely to confer highly protective benefits on the population
overall as well as the ecosystems of which they are part.
Designation of an area as a marine reserve does not
preclude a need to define adequate management
strategies applied to areas falling outside designated
marine reserves. The goal is to also achieve sustainable
use of marine resources outside the marine reserves
network. This implies that these activities must conform to
principles of sustainability, causing no degradation of
ecosystem structure and function, and also meet the needs
of both current and future generations. Marine reserves are
a complement to such measures as reduction in fishing
effort and capacity, prevention of IUU fishing and
development of non-destructive fishing methods. Marine
reserves are also essential in increasing the resilience of
marine ecoystems to other human-induced changes such
as the effects of global warming and associated changes in
water temperature patterns.

4.3 Recommendation #3: Replacing
Access Agreements with Joint Venture
Supply Agreements

The continued strong international demand for fish
products from the three main developed country markets
(EU, Japan and the US) and China, coupled with weak to
non-existent coastal State fisheries management
capacity, is fuelling overfishing and depletion of wild fish
stocks in both developed and developing countries83
Trade in fish and fish products must take place under
sustainable harvesting conditions and with effective
protection for the resource, the ecosystem, and for the
food security interests of the developing States.

To maximise export benefits from their products, the
developing country private sector would benefit from joint
venture agreements with responsible developed country fish
importing firms that would provide them with access to the
developed country fish marketing and distribution networks.
Agreements between coastal States and fish importing
countries could provide an enabling framework for such joint
ventures. However, concerns about the food security interests
of consumers in developing countries, the livelihoods of
traditional fish processors in developing countries, and the
sustainability of the resource cannot be over-emphasised.

The experience of export-oriented fish processing initiatives
over the last decade shows that these can be enclave
operations focused exclusively on providing high quality and
safe fishery products for consumers in developed countries
without any regard or concern for the interests of consumers
in the exporting country.84 Coastal States must ensure that
the export strategies they permit do not undermine the food
security and livelihoods of their most vulnerable citizens, and
developed nations must safeguard the sustainability of the
resources and the interests of the developing countries.

Consequently, any investments in fish export activities must
therefore be accompanied by full conservation, food security
and livelihood impact studies. Coastal States and recipient
countries must negotiate framework agreements in the areas
of fish processing and marketing. These must include
investments to improve the quality, supply and availability of

affordable fish products for the poorest fish consumers in the
coastal States, as well as to improve the livelihood security,
access to resources, and working conditions of traditional fish
processors and marketers.

4.4 Recommendation #4: Decoupling
Fisheries Aid from Fisheries Access and
Increasing Development Assistance
Targeted for Fisheries Management and
Isolated Coastal Communities

Decoupling the provision of aid that is earmarked for the
improvement of the governance of fisheries from the
overriding concern about access will allow donor nations
to fund more innovative initiatives towards the application
of the ecosystem approach in management options for
coastal States, including the mapping and protection of
critical habitats such as spawning and nursery areas and
the creation of a coastal network of marine reserves.
Greenpeace strongly urges developed countries to focus
their fisheries aid on advancing long-term conservation
initiatives such as these to assist coastal States in
implementing the ecosystem approach to fisheries
management.

Increased development assistance for coastal communities
for basic infrastructure, aimed at improving communications
links, electrification and potable water, will not only provide
overall improvements in community living standards but will
also deliver improved services to businesses such as fish
plants. Donor countries should also allocate significant
resources for the strengthening of civil society actors
associated with the fishery, with a priority placed on strategies
to create and/or strengthen sustainable artisanal and small-
scale harvester organisations, organisations of
traditional/informal women fish processors/marketers,
consumer advocacy organisations, and environmental NGOs.
Ultimately, it is the strengthening of civil society in these areas
that will best guarantee that the interests of the poor are
brought forward and defended as coastal States develop
public policy for their fisheries.

25

4. Recommendations for Coastal States -
Pursuing an Alternative Model for Tuna
Fisheries Development

4.5 Recommendation #5: Reduce Fishing
Effort by 50% or More

States involved in global tuna fisheries as resource
renters / fishing nations should begin immediate
discussions to reduce fishing effort on all tuna stocks by
a minimum of 50% (or higher as per specific scientific
advice) in order to protect vulnerable stocks, ensure
sustainability of the fisheries over the long term and to
begin to increase the returns coastal States receive from
access agreements for tuna.

If global liberalisation is allowed to run its course, the likely
end point for coastal States involved in selling tuna access is
that most of them will become resource renters of skipjack.
The high capital costs to enter the seiner fishery put it out of
reach of most coastal State domestic investors and changes
to market access rules in the EU are threatening the
employment gains of those ACP coastal States that have
established significant tuna canning operations. In all
likelihood, tuna seining/canning will become the exclusive
domain of very low-cost Asian-crewed vessels delivering to
South East Asian canneries. Under this scenario, options for
coastal States to maximise returns from tuna, particularly from
skipjack, become narrower and narrower, unless coastal
States co-operate to develop their own sustainable industry.

The impact of skipjack seining on bigeye and yellowfin stocks
provides strong ecological and economic motivations for all
coastal States to begin reductions in that fishery. There also
appears to be a strong consensus that the over-capacity of
distant water tuna fleets is seriously reducing their profitability
and significantly reducing the potential returns to coastal
States from fees. Most economists agree that significantly
reducing fishing effort for tuna would significantly increase the
resource rents generated by these fisheries and increase the
ability of all coastal States to increase their income from
access fees. To do so, however, requires that coastal States
begin working together to develop a common front before
Distant Water Fishing Nations and in regional fisheries
management bodies to significantly reduce tuna fishing effort.

The benefits to coastal States of working together have been
demonstrated in the WCPO. Since the creation of the Forum
Fisheries Agency (FFA) in 1979, which was established to
enhance regional coastal State co-operation in fisheries,85
Pacific Island Countries have established a range of different
regional arrangements around common minimum standards
for foreign access. The FFA is a model that coastal States in
the Indian Ocean and West Africa, for instance, should
seriously examine to increase their co-operation around
foreign access to their tuna and other stocks. The ability to
overcome differences and work together around common
tuna access policies is fully within the grasp of coastal States.
However, it will require leadership and willingness to overcome
or ignore differences that might have divided them in the past.

Fish Aggregation Devices – the Final
Desperation of the Hungry Fleets

Skipjack tuna is caught almost exclusively by industrial
purse seiners, which have increased their efficiency
enormously in the last decade through a variety of
technological innovations. One of the most effective means
of locating and catching skipjack is through the use of Fish
Aggregation Devices (FADs), used extensively in the Pacific.
FADs are floating platforms, to which tuna are instinctively
drawn, that seine fleets place on the ocean surface. In
targeting skipjack that gather under FADs, seiners also
catch large amounts of immature bigeye and yellowfin,
which school together with skipjack. They may also scoop
up other associated marine life such as sharks and
unwanted fish species. The volume of this bycatch is
significant given the smaller size and greater vulnerability of
the bigeye and yellowfin stocks. The overcapacity and
increased efficiency of the seine fleet is putting the long-
term sustainability of the entire fishery in jeopardy. Based
on these concerns and the urgent need to reduce the
global tuna catches, Greenpeace is of the opinion that the
use of FADs for industrial tuna fisheries should be
universally and urgently banned.

For those coastal States with little capacity to develop their
own fishery-based industries, engaging in the resource renter
strategy may remain the only option. It is therefore essential
that access agreements are negotiated according to
principles and standards that safeguard sustainability, ensure
the maximum benefits to the coastal State (the custodian of
the resource for its people), and ensure that the risks arising
from overfishing, financial losses and socio-economic pitfalls
are minimised.

5.1 Coastal States Negotiating Access
Agreements as a Multilateral Block

As well as working together towards significant reductions in
fishing effort, coastal States would benefit from negotiating
access agreements as a multilateral block. When flag States
cannot play one coastal State against the others, it becomes
much easier to ensure a fair return for all countries involved
in the management, conservation and harvesting of the
resource.

Multilateral agreements can help the region to co-operate in
building an industrial base and enhancing sustainability. They
can also improve monitoring, control and enforcement, and
reinforce rather than undermine regional fishery agreements
such as RFMOs. Multilateral agreements are better able to
address regional fisheries measures and their implications
for financial compensation and other provisions.

5.2 Long-term Sustainability at the Core of
the Agreements

There is a real and obvious incentive to resist measures that
will directly or indirectly bring about reductions in financial
contributions. Reductions in effort or allocation could in fact
result in increased financial contributions, in particular where
they are accompanied by price increases in fish caught. This
must be allowed for in any agreement. Other less direct
measures, such as those aimed at the reduction of bycatch or
the protection of the ecosystem, should also be factored into
the agreement, so they are automatically implemented and so
that any reduction in effort or catch does not immediately
result in lower financial contributions.

A multilateral agreement must recognise that a reduction in
effort due to the state of the stock may not necessarily result
in a proportionate reduction in the financial contribution
payable. It should also recognise that necessary management
measures should be taken on scientific, legal and policy
grounds alone and not be held hostage to rigid financial
penalties. Close attention must be paid to linkages between
regional fisheries management agreements and access
agreements, to ensure that access agreements do not
hamper fisheries management.

Such an agreement must also restrict access in coastal zones
up to 30 miles in order to preserve artisanal and subsistence
fisheries and to preserve the fragile coastal ecosystem from
potential pollution and ecosystem disturbance by large
vessels and correctly address the enforcement issues. An
agreement should include a provision not to fish in
closed/protected areas.

A multilateral agreement should clearly recognise the inherent
threat to the sustainability of fisheries and ecosystems posed
by open access agreements, the need to maximise value from
fisheries - such as through the development of fishing
industries and value added to fish - and the critical need for
effective fisheries management regimes which are not
undermined by the access agreements.

27

5. Principles for Fair Tuna Fishing Agreements

5.3 Financial Compensation of Access
Agreements

The access fee should be negotiated on a multilateral basis;
should ensure that there is no incentive for overfishing; and
should contain a variable element predicated on the market
price of tuna: for example, an escalation clause should the
price of tuna increase significantly. A decrease in fishing effort
could lead to a substantial increase in resource rent states. If
even bigger and more precautionary effort reductions in the
global fleet are taken - for example, in the region of 50% as
recommended in this report - it is a very real possibility that
access fees paid to the coastal States could increase to the
region of 0% -50%86 of the value of the catch.

In addition, an agreement should insist on the compulsory
landing of fish, where practical and desirable, to facilitate the
development of a fishing industry, and should stipulate
specific requirements at the regional level for a minimum
number of local fisherman engaged on foreign fleets. An
agreement should also include provisions to ensure that local
populations (particularly women) benefit from new job
opportunities offered in the fisheries sector both offshore and
onshore and in related activities.

5.4 Monitoring Control and Surveillance
Requirements

Flag States must also provide, as part of their multilateral
agreements with coastal States, the means to ensure effective
enforcement of fisheries rules and regulations to ensure that
under-reporting, over-exploitation, and damage to marine life
does not occur. Training of fisheries officers, independent
observer coverage of all their vessels fishing in coastal State
waters, electronic catch diaries, and tamper proof VMS
systems should all be requirements as a part of doing
business. There should be close linkages to fisheries
management agreements.

Only vessels, companies, and nationals of flag States that are
in the regional lists of vessels in good standing (whitelist) and
have no ties to IUU (blacklist) should be permitted to join
coastal State fishery zones

5.5 Shifting the Economic and Ecological
Risks of Overfishing from the Coastal
State to the Flag State

While maximising the economic returns from tuna access by
significantly reducing effort and fishing capacity will reduce
pressure on vulnerable stocks, it will not alone guarantee that
tuna fishing will be sustainable. Under current tuna access
agreements, coastal States assume all the risks associated
with resource depletion as the fees they receive are based on
a percentage of the present-day cash-value of the estimated
catch taken by foreign fleets. Even when the fees paid by
foreign fleets are supplemented by additional government
transfers, as is the case with EU and US agreements, the total
amounts received by coastal States are not commensurate
with the impacts and risks of resource depletion.

As demonstrated time and again elsewhere in the world, the
social and economic costs of stock collapses as a result of
overfishing are catastrophic for coastal States, in terms of their
impacts on the local economy as well as political and social
stability and food security. This is especially so in many ACP
countries where the overwhelming majority of the coastal
population relies on subsistence fishing as a dominant source
of food. In most cases the importance of subsistence fishing is
not fully appreciated because its informal nature leads to
underestimates in the calculation of national accounts.
However, the reality is that the contribution of subsistence and
artisanal fishing to the economies of countries such as Papua
New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Cook Islands and Fiji is
estimated to be very large, and would require millions of dollars
to replace should the fish resources disappear.87

Greenpeace believes that fisheries access agreements present
huge food security and other socio-economic risks for coastal
States and that these risks need to be significantly reduced.
Access agreements need to safeguard sustainability and
mutually reinforce, rather than undermine, multilateral fisheries
agreements and arrangements. Therefore, flag States should
be the only formal parties to access agreements and other
arrangements that are currently negotiated by their fleets. No
private access agreements should be permitted.

28

Taking Tuna out of the Can: Rescue Plan for the World’s Favourite Fish

The “polluter pays” principle88 and the principle of State
responsibility mean that liability for damage done to fish stocks
and to the marine environment will need to be shifted to those
States which are responsible. Since the Trail Smelter case in
1937,89 international law is continuing to evolve to hold States
and operators responsible for such environmental damage,90
and States and operators should not assume that they will
escape liability for destruction of fish stocks and the marine
environment. As was stated in the Stockholm and Rio
Declarations,91 and as stated as a binding obligation in the
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), States have the
responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or
control do not cause damage to the environment of areas
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.92 As is stated in the
International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on State
Responsibility,93 every internationally wrongful act of a State
entails the international responsibility of that State, and it is
clear that Article 192 of UNCLOS provides for the obligation to
protect and preserve the marine environment.

5.6 Capacity Building and Development:

The ultimate objective of the coastal States being able to fully
benefit from their marine resources in the future should be an
integral part of any fair fisheries agreement. Using either a
portion of the access fees, or working capacity building and
development objectives into fisheries agreements requires
that additional access fees arrangements must be
incorporated for at least the following:94

• national/regional approaches to Sanitary and Phytosanitary

(SPS) measures and food safety issues.

• national/regional approaches to labelling and certification.

• development of infrastructure: e.g. harbour facilities for
fishing vessels, air freight facilities, and cold chain.

• Development of onshore processing activities and other

processing activities with higher added value (e.g. smoked
and peppered fish, etc).

• Training and technical capacity (harbour management,

MCS obligations, combating IUU, domestic industry, SPS
measures and developments, observer programs,
certification, good governance, etc).

• Monitoring, control and surveillance infrastructure to

eradicate IUU fishing.

• Upgrading of local vessels to allow them to conduct more
selective and sustainable fisheries, especially by reducing
bycatch of juvenile fish, already overfished species and
other endangered species such as sharks, turtles, and
sea birds.

Annex 1: Summaries of Historic Japanese
Tuna Access Agreements

Agreement between the Palau Maritime Authority and the
Fisheries Associations of Japan concerning the supply of
goods and services.

Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between
Government of Tuvalu and Federation of Japan Tuna
Fisheries Co-operative Associations

This two-page document signed by the parties in May/June of
1987 is an update of a 1986 MoU. It states simply that the
Federation shall make a single advance payment of
4,441,000 yen (US $38,000) for registration and licences for
ten pole and line vessels and three long-line vessels.
However, the agreement says the sum may be used to
purchase registrations/licences for either category of vessels
without restriction on the number of the specific types,
meaning many more than three long-liners could be operating
in the area. The agreement is for a one year period with no
other conditions attached

Memorandum of Agreement between the Palau Maritime
Authority and the Fisheries Associations of Japan
concerning fishing

This two-page agreement signed in 1987 is an interim
agreement. In the absence of a fisheries agreement called for
in the original MoU the parties agree to a single lump-sum
payment of 70,000,000 yen or US $611,00095 for the
purchase of 290 ‘permits’ for one year.96 They also agree to
allow payment for permits for vessels in excess of the 290
vessels according to a schedule of fees to be agreed to by
the parties. The agreement is signed by the Chairman of the
Palau Maritime Authority and Yamato Ueda, President of the
Federation of Japan Tuna Fisheries Co-operative Associations
along with the Presidents of three other Japanese industry
associations.

This agreement is a companion agreement to the fishing
agreement described above and signed on the same days by
the same parties. It states that “co-operation in the
development of fisheries of Palau will promote friendly
relations and fisheries co-operation between Palau and
Japan” and commits the Japanese associations to supply,
with the co-operation of the Overseas Fishery Co-operative
Foundation (OFCF), goods and services valued at 10,000,000
yen or US $87,000.97

Agreement between the Republic of Gambia and Japan Tuna
Fisheries Co-operative Associations and the Japan Far Seas
Purse Seine Fishing Association

This agreement, entered into by the parties on 28 July 1992,
allows for an unlimited number of Japanese purse-seiners
and long-liners to fish inside the Gambian 200 mile EEZ up
to 12 miles of the coast pursuant to the payments of fees
of US $1,000 per vessel for long-liners for three-month
licences (with the possibility of one or two-month extensions
for US $350 per month) and US $5,000 per purse seine
vessel for five-month licences. The only obligation is that of
maintaining daily catch records and of making “every effort” to
ensure that the daily catch reports for licensed vessels is sent
to the government of Gambia by mail within 30 days from
arriving in the first port of call after leaving Gambian waters.

Agreement Between Japan Far Seas Purse Seine Fishing
Association and Papua New Guinea

An agreement between the Japan Far Seas Purse Seine
Fishing Association and Papua New Guinea - a relatively
strong coastal State when it comes to negotiating access
agreements - in March 2007 demonstrates the striking
contrasts between these different generations of agreements
and coastal States of different size and strength. The
Association’s 2007 agreement with Papua New Guinea is
significant for several reasons. First, it marks the return of the
Japanese fleet to Papua New Guinea waters after a 19-year
exclusion.98 The new agreement, which provides access for
30 seine vessels for one year, contrasts with the sketchy two-
page agreements from the 1980s described in Annex 1 in
terms of its length (42 pages including annexes and
attachments), its details regarding the obligations of the
Japanese party and the fees paid.

In contrast with the earlier agreements, the latest Papua New
Guinea agreement contains several important provisions to
protect the interests of the coastal State. One of the most
significant is that it explicitly prohibits transshipment at sea,
instead designating specific ports where this can happen.99
If properly enforced, it will allow Papua New Guinea to
accurately determine how much fish the Japanese actually
catch under the agreement, enabling Papua New Guinea to
estimate the true value of the resource it has sold. This is
important information in the negotiations of subsequent
agreements and, provides critical input for scientific stock
assessment, when combined with other data.

The agreement makes payment of a $4,500 US observer fee
per vessel mandatory, outlines the observer programme and
places tight regulations and conditions on carrier and support
vessels entering and leaving the Papua New Guinea EEZ.
It obliges the Association to ensure that its vessel operators
maintain detailed, daily catch logs and file preliminary catch
reports within 14 days of completing a fishing trip. Japanese
fishing is also prohibited within 12 nautical miles from shore
and other specifically designated areas and Papua New
Guinea reserves the right to add additional exclusions to
protect existing fisheries and avoid conflict with locally-based
fishing operations. A further significant clause, in terms of
combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing
and supporting regional management initiatives, is that only
those vessels registered and in good standing with the Pacific
Islands Forum Fisheries Agency100 (FFA) are eligible to be
licensed under the agreement. In addition to individual licence
fees, the Association pays an access fee of US $101,250 per
vessel based on a formula of US $45 per tonne and an
average catch per vessel of 2,250 metric tonnes. The total
access fee is payable regardless of the number of vessels that
actually fish under the agreement. Based on the estimated
tonnage and catch value, the rate of return for this agreement
is 5.6% -slightly under the targeted 6% Papua New Guinea
aims to achieve with its access agreements. However, the
0.4% balance could be said to be made up through a
technical co-operation agreement that Papua New Guinea
subsequently signed with the Japan’s Overseas Fisheries
Co-operation Foundation.101

31

Annex 2

Annex 2.1: Comparing the EU’s Northern
and Southern Agreements

Assessments of the old generation EU fisheries access
agreements indicate significant differences between the
Northern and Southern Agreements in monetary and job
creation terms. Developing countries involved in the Southern
“pay-to-fish” Agreements clearly do not benefit as much as
those developed countries engaged in reciprocal agreements
with the EU (IFREMER).

During the 5-year period from 1994 to 1997 the reciprocal
(Northern Agreements) arrangements led to a more equitable
distribution of benefits with the EU than the Southern
Agreements.

• In terms of the combined direct and indirect value added,

€

176.15 million in benefits while the

the EU derived
northern third parties derived
156.47 million or a ratio
of 1 to 0.9 in favour of the EU. In other words, for every
1 in added value generated in the EU by the access to

€
its northern neighbours’ fish stocks, the northern
neighbours earned 90 Euro cents from their access to
community waters.

€

• This more even distribution of benefits is also reflected in
the employment generated by the Northern Agreements.
They generated a total of 6,365 direct and indirect jobs for
the EU and 7,404 for the northern parties or a ratio of 1.2
northern jobs created for every EU job.

A much more skewed distribution of benefits emerges from
the Southern pay-to-fish Agreements.

• The EU derived a total of

767.7 million in direct and
€
indirect added value benefits from the old-generation
Southern Agreements while the southern parties102 derived
117.36 or a ratio of 6.5 to 1 in favour of the EU.
only

€

• The employment ratios are similarly skewed in favour of

the EU. The Southern Agreements provided 14,182 direct
jobs (mostly seamen) for EU citizens but only 2,951 direct
jobs for citizens of the developing countries or a ratio of
almost five EU jobs for every job created in the country
that provides the access to its fishery. The job ratio falls
to 3.8 to 1, however, when calculating the distribution of
total jobs (indirect and direct) as the developing countries
were able to improve their situation by increasing their
employment share of downstream jobs in the fish canning
industry particularly from tuna.

Annex 2

Annex 2.2: Measuring Coherence: EU
Fisheries Agreements and Development

In 2001, the EU adopted a policy direction that called on it to
strengthen global fisheries governance and to develop a
partnership approach to fisheries agreements with developing
countries. Following this, the Board of EuropeAid, the EU’s
overseas development assistance arm, commissioned a
study to evaluate the overall coherence between its
development objectives and the EU’s fisheries agreements
at the time (old-generation).104

The study came to some damning conclusions:

• Under existing conditions (the old-generation) Fisheries
Agreements (FAs) and their related activities were not
sustainable nor did they provide reliable foundations on
which local economic activities could be based.

• In most of the coastal States, conditions for the

sustainable management of the stocks under the FAO’s
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries were not being
met, due to a weak commitment to ensuring sustainable
fishing practices by all the parties to the agreements.

• EU Member States were more interested in the short-term
profitability of their fleets than the long-term interests of
coastal States,

• Coastal States were mainly interested in maximising the
immediate foreign exchange receipts generated by
Fisheries Agreements, even at the risk of diminishing their
long-term prospects for growth and development. Coastal
States were found to lack the “financial, technical, human
and organisational capacities” to effectively control fishing
practices.

• The report found no significant evidence that Fisheries
Agreements directly contributed to food security and,
despite numerous references to developing local fishing
capacity, limited financial contributions to coastal State
fisheries development.

• There was no evidence that the UNCLOS provisions

regarding the determination of surplus fish resources were
being used to determine access, or indeed even that
coastal States were providing that information to assist
with sustainable resource management.

• An important weakness of the agreements was the

assumption that the coastal State was largely responsible
for sustainable management of the resources within the
EEZ despite the FAO Code of Conduct, which places
explicit responsibility on flag States for the conduct of their
vessels. The report could find no evidence of direct EU
Member State application of responsible fishing rules or
sanctioning of its fleets for violations of the Code of
Conduct but instead did find evidence of Member State
interventions to defend their fleets against coastal States’
attempts to sanction them.

• The report noted an increase from 11% to 41% in the

percentage of EU compensation paid to coastal States
that was tied to certain “targeted” activities aimed at
strengthening the coastal States’ fisheries management
capacity.105 This both ran counter to EuropeAid’s objective
of moving away from tied aid to providing money for
developing countries to use according to their own
priorities for poverty reduction, and was also at odds with
the principle that the compensation should in fact be
payment for the provision of a good i.e. access to a
country’s surplus fish stocks.

• The report also concluded that fisheries agreements with
non-EU countries reduced the pressure on the EU to
address its own fisheries management issues in its
domestic waters, an adverse outcome in light of EU
stocks being below safe biological limits.

In addition to its multilateral aspect another interesting feature
of the US agreement is the way in which the US payments are
distributed among the Pacific Island Countries. First of all,
both the US Government contributions and the fleet licence
fees are paid to the FFA, in effect the coastal States’ regional
fisheries body. After it deducts a US $500,000 administration
fee the FFA distributes the remaining funds in the following
way: US $2.5 million plus 15% of the remaining funds is
allocated equally to all Pacific Island Countries. The remaining
85% is allocated to individual members based on fishing effort
in their respective waters. This formula ensures that all states
benefit from the Treaty, creating an incentive to co-operate
amongst parties that do not have the same fishing interests or
potential. The Treaty is advantageous for the Pacific Island
Countries as it provides them with the highest return by far of
any access agreement under a secure, multi-year agreement.
It also had significant spin-off effects for employment in the
region as most of the US catch goes to supply two US-
owned canneries in American Samoa providing employment
for thousands of workers from nearby Western Samoa.

Annex 3: Details of the US Financial
Contribution

The different generations of the Treaty authorised between 35
and 50 licences for US seine vessels to fish in Pacific Island
Countries’ waters with vessel owners making lump sum
payments for licence fees. These payments increased from an
original US $1.75 million for 35 licences in 1988 to US $4
million for 50 licences in 1993 and were reduced to US $3
million for 40 licences in 2003. However, from the 2000-2001
fishing season onward, financial pressures on the US fleet
from reduced tuna prices, increased insurance costs after
9/11, soaring fuel costs and competition from lower-cost
Asian competitors reduced actual vessel take-up of the
fishing opportunities year after year so that by the 2006-2007
season only 12 US vessels were registered to fish in the
WCPO. This increased the financial burden for the lump-sum
licence fee payment on the remaining vessels in the fleet,
leading them to re-negotiate the terms of payment under a
side agreement with the Pacific Island Countries (and the
actual amounts paid will likely be reduced considerably).

However, the annual US Government payments under its
side agreement with the FFA have continued to increase from
US $10 million under the original agreement to US $18 million
under the current agreement that extends to 2013. This is an
enormously disproportionate contribution when one considers
that, all-told, between US $60 and US $70 million per year is
generated in access fees for WCPO coastal States. When the
industry licence fees of US $3 million are included, the US
Treaty represents over 30% of all access fee contributions.106
This is all the more remarkable considering the US seine fleet
has shrunk to only 12 seine vessels or just 6% of the 192
registered in the WCPO by the FFA.107 The US therefore is
contributing close to one-third of the total revenue derived
from access fees while contributing to only a fraction of the
fishing effort.108

being the Kingdom of Morocco’s agreement to “permit fishing vessels of

27 Tarte cites an example where a Japanese funded fishermen training centre
in Kiribati was a means of providing lower cost labour for the Japanese
skipjack fleets who were having difficulty both attracting young Japanese to
these difficult jobs, and were at a cost disadvantage with their Asian
competitors (Taiwan and Korea) because of higher Japanese wages. Tarte,

the one distant water fishing nation that used aid in this way. See Tarte, op.

made at the IWC since 1993. See Duncan Currie, “Whales, Sustainability

29 This report uses the term European Union (EU) to refer to the collective

organisation of the 27 European Union member states. However, please
note that it is formally the European Community (EC) that enters into
agreements with third countries, adopts legislation and is party to
international conventions.

30 The EU is required to be transparent about activities funded with public
monies due to public disclosure requirements unlike many other distant
water fishing powers. As a result, all the EU’s fisheries access/partnership
agreements are posted on the European Commission’s Directorate General
for Fisheries and Marine Affairs (DG Fish) website (see

32 This arrangement is often referred to as “pay, fish and go”, however

Greenpeace believes this characterisation is inaccurate since, in most
cases, the European fleets have become entrenched in coastal State
waters, paying and fishing but never going.

46 Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Islands

States and the Government of the United States of America, Port

A second side agreement between the US Government and the Forum
Fisheries Agency (FFA), the Agreement between the Government of the
United States of America and the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency,
describes the terms and conditions of the US Government’s financial
contributions to the FFA in conjunction with the treaty. The third
agreement, the Agreement among Pacific Island States concerning the
Implementation and Administration of the Treaty on Fisheries between the
Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the
United States of America, is between the FFA and the PICs and outlines
how the financial contributions of both the US and its fleets will be
distributed amongst the Pacific parties.

47 The agreement has been reviewed several times and was extended for
ten years to 14 June 2003 and then again to 2013. Each extension
brought an increase in fees: from US$12 million paid per year, to US$18
million to US$21 million per year. The number of licences was reduced to
45 in the most recent extension.

39 One of the clearest expressions of this policy commitment came from the
EU’s Council of Fisheries Ministers in July 2004 when it reaffirmed its
willingness “to maintain fisheries agreements as a means of protecting this
activity (distant water fishing) and the employment linked to the fleets
operating within these agreements because of their special nature and
their connection to regions which are highly dependent on fisheries”
(Council, 2004). While the Council indicated that its policy of promoting
distant water fishing must be consistent and coherent with the EU’s
various external commitments for sustainable resource use, it asserted
that fisheries access agreements provide “the best means of ensuring the
sustainable exploitation of surpluses” found in the waters of third country
Coastal States (Council, 2004).

In cases where a coastal State faces very high unemployment it could
chose instead to distribute resource rents in the form of access to new
entrants to the fishery rather than capturing the rents for itself to spend on
government programmes. For a discussion of how small-scale fleets
pursue this option in Canada see Allain, Private Rights Tragedy in

Independent cost and earnings surveys are the best means of determining
the rates of return generated by fleet operations and if rents are being
generated or not in a given fishery. Normally they are carried out by
governments on their domestic fleets under careful confidentiality
protocols that guarantee a fairly high level of confidence. Given that the
fleets operating in the WCPO are foreign it is difficult for PICs to carry out
these kinds of studies.

64 Barclay and Cartwright point out, however, that there can be hidden social
costs to attracting industrial fishing vessels and their crews to national
ports. After weeks, even months at sea, foreign crews often seek bars
and brothels to spend their earnings and relieve the tensions of living in
close quarters for long periods of time. They suggest coastal States have
to consider the social costs of these activities and provide alternative
shore-based social activities for those crew not interested in alcohol
consumption or prostitution (Barclay and Cartwright).

Ironically, the precautionary approach is in opposite from the current
practices of ICCAT contracting parties; in 2006, the management plan for
bluefin tuna set up a quota at a level which was double the one advised
by scientists and yet is called a 'recovery plan'.

agreement led to “very negative” impacts on the sustainability of hake, in
particular, leading to near biological collapse, and other negative fisheries
and ecosystem impacts. The report contrasted the benefits to private
fishing companies and fish workers with low net benefits to the Argentine
fiscal revenues and an “enormous social loss” of the resource for future
generations valued at US $ 3.5 billion. In the case of Argentina, UNEP
found that open access regimes, without control of the quantity of
resources fished and where the fish captured is not adequately paid for,
leads to over-exploitation where, in the long term, gains are outweighed
by losses. UNEP, “Integrated Assessment of Trade Liberalisation and
Trade-Related Policies: A Country Study on the Argentina Fisheries
Sector”, UNEP/ETB/2002/8, (2002), at

77 Whenever small-scale fisheries are mentioned, discussion all too often
turns into debate about vessel length and size. While vessel size and
length are important, from a conservation perspective, the selectivity and
ecological impact of the gear are much more so. Definitions of what
constitutes small-scale and/or artisanal is best determined by the
traditions and standards of local fisheries and the need to provide safe
and seaworthy vessels for fish harvesters given the different sea
conditions and distances they must confront to successfully harvest the
species they target. It is abundantly clear that, thanks to advances in boat
building and navigation technology over the last 30 years, there are few
fishery resources available within the EEZ of coastal States that are not
fully exploitable by domestic, small scale fleets however they are defined.
The endless and well documented conflicts over fishing grounds and
resources between domestic small-scale and artisanal fleets and their
industrial national and foreign rivals throughout the developing world is
ample proof of this.

76

In order to fish for the full range of tuna species, coastal small-scale fleets
may engage in some long-lining. Any such operations must use state-of-
the-art bycatch mitigation methods and be closely monitored to ensure
that their impacts on seabirds and other marine species are minimised
with clear cut-off limits once a certain number of such species have been
hooked.

79 While the many foreign fleets fishing in West Africa are thousands of

kilometres from their home ports the proximity of the Spanish Canary
Islands and its main port Las Palmas to fishing grounds make it both a
gateway into the EU and the main port of call for most DWF fleets
operating in the region.

96 The high number of permits is likely due to the Japanese preference for
short-term (monthly) access arrangements giving vessels the flexibility to
follow fish migrations in and out of coastal EEZs.

97 The OFCF is funded by the Japanese Fisheries Agency, and was

established to subsidise co-operation between Japanese distant water
fishing fleets or trading companies and coastal States. It has been used to
bypass bureaucratic red tape and facilitate projects, and it has specifically
been linked in the media to funding trips of Pacific and Caribbean officials
as part of Japanese lobbying efforts in the IWC.. See Sandra Tarte,

important tuna fishing grounds in the Pacific. However, the signing of a
multilateral fishing treaty by Pacific Island Countries (PICs) with the US in
1987 (see below) provided PICs with a 10 % rate of return on their tuna; a
sharp contrast with the 2-3 % rate they had been getting from Japan.
Buttressed by the US Treaty, PICs’ expectations of increasing their rate of
return from the Japanese and other agreements rose significantly. Papua
New Guinea, with a much more diversified economy and not dependent
on access fees for government income, was able to press the Japanese
much harder than other PICs to increase rates. Japanese unwillingness to
meet Papua New Guinea’s demands for higher fees effectively ended their
relationship (Tarte) and Papua New Guinea’s National Fishing Authority
placed an effective “ban” or “embargo” on Japanese fishing vessels that
lasted 19 years. (Pacnews)

99 The question of where transshipments can occur is not clear. Schedule 10
of the agreement lists the designated ports, all of which are in Papua New
Guinea, yet the agreement does not specify that transshipment must be in
a Papua New Guinea port and clause 23.2 says the Association “will
encourage its vessels to transship in Papua New Guinea ports as
appropriate….”
