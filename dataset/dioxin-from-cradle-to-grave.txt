What  Are  Dioxins?
Dioxins are a class of chlorine-containing 
chemicals widely recognized as some of the
most toxic chemicals ever made by humans.
They are produced as the unwanted 
by-products of industrial processes involving
chlorine or chlorine-containing materials such as
the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride plastic
(PVC); pesticide production; and pulp and paper
bleaching.  Dioxins are  also produced when
municipal, domestic and industrial wastes that
contain chlorinated materials, such as PVC, ar e
burned in incinerators, cement kilns, industrial
furnaces and boilers, open barrels and when
landfill fires occur.
Once released, dioxins accumulate in soils
and sediments and on vegetation, where they
are ingested or otherwise taken up by fish,
cattle, and other animals that serve as food
s o u rces. Consequently, dioxins are
concentrated in the meat, fish, dairy, and other
animal products that we eat.  As a further result,
dioxins contaminate the tissues, blood and
b reast milk of people in all industrialized
countries. In the U.S., the general population
already carries dioxin levels that are near the
levels where health effects may occur.  
In 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) finally classified the most potent
of the dioxins as a human car c i n o g e n ,
estimating a 1 in 1,000 risk to Americans from
cancer due to dioxin exposure. Dioxins are
associated with a wide range of other health
impacts including:
■  Altered sexual development
■  Male and female reproductive problems 
■  Suppression of the immune system
■  Diabetes
■  Organ toxicity
■  Altered sex ratio (reduced number of male       
offspring)
■  Mimicking or blocking the actions of 
hormones.Dioxins:  Here, There  and
Everywhere
Dioxins are unusually stable chemicals and do
not break down readily in the envir o n m e n t .
C o n s e q u e n t l y , they can be carried gr e a t
distances by air and ocean currents, circulating
through the global environment. Dioxins do not
dissolve readily in water, but do dissolve easily
in fats.  As a result, they build up in the fatty
tissues of living organisms, beginning with
simple creatures such as phytoplankton and
building up to higher levels as they are passed
up the food chain.  Animals at the top of the
food chain, such as people, and those with a
high fat content, such as whales, polar bears or
dolphins, generally carry the highest levels of
dioxins.
When an industrial facility disperses dioxins
into a nearby body of water, the dioxins
accumulate in the phytoplankton and other
small organisms in the water.  They build up to
higher levels in the small fish that feed on these
simpler organisms. Then, the small fish are
eaten by larger fish, which are then eaten by a
person. That person has unintentionally ingested
dioxins that have built up at each step in the
food chain. As people age, the buildup of
dioxins continues and the concentrations
become higher, so that health impacts are
potentially more serious.
The  Dirty  Dozen
Dioxins are among the first twelve Persistent
O rganic Pollutants (POPs) that have been
targeted for elimination by the impending global
POPs treaty because they constitute a serious
threat to human health. Other examples of POPs
a re PCBs (transformer fluids) and DDT (a
pesticide).
Given the transfer of technology fr o m
industrialized to newly industrialized nations, it is
crucial that the global POPs treaty includes
measures to discourage wealthy countries from
p romoting and exporting technologies that
generate dioxins, such as incineration.
Measures must also be included to encourage
wealthy countries and aid programs to assistG R E E N P E AC E

1newly industrialized countries in devising and implementing
programs to support the development of technologies that ar e
free of dioxins. Preventing dioxins from being generated in the
first place is the only real answer.
Major sources of dioxins requiring urgent action include:
■Production and disposal of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 
plastic
■Incineration (municipal, hazardous and medical waste)
■ Pulp and paper production that uses chlorine.
PVC Production, Use and Disposal
Taken as a whole, the production and disposal of PVC (or
vinyl)  plastic comprises one of the world’s largest sources of
dioxins. Dioxins are created when PVC is produced and when
it is burned in incinerators, open fires, landfill fires, etc. PVC is
one of the most common chlorine-containing products and is
found in many household items such as children’s toys,
shower curtains, miniblinds, flooring, and wall coverings. Its
production accounts for nearly 40 percent of all chlorine in the
United States (more than any other use of chlorine), is the
single most damaging of all plastics, and is the least
recyclable.  As the environmental and health costs of PVC ar e
recognized, it is important that practical alternatives are
demanded and made available.  The replacement of PVC by
a l t e r native materials appears to be highly favorable
economically.  For example, in a Canadian analysis, replacing
PVC with alternative materials was estimated to lead to a 15-
fold increase in domestic revenues and a 25-fold increase in
jobs.  
Effects of Dioxin
Recent research on the health effects from dioxins has shown
that there is serious concern for developing fetuses, children,adults and animals.  Exposure to dioxins begins at conception
and continues throughout fetal development, when
vulnerability is greatest. Exposure to dioxins prior to birth and
during early infancy can result in irreversible changes that
manifest in subtle but highly problematic effects such as
learning disabilities. Children are more vulnerable than adults
to many kinds of pollution and exposure to dioxins during
childhood can have lifelong effects.  Adults can also face the
threats of lung, skin and liver cancer, reduced sperm counts
and increases in other disorders of the reproductive organs.
These trends parallel the high incidence of tumors and
reproductive problems of animals exposed to dioxins.
Dioxin Source Elimination
Greenpeace is calling for a zero dioxin plan, which seeks to
eliminate dioxin sources, not just reduce dioxin releases. Due
to the persistent nature of these chemicals, the current global
build-up of dioxins will take years to decrease. 
The elimination of dioxin sources will have both positive
and negative economic impacts in the communities wher e
sources such as manufacturing and disposal facilities ar e
located.  To mitigate potentially negative economic impacts,
transition planning processes must be an integral component
of any strategy to eliminate dioxins. This process must be
guided by participation from labor, community and other
stakeholders and should seek to minimize the economic
effects of the transition and insure that costs and benefits ar e
equitably distributed. For instance, the Oil, Chemical, and
Atomic Workers Union proposed a tax on chlorine and related
chemicals; the revenue would be used to encourage
reinvestment in affected communities and to provide income
p rotection, continued health care, and meaningful
opportunities for higher education and reemployment for
workers and their families.

What You Can DoTaking Action
2
Avoid buying vinyl/PVC and other chlorine-containing
products whenever possible, and reduce your overall use
of disposable products.
Contact manufacturers of consumer products and find out
if their products contain PVC or other chlorine-containing
materials.  Demand alternatives.
Avoid burning household trash.  It often contains chlorine-
containing materials, such as PVC, which create dioxins
when burned.
Call on President Bush to support the global POPs treaty,
which is scheduled to be finalized in May 2000, at the
Stockholm Convention, and also urge him to seek U.S.
Senate ratification. 3
