1. Introduction 
Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradatio n (REDD) has moved 
firmly onto the agenda as the parties to the United  Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) approach the climate change 
negotiations at the Conference of the Parties (COP)  15 at Copenhagen in 
December 2009.  REDD is an option that could rapidly  and cost-effectively 
reduce GHG emissions and could also protect biodive rsity and benefit local and 
indigenous peoples. Furthermore, the engagement of the United States and 
others has heightened interest in, and debate about , the use of emissions offsets 
to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction  goals. 
In this paper we investigate the impact of implemen ting REDD in the context of 
a global effort to combat climate change.  Specific ally, we explore the effects of 
incorporating REDD in international carbon markets.  We expand on previous 
modelling efforts by simulating carbon market inter actions under expanded 
Annex I commitments which are aligned with the goal  of avoiding a greater 
than 2.0-2.4°C rise in global temperatures.  
Both policy makers and the general reader may find the implications for 
compliance costs, Annex I abatement and non-REDD off sets of particular 
interest.   Section 1 introduces the context of our  study.  Section 2 follows with a 
description of other relevant modelling efforts and  our chosen methodology. 
Section 3 presents high-level results while Section  4 opens discussion on some 
policy implications of our numerical findings.  Sec tion 5 concludes.  The 
appendix contains detailed numerical results. 
Context 
The human, economic, and environmental costs of eve n a 2°C rise in mean 
global temperatures have been assessed as substanti al.  The Stern review 
estimates the economic costs of climate change coul d exceed 20% of Global GDP 
(Stern 2006, 2008).  
The presence of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and other GHGs in the Earth’s 
atmosphere serve to regulate the Earth’s energy bal ance.  Increases in the levels 
of CO 2 and other GHGs will increase the amount of solar r adiation which will 
remain trapped in the Earth’s energy system and lea d to increased global 
temperatures.    

 
2 Human activities are causing the level of GHGs to r ise.  Fossil fuel combustion 
contributes approximately 28 Gt CO 2/yr and land-use change contributes 
another 5.5 Gt CO 2/yr.  The increased flux of CO 2 into the atmosphere is 
partially offset by increased absorption of carbon by the oceans (8.1 Gt CO 2/yr) 
and other ecosystems (10.3 Gt CO 2/yr), leaving an annual increase of 
approximately 15 Gt CO 2/yr (Canadell et al ., 2007).   
Land-use change, therefore, figures prominently in this equation.  Deforestation 
is by far the single largest source of land-use cha nge emissions. Lord Stern 
attributed deforestation with emissions in excess o f 8 GtCO 2/yr in 2000 (Stern 
2006).  These emissions are somewhat offset by abso rption through revegetation 
of cleared lands and reforestation.  
Deforestation emissions arise in a number of ways.  The largest source is the 
carbon dioxide which enters the atmosphere when the  carbon stored in trees 
(and other forms of vegetation) is released as a re sult of burning or as unburned 
organic matter decays over time.  Deforestation als o disrupts soil, particularly 
in peat forests, causing it to release a proportion  of its carbon stores into the 
atmosphere.   
The role of REDD 
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC), in order 
to have a medium likelihood of limiting global temp erature rise to 2.0-2.4°C, 
developed nations will need to reduce their emissio ns by between 25% and 40% 
from their 1990 levels by 2020 and to between 80% a nd 95% by 2050 (Gupta et 
al. , 2007). The IPCC also suggests that in addition to  developed country cuts, 
developing countries will also need to realise sign ificant reductions: a 15%-30% 
reduction versus baseline in 2020 (den Elzen and Hö ehne, 2008). 
With deforestation emissions representing up to 20%  of anthropogenic 
emissions (Schlamadinger et al ., 2007), REDD has been heralded as being 
instrumental to developing the scale of reductions necessary to limit the 
increase in global temperatures to 2°C.  At the sam e time, proponents note 
investments in protecting tropical forests could ri chly reward biodiversity 
protection and improve livelihoods. 
What remains clear is that it is critical for the o verall effort to mitigate the 
harmful effects of climate change that significant reductions in deforestation are 

 
3 required by the year 2020 to provide a reasonable c hance of global temperature 
remaining below 2°C (Norway, 2008). 
REDD design issues 
Most REDD proposals identify global funds or emissio ns trading markets (or 
both) as preferred sources of funding. 1 
Market advocates cite the advantages of economic ef ficiency and the ability to 
mobilise the large amounts of capital. Advocates of  funds emphasise the 
potential impacts of integration with emissions mar kets such as volatility, a 
reduced carbon price signal, and the substitution o f low-quality units for higher 
quality ones. 
Some proponents propose intermediate options that s eek to avoid the problems 
of REDD integration with the broader carbon market b ut that could provide 
greater capital mobilisation than through a traditi onal fund.  For example, the 
dual markets approach from the Center for Clean Air  Policy attempts to 
leverage the power of market driven investment allo cation while avoiding 
complications of direct integration into global com pliance markets (Ogonowski 
et. al., 2007).  Similarly, the hybrid Tropical Def orestation Emission Reduction 
Mechanism (TDERM) proposal by Greenpeace specifies t he creation of a special 
unit, the Tropical Deforestation Emission Reduction Unit (TDERU), which 
would represent both emissions abatement and other ecosystem services.  
Developed nations would take on requirements to pur chase TDERUs as part of 
their overall emission reduction commitments (Hare and Macey 2007; Thies and 
Czebiniak, 2008). 
Measurement accuracy, non-permanence issues, and le akage are some of the 
numerous complications that must be addressed in de signing a REDD 
mechanism.  Measurement difficulties include the di fficulty of establishing the 
precise area and carbon content of forests and acco unting for inter-annual 
variation of deforestation rates.  As most proposal s provide for an incentive 
payment for reductions in the rates of deforestatio n, it is important to be able to 
accurately identify what the deforestation rate wou ld have been to avoid the 
generation of “hot air” (a situation where compensa tion will be paid for

4 Box 1: Notes on the 2˚C target assumption  
For the purpose of this report we have focused on e missions reductions consistent with the goal of 
maintaining a medium likelihood of keeping the glob al average temperature rise limited to 2˚C.  How 
do we assess what reductions are necessary to meet this goal?  (See Box 2 in the references section fo r 
a selection of relevant sources.) 
Hare and Meinshausen (2006) aggregated the results from 11 global climate models and developed a 
probabilistic representation (Figure 1) which shows  that a 450 ppm CO 2-eq stabilisation level is 
required for a medium likelihood of reaching the 2˚ C goal.

The IPCC, in Box 13.7 of the IPCC 4 th  Assessment Working Group III report (Figure 2)(IPC C 2007), 
delineated its estimates of what emission reduction s would be required to limit the atmospheric 
concentration of GHGs to 450 ppm CO2-eq.

Notes:  
a The aggregate range is based on multiple approache s to apportion emissions between regions (contracti on and convergence, 
multistage, Triptych and intensity targets, among o thers).  Each approach makes different assumptions about the pathway, specific 
national efforts and other variables.  Additional e xtreme cases – in which Annex I undertakes all redu ctions, or non-Annex I 
undertakes all reductions – are not included.  The ranges presented here do not imply political feasib ility, nor do the results reflect 
cost variances.

Meinshausen, 2006).  
  

 
5 reductions that would have occurred anyway).  Leaka ge would arise if 
deforestation is reduced in one country or region, but consequently increases in 
another area due to the continued presence of deman d for timber or arable land 
or a shifting of extractive capital. 
If REDD is to be included in an international agreem ent, it is critical to ensure 
the environmental integrity of any REDD activities, while providing incentives 
for investment in a viable source of emissions redu ctions.  Failure to achieve 
both of these objectives carries a risk of falling short of our goal of keeping 
global temperature rise as low as possible. 
Toward some clarity 
This study evaluates the wholesale integration of RE DD into global carbon 
markets.  Partial integration, parallel markets, or  dual-market scenarios are not 
addressed in this study. 
We focus on activity levels inline with the overall  goal to keep the global 
temperature increase to below 2˚C.  To maintain rel evance to this goal, we 
simulate a range of emissions reduction commitments  consistent with the 2˚C 
target. We also analyse commitment levels consisten t with recently stated 
national emissions reduction targets.   
We explore the dynamics of market integration in th e year 2020.  The study 
provides information on relative investment levels,  price impacts, financial 
transfers, and net economic benefit for the Annex I  region, Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM) regions, and REDD regions.  Although  serious qualitative 
questions have been raised about potential REDD cred its, as well as for the 
CDM, the quality of all reductions is assumed to be  equivalent for the purposes 
of simulating market interactions. 
 
2. Modelling of REDD carbon market interactions  
2.1 Previous work 
Anger and Sathaye (2008) investigated the detailed implications of integrating 
REDD into international carbon markets utilising a m ulti-region, partial 

 
6 equilibrium model.  They predicted international ca rbon prices could roughly 
halve in 2020 if REDD credits were provided full acc ess to carbon markets. 
Anger et al. (2009) expanded on the assumptions of the Anger and  Sathaye 
work.  Policy scenarios with supply and demand rest rictions on REDD credit 
trading were added. The impact of increased commitm ent levels and sensitivity 
to REDD credit supply were also explored.  The study  found that if there were 
no restrictions on access of REDD credits to emissio ns markets, Annex I 
emissions would need to be capped at approximately 23% below 1990 levels 
(60% lower than business-as-usual) in order to avoi d a reduction in the 
international carbon price. 
The Eliasch review, released at the end of 2008, al so modelled the impacts of 
incorporating REDD units in international carbon mar kets.  The review 
integrated updated estimates of deforestation oppor tunity costs from GCOMAP 
(Generalized Comprehensive Mitigation Assessment Pr ocess, Sathaye et al. , 
2008) into the United Kingdom Office of Climate Cha nge Global Carbon 
Finance Model (GLOCAF) model.  The review concluded  that, if 
supplementarity limits are utilised, introducing RED D has a minimal impact on 
the overall price of carbon.  The report concludes that supplementarity 
requirements are sufficient to prevent adverse carb on price impacts due to the 
existence of a large supply of similar cost mitigat ion within Annex I economies 
(Eliasch, 2008). 
The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) utilised a spr eadsheet model to 
investigate the impact of REDD unit imports on compl iance markets in the 
European Union and the United States.  Under the ED F’s model, the use of 
REDD credits reduces the permit price by approximate ly 13%, compared with 
Anger et al. ’s estimate of a 45% decrease in the international permit price.  The 
unlimited banking of REDD credits is a key policy as sumption of the EDF 
model.  Banking is incorporated by equalising the r eal price of carbon over time 
using a 5% discount rate (Cabezas and Keohane, 2008 ). 
Estimates for the quantity of emissions reductions that can be delivered from 
REDD vary, as do the estimates of the cost of reduct ions.  Comparison amongst 
the modelling results can be problematic, however, as assumptions are often 
inconsistent.  For example,   Sathaye et al.  (2008) calculate the total baseline 
deforestation for 2020 as 4.5 GtCO 2-eq per year.  This figure is somewhat less 

 
7 than the 5.8 Gt CO 2-eq emitted from deforestation activities since 199 0 
according to the IPCC (2007).  The EDF study adopte d baseline deforestation 
data from the Energy Modeling Forum 21 (2003) which  identifies baseline 
emissions of between 1.5 and 2.8 Gt CO 2-eq due to tropical deforestation in 
2020.    
2.2 Modelling approach 
Following from Anger & Sathaye (2008) and Anger et al. (2009), we utilise a 
numerical partial equilibrium model of the global c arbon market in the year 
2020 to quantify the carbon market impacts of integ rating reduced deforestation 
credits.  The model enforces a balance between the supply and demand for 
emissions reductions in an international, post-2012  compliance market.  
The demand for emissions reductions in the model is  constant and equivalent to 
the net global emissions reduction commitment for t he post-2012 period.  
The model employs marginal abatement cost functions  based on energy-system 
data.  Marginal abatement cost functions for REDD ar e integrated into the 
model by treating tropical rainforest areas as expl icit model regions. Within this 
model framework, developing countries may export em issions reduction credits 
from reducing deforestation to Annex I regions via the global carbon market. 
In order to maintain consistency with previous work , energy intensive and non-
energy intensive sectors for Annex I and CDM region s are incorporated into the 
model independently.  
A partial equilibrium model has been selected based  on the ability of such 
models to represent the specific institutional char acteristics of the future carbon 
market and explicitly incorporate marginal abatemen t cost functions.  This 
approach facilitates an explicit analysis of carbon  price development, regional 
emission reductions and carbon credit flows emergin g from alternative climate 
policy regimes. 
The modelling thus represents a transparent approac h that allows simulation 
results to be easily interpreted by policy makers.  A file containing the model 
code which can be used to replicate the results of this paper is available for

Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) format.2  
2.3 Scenarios  
Commitments 
We focus on quantifying REDD’s impact on efforts to limit the increase in 
average global temperature to a 2˚C range.  The bas e case assumes 
commitments are equivalent to publicly stated targe ts as of December 2008.  In 
percentage terms, our base case represents a 12.1% global reduction versus 
business-as-usual emissions in 2020, but a 34% incr ease from 1990 levels.   
The other commitment levels modelled are within the  range of a 25% to 40% 
reduction in Annex I emissions (compared to 1990 le vels) recommended by the 
IPCC as necessary to avoid a greater than 2.0-2.4˚C  rise in global temperatures 
(see Box 1).  Aggregate Annex I reductions of 25%, 30% and 40% versus 1990 
levels are modelled. 3    
Policy variables 
The carbon market is first simulated without REDD cr edits to establish a 
reference case.  Integration of REDD units without r estriction is then studied.  
Demand restrictions – or supplementarity requiremen ts – are simulated in the 
model.  Twenty percent and 50% supplementarity requ irements 4 were chosen 
for analysis. 
Our simulation assumes that the CDM will continue, in its current form, into 
the post-2012 period.  Furthermore, it is assumed t hat there are no restrictions 
on the integration of CDM units into the global car bon market. 
It is also assumed that REDD credits are either dire ctly fungible in the 
international compliance market or they are widely integrated into regional

more information on GAMS. 
3  For the purposes of this paper, a “25% reduction target” will refer to a 25% reduction in Annex I em issions versus 1990 
levels.  The same convention is used for 30% and 40 % reduction targets. 
4  For the purposes of this study, a 20% supplementa rity requirement refers to limiting Annex I import of REDD credits to 
20% of Annex I mitigation requirements with respect  to the baseline.  By contrast, in the Second Phase  of the EU ETS, 
imports of Joint Implementation (JI) and CDM credit s were limited to 13% of a region/sector’s emission s cap.  For the 
Third Phase, a proposal has been made to allow up t o 50% of any increases in commitments to be met by JI or CDM 
credits. See European Commission (2008). 

 
9 emissions trading schemes and it is therefore possi ble to abstract to global 
trading.  
Sensitivity 
The supply and cost of REDD credits can and is highl y uncertain.  Natural 
effects (such as drought, fire or pests), agricultu ral prices, and land-use policy 
can greatly affect the rate of deforestation and co nsequently the supply of 
REDD credits to the international market.   
The design of a REDD mechanism may also influence th e supply of REDD 
credits to the market.  For example, if a REDD mecha nism’s baselines were set 
higher than our modelled baseline, the supply of RED D credits would expand.  
Conversely, if a REDD mechanism led to discounting o f REDD credits, or if it 
involved strict quality measures which limited part icipation, the resulting 
REDD supply could be much less than we model.  Due t o these factors which 
contribute to uncertainty of supply, we tested sens itivity around REDD supply.

10 2.4 Key assumptions 
The regional grouping applied to the model framewor k is shown in Table 2.  
While the model calculates abatement for each of th e regions separately, we 
have aggregated the demand for emissions reductions  credits from Annex I 
countries.  This allows the total Annex I commitmen t level to be adjusted 
without explicitly determining a burden sharing arr angement for each scenario.

Historical carbon emissions and baseline data used in the simulation are shown 
in Table 3 in Appendix A. The baseline projects glo bal emissions to increase 
52.4% between 1990 and 2020.   
The MAC functions employed in the model for the Ann ex I and CDM regions 
are taken directly from Anger et al. (2009).  The functions take the form of third-
degree polynomials based on results from simulation s by the energy system 
model POLES (Criqui et al , 1999).  POLES explicitly models energy technology  
options for emissions abatement in various world re gions and sectors. In the 
POLES simulations a sequence of carbon taxes was im posed on the respective 
regions to identify sectoral emissions abatement.  Following Böhringer et al. 
(2005), the coefficients for MAC functions in 2020 are estimated by an ordinary 
least squares (OLS) regression of marginal abatemen t costs and associated 
emissions abatement. Table 4 in Appendix A shows th e MAC coefficients by 
region and sector in 2020. 
MAC functions for reducing deforestation are genera ted by applying a similar 
methodology as above to results obtained from the G COMAP model.  Net 
carbon stock changes are established by applying a sequence of carbon prices 
(here: 5 to 100 US$ per ton of carbon) to the rainf orest regions within the 
GCOMAP model.  Table 5 (in Appendix A) illustrates the MAC coefficients for 

 
11 avoided deforestation for the four tropical regions  in 2020. Departing from 
Anger et al. (2009), we have utilised updated GCOMAP data from S athaye et al. 
(2008) which was incorporated in modelling for the Eliasch review.  As 
mentioned above in Section 2.1, Sathaye et al . estimated a baseline emissions 
level of 4.5 GtCO 2/yr from deforestation in 2020. 
3. Modelling results and assessment 
3.1 Results and assessment for current commitments 
The carbon market simulation of our base case, whic h allows the import of 
CDM offset credits to meet publicly stated targets,  yields a carbon price of 16.0 
€/tCO 2.5 Introducing REDD credits without restriction reduce s the international 
price of carbon 61% to 6.2 €/tCO 2.  A previous study obtained carbon prices of 
15.7 €/tCO 2 and 8.6 €/tCO 2 respectively for these scenarios (Anger et al. 2008).   
Abatement 
Figure 3 illustrates the relative scale of share of  abatement between Annex I and 
offset sources across the scenarios for current com mitments. It shows a 57% 
reduction in Annex I domestic abatement when REDD is  introduced into the 
carbon market without restriction under the REDD_CUR scenario.  As the total 
emissions reduction is fixed for these scenarios, i ntroduction of REDD imports 
displaces domestic Annex I emission reductions and exports from the CDM 
regions.  Forty-six percent of the REDD volume subst itutes Annex I domestic 
abatement and the remaining 54% substitutes CDM cre dits. 
Application of supplementarity restrictions increas es domestic abatement by 
restricting the import of REDD credits.  Demand is l imited, yet each rainforest 
region is unrestricted in bringing REDD credits to m arket.  This leads to a price 
separation between the clearing price for REDD credi ts (2.1 €/tCO 2) and the 
international carbon price (12.6 €/tCO 2) when 20% supplementarity is applied to 
REDD trading under current targets. 
While the supplementarity approach would increase b oth the international 
carbon price and domestic abatement, a 20% suppleme ntarity limit would result 
in 33% of the deforestation reductions achieved und er the unrestricted scenario.  
                                                 
 
5  Carbon prices in this report should be considered  representative and useful for comparison between s cenarios rather than 
as a prediction for the actual price of carbon in t he year 2020. Carbon prices are in 2005 euros.  

 
12 Assuming an average biomass value of 250 t-CO 2/ha 6, this equates to a 
difference of 5.5 million hectares of deforestation  annually.

Environmental impact 
For the purposes of our simulation, we assume that the rules for REDD 
mechanisms effectively address environmental integr ity issues with REDD 
credits.  Provided the emissions reductions associa ted with a REDD credit are 
actually equivalent to those associated with domest ic Annex I reductions, the 
net flux of CO 2 into the atmosphere in 2020 would be equivalent un der each 
scenario.  If REDD credits were less representative of actual emissions 
reductions than comparable Annex I or CDM units, ho wever, then more CO 2 
would be emitted to the atmosphere under any of the  REDD scenarios than in 
the case without REDD integration. 
Compliance costs and financial transfers 
Compliance costs 7 generally decrease for Annex I as the price of car bon 
decreases.  In the case of full REDD fungibility, An nex I compliance costs 
decrease 54% with the introduction of the additiona l supply of offsets. While 
                                                 
 
6  This value corresponds to the average biomass val ue for Africa used in the GCOMAP model (Sathaye et al. 2008). 
7  Compliance costs are defined as the cost of domes tic abatement plus the net import of carbon credits  times the price of 
carbon  and the net import of REDD credits times th e REDD price. (*)  Abatement shown versus baseline (business-as-u sual) CDM REDD A  I

13 the simulations show that the scenario with the low est net global compliance

I is the 50% supplementarity scenario.  This is bec ause supplementarity allows 
Annex I to pay less for low-cost REDD abatement than  for abatement from 
other sources which receive the full international carbon price (see Figure 4).8

3.2 Results and assessment for expanded commitment scenarios 
Our numerical simulation of the global compliance c arbon market in the year 
2020 shows, as expected, increasing carbon price an d compliance costs as 
increasing emissions reductions commitments are ado pted.  Without 
integrating REDD, the price of carbon increases from  16.0 €/tCO 2 for currently 
stated targets to 47.8 €/tCO 2 if Annex I nations collectively cap emissions 40% 
below 1990 levels.   
Introduction of REDD credits to the international ca rbon market reduces the 
price of carbon by 59% under the 25% reduction targ et (from 29.4 € to 11.9 €) 
and by 57% under a 40% reduction target (from 47.8 € to 20.4 €).

15 Figure 6  Abatement by source, expanded commitments 
 
As with our analysis of currently stated emissions reductions targets in Section 
3.1, the introduction of REDD under expanded targets  reduces both Annex I 
domestic abatement and abatement in CDM regions.  U nder the 25% reduction 
target, Annex I domestic abatement drops by 53% whe n REDD credits enter the 
market with no restrictions, while CDM abatement fa lls by 55%.  With a 30% 
reduction target the corresponding abatement reduct ions are 51% and 50% 
respectively. 
As emissions reductions commitments deepen, both An nex I domestic 
abatement and CDM abatement regain share as inexpen sive REDD options are 
exhausted and deforestation is virtually halted in Africa and Central America.  
Under the 40% reduction scenario, both CDM and Anne x I domestic abatement 
are reduced by 46% with the introduction of REDD com pared to the no-REDD 
case. (*)  Abatement shown versus baseline (business-as-u sual) Abatement * in 2020 (Mt-CO 2)

16 Environmental impact 
In Section 3.1 we discussed the potential environme ntal impact of introducing 
REDD into the international carbon market from the p erspective of comparative 
unit quality.  Here we discuss the effectiveness of  incorporating REDD into the 
carbon market for reducing or halting deforestation  under the various 
scenarios. 
Supplementarity restrictions significantly impact t he amount of deforestation 
which can occur through a market-based mechanism.  As seen in Figure 7, our 
simulations show that nearly 82% of deforestation c an be avoided in 2020 if 
Annex I emissions are capped at 40% of 1990 levels and REDD credits are 
accepted into the international carbon markets.  Li miting the import of REDD 
units into the market to 20% of Annex I’s required reductions from baseline 
results in only 16% of the baseline deforestation b eing avoided.

17 Compliance costs and financial transfers 
Expanded commitments by Annex I nations are accompa nied by higher 
compliance costs.  This is a result of not only a g reater requirement for emission 
reductions, but a higher marginal cost for each uni t.  Furthermore, as lower-cost 
domestic abatement is exhausted, a greater percenta ge of emissions reductions 
occur outside Annex I, resulting in significant fin ancial transfers.  
As shown in Figure 8, total Annex I compliance cost s under the base case 
without REDD are 41.7 billion € per year.  These cos ts increase more than three-
fold to 123.9 billion € with a target of 25% below 1990 levels.  At 40% below 1990 
levels, compliance costs increase more than six fol d to 276 billion € per year. 
Figure 8  Annex I compliance costs and related transfers – ex panded commitments 
 
3.3 Sensitivity to REDD supply 
The variability in the availability of REDD units is  a substantial risk for 
including REDD in the international carbon market.  Oversupply could collapse 
prices (for example, the EU ETS experience) and aff ect longer term investment 
in abatement programmes.  An unexpected undersupply  of REDD units could 
leave a large pool of demand chasing the few mitiga tion sources which are able 
to respond to price signals, resulting in high pric es.   29.1 87.8

18 We simulated the impact of an oversupply situation and an undersupply 
situation in order to ascertain if the results were  robust to these variations.  The 
undersupply situation was represented in the model by reducing the supply of 
REDD credits for any given price to 50% of the base amount.  The oversupply 
scenario was simulated by doubling the number of un its supplied at each price 
for each region.  
For currently stated targets, unlimited REDD trading  and the high REDD credit 
supply case, our simulations show a 75.7% price dec rease from 16.05 €/tCO 2 to 
3.9 €/tCO 2.   Should half as many REDD credits be delivered at a given price as 
in our model, the market clearing price with REDD an d currently stated targets 
increases 43% from 6.2 €/tCO 2 to 8.9 €/tCO 2.   
The large market share of REDD units, combined with the effective elasticity of 
demand for REDD credits, leaves the overall market p rice susceptible to 
significant price volatility should such large supp ly variations occur. 
For the 40% reduction targets, unlimited REDD tradin g and the high REDD 
credit supply case, our simulations show a 70.62% p rice decrease from 47.76 
€/tCO 2 to 14.03 €/tCO 2. (an additional 31% price decrease from 20.4 €/tCO 2 to 
14.0 €/tCO 2 compared to our base scenarios).  If half as many REDD credits are 
delivered, the market clearing price with REDD and c urrently stated targets 
increased 17% from 20.4 €/tCO 2 to 24.0 €/tCO 2.  The relatively small increase in 
price with the lower REDD supply level is due to the  fact that, under our 
normal REDD supply assumptions and 40% reduction tar gets, deforestation 
had halted in Africa and Central America leaving mo re expensive regions to set 
the clearing price. 
Partial sensitivity results are shown in Table 11 i n Appendix B. Detailed 
sensitivity results are available at www.kea3.com/reddmodelling . 
4. Policy Implications  
Our simulation assesses a range of commitments cons istent with targeting a 
maximum 2 °C rise in global mean temperature.  It evaluates th e impact of the 
integration of REDD credits into the international c arbon market in the year 
2020.  As we have shown in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, th e anticipated supply of 
REDD credits will depress global carbon prices aroun d 60% if commitments are 
not increased or if there are no supplementarity re strictions. 

 
19 Our simulations explicitly show displacement of Ann ex I domestic abatement in 
all scenarios where REDD is included in the market.  This displacement occurs 
because REDD activities can generate credits at a lo wer cost than some CDM or 
Annex I domestic abatement activities.  This flows through to a lower overall 
carbon price. 
While our model does not explicitly assess feedback  effects resulting from the 
inclusion of REDD in the carbon market, the predicte d changes to the price of 
carbon can allow us to discern at a qualitative lev el what some of these effects 
may be. 
A lower overall net abatement cost may lead to grea ter levels of overall 
consumption relative to the base case (rebound effe ct) in both the developed 
world (which benefits from reduced compliance costs ) and the offset regions 
(which benefit from increased financial inflows).  The overall net abatement cost 
reduction will be partially offset by increases in agriculture and timber prices 
due to restrictions on the supply of arable land an d unsustainable timber 
extraction as a result of REDD activity. 
The reduction in global carbon price levels will re duce incentives to invest in 
low emissions technology and infrastructure.  For e xample, the expectation of a 
low carbon price could increase the attractiveness of a coal-fired power plant.  
Once an investment has been made in high emissions infrastructure, capital 
costs are sunk and users are likely to accept large  increases in carbon prices (or 
lobby against their imposition) before upgrading to  cleaner technologies (lock-
in effect). 
Clean technology is expected to develop faster unde r a high-carbon price 
scenario as compared to a low carbon price scenario .   For example, the IPCC 
found that in order to have a medium likelihood of staying within the 2.0-2.4 °C 
range (stabilisation between 445 and 490ppmv CO2-eq ) the price for carbon 
would need to be in the range of € 80/tCO 2-eq (US$100) (IPCC AR4 WGIII, Chap 
3 at 205-206).  Staying below 2 °C would therefore require an even stronger 
carbon price signal.  
It can be expected that as clean technology evolves  in the developed world it 
will permeate to the developing world, leading to e missions reductions versus 
the baseline.  The speed and magnitude of this tran sfer will vary by region and 

 
20 technology.  The relative expense and difficulty in  financing capital investments 
in the developing world can slow technology transfe r (Sathaye and Phadke, 
2006).  On the other hand, some technologies enable  less capital-intensive 
development pathways and may even be adopted more r eadily in developing 
nations. 9  In either case, delayed development of clean tech nologies will drive 
development along a higher-carbon path. 
Windfall profits 
The potential for REDD to generate large emissions reductions at a low cost 
relative to other mitigation options will make some  REDD activities highly 
profitable if REDD credits are sold on the internati onal carbon market at the 
international carbon clearing price. 
Figure 9 shows the size of the profits for the Afri can rainforest region (solid 
green) relative to the profits of other offset regi ons.  Our model shows that 
Africa is the primary beneficiary of REDD because of  the extensive low 
marginal abatement cost opportunities there.  While  an unrestricted REDD 
regime would result in large profits earned by REDD nations, limiting the 
REDD price through supplementarity requirements limi ts profits but would 
result in smaller reductions in deforestation.

9 The telecommunications sector is an example of whe re this might occur. Developing nations moved direc tly to wireless 
and fibre optic technologies, sidestepping expensiv e investments in extensive copper wire networks.  A t the same time, 
many developed nations still maintained existing in vestments their copper networks. 11.9 37.9

In our simulations, deforestation in Africa is comp letely halted under the 30% 
and 40% reduction target scenarios that involve unr estricted REDD imports.  
Continued increases in the REDD price will add to th e economic benefit of the 
African region without generating additional mitiga tion.  Mechanism designers 
may seek to limit producer surplus in such situatio ns and re-allocate resources 
to other areas.  
Large international transfers may lead to significa nt feedback effects.  As 
developing nations acquire wealth, consumption may increase, resulting in an 
increase in emissions within economies that are not  subject to emissions caps. 
Interests of purchasers and other suppliers of unit s 
The integration of REDD units into the global carbon  market in any form affects 
the interests of both purchasers and other supplier s of emission units.   
With the introduction of REDD into the carbon market , CDM regions face 
competition for the supply of units and therefore w ould suffer a reduction in 
net economic benefit.  Depending on the future of t he CDM programme, these 
losses can be sizable.  Our simulations suggest Chi na’s loss under unlimited 
REDD fungibility with stated commitments exceeds € 1 0 billion in 2020. 
Addressing environmental concerns with REDD 
If REDD mechanisms could be developed that would ass ure that the REDD 
credits generated were environmentally equivalent t o emissions reductions 
from other sectors, the most economically efficient  outcome would result from 
unrestricted trading of REDD credits in the global c arbon market.  At present, 
such assurances about environmental quality of REDD credits cannot be made, 
however.   
Given the as-of-yet unsolved issues of leakage, per manence, and baseline 
selection, conservative approaches to integrating RE DD credits into the carbon 
market may be preferable. 
5. Conclusion 
REDD has the potential to deliver large emissions re ductions and to reduce 
compliance costs.  REDD also has the potential to de liver emissions reductions 

 
22 in the short and medium term and thus is fundamenta l to achieving the 
dramatic emissions reductions necessary by 2020.  
There are several options available to policy maker s for incorporating REDD in 
the overall approach to combating climate change.  In this paper we evaluated 
the impact in 2020 of the integration of REDD units into the international carbon 
market together with emissions reductions consisten t with the IPCC’s 
recommendations for achieving a medium likelihood o f limiting global 
warming to 2 °C.  
Focusing on the upper end of the IPCC’s recommended  emissions reductions (-
40%), we found that providing REDD unrestricted acce ss to the carbon markets 
would reduce tropical deforestation by 82% overall and reduce compliance 
costs by 49%, at the cost of lowering the price of carbon by 57% percent.   
In all of our simulated scenarios, the integration of unrestricted REDD credits 
into the international carbon market displaces othe r emissions reduction 
activities such as Annex I domestic abatement.  It is also likely to discourage the 
development of clean technologies through a weaker price signal. 
Additionally, our simulations show the unrestricted   integration of REDD will 
halve the production of credits relating to energy and industrial emissions 
reductions in China, India and other developing cou ntries which could 
significantly delay the deployment of clean technol ogies in these regions. 
However, it is unclear if, in the absence of the co st-moderating effects of REDD, 
the ambitious goals proposed by the IPCC will be ag reed.  Significant financing 
for REDD will therefore need to be raised in a manne r that allows for the 
maximum overall emission reductions and does not ov erly reduce or delay 
necessary investments in clean and renewable techno logies in both developed 
and developing countries.

Box 2: References on the 2˚C target assumption  
For the purposes of this report we have focused on a range of emissions reductions for Annex I 
parties consistent with the goal of maintaining a m edium likelihood of keeping the global average 
temperature rise limited to 2˚C.   How do we assess  what reductions are necessary to meet this goal? 
-IPCC AR4, WGIII, Table SPM.5 (indicating a tempera ture rise of 2.0 to 2.4 for the concentration range  
of 445-490ppm CO2-eq)  
-IPCC AR4, WGI, Table TS.5 (Stabilization at 450 pp m CO2-eq would result in a temperature “likely 
in the range” of 1.4-3.1 degrees, with a “best esti mate” of 2.1 degrees rise). (see 
http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar 4-wg1-ts.pdf, page 66)  
-Elzen & Höhne, op. cit. (Annex I reductions of 30%  and non-Annex I deviation of about 17% are 
necessary for stabilization at 450ppm)  
-Parry et al. 2008: Squaring up to reality. Nature.  May 2008 (Reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 and 
stabilizing emissions between 400-485ppm Co2-eq wou ld provide an 80% chance of staying below 2 
degrees) 
-Hansen et al. Target Atmospheric CO2: Where Should  Humanity Aim? (Reducing atmospheric CO2 
to at least 350ppm Co2 (=445Co2-eq) is necessary to  avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference 
with the climate)  

 
26 - Hare, W.L., 2009.  A Safe Landing for the Climate , State of the World 2009 (Chapter 2) by The World 
Watch Institute (A 2 degrees rise is not a safe lev el and poses dangerous anthropogenic interference 
with the climate)
