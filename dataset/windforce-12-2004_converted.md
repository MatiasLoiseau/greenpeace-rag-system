GABINETE DO SECRETÀRIO

Energy is fundamental  to economic and social development, both North and

South. Yet, at the dawn of the 21st century, we are confronted with the unacceptable

fact that there are nearly 2 billion people without access to basic energy services. At

the same time, we are facing the greatest threat to our collective survival because of

our unsustainable use of energy: global climate change.

Wind Force 12 gives us a glimpse of the solution – how we can begin to meet

our  present  needs  without  compromising  the  needs  of  future  generations.  Wind

energy is the first of the ‘new renewable’ technologies to have penetrated the energy

markets in some parts of the developed world in a serious way with the right kind of

policy  support.  The  wind  industry  can  lead  the  way  for  other  renewable  energy

technologies: as it matures and penetrates markets world wide it drives costs down

which will make this technology competitive worldwide including developing countries.

The energy choices the world makes in the next few years will determine our

collective development path for many decades to come. Shall we choose to continue

to go down the ‘conventional’ energy development path, using fossil fuels, nuclear and

other  19th  and  20th  century  technologies?  Or  shall  we  choose  now  to  pursue  a  truly

sustainable development path both North and South based on efficient use of sustainable,

clean renewable energy, building new industries and creating millions of new jobs?

How  to  meet  the  challenge  of  climate  change, and  how  to  provide  clean,

affordable energy to the world’s poorest are issues which are debated in many fora,

but none this year will be more important than Renewables 2004 to be held in Bonn,

Germany from June 1-4. Seeking to galvanize the support for action to fight climate

change and poverty at the Johannesburg Earth Summit into concrete action, many

nations are expected to heed German Chancellor Schroeder’s call to bring their concrete

plans and commitments to Bonn this spring. See you there!

This latest edition of Wind Force 12 demonstrates that there are no technical,

economic or resource barriers to supplying 12% of the world's electricity needs with

wind power alone by 2020 - and this against the challenging backdrop of a projected

two thirds increase of electricity demand by that date.

The wind industry we have today is capable of becoming a dynamic, innovative

e 80 billion annual business by 2020, able to satisfy global energy demands and unlock

a  new  era  of  economic  growth, technological  progress  and  environmental  protection.

Wind energy is a significant and powerful resource. It is safe, clean, abundant and limit-

less and provides an endless, secure energy supply. The wind industry is the world's best

opportunity to begin the transition to a global economy based on sustainable energy.

Wind power has come a long way since the prototypes of just 20 years ago.

Two  decades  of  technological  progress  have  resulted  in  today's  wind  turbines  being

state-of-the-art modern technology - modular and rapid to install. A single wind turbine

is 100 times more powerful than its equivalent two decades ago.

Unlike  some  other  ‘solutions’  to  clean  energy  and  climate  protection, wind

power does not need to be invented, nor is there need to wait for any magical 'break-

through'; it is ready for global implementation now. Modern wind farms provide bulk

power equivalent to conventional power stations. In the future, this blueprint will see

the boundaries of technological progress pushed further to bring far greater benefits.

In 2003 more than 8,000 Megawatts of wind power was installed worldwide,
valued  at  e 8  billion  and  generating  enough  electricity  to  power  the  equivalent  of

19 million average European homes. But as outlined in the opening chapters of this

report, the success of the industry to date has been largely created by the efforts of

a handful of countries, led by Germany, Spain, and Denmark. It is obvious that if other

countries matched these efforts, the impact would be far greater.

The  fact  that  just  three  countries  have  created  the  bulk  of  the  progress  to

date underlines the fact that today's technology is merely the tip of the iceberg, and

a huge potential remains untapped. Wind power is capable of continuing its successful

history  over  the  next  two  decades  if  a  positive  political  and  regulatory  framework  is

implemented, one that removes the obstacles and market distortions that currently con-

strain the industry’s real potential.

This  year’s  international  conference  “Renewables  2004”  in  Bonn, Germany

charts the way towards an expansion of renewable energy worldwide, responding to the

call from the 2002 Johannesburg summit and maintaining the momentum generated

by the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition. The European Union is playing an

important role in this process, with the European regional renewables conference, held

in Berlin in January 2004, agreeing that “A target value of at least 20% of gross inland

energy consumption by 2020 for the EU is achievable.” This target could be even higher

if coupled with stronger energy efficiency policies.

Targets for renewables act as a catalyst for governments to develop the nec-

essary framework conditions for investment in renewable energy technologies. A power-

ful example is the EU Directive on the Promotion of Electricity from Renewable Energy

Sources, which sets national indicative targets for all EU Member States. These targets

have initiated action throughout the entire European Union to put in place framework con-

ditions for renewables. But although targets are an important first step in developing the

clean energy sources of tomorrow that will contribute substantially to climate protection,

they must be followed by concrete political action. Wind Force 12 is a political blueprint

for action that governments can implement, and shows what is possible with just one

renewable technology.

The message from this report is clear. Wind power is world scale; it has the

capacity to satisfy the energy and development needs of the world without destroying

it; and it will play a key role in our future sustainable energy supply.

WIND FORCE 12

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Wind  Force  12  is  a  feasibility  study  into  the  potential  for  wind  energy  to  supply  12%  of  the

world’s electricity by 2020. It concludes that there are no practical constraints to this level of

expansion, but  that  a  series  of  national  and  international  policy  shifts  are  required  for  its

achievement. In the process, a capacity level of 1,200 GW of wind power would be installed,

over 2 million jobs created and more than 10,700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide saved from

contributing to climate change.

The world’s wind resources and demand
for electricity

A number of assessments confirm that the world’s wind

resources are extremely large and well distributed

across almost all regions and countries. The total

available resource that is technically recoverable is

estimated to be 53,000 Terawatt hours (TWh)/year. This

is over twice as large as the projection for the world’s

entire electricity demand in 2020. Lack of resource is

therefore unlikely ever to be a limiting factor in the

utilisation of wind power for electricity generation.

When  more  detailed  assessments  are  carried  out  for  a

specific  country, they  also  tend  to  reveal  a  much  higher

potential for wind power than a general study suggests. In

Germany, for  example, the  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs

has shown that the potential is five times higher than indi-

cated in a 1993 study of OECD countries. Across Europe

there is ample scope to meet at least 20% of electricity

demand by 2020, especially if the new offshore market is

taken into account.

Future  electricity  demand  is  assessed  regularly  by  the

International Energy Agency. The IEA’s 2002 World Energy

Outlook  assessment  shows  that  by  2020, total  world

demand will reach 25,578 TWh. For wind power to meet

12% of global consumption it will therefore need to gen-

erate an output in the range of 3,000 TWh/year by 2020.

There  are  no  substantial  obstacles  to  the  integration  of

these increased quantities of wind power into the electricity

grid. In Denmark, peak levels often account for more than

50%  of  consumption  in  the  western  part  of  the  country

during very windy periods. The cautious assumption adopted

here is that a 20% penetration limit is easily attainable.

12% of the world’s electricity from wind
power

On the basis of recent trends, it is feasible that wind power

can be expected to grow at an average rate for new annual

installations of 25% per annum over the next seven years.

This is the highest growth rate during the timescale of the

study, ending up with a total of 197,500 MW of capacity

on line by the end of 2010.

investment, costs and employment

The annual investment required to achieve the

deployment of wind energy outlined above starts
at e 8.2 billion in 2004 and increases to a peak
of e 82.7 billion by 2019.

The  total  investment  needed  to  reach  a  level  of  almost
1,200 GW of capacity by 2020 is estimated at e 692 billion

over the whole period. This is a very large figure, but it can

be compared with the annual investment in the power sec-
tor  during  the  1990s  of  some  e 158-186  billion.  The

future investment required globally has also been broken

down on a regional basis.

The cost per unit of wind-powered electricity has already

reduced  dramatically  as  manufacturing  and  other  costs

have fallen. This study starts from the basis that a “state

of the art” wind turbine in 2003 in the most optimal con-
ditions had an investment cost of e 804 per installed kW
and a unit cost for its output of 3.79 e cents/kWh.

12% wind power by 2020
the environmental benefits

A reduction in the levels of carbon dioxide being emitted

into  the  world’s  atmosphere  is  the  most  important  envi-

ronmental  benefit  from  wind  power  generation.  Carbon

dioxide is the gas largely responsible for exacerbating the

greenhouse  effect,

leading  to  the  disastrous  conse-

quences of global climate change.

On the assumption that the average value for carbon dioxide

saved by switching to wind power is 600 tonnes per GWh,

the annual saving under this scenario will be 1,832 million
tonnes of CO2 by 2020 and 5,106 million tonnes by 2040.

The cumulative savings would be 10,771 million tonnes
of CO2 by 2020 and 88,857 million tonnes by 2040.

If  the  external  costs, including  environmental  damage,

caused  by  different  fuels  used  for  electricity  generation

were  given  a  monetary  value, then  wind  power  would

either benefit from a reduction in price or the cost of other

fuels would increase substantially.

Policy recommendations

This study clearly demonstrates that there are no techno-

logical, commercial  or  resource  limits  constraining  the

world  from  meeting  12%  of  future  global  electricity

demand  from  wind  power  in  less  than  two  decades.

Without political support, however, wind power remains at

a  competitive  disadvantage.  Distortions  in  the  world’s

electricity markets - created by decades of massive finan-

cial, political and structural support to conventional tech-

nologies - are coupled with the fact that new wind power

Market results and scenario predictions

As this is the fifth version of the scenario, it is useful to

make a comparison between their predictions and actual

market results over the period 1999-2003, as well as see-

ing how the scenarios have varied in their expectation for

the coming decade.

The  two  figures  illustrate  the  changing  scenario  results

over  time  compared  to  market  reality.  In  the  first  four

years, the  market  results  outstripped  the  scenario  fore-

casts.  In  2003, for  the  first  time, market  results  were

lower than the scenario figures, a trend that is set to con-

tinue in the absence of stronger policy intervention. The

comparison  of  the  EWEA  conventional  scenario  versus

Wind Force 12 for the years 2004-2010 indicates the size

of that gap.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND ISSUES

Reliability

In larger projects using proven medium sized turbines an availability of 98% is consistently achieved.

Noise

Some early turbine designs were noisy, but improved engineering has resulted in mechanical noise being virtually

eliminated and aerodynamic noise levels vastly improved.

Efficiency

Wind turbines are now highly efficient, with less than 10% thermal losses in system transmission.

Visual impact

How and where to position wind farms requires sensitive treatment, but surveys of European public reaction to

operational wind farms have shown a largely positive response.

Contribution to power supply

With penetration levels of up to 20% in Denmark and around 5% in both Germany and Spain, wind power is

already making a significant contribution. Growth of the offshore market, a resource large enough to supply all

of Europe’s electricity, will further reinforce this significance.

The variability of the wind has produced far fewer problems

for electricity grid management than sceptics had anticipat-

ed. On windy winter nights, wind turbines account for up to

50% of power generation in the western part of Denmark,

for  example, but  the  grid  operators  have  managed  it  suc-

cessfully. It would improve the effectiveness and reliability

of the European wind input, however, if a new super-grid was

installed to link up the many large offshore plants expected

to start generating power over the next decade.

More recently, Denmark has led the world in the develop-

ment of proposals to build large wind farms of turbines in

its coastal waters. The first of these, at Horns Rev in the

North Sea (160 MW) was built during 2002; the second,

off the coast from Nysted at Roedsand Banke (158 MW),

was completed in 2003. In 2007 and 2008 two new off-

shore wind farms of at least 200 MW will be completed.

A  succession  of  further  large  offshore  wind  farms  is

expected to be announced in the coming years.

Another feature of Danish development is that historical-

ly most of the turbines erected have been owned by indi-

viduals or specially established wind co-operatives. Over

150,000 Danish families now either own themselves, or

have  shares  in, wind  energy  schemes.  Even  the  large

40 MW Middelgrunden wind farm in the sea just outside

Copenhagen  is  partly  owned  by  a  co-operative  with

8,500 members.

One reason for the Danish wind industry’s

success is the commitment from successive

governments to a series of national energy

plans.

Overall, the figures in Table 3.1 indicate that there is an

exploitable potential for on land wind power in Europe of

more  than  600  TWh/year.  Some  countries  can  also  pro-

duce much more electricity from the wind than they could

use internally. This presents a challenge to the developing

cross-border European power market.

Offshore wind resources in Europe

There  is  an  enormous  additional  wind  resource  to  be

found in the seas around the coastline of Europe. Several

European  countries, led  by  Denmark, are  already  seeing

the first large scale offshore wind farms built in their ter-

ritorial waters. A study led by consultants Garrad Hassan

and Germanischer Lloyd, carried out under the European

Union’s Joule research programme in 1993-5, estimated

an offshore wind potential in the EU of 3,028 TWh. Even

though Norway and Sweden were not included, this figure

far  exceeded  the  total  electricity  consumption  within  the

Union’s 15 members in 1997.

Taking off from the figure for installed wind power capacity at the end of 2003, this scenario

projects a growth rate of 25% up to 2010, followed  by lower rates as the world total expands.

Individual turbine size and capacity factors will both steadily increase. By the year 2020, an

installed capacity of 1,245 GW will have been achieved, with an annual production capable of

matching 12% of the world’s demand. This projected growth is comparable with the level of

market penetration achieved by other power generation technologies.

Assumptions and parameters

The  choice  of  parameters  used  in  this  study  has  been

based on historical experience both from the wind power

industry  and  from  other  technological  developments  in

the energy field.

The main assumptions were:

Annual growth rates

Growth  rates  of  20-25%  per  annum  are  high  for  an

industry manufacturing heavy equipment. However, the

wind industry has experienced far higher growth rates

in  the  initial  phase  of  its  industrialisation.  Between

1993 and 1998, when the first Wind Force 10 assess-

ment  was  made, the  average  annual  growth  in  new

capacity  was  40%, whilst  from  1998  to  2003  it  has

continued at an impressive average of 26%.

Based  on  the  current  rate  of  expansion  in  the  wind

energy  industry, it  is  quite  capable  of  meeting  a

growth  in  demand  of  25%  a  year  for  at  least  seven

years ahead. By the end of 2010 manufacturing out-

put is expected to reach a level of 39,787 MW/year.

From  2011  onwards  the  annual  growth  rate  of  new

capacity slows down in the scenario to 20%, then to

15% in 2015 and finally to 10% in 2019. The growth

in manufacturing capacity levels out in 2019 at a fig-

ure of 158,728 MW annually.

An important factor in Europe is the likely opening up

of offshore development from 2005 onwards, a mar-

ket  segment  which  will  add  further  volume  to  the

generally  high

level  of  expansion  on

land.

Nonetheless, a  clear  message  from  the  industry  is

that it would like to see a stable political framework

established for wind power development in emerging

markets around the world before it enters local man-

ufacturing through joint ventures.

Progress ratios

The general conclusion from industrial learning curve

theory is that costs decrease by some 20% each time

the number of units produced doubles. A 20% decline

is equivalent to a progress ratio of 0.80. Studies of

show that progress through R&D efforts and by learn-

ing resulted in a 15-20% price reduction – equivalent

to a progress ratio of 0.85 to 0.80. In the calculation

of cost reductions in this report, experience has been

related  to  numbers  of  units, i.e.  turbines  and  not

megawatt capacity. The increase in average unit size

is therefore also taken into account.

Experience  from  the  leading  wind  power  nations  has

shown that even with commercial technology available, it

still takes some time for large scale development to take

off.  The  institutional  framework  facilitating  the  develop-

ment must be in place, and it is desirable to get at least

some local manufacturing in progress before major invest-

ments are made.

Table 5.1 shows the average investment cost over different

periods of time in the first two decades of the 21st century.

This in turn allows us to allocate the regional investment,

taking  into  account  when  development  in  individual

regions is likely to take off.

Cost reductions

The  cost  per  unit  (kWh)  of  wind  electricity  has  already

reduced  dramatically  as  manufacturing  and  other  costs

have  fallen.  Between  1981  and  1995, according  to  an

evaluation  of  wind  turbines  installed  in  Denmark  by  the

RISØ National Research Laboratory, the cost per unit fell
from 15.8 e cents/kWh to 5.7 e cents/kWh, a decrease

of two thirds.

The  reasons  included  improved  design  of  turbines  and

better siting.

Since that time, the 500 kW size turbines then just being

introduced into the commercial market have been overtak-

derived  employment  to  be  obtained  from  the  12%  sce-

nario is assessed separately in the tables listing the key

figures by region.

In Figure 5.4a, the total installation quota of wind energy

is divided by regions into periods up to 2020. For individ-

ual  regions,

the  figures  can  only  represent  a  rough

estimate, however, since  a  detailed  assessment  of  the

penetration pattern has not been possible within the lim-

its  of  this  study.  Nonetheless, the  sum  of  each  period

makes up the total annual figure in accordance with the

12% scenario (see Table 4-1).

The  annual  installation  figures  in  MW  are  turned  into

employment figures in Figure 5.4b. These “core figures”

will in due course have to be corrected region by region,

taking  into  account  such  issues  as  the  actual  price  of

labour, manufacturing  efficiency  (related  to  the  above),

and  the  rate  of  import  of  materials  or  components  for

manufacturing the regional share of global installation.

It is also necessary to explain the difference between the

194,000  job  years  in  Figure  5.1  and  the  estimated

90-100,000  jobs  in  the  global  industry  today.  The

90-100,000 figure is an estimate based on specific indi-

vidual  national  data  of  direct  and  indirect  employment  –

i.e. for primary industry and major sub-suppliers. However

this estimate cannot capture every single job or part-job

created by wind power. The 194,000 job years is based on

a  statistical  model  comparing  jobs, investment  and  MW

which covers all wind-related employment.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS

The  most  important  environmental  benefit  from  this  scenario  is  a  reduction  in  the  global

output of carbon dioxide – the major gas responsible for climate change. The annual level of

reductions will rise from 50.8 million tonnes of of CO2 in 2003 to 1,832 million tonnes in 2020.
By then the cumulative saving will have reached a total of 10,771 million tonnes.

7 - POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

Governments face many challenges in formulating future energy policy over the coming years.

They  have  to  respond  to  the  need  to  address  security  of  energy  supply, economic  growth,

sustainable  development, climate  change, employment  and  technological  development.

Renewable energy technologies have a positive effect on all these issues. This study clearly

The development of other renewable energy technologies

such as biomass, geothermal and solar have also had sig-

nificant  leadership  from  countries  in  Latin  America  and

Asia.  Because  the  Johannesburg  World  Summit  on

Sustainable  Development  in  2002  was  unable  to  agree

concrete programmes for the development of renewables,

the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition (JREC - now

85 countries) was formed, and agreed to work together to

pursue the massive take up of renewable energy globally

that  will  be  required  to  meet  the  challenge  of  climate

change  as  well  as  to  help  ensure  access  to  clean  and

affordable  energy  to  the  world’s  poorest.  Renewables

2004, a  conference  to  be  convened  by  the  German  gov-

ernment in Bonn from June 1-4 this year, is the first major

milestone for the JREC, and there is an expectation of new

announcements of new targets, policies and measures for

the global dissemination of renewable energy.

Renewable  energy  targets  are  most  effective  if  they  are

based on a percentage of a nation’s total electricity con-

sumption. One advantage is that this creates an incentive

to  optimise  turbines.  If  these  targets  are  set  as  short

term  targets  and  long  term  mile-stones  this  acts  as  a

guide  to  identify  where  immediate  policy  changes  are

required to achieve 5 and 10 year targets.

However, targets have little value if they are not accom-

panied by policies which achieve a level playing field in

electricity markets, eliminate market barriers and create

an environment which attracts investment capital.

In  order  to  attract  wind  power  companies  to  establish

manufacturing facilities, markets need to be strong, sta-

duced in different countries to further these aims.

Overall, there are two types of incentives to promote

deployment of renewable energy:

1. Fixed Price Systems where the government (or the

EU) sets the electricity prices (or premiums) paid to

the producer and lets the market determine the

quantity.

2. Renewable Quota Systems (in the USA referred to as

Renewable Portfolio Standards) where the govern-

ment sets the quantity of renewable electricity and

leaves it to the market to determine the price.

Subsidies  artificially  reduce  the  price  of  power, keep

renewables out of the market place, and prop up increas-

ingly uncompetitive technologies and fuels.

Eliminating  direct  and  indirect  subsidies  to  fossil  fuels

and nuclear power would help move us toward a level play-

ing  field  across  the  energy  sector.  As  the  1998  OECD

study  “Improving  the  Environment  through  Reducing

Subsidies” noted: “Support is seldom justified and gener-

ally deters international trade, and is often given to ailing

industries. …support may be justified if it lowers the long-

term marginal costs to society as a whole. This may be the

case with support to ‘infant industries’, such as producers

of renewable energy.”

The 2001 report of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force

goes  further, stating  that  “re-addressing  them  [subsidies]

and making even a minor re-direction of these considerable

financial flows toward renewables, provides an opportunity

to  bring  consistency  to  new  public  goals  and  to  include

social and environmental costs in prices.” The Task Force

recommends  that  “G8  countries  should  take  steps  to

remove incentives and other supports for environmentally

harmful  energy  technologies, and  develop  and  implement

market-based  mechanisms  that  address  externalities,

enabling renewable energy technologies to compete in the

market on a more equal and fairer basis.”

Wind power would not need special provisions if markets

were not distorted by the fact that it is still virtually

free for electricity producers to pollute.

Subsidies  to  fully  competitive  and  polluting  technologies

are  highly  unproductive, seriously  distort  markets  and

increase the need to support renewables. Removing sub-

sidies to conventional electricity would not only save tax-

payers’  money  and  reduce  current  market  distortions  in

the  electricity  market.  It  would  also  dramatically  reduce

the need for renewables support.
