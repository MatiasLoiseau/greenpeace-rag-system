The Amazon Basin covers an area 
of approximately 6.5 million square 
kilometers in nine South American 
countries, comprising five percent of the Earth’s surface. It harbours the 
largest river system on the planet, 
about one-fifth of the total volume of fresh water of the world. Some 60% 
of the Amazon basin (4.1 million km²) 
are inside Brazil’s borders.Brazil’s Legal Amazon is an administrative designation and 
includes the whole Amazon forest 
in Brazil, plus some areas of savanna in the states of Mato Grosso and 
Tocantins. So far, 700 thousand km
2 
of the original Amazon forest cover of Brazil have been deforested, an 
area that is equivalent to more than twice that of Poland.The state of Mato Grosso extends 
over 903,358 km² and comprises the 
Amazon forest, plus some areas of savanna and the Pantanal. In absolute 
terms, the state has the highest 
cumulative deforestation rates, so far, totaling 185,587 km², i.e. two 
times the area of Hungary. 

3 AtlAs do desm AtAmento no Br Asilintroduction
Between 2000 and 2007, the Brazilian Amazon was deforested 
at a rate of 19,368 km² every year. In this time, 154,312 km² of 
forest have been destroyed, an area larger than Greece.
Deforestation and land-use change makes up 75% of Brazilian 
greenhouse gases emissions (GHG). From this total, 59% come 
from the loss of forest cover and burning in the Amazon region, 
making Brazil the fourth biggest climate polluter worldwide.
Brazil has a very important role in saving the planet from the 
effects of climate change. It must bring deforestation to zero by 2015, with progressive deforestation reduction goals that combine 
development, sensible use of natural resources and biodiversity 
conservation.
Cattle ranching is responsible for the majority of deforestation in the 
Amazon, which has been expanding continuously since the early 
1970s. A survey conducted by Greenpeace, based on data from the 
2006 Agriculture Survey of the Brazilian Statistics Institute (IBGE) 
indicates that 79.5% of the land used in the Brazilian Legal Amazon 
(excluding the state of Maranhão) is destined for cattle ranching.
This study was done by Greenpeace to chart the location of pasture 
areas in the Amazon region. This is a new method, which analyses images released from the Modis (Moderate-resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer) satellite can identify which deforested areas 
are currently used for cattle ranching compared to those used as cropland. Initially, we studied the Amazon area in the state of Mato 
Grosso, which harbours the largest bovine herd in the country and 
has the largest average deforestation rates since 1988. 
This report releases a series of maps that show the land use along 
with data on infrastructure, recent deforestation and regional dynamics. 
This information is critical for decision making that will ultimately 
reduce and eliminate deforestation in the Amazon region. To get 
to that end goal requires thorough understanding of land use so 
that the Brazilian government can fund alternative practices, and introduce effective governance and control. More important, it is 
essential that the Brazilian government follows up its environmental 
rhetoric, which talks about reducing deforestation in the Amazon region, with practical measures to discourage activities like destructive cattle ranching in the area.According to the data from IBGE, in 2006 there were three head of cattle per inhabitant in the region. This massive presence of 
cattle in the Amazon Region is the result of more than 30 years of government policies that encouraged investments in infrastructure 
(roads, dams), occupation of the territory (induced migration) and public funding of such activities. 
In 2003, a study funded by the World Bank showed that there is 
a direct relationship between deforestation and cattle ranching, 
and the economic reasoning behind it. Cattle ranching is profitable 
and expanding because forest land is currently very cheap. The world bank study shows that cattle ranching is a strong driver for 
occupation, conversion and trade of illegally-used land. Some areas, 
where there is less intensive logging become targets for deforestation and pasture conversion, once the tree and plant species with higher commercial value have been already been removed. 
Over the past few years, the expansion of cattle ranching in 
the Amazon Region has intensified in line with the increasing 
international exports of Brazilian cattle and beef. From 2002 to 
2006, the growth of the entire Brazilian bovine herd was practically concentrated in the Amazon (14.5 million of the total 20.5 million 
head of cattle in Brazil). Brazil has the largest commercial cattle herd 
in the world and, since 2003, is the world’s largest beef exporter.
Cattle ranching in the Amazon also uses most of Brazil’s slave 
labour. In 2008, 3005 rural workers were freed from cattle ranches, where they had been kept in slavery. The Legal Amazon accounted 
for 99% of these cases.

4deforest Ation from Prodes
how is the Am Azon deforest Ation Assessed?
Since 1988, the INPE (National Institute for Space Research) has 
released annual estimates of the Legal Amazon deforestation rates. 
Since 2002, these estimates have been prepared through digital 
tracking of images, following the PRODES (Amazon Deforestation Estimate Program) methodology, and using the images generated by 
the Landsat satellite. After reaching the second highest level ever in 
2004, the annual deforestation rate dropped drastically until 2007, the latest date that data was available. 
However, preliminary data from another system, the Deter (Real-
time Detection of Deforestation) indicate that, since August 2007, 
the rates have again been growing.  However, the Deter system 
only gives an indication of a trend, it ANALYSES low resolution image TO ALERT ENVIRONMENTAL AGENTS TO ACT, and was 
not originally designed to measure the deforested area.Annu Al deforest Ation vs. me At And soy Prices
Deforestation rates in the Amazon tend to increase or decrease in 
response to the international prices of the main farm commodities 
produced in the area, especially meat and soy. When the prices 
of both products drop, the reduction in deforestation observed in the following year is even more prominent, as we can see for the 
period from 2004 to 2007.

The number of cattle in the Brazilian Legal Amazon is growing 
extremely quickly: from 1990 to 2003, the bovine herd more than 
doubled, going from 26.6 million to 64 million head of cattle. The 
states of Mato Grosso and Pará, together, account for 60% of the 
bovine herd in the Amazon. Such growth intensifies destruction 
of the Amazon forest, which is then gradually replaced by new pasture areas. According to the data from IBGE, between 1996 and 
2006, the area dedicated to pastures grew by approximately 10 
million hectares in the Amazon region only, which corresponds to 100 times the area of Paris. ArEA occuPIEd By c ATTLE rAncHInG In THE LEGAL

New roads allow human occupation and destruction of the 
Amazon rain forest. A survey conducted by INPE shows that up 
to 87% of the deforestation in the region was less than 25 km from the first settled areas, where the occupation started around 1978.  There are two types of roads in the region: official and unofficial 
roads. The first ones link the Northern region to the rest of Brazil 
and were mainly funded by the federal government in the 1970s. Unofficial roads connect local sites and are not depicted on the 
official charts prepared by the DNIT (National Infrastructure and 
Transportation Agency) and by the IBGE. The large number of roads allows meat production to occur even in remote areas, hundreds of 
kilometres from the cattle farms.

The map of SIF-registered slaughterhouse and land use shows 
how cattle slaughter facilities and the distribution of pastures 
are related. We can see a marked concentration of deforested areas and pastures in the neighbourhood of cold storage facilities. Supported by the roads, the areas of influence of the plants extend 
for hundreds of kilometres. Even those cold storage units located 
on the Cerrado biome (savannas) have an influence on large areas of the Amazon forest. whA t does sif meAn?
Slaughterhouses registered at the SIF (Federal Inspection System) are granted permission to sell their products to other states or to 
export. They represent just a fraction of the existing facilities, but 
they usually belong to the group of companies with the biggest production capacity. Of the 71 cold storage facilities registered at 
the SIF and located in the Amazon region, 45 are in the state of 
Mato Grosso. In addition, there are local and state facilities, plus an unmeasured number of clandestine cattle slaughter that supplies 
the local markets.

This analysis of land use identifies the main areas of expansion and consolidation of cattle production in the Amazon forest of the state 
of Mato Grosso. Four major sites were identified, both in areas where the occupation has already occurred and also at the frontiers of 
the destruction process. 
the fAr north ( nortão)
The area encircled by the municipalities of Juína, Juara, 
Apiacás and Colniza, in the northwest of Mato Grosso, is one of the most recent sites of deforestation for cattle ranching in the Brazilian Amazon, in the state of Mato Grosso. The lines on the map show destructive logging 
activities followed by burning and deforestation. This area 
is linked, by road, to regions where deforestation is already established, such as the state of Rondônia to the West, the BR 163 highway, to the East, and the productive savannah to the South. Over the past three years the occupation of the far North has accelerated, mainly in the area around Colniza, a town that is already linked to another frontier of cattle ranching expansion, the South region of the Amazonas state. In these border regions, the growth of 
cattle ranching is strongly linked to destructive logging 
activities.
“tongue”  of the Biome (lAnd striP)
This is a significant area of the Amazon forest, extending towards the savannah, and forming a kind of “peninsula” in the southernmost part of the biome. These are old deforestation areas (before 2000), with massive infrastructure including roads and large cattle slaughter  
and cold storage facilities. Due to the extensive destruction, the area has no remaining dense rainforest, and is characterized by extensive and continuous pastures, with low density of cattle per hectare. It is hard to believe that this area was a rainforest not too long ago.

4The area along the BR-163 road is one of the best 
known soy farming expansion pathways in the state of Mato Grosso. The areas lying close to the road, opened in 1970, are already completely occupied, having been deforested before the year 2000. However, we can see 
that cattle ranching is still dominant in the area to the 
North of Sorriso, and particularly on the axis that crosses the BR road, from Sinop to Alta Floresta, although there are also several sites of commercial farming. This map also shows the recently expanding deforestation for cattle ranching to the North, up to the Pará state border, and to the West, reaching the neighbouring areas. Reasons for the continuing presence of cattle ranching in the region include the distance from the exporting 
ports, (Paranaguá and Porto Velho) the fact that the road 
in the state of Pará is not paved, which might drive the exports through the port of Santarém in Pará, and the mobility of the cattle. 
the sPrings of the xingu river
The majority of the course of the xingu River in the state of Mato 
Grosso is protected by the xingu Indigenous National Park, which 
covers 2,642,003 hectares. 
However, the sources of the river’s tributaries are mostly located 
outside the park. In this region, on the northeastern border of the 
state of Mato Grosso, there is another area of recent deforestation for cattle ranching. These areas are commercially linked to regions outside the Amazon forest, to the southern Mato Grosso and to the traditional cattle ranching regions of the neighbour state of Goiás, in the savannah region. The destruction of the forest around the river sources threatens the watercourses that lead to the xingu River, disrupting the ecological balance. The river’s ecological health is needed to maintain the huge biodiversity in the region and ensure a sustainable environment for the local population. 

10lAnd use And deforest Ation Between 1997 And 2006
This map shows the areas deforested before and after 1997, to 
see if they are now occupied by soya or cattle. It is possible to 
see the recent deforestation for soya in the BR 163 region, as well as the recent expansion of cattle pastures around Colniza. Finally, it shows that springs of the xingu River are occupied by both soya 
and cattle.

The land use distribution in Mato Grosso, which includes 
some areas of savannah, shows the impact of mechanized 
monocultures, especially soy crops, in four prominent areas:
The Lucas do Rio Verde region is the largest producing area in Mato 
Grosso and it extends beyond the savannah, occupying large areas 
of the Amazon forest. 
The northbound expansion is just beginning, due to the high costs 
of transport to the ports in the South.The Chapada dos Parecis region, between the “tongue” (land strip) and the remaining Amazon biome, has expanded along the Porto 
Velho – Santarém export axis, which follows the Amazon River. 
Soy crops (which require intensive use of agrochemicals), as well 
as cattle, also threaten the xingu River sources, and occupy mainly 
the neighbouring area on the southeast of the park.

methodology
This study used images from the sensor 
Modis (Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer) covering a whole 
year period, selected every 16 days (a 
total of 23 images of each area, for the 
whole year comprised). With this, it 
was possible to create an overview of 
vegetation in the whole state of Mato 
Grosso, during a whole year.
The identification of the land activity 
in each image was done through two 
methods. First, images were separated 
according to their EVI (Enhanced 
Vegetation Index), which compares 
different levels of photosynthetic activity 
and concentration of vegetation. This 
method identifies  agricultural activity as well as regenerated forest in areas 
where deforestation has been previously 
detected (by PRODES).
To identify pastures, altered forest 
landscapes (victim of predatory logging) 
and secondary forests (capoeira) it was 
necessary to analyse visually each of the 
series of images. In the end, for a pre-
validation of the method, flights were 
carried out at the eastern side of the 
xingu Indigenous Park, in Sinop Region 
around the BR-163, and north of Alta 
Floresta.
The Modis images are generated every 
day, so it is possible to follow changes to the vegetation throughout the year. 
However, the resolution of the images 
is very low - only accurate to 250m, or 
approximately an area of 6,25 ha. The 
constant presence of clouds in certain 
areas can make monitoring impossible 
in some regions.ten reAsons to Avoid the

Deforestation of tropical forests is responsible for up to 20% of the global emissions of • 
greenhouse gas, more than the world’s entire transport sector.
From another point of view, around 18% of global emissions of greenhouse gas are • 
related to meat consumption worldwide.Together, belched methane from livestock, plus methane from manure make up 37 % of • 
global methane emissions. Methane is 20 times as damaging to the climate as CO
2.
A beef calf produces five tones of CO• 2 – equivalent throughout its life cycle.
The Amazon Forest is a victim of climate change, as much as its destruction is also • 
creating CO2 emissions. Scientific models predict that the weather in large areas of the 
region could become drier and the tropical forest will become savannah under climate 
change forecasts.
Forests are a crucial carbon stock: forest ecosystems globally store about one-and-• 
a-half times as much carbon as is present in the atmosphere. They act as a brake on 
further acceleration of climate change.
The Amazon stores roughly 120 billions of tons of carbon.• 
The region is also home to more than 20 million people – including over 200,000 • 
indigenous people, belonging to 180 different groups. The rainforest provides them 
with everything – from food and shelter to tools and medicines – and is central to the spiritual life of the indigenous peoples.
Recent studies indicate that the Amazon supports 40,000 plant species; 427 mammals; • 
1,294 birds; 378 reptiles; 426 amphibians and 3,000 species of fish.The Amazon controls the populations of organisms that transmit tropical diseases such • 
as malaria. In the Brazilian Amazon there are 400 to 600 thousand malaria cases every 
year, but in degraded landscapes the number of infections is 300 times higher.
