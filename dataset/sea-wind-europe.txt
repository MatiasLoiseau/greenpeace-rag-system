Sea Wind  
Europe



Sea Wind Europe iii
Europe faces an uncertain future. We live 
in a time of environmental and political 
instability. Climate change, the greatest 
environmental threat to humanity, is 
already manifesting devastating impacts 
across the European Union; meanwhile 
global tensions over natural resources 
and inequality are fuelling conflicts 
around the world.
As the expanding EU faces the twin 
threats of climate change and the need 
to guarantee energy security, it becomes 
increasingly clear that far-reaching 
changes in the energy system are going 
to be necessary. Oil dependency and 
the tension that it has caused are well 
documented. Coal, a major part of the 
old European energy mix and the most 
polluting fuel of all, is unusable in a low 
carbon economy. 
Advocates of nuclear power, aware of 
its unpopularity and unsolved problems, 
nevertheless hold it up as a low-carbon 
option. But nuclear power has proved 
unreliable and expensive as well as 
dangerous; it is still unable to compete 
without huge subsidies. The threat of 
terrorism only compounds the risks. 
Nuclear power advocates say that 
we must expand its use despite the 
problems because renewable energy is 
unable to deliver on a large scale – that 
it cannot develop fast enough or be 
big enough to play a significant role in 
meeting Europe’s energy demands. 
Sea Wind Europe  shows this to be false. 
This report by international energy 
consultants Garrad Hassan shows 
how by 2020 one single source of 
renewable energy, offshore wind 
power, could provide 30% of the 
EU’s electricity – just a fraction less 
than is currently supplied by nuclear 
power.  Success on this scale would not only deliver enormous environmental 
benefits from this clean, safe energy 
source, but would also generate an 
economic boom in Europe worth 
hundreds of billions of euros and creating 
up to 3 million jobs.
Renewable energy is already delivering 
electricity to millions of people 
worldwide, providing and sustaining 
hundreds of thousands of jobs, 
and offering the opportunities of a 
growing multi-billion euro market. 
The resources for wind, wave, tidal, 
biomass and solar generation are vast 
– easily enough to provide for the 
world’s energy needs many times over. 
Europe is blessed with some of the 
richest renewable energy resources in 
the world and is already a world leader 
in harnessing them. Offshore wind is 
particularly suited to delivering very 
large-scale power to Europe.
The range of renewable energy 
technologies, combined with better 
energy efficiency, offer an immediate, 
clean, safe and effective answer 
to both climate change and energy 
security. By their nature, renewable 
energy sources are both indigenous and 
limitless. They are not dependent on 
uncertain fuel supplies or fluctuating 
prices. They are completely safe 
and are by far the most resilient 
technologies in the face of the impacts 
of climate change.
At this crucial and threatening time, it is 
Europe that must lead the way. Within 
the EU are the states and companies 
which lead the world in renewable energy 
development and in the fight to tackle 
climate change. Europe has the skills, the 
vision and more than enough renewable 
resources to prove these solutions for 
the rest of the world.Other world leaders have faltered and 
failed to take the initiative. Their inaction 
in the face of the dangers places us 
all at risk. It is up to Europe to act. If 
the nations most enthusiastic for clean 
energy, if those most ‘willing’ in the world, 
with the best know-how and the most 
developed, vibrant renewable energy 
industry anywhere cannot make this clean 
energy vision a reality, then there is very 
real doubt as to whether anyone can. In 
that case climate change and conflict born 
from the desire for ‘security’ will hit hard 
and mercilessly.
Europe must rise to this challenge and 
lead the world.
The first and defining step towards 
European leadership in renewable 
energy must be the successful setting 
of an ambitious EU renewable energy 
target for 2020.  This will set out the 
vision and create the framework within 
which our clean energy future can be 
delivered. Sea Wind Europe  offers a clear 
blueprint of how to achieve its vision and 
outlines concrete policy measures that will 
give European renewables the foundation 
they need for success on a giant scale.
Energy is at the heart of today’s most 
pressing global issues. The choices 
we make in the EU now, about where 
our energy will come from in future 
and how we will use it, have profound 
consequences for the lives, not just of 
every European, but of every person and 
species on the planet.

1. Background
Sea Wind Europe  is a vision for offshore wind 
energy. It demonstrates what could be possible 
for just one renewable energy technology 
– namely, to become a mainstay of Europe’s 
electricity supply system.  
Commissioned by Greenpeace, and written by 
wind energy consultants Garrad Hassan, Sea 
Wind Europe  considers Greenpeace’s question 
as to whether the supply of thirty per cent of 
current EU electricity demand – 720TWh/year 
– by 2020 is a viable aspiration for offshore 
wind. This implies the installation of 240GW 
of generating capacity by 2020, which is 
approximately ten times more than the present 
combined amount of installed on- and offshore 
wind power.
The report is deliberately bold, identifying at an 
early stage the necessary steps that need to be 
taken to remove any anticipated obstacles. In 
taking this approach, it tackles the belief held 
by some that renewables are a fine idea but 
cannot deliver practically at such a large scale, 
and that instead we must suffer environmental 
degradation as a consequence of our desire for 
electricity. This report shows that we should not 
have to compromise either the environment, or 
our social and economic well-being.  
There are challenges, but with early action they 
should be surmountable. They are also almost 
certainly no greater than the challenges that 
would be presented by the ‘business as usual’ 
alternative.  
Offshore wind energy is just one example of 
a renewable energy technology capable of 
making a significant contribution to Europe’s 
electricity requirements. Energy efficiency also has an enormous role to play. Other renewables 
technologies, albeit at an earlier stage of 
development, offer similar prospects for large-
scale deployment. Many of the conclusions 
drawn in Sea Wind Europe  are equally applicable 
to these other technologies.
2 Analysis  
What are the benefits?
It is well known that wind energy generates 
electricity  while avoiding adverse impacts 
on the environment.
It also generates jobs.  Studies have shown that 
offshore wind energy is likely to create jobs 
comparable in numbers to the conventional 
power sector. Also, because the manufacture 
of wind turbines, offshore support structures 
and other products utilises established skills 
and facilities from the heavy engineering sector, 
offshore wind energy can offer revitalisation 
for communities suffering from a decline in 
traditional manufacturing.  
There is also demonstrable public support  for 
wind energy. Surveys have shown approval 
ratings of over 70% to be nearly universal, 
with an average of 77%. Wind power is also a 
technology in which individuals have shown a 
willingness to invest through co-operatives and 
other investment vehicles. Middelgrunden, just 
off Copenhagen harbour, is the largest ever co-
operatively owned wind farm.  
What are the costs?
Onshore wind has shown dramatic cost 
reductions over the last decade, such that today 
facilities can be built at a lower per MW capital 
cost than all but gas-fired plant. In its operation, 
wind power is free from fuel price fluctuations 
and security of supply concerns. Offshore wind 
energy is at an earlier stage of development 
than onshore, but is still considered by bodies 
such as the International Energy Agency to be 
cheaper (even without consideration of external 
costs) than nuclear power. Furthermore, it is 
expected to achieve cost reductions with scale 
and with ‘learning by doing’.

vi
But this is not the full story. Environmental 
degradation entails costs which are either 
not attributed directly to those who cause 
them, or are not currently captured as 
economic costs at all. Termed ‘externalities’, 
these are costs to society as a whole, and 
include for instance pollution-related damage 
to ecosystems, with knock-on effects on 
human health and well-being. In comparison 
to conventional power plant, wind energy 
has negligible externalities. Governments are 
increasingly promoting wind energy and other 
renewables as cost-effective means to limit 
carbon emissions.
What are the key challenges?
The technological  know-how for large-scale 
deployment of offshore wind is largely in 
place. The materials, facilities and skills required 
are also, for the most part, available for 
exploitation. Transfer of all of these elements 
from the offshore oil and gas and other sectors 
is required, and is beginning to happen.  
Specific technological challenges such as the 
development of support structures for deeper 
waters will need to be overcome. Furthermore, 
existing companies exploiting what is at present 
a niche market will need to be ready to expand.  
Sea Wind Europe -scale expansion of offshore 
wind energy will require changes in the 
physical grid network. If offshore wind is to 
grow significantly, it makes sense to consider 
the general expansion of the grid to meet 
demand in the context of plans for offshore 
wind energy. Adoption of new practices for 
operating the grid, as well as alterations to 
wind turbines such that they can integrate 
better into the grid, will also be required. 
These changes are necessary because wind 
energy is a new technology, and also because 
its output is intermittent.For the most part, these changes employ 
existing solutions which have not been 
adopted simply because at low penetrations 
a sophisticated approach was not merited. 
However, evidence from Denmark suggests 
that high penetrations are achievable; moreover 
cost estimates of required grid reinforcement 
and system issues are often within the range of 
other project cost variances.
It is considered vital that commercial finance  
be made available to build offshore wind farms. 
For this to happen on a scale sufficient to 
achieve the Sea Wind Europe  target, banks will 
need to come to regard offshore wind as a core 
part of their business. Many banks are active 
in lending to onshore wind, but lending to the 
offshore sector at the levels implied by Sea 
Wind Europe  will require a step change in the 
activities of the investment community.  
The desire to minimise risk means that the 
requirements of the finance community 
are relatively straightforward. Successful 
demonstration of offshore wind, in a range 
of environments, will provide assurance on 
technology risk. A long-term, stable market will 
provide comfort on the expected project returns.  
What does Sea  
Wind Europe mean?
It is impossible to predict to 2020 where the 
offshore wind farms will be located, or the 
rate at which they will grow year on year. 
Nonetheless, it was considered very important, 
at least by way of example, to conceptualise 
the numbers in the report. This is achieved in 
two ways: by providing an illustrative growth 
curve for the Sea Wind Europe  aspiration and 
putting this in the context of existing and 
established projections for growth of wind 
energy; and by using maps to illustrate the area 
of sea required to accommodate this growth.

Sea Wind Europe vii
3. Actions required
The culmination of analysis for Sea Wind Europe  
is the derivation of key actions for policy-
makers, industry and other stakeholders. A key 
theme running all the way through is the need 
for a stable market, which gives financiers 
the confidence to lend and companies the 
confidence to expand. 
Some of the key steps include:
•  an ambitious EU-wide renewable energy 
target for 2020, building on, formalising 
and strengthening the existing Renewables 
Directive;
•  the direction of financial assistance to 
address market failures and support 
renewable energy, including research,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
design and development support for the 
development and demonstration of offshore 
wind generation;
•  action to encourage financial institutions to 
invest in very large offshore wind projects, 
including direction of investment or underwriting 
by government-controlled banks and credit 
agencies such as the EIB and ERBD; and
•  an EU-wide strategic approach to the 
development of electricity grid capacity 
which anticipates the long-term requirements 
for offshore wind, including support, for 
example through the TEN programme, for 
the installation of offshore networks that will 
encourage optimal development of Europe’s 
offshore wind resources.Year 300

Sea Wind Europe 3
1. Introduction
1.1 Brief
Greenpeace (GP) has commissioned Garrad 
Hassan and Partners (GH) to provide a realistic 
vision for the development of offshore wind 
power to 2020. Sea Wind Europe  considers 
whether an electricity output of 720TWh/year 
(just under a third of present demand among 
the EU 15 – the 15 current member states of 
the European Union) is a viable aspiration for 
2020, and identifies the key actions that would 
be required to deliver this level of development. 
In Sea Wind Europe , GH has drawn largely on 
existing information and knowledge – for the 
most part there is no proprietary analysis. The 
report attempts to highlight the most pertinent 
information for policy-makers, and assumes 
only a basic understanding of technical issues. 
Those with an interest in further technical 
detail are directed to the forthcoming European 
Commission (EC) publication, Wind Energy, The 
Facts , 2003 update1, and the reference section 
at the end of this report.
1.2 Context
The majority of people in the EU are 
concerned about the environmental effects 
of conventional energy supplies, and are 
supportive of renewable energy as an 
alternative. This is borne out by numerous 
national, local and project-specific surveys, 
which consistently return approval ratings in 
excess of 70%.2 The EC also recently reported 
the results of an EU 15 ’Eurobarometer’ survey 
of 16,000 people, Energy: Issues, Options 
and Technologies3. Among the findings were that 90% of those polled considered global 
warming a serious problem that requires 
immediate action, while nuclear power 
stations and/or waste management were 
almost universally cited as a priority safety 
concern. Furthermore, the survey found that 
renewables play a significant part in people’s 
vision of the future, more so than any other 
conventional technology: 40% thought that 
renewables (other than hydropower) would 
be cheaper than conventional alternatives by 
2050 (compared to 24% for hydropower, the 
next highest); 67% thought that non-hydro 
renewables would be best for the environment 
in 2050 (followed by 38% for hydro).
Promotion of renewable energy is an 
important part of the EC’s energy policies. 
Europe is embarking on a transition in the 
way energy needs are met, driven by an 
environmental agenda. But there is ongoing 
discussion on the pace and nature of change 
which is desirable given economic and other 
considerations. Despite the fact that they offer 
an environmental solution, some people believe 
that there are practical reasons why renewables 
should not, and cannot, be developed on a large 
scale at the present time. These doubts include 
concerns about the cost and technical feasibility 
of large-scale renewables deployment. 
Sea Wind Europe  will address these doubts and 
fears in respect of renewables, and rationalise 
the challenges and risks that they do present in 
the context of the challenges and risks posed 
by the ’business as usual’ scenario. 

4
1.3 The scenario
Sea Wind Europe  takes the aspiration of 
720TWh/year of electricity from offshore wind 
by 2020 and examines what might be required 
to achieve this level of output. 
Current EU 15 supply of electricity (as of 2002) 
is some 2,521TWh/year4, and by 2020 the figure 
is forecast in European Union Energy Outlook 
to 2020  to reach 3,124TWh/year5. If this 
forecast is accepted, then under our scenario 
offshore wind will be supplying 23% of total EU 
15 demand in 2020. Such an achievement would 
place offshore wind in a market position as 
significant as that of conventional technologies 
today. Much stronger efforts in the EU towards 
improving energy efficiency could reduce future 
levels of demand. In such circumstances the 
offshore wind developed under the proposed 
scenario would meet a correspondingly greater 
portion of EU 15 energy needs.  
Sea Wind Europe  considers just one 
technology – offshore wind – as a case 
in hand, to examine whether large-scale 
deployment might be a reasonable aim  
for that technology alone. Offshore  
wind is a renewable energy technology  
which, given the right policies, is set for 
large-scale development in several  
European countries, and on a scale 
comparable to conventional power  
stations. Sea Wind Europe  illustrates  
how entry into the energy mainstream 
might be achieved by this promising new 
technology. There is already a wealth of 
experience in onshore wind, which is being 
exploited in the development of other 
renewable energy technologies. Similarly, 
many of the conclusions drawn in this  
report are equally applicable to other 
renewable energy technologies.

Sea Wind Europe 5
2.1 Historical growth
Figure 2.1 shows the cumulative wind 
energy capacity installed in the EU to 2002, 
the majority of which is onshore wind. It 
demonstrates an almost 33% year-on-year 
growth rate. The bars show actual installed 
capacity at the end of each year, the line is the 
fitted exponential curve. At the start of 2003 
there was an installed capacity of 23GW. 
Figure 2.1 European Union cumulative 
installed wind power capacity
Data up to 2001 from6 and for 2002 from7
The EC-commissioned European Union Energy 
Outlook to 2020  (published in 1999)4 predicted 
an increase of 13.8GW of wind energy capacity 
over 10 years to 2010 – in fact there has been 
a growth of exactly this amount in less than 
half the time, between the years 1999 and 
2002. Similarly, in World Energy Outlook  (1998 
edition)8, the International Energy Agency 
(IEA) predicted 15GW of wind capacity in the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) countries of Europe 
by 2010 – a figure which was reached and 
exceeded in 2001 in just the EU 15.
Wind energy industry predictions, showing 
greater confidence, have been closer to reality. 
The annual publication International Wind 
Energy Development: World Market Update  
by BTM Consult is the industry’s most widely 
recognised forecast. In 19999 it predicted an installed European (including Eastern Europe) 
capacity of 21.8GW by 2003, and 40.7GW for 
2008. So it is clear that wind energy has already 
exceeded some predictions, even those of 
the wind industry itself. The IEA and European 
Union Energy Outlook  predictions were based 
largely on ’business as usual’ models. Industry 
predictions have probably been more realistic as 
they have tended to be based on knowledge of 
specific national policies and a more pragmatic 
hands-on view. 
2.2 Expectations
If the 33% growth rate continues, wind power 
will reach just under 4TW by 2020. However, 
no one is predicting the continuation of this 
level of growth, which can be achieved from a 
low base but would be more difficult to sustain 
from the existing higher base and even more so 
from anticipated future levels. Rather growth is 
expected, even by the industry, to slow down 
over the next few decades but nevertheless 
remain substantial.
The IEA’s latest predictions for wind energy, 
made in 200210, have been revised upwards. 
Its OECD Europe ’reference scenario’ predicts 
33GW of wind power for 2010, and 59GW for 
2020 (figures for the EU 15, given separately 
for the first time in this report, are 33GW 
and 57GW respectively). An additional 
’alternative policy scenario’ in the 2002 
edition of World Energy Outlook  has a more 
optimistic outlook for renewables, taking 
into account not only established policies but 
some proposed ones. For Europe, this means 
achievement of the Renewables Directive 
targets (unlike the reference scenario, 
capacity predictions for wind energy are  
not provided for this scenario). 
BTM’s latest predictions, also made in 200211, 
forecast 59GW in Europe by 2007 (of which 
offshore contributes 5GW), and approximately 
107GW by 2012. At its June 2003 conference, 
the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) 
announced its new targets for 2020 as 180GW of 
wind power including 70GW of offshore capacity.2. Growth ratesGW installed

720TWh/year is equivalent to approximately 
240GW of offshore wind capacity. Figure 2.2 
below postulates a growth pattern for this 
amount of offshore wind power (the blue line), 
which is shown as an extension from the present-
day installed capacity of on- and offshore wind 
(the red line). The same figure also shows trend 
lines fitted to the IEA’s OECD Europe baseline (in 
orange) and BTM’s predictions (in green) for on- 
and offshore wind power. 
Clearly Figure 2.2 combines predictions which 
are not strictly comparable, but it is nonetheless 
useful in comparing the general scale of 
development expected. The vast majority of wind 
energy development to date has been within 
the EU 15 countries. The only major difference 
between BTM’s and the IEA’s predictions is the 
inclusion in BTM’s predictions of some transition 
economies, which make a negligible contribution 
to the 2007 prediction (the contribution to the 
2012 prediction is unknown).
The blue line for offshore wind in Figure 2.2 
is simply an illustration of how offshore wind 
might grow by 240GW between 2003 and 
2020. For 2003–05, it assumes that a base is 
established of nearly 5GW, after which offshore 
capacity grows at 40% per year to 2010, 26% per year from 2011 to 2015 and 23% per year 
from 2016 to 2020. This build-up in installation 
rates is considered more realistic than an 
alternative even year-on-year installation.
While the blue line shown in Figure 2.2 is 
well within BTM’s total wind energy growth 
predictions, it is nonetheless a very ambitious 
rate of growth for offshore wind. It exceeds by 
4.5GW BTM’s offshore prediction for 2007. The 
later years, for which there are no comparable 
predictions, would require very substantial 
volume increases each year. BTM’s predictions 
are based in part on expectations for policy 
measures in support of offshore wind, and 
clearly the growth rates postulated here require 
a very optimistic outlook on policy support 
for offshore wind in the EU. This is a key issue 
which is elaborated in later chapters.
2.3 Installation volumes
While the rate of offshore wind growth 
shown in Figure 2.2 is comparable to that 
achieved by onshore wind to date, the 
absolute volumes of installation required 
should also be considered. Installation of 
some 240GW of offshore wind power over 
17 years translates, very approximately, into 
48,000 5MW machines, at an average of a Year 300

little under eight installed per day. Present-
day offshore machines are rated at some 2–
3.6MW. Machines of 5MW are expected to be 
available by 2010, and possibly higher ratings 
thereafter. An average 5MW rating between 
now and 2020 is therefore an approximation.
At an EU Member State level, for smaller 
onshore turbines, this level of turbine 
installation is already achieved in Germany, 
which in 2002 increased its capacity by 
3,248MW. This is equivalent to an installation 
rate of approximately nine 1MW machines 
per day. BTM foresees installation of 11GW 
per year by 2012 for on- and offshore 
combined, which equates to, say, fifteen 2MW 
machines per day. The different turbine rating 
assumptions are a reflection of the timescale 
under consideration – it is the installation rate 
of machines which is important here.
Offshore is a challenging environment – in 
particular, the weather will limit construction 
windows. At present, a reasonable expectation 
might be installation of one turbine per day, 
per installation vessel. In order for this to be 
scaled up to level required for Sea Wind Europe , 
GH considers the number of projects coming 
forward to be the limiting factor.
Planning procedures are still being developed, 
especially for areas further offshore. These 
procedures will need to be finalised as a priority. 
No one Member State has plans in place for 
this kind of installation rate – namely eight 
machines per day. It is largely because of this 
limitation – the need to plan projects at a policy 
level – that EU-wide volume increases in the 
earlier years of the illustrative offshore wind 
scenario are shown as lower than the eight 
machines per day average, while later increases 
are correspondingly higher. These later, high 
installation levels are considered very ambitious 
and will require a significant and concerted 
effort now to set government plans and 
procedures in motion.Some promise is shown by recent engineering 
concepts that may speed up the installation 
process. These are discussed in Chapter 5.
2.4 Conclusions
Predictions of installed wind energy capacity 
which rely on ’business as usual’ models have 
tended to be pessimistic. The wind industry’s 
own most recognised predictions, based on 
a pragmatic, policy-focused approach, have 
been much closer to reality. This suggests 
that specific wind or renewables policies are 
a crucial factor in achieving the high levels of 
growth seen to date.
Achievement of 240GW of offshore wind 
capacity by 2020 in the EU appears a 
reasonable expectation in the context of the 
growth of onshore wind power to date, and 
recent industry predictions for the growth of 
both onshore and offshore wind. Nevertheless, 
given the volume increases required, GH 
considers this figure to be an ambitious aim 
for offshore wind alone. This is in large part 
because planning procedures, policies and 
targets in place in Member States and at  
EU level do not currently provide for such  
a significant increase in offshore wind.
There is therefore an urgent need for early 
action to establish the necessary policy, planning 
and consenting framework, if these ambitious 
aspirations for offshore wind are to be realised.

3.  Resource and  
development scale
3.1 Resource estimation
On a broad scale, the potential wind resource 
can be modelled using meteorological data as 
an input, and taking into account the effects 
of elevation, topography and other factors. 
Typically, such models allow derivation of, at 
least, wind speed estimates for a specified 
height, as a gridded or contour dataset12. By 
combining this with assumptions about the 
technology and its deployment density (the 
number of machines installed per unit area), an 
energy (usually kWh per annum) estimate can 
be produced. Wind is ubiquitous, and although 
there are wind speeds below which exploitation 
would not be economic, other considerations 
are often the limiting factor on deployment.
Most wind energy resource studies start with a 
top-level theoretical resource that is progressively 
reduced through consideration of constraints, 
ranging from geographically delineated 
protected areas to economic cut-offs. This is 
usually computed in a Geographical Information 
System (GIS), sometimes supplemented by 
other processing. There are inevitably limits to 
the extent to which these modelling exercises 
can reflect reality – data availability is the main 
limitation, but there are also some constraints that 
simply cannot be modelled accurately. 
Such studies are useful in estimating upper 
bounds on deployment, the effects of known 
constraints, interactions between constraints 
and likely patterns of development. A GIS 
also helps visualisation of development scale. 
Because technology undergoes progressive 
development, and the nature of constraints 
evolves as solutions are found and new factors 
emerge, resource estimates tend to have a 
time-limited validity. 
In this chapter some previous resource estimates 
are briefly reviewed. Existing estimates are 
revised, using different assumptions as to 
technology and technical constraints. A GIS 
is used to visualise the scale of development 
implied by a 720TWh/year target.3.2 Previous estimates
A 1995 study for the Commission, Study of 
Offshore Wind Energy in the EC  by GH and 
Germanischer Lloyd13, estimated a total EU 
(excepting Sweden) resource of 3,029TWh/
year. This represents the resource within 
30km of shore and in areas with water depths 
of no greater than 40m. Where data were 
available, it also excludes areas around oil and 
gas infrastructure and cables, protected areas, 
military areas and marine traffic routes. 
Wind Force 1214, a 2003 Greenpeace/EWEA 
publication, further constrains the 1995 
estimate by assuming development only in 
waters up to 20m depth, and largely in the 
10–30km offshore range, at a reduced density. 
These very conservative assumptions lead to an 
estimated resource of 313.6TWh/year.
3.3 Current approach
GIS was employed in this study to gain an 
appreciation of the scale of development 
implied, through the use of maps, as opposed 
to any more sophisticated attempt to estimate 
the total resource or to show likely deployment 
locations. Scenario-based maps illustrating 
a build-up to 240GW installed capacity are 
shown in Section 3.4. The process by which 
these maps were developed is explained in 
full in Appendix A. The key assumptions are 
summarised below.
A wind speed GIS layer was derived primarily 
from the previously mentioned EC study 
dataset13. Assuming a medium-range 
deployment density15 of 8MW/km2 and a power 
curve from a typical modern offshore wind 
turbine, an annual energy yield (AEY) was 
derived for each GIS grid square. 
Sea depth and distance to shore were the 
key economic and technical factors used to 
determine potential resource and possible siting 
areas. The ranges assumed to be accessible 
were increased over the course of the period to 
2020 (as described in the scenarios below). 

Sea Wind Europe 9
Where digital data were available, specific 
potential constraints were taken into  
account in the GIS. For traffic zones, oil  
and gas platforms, pipelines and cables,  
any kilometre square of the GIS in which  
their presence was recorded was excluded. 
For traffic zones, a one kilometre square 
buffer zone was also excluded.
It is noted that, when investigating a 
potential site, developers must consider 
in detail a wide range of constraints. 
Potential impacts, and their magnitude, are 
subject to in-depth assessment in both the 
Strategic Environmental Assessment and the 
Environmental Impact Assessment processes. 
The former is an assessment of government 
plans and policies carried out prior to 
their implementation, the latter an impact 
assessment carried out by a developer in 
support of an application for project consent.
Taking the exclusions described, and within 
bounding assumptions for scenarios to 2010, 
2015 and 2020, wind farms were placed 
from judgement offshore of coastal EU 15 
countries. This judgement included visual 
checking against Admiralty Charts for any 
obvious constraints, knowledge of existing 
wind farms and planned developments, 
and feedback from Greenpeace offices 
throughout Europe. This was a purely 
indicative approach to show development 
scale. There is no suggestion at all that the 
resulting locations are where wind farms 
should, or could, locate. 
Assuming approximately the growth pattern  
of offshore wind postulated in the previous 
chapter (see Figure 2.2) and shown below in 
Figure 3.1, three sequential scenarios were 
considered. These were as follows: 
2010:  In addition to the considerations 
described above, wind farms were limited to 
areas within a band 5–30km from shore, and 
within 30m depth. The 5km boundary was to reflect a general move by some countries to 
impose a coastal buffer zone for very large 
offshore wind farms on visual grounds. The 
30km from shore and 30m depth constraints 
reflect a combination of anticipated technical 
and cost-related limitations to 2010. On 
technical grounds, wind farms were placed to 
avoid locations that experience particularly 
extreme weather conditions. 
2015:  As offshore wind farms move into 
more challenging environments, they might 
first be expected to move further offshore 
and to slightly deeper locations, in relatively 
less exposed areas (rather than shallow but 
exposed locations closer to shore). For this 
intermediate scenario, additional area was 
therefore released by relaxing the depth 
limitation to 50m and the distance limitation 
to 5–40km. 
2020: By 2020, it is considered that 
exposed locations may become cost-
effective, and hence they are now released 
for development, as well as areas outside 
the 40km from shore constraint, and at 
depths of up to 100m. Even if technology 
allows, deeper, more exposed and further 
offshore locations are still likely to be more 
expensive, and thus a site which combines all 
three – deep, far off, and exposed – is not 
represented in this scenario.Figure 3.1 Postulated growth of

3.5  Capacity and  
annual energy yield
Tables 3.1 to 3.3 show the increases in 
offshore capacity and AEY to each scenario 
year. Table 3.4 shows the cumulative results 
for 2020. AEY values are derived from wind 
speeds modelled at 100m hub height. The 
capacity factor in all scenarios is approximately 35%. Each table also 
shows the area taken up by the wind farms 
placed in each scenario (including the space 
between turbines), and the percentage that 
this represents of the area available for 
development after constraints.

4.1 Experience
To date, the few existing commercial offshore 
wind projects have largely been developed 
on the balance sheet of the developers. As 
more and bigger offshore wind projects are 
developed, access to project finance will 
be essential in order to mobilise large-scale 
development. Without it, offshore wind will not 
emerge to fulfil its present potential.  
It is partly because the financial risks, especially 
construction risk, are not yet properly 
understood by lenders that conventional project 
finance has not as yet been utilised for offshore 
wind. It is also because the market prospects 
for offshore wind, even in the short term, are 
very uncertain in most EU Member States.
Although risks are not yet quantified, it does 
not follow that offshore wind is likely to be a 
particularly risky business. Finance is readily 
available for offshore oil and gas production, for 
example, where risks certainly exist but where 
they are understood largely through experience. 
Also, there is a tremendous momentum 
associated with such a large, long-standing 
industry: lenders are not only familiar with the oil 
and gas sector, they are confident that there will 
always be a market for its products. Oil prices and 
predictions are a long-established, international 
benchmark for the economy as a whole. 
So risk in itself is not the overriding 
impediment. Rather it is the relative novelty 
of the offshore wind industry, and the lack of 
established benchmarks against which risks 
can be quantified. The level of risk, even if it 
can be quantified, has implications for the cost 
of finance, and so it is generally desirable to 
reduce risk.
There are a number of ways in which risk can be 
quantified or otherwise addressed. Construction 
risk can be quantified through learning from 
real experience. Risk can also be offset through 
contractual allocation, as is common in a number of industrial sectors. This is where a contracting 
party explicitly accepts an identified risk, and 
its financial consequences, thus neutralising 
the financial consequences to the lender. It 
has knock-on implications for the make-up 
of the future industry, insofar as it implies the 
entry of some major conventional construction 
contractors credit-worthy enough to take on 
this kind of exposure.
Market uncertainty is largely in the hands of 
governments, at Member State and European 
level. Renewables markets are undergoing 
evolution, and there is a trend towards 
new liberalised market mechanisms such as 
tradeable certificates for renewable energy 
output or carbon content. Again, these markets 
are relatively new, and there are no long-
standing price precedents or trends.
The early days of onshore wind were similarly 
characterised by a hesitance to lend to projects 
of which there was little previous experience. 
Many banks are now familiar with the onshore 
wind sector, and learning from experience was 
an essential part of attracting finance. So there 
are useful parallels to be drawn with the current 
offshore situation, although a major difference 
is the sheer scale of development for offshore 
wind energy. The huge size of many projects, 
and hence the amounts of money involved, 
make it all the more imperative that there 
should be keen interest among the banks in 
financing offshore wind.
Some banks are starting to show interest in 
providing finance for offshore projects, and 
it seems likely that some initial deals will be 
realised, at least in the case of those banks 
which have shown a willingness to provide 
funds to wind energy in the past. Initially the 
banks are likely to enter the offshore market by 
providing term loans for projects that have been 
completed. This would not however be enough 
to deliver Sea Wind Europe -scale development. 
Because of the probable need for syndicated 
and other forms of debt, which are employed 4. Finance

Sea Wind Europe 23
for high-value finance deals, new banks, as yet 
unfamiliar with wind energy or offshore wind,  
will need to move into the sector. 
So it is imperative that banks across the board 
be willing to lend to offshore wind projects, and 
there are important roles for policy-makers, 
the wind industry and the banks themselves in 
ensuring that this happens. 
4.2 Levels of investment
Attracting finance to the offshore wind 
sector will need to overcome both perceived 
risk, and the requirement for much larger 
amounts of finance than has previously 
flowed to the onshore sector. 
The largest offshore wind farm to have been 
constructed at the time of writing, comprising 
eighty 2MW turbines at Horns Rev in Denmark, 
had a project cost of some ¤270 million16, 
or ¤1,687 per kW. Costs are expected to fall 
between now and 2020 (see Chapter 6), but 
at a very simplistic level the 240GW envisaged 
in Sea Wind Europe , at a capital cost of, say, 
¤1,000–1,687 per kW spread over 17 years, 
represents an up-front capital investment  
of approximately ¤14–24 billion per year. 
This figure compares to the IEA’s 2002 World 
Energy Outlook10 estimates of required new 
capacity of 658GW in the EU 15 between 2000 
and 2030, at a total investment of $531 billion, or 
approximately ¤645 per kW. At a steady installation 
rate, this translates to just over ¤14 billion per year. 
To judge from the per kW cost, the IEA 
appears to be assuming that all new capacity 
between now and 2030 will be provided by 
gas-fired generation. At present, wind energy 
is generally more capital-intensive than gas-
fired generation, although it has zero fuel 
costs. This means that, per kW, it must find 
more up-front investment.
While perhaps comparable in money terms 
to investment in other sectors, ¤14–24 billion per year is a significant amount of capital 
investment, and especially so for a new 
industry. In onshore wind, banks have tended 
to contribute debt on a ’project’ basis (that is 
the loan is secured at least partly against the 
project itself, as opposed to the assets of a 
corporation, for instance). Financed projects (in 
which commercial banks provided at least some 
of the debt) recorded by Thomson Financial, 
across Europe and across all sectors, cost a 
total of ¤37.6 billion in 2001 and ¤1,584 billion in 
2002. The 2002 figures are heavily skewed by 
one gas field development project in Russia17. 
Given the difficulties in recording all deals and 
the relevant financial details, it is difficult to 
draw any firm conclusions. It is perhaps worth 
noting that some of the largest bank-financed 
projects listed by Thomson Financial were some 
form of government-backed public-private 
partnership or state privatisation, suggesting 
that public sector involvement in energy sector 
finance deals is not unusual.
Alternative means of raising finance are 
beginning to appear in the wind energy 
sector (see case study in Section 4.3). The 
emerging offshore sector is attracting many 
corporations with a wealth of experience in 
raising finance for multi-million euro projects. 
This collective experience can be expected 
to contribute to the development of finance 
models for offshore wind. Nevertheless, in 
terms of the appetite for strictly commercial 
financing of projects, there is a question mark 
over whether the levels required for 240GW 
of offshore wind by 2020 can be achieved. 
This would require banks to channel significant 
proportions of project funds to offshore wind. 
This in turn implies that for the benefits of a 
Sea Wind Europe -scale wind industry to be 
realised, there is a need to ensure that financial 
institutions are willing and able to make 
significant investments in offshore wind. 
4.3 European banks
Previous sections have alluded to the central 

24
importance of early project demonstration, 
and of learning from the resulting experience. 
Institutions such as the European Investment 
Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) 
play a very useful role in supporting such 
early development, but involvement in the 
renewables sector is variable and to date 
relatively minor.
In an evaluation of its energy-related 
investments, EIB acknowledges a low level 
of involvement in the renewables sector, 
and specifically in wind energy. Of all energy 
investments made by EIB between 1990 and 
2000, less than 1% were in wind energy projects. 
EIB states that it has ’financed a very low share 
of the substantial increase in renewable energy 
investments during the second half of the 1990s, 
particularly wind energy’18.
EBRD has recently initiated a strategic 
assessment of the potential for renewable 
energy for the countries in which it invests19. 
The ultimate aim is proactively to identify 
candidates for investment. In the first stage 
of the work, EBRD commissioned a series 
of renewable energy profiles for each of its 
Countries of Operation (COO). An anticipated 
second stage will focus on project-specific 
feasibility assessments. The draft terms of 
reference for this second stage state in their 
rationale that ’It is believed that EBRD can play 
a significant role in the development of the 
renewable energy market in the COO as it will 
be seen as an “honest broker” backing sound 
projects for the benefit of the COO.’ 
While EIB’s acknowledgement of a lack of 
renewables investment and EBRD’s recent 
assessments are good signs, there is clearly 
room for a wholesale shift in emphasis in these 
institutions towards renewable energy.Case study   
KfW Group
Many German wind farms benefit from loans 
channelled through the government-backed 
bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW).  
The KfW group is owned by the Federal 
Government (80%) and the regional 
governments or Länder (20%). It acts to 
promote German interests at home and abroad, 
and has a strong environmental agenda.  
 
Case study  
Evolution of wind farm finance
Onshore wind farm finance has traditionally 
been on a project-by-project basis, with limited 
recourse to anything but the project (meaning 
that liability for losses is limited to the assets of 
the project itself and does not extend to any 
other assets of the company). This has usually 
involved just one bank and, by finance standards, 
relatively small loans. However , as wind energy 
moves more into the mainstream, it is beginning 
to adopt the kind of financing arrangements 
required to raise significant funds. 
In December 2002, German bank HVB 
announced a large loan to a wind power 
project, in the form of a syndicated package 
totalling ¤213 million. The credit facility, for 
Spanish developer Eurovento, is for six wind 
farms with a combined capacity of 201MW. 
Seven banks joined the over-subscribed 
syndicate with HVB and lead arranger Fortis.
More recently, the American electricity utility 
FPL completed the first ever wind energy bond 
deal, when in June 2003 it successfully sold 
bonds in New York worth $380 million for the 
finance of seven wind farms (totalling 680MW) 
in the USA.

4.4 Conclusions
Building confidence in offshore wind is the key 
to unlocking the large sums of money necessary 
for a thriving industry. Confidence will be 
nurtured first and foremost through experience 
of real projects, and through provision of 
a long-term, stable market environment 
for offshore wind. These are fundamental 
requirements, from which other necessary 
actions can be expected to flow. 
Demonstration projects will need to span a 
range of environmental conditions, and hence 
there will be an ongoing need for demonstration, 
as there is in other industrial sectors, as the 
technology progresses and breaks new barriers. 
Governments, institutional banks and industry will 
all need to play a role: governments in ensuring 
that projects are given a consenting framework 
and grant support; institutional banks in provision 
of soft loans; and industry in proposing and 
delivering projects. Lessons learned should be 
widely disseminated throughout Europe.
Market provision is largely in the hands of 
governments, but they may look to industry players 
to detail, and justify, their needs in this respect.  
Given these two building blocks – 
demonstration and market – work can usefully 
begin in a number of areas, including:
• Attracting commercial banks to the offshore 
wind sector. Banks have certain tests and 
procedures before funds can be released, and 
often there are dedicated teams specialising 
in financing a particular sector. Significant 
levels of lending to offshore wind therefore 
imply some institutional change and learning, 
which may be expected to occur over a 
period of six months to a year. This in turn 
suggests a need for timely action.
•  Encouraging the development of 
finance structures: contract and project 
management structures can be expected to 
evolve to reflect the nature of the business 
offshore.
•  Assisting successful financing of large-
scale offshore wind projects by redirecting 
lending within EU Member States and EU-
controlled financial institutions towards the 
renewables sector.

5. The technology
This chapter considers whether the technology 
can meet the challenge of large-scale offshore 
deployment. Each main component of a wind 
turbine is considered and analysed to determine 
whether a significant growth in demand is a 
reasonable expectation. Figure 5.1 illustrates 
these main components and their basic 
composition.  
The scenario under consideration is the 
installation of some 240GW of offshore wind 
energy over 17 years, which translates to 
approximately 48,000 5MW machines, at an 
average rate of just under eight per day.

Steel, concrete or mixture5.1 Blades
The materials of which blades are made are 
predominantly composites, or reinforced 
plastics – essentially, fibres of a stiff material 
such as glass, carbon or wood, bound together 
by an epoxy or polyester resin. The composites 
used for wind turbine blades are very similar 
in make-up to those employed in the boat-
building industry for hulls and masts, as well 
as in the aerospace industry for aeroplane 
nose-cones, nacelles and tail sections. As a 
group, composites are widely used in everyday 
manufactured goods.
Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) has been the 
favoured material to date. Because of their 
high strength to mass ratio, carbon fibre spars 
(running through the central longitudinal axis of 
the blade) may become more common in larger 
offshore blades in the future.
The wind industry sources its blade materials 
from a specialist subsection of the composites 
market that supplies pre-pregs. These consist 
of preheated fibres encased in resin, rolled 
and stored in drums at a low temperature. The 
blade manufacturers then heat the pre-pregs 
for use in moulds, adding other constituents 
as appropriate. For the most part, pre-pregs 
come in standard forms, but latterly products 
have been specifically tailored to the wind 
industry, with a small number of companies 
specialising in supply to turbine manufacturers 
(see case study below).
Table 5.1 below details some approximate 
figures for the market volume suggested 
by an industry output of eight 5MW, 120m 
rotor diameter turbines per day20. It compares 
blades made wholly of GRP and blades with 
carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) spars.21 
Data for total (i.e. all industry sectors) world 
and US market volumes are provided for 
comparison in Table 5.2. 


Sea Wind Europe 27
The current world production of glass fibre is 
large compared to the projected wind energy 
requirement. There may not be much spare 
capacity built in, but the large size of the 
industry means that extra capacity could be 
added relatively easily. Restricted supply of 
fabrics has been experienced by the blade 
industry in the past, but this has been addressed 
by longer-term purchasing arrangements.
The current world production of carbon fibre is 
dominated by Toray and Mitsubishi and is not 
large in relation to the projected wind energy 
requirement if carbon-based spars were to 
become the norm, which GH considers highly 
unlikely. The widespread application of carbon in 
blades worldwide would make wind energy the 
largest single market for the material.
Larger modern plants would allow extra 
capacity of several thousand tonnes per annum to be added, but this is not happening 
yet due to uncertainties over the rate of 
uptake of carbon for blade production. In 
practice, an addition in capacity of the order 
of 25,000 tonnes per annum could take five to 
ten years to achieve.
There is currently limited supply of the 
high-grade PAN (polyacrylanitrile) precursor 
fibre required for conventional carbon fibre 
manufacture. Another manufacturer, Zoltek, has 
developed a carbon fibre based on commercial-
grade PAN, with mixed success. 
An increase in supply to meet growing demand 
would be dependent on the lead times required 
for technical development, the re-equipment 
of blade production facilities for new moulds, 
possibly more demanding materials handling, 
and retraining of personnel. For these reasons, 
manufacturers may wish to extend the use of T able 5.1 Approximate materials volumes for blade construction

glass composites as far as possible by selective 
use of carbon, thereby avoiding a step change 
to CFRP-dominated construction.
The volumes of resin required in the projected 
scenarios are still relatively small quantities 
in relation to the world market for such 
materials. The base resins are shared by many 
applications, specific blends being created for 
structural use.
Plant for mixing formulated products and for 
making pre-pregs can readily be installed with 
capacities of tens of thousands of tonnes per 
annum and is therefore not expected to pose 
a limiting factor on future volumes. Either the 
all-GRP or the CFRP/GRP hybrid scenario would 
represent a huge growth potential for the 
current specialist intermediates (mixed resin 
and pre-preg) suppliers.
In Germany, work is under way into establishing 
methods of recycling glass fibre material used in 
wind turbines when they are decommissioned. 
This short analysis suggests that, with the 
exception of carbon fibre, raw material supply 
should not be an issue. Specialist suppliers of 
pre-pregs to the industry will need to increase 
their capacity, and will need sufficient warning 
to enable them to do so.

As discussed in the main text, suppliers are 
increasingly tailoring their products to this 
growth industry. SP Systems is a UK-based 
composites technology and manufacturing 
firm, supplying products to the wind energy, 
marine, transport and oil and gas sectors. 
In 1999 it relocated and expanded its main 
manufacturing facility, in part to accommodate 
a purpose-built impregnation line capable of 
producing heavyweight materials required by 
its main wind energy and marine customers. 
Hexcel is a multinational composites company 
with 11 manufacturing facilities in Europe 
and the USA, and a joint venture company in 
Japan. As well as the wind energy sector, it 
supplies products to the automotive, marine, 
aerospace, rail and sports goods industries. 
Other players in the composites industry are 
already positioning themselves to supply a 
growing wind energy market. In May 2003, 
the magazine  Reinforced Plastics  brought out 
a wind energy special edition 24 in which, 
for example, Dow Chemical states that in 
the context of a growth in wind energy 
its ’supply capabilities are global’, and that 
’as the industry’s key players expand and 
invest in geographic markets outside their 
current participation ˇ [Dow Chemical] is in 
a position to supply.’

Case study
LM Glasfiber
LM Glasfiber is the world’s leading blade 
manufacturer, making approximately 45% 
of the world’s wind turbine blades. A Danish 
company, its origins go back to the (then) 
emerging fibreglass industry in the 1950s. 
At that time LM manufactured caravans and 
boats. Wind turbine blade production began 
in 1978, and today LM’s principal output and 
core business is wind turbine blades. It has 11 
production facilities across Denmark, Spain, 
India, China and the USA, and has some 3,300 
skilled employees.
In 2001, the fund manager Doughty Hanson 
acquired LM Glasfiber for its private equity 
portfolio. Commenting on the deal, Doughty 
Hanson stated that it was ’delighted to acquire 
LM Glasfiber, which is a high-quality, successful 
business. We now intend to continue the 
international development of LM Glasfiber and 
thereby retain its market-leading positions 
in this fast-growing and internationally 
developing industry.’ LM joins companies 
such as TAG Heuer (watch manufacturer) and 
Umbro (football-branded clothing) in Doughty 
Hanson’s private equity portfolio.
5.2 Towers
Wind turbine towers consist of steel plate cut 
and rolled into a series of conical sections, 
which are then welded together into larger 
sections. In installation, tower sections are 
bolted to each other. Tower manufacturers 
purchase steel as hot-rolled plates, which they 
then cold-roll and weld using fairly standard 
machinery. The same manufacturers also tend 
to be producers of pressure vessels and oil 
tanks. An increase in demand for towers could 
easily be met by an expansion of facilities and 
the necessary equipment.
The production of 48,000 towers for 5MW 
machines would require approximately 12 
million tonnes of steel (at 250 tonnes per 
5MW turbine, including a steel monopile 
foundation), or an average of 0.7 million 
tonnes per year to meet the Sea Wind Europe  target. This compares to annual EU 15 crude 
steel production of 158 million tonnes in 2001 
and 2002 and 54.5 million tonnes in 200325. EU 
production of rolled steel products in 2003 is 
forecast to have been 140 million tonnes26, of 
which 9.4 million will have been hot-rolled plate.
The 2003 slump in crude steel production in 
the EU reflects overproduction in previous 
years, increasing imports and losses in the 
manufacturing sector. The European steel 
industry is very much in need of new markets. 
Steel is a highly recyclable material. 
Approximately 47% of EU steel production is 
from recycled scrap.  
 
Case study
Monsud
Monsud is a long-established Italian 
manufacturer of steel structures for large civil 
engineering projects. Wind energy projects 
now form a significant part of its business, 
along with other forms of renewable energy 
such as solar and geothermal. For the wind 
energy sector, Monsud provides tubular and 
lattice towers for wind turbines and electricity 
pylons. The company has two manufacturing 
facilities, one in Tufo, and the other in Avellino 
in southern Italy.
To date, Monsud has installed more than 1,000 
towers (lattice and tubular) for Vestas and 
Bonus wind turbines. 
5.3 Foundations
Two different foundation types have been 
utilised for existing offshore wind farms – the 
monopile and the gravity-based foundation. 
Further options exist, including a tripod 
structure which is proposed for the Borkum 
West project in Germany.
Monopiles  are effectively an extension of the 
steel tower, driven or grouted into the seabed. 
They are also used extensively in the off- and 
nearshore environment for supporting oil and gas 
platforms, jetties and other coastal structures. 

30
Manufacture is similar in process to that of 
steel towers, but at present there are very few 
facilities equipped to roll the large-diameter, 
thick steel tubes required for foundations.
Several manufacturers have foreseen this gap 
in the market, and have plans under way to 
establish the necessary capability. For example, 
Sif Group has plans to quadruple its capacity 
to manufacture monopiles, and there has 
been entry of new monopile manufacturers 
in Scotland. Sea access (for raw material 
import and product export) and space are key 
requirements for monopile manufacture, which 
tends to favour old shipyards and coastal oil 
and gas facilities.  
Case study
Sif Group
Based in the Netherlands, Sif Group specialises 
in the production of thick-wall steel tubular 
structures. Traditionally, its markets have been 
in offshore oil and gas (large piles and jackets), 
pressure vessels and other civil construction 
projects. Latterly, it has found a growing 
market in the manufacture of offshore wind 
monopile foundations, and has established a 
dedicated production line. 
Figure 5.2 shows a monopile from the Sif 
production line, and Figure 5.3 Sif’s shipyard 
on the river Maas.
Figure 5.2 Wind turbine monopile 
foundation at Sif factoryFigure 5.3 Sif shipyard
Gravity-based foundations: there are a 
number of options for gravity foundations, 
which can be either blocks or caissons of, 
typically, steel and/or concrete, with the 
caisson types ballasted with water, iron or 
grout. Gravity foundations are also used 
in the offshore oil and gas industry for 
supporting platforms. Those involved in 
the manufacture of gravity foundations 
have tended to be large civil construction 
companies. Like monopile manufacture, 
fabrication requires facilities with sea access 
and space. Temporary yards can also be set 
up to construct foundations close to site.  
Case study
Gravity foundations, 
Middelgrunden
The Middelgrunden offshore wind farm 
employs gravity-based concrete and steel 
composite foundations – a steel inner 
encased in reinforced concrete – designed 
by engineers Carl Bro. Construction and 
transportation were undertaken by a 
syndicate of two construction companies, 
Monberg & Thorsen and Phil & Son. 
Manufacture took place in a nearby dry 
dock at the old Burmeister & Wain shipyard 
(shown in Figure 5.4), brought back into 
operation by the syndicate after eight 
years of inactivity27.


Sea Wind Europe 31
Figure 5.4 Foundation manufacture at 
Burmeister & Wain shipyard dry dock
Other structures: a number of other 
foundation designs have been proposed, 
mostly (although not exclusively) drawing 
on designs already in use in other offshore 
sectors. These typically make use of piling, 
gravity or a combination of the two in the 
foundation, but elaborate on the total support 
structure to provide stability for larger 
machines and deeper locations. 
Thus the tripod  supports a central tube which 
extends into the tower, with each corner of 
the tripod support piled into the seabed. A 
jacket  can be any of a variety of arrangements 
whereby a central tube is surrounded by 
numerous piled supports. 
Suction-based foundations have also been 
proposed, replacing the pile. At each point at 
which seabed penetration is required, an inverted 
’bucket’ forms the foundation. Suction is applied 
until it penetrates to the desired depth. 
There is also a potentially distinct and 
significant market for the provision of 
substation support structures, which are 
likely to be similar in design to those used for 
oil and gas minimum facility platforms. Figure 
5.5 shows the installation of the first ever 
offshore grid transformer, at Horns Rev.
The design of new support structures for 
offshore wind turbines is likely to continue and evolve over the next decade. In contrast 
to onshore, where turbines are classified 
according to their ability to withstand a range 
of wind speeds, offshore is a more complicated 
environment which combines wind, wave, ice 
and sea current loads. Ironically, the wind is less 
turbulent offshore and hence, in some senses, 
is more benign. Foundations and support 
structures are likely to be much more specific 
to each site, which in turn provides an opening 
for new applications of conventional civil 
engineering concepts.  
Case study
Corus
The British steel company Corus is currently 
examining the application of its bi-steel 
product in support structures for offshore 
wind turbines. Bi-steel has been developed 
for its high strength and modularity and has 
applications across defence, offshore and 
other sectors. Each panel comprises a pair 
of steel plates connected by transverse steel 
bars. Strength can be increased by filling the 
gap with concrete or other materials.  
5.4 Nacelle
The nacelle provides an enclosure for the 
drive train and various electrical and other 
components, including the generator itself. 
With the exception of some direct-drive 
machines (see below) the generator  in a wind

turbine is close in function and design to a 
conventional electrical machine. An electrical 
machine is manufactured from electrical steel, 
copper and insulation materials. Each wind turbine 
also has a transformer of the same concept as 
those used throughout the electrical industry.
The gearbox  in the nacelle is designed 
specially for the wind industry, and consists 
of steel casing, bearings, gears and shafts. 
Current wind turbine gearbox manufacturers 
have all diversified from mainstream gearbox 
manufacture, some having separated off 
dedicated wind industry supplier companies. 
For example, the largest supplier to the 
European market, Winergy (formerly Flender), 
was separated and floated from its parent 
Deutsche Babcock. It now supplies exclusively 
to the wind energy sector.
Other major gearbox suppliers to the wind 
industry include Hansen, part of the UK 
Invensys group, Metso, a Finnish gearbox 
manufacturer, Lohman & Stolterfoht in 
Germany, Eickhoff in the US and Fellar in Spain.
A relatively new generation of direct-  
drive machines avoids the need for a  
gearbox. An option for these direct-drive 
machines is to utilise permanent magnet 
generators. This requires a supply of ferrite  
or rare earth magnets. Ferrite is readily 
available, but rare earth elements less so, 
although there are substantial supplies 
potentially available in China.
Modern offshore nacelles also now include 
handling equipment such as cranes, and 
extra access provision for boats and 
helicopters, which aim to maximise access 
and maintenance options. Figure 5.6 shows 
personnel being transferred to a turbine at 
Horns Rev. For some applications, nacelles are 
now being designed with their own helideck.Figure 5.6 Helicopter access
Case study
FKI nacelle facility,  
Loughborough, UK
FKI is a UK-based international engineering 
group, active in manufacturing, including of 
generators. Last year , FKI purchased the German 
wind turbine manufacturer DeWind, and has 
recently announced the establishment of nacelle 
production at an FKI facility in Loughborough. 
The operation will provide an increasing number 
of jobs over the next two years, and in its first 
year will have the capacity to produce over 130 
wind turbines of up to 2MW power rating. 
The acquisition also shows how the 
wind industry is offering diversification 
opportunities for sectors that are suffering 
from a downturn in orders. DeWind offered 
a good fit for FKI – DeWind had no in-house 
manufacturing capability, while FKI, suffering 
from a drop in the mechanical engineering 
sector, had spare manufacturing capacity. 
In the long term the DeWind factory is likely 
to work closely with adjacent FKI company 
facilities such as the generator manufacturer 
Brush and Hawker Siddeley, both well-known 
names in the power industry.

5.5 Installation vessels
As recently as 2002, many commentators 
were voicing concerns about the availability 
of specialised cranes acting as a limitation on 
the installation rate of offshore wind farms. 
However, following a good response from 
existing offshore contractors and some new 
market entries, it is clear that industry will 
respond well to any increase in demand, given 
a positive market environment. Installation 
vessels used for oil and gas or other purposes 
have been converted for use in offshore wind 
farms, while two companies (Mayflower Energy 
and Mammoet Van Oord) have invested in 
purpose-built vessels. 
Cable laying can be carried out from a range of 
existing vessels already used for this type of 
work and fully fitted with appropriate equipment, 
including cable carousels, remotely operated 
vehicles and trenching/jetting equipment.  
Case study:  
converted vessels A2SEA
The company A2SEA has installed turbines 
for both the Horns Rev (80 machines) and 
Nysted (72 machines) projects. It has patented 
a design which is effectively a converted 
carrier vessel, based on a widely used standard 
design, but with four legs underneath and 
several cranes on top. Its standard design 
means that there is an inbuilt flexibility to 
respond to increasing demand. Figure 5.7 
shows an A2SEA vessel at the Nysted project.
Case study:

Mammoet Van Oord
Mammoet Van Oord is a relatively young 
(2002) company, formed in response to the 
requirements of offshore wind farm and 
other marine installations. It is a joint venture 
between Mammoet, a world-wide heavy lifting 
and transport specialist, with commissions 
including salvage of the Kursk nuclear submarine, and Van Oord ACZ, an offshore 
sector construction and installation contractor. 
Other shareholders are Hovago Cranes (part 
of the Baris Group) and Marine Construct. 
The new company operates the purpose-built 
Jumping Jack (shown in Figure 5.8), a jack-up 
barge with an onboard crane, which was used 
to install the Horns Rev foundations.

the UK company Mayflower Energy. Purpose-
built, it is the direct result of entrepreneurial 
exploitation of an identified new market. 
The Resolution has been designed to install 
up to 10 turbines in one visit to the offshore 
location and to operate with no need for 
any supporting vessels. It can also be used in 
deploying foundations and cable laying.
5.6 Future development
There is a limit to the feasibility and cost-
effectiveness of placing structures on and in 
the sea bed as depth increases. For offshore 
oil and gas, this depth depends in part on the 
costs justified by the potential reserves. It 
then becomes necessary to consider floating 
structures: deep-water oil and gas platforms 
can be thought of as stationary boats with 
sophisticated moorings.
Several studies have investigated the concept 
of floating offshore wind turbines. Proposals for 
the floating base(s) differ from those of current 
offshore platforms, reflecting the multiple 
structures and very different loads experienced. 
Proposed mooring arrangements are drawn 
from existing practice.
GH has previously concluded that the concept 
of floating offshore wind farms is technically 
feasible, but that the mooring systems render 
it uneconomic at present. It nevertheless 
remains a possibility in some areas, with known 
investigations ongoing for applications in at 
least two European countries and Japan.
The use of new installation methods is also 
under investigation, including the concept 
of ’self-installation’ (methods that avoid the 
need for a large offshore crane barge) and 
other approaches that minimise assembly in 
the offshore environment. The main aim is to 
reduce installation time.
5.7 Conclusions
For the most part, the construction and 
installation of offshore wind turbines employ 
generally available materials and skills. It is the adaptation of these to the offshore wind 
sector that is often the innovative factor. There 
are many examples of companies making this 
adaptation, and in so doing finding a growing 
market for their products. Also, because other 
markets for traditional occupations in heavy 
engineering are declining, wind energy can offer 
a reversal of declining employment trends. 
The main raw material constituents for turbines 
– steel, composites and concrete – should not 
pose any limitations on large-scale deployment 
of offshore wind. Not surprisingly though, 
industry capacity to supply relevant precursors 
for composites, and to produce the final 
manufactured products, will need to gear up. 
Again, this will include the utilisation of disused 
and declining facilities belonging to the heavy 
engineering and other conventional sectors.
Niche market materials – carbon fibre and rare 
earth metals for magnets – are not widely 
utilised at present, and wholesale adoption 
in offshore wind would represent their single 
largest market.
In the medium to long term, and especially as 
turbines move into more hostile environments, 
there will be some technological challenges. 
These will include support structure design and 
access solutions. Experience in traditional civil 
engineering and marine industries is already 
being utilised in this respect.
Industry has already proved its willingness 
and ability to respond to an increase in 
market demand, perhaps most obviously 
in the installation sector where new and 
converted vessels have emerged to meet 
demand. Increasingly, companies not previously 
associated with wind energy are becoming 
aware of the potential for their business, and 
are positioning themselves to respond to 
market opportunities. 
These observations and conclusions on 
technology show that all the elements are 
in place for a thriving environment in which 

Sea Wind Europe 35
offshore wind becomes a mainstay of Europe’s 
industrial and technological sectors. Danish 
companies in particular have a significant 
market share, which demonstrates the benefits 
to be gained from early market support. 
Europe as a whole is well positioned to capture 
a significant share of the global offshore 
wind sector, but again (and this holds true 
for all aspects of the business) a long-term, 
stable market is the most effective means of 
encouraging companies to invest.There are also implied roles for development 
agencies and governments in targeting industrial 
and R&D support to the offshore wind sector. In 
order to capture economic benefits, significant 
growth in offshore wind needs to be underpinned 
by a determination to retain manufacturing facilities 
and know-how within Europe. Where facilities have 
been converted, or where there is experimentation 
with new ideas, support has invariably been 
channelled through inward investment, R&D or 
economic development policies.

6. Costs
A selection of comparative cost assessments 
is presented here to give an indication of the 
numbers which influence current decision-
making.
6.1 Generation costs
Generation costs are often quoted as either 
a cost per kWh or a capital cost per kW. The 
former requires assumptions as to both the 
initial capital cost and annual operation and 
maintenance (O&M) and fuel costs, with 
discount rates applied over the lifetime of the 
project. The latter does not include any ongoing 
annual costs.
A thorough comparison of unit energy 
generation costs, with an explanation of 
their derivation, is presented in a 2002 UK 
Government Cabinet Office report, The Energy 
Review28. These figures are reproduced in T able 
6.1. The report was compiled by a panel of 
government-appointed experts to inform a 
(then) imminent energy White Paper.
In its White Paper, the UK Government went 
on to prioritise the environment in setting 
goals for the energy sector. It set out a 
strong commitment to the long-term future 
of renewables and energy efficiency, in the context of wider benefits for the economy. On 
renewable energy, the White Paper concluded 
that ’technologies such as onshore and offshore 
wind and biomass are potentially – after energy 
efficiency and alongside Combined Heat and 
Power (CHP) – the most cost-effective ways of 
limiting carbon emissions in the longer term.’30
T able 6.2 opposite shows present-day IEA 
capital expenditure estimates for a range of 
technologies, as published in 200331. 
Both sets of cost estimates shown are based 
on conventional economics. It can be seen 
then that, even before externalities  and  
(in the case of the IEA estimates) fuel and 
operating costs, offshore wind power is 
comparable in cost to new coal plant and 
nuclear electricity generation. 
The inclusion of a confidence level in cost 
estimates for The Energy Review  is a factor 
which is not often explicitly stated, but is very 
important for decision-making. It is effectively 
stating that for those technologies of which we 
are confident and have extensive experience, 
costs are demonstrably achievable. T able 6.1 UK Performance and Innovation Unit cost estimates

Sea Wind Europe 37
Renewables are coming of age in a time 
of unprecedented economic scrutiny and 
competition. Onshore wind power has a 
proven track record of cost reductions: in 
the UK for instance, onshore wind minimum 
bid prices for the Government’s competitive 
support mechanism in England and Wales 
(the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation), dropped 
from 4.56p/kWh in 1994 to 2.43p/kWh in 
1998. The dramatic cost reductions achieved 
in onshore wind are largely the result of a 
design ethos which has responded to cost 
pressures, and the opportunity to achieve 
economies of scale. Offshore wind is similarly 
expected to achieve cost reductions, given 
the appropriate opportunities.  
6.2 Externalities
It is important to understand that simply 
continuing with the present electricity 
system will not result in falling or steady 
costs. In addition to environmental loss, environmental economists argue that a 
’business as usual’ approach could well result 
in higher total costs to society, compared to 
more sustainable alternatives. There are many 
reasons for this, including:
•  the ongoing need to replace and expand the 
conventional electricity supply system;
•  the growing insecurity of oil and gas 
supplies;
•  the burgeoning costs of coping with 
environmental degradation;
•  costs associated with a decline in human 
health;
•  costs associated with relying on energy 
supplies from non-domestic sources 
(sometimes referred to in terms of security 
of supply);T able 6.2 IEA World Energy Investment Outlook cost estimates

•  indirect costs such as subsidies, tax relief, 
R&D, policing and regulation, which are often 
not considered in quoted costs; and
•  the cost of carbon – including policy 
measures such as a carbon tax, litigation 
costs and insurance premiums.
With the exception of the first two, these 
additional costs are termed ’externalities’ 
and represent costs borne by society that do 
not form part of a conventional comparison 
between technologies. There have been a 
number of attempts to quantify energy-
related externalities, one of the best-known of 
which is the EC-funded ExternE project. The 
product of collaborative work between EU and 
US researchers, it attempts to translate into 
monetary terms the life-cycle impacts of a 
variety of technologies. 
ExternE results for the electricity sector in the 
EU 15 (excluding Luxembourg) plus Norway 
are summarised in T able 6.3, the range of 
values representing the lowest and highest 
country-specific results. The spread of values 
for each technology reflects differences in 
national circumstances and in the evaluation of 
externalities by each participating country33.
The context in which the ExternE results were 
generated is crucially important to understanding 
them – they take an academic approach to 
quantifying externalities which are not otherwise 
reflected in conventional pricing. For the most 
part they also only consider environmental 
effects, and do not include security of supply, 
public liability in the event of major accidents, or 
so-called ’legacy’ costs such as the treatment 
and storage of existing stockpiles of nuclear 
waste. There are also very wide-ranging and 
different types of uncertainty attached to each 
stage in the derivation of the final figures. 
There has been some debate over the external 
costs of nuclear power, with environmental 
groups arguing that it is a mistake not to include its legacy costs, or to assume that current 
decommissioning funds will prove to be sufficient.
The main conclusion is that renewables in 
general, and wind in particular, have negligible 
environmental externalities, whereas fossil 
fuels incur additional environmental costs. 
This demonstrates empirically that wind 
energy would be one of the cheapest forms 
of electricity generation if environmental 
externalities were internalised. While the study 
examined onshore wind, the net externalities 
of offshore wind are thought to be of a similar 
order of magnitude34. 
A key recommendation from ExternE was 
the recognition of external costs through 
either taxation or specific subsidy. This would 
reflect either the cost (taxation) or avoided 
cost (subsidy) of different types of energy 
generation. 
Development of the ExternE method continues.
6.3 Outlook on costs 
The European Green Paper Towards a European 
Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply  35 
states that ’we have to be aware that some 
renewables need significant investment, as 
was the case for that matter with other energy 
sources, such as coal, oil and nuclear energy.’ 
The UK’s Energy Review28 notes that ’support T able 6.3 Summarised ExternE results

for renewables will induce innovation and 
“learning”, bringing down the longer-term unit 
costs of the various technologies as volumes 
increase and experience is gained. In this 
way, today’s investment buys the option of 
a much cheaper technology tomorrow.’ The 
follow-on White Paper30 states that ’specific 
measures are needed to stimulate the growth 
in renewable energy that will allow it to achieve 
the economies of scale and maturity that will 
significantly reduce its costs.’ These statements 
show an acknowledgement that costs will be 
incurred in a move to renewables, and at the 
same time awareness that this should be seen 
in its full context. 
The policy response to these issues has been 
to introduce a variety of EU Member State and 
EC-level measures in support of renewable 
energies, including offshore wind. These include 
targeted market support mechanisms such as 
feed-in tariffs and tradeable green certificates 
implemented by Member States; and within 
the EU the Renewables Directive and, latterly, a 
proposed carbon trading regime.
A proposed Directive for an EU carbon trading 
regime has had its first reading in the European 
Parliament, and the Council of Europe adopted a 
common position on the proposal in December 
2002. The basic concept of the proposal 
is to allocate emission allowances against 
groups of greenhouse gas emitters, including 
thermal electricity generators, and require the 
subsequent submission of an allowance against 
any emissions. Because the total emission 
allowances will be capped in some way, a 
market for allowances will be created between 
companies, with those with lower abatement 
costs selling emissions to those with higher 
abatement costs.
The estimated price at which allowances will 
trade varies over quite a large range depending 
on the commentator. Until all Member States 
confirm their National Allocation Plans and until 
ancillary measures such as the Linking Directive are finalised the actual price of traded carbon 
is impossible to predict accurately. The EC 
itself refers to estimates of ¤26 or less than 
¤13 per tonne of CO2, depending on the effect 
of the Linking Directive and the limit (if any) 
put on the crediting in the EU trading scheme 
of carbon allowances that come from projects 
developed outside the EU36. By contrast, the UK 
regulator Ofgem refers to a much higher price 
estimate of as much as ¤49 per tonne of CO2. 
Case study  
Impact of emissions trading on UK 
electricity generation costs
The UK electricity regulator , Ofgem, estimated 
the impact of the European Emissions Trading 
Scheme on the UK electricity market based on 
one of the available estimates of prices at which 
carbon allowances will trade. Ofgem reported 
this at ¤33 to ¤49 per tonne of CO2. It found 
the implications for UK generators were an 
increase in cost of £19.40 to £28.80 per MWh 
(¤29.10 to ¤43.20 per MWh) for coal-fired 
generation and £8.10 to £12.00 per MWh (¤12.15 
to ¤18.00 per MWh) for gas-fired generation37. 
If realised, these additional costs for fossil fuel 
generators would have major implications for 
the generation mix, putting offshore wind and 
other renewables at a cost advantage.
There is ongoing debate on the details of the 
scheme, including the way in which initial 
allowances will be allocated, the volume of initial 
allowances, which greenhouse gases will be 
included and penalties for non-compliance. It is 
crucial details such as these that will determine 
if the scheme is effective in achieving long-term 
carbon reductions, and in encouraging zero 
carbon generation alternatives.  
Case study
The IPCC
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) was formed jointly by the 
World Meteorological Organisation and the 

40
United Nations Environment Programme as 
an expert body responsible for reviewing 
and assessing the science of human-induced 
climate change. 
The IPCC publishes periodic Assessment 
Reports which communicate to policy-makers 
and others the most up-to-date understanding 
on climate change and its impacts. The last 
one to be issued, the 2001 Third Assessment 
Report , consists of three volumes, one of 
which, ’Mitigation’ (shown in Figure 6.1), 
reviews the options available for reducing and 
limiting the emission of greenhouse gases. 
Commenting on the wider benefits of 
greenhouse gas reduction measures, the 
report states that ’Climate mitigation policies 
may promote sustainable development when 
they are consistent with ˇ broader societal 
objectives. Some mitigation actions may 
yield extensive benefits in areas outside of 
climate change: for example, they may reduce 
health problems; increase employment; 
reduce negative environmental impacts (like 
air pollution); protect and enhance forests, 
soils and watersheds; reduce those subsidies 
and taxes which enhance greenhouse gas 
emissions; and induce technological change 
and diffusion, contributing to wider goals of 
sustainable development.’ 38
At the February 2003 session of the IPCC, in 
Paris, the French Prime Minister J.P. Raffarin 
stated that ’the performance of the country 
must not be the only criterion for the GNP. 
We cannot base our development on the 
exhaustion of our fixed capital – our natural 
resources. We must take into account this 
essential factor, environmental capital, when 
we calculate national prosperity and, in this 
way, determine new indicators that will enable 
us to guide this new action. Creating 50 units 
of national prosperity is, I believe, naturally 
very important, but if that is to destroy 100 
equivalent units of environmental capital, 
then it is neither efficient nor acceptable. We cannot pass a degraded situation on to our 
children and grandchildren.’ 39
6.4 Conclusions
A comparison with conventional generation 
costs shows that onshore wind energy is 
already cost-competitive with new coal, IGCC 
and nuclear power, and can be cost-competitive 
with other conventional power sources. This is 
a testament to the cost reductions the onshore 
wind industry has achieved through economies 
of scale and technological development over 
the last decade. Furthermore, when carbon 
abatement is the primary goal, offshore wind 
energy is already seen as an attractive option.
As onshore wind has achieved cost reductions, 
so offshore wind, given the chance to achieve 
economies of scale, is expected to reduce its 
costs. When making decisions for the future, it 
is also important to appreciate the confidence 
in expectations of different technologies, 
and the UK’s Energy Review  concluded that 
offshore wind power costs could be predicted 
as confidently as those for future nuclear power 
and coal-fired generation. This was in the 
context of predicting that offshore wind could 
outcompete, in conventional terms, both coal 
and nuclear power by 2020.
The generation of electricity also generates 
costs that are not presently accounted for in 
the conventional cost of electricity, or indeed 
captured at all by our present accounting 
system. Crucially, when even a selection of 
these costs is attributed to different energy 
sources, wind and other renewables clearly 
incur the lowest total costs to society.
The inadequacies of our accounting and pricing 
system in properly incentivising wind power 
and other renewables is increasingly plain. This 
is why specific support for renewable energies 
is justified at the European and EU Member 
State levels. 
Clearly the ideal outcome is full internalisation 

Sea Wind Europe 41
of external costs, but there are inevitable 
difficulties in achieving such a perfect market, 
not least of which is the accurate assessment of 
external costs. There have been some positive 
developments in taking a pragmatic approach 
to internalising external costs, ranging from 
market support mechanisms to the impending 
European-wide carbon trading regime. 
Nonetheless, there is a long way to go properly 
to reflect the true costs of the alternatives and 
to put wind power on a level playing field with 
conventional technologies.
The need to take action early in order to achieve 
cost reductions up to 2020 is widely acknowledged 
by policy-makers, and although they represent 
a good start, there is not as yet a clear view on 
how offshore wind will benefit from anticipated 
market-based measures, or even if these measures will prove effective. As stated in Section 4.1, 
new tradeable certificate markets are still seen 
as relatively novel, and there is not yet enough 
confidence against which large-scale offshore wind 
projects can be developed, especially at the scale 
envisaged in Sea Wind Europe. 
There is a need to provide a clear view on 
how new market-based measures will lead 
to the development of real projects. It is also 
imperative that anticipated and new measures 
are introduced with urgency, if the benefits are 
to be realised within a 2020 timeframe. 
There are also significant gaps in the extent to 
which externalities are internalised, and work 
on progressing this should be continued and 
widened to ensure that the full range of social 
and environmental costs is included.

7. Electricity grid
An expansion in offshore wind energy of the 
scale considered here would inevitably require 
investment in the physical grid network, and 
an adoption of emerging and new practices 
for operating the overall system. These 
reinforcement and system issues are two distinct 
effects which are considered separately here.
7.1 Reinforcement and extension
Wholesale adoption of offshore wind energy 
will require new power lines and reinforcement 
of existing grid routes. This is in the context of 
ongoing development of the system to meet 
demand, generation and liberalisation (and 
hence electricity trade) trends.
The Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission 
of Electricity (UCTE) is concerned with 
ensuring transmission system security across 
20 continental European countries. Its annual 
’system adequacy forecast’ determines whether 
system development plans are adequate for 
the maintenance of system security. The latest 
(December 2002) forecast, for 2003–0540, 
takes into account plans for new generation 
plant and transmission lines.
For the UCTE region as a whole, forecast 
generating capacity increases from January 
2003 to July 2005 comprise for the most part 
fossil-fuel-based energy (largely CCGT) with 
an increase of 14.4GW, and renewable energy 
(principally wind) with an increase of 10.9GW. 
So clearly wind energy is set to be a major 
component of new power supplies already. 
A number of studies have attempted to identify 
system reinforcement and extension costs 
attributable to defined increases in renewable 
energy (for an example, see the British case 
study below). Inevitably, these costs will be 
higher than if existing power station locations 
are used for new power stations. 
Equally, there are safety reasons dictating 
the location of some power stations, and 
conventional fuels are increasingly imported 
from very distant locations. In an assessment of fuel supplies to 202041, the IEA states 
that ’The principal uncertainty in global 
energy supply prospects is cost. Advances 
in technology and productivity are driving 
production and transportation costs lower, 
but the depletion of the cheapest reserves 
and the growing distances over which new 
supplies must be transported are, in many 
cases, pushing delivered energy costs up.  
The cost of supplying natural gas to the main 
markets is starting to rise with the depletion 
of near-to-market reserves and the growing 
need to ship gas from further afield. On the 
other hand, renewable energy resources, 
which are usually exploited at a local or 
regional level, are generally becoming less 
costly to produce.’ 
Furthermore, offshore wind locations are 
often close to centres of demand. The maps 
presented in Section 3.4 show major centres of 
population in relation to possible offshore wind 
farm locations.
If offshore wind energy is to make significant 
inroads into European power supply, it makes 
sense to consider the development of the 
grid, onshore and offshore, in a strategic 
manner, rather than let the existing grid drive 
the locational development of offshore wind 
energy on a project-by-project basis. There is 
some evidence that this is already taking place, 
through national and European initiatives (see 
the TEN case study below), but the effects to 
date are marginal compared to what would be 
required efficiently to drive a massive increase 
in offshore wind energy.
There is a significant role for EU Member 
States to play an active part within their 
own jurisdictions to ensure that necessary 
extensions and upgrades to electricity networks 
are delivered to the benefit of wind power. 
Meanwhile the EC is in the unique position 
of being able to take an EU-wide view of 
the issues and ensure that strategic grid 
infrastructure is co-ordinated and realised in the 
context of plans for offshore wind power.  

Sea Wind Europe 43
Case study
The Trans-European Energy 
Networks (TEN) initiative
The EC provides financial support for 
electricity and gas infrastructure through 
the TEN programme. Since 1994, the EU 
has supported the construction of energy 
infrastructure to achieve social benefits, 
accelerate the development of the 
internal market and improve security of 
supply42,43. Priorities drawn up in 1996 for 
electricity infrastructure were to improve 
interconnections between member states and 
with other European countries, and to connect 
isolated networks.
Total community finance provided to 
electricity and gas networks between 1995 
and 1999 is shown in Table 7.144.
Of the TEN budget line figure, 38.1% was 
allocated to electricity, 6% of which was 
spent on connecting isolated networks, 25% 
on improving flows between member states, 
and 69% on connections with other European 
countries and the Mediterranean.
In 2001, the EC issued a proposal to amend 
the guidelines for funding the TENs. Two 
new policy priorities have been introduced, 
one concerned with market bottlenecks, 
the second with ’connecting renewable 
energy production to the interconnected 
network’. This new emphasis on renewable 
energy is carried throughout the proposed 
new guidelines, and reflected in a number 
of proposed new ’projects of common 
interest’. For instance, there are proposals for connections in the north-east and west 
of Spain ’in particular to connect to the 
network wind power generation capacities’, 
and to allocate funds to ’adapting the 
methods of forecasting and of operating 
electricity networks required by the 
functioning of the internal market and the 
use of a high percentage of renewable 
energy sources’ 45.
The integration of renewables into 
the mainstream infrastructure energy 
programme of the EC is a significant and 
necessary development. If carried out, it 
is measures such as this that will assist in 
transforming renewables from a niche to an 
everyday technology across Europe.
7.2 System issues
System issues is a general term that  
refers here to practices related to operating  
the grid network in order to maintain a 
continuous (within defined limits) and 
acceptable quality of supply. Wind energy  
is often cited as challenging in this respect, 
for two main reasons: it introduces  
variability additional to that of demand;  
and it does not provide ’ancillary services’ 
– technical generator capabilities which,  
when called upon, help to maintain power 
quality. Losses on the system are also 
discussed – depending on its location, a 
generating station can increase or decrease 
losses incurred in the distribution and 
transmission of electricity.
Table 7.2 provides a context for electricity 
system development in the EU 15. It shows 
predicted installed capacity and electricity 
demand from the EC’s European Union  
Energy Outlook to 2020, and installed  
capacity and generation in the scenarios 
postulated in Chapter 3.
This compares to energy penetration in  
the Danish Eltra46 system of approximately 
16% over a year, and capacity penetration  
of 30%. T able 7.1 Energy infrastructure financial support

Up to a certain penetration, wind energy does 
not generally pose any major issues for system 
operators. This is because: the variability on 
all timescales is insignificant compared to that 
of demand; wind capacity is small enough to 
be discounted in considering reserve margins; 
and services provided by other generators are 
sufficient to maintain power quality. The point 
at which system operation becomes difficult 
depends entirely on the system – its size, 
generation mix, demand distribution and so on. 
20% is often quoted as a benchmark. 
This is however highly dependent on the 
specific situation – isolated small systems may 
experience difficulties well before 20%. In Crete, 
for instance, wind energy output is starting 
to be curtailed at 10% penetration, although 
this figure is somewhat distorted by the highly 
seasonal use of electricity on the island. Some 
very small isolated wind-diesel systems such as 
that on the Isle of Muck in Scotland can easily 
experience very high penetrations (reportedly 
as high as 78%)47. 
There are no overriding technical reasons why 
wind energy could not achieve close to 100% 
penetration – it is economics that will determine 
the ultimate mix. As discussed, the particular 
challenges that are encountered are very 
dependent on the specific circumstances of the 
system, but there are comparisons which can be 
made between systems in terms of the types of 
challenges – be they related to power quality, 
energy balancing, curtailment or otherwise. 
The case study on Ireland details an investigation into the issues that the Irish grid 
can expect to encounter as penetration of wind 
energy increases, and the appropriate solutions. 
As well as purely technical solutions, some 
problems can be solved by changes in the rules 
that govern access to the grid (grid codes and 
other requirements). 
Even without wind energy, system operation is 
challenged by variable demand and generation. 
It has largely developed with an ethos of serving 
demand, with generation and the network 
contributing to stability. Different types of 
generation make different contributions 
– nuclear is inflexible baseload, hydro with 
storage is valuable for rapid responses, while 
coal plant can provide medium-term flexibility 
to cope with demand changes on a daily 
timescale. Systems with large, concentrated 
units are more susceptible to an ’event’ of loss 
of power, whereas a diverse system is inherently 
more reliable. The grid acts to transmit and 
distribute, but also to provide a robust system 
that can absorb the vagaries of all the different 
connectees, and of the grid itself. 
Increasingly, markets and economics influence 
the extent to which technologies contribute to 
the operation of the network, and demand is 
also starting to play a role in this. Wind energy 
is a relatively new technology, and so will by 
virtue of this fact alone necessitate changes in 
system operation. Its disadvantages at present 
relate to there being no output during low 
winds, the variability of its output, and the 
difficulty of predicting that output. 
As wind energy’s contribution increases, 
there is an ongoing process in which both 
the network and wind energy technology are 
moving towards meeting on middle ground. The 
network needs to alter its operating practices 
and plans the better to accommodate wind 
energy, while wind energy technology needs 
to adapt the better to meet the needs of an 
integrated network.
Examples of the former are network operators T able 7.2 EU 15 electricity system development predictions

moving over to more active management 
of their systems, or adopting new planning 
and security criteria that better reflect the 
characteristics of wind energy (rather than 
ignoring it altogether). The key example of 
the latter is ongoing development of turbine 
technology such that wind turbines more 
closely resemble conventional power plants in 
terms of services offered. This development 
is already being progressed through specifying 
wind turbine requirements in grid codes. GH 
has previously reviewed a number of proposed 
new grid code requirements for wind farms48, 
and concluded that most can be met for an 
insignificant effect on the cost of energy.
The use of forecasting tools is beginning to 
improve the predictability of wind energy 
output, and new storage applications for use in 
conjunction with wind power, or as part of the 
wider system, are beginning to appear on the 
market. In the short to medium term, storage 
for grid applications will probably be based on 
energy carriers such as conventional chemical 
storage. Hydrogen offers promise but further 
research is still required. 
Case study
Eltra
Eltra is the Danish transmission system 
operator (TSO) for Jutland and West 
Denmark, and probably experiences higher 
wind penetrations than any other major TSO 
in the world (an annual energy penetration 
of 16% in 2001, instantaneously in excess 
of 100% on occasion). Because of market 
conditions, Eltra has had little control over the 
wind power plant in its area, and has relied 
on interconnections to Norway, Sweden and 
Germany to manage production variability. 
Recently, though, and partly in response to 
the introduction of one large offshore wind 
power station at Horns Rev (as opposed to 
the relatively dispersed and small onshore 
wind farms), Eltra has started to ask wind 
farms to turn into ’Wind Energy Power Plants’. 
This effectively means that the output from 
turbines will be more actively managed and controlled, and will start to provide services to 
the TSO similar to some of those provided by 
conventional generation. 
Eltra has initiated various investigations to 
further this trend, and is also reviewing the 
feasibility of provision of a fuel cell storage 
facility. Commenting on the twin evolution of 
both turbine technology and TSO practices, 
Eltra says that ’the wind energy power plant 
and the demands on it are far from their 
final form. This will depend very much on the 
development – both regarding turbines and 
grid connection. ˇ The connection conditions 
will thus be revised at regular intervals.’ 
Eltra concludes: ‘Due to the large and increasing 
share of wind energy power plants, it has 
been necessary to create new concepts for 
the incorporation of wind energy in the 
electricity grid. Not only the size and production 
opportunities make it interesting to operate 
the new large offshore wind farms as “wind 
energy power plants”. Also new technology and 
innovation enable wind farms to considerably 
function [sic] as power plants meeting a major 
part of the control requirements made on 
traditional power plants.’ 49
Case study
Great Britain grid-related costs
As part of its programme of delivering increases 
in renewables penetration by 2020, the UK 
Government commissioned a study to investigate 
the additional network costs that penetration 
of up to 30% might incur for the British 
network. The so-called SCAR report (System 
Costs of Additional Renewables) estimated any 
additional costs associated with transmission 
reinforcement, transmission losses, distribution 
network reinforcement and management, and 
system balancing50. The study examined costs 
for different mixes of renewables generation 
for penetrations of 20% and 30% in 2020. Costs 
were estimated from a starting point of 10% 
renewables penetration in 2010, and as additional 
to an alternative baseline of all new capacity being 
met by conventional gas-fired generation.

46
Additional costs were estimated in the range 
£0.30–£0.90 per MWh for 20% penetration 
and £0.80–£2.20 per MWh for 30%. The 
lowest estimates corresponded to a mix of 
baseload renewables and close-to-market 
wind energy, with the highest costs incurred 
by large amounts of wind energy distant from 
centres of demand. For the lowest estimate for 
20% penetration, transmission reinforcement 
costs were actually lower than the baseline 
scenario, with balancing and capacity costs 
making up over 90% of the additional costs, 
and distribution costs the remainder. For the 
highest 20% estimate, balancing and capacity 
costs were still the dominant cost element at 
71%, with transmission reinforcement at 23% 
and distribution at 6%.
Building on the outcome of this and other work, 
a joint paper by the SCAR report authors, NGT51  
and an independent consultant, ’A shift to wind 
is not unfeasible’, looks at an all-wind 20% 
penetration, compared to a conventional gas 
generation scenario. 60% of the wind capacity is 
assumed to be transmission-connected offshore 
wind. The central estimate for additional costs 
of this 20% wind scenario is £3 per MWh, which 
corresponds to an approximate 5% increase on 
domestic prices. 
While inevitably further detailed investigation 
could refine these estimates up or down, 
depending on generation plant capital costs, 
gas prices and so on, the key message is that 
the general range of additional costs estimated 
is well within the realms of cost variances 
associated with other factors, such as VAT.  
 
Case study
Increasing penetration of wind 
energy in Ireland
The number of wind farms seeking connection 
to the electricity systems in the Republic of 
Ireland and Northern Ireland is increasing, 
and this trend is expected to continue. The 
anticipated levels of wind generation both 
onshore and offshore may well exceed, in percentage terms, the levels currently 
experienced in Eltra’s and other systems with 
high wind penetration. System operators are 
concerned about the potential effects on 
electricity systems, and wind farm developers 
are concerned that network restrictions will 
cause delays or add cost to new wind farms.
In response to these concerns, the electricity 
regulators for the two Ireland jurisdictions 
commissioned an independent assessment 
from GH, with ESBI and University College 
Cork, in order to establish the effects of 
increasing penetrations of wind energy, and 
propose appropriate action to overcome any 
adverse effects48.
The study found that there were two 
fundamental types of factor that limit the 
capacity of connected wind generation on 
the combined systems: transmission planning 
criteria, and curtailment of wind production 
due to the requirement to continue to run 
conventional generation. 
Transmission planning criteria determine the 
amount of generation which can be connected 
to the system and deliver its rated output 
without the transmission system’s operating 
limits (e.g. voltage levels, thermal loading 
limits, stability limits, etc.) being infringed 
in the presence of predefined abnormal 
situations (called contingencies) on the 
system. These contingencies vary in their 
severity and likelihood of occurrence. 
The report suggests that to limit wind power 
capacity in this way – i.e. to define its 
ability to connect with reference to unlikely 
occurrences – is unrealistically restrictive. It 
proposes instead that the maximum size of 
wind farm be that which can be connected to 
the intact system (i.e. with no contingencies), 
but that if, in the event of a contingency, 
the presence of wind generation causes any 
infringement of the preset operating limits, 
wind generation should be immediately and 
automatically disconnected.

Sea Wind Europe 47
Curtailment of production refers to the 
need to limit wind power output at certain 
times. As the output of wind generation is 
increased, the output of the conventional 
generation running at the time is reduced. 
Eventually the conventional generation 
will reach a limit below which its output 
cannot be reduced for technical reasons. 
When this limit is reached, the output 
of the wind generation must be reduced 
(’curtailed’) instead. This curtailment clearly 
has economic consequences. The report 
recommends that alternative operating 
strategies be studied in the near future, so 
that preferred strategies can be in place 
before wind penetration reaches a level 
where the economic penalties of wind 
energy curtailment are significant. 
In essence, the study found that while 
current practices are the product of 
a system supplied by conventional 
generation, there is significant scope 
for accommodating additional wind 
power capacity without the need for 
reinforcement or extension of the system. 
Adoption of new practices and criteria, and 
thinking ahead, can go a long way towards 
achieving cost-effective integration of 
wind power into electricity systems.
7.3 Conclusions
Wind power is a relatively new power source to 
connect to the network. In most networks at 
present it constitutes a very small fraction of 
total capacity or energy delivered. As such, it has 
not proved worthwhile to make any significant 
alterations to the way in which the network is 
planned, built, and operated. It has similarly not 
been seen as worthwhile to tailor wind power 
technology to the needs of the network.
Against this background, the default position 
has been to regard wind turbines as an adjunct to the electricity system as opposed 
to a part of it. As wind power’s contribution 
increases, this approach becomes neither 
sensible nor cost-effective. For this reason 
system operators, planners and turbine 
manufacturers are beginning to move towards 
a middle ground. There are signs that future 
development of electricity systems is, in part, 
taking into account the likely development 
of wind power. System operators are 
beginning to ask for wind turbines that can 
provide services to the system, and turbine 
manufacturers are responding to this. Some 
system operators are even looking at more 
active management of their networks the 
better to accommodate wind energy.
These developments are however ad hoc 
at present. There is no Europe-wide, co-
ordinated effort to ensure that networks, 
and turbine technology, are sufficiently and 
consistently able to accommodate the levels 
of penetration envisaged here. For example, 
GH has recommended to the Irish regulators 
that grid code requirements for wind farms 
should adhere to a harmonised European set 
of capabilities, while allowing jurisdictions 
to set limits specific to their system. This 
would mean that turbine manufacturers could 
develop capabilities for the European market, 
with the application of these capabilities 
determined by the grid codes. 
If networks are not to be an impediment to 
achieving the increases in offshore wind power 
envisaged in Sea Wind Europe , offshore wind 
and its expansion need to be fully integrated 
into mainstream grid planning. There is an 
important European-level role in ensuring 
consistency across EU Member States – which 
will be essential for delivering cost-effective 
and timely change – and also in providing 
for offshore wind in the Commission’s own 
objectives for grid development.

8. Socio-economic
8.1 Prospects
The technology section of this report gives 
an overview of the types of industry involved 
in the manufacture of turbines and other 
equipment and in offshore installation. For the 
most part, these are familiar industrial sectors 
such as steel fabrication, shipbuilding, offshore 
construction and composites. A growing 
offshore wind sector will support jobs in a 
wide variety of capacities, including disciplines 
such as project management, engineering, 
marine science and meteorology. Some will be 
local to offshore sites, some will be dispersed 
throughout the community. 
Turbine factory floor
A variety of studies have identified the jobs 
potential of a growing renewables sector. For 
Europe as a whole, an EC-funded study initiated 
by the European Forum for Renewable Energy 
Sources53 estimated jobs created as a result of 
increases in renewable energy to 2020. Carried 
out over 1998–99, the study predicted market 
penetration to 2020 of different renewable energy 
sources, and any displaced conventional generation, 
the results of which were usedto derive inputs 
for economic input-output modelling. Direct and 
indirect jobs were estimated from investment in 
technologies, also taking into account the effect of 
redirecting subsidies to renewable energy.T able 8.1 shows full-time equivalent (FTE) 
employment creation functions for each 
technology, derived by the study for 2010 
and 2020. Figures for generation technologies 
represent jobs created by the power stations 
alone, with the exception of biomass where 
agricultural sector fuel-related jobs are also 
listed. Jobs created are divided into construction 
and installation (C&I) and operation and 
maintenance (O&M) sectors. 
The study concluded that renewables 
are generally more labour-intensive than 
conventional technologies. The numbers 
in Table 8.1, multiplied up to derive jobs 
created from 720TWh/year of offshore 
wind energy, suggest a total of 1.6–3 
million jobs54 over the period until 2020 in 
construction and installation, and 158,400 
in operation and maintenance, which would 
reasonably be expected to be ongoing. Year 
on year the number of jobs in construction 
and installation would depend on the rate 
of installation in that year. The jobs can 
reasonably be expected to be long-term 
and stable while the rate of installation 
is maintained. After 2020, a reduction 
in installation rate could lead to reduced 
employment; however the likelihood of 
continuing long-term jobs is significantly 
increased by the expectation that turbines 
would begin to be refurbished and replaced 
from around 2025 onwards. By comparison 
jobs in operation and maintenance are long-
term and stable for so long as the wind farms 
continue to operate. 
The largest volume of jobs created will be in 
the manufacturing sector. Some of these jobs 
may naturally fall close to site (for instance 
where gravity foundations need to be towed 
a short distance to site), but some will reflect 
the attractiveness of a particular region to 
manufacturers, and the benefits to be gained 
from local manufacture. The case studies 
provide examples of benefits for a particular 
region, and of wind energy compensating for a 


Sea Wind Europe 49
decline in traditional manufacturing outlets.
Governments, development agencies, 
industrial groupings and others are increasingly 
targeting the renewables sector as a major 
business opportunity. It is especially apparent 
to traditional manufacturing sectors that 
the current decline in business could be 
reversed by orders from the renewables 
sector. The case study of the SKET factory in 
Magdeburg illustrates a type of diversification 
which is growing. German port authorities 
in the vicinity of planned offshore wind 
developments are launching major strategies 
aimed at attracting offshore wind energy-
related business.  
Case study
Spain
Installation of wind farms in Spain has seen a 
dramatic rise over the past few years. From 
some 46MW in 1995, installed wind power capacity reached 4,830MW by the end of 
2002, with just under 1,500MW installed in 
2002 alone. Regional targets suggest there 
will be at least 10GW installed by 2010. This 
volume of development has been encouraged 
by ambitious targets, supported by regional 
and national development policies and a 
premium price tariff. 
Spain has been very successful in capitalising 
on this growth through local manufacture. 
Spain’s biggest wind turbine manufacturer, 
and in 2002 the world’s fifth largest 
manufacturer by volume, is Gamesa Eolica. 
It began in 1994 as a joint venture company 
between Vestas and the Spanish aeronautics 
industry manufacturer Gamesa. The 
company is now 100% owned by Gamesa, 
has 12 factories and is pursuing an ongoing 
worldwide expansion. In 2001, wind energy 
accounted for 52% of Gamesa’s turnover, in 
the context of a growing turnover for the 
total business.T able 8.1 Employment creation functions

Other Spanish manufacturers include 
Ecotechnia, Made, Mtorres and EHN. Foreign 
manufacturers have also set up facilities in 
Spain, or make use of Spanish manufacturers. 
For instance, Nordex (German) manufactures 
towers at a steel works in Navarra, while the 
former NEG-Micon (Danish) has a plant at 
the TAIM factory in Zaragoza. Bonus (Danish), 
GEWE (American) and LM Glasfiber (Danish) 
also have substantial presences.  
Case study 
Greenpeace study –  
North-East jobs
A study for Greenpeace on the potential for 
offshore wind-related jobs in the North-East 
of England 55 concludes that the region could 
benefit substantially from manufacturing 
contracts. Total net UK jobs to be created from 
a 10% to 30% 2020 offshore wind contribution 
to demand were estimated at 24,215 to 75,655 
FTE respectively. Over 80% of these jobs 
would be in manufacture and installation, the 
remainder in operation and maintenance. 
It was estimated that approximately 57% 
of all offshore wind-related jobs would 
be in primary manufacturing, with 7% in 
manufacturing-related sectors such as 
extraction and processing. Of the remainder, 
11% would be in primary services and 
25% in secondary services. This spread of 
potential jobs provides a good fit for the 
North-East region which is characterised by 
’well-established capacity in manufacturing 
industry’ and a relatively high unemployment 
rate among the industrial workforce.  
Case study
Enercon at the SKET factory,  
Magdeburg, Germany
SKET and its predecessors have been 
involved in engineering manufacture in 
Magdeburg since 1855. Initially concerned 
with shipbuilding, the company’s activities 
diversified over the years into rolling-mill equipment, steel fabrication, lifting 
equipment, cement plant, edible oil extraction 
equipment and military products. By 1989, 
SKET was the region’s biggest company, 
employing 30,000 people in 18 factories. 
Massive job losses followed German 
reunification as the company’s Eastern 
European markets disappeared, and in 1996 
SKET filed for bankruptcy. 
In 1997, SKET’s engineering arm, its largest 
operation, was privatised and purchased 
by the German wind turbine manufacturer 
Enercon. Since then the Magdeburg factory 
has experienced a turnaround in prospects, 
with employment increasing again. Figure 8.1 
shows the SKET factory in Magdeburg.  
 
Figure 8.1 SKET factory
8.2 Conclusions
Offshore wind energy – from planning, designing 
and building the wind farms, to connecting 
them to the grid and maintaining them 
during operation – generates jobs. Per unit of 
investment, it has the potential to create more 
jobs than conventional power sectors, and these 
benefits will be realised to the full where the 
volume of development is sufficient to sustain an 
industry over the medium to long term.
Furthermore, because the manufacture of 
wind turbines, offshore support structures and 
other products utilises a number of established 
skills and facilities from the heavy engineering 


Sea Wind Europe 51
sector, wind energy can offer employment and 
revitalisation for communities suffering from 
a decline in traditional manufacturing. This 
has already been borne out in practice, and 
development agencies and business groupings 
are now starting actively to seek out wind 
energy business.
The Spanish case study demonstrates the 
value to the local economy of establishing 
a strong domestic market and encouraging 
local manufacture. Denmark is the most often 
quoted example of the twin advantages of 
creating a market and capitalising on jobs 
and export revenue. Denmark took early and decisive steps to promote a domestic market 
in wind energy, resulting in an industrial 
success story in which Danish wind turbine 
manufacturers have been at the head of the 
world market. 
This kind of industrial success is the direct 
product of a national commitment to an 
industry, and the foresight both to anticipate 
and benefit from a potential growth business. 
Economic benefits are realised through targeted 
policies – to generate a market, to support the 
skills base and to attract facilities. Otherwise, 
the benefits will flow to wherever such 
measures are implemented elsewhere.

9. Public acceptance
Naturally, in a democratic society, public 
acceptance is vital to the ultimate success of 
any initiative. The high-profile campaigns of 
the environmental movement are testament 
to this fact. Wind power does experience 
some public opposition, which, if truly 
representative, can be expected ultimately to 
halt its development. But actual experience 
and research suggest that the vast majority 
of people are supportive of wind energy. 
This section reviews some of the research 
into public attitudes, and some examples of 
engaging people in individual developments.
9.1 Public attitudes
The Eurobarometer survey quoted in Section 1.2 
clearly shows that the European general public 
is by and large environmentally conscious and 
supportive of technologies such as wind power. 
The real test of this sentiment is the public’s 
acceptance of projects, and almost all reviews 
show a majority in favour. 
For example, in July 2003 a review by the 
British Wind Energy Association (BWEA) 
of opinion polls in the UK between 1991 
(when the UK’s first wind farm became 
operational) and 2002 revealed an average 
of 77% of people supportive of wind power 
or a particular wind power project56 – a 
level of support sustained over the whole 
ten-year period. The polls reviewed included 
wind farm open day surveys, opposition 
group questionnaires and a government-
commissioned attitudes survey. Before and 
after surveys showed higher levels of support 
after the wind farms were constructed. A 
separate survey in 2003 of electricity bill 
payers found that 74% supported large 
increases in wind power in the UK.
These results agree with another review by 
the Danish Wind Turbine Manufacturers’ 
Association57, which indicates a similar theme 
of familiarity reducing the level of negative 
attitudes towards wind farms. It includes 
the results of polls in Denmark, Germany, 
the UK and Canada. For a relatively new, environmentally motivated technology, these 
findings are perhaps unsurprising. 
Provision of basic independent information 
on wind energy should facilitate sensible, as 
opposed to defensive, debate. In its offshore 
wind strategy, the German Government states its 
intention to initiate a public information campaign 
to accompany an offshore wind programme.  
If offshore wind is to become as commonplace 
as the 240GW aspiration here suggests, then 
perhaps the strong feelings at either end of 
the spectrum will be replaced with a core of 
indifference. There are already signs that a 
more mainstream attitude is being adopted 
by major utilities, with the likes of Shell and 
GE for instance advertising their wind energy 
credentials in commercials58. 
Case study
Schleswig-Holstein, Germany
Motivated by a desire to understand the 
impacts of wind farms on tourism in Schleswig-
Holstein, a collection of interested parties – 
including the Schleswig-Holstein Tourist Board, 
the Lübeck Chamber of Commerce, and the 
regional wind energy and energy foundation – 
commissioned a study to review data on visitor 
numbers and public attitudes59. At the time at 
which the study was undertaken, Schleswig-
Holstein had the second-largest number of 
onshore wind farms in Germany. At the same 
time it is one of the most important holiday 
destinations in the country, known in particular 
for its extensive sandy beaches. 
The study compared overnight stays at tourist 
resorts with different numbers of wind farms 
nearby, undertook questionnaires among the 
general German population and visitors to 
Schleswig-Holstein, and conducted some in-
depth group discussions.
The review of overnight stays showed no 
relationship to the number of nearby wind 
farms. That is, wind farms were having no 

Sea Wind Europe 53
negative effect on overnight visitor numbers 
at existing resorts. Taking these results with 
the outcome of the questionnaires and group 
discussions, the authors found that ’the results 
of the study conclusively show that the fear 
that the presence of wind farms would lead to 
perceptible damage to the tourist industry is 
not proven’60 and that ’even a further increase 
in wind power would not be rejected out-
of-hand by visitors. The majority of those 
questioned would in fact welcome it.’ 
Interestingly, the results of the group 
discussions in particular suggested that the 
views of the local population could be an 
important factor. The authors concluded 
that ’the attitude of the local population 
plays a role that cannot be underestimated. 
Committed protest against feared problems 
from wind farms could possibly lead to a self-
fulfilling prophecy about the negative impact 
of wind farms on the attitudes of visitors.  
 A bold and positive stance on wind power in 
holiday resorts, if complemented with tourist 
marketing of the attraction of a “wind park”, 
could possibly establish a competitive edge 
over other holiday resorts.’
9.2 Community involvement
Every wind farm will be required to seek some 
form of planning permission, and inherent in 
this process is affording the local community 
an opportunity to appraise and comment 
on a proposed development, or on a wider 
development plan for an area. Most developers 
will be proactive in promoting their project 
through open days, information leaflets and 
websites. A community fund will also usually be 
set up should the wind farm be realised.
Outside this normal practice, other forms of 
community involvement seen in Europe include:
•  financial share offerings relating to a project 
or portfolio;
•  tax or other financial incentives to invest in 
wind energy;•  community promotion of a project; and
•  co-operatively-owned wind farms and wind 
energy companies.
Much of the quoted evidence for the benefits 
of community participation comes from 
Denmark, where tax rules promoted private 
investments in turbines, and where co-
operatives and municipally-owned utilities 
are commonplace. A 1997 survey in a Danish 
municipality where over 90% of local supply 
came from wind energy57 concluded that 
those with an investment in a turbine were 
more likely to be supportive of wind energy. 
It is unsurprising that where an individual has 
taken the decision to invest, he or she will 
be supportive. There is however no analysis 
which shows whether this results in an overall 
improvement in approval ratings. Naturally, 
an investment opportunity is welcome, but 
not everyone will be able to, or want to, use 
their own money in this way. At any event, 
opportunities for individuals to invest in wind 
energy and other environmental technologies 
are likely to grow over the next decade, as they 
move into the mainstream.  
So there are a number of means by which 
communities are enfranchised. Wind energy 
differs from other forms of power generation 
in its vast range of scales, from single domestic 
turbines to commercial-scale offshore wind 
farms. However, simply because of the scale 
of offshore wind developments and the 
consequent levels of investment required, some 
of the smaller-scale examples of community 
involvement in onshore wind power will not be 
replicated offshore.  
Case study
Co-operative finance
The Middelgrunden offshore wind farm, off 
Copenhagen, is widely cited as an example of 
community ownership. It is part-owned by a 
co-operative, members of which are mostly 
local to the Copenhagen area. It is especially 

54
interesting to explore the circumstances 
under which a co-operative with no financial 
resources funded the construction of its half 
share of the wind farm.
Middelgrunden consists of twenty 2MW 
turbines, and became operational in 2001. 
Ownership is 50/50 between the wind 
farm co-operative (set up expressly for the 
purpose) and the local electricity utility, 
Copenhagen Energy (which is owned by the 
Municipality of Copenhagen). Ownership 
terms, negotiated over two years, are set out 
in a contract between the two parties, which 
allocates ten specific turbines to each party. 
A grant of ¤680,000 from the Danish 
Energy Agency, and ¤67,000 from sale of 
share reservations, funded initial feasibility 
investigations for the wind farm, and the 
organisation of the co-operative itself. 
Construction finance was raised through sale 
of shares. The co-operative sought credit for 
potential shareholders, but was unsuccessful 
in securing the necessary finance from 
major institutions. Offshore wind was simply 
not a priority area for the banks, or they 
were discouraged by the administration of 
numerous individual loans. 
Offers were, however, accepted from two 
smaller banks specialising in shareholder 
finance – Ringkjobing Bank and Faelleskassen 
Bank. Loans were at 7.4–7.45% over 10–15 
years, secured against the wind farm. Co-
operatives are common in Denmark and 
finance for shareholders is not unusual – in 
this case it was probably the nature and size of 
the development which presented a challenge. 
In the event, under 5% of shareholders availed 
themselves of these loan facilities.
The budget cost for the whole wind farm 
was ¤46 million, the actual cost ¤48 million 
(the increase being due to higher than 
expected foundation costs). The co-operative 
was therefore responsible for financing its ¤24 million share. Each member of the co-
operative is jointly and severally liable, but 
the risks are reduced through insurance. Until 
1999, only those in the municipality could 
purchase Middelgrunden shares, but they are 
now open to anybody, with certain conditions. 
The majority of shareholders reside within the 
Copenhagen area. (Information from61 and62).
9.3 Conclusions
Public acceptance is imperative for any 
industry, and offshore wind energy is no 
exception. Public attitude surveys consistently 
show majority support for wind energy. 
However, its novelty value contributes to some 
misconceptions. The fact that before and after 
surveys show improved approval ratings after 
a wind farm has been established suggests that 
direct experience is valuable in allaying any 
such misconceptions. 
Wind energy’s green credentials probably 
play a part in some of the actively positive 
reactions it invokes. However, some evidence 
shows that ’prompting’ can turn an otherwise 
indifferent attitude to a negative one. This 
suggests that the provision of impartial 
information on offshore wind energy, at the 
outset, could be very helpful in engendering 
support and in allaying fears.
Mechanisms that, one way or another, allow an 
enhanced level of community involvement in a 
project can engender support. Specifically, the 
opportunity to take a financial stake in projects 
is becoming increasingly common. Insofar 
as this provides choice and opportunity, it is 
welcome, but there is no evidence to suggest 
that it should be a prerequisite for a successful 
project. The planning process, and established 
practice, both provide for public involvement in 
projects, increasingly so as practice develops.
There is an ongoing role for governments 
and the EC to monitor public acceptance, 
ensure and promote good practice and 
provide impartial information and advice to all 
interested parties.  

Sea Wind Europe 55
This report has assessed Greenpeace’s question 
as to whether 30% of current EU demand, around 
720TWh/year, could be met through offshore 
wind generation by 2020, and what steps would 
be necessary for this to happen. This aspiration, 
translating into 240GW of installed offshore wind 
capacity, presents a challenge, but one that should 
be surmountable, and be seen in the context of 
the challenges that would be posed by pursuing a 
business-as-usual strategy.
The report has systematically considered some 
of the key barriers which, if not addressed, 
would certainly stand in the way of achieving 
this aspiration. There is a clear set of actions in a 
number of key areas, such as finance, ongoing R&D, 
electricity grid development, strategic planning and 
wind energy market development and stability, that 
policy-makers and other stakeholders at EU and 
Member State level must address for very large-scale offshore wind to succeed.
10.1 Actions
T able 10.1 lists objectives taken from each chapter 
of the report, which are supplemented by actions 
and suggestions for implementation. These actions 
are derived from research conducted for the report. 
There will inevitably be additional useful actions 
that are not identified here – it is not an exhaustive 
list, but it does reflect what should usefully be 
initiated, at the earliest juncture, to prepare for any 
ambitious programme of offshore wind energy. 
It is essential that there be implementation  
across the board. Any one barrier could  
compromise the achievement of targets.  
This suggests the need for cross-departmental 
co-ordination, giving an agency or an individual 
responsibility for delivering the overall plan for  
each Member State, and for the EU.10.

10.2 Conclusions
The offshore wind vision presented here is 
deliberately bold. It identifies at this early stage 
the necessary steps that need to be taken. It 
shows what could be possible for a renewable 
energy technology, given the right kind of 
support across the board. It also stresses that 
actions need to be addressed now if a 2020 
timescale is to be met. 
Offshore wind utilises existing, mainstream 
skills and materials in the processes of its 
development and to deal with the challenges 
that this development may present. The novelty 
is in how these skills and materials are used. The 
technical and industrial know-how for a massive 
expansion of offshore wind energy is already 
largely in place. The challenges that remain should 
be surmountable. They are almost certainly no 
greater than the challenges presented by the 
alternative of continuing on a ’business as usual’ 
path for Europe’s electricity system.  
The remaining barriers to success on the 
scale described in  Sea Wind Europe  are 
procedural as well as technical. Political 
support, backed up by the confidence to 
take early action, is crucial. Investment and 
commitment are required to effect a modal 
shift to renewables. There is a growing 
recognition that the benefits to society of 
making this shift will more than justify such a 
course of action.
In conclusion, providing that all barriers are 
dealt with and that action is taken in the areas 
specified, the level of development described 
in Sea Wind Europe  could be possible and the 
far-reaching potential benefits, both social 
and environmental, be within reach. This vision 
of what could be possible should provide 
inspiration for promotion of all the renewable 
technologies which will be required for a diverse 
sustainable energy future.

Sea Wind Europe 61
Methodology of Sea Wind 
Europe deployment scenarios
GIS is employed in this study to gain an 
appreciation of the scale of development 
implied, through the use of maps as opposed 
to any more sophisticated attempt to 
estimate the total resource. Scenario-based 
maps illustrating a build-up to 240GW 
installed capacity are shown in Section 3.4 of 
the report. The process by which these maps 
were developed is explained in detail here.
A wind speed GIS layer was derived primarily 
from the 1995 GH/Germanischer Lloyd 
EC study13. Assuming a medium-range 
deployment density63 of 8MW/km2 and a 
power curve from a typical modern offshore 
wind turbine, an annual energy yield (AEY) 
was derived for each GIS grid square. 
Sea depth and distance to shore are key 
economic and technical factors which impact 
upon a project’s economic and technical 
feasibility, and these were taken from 
a world-wide digital dataset64 and from 
computation in the GIS respectively. 
It is also instructive to examine the extent to 
which various planning and other constraints 
affect the quantifiable resource. Table A1 
very briefly summarises typical constraints 
to offshore wind development, with an 
explanation of the way in which each might 
limit development potential. There is a wealth 
of information on these issues, which have 
been covered much more extensively in other 
studies. An EC-funded action – Concerted 
Action on Offshore Deployment, (COD) – is 
also in the process of gathering sources of 
information on offshore wind development 
considerations in a central database 65.
It is noted that, when investigating a 
potential site, developers must consider in 
detail a wide range of constraints, including 
but not limited to those listed in Table A1. 
Potential impacts, and their magnitude, are 
subject to in-depth assessment in both the Strategic Environmental Assessment and the 
Environmental Impact Assessment processes. 
The former is an assessment which is carried 
out on government plans and policies prior 
to their implementation, the latter an impact 
assessment carried out by the developer in 
support of an application for project consent.
Despite an extensive search, no suitable 
EU-wide GIS datasets were sourced for the 
constraints listed in Table A1. GH does hold 
some constraint datasets digitised from sea 
charts in the previously mentioned 1995 
study. However, a check against the most 
recent UK Hydrographic Office Admiralty 
Charts confirmed that these datasets were 
now somewhat out of date. 
As a starting point, the 1995 datasets were 
used to exclude areas from development. The 
area excluded was largely determined by the 
resolution of the GIS – a kilometre square. 
For traffic zones, oil and gas platforms, 
pipelines and cables, any kilometre square 
in which their presence was recorded was 
excluded. For traffic zones, a 1 kilometre 
square buffer zone was also excluded.
Taking these exclusions, and within bounding 
assumptions for scenarios to 2010, 2015 
and 2020, wind farms were placed, from 
judgement, offshore of coastal EU 15 
countries. This judgement included a 
checking by eye against Admiralty Charts 
for any obvious constraints, knowledge of 
existing and planned offshore wind farm 
locations, and feedback from Greenpeace 
offices throughout Europe. Wind farms 
were placed until the desired energy output 
for each scenario year was achieved. 
This is a purely indicative approach, but 
was considered sufficient for the present 
purpose, which was simply to show 
development scale. 
There is no suggestion at all that the 
resulting locations are where wind farms 
should, or could, locate.Appendix

T able A1 Typical constraints to offshore wind development
Constraint Description
Platforms, pipelines and cables  Seabed works should avoid the immediate vicinity of 
underwater pipelines and cables. There are no uniform 
guidelines on avoidance distances. The International Cable 
Protection Committee 66 recommends 1 km distance between 
any seismic survey and an active cable.  
Environmental protected areas There is not always a presumption of complete avoidance,  
Visibility of wind farms and but it is important to ensure the designated interests are not   
landscape/ seascape  adversely affected. The fact that a wind farm is visible from 
’sensitive’ locations, and its effect on the surrounding landscape 
or seascape, can be constraints on its location. There are 
instances where a minimum distance from shore has been 
specified for offshore wind farms, to avoid potential conflict on 
visibility and landscape/seascape grounds.
Military interests  These include practice areas, telecommunications and radar 
equipment. For practice areas, the extent for co-existence is 
yet to be fully tested but there are precedents in the oil and gas 
industries. Impacts of wind farms on telecommunications and 
radar are subject to site-specific technical assessments.
Civil aviation interests  These include airport approaches and take-off paths, defined 
routes, telecommunications, and radar and navigational 
equipment. It is usually necessary to avoid certain areas in the 
vicinity of airfields. For equipment, as with military equipment, 
impacts are usually determined through site-specific 
assessments.
Shipping lanes  There is a variety of shipping routes, some of which are agreed 
through the International Maritime Organisation, and within 
them obstructions would cause a hazard. 
Commercial fishing  Offshore wind farms can reduce the area available for fishing by 
virtue of their presence and any exclusion zones around them. 
It is also important to ensure construction activities do not 
have an adverse impact on spawning. There may however be a 
positive impact through the structures acting as artificial reefs 
and havens from fishing effort (contributing to recovery of 
stocks). 
Communications  Microwave and other communication links for commercial 
providers, emergency services and other bodies need to be 
considered.
Aggregate extraction  There is a need to avoid extraction areas while still active, but 
once abandoned they could form ’brownfield’ development 
sites.
Dumping  Generally, sites where hazardous substances have been dumped 
should be avoided.

Sea Wind Europe 63
Assuming approximately the growth pattern 
of offshore wind postulated in Section 2.2, and 
shown below in Figure A1, three sequential 
scenarios were considered. These were as follows: 
2010:  In addition to the considerations 
described above, wind farms were limited to 
areas within a band 5–30km from shore, and 
within 30m depth. The 5km boundary was to 
reflect a general move by some countries to 
impose a coastal buffer zone for very large 
offshore wind farms on visual grounds. The 
30km from shore and 30m depth constraints 
reflect a combination of anticipated technical 
and cost-related limitations to 2010. On 
technical grounds, wind farms were placed to 
avoid locations that experience particularly 
extreme weather conditions. 
2015: As offshore wind farms move into more 
challenging environments, they might first 
be expected to move further offshore and 
to slightly deeper locations, in relatively less 
exposed areas (rather than shallow but exposed 
locations closer to shore). For this intermediate 
scenario, additional area was therefore released 
by relaxing the depth limitation to 50m and the distance limitation to 5–40km. 
2020: By 2020, it is considered that exposed 
locations may become cost-effective, and 
hence they are now released for development, 
as well as areas outside the 40 km from shore 
constraint, and depths of up to 100m. Even if 
technology allows, deeper, more exposed and 
further offshore locations are still likely to be 
more expensive, and thus a site which combines 
all three – deep, far off, and exposed – is not 
represented in this scenario.

20 Composite figures and 
commentary compiled by Chris 
Hornzee-Jones, consulting engineer, 
supplemented by insight from Adrian 
Williams of SP Systems.21 For simplicity, it is assumed that 
each blade has the same stiffness. In 
reality, the all-GRP blade may have a 
reduced stiffness and hence reduced 
mass.
22 End-grain balsa assumed as the 
core material. It might also be PVC 
or other foam in which case the 
mass of the core would be around 
1/3 less.
23  SP Systems and Hexcel are the 
dominant suppliers of pre-pregs 
into blades in Europe at present. 
There are many other suppliers 
of non-pre-preg materials i.e. dry 
fabric and separate resin systems 
for hand laminating or infusion. 
Thus SP Systems and Hexcel do 
not represent the total current size 
of the blade materials market. The 
current state of the art indicates 
that neither hand layup nor infusion 
is going to be practical for carbon 
fibre. Therefore either pre-preg or 
another mechanised process such 
as pultruded reinforcing bars are 
likely to be used for future carbon 
blades. So a scenario using carbon 
in offshore blades would indicate 
a large growth in this part of the 
market. Of course, this depends on 
the carbon fibre itself being available 
in sufficient quantities – this is the 
real issue.
