Executive Summary

US seafood company Bumble Bee, one of the
leading companies in the canned tuna market with
nearly 90% consumer awareness levels,1 and its
Taiwanese parent company Fong Chun Formosa
Fishery Company (hereinafter referred to as FCF),
one of the top three global tuna traders, play an
important role in the global tuna industry, and thus
hold responsibility over the health of our ocean, the
treatment of those working in the tuna supply chain
and consumer choices. Both companies have policies
on sustainability and corporate social responsibility
that are supposed to extend through their supply
chain, but according to the analysis in this report,
neither are meeting their responsibilities.

This report ﬁnds that the information on Bumble
Bee’s “Trace My Catch” website, which enables
consumers to track the source of their tuna product
from catch to can, is insufﬁcient and in some cases

incorrect. In a number of cases Greenpeace East Asia's
analysis found that the company was sourcing ﬁsh
from vessels that had engaged in or were suspected
of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) ﬁshing,
forced labor, and/or human rights abuses. Therefore,
Bumble Bee may not be fulﬁlling its responsibility
and commitment to environmental sustainability and
human rights, and without consumers’ knowledge
seafood tainted with IUU and forced labor may have
already entered the US market.

Based on 732 valid Bumble Bee tuna product codes,
this report ﬁnds that Bumble Bee tuna was sourced
from 290 different vessels, almost half of which are
Taiwanese-ﬂagged (119) or owned (22) distant water
ﬁshing vessels according to the information on Trace
My Catch. In addition, some information on their Trace
My Catch website contradicts ofﬁcial information from
the Taiwan Fisheries Agency about where the supply

vessel was authorized to ﬁsh. Verifying the vessel's
location against a third data source- Automatic
Identiﬁcation System (AIS) data from Global Fishing
Watch, revealed that 28 ﬁshing vessels’ ﬁshing area
information provided by Bumble Bee’s traceability
tool was incorrect. In addition, 13 ﬁshing vessels that
supplied tuna to Bumble Bee were listed on TFA’s
website for IUU ﬁshing.

vessel captain, ﬁrst mate, and seven others for their
involvement for forced labor and human trafﬁcking.
Bumble Bee's Trace My Catch website lists the source
of this tuna as DA WANG on a trip in 2019, during
which a ﬁsher was reportedly beaten and died at sea.
This leads to strong inference that seafood tainted
with forced labor has already been sold in the US
market.

Based on interviews with nine ﬁshers on six Taiwanese
vessels that supplied Bumble Bee, it was found that
all nine ﬁshers had experienced or observed at least
one of the International Labor Organization (ILO)
indicators of forced labor,3 and six out of those nine
ﬁshers had experienced or observed four or more
of the 11 indicators. All of the ﬁshers interviewed
said they have experienced excessive overtime and
retention of identity documents, and over two-thirds
of them had their wages withheld.

Greenpeace East Asia research found that Bumble
Bee canned tuna collected from Harris Teeter (a
wholly owned subsidiary of Kroger Co.) in Arlington,
Virginia on April 12, 2022 was sourced from DA
WANG, a Taiwanese-owned vessel conﬁrmed to use
forced labor by US Customs and Border Protection.4
In April 2022, Taiwanese authorities indicted the

On another Taiwanese ﬁshing vessel, DE CHAN NO.116
evidence was revealed from Greenpeace East Asia
interviews with ﬁshers as well as Global Fishing Watch
AIS data of suspected IUU ﬁshing, including alleged
shark ﬁnning and illegal transshipment at sea. The
alleged illegal activities took place during a period
when the ship was supplying tuna to Bumble Bee
according to Trace My Catch.

Greenpeace East Asia urges immediate action from
Bumble Bee and FCF, including issuing an apology
to the exploited ﬁshers, retailers and consumers,
removing products suspected of IUU and forced
labor-tainted tuna from the market, disclosure of
their supplying vessels list, and establishment of an
independent investigation committee for the ﬂaw
of Trace My Catch, to address issues of sustainability,
legality and forced labor in their supply chain.

Introduction

The ocean is vital to life-97% of all the water on Earth,
and 99% of the habitable space on this planet, is in the
ocean.5 Not only does it provide food and economic
beneﬁts to humans, it also functions ecologically
for carbon sequestration and oxygen production.
However, our ocean is facing a myriad of threats: from
climate change, ocean warming and acidiﬁcation to
plastic pollution and overﬁshing, the destruction and
plunder of our ocean and its marine life continues.
More than three billion people around the world
depend on the ocean for their livelihoods, but since
the 1990s, global ﬁsh catches have steadily declined,6
and more than one-third of ﬁsh stocks are now
overﬁshed.7 When a stock is considered overﬁshed,
it is exploited beyond an explicit limit set to ensure
safe reproduction,8 which puts ﬁsh populations and
ecosystems at risk.

Research has revealed that decreasing ﬁsh stocks are
the driving force behind forced labor in the industry.
A report from the United States National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) identiﬁed
“dependency on distant water ﬁsheries” as one of the
factors that increases the vulnerability of the ﬁshing
sector to human trafﬁcking, including forced labor.9
Due to the depletion of ﬁsh stocks, vessels venture
further out to sea to access proﬁtable ﬁshing grounds,
and these distant water ﬁshing vessels inherently
isolate workers and provide very limited means to
escape or report abuses. In addition, reports and
studies revealing forced labor in the ﬁshing industry
have been prevalent in recent years.10,11,12,13

The depletion of ﬁsh populations inevitably impacts
the livelihoods of ﬁshers, including migrant ﬁshers
working on distant water ﬁshing vessels; and
ultimately impacts consumer markets around the
world.

The journey of a tuna can is usually long - from ﬁshing
at sea to processing on land and then ﬁnally to the
market for sale - but that should not stop a diligent
company from transparency. Without transparent
and traceable information, it is hard for consumers to
know whether the canned tuna on the shelf of their
local supermarket is sustainable or not, whether the
ﬁshing vessel that caught it was involved in illegal
ﬁshing, or if the workers on board that ship were
treated well and fairly, and if a can of tuna can’t be
clearly traced back through the factory where it was

processed to the ship where it was caught, it is all
but impossible for consumers to help prevent the
depletion of our ocean and support safe and fair
working conditions in the seafood industry.

Fortunately, such problems are gradually gaining
attention internationally. To achieve supply chain
transparency, a company must know what is
happening throughout its supply chain, and must
communicate this information both internally and
externally. Harvard Business Review reports that
one of the main reasons that businesses are paying
attention to the concept of supply chain transparency
is due to demand from their consumers.14 A study by
the MIT Sloan School of Management also supports
this statement, pointing out that consumers are
willing to spend 2% to 10% more on products from
companies with better supply chain transparency.15

disclose their efforts to eliminate slavery and human
trafﬁcking from their supply chains. In the US, the
Tariff Act22 prohibits the importation of products
produced by forced labor or child labor.

Greenpeace East Asia believes that the problems of
overﬁshing, IUU ﬁshing and forced labor at sea are
inextricably linked, and to overcome them we must
tackle all three. Given the choice, most people would
choose to avoid seafood that came from overﬁshed
stocks, was caught illegally, or was caught by enslaved
or abused ﬁshers - but without adequate information,
they are powerless to make this choice. However, if
the seafood supply chain is made more transparent
and information is comprehensive, correct and
readily available, then seafood brands, retailers and
consumers can play an active role and work together
to make ﬁsheries sustainable, legal, and fair.

This report examines the supply chain of Taiwanese
seafood trader FCF and Bumble Bee, a US canned
tuna brand acquired by FCF in 2020. As one of the
top three global tuna traders in the world, and with
Taiwan being one of the world's biggest ﬁshing
entities, FCF and Bumble Bee have signiﬁcant global
impact in the seafood industry. Greenpeace East
Asia's investigations revealed suspected IUU ﬁshing
and forced labor cases in the company’s tuna supply
chain. With opaque information and insufﬁcient
monitoring of its supply chain, seafood products
lacking traceability- and potentially tainted with
illegal activities - can enter the US market.

Traceability throughout the supply chain is one of
the premises of transparency. To achieve traceability,
companies must understand the complete path of
their products from raw materials to the ﬁnal product.
Seafood traceability is supported by consumers.
A 2022 poll shows that almost three-quarters of
Americans support traceability, or the ability to track
seafood through the supply chain.16 At present, the
world’s major ﬁshery import markets, the European
Union (EU), the United States (US), and Japan have
established legal regulations for the traceability of
ﬁsh catches, aiming to improve the management
and traceability of global catches and combat illegal,
unreported and unregulated (IUU) ﬁshing through
market forces. The EU took the lead by implementing
the Catch Certiﬁcation System (CCS) in 2010, requiring
all imported ﬁsh to have a catch certiﬁcate improving
traceability.17 The US launched the Seafood Import
Monitoring Program (SIMP) in 2016 and revised it in
2018 to manage the import of 13 species groups.18
Japan passed the Act on Ensuring the Proper
Domestic Distribution and Importation of Specified
Aquatic Animals and Plants (

����動�物�の国内
), which requires a catch

��の�正��に�する�律
certiﬁcate for ﬁsh that are at risk of IUU.19

In addition, governments around the world have
begun to implement legal solutions to address forced
labor in supply chains. For example, a Modern Slavery
Act was passed in the United Kingdom (in 2015)20 and
Australia (in 2018)21, requiring qualiﬁed companies to

Methodology

The ﬁndings of this report are based on two research methods: supply chain research and interviews with migrant
ﬁshing crew.

To investigate Bumble Bee’s supply chain, Greenpeace East Asia obtained information from the Trace My Catch
system23  through the code provided on Bumble Bee canned products, in order to further verify whether there were
IUU or forced labor cases on ﬁshing vessels that are either Taiwanese ﬂagged or Taiwanese owned but operating
under foreign ﬂags. It is noted that all the codes are collected from retailers (e.g. stores and supermarkets) in the US.

Greenpeace East Asia also interviewed migrant ﬁshers who had worked on relevant Taiwanese-ﬂagged or -owned
ﬁshing vessels from 2019 to 2021,24 and cross-checked their statements and related documents, including their
contracts, against the International Labor Organization (ILO) forced labor indicators25 (According to ILO, an United
Nation agency that sets labor standards and promotes workers’ rights, the indicators represent the most common
signs or “clues” that point to the possible existence of a forced labor case. See the deﬁnitions and examples in
Appendix IX) and related Taiwanese ﬁshery and labor regulations to identify possible violations. All personally
identiﬁable information of the ﬁshers has been redacted for protection, and the ﬁshers’ statements from the
interviews, their codes, and the corresponding working ﬁshing vessels’ names are in Appendix I.

In addition,  Greenpeace East Asia used automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS) data26 from the ﬁshing vessels to verify
the working hours the ﬁshers claimed, and cross-checked this data against the operation of the vessel to ﬁnd out if
labor laws may have been violated, as well as to investigate possible illegal or unauthorized transshipments (transfer
of ﬁsh from one ﬁshing vessel to another) that ﬁshers claimed had occurred.

FCF’s influence from fishing vessels to plates

Bumble Bee was the largest canned tuna brand
in the US30 before its acquisition by FCF in 2020.
Though mainly sold in the US, it is also available in
Canada. Other brand names include Clover Leaf,
Snow's Beach Cliff, Brunswick, and Anova. The
headquarters of FCF are located in Kaohsiung City,
Taiwan, and FCF is one of the top three tuna traders
in the world.31 FCF doesn’t own any ﬁshing vessels;
instead, it purchases ﬁsh from ﬁshing vessels. In
addition to ﬁsh trading, FCF’s services for its clients
(i.e. ﬁshing companies) also include: providing
ﬁnances for vessel purchase or construction;
obtaining licenses, quota and crew; supplying fuel,
bait and provisions; and arranging transshipments.
The catch traded by FCF is transported to factories
for processing into ﬁsh ﬁlets or canned tuna as the
ﬁnal product. FCF may play a role in all of these
various phases including transportation, trading,
and customs clearance.

The US, EU and Japan are the main markets for
FCF; despite its base, Taiwan has never been the
company’s main market. After the acquisition of
Bumble Bee in 2020, FCF has integrated most
phases in the supply chain and started working
more closely with the US market. By 2020, FCF

has been ranked the 9th largest seafood company
globally, up from 15th in 2019. The company’s annual
turnover was reportedly up to USD 2.6 billion in
2020,32 which is three times higher than the annual
production value of Taiwan's distant water ﬁsheries
of USD 863 million in 2019.33

Over recent years, environmental awareness among
seafood consumers has increased. To improve
competitiveness, seafood companies have been
paying more attention to product traceability. In
2015, Bumble Bee launched an online product
traceability tool called Trace My Catch, where
consumers can enter the code from a Bumble Bee
tuna product to get partial information on the
origin and supply chain of the tuna it contains.34
However, despite offering a degree of transparency,
the product information on the website is limited,
and it depends on the accuracy of the information
provided by FCF and its trading partners. If the
company deliberately conceals or fails to investigate
issues in its supply chain, consumers may still
unknowingly purchase products resulting from
illegal and unethical behaviors, with the appearance
of traceability.

Obscure and misleading information from Bumble Bee

In early 2022, Greenpeace East Asia and Greenpeace
USA collected information from hundreds of Bumble
Bee tuna cans from supermarkets in the US. After
deducting cans that shared the same code, 76 different
codes from various tuna cans were obtained. These
codes were then entered into the Trace My Catch
system on Bumble Bee's ofﬁcial website to access and
record the supply chain information provided, giving
information on 452 individual ﬁshing trips,35 while three
codes were found to be invalid. In total, there were 290
ﬁshing vessels that supplied tuna, including albacore
and skipjack, to Bumble Bee.

whether the vessel was authorized to ﬁsh in that
area.

● Second, we checked if the ﬁshing vessel appeared
to be involved in unauthorized ﬁshing activities
through examining its AIS data and cross-checking
its authorized area and period.

● Third, we researched whether the ﬁshing vessel
had any history of IUU ﬁshing, including by checking
on the publications of Taiwan Fisheries Agency,37
Trygg Mat Tracking (TMT),38 and Spyglass.39

For each ﬁshing trip, the information provided on
Trace My Catch includes the corresponding code on
the tuna can, the ﬁsh species, ﬁshing area, ﬁshing
period, ﬁshing method, ﬁshing vessel details (ﬂag
state and vessel name in English), and the primary
processing and canning location of the product.

● Fourth, we cross-checked the time frame of
abuses that happened on the ﬁshing vessel DA
WANG40 with the period of time in which the vessel
supplied ﬁsh to Bumble Bee. The owner and captain
of DA WANG were indicted by Taiwanese authorities
on charges of involvement in human trafﬁcking.

From the 290 ﬁshing vessels, Greenpeace East Asia
further analyzed 119 Taiwanese ﬂagged vessels
using ﬁve approaches.36

● First, we compared the ﬁshing area information
listed on Trace My Catch against information from
the Taiwan Fisheries Agency (TFA) to determine

● Finally, through ﬁeld investigation and cross-
checking the supplying vessels from Trace My
Catch, we identiﬁed that indicators of forced labor
(as deﬁned by the ILO) were reported on six ﬁshing
vessels supplying Bumble Bee, in addition to DA
WANG.

FCF - TAIWAN’S SEAFOODPRESENCE IN THE US MARKET1. Inconsistency between information provided by Bumble
Bee and that of the Taiwan Fisheries Agency (TFA)

According to the information found on Trace My Catch, the vessels that supplied tuna to Bumble Bee ﬁshed
in the Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans, targeting skipjack and albacore tuna. The corresponding regional ﬁsheries
management organizations (RFMOs) and TFA authorized ﬁshing areas are shown in the table below:

The analysis revealed that the ﬁshing area information provided by Bumble Bee for 28 ﬁshing vessels supplying
them was different from the ﬁshing areas where they were authorized by the TFA to ﬁsh in the corresponding
time period. For example, during the period that DER HAE NO.3 ﬁshed to supply Bumble Bee (January 1 to
February 3, 2020) it was authorized by the TFA for the Indian Ocean ﬁshing area under the Indian Ocean Tuna
Commission (IOTC). However, the information regarding its ﬁshing area and species provided on Trace My Catch
was “South Paciﬁc Ocean Albacore Stock”, indicating that it was ﬁshing in the Paciﬁc Ocean.

2. Fishing vessels on
Taiwan’s IUU list

Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated ﬁshing,
collectively termed "IUU ﬁshing" are activities
that undermine the health of the ocean and
management of ﬁsh populations, and may also be
associated with human rights abuses. Not only does
IUU ﬁshing pose a threat to the environment, it is
estimated that IUU catches account for one-ﬁfth of
the global ﬁsh catch, costing the global economy an
estimated USD 9 billion to USD 17 billion annually.44
Therefore, seafood companies, including retailers,
brand owners, and traders, have the responsibility to
combat such activities by refusing to purchase IUU
ﬁsh, or from vessels or companies engaged in IUU
ﬁshing.

Taiwanese vessels that have engaged in IUU ﬁshing
in the past ﬁve years are listed by the TFA on its
“Combating IUU” web page.45 After compiling a
list of Taiwanese ﬁshing vessels that supplied tuna
to Bumble Bee through Trace My Catch, we then
compared it with the list of ﬁshing vessels with
violations published by TFA in the past ﬁve years. This
comparison revealed that Bumble Bee had sourced
tuna from 13 vessels listed on the TFA’s website for
IUU ﬁshing (see Appendix II), which means that one
in ten (13/119) of the Taiwanese-ﬂagged vessels that
we found on Bumble Bee's Trace My Catch website
were listed on the TFA list of vessels with recent
violations. Their IUU activities included storing
sharks' ﬁns without naturally attached to or tied with
their bodies, misreporting catch, setting nets near
whales, unidentiﬁable vessel markings and violations
of landing notiﬁcation in-port.46

This reveals that tuna sourced
from fishing vessels with
known IUU records is most
likely prevalent in Bumble
Bee’s supply chain.

Among these IUU records, JIN CHANG NO.17
(current name: JIN WEN NO.99) violated the shark
ﬁnning related regulation during the ﬁshing trip
from May 26, 2019 to March 3, 2020 (see Appendix
II).  According to Trace My Catch, JIN CHANG NO.17
supplied tuna to Bumble Bee during its trip from
Septemeber 1 to October 17, 2019, corresponding
to the IUU activity period. The IUU ﬁshing not only
violated shark ﬁnning regulations in Taiwan47 but
also violated Bumble Bee’s own shark ﬁnning policy
that requires sharks be landed with ﬁns naturally
attached.48

Another Taiwanese ﬁshing vessel DE CHAN NO.116,
not listed in TFA IUU list, was suspected violation of
shark ﬁning regulations and also supplied tuna to
Bumble Bee according to Trace My Catch (the details
of which are covered in the next chapter).

For vessels with inconsistent information regarding their ﬁshing areas (such as the example above), AIS data was
analyzed to determine their location during the period they ﬁshed to supply Bumble Bee. In all such cases, we found
their AIS-based trajectories were consistent with the ﬁshing areas authorized by TFA.

The health of tuna stocks may vary signiﬁcantly between oceans and species, so if Bumble Bee gives incorrect
information on the ﬁshing area of a vessel that has caught a particular species, that could mean tuna was
sourced from a stock where overﬁshing is happening. In the example above, AIS data and TFA authorization
showed that DER HAE NO.3 was ﬁshing in the Indian Ocean where overﬁshing of albacore tuna is likely
occurring.43  Meanwhile, Trace My Catch indicated this vessel was catching albacore tuna in the South Paciﬁc,
where overﬁshing of albacore tuna is not occurring. Greenpeace East Asia identiﬁed at least eleven cases
similar to DER HAE NO.3 in which ﬁshing vessels were ﬁshing in the Indian Ocean according to their AIS-based
trajectories while the Trace My Catch website indicated these vessels were ﬁshing in the South Paciﬁc Ocean.

Taiwanese vessels need to have a “certificate of distant water fisheries permit” to fish

Each Taiwanese tuna ﬁshing vessel can only operate in one ocean area in a given year.49,50,51 According to the Act

for Distant Water Fisheries (hereinafter referred to as the DWF Act), every Taiwanese distant water ﬁshing vessel

must have a certiﬁcate of distant water ﬁsheries permit (hereinafter referred to as a permit) in order to conduct

ﬁshing operations in particular ocean areas. Fishing without a permit is considered IUU ﬁshing by the TFA. Permits

are issued once a year, and ﬁshing vessels must obtain a permit to ﬁsh in the RFMOs areas. The number of permits

authorized by the TFA in the three ocean areas (the Paciﬁc Ocean, Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean) is ﬁxed.

In other words, a ﬁshing vessel with a permit can only operate in a single authorized ﬁshing area and must not

operate in other ocean areas.

3. Apparent IUU by a vessel supplying Bumble Bee

IUU ﬁshing - including ﬁshing without the appropriate
authorization - is one of the serious violations in the
DWF Act in Taiwan.52 Fishing permits are an important
tool to manage ﬁshing effort and prevent stocks from
being overﬁshed. Fishing outside the approved period/
area, with an expired permit, or in an area without
authorization are IUU ﬁshing activities. By verifying
the ﬁshing activity of vessels supplying Bumble Bee,
this study has found cases of suspected illegal activity,
meaning illegally-caught ﬁsh may be entering Bumble
Bee's supply chain (as shown in the above image).

As described previously, this analysis cross-checked
Bumble Bee’s reported information on ﬁshing trips
against information from the ﬁshing area authorized
by the TFA and AIS-based ﬁshing data from Global
Fishing Watch (GFW). This revealed evidence of
IUU ﬁshing by DE CHAN NO.116,53 a vessel supplying
Bumble Bee. This vessel engaged in a pattern of
movement highly indicative of ﬁshing according to
AIS well beyond the period it was authorized to ﬁsh
by the TFA, which ended on March 19, 2021. However
information from Bumble Bee's Trace My Catch

website indicated its ﬁshing trip continued until
August 21, 2021. Cross-checking against AIS data from
the ﬁshing vessel revealed ﬁshing patterns continued
when the vessel had no TFA ﬁshing authorization, and
also indicated a suspected illegal transshipment at sea
during that period, the details of which are covered in
the next chapter. Fishing without a valid and current
TFA authorization, and transhipment at sea are both
serious violations of the DWF Act.

August 18, 2022

Greenpeace East Asia sent a letter to TFA to
provide an opportunity to comment. In the
letter of reply from TFA, it claimed that on
February 26, 2021, the vessel owner of DE
CHAN NO.116 requested to extend its certiﬁcate
of distant water ﬁsheries permit. On March 12,
2021, TFA approved the request and issued the
permit to authorize DE CHAN NO.116 to ﬁsh
from March 20, 2021 to December 31, 2021.

4. Bumble Bee selling tuna in the US caught aboard a vessel
that has used forced labor

Greenpeace East Asia's investigations also found
that Bumble Bee has knowingly sourced tuna from a
Taiwanese owned ﬁshing vessel DA WANG, which was
involved in forced labor.

Greenpeace Southeast Asia ﬁrst revealed suspected
forced labor on board DA WANG in its 2019
investigation report “Seabound: The Journey to
Modern Slavery on the High Seas,”54 and provided
further detail in its 2021 report “Forced Labor at
Sea: The Case of Indonesian Migrant Fishers.”55 In
January 2022, US Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) conﬁrmed that DA WANG, a vessel owned
and operated by the Taiwanese company Yong Feng
Fishery Ltd, but ﬂagged to Vanuatu, used forced labor.
The CBP found evidence of all 11 of the ILO’s forced
labor indicators on the vessel, and as a result detained
all its catch imported into the US.56 In April 2022, nine
people involved with the vessel, including the vessel
owner and the captain of DA WANG, were indicted
by the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Ofﬁce(KDPO)
in Taiwan on charges including violating the Human
Trafficking Prevention Act and obstructing freedom.

According to the Prosecutor's Ofﬁce, DA WANG
departed from Taiwan on April 10, 2019. Out at sea,
a ﬁsher was reportedly beaten by the ﬁrst mate
during work and died a few days later in June 2019.
The ﬁshing vessel returned to shore to bring home
the remains of the ﬁsher, but then returned to sea to
continue ﬁshing. The following year, another ﬁsher on
board was required to continue working after being
injured, and later suffered a stroke according to the
prosecutor.57

Trace My Catch revealed that DA WANG supplied tuna
to Bumble Bee during its ﬁshing trip from May 7 to
October 18, 2019, during which time a ﬁsher on board
was reportedly beaten and later died. US CBP has
conﬁrmed DA WANG used forced labor, yet long after
Greenpeace East Asia and Greenpeace Southeast Asia
had published its evidence and even while the CBP
was detaining catch imported from this ship, Bumble
Bee already had tuna from DA WANG in its products
on US shelves (as shown in the above image).

Greenpeace East Asia
spoke to additional migrant
fishers whose experiences
as described met the ILO
indicators of forced labor,
including but not limited to
withholding wages, retention
of identity documents and
excessive overtime.

Greenpeace East Asia conducted in-depth interviews
with migrant ﬁshers who were or had been working
on Taiwanese-ﬂagged or -owned distant water ﬁshing
vessels in the past three years (2019 to 2021)  to learn
about their working and living conditions on board
and collect evidence of forced labor practices. We
found that six of the ﬁshing vessels from which ﬁshers'
interviews revealed conditions and situations that
met the ILO descriptions of forced labor indicators
have supplied tuna to Bumble Bee according to its
Trace My Catch website.

Statements of ﬁshers working on the Taiwanese
ﬁshing vessel EAGLE, revealed that the ﬁshers started
setting hooks at 4:30 am and worked right through
until noon before resting, and then started retrieving
hooks and catch at 1:30 pm again. The ﬁshers said

that they typically only got six hours sleep a day, and
when there were many ﬁsh caught, they could only
sleep for around three hours a day. According to the
ﬁshers, food on board was also restricted, and they
usually only had lunch and dinner each day. If they
were hungry, they could only look if there were any
tuna tails that they could cook and eat. The living
environment was quite harsh.

According to the Regulations on the Authorization
and Management of Overseas Employment of
Foreign Crew Members58 (hereinafter referred to as
the Overseas Employment Regulations), the wages
of migrant ﬁshers on Taiwanese distant water ﬁshing
vessels must be paid in full. However, migrant
ﬁshers’ from ﬁve vessels that supplied Bumble Bee
stated in interviews with Greenpeace East Asia that
their wages for work on board these vessels was
deducted. They stated that a security deposit of USD
600-800 per trip was deducted from their monthly
salaries of only USD 450-500, and was only returned
to them if they fulﬁlled all their duties, including
serving the full time of their two-year-long contracts.
If these statements are true, this practice likely
violates the Overseas Employments Regulations. In
addition, the ﬁshers from the six vessels reported
that their passports were conﬁscated and held by
the manning agency or the captain on the ﬁshing
vessels. According to the ﬁshers, they didn’t have
access to their own passports at sea, nor when the
vessels were in port, depriving them of their basic
human rights and freedoms.

FCF - TAIWAN’S SEAFOODPRESENCE IN THE US MARKETBased on the working and living conditions described
by the ﬁshers interviewed, Greenpeace East Asia used
the ILO forced labor indicators to comprehensively
evaluate the six ﬁshing vessels that supplied Bumble
Bee and are suspected of being involved in forced
labor.

Since distant water ﬁshing vessels usually stay at
sea for extended periods and do not return to port
frequently, and Bumble Bee has never released a
complete list of ﬁshing vessels that supply it, we can
only assess from the limited information available how

ILO forced labour indicators  that were present on board

true they are to their company philosophy of “People,
Planet, Product”.60 Based on the ﬁsher's statements
from the six vessels, cross-checking data on Trace my
Catch and AIS data, and events reportedly leading up
to the death of a ﬁsher, it seems clear that Bumble
Bee has bought tuna from at least one ﬁshing vessel

using forced labor, and that catch has entered the US
through its supply chain. Interviews with ﬁshers from
other vessels supplying Bumble Bee indicate this
may be only one of many cases of forced labor in the
company's supply chain.

FCF - TAIWAN’S SEAFOODPRESENCE IN THE US MARKETThe gap between policy and practice:
Bumble Bee and FCF

● Its employees will not have their wages

manipulated or withheld.

● If its employees were hired or recruited through
employment agencies or recruiters, they will
ensure agents are operating legally, licensed,
or certified by competent authority in country
of operation, do not extract unreasonable or
unlawful fees from employees as a condition of
hiring, do not engage in fraudulent recruitment
practices that make workers vulnerable to labor
exploitation and abuse, and do not deduct or
withhold wages from employees.

In addition, Bumble Bee also requires its suppliers to
comply with relevant laws and regulations regarding
the working hours, resting hours, compensation and
working environment of their employees, including
the guarantee of minimum wages and resting hours,
allowing employees to refuse to work overtime, and
to not be subjected to retaliation or punishment. Last
but not least, their suppliers must also agree to be
audited by Bumble Bee or a designated third party.65

However, according to our analysis and ﬁeld
investigation results, the company’s measures  are
failing to ensure that Bumble Bee tuna products do not
involve IUU and forced labor, and provide no guarantee
that the ﬁshing vessels that supply it treat their ﬁshers
in accordance with the welfare conditions stated in the
company’s code of conduct. Trace My Catch, which is
supposed to serve as a product traceability tool to help
consumers buy products with an assurance they come
from sustainable and ethical supply chains. However,
our investigation reveals that the website provides
incomplete information and in some cases inconsistent
with other reliable sources that may mislead people
to believe that Bumble Bee’s products are sourced
from ﬁshing operations that respect environmental
sustainability, ﬁshery regulations and human rights
- when our investigation of the supply chain raises
concerns that may be otherwise.

Bumble Bee’s measures are
failing to ensure that its tuna
products do not involve IUU
and forced labor.

Bumble Bee and its owner company FCF both
emphasize the importance of, and their commitment
to, environmental sustainability and human rights.
However, we found a wide gap between their policies
and the reality of their operations.

The sustainability policy of FCF lists the following
traceability speciﬁcations for tuna products:61

● FCF and its suppliers prohibit sourcing of

Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) tuna
products.

● At the primary production level, FCF and its
suppliers shall ensure that all tuna products
entering its supply chain are fully traceable to
the individual fishing vessel trip, with evidence
of fishing permit or authorization. FCF is also
committed to ensuring this traceability through
its product supply chain.

Regarding human rights issues in the supply chain,
Bumble Bee emphasizes on its ofﬁcial website that it is
committed to ensuring that all people associated with
the company can enjoy safe and fair treatment,62 and
it has also publicly expressed that it prohibits forced
labor and human trafﬁcking in its supply chain.63

In 2021, Bumble Bee updated its “Supplier Code of
Conduct”64 document, and in the section on forced
labor and human trafﬁcking, the company states that
it requires its suppliers to agree:

● Not use any slave labor, prison labor, or permit
human trafficking in its supply chain, and will
hire workers directly whenever possible.

● Its employees will work on a voluntary basis and
will not be exploited for forced, bonded, prison,
indentured labor, or any sexual purpose.
● Its employees will not be prevented from

terminating employment.

“We sleep only 3 to 4 hours a day.”

Forced labor and IUU in
Taiwan’s Distant Water Fishery

Through our investigation, we found that both
Bumble Bee and FCF sourced catch from fishing
vessels indicted or suspected of IUU, forced labor
and human trafficking, including forcing migrant
fishers to work long hours and retaining their
passports and wages. From the 290 fishing vessels
identified through Trace My Catch as suppliers to
Bumble Bee, Taiwanese-related fishing vessels
accounted for 141, indicating that Bumble Bee may
be receiving close to half of its tuna supplies from
Taiwanese-flagged and -owned vessels.

To further understand Taiwan’s distant water ﬁshing
industry, Greenpeace East Asia interviewed 27
migrant ﬁshers who had worked on 24 Taiwanese-
related ﬁshing vessels, including six that were
identiﬁed via Trace My Catch as supplying Bumble
Bee. The interviews found that suspected cases
of forced labor and IUU ﬁshing still exist on board
Taiwanese distant water ﬁshing vessels.

This chapter presents three case studies to illustrate
in more detail the experiences of migrant ﬁshers
working on Taiwanese distant water ﬁshing vessels,
and the operations and conditions described on
these 24 ﬁshing vessels and the suspected instances
of forced labor were then compared against the ILO
forced labor indicators.

Case Studies

The following case studies focus on three fishing
vessels, DE CHAN NO.116, SHIN JYI WANG NO.6
and JIN WEN NO.99, to better illustrate the
harsh working and living conditions on these
fishing vessels and their suspected illegal fishing
practices. The first of the three vessels is known to
supply tuna to Bumble Bee according to Trace My
Catch sampling.

Case 1. DE CHAN NO.116

Suspected violation of shark finning
regulations and company policy

According to the statement of the interviewed ﬁsher,

the practice on board  DE CHAN NO.116 was for ﬁshers

to cut off the heads, gills, tails, and ﬁns of the sharks

they caught and store the bodies and ﬁns separately.

This information indicates the vessel violated the
shark catch management speciﬁcations in Taiwan’s
Regulations for Tuna Longline or Purse Seine Fishing
Vessels Proceeding to the Pacific Ocean for Fishing
Operation,66 which requires the bodies and ﬁns of
sharks to be kept naturally attached or tied together
for storage.

Bumble Bee's own shark ﬁnning policy prohibits

It is prohibited to conduct transshipment between

shark ﬁnning and requires sharks be landed with

any distant water ﬁshing vessels under the DWF

Act.68 According to the ﬁsher’s statement, DE

Catch website indicates Bumble Bee purchased

tuna caught in 2021 by DE CHAN NO.116, during the

other ﬁshing vessels. Further analysis of the AIS

describes shark ﬁnning occuring on the vessel.

data of the ﬁshing vessel revealed that it showed

suspected behavior of transshipment, also known

as an encounter pattern.69 According to its AIS data,

during the period from March 2020 to August 2021,

FORCED LABOR AND IUU IN TAIWAN’S DISTANT WATER FISHERYCase 2. SHIN JYI WANG NO.6

“During the year I was on this vessel, I ate uncooked instant noodles for breakfast

and lunch, and only got rice to eat at night. The filtered water we drank was

sometimes brown, which tasted bad and made us sick.”

“Many things, including medicines, food, and fruits on the vessel were either

expired or moldy, and even the instant noodles provided were expired

already."

                                   The fisher Mr. S working on SHIN JYI WANG NO.6

DE CHAN NO.116 had two encounters with DE CHAN
NO.26, another Taiwanese vessel that was operating
in the Paciﬁc Ocean from November 2019 to August
2021. The ﬁrst encounter happened not long after
DE CHAN NO.116 departed from Taiwan, and took
place on the high seas close to the eastern side of
Marshall Islands on March 19, 2020, lasting for about
3.5 hours.70 The second encounter took place a year
later, on March 15, 2021, on the high seas near the
northern side of the Cook Islands, lasting about 4.5
hours.71 If these encounters (details are shown in
Appendix III) were indeed transshipment activities,
then the two ﬁshing vessels would be in violation
of the Act and related regulations which prohibit
transshipment at sea between ﬁshing vessels.

In addition, we found evidence suggesting that DE
CHAN NO.116 was ﬁshing during a period of time it
was not authorized to ﬁsh. Based on data from TFA,
DE CHAN NO.116 was authorized to ﬁsh from January
1 to March 19, 2021. However, based on the AIS data
of the ﬁshing vessel itself, the vessel showed an
apparent ﬁshing pattern in the Paciﬁc Ocean after
March 19, 2021 until mid-August when it started its
voyage back to Taiwan. The suspected violation was
veriﬁed through two approaches. First, the supply
chain information on Trace My Catch showed that
the ﬁshing trip of DE CHAN NO.116 which supplied
Bumble Bee was from January 22 to August 21, 2021,
exceeding the period of time it was authorized by
TFA to ﬁsh. Second, based on the AIS data from GFW,
DE CHAN NO.116 continued to show ﬁshing patterns

in the high seas of the WCPO after its authorized period
ended. These two sources of evidence indicate that the
vessel engaged in IUU ﬁshing in violation of the Act,
which stipulates that ﬁshing vessels shall not conduct
ﬁshing operations without authorization.72

Seafood entering the US from supply chains
suspected of forced labor and IUU fishing

On the basis of evidence suggesting IUU fishing,
shark finning and forced labor conditions aboard DE
CHAN NO.116, Greenpeace East Asia and Greenpeace
USA separately reached out to FCF and Bumble Bee
to verify whether they sourced fish from this vessel,
yet neither of them respond to our inquiry. However,
according to Bumble Bee’s Trace My Catch website,
the seafood harvested by DE CHAN NO.116 is already
being sold in the US. This means seafood consumers in
the US are at risk of unknowingly buying tuna caught
by a vessel suspected of forced labor, shark finning,
and illegal fishing, when they choose Bumble Bee
tuna products.

August 18, 2022
In the letter of reply from TFA, TFA stated that
according to Fisheries Monitoring Center's record,
two encounters between DE CHAN NO.116 and
DE CHAN NO.26 were reported to the Fisheries
Monitoring Center in advance, and the purpose of
the encounters were to exchange or move bait.

Transshipment at sea contributes to forced labor and IUU

Transshipment is the transfer of catch from a ﬁshing vessel to a refrigerated cargo vessel or another ﬁshing vessel.

Through this practice, a ﬁshing operator can save fuel and time and extend a vessel’s time at sea by avoiding

port visits for fuel, provisions, ﬁsh landings and crew changes. However, illegal ﬁshing vessels may conduct

ﬁsh laundering through transshipment at sea and allow their catch to enter the market in a seemingly legal

manner.73 According to a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),74 the lack of

regulation, monitoring, and control of transshipment at sea increases the risk of IUU ﬁsh entering the supply chain,

jeopardizing the sustainability and social responsibility of ﬁsheries. Recent studies also identify that transshipment

increases the risk of forced labor.75 As ﬁshing vessels use transshipments to transfer catches and supplies, ﬁshers

are isolated at sea for long periods of time, and are unable to escape or report complaints about their working and

living conditions.76

FORCED LABOR AND IUU IN TAIWAN’S DISTANT WATER FISHERYReports of harsh working and living conditions on
board

According to the statements of two ﬁshers from SHIN JYI
WANG NO.6, during their one year at sea on the vessel
they had only a single cooked meal each day, which
was rice for dinner, while breakfast and lunch consisted
only of uncooked instant noodles. The ﬁshers said that
the captain kept the galley and the water faucet locked,
so they were not able to cook for themselves, and the
captain often only distributed food, such as fruit and
bread, or medicine to the ﬁshers after it had expired or
even gone moldy. Coffee was reportedly limited to one
liter per day to all 13 migrant ﬁshers on board. According
to the ﬁshers, the vessel’s water pipes were old, the
drinking water not only had a rusty color but also a salty
taste - the ﬁshers wrapped the water pump with gloves
as a makeshift ﬁlter.

Longline ﬁshing is an extremely labor-intensive
operation. The ﬁshers’ day typically started with moving
the ﬁsh in the ship’s freezers, then hauling in the vessel’s
lines and hooks that had been set the day before.
Depending on the catch, ﬁshers reported that this
task alone could take around 12 hours. After the lines,
hooks and catch are retrieved, the ﬁshers said that they
continued work to de ploy th e ﬁshing gear again, which
could take another 6 hours before they could go to bed.
As a result, the ﬁshers reported that they could often
only sleep for around 4 hours a day, and even if there
were breaks between tasks, they had to go back to work
within 10 minutes at most. The ﬁshers reported that all
of the migrant ﬁshers slept in the same room, a crowded
space with very poor hygiene and bed bugs that bit
them as they slept. According to the interview, while
the captain had his own bathroom, the 13 ﬁshers had to
share one toilet and could only wash themselves on the
front deck with a seawater hose. They said this was the
same place and hose they used to wash the blood from
the ﬁsh they caught.

The ship's long working hours based on AIS data

The ﬁshing operation of longline vessels includes the daily
setting of thousands of hooks on the vessel’s longline,
hauling back the line, removing ﬁsh from the hooks,
sorting and stowing the catch, and more. The setting out
and hauling back of the line and hooks affects the speed
and direction of the ﬁshing vessel. Therefore, the ﬁshing
hours of the crew can be estimated, or ﬁshers’ statements
corroborated, by analyzing the trajectory of the ﬁshing
vessel. Data from the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) on
Taiwanese distant water ﬁshing vessels are not accessible
to the public, so we checked AIS data from GFW to verify
if SHIN JYI WANG NO.6 departed Taiwan in March 2020
and returned in March 2021, as per the ﬁshers’ statement,
and to understand the working hours on board during
their year at sea (as shown in the upper image on p. 26).

Using AIS data from GFW,77 which covers the period
up to December 2020, the ﬁshing effort78 of SHIN JYI
WANG NO.6 has been aggregated into hours each
month as shown in the right table.Since May 2020, the
monthly ﬁshing effort had exceeded 550 hours for three

consecutive months, and in September the same year,
the monthly ﬁshing effort was as high as 659 hours,
indicating that the average daily ﬁshing time of the
vessel could be as high as 22 hours, which presents
a very similar picture to the extremely long working
hours described by the ﬁshers on board.

Although there were months with fewer hours of
ﬁshing effort,79 the average number of ﬁshing hours
per month was still 473 hours. Furthermore, the AIS
pattern of the vessel indicates only the hours spent
setting and retrieving lines and hooks from the sea;
it is not possible to estimate the time spent on other
daily tasks from AIS data, such as sorting the catch and
maintaining the basic operations of the ﬁshing vessel.

Fishers apparently desperate to leave the ship

Nearly a year after SHIN JYI WANG NO.6 left Taiwan
in March 2020, the fishers said some of the fishers
held a strike in February 2021 coinciding with a
transshipment event between the fishing vessel and
a carrier to transfer catch and bait. This was one of
the few times during the voyage that the fishers had
any possibility of leaving the ship. The fishers told
the captain that they wanted to leave the vessel and
that their working and living conditions needed to be
improved. The fishers reported that the captain did
not allow them to leave, and he verbally agreed that
the vessel would return to Taiwan within 1-2 months,
so the fishers resumed work. However, according
to the fishers, the food situation on board did not
improve for the rest of the trip, except that the galley
was no longer kept locked.

Indicators of abusing the vulnerability of fishers

According to the ﬁshers, when SHIN JYI WANG NO.6
was on the way back to Taiwan, the manning agency
called to inquire about the situation on board. The
ﬁshers said that the captain didn’t allow the ﬁshers to
explain the situation to the agency, and told them to
wait until they were back in Taiwan. When the vessel
arrived in Taiwan, the captain reportedly changed
his attitude and story when talking to the manning
agency, accusing the ﬁshers of never working, and
asked to terminate their employment and repatriate
the ﬁshers. The ﬁshers said that some of the ﬁshers
were then asked by the manning agency to sign an
agreement to terminate their contracts, and without
consulting the ﬁshers deducted approx. USD 437
(NTD 13,000) from these ﬁshers’ salaries for their ﬂight
tickets. Some of them didn’t want to leave, and when
they proposed to stay in Taiwan to work, the agency
said the cancellation fee for refunding the ﬂight ticket
was approximately USD 134 (NTD 4,000), and the
passport renewal fee was reportedly around USD 300
(NTD 9,000). According to the interview, ﬁshers who
never agreed to ﬂy home were forced to pay both a
cancellation fee for ﬂight tickets they had not wanted,
as well as an inﬂated passport renewal fee charged by
the agency that was more than 12 times the actual cost
of around NTD 700.80

Case 3. JIN WEN NO.99

“By the time we started to move the catch, we hadn't slept for two days. After we

were done, we were exhausted. Then the captain demanded us to set the hooks

next. Even when we asked if we could sleep first, the captain replied, saying “No,

set the hooks!".”

“The captain took out weapons from his room, which were two knives, and the

fishers were all scared and hid at the front of the deck. The captain undressed

and rubbed those knives against his body. We didn’t know what it meant."

The fisher Mr. W working on JIN WEN NO.99

The death of a fisher on board

The AIS data indicates JIN WEN NO.99 ﬁshed in the
high sea during November 2020 to July 2021. Two
ﬁshers from this vessel were interviewed about
their time aboard the vessel. They recalled a story
of a fellow crew member, Mr. Z, who died following
an unknown illness on board the vessel. According
to the ﬁshers’ statements, the man began to show
symptoms of the illness in 2021, initially swelling of
his feet, then gradually spreading to his whole body.
After being sick for a month, the ﬁsher’s illness was
noticed by others, who asked the captain to provide
medicine. However, the ﬁshers said the symptoms
of Mr. Z were not reduced even after medicine was
provided, and it was not until the rest of the ﬁshers
held a one-day strike that the captain agreed and
arranged to send the sick man back to Taiwan for
treatment. Until he was sent to shore, the captain
still reportedly required Mr. Z to continue assisting
the other ﬁshers’ with their work. Unfortunately,
the ﬁshers said Mr. Z died of his illness after being
picked up by another ﬁshing vessel. The ﬁshers did
not know the cause of Mr. Z's death.

The living and working conditions on board JIN
WEN NO.99 were harsh and unrelenting. Fisher Mr.
W said that four months after the vessel left port it
was already clear that there was not enough food,
and when he complained to the captain, he was
told to put up with it. Another ﬁsher, Mr. N, also said
there was not enough food on board. According
to the ﬁshers, much of the time, the ﬁshers’ meals
consisted only of white rice with some sauce, and
each ﬁsher was given 10 packs of instant noodles
every two months. The ﬁshers said working hours

got increasingly tough during the trip: Initially,
ﬁshers were able to sleep for around seven hours a
day, but after the sick ﬁsher Mr. Z and some other
ﬁshers whose contracts had expired left the ship,
the remaining ﬁshers could only sleep for two to ﬁve
hours a day. They reported there were even times
when the vessel was transshipping with a carrier
that the ﬁshers had to work consecutively for two
days without sleep.

Allegations of beatings and threats from the
captain

According to the interview, on one occasion, after the
ﬁshers had worked for two days and nights in a row
the captain instructed them to continue working,
and the exhausted ﬁshers held a strike to take a short
break. However, the ﬁshers said the next day when
one of the ﬁshers accidentally let a hooked ﬁsh get
away, the captain suddenly began assaulting the
ﬁsher, and others close by him were also struck. After
other ﬁshers separated the captain from the ﬁshers
he had assaulted, the captain reportedly went to his
cabin and took out two knives, one that was used
for cutting shark ﬁns and one for cutting ﬁsh. Most
ﬁshers were so scared that they ran away from the
captain. After the violent incident, the ﬁshers said
that all the ﬁshers demanded to terminate their
contracts, and the captain reportedly returned to
Taiwan after obtaining the ﬁshers’ consent to pay
them less than their original salaries and also deduct
subsequent food expenses from their salaries. After
returning to Taiwan, the ﬁshers called the police, and
to avoid trouble with the law, the manning agency
paid them the amount deducted from their salaries.

August 18, 2022
In the letter of reply from TFA, TFA stated
that on May 22, 2021, JIN WEN NO.99 reported
a ﬁsher  onboard feeling unwell and he
was scheduled to be sent back to Taiwan
by another vessel. TFA also responded that
according to the autopsy certiﬁcate provided
by Taiwan Pingtung District Prosecutors
Ofﬁce, the manner of death was natural death
and the cause of death included dilated
cardiomyopathy with myocardial ﬁbrosis
change and pulmonary edema.

August 18, 2022
In the letter of reply from TFA, TFA reported
the event of beatings and threats from the
captain to the police on August 24, 2021. On
September 11, 2021, the National Police Agency
of the Ministry of the Interior replied to TFA
the investigation result, identifying the ﬁsher
not a victim of human trafﬁcking. On June 23,
2022, Fongshan Investigation Branch of Coast
Guard Administration under the Ocean Affairs
Council also replied to TFA that evidence of
human trafﬁcking was not identiﬁed. TFA also
claimed that two ﬁshers on JIN WEN NO.99
were interviewed on April 21, 2022 and July
7, 2022, and ﬁshers said they did not observe
any beating or verbal abuse on the vessel. TFA
responded that the ﬁsher's statement was very
different from the captain's, so TFA could not
make a judgement.

The Exploitative Nature of
Distant Water Fishing

The cases presented here may only represent the tip
of the iceberg in terms of forced labor, human rights
abuses and IUU ﬁshing in Taiwan’s distant water
ﬁshing industry.

In this study, Greenpeace East Asia investigated a total
of 24 Taiwanese or Taiwanese-related distant water
ﬁshing vessels through interviews with the ﬁshers
on board. The conditions and situations described
by individual ﬁshers were then assessed against the
11 ILO forced labour indicators (A description of each
indicator and the list of corresponding situations
described by the ﬁshers are detailed in Appendix III).
Among the ﬁshers interviewed, the most commonly
experienced indicators of forced labor were the
withholding of wages (indicator 8) and retention of
identity documents (indicator 7). These were followed
by abuse of vulnerability (indicator 1), excessive
overtime (indicator 11) and abusive working and living
conditions (indicator 10). In total, ﬁve of them were
identiﬁed with only one ILO indicator while 23 of them
were identiﬁed with more than four indicators.

Withholding wages and personal identity
documents is still reported to be common
practice

Vessel operators or manning agencies often
withhold their wages or confiscate the passports

of fishing crew as means to deter or prevent fishers
from terminating their contracts early, or leaving
the vessel for better job prospects elsewhere. Both
these practices have been identified by the ILO as
indicators of forced labor. In this study, we found
that these were the two most common forced
labor practices that the interviewed fishers faced-
withholding wages was reported by 27 of the 37
fishers that were interviewed while confisticating
personal identity documents was reported by 26
of the 37 interviewed fishers. The prevalence of
these practices is consistent with the findings
from Greenpeace East Asia's 2020 report Choppy
Waters,81 and Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s 2021
report Forced Labor at Sea,82 which also showed
that these two practices are rife in the distant
water fishing industry.

Note.

Since the number of fishers interviewed for each fishing vessel ranges from one to five, the frequency
of each indicator refers to the number of interviewed fishers that report the experience.

FORCED LABOR AND IUU IN TAIWAN’S DISTANT WATER FISHERYBumble Bee cans containing tuna from that ill-fated
voyage were for sale on US supermarket shelves.

● The Trace My Catch website also included details of
tuna sourced by Bumble Bee from ﬁshing vessels
that appear on the ofﬁcial TFA list of vessels with
IUU violations (“The Statistics of Infringements
and Sanctions of the DWFA”) in the past ﬁve years.
With company policies prohibiting IUU activities, a
Taiwanese parent company, and the majority of its
supplies sourced from Taiwanese vessels, it should
be a fundamental step for Bumble Bee to regularly
monitor the TFA’s list of violations to avoid sourcing
from vessels involved in IUU ﬁshing.

Further investigation, in the form of interviews with
ﬁshers working on Taiwanese-ﬂagged and -owned
distant water ﬁshing vessels, including six vessels
supplying Bumble Bee, revealed evidence of yet

more instances of suspected IUU ﬁshing (including
alleged shark ﬁnning and illegal transhipment)
and forced labor conditions. All 37 cases in this
report were identiﬁed with at least one of the ILO
indicators of forced labor, and over half of the ﬁshers
had experienced or observed four or more of the
11 indicators. While most of the ﬁshers interviewed
had reported both their wages withheld and identity
documents retained, experiencing harsh living and
working conditions such as lack of food and sleep was
also highly relevant.

Both Bumble Bee86 and FCF87 have policies on
sustainability and corporate social responsibility that
are supposed to extend through their supply chains.
However, these ﬁndings raise serious doubts about
the level of commitment the companies have to their
own policies on IUU ﬁshing and forced labor, and their
responsibility towards their customers.

Greenpeace East Asia calls on Bumble Bee and FCF to urgently undertake the following
actions to address issues of unsustainable practices, illegality, and forced labor in their
supply chains:

★ Immediately issue an apology to the exploited fishers, retailers and consumers to whom they sold
tuna from a vessel even after forced labor and human trafficking was confirmed on its fishing trip.

★ Immediately remove products involved with vessels suspected of IUU fishing and forced labor
revealed in this report from the US market, and temporarily stop trading with those suppliers,
pending a full and independent investigation.

★ Immediately cross-check the full list of supply vessels and companies against official lists of IUU
violations and forced labor cases and terminate any existing business with such suppliers, to
ensure that no further trade occurs with suppliers that have been found to engage in those illegal
practices.

★ Immediately disclose to the public a complete list of their supplying fishing vessels, carriers,

manufacturers, brands and receive third party verification to ensure that customers and consumers
have sufficient and accurate information to make their buying decisions.

★ Immediately establish an independent investigation committee to investigate the flaw of Trace My
Catch and disclose to the public within six months the findings and a time-bound plan to phase out
IUU and forced labor in their supply chains.

★ Establish within 90 days an effective at-sea workers’ grievance mechanism based on the United

Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), and as a prerequisite to trading
with any potential suppliers.

★ Revise their human rights policies within 90 days to accord with international standards and

best practices, including zero recruitment fees and deposits, and regular pay as required under
ILO Work in Fishing Convention (ILO C188)88, equality and non-discrimination under the ILO
Migrant Worker Conventions, and the ILO core labor standards, including the rights to freedom of
association and collective bargaining guaranteed under ILO Convention Nos. 87 and 98.89

★ Announce within 90 days a time-bound plan to phase out transshipment at sea, including but not
limited to stop procuring fish from fishing vessels that conduct transshipment at sea, and end any
contracts with suppliers that do not follow that policy.

Conclusions and
Recommendations

Bumble Bee, as a long-established and familiar
canned tuna brand in the US, has an estimated
quarter share of the US canned tuna market83.  FCF,
the parent company of Bumble Bee, is more than
just a tuna supplier. It is also deeply involved in the
production of tuna products, and integral to Taiwan’s
distant water ﬁshing sector84. Between them, these
two companies hold great power - over the health
of our ocean, over the lives of ﬁshers at sea, and
over consumer choices in one of the biggest tuna
importing countries in the world - the United States.85
But with great power comes great responsibility, and
currently, neither of those companies is meeting its
responsibilities.

This investigation has revealed that the information
provided by Bumble Bee to its customers is
incomplete, in some cases it is inconsistent with
our analysis results, and in a number of cases the
company’s own information shows it was sourcing ﬁsh
from vessels that had engaged in or were suspected of
IUU ﬁshing, forced labor or human rights abuses.

Among 119 Taiwanese-ﬂagged vessels investigated,
there were 28 in which information provided by
Bumble Bee on the ﬁshing area where its tuna was
sourced contradicted ofﬁcial information from the
TFA on where the supply vessel was authorized to ﬁsh.

In all such cases, verifying the vessel location against a
third data source (AIS data from Global Fishing Watch)
revealed that it was corroborated the TFA information.
In at least eleven cases, this incorrect reporting meant
that the product contained tuna caught from a location
where overﬁshing was occuring, but the company
claimed it was tuna from a healthier stock.

In several cases, the information shared by Bumble Bee
on the Trace My Catch website revealed the company
sourced tuna from vessels with published links to
IUU ﬁshing and/or forced labor. These cases were
identiﬁed by cross-checking Bumble Bee’s traceability
information against readily available sources that
Bumble Bee and FCF themselves should have
consulted, to uphold their own policies on avoiding IUU
and forced labor:

● Information on Trace My Catch showed that Bumble
Bee had sourced tuna from a vessel, DA WANG, that
Greenpeace Southeast Asia had revealed, US CBP
had conﬁrmed, and Taiwanese authorities were
prosecuting for forced labor and human trafﬁcking.
One of the ﬁshers on board DA WANG was reportedly
beaten and died during a 2019 ﬁshing trip supplying
Bumble Bee, and even after the US CBP has
determined that Da Wang use forced labor in their
operations and seized further imports from the vessel,

indicator

ILO’s description of that indicator91

Experiences or observations reported by fishers in
this study

●

●

●

●

●

●

  Being unfamiliar with relevant Taiwanese laws
and regulations and their own rights, the fishers
signed work contracts that were in violation
of provisions in the Overseas Employment
Regulations.
  Not being aware of their right to have copies of
the labor contracts they signed with the vessel
operator and the service contracts they signed
with the Taiwanese manning agency, most fishers
only had copies of contracts with foriegn manning
agencies.
  Being forced to sign documents in foreign
languages that they are not familiar with.
  Being charged unreasonably high administrative
fees, such as the passport fee and flight
cancellation fees for flights they did not request.
  Being transferred to another fishing vessel which
is owned by the same company without signing a
new contract.
  Being told they are employed illegally and they
should not leave port.

●

●

  Being put to work on fishing vessels that were not
the same ones as specified on their contracts.
  Being promised to change to another job, but
instead being sent back to their home countries
following accusations by the vessel owners of
breaking their contracts.

1. Abuse of
vulnerability

People who lack knowledge of the local
language or laws, have few livelihood options,
belong to a minority religious or ethnic group,
have a disability or have other characteristics
that set them apart from the majority
population are especially vulnerable to abuse
and more often found in forced labor.

When an employer takes advantage of a
worker’s vulnerable position, for example,
to impose excessive working hours or to
withhold wages, a forced labor situation may
arise.

2. Deception

Deception relates to the failure to deliver
what has been promised to the worker,
either verbally or in writing. Victims of forced
labor are often recruited with promises of
decent, well paid jobs. But once they begin
working, the promised conditions of work do
not materialize, and workers ﬁnd themselves
trapped in abusive conditions without the
ability to escape. In these cases, workers have
not given free and informed consent. Had
they known the reality, they would never have
accepted the job offer.

3. Restriction
of movement

If workers are not free to enter and exit the
work premises, subject to certain restrictions
which are considered reasonable, this
represents a strong indicator of forced labor.

●

  Not being allowed to leave or get off the vessels
when in port. (This situation was not found in the
field investigation described in this report, but
the situation was identified in the Greenpeace
Southeast Asia report Forced Labor at Sea in 2021)

37

38

APPENDIX IX.

ILO forced
labour
indicator

4. Isolation

ILO’s description of that indicator91

Experiences or observations reported by fishers in
this study

Workers may not know where they are, the
worksite may be far from habitation and
there may be no means of transportation
available. But equally, workers may be
isolated even within populated areas, by
being kept behind closed doors or having
their mobile phones or other means of
communication conﬁscated, to prevent them
from having contact with their families and
seeking help.

●

  Not being allowed to freely communicate with the
manning agency when the latter called to inquire
about how the ﬁshers were mistreated on board.

5. Physical
and sexual
violence

Forced laborers, their family members,
and close associates may be subjected to
actual physical or sexual violence. Violence
can include forcing workers to take drugs
or alcohol so as to have greater control
over them. As violence is not acceptable
as a disciplinary measure under any
circumstances, it is a very strong indicator of
forced labor.

6. Intimidation
and threats

Victims of forced labor may suffer
intimidation and threats when they complain
about their conditions or wish to quit their
jobs. In addition to threats of physical
violence, other common threats used
against workers include denunciation to the
immigration authorities, loss of wages or
access to housing or land, sacking of family
members, further worsening of working
conditions, or withdrawal of “privileges”
such as the right to leave the workplace.
Constantly insulting and undermining
workers also constitutes a form of
psychological coercion, designed to increase
their sense of vulnerability.

7. Retention
of identity
documents

The retention by the employer of identity
documents or other valuable personal
possessions is an element of forced labor if
workers are unable to access these items on
demand and if they feel that they cannot
leave the job without risking their loss. In
many cases, without identity documents, the
worker will not be able to obtain other jobs or
access essential services, and may be afraid
to ask for help from authorities or NGOs.

●

  Being physically assaulted by the captain or
senior crew on board.

●

●

●

  When requesting the termination of their
contract, being told that they are not allowed to
go back to their home countries, or will have their
deposit withheld.
  Witnessing the beating of fellow fisher(s) by the
captain and feeling threatened by it.
  Having the captain brandish knives to intimidate
and scare the crew into compliance.

●

  Having their identity documents, such as
passports, confiscated by the captains or the
manning agencies, and being denied access to
those documents.

ILO forced
labour
indicator

8. Withholding
of wages

9. Debt
bondage

ILO’s description of that indicator91

Experiences or observations reported by fishers in
this study

Workers may be obliged to remain with an
abusive employer while waiting for the wages
that are owed to them.The fact of irregular
or delayed payment of wages does not
automatically imply a forced labor situation.
But when wages are systematically and
deliberately withheld as a means to compel
the worker to remain, and deny him or her
of the opportunity to change employer, this
points to forced labor.

Forced laborers are often working in an
attempt to pay off an incurred or sometimes
even inherited debt.  The debt can arise from
wage advances or loans to cover recruitment
or transport costs or from daily living or
emergency expenses, such as medical costs.
Debt bondage – or bonded labor – reﬂects
an imbalance in power between the worker-
debtor and the employer-creditor. It has
the effect of binding the worker to the
employer for an unspeciﬁed period of time,
anything from a single season, to years,
or even successive generations. It bears
no resemblance to taking a “normal” loan
from a bank or other independent lender,
for repayment on mutually agreed and
acceptable terms

●

  Having part of their wages deducted monthly
in the name of a deposit, and if the fishers
terminated their contract early, this deposit
would not be returned and instead be used for a
transportation fee for sending them back home.

●

  Being charged recruitment or transportation
fees, requiring the fishers to take loans from the
manning agencies and resulting in deductions
from their monthly wages.

10. Abusive
working
and living
conditions

Forced labor victims are likely to endure living
and working conditions that workers would
never freely accept. Work may be performed
under conditions that are degrading
(humiliating or dirty) or hazardous (difﬁcult
or dangerous without adequate protective
gear), and in severe breach of labor law.
Forced laborers may also be subjected to
substandard living conditions, such as being
made to live in overcrowded and unhealthy
conditions without any privacy.

11. Excessive
overtime

Forced laborers may be obliged to work
excessive hours or days beyond the limits
prescribed by national law or collective
agreement. They can be denied breaks and
days off, having to take over the shifts and
working hours of colleagues who are absent,
or by being on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week.

precaution to avoid vessel collisions, though
its use has evolved to many other applications
including detection of illicit activities at sea. The
use of AIS for such purposes may be undermined
by “AIS spooﬁng”, which is a limitation of the
