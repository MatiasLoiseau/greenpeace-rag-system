On the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, the worst commercial nuclear power
accident in history, Greenpeace has documented nearly 200 “near misses” at U.S.
nuclear reactors since 1986.

Of the nearly 200 “near misses” to a meltdown cited in US Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) documents, eight “near misses” are considered the most signiﬁcant.
This means that according to the NRC, the risk of a core meltdown is greater than one in
1,000. Only one of the eight reactors that experienced the most signiﬁcant “near misses”
was on the NRC’s regulatory radar prior to the problems occurring.

Of those nuclear reactors that experienced important “near misses” since the NRC began
its new oversight process in 2000, only one reactor was on NRC’s radar prior to the
“near miss.”  The NRC’s inability to identify and prevent these “near misses” is disturbing.
While, the nuclear industry and the agency continue to claim that Chernobyl can’t happen
here, we’ve already come disturbingly close.

If any of these “near misses” had progressed to a meltdown, the government regulators
have little conﬁdence that any of the nuclear reactor containments would survive.  In
fact, some containment designs used in General Electric and Westinghouse reactors are
virtually certain to fail after a meltdown of the radioactive fuel. A nuclear reactor meltdown
and the subsequent failure of containment is an “American Chernobyl.”

The reactors that experienced the most “near misses” since Chernobyl, DC Cook 1 and
Dresden 3, both have containments that offer the public little or no defense in the event of
a meltdown.

These “near misses” make it disturbingly clear that nuclear reactors are as dangerous
today as they were 20 years ago when Chernobyl reawakened millions to the realities of
nuclear power.

In this post-9/11 age, Americans are more concerned than ever about safety and
national security. This report is a stark reminder that not only is an American Chernobyl
possible, but that nuclear reactors in the U.S. have already come disturbing close to
another meltdown.  Equally troubling is the fact that neither the government regulators
nor the nuclear industry are likely to prevent an “American Chernobyl.” Regrettably, the
nuclear industry and the NRC have been more concerned with ensuring that reactors are
proﬁtable than safe.

Although Chernobyl took place twenty years ago in the former Soviet Union, its legacy
lives on today.  The effects on the lives of millions who live in the Ukraine, in Belarus and
in Russia have not gone unnoticed.  But, here in the United States, the nuclear industry,
their lobbyists and their allies in government are working hard to keep Chernobyl but a
distant memory to the average American.

As U.S. corporations contemplate building more nuclear reactors, it is important that our
government regulators remember Chernobyl and speak honestly and forthrightly about
the very real dangers posed by splitting atoms.   Nuclear reactors are, by their very
nature, inherently dangerous.  Each reactor has the potential to devastate the state or
region in which it operates.  Unless the nuclear industry and the government regulators
re-learn this lesson of Chernobyl more nuclear disasters are likely to follow.

✛  Introduction

 + Introduction

Twenty years ago, a nuclear reactor in the former Soviet Union experienced a “reactivity
excursion” and as the radioactive cloud released by the explosion began to travel around
the globe the word “Chernobyl” was seared into the minds of people around the planet.

The nuclear industry’s premature response was to denigrate the Soviet design, deny that
the reactor had a containment and claim that such an accident was impossible in the U.S.

However, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) testiﬁed before Congress
that the chances that a U.S. reactor would experience such an accident in the twenty
years following Chernobyl were slightly better than ﬂipping a coin.  In testimony, the NRC
also acknowledged that the Chernobyl reactor had a pressure-suppression containment
design that was similar in philosophy to the containments used in General Electric Mark I
and Mark II and Westinghouse Ice condenser reactors.

This report reveals that the nuclear industry and its regulators have ﬂipped the meltdown
coin repeatedly at US reactors; at times proving the adage that “its better to be lucky than
good.”  The U.S. industry has thus far avoided another core meltdown since the accident
at Three Mile Island in 1979; however that doesn’t mean that they haven’t come close.

Since the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, the nuclear industry and its allies
in government have been attempting to rewrite history. Once again, they are claiming that
an American Chernobyl is not possible.

Greenpeace documents those near misses at U.S. reactors that have been recognized by
the government’s regulators as precursors to meltdowns. If these accidents had resulted
in a meltdown the government has little conﬁdence that any of the reactor containments
could withstand the accident for which they were not designed.

Greenpeace believes that the public has a right to know of the threats posed by the 104
reactors still licensed to operate in the US.  As the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster
nears it is imperative that our government ofﬁcials and regulators speak openly and
honestly about the accident, its aftermath, and the continuing tragedy.   This report is an
effort to address the nuclear propagandist’s attempts to downplay the dangers of nuclear
power in the United States.  Chernobyl is now a distant memory for most Americans, but
as George Santayana wrote, “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to
repeat it.”

This report shows that an accident comparable to Chernobyl is a possibility and that nuclear
power poses an ever-present danger to our families, our communities and our nation.

On April 26, 1986, the number 4 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
former Soviet Union experienced the worst commercial nuclear accident in history. The
accident occurred while operators were conducting tests, the reactor operators had
turned off the plant’s safety systems and then lost control of the reactivity in the reactor.
The explosion and subsequent ﬁre spewed massive amounts of radiation into the
surrounding community & the environment.1

In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, the U.S. nuclear industry began a campaign of
denial and obfuscation.  Even before the causes of the accident were known, the U.S.
nuclear industry claimed that there was little for the United States to learn from the
Chernobyl disaster and that it couldn’t happen here.2

Even as the radioactive plume was making it’s way around the planet; U.S. nuclear
industry representatives belittled Soviet technology. According to Time Magazine:

Soviet engineers and scientists have tended to show much less concern for safety than
their Western counterparts. Says Physicist Robert Sachs, director of the Enrico Fermi
Institute at the University of Chicago and a strong nuclear power proponent: ‘’Those of
us who know something about Soviet safety policy have wondered how they have gotten
away without a big accident for as long as they have.’’ The lack of a containment structure
for the Chernobyl reactor, which might have limited the emission of radioactivity into the
atmosphere after the explosion, is only the most glaring example.3

Despite the U.S. nuclear industry’s attempts to deﬂect attention from the safety problems
with their own reactors, the reality of the threat posed by nuclear power was testiﬁed to in
the wake of the disaster and ongoing tragedy.

✛  A Commissioner Sets the Record Straight

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) acknowledged before Congress that
U.S. reactors were capable of catastrophic accidents that could release a radioactive
plume of contamination equal to or greater than that from the Chernobyl reactor.

Less than a month after the disaster, NRC Commissioner James K. Asselstine testiﬁed that,

given the present level of safety being achieved by the operating nuclear power
plants in this country we can expect to see a core meltdown accident within the next
20 years and it is possible that such an accident could result in off site releases of
radiation which are as large as or larger than the releases estimated to have occurred
at Chernobyl.

While we hope that their occurrence is unlikely, there are accident sequences for U.S.
plants that can lead to rupture or bypassing of containment in U.S. reactors which
would result in the off-site release of ﬁssion products comparable or worse than
the releases estimated by the NRC staff to have taken place during the Chernobyl
accident.

That is why the Commission told Congress recently that it could not rule out a
commercial nuclear power plant accident in the United States resulting in tens of
billions of dollars of property losses and injuries to the public.4

The U.S. nuclear industry has thus far been fortunate enough to avoid the catastrophic
accident testiﬁed to by Commissioner Asselstine; however, his assessment of the
potential losses resulting from such an accident was no exaggeration.

In 1990, the Wall Street Journal reported on a study conducted by a Soviet nuclear
industry economist on the continuing economic disaster of the Chernobyl accident.  The
study, conducted by the same institute that designed Chernobyl, found that the cost of
the disaster had originally been underestimated and may cost twenty times more than
Moscow’s original estimates.  By 2000, the report estimated that the Chernobyl accident
would cost the country between 170 and 215 billion rubles from contaminated farmland,
lost electricity production and other economic fall-out.  The accident contaminated
approximately 31,000 square kilometers or 12,400 square miles.  When the Wall Street
Journal article was published in 1990, the contaminated land was considered a total loss
for at least two generations.5

The Wall Street Journal concluded that, “The total bill suggests that the Soviet Union may
have been better off if they had never begun building nuclear reactors in the ﬁrst place.” 6

11

Of course the nuclear industry and its proponents were none too pleased with the
commissioner’s testimony and the Atomic Industrial Forum, a predecessor of today’s
propagandists at the Nuclear Energy Institute, challenged his testimony. In his
response to a letter from the president of the Atomic Industrial Forum, Commissioner
Asselstine stated that:

I recall reading in the newspapers in recent months statements by senior ofﬁcials
within the nuclear industry that our plants are “perfectly safe” and we “will not have a
Chernobyl-type plant accident here.”....To convey the impression that Chernobyl-type
releases are impossible in this country is as inaccurate as conveying the message
that a similar disaster is a certainty.... 8

The commissioner pointed out that the U.S nuclear industry was already experiencing
serious events due to improper maintenance, equipment failures, design deficiencies
and human error.  Asselstine stated that “these contributors are causing the total
loss of one or more safety systems and multiple equipment failures at plants that
can substantially erode defense in depth and lead to accident conditions beyond the
design basis of the plant.” 9

The commissioner was courageous enough to challenge the nuclear industry’s rhetoric
and acknowledge that an “American Chernobyl” was indeed possible.

12

Now, twenty years later, nuclear propagandists are again making misleading claims about
the Chernobyl accident and its aftermath. However, this time it is not merely the nuclear
industry and their lobbyists that are engaging in this nonsense, its those that supposedly
regulate the nuclear industry.

The Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Nils Diaz, has repeatedly
claimed that there would not be an “American Chernobyl.”  According to the NRC
Chairman, what really happened at Chernobyl was, “a catastrophic release of radioactivity
fueled by a ﬁre in a combustible graphite reactor core, without a containment, that burned
for many hours.” 10

Unfortunately Mr. Diaz’s statement before the American Nuclear Society would lead one
to believe that Chernobyl did not have containment.

That is factually inaccurate and is at odds with the NRC testimony to Congress in the
wake of the Chernobyl accident.  NRC testimony stated:

Unit 4 at Chernobyl contains characteristics of both containment and conﬁnement.
There appear to be two regions that appear to be designed to withstand 27 psi and
57 psi.  These volumes are in turn interconnected with two suppression pools via
pressure relief valves and downcomers.  The remaining portions of the plant are
housed within a conﬁnement structure. 11  (See Appendix A.)

The NRC Chairman is again displaying the technological arrogance that so concerned
Wall Street in the wake of the Chernobyl accident:

I am not trying to compare in any way American reactors to Chernobyl-type reactors
because there is no comparison. Our reactors are so much better and so is our
society. What I am trying to portray is that the failure of the former Soviet Union
to do what was needed to mitigate the accident signiﬁcantly contributed to its
consequences. 12

The Chairman’s hubris is quite remarkable given the fact that his agency had to back
away from claims that U.S. reactors were invulnerable to airliner attack after 9-11 and
that a football sized hole had recently been discovered in the reactor at Davis Besse.
However, the smug attitude displayed by the NRC Chairman does not stop there. In
another speech, Chairman Diaz drew a stark comparison between the Soviet response
to the disaster and how America would respond to a nuclear disaster:

 + An “American Chernobyl”

13

What I am going to rule out is that the health consequences of a Chernobyl-like
scenario would be applicable to the United States.  Chernobyl was much more than a
cata-strophic reactor failure and the release of enormous quantities of radioactivity to
the environment. Chernobyl’s failure was the failure of a totalitarian society to protect
and care for its people after a disaster...and this horriﬁc mis-handling of public health
and safety cannot and is not going to happen in America.... Make no mistake, America
will deliver the necessary responses to protect public health and safety, and therefore,
there will be no American Chernobyl. 13

The NRC Chairman’s comments are almost laughable in light of the governments failed
response to Hurricane Katrina.  The NRC’ Chairman’s attitude is cause for concern.
This same attitude raised concerns on Wall Street twenty years ago.  In the wake of the
disaster, the Wall Street securities ﬁrm of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette (DLJ) hired
former NRC Commissioner Victor Gilinsky.  DLJ wanted to address the nuclear industry’s
inability to acknowledge the reality of the Chernobyl accident and its implications for the
U.S. industry.  According to the DLJ report:

14

The DLJ report, entitled Chernobyl: Some Lessons and Implications for Lower Quality
Electric Utilities, discussed the nuclear industry’s motives for downplaying the Chernobyl
accident and attempting to draw distinctions between U.S. and Soviet designs.  According
to the Wall Street analysis, the nuclear industry was under severe ﬁnancial strain due to
the massive cost overruns for their nuclear projects and the industry was attempting to
minimize additional delays. 15

Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette report suggested that the industry’s response to the
Chernobyl accident was, at best, short sighted.   The wall street ﬁrm quotes the Report
of the Presidential Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, informally known as
the Kemeny Commission report.

The report by former NRC Commissioner Gilinsky & DLJ concluded that:

17

Only after the meltdown at TMI and the explosion at Chernobyl has the nuclear industry
acknowledged that the public’s concerns over nuclear power plant risk are well founded.
In a speech to his nuclear brethren at the American Nuclear Society in 1988, the
Executive Vice President of the GPU Nuclear Corporation, owner of Three Mile Island
acknowledged that:

Many people in the nuclear industry feel that our problem is primarily the fault of
the public, or the media, or the schools, or the anti-nukes.  But if we step a back
one pace and are honest with ourselves, we must agree in a broad sense that the
public’s mistrust has its foundation.  We said we were designing and building plants
in which a core meltdown was essentially impossible—and then came TMI-2.  We
then argued we could have meltdowns but not energetic reactivity accidents—and
then came Chernobyl.  We argued that we might contaminate a power plant but
not a neighborhood—and now reindeer in Lapland and lambs in Wales are part
of the nuclear debate.  The public—our public—citizens, media, public utility
commissions—come away doubtful and with a feeling of having been mislead (sic). 18

 + An “American Chernobyl”

15

The public has been misled and the nuclear propagandists both in industry and
government are at it again.   However, this time the pro-nuclear spin is due to the fact
that the nuclear industry is attempting to build new reactors for the ﬁrst time in over a
generation.  Once again the nuclear industry and its allies in government are claiming
that a Chernobyl accident can not happen here.

Greenpeace begs to differ:

+  U.S. reactors can have accidents with consequences equal to or greater than

the Chernobyl disaster.

+  U.S. reactors have and will continue to experience “near misses” that could

result in a meltdown.

+  U.S. reactor containments were not designed to withstand a reactor meltdown

and the government has little conﬁdence that any of them could.

Below, Greenpeace documents the nuclear “near misses” at U.S. reactors since the
Chernobyl disaster.

✛  Nuclear “Near Misses” Terminology

 + Nuclear “Near Misses” Terminology

16

In order to compile the nuclear near misses since Chernobyl, Greenpeace reviewed the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s program for tracking and evaluating near misses
or as the agency terms them “precursors to severe core damage accidents” or “accident
precursors.”  Accident precursors are those actual events or conditions at nuclear
reactors that if additional failures had occurred, would have resulted in inadequate cooling
of the radioactive fuel and could have caused severe core damage; i.e., a meltdown. 19

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission analyses event reports submitted by the
nuclear corporations to capture those events or conditions that could have led to a
meltdown. The NRC has been tracking accident precursors since 1979.  For the purpose
of analyzing risk, the NRC breaks nuclear reactor events into two categories: Initiating
Events and Degraded Conditions. 20

Initiating Events are actual occurrences such as a loss of offsite power (LOOP) or an
automatic or manual shutdown (SCRAM) of the reactor with complications like any
additional equipment failures or degradation of safety system function. 21

Degraded Conditions are those recognized safety system or equipment degradations or
unavailability that came to light without an occurrence of an initiating event. 22

To analyze Initiating Events, the NRC calculates a conditional core damage probability or
CCDP. CCDP represents the probability that the nuclear reactor would experience core
damage or a meltdown of the radioactive fuel rods, given an occurrence of the initiating
event and any subsequent equipment failure or degradation. 23

To analyze Degraded Conditions, the NRC calculates the increase in core damage
probability or CDP. CDP represents the increase in the probability that the reactor would
damage the core for the period that safety equipment was unavailable or incapable
or performing its function. However, the NRC’s risk models do not account for the
unavailability of equipment greater than a year. 24

 + Nuclear “Near Misses” Terminology

17

Once the NRC has assessed the events, they determine the probability that it could have
led to core melt.  The NRC’s Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) program uses CCDP
and CDP interchangeably and uses scientiﬁc notation to describe the signiﬁcance.  So for
Three Mile Island or Chernobyl the core damage probability is 1 in 1.  For those accidents
that did not result in core damage the NRC assess a probability expressed as a negative
function. So an accident with a probability of 1 X 10-1 has a one in ten chance of causing
core damage.  To simplify the risk equation, the scientiﬁc community and the NRC’s risk
analysts use E to represent X10.

So a probability of:

1.0 0 E-1 = 1/10;

1.0 0 E-2 = 1/100;

1.0 0 E-3 = 1/1,000,

1.0 0 E-4 = 1/10,000,

1.0 0 E-5 = 1/100,000

1.0 0 E-6 = 1/1,000,000

25

For the purposes of assessing reactor risk the NRC breaks the events into categories
based upon their perceived signiﬁcance.  According to the NRC, accident precursors with
a Conditional Core Damage Probability or CCDP or CDP of 1 in 1000 are considered
signiﬁcant, accident precursors with a CCDP of 1 in 10,000 are considered important and
those with a CCDP of greater than 1 in a Million are consider precursors. 26

In order to compile the Nuclear “Near Misses” since the Chernobyl Accident, Greenpeace
attempted to review the entire history of the NRC’s efforts to understand the events
and conditions that could lead to a meltdown at a U.S. nuclear reactor.   However, in
the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001, the NRC has repeatedly been forced or
embarrassed into withdrawing information from the public domain. According to the NRC,

detailed accident analyses were classified as “SENSITIVE - NOT FOR PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE” based on the guidance provided by the Executive Director
for Operations in the memorandum to the Commission (dated April 4, 2002),
concerning the release of information to the public that could provide significant
assistance to support an act of terrorism. 27

In more recent guidance, the NRC allows for the public release of accident sequence
precursor analyses “that do not contain information related to uncorrected conﬁgurations
or conditions that could be useful to an adversary.” 28

NRC’s efforts to close the proverbial barn door have proven to be a source of amusement
& frustration as the NRC has been forced to confront the reality of the information in their
possession.  Greenpeace has made a good faith effort to compile all currently available
information on those accidents that could have led to a meltdown.

While this compilation of near misses is thorough, it is by no means comprehensive.
NRC has repeatedly identiﬁed events of interest that were impracticable or impossible to
model. 29

Additionally, in the course of our study Greenpeace has learned that the agency has
performed a security review on Precursors to Potential Severe Core Damage Accidents,
NUREG/CR 4674.  The NRC has seen ﬁt to remove from the public domain at least
twenty-two volumes containing Oak Ridge National laboratory’s assessments of accident
precursors.  The NRC has deemed these documents to be too dangerous to release to
the public because they could either help terrorists or because the condition that poses
the threat has not been corrected at the speciﬁc reactor. 30

While it’s rather hard to believe that analyses of reactor accident precursors that
are decades old could still be of use to terrorists, Greenpeace has only used those
documents that have already cleared the NRC’s review process.  In addition to the NRC
annual analysis of accident precursors, Greenpeace used the latest available calculations
from other NRC documents including NUREGS, Abnormal Occurrence Reports, Accident
Sequence Precursor Analysis.  When discrepancies were discovered in NRC’s risk
calculations Greenpeace used the most recent calculation provided by the NRC.

Greenpeace has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the NRC and
requested that the agency redact only those portions of the reports that actually contain
sensitive or safeguards information.

It must be noted that the NRC risk models are a best attempt at under-standing the
accident sequences that lead to damaging the radioactive fuel in the reactor core.
However, they are only models.  Some events can not be analyzed because they do
not ﬁt into the probabilistic risk assessment models.  These models do not recognize
the threat from sabotage, external events such as ﬂoods, earthquakes, tornadoes,
hurricanes and aircraft crashes.31 As the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has
repeatedly pointed out to the Commission, their risk assessments do not even reﬂect the
fact that the reactor vessel can fail. 32

A 2002 NRC memo, ﬁrst obtained by Greenpeace through the Freedom of Information
Act, shows that for even the most dangerous precursors the NRC’s risk models are
seriously lacking.  For accident precursors from 1993 to 2000 with a conditional core
damage probability of greater than 1 in 100,000 or CCDP > E-5 the NRC found that:

(1)  approximately 42 percent of the cumulative CCDP from ASP (accident sequence
precursor) events is not typically modeled in PRAs, despite the fact that they
represent only 9 percent (5/54) of the number of ASP events with CCDP > E-5; and

(2)  over 59 percent of the cumulative CCDP in the E-3 range was not typically
  modeled in PRAs - the fraction of the cumulative CCDP not modeled in typical
  PRAs increased for the higher CCDP ranges.33

This NRC analysis of reactor precursors over the last decade led the author
to conclude that, “reliance on regulatory tools developed from current PRAs
(probabilistic risk assessments) could miss a significant fraction of the actual risk
and that defense in depth design and plant oversight activities which go beyond risk-
based tools need to be maintained.” 34

For a more comprehensive discussion regarding the weaknesses of probabilistic
risk assessments see: David Lochbaum, Nuclear Power Plant Risk Studies:
Failing the Grade, Union of Concerned Scientists, August 2000.  Additionally, for
a more technical discussion of the limitations of risk analysis, see Hirsch, Einfalt,

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has analyzed hundreds of events since the
Chernobyl disaster that could have led to a meltdown.  Of those events, the NRC has
identiﬁed nearly 200 as precursors to severe core damage accidents. According to the
NRC, most events can be directly or indirectly associated with four initiators:

1.  a reactor trip (which includes loss of main feed water);
2.  a Loss of Off Site Power or LOOP;
3.  a Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident or LOCA, and
4.  Steam Generator Tube Ruptures. 36

Despite NRC claims to the contrary an “American Chernobyl” is possible.If any of these
“near misses” had progressed to a meltdown the government has little conﬁdence that
any of the reactor containments could withstand the accident. 37

A reactor meltdown and the subsequent failure of the reactor containment is an
“American Chernobyl.”

Not only is an “American Chernobyl” possible but the government regulators are
not likely to prevent it from occurring. Greenpeace reviewed the most dangerous
precursors to see if these reactors were among those captured by the NRC’s oversight
process. Of the eight signiﬁcant near misses since Chernobyl, only one reactor was
on NRC’s radar screen prior to the near miss.  Despite receiving additional regulatory
attention and being listed on NRC’s ﬁrst “watch list” of problem reactors after the
Chernobyl disaster, Turkey Point 3 in Florida still experienced one of the most
signiﬁcant “near misses” since the disaster.

None of the other seven reactors that experienced signiﬁcant “near misses” since
Chernobyl were on NRC’s regulatory radar:

Davis Besse in Ohio in 2002;
Shearon Harris in North Carolina in 1991;
Catawba 1 in South Carolina in 1986;
Wolf Creek in Kansas in 1994;
Catawba 2 in South Carolina in 1996;
Vogtle 1 & 2 in Georgia in 1990;

The NRC has since scrapped the watch list process in favor of a supposedly risk-
informed performance based approach to regulation.39  Unfortunately, the new oversight
process has not improved the NRC’s ability to prevent reactors from posing a threat to the
public health and safety.

The NRC’s new oversight process failed to identify the most signiﬁcant precursor since
Chernobyl.  Despite the NRC chairman’s claims that the public was never at risk, the
Davis Besse “near miss” was the most signiﬁcant in the last two decades. According to
NRC risk calculations, the Davis Besse precursor is rivaled only by another serious safety
system degradation at Shearon Harris.  NRC analysts have not calculated a greater risk
at a reactor since 1991, when the NRC discovered that Shearon Harris had operated for
an entire year without a high-head safety injection system capable of cooling the reactor
core during an accident. 40

 + Signiﬁcant “Near Misses” since Chernobyl

22

Not only has the NRC oversight process failed to prevent declining performance from
threatening the public health and safety, the process gave the NRC a false sense of
assurance at Davis Besse.

According to the U.S. General Accounting Ofﬁce (GAO):

NRC also considered First Energy--Davis-Besse’s owner--a good performer, which
resulted in fewer NRC inspections and questions about plant conditions. NRC was
aware of the potential for cracked tubes and corrosion at plants like Davis-Besse but
did not view them as an immediate concern. Thus, NRC did not modify its inspections
to identify these conditions.41

Unfortunately, GAO also found that it wasn’t only NRC’s oversight of Davis Besse that
was ﬂawed.  GAO found that, “NRC’s process for deciding to allow Davis Besse to delay
its shutdown lacks credibility.” And that, “ the risk estimate NRC used to help decide
whether the plant should shut down was ﬂawed and underestimated the amount of risk
that Davis-Besse posed.” 42 The GAO concluded that even with the NRC underestimating
the risk at Davis Besse, the agency risk calculations were high enough that the reactor
should have been forced to shut down for inspections.

The NRC’s regulatory failure at Davis Besse reconﬁrms that adage that “its better to be
lucky than good.”  If the football sizes hole had not been discovered, the reactor vessel
would have failed during the next operating cycle. The NRC calculated that the Davis
Besse reactor vessel was within sixty days of failing and that the resulting accident would
have rivaled the core meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979.43

The Davis Besse “near miss” is also important because of what it revealed about those
that regulate the nuclear industry.  NRC senior management placed the economics of
the nuclear industry ahead of public health and safety.  According to the NRC’s Inspector
General report on Davis Besse, “(d)uring its review of the potentially hazardous condition
at Davis Besse, the NRC staff considered the ﬁnancial impact to the licensee of an
unscheduled plant shutdown.” 44

 + Signiﬁcant “Near Misses” since Chernobyl

23

Additionally, the NRC’s Inspector General (OIG) found that:

(w)ith respect to Davis-Besse, one NRR senior ofﬁcial noted to OIG that the staff
considered the large cost FENOC (First Energy Nuclear Operating Company) would
incur if ordered to shut down, particularly if no cracking was found upon inspection....
the NRR Director had spoken with the FENOC President and was aware of the
licensee’s ﬁnancial concerns pertaining to an unscheduled shutdown. According to
the memorandum, the FENOC President told the NRR Director that the impact of a
shutdown prior to February 2002 would be signiﬁcant, and that Davis-Besse would be
better positioned to shut down in February because of the availability of replacement
fuel. The FENOC President conﬁrmed to OIG that this discussion took place.45

The NRC’s Inspector General has also reported that, “NRC appears to have informally
established an unreasonably high burden of requiring absolute proof of a safety problem,
versus lack of reasonable assurance of maintaining public health and safety, before it will
act to shut down a power plant.” 46

The inability of the NRC oversight process to detect poor performance before it devolves
into a nuclear near miss should come as no surprise to the NRC commissioners.  The
NRC staff said as much when the Commission imposed the new regulatory oversight
scheme.

When the NRC ﬁrst instituted the revised reactor oversight process, the staff was
surveyed. The results, as reported in Inside NRC, should have given the Commission
cause for concern:

+  70% of those surveyed believed that the new process would not catch declining

performance “before a signiﬁcant reduction in safety margins.”

+  70% of NRC’s resident inspectors believed that the new process “may not identify

and halt degrading performance.”

+  79% of NRC staff either had no opinion or believed that the new performance
indicators did not provide an adequate indication of declining performance.

+  75% of the NRC staff thought that the nuclear industry and NEI had too much

inﬂuence and input into the new process.47

 + Signiﬁcant “Near Misses” since Chernobyl

24

According to the latest NRC analysis of signiﬁcant accident precursors, there is
no common denominator when it comes to these high-risk events. NRC reviewed,
”the nature, modes, causes, and systems affected by the precursors with CCDP of
10-3 revealed that the events in this group appear to exhibit no common (generic)
characteristics.” 48

The NRC staff’s report to the Commission is unable to draw any common themes
from the most significant precursors, the agency has determined that we can expect
these near misses with some regularity. According to the NRC’s latest analysis,
“ the occurrence rate of precursors with CCDP 1.0×10-3 based on this data is
approximately one event every 2 years, although there have been years in which two
such events occurred.” 49

However, it is important to note that the NRC’s review of signiﬁcant precursors from 1993
– 2000 found that 59 % of the cumulative core damage probability in the 1 in 1000 range
is not modeled in the current risk analyses. 50

According to the NRC report, risk assessments did not capture the “near misses”at Davis
Besse in 2002, Point Beach 1 & 2 in 2001, Cook 1 & 2 in 1999, Wolf Creek in 1994
and again in 1996, nor the 1996 revelation that the emergency core cooling system at
Haddam Neck would have been unable to perform its function, i.e. cool the reactor core,
for the entire life of the plant. 51

Since Chernobyl, the NRC has identiﬁed at least 49 “important precursors.”

Unfortunately, the NRC’s new oversight process has not proven itself capable of detecting
problems at many of these reactors before they resulted in dangerous conditions or
events. Greenpeace reviewed all of the historical assessments from the NRC’s revised
reactor oversight process for those reactors that experienced near misses since NRC
began the new process in 2000:

Davis Besse in Ohio

Point Beach 1 & 2 in Wisconsin

Hatch 1 in Georgia

Diablo Canyon 1 in California and

Indian Point 2 in New York

Only one of the reactors was on NRC’s radar prior to the “near miss.” 53

However, it’s hard to credit the NRC’s new process with capturing the accident precursor.
In February of 2000, Indian Point 2 ruptured a steam generator tube and released
radiation into the surrounding community.  When the NRC Inspector General reviewed
the Indian Point accident, the IG determined that NRC had missed opportunities to
prevent the accident by waiving inspections. 54

 + Important “Near Misses” since Chernobyl

27

More disturbing is the fact that, even after the NRC recognized events as precursors to
severe core damage accidents nothing changed. While the NRC’s oversight process,
documented the “near misses,” there was no change in the level of regulatory scrutiny
due to the important “near misses” at the Diablo Canyon 1 and Hatch 1 nuclear reactors.
The NRC’s color coded oversight process remained GREEN.

28

Not only did the oversight process fail to respond to an important precursor at Hatch
1 but the NRC’s original response to the event was to issue a non-cited violation, a
regulatory a slap on the wrist, for failure to accurately report the circumstances that
caused the repeated reactor shutdowns.  It was only after the owner of Hatch, Southern
Nuclear Operating Company, failed to bring the reactor back into compliance with NRC
regulations that the agency ﬁnally leveled a violation.57

Again, these blind spots in NRC’s oversight process should not come as a surprise to
the NRC commissioners.  The public, as well as the NRC’s own advisors on the Advisory
Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) have repeatedly pointed out that the oversight
process has been so manipulated by the industry that it fails to give the NRC an accurate
perspective of reactor performance.

In April 2000, the Commission asked the ACRS to review the new Reactor Oversight
Process. Speciﬁcally, the ACRS was asked to review the use of performance indicators
in the Reactor Oversight Process to ensure that they provide meaningful insight into
aspects of plant operation that are important to safety. The ACRS found that performance
indicator thresholds for initiating events and mitigating systems are not meaningful.  The
ACRS has pointed out to the NRC staff that:

it would take more than 20 reactor trips per year to effect the initiating event risk
category in a sufﬁcient  amount to cause a licensee to enter the red band.  Clearly,
20 trips in a year is far worse than industry performance has been for at least four
decades to my memory.58

 This may help explain why the oversight process failed to register a change in color and
recognize the signiﬁcance of the important precursors at Hatch and Diablo Canyon both
involved reactor trips.

However, it does not excuse the fact that the NRC’s new risk informed oversight process
does not capture and recognize some of the most important precursors to a meltdown.

 + Important “Near Misses” since Chernobyl

29

The graphic below shows how NRC’s risk informed oversight process is supposed to work.

59

If the NRC’s oversight process performed as advertised, the events at Hatch 1 and
Diablo Canyon 1 should have resulted in at least a white or a yellow ﬁnding from the
signiﬁcance determination process (SDP) of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process (ROP)
and an increase in regulatory oversight.  However, NRC’s oversight process failed to
acknowledge the severity of the events and saw nothing but green.

 + Additional “Near Misses” since Chernobyl

The NRC’s latest annual analysis of accident precursors reviewed the past decade of
events but fails to document any trends in these nuclear “near misses.”

62

 + Additional “Near Misses” since Chernobyl

35

However it is interesting to note that prior to imposition of the new oversight process in
2000, the NRC identiﬁed a statistically signiﬁcant declining trend in accident precursors.

Unfortunately the NRC’s annual reports to the Commission on the Accident Sequence
Precursor program do not address this increase in

the total number of precursors since 2000.  While it is not possible to attribute the
reversal of the declining trend of near misses to the new oversight process, it is worth
reiterating that 70% of the NRC staff did not believe the new oversight process would
catch declining performance “before a signiﬁcant reduction in safety margins.” 64

63

The accident precursors identiﬁed by the NRC since 2000 have proven that the staff was right.

✛  “Near Misses” & Questionable Containments

In the chart above, those reactors that were designed with the General Electric Mark
I & Mark II pressure suppression containments are designated as GE.  While the
Westinghouse reactors that use the Ice Condenser containments are designated as ICE.

While the NRC can have little conﬁdence that any containment could withstand a
meltdown, those General Electric and Westinghouse reactors that incorporate the
pressure suppression containment design with small volume containment are virtually
certain to release the radiation resulting from a meltdown.65

✛  The MYTH of CONTAINMENT

+ The MYTH of CONTAINMENT

38

 For a reactor accident to have Chernobyl like consequences a meltdown must be
accompanied by containment failure. Unfortunately the term “containment” belies the
facts.  The public interest community has long been aware that the containments around
many of the US reactors are more myth than reality.66

As early as 1971, government regulators knew that the public’s last line of defense against
the radiation, the reactor containment, was virtually worthless yet licensed the General
Electric (GE) and Westinghouse Ice Condenser reactors anyway.  When an Atomic
Energy Commission’s (AEC) staff member suggested that this type of containment
design be banned in the U.S. the AEC’s deputy director for technical review responded
that it “could well be the end of nuclear power. It would throw into question the continued
operation of licensed plants, could make unlicensable the GE and Westinghouse ice
condenser plants now in review and would generally create more turmoil than I can think
about.”67(See Appendix B.)

Of course the nuclear bureaucrats did not want to reveal the truth about the fallibility of
the nuclear reactors they had already licensed as “safe” and attempted to withhold the
information from the public.

+ The MYTH of CONTAINMENT

39

Only though the efforts of the Union of Concerned Scientists, their attorneys and those
at Public Citizen did the information eventually come to light under the Freedom of
Information Act.

In 1986 Harold Denton, former director of NRC’s Ofﬁce of Nuclear Reactor Regulation,
again acknowledged this vulnerability while speaking to utilities executives at Brookhaven
National Laboratory.  Denton noted that, according to NRC studies the GE Mark I
reactors had “something like a 90% probability of that containment failing.” 68

NRC’s revelations concerning the Westinghouse Ice condenser containments are equally
disturbing. Recent safety studies conducted by Sandia National Laboratories for the
NRC concluded that these Westinghouse reactors would be extremely vulnerable to
severe accidents, such as a station blackout; the loss of both off-site and on-site power.
Sandia’s calculations showed that the ice condenser containment building would offer
essentially no protection--the building would almost certainly rupture immediately after
the meltdown.69

+ The MYTH of CONTAINMENT

40

According to Kenneth Bergeron, who conducted the Sandia Labs analysis of the
Westinghouse containments:

I personally resisted pressure to whitewash the issues for four years...I think the IC
(Ice Condenser) report underestimates the safety issues substantially. Time and time
again, the project staff were asked to look into issues in greater detail if there seemed
a possibility that the details would reveal a rosier picture, and time and time again
other issues that might yield evidence of additional problems were glossed over.70

However, it’s not only the GE and Westinghouse designs that are more sieve than shield.
In a draft version of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s 1987 Reactor Risk Reference
Document released for public comment, the agency again acknowledged the inability
of the containment to protect the public during a meltdown. The draft report contained
this disturbing admission, “(i)n general, these data indicate that early containment failure
cannot be ruled out with high conﬁdence for any of the plants.” 71

Although this sentence was deleted from the ﬁnal version of the report, later studies
contained this admission, “(a)ll ﬁve major reactor containment types were found to be
subject to failure in such accidents, for which they were not designed.” 72

The chart below lists those reactors that use the GE Mark I and Mark II and the
Westinghouse Ice Condenser containments.73

Remarkably, the NRC and the nuclear industry seem to have either forgotten or failed
to learn their lessons on containment.  Former NRC Commissioner Forest Remick
admonished the industry on this point back in the 1990’s.  Remick stated that:

Right now the conceptual designs submitted to the NRC for review of the DOE-
supported modular high temperature gas reactor and the modular liquid metal reactor
do not include containment structures.... I am concerned that efforts to reduce cost
may be causing designers to forget the lessons learned.  Cost control is a legitimate
engineering effort, but it must not be at the expense of prudent and adequate
protection of public health and safety and the environment.77

While the containments on many U.S. reactors are questionable at best, that doesn’t
mean we should do away the notion of containing a nuclear accident all together.  Yet
that is precisely what the nuclear industry has done with some of the advanced nuclear
reactor designs.  According to the NRC Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards,

...in all three designs, absence of containment helps to make feasible one of the major
safety advantages, passive systems for removing decay heat.  In each case, the
reactor vessel surroundings are designed so that air from outside the plant will ﬂow by
natural buoyancy through the reactor vessel cavity and thereby remove decay heat.
This seems to be a highly effective heat transfer means if the reactor vessel and core
are intact.  If they are not, this ready supply of oxygen and access to the environment
might be a problem.   This seems to be a major safety trade-off.78

It remains to be seen whether the Commission, in its desire to license new reactors, will
ignore the lessons of Chernobyl and license reactors with either questionable or non-
existent containments.

✛  CONCLUSIONS

+ CONCLUSIONS

43

Greenpeace has documented nearly 200 “near misses” at U.S. reactors since the
Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Despite the claims of the nuclear industry and their allies at
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, an “American Chernobyl” is possible.

If any of these “near misses” had progressed to a meltdown the government has little
conﬁdence that any of the reactor containments could withstand the accident.  A reactor
meltdown followed by containment failure is an “American Chernobyl.”

Unfortunately, the NRC’s oversight process has repeatedly failed to identify those
reactors that needed additional regulatory attention before poor performance devolved
into a “near miss.”  Even more disturbing is the fact that the NRC’s oversight process may
not result in increased scrutiny even after the reactor experiences a “near miss.”

Greenpeace has documented over 50 “near misses” at reactors with questionable
containments.  If the “near miss” or accident precursor had progressed to a meltdown,
the containments on these reactors almost certainly would have failed, releasing radiation
into the environment and surrounding community.

As U.S. nuclear corporations contemplate building more nuclear reactors, it is important
that our government regulators remember Chernobyl and speak honestly and forthrightly
about the very real dangers posed by splitting atoms.   Nuclear reactors are by their very
nature inherently dangerous.  Each reactor has the potential to devastate the state or
region in which it operates.  Unless the nuclear industry and the government regulators
re-learn this lesson of Chernobyl more nuclear disasters are likely to follow.
