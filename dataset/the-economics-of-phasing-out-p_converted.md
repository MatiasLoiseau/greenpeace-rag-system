The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Executive Summary

Polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC or “vinyl,”
has become one of the most widely used plastics
today. We encounter PVC on a daily basis in
products ranging from toys, packaging, and lawn
furniture to water and sewer pipes, medical
equipment, and building materials.

PVC poses hazards to human health over the course
of its life cycle. PVC production exposes workers and
communities to vinyl chloride and other toxic
substances. PVC products such as medical equipment
and children’s toys can leach toxic additives during
their useful life. Vinyl building materials release
hydrochloric acid fumes if they catch fire, and
burning PVC creates byproducts including dioxin, a
potent carcinogen.

The health hazards associated with the production,
use, and disposal of PVC are, for the most part,
avoidable. Alternatives are available across the range
of PVC products. In some cases the alternatives are
no more expensive than PVC; in other cases there is a
small additional cost. Often there are good reasons to
expect the costs of alternatives to decline over time.

Vinyl today: a look at the market

PVC sales reached 14.4 billion pounds in the US and
Canada in 2002, or 46 pounds per person. Worldwide
production was around 59 billion pounds, or an
average of 9 pounds per person. With 5 percent of the
world’s population, the US and Canada consume 24
percent of the world’s PVC. The principal uses of
PVC in North America, in order of importance, are
pipes, construction materials, consumer goods,
packaging, and electrical products (such as wire and
cable insulation).

Three in-depth studies have estimated the costs of
phasing out PVC. The latest one, a 1997 study by
Environment Canada, based on a detailed analysis of
the cost of alternatives, suggests an average annual
cost of $0.55 per pound. If this estimate still applied
today, it would imply a total cost of $8 billion per
year, or $25 per person, to phase out PVC in the US
and Canada. Correction for one obviously dated
assumption in that study cuts the estimate in half, to
$4 billion total or $12 per person. However, there are
several reasons to expect that the costs of alternatives
will be still lower and will decline over time.

Factors favoring phaseout

Figures such as those from Environment Canada,
based on current market prices alone, overstate the
economic benefits of PVC. We explore four major
economic reasons why this is the case.

•
Life-cycle costs often favor alternatives. Some
of the alternatives have higher initial purchase prices
than PVC products, but are actually less expensive
over the useful life of the product. Commercial
flooring provides an example: among the flooring
options we examined, vinyl has the lowest installed
cost; but due to its shorter lifetime and higher
maintenance requirements, it has the highest life-
cycle cost. In such cases, rather than making a
decision based on initial costs alone, purchasers can
save money by comparing the full costs over the
product life cycle of buying, installing, using,
maintaining, and ultimately disposing of alternative
products.

Mass production reduces costs. Most products

•
are cheaper when they are produced in large
quantities; costs typically drop as production volumes
increase. Currently the advantages of mass
production favor PVC: many PVC products have
achieved huge volumes, making them look cheap
today. However, the alternatives to PVC could
likewise grow in volume in the future, making them
less expensive and more competitive than they are at
present.

PVC products endanger their users. The

•
harmful effects of PVC are sometimes felt by the
users of the product, as in the case of some PVC
medical supplies. In case of fire, vinyl building
products begin to smolder long before they burn,
releasing toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid, and
thereby threatening building occupants and
firefighters. For this reason, the International
Association of Firefighters supports efforts to reduce
PVC use.

Related hazards could occur with PVC-insulated
wiring, which was once standard for use in airplanes.
There is no proof that PVC insulation has ever caused
a plane crash, but some investigators have suggested
that there are grounds for concern about older planes
that are still flying with PVC-insulated wires.

2

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

•
Environmental protection costs are routinely
less than anticipated. Academic research has shown
that the actual costs of compliance with
environmental standards are often lower than the
predicted costs. The strict standard for workplace
exposure to vinyl chloride, the raw material for PVC
production, established in 1974 by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, led to profitable
innovation, not vast economic losses (as predicted by
industry when the standard was proposed). A recent
study of the costs of controlling chlorinated
pollutants confirms the pattern of advance
overestimation of environmental management costs.

Markets for alternatives

Because PVC is used in such a diverse range of
products, the nature of the alternatives and the likely
costs of a phaseout differ from one market to the
next. However, there are affordable alternatives in
every market we have examined. We discuss
alternatives to PVC in selected commercial and
institutional markets, including pipes, roofing, floor
coverings, and medical gloves, followed by a brief
look at residential siding and windows, the largest-
volume vinyl building products.

•
Pipes. Almost half of the PVC manufactured in
the US and Canada is used to make pipes and tubing,
a diverse category spanning several distinct end uses.
For municipal water and sewer pipes, PVC competes
with traditional materials including iron, concrete,
and vitrified clay, as well as with polyethylene (PE),
a less toxic plastic that has a growing share of the
market.  Sales of PE pipe (for all uses) have reached
about one billion pounds annually, compared to 6.5
billion pounds of PVC pipe. PE and traditional pipe
materials perform better than PVC in cold climates
and under high pressure; in addition, PE pipe is
virtually leak-free.  Factors like these are often
decisive; many municipalities and water companies
make decisions based on the desired physical
properties of pipes rather than the differences in
material prices.

Inside buildings, PVC has become common for
electrical conduits and particularly for the
“drain/waste/vent” pipes that carry water and waste
away. Due to concerns about fire hazards, some
building codes limit the use of plastic pipe in multi-
story buildings; even where it is allowed, the
additional requirements for fireproofing offset much
of the apparent cost advantage of PVC pipe.

A case study in Austin, Texas, found that using
copper, cast iron, and polyethylene plumbing rather

than PVC throughout a large new building increased
plumbing costs by 15 percent over all. Costs for
small-diameter pipes of several varieties show
modest cost differences; PVC has the lowest installed
cost in some but not all applications.

Roofing. In roofing, PVC competes primarily

•
with two less toxic synthetic materials, ethylene
propylene diene monomer (EPDM) and thermoplastic
elastomer polyolefin (TPO), in the market for single-
ply (single-layer), low-slope roofs. EPDM is by far
the market leader among the three, and PVC is third
in sales volume, slightly behind TPO. Advantages
claimed for PVC, particularly the fact that it is
available in white and therefore provides good
reflectivity in hot weather, are equally available with
alternative materials. PVC roofing also has a shorter
lifetime than most alternatives and presents special
technical problems, such as cracking and loss of
flexibility under some circumstances.

An analysis of construction costs in Austin, Texas
shows that both of the alternatives have lower
installed costs than PVC. This is true for a range of
membrane thicknesses and modes of installation.
These cost relationships are echoed by data from
Chicago and western Massachusetts, supporting the
view that the differences are not specific to one
region or climate.

Flooring. For commercial and institutional

•
flooring, PVC competes with a variety of materials,
ranging from natural cork and traditional linoleum to
economical synthetic rubber products, and new non-
chlorinated polymers that match the look of vinyl.
While vinyl flooring has the lowest first cost among
the 12 flooring products we examined, its relatively
short lifetime and high maintenance requirements
outweigh this advantage; it is the most expensive
option on a life-cycle basis. An analysis by the US
Navy of two flooring options for high-traffic areas on
its ships reached the same conclusion: on a life-cycle
basis vinyl was far more expensive than Stratica, a
durable new polymer. “Green building” efforts have
often used linoleum floors as a natural, non-toxic
alternative to vinyl, as seen in our case studies;
linoleum and other materials provide viable
alternatives to vinyl flooring under many
circumstances.

Gloves. A variety of disposable medical

•
supplies can be made from PVC. We examine the
case of medical gloves. Latex, which for a long time
was the standard material of choice for medical
examination and surgical gloves, has come to pose a
serious health hazard with rising rates of latex

Steps toward safer alternatives

Around the world and throughout the US, a variety of
community, state, and national government initiatives
have been undertaken to promote the use of safer
alternatives to PVC. Many health care institutions
have made statements on the need to reduce or
eliminate PVC use. The auto industry and other
major industries have taken numerous steps to
incorporate alternatives to PVC into their products. In
addition, countless innovative construction projects
have demonstrated the practicality of reducing or
eliminating PVC use. Examples discussed here
include a green building initiative carried out by a
volunteer group, GreenHOME, in partnership with
Habitat for Humanity; the Erie Ellington Homes in
the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston; the Sheraton
Rittenhouse Square Hotel in Philadelphia; and
innovative projects by religious communities.

allergies. In this context, health care institutions must
move to alternative glove materials; PVC and nitrile
are the principal candidates. While PVC gloves are
cheaper than nitrile gloves, their lower price is
counterbalanced by their lower durability. One study
found PVC gloves to have a 30% failure rate under
simulated use conditions, compared to 2% for both
latex and nitrile.  Correction for the failure rate
offsets one-third of the apparent cost advantage of
PVC over nitrile gloves, based on prices quoted to us
by a leading distributor. Kaiser Permanente, the
nation’s largest not-for-profit health care
organization, concluded from its internal review that
nitrile gloves were cost-competitive with PVC due to
their greater durability, and bought 43 million pairs
of nitrile gloves.

Siding and windows. Vinyl is now the most

•
common siding material for low- and moderate-
priced housing. However, wood shingles or
clapboard also offer viable siding alternatives, as do
fiber cement and simulated stucco. Disadvantages to
vinyl siding include poor resistance to temperature,
vulnerability to water damage, and chemical hazards
when it burns or smolders. Despite claims that vinyl
is “maintenance free,” vinyl can fade with time, can
require painting, and can warp. Fiber cement, a
relatively new product, is more durable than vinyl
and almost as low-maintenance; moreover, fiber
cement does not warp or burn.

Alternatives to PVC windows include wood,
fiberglass, and aluminum windows. Problems with
vinyl windows include sensitivity to high and low
temperatures, possible brittleness, and health hazards
in case of fire. Vinyl windows can be energy
efficient, but they can expand and contract, causing
the seal of the window to break; in this case, they
cannot be repaired, and must be replaced.

Employment effects of a PVC phaseout

There are 126,000 workers in PVC fabrication plants
in the US; we estimate that there are no more than
9,000 workers making vinyl chloride and PVC resin.
Replacing PVC with safer alternatives will change
some of these jobs: from fabricating PVC products to
fabricating the same products from other materials,
most often other plastics; or from making vinyl
chloride and PVC resin to making safer substitutes.
However, the alternatives are likely to require about
the same total employment as production of PVC. In
some cases, the same workers who currently make
PVC products will be employed making products
from PVC alternatives.

Introduction

Why Worry About PVC?

Polyvinyl chloride has grown from a little-known
material in the mid-twentieth century (used by the
Navy for waterproofing in World War II, for
example) to become one of the most widely used
plastics today.1 Thanks to low prices and aggressive
marketing, polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC or
“vinyl,” has become ubiquitous in our homes and
communities. We encounter PVC on a daily basis in
products ranging from children's toys, packaging, and
lawn furniture to water and sewer pipes, medical
equipment, and building materials.

Unfortunately, PVC poses severe hazards to human
health over the course of its life cycle. We review
these hazards only briefly here, as other sources
present them in detail.2

PVC production: Vinyl chloride, the building block
from which PVC resin is made, is a classified by the
National Toxicology Program as “known to be a
human carcinogen,” and has been similarly classified
as a human carcinogen by other US and international
agencies.3 PVC production exposes workers and
communities to vinyl chloride, 4 and many studies
have documented links between working in vinyl
chloride production facilities and increased likelihood
of developing diseases including angiosarcoma of the
liver, a rare form of liver cancer.5 The large numbers
of workers in PVC manufacturing facilities, where
vinyl chloride exposure is generally lower than in
vinyl chloride and PVC resin production, also have
an increased likelihood of developing angiosarcoma
of the liver.6 Vinyl chloride and PVC exposure are
also associated with certain non-cancer disorders.7

PVC use: For most applications, PVC resins are
mixed with additives such as stabilizers, plasticizers,
and fillers.8 These additives can leach out of, or
volatilize from, a PVC product during the product’s
useful life. For example, exposure to plasticizers can
occur when they volatilize from PVC products, such
as building materials; when they leach out of medical
equipment during use, exposing patients; and when
they leach from soft plastic toys.9 Phthalates, which
are used as plasticizers, may pose hazards to
development and reproduction,10 and have been
implicated in the development of respiratory
problems in children.11 Stabilizers that are used in
PVC and can leach out of PVC products include lead
and other heavy metals.

PVC disposal and accidental burning: When vinyl
building materials catch fire—or even smolder,
before igniting—they release acutely toxic fumes
such as hydrochloric acid.12 At the end of its life,
PVC releases toxic substances into the environment
when it is burned in an incinerator or rural trash
barrel, and can leach toxic stabilizers and plasticizers
when it is buried in a landfill. Dioxins, which
threaten human health at extraordinarily low
concentrations, are released when PVC is burned,
either intentionally or accidentally.13

In the face of these and related concerns, vinyl
advocates argue that the material offers not only low
prices but also amazing convenience. PVC promises
to provide “maintenance-free” building exteriors,
easily installed pipes and plumbing, low-cost
coverings for floors and walls, and all manner of
molded or flexible plastic objects. It is widely
believed that giving up PVC would impose a painful
burden on the economy.

Our principal finding is that this belief is untrue; PVC
does not offer enormous economic advantages over
all other materials. Alternatives providing equal or
better performance are available for almost every use
of PVC. In some cases, the costs of the alternative
materials are already comparable to PVC when costs
are measured over the useful life of the product. In
other cases, the alternatives are slightly more
expensive at present, but are likely to come down in
cost as their market share expands. The continued use
of PVC offers small short-term gains in some areas,
and none at all in others.

In this report, we explore the economics of phasing
out PVC. We begin by looking at the uses of PVC
today and reviewing past studies of the costs of
alternatives to PVC. We then offer four principles for
analysis of the alternatives, all of them challenging
the economic arguments for continued use of PVC:

•

•

•

Alternatives that have higher purchase prices,
or higher installed costs, than PVC may still be
cheaper on a full-cost accounting or life-cycle
cost basis.
Alternatives that look expensive when
produced in small batches today will become
cheaper when they are mass-produced.
The unique health and environmental damages
caused by PVC can endanger the users of a
product, as in the case of medical supplies.

5

•

Academic studies have shown that the costs of
environmental protection are routinely
overestimated in advance, and decline rapidly
after implementation.

We apply these principles in a discussion of
alternatives to PVC in major markets, including
detailed discussion of pipes, roofing, floor coverings,
and medical gloves, and a summary description of the
siding and windows markets. Following the analysis
of these markets, we examine the expected
employment effects of a PVC phaseout and then turn
to the steps that have already been taken toward
alternatives.

Vinyl Today: A Look at the Market

Sales of PVC grew rapidly in the 1990s, reaching
14.4 billion pounds in the US and Canada in 2002.14
This is equivalent to 46 pounds for every person in
the two countries. PVC sales are much lower in other
industrial countries: 31 pounds per person in Western

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Europe, and 25 pounds per person in Japan.
Worldwide production was 59 billion pounds (or
almost 27 million metric tons) in 2002, an average of
9 pounds per person. With 5 percent of the world’s
population, the US and Canada consume 24 percent
of the world’s PVC.

Data on the uses of PVC in the US and Canada for
1994, 1999, 2002, and forecasts for 2007, are shown
in Table 1. The 2002 figures are also shown
graphically in Figure 1. The principal uses of PVC, in
order of importance, are pipes, construction
materials, consumer goods, packaging, and electrical
products such as wire and cable. Pipes, siding,
windows, doors, and profiles (gutters, fences, decks,
etc.) together account for more than two-thirds of
PVC use, and are also the fastest-growing categories.
Many other uses of PVC are growing more slowly,
and a few actually declined in the recent economic
slowdown. Industry projections for 2007 assume that
the recession will end and growth will resume,
although at a slower pace than in the 1990s.

Costs of Replacing PVC: Three Studies

Three detailed studies, all published in the mid-
1990s, have estimated the costs of phasing out PVC.

•  The US-Canada International Joint

Commission (IJC) for the Great Lakes
examined the cost of phasing out PVC as
part of its 1993 “Strategy for Virtual
Elimination of Persistent Toxic
Substances.”15 The report was done for the
IJC by a Canadian consulting firm, Hickling
Corporation. In 1994, Hickling submitted an
expanded and revised version of its study.16
In response to the IJC, the Chlorine Institute
asked Charles River Associates (CRA), a
US consulting firm, to study the economic
benefits of chlorine and related chemicals,
including an analysis of PVC.17
In 1997, Environment Canada published a
study of options for replacing chlorine-based
products, including a detailed look at
alternatives to PVC.18

•

•

These are the most extensive and comprehensive
studies on the subject, although by now they are
somewhat dated. Moreover, as we will explain, their
cost estimates fail to incorporate several important
factors that favor the adoption of alternatives. All
three found PVC to be only modestly cheaper than
the alternatives.

Each of the studies examined many specific uses of
PVC, comparing the prices for PVC products to their
PVC-free alternatives. Environment Canada created

two sets of price comparisons: a low case looking at
the least expensive available alternatives, and a high
case based on higher-priced alternative products that
were in use in Canada.

Table 2 compares the results of the studies. For each
study it shows the cost increase that would result
from switching to PVC-free alternatives, expressed in
dollars per pound of PVC (updated to 2002 prices).
Cost estimates are shown separately for pipes and for
all other products. Since pipes represent about half of
all PVC use, the pipe and non-pipe figures in Table 2
are averaged to obtain a rough estimate of the total
cost of replacing PVC.

Table 2 shows a remarkable degree of agreement
between the two earlier studies. With one minor
adjustment to the Hickling data (incorporated in
Table 2), the CRA and Hickling studies yield nearly
identical average costs of replacing PVC—$1.07 to
$1.15 per pound.19 The Environment Canada low
case had an average cost of about half this much, due
to its much lower estimate for pipe costs. For the
non-pipe uses of PVC, there is fairly close agreement

7

between CRA, Hickling, and the Environment
Canada low case ($0.87 to $1.10 per pound).

The Environment Canada study, the most recent of
the three, examined 14 product categories that
accounted for about 90 percent of PVC use in
Canada. In most categories, the study compared costs
for PVC products, a common lower-priced

alternative, and a common higher-priced alternative
(not necessarily the highest or lowest prices on the
market). Published in 1997, the study is based on
prices and conditions in Canada and construction
costs for the Toronto area in 1993. Nine of the 14
product categories were in the areas of pipes and
construction materials, as shown in Table 3.

1993 Canadian prices converted to US dollars and adjusted for US inflation through 2002.

Separate low- and high-cost alternatives were not estimated for industrial pipe or for wire and cable.

Alternative materials reflect those in use in Canada in 1993, except polyolefin flooring (a polyethylene/polypropylene
combination). This product was introduced in Germany in 1996; Environment Canada's low-cost flooring alternative
uses the German price.

For pipes, the low-cost alternative to PVC was in
each case another plastic, usually high-density
polyethylene (HDPE). Traditional pipe materials
such as iron, concrete, and copper provided slightly
higher-cost alternatives. However, as shown in Table
3, the estimated price per pound of PVC replaced was
small for all pipe applications and was actually
negative (meaning the alternatives cost less than
PVC) for low-cost drain and industrial applications.

The story is more complex for construction materials,
where the available options are more diverse and are
changing more rapidly than with pipes. For example,
Environment Canada’s low-cost siding alternative,
aluminum siding, has all but disappeared from the
market today. (Newer alternatives will be discussed
below.) Flooring was the area with by far the highest
cost; although it represented only 3 percent of all
PVC use in Canada in 1993, it accounted for over
half of the cost of the entire low-cost PVC
replacement scenario. New flooring products have
continued to appear, and some of the best alternatives
today were not available at the time of the study.

Over all, the added costs of non-vinyl construction
materials were modest: according to Environment
Canada, the use of non-PVC alternatives for all four
applications—siding, windows, flooring, and wire
and cable—would have increased the cost of new
residential construction by 0.4 percent in the low
case, or 2.4 percent in the high case.

If these estimates applied today, what would they
imply for the costs of phasing out PVC? As
mentioned above, PVC consumption in 2002 was
about 14.4 billion pounds for the US and Canada as a
whole, or 46 pounds per person. The Environment
Canada low case, the most recent and detailed cost
analysis, suggests an average cost increase of $0.55
per pound from switching to alternatives (see Table
2). If this figure still applied, the total cost for
replacing all PVC use would be about $8 billion a
year for the US and Canada as a whole, or $25 per
person.

While it is based on the best available published
figures, this calculation has limited applicability

today. Recall that over half of Environment Canada’s
total cost of alternatives came from a very high
estimate for the cost of replacing vinyl flooring. As
we will see, better alternatives are available today,
with life-cycle costs lower than vinyl flooring.
Remove the inflated flooring cost, and Environment

Canada’s estimate shrinks to less than $4 billion total,
or $12 per person. And this is not the only factor
tending to lower the cost of alternatives. In the
section that follows, we examine several reasons why
the cost of a phaseout will probably be even lower
than suggested by current prices.

9

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Factors Favoring Phaseout

Although the Environment Canada-based estimates
of the costs of a phaseout are still too high, it is worth
noting that they are not enormous compared to the
North American economy. Affordable housing would
not suddenly become unaffordable if, as Environment
Canada estimated, replacing the leading uses of vinyl
were to raise new residential construction costs by
0.4 percent (and this figure included the inflated
flooring cost). Even $8 billion is less than 0.1 percent
of the gross domestic product of the US and Canada;
with the correction for flooring, the revised $4 billion
cost is $12 per capita, less than 0.05 percent of our
collective incomes. A loss of this amount, spread
across the entire economy, would not cause a
noticeable average change in our lifestyles and
consumption levels.

Moreover, the estimated cost differences, as
described above, overstate the economic benefits of
PVC. There are four economic arguments for
elimination of PVC, despite its modest cost
advantage in some settings at current prices.

Life-Cycle Costs Often Favor Alternatives

Some of the alternatives have higher initial purchase
prices than PVC products, but are actually less
expensive over the useful life of the product. The
three studies described above compared purchase
prices, or in some cases installed costs, of PVC and
alternatives. Such comparisons may give a
misleading impression about the total cost of owning,
using, and caring for the products in question.

The total cost over a product’s life cycle is the cost
that ultimately matters to the user. For example,
paper plates are much cheaper than ceramic dinner
plates, but households, restaurants, and institutional
food services often conclude that it is cheaper in the
long run to buy, wash, and reuse ceramic plates,
rather than continually buying and discarding paper
plates.

The concept of life-cycle costs is no more
complicated than this familiar example. Rather than
making a decision based on initial costs alone, it is
important to compare the full costs, over a period of
time, of buying, installing, using, maintaining, and
ultimately disposing of alternative products. If a
ceramic plate is used daily and is expected to last for
a year, then the correct comparison would be the cost

of 1 purchase, 365 washings, and 1 disposal versus
the cost of buying and disposing of 365 paper
plates.20 As in this case, a more expensive initial
purchase may be cheaper in the long run if it lasts
longer and/or requires less maintenance or fewer
repairs.

For some building materials, such as flooring,
maintenance and repair costs can be the largest costs
of the product life cycle. In such cases, the lowest-
maintenance product is often the cheapest on a life-
cycle basis, regardless of whether it has the lowest
purchase price. As we will see in a later section, vinyl
is the cheapest option for commercial and
institutional flooring on a first-cost basis but the most
expensive option on a life-cycle basis. When life-
cycle costs are taken into account, vinyl flooring
loses out to higher-priced but longer-lasting and more
easily maintained alternatives.

The discussion of life-cycle costs should not be
confused with academic studies known as “life-cycle
analyses” (LCAs). A life-cycle cost comparison looks
at the costs to the user of a product from purchase
through disposal. Life-cycle analysis, on the other
hand, attempts to account for all the environmental
impacts of a given product, from production through
use and disposal. Depending on the data categories
that are included, LCAs may provide useful
environmental information, but they are not a
substitute for a life-cycle cost comparison. Note that
life-cycle costs do not directly depend on the
environmental impacts included in a LCA; rather,
life-cycle costs reflect durability and ease of
maintenance, as well as initial costs.

Surprisingly, some LCAs have given PVC relatively
good ratings. However, these LCAs often omit the
highly toxic and carcinogenic emissions that are the
most serious problems associated with PVC.21 LCAs
that include toxic emissions do identify PVC as an
undesirable material. The Tellus Institute Packaging
Study, an early LCA that evaluated common
packaging materials primarily on the basis of life-
cycle toxicity, found that PVC was 10 to 12 times
worse than other common plastics (which include
some of the leading alternatives to PVC). If the
Tellus study had used the Vinyl Institute’s own
estimates of emissions, published at about the same
time, instead of the best available public data sources,
it would have found that PVC was “only” four times
as bad as other plastics.22

Mass Production Reduces Costs

Mass production makes everything cheaper. Many
PVC products have been produced in huge volumes,
making them look cheap today; the production of
PVC alternatives could just as easily grow in volume
in the future, making them less expensive and more
competitive than they are at present. There are two
related effects at work here, known as “economies of
scale” and “learning curves.”

Economies of scale refer to the fact that production
costs per unit are often lower when goods are
produced in larger batches. There are several reasons
why it is cheaper for a big factory to produce large
amounts of a single product, compared to smaller
plants producing lesser quantities of the same good.
Some processes are physically more efficient when
performed on a larger scale; a bigger boiler or
furnace simply costs less to operate, per unit of heat
output, than a small one. In general, a larger scale of
production means that more machinery, automation,
and standardized procedures can be applied. A
company that sells a few hundred plastic objects of a
particular shape each year may have workers make
them almost by hand, using only basic tools and
equipment. A company that sells a few million a year
will invest in molding and stamping machines,
assembly lines, etc., allowing much faster, labor-
saving, lower-cost production.

Learning curves describe the common pattern in
which costs decline over time as an industry gains
experience with a production process. This is often
combined with economies of scale—as industry gains
experience, factories also tend to get bigger—but
learning curves are possible even if factory sizes do
not change. Whenever a new process is introduced, it
takes a while to debug it; hence the common,
informal advice to avoid version 1.0 of any new
software package. Much the same is true for
manufacturing. Over time, the bugs are worked out,
shortcuts and process improvements are developed,
and maintenance procedures and schedules are
improved. As a result, costs go down. This
phenomenon was first documented in the aircraft
industry in the 1930s and has been observed in
industries ranging from shipbuilding to wind turbines
and photovoltaic cells.23 A common estimate is that
when an industry’s cumulative production (the total
from the beginning of the industry to the present)
doubles, the cost per unit drops by 10 percent to 30
percent. In one classic example, a study found that
the Ford Model T dropped in price by 15 percent for

every doubling of cumulative production from 1909
to 1923.24

The combined effects of economies of scale and
learning curves can be seen in the evolution of many
consumer electronics products. Cell phones, CD
players, DVD players, digital cameras, flat screen
computer monitors, and numerous other products
started out as expensive and esoteric luxuries and
then dropped rapidly in price as the market expanded.

At a certain point, the fact that some people are using
a new product means that other people will begin to
use it too. For example, if many people have begun to
use a new computer program, other people will adopt
it simply in order to have a system compatible with
that of their colleagues. Conversely, it might be
inconvenient to be the only person in a city with an
unusual car model, because repairs would be
expensive and parts would be hard to find. Thus, for
a new technology, the fact that some people have
already adopted it eventually becomes a strong
argument for further adoptions. By pushing up
demand, this pattern creates a snowballing effect that
lowers prices and tends to “lock in” the advantage of
the product that currently leads the market.25

Thus, when a product sells for a relatively low price
and is used widely, we cannot assume that it is used
widely simply because it is cheap. It may, instead, be
cheap because it is used widely.

PVC has benefited from mass production in many
markets. PVC products have been used for decades,
have achieved large sales volume, and thus are mass-
produced at low cost. The learning curve effect
appears to have been particularly steep for PVC, with
every doubling of production associated with a 30
percent to 40 percent drop in price in the 1950s and
1960s.26 A history of the industry describes a steady
stream of process innovations and improvements in
production technology in these early years, along
with rapid increases in the size of the newest and
most efficient plants; these factors undoubtedly drove
the price downward.27

Many of the less toxic alternatives are not yet firmly
established in the market; they do not currently enjoy
economies of scale and learning curve advantages
comparable to those enjoyed by PVC. In some cases,
less toxic alternatives that were once popular may
have benefited from economies of scale in the past
but have been pushed aside by vinyl and are now
produced in relatively small quantities. Linoleum
flooring and aluminum siding are examples of this
pattern. Analyses of the long-run costs of a PVC-free

11

future should look beyond the current price of
alternative products to their (likely lower) future
price as they become widely adopted and mass-
produced.

PVC Products Can Be Dangerous to Users

Often the harmful effects of PVC emerge during the
intended use of the product. For example, flexible
PVC products used in health care, such as IV bags
and tubes, contain phthalates—plasticizers that can
leach out of the products during use, posing hazards
to patients.28 The US Food and Drug Administration
has issued an advisory, for example, recommending
measures to reduce patients’ exposure to the
phthalate Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) in
medical devices.29 Phthalates are also used in some
flexible PVC toys, including toys that young children
are likely to put in their mouths. In 1999, the
European Commission adopted an emergency ban on
certain phthalate-containing PVC toys and other
products, such as teething rings, intended for children
to put in their mouths. This ban has been renewed
repeatedly, pending development of permanent
regulations. Some, though not all, US manufacturers
have voluntarily stopped production of PVC toys
containing phthalates.30 (The  US Consumer Product
Safety Commission has denied petitions to ban PVC
in toys for young children or to issue an advisory
about hazards associated with these toys.31)

Additional problems occur when PVC is exposed,
intentionally or otherwise, to heat. In case of fire,
vinyl building products release large quantities of
hydrochloric acid, and smaller quantities of many
other toxins, threatening building occupants and
neighbors as well as firefighters. For this reason,
some firefighter associations are working to educate
the public about the hazards of PVC and are
supporting municipal and state level policies to
reduce PVC use. The International Association of
Fire Fighters points out that 165 people died in the
Beverly Hills Supper Club Fire of 1977, and 85
people in the MGM Grand Hotel Fire in Las Vegas in
1980—almost all of whom, according to the
firefighters, were killed by inhalation of toxic fumes
and gases, not by heat, flames, or carbon dioxide. A
likely culprit is the hydrochloric acid created by the
decomposition of PVC used in wiring and other
building materials.32 Medical researchers have found
elevated levels of long-term respiratory and other
health problems in firefighters who put out fires
involving large quantities of PVC and have identified
hydrochloric acid—acting alone or in combination

with carbon monoxide and soot—as the probable
cause of the damages.33

PVC is often advertised as “fire resistant,” meaning
that a fairly high temperature is required to start it
burning. However, PVC starts to smolder and release
toxic fumes such as hydrochloric acid at a lower
temperature, long before it ignites. If PVC is
gradually warmed, more than half of its weight is
given off as fumes before it gets hot enough to burst
into flames.34 The hydrochloric acid released by
burning PVC is potentially lethal to people caught in
a burning building; other products of PVC
combustion, such as dioxin, exert their health effects
more slowly and are spread across a larger
population.

Related hazards occur with PVC-insulated wiring,
which was once standard for use in airplanes. There
is no proof that PVC insulation has ever caused a
plane crash, but some investigators have suggested
that there are grounds for concern about older planes
that still contain PVC-insulated wires. Full-sized
modern airplanes contain 100 or more miles of
wiring. The insulation on this wiring is critical to air
safety: defects in the insulation could allow short
circuits and sparks, potentially setting off a fire or
explosion. A possible example is ValuJet Flight 592,
a DC-9 that crashed in 1996, killing all 110 people on
board. Although the flight crew reported an electrical
power failure moments before the aircraft crashed,
many reports instead focused on the possibility that
oxygen tanks on board caused the crash. Aviation
Today said in a special report on this and another
accident,

The ValuJet Flight 592 accident aircraft was
rigged with a type of wire insulation, PVC, that
will not pass the FAA’s current flame test.…
Among PVC wire's unacceptable properties, its
burning insulation creates copious amounts of
smoke, and the insulation can turn to
hydrochloric acid when exposed to moisture. It is
found on all DC-9s built through 1975. In
addition, the vast majority of 727s…were built
with PVC wire. According to an anonymous
telephone call to investigators from a self-
described company maintenance technician three
days after the ValuJet crash, the accident aircraft
"was continually having electrical
problems...circuit breakers and wiring were
shorting out..."35

Use of PVC wiring is now prohibited on new planes,
since PVC insulation failed Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) flammability tests in 1972.36

12

and the bans on the toxic pesticides DDT and
chlordane/heptachlor.42

There are at least three reasons for this repeatedly
lighter-than-expected burden. First, economies of
scale and learning curve effects are usually not built
into prospective cost estimates, but often arise in the
production of pollution control devices and cleaner
alternative materials. Second, as with vinyl chloride,
regulation may stimulate innovation and lead to the
introduction of new, more efficient technologies.
Finally, overestimation of costs may at times be a
bargaining tactic for industry in arguing against
environmental protection.

While many of the analyses cited here refer to
regulations, often involving traditional end-of-pipe
pollution controls, exactly the same factors are at
work in the case of clean production alternatives:
economies of scale and learning curves will be
important, industry will develop new technologies to
ease the transition, and the costs of the transition to
clean production may be exaggerated in advance for
rhetorical or bargaining purposes.

The best-known claims of extraordinary costs
imposed by environmental policy do not stand up to
careful examination; they turn out to be based on a
series of errors and misinterpretations.43 This has
important implications for employment and other
economic impacts. Despite rhetorical claims to the
contrary, environmental protection has almost never
caused noticeable numbers of job losses.44 Moreover,
the critics often forget that environmental initiatives
create jobs, many of them skilled blue-collar jobs.
The phaseout of PVC is a case in point; the
alternatives to PVC are guaranteed to require the
efforts of industrial and construction workers. The
possible employment implications of a PVC phaseout
are examined in a later section of this report.

But as Aviation Today noted, many older airplanes
that are still flying contain PVC-coated wiring; the
FAA never banned its use.37 The US Air Force
discontinued installation of PVC in 1977, although
replacing all of the existing wiring at once was too
expensive; the schedule for gradual replacement of
wiring in some Air Force planes stretches out until
2015.38 Meanwhile, the potential hazards of older
planes continue: there have been at least nine
instances of in-flight electrical fires in DC-9 aircraft
since 1983, three of which occurred after the ValuJet
crash.39

In these and similar cases, PVC is an inferior product
precisely because of its health and environmental
hazards, for those who use it as well as those who
make it.

Environmental Protection Costs Less Than
Anticipated

The costs of environmental protection are often
overestimated in advance. One of the classic
examples of this trend actually occurred in PVC
production. A strict standard for workplace exposure
to vinyl chloride (the raw material from which PVC
is made) was established in 1974 by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), following
recognition of the likely carcinogenicity of vinyl
chloride. Consultants to OSHA estimated the costs of
reducing vinyl chloride exposure at around $1 billion;
industry estimates were even higher. Actual costs
turned out to be around a quarter of OSHA’s
estimate, since industry quickly developed new, cost-
effective technologies to comply with the
regulation.40

Similar patterns have been found for many
environmental standards. One study found that
compliance costs for environmental regulations were
overestimated in advance in 11 out of 12 cases.
Another study found that advance cost estimates for
environmental compliance turned out to be more than
25 percent too high in 14 out of 28 cases, while they
were more than 25 percent too low in only 3 of the 28
cases.41 A review of this literature for Environment
Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Energy, Science
and Technology, focusing specifically on the costs of
controlling chlorinated substances, confirmed that
overestimation of regulatory costs is more common
than underestimation. Among the cases where it
found serious overestimation of US regulatory costs
were the advance predictions of compliance costs for
the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting substances

Markets for Alternatives

Because the uses of PVC are so diverse, the
alternatives are likewise varied. The next five
sections look at specific markets for PVC, exploring
the available alternatives, the different properties that
make alternatives more or less attractive, and the
costs of replacing PVC with safer products. The first
three markets involve products used in commercial

and institutional construction: pipes, roofing, and
flooring.45 The fourth examines medical supplies,
particularly gloves. Finally, we take a brief look at
the fast-growing residential construction uses of vinyl
in siding and windows.

Alternatives to PVC, I: Pipes 46

Much of the PVC used is invisible to most of us; it is
usually buried underground—or under the sink or
behind the walls. But visible or not, modern life
involves a lot of pipes. Some estimates suggest that
municipal water and sewer systems will acquire $8
billion of pipes annually for the next 20 years. In
addition, large quantities of pipes will be installed to
meet residential, commercial, industrial, and
agricultural needs. Many of these pipes will be made
of PVC, providing by far the most important market
for vinyl. Pipes and pipe fittings make up almost half
of PVC use, as seen in Table 1.

 PVC pipes have been in use for at least 30 years and
have become standard in some applications, such as
the “drain/waste/vent” (DWV) tubing that carries
wastewater away from kitchens and bathrooms. They
have also gained a large share of the market for
small-diameter municipal water and sewer pipes and
for electrical conduits. According to industry
estimates, on a lineal basis PVC accounts for more
than 70 percent of all water and sewer pipes now
being installed in the US.47

PVC pipes are competing both with traditional pipe
materials—copper, iron, concrete, and vitrified
clay—and with polyethylene (PE) and other plastic
pipes. Among other plastics, acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene (ABS) is sometimes used for drain pipes;
however, PE is by far the most important plastic pipe
material after PVC. The different pipe materials have
contrasting strengths and weaknesses.48

•  The traditional materials are heavier and, for
large-diameter pipes, may be harder to
install and repair. However, they are strong
under extremes of pressure and temperature.
Copper plumbing remains the standard for
hot and cold water in most buildings. Iron
water and sewer pipes may corrode in acidic

soil; they are sometimes coated with tar to
combat corrosion.

•  PVC is lightweight and lower priced than
some alternatives and requires less skill to
install and repair. However, PVC is weaker
under high pressure and becomes brittle at
below-freezing temperatures. For hot water
pipes, a more expensive, modified form,
chlorinated PVC (CPVC), must be used.
•  PE pipes offer a lightweight alternative with
greater strength under pressure, as well as
stronger, more leak-proof joints and the
ability to withstand temperatures well below
freezing. For hot water pipes, a more
expensive, modified form, cross-linked
polyethylene (XLPE, marketed as PEX),
must be used.

In view of its emerging role as an alternative to PVC
pipes, we begin with an examination of the PE pipe
industry. We then discuss the two major market
segments: municipal water and sewer pipes and
plumbing within buildings, including a detailed look
at a recently constructed building that specified PVC-
free plumbing. We conclude with price comparisons
for several common plumbing jobs with and without
PVC.

Polyethylene Pipe49

PE pipes are one of the most important alternatives to
PVC. PE is the only other leading material to
approach PVC in both weight and ease of
installation; while some equipment is needed to
install PE pipes, small-scale pipe-welding machines
are becoming available for homeowner or small
contractor use. Moreover, PE has important
advantages over PVC, such as greater strength under
pressure and under low temperatures, and lower rates
of leaks and breakage. Production of polyethylene,
although not pollution-free, is far less toxic than

14

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

production of PVC; most of the toxic effects of the
PVC life cycle involve chlorinated emissions, and PE
does not contain chlorine.

PEX (cross-linked polyethylene) is suitable for hot
and cold water and, because of its flexibility, can
easily be bent around corners without a coupling or
fitting, reducing labor time and the potential for leaks
and system failures that tend to occur at joints in
fittings. Because of its inherent flexibility, it has high
tolerance for expansion and contraction, thus making
it burst resistant.

Sales of PE pipe in the US and Canada, as estimated
by the Plastics Pipe Institute, have grown rapidly,
doubling in just a few years in the late 1990s.50 PE
pipe sales for 2000 and 2001 are shown in Table 4.
The total reached 1.4 billion pounds in 2000, before
dropping back to a little over 1.0 billion pounds as
the economy slumped in 2001. For comparison, PVC
pipe sales are around 6.5 billion pounds a year, as
shown in Table 1.

Small declines in PE pipe sales occurred in many
areas in 2001, reflecting the economic slowdown and
reduced pace of construction. The largest decline
occurred in conduits, which represented one-third of
all PE pipe sold in 2000. PE conduits were widely
used in the “dot-com” economy with its many cable
and conduit needs; this market suffered an abrupt
downturn beginning in 2001.

Substantial quantities of PE pipe are used in areas
that do not compete with PVC, such as gas
distribution and oil and gas production. Water and
sewer pipes, which are areas of direct competition
between the two plastics, are among the top uses for
PVC, but represent only a fraction of the PE pipe
market.

Some companies produce both PE and PVC pipe,
giving them an additional motive to avoid
competition between rival plastics. For example, J-M
Manufacturing, the world’s largest PVC pipe
manufacturer, recently acquired Quail, an Arkansas-
based manufacturer of PE piping. J-M acknowledges
an increased demand for PE, attributable in part to
the appeal of leak-free joints as well as contractors’
increased familiarity and ability to work with the
material.51 They also are projecting increased market
demand for PE in the water/sewer markets, in
addition to the strong hold that PE currently has in
the gas market.

PE pipe is newer to the market and hence less
familiar to plumbers, contractors, and municipal
public works departments, than PVC and traditional
pipe materials. The American Water Works
Association first gave its approval for the use of
small-diameter PE water pipes in 1978, and for larger
diameters only in 1990. PE plumbing has also been
approved by the National Sanitation Foundation.

Reluctance to embrace new materials, including
CPVC, PEX, and PE, especially in large commercial
projects, results in part from memories of the failure
of an earlier “new” pipe material, polybutylene (PB).
Introduced in the late 1970s, PB pipe quickly gained
a reputation for frequent leaks. However, it continued
to be sold through the 1980s and early 1990s because
its ease of installation allowed savings of hundreds of
dollars per home. A class action suit against Shell,
the largest manufacturer of PB pipe, Cox v. Shell,
was settled in 1995 for $950 million, one of the
largest settlements in US history.52 Today, numerous
companies offer PB pipe removal services.

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Water and Sewer Pipes

PVC has been very successful in the market for
small-diameter municipal water and sewer pipes.
Some observers claim that PVC pipe installation
minimizes municipal labor and equipment costs and
also minimizes the length of time that streets are
blocked for pipe installation. For larger diameter
main pipes, where strength under pressure is of great
concern, the traditional materials have retained a
substantial share of the market, and PE is a stronger
contender than PVC. Strength under extreme
temperatures is more important in northern areas
where the ground often freezes; accordingly, PVC
has made greater inroads in southern, frost-free parts
of the country.

Not everyone, however, has opted for PVC. In recent
years, some municipal water and sewer systems have
chosen PE instead of PVC. Performance issues, not
cost, appear to drive the decision. The Indianapolis
Water Company (IWC) has switched to PE because it
reduces leaks at the joints and bends in the pipes and
because a new installation technique (which works
only with PE) minimizes excavation and disruption.
IWC has now installed more than 30 miles of PE pipe
of diameters larger than 20 inches.53

IWC is a subsidiary of United Water Company, a
large private company that operates privatized water
systems in many areas. United Water affiliates in
New Jersey and New York also choose to avoid PVC
in order to minimize leaks, since they operate in
congested urban areas where it is expensive and
difficult to excavate and repair underground pipes.
Local building codes and conditions require very
strong pipes, and United Water uses iron and cement
pipes in New York and New Jersey; PVC is not
durable enough for use under these conditions.
However, United Water does use some PVC in
Florida, where there is less concern about damage to
pipes due to frost. 54

California communities that have switched to PE or
other non-PVC pipes for some applications include
the Contra Costa Public Works Department, which
uses PE pipes for storm drains; they view PE as
superior to concrete or metal pipe on the basis of its
low weight, ease of installation, low cost, and
reduced level of leaks at the joints. The Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power has used PE pipes to
replace old water mains after major breaks, because it
is the material that minimizes leaks.

PE pipe producers have described additional case
studies of adoption of PE pipe for water distribution

systems in Palermo, Italy, and in Toronto, as well as
in smaller communities throughout the US.55 In these
cases, PE was selected for characteristics including
resistance to earthquakes and freezing, minimal
damage to sensitive environments (the flexibility of
PE allows less invasive drilling techniques for laying
pipe), and the long-term integrity of its heat-fused
joints.

Municipal agencies and decision-makers rarely view
the price of the pipes themselves as the most
important factor in choosing water and sewer pipes.
A representative of the Boston Water and Sewer
Commission emphasized this point, stating that it
costs so much to dig up the streets and install the
pipes that the price of the pipe itself is irrelevant to
the city’s decision. Boston uses the pipe material that
the agency considers appropriate to each job: ductile
iron for water mains; copper for house services;
ductile iron or reinforced concrete for large diameter
sewer pipes; and PVC for small diameter sewer
pipes. PVC was chosen for the smaller sewer pipes
on the basis of its light weight and ease of
connection.56

PVC has also been adopted for other low-pressure,
low-temperature-stress applications such as irrigation
pipes, culverts, drain pipes, and some industrial
pipes. However, high-pressure applications, such as
gas pipelines, cannot use PVC; instead, PE pipe has a
major share of these markets.

If hydrogen becomes an important fuel in the future,
as the Bush administration and others have
sometimes suggested, a system of non-PVC pipes
will be needed to transport it: hydrogen can diffuse
out through the walls of PVC pipes, due to the porous
molecular structure of the PVC polymer.  (PE,
although not as porous as PVC, apparently is also
unsuitable for hydrogen pipelines.)57

In short, despite PVC’s continuing strength in this
major market, there are other materials that play an
important role, and numerous municipal customers
who have decided to rely on alternatives to PVC for
some or all of their pipe needs.

PVC Plumbing and Conduits: Pro and Con

Different considerations arise in plumbing, as well as
conduits for wire and cable, within buildings. For do-
it-yourself plumbing, sections of small-diameter PVC
pipe, manufactured in 10-foot or 20-foot lengths, are
easy to cut to the desired length and join together
with pipe cement (although some pipe cement
products used in home plumbing are themselves

16

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

toxic58). However, when plumbing is installed by
skilled workers, PVC loses this advantage: it requires
more joints, and time must be spent waiting for
cemented joints to dry before testing and using the
pipes, in contrast to alternatives with fewer, but
stronger, welded joints.

For electrical conduits, PVC competes with steel;
steel is more expensive and harder to bend and
install, but is often required by building codes for its
much greater fire resistance. PVC is of course more
flammable than steel, but it is also less flammable
than other plastics. For conduits where fire resistance
is less of a concern, such as optical fiber and
computer network cables, PE has been widely
adopted.

Outstanding concerns regarding fire hazards have
driven building codes in some areas, such as the city
of Chicago, to exclude all plastic piping, including
PVC and CPVC, from all commercial building
applications. Chicago also prohibits plastic pipe in all
residential structures three stories and above. New
York State has similar legislation, banning plastic
pipe, including PVC, from all commercial buildings
and from residential buildings over six stories in
height, at least through 2004. Industry critics attack
such measures as make-work regulations that
needlessly drive up construction costs in order to
protect union jobs. Unions defend them as safety
measures, citing the health hazards of PVC fires.59

Both the Chicago and the New York State standards
apply to all plastic pipes, not just PVC. Some
supporters of these standards have argued that all
plastic pipes are flammable and will ignite at lower
temperatures than other building materials. This
remains a controversial view; many critics have
rejected the idea that the use of plastic pipes affects
the risk of fire.60

Even where PVC pipe is allowed by building codes,
concerns about fire prevention may raise its effective
cost. Based on experience in the design of an eight-
story residential assisted living facility in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, engineering consultant John
Rattenbury concludes that the cost advantage of PVC
over cast iron plumbing is largely illusory. Although
the price per foot for sanitary and storm drains
appears to be at least three times as high for cast iron
pipes as for PVC, the building code requires
firestopping protection every time PVC passes
through a wall, plus thermal expansion joints on PVC
pipes. Iron is completely fireproof and has a much
lower coefficient of thermal expansion, so the
requirements are much less taxing for iron pipes.

These and other difficulties make installation in a
multi-story building far more expensive with PVC,
offsetting most of the apparent cost advantage. In
addition, Rattenbury observes that cast iron drain
pipes are much quieter.61

Case Study: Building Without PVC Pipes62

Although PVC has become conventional for some
plumbing uses, large commercial and residential
buildings can be built with no PVC pipes. There are
examples of such buildings around the country. In
some cases PVC must be avoided due to building
codes, as in Chicago and New York; in other cases
the choice of PVC-free plumbing is due to the
growing interest in “green building” design in general
and the desire to minimize PVC use in particular.

One such building is the Austin Resource Center for
the Homeless in Austin, Texas. (It is far from the
only example, even in Texas: the University of
Texas-Houston School of Nursing building made
almost identical choices about pipes.) This project,
located in downtown Austin, is a 26,820 gross square
foot building with a construction budget of $4.7
million. For this project, copper was specified as the
domestic water piping, and cast iron was used in all
other interior pipe applications, with polyethylene
used for irrigation pipe. According to the plumbing
contractor, MJ Mechanical, these pipe choices
resulted in an estimated 15 percent total increase in
the costs of plumbing materials and labor.

•  The decision to choose copper over PVC for
domestic water arose independently of the project
goal; in general, copper is a common choice for
domestic water pipes. Copper provides long-term
reliability and familiarity, which are important for
both owners and the trades.63 The PVC option for
hot water pipes would require CPVC (chlorinated
polyvinyl chloride), formulated to withstand
higher temperatures than standard PVC. (At this
point, CPVC is still considered a new market
entry, with only a 10 to 15 year track record in the
US. For experienced installers, copper can be
installed in about the same time as PVC; industry
handbooks estimate that it costs 10 percent more to
install CPVC than to install copper.)
•  For sanitary, waste, and vent pipes, cast iron
was used instead of PVC even though PVC has
become the standard material for these
applications. The cast iron cost 15 percent more
than PVC for materials, and did not change labor
costs.
•  To water the grounds, the project specifications
called for flexible polyethylene pipe housed in

the two tables refer to different categories of pipe:

that PVC is somewhat cheaper than copper, again
almost entirely due to differences in labor
requirements.

For small-diameter plumbing, the price comparisons
do not tell a story of large advantage in either
direction: retail prices are similar for PVC and other
plumbing materials (Table 5); installation cost
estimates favor the alternatives in some cases (Table
6) and PVC in others (Table 7). It seems safe to
conclude that there are feasible, affordable
alternatives for PVC-free plumbing.

steel sleeves. The specification of the steel sleeves
was based on concerns that the PE pipe could
become brittle and thus require additional
protection. This boosts both the material and labor
costs of this system; installation labor expenses are
estimated to run about three times the cost of
installing PVC irrigation pipe without a sleeve.
However, some pipe experts believe that such
sleeves are unnecessary on PE pipes and would
describe this as a case where misconceptions about
materials led to more costly choices.64

Plumbing Price Comparisons

To conclude our discussion of pipes, we look at the
costs of PVC and alternatives for several categories
of plumbing. Table 5 shows the retail purchase price
for two varieties of small-diameter pipes: ¾-inch
pipes made of materials not suited for hot water, and
½-inch pipes that are able to carry hot water. Note
that PVC and PE are fairly close in price for ¾-inch
pipe, as are CPVC and PEX for ½-inch hot/cold
water pipe. Only copper is distinctly more expensive
among the alternatives shown in Table 5.

PVC is Schedule 40; copper is Type L. Prices
are for various lengths (10 - 100 feet), converted
to price per foot.

Prices are from Home Depot and Lowe's on line,
and from an Austin, Texas, plumbing supply
store, as of September 2003.

The small differences in material price between PVC
and PE plumbing, seen in Table 5, are rarely decisive
for the total cost of a plumbing job. Tables 6 and 7
present installation costs for ¾-inch plumbing, based
on a standard database that is widely used in the
industry for estimating job costs. Table 6 presents the
costs for pipe installation alone, showing that
installation of PE-aluminum, or PEX-aluminum, pipe
is cheaper than CPVC. Labor costs are much greater
than material costs and vary more widely between the
two jobs: differing labor costs account for almost all
of the difference in total cost between CPVC and the
PE options.

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Alternatives to PVC, II: Roofing

Roofing is a $30 billion-a-year industry that installs
new and replacement roofs made from a wide range
of materials.65 Although multi-ply (multi-layer) roofs
can be applied on any building, it is increasingly
common to use single-ply roofing membranes,
particularly in low-slope applications for commercial
buildings. To provide for a range of different uses,
single-ply roofing membrane manufacturers produce
an extensive selection of membranes with varying
levels of thickness and reinforcement.

There are three major single-ply roofing membrane
materials for low-slope roofs: ethylene propylene
diene monomer (EPDM), thermoplastic elastomer
polyolefin (TPO), and PVC. (In steep-slope roofs,
PVC has a market share of less than 0.5 percent.) The
installed cost for any of the three is often cheaper
than for other styles of roofing. As shown in Table 8,
EPDM is clearly the market leader; the combination
of EPDM, TPO, and PVC roofs together accounts for
more than one-third of low-slope roofing sales.
(Additional single-ply materials, included in “all
other,” amount to another 2 percent of sales.) Among
single-ply roofing choices, the alternatives are often
lower-priced than vinyl, as explained below.

Overview," Professional Roofing Magazine

Life-Cycle Roofing Costs

For roofing, as for other construction products, what
matters for cost-effectiveness is the total life-cycle

cost of a product, rather than just its initial installed
cost. On the Tufts University campus, for instance,

there are dozens of buildings that periodically require
re-roofing. According to a general contractor that
frequently works for the university, Tufts formerly
used EPDM, but has now switched to built-up asphalt
for low-slope roofs. Although the multi-layer asphalt
roof costs almost twice as much per square foot as
EPDM, Tufts has decided that the multi-layer roof is
better suited to its requirements and reduces
maintenance costs. PVC is not a viable option for the
university, in the contractor’s view, since it would
cost even more per square foot than asphalt, due to
the time-consuming installation process. In addition,
it would not last as long and would tend to develop
cracks and leaks.66

As this example suggests, the expected lifetime of a
roof is crucial to its life-cycle costs. PVC does poorly
by this standard. A study of the lifetimes of almost
24,000 low-slope roofs found that PVC had the
shortest average life among the roofing types in the
study (Figure 2). Thus, even if PVC and another
roofing material had identical installed costs, PVC
would have a higher cost per year of expected
lifetime.67

Characteristics of Roofing Materials

As in other uses, the choice between PVC and rival
roofing materials depends on the physical
characteristics of the materials as well as the price
differentials. Single-ply roofing systems are popular
because of their comparatively low cost and ease of
installation. Within the single-ply category, the
leading materials are often seen as differing in
reflectivity, energy efficiency, durability and
flexibility, among other properties. In this section we
discuss differences among PVC, EPDM, and TPO.

Reflectivity

The vinyl industry advertises the fact that white vinyl
roofs reflect sunlight and thereby lower building
temperatures, increasing the energy efficiency of a
building when air conditioning is in use. This benefit
has been recognized by EPA’s Energy Star program,
which identifies proven energy-conserving
technologies. Until TPO was introduced, PVC was
the only white, single-ply membrane roofing material
available.

Historical Performance of Roofing Assemblies in the United States 1975-1996,”
Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Roofing Technology
(September, 1997).

Today, however, there are other options for white
roofs. TPO, a relatively new polymer, is available in
white, tan, or gray. It was first introduced in 1991 in
Europe and has since made the jump to the North
American market, where it is gaining market share.
EPDM, an inexpensive synthetic rubber product, is
naturally black; however, it can be made white
through coating or painting with a titanium dioxide
layer. The New Orleans Superdome, for example, has
a white EPDM roof.

During hot weather, roofing color is an important
factor affecting energy efficiency. While the
significance of white roofs is unquestioned for many
parts of the country, there is an ongoing debate about
the impact of roof color in northern climates.
Buildings in northern climates often experience more
heating than cooling days; some experts argue that
this makes a solar-absorptive or darker colored roof
preferable. Opponents of this view argue that white
roofing reduces energy costs even in northern
latitudes because cooling is a more expensive process
than heating, due to its reliance on electricity rather
than oil or natural gas. In addition, some roofs in
northern climates are snow covered during much of
the cold season, making the color of roofing materials
less important during the winter.68 Ongoing research
on roof reflectivity at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
will address this question; in a preliminary discussion
of the research, the lead investigator suggested that

roof color might have little overall effect on building
energy costs in northern climates.69

Durability and Flexibility

The three single-ply materials differ in durability and
flexibility, with PVC generally lagging behind both
of the other options.

Advantages of TPO membranes compared with PVC
include superior flexibility in cold weather—allowing
easier installation in cold climates70—and retention of
flexibility throughout the life span of the material.
EPDM offers similar advantages—the ability to
withstanding a broad range of temperatures, resist
weathering, and stretch and conform to unusual
shapes. It has excellent UV radiation, ozone, and
weathering resistance. In the past, a key disadvantage
of EPDM was that its seams were less effective than
those of either PVC or TPO under similar installation
conditions. According to individuals working in the
roofing industry, this problem has been eliminated
with the advent of new seaming techniques using
tape.

As in other vinyl products, additives such as
plasticizers must be present in PVC roofing
membranes in order for them to withstand frequent
traffic and maintain flexibility. Gradual migration of
plasticizers out of PVC roofing materials can lead to
seam failure and structural damage, which were

20

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

problematic when PVC was first introduced to the
roofing market. Stabilizers are now added to the PVC
to slow migration of the plasticizers, increasing the
life span of the PVC membrane, but this does not
entirely eliminate the problem.

The shorter lifetime of PVC roofs, as shown in
Figure 2, results in part from their tendency to
become brittle and crack. This effect was highlighted
in research by the US Army’s Construction
Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL).
Launching a long-term investigation into PVC
membrane roofing, a 1981 CERL report noted
anecdotal evidence of PVC roof failures in both
Switzerland and the United States, and said, “The
two most serious PVC membrane problems are
embrittlement from loss of plasticizer or from
exposure to ultraviolet rays and excessive
shrinkage.”71 A 1997 paper, reporting on CERL’s
ten-year field study of three PVC roofs at military
installations, found that the performance of two of the
roofs was “generally satisfactory,” whereas
“problems related to shattering and splitting”
occurred at the third.72 The paper offered a detailed
technical comparison of samples of the three roofs,
noting some evidence that the roof that shattered may
have lost more plasticizer than the ones that remained
intact.

Methods of installation

The installed cost of a roof depends on the method of
installation as well as the choice of material. There
are three primary ways to install single-ply roofing
systems: fully adhered, mechanically fastened, and
ballasted. TPO, EPDM, and PVC can each be
installed in any of these three ways.

A fully adhered roofing system uses the most
expensive and labor-intensive method of installation.
During installation of a fully adhered roofing system,
insulation boards are placed first and fastened to an
underlayment. This is a high performance system
used in situations where leaks cannot be tolerated
even temporarily, or where the roofing system may
be exposed to high winds. Seams can also be heat-
welded in a fully adhered roofing system.

A mechanically fastened roofing system is essentially
a quicker, somewhat less thorough and less expensive
variant on the fully adhered system. Insulation boards
are tacked down (though the fasteners are spaced
farther apart than in a fully adhered system) and the
seams can be heat-welded together. In a mechanically
fastened system, the membrane sheets are fastened to

the substrate at certain intervals, depending on
specifications.

A ballasted roofing system has the simplest
installation process. Insulation is loose laid, and
gravel is layered on top of the single-ply membrane,
holding the system in place. This causes the roof to
take on a grayish color (mitigating solar heat gain
somewhat when a black membrane is used). In areas
where river-washed gravel is readily available, this is
the least expensive installation process.

Costs of single-ply roofing systems73

To examine the prices of single-ply roofing systems,
we have collected data for several roofing options
from one location, Austin, Texas, and compared them
to costs for specific projects in three other locations.
The data demonstrate that PVC has the highest
installed cost of the three major single-ply roofing
materials. On a cost per year basis, PVC’s
disadvantage is likely even greater due to its shorter
expected lifetime, as documented above.

Energy Star initiatives have increased the use of
white roofing membranes in Texas. Many localities,
including Austin, offer rebates for increased
insulation or use of white reflective membrane. In
these areas, PVC maintains its market share in part
because it is slightly easier to heat weld in warm
climates. In addition, TPO is relatively new to the
roofing membrane industry and thus introduces
reliability concerns, making some institutions
reluctant to switch to TPO. EPDM is less popular in
Austin, despite its low cost, due to the interest in
white roofs for energy conservation.

Table 9 compares the costs (including material and
installation labor) of EPDM, TPO, and PVC roofing
options for commercial roofs in the Austin area.
Figure 3 presents the same data graphically for 45
mm roofing membranes. As these figures show, the
cheapest roofing option considered here is ballasted
EPDM, while fully adhered TPO and PVC have the
highest costs.

The range of variation among these costs is not
enormous and will not necessarily be decisive in
every decision-making process. The highest price
shown in the table is less than 150 percent of the
lowest price. However, it is clear that TPO is less
expensive than PVC in all cases, for all methods of
installation and for both membrane thicknesses.
Ballasted EPDM roofs, despite their comparative
energy inefficiency, have lower installed costs than
any of the alternatives.

Similar costs and conclusions can be observed
elsewhere.  For instance, a recent project in Chicago
installed 140,000 square feet of roofing on a
commercial building.74 The total project cost was
$400,000 for materials and labor. Thus, the installed
cost was $2.86 per square foot, similar to costs
observed in Austin. The material selected was TPO.

In this case, the choice of TPO was driven primarily
by the fact that the TPO installed price was 5 percent
lower than that of PVC (which is consistent with the
Austin data in Table 9). Labor estimates were
equivalent for PVC and TPO; the difference in
installed price reflected differences in material costs.
Given similar performance characteristics and
warranties between PVC and TPO, the contractor

indicated that this was a relatively simple decision in
which the deciding factor was materials price.

Somewhat higher costs, but the same general
conclusion—PVC is the more expensive choice—can
be found in recent experience in western
Massachusetts. Two similar school buildings, in the
towns of Longmeadow and Chicopee, recently
replaced roofs of about 120,000 square feet. The one
that specified vinyl paid $916,000, while the one that
did not specify a material paid $679,000 for a TPO
roof.75 The difference in cost between these two
roofs—roughly $7.60 versus $5.70 per square foot—
reflects not only material prices but also differences
in labor costs.

22

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Alternatives to PVC, III: Flooring 76

Flooring manufacturers sold 7.9 billion square feet of
hard floors in 2002, with a wholesale value of $7.1
billion. Vinyl accounted for 3.6 billion square feet,
and $1.84 billion of these totals—45 percent by area
and 26 percent by value. Roughly two-thirds of vinyl
flooring is installed in residential buildings and one-
third in commercial and institutional buildings.77

PVC primarily competes with other resilient flooring
materials—a category that includes all major floor
surfaces except wood, ceramic tile, and carpet.
Resilient flooring options range from natural cork
and traditional linoleum through synthetic rubber
products and new non-chlorinated polymers. Vinyl
flooring is advertised as a uniquely affordable,
durable, and easily maintained product. However,
while vinyl generally minimizes initial costs of
purchase and installation, it is not usually the longest-
lasting choice, nor the easiest or cheapest to maintain.
Its higher maintenance costs can actually make it one
the most expensive flooring options on a life-cycle
basis.

Our analysis starts with a description of the leading
options for resilient flooring, then compares the life-
cycle costs of these options, and concludes with case
studies of decisions between vinyl and linoleum
flooring in three cities.

Resilient Flooring Options

Vinyl

Vinyl flooring materials contain varying amounts of
plasticizers, stabilizers, and fillers. Plasticizers make
the naturally rigid PVC pliable. However, the vinyl
can become brittle as the plasticizer separates from
the polymer over time; stabilizers are used to slow
this separation. A filler compound, generally
pulverized limestone, is present in vinyl composite
tiles (VCT); some VCT products contain as little as
13 percent vinyl by weight.78

Health concerns associated with use of vinyl flooring
include possible adverse effects on respiratory health
during ordinary use as well as toxic emissions in case
of fire. For example, a 1999 study in Norway found
an association between use of PVC flooring in homes
and increased likelihood of bronchial obstruction in
young children.79 In case of fire, vinyl flooring can

give rise to hydrochloric acid fumes, dioxin
emissions, and other toxic substances (see earlier
discussion of fire risks).

These health concerns, as well as life-cycle cost
calculations, have prompted interest in alternatives to
vinyl flooring. A number of resilient flooring
alternatives are available, with varying characteristics
and advantages.

Cork

Cork is harvested from the cork oak tree (Querus
suber), found mainly in Portugal, Spain, and North
Africa. The trees live to be 300 to 400 years old; once
they are 50 years old, they can be harvested every
nine to ten years—a process that involves careful
removal of only the outer layer of the bark, allowing
the tree to survive. Due to the infrequency of the
harvest and its expense, all harvested material,
including the cork dust, is used. Some cork tiles also
have a recycled rubber backing.

After the manufacturing process, cork tiles are either
left unfinished or finished with a wax or polyurethane
topcoat. The most durable option, and the one best
suited to commercial applications, is the polyurethane
topcoat; refinishing with polyurethane is required
only every three to four years.

Cork can be extraordinarily long lasting; some cork
floors that were installed in the early twentieth
century are still in use. Examples include the US
Department of Commerce Building in Washington,
D.C., and St. Mary’s of the Lake Chapel near
Chicago.80

Linoleum

A classic of decades past, natural linoleum floor
covering is made from renewable materials: linseed
oil, pine or other rosin, ground cork dust, wood flour,
mineral fillers, and pigments. Linoleum products,
available in both sheet and tile, have a natural jute or
polyethylene backing depending on the manufacturer.
Due to its material composition, linoleum is
inherently anti-static and anti-bacterial.

Of the raw materials that compose linoleum,
environmental concerns have been raised about
volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
associated with linseed oil. However, according to a

23

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

test performed by the California Department of
Health Services, the average VOC emissions level for
linoleum falls toward the low end of the range of
emissions by vinyl products and by carpets: 170
micrograms of VOCs per square meter per hour for
linoleum, compared to 80 to 600 for various carpets
and 120 to 2300 for a range of vinyl products.
Stratica (discussed below) had emissions of less than
10, which is below the level the test could detect.81

Linoleum was once manufactured widely in the
United States; however, as demand began to fall in
the 1950s, the industry declined here, with the last
US plant closing in 1975. Today, natural linoleum is
still produced in Europe; an estimated $20 to $25
million worth of linoleum is imported into the United
States annually.82 The product’s image has prospered,
even if the industry producing it did not: in building
supply stores such as Home Depot, “linoleum” now
refers to a different product, namely vinyl floor
coverings designed to look like traditional linoleum.

Non-vinyl Polymer Flooring: Stratica83

Stratica is a proprietary resilient floor covering
material manufactured by Amtico in both European
and US plants. Its topcoat, DuPont’s Surlyn, was
originally developed as an outer surface for golf
balls. Surlyn is heat-fused to the Stratica base and is
responsible for the floor covering’s durability and
low maintenance requirements. It is the resilient floor
material most similar to vinyl flooring in appearance,
with a high-gloss (yet low-maintenance) surface.

Stratica is a low-VOC material that is non-allergenic
and mildew and odor resistant. Introduced to the
United States market in 1997, Stratica boasts a 100
percent recovery rate for its post-industrial waste.
Post-consumer Stratica waste can be recycled into
backing for more Stratica flooring; however, facilities
do not yet exist for this process in the United States.

Rubber

Rubber floor covering, available in both tiles and
sheets, can be made from natural rubber, from
recycled automobile and truck tires, or from synthetic
rubber compounds including styrene butadiene
rubber (SBR), ethylene propylene diene monomer
(EPDM), nitrile, or the proprietary Nora rubber.

Health and environmental concerns vary widely with
the composition of the rubber floor material. General
concerns have been raised about VOC emissions and
the overall impact on indoor air quality, particularly

for products made from recycled tires and/or styrene.
Carbon black dust, emitted by some rubber products,
also raises concerns about indoor air quality. The
manufacturing process for SBR products creates
potential worker health hazards.84

Rubber is also suitable for use under a wider range of
conditions than some alternatives; both cork and
linoleum tend to swell when exposed to consistent
moisture. Rubber flooring has the advantage of
requiring very little maintenance.

Life-Cycle Costs

Data gathered from floor specialists and distributors
in three cities--Austin, Washington, and Chicago--
reflect the cost of materials and installation, as well
as regular maintenance requirements and estimated
costs for common maintenance functions for heavily
used commercial and institutional floor space. 85
Costs for leading resilient flooring materials over a
20-year life cycle are shown in Table 10.

Table 10 shows the initial costs, expected life span,
annual maintenance costs, and 20-year life-cycle
costs of selected brands in five categories of flooring
materials: vinyl, cork, linoleum, non-chlorinated
polymer (Stratica), and rubber. All costs are
presented on a per square foot basis. The table
demonstrates the substantial importance of
maintenance costs.

Initial material and installation costs are as low as
$2.65 per square foot for vinyl tile and range from
$5.50 to $11.70 for other materials. Based on initial
material and installation costs alone, an institution
could spend as little as about $2,700 to install 1000
square feet of vinyl composite tile (VCT), or two to
four times that amount for a higher-end floor.
Thousands of dollars of initial savings are apparently
available by choosing vinyl tile—the high-end rubber
floor shown in this table (Flexco-Radial, last line of
Table 10) would cost $9,000 more than vinyl tile for
a 1000 square foot installation.

However, flooring installation represents a very small
part of total cost when expressed in terms of cost per
year of use. Far more important is the annual
maintenance cost; the data in Table 10 show that for
heavy-traffic areas maintenance costs account for at
least 98 percent of the life-cycle cost for each
flooring material.86 The high-end rubber floor has the
lowest maintenance costs per square foot, and
therefore the lowest life-cycle costs over all. Over 20
years, it would save more than $500 per square foot,

24

compared to the “low cost” vinyl tile. Cork, the
second-most expensive product in Table 10 in terms
of first cost, is the second cheapest on a life-cycle
basis due to its low maintenance costs and long
lifetime. Stratica is also a bargain compared to vinyl;
linoleum is cheaper than vinyl on a life-cycle basis,

although more expensive than several of the other
alternatives. In short, the initial cost savings from
vinyl are counterbalanced by high costs over the life
cycle of the flooring.

A similar conclusion emerges from a US Navy
assessment of decking materials for its ships.87 In that
assessment the Navy tested Stratica in high-traffic
areas (such as food service areas) on ten ships,
covering a total of 37,800 square feet. Due to the
heavy use, the estimates of the lifetimes were shorter,
10 years for Stratica versus 5 for vinyl tile; the Navy
also found that Stratica required about one-third as
much labor for maintenance. The maintenance costs
were by far the dominant factor, as shown by the
Navy’s analysis of costs over a ten-year span,
summarized in Table 11. The Navy estimates that the
maintenance costs per square foot per year (one-tenth
of the ten-year maintenance and repair figures shown
in Table 11) are about $20 for Stratica and $59 for
vinyl, compared to $32 for Stratica and $52 for vinyl
reported in Table 10.

The high maintenance costs shown in Tables 10 and
11 may be interpreted as worst-case estimates,
appropriate for the heaviest-use areas. For example,
the Navy’s food service areas on major ships are
presumably very high-traffic areas, with hundreds of
sailors moving through them several times a day. In

contrast, many offices, stores, and institutions
experience much lower traffic and likely have
correspondingly lower floor maintenance costs.

However, the key conclusion to be drawn from

other flooring options on a life-cycle basis, due to its
high maintenance costs—would remain true even if

25

maintenance costs were substantially lower.
Recalculation of Table 10, assuming 1 percent of the
reported maintenance costs for each material, would
still find both vinyl tile options to be more expensive
over 20 years than any of the alternatives. Even at
this reduced level, maintenance costs would still
represent more than half of the life-cycle costs for 10
of the 12 options in Table 10. Similarly, recalculation
of Table 11 assuming 1 percent of the Navy’s repair
and maintenance costs would still find Stratica to be
cheaper than vinyl over 10 years.

maintenance costs as well. Forbo, a major vendor,
promotes dry maintenance of its linoleum flooring;
this is a source of significant maintenance-related
savings when linoleum is used rather than vinyl. In
contrast, Armstrong, another leading vendor,
recommends the use of higher-cost polish and wet
maintenance methods for linoleum in order to
produce a gloss finish similar to that of vinyl. The
company contends that this method has performance
benefits as well, although Armstrong’s warranty is
not affected by the cleaning regimen adopted.90

The Maintenance Costs Puzzle

Case Studies: Vinyl versus Linoleum

The conclusion that vinyl flooring has higher life-
cycle costs than the alternatives rests on two facts
shown in the tables above. First, the lower-cost vinyl
option, VCT, has the shortest lifetime of any of the
materials shown in Table 10; its installed cost per
year of life span is actually higher than for some of
the alternatives (see column C in Table 10). Second,
the maintenance cost per square foot is higher for
vinyl than for any of the alternatives.

It may seem surprising that vinyl floors have higher
maintenance requirements than the alternatives in
commercial and institutional settings. In contrast,
sales of vinyl flooring to residential customers rely
on the claim that vinyl is the “maintenance free”
choice. There are several likely explanations for the
differing evaluations of maintenance needs. Virtually
any commercial or institutional flooring gets heavier
use than most residential floors; for this reason,
residential and commercial vinyl flooring are
somewhat different in material composition, leading
to different maintenance requirements.88 In addition,
there are often higher standards for glossy appearance
of floors in nonresidential areas, despite the heavier
traffic. (See the Austin case study, below, for more
on high-gloss standards.)

Because standard maintenance regimens for vinyl
flooring represent significant expenses, some
commercial vinyl flooring products are starting to
offer lower-maintenance options: for example,
urethane wear finishes that reduce the frequency of
strip and wax cycles, or new commercial finish
products that require only annual application and
eliminate the need for stripping. Product
developments of this kind could lead to reduced
maintenance costs in the future. 89 The data in Table
10 reflect price comparisons as of 2003, based on
actual industry data in several regional markets.
In addition, changes in the maintenance protocols for
other flooring products could affect their

The choice among rival materials for resilient
flooring is debated in countless design projects,
involving a mixture of economic, engineering, and
environmental considerations. To look more closely
at the prospects for alternative materials, we
examined specific design decisions in buildings in
Austin, Washington, and Chicago—all of which
involved the choice between linoleum and vinyl. The
results were mixed: some found linoleum to be
comparable to vinyl in performance and lower in
maintenance costs, as well as preferable on
environmental grounds; others faulted the
performance of linoleum, or were unable to resist the
lower installed cost of vinyl.

Austin, Texas 91

The University of Texas at Austin has used a variety
of flooring material for student residence halls:
linoleum flooring (both sheet and tile), vinyl sheet,
and VCT flooring. Three university floor areas in two
buildings have used linoleum and vinyl products
from the same supplier, Forbo.

One building has a sheet vinyl floor installed in the
ground floor lobby, and linoleum tile in the second
floor lobby. An older dormitory has linoleum sheet
flooring. In the first building, the university is
generally satisfied with the linoleum tile, but notes
that it does not achieve the sheen of the vinyl product
on the first floor. That vinyl floor is the university’s
favorite in terms of maintenance and appearance.

In the building with the linoleum sheet installation,
the lack of sheen is also a concern; there is a sense
that the linoleum doesn’t respond as well as the sheet
vinyl to spray buff maintenance between
reapplications of new polish. This older building is
subject to periodic water leaks and the linoleum has
bubbled as a result of water exposure. The lack of
moisture resistance appears to be the linoleum’s main

26

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

vulnerability. Leaks at building doorways, window
leaks, and water fountains have created several
urgent repair situations. A similar pattern of problems
has not appeared with vinyl products.

Each of the three installations is nine to ten years old.
The university’s perception is that the vinyl sheet
product has been the easiest to maintain, had the least
problems, and upheld its appearance the best.
Because these facilities are used 24 hours a day,
every day, application of new polish only occurs
during shut-down periods between semesters. Spray-
buffing is relied on for standard, frequent
maintenance between reapplications of polish.

In general, people expressed a surprising degree of
concern about the lack of a gloss finish on linoleum
flooring. An adjustment in expectations might be
expected as part of a market transformation process,
so that individuals come to understand that a floor
does not need to be glossy in order to be clean. Some
of the savings available from the use of linoleum
disappear if the maintenance protocols required for
vinyl are used, unnecessarily, in order to achieve the
same level of gloss found with vinyl flooring. It may
be important to train maintenance crews in the
differences between vinyl and linoleum products.
Without such training, in a building where both types
of flooring are present, maintenance staff may default
to known maintenance procedures, which have been
developed for vinyl.

Washington, DC 92

We examined two recent projects in Washington. In
one federal building, the Government Services
Administration (GSA) selected linoleum to cover
approximately 3,000 square feet instead of VCT.
Installed costs for VCT were estimated at $1.50 per
square foot (even lower than the cost shown in Table
10); thus it was about $5.00 per square foot cheaper
than linoleum. Nonetheless, linoleum was chosen for
two reasons: first, a rapidly renewable and
environment friendly product would complement the
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) program for green building design; second,
linoleum was projected to cost less to maintain over
the life of the product than VCT. Project managers
also took into account the fact that the wear
characteristics of linoleum are about the same as
VCT.

In another project, a major architectural design firm
used linoleum for a 40,000 square foot renovation in
its Washington office. The differential in installed
cost per square foot was again about $5.00 per square

foot. The designers were well versed in
environmental sustainability issues and felt strongly
about using environment friendly surfaces in the
space. They typically recommend linoleum in lieu of
VCT in all of their projects.

Chicago, Illinois 93

The Interfaith Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
project, under construction in Chicago in 2003, aims
to provide permanent housing for 63 single, homeless
women and six families. One environmental goal of
the building design was to choose materials with low
VOC emissions. At the same time, the project had a
tight budget. Both of these factors influenced flooring
choices.

As a nonprofit enterprise constructing a residential
building, the Interfaith SRO project faced different,
and lower, costs than commercial buildings;
maintenance requirements, in particular, are lower,
since many parts of the building will experience
much less traffic than an office or other business
establishment. However, the general pattern was the
same: vinyl flooring had a lower first cost, while
linoleum had lower maintenance costs and a lower
overall life-cycle cost.

Project managers originally intended to use linoleum
because of its ease of maintenance as well as its low
VOC emissions. Vinyl, with its more complex
maintenance requirements and potential to aggravate
respiratory problems, was not their preferred option.
However, the higher first cost of linoleum installation
was a burden for the project’s limited finances. In the
course of research for this project, a supply of unused
vinyl flooring was found in a closed factory. As the
flooring was headed to the landfill, using the material
was thought to be a more environmentally sustainable
option; and the installed price of the product was
unusually low given the circumstances—less than
half the price of ordinary VCT.

Ultimately, project managers settled on a
compromise in which the resident’s apartments and
townhouses, accounting for half the floor space in the
project, would have the bargain-priced vinyl flooring
and all public spaces would have linoleum. The vinyl
product that was available would not have been
suitable for high traffic areas, such as hallways and
recreation areas, where the linoleum was placed.

Lessons from Case Studies

Our case studies, selected from recent experience
with environmentally conscious (“green building”)

27

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

initiatives, show that the case for alternatives to vinyl
is not yet as widely accepted in flooring as, for
instance, in roofing. Characteristics favoring vinyl
flooring include the ease of maintaining a traditional
high-gloss appearance and the appeal of low installed
costs for severely budget-constrained buyers.

However, our analysis suggests a number of
additional considerations that could tip the balance
toward the alternatives. The low installed cost of
vinyl is often misleading; on a life-cycle cost basis,
other products are often cheaper. There is a wide
range of alternative materials, no one of which is
right for every application; one possible inference
from the case studies is that some green building
efforts may have overemphasized linoleum at the
expense of other alternatives. Cork provides an
equally natural, renewable flooring with a very long
lifetime and low maintenance costs; rubber offers
water resistance and the lowest life-cycle costs in
some circumstances; and Stratica combines a vinyl-
like, high-gloss appearance with minimal
maintenance and lower life-cycle costs than vinyl.
Despite some environmental concerns of their own,
each of these alternatives avoids the toxic emissions
associated with the PVC life cycle.

Alternatives to PVC, IV: Medical Supplies and Gloves

Medical supplies account for less than 3 percent of
total PVC use.94 Nonetheless, PVC medical products
have significant and troubling implications from a
public health perspective, due to leaching of
plasticizers from medical equipment as well as the
hazard of dioxin formation when medical waste is
incinerated. 95

The bulk of PVC use in disposable medical devices
occurs in three types of products: gloves, bags, and
tubing. Each of these categories has multiple sub-
categories with distinct requirements. For example,
the broad category of bags includes IV bags, which
may hold medications, nutritional fluids, or saline
solutions; total parenteral nutrition bags, which are
used to feed patients intravenously when they cannot
eat; and a variety of bags used to store blood,
including bags for whole blood and bags for
individual blood components such as red blood cells
or platelets. Multiple alternatives to PVC exist in
each area; bags can be made from materials including
nylon, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyethylene
(PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyolefins. Tubes can
be made from materials including silicone,
polyurethane, and rubber.96

For the most part, the raw materials available for
manufacture of PVC-free bags and tubes are
somewhat more expensive than PVC on a per pound
basis. Partially counterbalancing this greater
materials cost, some alternatives are inherently
stronger than PVC, requiring less raw material for a
similar product or providing greater durability. In
manufacturing PVC-free bags, for example,
manufacturers can partially offset the higher
materials cost through downgauging (using a thinner
sheet of the alternative product) and eliminating extra
materials (PVC bags must be wrapped in an extra bag
to prevent volatilization of plasticizers and resulting
loss of flexibility before use; non-PVC bags do not
require this overwrap).

For example, leaching problems arise with some
types of tubing. Like other pliable PVC products,
PVC medical tubing—which includes products
ranging from IV tubes to parenteral nutrition systems
to enteral feeding tubes—derives its flexibility from
the addition of plasticizers. These plasticizers leach
out of the PVC tubing to varying extents, depending
on how they are being used. One recent study found
that after 24 hours inside an infant's stomach, PVC
feeding tubes had lost half their plasticizer content.97

In cases where the tubing is inside the patient's body,
the leaching of plasticizers not only introduces a
toxic substance directly into the patient's body, it also
decreases the flexibility of the tubing over time. The
health effects of plasticizers in children’s bodies may
be subtle or delayed, making them difficult to track,
but if a feeding tube becomes brittle and unusable,
this effect is readily observed. Alternatives such as
silicon are substituted for PVC for longer term uses.

Costs, Institutions, and Medical Purchasing

There is wide variation from one product category to
the next in the availability and prices of non-PVC
gloves, bags, and tubing. In some cases, non-PVC
alternatives are currently available on the market at
competitive prices. For example, cost-competitive
alternatives are available for IV bags, platelet and
fresh frozen plasma bags, and oxygen masks.98 In
other cases, non-PVC alternatives cost more than
PVC devices but also present clear performance
advantages, such as greater durability.

The full cost implications of choosing a given
material involve a range of factors, including
performance and durability of the product. In
addition, supply and demand interactions affect costs
over time. Demand for products made from safer
materials can provide the impetus for manufacturers
to invest in new equipment to launch production.

The evolving institutional structure of American
medicine makes it difficult to analyze the markets for
individual medical supplies. Health care institutions
increasingly purchase medical devices via group
purchasing organizations (GPOs). Through GPOs,
health care institutions are often able to place large
orders and receive substantial discounts through
bundling of purchases. A vendor may supply many
products, for use at many locations, under a single
agreement with a GPO.

Due to the size and market power of the institutions
involved, the prices actually paid for medical devices
are affected by the volume in which they are
purchased. The price of an order of surgical gloves or
IV bags, for example, is often negotiated as part of a
larger package that includes many other medical
supplies. The negotiated price may depend on the
total volume of the supplies of all types bought by the
GPO. Therefore, prices for the same good offered by

29

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

different vendors, or paid by different purchasers,
may not be strictly comparable to each other.

Still, it is possible to make some broad comparisons
on the basis of advertised prices. In the remainder of
this section, we focus on the factors that influence
choice of materials for medical gloves in particular.
We look at variations in prices of gloves intended for
use in medical settings, using the prices quoted to us
by a vendor—which may be higher than the price that
would be negotiated by a major GPO.

Gloves in Medical Settings

Disposable gloves are used in medical settings to
prevent disease transmission and as a barrier to
chemicals and chemotherapy drugs. Materials used in
high volume for examination gloves, which are the
focus of our discussion here, include latex, PVC, and
acrylonitrile (also known as nitrile). Other glove
materials include neoprene, another chlorinated
plastic; Elastrin, a proprietary elastomer; and
polyurethane. Surgical gloves may be made from
materials including latex or nitrile; PVC is not
approved by the FDA for use in surgical gloves
because it is not considered strong enough for the
conditions of surgery.

In many hospitals, gloves are also used by food
service workers to prevent direct contact between
their hands and the food they prepare. For food
service settings, polyethylene gloves offer a low-cost,
effective option. These gloves do not need to be of
medical quality since they are not acting as protection
against bloodborne pathogens.

Latex allergies and the need for alternatives

Latex, made from natural rubber, was the material of
choice in medical settings for many years. However,
with rising frequency of glove use in health care in
the late 1980s and 1990s, large numbers of health
care workers and others developed allergies to
latex.99 The mildest symptoms of latex allergy can be
similar to hay fever; more severe reactions include
hives, asthma, and dangerous swelling of the face,
mouth, and airway. At its most severe, latex allergies
can produce anaphylactic shock, a severe and
frequently fatal reaction that can involve swelling of
the throat and a sudden decline in blood pressure.
Thus, it has become imperative that health care
institutions identify alternatives to latex gloves in
order to protect their workers, patients, and
visitors.100

In the context of increasing problems with latex
allergies, many health care institutions are now
looking at the relative merits of vinyl and nitrile
gloves. While these alternatives are less acutely toxic
than latex to health care providers and patients, there
is no entirely non-toxic glove material on the market.
As we have seen, the manufacture and disposal of
PVC products is associated with the production and
release of toxic and persistent chemicals.
Acrylonitrile can also pose health hazards as a
pollutant at hazardous waste sites where it has been
discarded and in air, soil, and water near industrial
facilities where it is produced, although acrylonitrile
breaks down relatively rapidly and does not
bioaccumulate.101

Most latex and many nitrile gloves contain
accelerators—chemicals added to facilitate the
manufacturing process and ensure that gloves are
strong and resilient. Some health care workers
exposed to accelerators in gloves can develop allergic
contact dermatitis, a form of skin irritation producing
itching and blistering lesions similar to those
associated with a poison ivy reaction.102 Some
companies now provide accelerator-free nitrile
gloves. While accelerator allergies can be a serious
problem, they are not on the order of latex allergies,
because they do not produce a systemic reaction and
are not as widespread.

Performance evaluation

Glove performance can be judged in terms of
multiple characteristics, including durability, barrier
quality, and tactile properties. Barrier quality is the
ability of a glove to prevent transmission of
pathogens carried in blood or other fluids and is
linked to over-all durability. Tactile properties refer
to the extent to which the glove allows normal
sensation in the hand.

Gloves can be subjected to a variety of tests to gauge
their reliability as a barrier to disease transmission.
Some of these tests are required by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA); others are voluntary.
Testing requirements depend on the intended use of
the product; for example, gloves for use with
chemotherapeutic agents are in the highest class and
require more rigorous testing than examination or
surgical gloves.103

Most tests that assess the durability and barrier
quality of medical exam gloves are best suited to
detecting gross manufacturing problems. Often, the
gloves are simply filled with water and tested for
leaks. More sensitive tests have also been developed

30

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

in which the glove material is placed in contact with
a fluid containing a virus, and the material is tested
for permeability to the virus. For example, the ASTM
F 1671 test looks at the ability of the glove material
to protect against blood-borne pathogens, such as
viruses.104 FDA does not require manufacturers to
test glove effectiveness in preventing movement of
viruses across the glove material, but some
manufacturers carry out this test voluntarily. Other
tests are available to measure the ability of gloves to
protect against chemicals used in medicine, such as
chemotherapy drugs.

A recent study compared barrier integrity of latex,
nitrile, and PVC gloves.105 The study looked at
barrier integrity of each glove type both in "static"
conditions, in which the glove was simply removed
from the box and tested, and in conditions of activity,
in which the glove was manipulated to simulate
actual use in health care. The gloves were subjected
only to the test for water leaking; more sensitive tests
were not attempted.

The researchers found dramatic differences in the
gloves' barrier integrity after manipulations
simulating the kinds of activity for which gloves are
commonly used, such as connecting and
disconnecting a syringe or wrapping, taping, and
unwrapping a blunt object.

The researchers tested four brands each of vinyl and
latex gloves, and two brands of nitrile gloves. They
found that for all nitrile and latex gloves tested, the
failure rate ranged from 0 to 5 percent. For vinyl
gloves, there was greater variation among brands;
three brands had failure rates from 1 percent to 3
percent when used directly out of the box, while the
fourth had a 12 percent out-of-box failure rate. The
highest failure rates appeared in vinyl gloves tested
after simulated use; these had failure rates ranging
from 12 percent to 61 percent.106 Table 12 shows the
average failure rates observed by the researchers for
each material, both for gloves tested directly out of
the box without manipulation and for gloves tested
after manipulations simulating normal use.

The study notes that PVC has relatively poor barrier
qualities due to its molecular structure; even when
plasticizers are added, “vinyl still lacks the ability to
stretch when stressed or snagged, and readily
fractures, tears, or separates at the molecular level
resulting in barrier loss.” 107 The authors conclude that
nitrile and latex gloves are significantly more
resistant than vinyl to breaking down or leaking
during use.

Vinyl glove examples include both standard
vinyl and "stretch" vinyl.

In the case of latex, pores in the material sometimes
allow visible leakage; medical staff may find
patients’ blood on their hands after wearing
apparently intact gloves. The Sustainable Hospitals
Project at University of Massachusetts-Lowell has
even received anecdotal reports of hospital
practitioners in an emergency department who
routinely put on a double layer of latex gloves to
avoid this problem.108

Durability and total utilization cost

The superior barrier qualities and durability of nitrile
mean that the difference in cost, relative to
performance, is not as great as it appears from the
unit prices listed here. A 1999 analysis by Kaiser
Permanente, the nation’s largest not-for-profit health
care organization, found that on a total utilization
cost basis, nitrile gloves were cost competitive with
the alternatives, due to their greater durability.109 On
the basis of this analysis, Kaiser Permanente decided
to switch to nitrile, purchasing 43 million nitrile
gloves.110

The data used in Kaiser Permanente’s cost analysis
are not available. As noted above, health care
institutions generally purchase medical supplies,
including gloves, through large contracts that include
multiple types of equipment and supplies. Negotiated
prices for these contracts may depend on an
institution’s total volume of purchases and are
generally lower than publicly available “list prices.”
(In general, anyone purchasing 43 million items
might expect to get the lowest possible price per
item; other medical institutions are likely to make
smaller, but still substantial, glove purchases.)
Nonetheless, it is possible to gain some insight into
price differences by comparing publicly available list
prices. Actual prices paid by health care institutions
are likely to be lower than these list prices.

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Medical gloves come in a wide variety of sizes and
specifications. Glove characteristics that may vary
from one product to another include glove length, the
diameter of the wrist opening, the thickness of the
material, hand orientation (right and left hand gloves
produced separately, or ambidextrous gloves),
durability, and the level of quality testing that has
been applied to the product.

Table 13 shows the prices of vinyl, latex, and nitrile
medical exam gloves available through the distributor
Fisher Scientific. The gloves used for this example
are sold under the distributor’s name, as a Fisher
brand product, and are among the distributor’s most
commonly sold varieties. (They are, however,
manufactured by three different companies.) The
three examples examined here were identified by
Fisher Scientific sales staff as being broadly
comparable to one another. All are size large, powder
free, medical exam grade gloves. According to the
sales staff, powdered gloves would cost less for each
material, but the ratio among the prices would be
approximately the same.111

The quality standards that the gloves meet are not
identical; in several respects, the standards are lower
for vinyl. For example, the percentage of leaks
allowed is higher for the vinyl gloves than for the
latex or nitrile gloves.112 The minimum standards for
strength and elongation of examination gloves are
also lower for vinyl gloves than for latex and nitrile
gloves.113

Based on the prices available directly from Fisher
Scientific, when gloves are purchased in cases of 10
boxes (1000 gloves) each, nitrile gloves cost twice as
much as vinyl gloves.114 The bulk discount available

for cases of 1000 gloves is the maximum bulk
discount offered to us by Fisher, so these prices per
glove would apply for larger orders as well.

If gloves never failed (or all types failed at the same
rate), and equal numbers were used for a task
regardless of the choice of material, then the prices in
column B would describe the relative costs of
different gloves. In particular, using nitrile gloves
would cost twice as much as using PVC gloves.

However, because of durability differences among
glove materials, it makes more sense to consider the
average cost per glove use. Thus we build in a
“durability factor” to reflect the average measured
failure rate for each glove type, using the “simulated
use” failure rates from Table 12. With this approach,
we make the assumption that in every instance in
which a glove fails the user discards it and puts on a
new glove. In other words, we assume that vinyl
gloves will be discarded and replaced due to failure
in 30 percent of all uses, while nitrile and latex will
be discarded and replaced due to failure only 2
percent of the time. This assumption is an
approximation for the more complicated reality, in
which some glove failures go undetected while in
other cases, health care professionals may wear a
double layer of gloves due to concerns about the
gloves leaking or breaking.

As Table 13 shows, building in this durability factor
decreases the cost difference between vinyl and
nitrile from about seven cents per glove to less than
five cents per glove use. Thus, the differential is
reduced by about a third through the incorporation of
the durability factor.

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Anecdotally, there are other advantages to switching
to nitrile as well. For example, the Sustainable
Hospitals Project has been in contact with hospitals
that found certain important, though nonquantified,
practical benefits associated with switching to nitrile
across the board and eliminating all other glove
materials. One hospital that previously stocked over
80 different glove types and brands was able to
switch to fewer than ten when the hospital began
purchasing only nitrile gloves; in addition, the
hospital no longer had to make special arrangements
for susceptible staff to avoid latex. The switch also
eliminated the need to educate staff about which
glove types were safe for varied uses and settings.115

Glove costs in context

How much of a difference glove prices make to a
health care institution’s overall budget depends on
how many gloves are consumed per patient and how
much the institution spends per patient as a whole.
The federal National Hospital Indicators Survey
provides overview statistics on expenditures and

revenues at community (non-teaching) hospitals in
the US. These hospitals were estimated to spend
$1,318 per patient day for inpatient care, and $265
per outpatient visit.116

These total cost figures can be used to put glove costs
in context. For example, if five pairs of gloves (ten
individual gloves) are used per patient-day, switching
from PVC to nitrile gloves would increase glove
costs per patient-day from slightly under a dollar a
day to slightly under $1.50 a day, a difference of
about 48 cents in total expenditures per patient-day,
or an increase of less than 0.04 percent of total
expenditures per inpatient patient-day. If ten pairs of
gloves (twenty individual gloves) are required per
patient-day, the switch would increase costs by about
one dollar, or less than one-twelfth of a percent (less
than 0.08 percent) of expenditures per patient-day.
The costs discussed here, of course, do not include
any calculation of the costs of illnesses that could be
transmitted due to glove failures.

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Alternatives to PVC, V: Siding and Windows

The fastest-growing uses of PVC, and the largest
after pipes, are vinyl siding and windows. As seen in
Table 1, early in this report, siding and windows
experienced double-digit annual growth rates
throughout the 1990s and now represent about 20
percent of all PVC use in the US and Canada. Here
we examine these areas briefly; our discussion of
siding relies heavily on the August 2003 Consumer
Reports survey, which offered a comprehensive
review of the available alternatives. Our discussion of
windows draws on a number of construction industry
sources.

Siding117

Vinyl is now the most common siding material for
low- and moderate-priced housing, but it is not the
only product on the market. Wood shingles or
clapboard also offer viable siding alternatives, as do
fiber cement and simulated stucco. Aluminum, an
important alternative in the past, has all but vanished
from the market and is not discussed here.

Vinyl

Vinyl siding is available in a variety of colors,
thicknesses, and qualities. Installation is easy, and
vendors tout vinyl as "maintenance free." Vinyl is
known for its ability to mimic other looks such as
wood. It is often said to be resistant to water damage;
it is also impervious to insects.

Unfortunately, vinyl siding can warp if it gets too hot.
It is also sensitive to cold temperatures, which can
cause it to chip or crack and become brittle, and it
expands and contracts with temperature changes.
Many home improvement sources contest the
common claim that vinyl is not damaged by water; it
is often acknowledged that when cleaning or painting
vinyl, a homeowner must, much as with wood siding,
be careful to remove all mildew prior to adding a coat
of paint. Vinyl presents the additional problem that it
can burn or smolder, threatening the health and safety
of people in or near a burning house, as well as the
health and safety of firefighters.

Vinyl generally fades with time, although some
higher end sidings now include UV protection to
limit the amount of fading that can occur. Once the
color has faded, it may need to be painted, requiring
specific paints and processes to ensure the desired

look. After the vinyl has been painted, it will need to
be repainted in time, although the frequency depends
on the quality of paint used—high-quality paint can
last up to ten years, whereas lower-quality paint may
last only four years. According to Electrospec Home
Inspection Services notes, because of the heat
absorption of vinyl, a homeowner needs to be careful
not to paint the vinyl a color any darker than the
original color.118

Wood

Wood siding is also easy to install, although not as
easy as vinyl. It has the added value of being the
preferred look for housing: vinyl and fiber cement
siding both seek to emulate the appearance of wood
siding. Wood can be purchased finished or left
natural, and it is impact resistant, even in cold
temperatures.

Wood siding, though, can warp, twist, or be damaged
by water if not properly maintained. It is also
vulnerable to insect damage and burns readily. In
order to maintain wood siding properly it does need
to be painted or stained repeatedly, although how
frequently this is required depends on the quality of
the paint used and on the climate.

Fiber cement

Fiber cement is a newer alternative to wood and vinyl
siding and is made primarily from a combination of
cement, sand, and cellulose fibers. According to
Georgia-Pacific, it is installed much like wood,
although carbide or diamond head blades or shears,
which are stronger than ordinary sawblades, are
suggested in order to preserve the blades. (According
to architect Bruce Hampton, some contractors "carry
the cost of a saw with each new job" for large scale
projects, because the dust damages the saw over
time.)

The look created by fiber cement can vary from
rough sawn cedar to stucco, depending on its
embossing. Fiber cement is available in a number of
forms, such as planks or octagon shaped shingles,
and can be purchased already primed and painted. It
does not warp or twist, is impact resistant, and is
impervious to insects. Unlike vinyl siding, it does not
expand and contract, nor does it burn or smolder in a
fire.

34

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Fiber cement does need to be painted, but it requires
painting less frequently than wood siding: Georgia-
Pacific notes that some third parties guarantee their
coatings for twenty years. However, although fiber
cement itself does not burn, products applied to it
may. It may also be damaged by water freezing and
thawing. The material data sheet for Hardiplank, a
brand of fiber cement, warns that the product
contains silica. Inhaling silica dust during
manufacturing or construction work can cause
silicosis, a devastating lung disease. This is a
potentially controllable problem; but unless the silica
dust is controlled, fiber cement production and
installation present health hazards to the workers who
make and install it.

Simulated stucco

Simulated stucco is a relatively new product on the
market, offering a very distinct appearance.
Sometimes called Exterior Insulation Finish Systems
(EIFS), it uses a polymer-based outer coating that
contains plastic resin, which makes it softer and more
flexible than cement-based stucco, over a cement
board sheathing.119 If it is not applied properly, the
material may trap moisture and allow the growth of
mold, problems which have sparked a number of
lawsuits. If improperly applied, simulated stucco
cannot be fixed; it must instead be replaced, possibly
along with the wood structural components behind
the EIFS barrier.120 Although it is impervious to
insects, it can crack, requiring it to be refinished, and
it can burn.

Costs

The cost of each of these products varies, depending
on the quality of the siding. Consumer Reports
compared the material costs and estimated lifetimes
of high- and low-quality siding of each of the
alternatives, as shown in Table 14. Some anecdotal
reports suggest a shorter life span for vinyl,121 but we
use the Consumer Reports estimates for all materials

for the sake of consistency. A simple additional
calculation, shown in the last two columns of Table
14, demonstrates that the material cost per year is
lowest for fiber cement among lower-quality siding
options, and for wood among the higher-quality
options. (This is not a complete life-cycle cost
calculation, since it does not include installation and
maintenance costs.)

Windows

As in the case of siding, vinyl has become widely
used for windows in low- and moderate-priced
construction, but it is not the only option on the
market. Alternatives to vinyl windows include wood,
fiberglass, and aluminum windows. There are also
options for repairing old wood windows to improve
their energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is a major
concern influencing the choice of new or replacement
windows.

Vinyl

The benefits and drawbacks of vinyl windows are
similar to those of vinyl siding. Vinyl windows do
not rot, but they are sensitive to both hot and cold
temperatures, can become brittle, and can incur dents.
Often sold as “maintenance free,” vinyl windows
raise some of the same issues discussed in connection
with maintenance of vinyl siding. In addition, the
fiberglass industry (i.e., the supplier of a competing
product) notes that of all window materials, vinyl has
the greatest rate of thermal expansion, which can
cause the seal of the window to break early. If this
does occur, vinyl windows cannot be fixed and must
instead be replaced.122

Fiberglass

Fiberglass is a newer product in windows, and many
contractors and suppliers have little experience with
it. According to the fiberglass industry, fiberglass is
an extremely strong material: three times stronger
than wood or wood composite and eight times

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

stronger than vinyl. It does not rust, rot, warp,
corrode, crack, or dent. It has the lowest thermal
expansion rate of all of the window types,
guaranteeing a tight seal. Fiberglass windows are
often Energy Star products. They come in standard
colors, can have a wood veneer, can be painted to
match any color scheme, and can be repainted.123
Both fiberglass and chemicals often used with
fiberglass also pose hazards to human health.124

Wood

Wood windows are traditional, and, as with siding,
wood creates the look that alternatives imitate. Wood
windows can be repaired and maintained so that they
are as energy efficient as vinyl windows.125 Wood is
also an easier material to work with for custom
window fits. The drawbacks of wood windows are
identical to wood siding: they require painting, may
rot, warp, become insect infested, condense, or be
damaged by moisture.126 They can also burn.
Although wood windows do not expand at the rate
that vinyl does, they do expand quite a bit more than
fiberglass or even aluminum.127

Many wood frames that are replaced by vinyl could
have easily been repaired and, with weather stripping,
can become as energy efficient as vinyl windows.
Repairing wood windows may be a better alternative
to retain the historical character of a building and to
cut down on waste.128 For historic renovation,

repairing wood windows or replacing them with new
wood windows is often the only option.

Aluminum

Aluminum windows are often used to comply with
building codes for three-story and higher residential
and commercial buildings.129 Aluminum is a strong,
durable material that does not rust and does not
normally require paint, although there are some
reports that the factory finish may wear off after
about 20 years, making painting necessary at that
point. Although aluminum has slightly higher thermal
expansion than fiberglass, it has less than the other
window products, ensuring a stronger and longer-
lasting seal.130 However, thermal breaks must be
added to aluminum windows to make them energy
efficient.

Costs

Window costs vary widely based on size, style, and
quality; few vendors offer precisely comparable
windows made of the full range of materials. One
California vendor quoted prices, as of late 2003, for a
6x4 foot window, of $190 in aluminum, $225 in
vinyl, $250 in fiberglass, and $300 in wood.131 As
with siding or other products, differences in
installation cost, maintenance and repair cost, and
lifetime could be more important than these
differences in purchase price.

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Employment Impacts of a PVC Phaseout

Replacing PVC with safer alternatives will change
some jobs: from fabricating PVC products to
fabricating the same products from other materials,
often other plastics; or from making vinyl chloride
monomer and PVC resin to making safer substitutes
(again, often other plastics). In many cases, the same
workers who currently make PVC products are likely
to be employed making similar products from PVC
alternatives.

More generally, the money that is now spent on PVC
products, the uses of those products, and the jobs
created by production and use of PVC will not
disappear from the economy in the transition to
alternative materials. The skills that are needed to
make many products out of PVC will still be needed
to make the same products out of something else;
there is no evidence that the substitutes would require
less labor or that resources spent on clean alternatives
create fewer jobs than resources spent on PVC.

Size of the Industry

It is surprisingly difficult to determine the total
number of workers who are employed in making
PVC and PVC products. Industry sources report that
there are 126,000 workers in PVC fabrication plants;
in addition, as explained below, we estimate from the
limited available data that there are 9,000 or fewer
workers making vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and
PVC resin.

The 1997 Economic Census, the source of the latest
available detailed government data on employment
by industry, reports that some 826,000 workers were
employed in plastic product manufacturing of all
types. However, most of that total is not broken down
by type of plastic or product.132 Industry sources
report even larger totals: according to the Society for
the Plastics Industry, there were 1.5 million workers
in the plastics industry and another 850,000
employed in upstream industries that supplied the
plastics industry in 2001.133 These figures refer to the
plastics industry as a whole; most plastics industry
workers are not involved with PVC.

Turning specifically to PVC and related activities,
another industry group, the Alliance for Responsible
Use of Chlorine Chemistry (ARCC), claims that there
are 482,000 workers in chlorine-related jobs. This
total includes 180,000 employees of dry cleaning

establishments, most of whom use perchloroethylene,
a chlorinated dry cleaning fluid.134 Aside from dry
cleaning, the core of the ARCC employment data
consists of two categories: 126,000 workers at PVC
fabricating plants, and 170,000 workers at chlorine-
producing and chlorine-using chemical plants.

Note that the chlorine-producing and chlorine-using
plants (which are combined in the ARCC
employment figures) are not all involved in the PVC
life cycle. Some of the plants are large, multi-product
chemical industry facilities with significant numbers
of workers making products unrelated to PVC or
chlorine. Among the chlorine-using plants, there are
enterprises making other products such as pesticides,
paper mill chemicals, solvents and dry cleaning fluid.
Plants involved in the PVC life cycle are a small
fraction of the chlorine-producing and chlorine-using
category recorded by ARCC. Our best guess,
explained below, is that no more than about 9,000
workers, and possibly fewer, are employed in
production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and
PVC resin.

The data for the US as a whole and for the eleven
states identified by ARCC as the industry leaders are
shown in Table 15. The PVC fabricating plants are
smaller and pay less, with a national average of 54
workers per plant and payroll of $27,000 per worker.
The chlorine-producing and chlorine-using plants are
larger and pay more, averaging 376 workers per plant
with a payroll of more than $45,000 per worker.

Yet another industry source, the Chemical Economics
Handbook, periodically publishes in-depth reports on
vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and PVC resin
production. The latest available reports appeared in
December 2000 for VCM, and September 2003 for
PVC.135 In 2000 there were 12 VCM plants in the
US, with the capacity to produce 17.4 billion pounds
of VCM, as shown in Table 16. Seven of the
facilities, accounting for more than half the capacity,
were located jointly with PVC plants owned by the
same company.

As of mid-2003, ten companies produced PVC resin
in the US at twenty locations, as shown in Table 17,
for a total capacity of 15.8 billion pounds. Three
other plants were idled by the recession, with an
additional capacity of 1.2 billion pounds.

Employment at these plants is not consistently
reported in any published source. Through website
searches and telephone inquiries we were able to
obtain employment data for 14 of the 20 facilities, as
shown in Table 17. These data vary in definition
from one plant to another.  In at least one case, an
important category of contractor employees was not
included. In some other cases, including the two
largest employment entries in Table 17 (the workers
at the Formosa and OxyVinyls Texas facilities), the
data include other workers as well as those making
PVC resin.

Since many facilities produce more than one product,
it is hard to avoid uncertainties in the delineation of
PVC employment. Nonetheless, using the figures in
Table 17 in the absence of better data, the plants
where we have employment data average 2.82
million pounds of PVC capacity per worker. If this
ratio applied to the other plants as well, total
employment in the plants that make PVC resin would
be about 5,600. Our guess is that this is, if anything, a
high estimate, although we are unable to produce a
better figure. 136

Marketing Research Report: Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resins (September, 2003).

We do not have separate employment data for VCM
production; in cases of joint production at the same
location, some VCM employment may be included in
our PVC resin employment estimate. The
Environment Canada study of chlorine-related
industries (discussed early in this report in connection
with the costs of alternatives) identifies one Canadian
plant where 200 workers were producing VCM, with
production of at least 4.71 million pounds per
worker. If this ratio applied to US VCM production
today, there would be about 3,700 workers making
VCM at the 12 facilities shown in Table 16 (some of
whom have already been included in our estimate of
PVC resin workers). Again, this is, if anything, too
high an estimate.137

Our estimates are therefore 5,600 or fewer workers
producing PVC resin, and 3,700 or fewer workers
making VCM, with an uncertain amount of double-
counting between the two categories. In sum, the
number of workers producing VCM and PVC resin is
roughly 9,000 or less. These workers are only a small
fraction of the much larger number of employees in
chlorine-producing and chlorine-using plants in Table
15. In addition, as shown in Table 15, there are

roughly 126,000 workers at PVC fabrication plants.
That is, most of the workers employed in PVC-
related industries are fabricators, not VCM/PVC
production workers.

Effects on PVC Workers

A complete PVC phaseout will not happen overnight.
But, over a period of years, it will change the jobs
that are performed in our economy. Many workers
will find themselves doing the same job with
different materials; for example, the same products
may be fabricated at the same plants, but out of
different plastics. As the momentum builds for a PVC
phaseout, the owners of fabrication plants will seek
actively to keep up with the changing market.

In many cases, plants with the capacity to
manufacture PVC products have the capacity to
manufacture alternative products as well, although
different equipment may be required. For example,
the PVC Container Company manufactures plastic
bottles from both PVC and polyethylene
terephthalate (PET). According to a company
representative, PVC and PET bottles are made with
different equipment, but are manufactured at the

39

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

same facility.138 In other cases, PVC products
distributed within the US are fabricated overseas. For
example, the medical gloves discussed in the section
on medical supplies, above, are all manufactured in
Asia. Omni International gloves are manufactured in
countries including China, Malaysia, and Thailand;
High Five gloves are manufactured in either China or
Taiwan; and Kimberly Clark gloves are
manufactured in Thailand.139 Thus, switching among
the glove types we have discussed here would
apparently have no employment consequences within
the US. We did not investigate the effect on
employment in the producing countries; we did learn
that gloves produced for Kimberly Clark are
manufactured at a single plant, which has a separate
production area for each glove material and employs
different equipment for each type.

In the case of large PVC products, such as pipes,
equipment requirements may differ for production
using alternative materials. However, many
companies produce or use a diversified set of plastics,
so ceasing sales of PVC products would likely lead to
a shift within the company, not putting the company
go out of business. As mentioned above, for example,
J-M Manufacturing has recently diversified to begin
producing PE in addition to PVC pipe. Another
interesting example is Westlake Chemical
Corporation, a vertically integrated company that
produces both VCM and PVC while also producing
alternatives, including polyethylene. Westlake’s
fabricated products include both PVC and
polyethylene pipe, among other products.140 In a
similar vein, CertainTeed Corporation produces a
variety of PVC products, but also produces fiber
cement siding, one of the promising alternatives to
vinyl siding.141 While the employment practices of
such companies will vary from case to case,
corporate diversification creates the possibility of
retaining and reassigning workers when PVC is
phased out.

Workers who make VCM and PVC resin would not
necessarily be out of work if PVC is phased out: in
many cases PVC will be replaced by other
petrochemical products, such as non-chlorinated
plastics or synthetic rubber, which may be made by
the same companies or in the same communities that
now make VCM and PVC. Thus there will be new
jobs to be filled making the alternative materials,
which current VCM and PVC workers could well
perform.

At the same time, it is possible that some workers
will not find jobs making the alternatives. Even if the
old jobs are replaced with new ones, the labor market

does not automatically move the displaced workers
into the new positions. The threat of some job
turnover is not unique to the question of chemical
phaseouts; rather, it occurs with any large-scale
policy shift.

The changes that would result from a PVC phaseout
are not large relative to the ongoing turnover of
employment in the US economy. Jobs are constantly
being eliminated, and other jobs created, in enormous
numbers. In the 12-month period from August 2002
through July 2003, when total US employment
decreased by 170,000 jobs, there were actually
48,150,000 new hires and 48,320,000 separations
(quits, retirements, layoffs, and firings).142 In
manufacturing alone, which was particularly hard hit
in the same period, losing just over a million jobs,
there were 4,000,000 new hires and 5,020,000
separations. That is, in addition to the net loss of a
million manufacturing jobs, there was turnover of
another four million jobs—an average turnover of
11,000 manufacturing jobs per day, every day of the
year. If every job in VCM and PVC resin production
were replaced by a different job producing substitute
materials in a different plant, this would amount to
less than one day’s average turnover of US
manufacturing employment.

Nonetheless, the replacement of jobs in VCM and
PVC production with jobs in other industries could
impose a real burden on the affected workers (just as
employment turnover of all sorts frequently does). If
substitute materials are produced at the same or
nearby locations, the displaced workers could be
offered employment in the plants making the new
materials; but this may not solve the entire problem.
Providing protection and support for workers who
lose their jobs is an inescapable problem of public
policy, both for the small numbers who may be
affected by health and environmental policies such as
a PVC phaseout and for the much larger numbers
who are affected by business-oriented “free trade”
schemes, budget cutbacks, management errors,
marketing failures, and other ongoing sources of
turmoil in the market economy. One interesting and
ambitious policy option for displaced workers, the
Just Transition blueprint developed by a coalition of
labor and environmental leaders, sounds utopian in
the US political context, but is actually more modest
than similar programs that exist in Europe today.143

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Steps Toward Alternatives

Many steps have already been taken in the direction
of reducing and ultimately eliminating the use of
PVC. In this final section we examine three areas
where movement away from PVC can already be
seen: public policy initiatives in the US and around
the world; industry initiatives, including those by
auto companies and other leading manufacturers; and
a small sampling of the numerous “green building”
initiatives in the US. In the first two areas, we rely
heavily on an extensive review published by
Greenpeace.

Policy Initiatives to Phase out PVC 144

Here we provide a brief overview of forward-looking
policies, initiatives, and strategies that have been
adopted by communities, governments, and
professional organizations concerned about the health
and environmental hazards associated with PVC
production, use, and disposal. These efforts include
laws, policy statements, strategic plans, and other
government initiatives.

US State and Municipal Policies

A number of municipal governments in the US have
adopted policies on PVC products. For example,
Rahway, New Jersey, prohibits the use of PVC or
polystyrene in retail food establishments, requiring
the use of degradable packaging. Lake in the Hills, an
Illinois town, has banned the use of PVC pipes in
construction, due to a variety of practical and safety-
related concerns, including worker exposure to glues
and solvents during installation. In California, the
city of Oakland and Marin County have passed
resolutions encouraging the use of PVC-free
materials and the use of PVC alternatives in health
care institutions, with a long-term goal of phasing out
PVC products from health care entirely. Glen Cove,
New York, has banned PVC use in eating utensils or
food containers in all city food retailers.

A number of states and municipalities have adopted
policies on dioxin emissions, some of which include
specific references to PVC. San Francisco, Oakland,
and Berkeley, California have adopted resolutions to
eliminate dioxin, including PVC use reduction as part
of a broader strategy. The Rhode Island Department
of Environmental Management has adopted a
regulation to reduce PVC materials in the waste
stream by 50 percent by 2003. New Hampshire has

adopted a policy to cut dioxin emissions; the policy
specifically discusses use, disposal, and labeling of
PVC. Boston has recently adopted a dioxin reduction
purchasing resolution that could lead to a reduction in
use of PVC products.

Canada

Canada has banned PVC in food packaging and has
initiated a public awareness campaign to urge parents
not to purchase such toys for small children. British
Columbia has made a commitment to the long-term
goal of encouraging hospitals to replace PVC with
safer materials. The Toronto city government places
restrictions on the disposal of PVC products.

US Health Care Organizations

A number of US health care institutions and
professional societies of health care providers have
adopted resolutions encouraging the elimination of
PVC and other products that are important
contributors to dioxin formation. The American
Public Health Association (APHA) has adopted
resolutions to phase out dioxin contributors in
medical waste, including PVC products. The Chicago
Medical Society, the California Medical Association,
and the Minnesota Medical Association have adopted
resolutions to investigate PVC alternatives as a
means to reduce dioxin emissions from medical
waste. The American Nurses’ Association and the
American Medical Women’s Association recommend
the reduction of dioxin emissions from medical
waste. The member hospitals of the Maine Hospital
Association have all committed to continuously
reducing the use and disposal of PVC plastic,
prioritizing disposable health care and office products
as a first step.

The annual CleanMed conference brings together
researchers, product vendors, health care purchasers,
and others to exchange information on safer health
care technologies and to promote the development of
healthy markets in these products.145

Europe

Sweden was the first country to propose general
restrictions on the use of PVC in 1995; restrictions
have been enforced since 1999, and the country is
working toward discontinuing all PVC uses.

41

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Denmark created a policy in 1996 urging the
phaseout of PVC use after the failure of a 1991
voluntary PVC recycling program. One local
community in Denmark has restricted the sale of
PVC and latex toys and has committed to the
reduction of PVC use in hospitals and other
institutions. Denmark’s Grenaa Hospital has been a
world leader in the elimination of PVC, having
started a program to replace PVC with safer
alternatives as early as 1988. Germany has banned
the disposal of PVC in landfills as of 2005, is
minimizing the incineration of PVC, and is
encouraging the phaseout of PVC products that
cannot easily be recycled. Since 1986 at least 274
communities in Germany have enacted restrictions
against PVC. The government of the Netherlands has
created a policy that requires the use of alternative
products for those that have no feasible recycling or
reuse system.

Spain’s government created a goal in 1995 of
reducing PVC packaging by 20 percent by 2000. A
number of cities in Spain have developed restrictions
on the use of particular PVC products. In addition, 62
cities in Spain have signed on to a “PVC free”
agenda, which declares that they will phase out all
PVC food packaging and discontinue use of PVC
construction materials in government and
governmentally funded buildings. In Austria, a
number of regional governments have initiated
policies that restrict the use of PVC. The capital of
Luxembourg recommends that no new PVC piping
shall be put in the sewage systems. In Norway, the
capital city, Oslo, decided in 1991 to phase out use of
PVC in all public buildings. A number of local
governments in the United Kingdom have adopted
policies to avoid use of PVC windows, and the
community of Newhaven has adopted a policy to
become entirely PVC free, unless PVC alternatives
cannot be procured at a reasonable cost. The Czech
Republic has adopted policies to ban the use of PVC
food packaging after 2008.

In addition to the policies developed by countries and
municipalities, public transportation and utility
systems in many countries require the use of PVC-
free materials. Public subway and rail systems in
Austria, Germany, Spain, and the UK all prohibit the
use of PVC cables. The German railways go one step
further and avoid the use of any PVC materials.
Additionally, water, sewer, and gas companies in the
UK are also not using PVC pipes in new or
replacement projects.

A number of regulatory initiatives have focused on
PVC toys, due to the threat of harm to children if

they suck or chew on soft plastic toys. Certain PVC
toys and other PVC products for small children have
been banned in the European Union as a whole since
1999. Bans on the use of PVC for soft toys have been
adopted in many European countries, as well as in
other countries including Argentina, Mexico, the
Philippines, Tunisia, and the Fiji Islands.

Asia/Pacific

Japan passed a law requiring manufacturers to
recycle all packaging material by 2000 in order to
reduce dioxin emissions; in response, many
manufacturers have switched to non-PVC packaging.
Japan has also adopted a policy that limits the use of
PVC sheathing in cables used in all governmental
and public buildings. An ordinance was also
amended to restrict the use of PVC containing toxic
additives in cooking utensils and baby toys. Many
cities in Japan have adopted, although not necessarily
implemented, bans either on all PVC products or on
particular PVC products. Singapore has legislated
that PVC coated cables are hazardous waste and
therefore bans their import under the Basel
Convention on Hazardous Waste.

Industry Initiatives 146

Recognizing the health and environmental reasons to
reduce PVC use, and the feasibility of alternatives,
many industries—including some very big ones—
have begun to shift away from PVC.

Automobiles. A number of car manufacturers have
made strong commitments to reducing the use of
PVC in their products, often citing environmental,
health, and engineering reasons. European
manufacturers have taken many steps in this
direction. For example, Peugeot in France is reducing
PVC use in the interior and exterior of its cars as a
way to prevent recycling problems. A number of
German car manufacturers have sharply reduced
PVC use. Daimler-Benz stopped using PVC in
underbody coating and in the interior of all cars as of
1995 and planned to ultimately phase out all PVC
use. Opel, the European subsidiary of General
Motors, and Mercedes Benz also do not use PVC in
car interiors. BMW has adopted material
specifications that express a preference for
dashboard, trim, and wire coating materials other
than PVC, and offers PVC-free dashboards.

Japanese car manufacturers have also taken concrete
steps toward reducing PVC use. For example,

42

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Daihatsu Motor Company has established a PVC
reduction policy, reducing PVC use in instrument
panel padding, roof linings, side moldings, side
window linings, the soundproofing component of
dashboards, and door trim. The company is
investigating ways to reduce PVC use further in side
windows, roof fabric, floor undercoating, and wire
harness coating. Hino Motors is considering PVC
alternatives in truck and bus interiors, exteriors, and
wiring systems. Honda made a commitment to
replacing PVC interiors by 2003. Mitsubishi is
working to substitute PVC in instrument panels and
door trim surfaces and already is using alternatives
for roof linings and sheet materials. Nissan began
using alternatives to PVC in cables in 1997 and is
using PVC alternatives for instrument panels, door
trim, and side guard moldings and harnesses. Suzuki
Motor Corporations is increasing its use of substitutes
for PVC, and Toyota has developed PVC alternatives
for car interiors and bumpers.

In the US, the world’s largest auto manufacturers
have also committed to reducing PVC use. General
Motors eliminated PVC from its interiors in 1999.
The 2000 Pontiac Bonneville used a PVC-free
material for the full instrument panel for the first time
in North America. Ford has set the target of
eliminating the use of PVC by the model year 2006
for all of its plants worldwide and is instructing its
suppliers to design vehicles using more recycled
content and plastics that are easy to recycle. A
number of US auto suppliers have begun their own
initiatives to remove PVC and have started by
removing it from interior panels, instrument panels,
integrating skin, substrate, reinforcing beams, and
batteries.

Food Packaging and Water Bottles. The use of PVC
in food packaging has been the source of
considerable concern in Europe. PVC food packaging
is no longer used in Austria, due to measures taken
by Austrian supermarket chains in the early 1990s.
Carlsberg Italia, the Italian unit of the Danish beer
company, has discontinued its use of PVC caps. A
number of water bottling companies in Europe have
also stopped using PVC in their bottles, including
Nestlé brands, Spa, and Evian. In Spain, thirty-six
water bottling companies including Danone and
Perrier are phasing out PVC.

In the US, Federated Group, Borden Cremora Non-
Dairy Creamers, and Eagle Family Foods have
converted to PVC-free packaging for their creamers;
Dean Foods is replacing its milk containers with
PVC-free packaging; VegiWash has eliminated the
use of PVC in its fruit and vegetable wash bottles;
and Planters has eliminated its use of PVC bottles for
peanut oil.

Hospital Initiatives. Grenaa Central hospital in
Denmark has phased out 95 percent of its PVC use.
The Glanzing pediatric clinic in the Wilhelminen
Hospital in Vienna became the first Neonatal unit in
the world to announce in 2003 that it will cease to use
PVC products for invasive uses, although some
products for non-invasive uses do not yet have a PVC
alternative.147 Glanzing has also introduced PVC-free
products in construction, as well as for overshoes,
gloves, bed mattresses, and aprons.

In the US, Universal Health Services, the third largest
hospital management company, and Tenet Healthcare
Corporation, the second largest for-profit health care
company, are actively looking to replace PVC
medical supplies. Four medical supply purchasing
organizations—Broadlane, Consorta Inc, Premier Inc,
and Novation—have all committed to reducing the
procurement of PVC products and have urged their
members to do the same.148

The shift to PVC-free medical care products is
facilitated by new technological developments. For
example, the Japanese company Terumo has begun
manufacturing PVC-free dialyzing fluid bags made
from polypropylene and has developed a new
polypropylene material for continuous ambulatory
peritoneal dialysis; McGraw Inc supplies PVC-free
IV bags in the US; and Saint-Gobain Performance
Plastics has recently developed an alternative to PVC
for medical tubing.149

Shoes. Nike began to phase out PVC in its products
in 2001, and currently advertises several PVC-free
footwear models. Nike’s website showcases several
PVC-free shoe brands, which are labeled with Nike’s
new environmentally sound logo.150 Other
manufacturers, including Adidas, Asics, and Puma,
are also in the process of phasing out PVC in
shoes.151

In Brazil, the agricultural food manufacturer Cargill
no longer uses PVC bottles for its Liza soybean oil
brand. In Japan, Nihon Suisan Kaisha has converted
to PVC-free packaging for its sausages, and Kagome
Company has converted to PVC-free packaging for
all household products.

Electronics. Sony states in its 2003 Corporate Social
Responsibility Report that the company is working to
reduce PVC in all its products by the end of 2005.152
Sony now has PVC-free headphone cords, speaker
boxes, and disk drives on the market.153 Recently,
Sony released two products in the Tokyo market that

43

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

replace PVC with the corn-based polymer polylactic
acid (PLA): a DVD player and AIBO, a robotic
pet.154 Toshiba is currently working to phase out the
use of halogenated compounds, including PVC, from
its circuit boards.155

Furniture. The Swedish furniture retailer IKEA,
well-known across Europe and the United States,
started phasing out PVC use in September of 1992.
To date IKEA has eliminated PVC from all furniture,
and plans to phase out PVC in its lamp wiring by
2006.156

Retailing. Marks and Spencer, one of the largest
retailers in Great Britain, pledged in 2001 to phase
out the use of PVC in its products, focusing initially
on food packaging.157

Innovative Construction Projects

There has been an explosion of interest in
environmentally sound construction in the US in
recent years. A wealth of information on green
building initiatives, including many case studies of
individual building projects, is available through the
US Green Buildings Council. Initiatives showcased
by the council address a range of environmental and
health concerns, including energy efficiency,
environmentally sound management of wastes, and
creating buildings with good indoor air quality. 158

The Healthy Building Network (HBN) provides a
clearinghouse of information and contacts on PVC-
free and other environmentally preferable building
practices. HBN has also collected case studies of
building initiatives that have used safe construction
materials, including a number of health care
institutions that have undertaken green building
projects. To cite just one example, Beth Israel
Medical Center in New York City completed a set of
interior renovations in 2000. Among other steps to
ensure environmental safety and protect indoor air
quality, Beth Israel excluded PVC from its
construction and furniture specifications.159

In this section, we highlight just a few of the growing
number of innovative construction projects in which
special efforts have been made to choose materials
that are safe for human health and the environment,
while keeping costs low. All of the examples
discussed here have reduced or eliminated the use of
PVC.

GreenHOME, a volunteer group, partnered with the
Washington, DC chapter of Habitat for Humanity to

design and build a low-income home that is energy
efficient and built from materials that are safe for
human health and the environment.160 The purpose of
the project was to demonstrate that green building is
not only an option for luxury homes; it is equally
possible for home builders on a budget. After
exhaustive research on materials, the group
constructed a home whose total cost was $75,000.

The GreenHOME house is not 100 percent free of
vinyl, but the use of vinyl was kept to a minimum.
The windows of the house are vinyl-clad wood and
cost $264 each. The siding is Hardiplank (a fiber
cement product), purchased at $0.55 per linear foot,
for a total cost of $2,534. For flooring, the project
used salvaged wood floors for living room areas and
natural linoleum for the kitchen. The total cost of
flooring was $4,221. For roofing, the material of
choice was 100 percent recycled aluminum shingles,
at a cost of $1,464.

Another good model of green building on a budget is
the Erie Ellington Homes project in Dorchester,
Massachusetts.161 Developed by the Codman Square
Neighborhood Development Corporation with
technical assistance provided by the Hickory
Consortium (Bruce Hampton, AIA, architect), this
project includes fifty high-energy-efficiency housing
units. The builders used fiber cement clapboards
instead of vinyl and high-quality recycled content
aluminum clad wood windows instead of vinyl clad
windows.

One goal of the project was to provide safe homes for
children and adults with asthma, by avoiding building
materials that are associated with air quality
problems. Although not definitive, early results
suggest that the project has had some success in this
regard; interviews with new residents have shown
that symptoms were noticeably reduced in 8 out of 18
asthma sufferers.

To save money, the project used vinyl composite tile
in some public areas, such as common halls and
stairs; these were selected as areas in which
outgassing of phthalates would be least likely to
affect occupants. For some other areas the project
used alternative flooring products, including
linoleum.

Both the Erie Ellington project and the GreenHOME
project used Hardiplank, a durable fiber cement
siding product that requires very infrequent painting.
The GreenHOME project estimates that the
Hardiplank siding will require painting "every 15 to
20 years, compared to every 5 to 10 years for wood

44

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

siding in the Washington, DC climate."162 Managers
of both projects seem to have been relatively satisfied
with Hardiplank. The principal disadvantage of the
material for the GreenHOME project, which relied
largely on volunteer labor, is that Hardiplank is
somewhat more difficult for volunteers to work with
than vinyl. The project report notes that cutting the
planks created large amounts of dust, so that
volunteers had to wear filtration masks. Dust would
have been reduced if the project had used special
tools for cutting the Hardiplank, but these tools were
out of the price range of the project. In addition,
because it is more dense than wood, the Hardiplank
siding was more difficult to nail into place than wood
siding would have been. The GreenHOME project
report concludes that overall, "these problems were
minor and acceptable."163

The Sheraton Rittenhouse Square Hotel in
Philadelphia advertises itself as an “environmentally
smart hotel.”164 The hotel has wallpaper with a water-
based finish instead of vinyl wall coverings.
Carpeting in the hotel does not have a PVC base. For
flooring in non-carpeted areas, the hotel has used
natural linoleum instead of vinyl tile. The hotel
plumbing includes no PVC pipe.

Barry Dimson, co-owner of the hotel, has made the
economic case for building environmentally sound
hotels in a series of articles. He argues that up-front
costs for building an environmentally sound hotel,
using safe building materials, are not significantly
different from the cost of building a "traditional"

hotel, where air quality may be poor due to mold and
off gassing from PVC and other building materials.
Dimson notes that an estimated 20 percent of total
project cost in the construction of a new hotel is land
acquisition, and around 55 percent is “the 'hard' cost
of construction, with 'soft' costs such as carrying
charges and design fees comprising the remaining 25
percent.” If half of the “hard cost” of construction is
dedicated to excavation, foundations, and
superstructure, then just half the construction cost is
dedicated to “the building's 'skin,' mechanical
equipment, [and] building materials.” This 27.5
percent is the portion that is affected by green
building considerations. Thus, argues Dimson, “even
if [green building materials] cost 10 percent more up
front, 10 percent of 27.5 percent represents a
premium of [just] 2.75 percent over the total cost.”165

Green building was prioritized in construction of a
new building for Adat Shalom, a synagogue in
Bethesda, Maryland.166 Among other choices, the
community chose to use cork instead of vinyl
flooring wherever possible. Since finishing
construction of the new building, members of Adat
Shalom have been working with others to spread
knowledge of best practices for green buildings in
religious communities. The “Building in Good Faith”
initiative, launched by filmmaker Judith Helfand and
religious leaders, asks faith-based institutions to
reduce their purchasing and use of toxic building
materials, particularly those made from PVC.167

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Conclusion

PVC has become universal, used in every area of
modern life. It is said to be cheap, convenient, safe,
and maintenance free. Our review of the evidence
finds that the advantages of PVC are often
overstated—it is a little cheaper than the alternatives
in some areas, but no bargain at all in others.  Our
analysis offers four categories of responses to the
economic argument for PVC:

•

•

•

•

It is not always cheaper on a life-cycle cost
basis, as in flooring.
The alternatives will become cheaper over
time, due to economies of scale and learning
curve effects.
The use of PVC products often poses health
and safety hazards, as in medical supplies.
The costs of environmental protection and
improvement are routinely overstated in
advance.

In our look at specific markets, we found that less
toxic alternatives are successfully competing with
PVC in many pipe applications, in single-ply roofing,
in flooring on a life-cycle cost basis, and in medical
supplies due to growing concerns about the health
hazards of PVC. In siding and windows, among the
fastest-growing vinyl markets of recent years,
promising new alternatives have appeared.

The employment effects of a transition to alternative
materials may be modest. PVC will be replaced by
other materials that also require labor; workers will
still be needed to make the substitute products. In
some cases, the same factories and workers may
fabricate the same products from new materials.

There are policy initiatives at every level,
internationally and within the US, calling for
reduction and restriction of PVC use. Major
industries are beginning to substitute less toxic
materials for PVC throughout their product lines. The
rapidly growing “green building” movement has
created numerous successful examples of the use of
safer alternatives materials; the few examples
described here are only a sample of the encouraging
diversity of approaches emerging in the construction
industry today.

Our review of PVC uses and alternatives makes it
clear that a PVC phaseout is achievable and
affordable. The alternatives are increasingly well
known and well developed, and in many cases are
already cost-competitive with PVC. It is realistic and
practical to build health and environmental
considerations into materials choice for municipal
infrastructure, commercial and residential building,
medical supplies, and consumer products. The cost
impacts of substitution will be modest, and will grow
smaller over time.

19 The adjustment is that Table 2 omits Hickling’s data on windows; Hickling estimated that implausibly large
savings were available from replacing PVC windows with aluminum windows. Thus our adjustment increased the
Hickling cost estimate for replacing PVC.
20 These are purely hypothetical numbers for illustrative purposes, not real data. In reality, of course, ceramic plates
often last much more than a year, increasing their attractiveness relative to paper plates.
21 LCAs frequently emphasize energy use, carbon dioxide emissions, and criteria pollutants, since these categories
are often better documented than toxic emissions. For a comparative analysis of recent LCA studies of PVC,
highlighting their differences in data coverage, see Eric Copius Peereboom, Rene Kleijn, Saul Lemkowitz, and Sven

25 Brian W. Arthur, an economist at the Santa Fe Institute, has argued that many of society's important economic and
technological choices are “path dependent.” A technology that, perhaps accidentally, gains a slight lead early in its
history may be able to solidify that lead by gaining market share and lowering prices, “locking out” other
technologies that may be equally or more efficient if adopted on a large scale. The Windows operating system, the
standard videocassette format, the dominant nuclear reactor design, and the gasoline-powered automobile engine,
for example, all started with only small leads over equally (or more) attractive rival technologies; all have come to
be “locked in” and dominate their markets through the path-dependent process that Arthur describes. See Brian W.
Arthur, Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1994).
26 Our calculation from the graph in Peter H. Spitz, Petrochemicals: The Rise of an Industry (New York: John Wiley
and Sons, 1988), p.415.  Spitz presents separate graphs of cumulative production vs. price for PVC and copolymers,
for value added by polymerizer, and for vinyl chloride monomer.  In these three graphs, a doubling of cumulative
production is associated with price declines of 34 percent, 31 percent, and 40 percent, respectively.

relatively high volatile organic compounds (VOC) levels of 600 g/l and 760 g/l. According to CMPBS, many PVC
cement products are made from tetrahydrofuran (THF) and cyclohexane; manufacturers of THF recommend varying
exposure limits, in one case as low as 25 parts per million for an 8- and 12-hour time-weighted average; and
individuals with preexisting diseases of the lungs or liver may have increased susceptibility.

136 It seems likely that the employment data in Table 17 err more often in the direction of including too many
workers, such as those who make other products at the same plants. The one obvious case of incompleteness in the
other direction, underestimating employment, seems smaller by comparison. If too many workers are counted in
Table 17, then the true average productivity—pounds of PVC per worker—is higher than our estimated 2.82 million
pounds per worker, and the number of workers needed to produce the entire industry output is lower than 5,600.
Further support for the guess that the industry has higher productivity, and hence lower total employment, than our
estimates can be found in Environment Canada’s study of chlorine-related industries in Canada in 1993. That study
describes three PVC resin plants, with an average capacity of 3.14 million pounds per worker. If there have been
advances in productivity since 1993, the capacity per worker should now be even higher. See Environment Canada,
“A Technical and Socio-Economic Comparison of Options to Products Derived from the Chlor-Alkali Industry”
(1997), Chapter 9.
137 The 200 workers were also producing a larger quantity of EDC, a VCM precursor; some of the EDC was
exported, and some was used to produce VCM. Thus the workers’ actual productivity was higher (and estimated US
labor requirements per million pounds of VCM should be lower) than the numbers presented in the text.

Plant-based polymers can be produced sustainably in principle and do not require genetic engineering for their
