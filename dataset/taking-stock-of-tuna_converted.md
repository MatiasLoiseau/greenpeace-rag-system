Introduction

Tuna is the world’s favourite fish. It can be found from
high-end sushi restaurants in Tokyo to family shopping
trolleys in North American supermarkets and the dinner
plates of Pacific island communities. With the world’s
appetite for tuna now greater than what our oceans can
sustain, tuna stocks globally are coming under pressure,
suffering from overfishing and in some cases reaching the
point of collapse.

The situation is not the same for all tuna species or in all
oceans. Greenpeace is campaigning to restore tuna
stocks to a healthy state, and marine reserves in the
Pacific and Mediterranean high seas are an important step
towards achieving this. For some species - bluefin tuna for
example - overfishing has reduced stocks to as low as 5%
of their natural levels, and a sustainable fishing industry is
no longer possible. In oceans such as the Pacific, where
overfishing is a more recent problem, a halving of fishing
effort would be enough to ensure a future for the region’s
tuna fisheries.

It’s not just the amount of tuna we’re catching,
but also how it is being caught that adds to the problem.
Industrial fishing methods such as longline fishing and
purse seining with fish aggregating devices (FADs) to
attract the fish, and the use of planes and helicopters to
locate the fishing grounds, are putting excessive pressure
on tuna stocks. Longline fishing can have a discard rate as
high as 40% (for large long-range boats) and kill
endangered sharks, turtles, birds and cetaceans. FADs
also create a wide range of problems. Purse seining with
FADs catches many tuna, like yellowfin and bigeye, before
they breed. In addition, there is a bycatch of a vast array of
other marine life, such as endangered sea turtles (like the
olive ridley, green, leatherback, hawksbill and
loggerhead), as well as sharks and other types of fish.

The current demand for tuna is not sustainable.
So what must we do to take tuna out of the can?

Restaurants cannot continue to serve bluefin tuna as
fishing fleets chase down the last fish. Retailers should
no longer sell cheap canned tuna that masks a much
greater cost to ocean life and coastal communities.
Those trading in tuna must take responsibility for the
future of the world’s favourite fish, and for their own
industries, by seeking out tuna species and fishing
methods that are truly sustainable.

Since 2005, Greenpeace has been campaigning for
supermarkets to sell only sustainable seafood. This
work began in the UK. In following years, Greenpeace
offices from all over Europe, North America as well as
New Zealand and Australia joined the campaign. One
focus of our markets work has been on making retailers
move to using only sustainable and equitable tuna
sources.

‘Red lists’ of seafood species at very high risk of being
sourced from unsustainable fisheries, and guides to
supermarkets ranked according to the sustainability of
their seafood purchasing, have been key tools in
achieving this transition.

Alongside the ‘poster child’ bluefin tuna, other troubled
species such as yellowfin and bigeye tuna feature on
every single Greenpeace seafood ‘red list’.
Supermarkets in countries where the campaign has
been active have started to adapt their fish purchasing
policies. Many have developed sustainable seafood
purchasing guidelines and, as a minimum, most
companies have stopped selling a number of overfished
or destructively-fished species. Some retailers have
even removed all ‘red-listed’ products from their
shelves. UK retailers and Dutch wholesalers have been
leading the change on the market.

4 Greenpeace International: Taking Stock of Tuna

MARCH 2007
In the face of increased Illegal,
Unregulated and Unreported (IUU)
fishing globally and limited
resources by coastal states to patrol
their waters, Greenpeace launched
the world’s first database for all
known IUU fishing vessels and
companies. It was welcomed by the
international community as a useful
tool for port authorities and officials
worldwide in curbing pirate fishing,
and, since tuna operators are also
blacklisted, as a tool for retailers,
wholesalers and processors to help
them avoid IUU tuna,1.

SEPTEMBER 2007
Greenpeace exposed stolen Pacific
tuna in the European market mainly
fished by European owned and
controlled fishing vessels (for
example, Albacora Group,
Conservas Garavilla and
Calvopesca, all from Spain). As a
result, some European supermarket
chains removed these products from
their shelves. Several others started
working on ensuring they have
necessary traceability and checks in
place that will enable them to trade
only in legal and sustainable
products2.

APRIL 2008
80 activists from 15 countries closed
down the stands of five large tuna
suppliers at the European Seafood
Exposition in Brussels, the world's
largest seafood trading event, where
1,600 companies from 80 countries
trade marine life from all around the
globe. The activists covered the
stands with fishing nets, chained
themselves to the stands and put up
banners in 13 languages saying; 'Time and Tuna are running
out'. A large banner with the same message was hung from the
front of the building. A message was also broadcast through the
exhibition halls' public address systems urging traders to buy
only sustainably-caught seafood. Greenpeace’s message that “if
the industry doesn't shift towards sustainable seafood, there will
simply be no tuna left to trade, and their businesses will be closed
forever" is still reverberating throughout the industry today3.

AUGUST 2008
Greenpeace UK launched its
ranking of UK canned tuna brands.
Sainsbury’s pole-and-line caught
tuna leads the ranking list as the
most sustainable brand on the
market. Branded products from
John West and Princes are at the
bottom of the league. The race for
sustainability in the UK canned
tuna market became headline
news.

OCTOBER 2008
Greenpeace published “Plundering
the Pacific - How transhipping at
sea by Philippine fleets facilitates
the launder and plunder of West
and Central Pacific tuna”4. The
report provided a case study of
how IUU tuna from the Pacific ends
up on the European and US
markets, and how the pockets of
international waters in the Pacific
are used as a loophole to avoid
industry regulations.

JUNE 2009
Massive media coverage on
bluefin and canned tuna issues is
achieved in the UK on the back of
the launch of the film, ‘The End of
the Line’, a documentary about
the devastating effect of
overfishing using tuna as
a key example.

Line?

JULY 2009
Working with responsible sushi
restaurants in London
Greenpeace launched an online
pledge in the UK to boycott
bluefin tuna. By the beginning of
December 2009, 6,400
people had signed up.

APRIL 2009
Greenpeace published a “Retailers'
Guide to Sustainable and Equitable
Pole and Line Skipjack”5. This case
study highlighted the Maldivian
model of pole-and-line fisheries as a
sustainable model for markets to
look towards at the European tuna
conference in Brussels.

The same day, a ’pre-order petition‘ for pole-and-line skipjack tuna
was launched6. Its purpose is to encourage companies to
demonstrate that there is a market demand for sustainable and
equitable skipjack tuna products and, through that, to encourage
the development of sustainable and equitable pole-and-line
fisheries in the Pacific. Retailers, wholesalers, restaurants,
processors, traders and other commercial buyers interested in
seeking coastal states partners willing to develop pole-and-line
fishing operations are encouraged to sign up. Tuna traders from
the UK and the Netherlands signed up immediately.

SEPTEMBER 2009
Following the ‘pre-order petition’ launched in April
2009 Greenpeace ran a workshop in Papua New
Guinea (PNG) bringing together key market players
who signed up to the petition, Pacific stakeholders and countries
interested to develop such fisheries. As a result, the Forum Fisheries
Agency in the Pacific was officially tasked with the development of
pole-and-line skipjack fisheries in the Solomon Islands and PNG. By
the beginning of September 2009, 70 million cans of sustainable
pole-and-line tuna had been ’pre-ordered’.

In a workshop held by the Italian National Association for Fish Can
producers (ANCIT), Greenpeace presented the scientific data on the
state of yellowfin tuna stocks (the main species of relevance for this
industry) and the main limitations of the ‘maximum sustainable yield’
concept, which is the management approach currently applied to the
world’s tuna stocks. The workshop helped to open up a dialogue
with the industry. After months of silence and no replies to
Greenpeace’s requests on the issue, some of the main tuna cannery
industries in Italy decided to start collaborating.

Market actions taken on tuna
There is a movement towards sustainable sourcing
in tuna markets not just in the UK, but all over Europe and
North America. Here are some examples of significant market
developments on tuna by supermarkets worldwide:

Bluefin tuna
Northern bluefin is found in the northern half of the Atlantic Ocean,
the Mediterranean and the southern Black Sea. Its Southern
cousin is found in temperate and cold seas of the southern
hemisphere, but migrates to the tropics to spawn. All bluefin
species have very high market values, especially in the sushi
markets. It is now well-known that Southern and Northern Atlantic
bluefin are depleted and continue to be overfished. Pacific bluefin
is not yet officially considered to be overfished, but stock
assessments are poor and unreliable; it is thought to be declining
and suffering overfishing. It is also considered to be ‘very highly’
vulnerable7. High juvenile catch is a general problem, and purse
seiners setting on FADs and longlining for bluefin have bycatch
issues similar to those targeting other tuna species. Humane
Society International believes that the Southern bluefin fishery is
possibly responsible for the most significant impact on endangered
albatrosses - the fishery overlaps the distribution of 17 of the
world’s 24 albatross species.

Greenpeace is asking retailers and other seafood traders to stop
selling any bluefin tuna.

US supermarkets Ahold, Wegmans, A&P, Price Chopper, Publix,
Safeway, Target, Walmart and Whole Foods are no longer selling
bluefin.

Carrefour has stopped selling bluefin in Italy and Spain, and in
France from mid-2009. In France, it was preceded by Auchan,
another French supermarket chain that had already stopped selling
it in 2006. Carrefour’s Spanish subsidiary, Alcampo, stopped
selling it in 2008.

Germany's Kaiser's Tengelmann and Kaufland and Co-op in Italy
stopped in April 2007. The last supermarkets in the Netherlands
stopped sourcing bluefin in 2008, as did the Nordic supermarket
chain ICA (Royal Ahold), which has outlets in Norway, Sweden and
the Baltic States.

Bluefin tuna has also been the main focus of some targeted work
on up-market sushi chains in the UK and US. In particular,
Greenpeace has exposed the celebrity-favourite Nobu as an
unrepentant stockist of bluefin, and this has generated substantial
media coverage, in these countries and elsewhere. Even the UK
fisheries minister stated publicly that restaurants should not be
selling bluefin or other endangered species. Much of this media
and public attention has been closely linked to the UK release of
‘The End of the Line’.

6 Greenpeace International: Taking Stock of Tuna

Bigeye tuna
Bigeye tuna is a tropical and subtropical species found in the
Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. Bigeye tuna are in long-term
decline. All stocks except the Atlantic stock are considered
overfished, and catches of juvenile bigeye are a major problem for
stock recovery.

Bigeye fisheries have similar bycatch issues to other tuna fisheries.
They are mainly caught by longline fishing and purse seining.
Atlantic longline fisheries also impact upon bluefin tuna and
declining billfish stocks. Purse seiners setting on FADs have the
potential to cause serious problems particularly for juvenile bigeye.

Greenpeace is asking retailers and other seafood traders to stop
selling any bigeye tuna.

Publix in US has committed to delist bigeye tuna from its product
range.

In the Dutch market, there had been a rapid increase in sourcing
overfished tuna species when fresh and frozen steaks were
introduced. Since the start of Greenpeace's campaign in 2007,
however, the Dutch retail market has been kept free of bigeye tuna.

Tesco in the UK dropped the sale of bigeye tuna in 2006.

Publix in US
has committed to
delist bigeye tuna from
its product range.

Yellowfin tuna
Yellowfin tuna is found throughout the world’s tropical and
subtropical seas except the Mediterranean. Although all four
stocks are known to be declining, they are all being fished at a high
rate: in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and in the Indian Ocean yellowfin
are considered overfished, while the other two stocks are likely
being overfished.

60% of yellowfin are caught by purse seine, and an increasing
number of these are using FADs (e.g. between 30% and 40% of
seiners in the Indian Ocean). About 15% of yellowfin tuna are
caught by longline fishing.

Greenpeace is asking retailers and other seafood traders to stop
selling any yellowfin tuna.

A number of supermarkets in Germany have delisted yellowfin,
including Lidl, Aldi North and Aldi South. In the Netherlands many
supermarkets stopped sourcing fresh and frozen yellowfin tuna
steaks in 2008 and are replacing other unsustainable yellowfin tuna
products.

Walmart in the US is committed to delist fresh and frozen yellowfin
tuna and is working on the implementation. US retailer Target is
currently incorporating the sale of pole-and-line skipjack, as well as
domestic pole-and-line albacore into its inventory as a
replacement for much of its yellowfin tuna.

Overwaitea in Canada has ceased the sale of fresh and frozen
Yellowfin Tuna steaks after Greenpeace Canada released its
seafood red list and two reports on the seafood purchasing
practices of Canadian supermarkets.

Skipjack tuna
Skipjack stocks worldwide are generally considered to be in a
healthy state, although recently initial concerns over the status of
some of the stocks have started to emerge. In skipjack fisheries
there has been an increasing use of FADs since the early 1990s.

Greenpeace is asking retailers and other seafood traders to stop
selling skipjack tuna from fisheries involving significant amounts of
unwanted bycatch, like purse seine FAD fisheries and longline
fisheries, and, and is encouraging them to move to pole-and-line
caught tuna as the more sustainable and equitable alternative.

The Pret a Manger chain in the UK recently announced that it will
move over to pole-and-line caught tuna for its sandwiches. After
Greenpeace had contacted the company over several months, it
went public with the announcement following the launch of the
‘The End of the Line’ film in the UK. Pret a Manger is the first
sandwich retailer to make this shift, and this has been possible, at
least in part, because of the pioneering work by Sainsbury's and
the Co-op in securing reliable supplies of pole-and-line tuna.

Although already top of Greenpeace UK’s tuna league table,
Sainsbury’s has upped its game and increased the amount of
pole-and-line caught tuna on its shelves. 100% of its own-brand
tuna products (including the basic range) are caught by this
method, and it has now introduced a new branded pole-and-line
caught range; it is promoting the responsible sourcing of tuna in its
stores.

Marks & Spencer in the UK has announced that all of its canned
tuna will move over to pole-and-line caught sources, and is
currently phasing this in. In addition, it is the first retailer to take the
next step and extend this to all of its products containing tuna,
including sandwiches, salads and ready meals.

Waitrose in the UK has announced that it will introduce a new own-
brand range of canned tuna in the near future, which will be 100%
pole-and-line caught skipjack.

In 2009, the first pole-and-line caught canned skipjack (Deep Blue)
was sold in Dutch supermarkets. The cans featured improved
labelling, which included the catch method, common name and
the text ‘sustainably caught with lines - ecologically responsible
fishery’.

At present,
Spanish tuna
producers are
not members
of ISSF.

Where next?

Following increasing concerns raised over the
sustainability of tuna products with key market players,
including John West and Princess, the International
Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) was launched in
March 2009. The ISSF calls itself ‘a global partnership
among science, the tuna industry and the environmental
non-governmental organisation community’. Its mission is
to ’undertake science-based initiatives for the long-term
conservation and sustainable use of tuna stocks, reducing
by-catch and promoting ecosystem health’.

Most of the world’s largest tuna brands (Bolton Alimentari,
Bumble Bee Foods, LLC / Clover Leaf Seafoods, MW
Brands, Princes, Sea Value, StarKist,
Thai Union / Chicken of the Sea and TriMarine), as well as
WWF, are part of the ISSF. At present, Spanish tuna
producers are not members of ISSF.

Greenpeace welcomed the formation of ISSF when it
went public in April 2009. ISSF’s policies speak in favour
of science-based and sustainable management.
However, Greenpeace regards many of ISSF’s policies as
not sufficiently far-reaching to meet the objectives of
sustainable management and is disappointed by the level
of real action taken by ISSA member companies to ensure
the sustainability of the products their trade with to date.

Greenpeace is challenging members of the tuna industry
to follow the steps taken by responsible retailers – and to
take clear action towards trading only sustainable and
equitable tuna products. Greenpeace will continue to
watch and expose those companies who try to hide
behind words and promises or simply take no action at all.
