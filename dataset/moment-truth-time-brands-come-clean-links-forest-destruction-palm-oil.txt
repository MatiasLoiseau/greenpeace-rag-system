WOODS HOLE RESEARCH CENTER POLICY BRIEF

CRUNCH TIME  
FOR CLIMATE  
COMMITMENTS 
Immediate action worldwide to halt deforestation and restore 
extensive areas of natural forest is key to limiting climate change and 
biodiversity loss. Halting and beginning to reverse the destruction 
of the world’s forests for agriculture is the cheapest, quickest and 
most equitable option to stabilise the climate and buy time for a just 
transition to a low-carbon economy.4 However, although there is 
widespread agreement on the need for rapid and far-reaching action, 
political and corporate commitments are failing to translate into 
measurable results on the ground. 
Agricultural commodities such as palm oil continue to drive deforestation 
and emissions – and push endangered species like orangutans and tigers 
ever closer to extinction. Time is running out. Global brands must not 
walk away from the agreed milestone – an end to the link between 
deforestation and globally traded commodities by no later than 2020.  
In 2010, members of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) 
pledged to do their bit to protect forests and limit climate 
change, with a clear commitment to clean up global 
commodity supply chains by 2020.5 World governments, 
emboldened by this pledge and in the knowledge that 
stopping deforestation was the easiest and most cost-
effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
incorporated action to address forest destruction into the 
Paris Agreement on climate change as a key part of their 
strategy to mitigate global temperature rise.6 2020 targets 
for halting deforestation and biodiversity loss and for 
restoring degraded forests also figure in the United Nations 
(UN) Sustainable Development Goals, to be implemented 
by ‘all countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative 
partnership’ in order to eliminate poverty and ‘to heal and 
secure our planet’.7
Yet with less than two years to go until 2020, 
deforestation to produce commodities such as palm oil 
shows no sign of slowing down.8 Corporate commitments 
and policies have proliferated, but companies have 
largely failed to implement them. As a result, consumer brands, including those with ‘no deforestation, no peat, 
no exploitation’ (NDPE) policies, still use palm oil from 
producers that destroy rainforests, drain carbon-rich 
peatland and violate the human rights of workers and local 
communities – making their customers complicit in forest 
destruction, climate change and human rights abuses. 
At the start of 2018, Greenpeace International challenged 
16 leading members of the CGF to demonstrate their 
progress towards a clean palm oil supply chain. We called on 
them to disclose publicly the mills that produced their palm 
oil, and the names of the producer groups that controlled 
those mills. If disclosed, this information would show whether 
brands had forest destroyers in their supply chains. Eight CGF 
brands – Colgate-Palmolive, General Mills, Mars, Mondel ēz, 
Nestlé, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Reckitt Benckiser and 
Unilever – were prepared to hold themselves accountable 
prior to publication of this report. The others – Ferrero, 
Hershey, Kellogg’s, Kraft Heinz, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, 
PZ Cussons and Smucker’s – refused to reveal who produced 
their palm oil, thereby concealing the extent of their 
complicity in rainforest destruction.9

2
Brands have failed to clean up their supply chains 
– and the people and environment of palm oil-
producing countries are suffering the consequences. 
Decades of deforestation for plantations has created 
the ideal conditions for the raging forest and peatland 
fires – often deliberately set by companies clearing 
the land  – that regularly threaten the health of 
people across Southeast Asia and imperil our global 
climate.10 Exploitation of workers, including the 
use of child labour, remains endemic in the sector.11 
Meanwhile, Indonesia, at the heart of the industry’s 
expansion, has more threatened and endangered 
species than any other country on the planet, in 
many cases as a result of loss of habitat;12 leading 
conservationists now talk about when,  
not if, orangutans and other iconic species will 
become extinct.13 
Palm oil is a high-risk commodity. Palm oil traders 
(typically corporations that also have plantation 
interests) continue to allow oil from rainforest 
destroyers into their mills, refineries and distribution 
systems, and neither governments nor the main 
industry body – the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 
Oil (RSPO) – can currently be relied on to prevent 
producers from engaging in deforestation or clearing 
peatland. Accordingly, brands must adopt NDPE policies 
if they have not already done so, and take responsibility 
themselves for ensuring that the producer groups14 in 
their palm oil supply chains comply with those policies 
as soon as possible, and no later than 2020. Equivalent 
policies should be enforced across all their commodities. 
The first step towards achieving this is for each 
brand to publish a clear, time-bound plan, including 
an explicit commitment that by 2020, 100% of the 
palm oil it uses will come from producers whose entire 
operations have been verified as compliant with its 
NDPE policy – even if that means using less palm oil 
than it is using today.
Next, brands should open themselves up to public 
scrutiny by publishing complete lists of the mills and 
producer groups in their supply chains. Then they must 
take responsibility for investigating these producer 
groups to identify any that are clearing rainforests or 
peatlands, or exploiting workers or local communities. 
Brands must work with traders to get concession 
maps, and other data necessary to enable successful 
monitoring, into the public domain. Ultimately, brands 
and traders must exclude any producer that refuses to 
reform, even if the palm oil it is supplying to them comes 
from different concessions to those it is clearing. 
By 2020, a responsible brand should be able to 
demonstrate that all the palm oil it uses comes from 
reputable producer groups whose operations have 
been verified compliant with its NDPE policy. At the 
same time, brands should support the transformation 
of the entire industry by sourcing only from traders 
and other suppliers that can show that all the palm oil 
they sell comes from producers that have been verified 
compliant with NDPE standards.

ALAN KNIGHT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE,  
INTERNATIONAL ANIMAL RESCUE (IAR)
Palm oil offers brands a cheap vegetable oil that is well 
suited to industrial manufacturing processes. Over the last 
20 years, global demand has skyrocketed as companies 
reformulated their products to use palm oil instead of animal 
fats such as butter or other vegetable oils and fats.17 Today 
palm oil is the world’s most widely used vegetable oil.18 
Approximately half of all products on supermarket 
shelves now contain palm oil, including shampoos, 
cosmetics, chocolate, bread and spreads.19 Palm oil has also 
become a major component of biofuels: 46% of palm oil 
imported into the European Union is destined for biodiesel.20 
The industry’s growth is being stoked still further by new 
demand for byproducts: for example, the world’s largest 
processor of dairy products, Fonterra,21 has a joint venture 
with the world’s largest palm oil trader, Wilmar International, 
to supply animal feed made from palm kernel expeller (PKE), 
a byproduct of the palm kernel milling process.22
This explosion of global demand has fuelled the rapid 
expansion of the palm oil industry, particularly in Indonesia: 
since 1990, Indonesia’s palm oil production has increased 
more than fourteen-fold, and in 2005 it became the largest 
producer of palm oil in the world.23 In 2017, Indonesia 
produced 55% of the world’s palm oil; neighbouring Malaysia 
produced a further 30%.24Palm oil may be cheap, but the environment and 
the people of producer regions are paying the price. 
According to figures released by the Indonesian Ministry 
of Environment and Forestry (MoEF), around 24 million 
hectares of the country’s rainforest were destroyed 
between 1990 and 201525 – an area almost the size of 
the UK.26 In several years during the last decade, Indonesia 
officially surpassed Brazil as the country with the largest 
loss of rainforest,27 in spite of Indonesia having a much 
smaller total area of forest. The plantation sector – palm 
oil and pulp – is the single largest driver of deforestation 
in both Indonesia and Malaysia.28 The MoEF has reported 
year-on-year falls in net deforestation since 2015,29 but 
these are based on figures that perversely count newly 
planted industrial plantations as forest,30 and the ministry 
has not yet published full statistics or downloadable maps 
for 2015–2017, so the true extent of recent natural forest 
loss is not in the public domain. 
As they destroy the forest, the plantation industries 
are wiping out biodiversity. Deforestation for pulp and oil 
palm plantations has devastated lowland forests in Sumatra 
and Borneo, destroying vital habitat for tigers, elephants, 
rhinoceroses, orangutans and other endangered species. 
Scientists estimate that just two robust breeding populations 

6


7of Sumatran tigers are left in the wild.31 All three species of 
orangutan are now critically endangered; if the current rate 
of population decline continues they will be extinct within 
our lifetime. According to the latest assessment, Bornean 
orangutan numbers fell by over 50% between 1999 and 2015, 
with no more than 70,000–100,000 individuals remaining.32 
Over 69% of potential habitat for the Sumatran elephant has 
been destroyed within just one generation.33 The Sumatran 
rhinoceros is said to be ‘hanging on by a thread’34 with fewer 
than 100 left in the wild.35 
The destruction of rainforests is also a major source of 
greenhouse gases, making it a crisis with a truly global impact, 
while the illegal use of fire to clear land before planting has 
catastrophic public health effects at a regional scale. In July 
2015, devastating forest and peatland fires spread across 
large areas of Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. In addition to 
the resultant greenhouse gas emissions, the fires produced 
a haze that grounded flights and closed schools and offices 
across Southeast Asia, forcing millions of people to breathe 
toxic air for months on end. The World Bank calculated 
the cost of the disaster at US$16bn,36 while researchers at 
Harvard and Columbia Universities estimate that 100,000 people died prematurely from respiratory diseases linked to 
the haze.37 Such crises can be expected to recur, particularly 
in dry El Niño years, when fires spread more rapidly through 
drained peatland and the debris of recent deforestation and 
into surrounding still-forested areas.
Palm oil lobbyists talk up the sector’s contributions 
to Indonesia’s economy and present it as a lifeline to 
smallholder farmers. In reality, the economic benefits of the 
palm oil boom have fallen on the handful of already wealthy 
individuals that control the big plantation companies.38 By 
contrast, many of the costs have been borne by workers 
and communities. Social conflicts between local people and 
plantation companies – including many owned by major 
traders – are widespread, brutal and unresolved.39 Non-
governmental organisations (NGOs) and unions report that 
even plantations that have been certified as ‘sustainable’ 
often show signs of child labour and forced labour.40 
Workers in the palm oil industry are routinely exposed to 
hazardous pesticides, paid below the minimum wage and 
deterred from forming unions to seek redress41 – a far 
cry from the pictures of smiling plantation workers that 
dominate brands’ sustainability reports.OPPOSITE:

On the first day of the Cancun Climate Summit in 2010, 
the CGF acknowledged that deforestation for agricultural 
commodities is a major contributor to the global climate 
crisis, and made an an unequivocal commitment to eliminate 
rainforest destruction from palm oil and other high-risk 
commodity supply chains by no later than 2020.49 In 
September 2014, governments, traders, NGOs and brands 
signed the New York Declaration on Forests, thereby pledging 
their support for the goal of eliminating deforestation from 
the production of agricultural commodities such as palm oil by 
2020.50 By the end of 2016, 447 companies, including both 
brands and traders, had made public commitments to address 
deforestation in their supply chains.51 Some companies have 
enshrined these commitments into commodity-specific NDPE 
policies that also have explicit 2020 deadlines. 
2020 is now less than two years away. Yet much of the 
palm oil that brands (including those that have made such 
commitments) use in their products still comes from producers 
that are destroying rainforests. 
Part of the reason for this is that brands have outsourced 
much of the responsibility for implementing their NDPE policies 
to their suppliers, including global commodities traders such 
as Wilmar International, Cargill, Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) 
and IOI. Brands and NGOs told traders to adopt NDPE policies 
of their own and to screen their supply chains for destructive 
or exploitative palm oil producers. However, many brands 
have subsequently chosen to measure progress in terms of the 
percentage of their suppliers with NDPE policies, rather than in 
terms of successful implementation of those policies.
There is the world of difference between having a policy 
and implementing it. A more meaningful metric would report 
the share of palm oil supply that comes from producers whose 
operations have been verified as compliant with NDPE policies. 
In 2017, Greenpeace assessed the actions palm oil traders 
were taking to ensure that they were not buying from 
producers that were destroying rainforests, draining peatlands 
or exploiting workers and local communities.52 Although 
most traders had published NDPE policies, there were serious 
problems with their implementation: inconsistent standards, 
questionable enforcement and non-existent deadlines. Not 
only was the palm oil industry not working to the 2020 
deadline set by brands, it did not even have a common timeline 
for delivering a palm oil supply free from deforestation and 
other social and environmental harms.None of the traders that supply the world’s biggest brands 
with palm oil had any way to keep destructive growers out 
of their supply chains. They lacked adequate data and the 
monitoring systems needed to ensure that producers are not 
clearing forests or draining peatlands. Specifically, none of the 
traders required their suppliers to provide them with concession 
maps. Without these maps, it is almost impossible for traders 
to carry out the geospatial monitoring needed to determine 
which producers have stopped clearing rainforests across their 
operations and which have not. 
Instead, most traders admitted focusing on geospatial mill 
analysis, designed to detect deforestation near mills from 
which they source. This approach, which is promoted by 
implementation partners such as The Forest Trust (TFT) and 
ProForest, pays insufficient attention to the frontiers where the 
industry is expanding most rapidly. Producer groups frequently 
supply the market with palm oil from established concessions 
while simultaneously destroying rainforests to develop new oil 
palm plantations in frontier regions, such as Indonesian Papua 
and Papua New Guinea, that are far from their established 
operations. For monitoring to be comprehensive, companies 
need to be monitoring their suppliers at ‘group level’ – i.e. 
monitoring the operations of all producers within the parent 
groups to which each of their suppliers belong, including in 
concessions that are not yet productive. 
None of the traders assessed had a robust system to monitor 
all the producer groups in its supply chain at group level. Nor 
could they demonstrate a systematic approach to enforcing 
their policies. Indeed, traders regularly claimed to be unaware 
that the producers supplying them were responsible for forest 
destruction until NGOs brought it to their attention, and they 
then treated each breach as an isolated incident, with remedial 
measures decided on a case-by-case basis. 
Most traders publish so-called ‘grievance lists’ that detail 
breaches of their NDPE policies by suppliers. But these are 
incomplete, generally listing only cases identified through third-
party sources such as NGO reports, RSPO complaints or media 
articles, and omitting cases identified through traders’ own 
monitoring programmes. Moreover, in most cases traders appear 
to have engaged with the producers concerned for months or 
even years with little evidence of reform. Exclusion remains a 
tool of last resort. Supply chain data published by the traders 
themselves indicates that they have continued to trade palm oil 
from producers they know are destructive or exploitative.53

15CONFRONTING 
THE BRANDS 
WITH 
EVIDENCE
Throughout 2017, Greenpeace presented some of 
the world’s leading brands with a series of bulletins 
containing evidence of seven cases of producers 
violating traders’ and brands’ NDPE policies. 
Brands – and the traders that supply them – should 
have identified these producers through their own 
supply chain monitoring and taken steps to reform or 
exclude them. In each instance, most of the evidence 
we relied upon was already in the public domain: sources 
included NGO reports, complaints to the RSPO and 
international media articles. However, supply chain data 
from traders showed that palm oil from all but one of 
these destructive producers entered the global market 
in 2017 (the sole exception being POSCO Daewoo, 
whose plantations were not yet producing palm oil, 
although trade may now have started). Further, the lists 
of top suppliers disclosed by some brands indicated that 
there was wide market exposure to these problematic 
producers. Accordingly, Greenpeace asked each brand 
to confirm whether these producers were in its supply 
chain and to specify the corrective actions it had taken 
concerning them. 
Some brands refused to respond to our inquiry. 
However, every one of the brands that did respond 
confirmed receiving palm oil produced by one or more 
of the destructive producers. Taken together with the 
findings of other NGOs,54 which have also identified 
numerous producer groups involved in deforestation in 
brands’ supply chains, this suggests a systemic failure by 
brands and their suppliers to enforce their NDPE policies.
After Greenpeace had presented them with the 
evidence of the destruction caused by the seven 
producers in question, some brands did exclude one or 
more of them from their supply chains. But laudable as 
this response was, brands should not be reliant on NGOs 
to raise cases with them. Instead, they need their own 
systems to detect and exclude destructive producers 
from their palm oil supply chains.
Three of these producers – FELDA/FGV, Salim

MAPPING ANALYSIS 
FOR GREENPEACE OF 
DEFORESTATION IN PT 
TAA, 2015–2017. 
DEFORESTATION AND  
PEATLAND CLEARANCE
In April 2016, consultancy Aidenvironment published analysis 
indicating that FGV had cleared peatlands in two concessions in 
West Kalimantan, Indonesia: PT Citra Niaga Perkasa (PT CNP) 
and PT Temila Agro Abadi (PT TAA).62 Four months later, FGV 
published a sustainability policy pledging ‘no conversion of 
HCV [high conservation value] areas, peat soil, and/ or areas 
with High Carbon Stock (HCS)’.63 However, analysis of MoEF 
official landcover maps and satellite imagery indicates that 
FGV continued to clear forest and develop peatland in PT TAA 
until at least June 2017, despite its new policy. Regardless 
of the visual evidence, the company denied that this was 
deforestation, citing an unpublished independent assessment 
which it said had found ‘no deforestation of natural forest’ 
because the ‘natural forest has been completely destroyed 
by massive forest fires in the 1980’s and in 1997, and also by 
continuous logging operations by logging companies and by the 
local communities’.64
In January 2018 FGV published an action plan for restoring 
the cleared peatland, but it is not clear whether this involves 
restoration to forest or merely reversing drainage.65 At the 
same time, consultants Chain Reaction Research reported that 
development without HCV or HCS assessment had been going 
on in an FGV concession in Sarawak, Malaysia, since September 
2017. FGV applied a stop work order after it was challenged over 
the development, offering further evidence that the company’s 
sustainability policy exists only on paper unless it is forced to 
comply by other organisations.66
EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS AND 
WITHDRAWAL OF RSPO CERTIFICATION
In July 2015, the Wall Street Journal  published an in-depth investigation into FGV concessions in Malaysia, reporting 
workers’ claims that they were not paid for long periods, 
had their passports confiscated and were using hazardous 
chemicals without being given appropriate protective 
equipment.67 Following an RSPO investigation, FGV 
voluntarily surrendered certification for all 58 of its RSPO-
certified mills in May 2016.68 At the time of writing it has 
regained eight of these certificates.69 
LINKS TO GLOBAL TRADE
 
FGV has a joint venture with P&G, FPG Oleochemicals,70  
and is P&G’s top supplier of palm products.71
Between January 2016 and December 2017 (the most 
recently available trade data for all traders that provide 
such data), traders that received palm or palm kernel oil 
from FGV’s mills included Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), 
Bunge, Cargill, Fuji Oils, IOI, Keck Seng, Mewah, Musim 
Mas, Olam, Sime Darby and Wilmar.72 These traders all 
supply major brands. It is likely that other traders that do 
not have transparent mill-level traceability data on their 
dashboards (see footnote) were supplied with FGV oil 
during this period as well. 
Traders listed above whose grievance lists mention 
FELDA/FGV include Cargill73 (with four separate 
grievances since December 2015), IOI,74 Musim Mas75 
and Olam.76 Wilmar does not include FELDA/FGV in its 
grievance list,77 and ADM, Bunge, Fuji Oils, Keck Seng, 
Mewah and Sime Darby do not appear to have publicly 
available grievance lists. In addition to these, Apical’s 
grievance list includes two grievances against FELDA/FGV, 
in October 2015 and July 2017, with the current status 
given as ‘monitoring’; it is not clear if the absence of FGV 
oil in Apical’s traceability summaries represents  
a suspension of trade.78

Salim, holds a controlling interest in major Indonesian 
conglomerate Indofood, which includes agribusiness group 
IndoAgri and IndoAgri’s palm oil subsidiaries PT Salim 
Ivomas Pratama (PT SIMP) and PT PP London Sumatra (PT 
Lonsum – itself a subsidiary of PT SIMP).79 PT SIMP holds 
a landbank of over 360,000ha80 and the Salim Group also 
holds extensive palm oil concessions via other companies,81 
making it one of Indonesia’s largest plantation groups. 
While PT SIMP and PT Lonsum are RSPO members, other 
Salim Group palm oil companies are not, putting the Salim 
Group in breach of RSPO rules requiring membership at 
group level by March 2017.82

21DEFORESTATION
 
In February 2013, the Centre for Orangutan Protection filed 
an RSPO complaint against PT SIMP alleging destruction 
of orangutan habitat in the PT Gunta Samba Jaya (PT GSJ) 
concession in East Kalimantan.83 Indofood denied owning any 
share in PT GSJ, but more recent investigations by Greenpeace 
have shown clear links between PT GSJ and the Salim Group.84 
Another Salim Group concession, in West Kalimantan, has 
been shown to have cleared around 1,900ha of forest, mostly 
on peatland, between July 2015 and October 2017.85 The 
Salim Group also controls and has recently begun to develop 
an extensive landbank in Papua, much of which is mapped as 
primary forest.86
EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS  
AND CHILD LABOUR
A 2015 investigation by OPPUK, Rainforest Action Network 
and the International Labor Rights Forum into two PT Lonsum 
plantations in North Sumatra found evidence of a range of poor 
labour practices, including:
•  use of child labour
•  workers being paid below the minimum wage
•  workers using pesticides without proper safety equipment 
and in violation of RSPO Principles & Criteria 
• quota systems that encouraged increased use of informal 
workers (including workers bringing along their wives and 
children to help them meet their quotas).87
A subsequent independent audit for the RSPO confirmed 
many of the allegations.88 The complaint is still in the RSPO 
process at the time of writing, with PT Lonsum’s parent company 
IndoAgri repeatedly demanding more evidence but not providing 
any counter-evidence or plans to address the issues.89 
LINKS TO GLOBAL TRADE 
 
Between January 2016 and December 2017 (the most recently 
available trade data for all traders that provide such data), traders that received palm or palm kernel oil from IndoAgri mills 
and/or the Salim-associated PT GSJ included AAK, ADM, Apical, 
Bunge, Cargill, Fuji Oils, GAR, IOI, Musim Mas, Olam, Sime Darby 
and Wilmar.90 These traders all supply major consumer brands. It 
is possible that other traders that do not have transparent mill-
level traceability data on their dashboards received IndoAgri/
Salim Group oil during this period as well. 
As is often the case when producer groups obscure the full 
extent of their empire, it is unclear how traders are handling 
the Salim Group and what actions they are taking to address 
its noncompliance with their NDPE policies. Specifically, where 
sanctions have been applied, it is unclear whether they cover the 
whole group, or whether the trader is treating the part of the 
group that is publicly listed (i.e. the Indofood division) and the 
concession clusters that Indofood denies being associated with as 
separate entities, despite clear management overlap.91 
In its grievance list update of December 2017, IOI states 
that having listed a grievance against Indofood in September 
2016, in the following February it informed traders that supply 
it with IndoAgri oil that the company was non-compliant with 
its policy.92 Regardless, Salim Group palm oil continued to enter 
IOI’s supply chain from these traders as recently as September 
and October 2017.93 Apical also has Indofood/Salim Group 
in its grievance list and states that it has had no commercial 
relationship with the group since 2015,94 despite receiving oil 
from PT Lonsum at its Tanjun Balai refinery between April and 
June 201795 and its Sari Dumai Sejati refinery between October 
and December 2017.96 (Apical’s mill data omits PT Lonsum or 
IndoAgri ownership, suggesting that the company may not be 
monitoring procurement at the group level.) Cargill,97 GAR,98 
Musim Mas,99 Olam100 and Wilmar101 have IndoAgri/Indofood 
on their grievance lists, but updates do not indicate any trade 
suspension. Of the other traders listed above as receiving palm or 
palm kernel oil from IndoAgri mills and/or PT GSJ, ADM, Bunge, 
Fuji Oils and Sime Darby do not appear to have publicly available 
grievance lists.
PepsiCo and Nestlé have joint ventures with Indofood to 
manufacture their products in Indonesia.102 PepsiCo has recently 
announced that it has suspended sourcing palm oil from IndoAgri 
but is maintaining its business relationship with Indofood.103

23DEFORESTATION  
IN KALIMANTAN
Glenealy operates PT Tunas Borneo Plantations (PT TBP) in 
North Kalimantan. A Greenpeace comparison of best available 
concession information for PT TBP with official landcover maps 
and satellite imagery suggests that 2,867ha of forest was 
cleared within the concession between 2015 and June 2017. 
Of this, 308ha was land classified as Limited Production Forest. 
Palm oil development in such areas is illegal.
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND 
DEFORESTATION IN MYANMAR
Glenealy operates Myanmar Stark Prestige Plantation (MSPP), 
a plantation covering at least 5,700ha.105 According to a 
report by the NGO Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), 
a large share of the concession is community land, including 
farmland incorrectly classified as ‘vacant land’ by the Myanmar 
government.106 The EIA report states that MSPP has ‘violated the 
indigenous Karen community’s right to Free Prior and Informed 
Consent (FPIC) enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of indigenous Peoples’, and goes on to record that 
it ‘has cleared more than 6,000 acres [2,400ha], including ... 
orchards villagers depend on for their livelihoods. Families who 
have lost their productive land have fallen into high levels of 
debt or been forced to work as day laborers for low wages ... 
Furthermore, run-off from chemical fertilisers and pesticides 
used by MSPP has polluted local water sources, causing livestock 
to die and villagers to fall ill ... MSPP has never offered villagers 
fair compensation for these impacts.’107DEFORESTATION AND FIRE  
IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA
Glenealy holds one concession in Papua New Guinea, the 
Ome Ome project in Central Province. Greenpeace mapping 
analysis suggests that between August 2015 and April 2017, 
1,016ha of forest were cleared in this concession. Satellite 
analysis of fire hotspot data suggests a strong correlation 
between forest clearance and outbreaks of fire. Between 
2014 and 2017, 74 fire hotspots were recorded in the 
concession, almost all within recently deforested areas. This 
suggests that the company may have used fire deliberately to 
finish clearing the land before planting.
LINKS TO GLOBAL TRADE
 
Between January 2016 and December 2017 (the most recently 
available trade data for all traders that provide such data), 
traders that received palm or palm kernel oil from Samling’s 
Glenealy mills included ADM, Bunge, Cargill, Fuji Oils, IOI, Louis 
Dreyfus, Olam, Sime Darby and Wilmar.108 These traders all 
supply major consumer brands. It is possible that other traders 
that do not have transparent mill-level traceability data on their 
dashboards received the group’s oil during this period as well; 
for example, Louis Dreyfus’ receipt of Glenealy oil is only visible 
through Olam’s mill list.109 
Traders listed above whose grievance lists mention Samling or 
Glenealy include IOI110 and Olam,111 which have engaged with the 
suppliers that provided Glenealy oil, and Wilmar,112 which states 
that it is currently ‘engaging’ with Samling directly. Cargill113 does 
not list Samling or Glenealy in its grievance list. ADM, Bunge, Fuji

BRANDS MUST 
DISCLOSE WHERE 
THEIR PALM OIL 
COMES FROM...
Despite corporate commitments to reform a dirty 
industry, palm oil remains a high-risk commodity. This 
poses a considerable problem for brands that use palm oil, 
including household names such as Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo 
and PZ Cussons. Given that the leading suppliers to the 
global market all source from destructive producers, the 
onus is on brands to prove that they are not sourcing 
– inadvertently or otherwise – from producers that 
are harming the environment and local communities. 
Accordingly, brands must begin by being transparent about 
where their palm oil comes from and who produced it. 
At the start of 2018, Greenpeace challenged 16 
leading members of the CGF to disclose publicly the 
mills that produced their palm oil, and the names of the 
producer groups that controlled those mills. At the time 
of going to press, eight brands – starting with Nestlé 
and Unilever, and quickly followed by Colgate-Palmolive, 
General Mills, Mars, Mondel ēz, Procter & Gamble and 
Reckitt Benckiser – had shown that they were prepared 
to hold themselves accountable by disclosing this 
information. As expected, the supply chain information 
that these respondents published included problematic 
producers who are actively clearing rainforests, but at least these brands were prepared to allow independent 
scrutiny of the progress they were making towards their 
2020 NDPE commitments.
By contrast, other brands that Greenpeace 
approached – Ferrero, Hershey, Kellogg’s, Kraft 
Heinz, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, PZ Cussons and 
Smucker’s – have so far refused to reveal what mills 
their palm oil comes from. Instead, they continue 
to hide behind commercial confidentiality and non-
disclosure agreements, signed with direct suppliers or 
implementation partners such as TFT, or else to refer 
to their corporate policies as a sufficient guarantee 
of sustainability – all of which serves to conceal from 
their customers the extent of their complicity in forest 
destruction. Some brands, including Kellogg’s and 
Hershey, publish lists of their direct suppliers. 
As has already been made clear, none of the major 
traders can yet be relied upon to supply brands with 
palm oil that meets their NDPE standards; indeed, they 
are all known to source from forest destroyers, including 
the producers profiled in this report. It follows that by 
sourcing from these traders brands are buying palm oil 
contaminated by forest destruction.

...AND TAKE 
CONTROL OF THEIR 
SUPPLY CHAINS
Vital as it is, transparency will not lead in and of itself to a clean 
palm oil supply chain. In addition to publishing details of the 
palm oil mills and producer groups in their supply chains, brands 
must conduct their own due diligence on those producers to 
confirm compliance with their NDPE policies. 
A key plank of any due diligence programme is geospatial 
monitoring to identify producers that are clearing forest or 
developing peatlands. This monitoring must go beyond assessing 
the catchment area of the mills from which companies are 
actually sourcing: brands must seek to verify policy compliance 
across all concessions controlled by the producer groups in their 
supply chains, including concessions from which they do not 
themselves source and concessions that are not yet productive, 
as well as the operations of the third-party growers who supply 
those producers. What this all boils down to is that by 2020, 
brands must ensure that their suppliers do not buy palm oil from 
any non-compliant producers, regardless of whether that oil 
currently enters the brands’ own supply chains.
Such monitoring depends on reliable data on corporate 
structures and landholdings. Unfortunately, the governments 
of Indonesia and Malaysia still refuse to make concession maps 
publicly available, although the government of Indonesia has now 
conceded that there are no legal barriers to their publication.114 
The private sector must address this deficiency; traders should 
obtain concession maps from the producer groups who supply 
them with palm oil and make them available for all stakeholders to review, analyse and download on an open-access platform such 
as Global Forest Watch.
If brands want to have ensured by 2020 that their palm oil 
supply is free from deforestation, they will need time to identify 
all the rogue producers and either reform or exclude them. To 
do so, they will have to have concession maps at their disposal. 
The longer it takes to get a comprehensive dataset of concession 
maps into the public domain, the less time brands will have to act 
on the information they contain. Therefore, brands must take 
responsibility for ensuring not just that traders publish concession 
maps for the producers they source from, but that they do so as 
quickly as possible. To ensure that traders respond to the urgency 
of the situation, brands will need to stop sourcing from any trader 
that fails to publish maps for all the producer groups in its supply 
chain by the end of 2018.
Further, brands will need to put pressure on traders (and 
other direct suppliers) to demonstrate that non-compliant 
producers have been excluded from their supply chains. By 
2020, a responsible brand must be able to demonstrate that 
all the palm oil it uses comes from reputable producer groups 
whose plantations have been verified compliant with its 
NDPE policies. At the same time, brands should support the 
transformation of the entire industry by sourcing only from 
traders and other suppliers that can show that all the palm 
oil they trade comes from producers that have been verified 
compliant with NDPE standards.

COUNTDOWN 
TO 
2020
‘ It’s not surprising that people don’t 
know where things come from. That’s 
not the point of a commodity. You 
just buy it. But now we’re asking the 
commodity markets to change and 
start to care about where things 
come from, and it’s changing how 
companies do business.’115 
MARCO ALBANI, DIRECTOR,  
TROPICAL FOREST ALLIANCE 2020
To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, world 
governments signed the Paris Agreement in 2015. This aims 
to limit the average global temperature increase by the end 
of the present century to significantly less than 2°C above 
pre-industrial levels. The commitment includes explicit 
recognition of the role that forests play as sinks, stores and 
sources of carbon, and thus their potential either to help 
limit or to add to greenhouse gas emissions, depending on 
whether they are protected or destroyed. 
The most achievable, and at the same time non-
negotiable, milestone towards meeting the Paris Agreement 
objective depends on concerted action by companies to 
cut the link between deforestation and globally traded 
commodities such as palm oil and soya by no later than 
2020. To date, companies are failing. This is not just about 
trees and orangutans, it is about planetary survival. 
As global temperatures rise, and as populations of 
endangered species dwindle, companies using palm oil can 
expect to come under increasing pressure to ensure that 
it does not come from growers involved in clearing forests 
and peatlands. Indeed, public opinion in many major 
markets is already turning against palm oil altogether. 
In opinion polls worldwide, respondents consistently 
rate palm oil as the most environmentally destructive 
vegetable oil,116 even though other oils such as soya oil are 
equally problematic.117 Calls for companies to stop using 
palm oil will only get louder unless brands and traders 
prove that they can reform the palm oil industry by 
working together to exclude destructive producers from 
the global market.At the same time, all the conditions are in place to 
make NDPE the new normal for the palm oil industry. 
The overwhelming majority of Indonesian and Malaysian 
palm oil passes through companies that have committed 
to environmental and human rights protection: recent 
analysis by Chain Reaction Research suggests that 
companies with NDPE policies operate 74% of the total 
refinery capacity in Indonesia and Malaysia.118 This 
means that lasting and meaningful reform of the palm oil 
industry is entirely possible – if only brands, traders and 
producers are prepared to put the work in between now 
and 2020.
There are many business reasons for brands to use palm 
oil, including its high yield per hectare of plantation and 
versatile properties. But their efforts to reform the industry 
have failed. Palm oil companies have concluded that brands 
are more concerned about maintaining a secure supply of 
palm oil, even if some of it is produced unsustainably, than 
about meeting their NDPE commitments. Brands need to 
counter this perception by making it explicit that from 2020 
onwards, they will use only palm oil that has been verified 
as coming from responsible producers – even if that means 
using less of it.
The most efficient way to meet this commitment would 
be for all sectors involved with palm oil, including producers, 
traders and consumer brands, to act together. However, 
traders and other companies have shown no inclination to do 
so. Accordingly, brands must lead the way and drive change 
throughout the palm oil sector by taking control of and 
responsibility for their own supply chains.

BRANDS MUST
ADOPT STRONG 
STANDARDS  
• Publish a strong NDPE policy that requires 
compliance with the HCS Approach (HCSA) 
toolkit,119 the integrated HCV–HCSA assessment 
manual120 and credible human rights and labour 
standards.
• Adopt and enforce a conversion cut-off date of no 
later than 31 December 2015.121
• Publish an engagement protocol for dealing 
with non-compliant producers, including trade 
restrictions and suspensions along with time-bound 
milestones that non-compliant producers must 
meet for these to be lifted.
 
STOP THE 
PROBLEM  
• Publish and implement a plan to ensure a clean 
palm oil supply chain by 2020, with all producers 
independently verified as compliant with NDPE 
standards across their operations. 
• Monitor the producers in its supply chain at group 
level to identify deforestation and other policy 
violations. 
• Report non-compliant producers to the relevant 
suppliers, and require them to resolve each case in 
line with the brand’s engagement protocol or else to 
exclude the producer altogether. 
• Support and fund forest conservation and 
restoration initiatives, along with rights recognition 
and livelihoods for local communities.
 
 VERIFY  
R E SU LTS
• Require independent verification that non-
compliant producers have come into compliance 
with NDPE standards across their operations, 
including restoring all areas cleared since the 
brand’s conversion cut-off date.
• By 2020, require traders and other suppliers to 
provide independent verification that all producer 
groups in their supply chains are compliant with 
NDPE standards.  
BE 
TRANSPARENT
• Publish and maintain a comprehensive list of all mills 
and producer groups whose palm oil entered its 
supply chain in the previous year.
• Disclose annually the percentage of its palm 
oil coming from producer groups whose entire 
operations have been independently verified as 
compliant with NDPE standards.
• By the end of 2018, require its suppliers to publish 
maps of all concessions controlled by the producer 
groups in their supply chains.
• Publish and maintain a list of all non-compliant 
producers in its supply chain, including the time-
bound actions each is being required to take to 
address its non-compliance.
• Report annually on results of its initiatives to 
deliver forest conservation and restoration, and to 
support community rights and livelihoods.

APPENDIX 1:  
HOW COMPANIES 
PERFORM ON 
TRANSPARENCY
In January 2018, Greenpeace 
challenged sixteen of the world’s 
largest users of palm oil – all members 
of the CGF – to ‘take urgent and 
measurable action to finally end 
deforestation for palm oil’, starting 
by coming clean about the extent 
of deforestation currently in their 
supply chains. Specifically, we called 
on them to publish a list of direct 
palm oil suppliers, the palm oil mills in 
their physical supply chains and the 
producer groups owning those mills.
To date, eight leading global brands 
have responded positively to our challenge 
and published data revealing where and 
from whom they ultimately buy palm oil. 
Four other brands were only willing to 
publish the traders supplying their palm oil. Other brands refused to provide any 
information about their palm oil supply
Many, though not all, traders now 
have so-called dashboards, which also 
reveal from which mills and groups they 
buy. However, global traders including 
Astra Agro Lestari, Hayel Saeed Anam/
Pacific Inter-link, Louis Dreyfus and Sime 
Darby are not currently disclosing which 
producers supply their palm oil.
Transparency and accountability – 
including the publication of explicit details 
about who produces the palm oil that 
companies use – create the conditions for 
sectoral reform. They are not an end in 
themselves, but lay bare the extent of the 
problem.
The quality and extent of brands’ 
disclosures vary dramatically: none is complete, and group information and 
other data are often inaccurate. In some 
cases, it is unclear whether brands are 
simply listing all the producers and mills 
that their direct suppliers source from or 
the specific subset that actually produced 
the palm oil they have received. 
Nonetheless, by publishing these lists, 
brands are asserting that these companies 
produced the palm oil they received. 
As such, they are responsible for what 
happens in those producers’ concessions 
and other operations, including those from 
which they are not sourcing.

AAK’s list of supplying mills (which 
does not include producer groups) 
and another to a ‘master’ list of 
the mills and producer groups in 
the supply chains of its remaining 
nine direct suppliers. Together

AAK
AAK published a mill list just as 
this report was going to press; 
consequently it was not included 
in Greenpeace’s analysis for 
the report. The list is to be 
updated twice a year. It gives 
geographical coordinates, but does 
not list any ownership. Names are 
sometimes unclear (eg ‘Trp’).

a map) that lists mills by name, 
country, immediate ownership, and 
whether or not the palm oil they 
supply is RSPO-segregated. It does

BUNGE LODERS CROKLAAN
In March 2018 Bunge completed the 
purchase of a majority stake in IOI’s 
traded oils division, IOI Loders 
Croklaan. Bunge’s palm oil division 
and Loders Croklaan have merged into 
a new entity, Bunge Loders Croklaan. 
At the time of the merger Bunge 
published for the first time, 
linked to its palm oil dashboard, 
a list of the mills in its supply 
chain for the third quarter of 
2017, but identified them by name only, with no details of country, 
ownership or coordinates. IOI 
Loders Croklaan had previously 
published quarterly summary 
reports for each of its refineries, 
including the names, the parent 
company, coordinates and country of 
each supplying mill. These reports 
have now been rebranded as Bunge 
Loders Croklaan, though those 
currently available online refer 
to palm or palm kernel oil received 
by what were at the time still IOI 
Loders Croklaan refineries.

APPENDIX 2: 
LITERATURE 
REVIEW
Greenpeace monitoring has identified 
significant recent or continued 
deforestation in the operations of major 
producer groups trading to the global 
market. The vast majority of these cases 
have long been in the public domain 
through NGO reports, RSPO complaints or 
trader grievance dashboards. A review of 
2016–2017 dashboards for major traders 
shows the extent of market exposure to 
these producer groups. 
Below is a brief literature review.

14  The concept of a group goes 
beyond formal parent–subsidiary 
company relationships. In Indonesia, 
a large segment of the plantation 
industry is controlled by complex 
groupings of companies owned by 
individuals and families. In many 
cases there is no single ultimate 
parent company and the group consists 
largely of privately held companies, 
not listed on any stock exchange. 
Different family members may be the 
ultimate shareholders in different 
companies, or parts of the group may 
be held offshore, rendering the 
ultimate owner unknowable. It is 
necessary to take a broad view of what 
constitutes a group, including 
control – financial, managerial, 
operational or other – and ownership 
links, to get around unscrupulous 
companies’ deliberate obscuring of 
their ownership in order to avoid 
losing market access for their 
products. From March 2017, all RSPO 
members are required to register 
their membership at the group level, which is defined in terms not only of 
ownership but also of management or 
operational control. See RSPO (2017a)

IOI, Mewah, Musim Mas, Olam and 
Wilmar. These show which mills have 
supplied those traders. We also 
examined any supplier/mill lists 
publicly disclosed by brands, as well 
as traders’ grievance lists. In many 
cases, information on corporate 
ownership of a mill is missing from 
these sources (for instance, showing 
the correct company name of the mill 
but not identifying it as belonging 
to a parent company) or else 
inaccurate. Thus, even if a trader 
ends trade with a particular 
producer, oil from that producer’s 
parent group or affiliated companies 
may continue to enter the trader’s 
supply chain if the trader does not 
correctly recognise the full extent 
of the group. Moreover, not all 
traders have traceability 
dashboards.

121  Conversion cut-off dates are 
common practice in certification 
schemes; when properly enforced they 
discourage deforestation by ensuring 
that producers know that they will 
be unable to sell their products if 
they continue to clear forest. Trade 
with producers that have cleared 
forest or developed peatlands 
after the cut-off date should be 
suspended unless the producer 
commits to restore the relevant 
areas (and to obtain independent 
third-party verification that all its 
plantations are now NDPE-compliant).
