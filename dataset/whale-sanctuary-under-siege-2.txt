Defending our oceans
"Greenpeace is committed to defending the health of the world's oceans 
and the plants, animals and people that depend upon them."
Whale Sanctuary under Siege 

Established in 1994, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary is under siege like never
before. This year nearly one thousand whales can expect to find no quarter or refuge
in the protected waters around the Antarctic. They will be hunted down and killed inthe name of science: they will be measured, weighed, cut up and boxed for market,
all too often simply remaining on the freezer shelves because so few people relish
the taste of whale meat.
The feeding ground for 80 percent of the world’s great whales, the Sanctuary is also
the ‘killing field’ of K yodo Senpaku, a Japanese company which conducts an annual
hunt under a licence misleadingly labelled ‘scientific whaling’ and issued by the
Fisheries Agency of Japan (FAJ).
After years of failed attempts to regulate the global whaling industry’s insatiable
appetite and reverse the decline in whale populations, the International WhalingCommission (IWC) banned commercial whaling in 1986. Although as an IWC memberJapan originally objected to the moratorium, which meant it would be exempt from its
control, it was later persuaded by the US to withdraw the objection. The IWC is the
body recognised by the UN as having responsibility for the world’s whales.
The moratorium, however , contains a fatal flaw . A flaw that the whalers where quick
to exploit and on a scale which all could see was a thin veneer covering business as
usual in the Antarctic whale killing fields. A special exemption for ‘scientific’ culls is
included in the IWC’s rules. It was argued that information gained from dead whales
could generate detailed knowledge needed to establish guidelines for sustainable whaling. Science has moved on. Detailed infor mation can now been gained through
non-lethal research. In fact, the IWC’s scientists have repeatedly asked for the 
scientific slaughter to stop, saying the data is not needed.
The hunt, although reduced after 1986, did not stop and the whale products collected
as a by-product of ‘science’ continued to be processed and packaged on board thewhaling vessels and then sold in super markets and restaurants. Later when IWC voted
to designate the Southern Ocean as a Whale Sanctuary by 23 votes to one, Japanagain objected and is the only country in the world which does not recognise the
Sanctuary.
After many years of openly promoting a return to commercial whaling and 
emboldened by nearly 20 years of defiance of global public opinion and conservation
efforts, the Japanese delegation to this year’s IWC meeting, in Ulsan South Korea,announced a plan to more than double, to 935, its annual catch of Antarctic minke
whales, adding 50 each of fin and humpback whales, both of which are officially 
designated endangered species.
The announcement was met with open hostility; many former whaling countries 
including the US, the UK, and Australia raised strong objections. Those objections fellon deaf ears.
Japan’s whalers are also growing more confident that they may soon be able to dump
the pretence of scientific whaling and return to open commercial hunts. While international opinion has not changed, the Fisheries Agency of Japan has for a number
of years been seeking to force a vote, at the Commission’s annual meeting, to end the
moratorium. In what the Agency calls a ‘vote consolidation programme’, ever y year an
increasing number of nations join to support an immediate resumption of commercial
whaling. Some new members of the IWC including Gambia, Mali, Togo, Benin, Gabon,
Tuvalu and Nauru, who where recruited by and receive substantial aid from theFisheries Agency of Japan, are backing the pro-whaling position.
After this year’s failed attempt to overturn the moratorium, one member of the
Japanese delegation warned: “Some of you seemed glad that some poor sustainable
use countries could not attend this year's meeting. However, next year they will all 
participate. The reversal of histor y, the tur ning point is soon to come.”
This year Greenpeace will also return to the Southern Ocean to defend the whale 
sanctuar y, to protect as many whales from the harpoon as possible.

Two Greenpeace ships, the Esperanza and the Arctic Sunrise, carrying an international
crew, will embark on the difficult task of trying to intercept the whaling fleet in 32million square kilometres of frigid Antarctic water, an area twice the size of the US:
bearing witness on the frontier of environmental destruction and calling on the 
governments and companies behind whaling to stop.
The trip is the first stage in an ambitious new Greenpeace campaign ‘Defending our
Oceans’. Over the next year the Esperanza will be Greenpeace’s main platform in
arguing for a network of marine reserves or parks covering 40% of the world’s oceans:places that will be protected from industrial exploitation and destruction, from 
industrial fishing and hunting, and places from which our oceans can begin the process
of repair and recovery.
Not every one is fortunate enough to be able to crew on a Greenpeace ship, but on this
expedition anyone can join the Esperanza on-line and help us bring an end to whaling
and to defend the oceans. To become an Ocean Defender and sail with us on our
incredible journey go to:
