All Hands on Deck - NOW!
Key tak eaways fr om the IPCC r epor t on Physical Science
Basis (AR6 WG1)
9 August 2021
_____________________________________________________________________
Climat e change is no longer a futur e thr eat. It is
here and it’ s rapidly getting worse. 
The unpr ecedent ed heatwaves and wildﬁr es, heav y rains
and ﬂoods, dying sea-life, melting 
polar ice and collapsing ecosyst ems pr ovide painful
reminders of just how far int o the 
danger zone we have alr eady plunged. What matt ers
now is wher e we go fr om her e.
In the P aris Agr eement, governments agr eed t o pursue
a warming limit of 1.5°C
, and t o 
act accor dingly, with national tar gets and plans that
are to be r evised ever y ﬁve years. In 
2018 world’ s leading scientists pr ovided governments
with fur ther clarity on the tar get, with 
an
IPCC Special Repor t
, and established the global
benchmarks for suﬃcient action:
by 
2030 global CO
2
emissions would need t o be halved
and by mid-centur y, at the lat est, 
brought t o net z ero
, with substantial r eductions in
other gases in all sect ors.
Now scientists zoom back t o the ver y big pictur e on
climat e change
. The r eport on 
Physical Science Basis, published by the Int ergovernmental
Panel on Climat e change 
(IPCC) W orking Gr oup 1 on 9 Aug 2021, pr ovides an
updat e on what’ s happening t o our 
warming planet and why . The r eport forms the ﬁrst
part of the IPCC’ s regular assessment 
reports, now the 6th, the r emaining par ts of which
(on human impacts and ways t o limit 
warming), will be published ne xt year . It distils
the advances in physical climat e science 
since the pr evious assessment r eport, AR5 WG1, published
8 years ago.
The r epor t advances what we alr eady knew , with fur ther
detail, depth and cer tainty . 
Understanding of the climat e syst em’s fundamental
elements is alr eady r obust and well 
established. The ﬁve IPCC assessment cycles since
1990 have compr ehensively and 
consist ently laid out the r apidly accumulating evidence
of a changing climat e syst em. 
Over all, obser ved warming is br oadly consist ent with
projections in the past decades, since 
systematic scientiﬁc assessments began

Where we are today, and why
I
t is unequivocal that human inﬂuence has warmed
the atmospher e, ocean and land.
Widespr ead and r apid changes in the atmospher e, ocean,
cryospher e (frozen par ts of the 
globe) and biospher e have occurr ed.
(SPM A1)
Multiple lines of evidence indicat e the unpr ecedent ed
natur e of r ecent lar ge-scale 
climatic changes in the cont ext of all human hist ory.
In 2011-2020 global sur face 
temper ature was about 1.09°C above pr e-industrial
levels, and t emper atures ar e now 
compar able t o levels last e xperienced about 125,000
years ago during the Last Int erglacial, 
when the Gr eenland ice sheet was smaller and sea-level
likely 5-10 met ers higher than 
today . The concentr ation of atmospheric CO
2
(410 ppm)
has not been this high in at least 2 
million years.

Since the pr evious Assessment Repor t (WG1/AR5) global sur face t emper ature has 
warmed str ongly
, with the past ﬁve years (2016-2020)
being the hott est in the r ecord since
at least 1850.
(TS,Cross-Section Box TS.1. Previous
WG1/AR5 was released in 2013)
The r ates of sea-level rise and ice loss have acceler ated
. The r ate of sea-level rise has 
nearly tripled compar ed to that in 1901-1971, while
the aver age mass-loss r ate for the 
Greenland ice-sheet was about six times fast er over
the period 2010–2019 compar ed to the 
period 1992-1999. The Antar ctic Ice Sheet was losing
mass on aver age thr ee times fast er in 
2010-2019 compar ed to 1992-1999.
(SPM A.1.7; Ch 9,
page 7)
We’re witnessing mor e and worse weather e xtremes,
and we have str onger evidence 
of their attribution t o human inﬂuence.
Evidence
of obser ved changes and their 
attribution t o human-induced emissions has str engthened
for sever al types of e xtremes 
since the pr evious Assessment Repor t (AR5), in par ticular
for extreme pr ecipitation, 
droughts, tr opical cyclones and compound e xtremes
(including dr y/hot events and ﬁr e 
weather).
(SPM, section A.3; Ch11, page 6)
Where we are heading from here
The mor e greenhouse gases we add t o the atmospher e,
the worse it will get
, with 
every additional incr ement of warming, as many changes
in the climat e syst em become 
larger in dir ect relation t o incr easing warming. Mor e
warming brings mor e frequent and mor e 
intense hot e xtremes, marine heatwaves, dr oughts in
some r egions, heav y rains, ﬂooding 
events, int ense tr opical cyclones and worsening climat e
impact-drivers such as melting ice 
and snow , rising sea-levels, changing ocean cir culation
as well as acidifying, warming and 
deoxygenation of oceans.
(Figure SPM.10; SPM B2 Figure
SPM.5; Figure SPM.6; Figure SPM.8; B.5.1; SPM C2)
Ther e will be an incr easing occurr ence of some e xtreme
events unpr ecedent ed in the 
obser vational r ecor d, even at 1.5°C of global warming,
but mor e so with higher levels
. 
For example, hot e xtremes will incr ease in fr equency
and int ensity even if warming is 
stabiliz ed at 1.5°C. But with 2°C warming the changes
in the int ensity would be at least 
double, and with 3°C quadruple, compar ed to changes
at 1.5°C.
[Nearly 3°C is wher e we 
are heading with curr ent policies, accor ding t o
CAT
.]
(SPM, B.2.2; Ch 11, p 7)
The Ar ctic is lik ely to be pr actically sea ice fr ee
in Sept ember
at least once
befor e 
2050
in all assessed scenarios. While in high CO2
emission scenarios ice-fr ee gr adually 
becomes the norm, in a 1.5°C compatible scenario about
half of the curr ent summer sea-ice 
extent would r emain and even a slow r ecover y could
start. (
 
SPM B.2.5; Figure SPM.8)
Low-lik elihood outcomes, such as ice sheet collapse,
abrupt ocean cir culation 
changes, compound e xtreme events and substantially
larger warming cannot be ruled 
out and ar e par t of risk assessment.
The pr obability
of low-lik elihood, high impact 
outcomes incr eases with higher global warming levels.
Abrupt r esponses and tipping 
points, such as str ongly incr eased Antar ctic ice melt
and for est dieback, cannot be 
excluded. If warming incr eases, some compound events
with low lik elihood in past and 
current climat e will become mor e frequent, and ther e
is a higher chance of hist orically 
unprecedent ed events and surprises.
(SPM, section
C.3; Ch 11, Box 11.2)
Ther e’s now only a “medium conﬁdence” that the A tlantic
Meridional Over turning 
Circulation will not abruptly collapse befor e 2100
.
The AMOC is ver y likely to weak en 
over the 21st centur y for all emission scenarios.
But while IPCC AR5 assessed it t o be “ver y 
unlikely that AMOC will under go an abrupt tr ansition
or collapse in the 21st centur y for the 
scenarios consider ed”, AR6 now sees only a “medium
conﬁdence that ther e will not be an 
abrupt collapse befor e 2100” .
(SPM C.3.4; AR5 WG1
SPM p. 24)
Diﬀer ent r egions ar e facing diﬀer ent combinations
of climatic impact drivers
, which 
are also modulat ed by natur al drivers and int ernal
variability . Understanding r egional

climatic drivers is impor tant for risk assessment and pr eparedness. The scientiﬁc 
community is now enabling governments t o explor e this
information, with an int eractive 
online r egional atlas.
(SPM Section C.2, and The Interactive
Atlas at https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch)
Some ver y long-t erm changes ar e already lock ed in
,
regardless of what we do, r esulting 
in continued worldwide loss of ice, sea level rise
and changes in the ocean (ocean warming, 
deep ocean acidiﬁcation and deo xygenation). But the
scale and speed of these changes 
varies substantially depending on emissions we r elease
from her e on.
(SPM section B5; SPM
Figure SPM.8)
Melting ice-sheets could leave a legacy of ver y high
sea-level incr eases.
Deep 
uncer tainty r emains r egarding ice-sheet-r elated pr ocesses
and r esulting sea-level rise. As a 
new featur e since AR5, the IPCC now e xtends sea-level
rise estimations t o 2300, assuming 
diﬀer ent emission pathways. The lik ely ranges in
2300 span fr om less than 0.5 met ers to 
about 7 met ers, acknowledging that, assuming a ver y
high emission futur e, even sea level 
rise gr eater than 15m cannot be ruled out, due t o
ice sheet processes
.
(Figure SPM.8)
What it takes to limit further impacts and extremes
Warming will continue until carbon emissions r each
net z ero.
Limiting human-induced 
warming t o any speciﬁc level r equir es reaching at
least net z ero CO2 emissions and str ong 
reductions in other warming gases. The eﬀects of
emission cuts would emer ge earlier as 
slower gr owth of gr eenhouse gas concentr ations, slower
warming r ates and impr oved air 
quality .
(Figure SPM.10, SPM sections D1 and D2; TS,
page 28)
Meeting the P aris Agr eement long-t erm goal of 1.5°C
would mean less of ever ything – 
sea-level rise, worsening weather e xtremes and harshening
living conditions in both land 
and ocean -– compar ed to higher warming levels. It
would r educe the risks of cr ossing k ey 
tipping points, facing abrupt changes and crippling
with compound events. The diﬀer ences 
between curr ent warming, 1.5°C and 2°C ar e signiﬁcant,
and speciﬁed alr eady in mor e
detail by the IPCC Special Repor t on 1.5°C in 2018.
(SPM Section C.2 Figure SPM.5; Figure SPM.6;
Figure SPM.8; B.5.1; SPM C.3.2 and C.3.3)
1.5°C warming limit is still within r each
, from a
physical perspective, but only with r apid 
emission cuts that bring carbon emissions t o net z ero
and beyond. The r eport reaﬃrms the 
ﬁndings of the IPCC Special Repor t on 1.5°C on 1.5°C
scenarios, anticipat ed time of 
reaching 1.5°C (when apples ar e compar ed to apples),
and the r emaining carbon budget 
which, aft er methodological impr ovements, is of the
same magnitude. (Hence the emission 
reduction benchmarks established by that r eport, of
halving global carbon emissions by 
2030 and bringing them t o zero by 2050 ar e still valid).
(SPM B.1.3; SPM D.1.3; footnote 27)
Failing t o cut global emissions fr om curr ent levels
could eat up the r emaining carbon 
budget for 1.5 °C by 2030
. To limit global warming
to 1.5°C above pr e-industrial levels with 
either a one-in-two (50%) or two-in-thr ee (67%) chance,
the remaining carbon budgets 
amount t o 500 and 400 billion t onnes of CO2 r espectively,
from the beginning of 2020. 
Currently human activities ar e emitting over 40 Gt
CO2 in a year (
about 39 Gt in 2020
but 
the IEA pr ojects a r ebound
to near pr e-covid levels,
so near t o
42 Gt
)
.
(SPM Table SPM.2)
Strong, r apid and sustained r eductions in methane
emissions ar e also needed
, and 
would come with the co-beneﬁt of impr oved air quality,
by reducing global sur face o zone. 
However , CH4 emissions have gr own fast er since the
AR5.
(SPM D1; Ch 6, p 7)
Carbon r emoval methods have pot ential t o remove r esidual
CO2 fr om the atmospher e, 
but can have pot entially wide-r anging eﬀects
on biogeochemical
cycles and climat e, and 
inﬂuence wat er availability and quality, food pr oduction
and biodiversity . If net negative 
emissions wer e reached and sustained, it would gr adually
reverse sur face t emper ature 
increase, but it wouldn’t r everse other climat e changes,
such as sea-level rise, trigger ed by

then.
(SPM, D.1.4-D.1.6. A comprehensive assessment of the ecological and socio-economic dimensions of CDR
options is left to the WGII and WGIII reports that
will be published next year.)
Greenpeace conclusions for action
The IPCC does not have the mandat e to mak e policy
recommendations. Nor does the r eport 
discuss ways t o mitigat e climat e risks, as that will
be cover ed in their r eports ne xt year . Below 
we pr esent
Greenpeace conclusions
for action.
The science is clear , the situation is serious, and
now it’ s all hands on deck.
We must 
do ever ything fast er and bolder , at all levels, leaving
no sect or behind.
Heading for z ero global emissions, thr ough halving
them by 2030
, as established by the 
IPCC in its 1.5°C r eport, provide clear benchmarks
for action. Those with mor e capacity and 
responsibility must lead the way and suppor t others
in their journey .
Governments must align their tar gets and plans with
1.5°C
by the COP26
climat e 
confer ence in Glasgow this year . With curr ent policies
we ar e still
on track
to an apocalyptic 
2.9°C futur e. Even if all pledges wer e back ed with
suﬃcient policies, we’d be heading 
towar ds roughly 2.4°C warming, with nearly 80% chance
of exceeding 2°C.
Strong gr een r ecover y measur es fr om CO VID-19 oﬀer
a mak e or br eak oppor tunity, so 
let’s grasp it!
Strong r ecover y measur es could slow-down
warming r ates, avoiding 0.3°C 
warming by 2050 and give a
good chance
of keeping
the 1.5°C tar get within r each.
Ther e can’t be any new fossil fuel investments anywher e
,
and the phase out of e xisting 
fossil fuel infr astructur e must align with the 1.5°C
budget. Smar t, eﬃcient and sustainable 
solutions ar e ready t o deliver and meet all our ener gy
needs, if allowed t o.
We must pr otect and r estore ecosyst ems t o build r esilience.
Healthy ecosyst ems ar e 
more resilient in the face of inevitable climatic
changes. W e must pr otect 30% of our land 
and oceans and r educe all pr essur es to our ocean ecosyst ems.
We must end defor estation, 
restore forests and other t errestrial ecosyst ems,
and adopt agr oecology along with a 
reduced pr oduction and consumption of animal pr oducts
and mor e plant-based diets.
Carbon dio xide r emoval oﬀers no silver bullet.
It
is fundamental that we pr otect and 
improve the ability of our for ests and soils t o sequest er
more carbon. But additional carbon 
removal on a lar ge scale comes with many challenges
and risks. Our utmost priority must 
be in st opping fur ther emissions fr om ent ering the
atmospher e right now , rather than r elying 
on theor etical lar ge-scale r emovals far in the futur e.
Financial institutions - banks, asset managers and
insur ers, as well as the companies 
to whom they lend and whose shar es they own, must
align their business with the 
objectives of the P aris Agr eement
, to pursue limiting
global aver age t emper ature incr ease 
to 1.5°C
as shifting investment will be k ey to avoiding
high-carbon lock-in. Gr eenwash with 
empty net-z ero pledges r elying on imaginar y oﬀsets
only add fuel t o the pr oblem.
We must pr epar e for the unavoidable - with justice.
All futur e development and wat er 
management plans, infr astructur e projects and food
security pr ogrammes must fact or in 
climat e reality . The ‘pollut er pays’ principle must
be at the hear t of adaptation and 
compensation eﬀor ts between and within countries.
We must
deliver in solidarity
. Today the true costs
of climat e change ar e paid 
predominantly by those who have caused it the least.
Rich governments must deliver on 
their P aris climat e ﬁnance commitments and get serious
with addr essing loss and damage.

And we can!
The challenges ar e huge, but so ar e oppor tunities.
Since the IPCC AR5 (published in 
2013-2014), the world has alr eady changed a lot, and
not only for the bad.
We now have a 
truly global climat e agr eement with a 1.5°C goal
,
and a lot mor e.
•
Solar and wind
have become
the cheapest forms of new
electricity in most of the 
world
, and costs continue t o decline. This has the
potential t o change ever ything, if only we 
allow it t o, by making sur e that oil, coal and gas
are phased out at the speed r equir ed.
•
Even the Int ernational Ener gy Agency now sees a
pathway
to 1.5°C
, into an ener gy 
system dominat ed by solar and wind, coming with “huge
beneﬁts” . Ther e should be no 
investment in new fossil fuel supply pr ojects, and
no fur ther ﬁnal investment decisions for 
new unabat ed coal plants, and by 2035 no sales of
new cars running on oil, says the IEA - 
a body cr eated to ensur e the security of oil supplies,
and one with big inﬂuence on 
investment and business str ategies.
•
The ﬁnancial sect or has ﬁnally
started to
wake up
,
with some of the
world’ s largest 
bond pur chasers and
asset owners
now
pursuing
to align
their str ategies with the P aris 
Agreement and 1.5°C limit, and some
top global invest ors
moving away fr om the massive 
climat e-related risks associat ed with fossil fuels,
into building r enewable ener gy.
•
Some of the business str ategies ar e
starting t o
sound
diﬀer ent
, with car companies 
announcing combustion engine
phase outs, ener gy utilities
early coal phase outs and an 
oil giant
cuts
in their oil and gas pr oduction.
•
People are winning in courts:
Movement-led climate
court cases are bringing justice to
those most impacted, and an increasing number of judges
and courts are applying the law 
to hold polluters accountable.
In just thr ee years
climat e litigation cases have
nearly 
doubled
, and only last year , an unpr ecedent ed number
of key judgments with pot entially 
far-reaching impacts wer e issued, including on the
cases
against Shell
and against 
Germany
. Now , mor e than ev
er, climat e litigation has
become a r eal thr eat for laggar d 
governments and big pollut ers.
•
Most impor tantly: P eople power is for cing justice
and action
. In recent years we’ve 
witnessed a gr owing wave of citiz en action, fr om mass
demonstr ations t o climat e 
elections and blooming cour t cases for justice. And
it is for cing change! New climat e 
targets have been adopt ed, and a wave of vict ories
in cour ts is
changing the game
. (For 
Greenpeace suppor ted cour t cases, please see
here
.)
None of this is enough. Not even close.
But all of
it points t o new pot ential for change. 
Most of these developments would have been deemed
impossible just a few years ago. 
Now we must speed up and scale up for good, with massive
public pr essur e.
This is our moment of truth, a time for r adical honesty .
With incr emental action we ar e only 
fooling ourselves. Big pollut ers must st op doing bett er
and star t doing enough.
This is the 
moment t o rise up, be bold and think big. And ther e’s
a role to play for ever yone.
