SLAUGHTERING 
THE AMAZON

‘ Just as no country can solve  
climate change alone, harnessing  
the wealth of a forest spread over 
eight countries requires international 
co-operation. For that reason, in 
2008 Brazil launched the Amazon 
Fund. Over $20 billion will be raised to 
finance conservation and sustainable 
development. These resources will 
be used to curb illegal logging, but 
also to develop alternative livelihoods. 
Norway has already pledged $1.1 
billion over ten years for the fund.  
We hope others will follow.’ 
Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da 
Silva, The Guardian, 28 March 2008‘  Supporting competitive Brazilian 
companies in the international 
market is a primary objective of the 
Brazilian government, and for more 
than sixteen years BNDES has been 
participating in the successful effort 
of maintaining a market-based, 
competitive environment  
for Brazilian exporters.’

Brazil is the world’s fourth largest producer of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.1 The majority of 
emissions come from the clearance and burning 
of the Amazon rainforest.. Globally, tropical forest 
destruction is responsible for around 20% of global 
GHG emissions.2 Ending deforestation is an essential 
part of a global strategy to tackle climate change and 
to preserve biodiversity.
The major challenge, as identified by the World Bank,  
is to target the main economic drivers of deforestation 
at the ‘agricultural frontiers, such as the Amazon’.3 
World governments, multilateral funding agencies such 
as the World Bank and global corporations all have a 
role to play. 
The Copenhagen Climate Summit, to be held in 
Denmark in December 2009, is the key opportunity for 
governments to agree measures to drastically reduce 
GHG emissions. Any effective deal must include 
actions and funding to tackle deforestation.

The cattle sector is the key driver of deforestation in 
the Brazilian Amazon.10 According to the Brazilian 
government: ‘Cattle are responsible for about 80% 
of all deforestation’ in the Amazon region.11 in recent 
years, on average one hectare of Amazon rainforest 
has been lost to cattle ranchers every 18 seconds.12 
The cattle sector in the Brazilian Amazon is responsible 
for 14% of the world’s annual deforestation.13 This makes it 
the world’s largest driver of deforestation, responsible for 
more forest loss than the total deforestation in any country 
outside Brazil except indonesia.14

Successive reports by the World Bank, the Brazilian

Greenpeace consistently conclude that cattle ranching 
occupies about 80% of all deforested land in the 
Amazon region.26
The largest economic incentive for the expansion of Brazil’s 
cattle sector into the Amazon is lack of governance:27 
contributing factors include corruption, disorganisation, 
limited capacity and lack of coordination between 
government departments. 
Analysis by Greenpeace of 2006–2007 satellite data and 
forest clearance permits reveals that more than 90% of 
current Amazon deforestation was illegal.28

Through the Brazilian national Development Bank 
(BnDES), the finance arm of the Brazilian ministry 
of Development, industry and foreign Trade, the 
Brazilian government has formed strategic alliances 
with the handful of global players in the cattle sector. 
Between 2007 and 2009, these players – who account 
for up to 50% of Brazil’s beef exports market – received 
$2.65 billion from the B nDES,32 in exchange for 
Brazilian government shares in the companies.
The three processors receiving the lion’s share of 
Brazilian government investment – Bertin, JBS and 
marfrig – include one of the world’s largest leather 
traders,33 the world’s largest beef trader (controlling at 
least 10% of global beef production),34 and the world’s 
fourth-largest beef trader, respectively.35
Expansion by these groups is effectively a ‘joint venture’ 
with the Brazilian government. 
These companies see the financial crisis as an 
opportunity to build global market share. Without 
Brazilian government money, the ability of these players 
to continue building a global trade empire founded on 
the export of cattle products from the Amazon would 
have been reduced.
To bolster Brazil’s share of global trade,36 the 
government is providing capital for expansion of cattle 
processing infrastructure in the Amazon region.37 
in a loan assessment for Bertin, the international finance 
Corporation ( ifC), the private lending arm of the World 
Bank, warned of the risks of fuelling deforestation by 
expanding slaughterhouse capacity in the region. A 
World Bank auditor concluded: ‘[Bertin’s Marabá 
slaughterhouse expansion] project poses a grave 
risk to the environment and to the Bank’s reputation.’ 
nevertheless, the ifC invested $90 million in Bertin in one 
of the most high-risk regions of the Amazon.38GREENPEA cE ExPOSES THE

Greenpeace has tracked the trade in cattle products 
back from the export-oriented processing facilities of 
Bertin, JBS and marfrig in the south of Brazil to three 
frontiers of deforestation in the Amazon.
While the Blue Chip companies behind reputable 
global brands appear to believe that Amazon sources 
are excluded from their products,39 Greenpeace 
investigations expose for the first time how their blind 
consumption of raw materials fuels deforestation and 
climate change. 
Greenpeace undercover investigations have unpicked the 
complex global trade in beef products from part-Brazilian-
government-owned corporations – Bertin, JBS and marfrig. 
Greenpeace has identified hundreds of ranches within the 
Amazon rainforest supplying cattle to slaughterhouses in 
the Amazon region belonging to these companies. Where 
Greenpeace was able to obtain mapped boundaries for 
ranches, satellite analysis reveals that significant supplies 
of cattle come from ranches active in recent and illegal 
deforestation. Trade data also reveal trade with ranches 
using modern-day slavery. Additionally, one Bertin 
slaughterhouse receives supplies of cattle from an illegal 
ranch occupying indian lands.  
These slaughterhouses in the Amazon region then 
ship beef or hides to company facilities thousands of 
kilometres away in the south for further processing 
before export. in a number of cases, additional 
processing takes place in import countries before the 
final product reaches the market. in effect, criminal 
or ‘dirty’ supplies of cattle are ‘laundered’ through the 
supply chain to an unwitting global market.

in conclusion: what kind of 
world leader is brazil?
Part of the Problem or 
Part of the solution? 
Brazil presents itself as a global leader on action to cut 
deforestation. At the 2008 international climate summit in 
Poznàn, the Brazilian government announced its National 
Climate Change Plan, including a pledge to pursue 72% 
cuts in the rate of deforestation by 2018. These cuts, which 
it claims will prevent the emission of 4.8Gt CO2,65 are to be 
achieved largely by tackling illegal deforestation.66 
However, the Brazilian government is a funder and 
shareholder in the major players in the cattle sector 
in the Amazon67 – the single largest driver of global 
deforestation. The Brazilian government has $2.65 billion 
in shares in global beef and leather processors who 
profit from the cheap supply of cattle reared on areas of 
the Amazon that have been illegally destroyed. Projected 
growth in exports over the next decade is set to create 
further pressure on the region.
Additionally, legislation before the Brazilian Congress 
seeks to grant land grabbers legal property rights68 
and to more than double the percentage of forest that 
can be cleared legally within a property.69 Rather than 
cutting deforestation rates, this will lead to increased 
legal deforestation. 
Brazil is not alone in driving Amazon 
deforestation. Nor can it take sole responsibility 
for fixing the problem. 
The World Bank identifies the economic drivers 
of deforestation at the ‘agricultural frontiers, 
such as the Amazon’ as the major challenge in 
terms of action on climate.70 
Given the global trade in agricultural commodities 
driving deforestation, considerable responsibility for 
action lies with Blue Chip corporations behind reputable 
global brands whose blind consumption of raw 
materials in their supply chains fuel deforestation.
Further responsibility for supporting a shift away from 
high carbon activities lies with multilateral institutions 
such as the World Bank itself, whose private lending 
arm, the IFC, has financed expansion by Bertin at the 
‘agricultural frontier’ of the Amazon rainforest.

SLAUGHTERING THE AMAZONviEXECUTIVE SUMMAR YfUN dING fOREST  PROTE cTION  IS kEy TO 
MEETING  THE  cLIMATE  cHALLENGE
Brazil is clear that its ability to reach its target on 
reducing deforestation depends on the provision 
of international funding from rich countries. To this 
end, the government established an Amazon fund, 
to which Brazil’s minister of Environment Carlos 
minc has said that he is hoping for funds of $21 
billion by 2021.71 
yet in may 2009, only $110 million had been 
made available – part of a $1 billion package the 
government of norway announced in 2008, to 
be paid by instalments until 2015. As of the end 
of march 2009, Germany is the only other donor 
committed to the fund, announcing a contribution 
of €18 million ($24.7 million).72
The devastating example of the destruction of the 
Amazon rainforest outlined in this report is just one of 
the tragic realities facing forests worldwide. While the 
cattle sector in the Amazon is the single largest driver 
of deforestation in the world, other industries in other 
regions of the world must be tackled. 
As the Carbon Disclosure project (CD p) – a 
partnership of many of the Blue Chip companies 
identified in this report – has concluded: ‘ it is only 
through collaborative global action which takes the 
long-term view’73 that the climate challenge will be met.
Currently, industries in Europe and the USA are 
issued permits giving them allowances for a set 
amount of emissions, eg from manufacturing or 
fossil fuel energy generation. 
following the principle that the polluter pays, 
Greenpeace proposes that companies should pay for 
a portion of their GHG emissions permits. revenues 
generated would go to a forests for Climate fund 
to provide financing for developing countries to 
protect forests.74 This fund would provide economic 
incentives to tackle deforestation and put a value on 
standing forests. it would reward countries with verified 
reductions in deforestation rates. The fund would be 
targeted at forest areas with high biodiversity values 
and at creating and preserving sustainable livelihoods 
for forest communities as a long-term means of forest 
protection. As the fund would be open to all countries 
with vulnerable forests, it would prevent leakage – the 
shifting of deforestation by global industries from one 
forest region of the world to another.
part of the global deal to protect the climate 
must be to get an agreement to provide long-
term funding for the protection of the world’s 
rainforests. The Copenhagen Climate Summit in 
December 2009 is a critical opportunity to agree 
measures and mechanisms including funding to 
combat global deforestation.
if this effort fails, the next crisis will not be a 
temporary economic downturn but an irreversible 
climate catastrophe. PROTE cT THE cLIMATE:

cOPENHAGEN  2009:  
MAkE OR bREA k fOR THE  cLIMATE ?
The reality of climate change is outstripping scientific 
research findings. The threat of irreversible impacts is far 
more immediate than previously imagined. 
Even a small increase in global temperature could lead 
to irreversible impacts and trigger runaway climate 
change.76 We need a global plan that ensures GHG 
emissions peak within the next few years and then 
decline rapidly, reaching close to zero by mid-century. 
in December 2009, world governments will meet for 
crucial climate negotiations in Copenhagen, Denmark. 
The Copenhagen Climate Summit is the key political 
opportunity for world governments to take responsibility 
for tackling climate change. They must commit to drastic 
GHG emissions reductions under the next phase of the 
kyoto protocol, which comes into effect in 2012. 
Any effective deal to save the climate must include 
measures to combat deforestation. Tropical forest 
destruction is responsible for about 20% of global GHG 
emissions, more than the world’s entire transport sector.77  bRAZILIAN  GOvERNMENT :  
MAkE OR bREA k fOR THE  AMAZON ?
As the country with the world’s largest area of tropical 
forest78 and an acknowledged leader among developing 
nations, Brazil has a crucial role to play in the fight 
against deforestation and climate change. 
Brazil has the world’s fastest rate of deforestation by 
area,79 making it the world’s fourth largest producer of 
GHG emissions.80 
At the 2008 international climate summit in poznàn, 
poland, the Brazilian government presented its national 
Climate Change plan, including a pledge to drastically 
reduce the rate of Amazon deforestation by 2018.81 Brazil 
is clear that its ability to reach its target on reducing 
deforestation will be dependent on the provision of 
international funding from rich countries. To this end, the 
government has set intermediate targets to measure 
progress toward this goal.82 Additionally, the government 
has established an Amazon fund to assist improved 
forest protection through international funds.83 
However, in direct contradiction to this, the Brazilian 
government is a funder and shareholder in the major 
players in the cattle sector in the Amazon84 – the leading 
driver of global deforestation. Through the associated 
deforestation emissions, the cattle sector in the Amazon 
is Brazil’s highest-carbon industry.85
The Brazilian government also forecasts a doubling of 
Brazil’s share of global trade in beef products by 2018.86 
Such expansion will endanger both the remaining Amazon 
forest and the world’s hopes of averting catastrophic 
climate change.
This report, the culmination of a three-year investigation, 
exposes how Brazilian government policy is funding the 
cattle sector in the Brazilian Amazon – the world’s leading 
driver of global deforestation. The report also documents 
how blind consumption of cattle products by the Blue 
Chip87 corporations behind reputable global brands is 
fuelling Amazon deforestation and climate change.

‘ Supporting competitive Brazilian

‘Agriculture is a major sector of 
the Brazilian economy and is 
critical for economic growth and 
foreign exchange earnings […] 
In the past, [Brazil’s] potential 
agricultural expansion was grossly 
underestimated. There are few 
natural limits to future food, fibre, 
and biofuel production in Brazil due 
to the availability of huge areas of 
unutilised arable land.’ 
US Department of Agriculture 
‘Agricultural economy and policy 
report: Brazil’ February 2009
‘The Amazon rainforest 
contains about one tenth of 
the total carbon stored in land 
ecosystems and recycles a large 
fraction of the rainfall that falls 
upon it. So any major change 
to its vegetation, brought about 
by events like deforestation or 
drought, has an impact on the 
global climate system.’

2At the 2008 international climate summit in poznàn, 
poland, the Brazilian government announced 
its intention to achieve 72% cuts in the rate of 
deforestation by 2018.88 
over the next decade, progress toward this goal is to 
be measured against a series of intermediate targets 
for progressive deforestation cuts. 
At the same time, the Brazilian government 
continues its investment in the cattle sector. 
Already the world’s largest beef exporter, the 
government aims to double Brazil’s share of global 
trade in beef products by 2018.89 
The cattle sector is the key driver of deforestation in 
the Brazilian Amazon.90 According to the Brazilian 
government:91 ‘Cattle are responsible for about 80% 
of all deforestation’ in the Amazon region. in recent 
years, on average one hectare of Amazon rainforest 
has been lost to cattle ranchers every 18 seconds.92
The cattle sector in the Brazilian Amazon is 
responsible for 14% of the world’s annual 
deforestation.93 This makes it the world’s largest 
driver of deforestation, responsible for more 
forest loss than the total deforestation in any other 
country except indonesia.94
Through associated deforestation, the cattle sector 
is Brazil’s highest carbon industry, responsible for 
emissions equivalent to almost one and a half times 
Brazil’s entire fossil fuel C o2 emissions.95
This section looks at the Brazilian government’s 
vested interest in a sector profiting from continued 
(often illegal) deforestation.

As part of its drive to dominate global trade in 
agricultural commodities, the Brazilian government has 
a long history of investment in the agribusiness sector.96 
Economic policy has spurred agricultural commodity 
production, construction and modernisation of 
processing facilities,97 and global investment by 
Brazilian companies in the commodity value chain.
By 2008, the agribusiness sector (including production 
agriculture, processing and distribution) accounted 
for 25% of Brazil’s gross domestic product (GD p). 
Agricultural shipments, worth a record $71.8 billion, 
accounted for 36% of the country’s total exports in 2008.98
According to the US Department of Agriculture, over 
the last few years Brazil has dramatically increased 
financial support to its agricultural sector.99 in July 
2008, Brazil’s president announced the 2008/2009 
Agricultural and livestock plan, which took effect in 
october 2008. The 2008/2009 plan makes available 
r$65 billion (then $41 billion) credit, with the intent of 
further boosting farm production. of this amount, r$55 
billion was designated for corporate agriculture.100
Through the Brazilian national Development 
Bank (B nDES), the finance arm of the ministry of 
Development, industry and foreign Trade ( mDiC), the 
Brazilian government supports the expansion of global 
beef and leather exporters into the Amazon region 
through strategic alliances. 
The key objective of the B nDES is to improve ‘the 
competitiveness of the Brazilian economy’101 through 
growth in exports.102 BnDES offers extremely 
advantageous credit lines for exports and corporate 
investments, acts as loan guarantor for Brazilian 
companies, and gains corporate shares103 in 
exchange for investing capital. 
BnDES credit is the dominant source of financing for 
the agribusiness sector.104 
The cattle processing sector has been a significant 
beneficiary. indeed, through the B nDES, the Brazilian government has formed strategic alliances with global 
beef exporters Bertin, JBS and marfrig. By providing 
capital for infrastructural expansion in exchange for 
stakes in the companies, the government has in effect 
entered into ‘joint ventures’ with those companies. 
The clear message coming from climate scientists is 
that economic growth based on high carbon activities 
is no longer acceptable: ‘To achieve the societal 
transformation required to meet the climate change 
challenge, we must … [reduce] the influence of vested 
interests that increase emissions and reduce resilience; 
enabling the shifts from ineffective governance and weak 
institutions to innovative leadership in government.’105
Through ‘joint ventures’, B nDES and the Brazilian 
government stand to profit from poor governance and 
increased carbon emissions in the Amazon via direct 
returns on investment and increased foreign exchange 
earnings for the country. 
This exemplifies the conflict of interest for the Brazilian 
government’s intentions to reduce deforestation.

Brazil’s economy is founded on export-led growth  
of the agriculture sector.106
By 2008, the agribusiness sector (including production 
agriculture, processing and distribution) accounted for 
25% of Brazil’s gross domestic product (GD p). Agricultural 
shipments, worth a record $72 billion, accounted for 36% 
of the country’s total exports in 2008.107
Today, Brazil is a leader in global production and exports 
of agricultural commodities including beef, coffee, cotton, 
maize, orange juice, pork, poultry, soya, sugar, tobacco108 
and derivative commodities including processed meat,109 
leather110 and biofuels.111
The Brazilian government,112 the agribusiness sector113 
and international competitors114 see little limit to Brazil’s 
potential for further agricultural expansion. in fact, 
Brazil sees its domination of global trade of agricultural 
commodities increasing.115 
in february 2009, the Brazilian ministry of Agriculture, 
livestock and Supply published its ‘Brazilian 
agribusiness forecasts 2008/2009 and 2018/2019’.116 
Government officials consider the forecasts to be 
conservative as they incorporated the effects of the 
present world financial crisis.117 
in the absence of effective governance, Brazil’s policies 
to promote agricultural growth conflict with its policies 
to cut GHG emissions through drastic reductions in 
deforestation rates. 
Brazil’s ministry of Science and Technology estimates 
that deforestation and land-use change historically 
made up 75% of all Brazilian GHG emissions.118 
Brazil ranks as the world’s fourth-largest emitter of 
GHG emissions when deforestation emissions are 
included.119 Using government baseline calculations for 
1996-2005, the average annual Amazon deforestation 
rate was more than 19.5 million hectares with average 
annual emissions of 716 mt Co2,120 equivalent to the 
combined annual coal consumption emissions of 
Germany, the United kingdom, Spain, italy, france,  
The netherlands and Belgium.121
By July 2008, more than 70 million hectares of the 
Brazilian Amazon (nearly 20% of its original area) had 
been destroyed.122 Cattle ranching is the main driver of 
deforestation in the Amazon, responsible for 80% of all 
deforested area in the region.123 This makes the cattle sector Brazil’s highest  
carbon industry.124
The government foresees a doubling in Brazil’s market 
share of world meat and poultry exports.125 Beef exports are 
expected to increase 93%, boosting Brazil’s beef market 
share of world exports to 61%.126 
According to the Agriculture m inistry, deforestation is 
not necessary to achieve this growth in production.127 
yet there is a clear correlation between increasing 
deforestation and cattle expansion. for example, clearing 
forest for grazing can be significantly cheaper than 
restoring degraded land or even maintaining existing 
pasture.128 Dominant players in the beef and leather 
processing industry (in which the Brazilian government 
has shares) also see few limits to their ability to expand 
production.129 Their raw material – cattle – increasingly 
comes from ranches engaged in illegal deforestation. 
An audit for the World Bank’s private lending arm, the 
international finance Corporation ( ifC), found that 
illegal land tenure, illegal deforestation and even forced 
labour are the norm in the Amazon region:130 this 
translates into cheap land and cheap labour leading 
to high carbon emissions. Despite the known risks, 
the ifC and the Brazilian national Development Bank 
(BnDES) are funding expansion of cattle processing 
infrastructure in the Amazon region.
indeed, it is precisely this cheap land and cheap 
labour arising from poor governance that give Brazil its 
competitive advantage over other countries as a cattle 
production hub. As an internal document from one of 
the leading players in Brazil’s beef industry coyly admits, 
Brazil has an area almost the size of the EU ‘available 
for cultivation’ in areas that are not already ‘occupied’ 
or ‘forestry reserves’ – ie, the industry sees a lot of 
unprotected areas available for expansion.131 Thus, ‘lower 
feeding, land and labour costs give Brazil a significant 
competitive advantage.’132 
The author of the Agriculture ministry report also singles 
out beef production as an area in which Brazil has ‘an extra 
advantage’ over other countries: ‘the cost of production’.133
Consequently, the industry is situating cattle processing 
infrastructure such as slaughterhouses in areas with access 
to cheap raw material provision – the Amazon frontiers.134 
The B nDES and the ifC have provided capital for the 
construction of this infrastructure.135bRAZILIAN  GOvERNMENT  fORE cASTS

‘The Brazilian meat processors are v  
ery rapidly expanding ... globally.’
Benedict (2008)
 ‘Several other beef processors are also 
attracting stockmarket capital and are 
acquisitive e.g. Marfrig’s announced 
acquisition of Moy Park.’
Benedict (2008)
 ‘This [$90 million loan to Bertin]  
is a Category A project according  
to IFC’s Procedure for Environmental 
and Social Review of Projects  
because significant impacts that  
are diverse, irreversible, or 
unprecedented may result.’ 
International Finance Corporation, 
Bertin Ltda ‘Summary of 
proposed investment’
Brazil is seeking to gain market dominance in global 
industries linked to cattle products (beef and leather). 
financial support from the B nDES has been key 
to the expansion of top beef exporters both within 
Brazil and globally. This indicates the high priority the 
Brazilian government gives to expanding the cattle 
industry’s export earnings potential. 
According to a 2008 industry presentation, five 
companies (Bertin, independência, JBS, marfrig, 
minerva) controlled over 50% of Brazil’s beef export 
market in 2007,136 and just under 40% of Brazilian 
slaughter capacity.137 These groups are global players 
in the food and leather industries.
Between 2007 and 2009, these top beef exporters 
received $2.65 billion from the B nDES,138 in exchange 
for Brazilian government shares in the companies. 
This money allowed them to modernise and expand 
processing facilities within the Brazilian Amazon and 
expand internationally to gain market share in key 
consumer countries and processing facilities in other 
producer regions.

‘JBS-Friboi has started to see a recovery – 
especially after several of its competitors 
have interrupted their operations due to 
the global crisis. JBS-Friboi’s slaughter 
volume rose by 3% in January and by 
a further 17% in February, following 
an interruption in Independência meat 
packer’s operations. Other meat packing 
groups, such as Bertin, have also taken 
advantage of the gaps left in the market 
by other companies.’
Gazeta Mercantil ‘JBS and Bertin raise 
slaughter volume’ 23 March 2009
‘With such huge potential for cheap 
quality products [the industry’s] eventual 
recovery can never really be in doubt. The 
question that really beckons for the rest 
of the global industry is how big Brazilian 
beef will be on its return, and how far its 
shadow will fall.’ 
The Cattle Site, March 2009 
The current global economic downturn has reduced 
the availability of credit, driving a temporary collapse 
in commodity prices for beef and leather. As a 
consequence, the sector is in a state of flux. many 
companies have gone bust, or been forced to scale 
back or freeze operations. According to a march 2009 
industry report, meat-processing companies responsible 
for 35% of export share have filed for protection from 
creditors under Brazilian bankruptcy laws.139 one of 
these companies is independência – one of the top five 
exporters until it filed for bankruptcy protection in early 
2009 and was forced to cut production.140
The notable winners are Bertin, JBS and marfrig.141  
for these exporters, the current collapse represents  
a golden opportunity to gain market share. 
Through mergers and acquisitions, these companies 
are consolidating their power in Brazil and expanding 
their processing base in key regions – the USA, 
Europe and China. They are anticipating a recovery 
in cattle product markets that will find them with 
significantly increased control of the global sectors  
in which they operate.
indeed, by march 2009 the recovery was already being 
heralded, with industry trade analysts announcing: 
‘Brazil clawing back exports: Brazilian beef exports 
increased 24% month-on-month in m arch […] only 
3% below march 2008 experts’ and confirming the 
‘continuous recovery of the country’s beef trade’.142
in April 2009, the finance ministry made an additional 
r$10 billion ($4.9 billion) line of credit for meat 
processing companies at subsidised rates available 
through the B nDES – stepping in to underwrite the 
export trade to overcome temporary global cashflow 
problems.143 The intervention sent stock prices for 
Brazilian meat processors JBS and m arfrig soaring.144THE EcONOMI c dOWNTURN

increased almost six-fold in volume between 1998 and 
2008.149 in fact, Brazil accounts for 50% of the global

key export sectors for cattle commodities are fresh/

ExPANSION  Of THE cATTLE  SEcTOR 
IS cONcENTRATE d IN THE  AMAZON
Expansion in Brazil’s cattle herd and slaughtering capacity 
is concentrated in the Amazon region. 
Between 1995 and 2006 Brazil’s cattle herd increased 
over 10% (from 153 million to 169 million head).155
While outside the Amazon region, total cattle numbers 
decreased by 4 million head, inside numbers increased 
by almost 21 million, to 56 million head in 2006.156 Within 
the Amazon region itself, mato Grosso and pará represent 
‘hotspots’ of expansion. Today, these two states account 
for almost two thirds of the total herd in the region. 
mato Grosso has increased its cattle stock by 36% 
between 1995 and 2006.157 The state had nearly 20 million 
head of cattle in 2006, meaning it holds the second largest 
cattle herd in the  country – 11.5% of Brazil’s total cattle 
herd – on just 2% of ranches.158 
pará has increased its cattle stock by 111% between 1995 
and 2006.159 Today the state has nearly 13 million head of 
cattle on just 3% of ranches, making it the sixth largest 
ranching state in Brazil.160 
Based on figures from 2006, ranches in the Amazon 
are three times the size of those in the rest of Brazil in 
terms of land area, and over twice the size in terms of 
cattle numbers – stocking rates (the number of cattle 
per hectare) are lower in the Amazon. Since 1996, these 
differences have intensified – the size of Amazon ranches 
has increased by a third in terms of number of cattle 
and by more than 90% in terms of area.161 The total area 
occupied by cattle in the region increased 136% over 
the period, but the number of ranches increased by only 
22%, demonstrating that deforestation largely resulted 
from the expansion of existing ranches rather than the 
establishment of new ranches.162 
in 1990, domestic beef consumption accounted 
for 100% of production; today exports make up 
20% of production.163
The Amazon region is a major production centre, not a 
consumption centre.164  indeed, cattle outnumber the 
local population by more than 7 to 1 in m ato Grosso165 
and nearly 2 to 1 in p ará.166

‘  The competition for crop land [has] 
contributed to the expansion of the cattle 
industry towards the Amazon. The increase 
in the cattle herd in the Legal Amazon has 
also prompted an increase in slaughter 
plants in Mato Grosso state. However,  
major beef packers [ie processing facilities] 
remain in the interior of São Paulo and 
neighbouring states.’ 
 US Department of Agriculture ‘Brazil livestock 
and products annual livestock report 2008’


SLAUGHTERING THE AMAZON14EXPOR TING THE AMAZONBoth slaughter and tannery capacity have also expanded in 
the Amazon region. 
movement of cattle products from these facilities for 
processing takes place at a national level over long 
distances and between groups. This movement of cattle 
products is ‘facilitated by the fact that the facilities belong to 
groups that operate across the nation’.167
meat and other cattle products from slaughterhouses in 
the Amazon are shipped to centralised processing units 
concentrated outside the Amazon in the south of Brazil. for 
example, the main facilities of Bertin, JBS and marfrig are in 
the state of São paulo, close to the main Brazilian consumer 
market and points of export. 
There is significant trade to and between the top five beef 
exporters from third-party suppliers, dictated by their areas 
of specialisation – for example Bertin receives considerable 
quantities of hides.168 
more specialised processing and transformation takes 
place internationally, with many of the top Brazilian 
exporters acquiring beef or leather processing units as far 
afield as the USA, the U k, italy or China.

increasing demand for land in the south of Brazil for 
more profitable arable farming is pushing cattle ranching northwards into the Amazon.169 According to industry analysts, 
this displacement in production is expected to continue.170
Within the Amazon, it costs half as much to clear 
forest for new fertile pasture than to restore degraded 
pastureland,171 as this requires significant use of fertiliser 
and water resources. 
Since 2001, successive reports by the World Bank, the 
Brazilian government and research institutes have 
concluded that cattle ranching occupies about 80% of all 
deforested land in the Amazon region.172 2008 analysis of 
Brazilian government satellite data by Greenpeace also 
finds that cattle have occupied nearly 80% of the land 
already in use in the Amazon region.173
By July 2008, more than 70 million hectares of the 
Brazilian Amazon (nearly 20% of its original area) had been 
destroyed.174
mato Grosso, pará and rondônia are key states for cattle 
expansion and frontiers for deforestation.
By 2007, mato Grosso had lost almost 38% of its 
original forest area.175 Between 1995 and 2006, 38% of 
Amazon deforestation was in m ato Grosso.176 over the 
same period, the state has seen a 36% increase in the 
size of its cattle herd.177
By 2007, pará had lost nearly 20% of its original forest 
area.178 Between 1995 and 2006, 31% of Amazon ‘  Today a cattle rancher cuts down 
4,000 – 5,000 hectares in the 
Amazon, in the Amazon biome, 
to put 5,000 head of cattle and 
create two jobs […] It doesn’t 
make any sense because there 
is so much pastureland to be 
recovered, to be improved in 
terms of efficiency.’

deforestation was in p ará.179 over the same period, the state 
has seen a 111% increase in the size of its cattle herd.180 
The ifC notes that in some municipalities in pará ‘the herd 
occupies the entire deforested area’.181
By 2007, r ondônia had lost almost 39% of its original 
forest area.182 Between 1995 and 2006, 14% of Amazon 
deforestation was in rondônia. 183 over the same period, the 
state has seen a 120% increase in the size of its cattle herd.184

ExPANSION  IN THE  AMAZON
The cattle sector is expanding into the Amazon because of 
the availability of cheap land and cheap labour. 
The largest economic incentive for the expansion of 
Brazil’s cattle sector into the Amazon is lack of governance. 
This permits illegal appropriation of public land (land 
grabbing) and deforestation of more than the 20% of 
an individual landholding than can be legally cleared.185 
Analysis by Greenpeace of 2006–2007 satellite data and 
forest clearance permits reveals that more than 90% of 
current Amazon deforestation was illegal.186
lAnD TEnUrE in D iSArrAy
legal land tenure, established through registration of 
land titles,187 is in a state of disarray.188 The legal status of 
roughly half the Amazon region is uncertain.189 for instance 
a 2008 study for the pará Court of Justice recommends that over 6,000 irregular – often overlapping – land titles 
should be cancelled. These land titles, covering an area of 
110 million hectares (equivalent to almost the entire area 
of pará), are suspected of being obtained fraudulently or 
simply grabbed.190 
inCrA, the Brazilian government agency responsible for 
land registry and management, is poorly structured and 
therefore unable to meet its responsibilities.191
According to the federal prosecution office in pará, the 
current disorganisation within inCrA is an obstacle in 
the fight against deforestation.192 Although Brazil has 
developed an effective system to monitor deforestation 
through analysis of satellite data, the lack of an efficient 
land registration system makes prosecution of illegal 
deforestation difficult, as the status of an individual’s tenure 
is often hard to establish definitively.

Enforcement of law is limited, as an ifC loan assessment 
recognises.193 This is due to a mix of corruption, violence, 
limited capacity by federal authorities and a lack of 
coordination194 between government departments.
inCrA has been implicated in many cases of corruption.195 
iBAmA, the Brazilian federal environmental agency 
responsible for investigating illegal deforestation, is 
hampered by its limited capacity. in a 2009 interview, the 
‘Nearly 90% of agricultural land in the 
Amazon is either devoted to pasture or has 
been out of use for more than four years.’

current director of Environmental protection at iBAmA, 
luciano Evaristo, stated that the agency has only 500 
permanent agents in the region, with a further 900 during 
the months when deforestation rates typically rise.196 
The Amazon region covers an area of some 520 million 
hectares, nearly two-thirds of Brazil.197

The measures for tackling illegal behaviour do not serve 
as adequate disincentives.198 for instance, a ranch caught 
illegally deforesting land is only banned from trading 
cattle grazed on the land where the illegal deforestation 
has been detected.199
The Brazilian legal system allows many levels of appeal, 
meaning that it can take years to get a final ruling.200 Even 
when illegal deforestation is detected and the case has 
successfully negotiated Brazil’s lengthy legal process, 
fines often go unpaid and orders to reforest illegally 
deforested lands are ignored.201 in 2005, i BAmA issued 
fines totalling r$1,436 million ($697 million), of which only 
0.5% were paid.202 
Consequently, illegal deforestation is rampant throughout 
the Amazon.203

in an effort to crack down on land grabbing, the federal 
government has ‘embargoed’ authorities in those 
municipalities with the highest rates of deforestation 
from granting permits for deforestation to ranches 
without registered land titles.204 Despite this intervention, 
deforestation rates in embargoed municipalities have 
seen little if any fall.205
Gov ErnmE nT poli CiES

History has shown that – in the absence of governance 
and land-use planning – government-funded projects 
to open up forest regions with transport and other 
infrastructure drive illegal deforestation.206 Unpaved 
sections of the federal and state roads pass through 
vulnerable areas of frontier rainforest.207
policy initiatives proposed by the lula government conflict 
with its commitment to forest protection and tackling 
illegal deforestation. 
The links between the agriculture sector and the Brazilian 
Congress are well known. for instance, the largest 
parliamentary special-interest group comprises 116 deputies and senators connected to farming.208
land titles in the Amazon region are in disarray. rather 
than fixing the problem, a bill before the Brazilian 
Congress would exacerbate deforestation by granting 
land grabbers legal property rights for illegally 
occupied land.209 
Another bill210 before the Brazilian Congress proposes to 
more than double the percentage of forest that can be 
cleared legally within a property. 
The effect of both these pieces of proposed legislation 
would be to legalise increased deforestation.
SlAvEry
The costs of clearing forest land and other activities 
linked to cattle ranching are also ‘subsidised’ by forced 
labour. Thus, slavery represents another subvention for 
a high carbon activity. 
The ministry of labour and Employment ( mTE) 
publishes the Employers Cadastre,211 known as the 
‘Dirty list’, which names those convicted of keeping 
people in conditions of forced labour.212 A company 
or rancher is not listed until all further legal avenues 
for appeal (a lengthy process in Brazil) have been 
exhausted. Consequently, the list is not comprehensive, 
as many ranches from which slaves have been freed are 
not named. A ranch is listed for a minimum of two years, 
and then only removed if all fines have been paid and 
the mTE deems that the poor labour conditions have 
been corrected.
nearly two-thirds of the cases on the most recent ‘Dirty l ist’, 
published in f ebruary 2009,213 are in the Amazon region, 
with four out of five of these cases related to cattle ranching. 
on the february 2009 ‘Dirty list’, pará is the state with 
the greatest dependence on forced labour, followed by 
mato Grosso. 
pará alone accounts for one out of every three people 
liberated from conditions of slavery in the Amazon region, 
with virtually all those liberated coming from cattle 
ranches.214 more than half of the municipalities within 
Bertin’s primary cattle supply area had cattle-ranching 
related slavery cases.215
in the process of investigating illegal deforestation, 
Greenpeace has found that four of the top five beef 
exporters - Bertin, independência, JBS and marfrig – have 
acquired cattle from ranchers linked to forced labour.216‘  Between 1960 and 1970, modern slave labour was initiated in Brazil, in 
response to the expansion of modern agriculture in Amazonia. The labour 
force came from places with few job opportunities and limited access to 
land and financial services. Furthermore, large-scale agribusiness has 
generated heavy pressure on the region’s natural resources, promoting 
accelerated deforestation processes and an increase in slave labour.’

Since 2006, Greenpeace has been 
investigating market links to illegal 
deforestation for cattle ranches in the Amazon 
rainforest and has documented connections 
between cattle ranches, slaughterhouses, 
food processors, leather manufacturers, the 
cosmetics industry and high street retailers.
Where Greenpeace has been able to establish 
trade links to registered ranches, analysis of 
satellite data has allowed us to assess both 
the area of deforestation and the years in 
which deforestation has taken place within the 
boundaries of the ranch. Greenpeace made 
surveillance flights over critical areas and 
carried out on-the-ground investigations to 
confirm the satellite data analysis.
Greenpeace also obtained brazilian 
government trade data, confidential company 
documents, company and government insider 
information, global trade data and classified 
government information from brazil, china, 
Europe, vietnam and the USA. Analysis of 
these sources has helped reveal the truth 
behind this complex global trade.
Greenpeace has engaged in a three-year 
investigation of the role the cattle industry 
plays in driving Amazon deforestation. The 
investigation reveals how the top exporters – 
propped up by bNdES and financial institutions 
such as the I fc – are driving deforestation in the 
heart of the Amazon.
Supplied by ranchers breaking land tenure, 
labour and environmental laws, global beef and 
leather processors in turn supply global brands in 
food, fashion and footwear. 
Less identifiably, they cater to the rising global 
market in private label products, the unbranded 
catering/food service industry, the cosmetics and 
hygiene sectors, biofuel and dog chews.
by their nature, fraudulent land titles or other 
illegalities are time and resource-intensive 
to prove at an individual case level. However, 
advances in satellite imagery and data analysis 
make it possible to identify deforestation 
conclusively. 
In our investigation, Greenpeace has focused 
primarily on deforestation. 
Greenpeace evidence shows that top beef 
exporters are regularly supplied with cattle from 
ranches that have cleared well above the legal 
deforestation limit. Ranches continue to deforest 
at the frontiers – areas with remaining forests.

SLAUGHTERING THE AMAZON30GREENPEACE INVESTIGA TES: THE GLOBAL BEEF TRADE‘Processed meat (cooked, cured, heat 
sterilised, canned…) constitutes the 
largest and most dynamic element of EU 
meat consumption. […] The products are

they can be present at most meal occasions 
– and they appeal to both the older and the 
younger European consumer.’
Gira ‘Strategies & opportunities for

‘Processed meat sales account for some 
40% of total EU meat sales. While raw meat 
retail sales are reaching stagnation in the EU, 
growth in processed foods is accelerating. 
This reflects the consumer drive towards 
convenience, often best delivered by 
meat-based, processed/ready-to-eat 
foods, whether purchased in retail for home 
consumption, or eaten out of home.’

The convenience food market and the food service industry 
are changing what we eat, where we eat and how we shop. 
Across the EU, we are seeing growth in ‘modern’, often 
transnational processed meat products. The category of 
‘ready meals and meal components’ includes complete 
(meat and vegetable) ready meals; ‘exotics’ containing 
quantifiable meat content (eg pizzas and meat salads); and 
convenient meal components (eg industrial burgers).217 All 
have been industrially prepared in some way.218
The European ready meals market, encompassing fresh, 
tinned, frozen and chilled foods, is one of the major growth 
sectors of the European food economy.219 Growth is 
underpinned by the trend towards busier lifestyles and 
convenience.220 The ready meals market in the largest EU 
countries - Germany, france, the U k, italy and Spain - was 
Uk: 
‘Europ Ean capital   of th E rEady m Eal’

worth €8.4 billion ($11.5 billion) in 2007. one analyst predicts 
a further 18% sales hike by 2011, by which point the market 
would be worth €9.9 billion ($13.6 billion).221
Trade data reveal the significance of Brazil as the country of 
origin for much of the beef used by this sector of the market.
in 2008, the EU imported over 100,000 tonnes of processed 
or corned beef from non-EU countries. over 80% of this was 
imported from Brazil.222 
information on the U k market (what people are buying, where 
the beef comes from) is indicative. The U k imports 40% of its 
processed beef (prepared, cooked or tinned) from Brazil (but 
only 3% of fresh, chilled or frozen beef).223 nearly 90% of this 
processed beef comes from Bertin, JBS or marfrig.224
A cOUNTR y THAT  HAS  
fORGOTTEN HOW TO c OOk
‘Sales of ready meals, both frozen and chilled, 
represent 7% of all main meal occasions 
in the UK. Totalling a forecast market value 
of £2.1 billion in 2008, these statistics go 
some way to explaining the reputation within 
Europe of the UK as a country that has 
forgotten how to cook and is now viewed as 
the European capital of the ready meal.’
Ian McGarrigle ‘The Ready Meal Capital’ 
Convenience Foods Autumn 2008
The U k ready meal market is ‘the most advanced in 
Europe’.225 According to Joanna Blythman, by 2004 
Uk consumers were spending £7,000 ($10,600) a 
minute on ready meals, three times more than any other 
country in Europe.226 
According to northern foods ready meals business unit 
director Julian Slade, the market for convenience food has 
grown by 70% over ten years, creating a U k market worth 
almost £25 billion ($38 billion).227
HomE  Conv EniEnCE
Beef is the most frequently eaten red meat in the U k,228 
with two-thirds of it eaten in the home.229 Consumers eat 
almost twice as much prepared beef as unprocessed fresh 
or frozen beef at home.230 About one-third of prepared beef 
eaten at home is found in ready meals.231virtually all U k ready meal sales are private label 
(supermarket own brand).232 Tesco holds more than a 
quarter of U k market share, with £396 million ($600 million) 
of sales in chilled ready meals.233
The leading manufacturing company in the U k market for 
ready meals in 2005 was n orthern f oods. The second-
largest player was Campbell Soup Company, with Unilever 
in third place.234
northern foods has units across the U k and ireland 
specialising in chilled, bakery and frozen food production.235
more than three-quarters of n orthern f oods’ business is 
with five key retailers – Asda, marks & Spencer, morrisons, 
Sainsbury’s and Tesco. it supplies these retailers with a wide 
range of own label and branded food.236 
northern foods make around 140 million chilled ready 
meals every year. The biggest selling chilled ready meal in 
the Uk  is the single portion lasagne for m&S.237 
private label pies containing beef in Asda, morrisons 
and Sainsbury’s state that they were produced in ireland. 
labelling on Sainsbury’s pies reveals that the beef is ‘from 
Brazil or ireland’.
Trade data238 indicate that m arfrig (Bataguassu and 
promissão units) ships to Green isle foods,239 an irish 
subsidiary of northern foods.

Beef is an important part of the catering trade, a component 
of the pre-prepared meat and meat dishes in restaurants, 
pubs, sandwich bars, government or school canteens, 
healthcare establishments such as hospitals, catering 
service providers and takeaway food service outlets. 
The U k eats out a lot. The predicted value of the U k catering 
industry for 2007 was £43.5 billion ($65.9 billion).240 
According to Unilever, the catering industry in the U k serves 
over 10 billion meals per year, with one-fifth of all customers 
eating out at least once a week.241 Catering for the public 
sector – education and healthcare – accounts for more than 
a third of catering industry meals.242

Tallow is rendered beef fat. This raw material is used 
for the production of biodiesel and other oleochemicals. 
A common application of oleochemicals is in the 
production of detergents. According to the European 
oleochemical industry, animal fats cover more than 
50% of oleochemical raw material needs.244
Glycerol (commonly called glycerin or glycerine) 
is a by-product of biodiesel production. i t is widely 
used in medical, pharmaceutical and personal care 
products. it is found in toothpaste, mouthwash, skin 
care products, shaving cream, hair care products and 
soap. it is also used as filler in commercially prepared 
foods (eg cookies), and in shortenings and margarine.245
Sodium tallowate  is made from caustic soda or 
lye and tallow. it is usually combined with sodium 
cocoate, the sodium salt of coconut oil. Together with 
sodium palmate, sodium tallowate is one the main raw 
materials used in the manufacture of soap bars.246
Gelatin is a by-product of the meat and leather 
industry, derived mainly from cattle bones, connective 
tissues, organs and intestines, and hides. it is 
commonly used as a gelling agent in food such as 
‘gummy’ confectionery and as a thickener in yogurt, 
cream cheese, jam or margarine. it is also used 
for clarification of juices such as apple juice.247
Gelatin is also used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic 
industries. Cosmetics contain a non-gelling variant of 
gelatin called hydrolysed collagen, also known as HC p, 
purified gelatin or collagen hydrolysate.248

Three global supermarket giants – Carrefour ( france), 
Casino ( france) and Wal- mart (USA) – are leading 
expansion of the food retail sector in Brazil. 
According to the Brazilian Supermarket Association 
(ABrAS), supermarket sales in Brazil were worth r $158.5 
billion ($76.9 billion) in 2008.249 Despite the economic 
downturn, supermarkets plan to invest r$3.877 billion 
($1.9 billion) in expansion.250
nearly 40% of the sector in Brazil251 is controlled by 
Carrefour, Walmart and Cia Brasiliera de Distribuição 
(known as Grupo p ão de Açúcar)252 – affiliated to the Casino 
group. other foreign-owned groups in the supermarket 
sector in Brazil include the Dutch-owned m akro Group.253
Unilever is the biggest ‘staples’ player in developing and 
emerging markets including Brazil, russia, india and China 
(globally, B riC countries are leading expansion of resource 
consumption). 254
According to Bertin, the global personal hygiene market 
is worth $269 billion, and Brazil has the third largest 
share in this market.255
While Unilever is thought of as a food company, nearly 
half of its sales are in home and personal care products256 
and these categories are seen as growth drivers within the 
group. it is a global leader in deodorants and skincare, the 
world’s number two in hair care,257 and ‘sells more laundry 
washes than any other company in the world’.258
Unilever identifies the central role of home and personal 
care products in emerging markets, ‘where we can build 
on leadership positions, for example in laundry, while 
bringing the very best of Unilever’s brands and products 
to new customers’.259 
Unilever, Colgate palmolive and Johnson & Johnson are 
all listed as key consumers in Brazil of Bertin hygiene 
and beauty sector products.
in 2004, Bertin bought the Brazilian company ox, 
producer of cosmetics with cattle marrow in the 
composition. The ox  brand is available across Brazil in 
130 different personal care products.260
While the Blue Chip companies behind reputable global 
brands appear to believe that Amazon sources are 
excluded from their products,261 Greenpeace investigations 
expose for the first time how their blind consumption of raw 
materials fuels deforestation and climate change.

Greenpeace has identified hundreds of ranches 
within the Amazon rainforest supplying cattle to 
slaughterhouses in the Amazon region belonging to these companies. Where Greenpeace was able to 
obtain mapped boundaries for ranches, satellite  
analysis reveals that significant supplies of cattle  
come from ranches active in recent and illegal 
deforestation. Trade data also reveal trade with  
ranches using modern-day slavery. Additionally,
