Forest Destruction Fuels Regional Conflicts
Environmental and social impacts of the Liberian timber industry
The timber industry in Liberia is a lucrative one – at least for a country whose estimated
Gross Domestic Product is only around US$450 million. The forestry sector raised well overUS$100 million in 2000
1, and it has long been one of the prime sources of Government
revenue. Following a UN ban on all diamond exports from Liberia in March 20012, it has
become an industry which provides the main source of export earnings for the Liberian
Government.
But it is also an industry that poses a major threat in the West African region, not only to the
survival of the last West African rainforests, but also to national and regional security.
Recent reports by a Panel of Experts to the UN Security Council (UNSC) reveal the Liberian
timber industry to be involved in a series of environmental and human rights abuses3. These
range from driving the destruction of the Liberia’s remaining forests to illegal arms traffickingto the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Sierra Leone. In light of these revelations,Greenpeace is calling on governments and the forest industry worldwide to stop their role in
supporting these activities, by refusing to import wood and wood products coming from
companies known to be involved in these scandals.
Liberia’s forests: the last remnants of a biodiversity hotspot
What’s at stake
Due to their accessible lowland locations and ready coastal access, most of the tropical
forests of West Africa have already undergone substantial logging activity and in many areasthese degraded forests have by now been converted to agricultural use. It is estimated thatalmost 90 percent of these forests have already been destroyed and what remains is heavily
fragmented.

After years of overharvesting in the Upper Guinean Forest Ecosystem – a rainforest belt
which once covered the whole of Liberia, plus parts of Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ivory Coast,Ghana and Togo - Liberia’s forest now represents around 45 percent of the region’sremaining forest. It has been identified as one of 25 threatened biodiversity ‘hotspots’ globally,
and supports many species which are found nowhere else. This forest is home to some 9,000
species of plants and more than 1,300 species of vertebrate animals. It also supports the only
viable populations of the Pygmy hippopotamus ( Hexaprotodon liberiensis ) and represents the
last stronghold of the forest elephant ( Loxodonta africana cyclotis ) in West Africa
5.
Liberia’s forest is also the life-line of the country’s indigenous communities who rely on the
forest for their livelihood. It provides shelter for their cultural and religious practices including
shrines, traditional bush schools and cover for the streams, and is a vital source of foods,medicinal herbs and other materials.

UNSC imposed ban on Liberia’s diamond trade in UNSC Resolution 1343 (2001) adopted on 7th March 2001
“until Liberia demonstrates convincingly that it is no longer involved in the trafficking of arms to, or diamondsfrom, Sierra Leone” UNSC (2000)

Time to act
But this forest stronghold may not last for much longer. The European Commission’s JointResearch Centre (EC JRC) has recently reported high levels of deforestation in Liberia’sremaining lowland rainforests, citing intensive logging as the primary cause of forest loss
6.
Meanwhile, just one company – Oriental Timber Company (OTC) – has recently been grantedlogging rights to 1.6 million hectares of the country’s total 4.8 million hectares of forest. That’sone third of the country’s remaining forest
7. According to the Liberian Forest Development
Authority (FDA), a total of around 3 million hectares of the forest (63 %) have already been
allocated to 25 logging companies.

Recent figures reveal that the Liberian timber trade has expanded dramatically over the last 5
years, the income generated by timber exports rising from US$5 million to at least US$ 100million annually
8. This rapid expansion in Liberia’s logging industry has resulted in an industry
which is essentially unregulated. The direct and indirect implications of an unregulatedindustry operating at this level of forest exploitation will be severe, including loss of habitatsand species, human displacement and cultural erosion and the long-term effects resulting
from deforestation such as floods, droughts and changes in regional and global climate.
Liberia’s forest industry and regional security
In December 2000, a meeting of a Panel of Experts to the UN Security Council (UNSC)
named Liberia’s timber industry as one of several regional players involved in illegallysupplying arms to RUF rebels in its war-torn neighbour, Sierra Leone, in defiance of existingUN sanctions
9. The report revealed that the Liberian timber industry was involved in a series
of illicit activities including the acquisition of weapons, and noted that roads built andmaintained for timber exploitation were also used to move weapons from Liberia to Sierra
Leone. The meeting recommended a temporary embargo on Liberian timber exports “until
Liberia could convincingly demonstrate that it was no longer involved in the trafficking of armsto, or diamonds from, Sierra Leone”. However, early in 2001, China and France – the twomain importers of Liberian timber
10 – objected to the inclusion of timber sanctions, which was
subsequently excluded from the final report11.

8 Global Witness (2001) reports total timber production in 2000 of 934,000 cubic metres, with a world market
value of US$187 million. However, both Global Witness (2000) and UNSC (2001) note that official statisticsare likely to underestimate real exports by 50 to 200 percent as a result of tax evasion and undeclared timberflowing through the Ivory Coast.

Since then, the British-based environmental and human rights organisation, Global Witness,
and the UNSC have both released compelling evidence linking Liberia’s President Charles
Taylor and the Liberian timber industry to the illegal trade in arms12. Their work reveals that:
• taxes from the logging industry have been used by Taylor to maintain brutal paramilitary
units involved in human rights abuses
• Taylor tried to acquire several thousand ak 47 assault rifles and an unknown quantity of
rpg-7 rocket-propelled grenades from Libya in May 2001
• logging companies have been recruiting and arming ex-combatants – often from Taylor’s
now defunct National Patriotic Front – to build up private militias
• a number of companies employ indiscriminate logging practices which show no regard
for their environmental or social impact
Forest destroyers and arms dealers: who’s involved?
Of some 25 companies producing timber in Liberia, there is strong evidence against severalwhich are guilty of either causing environmental damage, abusing human rights, runningprivate militia and/or trafficking illegal arms to RUF rebels in Sierra Leone.
The largest – the Oriental Timber Company – is also the most notorious. Other companies
implicated in one or more of these scandals include the Royal Timber Corp (RTC),
Mohammed Group of Companies (MGC) and INLAND Logging Company (ILC). In addition,
the UNSC report from December 2000, named three companies known to be “providing alarge amount of unrecorded extrabudgetary income to President Taylor for unspecifiedpurposes”: Exotic and Tropical Timber Enterprise (ETTE), FORUM Liberia and OTC.
Key Player: Oriental Timber Company
13
OTC, which is closely linked to the Hong-Kong based Global Star Holdings, is by far the
largest and most notorious logging company operating in Liberia. It is a company whoseoperations are characterised by corruption, illegality and total disregard for the environmentalor social impact of their indiscriminate logging practices.
Key companies involved in Liberia’s forestry scandals
Company Description
Oriental Timber Company
(OTC)By far the largest – and most notorious – logging company operating in Liberia. It is run
by Dutch national Gus Kouwenhoven, a close associate of President Taylor.Kowenhoven has been described as “responsible for the logistical aspects of many of
the arms deals [with the Revolutionary United Front, Sierra Leone].
Royal Timber Corp (RTC) The second largest timber operation in Liberia, RTC is also run by Gus Kouwenhoven,
and is believed to have vastly under-reported its timber production in the last twoyears.
Mohammed Group of
Companies (MGC)Two companies – Salami Molowi Inc (SMI) and Bureaux Ivorian Ngorian (BIN) – owned
by Mohammed Salamé, a Liberian based in Ivory Coast. Salamé has been involved in
assisting sanctions-busting arms transfers to Liberia.
INLAND Logging
Company (ILC)Managed by Maurice and Oscar Cooper, both long-term associates of President
Taylor. The company reports that it exported around 20,000 cubic metres of logs in
2000, but there are indications that this figure was actually much higher - nearer50,000 cubic metres. The ILC has a private militia, which harasses and intimidates
local communities in Sinoe County.
Sources:  UNSC (2000); Global Witness (2001)
OTC is believed to have paid somewhere between US$ 3 and 5 million to President Taylor to
obtain its huge concession – the largest in Liberia’s history. Yet despite yielding hundreds ofthousands of cubic metres of valuable timber each year, the concession agreement has neverbeen ratified by the Liberian Congress – and is thus not legally valid.
                                                
12 Global Witness (2001) UNSC (2001)
13 Information from Global Witness (2001) unless stated otherwise.

OTC has built several dozens of criss-crossing roads throughout Liberia’s pristine forest,
without conducting a single impact study, and has operated in flagrant violation of the FDA
and its contractual regulations. It has invaded neighbouring concessions, and appears to beopening up between 5,000 and 10,000 hectares of undisturbed forest every month. That’s anarea the size of almost 500 soccer pitches every day.
The company also operates in violation of national labour laws, particularly regarding worker
safety. It has shown a total disregard for the rights and customs of local people, and has met
local government officials and the FDA with police intimidation and arrest. It also operates aprivate militia whose members are armed with AK-47s.
OTC’s Dutch president, Gus Kouwenhoven, has been described as “responsible for the
logistical aspects of many of the arms deals [with the Revolutionary United Front, Sierra
Leone].”
14 He also runs the Royal Timber Corporation (RTC) in the northwest of the country,
which is strategically located on the border with Sierra Leone. In March 2001 the UNSCimposed sanctions on Liberia for its role in blocking the peace process in Sierra Leone. Themeasures imposed included restricting the travel of certain individuals – includingKouwenhoven.
Public outcry against OTC has been widespread in both national and international press. Yet
President Taylor continues to defend OTC, and has responded to criticism with measuressuch as removing people from office, police intimidation and arrests on the grounds of threatsto national security.
Driving the industry
Since at least 70 percent of the wood produced in Liberia is destined for the export market
15,
the key actors driving this destructive, corrupt and destabilising industry, are clearly thecountries importing the timber coming from these companies.
Traditionally, Liberia exported logs largely to Europe. But today, this market has shifted
increasingly to Asia as newly arrived companies such as OTC have concentrated more onselling materials to plywood and other processing factories that supply the South-East Asianmarkets. According to official figures
16 China (45%) was by far the largest importer of Liberian
timber in 2000, followed by France (26%) and Italy (12%). In total, the EU was responsible for
more than 50 percent of imports in 2000.

Greenpeace call for action
In the run up to next year’s Ancient Forest Summit17, Greenpeace is urgently calling on World

17 The Ancient Forest Summit is the 6th Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. It will
be held in April next year, in The Hague, The Netherlands and will have a mandate to agree a 10 year

Governments to:
• stop the destruction – by stopping any further industrial activities in intact ancient forest
until responsible plans for forest conservation and sustainable use have been agreed
• clean up the timber trade – by ensuring that timber is produced and traded in a legal and
ecologically responsible way
• come up with the money – by providing at least US$15 billion each year to pay for forest
conservation and sustainable development
In the light of the evidence implicating Liberian logging companies in illegal and destructive
logging and revealing their role as a threat to regional security, Greenpeace is urging thegovernments of all importing countries to immediately stop their role in the destruction ofLiberian forests. To this end, governments must start demanding that all wood and wood
products entering national ports must come from legal and well-managed forest operations
according to high social and ecological standards
