Executiv e summ ary 
We are destroying the world’s precious ancient forests at an unprecedented rate.
An area of natural forest the size of a football pitch is cut down every two seconds.
Half of the forest lost in the last 10,000
years has been destroyed in the last 80
years and half of that destruction has taken
place since the mid 1970s.
Forest loss has a direct link to loss of 
biodiversity.The current extinction rate of
plant and animal species is around 1,000
times faster than in pre-human times – and
this will increas e to 10,000 times faster by
2050. Scientis ts predict that the Earth is
entering the sixth major extinction event in
its history.This is the first one to occur
becaus e of human activity.
Until now,world maps have not been 
sufficiently accur ate or consis tent to reveal
which forest areas remai n intact,which
have been damaged and to what extent. This
has made it difficult to see which forest
areas are most in need of protection.
Greenpeace has created a new map of the
world’s forests,based on the most up to
date,high-resolu tion satellite image ry and a
consis tent set of criteria.It shows us the
remai ning large forest areas and lets uscompare them directly and accur ately,for
the first time.
This ground breaki ng research shows that
the world’s remai ning ancient forests are in
crisis and that fewer intact forest 
landscapes than previously thought are left.
To save them, we must act now.
Damage to ancient forests is not just about
total deforestation.It is also about the
degradati on of forest to a point at which it
is no longer a viable habitat for its plant
and animal species.In the tropics alone ,
over 5 million square kilometres of forest
have been degraded by destructive logging
and a further 3.5 million square kilometres
has been totall y deforested during the last
few decades.
Only intact forest landscapes of several
thousands of square kilometres are large
enough to sustain healthy populati ons of
many large r forest animals. They are also
better able to adapt to the changing global
climate.

To preserve these last intact forests and the biodiversity they suppor t,we must protect
large ,unbroken areas from further industrial exploitation.The moment a road or pipeline is
built the forest and its precious balance of interdepend ent species begins to be destroyed.
These maps are a starting point for monitoring these last large forests landscapes now and
in the future and are the baseline for a roadmap to recovery.
World governments can use these maps to identify which forest areas are most in need of
protection and to fast track setting up a global networ k of protected forest areas.
Summary of findings:
•Less than 10 percent of the planet’s land area remains as intact forest 
landscapes.
•82 countries out of 148 countries lying within the forest zone have lost all 
their intact forest landscapes.
The majority of the world’s last remaining intact forest landscapes consist of
two major forest types - tropical rainforest and boreal forest.
•49 percent are the tropical forests of Latin America, Africa and 
Asia Pacif ic.
•44 percent are the great boreal forests of Russia, Canada and Alaska.
6World governments can use these maps to identify which forest areas are
most in of protection and to fast track setting up a global networ k of 
protected forest areas

7The propor tion of the remaining intact forest landscapes of the world are
located as follows:
•35 percent are in Latin America.
The Amazon rainforest is mainly located in Brazil, which clears a larger area of forest 
annually than any other countr y in the world.
•28 percent are in North America.
North America destroys 10,000 square kilometres of ancient forests every year.
Many of the fragmented forests of southern Canada and the United States lack 
adequate travel corridors and functioning ecosystems for large mamm als.
•19 percent are in Northern Asia.
Northern Asia is home to the second largest boreal forest in the world.The Siberian 
tiger once roamed across huge areas of Northern Asia but today it can only be found in
a small area of intact forest near the Sea of Japan. Only 400 remain in the wild, with 
twice as many in zoos.
•7 percent are in South Asia Pacific. 
The Paradise Forests of Asia Pacif ic are being destroy ed faster than any other forest 
on Earth.Much of the large intact forest landscapes have alread y been cut down,
72% in Indon esia and 60% in Papua New Guinea.
•8 percent are in Africa.
Africa has lost most of its intact forest landscapes in the last 30 years. The timber 
industr y is responsible for destroying huge areas of intact forest landscapes and 
continues to be the single largest threat to these areas.
•Less than 3 percent are in Europe. 
In Europe ,more than 150 square kilometres of intact forest landscapes fall victim to 
the chainsa w every year and the last areas of the region’ s intact forest landscapes in 
European Russia are shrinking rapidly .

To save the world’s remaining intact forest landscapes, Greenpeace is calling on 
governments to:
•establish moratoria on new industrial developments in all intact forest landscapes.
•set up a global networ k of protected forest areas encompassi ng all forests with a high 
conservation value while the moratoria are in place. This must involve local stakeholders 
and the prior informed consent of indigenous peoples and other local commun ities.
•ban forest products that come from illegal or destructive sources.
•ensure sufficient financial resour ces for conservation and cut subsidies that threaten 
forests.

Introduction
Forests are vital to the future of life.They are home to two thirds of all known species of
land plants and anim als and to thousands of indigenous peoples that rely on them for
food,water and other basic materials. They also play a key role in regulating local and
global climates.
We are destroying forests at an 
unpreced ented rate.An area of natur al 
forest the size of a football pitch is cut
down every two seconds. Half of the forest
lost in the last 10,000 years was destroyed
in the last 80 years and half of that
destruction took place over the last 30
years.
When we destroy forests,we also eliminate
the diversity of life they suppor t.The loss
and fragmentati on of intact forest habitats
is the main reason why many plant and 
animal species are threatened with 
extinction.Large r animals, such as 
primates, are particular ly vulne rable to 
forest loss becaus e they usuall y need a
greate r roaming and feeding area to 
survive.
The current extinction rate of plant and 
animal species is approximately 1,000 timesfaster than it was in pre-human times.
Scientis ts predict that the Earth is entering
the sixth major extinction event in its 
history and say that extinction rates will
further increas e 10 fold by the year 2050.
Biologists believe ancient forests contai n
vast numbe rs of undiscovered species.These
too could be driven to extinction before we
even find them. This biological catas trophe
threatens all life,includ ing our own.
To protect the world’s remai ning ancient
forests,world governments must urgentl y
establish moratoria on new industrial 
developments in intact forest landscapes.
The moratoria must stay in place until they
instigate proper conservation plans based
on a global networ k of protected forest
areas.

Why are intact forest landscapes impor tant? 
Ancient forests provide a home to an incred ible diversity of plant and animal life.
Orang-utans, eagles,wolves, jaguars,bears,gorillas,elephants, tigers,birds, deer,frogs,
orchids,insects and,last but not least,trees - from saplings to old giants.
Ancient forests also provide food,shelter,medicine,clean air and water.They make soil and
slopes stable and mitigate droughts, floods and other disasters.
It is crucial to protect and preserve forests in large ,intact landscapes becaus e they are less
vulne rable to threats beyond their boundar ies,such as the invasion of alien species as well
as to drought, loss of humidity and the resultant risk of fire.
Only intact forest landscapes of several thousands of square kilometres are large enough to
sustain healthy populati ons of many large r forest animals.Their flora and fauna is better
able to survive natur al disturbances such as fires and storms.Large forest areas are also
better able to adapt to the changing global climate.
Threats
The key threats to forest ecosys tems and ancient forests in particular are:
– destructiv e and illegal logging
– forest clearing for agriculture and pasture
– road building and other infrastructure such as new settlements, pipelin es 
and navigable waterways 
– mining for metals,petroleum and natural gas
– damming for hydropo wer
– excessiv e remo val of vegetation (firewood, building materials, overgrazing)
– over-hunting and the bush meat trade
– climate change
The root causes of these threats includ e unsus tainable consumpti on of wood, paper and
other forest products as well as increas ed demand for agricultur al products such as meat,
soya and palm oil.
In many countr ies,most of the land is contr olled by a few rich people. This drives poor 
people deeper and deeper into previously inaccessib le forest.In addition,perverse energy,
transpor t,logging and agricultur al policies create incenti ves to destroy forests,for instance
in the form of public subsidies for road building,agriculture ,mining or forestry.
Corruption,lack of governance and lack of enforcement of forest related laws allows illegal
and destructive logging to thrive.Apar t from indiscriminately destroying the forest,illegal
and destructive logging brings exploitation and deprivation to local commun ities. It also
undercuts the price of legally and responsib ly logged timber,making responsib le forest 
management less viable.
At the Earth Summ it of the United Nations in Rio de Janeir o in 1992, governments from
around the world agreed to conserve biological diversity (Convention on Biological
Diversity) and combat dangerous climate change.Ancient forests are crucial for both.
They are home to most land based species and they prevent significant amounts of carbon
from being released to the atmosphe re and thus contr ibuting to climate change.
The world’s remai ning intact forest landscapes and the biodiversity they suppor t have
reached crisis point,but it is not too late to save them.

The Amazon basin in Latin America is the
largest tropical rainforest in the world. To
the north-west, it stretches into the Central
American rainforests and mountain forests,
to the south-east into the Atlantic rainforest
and tropical dry forests and woodlands. To
the south, it reaches the Yunga mountain
forests on the easter n slopes of the Andes.
One fifth of the world´s fresh water runs
through the Amazon’s river system and
approximately half of all land based plants
and animals live in its rainforest. The
Amazon is the last refuge for the jaguar ,
which lives in the tropical rainforests ofSouth and Central America and has 
recorded ranges of up to 800 kilometres. 
The Amazon is also home to millions of 
people, including indigenous peoples such as
the Deni in Brazil, whose tribes have lived
in close harmony with the forest for 
thousands of years. Their lives are destroyed
along with the animals and plants when the
forest is cut down. 
Most of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil,
which clears a larger area of forest annually
than any other countr y in the world. 
13In 2005, after pressure from Greenpeace ,local commun ities and other organisations,50
thousand square kilometres of Amaz onian rainforest were protected in the Terra do Meio
region of Para state in Brazil.These new reserves repres ent one of the biggest global 
conservation achievements. This is becaus e they connec t to forests that were alread y 
protected,includ ing indigenous lands.

In 2004, plans to flood 100 square kilometres of
Patagonian rainforest to build a dam for Canad ian
aluminium giant, Noranda, were put on hold 
following a campai gn by Greenpeace and other
organisations.
The second larges t coastal tempe rate rainforest in
the world stretches across Patagonia in southern
South America,from the Pacific coast of southern
Chile up to the Andean mountai ns and over the 
border into southern Argenti na.
Isolated from other major forest regions by the
Andes and the Pacific,this forest has evolved a 
unique and diverse spectrum of species such as
southern beeches, monk ey puzzle trees and alerce,a
southern relative of the Californian redwood tree,
many of which are more than a thousand years old.
Destructive and illegal logging and timber 
plantati ons have fragmented and degraded most of
this forest,espec ially in the coastal lowlands and
the north.The remai ning intact forest landscapes
are mostly in the southern mountai ns.
Patagonia’s forests are home to the Darwi n frog,
the Chilote fox and the Andean deer,which used to
roam from the coast to the high mountai ns.Now it
can only be found at remote ,high altitud es between
3,300 and 5,000 metres and only a few thousand
deer are left.
These forests are also home to indigenous 
commun ities, such as the Pehuenche and Mapuche ,
who have long depend ed on the natur al forest
wealth for their way of life.Key findings:
•34 percent of the Patagonian forest zone remains 
as intact forest landscapes.
•Less than 1 percent of the world’s last intact 
forest landscapes are in Patagonia. 
•82 percent of Patagonia’s intact forest landscapes 
are in Chile, 18 percent in south Argentina.
•32 percent of the intact forests are strictly 
protected. 
•Over 89 percent of all intact forest landscapes in 
Patagonia are in the temperate broadleaf and 
mixed forest biome. The remaining 11 percent is 
woodland, shrubland, mountain ecosystems and 
glaciers within forest landscapes.

18The second larges t tropical rainforest in the
world lies in the Congo basin,the green heart of
Africa.It stretches into West African rainforests
and into dry forests,woodlands and bush land to
the south.
The Congo Basin is home to an immens e 
diversity of plants and mammals, includ ing
spectacular species such as forest elephants.
Many animals are unique to Congo’s rainforest,
such as the Congo peacock and the Okapi. Many
more wait to be discovered.It is also home to
three species of Great Ape; the gorilla,the 
chimpanz ee and the bonobo. Due to rapidly
increasi ng forest degradati on and poach ing,all
Great Ape species face extinction.
Tens of millions of people depend on the Centr al
African forests for their survival.Bantu subsis tence farmers,fishing commun ities and
semi-nomad ic ’pygmies’all need these forests for
shelter,medicine and food.Entire cultures in this
region are based on their relationship with 
rainforests.
Consi derable efforts to create protected areas in
Africa have been made in the last 10 years but
forest management is often poor or non-e xistent.
Conservation efforts are thwar ted becaus e of a
lack of political will,money and staff,corruption
and,in some cases,even war.
Africa has lost most of its intact forest 
landscapes in the last 30 years.The timber
industry is responsib le for destroying huge areas
of intact forest landscapes and continues to be
the single larges t threat to these areas.Following years of investigations by the Greenpeace Forest Crimes Unit to uncover illegal logging in
Africa and the continent’s trade in illegally and destructively logged timber with Europe,a numbe r
of initiatives have been undertaken to reform Africa’s logging industry.Came roon has set up 
independ ent monitoring of the logging industry and a numbe r of logging compan ies are slowly 
moving towards less destructive and more responsib le forest management practices.

At the end of 2002, it was estimated that
only 3,500 Sumatr an orang-utans remai ned
and these are in protected areas too small
for their long-term survival.In 2003, Greenpeace and its partners helped
indigenous commun ities (the customar y
lando wners) throw a Malaysian company
involved in illegal logging,off their land in 
western Papua New Guinea.
Greenpeace is now suppor ting the commun ities’
efforts to move towards eco-forestry and to hold
the company ,Concord Pacific (a subsidiary of
Saml ing),to account for the damage it caused.
The company is facing charges in the Papua
New Guinea court for trespassi ng during its 
illegal logging activities.
The forests of South Asia Pacific stretch from
the Himalay as and China in the north,through
the Paradise Forests (Indonesia, Papua New
Guinea and the Solomon Islands) and to
Tasman ia and New Zealand in the south.This
incred ibly diverse region suppor ts hundreds of
indigenous cultures and creatures found nowhere
else in the world,such as 38 species of the 
exotic bird of paradise found on the island of
New Guinea.
Roughl y half of the animals found on this island
are unique to the region and hundreds of new
species have recentl y been discovered there,
includ ing the rediscovered Berlepsch´s six-wiredbird of paradise and the golden-mantled tree
kangaroo.
Millions of people live under these forest
canopies and enjoy a relationship with the
forests that we cannot even imagine.The cultur al
diversity of these commun ities is astonishing.
More than 1,000 languages are spoken in New
Guinea alone - one sixth of all the languages
spoken on Earth.
While Brazil clear s a large r area of forest 
annuall y,the Paradise Forests are being
destroyed faster than any other on Earth.
Much of the large intact forest landscapes have
alread y been destroyed – 72 percent in
Indonesia and 60 percent in Papua New Guinea.
In Papua New Guinea,58 of the 260 known
mammal species and 33 of the 720 known bird
species are threatened. Javan rhinoceros once
roamed throughou t South-Eas t Asia. It is 
estimated that there are now less than 100 left.
Sumatr an tigers,the last of the island tigers,are
also in danger,numbe ring just 500 in the wild.
At the end of 2002, it was estimated that only

More than 10,000 square kilometres of North
American ancient forests are clearcut every yearIn 2006, following a decade of campai gning by Greenpeace ,other non-g overnment organizations and
indigenous peoples, the government of the west Canad ian province of British Columbia pledged to
ensure protection of 20,000 square kilometres of the Great Bear Rainforest and to dramaticall y
improve logging practices in the rest of the forest.
More than 10,000 square kilometres of North
American ancient forests are clearcut every year.
This affec ts the future of forest depend ent plants
and animals, amon g them grizzly bear,puma,
woodland caribou and grey wolf.The wolf was
once one of the most widespread mammals on
Earth.The North American wolf populati on has
been decimated by hunti ng and habitat 
destruction over the last two hundred years.
Many of the fragmented forests of southern
Canada and the United States, with the excepti on of Alaska, lack adequate travel 
corridors and functioning ecosys tems for large
mammals.
Forest destruction also affec ts the livelihoods of
indigenous peoples such as the Haida of Haida
Gwaii island on the Canad ian west coast,and
the Innu of the east Canad ian province of
Quebec. Canada has one million indigenous 
people. 80 percent live in forest-bas ed 
commun ities and depend on the forest for their
livelihoods and cultur al sustenance.

In European Russia, Greenpeace helped get
moratoria on 12 forest areas that had been
granted logging concessi ons.Amon g them are
intact forest landscapes. Two new national parks
are in the process of being established in the
region.
Most of Europe’s remai ning forest lies in the far
north and the north-eas t.To the south,it 
stretches into patches of tempe rate broadleaved
forests that once covered most of centr al and
western Europe.Further south are remnants of
Mediterranean forest,woodland and scrub.
Only 14 percent of Europe´s forests are intact
forest landscapes. Over 90 percent are in
European Russia, 3 percent in Finland and a 
further 3 percent in Swed en.These intact forest
landscapes, with lakes,riversides and swamps
surrounded by forests,are the last refuge for
many plant and animal species,includ ing the
Brown bear,which once lived in forests all over
Europe,from Scand inavia and Russia to the
Mediterranean Sea.
In the far North of Europe live the Komi and the
reindeer herding Sami and Nenets indigenous
peoples. The ongoing degradati on and 
fragmentati on of the forest is a growing threat
to these people’s livelihoods as well as to
European plants and animals.More than 150 square kilometres of intact 
forest landscapes fall victim to the chainsaw in
Europe every year and the last areas of Europe’s
intact forest landscapes in European Russia are
shrinking rapidly.Logging,road building,mining,
oil and gas pipelines and railways are cutting the
intact forest landscapes into small fragments.
Forest management standards in European
Russia are very poor and large clearcuts are the
norm.In Finland, some of the last intact forests
that grow on traditional Sami herding land are
being logged by the Finnish Forest Service
(Metsahall itus).

grows mostly in the far north of the region.To
the south and the east,the forest stretches into
tempe rate forests.The Russian taiga (boreal
coniferous forest) thrives even at tempe ratures
of minus 50 degrees Celsius. In spite of the
extreme conditions,countless fungi,ferns,lichens
and moss es grow there.
Spann ing thousands of kilometres, the 
landscapes change from tundr a,with stunted
willows and birches in the far north to dense
coniferous,broadleaved and mixed forests in the
south.Even large animals, such as elk,brown
bear,lynch and the Siberian Tiger in the 
south-eas t,can find enough food in these vastareas. The Siberian Tiger once roamed across
huge areas of Northern Asia but today it can
only be found in a small area of intact forest
near the Sea of Japan. Only 400 remai n in the
wild,with twice as many in zoos.
Like other forest regions,the snow forests of
Northern Asia are also home to hundreds of
indigenous peoples. The diversity of plant and
animal species is greate r in the region’s southern
rainforests between the Amur River and the Sea
of Japan, than in the larch forests of the north
part of the region.The threat of illegal and
destructive logging is also greate r in the south
than the north,and is increasi ng with the 
expansi on of the timber trade from Russia to
China,Japan and Korea.Greenpeace helped protect 195,000 square kilometres of Siberian wilderness by pushing for them to
be listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. A large part is within intact forest landscapes. The most
famous World Heritage Sites with intact forest landscapes in Northern Asia are Lake Baikal, the
volcanoes of Kamtchatka, Altai and the Sikhote-Al in mountai ns.

31What Can Be Done?
This ground breaking research shows that the world’s remaining ancient forests are in
crisis and that fewer intact forest landscapes than previously thought are left.
To save them, we must act now.
Protected Areas
Today,only 8 percent of the world’s intact
forest landscapes are in strictly protected
areas. To preserve these last intact forests
and the biodiversity they suppor t,we must
protect large ,unbroken areas from further
industrial exploitation.The moment a road
or pipeline is built the forest and its 
precious balance of interdepend ent species
begins to be destroyed.
Empo werment of Local
Comm unities
Over one billion people worldwide rely on
intact forests for their daily survival.Living
in thousands of small commun ities either in
the forests or on their edges, they rely on it
for the basics of life - food,medicine and
building materials.Becaus e they live in 
harmony with the forest and depend on it,
they are also the main guardians of the 
forest.
In many forested areas, such indigenous
commun ities have rights under law to 
protect their land from logging compan ies
that decimate their environment and their
lives.Yet,these commun ities are ill equipped
to take on the huge corporations behind the
loggers.
Greenpeace works closely with forest 
commun ities to help them make a living
from the forest withou t destroying it,and to
reduce the pressure on them to hand their
forest land over to destructive logging 
compan ies.It is also helping to identify ,
mark out and map the boundar ies of 
commun ities’ territorial land, a key tool that
helps establish their rights over their tribal
territories so they can protect the forests.Responsible Forest
Management
Damage to ancient forests is not just about
total deforestation.It is also about the
degradati on of forest to a point at which it
is no longer a viable habitat for its plant
and animal species.In the tropics alone ,
over 5 million square kilometres of forest
have been degraded by destructive logging
and a further 3.5 million square kilometres
has been totall y deforested during the last
few decades.Clear cutting and other forms
of destructive logging have also damaged
and degraded large areas of boreal and
tempe rate forests.
Logging compan ies often try to get around
environmental laws by promising that they
will only harvest a certain numbe r of 
selected trees from forest areas in which
local governments allow limited logging.In
reality,huge mach inery thund ers through
the undisturbed forest,crushing and 
damag ing plants and animals in its way,
decimating local commun ities, pollu ting
waterways and damag ing those trees that
are not cut.The results are devastating - a
scarred landscape of isolated trees, unlikely
to survive withou t their neighbour s,and a
forest stripped of its plant and animal life.
Forests can provide timber withou t being
destroyed,using a way of selecting and
extracting certain trees withou t damag ing
the surrounding habitat. Responsib le forest
management is certified under the Forest
Stewardsh ip Counc il (FSC). However,FSC
certified forest areas account for only 2 
percent of all forests,and destructive and 
illegal logging is a constant threat to the
work of the FSC as well as to the forests
thems elves.
This ground breaki ng research shows that the world’s remai ning
ancient forests are in crisis and that fewer intact forest landscapes
than previously thought are left.To save them, we must act now

32A call for Action
Greenpeace is calling on governments to:
•establish moratoria on new industrial developments in all intact forest landscapes. 
•set up a global network of protected forest areas encompassing all forests with a high 
conser vation value while the moratoria are in place. This must involve local stakeholders 
and the prior informed consent of indigenous peoples and other local communities.
•ban forest products that come from illegal or destr uctive sources.
•ensure sufficient financial resources for conser vation and cut subsidies that threaten forests.
You can also help protect ancient forests:
•pressure your government. Demand it stops allowing forest destruction.
•call on it to protect the last remai ning ancient forests.
•ask it to introduce legislation banning impor ts of illegally and destructively sourced 
forest products into your countr y.
•only buy "good wood" that is marked with the FSC logo and ask your store to suppl y 
FSC timber and paper products.
•reduce your consumpti on of paper,timber and other forest products,particular ly 
disposab le products and give prefe rence to recycled paper and other recycled material.
•log on to www.greenpeace.org to find out how you can suppor t Greenpeace in its work 
to protect the world’s remai ning ancient forests.
What is the FSC?
The Forest Stewardship Council, or FSC, is an independent scheme that certifies responsible
harvesting of forests  - and clearly labels the products made out of wood from responsible
forestr y.  Set up in 1994, the FSC promotes responsible forestr y in over 700,000 square 
kilometres of forests in 66 countries - and that is expanding ever year.
When you buy a timber product carrying the logo of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC),
you can be sure it comes from an environmentally appropriate and socially beneficial source.
FSC is the only, internationally recognised, forest certification scheme that can give credible
assurance that timber products come from legally and responsibly managed forests. It is also
the only scheme supported by major environmental groups as well as progressive timber 
companies and many indigenous people’s organisations.
Thank you for reading this information. Ancient forests suppor t all life on
Earth.They need our help. Together ,we can save them.

33Methodology and Definitions 
This global map follows a first assessment of intact forest landscapes conducted by the
World Resource Institute in 1997, ”The Last Frontier Forests”. The new Greenpeace
map is more accurate because it is entirely based on the latest available satellite
imagery,which is mostly from 2001 and 2002. It is also based on strict interpret ation
rules to make the results as globally comparable as possible .
1.The forest zone (see below for definition) was identified using existing data based on the
latest available medium resolu tion satellite data (MODIS) and all areas outside the 
forest zone (more than half of the world´s land cover) exclud ed from the assessments.
2.Topographic maps showing roads, settlements and other human infrastructure were 
used to further exclud e all areas within the forest zone that has been fragmented to 
areas smalle r 500 square kilometres.
3.Only unfragmented areas large r 500 square kilometres - as derived from the 
topog raphic information - were subjec t to fine scale analysis of fragmentati on and other
human impac ts using high resolu tion satellite image ry (Landsat 7) in order to identify 
intact forest landscapes (see below for definition).
‘Intact forest landscapes’ (green in the maps) are defined for the purpose of this 
global-scale map as blocks of mostly forested,but also non-f orested (e.g. swamps), areas
large r 500 square kilometres and a minimum width of 10 kilometres within the forest zone
that show no visible sign of significant human impac t (e.g. logging,burning).Exclud ed
from these intact forest landscapes were one km buffe r zones around human infrastructure
(e.g. roads, waterways, settlements) and fire scars in the vicinity of human infrastructure
where most fire regimes have been significantl y altered (e.g. increas ed fire frequency).
It shoul d be noted that some human impac t is invisible from space (e.g. small forest roads
and paths or specifically in Centr al African forests the decline of populati ons of large
mammals as a result of over-hunti ng).Also smalle r scale impac ts (e.g. some selective 
logging) that happened more than 30-70 years ago,depend ing on the region,often become
invisible on satellite image ry or undistinguishab le from the natur al dynam ics of the forest.
The most recent human impac ts are not shown on this map becaus e the satellite image ry
used is,on the average,4-5 years old.All this leads to some – albeit globall y 
insignificant - overestimations of intact forest landscapes despite the one km buffe r 
exclusi on zones. Only ground level verification can provide a more accur ate local picture in
these areas.
‘The forest zone’is defined as areas with a tree canop y cover density of above 20 per
cent, includ ing areas below 20 per cent tree canop y cover density which are fully 
surrounded by the forest zone (data from M.Hans en).
Ancient forests are defined as forests that are shaped large ly by natur al events with little
impac t from human activities. These includ e all intact forest landscapes shown on this map,
but also many intact forests appear ing under the categ ory ’other forest areas’, becaus e
they are smalle r than 500 square kilometres.
‘Other forest areas’ (grey in the maps) includ es all ancient forests smalle r 500 square 
kilometres. Most of the other forest areas are damaged and degraded forests or are tree
plantati ons.
