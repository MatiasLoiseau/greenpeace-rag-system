Hurricane Harvey Air Pollution: Interactive Database
Air Pollution Reported by Oil Refineries, Chemical Plants, and Industrial
Facilities
Reports filed by companies to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ) show that over 5.7 million pounds of air pollution were released by
chemical plants, oil refineries and industrial facilities in the month after
Harvey made landfall. 90% of this air pollution was released by 13 companies.
A crew tries to
contain oil from a damaged oil refinery storage tank in La Porte, Texas more
than a week after Hurricane Harvey devastated the area. The human impacts of
Hurricane Harvey have been staggering, and the greatest concern is for the
people struggling in its aftermath. This disaster makes clear once again that
coastal Texas and the wider Gulf region are on the frontlines of sea level
rise and extreme weather heightened by climate change, as well as the toxic
impacts from fossil fuel infrastructure.

Workers in protective suits stand in the middle of oil covering Hurricane
Harvey flood waters at a refinery in La Porte, Texas, more than a week after
the hurricane hit the area. The human impacts of Hurricane Harvey have been
staggering, and the greatest concern is for the people struggling in its
aftermath. This disaster makes clear once again that coastal Texas and the
wider Gulf region are on the frontlines of sea level rise and extreme weather
heightened by climate change, as well as the toxic impacts from fossil fuel
infrastructure.
METHODOLOGY:
Data collection began on September 5, 2017, with help from Athena Matyear.
There were only 39 final reports filed at that time. This limits our data, as
final reports replace the initial reports on the TCEQ website after being
filed (out of 143 final reports). Thus, 39 initial reports filed by 26
distinct facilities are missing from our collection.
For comparison sake, we included the ability to swap between data from initial
and final estimates of pollution reported to TCEQ. Users can see which
companies initially underestimated their air pollution, and which companies
over-estimated the extent of pollution.
We included every incident reported to TCEQ Regions 10 (Beaumont), 12
(Houston) and 14 (Corpus Christi) from August 23, 2017, when many refineries
began to shut down, to September 25, 2017, a month after Harvey made landfall.
We also included data from other TCEQ
regions when
reports clearly indicated that the pollution was a consequence of hurricane
Harvey.
As of October 24, 2017, not all final reports have been published. 20 final
reports remain un-filed. Many of these reports are “opacity events,” an
industry term for smoke pollution at facilities, which are not measured in
pounds and will not affect current totals.
We merged a few groups of chemicals for the sake of simplifying some of the
data that is displayed. We consolidated various types of butanes, butenes,
pentanes, pentenes, and xylenes, which were (infrequently) reported by
companies with specific isomers or variations. We merged “xylene, mixed
isomers” and “xylene-n” into “xylenes,” as an example. We also combined
nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to display as “Nitrogen Oxides
(NOx),” as both chemicals have similar
effects in terms of acid
rain, smog formation, and human health. All other chemicals are listed exactly
as companies reported them. If in doubt, follow our sources to the TCEQ
website and look at the exact entry by the company.
“Most Hazardous Chemicals”
With credit to a September 1, 2017
report by Shaye Wolf at the Center for Biological
Diversity, our “most hazardous chemicals” list is very similar:





1,3 Butadiene


Benzene
Ethylbenzene
Hexane (and Hexane, n)
Hydrogen Sulfide
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
Sulfur Dioxide
Toluene
Xylenes



“Parent Company”
In many cases, the TCEQ reports filed by petrochemical and industrial
facilities are credited to the company that owns or operates the facility, but
not the ultimate parent company. To the best of our ability, we have
identified the ultimate parent company of each of the subsidiaries that filed
reports.
“Source Report No.”
Each TCEQ has a six-digit number attributed to it. Adding this feature as a
row or column of the database allows you to click on individual cells and open
up the primary source data, and a link to the TCEQ page.
“Equipment Source of Contaminant”
Many of the facilities that were hit by Harvey are very large, and emitted air
pollution from several distinct areas within the facility. The TCEQ reports
specify which equpiment that chemicals were leaked, spilled, or flared from.
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE DATA:
Population demographics around specific industrial facilities was published in
2016 by the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst. See
PERI’smethodology for “environmental justice ratios”  which notes that “in
2014 in the U.S., the share of people living in poverty was 14.5% and the
share of the population that identified as Hispanic or nonwhite was 36.3
percent.”
This data is displayed as “Population Living in Poverty (%) ” and
“Population People of Color (%).” It is only applicable to specific
facilities–for example, the data will not display as averages if you attempt
to apply “Population People of Color” to the county of Brazoria, or to all
facilities owned by ExxonMobil.
Some data was not available, but for seven facilities without available data,
we were able to locate other facilities in the PERI database that are
physically close (within a mile) of the facility without data. Here are the
exact substitutions we used:





For the Citgo Corpus Christi refinery, PERI data from Koch Industries’ Flint Hills West refinery


For the Kinder Morgan Pasadena Terminal, PERI data from the Petrobras Pasadena Refinery
For the Air Liquide facility in Pasadena, PERI data for the Baker Hughes Pasadena facility
For the Blue Cube Operations facility in Freeport, PERI data from the Dow Chemical plant in Freeport
For the INEOS plant in Pasadena, PERI data from BASF Pasadena
For the MPLX Javalina plant in Corpus Christi, PERI data from the closest Air Products facility in Corpus Christi.



And, for the Magellan Midstream facility in Galena Park, data was provided by
the Union of Concerned Scientists and T.e.j.a.s. 2016 report, “Double
Jeopardy in Houston.”

A flare burns at an oil refinery in Baytown, Texas more than a week after
Hurricane Harvey ravaged the area. The human impacts of Hurricane Harvey have
been staggering, and the greatest concern is for the people struggling in its
aftermath. This disaster makes clear once again that coastal Texas and the
wider Gulf region are on the frontlines of sea level rise and extreme weather
heightened by climate change, as well as the toxic impacts from fossil fuel
infrastructure.
SOURCE DATA:
Our source spreadsheet is available for download, below.
Primary sources directly from TCEQ is easy to access, via a pop-up menu, by
clicking the any of the cells in the database while the “Source Report No.”
realm is included.
Greenpeace compiled air pollution reports submitted to the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ) that occurred during the Hurricane Harvey
disaster. TCEQ reports submitted by petrochemical refineries, chemical plants,
oil & gas compressor stations, terminals, and other industrial sites provide
estimates of the type and amounts of chemicals released, in pounds. Data
includes pollution from the shutdown and start-up process for many refineries
and chemical plants, as well as releases due to physical damage from Harvey.
This data is voluntarily reported by the facilities and companies. There were
no official air monitoring efforts by state or federal officials during and
after hurricane Harvey, and thus, no way to verify data submitted to TCEQ.
Greenpeace’s database does not include filings to the Texas Railroad
Commission, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Coast
Guard, or any other government agencies.
Data does not include estimates of chemicals released from Superfund sites,
Brownfields, sewage and water treatment facilities, or other potential point-
sources of air and water pollution reported after the storm.
