From indiscriminate clearance 
of Sumatra’s peat swamp 
forests to Asia Pulp & Paper’s 
expanding global empire.
Why CITES must act to prevent 
the pulp sector in Indonesia 
driving ramin and Sumatran 
tigers closer to extinction .A year-long investigation by Greenpeace 
International demonstrates that Asia Pulp 
& Paper (APP) is breaking Indonesian law, 
driving Sumatran tigers and ramin trees closer 
to extinction, and undermining CITES – the 
international conservation agreement governing 
trade in protected species.
The investigation, at APP’s largest pulp mill in 
Indonesia, Indah Kiat Perawang, exposes how 
illegal ramin logs are regularly mixed into its 
supply of logs from natural forest clearance (so-
called mixed tropical hardwood or MTH). This 
trade is banned under Indonesia’s ramin laws 
and its national CITES regulations. 
Video footage and forensic evidence obtained 
during this investigation is being made available 
to the appropriate domestic and international 
authorities – the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry 
and the CITES Secretariat in Geneva.

Investigation at APP’s Indah Kiat Perawang 
pulp mill reveals illegal ramin logs
Indonesia banned the logging and trade in ramin in 2001 in an 
effort to stop further loss of the species and degradation of its 
habitat.
A year-long video investigation inside the compound of Indah Kiat 
Perawang documents how illegal ramin logs are mixed in with 
the other mixed tropical hardwood logs waiting to be pulped and 
exported to other APP paper mills in Indonesia and China. Key 
findings: 
•	 The	logyards	within	the	mill	compound 	were	visited	on	
numerous occasions in nine separate months between February 
2011 and January 2012. Illegal ramin logs were identified and 
documented on each occasion.
•	 During 	the	visits,	numerous 	illegal	ramin	logs	could	be	identified,	
with up to 17 documented within a few paces of each other. This 
included large logs of up to 1 metre in diameter. 
•	 Of	the	logs	identified 	as	ramin,	representative 	samples	
were collected and sent to an independent laboratory 
for verification, where an expert specialising in the 
identification of internationally protected woods confirmed 
that 46 samples were ramin.
Ongoing APP expansion is increasing 
pressure on CITES-protected species
APP is heavily reliant on logs from clearance of Sumatran 
peat swamp forest, a key habitat for CITES-protected species 
including ramin and Sumatran tigers. 
•	 Sumatra’s 	peat	swamp	forests	are	important 	habitat	for	
the Sumatran tiger and ramin tree species , both CITES-
protected species. The logging and trade in ramin has been 
illegal in Indonesia since 2001. Internationally, the trade in 
Indonesian ramin is banned under the UN Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) – the same 
treaty that controls or bans international trade in many species 
including rhino horn and elephant ivory.
•	 Despite 	its	importance 	as	a	habitat	for	CITES-protected	
species, Indonesian government maps show that 
800,000ha (28%) of Sumatra’s peat swamp forest was 
cleared between 2003 and 2009. Some 22% of this 
clearance was in areas currently allocated to APP’s 
log suppliers. 
As part of APP’s bid to be the largest paper company in 
the world, it is in the process of expanding production 
considerably at Indonesia’s largest pulp mill. The expansion at 
Indah Kiat Perawang is increasing APP’s reliance on rainforest 
logs, including from the indiscriminate clearance of peat 
swamp forest.
•	 Indah	Kiat	Perawang 	is	increasing 	its	reliance	on	pulpwood	
from the clearance of Sumatra’s rainforest (so-called mixed 
tropical hardwoods).

	 •	 Indonesian 	government 	documents 	show	that	APP	
planned to double the volume of MTH use from 20% 
to 44% of the mill’s pulpwood supply between 2009 
and 2011 – meaning that for 2011, APP would need to 
clear an area of rainforest the size of Jakarta to produce 
5 million m3 of logs.
•	 A	2011	APP	report	states	that	Indah	Kiat	Perawang	
intends to increase pulp production further by increasing 
its licensed capacity by an additional 50%, from 2 to 3 
million tonnes per year. 
International trade is  
undermining CITES
APP’s dependence on rainforest logs including the 
indiscriminate clearance of ramin habitat is undermining 
CITES. APP paper products containing rainforest fibre from 
this clearance enter international trade and are traded to 
most CITES party countries.
•	 MTH	logs	from	the	clearance 	of	Sumatra’s 	peat	swamp	forest	
– a key ramin habitat – are central to pulp production at Indah 
Kiat Perawang. 
	 •	 A	2009	Ministry	of	Forestry	document 	reveals	that	the	
mill relies upon MTH log supplies from clearance within 
concessions located on peatland. 
	 •	 Indonesian 	government 	maps	show	that	in	concessions	
currently controlled by APP suppliers, a total of 180,000ha 
of peat swamp forest, an area more than twice the size 
of New York City, were cleared between 2003 and 2009 – 
some 40% of the original area (440,000 ha). 
•	Indah Kiat Perawang is a key supplier of MTH pulp to APP 
mills in Indonesia and China that export products to most 
CITES countries.
	 •	 Indah 	Kiat	Perawang 	trades	to	9	APP	companies 	in	
Indonesia and China; these 9 companies export ~3.1 
million tonnes of paper, tissue and packaging products to 
the global market – over 80% of total exports  from APP 
Indonesia and China.
	 •	 Fibre 	tests	of	consumer 	products 	linked	to	individual 	APP	
paper mills owned by those APP companies confirm the 
presence of MTH (that is, Indonesian rainforest fibre) in the 
supply chains of 8 out of these 9 APP companies.
	 	 •	 	136 CITES countries  (78% of all CITES parties) 
import paper products from APP mills in Indonesia 
and China with trade links to Indah Kiat Perawang. 
Key identified markets include North America (USA,

Pacific (China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand), South 
Africa and the Middle East (UAE, Israel).

Greenpeace calls for illegal ramin logs 
to be seized and peat swamp forest to 
be protected.
To protect ramin habitat from indiscriminate clearance and to 
avoid illegal ramin entering the supply chains of export-oriented 
paper companies, the following actions are critical: 
•	Sinar Mas/ APP: 
A Sinar Mas group-wide policy ending all deforestation, 
including clearance of peat swamp forest. Golden Agri-
Resources, the palm oil division of the group, is already 
implementing such a policy. 
•	 Ministry 	of	Forestry:	  
The seizure of illegal ramin in APP’s pulpwood supply and 
APP and its ‘exclusive’ supplier, Sinarmas Forestry, charged, 
prosecuted and punished in accordance with the law.
•	 Ministry 	of	Forestry:	  
A ban on all clearance of peat swamp forest, as 
recommended by a Ministry of Forestry report on ramin. 
•	 Corporate 	consumers:	  
Immediately cease trade with APP. Companies should 
implement policies to ensure zero deforestation in their 
supply chains.

APP is clearing rainforests critical to 
internationally protected species
Asia Pulp & Paper (APP), part of the Sinar Mas group, claims 
to be the world’s third largest paper company.1 It aspires to 
be number one,2 and is expanding rapidly.3 
APP’s pulp and paper operations in Indonesia service 
an export-oriented market. Its largest pulp mill in 
Indonesia, Indah Kiat Perawang, in Riau, Sumatra, 
is a primary source of pulp raw materials. APP 
says its sister company Sinarmas Forestry, whose 
principal operations are on the island of Sumatra, is its 
‘exclusive’ pulpwood supplier.4
APP claims it has ‘zero tolerance for illegal wood’,5 and 
that its policies ensure so-called ‘conservation beyond 
compliance’.6 Specifically, it claims its policies ensure the 
conservation of protected species – such as those listed 
by CITES – and any illegal wood will be ‘rejected before it 
enters the mill’.7
The United Nations Convention on the International 
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) is an international 
treaty drawn up in 1973. Its objective is to protect wildlife 
against overexploitation, through regulating international 
trade of threatened species.8 Through it, all international 
commercial trade in products including rhino horn, ivory, 
whale meat, tiger skins and ‘medicine’ is either heavily 
regulated or banned.9 
In 2001, Indonesia unilaterally placed its populations of 
ramin on the CITES10 list of protected species in order to 
help enforce a ban on the logging and trade in the species 
it imposed in the same year.11 Indonesia imposed the ramin 
ban in an effort to stop further loss of the species and 
degradation of its habitat.12Ramin is the common name given to ~30 tree species that 
all belong to the same genus (group of related species) 
Gonystylus.13 These are found principally Indonesia and 
Malaysia.14 Many of the ramin species are classified 
as ‘vulnerable’,15 meaning that due to habitat loss and 
overexploitation16 ramin ‘is facing a high risk of extinction in 
the wild in the medium-term future’.17
One	of	ramin’s	key	habitats	–	Sumatra’s 	peat	swamp	forest18 
– was heavily targeted by the timber industry.19
Although ramin trees have been legally protected since 2001 
under Indonesian laws and its national CITES regulations, 
government maps show that some 800,000ha (28%) of 
Sumatra’s peat swamp forest was cleared between 2003 
and 2009.20 Much of this peat swamp forest was important 
habitat for other CITES-protected species, including 
Sumatran tigers21– only 400 of which remain in the wild.22
Some 22% of this loss occurred in areas currently allocated 
to APP’s pulpwood suppliers.
The investigation at APP’s Indah Kiat 
Perawang pulp mill.
APP claims that the Indah Kiat Perawang mill has procedures 
‘to confirm that no illegal or controversial wood enters the 
mill’s pulpwood supply chain’,23 and that all inbound deliveries 
of logs from its suppliers are inspected to ensure that no ramin 
or other protected species enter the mill gate. 
A year-long video investigation inside the compound of 
Indah Kiat Perawang documents how illegal ramin logs are 
regularly mixed in with the other rainforest species (so-called 
MTH or mixed tropical hardwood species) waiting to be 
pulped and exported to other APP paper mills in Indonesia 
and China. Key findings:

•	 The	logyards 	within	the	mill	compound 	were	visited	on	
numerous occasions in nine separate months between 
February 2011 and January 2012. Illegal ramin logs were 
identified and documented on each occasion.
•	 During 	the	visits,	numerous 	illegal	ramin	logs	could	be	
identified, with up to 17 documented lying within a few 
paces of each other. This included large logs of up to 1 
metre in diameter. 
	 •	 Of	the	logs	identified 	as	ramin,	representative 	samples	
were collected and sent to an independent laboratory 
for verification, where an expert specialising in the 
identification of CITES-listed woods confirmed that 46 
samples were ramin.
The evidence demonstrates that APP policies and procedures 
are failing to prevent ramin logs illegally entering any part of its 
supply chain, be it within the concessions, in transport to mills, 
or at the mill gate or port. 
MTH fibre indicates ramin risk
Indonesian government maps show that in 2003, 440,000 ha 
of Sumatra’s peat swamp forest was held in areas currently 
controlled by APP suppliers; by 2009, there was just 260,000ha 
of peat swamp forest in this area, a loss of 180,000ha,24 an area 
more than twice the size of New York City.25
A 2009 Ministry of Forestry document26 naming the supply 
areas to Indah Kiat Perawang reveals that much of the 
MTH wood supply to the mill comes from concessions 
located on peatland. 
An important share of Indah Kiat Perawang’s MTH log supply 
continues to come from the clearance of peat swamp forest, a key ramin habitat. Therefore, the regular presence of illegal 
ramin logs mixed in with other rainforest species in the mill’s 
logyards is a strong indication that ramin habitat is being 
cleared indiscriminately by APP’s suppliers to supply Indah 
Kiat Perawang. 
Consequently, the presence of MTH fibres in an end product 
linked to pulp produced by Indah Kiat Perawang indicates 
that the product may include fibre from the indiscriminate 
clearance of ramin habitat; supply from this clearance has 
been documented to include illegal ramin.
Expansion of APP’s Indah Kiat  
Perawang pulp mill increases  
pressure on Sumatra’s rainforests.
Indah Kiat Perawang produced ~2 million tonnes of pulp in 
2009.27 According to Ministry of Forestry data for 2010 and 
2011, the mill produced ~2.3 million tonnes of pulp in 2010,28 
and had pulpwood supplies predicted to be sufficient 
to produce over 2.3 million tonnes of pulp in 2011.29 This 
indicates that the mill is expanding pulp production.
Indonesian government documents show that Indah Kiat 
Perawang planned to double its use of MTH logs from 
rainforest clearance from 2.4 million m3 in 200930 to 5 million 
m3 in 2011.31 This volume equates to some 44% of the mill’s 
total planned pulpwood supply for 2011. 5 million m3 of MTH 
logs amounts to ~64,000 ha of rainforest clearance in 2011 
alone32 – that is the area of Jakarta.33 
A 2011 APP report states that Indah Kiat Perawang intends 
to increase pulp production further by increasing its 
licensed capacity by an additional 50%, from 2 to 3 million 
tonnes per year.34 This will increase pressure on Sumatra’s 
peat swamp forests.

From APP’s Indah Kiat Perawang  
pulp mill to other APP paper mills  
in Indonesia and China
MTH fibre produced by Indah Kiat Perawang penetrates the 
international market either directly from the Perawang complex or 
indirectly, through other APP paper mills in Indonesia and China. 
•	 Using 	company 	documents, 	trade	and	shipping	data,	the	
investigation identified 12 individual APP paper mills run by 
9 APP companies in Indonesia and China with trade links to 
Indah Kiat Perawang.35
•	 Through 	fibre	testing	of	products 	or	brands	associated 	with	
individual APP companies, the investigation established the 
use of MTH pulp or fibre in the supply chains of 8 of these 9 
companies.36
•	 2010	trade	data	show	that	over 80% of total direct exports by 
APP Indonesia or China (~3.1 million tonnes) are paper, tissue 
or packaging products from these 12 APP paper mills.37From APP paper mills linked to the Indah 
Kiat Perawang pulp mill to CITES party 
countries and consumer products.
Some 136 CITES party countries (the vast majority of signatories 
to the treaty) import products from the 12 APP paper mills linked 
to Indah Kiat Perawang. 38  
The investigation has identified specific products linked to these 
APP paper mills and containing MTH fibre. These products, 
ranging from copy paper to tissue, books and packaging, 
were bought in 8 countries and relate to 12 separate corporate 
consumers and traders. They include Acer (computer packaging), 
Barnes	&	Noble	(books),	Danone	(formula	milk	packaging), 	Mondi	
(printing and packaging materials), National Geographic (books), 
Parragon 	Publishing 	(books),	Walmart	China	(APP-brand 	copy	
paper),	and	Xerox	(copy	paper).
APP undermines CITES by pulping peat 
swamp forest. 
APP’s international trade in paper products is driving at least 
two CITES-protected species (Sumatran tigers and ramin) 
closer to extinction through the indiscriminate clearance of their 
Sumatran peat swamp forest habitat. This rainforest clearance, 
to feed its global paper empire, is clearly undermining the 
conservation objectives of CITES.


11
The Sinar Mas group 
should ban the clearance 
of peat swamp forest.
Banning	the	clearance 	of	peat	swamp	
forest is a key recommendation in an 
Indonesian Ministry of Forestry report 
on ramin conservation: ‘The practice 
of peat forest conversion into forest 
plantation should be prohibited.’39
Such a policy would significantly reduce 
the risk of any ramin entering any part of 
APP’s supply chain. 
APP’s sister company within the 
Sinar Mas group, palm oil producer 
Golden Agri-Resources, is already 
implementing a policy ending all peat 
swamp forest clearance.40 
•	The Sinar Mas group as a whole, 
including APP and its ‘exclusive’ 
supplier Sinarmas Forestry, should 
implement a policy ending all 
deforestation, including a ban on the 
clearance of any peat swamp forest.
Call for international 
action: ‘Let’s save  
ramin, let’s save peat 
swamp forests’
This investigation demonstrates that 
APP’s international trade is adversely 
affecting ramin species and their 
habitat in contravention of Indonesia’s 
CITES regulations and its ramin ban. 
Evidence including video footage 
from within the Indah Kiat Perawang 
compound as well as independent test 
results is being made available to the two 
key authorities responsible for ensuring 
Indonesia’s effective compliance with 
the Convention on the International Trade 
in Endangered Species: Indonesia’s 
Ministry of Forestry and the CITES 
Secretariat in Geneva. 
Given evidence that the provisions of 
the Convention are not being effectively implemented by Indonesia, such as 
that presented by this investigation, 
the CITES Secretariat can request 
that Indonesia’s CITES Management 
Authority – the Ministry of Forestry – 
propose ‘remedial action’ to address 
the problem.  41
Key demands of  
Indonesia’s CITES 
Management Authority
A key role of Indonesia’s CITES 
Management Authority, the Ministry of 
Forestry, is to enforce Indonesia’s ramin 
logging and trade ban and to ensure that 
no ramin enters international trade in 
violation of CITES regulations. 
Enforcement of these regulations by the 
Ministry of Forestry must include these 
measures in relation to APP:
•	 Seizure 	of	all	illegal	ramin	in	APP’s	
supply chain – this includes at the 
Indah Kiat Perawang complex, at any 
of its suppliers’ related forest clearance 
operations and logyards, in transport to 
the mill on trucks or barges.
•	 Ensuring 	APP	and	its	‘exclusive’ 	supplier,	
Sinarmas Forestry, are prosecuted and 
punished in accordance with the law.
Key demands of corporate  
consumers of APP products
Any company trading with APP is 
providing financial support to a company 
that is breaking Indonesian law, driving 
Sumatran tigers and ramin trees closer to 
extinction, and undermining CITES – the 
international conservation agreement 
governing trade in protected species.
Given the risks associated with APP, a 
number of companies are removing APP 
products from their supply chains.
•	Companies should immediately 
cease trade with APP and implement 
policies to ensure zero deforestation 
in their supply chains. Demands

Diaries and other stationery products 
represented nearly 70% of group sales,56 
largely through Nippecraft subsidiaries Collins 
Debden Pty Ltd (Australia) and Collins Debden 
Ltd (UK), whose primary business is the 
distribution of office stationery products such 
as notepads and account books.57 
Nippecraft’s various disclosures to 
shareholders and other financial documents 
reveal:
Nippecraft and its subsidiary Collins Debden 
are part of the APP Group and Nippecraft 
buys ‘finished products including stationery 
products’ from APP group mills.58 
Between 2009 and June 2011, over 70% of 
Nippecraft purchases from within the APP 
group59 were from PT Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi 
Kimia, including TK Import & Export Ltd.60 In 
2010, the value of this direct trade with Tjiwi 
Kimia represented $18 million.61 
Unlike Pindo Deli and Indah Kiat, Tjiwi Kimia 
includes a printing house, TK Printing, and 
thus is able to supply finished products 
including stationery products. Collins Debden

10   In May 2001, a month after imposing a ban on 
logging and trade in ramin, Indonesia notified 
CITES that Indonesia’s ramin populations should be 
listed in Appendix III. 
In 2004, given ongoing loss of ramin habitat and illegal 
logging of ramin, the Ministry of Forestry requested 
CITES party countries to grant all ramin species the 
higher Appendix II listing, requiring far greater trade 
controls, in a bid to achieve improved enforcement of the 
export ban through increased international scrutiny of 
potential trade violations under CITES. Source: MoFor 
(2008)
Virtually all trade in products derived from Indonesian 
ramin are illegal. The Appendix II CITES listing covers 
any specimen that may contain Indonesian ramin, its 
parts or derivatives with a few, very limited exceptions 
like seeds, seedlings and tissue cultures. Source: 
Annotation #4 CITES (2011a): 45
Pulp or paper products are not specifically exempted 
from (thus are covered by) the provisions of the 
listing. Source: ‘[CITES] AGREES that the term 
‘readily recognizable part or derivative’, as used in the 
Convention, shall be interpreted to include any specimen 
which appears from an accompanying document, 
the packaging or a mark or label, or from any other 
circumstances, to be a part or derivative of an animal 
or plant of a species included in the Appendices, unless 
such part or derivative is specifically exempted from the 
provisions of the Convention’ [emphasis added]. Source: 
Conf. 9.6 (rev) ‘Trade in readily recognizable parts and

In practice, there is only one legal source of ramin – 
the FSC-certified PT Diamond Raya selective logging 
operation and its associated processing companies. 
Source: CITES (2009)
11   MoFor (2001a)  
According to MoFor/ITTO (2008b): ‘Ministry of 
Forestry Decree No 127/Kpts-V/2001 regarding 
the moratorium on the logging and trade in ramin: 
No logging activity of ramin is allowed in production 
forest, conversion forest and community forest and 
no trading activity is allowed both domestic and 
international.’
The decree was updated in July 2001 with decree 
168/2001, which provided limited exemption from 
the ban for selective logging operations that had been 
independently certified legal and sustainable. Only one 
operation has ever been subject to this exemption.
The decree was further updated in October 2001 with 
decree 1613/2001. This decree is not readily available 
in the public domain or via requests to the Ministry 
of Forestry. No subsequent advice was forwarded to 
the CITES Secretariat. However, it is reported that 
the decree limits exports of ramin to timber from 
the Diamond Raya concession that has been worked 
into dowels, mouldings and other semi-finished wood 
products.
