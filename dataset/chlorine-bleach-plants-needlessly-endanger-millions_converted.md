Executive Summary

Eighty-six bleach plants (Appendix A) across the country put 63.8 million
people in danger of a potential worst-case release of chlorine gas, a substance
so toxic it has been used as a chemical weapon. Bleach manufacturers use
chlorine gas to produce bleach and also repackage bulk chlorine gas into
smaller containers for commercial use.

These facilities often ship, receive and store their chlorine gas in 90-ton railcars
that are typically left unattended en route or on site, making them vulnerable to
accidents and acts of sabotage. These railcars crisscross the country delivering
chlorine gas to facilities, endangering the communities through which they
travel.

Fortunately, bleach plants can operate without this hazard. An increasing
number of bleach facilities around the country now operate without bulk chlo-
rine gas storage and transportation, eliminating catastrophic hazards in densely
populated areas.

Summary of recommendations to reduce the storage, transport, and use of
chlorine gas:

1.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should include requirements for
bleach plants to identify and use inherently safer technology (IST) wherever
feasible in the agency’s upcoming Risk Management Program (RMP) chemical
plant safety rules due in early 2016.

2.  The EPA should collect and make public information on safer available alter-

natives in RMP reports.

3.  Bleach manufacturing facilities should prioritize a transition from chlorine gas

to liquid bleach and require sourcing from suppliers that produce chlorine from
an on-site, as-needed basis to eliminate storage and transport of bulk chlorine
gas. In addition, bleach facilities that transition from chlorine gas to liquid
bleach should make public the method of production of their bleach suppliers.

4.  Industrial chlorine consumers should adopt alternatives to gaseous chlorine.
For example, drinking water and wastewater treatment plants could generate
their chlorine bleach on-site or purchase from bleach plants that do not
transport or store bulk quantities of chlorine gas. Wastewater plants can also
switch to ultraviolet (UV) light for disinfection.

5.  Local governments and communities should demand that bleach plants and
other local facilities that pose catastrophic hazards convert to safer available
alternatives, such as ultraviolet (UV) light at municipal wastewater treatment
plants.

Part One: The Dangers of Chlorine Gas

Introduction to Bleach Plants and the Problems with Chlorine Gas

There are 86 large commercial bleach manufacturing facilities in the United States
that use bulk amounts of chlorine gas during their operations.1 These facilities
endanger 63,801,042 people2 living in “vulnerability zones” near the facilities with
the potential to release deadly amounts of chlorine gas in a worst-case scenario.3
The average vulnerability zone around these 86 bleach manufacturing facilities is a
16 mile radius, and the average population living in these zones is 972,467 people.
Those at greatest risk include facility employees and communities closest
to the facility. In the event of a catastrophic release of chlorine gas, first
responders can also become victims.

In addition to producing bleach,4 these plants often repackage chlorine gas into
smaller containers for commercial use. About 80% of the smaller containers of
chlorine gas shipped in the U.S. from bleach manufacturers, typically one-ton
and 150-pound cylinders, are used at drinking water or wastewater treatment
facilities.5

To produce their bleach and small containers of chlorine, conventional commercial
bleach manufacturers frequently ship, receive, and store chlorine gas in 90-ton
railcars. These railcars are indefensible from a security standpoint, as they may
often sit unattended on tracks outside of facilities and travel on rail lines through
communities around the country carrying highly toxic chlorine gas.

Railroads have made it clear that they do not want to carry Toxic Inhalation Hazard
(TIH) substances such as chlorine gas due to potentially ruinous liability.6 Despite
their protests, railroads are required to do so by common carrier obligations.7

Railroads are not alone in their objections to railcars of chlorine gas. After 9/11,
the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant in Washington, DC worked quickly
to remove its bulk storage of chlorine gas, recognizing the risk it posed to the
surrounding area. In a 2001 Washington Post article on the DC plant conversion,
the president of the plant’s union said, “you understand that if they had hit those
tankers, we’d be talking about more than 6,000 people killed in this area.”8

1   This figure is from Risk Management Plans that the 86 bleach plants submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
as of November 27, 2015.
2   This figure is non-overlapping. People who live within the vulnerability zone of more than one bleach plant are only counted
once.
3   EPA RMP requires facilities to calculate a “worst case scenario” for a catastrophic release involving “each toxic and
flammable substance held above the applicable threshold quantity” (“Chapter 4: Offsite Consequence Analysis.” Environmental
Protection Agency. http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-11/documents/chap-04-final.pdf)
4   Bleach supplied by commercial manufacturers is about 12% strength (Rob Baur). Bleach produced by Clorox for household
use is about 5% (Oregon State University Research Center). Bleach generated on-site by water and wastewater plants is about
1% (Environmental Protection Agency). Baur, Rob (senior operations analyst at Clean Water Services). “Operator Essentials: What

In 2003, Dr. Jay Boris of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory gave a presen-
tation to Washington, DC’s City Council during which he outlined a worst case
scenario that predicted up to 100,000 casualties should a chlorine gas tank car
be attacked and breached on the rail line that passes the Capitol Mall in Wash-
ington, D.C. during a major outdoor public event.9 The City Council responded
by banning the transport of toxic substances on rail lines through the city, but
the ban was later ruled unconstitutional and a violation of interstate commerce
clauses.10

A study conducted by Risk Management Solutions, Inc. estimated that
the full release of chlorine gas in a 90-ton railcar in worst case condi-
tions11 in a populous city like Chicago could result in 10,000 deaths and
over $7 billion in potential damages.12

The severe dangers of bulk chlorine storage have been known by the chemical
industry for years. In 1998, the Chlorine Institute, a trade association, released
the third edition of a pamphlet on chlorine gas release scenarios. The pamphlet
estimated that the worst-case scenario for a 90-ton railcar of chlorine gas
would result in dangerous levels of chlorine traveling a maximum downwind
distance of more than 40 miles. The pamphlet also includes scenarios for other
emergency release hazards posed by chlorine gas including valve, tubing, and
pipe failures.13

Oversight of bleach manufacturers is divided among various executive agencies,
including the Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, and Department of Homeland Security. President Obama
issued Executive Order 13650 “Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security”
on August 1, 2013 directing these agencies to improve safety standards at
chemical facilities including bleach plants. The EPA is the agency with the most
authority to issue new rules, but it has failed to issue promised safety rules in
the more than two years since the executive order. The EPA has already missed
two scheduled times to issue new Risk Management Program (RMP) chemical
plant safety rules. In the fall of 2014, the agency posted September 2015 with
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Later in 2015, it posted
November 2015 on the OIRA site. In late November 2015, agency sources
estimated that the rule would be released in March 2016.14

There is no necessity for the extreme hazard of 90-ton railcars full of chlorine
gas traveling across the country and sitting unattended on rail sidings. Bleach
manufacturers can produce chlorine on-site on an as-needed basis to
remove dangerous bulk storage.

And many chlorine consumers, such as water treatment facilities, do not need
to use chlorine gas in their processes at all. Safer alternatives for chlorine
gas in water treatment processes include liquid bleach and ultraviolet
light. Roughly two-thirds of wastewater plants use an alternative to chlorine
gas15 and at least 160 large drinking water plants use liquid bleach.16

Part Two: Removing the Threat of a Chlorine Gas Release

Alternatives to Chlorine Gas

Chlorine gas can be removed from industrial processes in multiple ways. Bleach
manufacturers that ship and receive bulk chlorine gas by railcar can remove this
hazard by producing chlorine on-site using salt and electricity on an as-needed
basis. By generating chlorine “just-in-time,” bleach plants remove the bulk
storage of railcars of chlorine gas at their facilities, while also taking these
hazardous railcars off the rail lines.19

The drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities that purchase one-ton
and 150 pound containers of chlorine gas can remove chlorine gas storage
from their processes entirely. Ultraviolet light20and liquid bleach are safer alter-
natives to chlorine gas. As water industry consumers phase out bulk gaseous
chlorine, distributors and technology suppliers should be motivated to provide
safer alternatives.

Facilities that have either eliminated bulk chlorine gas storage or have always
produced their bleach without accumulating large amounts of chlorine gas
include Allied New Technologies in Fort Pierce, FL; BleachTech in Seville, OH
and Petersburg, VA; Buckman’s in Pottstown, PA; Colorado Salt Products
in Denver, CO; FSTI in Greenville, TX; Odyssey Manufacturing in Tampa, FL;
and Tibro Water Technologies in Sherrill, NY. Appendix B contains a full list of
salt-to-bleach producers.

In addition, between 2009-2012, Clorox phased out the storage and use of
90-ton railcars of chlorine gas from seven of its U.S. facilities. This eliminated
the dangers posed by a catastrophic release of chlorine gas to 13.6 million
people living in the seven vulnerability zones around Clorox facilities in Houston,
TX; Chicago, IL; Forest Park, GA; City of Vernon, CA; Aberdeen, MD; and
Fairfield, CA. In addition, it eliminated the same hazard to the people living near
the railroad tracks on which chlorine tank cars destined for Clorox facilities
previously traveled.21 While bulk chlorine gas is never necessary for bleach
production, it is not yet known whether Clorox uses sources that employ the
safer salt-to-bleach process as they have refused to confirm this for any of their
suppliers of high strength bleach.

Some industrial facilities generate salt as a waste product and convert this
waste into marketable products using the same salt-to-bleach technologies
mentioned above. MIOX in Albuquerque, NM converts its waste salt “into a
usable oxidant.”22 Molycorp in Mountain Pass, CA recovers “reagents and water
with a salt conversion facility”23 and also produces SorbX-100, a salt solution
that it supplies to wastewater facilities to reduce chemical use in phosphorus
removal operations.24

chlorine to maintain disinfection in the distribution system.

A K2 Pure Solutions facility built a direct pipeline to a Dow plant in Pittsburg,
CA to provide the chemical company with chlorine on an as-needed basis.25
Though it still stores chlorine gas on site, Dow has eliminated a long rail
shipment supply line for chlorine gas by implementing just-in-time production.
This improvement in transport safety is in line with Dow’s 2007 commitment to
reduce the shipment of highly hazardous materials by 50 percent by 2015.26

Though these individual bleach facility conversions demonstrate the feasibility
of producing bleach without bulk chlorine gas storage, they are limited by
their voluntary nature. Additional facilities could also be built and sited in major
population centers. New rules are needed that require facilities to implement
these safer processes wherever feasible.

Recommendations

1.  The EPA should include requirements for bleach facilities to assess inher-
ently safer technologies (IST) and implement IST wherever feasible in the
agency’s new Risk Management Program (RMP) rules on chemical facility
safety due in March. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board has outlined four
main opportunities for IST: replace hazardous materials with less hazardous
alternatives; reduce the amount of hazardous materials; use less hazardous
conditions in processes such as lower pressures or temperatures, and
design simpler processes less prone to failure.27 The Coalition to Prevent
Chemical Disasters (CPCD) also submitted comments to the EPA urging
that IST requirements be included in the new RMP rules that were called
for by President Obama’s August 1, 2013 Executive Order #13650. As a
Senator the President advocated IST requirements, and his administration
has put forward “core principles” on IST in Congress. The EPA has abun-
dant legal authority under the Clean Air Act to require IST and CPCD also
outlined how the EPA can and should use that authority in a still pending
2012 Administrative Procedure Act petition.

2.  The EPA should collect and make public information on safer available

alternatives in RMP reports.

3.  Bleach manufacturers should eliminate bulk chlorine gas storage and

transport by generating chlorine on-site on an as-needed basis. Companies
such as Clorox that have switched to high strength liquid bleach should also
disclose the source of their bleach and the chlorine production method used
to make it.

4.  Industrial chlorine consumers such as drinking water treatment facilities
can remove their reliance on bulk chlorine gas by generating their own
liquid bleach on-site or by purchasing from salt-to-bleach producers
where available. Wastewater treatment plants can use ultraviolet light, and
over 140 plants have converted to UV disinfection since 1999.28 The UV
manufacturing industry cites thousands of wastewater treatment plants that

use UV treatment.29 Reduced demand results in less production, and the
bulk storage and transport of chlorine gas can be minimized or eliminated if
fewer facilities demand the product.

5.  Local governments and communities should de-
mand that bleach plants and other local facilities
such as drinking water and wastewater facilities,
that pose catastrophic hazards, convert to safer
available alternatives. Wastewater plants can also
switch to ultraviolet (UV) light for disinfection.
