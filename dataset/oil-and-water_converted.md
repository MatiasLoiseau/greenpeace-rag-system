Summary Results

|| From 2002 to the end of 2017, ETP, Sunoco and their

|| The largest spills in the PHMSA database were crude

subsidiaries and joint ventures reported 527 hazardous
liquids pipeline incidents to federal regulators —
approximately one incident from existing facilities every
eleven days .

|| Those incidents, reported by the Pipeline Hazardous

Material Safety Administration (PHMSA), released a total
of 87,273 barrels (3 .6 million gallons, or about five-and-a-
half Olympic-sized swimming pools) of hazardous liquids,
including 66,515 barrels (2 .8 million gallons) of crude oil .

|| In addition, state regulatory agencies have documented
spills totaling at least 2 .4 million gallons of drilling fluids,
sediment and industrial waste during the construction of
just two ETP pipelines in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
West Virginia .

|| Crude oil spills made up 408 of the PHMSA incidents, along
with 92 refined petroleum product spills and 27 highly-
volatile liquid (HVL), flammable or toxic spills .

|| Of the hazardous liquid spills from existing facilities 101

incidents were of 50 barrels or more (2100 gallons, a volume
which is considered “significant” by the federal regulator) .

|| 67 of the hazardous liquid incidents were reported to have
contaminated water, of which 18 incidents contaminated
groundwater.

|| These spills caused an estimated $115 million in property
damage, and led to 106 Notices of Probable Violations,
and $5,675,870 in penalties from PHMSA alone .

oil spills of 436,000, 361,000, 290,000, 189,000, 153,000,
143,000, 139,000, and 105,000 gallons, and 2 HVL spills of
168,000 and 121,000 gallons .

|| In addition, state agencies and the Federal Energy Regulatory

Commission (FERC) have issued over 100 notices of
violation and/or non-compliance for the construction of
the Rover and Mariner pipelines . In 2017–18 alone, ETP and
Sunoco were issued six stop work orders by state agencies
and FERC because their construction operations violated
permit requirements and/or rules and regulations designed
to protect streams, rivers, wetlands, drinking water, historic
sites and public safety .

|| The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and its southern
component only began operations in 2017, but have
already reported 7 incidents .

|| Assuming the U .S . system-wide rate for significant crude
oil spills of 0 .001 per year per mile, we estimate that the
Bakken Pipeline would suffer 96 significant spills and the
Bayou Bridge Pipeline would suffer eight significant spills,
during a 50-year nominal lifetime .

|| There is no failsafe way to transport fossil fuels and

pipeline spills remain a direct and seemingly unavoidable
consequence of oil and gas activity .

|| Rapid transition to renewable energy could dramatically
reduce spills from pipelines and pollution of drinking
water sources .

Energy Transfer Partners and
Sunoco Have a History of Spills
from Existing Pipelines

Energy Transfer Partners and its complex network of
subsidiaries and joint ventures owns one of the nation’s largest
networks of natural gas, crude oil and petroleum products
pipelines . Data collected from the U .S . Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) shows that the ETP
family of hazardous liquids pipelines experienced 527 incidents
from 2002 to the end of 2017, spilling ~87,000 barrels, and
causing an estimated $115 million in property damage .

We have mapped these incidents, spread across numerous
states and regions in the U .S . where ETP operates .1

View online at: https://greenpeace.carto.com/maps

Company History and Structure

Energy Transfer Partners, L .P . (ETP) was founded in 1995 by
Ray Davis and Kelcy Warren (who is still its current Chairman
and CEO) and became a publicly traded partnership in 2004 .
ETP is in turn controlled by a master limited partnership
called Energy Transfer Equity (ETE), of which Warren is also
the Chairman .2

The company’s national profile was fairly small until the
massive grassroots resistance to its Dakota Access Pipeline
(DAPL) led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe was splashed
across the headlines in 2016 . That same year, Warren donated
$100,000 to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign3 and
later cut a check for $250,000 for Trump’s inauguration .4
Trump made the approval of DAPL’s final permits one of his
administration’s first priorities upon becoming U .S . President .5

ETP’s corporate structure is famously complicated .6 In
October 2012, ETP merged with Sunoco, Inc .,7 a fuel refining,
distribution and retail company that had been founded
in 1886 .8 Prior to the merger, ETP and ETE were primarily
focused on the natural gas sector, and the merger with
Sunoco allowed them to diversify into “liquids” pipelines
due to Sunoco’s significant crude oil and refined petroleum
product assets .9 Part of this business operated as Sunoco
Logistics Partners (SXL) until it fully merged with ETP in April
2017 .10 Sunoco LP (SUN) continues to exist as a downstream
distributor of motor fuel .

Currently three of these entities — ETP, ETE and SUN —
are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange . The
company also boasts a number of subsidiaries and joint
ventures as part of its “family” which we have attempted to
reflect in this report . Including both liquids and natural gas,
ETP operates more than 71,000 miles of pipelines in the U .S .
— nearly long enough to encircle the earth three times .11

Leaky Pipes

The PHMSA database of all U .S . hazardous liquids pipeline
incidents from 2002 to present contains 6,102 reported
incidents .12 Of those incidents, 527 were associated with ETP,
Sunoco, or one of their subsidiaries or joint ventures13  — a
rate of one incident occurring approximately every eleven
days . These 527 incidents released a total of 87,273 barrels
of hazardous liquids, of which 66,515 barrels were crude oil,
and led to over $115 million in property damages according
to PHMSA’s records . Of the total volume spilled, 36,862 barrels
(42%) were never recovered by the company . Since 2002,
spills from ETP, Sunoco and subsidiaries led to proposed
penalties of $5,675,870 .14

Other reports have noted the company’s poor safety
reputation,15, 16 and have analyzed PHMSA data to conclude
that ETP and Sunoco’s pipeline network is among the leakiest
in the nation .17, 18 In addition, Sunoco’s Pennsylvania refineries
were subject to a comprehensive Clean Air Act settlement,
that included a $3 million civil penalty and $285 million to
install emissions controls .19

Figure 1 shows a timeline of the 527 liquids spills, broken
down by corporate entity . As can be seen from the figure,
several entities in the ETP family have reported significant
numbers of hazardous liquids pipeline spills, both before
and after the 2012 merger . Sunoco Pipelines LP has reported
337 incidents since 2002 . Also included are spills from joint
ventures that Sunoco brought into the merger, notably the
Mid-Valley Pipeline (76 incidents), the West Texas Gulf Pipeline
(46 incidents), and the Wolverine Pipeline (11 incidents) . We
include all incidents from Sunoco and its subsidiaries and joint
ventures in this analysis, both before and after 2012, because
Sunoco brought most of the hazardous liquids assets into the
merger and remains part of ETP’s current pipeline network .

Figure 1: Number of pipeline incidents, by year and corporate entity .

Energy Transfer has reported 23 hazardous liquids incidents,
all occurring after the 2012 merger . The Dakota Access
Pipeline (DAPL) and its southern component (ETCO) only
began operations in 2017, but have already reported 7
incidents . For full details on the incident analysis, including
more information on the subsidiaries and joint ventures that
were included, see Appendix A: Research Methods .

The ten largest incidents in this analysis are the following
(in chronological order):

|| In June 2009, a portion of the West Texas Gulf Pipeline near
Colorado City, Texas caught fire and spilled 3,416 barrels
(143,000 gallons) of crude oil . PHMSA later fined Sunoco
Pipeline LP $415,000 .24

|| In August 2009, Sunoco Pipelines spilled 2,500 barrels
(105,000 gallons) of crude from a station near Mont
Belvieu, Texas . The U .S . EPA eventually reached a $850,000
settlement for Clean Water Act violations related to this
spill and a later 2011 spill of 1,742 barrels (73,000 gallons)
in Cromwell, Oklahoma .25

|| In October 2014, the Mid-Valley Pipeline experienced yet
another major incident, spilling 4,509 barrels (189,000
gallons) and contaminating a ten-mile section of Tete
Bayou near Mooringsport, Louisiana .26

|| In June 2015, a “gasket failure” on the West Texas Gulf
Pipeline near Wortham, Texas led to a release of 3,300
barrels (139,000 gallons) of crude that was contained in
two retention ponds on company property .

|| In August and September 2016, Sunoco’s Permian II

Express pipeline leaked 8,600 barrels (361,000 gallons)
near Sweetwater, Texas . The incident led to a Corrective
Action Order, and followed a fine from federal regulators
for welding violations on the same project .27

|| In addition to crude oil spills, ETP pipelines suffered large
spills of highly-volatile liquids (HVL)28 of 2,880 barrels
(121,000 gallons) in 2012 near Midland, Texas and 3,992
barrels (168,000 gallons) in 2014 near Ira, Texas .

leading to an oil slick 17 miles long and harming hundreds
of migratory birds . The federal government later reached a
$2 .57 million settlement with Sunoco .21

|| In November 2005, operator error led to a 10,380 barrel

(436,000 gallon) crude oil overflow at Sunoco Pipeline LP’s
Darby Creek Tank Farm in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania . The
spilled oil was contained by a dike, and PHMSA later fined
Sunoco $150,000 .22

|| In October 2008, the Mid-Valley Pipeline spilled again, this
time releasing 3,650 barrels (153,000 gallons) into “the
sanitary sewer system and nearby Gunpowder Creek” in
Florence, Kentucky .23

Although it is not the main focus on this report, PHMSA also
maintains data regarding ruptures and leaks from natural gas
gathering, transmission and distribution pipelines . ETP and
its subsidiaries reported 58 natural gas incidents to PHMSA
from 2002 to present . Natural gas pipeline leaks present a
different range of risks from hazardous liquids leaks, including
the risk of an explosion . Methane leaking from the U .S .’s
rapidly growing natural gas infrastructure is also a significant
climate change risk .30

Dakota Access Pipeline
& Bakken Project

The Bakken Pipeline consists of the 1,172 mile, 30-inch
diameter Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which runs from the
Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to a hub in Patoka, Illinois,
and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline (ETCO), which runs
743 miles south from Patoka to Nederland, Texas .31 The DAPL
segment was built across Sioux lands designated under the
1851 Fort Laramie Treaty and crosses the Missouri River near
Lake Oahe, just north of the Standing Rock Reservation .32

The project is a joint venture between ETP, MarEn Bakken
Company LLC (Enbridge) and Phillips 66, with ETP holding
a 38 .25% interest .

Violations of Indigenous sovereignty, lack of adequate
consultation and threats to water supplies from pipeline
spills led Indigenous Water Protectors and their allies to
set-up pipeline opposition camps near the river crossing .
The organized pipeline opposition and the disproportional
response from authorities and private security forces
garnered international media attention, leading the Army
Corps of Engineers to deny the needed permits in December
2016 . However, the Trump Administration approved the
permits and DAPL went into operation in June 2017 .

Evidence suggests that environmental racism may have
played a part in selecting the pipeline route . The 2015
Environmental Assessment discussed an alternate route that
was rejected in part due to concerns about contamination of
“wellhead sourcewater protection areas” north of Bismarck,
North Dakota (a mostly white community) .33 Yet the approval
of the route passing near the reservation led the Standing
Rock Sioux Tribe to file a lawsuit alleging violations of the
National Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Water Act, and
the National Environmental Policy Act .34

In addition to the risk of pipeline spills into water, the EA
identified impacts from horizontal directional drilling (HDD)
used to tunnel the pipeline under rivers, including the risk of
“inadvertent release of drilling fluid directly or indirectly into
the waterbody” — a risk that has been realized during the
construction phases of other ETP/Sunoco projects .

Although the pipeline only became fully operational in 2017,
DAPL-ETCO has already reported 7 pipeline incidents to PHMSA,
of which 4 occurred along the DAPL portion, and the largest of
which was a significant 119 barrel (4,998 gallon) spill from the
ETCO segment near Dyersburg, Tennessee . A related eighth
incident occurred in March 2017 on a DAPL feeder line owned
by Caliber Midstream, but is not included in this analysis .35

Assuming the U .S . system-wide rate for significant crude oil
spills of 0 .001 per year per mile, we estimate that the Bakken
Pipeline would suffer 96 significant spills during a 50-year
nominal lifetime .

Federal Violations and Fines

PHMSA conducts annual inspections to determine whether
pipeline operators are in compliance with federal rules
designed to protect the public, drinking water sources and
ensure safe operation of pipelines and their associated
infrastructure . These routine inspections find violations
that could lead to a spill or a safety problem . When federal
inspectors find serious issues, they issue Notices of Proposed
Violations, Proposed Compliance Orders and/or Proposed
Civil Penalties . Since 2002, PHMSA has issued Energy
Transfer Partners and Sunoco 106 violations and fined them
$5,675,870 .36 Their safety violations include:

|| Failures to inspect crossings under waterways,

valves and pipeline rights of way .

|| Failures to notify PHMSA of a spill, fire, injuries

requiring hospitalization .

|| Failure to repair unsafe pipe for 5 years .

|| Failures to maintain pipeline integrity in high

consequence areas .

|| Failure to report unsafe conditions .

|| Failure to do corrosion inspection .

|| Repeated failures to properly notify emergency

responders and the public .37

Consequences of Pipeline Spills

Depending on their characteristics, oil spills can cause
significant acute and chronic impacts on ecosystems ranging
over “a range of time scales, from days to years, or even
decades for certain spills .”38 PHMSA collects information
on whether pipeline spills have contaminated soil or
water resources, impacted wildlife, or occurred in “high-
consequence areas” (HCAs) such as population centers or
navigable waterways (see Figure 3) .

OIL AN D WATER: E TP & S UNOCO’S H ISTORY OF PI PELI NE SP IL LS  |  6

Of the 527 incidents attributed to ETP, Sunoco, their
subsidiaries or joint ventures:

|| 67 incidents (12 .7%) were reported to have contaminated
water resources . Across the entire PHMSA database, 615
incidents (10 .0%) contaminated water resources .

|| Of those incidents, 18 incidents (3 .4%) were found to
contaminate groundwater . Nationally, there were 207
pipeline spills contaminating groundwater (3 .4%) .

|| And 3 incidents (0 .6%) were found to contaminate

drinking water resources specifically . Nationally, there
were 8 total incidents (0 .1%) contaminating drinking water .

|| 275 incidents (52 .5%) contaminated soils .

|| 189 incidents occurred in or reached “high consequence

areas .”

|| From 2010–present, there were 6 incidents that impacted
wildlife . One of these was a spill of 450 barrels in March
2014, from the Mid-Valley Pipeline, that contaminated the
Oak Glen Nature Preserve near Colerain, Ohio,39 closing
the preserve and leaving at least 36 animals in need of
treatment for contamination .40

|| From 2002 to 2009, there were 3 incidents that impacted

fish and 2 incidents that impacted birds .

Figure 3: Timeline of ETP spills impacting water, soil, wildlife or high-
consequence areas .

A 2010 editorial from a Philadelphia-area newspaper
lamented the consequences of Sunoco’s local safety record
and noted that repeated violations “will only be stopped
when the nation’s environmental protection laws finally grow
some teeth . In the meantime, Delaware County residents
must be satisfied with apologies and the prospect of ill health
or injury from another industrial disaster .”41

Energy Transfer Partners
and Sunoco Spills, Fines &
Stop Work Orders During
Construction

In addition to past spills from existing pipelines, ETP/Sunoco
pipeline projects currently under development have been
plagued with environmental violations . The construction of the
Mariner and Rover pipelines in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and West Virginia has resulted in over 2 .4 million gallons of
spills, over 100 notices of violations and other non-compliance
issues, and 6 stop work orders . These new pipelines have
faced growing resistance from local communities and decision
makers concerned about the long history of non-compliance
and pollution of drinking water sources, trout streams,
wetlands and rivers .

Rover

ETP’s Rover Pipeline is a 713-mile natural gas pipeline designed
to transport 3 .25 billion cubic feet of gas per day from the Utica
and Marcellus shale production areas in West Virginia, eastern
Ohio, and western Pennsylvania westward through Ohio and
into Michigan .42 In an ominous foreshadowing, ETP started
getting into trouble before construction even started . Despite
promising to “avoid adverse effects,” ETP destroyed the historic
170-year old Stoneman House in Dennison, Ohio that was
eligible for listing in the National List of Historic places . The

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission used the demolition
of the historically significant site as a basis for denying Rover a
blanket construction permit, saying “Rover could not be relied
upon to comply with the environmental regulations .”43

With that restriction, FERC approved the project in February
2017, and Energy Transfer began an aggressive effort to
construct the pipeline as quickly as possible . In its haste, ETP
repeatedly contaminated waterways across Michigan, Ohio and
West Virginia . One August 2017 analysis concluded that Rover
had “racked up more environmental violations than other major
interstate natural gas pipelines built in the last two years” – a
total of 104 non-compliance incidents while the second highest
company only had 26 non-compliance incidents . 44

By March 2018, after only 13 months of construction, Rover had
spilled more than 2 .2 million gallons of drilling fluids, industrial
waste and/or sediment, amassing more than 100 violations/
non-compliance incidents and 4 stop work orders for their
failure to comply with environmental regulations designed
to protect streams, rivers wetlands, drinking water, historic
sites and public safety (see pages 9–10 for a selection of these
violations, citations for these incidents are listed in Appendix C) .

Mariner

The Mariner East Project is designed to transport natural gas
liquids from the same Utica and Marcellus shale production
areas, this time eastward across Pennsylvania, including
to the Marcus Hook terminal on the Delaware River .45 The
first phase of the Mariner project began operations in 2014,
while Mariner East 2 is scheduled to be completed in 2018 .
Construction of the pipeline has led to 108 “inadvertent”
releases in numerous locations along the route, leading the
Pennsylvania DEP to issue more than 40 violations,46 and
several reports of private water wells being impacted by
construction activities .47 Those spills have released a total of
at least 200,000 gallons of drilling fluids and other liquids .48
The Mariner 1 and Mariner 2 pipelines have been shut
down twice as a result of spills, violations, sink holes and
contamination of drinking water and trout streams .

The Pennsylvania DEP Administrative Order shutting down
construction on January 3, 2018 itemized unpermitted and
unlawful activities impacting the following trout streams
classified as Class A wild trout waters, wild trout (natural
reproduction) water, high quality trout stocking and designated
as exceptional value waters and/or migratory fishes:

1 .  Hay Creek in Berks County

2 .  Cacoosing Creek in Berks County

3 .  Allegheny Creek in Berks County

4 .  Clover Creek in Blair County

5 .  Mingo Creek in Washington County

6 .  Shaeffer Creek in Dauphin County

The 24-page order also required Sunoco to address the
private water wells contaminated in Silver Lake Township
“to the satisfaction of the private well owners .” The order
concluded by saying:

“ Sunoco’s unlawful conduct… demonstrates
a lack of ability or intention on the part of
Sunoco to comply with the Clean Streams
Law, the Dam Safety and Encroachments
Act, and the permits issued thereunder .
Suspension of the permits… is necessary to
correct the egregious and willful violations
described herein .”49

On February 8, 2018 the Pennsylvania DEP and Sunoco
executed a Consent Order and Agreement requiring the
payment of a $12 .6 million penalty and that Sunoco provide
detailed plans to prevent future violations .50 It was one of
the largest fines ever levied by the State of Pennsylvania for
violations of environmental laws .

Less than 30 days later, Mariner was shut down again in
Pennsylvania due to problems during construction . On March 7,
2018, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) issued
an emergency order shutting down the Mariner 1 pipeline
during construction of the adjacent Mariner 2 pipeline .51 The
emergency order said that allowing the continued transport of
hazardous liquids through the Mariner 1 pipeline “could have
catastrophic results impacting the public .”52 The PUC estimated
the pipeline would be shut down 10-14 days, possibly longer
if ETP/Sunoco failed to address serious safety concerns that
the pipeline could be “hazardous to life, property and the
environment .”53 Among the safety issues that triggered the
rare emergency shut down were the formation of three large
sinkholes in a densely populated area defined by PHMSA as a
“high consequence area” . One sinkhole was located 300 feet
from rail lines carrying Amtrak and Septa passengers . Another
sink hole was created 10 feet from the foundation of a house .

U.S. Pipeline Spill Trends

Over the past decade, hazardous liquid pipeline spills in the
U .S . have led to 16 fatalities, 30 injuries, $2 .7 billion in costs,
and over 825,000 total barrels spilled (34 .7 million gallons, or
around 9,500 gallons every day) .58 Common causes of pipeline
spills include equipment failures, corrosion, operator error,
material or welding failures, and excavation damage .59

Significant pipeline spills in recent years include Enbridge’s
2010 spill into the Kalamazoo River,60 Exxon’s 2013 Pegasus
pipeline spill in Mayflower, Arkansas, two spills into the
Yellowstone River in 2011 and 2015,61 and the 2015 pipeline
rupture that closed a Santa Barbara beach .

These pipeline spills are in addition to spills from oil wells,
disposal sites, and other oil and gas infrastructure, both
onshore and offshore .62 Of total spills from all sources in 2015,
a recent analysis found that 640 spills affected groundwater
or surface water in some way .63

From 2007 to 2016, U .S . crude oil pipelines have averaged
0 .001 significant incidents and 0 .57 barrels spilled per year per
mile of pipeline . Refined petroleum product pipelines have
averaged 0 .0007 significant incidents and 0 .24 barrels spilled
per year per mile, and HVL pipelines have averaged 0 .0005
significant incidents and 0 .53 barrels spilled per year per mile .

Over the past several years, spills of crude oil and liquid
petroleum products from pipelines have increased, reversing
earlier improvements .54 This trend reached its maximum in
2015 with a total of 454 reported incidents, of which 176 were
classified as significant by PHMSA . These numbers dropped
slightly in 2017 to 404 reported incidents (153 significant)
but remained at an elevated level compared to earlier years
(see Figure 4) .

Similarly, a recent review by oil industry trade organizations
found that pipeline incidents “impacting the public or
environment” (IPE) have increased in the past 4 years .55

Figure 4: Ten year trends for significant U .S . pipeline incidents involving
crude oil, refined petroleum products, and highly-volatile liquids (HVL) .
Data: PHMSA

The key takeaway from these statistics is that despite industry
rhetoric to the contrary, there is no failsafe way to transport
fossil fuels . Industry safety initiatives and an overmatched
regulatory agency have been unable to eliminate the risk
of spills, which remain a direct and seemingly unavoidable
consequence of oil and gas activity . PHMSA employs a mere
208 inspectors who, along with 345 state inspectors, are
responsible “for regulating nearly 3,000 companies that
operate 2 .7 million miles of pipelines, 148 liquefied natural
gas plants, and 7,571 hazardous liquid breakout tanks .”56
The oil industry also has one of the highest rates of severe
workplace injury among its workers .57

Future Threats to Water

Bayou Bridge Pipeline

Oil and pipeline companies have devastated the Gulf coast
and the Atchafalaya Basin, harming some of the most amazing
ecosystems on Earth, putting millions of people at greater risk
of flooding .64 The Bayou Bridge pipeline is a great example of
what is wrong with pipeline construction in Louisiana . It will
traverse over, under or through the Calcasieu River, Mermentau
River, Vermilion River, Bayou Teche, West Atchafalaya Basin
Levee, Atchafalaya River Basin and multiple bayous that
provide unique habitat for many rare species . There is pending
litigation arguing that the existing corridor being used to
place the Bayou Bridge Pipeline is already out-of-compliance
with permits issued for prior pipeline projects . In the same
litigation, opponents argue that another existing pipeline in the
Atchafalaya Basin co-owned by Energy Transfer Partners is also
out of compliance with a previously-issued permit .65 Disposal
of dredged material during the construction of these earlier
pipelines led to the creation of spoil banks which have been
found to cause serious disturbances of water flow and impact
the distribution of sediments in the Basin .66 Historically there
has been little enforcement of permit violations .67

The Bayou Bridge pipeline is a joint venture between ETP
and Phillips 6668 (two of the participants in DAPL) that will
transport up to 480,000 barrels of crude oil a day across
Louisiana, from Nederland, Texas (the southern terminus
of the Bakken pipeline) to refineries in St . James, Louisiana
(about 50 miles up the Mississippi River from New Orleans) .69
Phase I of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, from Nederland, Texas
to Lake Charles, Louisiana, is already operational . However,
Phase II, the proposed 163-mile portion from Lake Charles to
St . James, is under construction and multiple lawsuits have
been filed to challenge the permits issued in 2017 .70

As detailed in a U .S . Army Corps of Engineers Environmental
Assessment, Bayou Bridge Pipeline LLC plans to use horizontal
directional drilling (HDD) to run pipe under 8 federal projects
and 14 federal easements (mostly crossings of rivers,
waterways and levees) .71 As is typical, PHMSA conducted a
“worst case” analysis for spills occurring at those crossings,
but details of that analysis have not been made public .

Analysis by FracTracker Alliance found that the pipeline would
cross “700 acres of fragile wetlands, and watersheds that
supply drinking water for up to 300,000 people” and noted
that “essential ecosystem services that the wetlands provide,
absorbing floodwaters, could be compromised, leading to
increased erosion and sedimentation downstream . Impacts
to these wetlands could be greatly magnified into the already
environmentally stressed Gulf .”72

Assuming the U .S . system-wide rate for significant crude oil
spills of 0 .001 per year per mile, we estimate that the Bayou
Bridge Pipeline would suffer eight significant spills during a
50-year nominal lifetime . In February 2018, a federal court
issued an injunction stopping construction while the court
considers environmental challenges to the project .73 But that
injunction was stayed by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in
March with an expedited hearing on the injunction appeal
scheduled before a merits panel on April 30, 2018 .74

Bayou Bridge Pipeline began clearing for construction
in the Atchafalaya Basin in January 2018 .75 Despite the
elevated annual rise of water in the Basin, Bayou Bridge
intends to continue construction in the Basin during high
water season .76 Construction during high water could
exacerbate the damage to wetlands, channeling sediment-
laden water into the interior swamps through pipeline
canals, causing increased sedimentation and filling of
wetlands which reduce their future capability to protect
millions of people from Mississippi River floods .77

Permian Express

In late 2017, ETP brought its Permian Express 3 pipeline
online, transporting crude oil from the Permian basin (a
major oil and gas producing basin located in West Texas and
parts of New Mexico) to facilities in Nederland, Texas, and is
“aggressively” evaluating a further expansion of that line .78
