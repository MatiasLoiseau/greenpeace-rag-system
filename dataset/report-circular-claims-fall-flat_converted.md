A. Comprehensive U.S. Survey of
Plastics Recyclability

1. Executive Summary

A comprehensive survey of plastic product waste collection,
sortation and reprocessing in the United States (U.S.) was
performed to determine the legitimacy of “recyclable”
claims and labels on consumer plastic products. The survey
is based on current conditions in October 2019 to January
2020 and U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Green Guides
requirements for product claims and labeling.

Accurate recyclable claims and labels serve three valuable
functions: truthful advertising to consumers, prevention of
harmful contamination in America’s recycling system, and
identification	of	products	for	elimination	or	redesign	to
reduce waste and plastic pollution.

Key results of the survey include:

1.  Only some PET #1 and HDPE #2 plastic bottles and
jugs can be legitimately labeled as recyclable in the
U.S. today.

2.  Common plastic pollution items, including single use

plastic food service and convenience products, cannot
be legitimately claimed as recyclable in the U.S.

3.  Plastics #3-7 have negligible-to-negative value and
are	effectively	a	category	of	products	that	municipal
recycling programs may collect, but do not actually
recycle.  Plastic #3-7 waste collected in municipal
systems	across	the	country	is	being	sent	to	landfills
or incinerated.

4.  Many full body shrink sleeves on PET #1 and HDPE #2

bottles and jugs make them non-recyclable.

Since China enacted policies limiting plastic waste imports,
there	have	been	significant	changes	in	plastics	acceptance
policies of U.S. material recovery facilities due to declines
in the demand for and value of collected plastic material.
Post-consumer “mixed” plastics (plastics #3-7 and non-bottle
plastics	#1	and	#2)	have	been	most	affected	because	China
was the primary destination for those types of collected
plastic wastes and there is minimal demand, value or
reprocessing capacity for them in the U.S. Some material
recovery facilities (MRFs) still accept mixed plastics but
dispose of it or continue to export it outside of North America.
Since collected mixed plastics are disposed of, incinerated

or	exported	without	verified	recycling,	acceptance	of	such	a
plastic	item	at	a	MRF	alone	is	not	sufficient	and	reasonable
assurance to a customer that it will be manufactured into
another item, as required by the FTC.2

Therefore, it is fair to assume that the standard for
reasonable likelihood of a plastic item being recycled
requires acceptance by municipal collection and U.S.
domestic recycling/reprocessing capacity. Companies
cannot legitimately place recycle symbols or “Check Locally”
text on products made from plastics #3-7 because MRFs
nationwide cannot assure consumers that valueless
plastics #3-7 bales will actually be bought and recycled
into a new product.

The	results	of	this	survey	reflect	the	current	conditions	in
early	2020,	but	may	be	affected	in	the	future	by	changes	in
collected material value, Americans’ access to recycling and
domestic plastics reprocessing capacity. The economics of
collecting, sorting and reprocessing plastic products are likely
to worsen as expansion of plastic production lowers the cost
of new plastic resin.

2. Key Takeaways for Companies
Making and Selling Plastic-Packaged
Products

In response to growing public concern on plastic pollution
and excessive plastic waste generation, many corporations
are	making	high	profile,	global	commitments	to	make	their
products recyclable, reusable or compostable.3  Companies
are expanding the use of “recyclable” labels on plastic
products at an aggressive pace.4  Since claims and labels
affect	a	consumer’s	purchasing	decision,	the	claims	and
labels must not be misleading to be legal and provide the
environmental	benefits	claimed.

Key outcomes from this comprehensive survey of U.S.
collection, sortation and post-consumer plastic reprocessing
facilities and recommendations for companies:

1.  Only PET #1 and HDPE #2 bottles and jugs, with

acceptable shrink sleeves and labels, can be claimed
as recyclable in the U.S. today.  The many other types
of consumer plastic products and packaging are not
recyclable and should not be claimed or labeled as such.

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT  |  4

2.  Companies are liable and at risk now. Companies that
make “recyclable” claims in marketing materials or on
products are liable for misrepresentation and need to
ensure that the claims are accurate and not deceptive or
misleading. Recyclable claims or labels on products other
than PET #1 and HDPE #2 bottles and jugs are not accurate
in the U.S. and expose companies to legal, reputational
and	financial	liability	risks.

3.  Companies need to develop their own recycling

expertise.	Given	the	significant	financial	and	brand
risks associated with labeling products as recyclable,
companies must have credible in-house expertise on the
local recyclability of their products and must verify the
accuracy of labels themselves. Outsourcing the decision
and approval of product labels to external organizations
does not protect companies from being held liable for
misrepresentation if incorrect labels are used.

4.  Companies must be truthful and transparent in

progress reports on pledge commitments. In the U.S.,
public claims of progress on recyclable, compostable
or reusable products are subject to the requirements
of the FTC Green Guides. Companies who have made
global commitments must produce progress reports
that	include	the	local	recyclability	of	specific	products
that	they	sell	in	each	market.	Sufficient	detail	and
transparency must be provided to prove claims of
the progress made.

5.  Companies must take extended producer

responsibility. Companies that want their plastic
products to be recyclable should make direct
investments in collection, sortation and proven
mechanical	reprocessing	of	the	specific	type	of	plastic
product. Companies cannot simply label their plastic
products as “recyclable” and expect taxpayers to pay
for the recycling systems to achieve it.  Nor can they
stall progress and rely on future development of
unproven and problematic chemical recycling schemes.
Just as companies invest in new product factories when
they	want	to	meet	their	profit	goals,	companies	must
similarly invest in collection, sortation and reprocessing
to meet recyclable pledge goals.

Most types of plastic packaging are economically
impossible to recycle now and will remain so in the
foreseeable future. Companies must move beyond
the outdated, failed approach of promoting recycling
as the solution to excessive plastic waste and pollution.
Furthermore, few U.S. cities have industrial composting
facilities5 required to treat compostable plastics and
many compost facility operators don’t want compostable
plastics.6 We cannot recycle or compost our way out of

the growing plastic pollution problem. Instead of pretending
that the trillions of throwaway plastic items produced each
year will be recycled or composted, we must stop producing
so	many	of	them	in	the	first	place.	To	meet	their	“recyclable,
reusable or compostable” pledge commitments, companies
must	become	serious	about	employing	reusable/refillable
business models.

Governments and corporations are increasingly aware
that their constituents and customers want choices that
are better for the environment and our families now and the
future generations to come, as demonstrated by legislative
action7 and pledges by companies8 on plastic products.

To protect the health of humans and fellow creatures
who share our planet, the urgent priority must be to
eliminate single-use consumer plastic, and to invest
in reusable, refillable and package-free approaches.

3. Survey Purpose and Drivers

This survey establishes a transparent, traceable review for
the purpose of determining the legitimacy of “recyclable”
claims and labels on United States (U.S.) consumer plastic
products based on the current conditions in January 2020
and U.S Code of Federal Regulations 16 CFR 260 (“Green
Guides”) requirements for product claims and labeling.
In the Green Guides, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
requires that “Marketers must ensure that all reasonable
interpretations of their claims are truthful, not misleading,
and supported by a reasonable basis before they make
the claims.”9 The FTC further states: “In the context of
environmental	marketing	claims,	a	reasonable	basis	often
requires	competent	and	reliable	scientific	evidence.	Such
evidence consists of tests, analyses, research, or studies
that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective
manner	by	qualified	persons.”

The U.S. is grappling with two major plastic waste
problems: plastic pollution and generation of excessive
plastic	waste	that	is	disposed	to	landfills	or	incinerated
with	significant	carbon	emissions.	In	the	past	few	years,
there have been massive changes in America’s recycling
systems and an increase in plastic production that has
reduced the cost of new plastic. The last comprehensive
assessment of plastic waste recyclability was performed
in 2015/201610 and is not representative of current market
conditions, in part because of waste import restrictions
imposed by China. An accurate and up-to-date analysis of
the existing domestic collection and recycling/reprocessing
capacity is needed now to determine the true recyclability
of plastic consumer products.

3.1 Why do Truthful Claims and Labels on
Plastic Products Matter?
Accurate recyclable claims and labels on consumer products
serve three valuable functions:

1.  Honest Advertising to Consumers: Claims and

labels on products inform customers whether there
is	a	potential	environmental	benefit	to	one	product
compared	to	another.	Since	claims	and	labels	affect
a consumer’s purchasing decisions, the claims and
labels must not be misleading to be legal.11

2.  Prevent Harm to America’s Recycling System
and Avoid Wasted Energy, Labor and Costs:
Incorrect recyclable labels cause consumers to
mistakenly place an item in a recycle bin and cause
contamination in municipal recovery facilities (MRFs).
The contamination harms the ability of the MRFs to
cost-effectively	collect	and	sort	other	materials	such
as cardboard and paper that are easily ruined by
contact with food-soiled packaging.12 Energy, carbon
emissions, labor and costs are wasted from collecting
and sorting unwanted, worthless items through
municipal sortation systems.13

3.  Identify Products for Redesign to Reduce

Waste and Plastic Pollution: Plastic consumer
products that are not practically recyclable in
municipal	systems	should	be	the	first	to	be	eliminated
or	redesigned,	preferably	to	be	refillable	or	reusable
products, or be made from more environmentally
advantageous materials.

Companies have marketed consumer products as having
an	environmental	benefit,	such	as	being	recyclable,	since
the 1980s.14 In response to growing public concern about
plastic pollution and excessive plastic waste generation,
many	companies	are	making	high	profile,	global
commitments to make their products recyclable, reusable
or compostable.15 Product and packaging manufacturers
are also pressuring MRFs to accept plastic to make them
appear redeemable and avoid plastic bans. As the nation’s
largest waste collection and sortation company, Waste
Management, stated in their 2018 Annual Report, “bans
have increased pressure by manufacturers on our recycling
facilities to accept a broader array of materials in curbside
recycling programs to alleviate public pressures to ban
the sale of those materials. However, with no viable end
markets for recycling these materials, we and other recyclers
are working to educate and remind customers of the need
for end market demand and economic viability to support
sustainable recycling programs.”16

Companies that make “recyclable” claims in marketing
materials or on products may face liability from consumers
as well as from the FTC for misrepresentation and need
to ensure that the claims are accurate and not deceptive
or misleading. A class action lawsuit on recyclable claims
on single use plastic products is currently pending against
Keurig Green Mountain in U.S. Federal District Court.17 Other
corporations	could	face	similar,	significant	financial	and
reputational risks from deceptive labels on their plastic
products that are on store shelves now.

3.2 Massive Change in U.S. Plastic
Recycling Markets
Since the mid-1990s, U.S. states and cities have sought
to increase recycling of municipal solid waste to avoid
disposal	by	landfill	or	incineration.18 Due to low cost
shipping and labor, the U.S. became reliant on China to
accept plastic materials collected by U.S. municipal systems.
Over time, the types of plastics accepted in municipal
systems and labeled as “recyclable” grew from domestically
recyclable PET #1 and HDPE #2 bottles and jugs to other
types of plastics as cities and states emphasized “diversion”
and companies sought to brand more of their plastic
products as environmentally redeemable.

Changes in the global trade of plastics waste started in
2013 when China’s Green Fence policy began restricting
imports of contaminated materials. As shown on
Resource Recycling’s detailed timeline, China’s National
Sword policy followed in 2018 and the decline in exports
of plastic waste and other post-consumer materials has
significantly	impacted	America’s	municipal	recycling
collection systems.19,20

According to chemical industry experts at Independent
Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS), “This has completely
changed the dynamics of the market. China is no longer a
route for recycling and the expectation is that countries
now deal with their own waste.”21 A representative of the
Solid Waste Association of North America stated: “We’re
producing a lot of waste ourselves, and we should take
care of it ourselves.”22

Waste and recycling experts state that even before China’s
policy changes, “a lot of areas fooled themselves into
thinking they were recycling when they were really not.”23
Export of plastic waste has declined sharply due to China’s
policies, import restrictions placed by other countries and
concerns that many alternative receiving countries cannot
provide assurance that the imported plastic waste will
be safely and responsibly recycled into new products.

Since the documentary “Plastic China” debuted in
China in 2014,24 more than 60 investigations and articles
have shown that millions of tons of exported plastic wastes
have been dumped or burned rather than recycled.25 In
response,	companies	are	shifting	practices.	For	example,
in 2019, Waste Management adopted a corporate policy to
ship post-consumer plastics to only North American plastic
recyclers/reprocessors.26 Casella Waste Systems, the nation’s
fifth	largest	waste	collection	and	sortation	company,	no
longer exports residential plastics.27

3.3 Competition with Cheaper, Shinier
New Plastic
It isn’t just the decline in export options that is hurting
plastic recycling. The competition with cheaper new plastic
that generally has higher quality harms the market demand
for recycled plastic. While some plastic waste items may
be technically recyclable, the cost to do so is prohibitively
high because product manufacturers prefer to buy higher
quality new plastic at a lower cost. Back in 2015, the negative
impacts of relatively cheap crude oil and natural gas were
identified	by	Waste	Management	as	a	reason	that	customers
preferred to buy cheaper new plastic than more expensive
recycled plastic.28

The massive expansion of plastic production in the
U.S., fueled by at least $200 billion of investment in 340
petrochemical projects,29	is	flooding	the	market	and	causing
polyethylene prices to decline to historic lows - below prices
last	seen	during	the	2008	financial	crisis.30, 31 Plastic prices
continued to decline in November and December 2019 as
feedstock costs were lower, supply outpaced demand, and
overall global demand slowed.32 As a recycling veteran stated
in his predictions for 2020: “With the surge in new virgin resin
capacity coming online, prices for those resins are likely to go
down and depress recycled resin prices.”33

When MRFs lose money on collecting and sorting plastic
or other material, it drives their decision to stop accepting
it. Section 9 provides evidence found during the survey
of the negligible value of plastic #3-7 materials and how it
influences	MRF	decisions	to	restrict	acceptance	of	plastics
to PET #1 and HDPE #2 bottles and jugs.

3.4 Current Market Conditions for
U.S. Post-Consumer Plastic Waste
America’s post-consumer collection, sorting and reprocessing/
recycling systems are now stressed, and in some cases failing
due to excessive waste generation, contamination and severe
declines in commodity values for collected cardboard, paper,
metal, glass and plastic materials.34,35

Since China enacted the National Sword policy on January
1, 2018 limiting plastic waste imports, there have been
significant	changes	in	plastics	acceptance	policies	of	U.S.
material recovery facilities due to declines in the demand
for and value of collected plastic material. In Florida, the
Department of Environmental Protection advises residents
to only recycle plastic bottles and jugs.36 The Oregon Refuse
and Recycling Association also recommends that only
plastic #1-2 bottles & jugs be collected.37 Due to lack of
markets, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
(DNR)	has	confirmed	to	stakeholders	that	mixed	plastics
(#3-7) can legally be disposed, even if the material has
been sorted and baled.38

Current viable markets in the U.S. only exist for PET #1
and HDPE #2 plastic bottles and jugs. China was the primary
destination for other types of plastic waste and there is
minimal demand and reprocessing capacity for them
in the U.S. In Summer 2019, More Recycling stated that:
“Most West Coast materials recovery facilities (MRFs) are
not equipped to sort plastics beyond PET and HDPE bottles.
This	material	is	often	referred	to	as	3-7,	but	it	includes	small
rigid plastic of all resins, as well as missed PET and HDPE
bottles.	It	is	this	mix	that	is	struggling	to	find	a	market	in
the wake of National Sword.”39

MRFs are now adapting to these new market conditions
and scaling back acceptance of plastic products.40 As this
survey reveals, many MRFs only accept the two types of
post-consumer plastic items (PET #1 and HDPE #2 bottles
and	jugs)	that	are	recyclable	in	the	U.S.	due	to	sufficient
market demand and domestic reprocessing capacity.
For example, the City of Erie, Pennsylvania now instructs
residents to only recycle #1 and #2 plastic bottles and
jugs, stating: “We cannot collect an item for recycling,
unless we have an end user who is willing to purchase and
recycle that item. China used to accept most of the #3, 4, 5,
and 7 plastics, but it turns out that most of these plastics
were not actually being recycled. They were mostly being
burned for fuel.”41

Some MRFs still accept plastics #3-7 and non-bottle #1-2
but dispose of it or continue to export it outside of North
America due to the lack of domestic buyers and reprocessing
capacity. In some cases, cities that have long term contracts
with MRFs are forcing them to continue to collect plastics
that have negligible domestic market demand and will be
landfilled.42,43 As contracts are reviewed for renewal and
the public understands the true fate and negative costs
of collecting unrecyclable materials, MRF acceptance
policies will continue to consolidate to PET #1 and HDPE #2
bottles and jugs only.

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT  |  7

A recycler in Illinois highlighted plastics #3-7 as a problem,
stating, “Anything like a yogurt container, fruit container
or cottage cheese container — you name it, those are
products you cannot get rid of right now. There’s no
marketability, so I think you’re going to continue to see a
trend of those being eliminated from recycling program.”44

When the city of Laramie, Wyoming stopped accepting plastics
#3-7, a city council member said “This wasn’t a decision we
made to reduce our recycling, there simply just is not a market
for this plastic. If we want to counter this, then reduction is
the only option. So quit using plastics 3-7 if you can.” 45

ReThink Waste, a public agency that operates the Shoreway
MRF in San Carlos, California, sums up the reality of plastics
markets in Figure 1: “Plastics #1 & 2 are readily recyclable
and are usually recycled in the U.S. Plastics #3-7 are all
versions	of	hard	plastic	that	are	very	difficult	to	recycle.
There is currently no market for the material when it is

deconstructed.”46 The Shoreway MRF continues to accept
plastics #3-7 but clearly states that the collected material
is	sent	to	landfill.

According to the East Bay Express, environmental advocacy
groups in California believe that local governments need
to start being more transparent about what materials are
actually recyclable and that cities should stop collecting
non-bottle plastics in recycling bins altogether.47

3.5 Acceptance by a MRF is Not Proof
of Recycling
The	Shoreway	MRF’s	disposal	of	plastics	to	landfill	is	not
unique.  In January 2019, Washington State’s Department of
Ecology advised citizens that “Commodities such as paper
and	plastic	are	piling	up	or	being	sent	to	landfills.”48 In June
2019, an in-depth Guardian investigation revealed that “cities
around the country are no longer recycling many types of

plastic dropped into recycling bins. Instead, they
are	being	landfilled,	burned	or	stockpiled.”49 In
Blaine County, Idaho residents are told to recycle
plastics items Nos. 1-5, but only #1 and 2 bottles
are actually being recycled, with the rest  being
dumped	in	a	landfill	south	of	Salt	Lake	City.50
Section 8 provides evidence found across the
country	of	collected	plastics	being	sent	to	landfill,
incineration or stockpiled, but not recycled.

Since a substantial portion of collected plastics
are disposed of, incinerated or exported without
verification	of	recycling,	acceptance	of	a
plastic	item	at	a	MRF	alone	is	not	sufficient	and
“reasonable” assurance to a customer that it will
be manufactured into another item, as required
by	the	FTC	in	16	CFR	260.	Sufficient	market
demand and domestic recycling/reprocessing
capacity must exist for a plastic product to be
considered “recyclable.” Without market demand
and domestic recycling/reprocessing capacity, the
plastic material collected by the MRFs will not be
bought by manufacturers and will not be recycled
into another product.

In the FTC Green Guides Statement of Basis and
Purpose section titled “Packages Collected for
Public Policy Reasons but Not Recycled,” the FTC
states:	“The	Commission	agrees	that	unqualified
recyclable claims for categories of products
that municipal recycling programs collect, but
do not actually recycle, may be deceptive. To
make	a	non-deceptive	unqualified	claim, a
marketer should substantiate that a substantial
majority of consumers or communities have

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FALL FLAT  |  8

Figure 1: ReThink Waste – Shoreway MRF: The Hard Facts About Plastic51

access to facilities that will actually recycle, not accept
and ultimately discard, the product. As part of this
analysis, a marketer should not assume that consumers or
communities have access to a particular recycling program
merely because the program will accept a product.”52

2.  Acceptance of plastic materials at a MRF is not proof that

materials will be recycled.

3.  Export of plastic materials to countries with poor waste

management is not proof that materials will be recycled.

Therefore, it is fair to assume that the

standard for reasonable likelihood of

a plastic item being recycled requires

acceptance by municipal collection and

U.S. domestic recycling/reprocessing

capacity.

This FTC requirement puts the burden of proof on product
companies to substantiate that MRFs that are accepting
their recyclable-labeled products are selling plastic bales
to	reprocessors	that	are	verifiably	recycling	the	plastic
bales into resin for manufacturing into new products.

3.6 Current Business Practices for Labeling
Products as “Recyclable” are Outdated
A comprehensive study of the national access to municipal
collection of post-consumer items for recycling was last
performed in 2015/2016, by two consulting companies
(RRS and Moore Recycling) contracted by The Sustainable
Packaging Coalition (SPC); this pre-dated China’s 2018
National Sword policy that severely impacted America’s
collection and recycling/reprocessing systems.53 The
study focused solely on the acceptance of items by of
municipal collection but acknowledged that “It also must
be realized that other questions must be answered in
order to understand the full picture of recyclability.”
The study did not assess whether collected materials
were disposed or exported to countries with poor waste
management. Project sponsors included manufacturers
and retailers that have interests in securing “recyclable”
claims and labels for their products.54

Product, packaging and retail companies appear to be still
employing the SPC 2015-6 access-to-collection data to
substantiate claims and label products as “recyclable”
in 2020. This approach is not accurate or valid because:

1.  Acceptance of plastics #3-7 and non-bottle plastics #1-2
by	MRFs	has	significantly	decreased	since	2015/2016
because the value of those types of plastic materials has
declined to essentially zero. (RecycleMorePlastic.org
reports the nationwide value of bales of “3-7 Bottles
and Small Rigid Plastics” to be worth $0.003 per pound
in December 2019).55

In 2018, the Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) published
a survey of plastics acceptance at the largest municipality
in each U.S. state and in Washington, D.C.56 This survey was
limited to 51 municipal recycling websites and was performed
before the impacts of China’s National Sword policy were
seen at U.S. MRFs. Similar to the SPC Study, the APR survey
is not valid for determining the legitimacy of recyclable
claims and labels because it focused on acceptance only
and is out of date.

Since the previous assessments of plastic waste recyclability
are out of date, did not assess whether collected plastic was
actually recycled and not representative of current market
conditions, a comprehensive survey of all 367 operating MRFs
in the U.S. and domestic collection and domestic recycling/
reprocessing capacity was performed to determine the true
recyclability of plastic consumer products in 2020.

4. Key Results

To meet the recycle label threshold required by the FTC Green
Guides, it is fair to expect that Americans must have access
to both collection/sortation and recycling/reprocessing
of	a	specific	item	into	plastic	resin	that	could	be	used	to
manufacture another item. In this comprehensive survey,
both types of facilities were assessed:

1.  Collection and sortation (MRF) facilities: The 367

operating U.S. residential MRFs were surveyed for their
publicly-posted	lists	of	specific	types	of	plastic	products
that are accepted in their curbside recycling bins.  (Details
provided in Section 7.1 - Survey of U.S. Material Recovery
Facilities)57

2.  Plastic reprocessing capacity of facilities that turn the
collected/sorted material into plastic resin was assessed
for	total	U.S.	processing	capacity	of	specific	types	of	post-
consumer plastics. (Details provided in Section 7.2 - Survey
of U.S. Recycling/Reprocessing Capacity for Post-Consumer
Plastic Waste)

Table 1 summarizes the survey results for plastic bottles, jugs,
tubs and pods and provides an assessment of whether the
specific	product	can	legitimately	be	labeled	as	“recyclable”
according to the requirements of the FTC Green Guides.
(Details of the FTC Green Guides requirements are provided
in Section 6). The columns are described in detail in the
footnotes to the table.

American Population have access to municipal recycling to claim an item as recyclable.

(1) Bottles cannot have non-recyclable or non-sortable shrink sleeves.

Key Result A: Only plastic PET #1 & HDPE #2
bottles and jugs have sufficient domestic
municipal collection and reprocessing
capacity to provide consumers with
reasonable assurance that a collected item
will be recycled into another product.

PET #1 and HDPE #2 Bottles and Jugs: The 2020 U.S. MRF
Survey showed that these items are accepted by 100% of MRFs.
Based on up-to-date estimates (described in Section 7.3),
87% of the total American population has access to curbside
and	drop-off	recycling	service	of	some	type.	It	is	assumed
that	drop-off	recycling	center	also	accept	PET	#1	and	HDPE	#2
bottles and jugs. Therefore, the overall access to recycling by
the	total	American	population	is	87%	and	significantly	more
than the 60% acceptance required by the FTC.

Polypropylene (PP#5) Tubs and Containers: The 2020 U.S.
MRF Survey showed that these items are only accepted by
53% of U.S. MRFs. Based on up-to-date estimates for access
to	curbside	and	drop-off	recycling,	described	in	Section	7.3,
only 31% of the total American population has access to
collection of PP#5 tubs and containers. However, acceptance
of the PP#5 tub by a MRF is not proof that the PP#5 tub will
actually be recycled into a new product. PP#5 is typically
collected as part of a mixed plastics #3-7 bale, which is not a
“market-ready” bale as required by the Association of Plastic
Recyclers	(APR)	in	their	definition	of	“recyclable”	plastic.58
The plastics industry acknowledges that individually most
plastics #3-7 “are not available in the quantities necessary to
justify	investments	in	optical	sorting	and	are	difficult	to	sort
manually due to a variety of resins used for a wide range of
similar applications (i.e., creating ‘look-a-like’ materials and
products). Therefore, most MRFs produce a mixed plastic,
‘#3-7’ or ‘pre-picked’ bale that requires further sorting prior to
recycling.”59 However, the economics to do that have proven
to be insurmountable. A secondary plastics sorting facility

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FA LL FLAT  |  10

(QRS Recycling in Dundee, MD) opened in 2015 to separate
mixed-plastic bales into individual resin and color streams
but went bankrupt in 2017.60

Mixed plastic #3-7 bales, previously exported to China,
now have negligible to negative value across the country
and	“cannot	be	effectively	or	efficiently	recycled”	in	the
U.S, according to a Kentucky-based recycler.61 This survey
found that some MRFs that still accept PP#5 tubs are
known	to	send	plastic	waste	to	a	landfill	or	incinerator.
Some of the MRFs that accept PP#5 tubs are known to
export plastic waste to countries in Asia (see Table 9),
which, as detailed in Section 3, does not provide adequate
assurance that the material is actually recycled into a
new product.

Compounding the problem of recycling post-consumer
PP#5 plastic items is that there are a limited number of
plastic reprocessing facilities that will buy post-consumer
PP#5 plastic. Analysis in Section 7.2 shows that there is
less than 5% U.S. domestic reprocessing capacity for PP#5
post-consumer waste. The facilities are primarily in the
south and east U.S., with the largest U.S. processor of
PP#5 located in Alabama. Trucking collected PP#5 tubs
and containers thousands of miles from the West Coast
or North East to Alabama is problematic from a cost or
carbon emissions perspective.

Since the FTC requires that “a marketer should
substantiate that a substantial majority of consumers
or communities have access to facilities that will
actually recycle, not accept and ultimately discard,
the product,”62 companies cannot legitimately claim
or label PP#5 tubs and containers as recyclable.

Lastly, the economics of collecting, sorting and recycling
post-consumer polypropylene products are becoming even
more	stressed	and	do	not	provide	a	sufficient	driver	for	a
MRF to invest in collection or separation of PP#5 post-
consumer products from mixed plastics #3-7 bales. A billion
pounds of new polypropylene production aimed at the
U.S. market is coming online in mid 2020 and the price of
new polypropylene continues to decline.63,64 In parallel, the
value of collected post-consumer PP#5 is also declining.

The current (January 2020) average value of a post-consumer
PP#5 bale is now between 5 and 6 cents/lb across the
country.65 This is a drop of more than 50% in market value
since the summer of 2019.66

PP#5 and PS#6 Coffee Pods: The 2020 U.S. MRF Survey
did	not	find	evidence	of	acceptance	of	these	items	at	MRFs.
This is likely due to the fact that the pods are smaller than
the 2 inch by 2 inch standard size requirement for sortation
at MRFs.67,68

Key Result B: Many commonly polluted
single use plastic items do not have
sufficient acceptance by municipal
collection or sufficient U.S. domestic
reprocessing capacity to provide consumers
with reasonable assurance that a collected
item will be recycled into another product.

Table 2 summarizes the survey results for single use plastic
food service and convenience items that are typically found
in a list of top plastic pollution items collected during beach
cleanups.69  The 2020 U.S. MRF Survey found limited or no
acceptance of any of these items at MRFs. It should be noted
that the PET used in clamshells and trays is not the same
as that used in a soda bottle.70 The survey also showed low
processing capacity for the types of materials that the items
are made from.

Based on the lack of acceptance by municipal collection
and low processing capacity, the assessment showed that
none of these items can be legitimately claimed or labeled
as recyclable in the U.S. Furthermore, when accepted by
MRFs, it was found that these items are collected in mixed
plastic bales that have negligible value and are known to
be	disposed	to	landfill,	incinerated	or	exported	without
verification	of	recycling	such	that	a	consumer	cannot	“check
locally” to determine if the item will be recycled.

Key Result C: Plastics #3-7 cannot be
legitimately labeled as “recyclable”
under FTC guidelines. Consumers cannot
“Check Locally” to determine if a plastic
#3-7 item will actually be recycled into a
new product.

Acceptance by MRFs of plastics #3-7 does not prove that the
plastic will be destined “for reuse or use in manufacturing
or assembling another item” as required by the FTC. The
comprehensive 2020 U.S. MRF Survey of 367 collection and
sortation systems documents that while some MRFs still
accept plastics #3-7, some of the collected plastics #3-7
are	being	landfilled	or	incinerated	due	to	lack	of	domestic
market demand and buyers. Additionally, some MRFs that
accept plastics #3-7 are known to still export plastic waste
to countries with poor waste management and without
verification	that	the	plastic	will	actually	be	recycled	into
a new product. Therefore, plastics #3-7 is a category of
products that municipal recycling programs may collect,
but do not actually recycle, and labeling of products made
from those types of plastic may be deceptive.

Companies	often	place	labels	of	large	recycle	symbols	with
small words “Check Locally” on products that less than the
FTC’s	required	“significant	amount”	(>60%)	of	Americans
have access to recycle through a municipal collection
system.	“Check	Locally”	is	often	found	on	plastics	#3-7
items. However, “Check Locally” is not legitimate because
consumers cannot determine if their collected plastics will
actually be recycled at a reprocessing facility. For example,
if a resident checked on the local  Salt Lake City recycling
website, it states that plastic containers are accepted with
photos including plastics #1-7.72 But it has been reported
that plastic waste collected through curbside recycling in
Salt Lake City is sent to a cement kiln where it is burned
for energy and not recycled.73

Companies cannot legitimately place recycle symbols
or “Check Locally” text on plastics #3-7 because MRFs
cannot inform consumers whether their collected
plastics #3-7, which has negligible-to-negative market
value, will actually be bought and recycled into a
new product.

Key Result D: Many full body shrink sleeves
on PET #1 and HDPE #2 bottles and jugs
make them non-recyclable.

Many product companies are using full body shrink sleeve
labels on plastic bottles to improve shelf appeal. Commonly
used polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) and polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) shrink sleeves are known to prevent proper
sortation of the bottles in MRFs and harm the operations of
PET bottle recyclers/reprocessors.74 Yet product companies
continue to employ these types of shrink sleeves. The product
companies are evidently aware that the shrink sleeves they
use prohibit proper sortation and harm recycling of the plastic
bottles because they place instructions on the bottles telling
consumers to remove the shrink sleeves.

This is in violation of FTC Green Guides 16 CFR 260.12d that
states: “If any component significantly limits the ability to
recycle the item, any recyclable claim would be deceptive.
An item that is made from recyclable material, but,
because of its shape, size, or some other attribute, is not
accepted in recycling programs, should not be marketed as
recyclable.”75 The FTC Green Guides do not allow companies
to instruct consumers to remove an integral part of the
product packaging to make it recyclable.

5. Conclusion and Forward Look

The comprehensive survey of U.S. post-consumer plastic
product collection, sortation and reprocessing capacity
determined that only PET #1 and HDPE #2 plastic bottles
and jugs (without harmful shrink sleeves) can legitimately be
claimed or labeled as recyclable. Recyclable labels on other
consumer plastic products do not provide truthful advertising
to American consumers and are a cause of contamination
and	inefficiency	plaguing	America’s	municipal	collection	and
plastics recycling/reprocessing systems.

As	scientific	evidence	of	the	harm	caused	by	plastic	pollution
continues to mount, discussions about what to do about
single use plastic are underway in the U.S. Congress and
city halls and state capitals across the country, as well as
in corporate board rooms. This survey demonstrates that
many types of commonly used plastic packaging are not
recyclable,	and	are	being	landfilled,	incinerated,	or	exported
without	verification	of	recycling.	All	of	these	approaches
have	significant	consequences	for	environmental	and	human
health, which will continue to increase as long as these
packaging materials are employed.

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FA LL FLAT  |  13

The	results	of	this	survey	effort	are	valid	now,	but	may	be
affected	in	the	future	by	changes	in	collected	material	value,
Americans’ access to municipal recycling, and domestic
post-consumer plastic reprocessing capacity. There are
negative	economic	factors	working	against	recycling:	fixed
and operating costs of MRFs continue to increase as the
commodity values of collected materials continues to
decline.76  As municipal collection contracts come up for
renewal and service prices increase to cover the revenue gap,
additional municipalities are considering whether to end
curbside recycling.77,78,79 For example, in Brook Park, Ohio,
the cost to process recyclables are going to skyrocket from
$44/ton	to	$124/ton	and	city	officials	have	begun	considering
options for managing the high cost including a possible
moratorium on recycling.80

The economic driver for collecting, sorting and reprocessing
post-consumer plastic products is likely to worsen as
expansion of plastic production lowers the cost of new resin.

While new types of plastics reprocessing systems are being
discussed,81 chemical recycling processes are complicated,
expensive and have not been proven at commercial scale to
cost-effectively	reprocess	diverse	post-consumer	plastic	waste
and produce a resin that can be manufactured into another
product.	Furthermore,	significant	concerns	persist	about
the energy and fresh water requirements and environmental
impacts of chemical recycling systems.

Since the cost to recycle PET #1 and HDPE #2 is now higher
than new plastic,82 there is no guarantee that even PET #1 and
HDPE	#2	bottles	and	jugs	will	meet	the	“recyclable”	definition
in the future.

Moving forward, an updated annual analysis and transparent,
traceable account of the current domestic collection,
sortation and recycling/reprocessing capacity of post-
consumer plastic products is required to determine legitimacy
of recyclable claims.

B. Survey Basis, Approach, Detailed
Results and Evidence Found

6. Legal Basis for Recyclable Claims
on Products

6.1 FTC Green Guides (16 CFR 260)
In the U.S., claims and labels relating to environmental
benefits	of	products	are	regulated	at	the	national	level	by	the
FTC “Green Guides” established by the FTC pursuant to its
authority under U.S. Federal Trade Commission Act.83	Codified
in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 16 CFR 260 (Guides
for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims), the Green
Guides contain standards and examples to help companies
understand what constitutes deceptive or misleading
environmental advertising.84 The Green Guides do not
preempt state or local laws.

The FTC Green Guides are based on consumer understanding
of environmental claims and require that “Marketers must
ensure that all reasonable interpretations of their claims are
truthful, not misleading, and supported by a reasonable basis
before they make the claims.”85

The Green Guides’ requirements apply to labels, advertising,
other forms of marketing in any medium directly or through
implication. Claims on products, press releases,
presentations and on company websites are covered.

The Green Guides state that “A representation, omission,
or practice is deceptive if it is likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances and is
material to consumers’ decisions.”86 The FTC can
take action under the FTC Act if a marketer makes an
environmental claim inconsistent with the guides. The
FTC and courts employ a “reasonable consumer test”
to determine how fair-minded consumers in a general
audience are likely to interpret certain claims.87 Whether
a particular claim is deceptive will depend on the net
impression of the advertisement, label, or other promotional
material at issue. The FTC states that “A representation,
omission, or practice is deceptive if it is likely to mislead
consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances
and is material to consumers’ decisions.”

The key requirements of the Green Guides related to
“recyclable” claims and labels on products are summarized in
this section.

1.  Substantiation of Marketing Claims Must Be Made

Before Claims are Made (16 CFR 260.2)
The Green Guides require that “Marketers must ensure
that their claims are supported by a reasonable basis
before	they	make	claims.	A	reasonable	basis	often	requires
reliable	scientific	evidence.	Such	evidence	consists	of
analyses and research that have been evaluated in an
objective manner.”

2.  “Recyclable” Claims Require Established Programs
for Collection, Separation and Recovery for Use in
Manufacturing Another Item (260.12a)
The FTC requires existing programs to collect, separate
and use the product in manufacturing another product.
Material recovery facilities perform the collection and
sortation function. Plastic recycling facilities reprocess
the collected materials into plastic resin for use in
manufacturing another product. Therefore, existing
programs run by municipalities to collect and sort items
at	a	MRF	alone	are	insufficient	to	meet	the	“recycling”
requirement. There must also be recycling/reprocessing
capacity for the plastic item to turn it into resin that can be
used by manufacturers.

§ 260.12  Recyclable claims.

(a) It is deceptive to misrepresent, directly or by
implication, that a product or package is recyclable. A
product or package should not be marketed as recyclable
unless it can be collected, separated, or otherwise
recovered from the waste stream through an established
recycling program for reuse or use in manufacturing or
assembling another item.

Figure 2. FTC Green Guides 16 CFR 260.12a

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FA LL FLAT  |  15

3.  At Least 60% of Americans Must Have Access to Recycling
Facilities for a Product to be Labeled as “Recyclable”
(260.12b1)
To legitimately claim a product as “recyclable,” the
FTC requires that recycling facilities be available to a
“substantial	majority”	of	Americans,	defined	to	be	at	least
60 percent. The FTC states that “Marketers should qualify
all recyclable claims for products that do not meet the 60
percent facility availability threshold. The lower the levels
of access to appropriate facilities. The more strongly the
marketer should emphasize the limited availability of
recycling for the product.”88

(b) Marketers should clearly and prominently qualify

recyclable claims to the extent necessary to avoid
deception about the availability of recycling programs
and collection sites to consumers.

(1) When recycling facilities are available to a
substantial majority of consumers or communities
where the item is sold, marketers can make unqualified
recyclable claims. The term ‘‘substantial majority,’’ as
used in this context, means at least 60 percent.

Figure 3. FTC Green Guides 16 CFR 260.12b1

4.  “Qualified” Recycling Claims May be Made for Limited

Recycling Access (260.12b2)
The FTC requires that when recycling facilities are
available to less than a substantial majority of consumers
or communities where the item is sold, marketers should
qualify	all	recyclable	claims.	“Qualified”	allows	use	of
the recyclable symbol but requires additional wording
describing the limitations. The lower level the access, the
more limitation text required.

(2) When recycling facilities are available to
less than a substantial majority of consumers or
communities where the item is sold, marketers should
qualify all recyclable claims. Marketers may always
qualify recyclable claims by stating the percentage of
consumers or communities that have access to facilities
that recycle the item. Alternatively, marketers may
use qualifications that vary in strength depending on
facility availability. The lower the level of access to an
appropriate facility is, the more strongly the marketer
should emphasize the limited availability of recycling
for the product. For example, if recycling facilities are
available to slightly less than a substantial majority
of consumers or communities where the item is sold,
a marketer may qualify a recyclable claim by stating:
‘‘This product [package] may not be recyclable in your

area,’’ or ‘‘Recycling facilities for this product [package]
may not exist in your area.’’ If recycling facilities are
available only to a few consumers, marketers should use
stronger clarifications. For example, a marketer in this
situation may qualify its recyclable claim by stating:
‘‘This product [package] is recyclable only in the few
communities that have appropriate recycling facilities.’’

Figure 4. FTC Green Guides 16 CFR 260.12b2

5.  “Check Locally” Not Allowed by the FTC (260.12b2

Example 4)
The use of a label with the instruction to consumers to
simply “Check Locally” is not approved in the FTC Green
Guides. In an example in the Green Guides, the FTC states:
“A paperboard package is marketed nationally and labeled
either ‘‘Recyclable where facilities exist’’ or ‘‘Recyclable:
Check to see if recycling facilities exist in your area.’’
Recycling programs for these packages are available
to some consumers, but not available to a substantial
majority of consumers nationwide. Both claims are
deceptive because they do not adequately disclose the
limited availability of recycling programs.”

6.  Products Cannot be Labeled Recyclable if they have
a Component that Significantly Limits the Ability to
Recycle the Item (260.12c,d)
The FTC does not allow a product to be labeled
“recyclable” if it contains a non-incidental component
that “limits the ability to recycle the item.” As described in
Section 10, full body shrink sleeves on plastic containers
often	make	the	product	not	sortable	in	a	MRF	or	non-
recyclable by plastics reprocessors.

The FTC Green Guides make no allowance for requiring
customers	to	cut	off	labels	or	separate	major	components
of an item.

(c) Marketers can make unqualified recyclable claims
for a product or package if the entire product or package,
excluding minor incidental components, is recyclable.
For items that are partially made of recyclable
components, marketers should clearly and prominently
qualify the recyclable claim to avoid deception about
which portions are recyclable.

(d) If any component significantly limits the ability

to recycle the item, any recyclable claim would be
deceptive. An item that is made from recyclable
material, but, because of its shape, size, or some other
attribute, is not accepted in recycling programs, should
not be marketed as recyclable.48

Figure 5. FTC Green Guides 16 CFR 260.12c,d

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FA LL FLAT  |  16

7.  Incineration is Not Recycling (260.12d)

In an example, the FTC states: “A container can be burned
in incinerator facilities to produce heat and power. It
cannot, however, be recycled into another product or
package. Any claim that the container is recyclable would
be deceptive.”

The FTC Green Guides make no allowance for collecting a
waste as a “recyclable” material when the end fate of the
material is destruction through burning (e.g. via sales to
a cement kiln to burn for energy) or combustion (e.g. via
pyrolysis to fuel that will then be combusted in vehicles).

8.  FTC Requires the Collected Items Be Recycled
In the FTC Green Guides Statement of Basis and
Purpose section titled “Packages Collected for Public
Policy Reasons but Not Recycled,” the FTC states: “The
Commission	agrees	that	unqualified	recyclable	claims
for categories of products that municipal recycling
programs collect, but do not actually recycle, may be
deceptive.	To	make	a	non-deceptive	unqualified	claim,	a
marketer should substantiate that a substantial majority
of consumers or communities have access to facilities that
will actually recycle, not accept and ultimately discard,
the product. As part of this analysis, a marketer should not
assume that consumers or communities have access to a

particular recycling program merely because the program
will accept a product.” 89

This FTC requirement puts the burden of proof on product
companies to substantiate that MRFs that are accepting
their recyclable-labeled products are selling plastic bales
to	reprocessors	that	are	verifiably	recycling	the	plastic
bales into resin for manufacturing into new products.

6.2 Deceptive Recyclable Claim Case:
Keurig Plastic Coffee Pods
In	September	2018,	a	class	action	lawsuit	was	filed	by	an
individual consumer in California against Keurig Green
Mountain, Inc., (“Keurig”) over recyclability claims and labels
on their single use beverage plastic pod products.90 As shown
in	Figure	6,	the	plaintiff	alleged	that	Keurig’s	“recyclable”
single-serve	plastic	coffee	pods	were	mislabeled	as	such
because they are not in fact recyclable, due to their size,
composition, and the lack of a market to reuse the pods.

This Complaint seeks to remedy Defendants’ unlawful, unfair and deceptive

business practices with respect to the advertising, marketing and sales of plastic single serve pods

that contain coffee and that are labeled as “recyclable” (the “Products”).1  The Products are

advertised, marketed and sold as recyclable. However, even if consumers take the many steps

required to place the Products in their recycling bins, they are not in fact recyclable because most

 21  municipal recycling facilities are not properly equipped to capture such small materials.

 22

 23

Furthermore, even where such facilities exist that are capable of segregating the Products from

the general waste stream, the Products usually still end up in landfills anyway as there is no

 24  market to recycle the Products.

Figure 6 – Deceptive Complaint in Smith vs. Keurig Class Action Lawsuit (September 28, 2018)91

In June 2019, the District Court denied Keurig’s motion to
dismiss the case.92 Table 3 summarizes the key points in
the District Court’s decision and relevance to general issues
of product labeling. In October 2019, the case moved to
Discovery phase.93

Table 3: Key Points in the District Court’s decision94

U.S. Federal District Court Ruling

Relevance to Product Labeling

III.A.2	Plaintiff	does	not	allege	that	she	was	injured	by	her	inability	to
recycle	the	Pods,	but	rather	that	she	suffered	economic	injury	due	to
Defendant’s mislabeling because she paid more than she would have
paid had she known the Pods were not recyclable. The complaint
here adequately alleges both materiality and that the mislabeling
altered Plaintiff’s course of action.

III.A.1: The complaint alleges that the disputed Pods are not
recyclable at any MRF. If that is true, a “check locally” disclaimer
could be misleading, as the disclaimer would falsely lead customers
to believe that there was any point in “checking locally.”

This	judgement	indicates	that	(1)	labels	on	products	affect	consumer
purchasing decisions and (2) incorrect labels can cause economic
injury.

This judgement indicates that it is deceptive to instruct consumers to
“check locally” if the consumer cannot determine if a plastic item will
actually	be	recycled	after	collection	by	a	MRF.

III.A.3:	Keurig	wrongly	assumes	that	Plaintiff’s	injury	is	merely	the
inability	to	recycle.	However,	Plaintiff’s	alleged	injury	is	not	that	she
was unable to recycle the Pods, but instead that she was misled to
believe they were recyclable due to Defendant’s mislabeling.

This judgement indicates that the harm to consumers is in labeling
of product and the fault resides with the product manufacturer.
The inability to recycle a product is not the fault of the municipal
collection/sortation system or plastic recycler/reprocessors.

III.B: The Green Guides state that if a product is rendered non-
recyclable because of its size or components—even if the product’s
composite materials are recyclable—then labeling the product as
recyclable would constitute deceptive marketing. See id. § 260.12(d).

This judgement indicates support for deceptive claims against
bottles with full body shrink sleeve labels that prevent sortation or
harm plastic recycling/reprocessing equipment.

III.B: Defendant further contends that it would be unduly burdensome
to require Keurig to constantly monitor the number of MRFs at which
the Pods are recyclable and revise its labeling accordingly.

This argument by Keurig shows lack of commitment to improving
the recyclability of their products or reducing contamination in
America’s recycling system.

7. Survey of Plastic Waste Collection/
Sortation and Reprocessing: Technical
Approach and Detailed Results

To meet the “recyclable” label threshold required by the
FTC Green Guides, Americans must have access to both
collection/sortation and	recycling/reprocessing	of	a	specific
item into plastic resin that could be used to manufacture
another item. In this comprehensive survey, both types of
facilities were assessed:

1.  Collection and sortation (MRF) facilities: The 367

operating U.S. residential MRFs were surveyed for their
posted	lists	of	specific	types	of	plastic	products	that	are
accepted in their curbside recycling bins.  (Details provided
in Section 7.1 - Survey of U.S. Material Recovery Facilities)95

2.  Plastic reprocessing facilities that turn the collected/

sorted material into plastic resin were surveyed for total
U.S.	processing	capacity	of	specific	types	of	post-consumer
plastics. (Details provided in Section 7.2 - Survey of U.S.
Recycling/Reprocessing Capacity for Post-Consumer
Plastic Waste)

It	is	insufficient	for	Americans	to	have	access	to	collection/
sortation	of	an	item	if	there	is	insufficient	recycling/
reprocessing capacity to produce resin to manufacture/
assemble a new item from the material. Similarly, if there is
sufficient	reprocessing	capacity	but	insufficient	collection/

sortation facilities and operations, then an item may not
reasonably be considered recyclable.

The policies of two U.S. major recycling industry associations,
Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) and the
Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR), agree with the position
that collection alone is not recycling. According to an article
in ISRI’s Scrap magazine, “ISRI has long held that for a
product to be recyclable, it must be both technologically
and economically feasible to recycle.” In the same article,
APR’s President stated, “There must be consumer access to
a recycling program, a recycler must be able to process the
material, and there must be an end market.”96

7.1 Survey of U.S. Material Recovery Facilities

7.1.1 SURVEY METHODOLOGY AND PUBLIC
TRANSPARENCY

A comprehensive, objective survey of acceptance of plastic
items at U.S. Residential MRFs for curbside recycling was
performed	from	October	to	December	2019	and	reverified
in	January	2020.	The	survey	was	performed	and	verified	by
technically	qualified	volunteers	of	The	Last	Beach	Cleanup:97
two registered professional chemical engineers and a
recycling industry expert. The technical experts involved have
no	conflicts	of	interest	related	to	legitimate	recyclable	labels
for	plastic	products	that	would	influence	the	assessment	or
results. The acceptance information was found in the public

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FA LL FLAT  |  18

domain and is publicly shared to promote transparency
and establish a traceable account of facts related to plastic
“recyclable” claims and labels.  The details of the survey
were captured in a spreadsheet that is publicly available
for downloading on The Last Beach Cleanup website. A copy
of the 2020 U.S. MRF Survey spreadsheet version (dated
Februrary  9, 2020) that was the basis for the metrics stated in
this report is provided in Attachment 1 to this document.

Evidence of Disposal of Collected Plastic Materials
News and internet searches were performed to document
evidence	of	disposal	to	landfill	or	incineration	of	collected
plastic materials. The information provided by Waste Dive
in the “How recycling is changing in all 50 states” website
was reviewed.102 A summary of the evidence found is given
in Table 8 and links are also provided in the 2020 U.S. MRF
Survey spreadsheet.

MRF Survey Basis and Verification: A comprehensive listing
of “Commingled Residential MRFs” was published by The
Recycling Partnership in the public domain on their website
in Fall 2019.98 The map provided the names and locations of
approximately 370 MRFs in the U.S. The Recycling Partnership
attributed the data to Resource Recycling, a news source
in the U.S. recycling industry.99 The information in the
Recycling Partnership MRF map was manually extracted and
compiled into the 2020 U.S. MRF Survey spreadsheet. The
operational	status	of	each	MRF	was	verified	through	public
domain searches. Approximately 17 MRF sites were found to
be incorrect because they were duplicate listings, no longer
in operation or no longer Residential MRFs. An additional
15	operating	MRFs	were	identified	through	review	of	waste/
recycle company websites and other information. A list of
corrections was submitted to The Recycling Partnership
on January 23, 2020 with a suggestion that their map be
updated.	The	final	count	of	operating	U.S.	MRFs	surveyed	was
367. Links to MRF information were captured on the 2020 U.S.
MRF Survey spreadsheet. Links to videos about the MRFs were
captured when found.

Survey of Plastic Item Acceptance: A “MRFshed” approach
was employed to survey the acceptance of plastic items by
Americans who have access to curbside recycling. A MRFshed
is	defined	“as	a	group	of	communities	that	funnel	material
into the same materials recycling facility (MRF).”100 Through
web searches, each MRF was investigated for the public
disclosure of items accepted for curbside recycling. About
one-third of the MRFs provided information on acceptance of
plastic items at their facility. When MRF acceptance information
was not found, a search of websites of a local city or county
that	directs	recycling	to	a	specific	MRF	was	performed.	If
information	could	not	be	found	for	the	specific	MRF	or	local
municipality, recycling guidance provided by the MRF owner
(e.g.	Republic	Services’	Recycling	Simplified101 guidelines to
customers) was captured. The acceptance guidance provided
by MRFs and local municipal governments ranged from
complicated “wizard” search tools to easily understandable
text and photos. Where there was inconsistency between
text and photo guidance, all items listed or shown were
considered accepted. This approach was intentionally
conservative to avoid bias.

Evidence of Export of Collected Plastic Materials to
Countries with Poor Waste Management
News and internet searches were performed to document
evidence of export of plastic waste to countries that are not
equipped to safely and securely recycle post-consumer plastic
waste. An analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau database of
plastic waste exports was performed to quantify the amount
of plastic waste shipped by each state in 2019 (through
November) to countries with poor waste management.103 A
summary of the evidence found is given in Table 9 and links
are also provided in the 2020 U.S. MRF Survey spreadsheet.

Survey of Largest U.S. Material Recovery Facilities
In addition to the comprehensive survey of all 367 operating
U.S. Residential MRFs, the 65 largest U.S. MRFs104 were analyzed
to ensure that there wasn’t a bias in the results based on
population access and mass throughput capacity of the
facilities. The acceptance rates by the largest 65 MRFs were
found to be in alignment in acceptance rates of all 367 U.S. MRFs.
Since the largest MRFs are typically better funded than most
MRFs and able to invest in expensive advanced sortation, the
largest MRFs accepted slightly more types of plastics.

Customer “Check Locally” Enquiries to MRFs
Researchers and interested stakeholders involved in the 2020
U.S. MRF Survey found that they were customers of MRFs that
accepted plastics #3-7 in their recycling bins. The researchers
and	stakeholders	called	five	MRFs	and	enquired,	as	legitimate
customers,	about	the	destination	and	final	fate	of	their
plastics #3-7 and non-bottle plastics #1-2 if they put them in
the recycle bin. The MRF representatives could not provide
credible information to their customers on where, how or if
the non-bottle plastics were actually recycled. While this was
a selected sampling, it indicates that few MRFs that accept low
value plastics #3-7 can credibly inform customers, who are
attempting to “check locally” whether the collected plastics
will be processed into new products.

7.1.2 2020 U.S. MRF SURVEY RESULTS

Table 4 summarizes the acceptance of plastic items by
municipal MRF collection and corresponding evidence of
disposal or export of plastic waste by MRFs. MRFs that still
accept non-bottle plastics may be disposing or exporting the
collected low-value mixed plastic waste.

7.2 Survey of U.S. Recycling/Reprocessing
Capacity for Post-Consumer Plastic Waste
Material recycling/reprocessing facilities that process the
collected/sorted material into plastic resin for use in manufac-
turing or assembling another item are required to be “estab-
lished” by the FTC for an item to be labeled as recyclable.
Since	export	markets	are	closing	and	do	not	provide	sufficient
assurance	of	recycling,	sufficient	domestic	recycling/repro-
cessing capacity must exist for the plastic material collected
by the MRFs to be recycled. The plastics industry publishes
limited information on the capacity of U.S. plastic recyclers/
reprocessors	for	specific	types	of	post-consumer	plastic
waste. Estimates of U.S. domestic post-consumer plastic
recycling/reprocessing capacity are made to determine if
sufficient	capacity	exists	to	assure	customers	that	a	plastic
product	has	a	sufficient	likelihood	of	actually	being	recycled

into a new product if it is accepted by a MRF. The estimates are
summarized in Table 5 and detailed in Sections 7.2.1 - 7.2.7.

7.2.1 USEPA 2017 PLASTIC RECYCLING RATES

Recycling rates for plastic items provide a basic indication
of recycling capacity because production rates are a portion
of production capacity. The most recent USEPA recycling
rates (2017) for U.S. post-consumer plastics are summarized
in Table 6.106	The	“recycled”	material	includes	a	significant
amount of exported material. In 2017, 931 million kg of plastic
waste was still sent to China and Hong Kong.107 Since China’s
National Sword restrictions began on January 1, 2018, current
2019-2020 recycle rates are estimated to be lower, particularly
for	plastics	#3-7,	due	to	the	significant	decrease	in	plastic
waste exports.108 Nevertheless, the 2017 data provides an
order-of-magnitude indication of U.S. reprocessing capacity.

7.2.2 2020 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING
CAPACITY FOR POST-CONSUMER POLYETHYLENE
TEREPHTHALATE (PET) PLASTIC #1 WASTE

Available data indicates that the current U.S. domestic
reprocessing capacity for post-consumer PET plastic waste is
approximately 22.5% of the total post-consumer PET plastic
waste generated. This estimate is supported by the 18.2%
recycling rate reported by the USEPA in 2017 and other evidence.
Therefore, there is sufficient likelihood that post-consumer
PET waste collected by MRFs is recycled/reprocessed into
plastic resin for manufacturing of new products in the U.S.
It is reasonable for U.S. consumers to believe that PET bottles
and jugs that are collected by municipal systems will be
recycled/reprocessed into a new product.

Evidence supporting this estimate:

1.  The National Association for PET Container Resources

(NAPCOR) reported that at the end of 2017 there were 22
PET recycling/reprocessing plants operating in the U.S.
with total annual nameplate capacity of 2,255 million
pounds capacity.110

2.  As shown in Table 6, the U.S. produced 5.01 million tons
(10 billion lbs) of PET waste in 2017. Therefore, existing
U.S. domestic capacity for recycling/reprocessing PET
waste is estimated to be about 22.5%.

7.2.3 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING
CAPACITY FOR POST-CONSUMER HIGH DENSITY
POLYETHYLENE (HDPE) PLASTIC #2 WASTE

Available data indicates that the current U.S. domestic
reprocessing capacity for post-consumer HDPE plastic
waste is approximately 12% of the total post-consumer
HDPE plastic waste generated. This estimate is supported
by the 9.4% recycling rate reported by the USEPA in

2017 and other evidence. Therefore, there is moderate
likelihood that post-consumer HDPE waste collected
by MRFs is recycled/reprocessed into plastic resin for
manufacturing of new products in the U.S. It is reasonable
for U.S. consumers to believe that HPDE bottles and jugs
that are collected by municipal systems will be recycled/
reprocessed into a new product.

Evidence supporting this estimate:

1.  The Association of Plastics Recyclers (APR) reported the
total U.S. HDPE postconsumer reclamation capacity was
1,418 million pounds with 25 recycling/reprocessing plants
operating in the U.S.111

2.  As shown in Table 3, the U.S. produced 6.15 million tons

(12.3 billion lbs) of HDPE waste in 2017. Therefore, existing
capacity U.S. domestic capacity for recycling/reprocessing
HDPE waste is estimated to be about 12%.

7.2.4 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING CAPACITY
FOR POST-CONSUMER HIGH POLYVINYL CHLORIDE
(PVC) PLASTIC #3 WASTE

The USEPA data in Table 6 indicates that the current U.S.
domestic reprocessing capacity for post-consumer PVC
plastic waste is negligible. When it is accepted by a MRF,
plastic #3 is typically collected as part of a mixed plastics #3-7
bale. There is negligible value for mixed plastic #3-7 bales
across	the	country	and	the	collected	mixed	plastics	are	often
disposed	to	landfills	or	destroyed	by	incineration.	Therefore,
there is negligible likelihood that post-consumer PVC
waste collected by MRFs is recycled/reprocessed into plastic
resin for manufacturing of new products in the U.S. It is not
reasonable for U.S. consumers to believe that PVC products
that are collected by municipal systems will be recycled/
reprocessed into a new product.

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FA LL FLAT  |  21

7.2.5 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING
CAPACITY FOR POST-CONSUMER LOW DENSITY
POLYETHYLENE (LDPE) PLASTIC #4 WASTE

The USEPA data in Table 6 indicates that the current U.S.
domestic reprocessing capacity for post-consumer LDPE
plastic waste is less than 5%. When it is accepted by a MRF,
plastic #4 is typically collected as part of a mixed plastics #3-7
bale. Therefore, there is low likelihood that post-consumer
LDPE waste collected by MRFs is recycled/reprocessed into
plastic resin for manufacturing of new products in the U.S.
It is not reasonable for U.S. consumers to believe that LDPE
products that are collected by municipal systems will be
recycled/reprocessed into a new product.

7.2.6 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING CAPACITY FOR
POST-CONSUMER POLYPROPYLENE #5 PLASTIC WASTE

Available data indicates that the current U.S. domestic
reprocessing capacity for post-consumer polypropylene plastic
waste is approximately 2-5% of the total post-consumer plastic
waste generated. This conservative estimate is supported by
the low (0.6%) recycling rate reported by the USEPA in 2017
and other evidence. When it is accepted by a MRF, plastic
#5 is typically collected as part of a mixed plastics #3-7
bale. Therefore, there is low likelihood that post-consumer
polypropylene waste collected by MRFs is recycled/reprocessed
into plastic resin for manufacturing of new products in the
U.S. It is not reasonable for U.S. consumers to believe that
polypropylene products that are collected by municipal
systems will be recycled/reprocessed into a new product.

Evidence supporting this estimate:

1.  Polypropylene is reportedly “one of the least recycled
post-consumer plastics, at a rate below 1 percent for
post-consumer recovery.”112

2.  KW Plastics (Alabama) is reported to be the largest

processor of U.S. post-consumer polypropylene plastic
waste. According to Plastics News,113 KW has extrusion
capacity to reprocess 650 million pounds of plastics
a year, split about evenly between polyethylene and
polypropylene. Plastics News also reports that post-
consumer plastics is 87% of KW Plastics reprocessing.
Therefore, KW Plastics capacity for post-consumer
polypropylene plastic waste is estimated to be about
283 million lbs. As shown in Table 6, the U.S. produced
8 million tons (16 billion lbs) of polypropylene waste in
2017. Therefore, KW Plastics has the capacity to process
1.8% of U.S. post-consumer plastic waste.

3.  Assuming that KW Plastics processes about one half of
post-consumer polypropylene plastic waste, the total
current U.S. capacity to recycle/reprocess polypropylene
plastic waste is estimated to be less than 5%.

7.2.7 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING CAPACITY FOR
POST-CONSUMER POLYSTYRENE (PS) PLASTIC #6 WASTE

The USEPA data in Table 6 indicates that the current U.S.
domestic reprocessing capacity for post-consumer polystyrene
plastic waste is less than 1%. When it is accepted by a MRF,
plastic #6 is typically collected as part of a mixed plastics #3-7
bale. Therefore, there is low likelihood that post-consumer
polystyrene waste collected by MRFs is recycled/reprocessed
into plastic resin for manufacturing of new products in the
U.S. It is not reasonable for U.S. consumers to believe that
polystyrene products that are collected by municipal systems
will be recycled/reprocessed into a new product. As an example,
the City of San Antonio still tells citizens to place polystyrene
foam food containers in recycling bins even though the local
MRF can’t recycle it and views it as harmful contamination.114

7.2.7 U.S. DOMESTIC REPROCESSING CAPACITY
FOR PLASTIC #7 WASTE

Plastic waste #7 includes multiple types of plastics “other” than
plastics #1-6, including bio-based plastics such as polylactic
acid (PLA) plastic. The USEPA data in Table 6 indicates that the
current U.S. domestic reprocessing capacity for “other” plastic
waste is negligible. When it is accepted by a MRF, plastic #7
is typically collected as part of a mixed plastics #3-7 bale.
Therefore, there is negligible likelihood that post-consumer
plastic #7 waste collected by MRFs is recycled/reprocessed
into plastic resin for manufacturing of new products in the
U.S. It is not reasonable for U.S. consumers to believe that
plastic #7 products that are collected by municipal systems
will be recycled/reprocessed into a new product.

7.3 Current U.S. Access to Municipal
Collection and Sortation
To legitimately claim a product as “recyclable”, the FTC
requires that recycling facilities be available to a “substantial
majority”	of	Americans,	defined	to	be	at	least	60	percent.	The
FTC focuses on “community-based” recycling systems, rather
than privately operated mail-back or retail store take-back
programs, in determining recycling availability.

The SPC 2015/2016 Centralized Study on Availability of
Recycling employed three levels of access to municipal
collection to determine availability of recycling for plastic
products: automatic curbside collection, opt-in or subscription
curbside	collection	and	drop-off	collection	centers.115

In the four years since the 2015/2016 study was performed,
many U.S. communities have reduced or eliminated municipal
recycling	services	offered	to	residents,	as	documented	by	Waste
Dive’s website “How recycling has changed in all 50 states.”116
Table 7 provides an updated estimation of Americans’ access
to collection services for recycling in 2020. The 2020 estimation
basis is shown and described below the table.

Automatic Access to Curbside Collection Systems:

Automatic access to curbside collection refers to collection
provided at a residence or apartment complex as a part of
municipal waste collection that is trucked to a MRF. The
2015/2016 SPC Report estimated that 53% of Americans
had this type of access to recycling.118 Due to the decline in
commodity value and increase in service fees charged, the
number of municipalities providing curbside collection has
declined over the past four years.

For the purpose of this 2020 assessment, a decline of 5% in
automatic access to curbside collection sites was estimated
based on news reports from across the country.

Opt-In/Subscription Collection Systems:

According to SPC, “an opt-in program is one provided by a
community or its contractor in which residents must sign up
and, in some cases, pay an additional fee to participate in
recycling” and 20% of Americans had access to this type of
collection in 2015/2016.119

The number of opt-in/subscription service contracts has
fallen over the past four years, as documented by Waste Dive’s
website “How recycling has changed in all 50 states.”120 Opt-
in/subscription service contracts have dramatically risen in
cost due to the decline of all materials commodity values.121
For the purpose of this 2020 assessment, a decline of 10% in
opt-in/subscription service contracts was estimated.

Opt-in/subscription collection systems are more selective
on the items accepted than MRFs. Opt-in/subscription want

valuable PET and HDPE bottles and jugs because they are
most easily baled and sold to domestic buyers. For the
purpose of this 2020 assessment, it was estimated that 10%
of opt-in/subscription service contractors accept PP#5 tubs
and containers to bale and sell to recyclers/reprocessors.

Drop Off Collection Systems:

According	to	SPC,	“drop-off	recycling	refers	to	a	program
where residents bring recyclables to a collection point away
from their residence” and 21% of Americans had access to
this type of collection in 2015/2016. The number of drop-
off	collection	sites	has	also	fallen	over	the	past	few	years.
Drop-off	collection	sites	are	commonly	located	in	rural	areas,
often	run	by	volunteers	and	have	struggled	to	survive	due
to the decline of all materials commodity values.122 For the
purpose	of	this	2020	assessment,	a	decline	of	10%	in	drop-off
collection sites was estimated.

Drop-off	collection	systems	are	more	selective	on	the	items
accepted.	Drop-off	collection	systems	want	valuable	PET	and
HDPE bottles and jugs because they are most easily baled
and sold to domestic buyers. For example, the two collection
sites in Albany, Georgia, accept “only plastic soda bottles and
clear milk jugs.”123 In Norman, Oklahoma acceptance policy
was changed to plastic bottles and jugs only due to the lack of
market demand for plastics #3-7.124 In Thomas, West Virginia,
the	drop-off	centers	now	do	not	accept	any	type	of	plastic.125
For the purpose of this 2020 assessment, it was estimated that
10%	of	drop-off	sites	accepted	PP#5	tubs	and	containers	to
sell to recyclers/reprocessors.

8. Evidence of Collected Plastic
Disposal and Export to Countries
with Poor Waste Management

Extensive evidence of collected plastics waste being
disposed or exported to countries with poor waste
management was found during the U.S. MRF Survey.
This evidence shows that consumers cannot “Check
Locally” to determine if an item accepted for collection
by a MRF will be bought by a recycler/reprocessor to be
manufactured into a new product.

The detailed survey of U.S. MRF’s acceptance of plastic
items revealed:

a.  Table 7: While some MRFs still accept plastics #3-7 and

non-bottle plastics #1 & 2, there is extensive evidence that
collected	plastics	are	being	landfilled	or	incinerated	due	to
lack of market demand.

b.  Table 8: Some MRFs that accept plastics #3-7 and non-

bottle plastics #1 & 2s are known to export plastic waste
outside of North America to countries with poor waste
management	without	verification	that	the	plastic	will
actually be recycled into a new product.

While there is strong evidence that exported plastic wastes are
not	all	recycled	but	are	often	dumped	or	burned	in	receiving
countries, many U.S states continue to export plastic waste to
countries with poor waste management.126 Figure 7 shows the
largest state exporters of plastic waste to countries with poor
waste management in 2019.

9. Evidence of
Negligible Value of
Plastic #3-7 Waste

The	financial	value	of	collected
plastic waste drives a MRF to
decide whether to accept it for
collection in municipal systems.
According to industry website
recyclemoreplastic.org, the
nationwide value of plastic
“3-7 Bottles and Other Small
Rigid Plastic” was $0.003 per
pound in December 2019.223 This
negligible	value	is	an	insufficient
economic driver for MRFs to
collect and sort this type of plastic.
RecyclingMarkets.net reports
negative values of commingled
plastics #3-7 in several regions
of the country in January 2020,
including	the	Pacific	Northwest,
Southwest and Southeast U.S.224
When materials have negative
value, the MRF must pay for the
bales to be taken away.

Table 10 summarizes evidence of
negligible value of plastics #3-7
and non-bottles plastics #1-2 found
across the country.

10. Evidence of Shrink Sleeves and
Deceptive Labeling

Many product companies are increasingly using full body
shrink sleeve labels on plastic bottles to improve shelf
appeal and increase sales. Commonly used polyethylene
terephthalate glycol (PETG) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
shrink sleeves are known to prevent proper sortation of the

bottles in MRFs and harm operations of PET bottle recyclers/
reprocessors.253 Yet product companies continue to employ
these types of shrink sleeves. The product companies are
evidently aware that the shrink sleeves they use prohibit
proper sortation and harm recycling of the plastic bottles
because they place instructions on the bottles telling
consumers to remove the shrink sleeves. One example is
provided in Figure 8.

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FA LL FLAT  |  28

Figure 8: Expanded Image of Full Body Shrink Sleeve Label on
HDPE #2 Bottle

This labeling practice is not compliant with the FTC Green
Guides and is deceptive in two ways:

1.  The FTC requires that components of a product cannot
limit the recyclability of the product.  FTC Green Guides
16	CFR	260.12d	states:	“If	any	component	significantly
limits the ability to recycle the item, any recyclable claim
would be deceptive. An item that is made from recyclable
material, but, because of its shape, size, or some other
attribute, is not accepted in recycling programs, should not
be marketed as recyclable.”254

2.  The FTC Green Guides does not allow for a company to
instruct a consumer to remove an integral component
to make a product recyclable.

To become compliant with FTC Green Guides requirements,
product companies must change to labels that do not harm
sortation and plastic recycling/reprocessing and do not
require removal by customers. Alternative, non-harmful labels
are commercially available.255

10.1 Harms Caused by Full Body Shrink Sleeves
Several types of full body shrink sleeves on PET #1 and HDPE
#2 bottles make them not sortable by optical scanners at
MRFs. When the bottles are not correctly sorted, they may
contaminate another material stream or be lost to the waste
“residuals” stream.

PETG and PVC shrink sleeves are harmful to PET bottle
recyclers because the PETG and PVC shrink sleeves cannot be
separated	in	mechanical	recycling	water	“sink-float”	tanks.
PETG	and	PVC	materials	have	a	specific	gravity	greater	than
one, so they sink along with PET (1.38 sp. gr.) in the tank. But

the PETG and PVC labels have a lower melting point than PET.
When	the	combined	flake	mixture	is	melted	to	form	resin,
the	PETG	or	PVC	melts	first,	causes	clumps	and	harms	PET
drying equipment. Experts report that shrink sleeve labels can
also	bleed	ink	into	wash	water	and	stain	flakes,	reducing	the
quality of the recycled plastic.256 Mechanical de-labelers are
expensive	and	not	effective.	The	PETG	and	PVC	shrink	sleeve
label contamination causes material yield loss. In the 2018
United States National Postconsumer Plastic Bottle Recycling
Report,	sleeve	labels	on	PET	bottles	were	identified	as	a	cause
of poor bale yields.257

10.2 Recycling and Retail Industry
Design Guidelines
Use of full body shrink sleeves is prohibited in the Design®
Guides published by the Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR)
and Walmart for recyclable plastic products. APR and other
recycling organizations have clearly communicated to product
designers that certain types of full body shrink sleeves should
not be employed on products, yet many companies ignore
the guidance and put the burden on consumers to remove the
shrink sleeve.

Plastic recyclers and the world’s largest retailer agree that
full shrink sleeve labels cause sortation and recycling/
reprocessing of plastic bottles:

1.  The Association of Plastic Recyclers (APR) Design®

Guide for Plastics Recyclability258

APR publishes a design guide to “help package design
engineers at consumer brand companies and converters
create packaging that is fully compatible with plastics
recycling systems in North America.” APR notes that
contamination in the recycling stream by poor package
design impacts recyclers and the brands themselves.

The	APR	Design®	Guide	provides	detailed	specifications
to plastic product manufacturers, including requirements
for label coverage and materials. In several 2019 public
webinars, APR provided design guidance to product
companies.259 Figure 9 shows the APR guidance that labels
on bottles exceeding 85% side coverage may cause the
item to be sorted incorrectly. Figure 10 states that PETG
sleeve	labels	impact	the	quality	and	efficiency	of	the	PET
recycling process.

CIRCULAR CLAIMS FA LL FLAT  |  29

Figure 9: Not Recyclable Guidance by APR on Label Coverage260

Figure 10: Problematic Design Components on PET Packaging261

2.  Walmart’s Packaging Design Guidelines

Walmart’s “The Recycling Playbook” provides guidance
for designing PET #1 and HDPE #2 bottles and jugs for
recyclability. As shown in Figures 11 and 12 below, Walmart

instructs product manufacturers to not employ PETG labels
on PET bottles and restrict shrink sleeve labels to 60%
coverage on both types of bottles.262

3.  ASTRX Material Flow Study263 (ASTRX is an initiative
of The Recycling Partnership and the Sustainable
Packaging Coalition)264

In 2019, Applying Systems Thinking to Recycling (ASTRX)
collected	information	on	material	flows	by	interviewing
MRFs that sort recyclable materials and recyclers/
reprocessors that aggregate and convert materials.
“The objective was to learn whether there are packaging
types,	materials	or	contaminants	that	present	significant
challenges	for	MRFs	and	the	different	material-type
reprocessors,	where	specifically	within	the	system	they
cause problems, and why.”265 Full body shrink sleeves

were	identified	as	a	top	problem	to	both	MRFs	and	plastic
recyclers/reprocessors. In MRFs, full shrink sleeves were
reported to cause sortation issues and degradation
of value of PET and HDPE bales. Plastic recyclers/
reprocessors reported that full shrink sleeve are causing
“contamination in plastic bales that decreases bale yield;
operational issues with de-labeler equipment requiring
a lot of maintenance; sortation issues: the sorter sees the
label and thinks it’s opaque and rejects the bottle.”
