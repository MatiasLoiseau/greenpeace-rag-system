I.

Introduction.

1.

The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the Export-Import

Bank of the United States (ExIm) are federal agencies that provide insurance, loans, and

loan guarantees for overseas projects or to U.S. companies that invest in overseas projects.

2.

Each year OPIC and ExIm provide loans, insurance, or other assistance for

fossil fuel projects including extraction projects (oil and gas fields) and transportation

projects (pipelines), processing and refining facilities and power plants (collectively “OPIC

and ExIm programs and projects”) that will result in the annual emission of billions of tons

of greenhouse gases (primarily, carbon dioxide) – emissions equivalent to almost two-thirds

of U.S. annual domestic carbon dioxide emissions.

3.

Carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming, also known as climate

change.  Emissions from OPIC and ExIm programs and projects contribute significantly to

climate change.  Climate change is already having, and will continue to have, significant

adverse impacts on the environment in the United States.   The Bush administration’s recent

U.S. Climate Action Report – 2002, prepared under the United Nations Framework

Convention on Climate Change, acknowledges that climate change is, in fact, occurring, that

carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion is its leading cause, and that climate

change will cause severe socio-economic disruption and significant adverse environmental

impacts.

4.

The vast majority of the fossil fuels (oil and gas) that are extracted and

transported through OPIC and ExIm programs and projects are bound for international

markets including the United States and Europe.   Although much of these fossil fuels are

consumed in the United States, the impacts to the United States occur regardless of where

the fossil fuel is actually burned.  The Bush Administration recently recognized that “in

addition to internal impacts, the United States is likely to be affected, both directly and

indirectly, by the potential consequences of climate change on the rest of world.”

5.

OPIC’s and ExIm’s decisions to assist these projects are made within the

United States and adversely affect the environment of the United States.  Indeed, in its

October 2000 climate report entitled "Climate Change: Assessing Our Actions," OPIC

acknowledged that it plays a role in causing emissions of CO2 and stated that:

Current forecasts indicate that, unless effective international
efforts to reduce CO2 emissions are adopted, atmospheric CO2
concentrations could reach twice the pre-industrial level by
2060, with an associated average global temperature increase
of 2 to 6.5 degrees F. by 2100. Even the low end of this
estimate would be an unprecedented rate of warming and
may alter patterns of precipitation and evaporation and lead
to more severe weather, rising sea levels and potentially
adverse economic, ecological and human health impacts.

6.

OPIC’s and ExIm’s decisions to take action to assist these projects are made

without complying with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

7.

NEPA requires all federal agencies to conduct an environmental review of

programs and project-specific decisions having a significant effect on the environment.  42

U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).  This review requires all federal agencies to question first if an action

will significantly affect the environment by performing an Environmental Assessment (EA)

and if the answer is affirmative, to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)

detailing the effects and options for alternative actions.  NEPA also requires preparation of

an EIS to evaluate a program or group of concerted actions that implement an agency policy

that has a significant effect on the environment.

8.

This suit seeks to require OPIC and ExIm to comply with NEPA.

II.

Jurisdiction and Venue.

9.

Jurisdiction of this action is based on 28 U.S.C. §1331 (federal question

jurisdiction), 28 U.S.C. §1361 (mandamus), 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202 (declaratory and further

relief), and 5 U.S.C. §701 et seq. (APA).  Plaintiffs claim that defendants have not and are not

acting in accordance with the law.  5 U.S.C. § 706.

10.

Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(e)

because this is an action against an agency of the United States and at least one plaintiff

resides in this district.

III.

Parties.

11.

Friends of the Earth, Inc. ("FoE") is an environmental advocacy organization

founded in 1969 and incorporated in the District of Columbia.  FoE has offices in

Washington, D.C., Burlington, Vermont, and Seattle, Washington with approximately 20,000

members across the nation.  FoE’s mission is to protect the planet from environmental

degradation; preserve biological, cultural and ethnic diversity, and to empower citizens to

affect the quality of their environment and their lives.  One of FoE's programs is to use the

discipline of economics to encourage better stewardship of natural resources, including

reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and controlling climate change.

12.

Greenpeace, Inc. (“Greenpeace”) is a California non-profit corporation with

offices in San Francisco and Washington, D.C.  Greenpeace is a non-violent environmental

organization.  Its mission is to raise public awareness of environmental problems and

promote changes that are essential to a green and peaceful future.  There are approximately

250,000 current Greenpeace members in the United States.  For more than a decade

Greenpeace has been the lead international advocacy organization working to raise

awareness of global warming, and to pressure for serious cuts in greenhouse gas emissions

through local, national and global action. In the United States, Greenpeace has run

campaigns, using tactics from lobbying to litigation to mass mobilizations and direct actions,

in order to pressure government and corporate actors to stop global warming by phasing out

fossil fuel use and promoting renewable energy systems.

 IV.

Statutory Framework.

A.

NEPA.

22.

NEPA requires all federal agencies to identify and consider the

environmental impacts and to consider alternatives and mitigating measures that will avoid

or reduce such impacts before taking action to implement a program or assisting or

approving a project that may significantly affect the environment.  To these ends, Section

102(2)(C) of the Act declares:

The Congress authorizes and directs that, to the fullest extent possible . . . (2)
all agencies of the Federal Government shall – . . . (C) include in every
recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,
a detailed statement by the responsible official on – (i) the environmental
impact of the proposed action . . . .”

42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).

23.

This mandate is intended to inject environmental considerations into the

federal agency’s decision-making process and to inform the public that the agency considered

environmental concerns in its decision-making process.

24.

“The phrase ‘to the fullest

extent possible’ in section 102 means that

each agency of the Federal Government shall comply with that section unless existing law

applicable to the agency’s operations expressly prohibits or makes compliance impossible.”

40 C.F.R. § 1500.6.

25.

NEPA also created the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”), which has

issued regulations guiding agencies’ compliance with NEPA.  42 U.S.C. §4341 et seq.; 40

C.F.R. Part 1500.  These regulations clearly define what constitutes agency action and the

process for determining whether the action or program significantly affects the quality of the

human environment.

26.

CEQ regulations provide that an agency’s adoption of a program or approval

of a group of concerted actions to implement a specific policy or executive directive is a major

federal action.  The agency must, in compliance with NEPA, determine whether such actions

may have significant impact on the human environment, and if so, prepare a programmatic

EIS.  40 C.F.R. §1508.18(b).

27.

CEQ regulations mandate that “while work on a required program

environmental impact statement is in progress and the action is not covered by an existing

program statement, agencies shall not undertake in the interim any major Federal action

covered by the program which may significantly affect the quality of the human

environment.”  40 C.F.R. § 1506.1 (c).  This regulation goes on to allow limited exceptions,

none of which would apply to this matter.

28.

CEQ regulations also provide that an agency’s decision to provide federal

assistance to a specific project is a major federal action.  The agency must, in compliance

with NEPA, determine whether such actions may have a significant impact on the human

environment, and if so, prepare an EIS.  Id.

29.

CEQ regulations require that an EA be prepared to determine whether a

program or other action may significantly affect the environment.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1501.3,

1501.4, 1508.9.

30.

In preparing an EA or EIS, an agency must consider direct and indirect, and

cumulative impacts.  See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.16, 1508.8, 1508.9, 1508.27.    “Cumulative

impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of a

project when added to other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions

regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions.”

40 C.F.R. § 1508.8.  Indirect impacts are those caused by the action and are later in time or

farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.

31.

An EA or EIS must also discuss environmentally sounder alternatives to the

program or project -- including a “no-action” alternative -- and mitigation of any

environmental impacts.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.14, 1508.9; 1502.16.

32.

CEQ regulations mandate that every agency comply with NEPA “unless

existing law applicable to the agency’s operations expressly prohibits or makes compliance

impossible.”  40 C.F.R. § 1500.6.

B.

OPIC and ExIm’s environmental mandates.

33.

No statute exempts either ExIm or OPIC from complying with NEPA.  To the

contrary, ExIm’s rules require NEPA compliance when “a transaction may significantly

affect the quality of the human environment in the United States, its territories or

possessions.”  12 C.F.R. § 408.4(b)(1).

34.    OPIC’s enabling authority complements and dovetails with  NEPA.    OPIC’s

enabling statute, 22 U.S.C. § 2199(g) mandates that “the requirements of 22 U.S.C. §

2151p(c) relating to environmental impact statements and environmental assessments shall

apply to any investment which the corporation insures, reinsures, guarantees, or finances

under this subpart [IV, the provisions governing OPIC] in connection with a project in a

country.”

Section 2151p(c), in turn, requires the administration to “take fully into

account the impact of such programs and projects upon the environment and natural

resources of developing countries.”

36.

In addition to requiring OPIC to assess environmental impacts abroad,

section 2151p(c)(1)(A) requires OPIC

to prepare and take fully into account an environmental impact
statement for any program or project under this part [I] and part
X of this subchapter significantly affecting the environment of the
global commons outside the jurisdiction of any country, the
environment of the United States, or other aspects of the
environment which the President may specify.

22 U.S.C. § 2151p(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).

37.

The Foreign Assistance Act requires OPIC to “[r]efuse to insure, reinsure,

guarantee, or finance any investment in connection with a project which the Corporation

determines will pose an unreasonable or major environmental, health, or safety hazard, or

will result in the significant degradation of national parks or similar protected areas.”  22

U.S.C. § 2191(k)(1).

38.

These provisions are not a prohibition, nor do they make compliance with

NEPA impossible.  40 C.F.R. § 1500.6.  These provisions do not alter or conflict with NEPA’s

mandate that federal agencies consider domestic environmental impacts before taking any

action, nor do they alter NEPA’s mandate to consider the environmental impacts of decisions

made in this country.  To the contrary, these provisions assure OPIC’s and ExIm’s

compliance with NEPA.  There is no exemption to OPIC’s and ExIm’s obligation to comply

with NEPA.

FACTS.

A.

The Impacts of Climate Change on Plaintiffs.

44.

Global warming is causing widespread problems and will cause severe

ecological and socio-economic disruptions, including those described below.  In an effort to

better understand and predict the impacts of climate change, several national governments,

including the United States, formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

(IPCC).  The IPCC was charged with the task of providing the best available base of scientific

information relating to climate change.  The IPCC was also asked to assess the vulnerability

of different regions of the world to the potential impacts of climate change.

45.

IPCC assessments are subjected to comprehensive international peer review.

The IPCC’s Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (“IPCC 2001”)

forms the standard scientific reference for all those concerned with the environmental and

social consequences of climate change.

46.

The IPCC 2001 Report states:

Observational evidence of changes has accumulated in many
physical and biological systems (e.g. glacial melting, shifts in
geographic ranges of plant and animal species, and changes
in plant and animal biology) that are highly consistent with
warming observed in recent decades.  These observations are
adding to our knowledge of the sensitivity of affected systems
to changes in climate and can help us to understand the
vulnerability of systems to the more rapid climate changes
projected for the 21st century.  A number of unique systems
are increasingly recognized as especially vulnerable to climate
change (e.g glaciers, coral reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal
and tropical forests, polar and alpine ecosystems, prairies
wetlands, and remnant native grasslands).  Potential changes
in the frequency, intensity, and persistence of climate
extremes (e.g. heat waves, heavy precipitation, and drought)
and in climate variability (e.g. El Nino Southern Oscillation)
are emerging as key determinants of future impacts and
vulnerability.

47.

The IPCC 2001 report goes

on to conclude that: “Available observational

evidence indicates that regional changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature,

have already affected a diverse set of physical and biological systems in many parts of the

world.”

48.

The Bush Administration’s May, 2002 U.S. Climate Action Report – 2002

Third National Communication of the United States of America Under the United Nations

Framework Convention on Climate Change (“U.S. Report”) also acknowledges the present

and projected impacts of climate change.  The U.S. Report confirms that increased storm

surge height and diminished snow-pack are two of climate change’s several significant

impacts:

natural ecosystems appear to be the most vulnerable to
climate change because generally little can be done to help
them adapt to the projected rate and amount of change.  Sea
level rise at mid-range rates is projected to cause additional
loss of coastal wetlands, particularly in areas where there are
obstructions to landward migration, and put coastal
communities at greater risk of storm surges, especially in the
southeastern United States.  Reduced snow-pack is very
likely to alter the timing and amount of water supplies,
potentially exacerbating water shortages particularly
throughout the western United States, if current water
management practices cannot be successfully altered or
modified.

49.

The U.S. Report acknowledges that:

Not surprisingly, an increased rate of global sea level rise is
likely to have the most dramatic impacts in regions where
subsidence and erosion problems already exist . . . shorelines
along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are especially vulnerable.
Impacts on fixed structures will intensify, even in the absence
of an increase in storminess.  However, because the slope of
these areas is so gentle, even a small rise in sea level can
produce a large shift of the shoreline.  The rise will be
particularly important if the frequency or intensity of storm
surges or hurricanes increases.

The U.S. Report goes on to acknowledge that sea levels have already risen by 10-20 cm over

the last century and predicts that levels will rise by another 9-88 cm during this century.

50.

Likewise, the IPCC 2001

Report states, “the prospect of rising sea

level is one of the most widely recognized potential impacts of climate change.”  It goes on to

state:

Titus and Richman (2001) have developed a data set of
coastal land elevations by using digital-elevation models and
printed topographic maps to determine areas that are
vulnerable to sea-level rise along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf
coasts.  Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and North Carolina
account for more than 80% of the 58,000 km2 that are
vulnerable to sea-level rise.

51.

Other IPCC Reports acknowledge that rising sea level is likely to increase

flooding of low-lying coastal areas and associated human settlements and infrastructure.

“Many islands are at risk.  The low bay sides of developed barrier islands could be inundated

while their relatively high ocean sides erode.”  Regional Impacts of Climate Change, An

Assessment of Vulnerabilty, IPCC (1998)

52.

The IPCC 2001 Report is consistent with the U.S. Report’s conclusions

regarding impacts on snow-pack and water resources.  The IPCC 2001 Report states that:

“Where snowmelt currently is an important part of the hydrological regime . . . seasonal

shifts in runoff are likely, with a larger proportion of runoff occurring in winter, together

with possible reductions in summer flows (high confidence)."

53.

The U.S. Report also predicts “a significant northward shift in prevailing

forest types.  For example, the maple-beech-birch forest type is projected to shift north into

Canada and no longer be dominant in the late 21st century in the northeastern United

States.”  The U.S. Report goes on to predict that climate change is likely to increase the rate

of forest disturbances such as insect infestations, disease or forest fire.

These changes in disturbances regimes are a natural part of
all ecosystems.  However, as a consequence of climate change,
forests may soon be facing more rapid alterations in the
nature of these disturbances.  For example, unless there is a
large increase in precipitation, the seasonal severity of fire
hazard is projected to increase during the 21st century over
much of the country, particularly in the Southeast and Alaska
. . . If the rate and type of disturbances in New England do
smooth transition from the

present maple, beech, and birch tree species to oak and
hickory may occur.  Where the frequency or intensity of
disturbances increases, however, transitions are likely to
occur more rapidly.

54.

The IPCC 2001 Report predicts that insects will be a dominating climate-

change-induced disturbance factor and that climate change already appears to be

accelerating seasonal development of some insects.  Other IPCC reports are also consistent

with the U.S. Report’s predictions regarding shifts in forest ecosystems.  The IPCC also notes

that forests cannot move northward as rapidly as climate is predicted to change and predicts

significant forest decline or dieback.

55.

Such disturbances are already well under way in Alaska.  Rising

temperatures allow spruce bark beetles that eat spruce trees to reproduce at twice their

normal rate.  As a result, a four-million-acre spruce forest on the Kenai Peninsula has been

killed (approximately 38 million dead trees) by the beetles.  This is the largest loss of trees to

insects known to have occurred in North America.  Forests on the Anchorage hillside are also

dead or dying because of the spruce bark beetle.  The dead trees pose a significant fire risk

and ruin the forests’ aesthetic value.

56.

The U.S. Report further details global warming impacts on Alaska:  “Sharp

winter and springtime temperature increases are very likely to cause continued melting of

sea ice and thawing of permafrost, further disrupting ecosystems, infrastructure, and

communities.”  The IPCC 2001 Report states that: “Changes in climate that have already

taken place are manifested in the decrease in extent and thickness of Artic sea ice.”  It also

states that: “Natural systems in polar regions are highly vulnerable to climate change” and

that “climate change in polar regions is expected to be among the largest and most rapid of

any region on the Earth and will cause major physical, ecological, sociological, and economic

57.

The U.S. Report also acknowledges that climate change is contributing to the

decline of coral reefs and that “the demise or continued demise of reefs could have profound

implications for the United States.”  “The last few years have seen unprecedented declines in

the health of coral reefs . . . In some regions, as much as 70% of the coral may have died in a

single season.”

Dr. Phillip Dustan

58.

Dr. Phillip Dustan is a full professor in the Biology Department of the College

of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina.  He is a member of Friends of the Earth.

59.

Dr. Dustan teaches ecology, marine ecology, coral reef ecology.  He also

researches and studies the ecology and physiology of corals and coral reef communities.  Dr.

Dustan also worked as principal scientist on the Calypso on and off from 1974 to 1983.  The

Cousteau Society funded his work on the Calypso.  His research has also been funded by the

National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution and Harbor Branch Foundation,

National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration, and the US Environmental Protection Agency.  In 1995, Dr. Dustan was

asked to be a principal investigator on the USEPA Florida Keys Coral Monitoring Project

(CRMP).

60.

Dr. Dustan started his study of coral reefs in 1969.  Much of his work has

focused on coral reefs off of the Florida Keys.  In 1974, he established long term reef

monitoring sites in the present-day Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary.  This site is the

oldest permanently marked coral reef study site in the Western Atlantic/Caribbean area.  He

is still monitoring that site and has published papers detailing his findings.

61.

This research group documented, between 1996 and 2000, an overall 38% loss

of living coral cover in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary between Key Largo and

Key West and the Carysfort Reef in the northern Florida Keys.  These reefs have lost 75%

coral cover between 1996 and 2000.  Combined with earlier studies dating from 1974, the

Carysfort Reef has lost over 90% of its living coral cover. This reef is in a hastened state of

ecological collapse.

62.

Climate change is a significant factor responsible for this loss of coral.

Climate change harms Dr. Dustan because its effects contribute to diminished opportunities

for fundamental biological research and his ability to pursue his profession.  Dr. Dustan

states that the impacts on coral reefs are “tantamount to going to Sequoia National Forest

and finding every 90 out of 100 trees dead or on the ground.  I cannot keep my head in the

sand and keep studying the pure physiology and evolutionary biology of corals.  I have to

speak up.”

63.

Dr. Dustan’s recreational interests are also harmed by climate change.  He is

a scuba diver.  He has and will continue to scuba dive in reefs affected by climate change

including reefs off of the Florida Keys.  These reefs are no longer healthy.  They are very

small with only few individual colonies.  There are far fewer fish.  His enjoyment of the reefs,

and his ability to share the reefs with family and friends has been diminished.

64.

Dr. Dustan and his family also own land and are building a home on John’s

Island, approximately 10 miles southwest of Charleston, SC.  Their home is being built on

the shore of an estuary known as the Stono River, approximately 5.5 miles from the ocean

and on land eight feet above sea level.

65.

Climate change is causing rising sea levels and increasing storm surge

frequency and heights.  An increase in the severity of hurricanes is also predicted.  Because

of this, Dr. Dustan is building his home higher and stronger than required by current code,

even though the home is over five miles from the ocean.  This is costing him a significant

amount of money.  Additionally, his insurance rates for the new home will increase over

Pam and Jesse Williford.

67.

Pam and Jesse Williford live in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Mrs. Williford

works at home.  Mr. Williford is retired from a career with IBM and now teaches math at

Wake Technical Community College.   Mr. and Mrs. Williford are members of Greenpeace

and Friends of the Earth.

68.

Mr. and Mrs. Williford bought a building lot on Emerald Isle on North

Carolina’s outer banks approximately twenty-five years ago.  They hope to build a home and

retire there within the next couple of years.  The lot is located in the middle of the western

side of the island approximately 1,000 feet from the ocean side of the island.  The lot has an

approximate elevation of five to eleven feet.

69.

Mr. and Mrs. Williford are concerned about the rising ocean levels, increased

storm surge, the increased frequency and severity of storms, and increased erosion resulting

from climate change.  They may not have bought the lot if, twenty-five years ago, they had

known the dangers of climate change.  If the Willifords build, they will have to design and

build their home at substantial additional cost to account for rising ocean levels, the

resulting erosion, increased storm frequency and severity, and storm surge.  The Willifords

are also concerned about Emerald Isle’s vegetation.  The storms and storm surge will

adversely affect the trees and vegetation and the island’s aesthetic value.  Additionally, there

is concern about the effects on the water supply and sewage systems.  Mr. Williford states

that “I did not think that in our lifetime or our kids’ lifetime that a house in the middle of

Emerald Isle would be so affected, but now we know otherwise.”

Arthur Berndt.

 71.

Arthur and Anne Berndt own and operate Maverick Farm in Sharon,

Vermont.  They have owned Maverick Farm since 1988.  They are members of Greeenpeace

and Friends of the Earth.

72.

Maverick Farm is a maple sugarbush on approximately 430 acres owned by

Maverick Farm and an additional 150 acres leased by the Farm.  Maple syrup is produced

from sap drawn from approximately 15,000 – 16,000 sugar maple trees.  Maverick Farm is

one of the largest maple syrup producers in Vermont.

73.

Over the last few years, Mr. Berndt has noticed that the regeneration rate for

the sugar maple trees appears lower, although the trees’ production of seeds has been

unusually and exceedingly heavy.  The seeds sprout but the trees die while they are still

small saplings.  Maple trees produce heavy seed crops when they are stressed.

74.

He has also noticed that the maple-sugaring season starts and ends earlier.

This year, the season started in mid-February.  Generally, the season has advanced two to

three weeks, to well before Town Meeting—the traditional start of the season.  Town Meeting

Day in Vermont is the first Tuesday in March.  He has also noticed that they receive more

rain and less snow during the winter and that swings in the weather are more dramatic and

that low temperatures are now warmer.  Low temperatures below freezing are necessary to

maple syrup production.

75.

Arthur and Anne Berndt plan to continue operating Maverick Farm for at

least the next twenty years.  They will either pass the farm on to their children or conserve

the land when they retire.

76.

However, he understands that, as a result of global warming, there will be a

significant northward shift in the prevailing forest types.  The maple-beech-birch forest type

is projected to shift north into Canada and no longer be dominant in the northeastern United

States by the late 21st century.  The diminished population of sugar maples will cause loss of

syrup production in northern New York and New England.  He also understands that, at

current rates of warming, this shift is likely to occur within the next ten to twenty years, and

possibly sooner if the warming is accompanied by outbreaks of pests or disease.

77.

“We all feel nervous about climate change,” says Arthur Berndt.  “From

greater fluctuations in weather to migration of the maple forest, heavy rains, higher winds,

and more extreme weather, the outlook seems ominous.  If we have no maples we have no

farm income and the aesthetic value of the land will also be devastated.  This would

adversely affect the economic and conservation value of my farm.”

78.

“If climate change will have the predicted impacts, we should start culling

trees now as the timber market will become saturated rather quickly once maples start

disappearing in large numbers.  However, like many people, we are in denial because it is too

depressing to consider the loss of Maverick Farm’s long-term value.”

OPIC’s and ExIm’s actions increase the risk that Arthur Berndt’s interests

are and will continue to be harmed by climate change.

Ms Duchin currently lives in downtown Anchorage and would like to buy a

house on the Anchorage hillside.  However, she is afraid to invest in a home on the

Anchorage hillside because of fire danger.  Global warming is contributing to a spruce bark

beetle outbreak that has decimated the forests of southcentral Alaska.  Many forests and

weather over the last several years also contribute to this fire danger.

82.

The dying spruce trees also harm Ms Duchin’s recreational interests in

southcentral Alaska.  She lives fifteen minutes from hiking trails in the Chugach mountains

which form a perimeter around the south and east sides of Anchorage.  She regularly hikes

and runs in the Chugach Mountains.  She also travels to the Matanuska-Susitna Valley,

Prince William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula several times every summer to visit friends,

hike and run in the mountains, kayak, and sail.  The fire danger in these areas diminishes

her enjoyment of these areas.  Dead and dying spruce are everywhere.  Her wilderness and

recreational activities are diminished by concern and worry about the threat of fire. The dead

and dying forests also have dramatic and adverse impact on Alaska’s aesthetic beauty, also

diminishing her enjoyment of these areas.

83.

Ms Duchin spends time in the Alaskan Arctic for personal recreation.  The

Arctic is her favorite place in the world because of its unique beauty and the distinctive

Arctic species of flora and fauna that live there.  She did a whitewater rafting trip down the

Hula Hula River in June of 2000. The trip started in the Brooks Range and ended at the

Beaufort Sea.  The entire trip was in the Arctic and in environments of permafrost, glacially-

fed rivers and the Beaufort Sea. Each of these environments is affected by global warming.

She intends to continue to travel in the Arctic for recreational purposes, and as such, her

recreational and aesthetic enjoyment will be adversely affected by global warming.  She loves

to bird watch, see mammals such as musk ox, caribou, grizzly bears, wolves, seals, polar

bears, and whales.  It is very important to her that the Arctic environment not melt down,

and that all of its distinctive Arctic species and ecosystems remain intact.  She intends to

return to the Arctic in coming years to pursue her interests.  She is planning an Arctic river

trip for the summer of 2003 and will be on the ice with her dog in the spring of 2003.  She

also intends to return to the artic in the spring/summer of 2004 and subsequent years.

Her Labrador retriever has been trained to track ringed seals for biologists

the Arctic to work with him and a team of biologists conducting research on ringed seals.

The shrinking and receding pack ice makes the Arctic environment more dangerous for her

and her dog. Early spring break-up, early flooding of rivers and unstable ice are hazards that

are linked with and exacerbated by global warming.

OPIC’s and ExIm’s actions increase the risk that Melanie Duchin’s interests

are and will continue to be harmed by climate change.

City of Boulder, Colorado.

86.

Global warming represents a serious threat to Boulder’s natural resources,

economy and its ability to provide drinking water to its customers.

87.

The City of Boulder is extremely vulnerable to the effects of global warming.

Its primary water source for the supply of drinking water to its citizens and other customers

is from mountain snow-pack.  Readings taken the week of April 29th, 2002 showed that

snow-pack at the lower mountain elevations had completely evaporated, a condition never

seen in the many decades of record keeping at this site.  The city's upper snow-pack is at 25

percent of the average readings over the past decades.

88.

According to the US 2002 Climate Action Report, “Rising temperatures are

very likely to affect snowfall and increase snowmelt conditions in much of the western and

northern portions of the country that depend on winter snow-pack for runoff.  This is

particularly important because snow-pack provides a natural reservoir for water storage in

mountainous areas, gradually releasing its water in spring and even summer under current

climate conditions.  Model simulations project that snow-pack in western mountain regions is

likely to decrease as U.S. climate warms.”  It goes on to say the following startling fact:

These reductions are projected, despite an overall increase in
precipitation, because (1) a larger fraction of precipitation will
snow; and (2) the snowpack is

likely to develop later and melt earlier. The resulting changes
in the amount and timing of runoff are very likely to have
significant implications in some basins for water
management, flood protection, power production, water
quality, and the availability of water resources for irrigation,
hydropower, communities, industry, and the sustainability of
natural habitats and species.

89.

Global warming is predicted to increase rainfall intensities in the Boulder

region leading to greater flood frequencies and intensities.

90.

Boulder is particularly vulnerable to flash floods and has the greatest

potential for loss of life from a flash flood of any community in Colorado.  This is due largely

to the city's location at the mouth of Boulder Canyon and the number of people who live and

work in the Boulder Creek floodplain.  Further, drought conditions cause the soil to compact

and reduce its ability to absorb water, thus increasing the risk of flooding should rain occur.

91.

Boulder is presently suffering, and will continue to suffer, these

consequences.

92.

OPIC’s and ExIm’s actions increase the risk that Boulder’s interests are and

will continue to be harmed by climate change.

City of Oakland, California.

93.

Global warming represents a serious threat to Oakland’s natural resources,

economy, the availability of drinking water for its residents and municipal use, and the

health of its residents and employees.

94.

The City of Oakland’s drinking water is provided by the East Bay Municipal

Utility District (EBMUD).  EBMUD’s primary source of drinking water is from the

Mokelumne River Basin, which is dependent on the snow pack of Alpine, Amador, and

Calaveras Counties.  All city facilities, including water for drinking, sanitation, fire

protection, and irrigation are served by EBMUD water.  Any water shortage or price increase

will have a direct adverse impact on Oakland and its fiscal resources.

96.

These projections are entirely consistent with the 2001 Intergovernmental

Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report conclusions for North America that

project more winter rainfall and less snowfall for the Pacific Coast states of North America.

97.

More recent studies confirm that the disappearance or diminution of snow-

pack is creating severe problems for Western cities (including Oakland) that depend directly

or indirectly on snow-pack as their source of drinking water.

98.

Global warming is predicted to increase rainfall intensities in the Oakland

region leading to greater drought and flood frequencies and intensities.  Over the period 1880

- 2000, temperatures monitored at the nearest long-term site to Oakland at Berkeley have

increased by about 2°F.  Over a similar period rainfall has increased 1%.  Climate models

indicate warming of 5°F (range 2 - 9°F) in the winter and summer, and slightly less in spring

and fall.  Precipitation is projected to increase, particularly in winter, with little change in

summer.  The amount of precipitation on extreme wet days is most likely to increase,

especially in winter and fall.  Models show the 1 in 20 year extreme daily rainfall increasing

by 11%, with a decrease in the return period of a 1 in 20 year event to 1 in 10 years for a 5°F

temperature increase.  El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events increase winter rainfall,

and these are expected to become more extreme.

99.

Increased rainstorm intensities would seriously strain the City of Oakland’s

current storm drainage infrastructure. The system is currently operating beyond full

capacity and would require increases in response to emergencies, maintenance and

replacement of much of the current infrastructure in order to meet the additional capacity

demands created by higher intensity rainstorms.  Increase in storm intensities will

exacerbate the damage to storm drainage infrastructure thereby increasing the City's costs

for that damage.  Increased storm intensities and flood frequencies would damage low-lying

City-owned properties.  Increased storm intensities would cause increased erosion and

pollution runoff to Oakland's waterways, Lake Merritt, the Estuary and the Bay.  Increased

and more intense rainfall will also increase soil saturation that, in turn, could lead to

increased frequency of slumping or landslides, affecting City-owned property and

infrastructure.  This impact would also require Oakland to expend funds to clean up, rebuild,

and stabilize City property and infrastructure.

100.  Drought is a great concern for the City of Oakland due to the increased fire

risk that droughts pose.  More frequent and longer duration droughts will increase the risk of

fires in Oakland, which would threaten many properties and endanger lives.   Increased fire

risk increases costs to Oakland and damage to its property and infrastructure.

101.  Higher snowlines resulting from global warming will increase the mountain

rain and decrease mountain snow.  This will lead to increased winter runoff, and in summer,

decreased stream flows into San Francisco Bay area and increased drought.  This will

increase the risk of flooding during winter bringing larger sediment inflows into San

Francisco Bay.  Less freshwater inflow into the Bay in summer will also increase the salinity

altering all levels of the food chain from algae to fish in complex ways.

102.  Oakland is also vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by global warming.

During the 20th century, sea level has risen by about 8 inches in the San Francisco Bay area.

Sea level is projected to rise by between 3.5 and 35 inches between 1990 and 2100.  A twelve-

inch rise in sea level would mean that the current 100-year high tide peak would become

instead the 10-year high, thus a rare event would become common.  ENSO events also

elevate sea levels by up to 12 inches or more off coastal California.  High tides coupled with

ENSO events and storm surges will increase significantly the hourly maximum high tide

peak.

103.

Increased sea levels coupled with increased storm intensities and flood

frequencies will cause increased groundwater elevations in the low laying areas of Oakland.

The increased occurrence of higher sea levels and higher surface runoff would increase the

dispersion of toxic plumes from the soil into the Bay and sensitive marsh and mud flat

habitats.  This would constitute a threat to public health, habitat quality, endangered

species, and would cause significant cost to City for cleanup and related matters.

104.

The Bay Area contains extensive salt marshes, some of which are on Oakland

City property.   Sea level rise is moving the existing salt marshes to nearby lowlands and

freshwater marshes.  This will also affect the groundwater aquifers, and increase the

intrusion of salt water.  The salinity in the Bay will increase, especially in summer

enhancing the risk of salt-water contamination at water supply intakes, and the habitat for

native species.  Sewage systems could be overwhelmed by storm runoff and high tides,

especially in winter.  In particular, the sewage system in the Lake Merritt watershed could

overflow during flood conditions.  Such overflows to the City owned Lake Merritt would

contamination.  Additionally, the Lake serves as a detention basin protecting against a 25-

year flood event.  The increase in frequency of flood events that exceed the current 25-year

event could result in significant economic damage to both public and private property and

business.

105.  Oakland International Airport, built on a former wetland at about 10 feet

above sea level, will be susceptible to flooding from extreme tides coupled with flood

conditions and storm surges.  Oakland International Airport is owned and operated by the

Port of Oakland, a department of the City of Oakland pursuant to section 700 of the Oakland

City Charter.   Other low-lying parts of Oakland not protected from storm surges face

possible inundation.  High intensity rainfall in winter may cause local flooding in the City of

Oakland coupled with sewage system overflows.

106.  Global warming is also having an adverse effect on human health in

Oakland.  In the Bay Area, assuming no other changes in weather or any increase in air

pollution emissions, warming by 7°F would increase ozone concentrations by 20% and almost

double the size of the area not meeting national health standards for air quality, thus

aggravating existing respiratory illness such as asthma, reduce lung function and induce

respiratory inflammation.  Higher temperatures and increased frequency of heat waves may

increase the number of heat-related deaths and the incidence of heat related illness.

107.  Oakland is presently suffering, and will continue to suffer, these

consequences.

108.  OPIC’s and ExIm’s actions increase the risk that Oakland’s interests are and

will continue to be harmed by climate change.

site to Arcata located approximately five miles to the south in the city of Eureka have

increased by about 2.1°F. Annual rainfall amounts have decreased by about 10% over the

period 1857-2000.  Climate models indicate warming of 5°F (range 2 – 9°F) in the winter and

summer, and slightly less in spring and fall. Precipitation is projected to increase,

particularly in winter (possibly up to 25%), with little change in summer.  The amount of

precipitation on extreme wet days is most likely to increase, especially in winter and fall.

Models show the 1 in 20 year extreme daily rainfall increasing by 11%, with a decrease in the

return period of a 1 in 20 year event to 1 in 10 years for a 5°F temperature increase.

110.

Since 1850, sea level has risen by about 4 inches along the coast of California.

Sea level is projected to rise further up to 3.5-35 inches between 1990 and 2100.  A 12-inch

rise in sea level would mean that the current 100-year high tide peak would become instead

the 10-year high, thus a rare event would become common.  El Niño Southern Oscillation

(ENSO) events also elevate sea levels by up to 12 inches or more off coastal California. High

tides coupled with ENSO events and storm surges will increase significantly the hourly

maximum high tide peak.

111.

The City of Arcata owns approximately 170 acres of marsh land, known as

the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary, which serves as wildlife habitat and is an integral

and required component of the City’s adjacently located wastewater treatment facility as it

provides tertiary treatment to all of the City’s wastewater.  This Marsh is located on the

Arcata Bay, the tidelands of which have been legislatively conveyed to ownership by the City

of Arcata.  The Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary and wastewater treatment facility could be

overwhelmed from increased high tide peaks and storm events.  Such flooding would

interfere with and prevent the proper treatment of the City’s wastewater.

112.  Adjacent to the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary, and also fringing the

Arcata Bay, the City of Arcata owns 8 acres on which it has located its only corporation yard.

This corporation yard contains the City’s wastewater treatment facility including chlorine

needed for wastewater treatment, and is the location where the City stores and maintains

the City owned motor vehicle pool as well as the City buses used for the City’s transit

system.  All of this property would be destroyed by increased sea levels, high tide peaks and

storm events.

113.  The City owns nearly 300 acres of low lying agricultural land that is used for

grazing, wildlife habitat, storm water management and open space.  This property would

become salt water marsh and thus unsuitable for agricultural purposes with a sea level

increase of 12 inches and in crease in rainfall intensity.

 114.   With warming, higher snowlines will increase the fraction of precipitation as

rain in the mountain, rather than snow.  This will lead to increased winter runoff, and in

summer decreased stream flows into Arcata coastal area and increased drought.  This will

increase the risk of flooding during winter bringing larger sediment inflows to the Arcata

Bay altering all levels of the food chain from algae to fish in complex ways.  ENSO events

will also increase rainfall amounts in winter and fall, and increase the extremeness of the

rainfall events, resulting in increased flood risk.

115.  Other low-lying parts of Arcata, including public roads, not protected from

storm surges face possible inundation.  High intensity rainfall in winter may cause local

flooding in the City of Arcata, damaging the City’s wastewater and stormwater

infrastructure and causing sewer system overflows. City services including staff time and use

of equipment necessary to correct these infrastructure failures will be extensive.

116.

Increased ocean temperatures may threaten marine wildlife and

consequently human marine activities, in the area. Warmer waters will alter the distribution

of coastal fishes, requiring commercial fishing to travel farther or change to different

fisheries.  California supports the southern-most populations of some salmon and steelhead

species that require cold water.  As waters warm and stream flows fluctuate, these species

could decline drastically or become extinct.

117.

The City of Arcata owns and operates under contract with the California

State University System, Humboldt State University, an anadromous fish aquaculture

facility in the Arcata Bay, which would be impacted by changes in ocean temperature and

toxic algal blooms encouraged by ENSO events.

118.  Arcata is presently suffering, and will continue to suffer, these consequences.

119.  OPIC’s and ExIm’s actions increase the risk that Arcata’s interests are and

will continue to be harmed by climate change.

City of Santa Monica, California

120.  Global warming is predicted to significantly affect Santa Monica’s climate

and weather.  Over the period from 1903 to 2000, annual mean temperatures monitored from

historical climate stations at three sites with reliable records (Santa Barbara, Pasadena and

Newport Beach) have increased by about 2.85°F.  This is a significant increase over the

Santa Monica mean temperature of about 61.5°F.

121.

Climate models indicate warming of 5°F (range 2 – 9°F) in the winter

and summer, and slightly less in spring and fall.

122.

Over the period from 1903-2000, annual rainfall has decreased at

these three sites by 1 inch, a significant decrease for the mean of 12.5 inches.

123.  While reducing overall rainfall, climate change is predicted to increase the

intensity of rainfall.  The IPCC projects precipitation intensity to increase by 2100,

particularly in winter, with little change in summer.  The amount of precipitation on extreme

wet days is most likely to increase, especially in winter and fall.  Models show the 1 in 20

year extreme daily rainfall increasing by 11%, with a decrease in the return period of a 1 in

20 year event to 1 in 10 years based on a 5°F temperature increase.  El Nino/Southern

Oscillation (ENSO) events increase winter rainfall, and these are expected to become more

extreme.  The Los Angeles area has recorded its highest annual rainfall during ENSO years.

124.

Santa Monica is also vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by global

warming.  During the 20th century, sea level has risen by about 3 inches in the Los Angeles

area.  Sea level is projected to rise by between 3.5 and 35 inches between 1990 and 2100.  A

12-inch rise in sea level would mean that the current 100-year high tide peak would become

the 10-year high, thus a rare event will become common.  ENSO events also elevate sea

levels by up to 12 inches or more off coastal California.  High tides coupled with ENSO

events and storm surges will increase significantly the hourly maximum high tide peak.

125.

Santa Monica is an extremely popular destination for tourists worldwide, as

well as from the Los Angeles area.  Despite a population of only 86,000, Santa Monica

attracts 3.8 million visitors per year according to the most recent statistics. These visitors

spend some $788 million annually in Santa Monica. Tourism directly feeds Santa Monica’s

economy through many sources including hotel bed taxes ($18.9 million annually), visitor

sales tax revenue ($5 million), business license taxes, and parking revenue. The tourism

industry in 2000 employed approximately 11,000 people in Santa Monica. Santa Monica and

its unusually moderate weather attract a great number of visitors from throughout Los

Angeles County year-round.

126.

Santa Monica’s primary tourist attractions are its beaches and Pier. The

coastal beaches in Santa Monica are owned by the State of California. The City of Santa

Monica maintains and operates the beaches pursuant to an Operating Agreement with the

State. Santa Monica’s extensive beaches are especially vulnerable to the effects of sea level

rise. Stormy seas coupled with the occasional higher intense rainfall under existing climate

conditions is known to cause accelerated erosion. Increased storm activity,  more ENSO

conditions,  and sea-level rise will cause more beach erosion and loss of sand. It will also

increase the occasions when ocean debris is strewn along the beaches, making the beaches

less desirable for tourists and increasing the City's cleanup costs. It will also cause increased

damage to the beach infrastructure owned by Santa Monica, which includes parking lots,

rest rooms, recreational facilities and a maintenance yard.

127.

The Santa Monica Pier, located on the coast, is a historic landmark owned by

Santa Monica. The Pier is a unique, major year-round center of recreation for local residents

and tourists alike. The Pier is designed based on known risk factors including the predicted

frequency and severity of storms. The increased sea levels, storm intensities, and storm

surges caused by global warming will result in more frequent and severe damage to the Pier

with resultant increased repair and rebuilding costs to Santa Monica as well as decreased

use and appeal as a tourist destination.

128.

Santa Monica’ will be directly harmed by global warming through its effects

on the City’s fisc, weather, beaches and Pier as described above.

129.

Increased rainstorm intensities would seriously strain the City of Santa

Monica’s current storm drainage infrastructure. The system is currently operating at or near

full capacity.   Much of the current infrastructure will have to be replaced  to meet the

additional capacity demands created by higher intensity rainstorms.  A major current

problem in Santa Monica is the City's potential liability for private and public property

damage due to existing storm drainage infrastructure problems. Increase in storm intensities

will exacerbate the damage caused by storm drainage infrastructure  likely increasing the

City's liability and costs for that damage.  Increased storm intensities and flood frequencies

will damage low lying City-owned properties.  Increased storm intensities will cause

increased erosion and pollution runoff into Santa Monica Bay.

Facility (“SMURRF”), which was established in 2001. SMURRF is the only facility of its kind

in the country and serves as a prototype for similar projects in other cities. It is located

adjacent to the Santa Monica Pier at the Pacific coast and treats the water from the city’s

two highest-volume storm drains. These two storm drains are responsible for conveying

approximately 90 percent of the total flow of the city’s storm drain system. The city then sells

the treated product to others as irrigation water. SMURRF thus represents both a source of

income for Santa Monica and a model of environmentally sound storm drainage treatment.

131.

The facility cannot accept salt water and shuts down when salt water enters

the intake pipe. This results in a loss of revenue to Santa Monica. Global warming will harm

SMURRF’s operation in two ways. SMURRF was built in accordance with historic sea level

statistics. As sea levels rise with increased global warming, the surface tidal flow migrates

further inland, so SMURRF’s intake pipes will take in salt water. This problem also happens

during serious storms. The increased severity of storms, increased frequency of ENSO

events, and rising sea levels resulting from global warming will increase the number of

occasions when SMURRF shuts down, causing damage and lost revenue for Santa Monica.

132.

The rise in sea level caused by global warming could also affect the

groundwater aquifers, and increase the intrusion of salt water.  Sewerage systems could be

overwhelmed by the occasional storm runoff and high tides with the slightly higher

likelihood of flash flooding.

133.

The increase in more intense storms and rainfall will also increase soil

saturation that, in turn, lead to increased frequency of slumping or landslides, affecting both

private and city-owned property and infrastructure, and endangering lives.  This will

damage city-owned property and will require Santa Monica to expend funds to clean up,

rebuild, and stabilize city property and infrastructure.

by Palisades Park, a large public park owned and maintained by Santa Monica, and on the

southwest by the Pacific Coast Highway. Both sites are heavily used by the public.  Increased

severity of storms will result in accelerated erosion of the bluffs as well as more frequent and

more serious land slumps. These in turn pose a serious hazard to human safety in both

Palisades Park and Pacific Coast Highway; and an increase in cost to Santa Monica for

prevention, repair, and liability.

135.  Global warming represents a serious threat to Santa Monica’s water supply

for its residents and municipal use, natural resources, built infrastructure, economy, and the

health of its residents and employees.

136.

Santa Monica’s water supply is primarily purchased from the Metropolitan

Water District and imported into Santa Monica from Northern California via the California

Aqueduct.  The California Aqueduct watershed has a significant winter snowpack that will

experience major changes in the timing and intensity of runoff as average temperatures rise.

Rising temperatures will cause reductions in spring and summer runoff and will increase

winter runoff and earlier peak runoff.

137.  According to the US 2002 Climate Action Report, “Rising temperatures are

very likely to affect snowfall and alter snow melt conditions in much of the western and

northern portions of the country that depend on winter snow-pack for runoff.  This is

particularly important because snow-pack provides a natural reservoir for water storage in

mountainous areas, gradually releasing its water in spring and even summer under current

climate conditions.  Model simulations project that snow-pack in western mountain regions is

likely to decrease as U.S. climate warms.”  It goes on to provide the following startling fact:

These reductions are projected, despite an overall

increase in precipitation, because (1) a larger fraction of precipitation
will fall as rain, rather than snow; and (2) the snowpack is likely to
develop later and melt earlier. The resulting changes in the amount
and timing of runoff are very likely to have significant implications in
some basins for water management, flood protection, power
availability of water
production, water quality, and the

resources for irrigation, hydropower, communities, industry, and the
sustainability of natural habitats and species.

138.

These  projections  are  entirely  consistent  with  the  2001  Intergovernmental  Panel  on

Climate Change Third Assessment Report conclusions for North America that project more winter rainfall

and  less  snowfall  for  the  Pacific  Coast  states  of  North  America.    Precipitation  changes  for  2071  –

2100 for the mountainous areas of California indicate increases in winter precipitation of 0 to

35%, with summer changes of –10 to +10.  Runoff scenarios show a decrease in the summer

season for all scenarios, whereas winter runoff increased in all scenarios where precipitation

was  held  constant  or  increased.    Additionally,  the  United  States  Global  Change  Research

Program  California  Regional  Assessment  of  climate  change  (2002)  indicates  with  a  7°F

temperature rise and an increase in precipitation of 20%, the winter runoff rose by 75%, and

the  summer  runoff  decreased  by  about  50%.    Models  also  show  about  a  50%  decline  in

snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

139.  Recent studies confirm that the disappearance or diminution of snow-pack is

creating severe problems for Western cities (including Santa Monica) that depend directly or

indirectly on snow-pack as their source of drinking water.

140.

It  is  anticipated  that  greenhouse  gas-induced  temperature  increases  will

increase the percentage of precipitation that occurs in the Sierra Nevada Mountains as rain

rather than snow, thereby decreasing the annual snowpack and its inherent natural storage

capacity throughout spring and summer. The impacts of such changes on water resources will most

likely to increase winter runoff in the Sierra Nevadas of northern California with earlier peak flows as more

precipitation falls as rain, but to decrease the spring and summer runoff because of increased evaporation

because of higher temperatures.  This shift could be problematic because the existing reservoirs and water

distribution system in the Sierra Nevada Mountains do not have sufficient capacity to manage the increased

winter  flows  for  later  distribution  in  the  drier  summer  months.    During  the  twentieth  century

snowmelt  runoff  has  come  increasingly  earlier  in  the  water  year,  and  there  has  been  a

marked decline in flows during the critical April to July period.

141.

These changes will have an adverse impact on Santa Monica because City-owned

facilities (and Santa Monica’s residents) receive a large amount of their water from this and other snow-

pack dependent sources.  This will be especially true in the summer time when water resource demand is

high.

142.  As the reliability of distant water supplies, such as the Northern California

source area of the California Aqueduct, is diminished due to the impacts of global climate

change, Santa Monica and other water suppliers in Southern California will be forced to rely

more heavily on local groundwater sources.  California’s groundwater supplies are likely to

be affected by climate change as well.  Unless precipitation actually increases, the increase

evaporation that would accompany the higher temperatures would reduce groundwater

supplies.  Santa Monica owns and operates a number of wells that provide ground water to

City-owned facilities and residents.  Santa Monica sells this water to its residents.  This

increased reliance by others in the Southern California coastal sub-basin would have direct

and deleterious impacts on Santa Monica's water production from local aquifers due to the

interconnected nature of the region's aquifers.  The result of such a condition would be the

diminished recharge of the production aquifers owned by the City and the subsequent

reduction in the sustainable yield from those aquifers.  .  Today, with very real limits to

California’s water system, and every major source being reduced, the state’s systems may be

fairly said to be stressed.  Every major water supply source in California is currently beyond

the physical or legal capacity to be sustained, and is over-allocated  Climate change and

variability will very likely increase stresses to the water system as well as its quality and

uses.

The Los Angeles area, including Santa Monica, experiences heat waves under

very hot, dry Santa Ana conditions.  Higher temperatures and increased frequency of heat

waves may increase the number of heat-related illnesses.  One study estimates that a 3°F

warming could almost double heat-related deaths in the Los Angeles area from the current

70 to 125.  The elderly, and those living alone are at highest risk. Santa Monica City

employees are also at risk.

Carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming.  Fossil fuel combustion is

Put into perspective, OPIC’s and ExIm’s combined support for fossil fuel

proliferation is approximately $10 billion higher than that extended by the World Bank

Group in the same time frame.  In the past 10 years, their spending on fossil fuels has

outpaced spending on renewable energy sources by a ratio of almost 25 to 1  ($32.1 billion for

fossil fuels, $1.3 billion for renewable energy sources).

151.  OPIC’s and ExIm’s contributions to carbon dioxide loading of the earth’s

atmosphere are staggering. The estimated amount of carbon dioxide attributable to, or that

will be directly released by, the projects supported by OPIC and ExIm is much higher than

the entire amount of CO2 that was released from the worldwide consumption of petroleum,

natural gas, coal, and the flaring of natural gas in the year 2000 (32.1 billion tons versus 23.5

billion tons).

152.  OPIC and ExIm agree that they bear some responsibility for the release of

carbon dioxide from power plants that they support and that their actions contribute to

climate change or global warming.  However, they do not account for or assess the direct,

indirect and cumulative environmental effects of the fossil fuel reserves that they help to

extract and deliver to market.

153.  OPIC has never complied with NEPA.  ExIm has assessed at least one project

on the U.S. – Mexico border under NEPA, but has never complied with NEPA in determining

whether the direct, indirect or cumulative impacts of its actions contribute to climate change.

strengthened.  On May 17, 2001, Vice President Cheney, on behalf of the Bush

Administration, released an energy policy entitled “Reliable Affordable and Environmentally

Sound Energy for America’s Future” (Bush/Cheney Energy Policy).  Chapter 8 of the

Bush/Cheney Energy Policy is entitled “Strengthening Global Alliances.”  That chapter’s

overarching goal is to diversify and support overseas sources of oil and gas.  U.S. export

credit and finance agencies (such as OPIC and ExIm) are identified as tools critical to

implementation of this policy.

156.

The Bush/Cheney Energy Policy recognizes that “[t]he trend towards opening

new areas around the globe for exploration and development have yielded significant

dividends” and that  “[w]e need to strengthen our trade alliances, to deepen our dialogue

with major oil producers, and to work for greater oil production in the Western Hemisphere,

Africa, the Caspian and other regions with abundant oil resources.”

157.

The Bush/Cheney Energy Policy establishes a specific policy or executive

directive.

158.  OPIC has taken a group of concerted actions that, in fact, implement its own

and the Bush/Cheney energy policies.

159.  ExIm has taken a group of concerted actions that, in fact, implement its and

the Bush/Cheney energy policies.

160.  OPIC’s and ExIm’s implementation of these policies, either individually or

together, constitute a “program” under NEPA.

programs or are they complying with NEPA in continuing to implement these programs.

Particular projects.

162.  OPIC and ExIm have taken numerous actions to assist particular projects

that contribute to climate change without first complying with NEPA.  Each project has a

significant impact on the environment of the United States (and the world).  The following

projects are illustrative of OPIC’s and ExIm’s actions.

a.

Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline.

163.  On August 1, 2000, ExIm’s Board approved a $200 million loan guarantee in

support of the Chad-Cameroon crude oil development.  The Board supported ABN-Amro

North America Inc.’s application for a guarantee of its loan to the Tchad Oil Transportation

Company for the purpose of procuring equipment and services from Willbros Engineers,

Fluor Daniel, and unspecified additional suppliers, for the installation of a pipeline.

Previously, on June 14, 2000, the Board gave its preliminary approval to this project, and

ExIm announced this decision in a press release. Both actions on June 14, 2000, named

Willbros Engineers, Fluor Daniel, Kellogg Brown & Root (a subsidiary of Halliburton) and

IWL Communications as suppliers for this project. The August 1, 2000, board minutes,

however, dropped any reference to Kellogg Brown & Root and IWL Communications.

Kellogg Brown & Root is a known primary contractor to ExxonMobil in this development.

 164.  The Chad-Cameroon project involves the exploitation of oil fields in southern

Chad and the construction of a 1,070-kilometer crude oil pipeline from Doba, Chad, to the

port of Kribi, Cameroon. The project is operated by ExxonMobil (U.S.) which has a 40 percent

share, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas with a 35 percent stake and ChevronTexaco (U.S.)

with 25 percent.

165.

Pride International, Inc., headquartered in Houston, Texas, sought, and on

May 23, 2002, OPIC’s Board approved, up to $250 million in political risk insurance coverage

for its contract to provide oil field drilling services to ExxonMobil’s subsidiary, Esso

Exploration and Production Chad, Inc.  Pride is deploying five mobile rigs in Chad's

southwestern Doba Oil Basin, comprising the Miandoum, Bolobo, and Komé oil fields, which

will feed oil into the Chad-Cameroon pipeline.

166.  According to ExxonMobil, the Chad-Cameroon project will develop several

oilfields in southern Chad. To export the crude oil to world markets from the landlocked

oilfields, the oil will be transported by a 30" underground pipeline, a distance of 650 miles to

a marine terminal off the coast of Cameroon.  Approximately one billion barrels of oil will be

produced over the 25-30 year life of the Chad-Cameroon project.

167.

The project schedule anticipates start-up in 2003.  The pipeline is currently

under construction.

168.

The oil from this project will be shipped to international markets including

the United States.  Historically, the United States has been the leading consumer of West

African oil.

 169.  Combustion of this oil will result in estimated emissions of 424.7 million

metric tons of CO2.

170.  ExIm and OPIC did not comply with NEPA before taking this action.

b.

Cantarell Oil Fields in Mexico

171.

In June of 1998, January of 2000, and October 2001 ExIm's Board of

Directors approved: loans of $847.6 million, a $400 million loan guarantee, and a $300

million loan guarantee, respectively, in support of the oil and gas extraction in the Cantarell

oil fields of Mexico. The 1998 loan guarantee financed an $847.6 million contract in which

Solar Turbines Inc. provided drilling services to Petroleos Mexicanos for “oil field production

enhancement” at Cantarell.  The 2000 loan supported the sale of equipment and services

from Rolls-Royce Energy Systems, Solar Turbines Inc, Baroid Drilling Fluids, Bechtel

International Inc., and PrinSup.  The 2001 loan guarantee of $300 million supported

equipment and services sales by U.S. suppliers including Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg

Brown & Root, Inc., Bechtel International, Horizon, LLC, Pride Offshore, Schlumberger Well

Services, and ABS Integrated Services.

172.

The Cantarell oil and gas field contains an estimated 13.8 billion barrels of

oil and 15 trillion cubic feet of gas.  ExIm guaranteed loans for the express purpose of

supporting sales and equipment and services with the intention of increasing the amount of

oil and gas extracted from the Cantarell oil field.  The 1998 action allowed production

enhancement by financing a nitrogen injection process estimated to boost production from

1.1 million to 1.4 million barrels per day over a fifteen-year period.  The 2000 action was

designed to boost production by 150,000 million barrels of oil per day.  The  financing

approved in 2001 supported the “Cantarell Oil Field Optimization Project” which will also

boost production.  In total, these actions will allow for recovery of at least 2.5 billion barrels

of oil and 2.7 trillion cubic feet of gas with associated peak annual production of 400 million

barrels and 438 billion cubic feet of gas.

173.  Canterell is now the largest producing oil field in Mexico.

174.  A significant portion (approximately 40%) of the oil from the Cantarell field

will be shipped to the United States.

175.  Cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from these loan guarantees will be an

estimated 1.360 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.

176.  ExIm did not comply with NEPA before taking these actions.

c.

Hamaca project.

177.

In June of 2001, ExIm approved a $627 million loan guarantee toward the

Hamaca oil development in Venezuela.  Morgan Stanley & Co. applied for this guarantee to

support loans by Barclays Bank PLC and Westduetsche Landesbank toward sales of

equipment and services for the “Hamaca Heavy Oil Upgrading” project.  Suppliers named in

the ExIm Board minutes include Fluor Enterprises, Morgan Stanley, and unspecified

additional suppliers.

178.  ExIm’s financing package is now closed.  This financing supported contracts

valued at $1.011 billion awarded in August, 2000 (two months after ExIm’s Board approved

the package) by the Hamaca ownership consortium (which consists of Phillips Petroleum

(40%), ChevronTexaco (30%), and PDVSA (30%)) to Fluor Daniel Corp. and Inelectra Parsons

for crude oil upgrading to be completed in 2003, after which it will produce 190,000 barrels of

oil per day.

179.

The project will result in the extraction of 2.1 billion barrels of oil or 287.7

million metric tons of oil, which will release an estimated 891.2 million metric tons of CO2

when combusted over the project’s lifetime.

180.  Approximately 57% of Venezuelan oil is exported to the United States.  Much

of the oil from the Hamaca project will also be exported to the United States.

181.  ExIm did not comply with the National Environmental Policy Act before

taking these actions.

d.

Sakhalin Oil Field.

182.

In 1997, OPIC’s Board approved a $116 million loan guaranty to Sakhalin

Energy Investment Company, Ltd, in which Houston-based Marathon Oil held a 37.5%

interest.  The guarantee was in support of the development of an oil and gas field off

Sakhalin Island, Russia, known as the “Sakhalin II” block.  This project is one of the largest

offshore oilfield developments in history.  It is being undertaken by several consortia of

multinational companies.

183.

Sakhalin II is the first major Russian oil investment being developed under

Russia’s new production sharing agreement law, and according to OPIC press releases, “it

opens the door for other American companies interested in participating in future oil

production sharing ventures slated for development in the country.”

184.

Subsequent to the issuance of OPIC’s loan guarantee, Marathon withdrew its

interest Sakhalin II.  However, the OPIC guarantee to Sakhalin Energy Investment

Company remains active for the project.

185.

This project is designed to extract estimated reserves of one billion barrels of

oil in the Piltun Astokhshoye field and 14 trillion cubic feet of gas in the Lunskoye field. The

consumption or atmospheric release of these fossil fuels will result in the emissions of over

1.1 billion metric tons of CO2 .

186.

The U.S. Department of Energy in April 2002 stated that the Sakhalin Island

projects and other developments in Eastern Siberia may lead to the export of oil from Russia

to the United States.  Further, in July 2002, an official with Russia’s oil pipeline company,

Transneft, said that refineries on the United States west coast may import Sakhalin crude.

187.

Sakhalin II started to produce oil in 1999.

188.  OPIC did not comply with NEPA before taking this action.

e.

West Seno I and II Oil and Gas Field.

189.  On January 31, 2002, OPIC’s Board approved financing of up to a $300

million loan for the West Seno I oil and gas development and production project in East

Kalimantan, Indonesia.  Unocal Corporation is developing this oil and gas development.

190.  Also on January 31, 2002, OPIC’s Board approved financing of up to a $50

million loan for the West Seno II oil and gas development and production project in East

Kalimantan, Indonesia.

191.

The loans support development of the West Seno offshore crude oil and

natural gas fields in the Makassar Straits off East Kalimantan.

192.

The West Seno I project includes the drilling of more than 20 production

wells, construction of a deep-water production platform, a floating processing unit, and two

60-kilometer oil and gas pipelines from the platform to an existing terminal at Santan.

193.

The West Seno II project will involve construction of a second deep-water

drilling platform and the drilling of an additional twenty or more production wells.

194.  OPIC has stated its actions will result in extraction of an estimated 145

million barrels of oil.

195.  Drilling is expected to commence in January, 2003.

196.  Combustion of fossil fuels from the West Seno I and II projects will result in

the release of an estimated 47 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over the projects’

lifetimes.

196.  Historically, the United States is the second leading importer of Indonesian

oil.

198.  OPIC did not comply with NEPA before taking this action.

f.

Dezhou Coal-fired Power Plant.

199.  On December 3, 1998, the ExIm Board approved a $76 million loan guarantee

toward the expansion of the Dezhou coal-fired power plant in China. ExIm guaranteed a loan

by Citibank International to the applicant, China Construction Bank, for the “Dezhou III”

project.

200.

This financing supported sales of equipment and services, including two 660-

megawatts steam turbine generator sets, from General Electric Company to Shandong

Huaneng Power Development Company Ltd.

201.

In 2001, the plant developers reported “the construction work of the 2 x

660MW coal-fired generating units of Dezhou Phase III is progressing smoothly.”

202.  Once complete, the ExIm-supported expansion will result in the estimated

emission of 177.5 million tons of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.

g.

Other power projects.

204.  OPIC and ExIm have supported numerous other fossil-fuel-fired power plants

around the world.  Both agencies have calculated carbon dioxide

emissions produced directly by these projects.

205.      According to OPIC, between 1990 and 2000, it "supported 52

power projects with a total capacity of 16,775 MW.... Cumulative annual CO2 emissions from

these projects are approximately 56.4 million tons." ("Climate Change: Assessing Our

Actions," OPIC, October 2000, pp. 15-16).

206.     In addition to the projects cited in its October 2000 report, OPIC has since

supported at least nine fossil fuel power plants that will produce an estimated 23.3 million

tons of CO2 per year. OPIC thus supports 61 fossil fuel-fired power projects which will

release an estimated 1.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide over a 20 year period.  This is more

than the combined carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption and flaring of fossil fuels

in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, and Belgium in the year 2000.

207.     According to ExIm, "from the beginning of FY 1987 to the end of June 1999,

the Ex-Im Bank has approved a total of 86 transactions... for foreign fossil fuel power plant

projects . . . [I]t is predicted, through extrapolation, that ExIm Bank supported thermal

power projects will produce up to 425 million tons of CO2 per year by the year 2012 and

beyond." (“Ex-Im Bank’s Role in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change,” Export-

Import Bank of the United States, rev. August 31, 1999).

208.     In addition to the projects cited in its August 1999 report,

ExIm has since supported at least 15 fossil fuel power plants that will produce an estimated

27.8 million tonnes of CO-2 per year. ExIm thus supports 101 fossil fuel-fired power projects

that will release an estimated 9.1 billion tonnes of CO2 over a 20-year period.  This is more

than the combined carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption and flaring of fossil fuels

in North, Central and South America in the year 2000.

209.

The world total of carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption and flaring

of fossil fuels was 23.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide. ExIm's 101 power projects will release

an average of 455 million tons of carbon dioxide, which represents 1.93% global annual

emissions (in 2000). OPIC's 61 projects will release an average of 80 million tons of carbon

dioxide, representing 0.3% annual emissions.  Combined, these agencies' power projects

represent over 2% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption and flaring

of fossil fuels.

210.

These emissions contribute to climate change and the impacts of climate

change to the United States.

211.  Neither OPIC nor ExIm complied with NEPA before approving any of these

numerous projects.
