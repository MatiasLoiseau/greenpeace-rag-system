1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

‘Illegal logging robs national and
subnational governments, forest
owners and local communities of
significant revenues and benefits,
damages forest ecosystems, distorts
timber markets and forest resource
assessments, and acts as a
disincentive to sustainable forest
management. International trade in
illegally harvested timber, including
transfer pricing, under-invoicing and
other illegal practices, exacerbates
the problem of illegal logging.’
[emphasis added]
G8 Action Programme on Forests
1998

In April 2007 Greenpeace International published an investigative report
exposing the social chaos and environmental destruction brought about
by the logging sector operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC). Carving up the Congo was released at a time when all logging titles
in the DRC were beginning to be evaluated under a World Bank-sponsored
legal review process, which is still ongoing.

This new investigative report exposes another hidden aspect of export-
driven resource extraction in the DRC and the neighbouring Republic of the
Congo. Internal company documents obtained by Greenpeace International
show how the German owned, Swiss-based logging multinational Danzer
Group, one of the largest players in the Congo logging sector, is using an
elaborate profit-laundering system designed to move income out of Africa
and into offshore bank accounts, thereby appearing to evade tax payments
in the countries in which its companies operate.

Moreover, evidence has also been uncovered of various other questionable
means employed by the Group to minimise its tax burden in those countries

FALSE ACCOUNTING –
THE DANZER GROUP’S TRICKS OF THE TRADE
The Danzer Group is owned by the German Danzer family, but based in
Switzerland. Previous Greenpeace International reports on the Danzer
Group have exposed the company’s involvement in activities including
trading in illegal timber, bribery and dealing with a timber trader blacklisted
by the United Nations Security Council for illegal arms trafficking in Liberia.
Now it is the turn of the Group’s financial affairs to come under the
spotlight.

Internal Danzer Group documents show in great detail the price fixing
arrangements between the Group’s Swiss-based trading arm Interholco
AG and the parent firm’s logging subsidiaries in the DRC and the Republic
of the Congo. The DRC-based Siforco sells its wood to Interholco at an
official price below the true market value of the wood. The shortfall is made
up through unofficial payments into offshore bank accounts in Europe,
enabling the Danzer Group to evade the payment of a variety of taxes to
which it is liable in the DRC. Greenpeace International has evidence that
the trick has been concealed by encoding the full market prices shown on
order sheets and price lists, and by issuing official invoices that show only
the local price while the offshore payment is invoiced internally.

Greenpeace has also obtained a 2003 PricewaterhouseCoopers audit of
the Danzer Group’s holding company ANBE AG (today Danzer AG). This
points out that the transfer mispricing methods outlined above may not be in
compliance with the local laws applicable to Siforco and IFO respectively.

One Danzer Group document, showing internal accounting procedures,
reveals that Siforco and IFO intended to under-invoice Interholco in recent
years by an average of 35% and 13% respectively.

A 2003 Siforco business plan shows a 2002 local (DRC) loss of ¤1 million
and offshore profit of ¤444,000 for the same year. Projected results for
2003–05 follow the same pattern – losses in the DRC, profits in
Switzerland – except that in all years the offshore profit is actually greater
than the local loss, meaning that an overall profit was predicted. For 2005
a local ‘loss’ of ¤557,000 and an offshore profit of ¤2,730,000 were
projected, giving an overall profit of ¤2,173,000 on which corporate profit
tax would have been due in the DRC had the money not been intended to
be transferred.

Evidence obtained by Greenpeace International estimates that the Danzer
Group’s proposed profit laundering and suspected non-compliance with
tax exemption agreements may have denied the governments of the DRC
and the Republic of the Congo at least ¤7.8 million in tax revenue. This
would be equivalent to any of the following at 2000 prices:

± over 80% of the DRC Government’s investment in public healthcare for

the year 2000

± the cost of vaccination for over 700,000 Congolese children under five

years of age

± 50 times the DRC Ministry of Environment’s annual operating budget

There is equally a fundamental conflict between the industrial logging
model of development and protection of forest areas for climate protection.
One calculation shows that the projected carbon debt from Siforco’s
selective logging alone carries a potential financial liability (notional cost
premium for carbon offset) between 1.5–2.5 times greater than the total
forestry and export-related taxes paid by the company in 2004.

DANZER GROUP PRACTICES THE NORM
NOT THE EXCEPTION
Export figures for the whole of the DRC (2002–05) and the Republic of the
Congo (2004–06) indicate that the phenomenon of tax evasion through
under-invoicing of the sales value of exported timber from both countries is
by no means restricted to the Danzer Group. The average export value for
logs in both countries is very close to the average declared (under-
invoiced) export value of Siforco logs for 2004, indicating that the majority
of logs are exported at below the true market value.

Moreover, published industry-wide market prices for individual species for
the region are close to Siforco’s true export (local plus offshore) market
values, and much higher than the national average export prices from the
DRC and the Republic of the Congo

CONCLUSIONS
In an environment of endemic corruption, logging companies inevitably
operate beyond the rule of law. In the Congo Basin, the logging industry
continues to feed the networks of corruption that are obstacles to genuine
development. Through support for an extractive industry-based model of
development, donor countries and agencies such as the World Bank are
effectively undermining their own rhetoric on establishing good governance
and alleviating poverty.

Even as the World Bank and its donors continue to pour billions of
taxpayers’ dollars into the Congo Basin countries in the name of
eradicating poverty, international players in the logging industry, such as the
Danzer Group, are laundering untaxed profits to offshore bank accounts –
in effect stealing from the region and its people.

If left unchecked, this unscrupulous behaviour will continue to make a
mockery of the international donor community’s poverty reduction efforts.
It poses a major challenge to the World Bank’s aim of tackling corruption
within the logging sector and slowing the expansion of logging. In effect,
in being allowed to get away with evading tax, logging companies are
being given a financial incentive to continue expanding their operations into
some of the world’s last intact rainforests.

International donors, including the World Bank, must prevent further
fraudulent expatriation of wealth and profits from the DRC and the Republic
of the Congo by companies engaged in tax evasion, capital flight and
aggressive tax avoidance. To this end they must:

± demand that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
establish a requirement for all multinational companies to report
their trading activities on a country-by-country basis within their
consolidated accounts. This approach would identify a group’s
internal and external income and costs in each country where it
operates, hence minimising the risk of transfer pricing abuse
occurring. Such a requirement on the part of the IASB would have
the status of international law, and would thus not require local
legislative consent.

2 INTRODUCTION

THE WORLD BANK

‘The $1 trillion or more a year of illicit
money that flows across borders … is
the most damaging economic condition
hurting the poor in developing and
transitional economies. It drains hard-
currency reserves, heightens inflation,
reduces tax collection, worsens income
gaps, cancels investment, hurts
competition, and undermines trade.
It leads to shortened lives for millions
of people and deprived existences for
billions more.’
Raymond Baker, Director,
Global Financial Integrity1

The debate over how poor and heavily indebted countries with high levels
of corruption and weak governance can escape from poverty has in large
part focused on the need to increase international donor funding in order to
stimulate domestic economic growth. One such heavily indebted country is
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the World Bank is by
far the largest financial donor and most influential international actor behind
the reform of the logging sector, which it sees as a key means of boosting
the country’s GDP.

In April 2007 Greenpeace International published an investigative report
exposing the social chaos and environmental destruction brought about
by international logging companies operating in the DRC. Carving up the
Congo2 was released at a time when all logging titles in the DRC were
beginning to be evaluated under a World Bank-sponsored legal review
process.

However, the legal review – which is still ongoing – has not succeeded in
verifying even the very basic criteria set by the government, the most
important being the ‘legal validity of the titles’ (ie ensuring that they have
been obtained in accordance with the correct procedures), establishing
that forest holdings ‘comply with boundaries as defined by the title and the
topographical map attached to the title’, and verifying ‘full payment of forest
area taxes since 2003’. In short, it only deals with the enforcement of laws
relating to logging companies’ land holdings.

As a result of its restricted scope, the legal review will have only a limited
impact on the corruption endemic within the DRC’s logging sector. One
area it is failing to tackle is the issue of tax evasion by logging companies.
The review is looking at only one of the forms of taxation specifically
relevant to the logging industry – the forest area tax.

The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the DRC
Government have yet to address the logging companies’ failure to make
full and fair payment of other taxes due on revenues they generate in the
country, such as corporate profit tax and export-related taxes (some of
them specific to the logging industry), and the impact of this tax evasion on
development. The general development strategy has been to focus on
how money and resources flow into the DRC, rather than on how financial
wealth leaks away from the country – although a report published by the
IMF3 does admit that as far as corporate profit tax is concerned ‘transfer
pricing practices [see below] and the global characteristics of most timber-
producing companies pose significant administrative challenge.’

7

In 2006, nearly three-quarters of DRC timber exports were controlled by
just four foreign-owned logging groups: the Danzer Group (German owned,
Swiss based4), the NST Group (Portuguese owned, Liechtenstein based5),
Olam (Indian owned, Singapore based6) and Trans-M (Lebanese7). The
Danzer Group alone accounts for 40% of such exports (See Table 11).8

This latest Greenpeace International investigation exposes how the Danzer
Group – one of the largest logging companies operating in both the DRC
and the neighbouring Republic of the Congo – is laundering its untaxed
profits in offshore bank accounts, and describes the internal procedures
the Group uses to achieve this. The Danzer Group is deliberately under-
invoicing its timber exports and provision of services between subsidiaries
to avoid paying taxes, a practice which creates a hole in the government
revenues of the two countries.

The report is based on confidential Danzer Group internal documents, all of
which are held by Greenpeace International. Quotations from documents
written in German have been translated by Greenpeace International; the
original text is given in the endnotes. Quotations without such endnotes are
from documents written in English.

While this report focuses solely on the practices used by the Danzer
Group, tax evasion by under-invoicing may be assumed to be the rule
rather than the exception in the logging sector in the DRC and the
Republic of the Congo. The practice calls for immediate and tough action
by the governments of the DRC and the Republic of the Congo, the World
Bank and the IMF.

3 TRANSFERRING WEALTH OFFSHORE –
TAX ME IF YOU CAN!

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), up to 60% of the world’s trade may take place
between subsidiaries of the same multinational corporation.10 Transactions
across international borders between different parts of the same
corporation offer ample scope to shift profits and/or escape paying tax.11
Such transactions are subject to what is known as ‘transfer pricing’ –
so called because the price is set not by the market but internally by the
corporation, as a means of transferring ownership between different
companies in the same group.12

Manipulation of transfer prices – ‘transfer mispricing’, in effect – allows
corporations to engage in capital flight, channelling billions of dollars each
year out of developing countries and into offshore tax havens.13 The
volume of mispriced (under- or over-invoiced) trade has been estimated
at more than $600 billion a year, nearly half of the illicit money that crosses
international borders.14

UNITED NATIONS

‘Of the $1–1.6 trillion of illicit money
that crosses borders annually … the
commercially tax-evading component,
driven primarily by falsified pricing in
imports and exports, is by far the
largest, at some 60 to 65 percent
of the global total.’
Raymond Baker, Director,
Global Financial Integrity9

DEFINITIONS
Profit laundering
This term refers to the business practice of moving profit from the country
in which it was earned, and where it would incur tax, into a tax haven, with
the aim of minimising tax liability. Mechanisms for achieving this include the
practice of transfer mispricing.16

‘The difference between tax avoidance
and tax evasion is the thickness of a
prison wall.’
Denis Healey,
a former British chancellor15

Transfer pricing and the arm’s-length principle
Transfer pricing is the process of setting the prices at which sales between
related companies within a corporate group take place. Such prices have
to be set in order for there to be trade within the group.17

In  an  international  context,  transfer  pricing  is  considered  a  legitimate
practice so long as it is undertaken using the ‘arm’s-length principle’ – that
is to say, the price set should be equivalent to the open market price that
would  be  charged  between  unrelated  and  independent  companies.18
Both the OECD and the United Nations have endorsed this arm’s-length
principle for transfer pricing.19

However, many corporate groups do not respect the arm’s length principle
and  launder  their  profits  into  tax  havens  through  transfer  mispricing.  For
instance, by charging low transfer prices from a company based in a high-
tax country that is selling to a company in a low-tax country, a group can
record a low profit in the first country and a high profit in the second.

Tax avoidance
Tax avoidance describes any action taken to minimise tax liability that does
not involve deception or breaking the law, in contrast with tax evasion.20

Aggressive tax avoidance
This process occurs when people and companies exploit loopholes and
flaws with tax laws in order to avoid tax (ie they abuse the spirit of the tax
laws).21

Tax evasion
Tax evasion is paying less tax than you are legally obliged to through the
non-payment or underpayment of taxes, usually effected by making a false
declaration  (eg  through  false  accounting)  or  no  declaration  to  the  tax
authorities.22

Tax haven
A tax haven is a country or designated zone that has low or no taxes.23

10

11

A company wishing to under-invoice the value of goods it is exporting can
do this by selling the goods to another company within the same group.
The recipient company is almost invariably based in a tax haven.24 This
intermediate company then sells the goods on to yet another company
within the same group, this time based in the country where the goods
will be resold to the ultimate third-party customer. For the purposes of
this second intra-group transaction, the goods will be priced at an arm’s-
length value.

The result of this process is that part of the profit is diverted from the tax
system of the country where the goods originated, and the value of the
tax that should have been paid is fraudulently expatriated to the tax haven.
This value will, of course, typically be unknown to the authorities in the
country of origin to whom tax should have been paid on the full arm’s-
length value of the goods.25

If the goods were sold at arm’s-length value by the group member in the
country of origin to the group member making the sale to a third-party
customer, an appropriate split of costs and profits out of the sale proceeds
might look like this:

Group member
(country of origin)

Group member
(country of sale)

Costs:
40%

Profit:
20%

Costs:
30%

Profit: 10%

But if an intermediate tax haven company were introduced into the
transaction the split might be:

Group member
(country of origin)

Group member
(tax haven)

Group member
(country of sale)

Costs:
40%

Profit:
2%

Costs:
1%

Profit:
17%

Costs:
30%

Profit: 10%

©Greenpeace/Davison

Note that while the profit from the country of origin is mostly shifted to the
tax haven, the profit in the country of sale is unaffected. It is the country of
origin that loses out, the vast majority of its potential tax revenue having
been diverted to a tax haven. A small proportion of the profit in the country
of origin may be retained to give the impression that something is being
earned locally. Profits are being apportioned in this way because the
countries of origin are almost always in the developing world. These
countries generally have poor or completely non-existent measures to
control transfer pricing abuse. In contrast, the country of sale is usually
in the developed world where controls on transfer pricing exist.

4 FALSE ACCOUNTING –
THE DANZER GROUP’S TRICKS OF THE TRADE

‘Rather than reaping short-term profits,
Danzer Group’s entrepreneurial activities
support social principles. For years,
our work in Africa has involved large
investments, which have made
significant contributions to local
development. Danzer Group is one of
the most important foreign investors
in the Republic of Congo and the
Democratic Republic of Congo.’
Danzer Group website26

This section illustrates how trading within the Danzer Group of timber
products from two of its African subsidiaries does not comply with the
arm’s-length principle for determining transfer prices, resulting in the
apparent underpayment of tax in both the DRC and the Republic of the
Congo.

The trade in question is between, on the one hand, the Danzer Group
logging companies Siforco (DRC) and IFO (Republic of the Congo) and,
on the other hand, the Danzer Group timber trading subsidiary Interholco
(Switzerland).

Since Interholco is knowingly involved in setting the rates of under-invoicing
for Siforco and IFO, and even controls the offshore accounts maintained in
the names of these companies, Greenpeace International argues that this
practice also represents profit laundering.

THE EVIDENCE –
UNDER-INVOICING FOR EXPORTS
The Danzer Group appears to have been making use of transfer mispricing
and offshore accounts since at least the late 1990s. A memo dated July
1998 addressed to Ulrich Grauert,27 one of the two executive directors of
Interholco, refers to the outcome of a meeting between Mr Haag of Siforco
with Jean Calvin Kandolo, the then State Secretary to President Kabila:

‘The monetary value of exported goods does not flow back into the D.R.
Congo, instead gets transferred to a blocked account in Europe in order
to buy road building machinery, public transport buses etc.’28

An unsigned draft contract (most likely between 2000 and 2002)29
between Interholco and Siforco shows the arrangements between the two
companies for the transfer mispricing of timber intended for export.30 In it,
they agree that Siforco will sell its timber products to Interholco at an
internally fixed price which ‘for business reasons, is set too low’.31

14

15

According to the proposed procedure, Interholco is then to pay that fixed
price ‘direct to Siforco and a so-called excess price to an account in
Europe’.32 The account in question is an offshore bank account held in
the name of Siforco, but directly managed by Interholco in Switzerland.33
Another document dated November 2002 indicates that this account is
held with French bank Credit Lyonnais, the same bank with which other
African subsidiaries of the Danzer Group (including IFO and SIFCI (Côte
d’Ivoire) and Cotraco (DRC)) have offshore accounts.34

The element of the overall timber price that Interholco pays to the African
subsidiaries’ offshore accounts and which is not declared in the country
from which the timber originates is generally referred to as the
‘Filialbuchhaltung’ (FBH) or ‘branch accounting’ element.35

In a letter dating from 2002,36 Mr Schmidt of IFO complains to Ulrich
Grauert of Interholco that ‘contracts are still being issued incorrectly.
Basically, no overt prices must be sent for IFO contracts. You know the
reason: if false information gets into unauthorised hands this will certainly
lead to costly consequences for IFO or for Siforco.’37

Schmidt then explains how the ‘codified [sic]’38 total price should not be
listed directly below the local price, as otherwise ‘even the stupidest
Norwegian will see, no doubt, that this is the real price.’39 The coded
pricing method is described in examples attached to the letter.40

Schmidt finally instructs Grauert that ‘[t]he word “prix” should vanish
altogether from the order sheet. Since all prices are in Euros, only coded
prices should be there, without the Euro prefix. The less indication of price
there is, the better.’41 The coded pricing method has been found in use on
orders placed with Siforco by Interholco in 2003.42

A diagram attached to an email dated November 2002 explains in detail
the new under-invoicing procedure for the Danzer Group subsidiaries
Siforco, IFO, SIFCI and Cotraco,43 covering both timber exports and
services. The comprehensive diagram shows how the Danzer Group
finance staff issue invoices and payments to various accounts, including
the FBH account. For example, the diagram shows that, Siforco and IFO
intended to under-invoice Interholco in recent years by an average of 35%
and 13% respectively.

Interholco and its African counterparts Siforco and IFO regularly agree
internal price lists used to determine the amounts to appear on official and
unofficial invoices to Interholco. The lists cover prices by species and by
product (ie logs, sawn timber and veneers), with each one having its own
distinct rate of under-invoicing. Some products are under-invoiced as much
as 85%, whilst others are under-invoiced at around 3%.

The most recent price list held by Greenpeace International is a Siforco list
for 2007, which (although the coded pricing method is no longer used) still
maintains the split between the fixed local price and the additional offshore
price.44 2007 invoices from Siforco to Interholco show the local price but
not the total price:45 the difference between the invoiced local price and
the total price is invoiced internally via a credit note and transferred into the
offshore account.46

† original data from the Danzer Group; ‡ calculated by Greenpeace International (figures are rounded)

The Siforco internal price lists specify three different prices for each timber
species and product type (eg logs, sawn timber or veneer), their relative
proportions varying according to the species concerned:

1. Siforco invoice – the fixed local price for Siforco’s official invoices to

Interholco

2. Siforco FBH – the additional price to be paid to the offshore account
3. Total price – the sum of the fixed local price and the additional offshore

price.

Using the 2007 price list we can calculate just how much money is sent to
the offshore account in a typical timber transaction between Siforco and
Interholco. Figure 1 shows the sale value of a shipment of 100 cubic
metres of sawn first- and second-grade kiln-dried wenge timber.47

FIGURE 1: Siforco’s local vs offshore payments for a shipment of wenge
Fixed price in the DRC =
¤47,854
Offshore FBH account payment =  ¤112,146
¤160,000
Total price (Switzerland) =

In this case, 70% of the sale value bypasses the DRC’s customs and tax
authorities. Admittedly, wenge is one of the high-value species for which
the 2007 price list indicates that a higher proportion of the total value
should be channelled into the offshore account.

Nevertheless, even averaged across all species, as Table 1 shows, each
year Siforco fails to declare 20% to 40% of its true gross sales values (ie
including both domestic and export sales), while IFO fails to declare
between 15% and 20%. Gross sales figures given in Siforco’s and IFO’s
2004–06 business plans, drawn up by the Danzer Group, indicate what
proportion of sales was invoiced or projected to be invoiced unofficially
(offshore). Of course, since the gross sales figures include domestic sales
that would not have been subject to transfer mispricing, the actual
percentages by which each year’s total export sales were under-invoiced
would have been somewhat higher than shown.48

18

19

THE EVIDENCE –
UNDER-INVOICING FOR SERVICES
In addition to the under-invoicing of its own exports, Siforco appears to
under-invoice for services provided to other Danzer Group companies,
such as the milling or transporting of logs.

Timber processing services supplied by Siforco to IFO are referred to in an
email dated February 200250 from Martin Cuezva (responsible for the FBH
at Danzer Services Europe (DSE)51) to Georg Herger (then the Company
Secretary (Prokurist) of Interholco).

Cuezva states: ‘I already mentioned to you that, in order to avoid tax
deduction at source [ie the payment of a withholding tax52], we only record
in the official accounts a small proportion of Siforco payment claims for
services liable to source tax deduction. (Arthur knows about this.)’53 Arthur
Burgener was one of four CEOs of Interholco at least until 2000. By 2007
he had become the Company Secretary (Prokurist) of Interholco and
Danzer AG, the Danzer Group’s holding company.54

Cuezva goes on: ‘For this purpose the official debit notes for Siforco are
divided into two debit notes. One sum is officially recorded in the IFO
accounts, and the remainder of the Siforco payment claim is kept in a
second set of records only included in the branch [ie FBH] accounts’. 55

THE EVIDENCE –
OTHER POSSIBLE MANIPULATED
TRANSACTIONS FOR SERVICES
Other inter-group services liable to tax deduction at source are referred to
in a detailed memorandum by Samuel Zürcher (a Danzer Group manager)
about a visit to IFO which he undertook at the end of 2001.56 One section
deals with the need for Martin Cuezva to reconcile specific inter-group
bookkeeping ‘issues not possible for “outsiders”’.

Zürcher lists the inter-group bookkeeping relations between IFO and the
other Danzer Group companies Siforco, Cotraco, Danzer Furnierwerke,
Jura Placage SAS and Danzer Anlagen und Beteiligungs GmbH
(DANBE).57

He then explains how loans provided by DANBE to the Danzer Group
companies (eg Siforco and IFO) are ‘considered under A/P [accounts
payable] affiliates in order to avoid tax at source’.58

©Greenpeace/Davison

He also explains how IFO avoided paying tax at source on the purchase of
an aircraft: ‘IFO’s aircraft was purchased by Siforco. The debt was “sold” to
Jura Placage SAS [a Danzer Group company in France], which is receiving
the repayments directly from IFO (the reason being that the [Republic of
the] Congo and France have a tax treaty, so no tax at source).’59

20

THE EVIDENCE –
AVOIDING OR EVADING TAXES ON
EXPATRIATE SALARIES?
The DRC government introduced a tax in 1969 (updated in 2002)60 to
encourage companies to support locally sourced labour rather than
recruiting expatriate personnel from outside the Congo region. The
Exceptional Tax on Expatriate Remuneration (Impôt Exceptionnel sur les
Rémunérations des Expatriés – IERE) is levied on employers at a rate of
25% of the salaries of expatriates who are paid in local currency.61
The IERE tax is not deductible from the employer’s taxable profits.62

The draft contract between Interholco and Siforco already mentioned63
explicitly states:

‘Siforco-related expenses which Siforco cannot pay officially (European
insurance, expatriate salaries, machine replacement parts, repatriation
of unregistered loans etc) are settled via this [offshore] account’
[emphasis added].64

Furthermore, the diagram in the November 2002 document mentioned
above65 shows that not only Siforco expatriates, but also expatriates
working for IFO, are being paid out of the offshore banks accounts.

In the case of Siforco, the Danzer Group is at the very least escaping taxes
on expatriate salaries by paying them offshore (ie so-called aggressive tax
avoidance66).

WHAT PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS TOLD
THE DANZER GROUP’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS
In May 2003, PricewaterhouseCoopers presented a draft report for final
approval to the Danzer Group’s Board of Directors documenting the
principal findings from an audit of the consolidated accounts of ANBE AG –
the Group’s holding company – for the year ending 2002.67 (In July 2005,
ANBE AG changed its name to Danzer AG).68

The report discloses that financial statements for Siforco and Cotraco69
were not included in the accounts for Danzer Anlagen and Beteiligungen
GmbH (intermediate holding company for Siforco and Cotraco),70 although
this was required in order to ‘comply with local business law’ within
Germany.71 As a result of this omission, it is doubtful whether either
company’s offshore profits were included in any consolidated account
within the Danzer Group.

The PricewaterhouseCoopers report devotes a section to the Group’s
grounds for setting up and using ‘branch accounts’ (ie offshore accounts)
for its African subsidiaries Cotraco, SIFCI, Siforco and IFO. In the case of
Siforco and IFO, the auditors were unable to reconcile ‘all the intercompany
balances’.

PricewaterhouseCoopers states candidly that some of the Siforco’s costs
are paid outside the country of production and outside the subsidiaries’
own local accounts. In particular, the PricewaterhouseCoopers auditors
questioned the use of offshore accounts as a source of ‘additional income
in Switzerland’ to pay for ‘foreign originating costs’ such as the salaries of
expatriates, spare parts and foreign exchange. The following conclusion is
repeated for each of the African subsidiaries:

‘These transactions might not fully comply with local law. Due to the fact
that the existence and the transactions of [Cotraco, SIFCI,72 Siforco and
IFO] Branch accounts are not fully known locally (Africa), we are not in a
position to finally assess a possible risk of Danzer Group.’

23

In September 2006, the Danzer Group joined forces with WWF to ‘jointly
undertake long-term efforts to effectively promote prudent and responsible
forestry in the Central African forests’, through WWF’s Global Forest and
Trade  Network  (GFTN).84 In  2007,  IFO  was  accepted  as  a  member  of
GFTN, while Siforco’s membership application is subject to the outcome
of  the  legal  review  process  in  the  DRC.85 (It  is  worth  noting  that  for  the
purposes of GFTN membership, WWF defines the terms ‘illegal logging’
and ‘forest crime’ as including transfer pricing abuses.)86

The Danzer Group has also been asking the German development bank
KfW87 and  the  French  development  corporation  Agence  Française  de
Développement  (AFD)88 to  provide  low  interest  loans  to  Siforco  to  help
meet the cost of expanding the company’s logging operations in the DRC
– in effect, a public subsidy. These loans would be used by the Danzer
Group to help it meet its existing legal obligation to develop management
plans for its forest holdings in the DRC,89 as well as assisting with the cost
of forest certification for some of its operations.90 Expenditure on assisting
an already profitable company to fulfil its statutory requirements, or to meet
criteria for a certification which will further increase its potential profitability,
represents a questionable use of international development funding.

THE DANZER GROUP’S PRACTICES –
CLEAN-UP OR COVER-UP?
Previous  Greenpeace  International  reports  on  the  Danzer  Group  have
exposed the company’s involvement in forest crimes, including trading in
illegal timber, bribery, suspected forgery of documents, and dealing with a
timber  trader  blacklisted  by  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  for
involvement in illicit arms trafficking activities in Liberia.74

Since the publication of these reports, the Danzer Group has undertaken
a  public  relations  offensive  in  an  attempt  to  clean  up  its  tainted  image,
publishing new African timber buying policies75 while continuing to deny its
past activities.76 It has also been trying to win back valuable lost business
with companies such as the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA, whose orders
were worth around ¤5 million to the Danzer Group in 2002.77

In late 2006 the Danzer Group’s Senior Vice President for sales, wrote a
circular letter to customers stating:

‘We  are  pleased  to  inform  you  that  discussions  with  representatives  of
IKEA  and  Danzer  Group  arrived  at  the  conclusions  that  IKEA  will  again
accept  all  companies  from  Danzer  Group  as  their  veneer  contractor
immediately effective … As you might know, this longtime relationship was
discontinued  because  of  aggressions  in  the  range  of  environment
protection against the Danzer Group.’78

Other corporate groups that have large contracts with the Danzer Group
include  the  Saint-Gobain  Group,79 a  major  supplier  to  the  construction
industry  with  operations  in  57  countries.80 In  2006  Interholco  signed  an
agreement with the Group to develop ‘commercial relationships’ with two
of its timber trading subsidiaries, Point P (France) and International Timber
(UK).81

In its recent public relations material the Danzer Group tries to portray itself
as one of the more progressive logging companies in the Congo region.
For  instance,  Group  CEO  Hans-Joachim  Danzer  proclaimed  in  a  joint
press release with WWF:

‘Illegal  logging  is  a  threat  to  serious  producer  companies  and  fair
competition  on  world  markets,  and  must  be  stopped.’82 The  Group’s
website  claims  its  own  values  now  include  making  ‘every  effort  to  help
underdeveloped regions … find sensible paths to the future’.83

5 TAX IMPLICATIONS –
SIPHONING OFF THE WEALTH

INTERHOLCO TRADE WITH SIFORCO
– EXPORT TAXES EVADED
Potential total 2002–04:
Potential total 2006:

approx ¤278,000
approx ¤352,000

The practices described above strongly suggest that Siforco and IFO do
not declare their full turnover and profit to the relevant tax authorities in the
DRC and the Republic of the Congo. Instead they appear to declare only
their ‘official’ invoices based on the lower fixed price, thus saving on
various forms of tax payable within their respective countries of operation.

ESCAPING TAXES ON TIMBER EXPORTS
Setting an artificially low transfer price – as with Siforco’s and IFO’s
systematic under-invoicing of the export value of timber they sell to
Interholco – helps an exporting company to reduce the level of export-
related taxes it pays.

Export taxes are levied on the declared export values of the timber and
timber products exported: in most exporting countries these are reported
as free-on-board (FOB), which includes the transaction value of the goods
and the value of services performed to deliver goods to the border of the
exporting country.91

A Danzer Group document dated February 2003 forecasts export-related
taxes for Siforco in that year on the basis on the following rates: 92

Ministry of the Environment93
± An export tax which goes towards the Fonds de Reconstitution

du Capital Forestier, levied at:
± 4% of FOB value on logs
± 1.5% of FOB value on sawn timber and veneer

Ministry of Commerce
± An export inspection fee, the Frais de Contrôle à l’Exportation,

levied by the Office Congolais de Contrôle94 at:
± 1.2% of FOB value on logs
± 0.6% of FOB value on sawn timber and veneer

Ministry of Finance
± A turnover tax, the Contribution sur le Chiffre d’Affaires (CCA),
levied by the Office des Douanes et Accises (OFIDA)95 at:
± 3% of FOB value on logs only

Maritime Freight Management Office96
± A freight handling tax, levied at:

± 0.24% of FOB value on logs, sawn timber and veneer

An unpublished 2006 report on Siforco gives the company’s own locally
declared export figures for logs, sawn timber and veneer for the three-year
period 2002–04.97 On the basis of these export values, and if Interholco
achieved its target rate of under-invoicing of 35% (the figure shown in the
November 2002 diagram already referred to98) and the same rate of taxes
mentioned above, it is possible to estimate that the Danzer Group would
have evaded almost ¤278,000 of export-related tax revenue in 2002–04
(see Table 2).

Siforco’s 2006 total timber export value is provided by the DRC Direction

possible to estimate that the Danzer Group would have evaded almost
¤352,000 of export-related tax revenue in 2006 (see Table 3). As before,
this assumes that Interholco achieved its intended rate of under-invoicing of
35% (the figure shown in the November 2002 diagram already referred
to100) and the same average total rate of taxes given in Table 2.

– OTHER EXPORT TAXES WAIVED OR
FURTHER TAX EVASION?
Potential total 2000–02:
Potential total 2003:

¤82,000

The DRC’s Office des Douanes et Accises (OFIDA) would at that time have
charged a duty of 6% on logs based on FOB values (Droits de sortie à
l’exportation).101 This was in addition to the turnover tax (CCA) described
above.

However, the Danzer Group did not budget for these taxes in its 2003
budget102 because Siforco had been exempted from them as part of a
June 2001 agreement with the Ministry of Finance (the government
department that oversees the Office des Douanes et Accises) under the
DRC Investment Code.

According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report mentioned above, this
agreement was subject to Siforco investing some ¤28.8 million in capacity
improvements or new capacity during the three-year period 2000–02.103
Under the Investment Code, a company receives exemption from export-
related taxes for the investment period and a set period subsequent to it
(ie goods resulting from the actual investment made are exempt from tax).
So under the June 2001 agreement, the export taxes would probably have
been exempted into 2003, as well as during 2000–02.

For the period 2000–02, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report concluded:

‘At December 31, 2002 the investments amounted only to some ¤0.7
Mio [¤700,000, or 2.4% of the promised investment]. In the event the
[DRC] government requires full compliance with the terms of the
agreement, the company may become liable for taxes it was previously
exempted. The local auditor estimates this amount about KEUR 472.
[¤472,000].’

The ¤472,000 of taxes exempted for the period 2000–02 was entered into
the accounts as a tax liability in the audit adjustments at the end of the
report, showing how seriously the PricewaterhouseCoopers auditors
viewed this breach of the 2001 tax exemption agreement (‘no compliance
with tax agreement June 7, 2001’).

For 2003 it is possible to estimate – on the basis of the total local export
value given in the unpublished 2006 report and the rate of under-invoicing
– that Siforco’s liability for the duty would have been around ¤82,000 (see
Table 4).

INTERHOLCO TRADE WITH IFO
– EXPORT TAXES EVADED?
Potential total 2005:

approx ¤470,000

In the Republic of the Congo, certain export taxes are calculated on FOB
prices and hence can again fall victim to under-invoicing. In 2005,
according to a report compiled by Ernst & Young for the Republic of the
Congo’s Ministry of Finance,104 IFO paid a total of FCFA 2.1 billion
(approximately ¤3.2 million105) in forestry-related taxes, of which FCFA 1.3
billion (approximately ¤1.98 million) was based on FOB values and hence
vulnerable to under-invoicing (eg harvest/cutting and export taxes).

Given that in 2005 IFO appears to have been expecting to under-invoice
by about 19% (see Table 1), its underpayment of FOB-related taxes may
have amounted to FCFA 305 million (about ¤470,000).

PROFIT LAUNDERING –
ESCAPING TAX ON CORPORATE INCOME
In addition to reducing the level of export-related taxes paid, setting an
artificially low transfer price helps reduce, or even eliminate, the amount of
tax paid on profits made in the country of origin of the timber. According to
the World Bank, tax on corporate income in the DRC is currently levied at
40%106 of gross profit and in the Republic of the Congo at 38%.107

The business plans already referred to show that between 2003 and 2006
neither Siforco nor IFO was projected to pay any local tax on profits, not
only because of tax exemptions (discussed below) that covered the whole
period (IFO) or the bulk of the period (Siforco), but also because, with the
exception of a small proportion of Siforco’s projected 2006 profit, any
overall profit made by the companies was being transferred offshore via the
under-invoicing practices described in Section 3.

The detailed plans show actual profit before and after tax for 2002,
forecast profit before and after tax for 2003 and budgeted profit before and
after tax for 2004–06.108 They contain three sets of tables detailing
incomes, expenses and profits for each part of the company’s book-
keeping system: one set for ‘local’, one for ‘offshore’ and one for
‘integrated’, which as already explained combines the local and offshore
categories. In all three financial accounts, for this whole period, the ‘profit
before tax’ is identical to the ‘profit after tax’, while the line labelled ‘tax’
always remains empty (see Tables 5 and 6). In other words, it is clear that
Siforco and IFO did not expect to pay any taxes during the period
2002–06.

INTERHOLCO TRADE WITH SIFORCO –
CORPORATE TAXES WAIVED OR
FURTHER TAX EVASION?
Potential total 2003–06: approx ¤2.2 million

As can be seen from Table 5:

± Siforco’s local account (DRC) shows a loss for 2002 and a predicted

loss for the years 2003–05.

± Siforco’s offshore account, into which Interholco pays the difference
between the under-invoiced price on the official invoice and the true
export price, shows a profit for all these years. Moreover, the predicted
profits shown for the years 2003–05 exceed in each case the loss
shown for the local account, resulting in an overall profit when the local
and offshore accounts are integrated. Hence, in 2003–05, all potentially
taxable profit, and in 2006 the majority of potentially taxable profit, made
by Siforco in the DRC is proposed to be transferred to an offshore
account managed by Interholco in Switzerland.

± Siforco’s integrated accounting shows a projected overall potentially

taxable profit for the five-year period 2002–06 amounting to ¤5.6 million.

INTERHOLCO TRADE WITH IFO –
CORPORATE TAXES WAIVED OR
TAX LIABILITY DEFERRED?
Potential total 2002–06: approx ¤4 million

Whether Siforco fully realised, or indeed exceeded, its overall projected
profit for the period 2003–06 remains unclear; however, an internal Danzer
Group evaluation of the Group subsidiaries dated November 2006
proclaims that ‘the company [Siforco] is making a profit.?111 Another
document dated February 2007 shows that for the calendar year 2006 the
profit in the Siforco offshore account amounted to ¤2.85 million112 – only a
little less than the profit budgeted for in the 2004–06 Siforco business plan
(ie ¤3.38 million).

As indicated in the previous section, Siforco has been the beneficiary of
various tax exemptions by the DRC Ministry of Finance. As part of a new
agreement reached with the investment authority, Agence Nationale pour la
Promotion des Investissements (ANAPI), in November 2003, Siforco was
exempted from corporate income tax for the three year period 2004–06
on any profits resulting directly from a proposed US$16.5 million
investment.113

Whether Siforco made the entire investment in the timeframe proposed
by the 2003 agreement (half in 2003 and half in 2004) is not fully known.
However, the following observations can be made:

± The Siforco business plan for 2004–06,114 also drawn up in 2003, did
not foresee any such investments, either for 2003 or for any of the
following years up to 2006.

± If indeed Siforco made no such investment, then the agreement would
have been invalid and it would have been liable for corporate income
tax on all its profits. However, by means of under-invoicing, local profit in
the DRC was projected to be almost entirely eliminated for the years in
question, as explained above and illustrated in Table 5.

Assuming that Siforco would be liable for corporate income tax – currently
levied at 40% – on its projected profits for 2004–06, and that it had not
transferred nearly all of its taxable profit offshore, it would have had to pay
the DRC Ministry of Finance some ¤2.2 million. Thus it may be that
Siforco’s systematic under-invoicing over that period enabled the Danzer
Group to evade ¤2.2 million of corporate income tax from which its
exemption would otherwise have been doubtful.

IFO’s situation is not dissimilar, with the company benefiting from an
exemption on corporate income tax running from 1999 to 2007,115 based
on an investment period during the first two years of the agreement.116
Whether IFO made the entire investment in the timeframe proposed by the
agreement is not known. However, this seems unlikely given that at the
time the IFO business plan was drafted (December 2003) the company
was technically ‘insolvent’ and new investments were not being made.
A memo to the Danzer Group management from René Giger of Interholco
reporting a visit to IFO in April 2003 and copied to members of the Danzer
family, reveals considerable anxiety on the subject: 117

‘Solvency Planning: Because of the uncertain fiscal situation, planning
is very difficult. However, it is clear that with today’s FOB prices IFO is
only just keeping in the black but has not yet made any
investments. With the extra tax [referring to an increase in the rate of
export-related taxes in the Republic of Congo] IFO will need approx.
another EUR 2 million. We will have to check whether this can be offset
by the subsidiary-BH [ie the offshore account].’ [emphasis added]

In its December 2003 business plan, IFO planned to continue transferring
funds into its offshore account by means of its under-invoicing practices,
maintaining the local account in a state of ongoing losses. By this means,
the local account would be left with zero liability to taxes on profit.

The business plan does not show the carrying forward of any losses from
previous years. However, in most tax systems around the world, including
the Republic of the Congo,118 such losses can be offset against future
profits (ie tax only becomes due when a real profit is earned after the earlier
losses have been taken into account).

32

33

As can be seen from Table 6:

± IFO’s local account (Republic of the Congo) shows projected cumulative

losses for the years 2002–06 amounting to ¤17.3 million.

± IFO’s offshore account, into which Interholco pays the difference

between the under-invoiced price on the official invoice and the true
export price, shows projected cumulative profits for the years 2002–06
amounting to ¤10.6 million.

± IFO’s integrated account thus shows projected cumulative losses for the

years 2002–06 amounting to ¤6.7 million.

Even if IFO had not transferred any profits to its offshore account, and
could have carried forward the losses shown for its integrated account, it
would still not have been liable to any tax on profits for the period shown.
This would remain the case even if its exemption had lapsed as a result of
failure to make the agreed investments, as discussed above. This is
because losses brought forward would probably have cancelled any tax
liabilities in 2005 and 2006.

However, by proposing to transfer ¤10.6 million to the offshore account
over the period 2002–06, the company has effectively exaggerated the
cumulative losses in the local account by an equivalent sum. If IFO were in
future to offset its inflated losses against its profits, the Republic of the
Congo would be deprived of an estimated ¤4 million of corporate income
tax (currently levied at 38%).

The profit taxes calculated above for both Siforco and IFO may have been
avoided under the terms of tax exemptions granted to the companies by
the governments of the DRC and the Republic of the Congo. It remains
very doubtful, however, particularly in the case of Siforco, whether the two
companies did fully comply with the terms of their respective tax exemption
agreements. If that was the case then the companies might have been
liable to corporate income tax.tax liabilities might have fallen due.

Table 7 summarises our findings as to the revenue potentially lost to the
governments of the DRC and the Republic of the Congo through the
Danzer Group’s projected tax evasion (through under-invoiced trade
between Interholco and its subsidiaries Siforco and IFO) and possible non-
compliance with tax exemption agreements.

THE LOGGING MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT –
BALANCING THE CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
Industrial logging is promoted as a model for development because of its
notional contribution to government funds, notably for the provision of
essential public services. It is also promoted more recently, included by
the World Bank, as a means to mitigate climate change.120

Public health or private wealth?
The ongoing conflict in the DRC is considered the world’s deadliest
documented conflict since World War II: some 5.4 million people have
lost their lives through war-related causes in the country since 1998.121

Although a formal peace accord was signed in December 2002,
sporadic fighting has continued, and the International Rescue Committee
estimates that a further 45,000 lives are still being lost every month, and
that nearly half of those dying are children under five.122 The vast majority
die from non-violent causes such as malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia and
malnutrition – conditions that are easily preventable and treatable so long
as people have access to basic healthcare and nutritious food.123

Against this background of extreme poverty, it is clear that the
misappropriation of even relatively moderate sums, in corporate terms,
will have severe implications for the state’s potential to improve the
welfare of its people.

On the basis of the estimated tax revenues lost through the Danzer
Group’s projected tax evasion and assumed non-compliance with tax
exemption agreements, as shown in Table 7, the tax revenues
suspected lost from Siforco and IFO (a minimum of ¤7.8 million) would
be equivalent to any of the following, in 2000 prices:

± over 80% of the DRC Government’s investment in public healthcare

for the year 2000124

± the cost of vaccination for over 700,000 Congolese children under

five years of age125

± 50 times the DRC Ministry of Environment’s annual operating budget126

Climate protection or climate chaos?
There is a fundamental conflict between the industrial logging model of
development and protection of forest areas for climate protection. Even
so-called ‘selective logging’, as practiced in the DRC, causes
considerable greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions through fragmentation
and degradation of forest biomass. In the case of Siforco’s operations in
the DRC, the clearance for logging roads and infrastructure can cause
2.5 times more emissions than the selective logging itself.127

Table 8 shows that the projected carbon debt from Siforco’s selective
logging alone carries a potential financial liability (notional cost premium
for carbon offset) 1.5 times greater than the total forestry and export-
related taxes paid by the company in 2004. These figures do not include
GHG emissions from logging roads and infrastructure, nor those
associated with the timber removed from the forest.

If the carbon held in the timber extracted is included in the calculation,128
a further ¤1 million of potential offsets costs would need to be added,
making it nearly 2.5 times greaterthan the total forestry and export-
related taxes paid by the company in 2004.

The conclusion one can draw is that the value of DRC’s forests as a
carbon store is potentially greater than the tax revenues generated from
selective logging. International agreements to pay for protection of forest
areas for climate protection, and national industry regulations and taxes,
should reflect the true value of this resource.

6 DOES THE DANZER GROUP REPRESENT
AN ISOLATED CASE, OR IS UNDER-INVOICING
INDUSTRY-WIDE?

Here we give six separate comparisons that are a strong indication that the
phenomenon of tax evasion through under-invoicing of the sales value of
timber exported from the DRC and the Republic of the Congo is by no
means restricted to the Danzer Group. If other timber exporters were
declaring full FOB prices – reflecting the full market price in accordance
with the arm’s-length principle – the total value of exports would need to be
much greater than appears to be the case.

Comparison 1: national average log export values versus
Siforco’s local prices
According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report to the Danzer Group’s
Board of Directors discussed above, the DRC Government sets industry-
wide minimum prices for the export of timber that ‘are below production
cost and also below market price.’129 These minimum prices are the so-
called ‘prix mercurials’.130

If a large part of the timber sector in the DRC were exporting logs at below
market prices – using the prix mercurial as a basis for setting their export
values – then it should be expected that the overall average value per
cubic metre of logs exported would reflect such a below-market price.

Using export data published by the DRC Ministry of Environment for logs of
all species, Greenpeace International calculates an average FOB export
value for logs ranging from ¤131/m3 in 2002 to ¤153/m3 in 2004 and
2005 (see Table 9).

Assuming that the composition of the species exported by Siforco as logs
in 2004 was roughly the same as that of the species exported overall (as
both logs and sawn timber) by the company in 2003 (for which data is
available in the form of an Interholco shipping list132), the average declared
(under-invoiced) FOB export value of Siforco logs for 2004 can be
estimated at around ¤151/m3 (see Table 10). This figure is obviously very
close to the 2004 national average FOB value of ¤153/m3 given in Table 9.
The average market FOB export value of Siforco logs for 2004 can be
estimated at around ¤287/m3.

The implication is therefore that national average FOB prices do indeed
reflect widespread under-invoicing.

Comparison 2: ITTO published prices vs Siforco’s integrated
prices
Published industry-wide FOB export prices for the region are close to
Siforco’s true market (local plus offshore) FOB values shown in Table 10.

Log export prices for Francophone West African logs (B grade, FOB), as
published by the intergovernmental International Tropical Timber
Organisation (ITTO) in April 2004,133 were as follows: sapele – ¤244/m3;
sipo – ¤259/m3; iroko –¤309/m3.

Comparison 3: ITTO published prices vs average export value
of top traded DRC species
Using government export data available in 2006, Greenpeace International
has calculated an average FOB export value for six of the most traded
timber products (expressed as ‘Round Wood Equivalents’ (RWE)); see
Table 11. Together these species accounted for over 90% of DRC’s timber
exports by value.134

Table 11 indicates that the average export values of sapele, sipo, iroko and
tola are only slightly higher than Siforco’s local FOB value for logs in both
2004 and 2007.135 These smaller differences can be attributed to the fact
that the average FOB values in Table 11 cover both logs and processed
goods, while Table 10 covers logs only. In addition, processed goods are
sold at higher prices also when the calculation is based on RWE figures. In
relation to wenge, the greater price difference is probably due to most of
the exports being higher-valued sawn timber than unprocessed logs.

Furthermore, published industry-wide FOB log export prices for the region
indicates that the value of individual species exported (shown in Table 10)
are below true market value. Log export prices for Francophone West
African logs (B grade, FOB), as published by the ITTO in July 2006,136
were as follows: sapele – ¤229/m3; sipo – ¤259/m3; iroko – ¤259/m3.

Comparison 4: timber export values of the main foreign-
owned logging groups
Table 12 shows total FOB export values across for all timber products
(logs, sawn timber, veneer, etc) of the main foreign-owned logging groups
exporting from the DRC in 2006, provided by the DRC Direction de la
Gestion Forestière in a 2007 FAO report.137 This shows that the average
export values for the NST Group, Trans-M and Olam are actually lower than
Siforco’s average export values.

Furthermore, they are lower than the national average FOB prices (Table 9)
and Siforco local FOB value for logs in 2004 (Table 10). This is despite that
the figures in Table 12 include processed timber products, which should
have a higher value than the FOB log prices. For example, Siforco’s local
FOB value (2004) for sapele logs was ¤146.42/ m3, while sapele sawn
timber was ¤306 m3. Based on an average RWE conversion rate of 1.8 for
Africa,138 1m3 of sawn timber would the equivalent value of 1.8 m3 of logs
or ¤264 in RWE. Hence export values expressed as RWE, which include
sawn timber and veneers, should increase the average ¤/m3 value of
exports.

Comparison 5: Olam’s export vs market values
In the case of Olam, the company’s website discloses the true market
value for logs sourced for the financial year ending 30 June 2007:139

‘Olam sourced approximately 10,000 cubic meters of logs from DRC
valued at about US$5 million. This represents about 3% (log equivalent)
of the total estimated wood harvested in the country’.

The assumed average market value would be around ¤400/m3 (RWE),
almost three times greater than the average export value in Table 12.

Comparison 6: ITTO published national export values for
Republic of Congo
The ITTO Annual Review ‘compiles the most up-to-date and reliable
international statistics available on global production and trade of timber
with an emphasis on the tropics.’140 The 2008 report provides the latest
timber export figures provided by the Republic of the Congo Government.
The DRC Government did not provide any figures.141

Log export figures for the Republic of the Congo (Table 13) indicate that
the average national FOB values in 2004–06 were close to the national
average FOB values in the DRC for 2004–05 (Table 8). They are also
similar to the average declared (under-invoiced) FOB export value of
Siforco logs for 2004 (Table 9).

7 CONCLUSION – INTERNATIONAL DONORS STAND
BY WHILE THE CONGO’S WEALTH IS PLUNDERED
IN THE NAME OF DEVELOPMENT

‘The World Bank is not encouraging
commercial logging in DRC. Our main
advice to the DRC Government is NOT
to expand industrial logging, and NOT
to allocate any new concessions until
satisfactory standards of governance
and management are achieved in
existing concessions and the country
is able to enforce laws.’
World Bank website143

The Congo rainforests of Central Africa form the second largest rainforest
block on Earth after Amazonia. They are of incalculable importance for the
global climate and the planet’s biodiversity, as well as to the forest-dwelling
communities who depend on them for resources and livelihoods.

Fifty million hectares of rainforests in Central Africa are controlled by the
logging sector, with the vast majority of this area being in the DRC and the
Republic of the Congo.144 As elsewhere, endemic corruption and an
absence of government control145 have attracted the most unscrupulous
logging companies, providing a stimulus to further corruption.

In an environment of endemic corruption, logging companies inevitably
operate beyond the rule of law. In the Congo Basin, the logging industry
continues to feed the networks of corruption that are obstacles to genuine
development. Through support for an extractive industry-based model of
development, donor countries and agencies such as the World Bank are
effectively undermining their own rhetoric on establishing good governance
and alleviating poverty.

Within the DRC logging sector there are international companies from all
over the world, including France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal,
Switzerland, the USA, Lebanon and Singapore/India. The activities of these
companies have been documented in the Greenpeace International report
Carving up the Congo.146

In a context of corruption and weak governance in the DRC, the World
Bank and its donors have so far failed in its stated objectives of controlling
the expansion of industrial logging and improving governance of the sector.
In fact, some international donors are contemplating providing financial
incentives to the sector to help implement their expansion plans.

The central plank of the World Bank strategy is the ongoing legal review
process – initiated as long ago as 2005 – that aims to cancel logging titles
issued since the May 2002 moratorium prohibiting the awarding of new
titles and the extension and renewal of old ones, as well as those issued
prior to that date that are found to be non-compliant with the terms of the
original contract. One criterion of contract compliance is whether the
logging company has paid its forest area tax.147

However, the legal review does not concern itself with the other
economically important taxes to which the industry is liable, and so does
not tackle the issue of the evasion of these taxes by the logging groups
concerned. As documented in this report, logging companies can evade
paying tax by under-declaring the true market price of the timber they
export and/or their full turnover and profit.

While the World Bank and its donors continue to pour billions of taxpayers’
dollars into the DRC in the name of ‘working for a world free of poverty’,148
international players in the logging industry, such as the Danzer Group, are
laundering untaxed profits to offshore bank accounts.

If left unchecked, this unscrupulous behaviour will continue to make a
mockery of the international donor community’s poverty reduction efforts.
It poses a major challenge to the World Bank’s aim of tackling corruption
within the logging sector and ‘slow[ing] … the expansion of logging’.149
In effect, in being allowed to get away with evading tax, logging companies
are being given a financial incentive to continue expanding their operations
into some of the world’s last intact rainforests.

8 ACTION –
TIME TO CRACK DOWN ON CORRUPTION
AND STOP THE PLUNDER

THE WORLD BANK

‘Donors cannot go to their parliaments,
to their taxpayers, and say that we want
to support nations with millions of
dollars in aid when these very nations
are losing, through poor forest
management and governance, billions.’
Odin Knudsen, Senior Advisor,
Sustainable Development,
World Bank150

International donors, including the World Bank and the IMF, which have
the power and resources to lead change in the DRC and the Republic of
the Congo, must not permit these countries to repeat the dismal history
of other Central African states, where reliance on the short-term economics
of extractive export industries has only exacerbated political corruption
and poverty.

Indeed, it is time the donor community realised that the industrial logging
model of development does not work in a context of existing poor
governance and does not generate the desired long-term economic, social
and environmental benefits. Good governance principles must ensure that
the money delivers long-term economic, social and environmental benefits
and that these aims are not undermined by international companies flouting
the rule of law.

WHAT DO THE DRC GOVERNMENT AND
THE WORLD BANK NEED TO DO?
The DRC Government and the World Bank must prevent further
expansion of industrial logging until comprehensive social and
environmental land use planning has been conducted and basic
governance and anti-corruption measures have been established.
To this end they must:

± maintain and enforce the May 2002 moratorium on the awarding of

new logging titles and the extension and renewal of old ones
± halt the expansion of existing or planned logging operations and

infrastructure into intact forest landscapes and other key identified
conservation areas

± cancel all illegally awarded and non-compliant titles, including those

in breach of the moratorium or the DRC’s Forestry Code

± impose punitive measures against companies and individuals who

undermine the rule of law in the DRC, including by abuse of the transfer
pricing process

WHAT DO INTERNATIONAL DONOR
GOVERNMENTS NEED TO DO?
International donor governments must prevent further fraudulent
expatriation of wealth and profits from the DRC and the Republic of
the Congo by companies engaged in tax evasion, capital flight and
aggressive tax avoidance. To this end they must:

± demand that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)151
establish a requirement for all multinational companies to report their
trading activities on a country-by-country basis within their consolidated
accounts. This approach would identify a group’s internal and external
income and costs in each country where it operates, hence minimising
the risk of transfer pricing abuse occurring. Such a requirement on the
part of the IASB would have the status of international law, and would
thus not require local legislative consent152

Greenpeace is committed to stopping climate change.

We campaign to protect the world’s remaining ancient

We investigate, expose and confront the trade in
products causing forest destruction and climate change.

We challenge governments and industry to end their
role in forest destruction and climate change.

We support the rights of forest peoples.
