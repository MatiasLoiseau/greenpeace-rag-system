In recent years, the world’s biggest companies
have woken up to the environmental costs
associated with palm oil and the other
commodities they buy. Nowhere are those
costs more evident than in Indonesia, which
has lost 31 million hectares of forest, an area
almost the size of Germany, since 1990.1
Indonesia’s plantation sectors – pulp, palm
oil and timber – are driving this catastrophic
forest destruction.

Many consumer goods companies, along with
the commodity traders that supply them,
have committed to remove deforestation from
their supply chains. These commitments are
promising, but forest destruction is actually
increasing in Indonesia.2 In fact, Indonesia
is reported to have surpassed Brazil as the
country with the world’s highest rate of
deforestation.3 Greenpeace analysis indicates
that the palm oil industry is a leading cause
of deforestation and peatland destruction.4
The situation is made worse by deep-seated,
systemic problems, including legal barriers and
the absence of published concession maps
that show who controls forested land.

GREENPEACE CUTTING DEFORESTATION OUT OF THE PALM OIL SUPPLY CHAINThis all presents a serious challenge to
companies that source commodities
from Indonesia. They have promised their
customers and other stakeholders that they
will ensure the palm oil they buy is not linked
to deforestation. Yet our analysis shows that
companies have yet to take control of their
supply chains and are unable to say with
any confidence that the palm oil they use
is not driving the destruction of rainforests,
threatening endangered species or contributing
to social conflicts in Indonesia.

In 2015, Indonesia was wracked by the worst
forest fires for almost twenty years. The
disaster, the result of decades of forest and
peatland destruction, thrust Indonesia’s
plantation industries into the global spotlight.
The fires shrouded Southeast Asia in a thick,
choking smoke that is expected to have lasting
health impacts across the region and on many
days in October and November emitted more
greenhouse gases than the entire United

Smoke rising from smouldering peatland in a palm oil
concession. Fires in drained peatland are a perennial problem.

States.5 Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the head of
Indonesia’s National Disaster Mitigation Agency
(BNPB), described the crisis as ‘a crime against
humanity of extraordinary proportions’.6

As public outcry over the scale of the
fires grew, Indonesia’s president Joko
Widodo announced ambitious new plans
to mitigate against future fires by protecting
Indonesia’s peatlands.7 This includes a
new Peat Restoration Agency tasked with
enforcing a moratorium on further peatland
development, as well as the restoration of
land burned during the 2015 fires. However,
many of the systemic barriers to corporate
‘no deforestation’ policies, such as the lack
of public land tenure maps, also stand in the
way of the government delivering its vision
of peatland protection. Companies must
seize this opportunity to solve the problems
in their supply chain, by working with the
Indonesian government on transparency
and legislative reform.

PROGRESS TOWARDS
DEFORESTATION-FREE
SUPPLY CHAINS IS SLOW

In December 2015, Greenpeace surveyed
14 global consumer goods manufacturers
with ‘no deforestation’ policies in place,
including snack food, confectionary and
personal care companies. We wanted to
understand the practical actions that these
companies are taking to implement their
policies, and the impact those actions are
having on the ground in Indonesia.

The responses we received reveal there is
a considerable amount of work to be done
before companies have deforestation-free
supply chains. None of the companies we
surveyed are able to say with any certainty
that there is no deforestation in their palm
oil supply chain. Most companies are unable
even to say how much of their palm oil comes
from suppliers that comply with their own
sourcing standards.

Furthermore:

•	 Only one of the 14 companies surveyed –

Ferrero – can trace nearly 100% of its palm
oil back to the plantation it is grown on.
•	 Most companies have yet to start obtaining
independent third-party verification to
demonstrate that their palm oil is produced
by companies operating in compliance with
their own ‘no deforestation’ policies.
•	 None publish a full list of their palm oil

suppliers, although some do publish lists of
top suppliers.

•	 None publish a list of suppliers that they
have ceased purchasing from due to
finding evidence of rainforest clearance, or
other breaches of policy.

At the same time, there are substantial
differences in company performance, even
from companies within the same sector.
Several of the companies we spoke to have
yet to fully trace their palm oil back to the mill
– a critical milestone on the way to tackling
deforestation. Many are still relying on false
solutions such as GreenPalm certificates,
instead of taking meaningful steps towards
ensuring that the physical oil they buy is not
linked to forest destruction.

Some companies are making significant
progress. A few have changed their
purchasing and are trying to take control
over their supply chain by predominantly
buying physically certified Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) palm oil. Others
are succeeding in tracing large volumes of
the oil they buy back to the plantation where
it was grown. While neither of these actions
is proof that suppliers are not responsible for
deforestation, each can be an interim step
towards understanding and remedying supply
chain problems.

4

GREENPEACE CUTTING DEFORESTATION OUT OF THE PALM OIL SUPPLY CHAINHOW EACH COMPANY
WAS ASSESSED

To understand how much progress each
company has made towards a deforestation-
free supply chain, we considered three criteria:

•	 Responsible	sourcing – the practical steps
each company is taking towards ensuring
that the palm oil it buys is not linked to
deforestation.

•	 Transparency – how open each company is
about its palm oil suppliers, including how
it is tackling suppliers that breach its ‘no
deforestation’ policy.
Industry	reform – how each company is
supporting wider industry reform.

•

We then assessed the actions that companies
are taking, giving each a qualitative score
based on its performance across each
criterion, including an assessment of publicly
available policies and reports. Finally, each
company received an overall score. We
weighted ‘Responsible sourcing’ higher than
‘Transparency’ and ‘Industry Reform’, although
all three are important.

Responsible	sourcing

Given the rate of deforestation in Indonesia,
we expect to see strong action from companies
to ensure their suppliers are protecting
rainforests and peatlands. This includes:

•

tracing palm oil (or palm oil derivatives) to
known sources, first to the mill and then to
the plantation;

•	 confirming that suppliers are complying
with ‘no deforestation’ commitments
by obtaining independent third-party
verification to best practice standards – the
standards of the Palm Oil Innovation Group
(POIG)8 or equivalent;

•	 having a clear process for dealing with
non-compliant suppliers and taking
action against those that are found to
have breached ‘no deforestation’ policies,
including excluding those that don’t change
their behaviour;

•	 phasing out GreenPalm certificates in
favour of obtaining physical certified
RSPO palm oil, as an interim step towards
independent third-party verification to best
practice standards.

A company is said to be on track towards
meeting its ‘no deforestation’ policies if it is
making considerable progress towards tracing
its palm oil to the plantation where it was
sourced, if it has started to obtain independent
third-party verification that its suppliers are
complying with its ‘no deforestation’ policy,

5

GREENPEACE CUTTING DEFORESTATION OUT OF THE PALM OIL SUPPLY CHAINand if the majority of its palm oil is physically
certified. Purchasing physically certified oil
(Segregated or Identity Preserved) is seen as an
interim step towards full third-party verification
of ‘no deforestation’ commitments, using the
High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) Toolkit9
and the standards of the POIG Charter.10

A company is considered to be making
some progress towards meeting its ‘no
deforestation’ policies if it is primarily
sourcing Mass Balance palm oil, if it is
identifying and engaging non-compliant
suppliers, and if it is tracing the majority of its
palm oil to the mill and using this information
for mill-based risk assessments.

A company is considered to be failing where
it is making slow progress towards tracing
its palm oil to the mill, it is still reliant on
GreenPalm certificates, is relying on RSPO
certification as verification of their ‘no
deforestation’ policies and can show no other
meaningful action to reduce its exposure to
deforestation.

Transparency

Deforestation in Indonesia (and elsewhere) is
exacerbated by the absence of transparency
regarding land tenure and corporate
ownership. This makes it difficult to be certain
that palm oil producers have stopped clearing
forests. The Indonesian government has again
promised to publish land tenure information
through its OneMap initiative, but this is still
several years away from completion.

In the absence of official geospatial
information on suppliers, companies should
push suppliers to publish concession maps
covering their entire operations, which is
now a requirement of RSPO membership.
They should also publicly disclose supplier
information – including mills, plantations and
refineries – and require suppliers to do the
same. Companies that are transparent about
all or some of their suppliers score highest on
our survey. Those that do not publish their
supplier information but are willing to share
it with civil society stakeholders are making
decent progress.

Companies that refuse to provide any
information about their suppliers are
considered to be failing.

Industry	Reform

Companies cannot break the link between
deforestation and commodity production
without going beyond their own supply
chains and pushing for sectoral reform.
We expect to see companies working
together to establish and enforce high
minimum standards for palm oil production.
These include:

•	 Supporting the HCS Approach as the

one credible methodology for identifying
and protecting tropical forests in
Indonesia. Consumer goods companies
whose ‘no deforestation’ commitments
explicitly include implementation of
the HCS Approach (as opposed to
alternative methodologies such as
the industry-led Sustainable Palm Oil
Manifesto High Carbon Stock Study11) are
upholding strong industry standards to
halt deforestation.

•	 Joining the POIG to help build the

business case for responsibly-produced
palm oil grown to the highest standards.

•	 Clearly stating that ‘no deforestation’

standards apply across suppliers’ entire
operations, including third-party suppliers
and joint venture partners, and not just to
the physical oil a company buys.

In future, successful implementation of the
HCS Approach and insistence that policies
must apply across suppliers’ entire operations
should be seen as crucial indicators of a
company’s progress towards implementing its
‘no deforestation’ policy.

There are a few industry-wide initiatives that
we believe have some potential to transform
the palm oil sector: the New York Declaration
on Forests (NYDF),12 membership of the
Tropical Forest Alliance,13 membership of
the UNDP Sustainable Palm Oil Initiative,14
or taking a leadership role in the Consumer
Goods Forum’s palm oil working group.
Our assessment of participation in these is
cumulative and focuses on leadership actions
across the industry, so companies participating
in more than two of these multi-stakeholder
bodies are seen as making decent progress
towards industry transformation.

Companies with very little or no participation
are failing in this category.

RESULTS

Colgate-Palmolive, a US personal care
manufacturer whose brands include Speed
Stick, has a policy that excludes deforestation
across multiple commodities, not just palm
oil. However, there is weak evidence that its
palm oil is deforestation-free. Colgate remains
reliant on GreenPalm certificates, which do
nothing to ensure that the palm oil it buys is
not linked to deforestation.

Colgate cannot trace any of its palm
oil back to the plantation, and even
though more than half of its palm oil is
traceable to the mill, that is insufficient
progress when compared with other
companies in the sector. Colgate does
not disclose any information about its
suppliers, nor has it joined any industry
transformation initiatives.

Danone, a French food company whose brands
include Dannon and Cow & Gate, is making
strong Responsible sourcing. Its palm oil
volumes are 100 per cent traceable to the mill,
but not yet to the plantation. Its supply is 100
per cent RSPO Segregated. Some suppliers
are audited, although this is not a requirement
of its policy.

As a member of the POIG, Danone should
continue its role as an industry leader by
disclosing a complete list of known suppliers
and sub-suppliers, including the location and
names of mills, plantations and refineries.
It should also publish a time-bound action
plan to have its suppliers third-party verified
against best practice standards.

Rocher and Nutella, purchases palm oil
volumes that are both fully traceable to
plantation level and fully RSPO Segregated.
It is a member of the POIG, with an explicit
commitment to the HCSA. Ferrero should
disclose a complete list of known suppliers

and sub-suppliers, including the location and
names of mills, plantations and refineries.

The next step is for Ferrero to publish a
time-bound action plan to have its suppliers
third-party verified against a high standard,
such as those contained in the POIG Charter.

General Mills, a US manufacturer whose
brands include Betty Crocker and
Cascadian Farm, has near full traceability to
mill, but does not trace oil to the plantation
level. The majority of its RSPO-certified
oil is Mass Balance, but its palm oil is not
verified by an independent third-party to
best practice standards.

General Mills publicly discloses its top three
suppliers and we encourage it to go further by
disclosing a complete list of known suppliers and
sub-suppliers, including the location and names
of mills, plantations and refineries. It participates
in a few initiatives to transform the industry, but
should take on additional leadership by requiring
compliance across suppliers’ entire operations.

in its candles and in some food products and
snacks, has a near fully RSPO Segregated
supply, and a phase-out strategy for the small
remainder of palm oil covered by GreenPalm
certificates. IKEA should now focus on
ensuring that its suppliers are going beyond
RSPO by obtaining credible, third-party
verification to POIG or equivalent standards.

IKEA is a member of the UNDP Sustainable
Palm Oil Initiative, but needs to increase
its support for industry transformation.
We recommend it discloses a complete
list of known suppliers and sub-suppliers,
including the location and names of mills,
plantations and refineries, and apply its
‘no deforestation’ policy to its suppliers’
entire operations.

Johnson & Johnson, a US manufacturer of
personal care brands including Neutrogena and
Aveeno, has little understanding of the risks
in its supply chain. Its traceability to the mill is
poor. Johnson & Johnson needs to accelerate
its traceability programme and move beyond
the RSPO to meet its ‘no deforestation’
commitment. However, it has excluded a
supplier due to concerns over non-compliance.

Its policy explicitly references the HCS
Approach and it participates in some
initiatives to achieve wider sectoral
reform. Johnson & Johnson does not
publicly disclose its supplier list. It
should disclose a complete list of known
suppliers and sub-suppliers, including the
location and names of mills, plantations
and refineries.

whose brands include Pringles and Pop-
Tarts, has some traceability to plantation and
high traceability to mill, alongside a strong
transparent and time-bound procedure for
working with non-compliant suppliers, plus
public disclosure of their top three suppliers.

However, the majority of the palm
oil it sources is RSPO Mass Balance.

The company should be requiring
independent third-party auditing to best
practice standards rather than relying
on RSPO to verify its ‘no deforestation’
commitments, and its policies and
monitoring need to apply across its
suppliers’ entire operations. Kellogg
Company is a signatory to the NYDF, but
it should increase participation in other
initiatives to transform the industry.

Mars, a US confectionary manufacturer, has
a strong policy that requires compliance
across suppliers’ entire operations, not
just the palm oil they supply to Mars. It has
good traceability of its palm oil supply to
mills, but needs to continue traceability
work to the plantation and start obtaining

independent verification that its suppliers
comply with its ‘no deforestation’ policy.
It publicly discloses its top four suppliers,
but should now publish a complete list
of known suppliers and sub-suppliers,
including the location and names of mills,
plantations and refineries.

manufacturer whose brands include
Cadbury, Nabisco and Oreo, has a strong
policy that requires its suppliers to comply
with its ‘no deforestation’ policy for all its
operations at group level, rather than solely
for the physical oil they sell to Mondelez.
Additionally, it is proactively excluding non-
compliant suppliers.

However, Mondelez is still reliant on GreenPalm
certificates. The company needs to phase
out GreenPalm, improve its traceability to the
plantation, and obtain independent third-party
verification that its suppliers are meeting its
‘no deforestation’ policy. It should also disclose
a complete list of known suppliers and sub-
suppliers, including the location and names of
mills, plantations and refineries.

Nestlé, the Swiss food and beverage giant
whose brands include Dreyer’s and Toll House,
has substantial traceability of its palm oil to the
plantation level, notable given its high volume
of supply. It is participating in initiatives to
reform the palm oil industry and publicly
discloses three of its suppliers.

Nestlé should show further leadership
by disclosing a complete list of known

suppliers and sub-suppliers, including the
location and names of mills, plantations
and refineries, and ensure its policy is
applied across its suppliers’ operations.
Nestlé is working with implementation
partners to determine whether its suppliers
meet its palm oil policy. The next step is to
publish a time-bound action plan to have
its suppliers verified by an independent
third party.

company that also owns global brands
such as MTR margarine in India, has
relatively low traceability to mill, and a low
proportion of RSPO certified oil. However,
it is proactively engaging its suppliers and
deselecting those without credible ‘no
deforestation’ policies.

Orkla also supports the HCS Approach
and references it in its sourcing policy.
The company should now publish a complete
list of known suppliers and sub-suppliers,
including the location and names of mills,
plantations and refineries, and make progress
on obtaining independent third-party
verification to best practice standards.

PepsiCo, the US-based snack food
manufacturer whose brands include Frito-
Lay, has no evidence that its palm oil is
deforestation-free. It is almost entirely
reliant on GreenPalm certificates and its
traceability to mill is below its competitors.

PepsiCo should immediately
phase out GreenPalm and obtain

independent verification that its
suppliers are complying with its
‘no deforestation’ policy. It should
publish a complete list of known
suppliers and sub-suppliers,
including the location and names
of mills, plantations and refineries,
and require its suppliers to apply its
policy across their operations.

goods company whose brands include Head
& Shoulders and Olay, has strong progress
on traceability to the mill, though it has
not yet begun plantation-level traceability.
It has an explicit commitment to the HCS
Approach and has joined the HCS Approach
Steering Group.

Procter & Gamble should now ensure its
suppliers comply with its ‘no deforestation’
policy by obtaining third-party verification to
best practice standards. It should also publish
a complete list of known suppliers and sub-
suppliers, including the location and names of
mills, plantations and refineries, and report on
non-compliant supplier engagement.

Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer goods
company whose brands include Dove
soap and Flora margarine, remains reliant
on GreenPalm certificates and has low
traceability to mill when compared with
other companies in its sector. However, it has
recently built a fractionation plant in North
Sumatra to gain full traceability to plantation
of that supply.

Unilever needs to rapidly phase out Greenpalm
and obtain third-party verification that its

suppliers are meeting its ‘no deforestation’
commitments. It should publish a complete
list of known suppliers and sub-suppliers,
including the location and names of mills,
plantations and refineries, and apply its policy
across its suppliers’ operations. Unilever
actively supports the HCS Approach Steering
Group but has also supported the competing
Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto HCS Study. It
should therefore make clear that it expects
suppliers to use the HCS Approach when
implementing its policy.

SOLUTIONS

As we embarked upon our survey, it was clear
that the companies we spoke to had good
intentions. Some are making a concerted
effort to create change on the ground. At
the same time, major brands are still a long
way from being able to demonstrate that the
palm oil they buy is not driving deforestation
in Indonesia. Most do not anticipate being
deforestation-free until 2020. This is nowhere
near urgent enough, given how rapidly
Indonesia’s forests are being converted to
palm oil plantations.

This year must mark a turning point for the
palm oil industry. So far, companies have
been focusing on tracing the palm oil they
buy to the mill and then to the plantation
where it was grown. That is just the first
step towards addressing the problems in
companies’ palm oil supply chains. In 2016,
companies need to start actively monitoring
their suppliers for deforestation, peatland
destruction, labour issues and social conflicts
– and should take swift action against
persistent offenders.

Brands cannot do this alone. Working with
a second-party implementation partner can
help a company understand the risks in its

supply chains, and we encourage companies
to consider engaging consultants to help
them meet the goals that they have set.
However, we still expect all companies to
obtain independent third-party verification
to best practice standards, such as those
contained in the POIG Charter, and report
transparently on their progress. In the coming
months, we expect all companies to publish a
clear protocol for tackling suppliers that are
unwilling to conform to these standards.

Last year’s forest fires started a much-needed
conversation about how Indonesia should
manage its plantation sectors. President
Jokowi and senior government ministers have
called for peatland protection and forest
restoration as part of a package of measures
aimed at preventing another disaster. This will
only succeed if companies that buy palm oil
are prepared to back these reforms and work
with the government to make the plantation
sector more transparent and accountable.
Thinking longer term, companies need to
work together on a common vision for forest
restoration and best practice in peatland
management, and on special measures to
support smallholders and create incentives for
forest conservation.
