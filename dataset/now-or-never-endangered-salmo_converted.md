Linking the Forest and the Sea

The aboriginal civilization of this coast was made

possible because it arose at the intersection of a

high-volume energy exchange between the earth(cid:213)s

hydrographic sphere and the earth(cid:213)s terrestrial sphere,

an exchange between land and sea, in the form

of protein, carbon, nitrogen and other life-giving

nutrients (cid:209) hundreds of thousands of tonnes of

marine biomass, every year for thousands of years (cid:209)

in the bodies of salmon. All this energy was carried

back and forth across the northern hemisphere

of the planet, between the depths of the ocean and the

continent(cid:213)s interior, in predictable, ancient cycles.

By the time of the first European explorers, what had

evolved from all of this was a huge arc of temperate

rainforest from Northern California to Southeast

Alaska, and a complex of rich marine ecosystems at

the rainforest(cid:213)s edge.

The Failure of the Te c h n o - F i x

In the early years of colonization and settlement, little

thought was given to such things; salmon, like the

forests, were considered an inexhaustible resource.

When declines in salmon abundance were observed

in the earliest years of the industrial fisheries, govern-

ments responded with artificial propagation, such as

hatcheries. Hatcheries were seen as the solution to

the problem of habitat destruction, and forests were

cleared without regard to the impacts upon salmon

runs. It is only in recent years that fisheries scientists

have shown that hatcheries cannot replace wild

salmon, and in many cases, hatcheries have hastened

declines in the biological diversity and abundance

of wild salmon. Similarly, it is only in recent years

that science has provided conclusive evidence that

industrial forestry practices routinely and unavoidably

disrupt ecosystem functions that are vital to the

protection of salmon.

An Infinte Va r i e t y

All salmon require stable and productive spawning

habitat, but that is just a small part of the picture.

Different salmon species rely on freshwater environ-

ments in different ways, for different purposes.

Similarly, runs within each species have evolved in

different directions, and spend varying amounts

of time within watersheds, and at different zones

within those watersheds, from the estuaries to the

headwaters.

Sockeye almost always spawn in streams that feed

lakes, and will spend from a year to three years in a

lake before heading to sea. Pink salmon spawn almost

exclusively at two years of age, and, like chum

salmon, their fry head to sea almost immediately after

hatching. Chum salmon spawn almost exclusively

in coastal streams and in the lower reaches of rivers,

only a few kilometres from the sea; coho are more

or less the same. Coho, however, spend up to a year

in their natal streams, and in nearby rivers, before

heading to sea.

Chinook salmon defy generalization. They have

been known to reach 45 kilograms in size, although

they(cid:213)re usually much smaller. Some precocious males

have been known to attempt spawning after spending

their entire lives without leaving their home rivers.

Chinook usually spend a few months in freshwater

before heading to sea.

For every salmon run that fits the textbook descrip-

tion for its species, there is another, from the same

species, that does things a little differently. All that

can be said of these fish is that they are

(cid:210)anadramous,(cid:211) which means they(cid:213)re sea-run fish, and

they(cid:213)re (cid:210)semelparous,(cid:211) which means they die shortly

after spawning (cid:209) except for steelhead.

Once thought to be of the genus Salmo, steelhead

are now generally held to be among the

Oncorhynchus species, with the rest of the coast(cid:213)s

salmon. Steelhead, unlike the rest, can spawn more

than once.

Salmon are often believed to spawn only in the

autumn. In fact, there isn(cid:213)t a month of the year when

salmon are not spawning somewhere on the coast.

There isn(cid:213)t a forest on this coast that has not been

home to salmon. Salmon are there, always, in the

forest. The (cid:210)forest,(cid:211) however, is a term that requires

some definition. It not only includes trees, but

also plants, animals, birds and fish. The west coast

temperate rainforest, particularly, is a complex

of inter-related systems and processes, all of which

contribute to healthy salmon habitat. It is about

geology, hydrology and ecology.

Water for Life

The geological and hydrological components of

healthy salmon habitat include high-elevation gulleys

and rivulets, natural springs, ground water seepage

and discharge sites, porous soils, and sources of

substrates and sediments that release cobbles and

allow the steady recruitment of gravel supplies

for salmon spawning beds. The Pacific coast is an

assemblage of watersheds, and the shape and form of

the land itself is related to the watersheds(cid:213) biological

components, such as root systems, which prevent

erosion and regulate waterflow, and forest canopies,

which trap moisture and provide cool, wet micro-

climates. The movement of water through forest

ecosystems determines where skunk cabbage grows,

how dense the devil(cid:213)s club is, and how productive

and healthy the (cid:210)riparian(cid:211) zone is.

A watershed(cid:213)s riparian zone is more than just a

riverbank. It is the intersection between the terrestrial

ecosystem and the aquatic ecosystem, the critical,

narrow corridor of nutrient flow between the moun-

tains and the sea.

In the coastal temperate rainforest, the riparian

zone is often characterized by plant communities that

have become adapted to high soil moisture, and the

vegetation is more diverse than anywhere in the

watershed. The riparian forest is composed of cedar,

hemlock, fir, alder, maple, spruce and cottonwood.

The understorey is dense with salmonberry, Indian

plum, ferns and vine maple. It is the busiest place on

The Impact of Industrial

Forest Practices

A History of Sustainable Harv e s t s

For thousands of years, aboriginal societies harvested

timber. The native people of the coast lived in

cavernous, cedar-plank longhouses, and went to sea in

huge, ocean-going canoes. Smokehouses, community

buildings, mortuary poles and heraldic poles were

all built from the wood of the west coast temperate

rainforest, as were intricately carved chests, storage

boxes and cooking vessels. Just as important was

the processing of cedar bark for basketry, clothing,

and a variety of household goods.

Apart from minor operations (cid:209) mainly those

undertaken by the Hudson(cid:213)s Bay Company and the

Royal Engineers (cid:209) commercial logging in British

Columbia did not begin until after the Fraser River

goldrush of 1858. In the early years of the industry,

deforestation and salmon-habitat damage tended

to be localized and fairly small-scale by today(cid:213)s

standards. Logging was dangerous and labour inten-

sive, and relied on simple technologies, donkeys,

growth foreclosed and opportunity lost.”

— D r. Michael Soule, Department of Environmental Studies,

University of California at Santa Cruz, Greenpeace video, August, 1998

Steam-powered log-hauling equipment radically

altered the industry, as did the use of railroads to

carry logs to tidewater. It was not until after World

War II that large-scale logging began to cut deep into

the landscape, aided by gas-powered saws, logging

trucks, and networks of roadways that cut deeper into

the forest every year. As the easily-accessible timber

dwindled, roads were punched further up the moun-

tainsides and deeper into the coastal inlets.

Decades of Mounting Destruction

Damage of this kind is not limited to the brief

duration of logging activity, but can continue to cause

cumulative and persistent damage over several

decades.

The proximity of logging to a salmon-bearing

stream is a factor that determines only the time it will

take for impacts to become evident. When an ancient

forest is removed from a mountainside, it may take

years for the root systems of the former forest to

finally give way in landslides that expose steep slopes

to barren rock that had been covered since the last ice

age. (cid:210)Torrenting(cid:211) in high-elevation gulleys disrupts

the hydrology of watersheds that had been stable for

thousands of years.

The size of a clearcut is also often irrelevant to

impacts clearcutting produces. Studies in Oregon

watersheds, conducted over a 34-year-period, demon-

strate that there is little difference between the health

of watersheds that have been completely clearcut and

watersheds that have been subjected to only 25%

clearcutting. In both cases, water volume and velocity

during peak discharges were 50% higher than they

were prior to clearcutting, and abnormal surges

in volume and velocity persisted for 25 years after

logging had been completed.

Road Construction: Building a Path to Crisis

It is not just the cutting of trees that disrupts soil

stability and watershed hydrology. Logging roads

often do just as much damage. Logging and road

building, even in side valleys, produce downstream

impacts in salmon habitat that are not confined to the

tributaries. Mud and sediments choke the tributaries,

and bedload sediments are carried into the main-

stream river. Creeks and rivers suffer (cid:210)blowout(cid:211)(cid:209)

A New Era in Forestry ?

The Forest Practices Code was presented as the

foundation for a (cid:210)new era(cid:211) in forest practices in the

province. The BC government spent hundreds of

thousands of dollars on television, radio and news-

paper advertisements, pledging that the Forest

Practices Code would significantly restrict the way

logging would be allowed. One such advertisement, in

a December, 1993 edition of The Vancouver Province

newspaper, boasted: (cid:210)The massive clearcutting of the

past will no longer be acceptable. And in sensitive

areas (cid:209) such as wildlife habitat areas and near fish-

bearing streams (cid:209) clearcuts will be outlawed.(cid:211)

When the Forest Practices Code was unveiled, BC(cid:213)s

premier was Mike Harcourt. He repeatedly assured

weary voters, and skeptical observers in the United

States and Europe, that the logging(cid:213)s bad old days

were gone. At the Globe 94 Conference in Vancouver,

Mr. Harcourt said: (cid:210)We are reducing the size of

clearcuts, and we are banning clearcuts where neces-

sary to protect critical wildlife habitat, fish-bearing

streams and other sensitive forest values.(cid:211) In July,

1994, the Washington Times reported: (cid:210)Wide chunks

of forest the size of football fields are no longer cut.(cid:211)

The Forest Practices Code of British Columbia Act

was finally adopted in 1995. Mindful that Canada(cid:213)s

international reputation had been badly tarnished by

television images of denuded coastal mountains and

frequent protests by environmentalists, Canadian

embassies praised the new regime. California consul-

general Robert Richard, in a March, 1996 letter to

Santa Monica city council, hailed BC(cid:213)s new forest

regime as (cid:210)replacing conventional logging methods

with new leading edge approaches.(cid:211)

The British Columbia public believed that the

Forest Practices Code would severely curtail clearcut-

ting. In a November, 1996 poll conducted for the

Sierra Legal Defence Fund, 71.6 of respondents said

they believed clearcutting had either been brought to

an end in the province, or was being phased out, or

was otherwise rarely employed as a logging practice.

Unfortunately, nothing of the kind had happened.

Clearcutting continued much as it had before, with

one noteworthy exception. As Premier Harcourt and

other high-profile salesmen of the Code repeatedly

said, the size of individual clearcuts was coming

down. What they didn(cid:213)t say was that this was arguably

worse for the environment than what was previously

the case.

Because the province continued to allow companies

to log the same volume of trees as before, all that

smaller clearcuts accomplished was to fragment a

wider area of land. More roads and more cut blocks

were required to get the same amount of wood out.

That means that until the government reduces the

wildlife will continue.

¥ According to a report by internationally renowned

conservation biologist Dr. Michael Soule, up to 45% of the

temperate rainforest should be deferred from logging until

we can determine exactly how much is needed to protect

rare and threatened species from extinction. Otherwise,

Dr. Soule maintains, if B.C. continues with the policy of

protecting only 12% of the land base, up to 50% of the

rainforest(cid:213)s species could be threatened with extinction.

¥ Greenpeace is calling for protection of the remaining

large, intact coastal temperate rainforest valleys and an

end to industrial clearcutting and the construction of new

roads in B.C.(cid:213)s ancient temperate rainforests.

¥ Greenpeace is calling for immediate improvements in

both the standards and enforcement of the Forest Practices

Code throughout B.C. To ensure the survival of salmon

runs at risk, it is imperative that riparian protection

zones in B.C. be immediately upgraded to standards

equivalent to those in place in Washington State.

Riparian protection zones of 100 metres are essential for

all fish bearing rivers and protection zones of 50 metres

minimum are required for all feeder creeks and streams.

spawners, in 1996 it had dropped to 250. Sockeye salmon do

run in cycles, with low years and high years, but overall

the Dallary Creek escapement numbers continue to decline.
