CHEMICALS IN PERFUME REPORT |  3executive summary
The goal of this investigation was to quantify the use of two
groups of chemicals – phthalates and synthetic musks – in a
random selection of perfume brands. Greenpeace commissioned a
laboratory to test 36 brands of eau de toilette and eau de parfumfor levels of the two chemical groups.The results confirm that
some synthetic musks, most notably the polycyclic musksgalaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN), and some phthalates,
especially diethyl phthalate (DEP), are widely used by theperfume industry.This suggests that regular use of perfumes couldsubstantially contribute  to individuals’ daily exposure to these
chemicals, some of which have already been recorded ascontaminants in blood and breast milk. Furthermore, there isincreasing evidence of potential endocrine-disrupting properties
for certain musk compounds. In this context, these results
reinforce the need for legislation that will drive the replacement of hazardous substances with safer alternatives.The currentdevelopment of new EU legislation on the manufacture and use 
of chemicals, known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation andAuthorisation of Chemicals), provides the opportunity to set out
requirements for such substitution as a vital contribution toprotecting the public from exposure to hazardous chemicals.

4|  CHEMICALS IN PERFUME REPORTintroduction
The widespread use of hazardous chemicals, combined with lack of
adequate information and government control, has brought us to thechemical crisis we face today. In so many aspects of our daily lives,we use and release into the environment, often inadvertently, a widerange of chemicals.The hazards posed by the majority of these
substances have never been properly assessed. At the same time,current legislation fails to control exposure even to chemicals thatare known to possess hazardous properties, irrespective of whethersafer alternatives already exist. As a consequence, from remote,inaccessible regions of the globe to the domestic environment, we
find increasing evidence of chemical contamination.
Wild animals from the Arctic to the deep sea (Law 
et al. 2003,
Lebeuf et al. 2004, Martin et al. 2004, Rayne et al. 2004, de Boer
et al. 1998), rainwater (ter Schure and Larsson 2002, Peters
2003), dust in our homes (Rudel et al. 2003, Santillo et al.
2003a,b), and even our own bodies (WWF 2004, Peters 2004)have all been shown to be polluted with hazardous industrialchemicals.These chemicals are now so ubiquitous that a baby isexposed to industrial chemicals before he or she is even born
(Dorey 2003). Chemicals that persist and build up in our bodies(bioaccumulate), that may be capable of causing cancers or otheradverse health effects that may even interfere at a fundamentallevel with hormone communication systems and their role indevelopment pose unknown consequences for our future (Darnerud
2003, Sharpe and Skakkebaek 2003, Dorey 2003).
But while the occurrence of hazardous man-made chemicals in the
environment and in our bodies is increasingly widely documented,few of us are aware that many of these chemicals are ingredients ineveryday consumer products. Chemicals used as flame-retardants inelectronics products such as mobile phones, computers or televisions
can contaminate a mother’s milk (Lind 
et al. 2003, Kalantzi et al.2004). Substances used in the plastic-coated prints sometimesfound on children’s pyjamas (Greenpeace 2004) are capable of
interfering with development, hormone communication and immune
system function in animals (Kergosien and Rice 1998, Chitra 
et al.
2002, Kumasaka et al. 2002, Adeoya-Osiguwa et al. 2003).
As part of an ongoing project investigating hazardous chemicals in
consumer products, Greenpeace has commissioned an independentlaboratory to analyse a wide range of products for potentiallyharmful substances. (see http://www.greenpeace.org/chemprodreportand http://www.greenpeace.org/addproducts) Greenpeace has alsoreviewed the actions and policies of a number of consumer goodsmanufacturers to evaluate their use of and measures to eliminatepotentially hazardous chemicals from their products.The goodnews is that a growing number of companies are taking positiveand proactive steps to replace such chemicals from a variety ofconsumer items, ranging from sports shoes and toys to mobilephones, textiles and body care products.The bad news is that manyother companies continue to disregard mounting health andenvironmental concerns over the chemicals added to their products.Information on chemicals used in products and on companies’chemicals policies is published on the Greenpeace productsdatabase (available in English athttp://www.greenpeace.org.uk/Products/Toxics/, in F rench at
www.vigitox.org, in Dutch at www.lichaamzondergif.nl, and inSpanish at http://archivo.greenpeace.org/toxicos/html/home.html).
Elected members of the European Parliament and ministers of EU
governments are currently debating legislation that has the
potential to protect EU citizens from exposure to hazardouschemicals. For this legislation, known as REACH (Registration,Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals), to be truly effective,lawmakers must ensure that all companies are required tosubstitute hazardous chemicals by replacing them with saferalternatives wherever available.AN INVESTIGATION OF CHEMICALS IN

CHEMICALS IN PERFUME REPORT |  5ICHEMICALS IN PERFUMES:
A HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN
Two groups of hazardous or potentially hazardous chemicals commonly
used in perfumes and other personal care products are phthalate esters,commonly known as phthalates, and synthetic (artificial or man-made)musks. As a consequence of the extensive and high-volume use of thesechemicals in products, they have become widely distributed throughboth the natural and the urban environment.The ubiquitous presence ofsynthetic musks and phthalates in the environment and in consumerproducts, many of which are very slow to break down, results incontinuous background exposures with unknown long-term
consequences. At the same time, personal care products that we applyto our skin, including perfumes, provide a direct route of repeatedexposure to relatively concentrated doses and may be expected to
contribute substantially to our overall exposure to these chemicals.
Although data remain limited, there is evidence to suggest that the
phthalates and synthetic musks in common use may present uswith diverse health and environmental hazards. New evidence isemerging all the time. Further details of the properties andhazards of these chemicals are provided in the text boxes below.
DIETHYL PHTHALATE (DEP) AND OTHER PHTHALATE ESTERS
Diethyl phthalate (DEP) is one of many phthalate esters in common use. It is used in particular in a wide range of cosmetic and other
personal care products, primarily as a solvent and vehicle for fragrances and other cosmetic ingredients and as an alcohol denat urant
[making the alcohol unfit to drink] (SCCNFP 2003). Although DEP has generally been considered as having a low overall toxicity a nd
does not appear to exhibit the same level of reproductive toxicity displayed by certain other phthalates (notably DEHP), newly e merging
evidence raises significant concerns regarding its safety.
Given their widespread use in consumer goods, exposure to phthalates can occur through a variety of routes (Koo et al. 2002, Fromme
et al. 2004). Since DEP is an ingredient of perfumes and other personal care products, it appears that inhalation may be a significant
route of exposure (Adibi et al. 2003). Absorption through the skin is also likely to be a contributory factor .
Although DEP is rapidly metabolised in the human body to its monoester form (MEP) and does not appear to accumulate in tissues, it is clear
that when applied to the skin DEP rapidly penetrates it and becomes widely distributed around the body following each exposure (WHO 2003).
MEP has been reported at up to 30 times higher concentrations in human urine than metabolites of any other phthalate ester (Dut y et al. 2003).
One study (Silva et al. 2004) has recently shown that, whereas levels of certain other phthalate metabolites excreted in the urine are generally
higher in children than in adults, levels of MEP are commonly twice as high in young adults as they are in children, with the hig hest levels of all in
women, possibly reflecting differences in frequency of use of personal care products, such as hair care products, cosmetics and pe rfumes.
The long-term effects of such repeated direct exposure to DEP are not well understood. However , some recent evidence indicates th at
changes to the DNA of sperm cells are more prevalent in ind ividuals who also show high levels of MEP in their urine (Duty et al.
2003); further studies are necessary to dete rmine if there is a causal relationship. More recently still, research has identified a possible
link between exposure to two phthalate metabolites, namely MEP and MBP (monobutyl phthalate), measured in urine samples, and
restricted lung function in adult men (Hoppin et al. 2004).
A number of other phthalates identified in the perfume samples, albeit at far lower levels than DEP , are also of toxicological co ncern.
Of particular note are dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), both of which are classified in the EU as toxi c to
reproduction (Category 2) (EU 2003).

6|  CHEMICALS IN PERFUME REPORTSYNTHETIC MUSKS
Synthetic musks are man-made aromatic compounds that are used in place of more expensive natural musks.They are added to many
everyday products, including laundry detergents, air fresheners, hand creams, soaps and perfumes (OSPAR 2004).
The term synthetic musks encompasses three broad chemical groups: nitromusks, polycyclic musks and macrocyclic musks. Due to
toxicological concerns, nitromusk production has been in decline in Europe for a number of years. Only two nitromusks are ofimportance today: musk xylene (MX) and musk ketone (MK).These, along with two polycyclic musks, galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide
(AHTN) account for 95% of the European market for synthetic musks (OSPAR 2004).
Synthetic musks are environmentally persistent chemicals and, as a consequence of this and their extensive use in products, have become
widely distributed in the environment, especially in aquatic and marine systems (Eschke 2004, Leonards and de Boer 2004, Bester 
et al.
1998) but also in the atmosphere (Peters 2003) and inside buildings (Kallenborn and Gatermann 2004).
A study commissioned by Greenpeace Netherlands of chemicals in rainwater within the Netherlands found synthetic musk compounds in
virtually all rainwater samples (Peters 2003). While HHCB was found to be distributed fairly evenly, there was a clear peak in le vels of
AHTN in the centre of the country.This peak coincided with the location of a chemical company that produces synthetic musk comp ounds.
Significantly, the nitromusk musk ambrette (MA), which has been banned in the EU since 1995, was found at 34% of the rainwatercollection points, suggesting long-term environmental persistence.
Synthetic musks can concentrate in l iving tissues; indeed, musks used in perfumes have also been found contaminating human blood and
breast milk (Rimkus and Wolf 1996, Peters 2004).There is increasing evidence emerging that some nitromusks and polycyclic musks,including those commonly used in perfumes, may be capable (either as parent compounds or as metabolites) of interfering with hor mone
communication systems in fish (Schreurs 
et al. 2004), amphibians (Dietrich and Hitzfeld 2004) and mammals (Bitsch et al. 2002,
Schreurs et al. 2002), and may exacerbate the effects of exposure to other toxic chemicals (Smital et al. 2004).
Although the oestrogenic activity exhibited by HHCB and AHTN in mammals is relatively weak, anti-oestrogenic effects have been o bserved
for the same compounds at concentrations more than 100 times lower (Schreurs et al. 2002). Statistical associations have been reported
between MX and MK levels in the blood and the occurrence of certain gynaecological conditions in women (Eisenhardt et al. 2001), though
a causal relationship has not been established.perfume
Perfumes may bring us pleasure, but we could enjoy them even more if we knew they were free of substances that could build
up in the environment and in our bodies and even have the potential to affect our health. Consumers wishing to avoid these
substances face a difficult task, since manufacturers rarely label phthalates and synthetic musks on the packaging.

CHEMICALS IN PERFUME REPORT |  7Nitromusks were found in a limited number of perfumes and mainly
at low or non-detectable levels, with the exception of Chanel’s No.5, which contained 4 670.4 mg/kg (0.46%) of musk ketone (MK).Polycyclic musks, especially galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide
(AHTN), were found in almost all perfumes, but again levels variedenormously. Levels of HHCB varied from highs of 77 848 mg/kg(7.8% by weight) in The Body Shop’s White Musk, 44 776 mg/kg(4.5%) in Cartier’s Le Baiser Du Dragon and 37 644 mg/kg(3.8%) in Jean-Paul Gaultier’s Le Mâle to values of less than 1 mg/kg in some other products. 5 of the perfume products wereanalysed for a fewer number of synthetic musks than the otherbrands and could conceivably contain a higher total of syntheticmusks than that reported.
Reasons for the wide disparity in levels of phthalates 
(below detection to 2.2% by weight) and synthetic musks (below detection to 9.4% by weight) are currently unknown.While the absence of these chemicals at detectable limits in some brands suggests that it may be possible to manufacture and successfully market perfumes without their deliberate use,it is not possible from the results of this investigation to determinewhich other chemical ingredients may be used instead. Given the
legitimate concerns surrounding the continued use of phthalatesand synthetic musk compounds, however , further research into this issue is urgently required.
One possible explanation for the apparent absence of nitromusk
and polycyclic musk compounds in some perfumes is theincreasing interest within the fragrance industry in the use of
macrocyclic musks in place of polycyclic musks and nitromusks.Very little information is available on their scale of use or their
potential hazards to human health or the environment.Greenpeace also commissioned TNO to carry out a qualitativeanalysis of macrocyclic musks in 29 of the perfumes tested.21 of these tested positive for macrocyclic musks.The analysesconducted in the TNO study provide an initial indication of theirwidespread use, illustrating the need for further research.IIANALYSIS OF PERFUMES
Between 2003 and 2004 Greenpeace commissioned the quantitative
analysis of a random selection of 36 brands of eau de toilette andeau de parfum for phthalates, polycyclic musks and nitromusks.The independent Netherlands laboratory,TNO Environment and
Geosciences, conducted the analyses (Peters, 2005)(http://www.greenpeace.org/tnoperfumereport). Detailed results ofthe analysis are shown in the annex of this report.
The results show that phthalates and synthetic musks are present
in virtually every perfume brand that was tested.
All but one sample contained measurable levels of phthalates,
with amounts varying enormously between brands. Only one had nodetectable phthalate content. Several others had low levels of total
phthalates, below 10 mg/kg (0.001%). By contrast, the samplewith the highest level of phthalates contained over 22 000 mg/kg(2.2% of total sample by weight).
The most prevalent phthalate was diethyl phthalate (DEP),
found in 34 out of the 36 perfumes tested and with widely varying
levels. Only Gloria Vanderbilt’s Vanderbilt and Bogner’s HighSpeed contained no detectable levels of this phthalate.The highestlevels of DEP were found in Calvin Klein’s Eternity for Women(22 299 mg/kg, or 2.2% by weight), Melvita’s Iris Blue (11 189 mg/kg, or 1.1%) and Jean-Paul Gaultier’s Le Mâle (9 884 mg/kg, or just under 1%).
The perfumes tested also showed wide variations in the quantities of
synthetic musks that they contained.Total levels of nitromusks andpolycyclic musks were lowest in Puma’s Puma Jamaica Man (0.1 mg/kg), Alqvimia’s Aqua Natural (0.5 mg/kg), NaomiCampbell’s Sunset (1.8 mg/kg) and Christian Dior’s Pure Poison (2 mg/kg). Highest total quantities of these synthetic musks werefound in Cartier’s Le Baiser Du Dragon (45 048 mg/kg, or 4.5%
by weight) and Gaultier’s Le Mâle (64 428 mg/kg, or 6.4%), and,with a remarkable 94 069 mg/kg (9.4%),The Body Shop’s White Musk.

8|  CHEMICALS IN PERFUME REPORTIIITHE LIMITS OF EXISTING LEGISLATION 
Existing EU legislation provides us only with partial protection
from the chemicals used in cosmetics, including perfume products.The EU Cosmetics Directive (76/768/EEC) restricts the use in
cosmetic products of chemicals that are classified as carcinogenic,mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR).This restrictionalready prohibits the use of at least one nitromusk, muskambrette. However , the same Directive:
*does not prevent the use of chemicals of equivalent concern,
such as endocrine disruptors;
*fails to address exposure arising from the environmental
distribution of the chemicals used in the manufacture of
cosmetic products, or from the use and disposal of theseproducts;
*lacks any authorisation procedure that would require
manufacturers to adopt a policy of precaution or to seeksystematic solutions to phase out and replace undesirablechemical groups.
Only a strong and overarching precautionary approach to
chemical legislation will address such regulatory failings and leadindustry to promote innovation of safer substitutes and to phase
out chemicals of concern.IVACCEPT THE RISKS OR TAKE PRECAUTIONS?
This study confirms the widespread use of phthalates and
synthetic musk compounds in perfumes and the fact that thesepotentially hazardous ingredients may constitute a significantpercentage of the overall weight of the product.
The definitive health risks of any particular chemical substance are
always difficult, if not impossible, to quantify, and though they maytake many years to complete, assessments are often highly subjectiveor even inconclusive.The assumptions used and judgements made inreaching conclusions regarding risks to the environment or humanhealth are rarely communicated beyond technical papers, despite theimportance of these aspects to the interpretation of conclusions
drawn and the degree of uncertainty that underlies them. Moreover ,risk assessment starts from the position that some level of exposure
to a chemical, even one showing intrinsically hazardous properties, isultimately ‘acceptable’ and can be managed.
Given the added complexities resulting from the fact that we are
exposed not to ind ividual chemicals, but chemical mixtures and
that there are commonly many different sources of each chemicalin our daily lives, it is clear that traditional narrow risk
assessment techniques are unlikely to provide adequate protection.A more precautionary approach to the evaluation and control ofchemicals is urgently required.AN INVESTIGATION OF CHEMICALS IN

CHEMICALS IN PERFUME REPORT |  9Recent opinions adopted by the EU Scientific Committee on
Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products, SCCNFP(reorganised into the Scientific Committee on Consumer Productsin 2004), concerning HHCB and AHTN (SCCNFP 2002 a, b),
illustrate the influence of underlying assumptions when
determining “acceptable risk”.The Committee advises that HHCB
can be used as a fragrance ingredient in cosmetics withoutrestrictions and that AHTN may be similarly used up to amaximum of 12% of the fragrance compound (as opposed to12% of the final product), and base their recommendation onestimated ‘margins of safety’.The calculation of these margins ofsafety depends heavily on the choice of representative values forexposure, skin absorption and toxicity.
In this instance, to dete rmine the margin of safety for HHCB, the
Committee assumed a skin absorption of 0.1% of applied doseand a typical concentration of the chemical in a perfume product(eau de toilette) of 2.4%. A much higher estimate of absorbeddose (5.1%) was rejected on the basis that the study from whichit was d erived did not meet the Committee’s ‘notes of guidance’
and that it applied the dose in pure ethanol, consideredunrepresentative of commercial products. But given that trueperfumes (including eaux de parfum) can contain as high as 75%ethanol by weight (Bearling 1999), this study may have greaterrelevance.The results from the TNO analyses moreover show thateven in comparably weaker eaux de toilette formulations, HHCBlevels can exceed the Committee’s assumption of a 2.4%concentration (in 5 of 36 products analysed by TNO). Applyingthese relatively ‘worst case’ estimates for absorption andconcentration, margins of safety could have been reduced by afactor of at least 100.For AHTN, the Committee similarly assumed a typical product
concentration value of 0.96% and again rejected the considerationof a higher measure of absorbed dose in its calculations todetermine a margin of safety.The results of the TNO analysis show
how these values can be exceeded in 2 of the 36 samples tested.Additionally, the Committee itself cautions that its opinions on thesechemicals do not take account of additional consumer exposurefrom a diversity of other sources (SCCNFP 2002 a, b). Cosmeticsare not the only sources of human exposure to musks; airfresheners, soaps and laundry detergents may all contain musks.
It is unclear from the Committee’s deliberations precisely how 
no-observed-adverse-effect levels of 50 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg forHHCB and AHTN respectively were derived, or whether thesevalues include consideration of potential endocrine-disrupting
properties or synergistic effects with other toxic chemicals.
In any event, it is certain that new evidence of the environmental
and health effects of these chemicals emerging since 2002 couldnot have been considered, though it may well be of relevance forthe margin of safety calculated.

10 | CHEMICALS IN PERFUME REPORTthe way forward
This research confirms the presence of
potentially hazardous chemicals in eau detoilette and eau de parfum products.Thequantities of the chemical substances varywidely between ind ividual products and there
are many gaps in the regulation of their use.
REACH, the proposed EU chemicals
reform, has the potential to set in motionan authorisation process that would requirethe phase out and substitution ofhazardous chemicals, in particular‘substances of high concern’ which displayproperties that may harm our health andenvironment.This includes chemicals thatare persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic(PBT) and those that are very persistentand very bioaccumulative (vPvB),chemicals that have the potential to causecancer , reproductive damage or give rise togenetic mutations (CMR) and chemicalsthat can affect the hormonal system(endocrine disruptors). While it remains tobe seen whether phthalates and syntheticmusks will ultimately be officially identifiedas “chemicals of very high concern” underREACH, the emerging evidence ofhazardous properties outlined above clearlygives grounds for their consideration.annex 1

October 2003, has suffered from intensive lobbying by industry.The proposed regulation contains a loophole that would authorise
the continued use of a ‘substance of very high concern’ even if asafer alternative were available.
Greenpeace believes that for REACH to protect us from exposure
to harmful chemicals, an authorisation for the use of ‘chemicals ofvery high concern’ should be refused unless no safer alternativesare available and the use is essential to society.This is theprinciple of substitution.
Some companies are responding to increasing consumer
awareness of synthetic chemicals in products and are setting inplace policies to phase out and replace certain harmful chemicals.Such companies prove that an innovative approach, leading to anew generation of safer products, can equally lead to commercialsuccess. Perfume companies should follow their lead. However ,voluntary agreements are not enough to drive across the board
innovation and green solutions. REACH needs to provide the
legally binding structures to implement a chemicals policy basedon precaution and dr iving innovation.
The challenge now is for elected representatives and government
ministers to strengthen REACH and thus to protect us from
hazardous chemicals in everyday life.AN INVESTIGATION OF CHEMICALS IN
