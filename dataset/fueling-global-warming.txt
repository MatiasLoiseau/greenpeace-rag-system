FOREWORD BY GREENPEACE
In 1997, the issue of human-induced climate change attracted unprecedented attention.
Not only are physical signs of global warming, such as temperature change and sea level rise,increasingly apparent, but governments have agreed to a legally binding instrument, the KyotoProtocol, to begin to address the problem.  How quickly the industrialized world will cut emissionsof the six major greenhouse gases, how many of the loopholes negotiated in Kyoto will remain,and what role developing countries will play in emissions reductions are all central issues at highlevel climate talks in June and November 1998 under the Framework Convention on ClimateChange.
Governments' actions, policies, and spending are benchmarks for evaluating their
commitment to greenhouse gas reductions and the proliferation of clean energy solutions.Nowhere is this illustrated more clearly than through continued government subsidization of coal,oil, nuclear, and other forms of so-called "dirty" energy.  These subsidies are increasinglycontroversial.  The World Bank, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Economist, and other
influential financial publications have all called for their removal or reduction.
In the late 1980s, federal subsidies to oil were more than four times higher than those to all
renewable energy and energy efficiency sources combined; subsidies to all fossil fuels were tentimes higher.  With the goal of evaluating existing patterns of government support, Greenpeacecommissioned Industrial Economics, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts to assess current federalsubsidies to U.S. oil.
The results of this comprehensive, peer-reviewed analysis demonstrate that the federal
government continues to subsidize the oil industry with billions of dollars of taxpayer funds eachyear, and that the historic bias in government support against renewables and efficiency is likely toremain.  Not only do these subsidies divert needed public support for emerging clean energytechnologies, but they often make it more difficult for cleaner fuels to compete in the marketplace.
Notwithstanding the tremendous historical subsidies to fossil fuels, this current support
directly undermines current and future government policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gasemissions.  The bias in public support also impedes real competition within deregulated or"liberalized" energy markets by distorting relative fuel prices.  The oil industry continues to arguethat the high costs of solar and renewable power mean that clean power solutions are noteconomically viable in the near to mid-term.  The viability of these energy alternatives must beevaluated taking into consideration the $5 to $35 billion in annual subsidies to oil documented inthis study, as well as the billions in additional support flowing to other fossil fuels both in the U.S.and abroad.
Eliminating subsidies and incorporating environmental externalities into energy prices are
achievable, market-based solutions that can play an important near-term role in combating climatechange.  It is our hope that this independent, peer-reviewed study will make an importantcontribution towards this end.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
ES-1EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Despite increasing concerns over climate change and other environmental consequences
of our heavy reliance on oil, the U.S. government continues to subsidize the fuel.  Subsidies tooil are provided to producers, transporters, and consumers in varied and often subtle ways.  Thesesubsidies not only cost taxpayers billions of dollars per year, but they often exacerbateenvironmental damage.  They can also reduce oil prices, suppressing market signals togovernments, oil consumers, and oil producers to begin shifting to alternatives.
This study examines federal subsidies to oil in detail, including policies directly targeted
to the oil sector and a pro-rated share of more generally-targeted provisions.  By highlighting andquantifying this support, we demonstrate that subsidies continue to play a substantial role in theU.S. economy and identify logical areas for reforms that can save taxpayer money, reduceenvironmental damages, and help the country to meet carbon reduction targets.  Our analysisincludes a broad array of subsidy areas, including tax breaks, research and development support,subsidized credit programs, defense of oil supplies, below-market sale of public oil resources,subsidized oil transport, and private sector liabilities that are shifted onto the public.  We havealso analyzed federal levies on oil and deducted these from our subsidy values as appropriate toobtain our net subsidy estimate.  Where available data did not permit specific subsidies to bequantified, we have described them qualitatively.
SUBSIDIES TO OIL ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR
The U.S. government provided net subsidies of between $5.2 and $11.9 billion to the oil
sector during 1995, excluding the cost of defending Persian Gulf oil supplies.  We estimatedefense of oil supplies to be worth an additional $10.5 to $23.3 billion, demonstrating themagnitude of this specific subsidy element.  Thus, our estimate for net federal subsidies to oil,including defense, is $15.7 to $35.2 billion for 1995.  Because of the sensitivity of our totals tothe defense subsidy, we present our results both with and without this item.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
ES-2The large range between our high and low estimates is indicative of the uncertainty
surrounding some of the data inputs needed to estimate specific subsidies.  Factors contributingto this range include differences between the cost of subsidies to taxpayers versus their value tothe oil industry, differences between data sources, and the use of multiple methodologicalapproaches to assess certain subsidies.
LARGEST INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIES TO OIL
Exhibit ES-1 lists the fifteen largest sources of subsidy to the oil fuel cycle at the federal
level.  As shown in the exhibit, the largest non-defense subsidies are worth between $4.5 and $11billion, over 85 percent of our total non-defense estimates.  Including defense, the fifteen largestsubsidies are worth $15 to $34 billion, more than 95 percent of our totals.  The most significantof these subsidies, grouped by topic, are described below.  A complete listing of subsidyelements can be found in Appendix Exhibit A-1.
• Defense of Persian Gulf Oil Supplies.   Defense of Persian Gulf oil
shipments and infrastructure comprises two-thirds of the total highestimate, conferring a subsidy of $10.5 to $23.3 billion per year.  Therange represents the variation in analytical approaches used by defenseanalysts (described in detail in Chapter 4).
 • Provision of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Stockpiling oil to protect
against supply disruptions provided between $1.6 and $5.4 billion insubsidies to oil markets in 1995 (see Chapter 4).  The high estimateincludes the 1995 increment of compounded interest incurred on the manyyears of unrepaid debt.
 • Tax Breaks for Domestic Oil Exploration and Production.   Despite
reforms intended to narrow the applicability of tax breaks for oil and gas,the industry continues to benefit substantially from tax subsidies, asdescribed in Chapter 2.  Three tax breaks benefiting oil exploration andproduction (the expensing of exploration and development costs, excess ofpercentage over cost depletion, and accelerated depreciation of oil-relatedcapital) reduced oil industry tax payments by between $1.1 and $2.3billion during 1995.
 • Support for Oil-related Exports and Foreign Production.   Tax credits
for foreign royalties paid, deferrals of U.S. income taxes due formultinational oil companies, and credit subsidies through the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, providebetween $0.8 and $1.6 billion per year in subsidies for exports and foreignproduction.  These provisions are presented in detail in Chapters 2 and 3.

ES-4• Provision and Maintenance of Coastal and Inland Shipping Routes.
With a large share of the total tonnage shipped through the nation’s
waterways and ports, oil benefits disproportionately from subsidies towater infrastructure (see Chapter 3). Reforms over the past ten years haveincreased the share of infrastructure costs borne by shippers; however,substantial subsidies remain. Tax exemptions for bonds used for harborconstruction and spending by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Army Corps ofEngineers continue to provide subsidies worth $600 to $650 million peryear to oil.
 • Unfunded and Underfunded Liabilities.   Inadequate bonding and user
fees for the current stock of onshore and offshore oil operators shift $170to $550 million in liability insurance premiums from oil companies to thepublic each year.   These subsidies are described in Chapter 5.
 • Royalty Losses.   Due to creative accounting by oil producers and lapses in
auditing practices by some government agencies, the federal governmentloses at least $80 and $200 million per year in royalties (see Chapter 6).Adequate data were not available to quantify the full value of royalty-related subsidies.
FEDERAL TAX DATA SUGGEST EFFECTIVE TAX RATES ON OIL REMAIN LOW
Data on actual tax payments by the largest oil companies indicate that the industry
continues to benefit from substantial federal tax breaks.  As shown in Exhibit ES-2, the averageeffective federal tax rate (i.e., taxes paid as a percentage of taxable income) on integratedoperations fell from 21.5 percent during the 1977 to 1981 period to only 11.9 percent in 1995.Although the statutory tax rate also fell during this period, the major oil companies continued topay taxes at a rate over 20 percentage points below the statutory level.
Tax breaks to industry remain a moving target.  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997
included two new tax subsidies to oil, as well as one tax break that was not targeted at the oilsector, but that benefits oil nonetheless.
AGGREGATE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR OIL, BY ACTIVITY SUPPORTED
Individual subsidies can be classified by the type of activity they encourage, ranging from
support for oil exploration and development to providing regulatory oversight to the oil industry.As shown in Exhibit ES-3, maintaining secure oil supplies is by far the largest activity supportedby the federal government.  Security concerns, which include the two largest individual subsidies(the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and defense of Persian Gulf oil supplies), comprise over 75

     (1)  FRS companies are comprised of major energy producing corporations that report annually to the Energy Information 
            Administration's Financial Reporting System.  Nearly 80 percent of these firms' revenues are derived from petroleum  
            operations.     (2)  Includes income from all activities, not just oil.  The figures are net of accelerated depreciation and expensing.  T hese
            tax provisions are factored into taxable income rather than being reported as deductions from that income.   Theref ore,

ES-7percent of our estimates if defense of Persian Gulf oil is included, and at least 30 percent of all
non-defense subsidies.  Incentives for oil exploration and production, at over 35 percent of thetotal, are the largest category of support for non-defense subsidies in our low estimate, andsecond largest in our high.
The third largest subsidy activity is support for oil-related transportation, a category often
overlooked.  This support primarily involves maintenance of oil shipping routes andinfrastructure, and is worth over $700 million per year.  It is important to remember that thiscategory includes only the transport of oil; subsidies to transportation systems that rely on oil(and which therefore increase the demand for oil) are not included in our analysis.
The remaining subsidy categories each comprise between one and six percent of our total
estimates.  Though small on a percentage basis, the dollar value of these categories is stillsubstantial.  For example, transfers to the public sector of liability for properly closing oil drillingoperations were worth as much as $500 million in 1995.
SUBSIDIES IN CONTEXT
Aggregate subsidy values provide one perspective on the size of oil subsidies.  It is
equally important to evaluate their magnitude in the context of oil prices. While not all subsidiesaffect prices, these comparisons offer a better idea of the impact subsidies have on consumptionbehavior than the aggregate subsidy values alone.  We have also found it useful to examinesubsidy values in the context of two major policy initiatives within the past decade to modify oildemand patterns:  the carbon tax and the Btu-tax.  These metrics are shown in Exhibit ES-4.
The subsidy metrics are evaluated using three scenarios, reflecting the complexity
associated with U.S. government subsidies that partly benefit foreign rather than domesticpetroleum:
*
• Scenario 1 evaluates domestic subsidies only, excluding credit subsidies
to international banks, defense of Persian Gulf oil supplies, and tax breaksfor foreign operations.
• Scenario 2  allocates a portion of the foreign subsidies to the domestic
market, reflecting the fact that some of the foreign oil supported by theseprograms is imported into the United States.
                                                          
* Both the subsidies (the metric numerator) and the petroleum consumption figures (the metric
denominators) have been adjusted to best reflect the specific scenario.  The consumption figures used for Scenario 1are for domestic petroleum only, and consumer expenditures exclude the value of imported oil prior to domesticrefining.  Scenarios 2 and 3 include total U.S. consumption and expenditure data.

      impacted by domestic subsidies.   2)  Subsidy value includes the pro-rated share of foreign subsidies that benefit net imports.  Foreign tax breaks and lending     subsidies are pro-rated by U.S. net imports' share of total foreign petroleum products supplied.  Persian Gulf defense     spending is pro-rated by the percentage of total Persian Gulf production imported by the U.S. 
     Total U.S. consumption and expenditure figures are used.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
ES-9• Scenario 3  sets an upper bound by assuming all subsidies benefit domestic
markets.  Although in reality not all the oil supported by internationallyoriented programs reaches U.S. markets, foreign tax breaks and lendingprograms primarily benefit U.S. corporations, and supply shocks in thePersian Gulf affect the price of all U.S. oil, regardless of its origin.
Subsidies as a Percent of Oil Prices
Subsidies to domestic oil are worth between $1.20 and $2.80 per barrel of domestic crude
consumed.  This range is equivalent to roughly 3 to 6.5 percent of consumer expenditures onpetroleum products in 1995.
†  The range is slightly lower in our second scenario, although the
uncertainty associated with the values suggests that the differences would probably not bestatistically significant.
In our third scenario, total federal subsidies for oil are equivalent to as much as 17 percent
of U.S. consumer expenditures on petroleum.  In addition, the subsidy intensity of imported oil ismuch higher than domestic production.  These results indicate two important points.  First, if asignificant portion of the benefits of subsidies to foreign production flows back to the U.S. oilsector, subsidy reform would have a noticeable impact on consumption decisions.  Second,domestic oil would become more competitive with imports, resulting in some marginal oil wellsbecoming economic again.
Subsidy Intensity in the Context of Proposed Oil Taxes
Tremendous attention has focused on efficient mechanisms to reduce the impact of
climate change.  Taxes on carbon are an oft-suggested tool to “get the prices right” (i.e., tointernalize environmental externalities) in energy markets.  A number of economists haveestimated economically efficient carbon tax levels that would begin the transition to lower-carbon fuels.  Their results suggest median values of between $9 and $14 per ton.
‡
                                                          
† Because our subsidy estimates are net of user fees, we have adjusted expenditure data to eliminate the
portion of prices attributable to the various fees on oil.
‡ Values are estimates for the 1990-2000 period; studies generally show the efficient tax rate rising over
time.  The calculated tax values are set at a rate such that the marginal cost of carbon-emitting activities reflects theestimated damage these activities cause the environment.  We use a median carbon tax estimate rather than anaverage because the source of our data contained an outlier, $142.50 per metric ton of carbon (1995 dollars), thatexceeded all of the other estimates by more than a factor of six.  Carbon tax rate data are from five studies(Nordhaus, Cline, Peck and Tiesberg, Fankauser, and Maddison) summarized in the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change, Climate Change 1995: Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change , Contribution of
Working Group III to the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC, Cambridge University Press, 1996, Table 6.1, p.215.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
ES-10Our three subsidy scenarios suggest that federal oil subsidies are worth $7.50 to nearly
$60 per ton of carbon emitted from U.S. petroleum consumption.  While subsidy removal shouldnot be substituted for a carbon tax, since the latter is aimed specifically at mitigating externalitiesassociated with fossil fuels, the comparison is instructive.  The relative size of the valuessuggests that even without the political will to implement a carbon tax, phasing out oil subsidiescould help to improve the price signals that now exist within oil markets.  In addition, the factthat the subsidy intensity actually exceeds these carbon tax values underscores the marketdistortions that would remain if carbon taxes were implemented without concurrent subsidyreform.
A comparison to proposed taxes on Btus (British thermal units) illustrates a similar point.
Btus measure the heat content of a fuel.  During 1992 and 1993, the U.S. Congress proposed aBtu-based tax on energy.  In addition to raising revenues, proponents argued that the tax wouldensure that energy prices reflected the environmental impacts associated with the production andconsumption of particular fuels.  The proposed tax rate set for oil was $0.31 per million Btu(scaled to 1995 dollars).  In comparison, oil subsidies for 1995 ranged from 50 to 325 percent ofthe proposed tax value, depending on the scenario.  Had the tax been implemented, much of thehoped for benefit in terms of price signals would merely have offset distortions already in placefrom federal subsidies to oil.  Environmental externalities still would not have been reflected inoil prices.
Summary
The evaluation of subsidies in the context of the oil market demonstrates that subsidies to
oil are important and probably impact oil consumption decisions. Eliminating subsidiesthroughout the fuel cycle will help clarify price signals at every stage of the production chain,improving economic efficiency.  In conjunction with externality-based taxes, the price of oilwould begin to provide suppliers, consumers, and governments much more accurate informationwith which to adjust their economic decision making.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The impacts of oil subsidies merit greater attention as the world tries to shape a global
climate change strategy and address the many competing needs for scarce government funds.While it has long ago been recognized that oil prices do not reflect the environmental costs ofpetroleum consumption, our analysis shows that prices do not even reflect the direct costs ofpetroleum production.  At a time of tight fiscal constraints and cuts to social programs, thegovernment should not spend billions of dollars every year to subsidize oil and the environmentalproblems that result from its consumption.
The costs of supplying oil should fall on the user, not on the general taxpayer.  Continued
subsidization of oil makes little sense.  Subsidies to the oil fuel cycle distort oil exploration,production and consumption decisions; reduce the incentive to develop substitutes; intensifyenvironmental degradation; and cost taxpayers billions of dollars per year.  Our analysis suggests

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
ES-11that subsidy reform can be a positive force in achieving environmental improvements and
substantial fiscal savings, while also eliminating the price distortions that hinder economicefficiency.  Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the magnitude of subsidies is large enoughthat they can impede the efficacy of other policy reform efforts (such as carbon taxes) if ignored.
The historically low oil prices now in effect provide a tremendous opportunity for
governments to phase out their oil subsidies with minimal inflationary risks.  To help thisprocess, efforts to characterize, report, and remove oil subsidies need to be intensified.  Based onour analysis, we make the following recommendations for structural change.  To reduceeconomic dislocations, many of these reforms should be phased in over time.
1) Decouple oil subsidies from rural economic development.   Many subsidies to oil
exploration and production are justified on the grounds that they provide jobs and livelihoodsfor isolated rural populations.  Data suggest that development policies focused on naturalresource extraction have rarely been successful.  In addition, rapid advances intelecommunications and computer technology provide an increasing range of developmentoptions for geographically isolated communities.  By decoupling oil development and jobs,governments can stop subsidizing environmental degradation and work to create cleaner,higher value job opportunities for rural populations.
2) Internalize oil-related defense costs into market prices.   Where governments choose to
intervene in oil markets to ensure the security of supplies, the costs of this interventionshould be recovered through a user fee on oil consumers. Given the magnitude of these costs,excluding them from the price of oil creates significant and undesirable distortions inconsumption behavior.
3) Treat the Strategic Petroleum Reserve like a formal government enterprise.   SPR costs
taxpayers billions of dollars per year in direct costs and foregone interest.  The Reserveshould be treated as a government enterprise, financed through taxes on oil consumption andformally held responsible for repayment of invested capital plus interest.
4) Include subsidy reform as an integral element in strategies to mitigate the impacts of
climate change.   Taxing emissions makes little sense if governments simultaneously
continue to subsidize fossil fuels.  Subsidy identification, reporting, and removal should be anintegral part of climate change mitigation programs.
5) Improve the transparency of oil leases on public lands so terms can be easily compared.
Subsidized lease terms can provide large benefits to oil producers at the taxpayers' expense,
and the resulting acceleration in oil development creates or aggravates environmentalproblems.  Leasing of public oil reserves should be done in a transparent manner at both thefederal and state levels.  Environmental groups should work with the relevant governmentagencies to develop a standard disclosure form to be completed for each sale.  Modificationof lease terms should also be reported in a standardized, publicly available format.  Thisdisclosure form will ensure that lease-related subsidies are visible and that lease terms arecomparable across sales.  Given the international nature of oil markets, the goal of thisdisclosure system should be to allow international comparisons of lease terms.

1-1INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1
 
Despite increasing concerns over the environmental consequences of our heavy reliance
on oil, the U.S. government continues to subsidize the fuel.  Subsidies to oil are provided toproducers, transporters, and consumers in varied and often subtle ways.  These subsidies not onlycost taxpayers billions of dollars per year, but they often exacerbate environmental damage.They can also reduce oil prices, suppressing market signals to oil consumers to decreaseconsumption and begin shifting to alternatives.
This study examines federal subsidies to oil in detail.  By highlighting and quantifying
this support, we demonstrate that subsidies continue to play a substantial role in the U.S.economy and highlight logical areas for reforms that save taxpayer money, reduce environmentaldamages, and potentially help the country to meet carbon reduction targets.
1.1 SUBSIDY BASICS
Subsidies represent government policies that benefit particular sectors of the economy.
Government subsidies are common in most countries and benefit many industries.  When thesesubsidies reduce the prices of natural resources or natural resource intensive products, theyencourage additional pollution and habitat destruction.  An overview of subsidy basics will makethe rest of this report easier to understand.
• Subsidies are not just cash.   A great deal of market activity involves
controlling and sharing the risks and rewards of economic activities.Subsidies are government-provided goods or services, including risk-bearing, that would otherwise have to be purchased in the market.Subsidies can also be in the form of special exemptions from standardrequired payments (e.g., tax breaks).
• Defining the baseline.   Subsidies must often be measured against some
baseline.  What would taxes owed have been in the absence of this specialtax break?  How much would industry have had to pay in interest to build

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
1-2that new facility if the government had not guaranteed the loan?  Our
baseline assumes standard corporate tax rates and no special agencyprograms to finance or absorb market risks for oil-related endeavors.
• Subsidy targeting.   One issue related to defining a baseline is that of
narrowly targeted subsidies versus more broadly targeted programs thatbenefit oil as well as some other industries.  Industry representativesinevitably conclude that only subsidies directly targeted at the oil industryshould count as benefits to oil producers or consumers.  In fact, manyother subsidies tilt the energy playing field towards oil even if otherindustries also benefit.  It is useful to consider a handful of commonsubsidy targeting approaches.
• Single sector.   The clearest and easiest subsidies to identify and
allocate are those directly targeted to the oil industry, such asgovernment financing of oil-related research and developmentprograms through the Department of Energy.
• Multiple sectors.   Other subsidies are beneficial to a number of
economic sectors, including oil.  For example, the oil, gas, andhard rock minerals industries are all eligible for the percentagedepletion allowance (discussed in Chapter 2).  Since many otherenergy sources do not benefit from this provision (and the ratesvary even for those that do benefit), the policy contributes to inter-fuel market distortions.
• Geographic region.   Most state and local subsidies are targeted to
particular geographic regions (i.e., the state or locality).  To theextent that natural resource intensive industries are located in theregion receiving the subsidy (for example, corporate tax ratereductions in a large, oil producing region), policies can encourageincremental pollution and the development of “subsidy clusters”that rely on continued subsidization to survive.
• Factor of production.   Some subsidies are targeted at a particular
factor of production (e.g., labor, capital) instead of specificindustries.  Although broadly available to all industrial sectors,subsidies affecting factors of production can cause marketdistortions nonetheless.  Accelerated depreciation provisions, forexample, allow any industry using capital equipment to deduct thecapital from taxes more quickly than the anticipated service life ofthe capital asset.  These provisions give capital intensive energytypes a competitive advantage over types that require less capitalinvestment, such as some demand-side management options.  In

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
1-3addition, sector-specific depreciation rules in the tax code can
create additional distortions between different capital-intensiveenergy sectors.
• Externalities are extra.   While environmental externalities such as
pollution certainly constitute subsidies to industry, many subsidy studies(including this one) do not analyze them.  The uncertainty regarding theirvalue is larger, and authors often wish to focus on the many ways thatgovernment subsidies directly help polluting industries.  Properlyfunctioning markets would both eliminate internal subsidies to oil andinclude a tax equal to the remaining externalities.
• Treating offsets.   In addition to providing subsidies, the government also
levies fees on oil.  While subsidies act to distort energy markets in favor ofoil, certain fees may have the opposite effect, and are properly treated asoffsets to subsidies.  Our basic approach for calculating net subsidies isshown in Exhibit 1-1.  Where fees represent standard treatment of allindustries, they are not considered subsidy offsets.  Where a fee is leviedonly on oil (or on oil plus a few other sectors), it must be evaluatedfurther.  Many of these fees are earmarked to pay for government activitiessuch as oil spill cleanup or the remediation of contamination fromunderground gasoline storage tanks.  If the levies pay for oil-relatedgovernment activities, then they are treated as user fees rather than subsidy
offsets and they are credited against the oil-related government programspending that they support.  To the extent that a particular fee is leviedonly on a few industries (including oil) and receipts do not support an oil-related purpose, it is referred to as a special tax .  Special taxes are extra
charges on oil that do not pay for activities related to the industry.  Thus,they offset subsidies by decreasing oil’s competitive advantage.  Wesubtract special taxes from our gross subsidy numbers.  Exhibit 2-1provides a flow chart illustrating how to differentiate these various typesof fees.
• Linkage between subsidy levels and oil prices.   In the aggregate,
subsidies throughout the world to the oil fuel cycle depress oil prices,encouraging overconsumption.  However, not every individual subsidy hasan impact on oil prices.  Many subsidies to domestic oil producers, forexample, simply keep these producers competitive with less expensiveimports (which are themselves subsidized through a variety ofmechanisms).  Subsidies that have little or no effect on commodity priceswill not likely change consumption  patterns for oil.  However, removing
even these subsidies will affect the market behavior of oil producers .
Their removal will also save taxpayers money.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
1-4• Cost to taxpayers versus value to recipients.  The cost of a subsidy to
taxpayers does not necessarily equal the value of the subsidy to recipients.Many government loan programs, for example, allow corporations toborrow funds at the lower interest rates obtained by the U.S. Treasury.Such loans do not directly cost the taxpayer but they have an incrementalbenefit to the industry that we try to measure here.  In contrast,government programs may be inefficient and unproductive.  Thus, whilethe programs cost the taxpayer a great deal of money, industry may valuethem at much less than their direct cost.  We were unable to incorporatethis latter category in our analysis.
Exhibit 1-1
CALCULATING NET SUBSIDIES TO OIL
Calculating the net subsidies to oil involves three main steps, shown below.  Instead of
deducting aggregate user fees, as shown in Step 2, we have deducted each user fee from the
specific federal program it supports.  This approach does not affect the resulting aggregate
figures, but provides more detail on individual program subsidies.
1)  Measure total federal subsidies to the oil fuel cycle:
+ Subsidies directly targeted to oil
+ Pro-rated portion of more broadly targeted programs to reflect oil's share
= Gross subsidies to oil
2)  Deduct fees collected from the oil industry and oil consumers:
- User fees collected from the oil sector to pay for oil-related government activities
- Fees levied only on the oil industry, but that support non-oil activities ("special taxes")
= Gross offsets
3)  Calculate net subsidies to oil
+ Gross subsidies to oil
+ Gross offsets
= Net subsidies to oil

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
1-51.2 SCOPE, METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS
This report focuses on subsidies to oil throughout its entire fuel cycle, including oil
exploration, development, transport, refining, and consumption.  The report also includesresearch and development, decommissioning, and remediation related to these stages of the fuelcycle wherever possible.  Subsidies evaluated include federal agency activities, tax breaks,resource sales, liability shifting, and below-market insurance programs.  Programs benefitingmore than the oil sector, as outlined in the “Subsidy Basics” section above, have been included in
our estimates, and in every case have been pro-rated to reflect only the portion accruing to
oil.  We have also included incremental reductions in state taxes attributable to the federal tax
breaks, and post-closure liabilities associated with oil well abandonment that are regulated at thestate level, but not sufficiently funded by state-level user fees at this time.
We have chosen fiscal year 1995 as the base for our estimate, partly to allow for lags in
data availability and partly so that our figures will be comparable to Greenpeace’s estimates ofEuropean energy subsidies.

To address the complexity of government programs that support oil, we have adopted the
following conventions in how we classify and report our data:
• Gross and Net Subsidy Numbers.   Many government programs of
benefit to oil are at least partially funded through user fees on industry.This fact represents significant progress over the past 20 years in chargingindustries a higher percentage of the cost of government-provided goodsand services that are required by activities of those industries. Whilefiscally prudent, the user fee approach can sometimes create a system inwhich specific government offices rely on industry user fees for theircontinued existence, increasing the risk of cooption.  For this reason, wetrack gross subsidy values for each program evaluated, and identifyprograms with high user fee collections and potentially higher cooptionrisks.
2 However, gross numbers alone overstate the effective transfer of
wealth from government to the oil industry.  Thus, our primary focus is onnet subsidy numbers, deducting special taxes and user fees from grosssubsidy values when it is appropriate to do so.

International, May 1997.
2 A reliance on user fees does not mean cooption occurs per se.  In addition to the magnitude of fees
collected as a percentage of the program budget, the risk of cooption rises where funds collected are fed directlyback into local operations rather than to the U.S. Treasury.
3 While special taxes on oil may offset the aggregate  subsidies to the industry, they may affect different
activities than subsidies.  Therefore, subsidies and special taxes may not counteract each other.  For example,subsidies may encourage increased oil exploration and development even though special taxes further down thesupply chain affect oil transport or refining.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
1-6• Range Estimates to Bound Uncertainty.   We have used high and low
estimates for many of the programs included in the analysis.  Thisvariation reflects differences in analytic approaches or data sources.  Theorigin of very large variances between the high and low values on specificitems is explained in more detail in the report.
• Separation of Domestic Subsidies to Foreign Oil from Subsidies to
Domestic Oil in our Discussion of Results.    While both foreign and
domestic subsidies cost the taxpayer money, their impact on the marketdiffers.  We present domestic subsidies to foreign oil separately fromsupport for domestic oil to make our results more useful to readers.
• Separate Reporting of the Cost of Defending Oil Shipments.   Our
aggregate subsidy values are quite sensitive to the estimated cost ofdefending Persian Gulf oil shipments, as these costs are as large as allother programs combined.  As a result, we provide aggregate data bothwith and without these defense costs so that policy analysts can moreclearly see the impact of non-defense subsidies.
Our analysis is subject to a number of caveats.  First, by focusing only on oil we are
unable to present a holistic picture of the distortions that energy subsidies have caused in themarketplace.  Second, we do not attempt to quantify the impact of subsidies on prices and theeffect subsidy removal might have on long-term energy production or consumption patterns.Third, we were unable to analyze every federal agency involved with oil due to the limitations ofthe available budget information.  Exhibit 1-2 lists the programs that were not analyzed.  Fourth,we did not evaluate oil-related environmental externalities or exemptions from environmentallaws.  Fifth, while we analyze subsidies to fuel transport, we do not analyze subsidies totransportation systems overall, even though these likely increase the demand for oil.  Had wedone so, our subsidy estimates would be higher.  Finally, any change in economic structure willcause short-term economic dislocations, including job losses in some parts of the economy andjob gains in others.  Evaluating the magnitude and distribution of these dislocations was alsobeyond the scope of our analysis.

1-81.3 REPORT STRUCTURE
The remainder of this report is organized topically to enable sometimes complex subsidy
mechanisms to be explained in greater detail.  Chapter 2 provides an overview of federal taxsubsidies to, and special taxes on, the oil fuel cycle.  Chapter 3 examines government programsdirectly supporting oil or required to oversee the oil industry.  These include research anddevelopment, construction and maintenance of transportation infrastructure, oversight of theindustry, and credit subsidies for oil-related exports and foreign investment.
Chapter 4 examines government spending to defend oil supplies, including defense of oil
shipping and the cost of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil stockpile.  Chapter 5 evaluatesunfunded liabilities associated with oil spills and the proper closure of oil-related infrastructure.Chapter 6 examines the issue of oil leases in detail, and explains how governments providesubsidies to producers through lease sale practices and lease terms.  This chapter also examinesthe various government programs in place to manage oil production on federal lands.  Chapter 7presents our summary findings and our recommendations for policy changes.  Detailed tablesused to derive our estimates are contained in the Appendix.

2-1FEDERAL TAX SUBSIDIES AND SPECIAL TAXES ON OIL CHAPTER 2
 
Tax subsidies result from selective tax legislation that benefits particular groups of people
or industries in the economy.  In effect, they share the costs of certain actions between the privatesector and the government, impacting investment decisions by increasing the expected returnsassociated with a particular pattern of economic activity.  Tax subsidies take a variety of forms.Credits allow certain expenditures to be deducted from taxes owed.  Reductions in the tax ratelower the percentage tax levels on particular activities relative to standard levels.  Reductions inthe taxable basis maintain the standard percentage tax rate, but allow higher than normal
deductions from taxable income.  Finally, alterations in the taxable entity may allow shifting ofincome and expenses in ways not normally allowed to reduce the tax burden.

Tax subsidies directly targeted at oil production are the easiest provisions to identify.
However, many provisions available to a broader range of economic activity also benefit the oilsector.  This latter class of provisions are still properly included in our analysis of oil becauseother types of economic activity that could substitute for oil are placed at a relative economicdisadvantage. Whenever we have included more broadly targeted tax breaks in our assessment,we have pro-rated the subsidy so that numbers included in the report reflect only oil’s share. Thedegree of distortion in economic activity from tax subsidies varies from provision to provision.In general, greater distortions in economic decision making are likely to result from provisionsthat narrowly target beneficiaries and create large divergences from the standard tax rates paid byother entities in the economy.
Politicians often argue that tax breaks are costless.  They are not.  Although tax breaks do
not require outlays from the U.S. Treasury, they reduce baseline tax revenues, funds that must beraised in other ways, often from other economic sectors.  In addition, tax breaks can createeconomic distortions that encourage inefficient or unwarranted investment.  For example, in theearly 1980s, provisions allowing for highly accelerated depreciation of nuclear plants permittedmuch of the 40-year investment to be written off in a period of less than ten years.

2-2the amount that actual service life exceeds the tax depreciation period, the greater the portion of
the capital risk associated with these investments borne by the federal government.  As occurredwith nuclear power plants, this reduces the normal market signals that encourage investors toseek alternatives with shorter, less risky paybacks.  Although tax subsidies to oil are not as severeas this example, their impact on market signals is the same.
Evaluating net subsidies to oil requires examining both tax breaks and special taxes on
oil.  Our approach to categorizing the various federal levies on the oil industry is summarized inExhibit 2-1.  Where taxes that are specific to the oil industry are used for general revenuepurposes, they are treated as a special tax and netted from total subsidy values.  However, notevery levy on oil is a “special tax.”  Many levies are earmarked for a specific purpose thatbenefits the production or sale of oil, or ameliorates a problem related to the oil fuel cycle.  Inessence, they reimburse the government for services to the industry.  Examples include fees forleaking underground storage tanks, oil spills, and road building.
6 So long as these funds are used
for their stipulated purpose and pay interest on any unused balances, they are not counted asspecial taxes, but are rather viewed as user fees.  User fees are treated as offsets to the costs ofprograms they support.  Other oil-related payments, such as royalties (discussed in detail inChapter 6), are also not considered special taxes because they reflect a return to the resource-owner for selling the oil in question.
The remainder of this chapter examines federal tax breaks and special taxes for oil in
more detail.
2.1 FEDERAL TAX BREAKS TO OIL
We present tax breaks to oil in two ways.
7 The first section examines specific provisions
that benefit oil, using data from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the U.S. Treasury toestimate the value of the subsidies they provide.  The second section provides a rough measure ofthe aggregate value of all tax breaks using data on the overall taxes paid by the major oilcompanies.  These sections represent alternative approaches  to estimate the value of subsidies to
the industry; they are not additive.
                                                          
6 Oil is generally viewed as a primary beneficiary of new road construction.  This reflects the fact that oil is
virtually the only fuel used in road transport and because use of oil for this purpose is by far the fuel’s major market,nearly three times the next largest market, that of home heating oil.
7 Tax breaks are also called tax expenditures to reflect their cost to the government.

2-42.1.1    Major Tax Provisions Benefiting Oil
Tax expenditure estimates are made on an annual basis by both JCT and the Treasury.
The two organizations prepare their estimates independently and often do not agree on estimatedtax losses.  Both sources develop estimates using a revenue loss approach, which estimates howmuch additional revenue the Treasury would collect in the absence of particular tax provisions,and best reflects the cost to taxpayers for these provisions.
8  The Treasury also develops a second
set of estimates using an outlay equivalent approach.  Outlay equivalents reflect the fact that taxbreaks convey tax-free benefits.  The approach measures the amount that would have to be paidto the taxpayer to derive the same after-tax income as obtained under the revenue loss approach.
For this reason, the outlay equivalent approach best reflects the value of the breaks to industry.
We have pro-rated the tax expenditure estimates to reflect their value to the oil industry.
The exhibits that follow include both a high and a low estimate for many of the provisions, andthis range can be fairly large.  Differences between our high and low estimates sometimes reflectvariance in our calculation methods or allocation assumptions.  More often, however, the rangereflects differences between the revenue loss and outlay equivalent approaches, as well asdifferences in the assumptions made by JCT and the Treasury.  Since neither of these groupspublish detailed derivations of their estimates, we were unable to evaluate particular assumptionsin order to narrow the estimate range.
Exhibit 2-2 provides an overview of federal tax breaks benefiting oil and Appendix
Exhibit A-2 provides more detailed information on each estimate.
9  The following are the largest
sources of subsidy:
• Accelerated depreciation.   Accelerated depreciation provisions enable
capital investments to be written off more quickly than their actual servicelives.  While this provision applies to all capital investments (includingrenewable energy), the largest beneficiaries are established, capital-intensive industrial sectors, of which oil is one.  We have pro-rated theseprovisions based on the portion of total capital expenditures that is relatedto oil.  Although the tax losses from accelerated depreciation have beenreduced substantially since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, theCongressional Research Service notes that the economic decline rate forboth equipment and buildings is still “much slower than that reflected in
                                                          
8 This calculation is made for each tax break individually.  In reality, companies often find alternative
mechanisms to shelter income when a particular tax break is removed.  Thus, the values from both sources should beviewed as rough estimates.
9 All estimates are net of the alternative minimum tax (AMT).  The AMT was instituted to counteract the
large deductions that profitable corporations used in the 1980s to eliminate their tax liability completely.  In theory,the AMT ensured that such firms, regardless of eligibility for particular tax breaks, paid some taxes to the Treasury.In practice, it has had very little impact on the actual taxes paid by the oil industry.

2-6 tax depreciation methods.”10  We estimate that accelerated depreciation
provisions conferred tax benefits worth $954 million to $1.33 billion in1995.
• Percentage depletion.   Normally, capital assets are deducted from taxable
income over a period of years, until the entire investment is written off.Percentage depletion allowances for oil allow the industry to write off apercentage of the gross income from oil production each year, as opposed
to a percentage of the gross investment .  As a result, deductions can
actually exceed the original investment.  Beginning in 1975, the provisionwas successively narrowed so that it primarily benefited smaller,independent oil companies.  However, this trend has been reversedsomewhat since 1990, because percentage depletion has been allowed ontransferred properties (even if the new owner would not otherwise beeligible for percentage depletion benefits) and exempted from theAlternative Minimum Tax.
11  In 1995, the value of this provision was
approximately $335 million to $746 million.
• Expensing of Oil Exploration and Development Costs.   This provision
allows oil companies to immediately deduct many types of expenses fromtheir taxable income that other industries must deduct over multipleyears.
12  The ability to expense these costs encourages increased
exploration and extraction of domestic oil.  According to theCongressional Research Service, this provision is mostly claimed byintegrated oil producers.
13  We estimate the value of this provision to be as
much as $243 million in 1995.
• Foreign Tax Credits (FTCs).   Foreign tax credit provisions allow firms
that operate in both the U.S. and abroad to avoid double taxation.  Inreality, oil companies are often able to receive credit for payments toforeign governments that are actually royalties rather than taxes paid.
14
This is especially apparent when oil companies report paying taxes incountries that have no corporate income taxes.  In other cases, tax rates are

2-7higher for oil companies than for other sectors, suggesting similar
shifting.15  By disguising royalties as taxes, oil companies can claim
credits against U.S. taxes owed rather than deductions , as royalties are
normally treated.
 Using an approach developed by Wahl, our low estimate assumes that all
foreign taxes paid in nations that have no standard corporate income taxesare actually royalties.
16  We then calculate the additional taxes that would
be paid if they were treated as royalties instead of taxes (i.e., deductedinstead of credited).  Our high estimate assumes that 50 percent of allforeign tax credits claimed by oil companies are really disguised royalties,including a portion of the tax paid in foreign nations that do have some
corporate income taxes.
17  These approaches yield estimates of $486
million and $1.06 billion for this subsidy in 1995.
• Deferral of Foreign Income.   When a U.S. firm earns income through a
foreign subsidiary, that income is taxed only when it is repatriated asdividends or other income (at which point taxes paid on the income in theforeign country are also credited against U.S. taxes owed).  Because theparent firms are able to time when this happens, they can defer their U.S.tax liabilities for many years.  As international oil companies are bothlarge and operate in many other countries, it is clear that they benefit fromthis tax deferral.  We estimate that this provision confers between $62 and$303 million in reduced taxes per year.
18
                                                          
15 Proposals to reform FTCs claimed by oil companies have been introduced for about the past six years,
but have been unsuccessful.  Although quantitative analyses of the benefits to oil companies prepared by JCT are notpublicly available, JCT did confirm that oil companies continue to pay differential rates in many large oil producingnations.  Pat Dreissen, Joint Committee on Taxation, personal communication, February 24, 1998.
16 See Jenny Wahl, Oil Slickers: How Petroleum Benefits at the Taxpayer’s Expense , Washington, DC:
Institute for Local Self Reliance, August 1996, p. 7.
17 Wahl’s high estimate assumed that all foreign taxes paid were disguised royalties, an assumption that we
did not feel was realistic (Wahl, p.7).  Corporate income taxes do exist in other countries.  Furthermore, Braathenhas argued that, in addition to taxes paid on profits, some governments require de facto taxes in the form of required
exploration and development spending (Nils Axel Braathen, OECD, personal communication, December 11, 1997).Nonetheless, we agree that the practice of disguising royalties as taxes is likely to occur in countries that have somecorporate income tax, and not just those that have none.  In such cases, taxes paid would include both the corporateincome tax and royalties. Such an arrangement would benefit both foreign governments and the oil companies.
18 Our low estimate follows Wahl’s methodology, allocating the total value of the tax expenditure by the 10
to 15.9 percent of the 7,500 largest controlled foreign corporations that were associated with oil and gas interests in1996 (Wahl, p. 6).  We then allocate a portion of this to oil based on oil’s share of total foreign pre-tax incomeearned by the largest U.S. energy companies.  Our high estimate pro-rates the deferred foreign income of major oilproducers (based on EIA data) by oil’s share of total foreign pre-tax income.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
2-8• State and Federal Interactions.   Most state tax systems use the adjusted
gross income value from federal returns as a starting point for calculatingstate taxes.  Thus, tax breaks that reduce the federal taxable income alsoreduce the taxes paid at the state level, magnifying the distortionary effectof the federal breaks.  Our estimate assumes an average state corporate taxrate of 5 percent, yielding a 3 percent increase in tax benefits ($56 to $119million) once interactions between state and federal taxes are taken intoaccount.
19
2.1.2    Effective Tax Rates on the Oil Sector
Another way to estimate the value of tax breaks is to examine data provided by the
Energy Information Administration (EIA) on actual taxes paid by the industry.  The statutory,  or
marginal,  tax rate is the percentage of taxable income that would be paid as taxes in the absence
of special provisions.  The average effective tax rate measures what the industry actually paid.
The difference between the two values is a proxy for the aggregate value of all tax breaks to aparticular industry.
20
As with tax expenditures, the effective tax rate data provided by EIA are subject to a
number of caveats.  First, they are based on survey data of only the largest oil producers.  Thus,they do not reflect tax breaks (such as percentage depletion) that are primarily used by smallerfirms.
21  Second, they are calculated after standard business deductions, such as depreciation, and
therefore do not reflect the benefits enjoyed by the industry from accelerated depreciationprovisions or the expensing of exploration and development costs.
According to the EIA’s data, the average effective tax rate on integrated operations fell
from 21.5 percent during the 1977-1981 period to only 8.7 percent for 1992 to 1995.  During thatsame period, the corporate statutory rate has also fallen by about 12 percentage points, from 47 to
                                                          
19 Average percentage rates are from Wahl, p. 8.
20 Corporations pay a graduated income tax, rising from a low of 15 percent on the first $50,000 in taxable
income in 1995 to 35 percent for all taxable income over $18.3 million.  Given the large multinational oil companiesin our data set, as well as IRS recapture provisions which charge higher marginal rates of 38 and 39 percent fortaxable income between $100,000 and $335,000 and between $15 and $18.3 million, it is reasonable to assume anoverall statutory rate of approximately 35 percent for oil.
21 George Miller, Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, states
that the effective tax rate on independent oil and gas producers is estimated to be zero.  (George Miller, “UnjustifiedGiveaway to the Oil Industry,” Albion Monitor , September 2, 1995, obtained from http:// www.monitor.net/monitor,
September 1997.)  In contrast, the Independent Petroleum Association of America, representing the independent oiland gas producers, claims that a 1995 survey of independent producers “found that the effective tax rate for theindustry [was] 20 percent greater than other industries.”  (Independent Petroleum Association of America, “DomesticOil and Natural Gas Producers Call on Congress for Fairer, More Competitive Tax System,” July 31, 1996, obtainedfrom http://www.ipaa.org, October 29, 1997.)  Given that the majors have a lower effective tax rate than other
industries, and that independents are eligible for additional tax breaks, IPAA’s finding seems counterintuitive.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
2-935 percent.  However, as Exhibit 2-3 shows, integrated producers have paid roughly 25
percentage points less in taxes than their statutory rates suggest they owe.  This differential isevidence of the substantial tax breaks they have received over the past 20 years.
Special provisions reduced integrated producers’ tax liabilities by roughly $7.0 billion in
1995.  This approach yields subsidy estimates nearly $3 billion higher than what we calculatedon a provision-by-provision approach.  About $1 billion of this differential can be accounted forby the fraction of foreign tax credits claimed and state/local tax deductions that are properlyexcluded from U.S. taxable income to avoid double taxation.  This leaves a $2 billiondiscrepancy between the two estimation methods that we are unable to reconcile given availabledata.  Due to this limitation, we use the lower estimates for tax subsidies, calculated on aprovision-by-provision basis, in our totals.  Although this approach is more conservative, it mayunderstate the value of tax breaks to oil.
Exhibit 2-3 also illustrates that the Alternative Minimum Tax provisions, implemented to
ensure that all profitable companies pay a fair tax regardless of tax preference items, have madelittle difference in the taxes owed by the integrated energy firms included in the EIA survey.
Other tax data made available by EIA (see Exhibit 2-4) indicate that the production part
of the oil fuel cycle benefits from substantially lower taxes overall than downstream operations,and that global tax rates on all oil operations have fallen since 1980.  In 1995, integrated oilcompanies had an aggregate effective tax rate for federal, state, local, and foreign taxes of 37percent for their U.S. refining, marketing, and transportation operations, compared to only 20.3percent for domestic production.
22
2.2 THE EVER-CHANGING TAX ENVIRONMENT: NEW TAX BREAKS FOR OIL
While tax expenditure provisions expire, others are enacted with each new tax bill passed
by Congress.  In this ever-changing arena, continued vigilance is necessary to provide an up-to-date picture of subsidies.  The recently passed Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997  (TRA) is an example
of a very large (though fairly infrequent) revision of the tax code that often contains many newtax subsidies.  This specific act contained approximately $130 billion in new tax breaks.
We analyzed TRA to identify components that provide new subsidies to oil, and found a
few new provisions that benefit the industry.
23  None of these items are included in our quantified
subsidies since they were not in effect during 1995, our base year.

23 The proposed H.R. 1648, “The National Security Act of 1997,” contained five provisions increasing
subsidies to oil production, but only one was eventually integrated in TRA 1997.  The defeated provisions includedan attempt to count water reinjection to maintain well pressure (a process used by most wells) as “advanced”recovery eligible for the enhanced oil recovery tax credit.  They also included a provision to expand capital expensesthat could be deducted from taxes immediately.

2-12• Increased ability to utilize existing oil and gas percentage depletion
allowance.   Existing rules cap the ability of firms to offset their taxes with
the percentage depletion allowance.  These rules have reduced the value ofthis tax subsidy to larger producers over the past twenty years.  TRArelaxes these rules, increasing the ability of existing producers to use theexisting provision by about $70 million between 1998 and 2000.  Ascurrently written, this provision will exist for only two fiscal years.  Thus,once the subsidy is annualized and pro-rated between oil and gas, themarket impacts are not likely to be substantial.  However, short-termprovisions are often extended year-after-year for decades.  Extensionswould increase the importance of the subsidy substantially.
• Increased Ability to Utilize Existing Accelerated Depreciation
Provisions.   The Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) was developed to ensure
that all profit-making entities paid a minimum level of tax, despite therange of tax breaks available to them.  One aspect of the AMT was slowerdepreciation than available to non-AMT taxpayers.  TRA eliminates thisdistinction.  As a result, the provision effectively reduces the minimum taxlevel under AMT and increases the losses to the Treasury under thestandard accelerated depreciation provisions.  The Joint Committee onTaxation estimates that incremental losses to the Treasury will be $18.3billion for FY1997 through FY2007 from all industries.
24  Allocating this
subsidy based on oil’s share of total AMT payments yields a new subsidyto oil worth $770 million, or about $70 million per year.
25  Allocating
based on the oil sector’s share of total capital spending yields a similarresult.
• Elimination of the use of motor fuels tax receipts for deficit reduction.
Road transportation is almost entirely dependent on oil, and cars and
trucks provide the fuel’s primary market.  A tax on gasoline and diesel fuelfinances many of the country’s roads.  For the past several years, a portionof the gasoline tax went to deficit reduction rather than to roadconstruction.  These funds offset a portion of the general taxes now used tobuild roads.
26  TRA eliminated the use of any of the motor fuels tax

dollars of general tax revenues supplement the gasoline excise tax to finance road construction and repair.  See, forexample, U. S. Energy Information Administration, Federal Energy Subsidies: Direct and Indirect Interventions in

2.3 SPECIAL TAXES ON OIL
As we discussed at the beginning of this chapter, the government levies many fees on the
oil industry.  Some fees reflect the baseline treatment of all industries in the economy, whileothers specifically target the oil.  Of this latter category, “user fees” reimburse the governmentfor its oil-related activities, while “special taxes” increase oil’s general tax burden above thenormal baseline for all industries.  In this report, we deduct user fees from the specific oil-relatedprograms they help fund.  We treat special taxes as a general offset to overall subsidies.
Exhibit 2-5 summarizes federal taxes specific to oil.  Nearly all of these levies are user
fees because they serve to address issues associated with oil production and consumption, such asleaking storage tanks and spills.  The largest federal levy, that on motor fuels, pays for theconstruction of roads.  While not related to oil production per se, it is clear that the public
construction of highways greatly benefits oil producers since the primary demand for oil is fromthe cars and trucks using these roads.  Thus, the motor fuels tax, like many other federal taxes onoil, is appropriately treated as a user fee.
At the Federal level, the only levy on oil that qualifies as a “special tax” on industry is the
crude oil windfall profits tax, which was created to prevent the oil industry from selling existingreserves at the higher market price that prevailed during the oil price shocks.  In many marketswith short-term scarcities that lead to windfall profits for a period of time, the government rarelyintervenes to levy a special tax as it did for oil.  However, the windfall profits tax was no longerin effect in 1995, so it does not affect our analysis.

Notes:
(1) Both provisions include some tax collections from oil that are used for non-oil purposes (e.g., deficit reduction and electr ic trains and
trolleys).  Thus, a portion of these provisions are special taxes on oil that offset some of the billions of dollars from the g eneral fund 
used to build road infrastructure.  Full accounting of these programs would both deduct these special taxes from the oil subsid y totals 
and add spending for road building to those totals.  Because we have not evaluated subsidies to highways in this report, we do not 
deduct these special taxes either.

2-152.4 SUMMARY
Tax subsidies to oil remain an important source of government support for the oil fuel
cycle, providing $1.9 to $4.1 billion in benefits during 1995.  Efforts to curb special tax breaks,which culminated with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, have been steadily eroded over the past tenyears.  Tax rates on integrated operations of large oil producers were only 12 percent in 1995,versus a statutory rate of 35 percent.  In the 1990s, rates have been at their lowest levels since theEnergy Information Administration began tracking the data in 1977.  Congressional effortscontinue to try to broaden the definition of existing tax breaks for oil and gas, including threeprovisions of benefit to the industry contained in the recently enacted Taxpayer Relief Act of1997.  Greater efforts are needed to reduce tax subsidies to oil, encouraging improved pricesignals to investors, producers, and consumers.

3-1FEDERAL AGENCY PROGRAMS SUPPORTING OIL CHAPTER 3
 
Many types of government programs subsidize oil, with different programs benefiting
each stage of the oil fuel cycle.  Government labs invest in research and development of directbenefit to the industry.  Government employees gather and publish basic industry or geologicaldata that helps oil producers decide where and when to invest.  Government entities also buildand maintain vital transportation infrastructure heavily used to move both crude and refinedproducts, ensure safe and environmentally sound operations at oil extraction sites, and guaranteeor subsidize loans used by the industry to invest in new operations or to sell equipment to higherrisk customers.  Unless the industry is charged for these services, government involvementreduces the risk of, or increases the returns to, oil-related activities.  The effect is to encouragegreater investment in, and production of, oil.
This chapter summarizes most federal program subsidies.  Where programs receive
funding from user fees, the net subsidy costs of the program are reduced accordingly.  Exhibit 3-1 summarizes net program subsidies to oil.  Exhibit 3-2 illustrates the programs with substantialcost recovery now in place.  Government programs to ensure the stability of oil supplies arediscussed in Chapter 4, and programs to oversee oil leasing activities are discussed in Chapter 6.A more detailed presentation of estimates for each individual agency program, as well asinformation on data sources, can be found in the Appendix to this report.
3.1 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
General support for research and development (R&D) can help industries identify
promising approaches for oil exploration, production, and processing, and reduce the cost ofresearching new technologies.  The federal government, through the U.S. Department of Energy(DOE) and its predecessor agencies, has a history of heavily funding energy research.  Since1980, only NASA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Health and HumanServices have spent more on R&D.

3-4The pattern of federal support for R&D can influence which energy technologies are
commercialized and when.  Historically, the pattern of federal R&D spending for energy hasfavored fossil and nuclear energy over renewables and efficiency.  Between 1950 and 1993, thegovernment allocated 22 percent of its energy R&D expenditures to fossil fuels, 63 percent tonuclear fission and fusion, and only 16 percent to renewables and efficiency combined.
29  This
pattern had begun to shift by 1995, with funding moving away from nuclear energy to renewablesand efficiency.  However, fossil fuels, primarily coal and oil, still received almost one-quarter (23percent) of total R&D spending, albeit of a much smaller federal R&D pie.
30  Nonetheless,
decades of favoritism for petroleum has contributed to innovations and improvements thatreduced the cost of oil extraction and development.  During 1995, DOE continued to provide$808 million in subsidies to fossil fuels, of which $118 million supported oil.
31,32  This amount
could easily have been borne by the oil companies themselves.
In terms of private R&D, the petroleum extraction and refining sector had one of the
lowest R&D investment levels among all industries, averaging only 0.9 percent of sales between1983 and 1993.  The average for all manufacturing sectors during that same period was over 3percent of sales.
33  One possible explanation for this low investment is that public support for
R&D allowed the industry to reduce its spending.  Another reason may be that oil service firms,rather than the major oil producers, have been the source of higher R&D spending levels, andthat this spending is not reflected in aggregate statistics.
3.2 PROVISION OF BASIC INDUSTRY INFORMATION
Every business requires data on its competitive environment.  In the oil industry, this
information includes basic data on oil deposits and geology, production and distribution, andprices.  The federal government has long provided these data at little or no charge.  For example,the Energy Information Administration within the Department of Energy provides a host of basicdata on oil prices, production, and investment that is of substantial benefit to both oil producersand consumers.  Similarly, the U.S. Geological Survey has provided core data on mineralresources for most of this century.  These two programs cost taxpayers between $74 and $97million for oil-related activities in 1995.  While industry often supplements the data they provide,

3-5the availability of baseline information helps firms to focus their efforts.  In many other
industries, these data are gathered by the private sector and sold to interested firms rather thanfinanced by the taxpayer.
3.3 TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE
Oil is often extracted thousands of miles from the point of consumption.  Thus,
transporting the oil is an extremely important factor in oil economics.  Nearly all of the crude oilmoved in the United States travels by pipeline or by water.  Water shipments in the coastal areasof the country move by tanker, whereas shipments on the inland waterways move by both tankerand barge.  Refined products are shipped via a wider range of modes, including barge, rail, road,and pipeline.
3.3.1    Coastal and Inland Waterways
Water transportation infrastructure is a good example of a general subsidy that
substantially benefits oil and distorts energy markets.  Although oil is not the only commodityshipped through U.S. ports and inland waterways, it is one of the main commodities.  Crude oiland refined products comprised 38 percent of all waterborne tonnage transported in 1995.  Whilecrude oil comprises a much larger share of coastal shipping than refined products, the situation isreversed for inland transport.
34
Historical subsidies to water infrastructure have helped to reduce the overall cost
structure of water shipments for oil.  Most of the costs of capital infrastructure development werefinanced through Congressional appropriations, and there has been no attempt to recover thesehistoric costs through increased charges on current users.  Between 1950 and 1977, an estimated$13.6 billion (1995 dollars) of federal spending on water infrastructure accrued to the petroleumsector.
35
The government continues to provide substantial support for water transport.  The Army
Corps of Engineers is heavily involved with building and maintaining ports, harbors, and thenation’s inland water transportation system.  Dredging of harbors and waterways, as well as theconstruction and operation of locks, benefit oil shippers.  The U.S. Coast Guard also plays animportant role in regulating coastal shipping.  Activities benefiting oil transport include shippinglane and navigational maintenance and improvements (including ice clearing); shipping channelpatrol; oil spill prevention and response; and inspection of waterfront facilities, including transferpipelines used to unload oil tankers.  Although the share of these programs’ costs borne by usershas risen over time, subsidies remain.

3-6Our subsidy estimates for both the Army Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard pro-
rate total subsidies for water transport based on oil’s share of total tonnage shipped, and theydeduct all user fees collected to support the programs.
36  In 1995, the Army Corps conferred over
$235 million in subsidies to oil.  Subsidies through the Coast Guard were over $450 million.
3.3.2    Shipping
In addition to subsidies for water infrastructure and services, the federal government
provides shipping subsidies to U.S.-flag vessels, including oil tankers, through the MaritimeAdministration, or MARAD.  MARAD’s objective is to increase the competitiveness andproductivity of the U.S. Merchant Marine.  Toward that end, it provides operating subsidies toU.S.-flag ship operators engaged in foreign commerce in order to offset the differences in U.S.and foreign operating costs.  In the past, MARAD also subsidized certain construction costs formerchant ships when U.S. costs exceeded those in other countries.  We estimate that MARADprovided approximately $80 million in subsidies to oil-related shipping in 1995.
3.3.3    Pipelines
Government involvement with pipelines is centered on rate and safety regulation
(described in the next section) and provision of rights-of-way (discussed in Chapter 6).  We didnot identify any examples at the federal level of public money being used to build or maintainpipeline infrastructure.
3.4 GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT OF INDUSTRY BEHAVIOR
The federal government regulates occupational health and environmental issues of the oil
industry, as well as oversees rate setting in pipeline natural monopolies.  If oil requires asignificantly higher level of public oversight than substitute energy sources, financing thisoversight from general tax revenues rather than user fees will hide important price signals aboutthe relative economics of energy alternatives.
A variety of federal agencies provide environmental oversight of oil.  The Environmental
Protection Agency regulates emissions to air, land, and water.  The Fish and Wildlife Service andthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration both evaluate impacts of oil onecosystems.  The Coast Guard and the Office of Pipeline Safety oversee oil pipelines and transferstations to prevent leaks and spills.  Finally, the Coast Guard, EPA, and the Navy Supervisor ofSalvage respond to oil spills and assist in clean-ups.  Some, but not all, of these costs ofenvironmental oversight are recovered from the industry through user fees.  For example, the OilPollution Act (described in Chapter 5) allows agencies to recover costs related to oil spills from
                                                          
36 Note that allocating total subsidies by tonnage moved may understate the true subsidies to oil, especially
in the case of ports and harbors.  To the extent that oil tankers are the deepest ships using these facilities, proper costaccounting would assign oil the full cost of dredging or other harbor modifications required to handle this type ofvessel.

3-7responsible parties and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which was created through a tax on oil.
However, no mechanism exists for recovering the costs of other types environmental oversight,such as EPA’s responsibilities for ensuring the safety of the oil industry’s emissions.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates pipeline rates.  However, the full
cost of this oversight is recovered through user fees; thus, FERC does not provide a net subsidyto oil.
3.5 CREDIT PROGRAMS SUPPORTING EXPORT OF OIL-RELATED GOODS
AND SERVICES
Most subsidies to oil encourage additional domestic production or consumption.
However, a handful of lending programs provide subsidies to U.S. firms in the oil sector whowish to export their equipment or expertise to other countries.  The U.S. Export-Import Bank(Eximbank) and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) both serve to promote U.S.industry abroad.  The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), to which theU.S. is a major contributor, focus on developing specific industrial sectors in specific countries.Although their primary focus is not on U.S. business, U.S. firms are substantial beneficiaries oftheir lending activity.
3.5.1    How Credit Subsidies Work
The lending institutions provide credit subsidies in three main ways:  below-market loans,
loan guarantees, and below-market credit insurance.  Below-market loans provide borrowers withartificially low interest rates.  In some cases interest rates are so low (as in the case ofconcessional loans) that the loan is essentially a grant.  Loan guarantees also indirectly provideborrowers with lower interest rates.  Guarantees by financially strong institutions such asEximbank reduce the risks to commercial lending banks, allowing them to charge the borrowerlower rates than would otherwise be available for a given level of risk.  Finally, below-marketcredit insurance provides companies with artificially low costs of insuring against business andpolitical risks.
All of these instruments have two levels of subsidy.  The first, the cost to the taxpayer,
measures the lending programs' losses.  One source of losses is the difference between theinterest rate (or insurance premium) that a borrower pays, and the cost of those funds (orinsurance) to the federal government.  If OPIC, for example, borrows money from the Treasury atan interest rate of eight percent and lends it to Joe’s Oil Company at six percent to develop an oilfield in Algeria, the immediate subsidy would be two percent.  The total cost to the taxpayerwould also include the cost of making and overseeing loans, which banks normally recoverthrough the interest and fees they charge, as well as any uncovered losses from loan defaults orinsurance claims.  The percentage of the government’s full cost of running a credit program thatis recovered from beneficiaries varies widely by program.  We depict this range of cost recoveryin Exhibit 3-3.

Notes
(1) Chart is illustrative.  Absolute and relative size of components will vary by type of loan and type of lender.  The subsidy cost to taxpayers equals the government’s full recovery interest
rate minus what it actually charges (A-B).  The value of the lending subsidy to recipients equals the private interest rate min us what the government charged (D minus B or C minus B,
depending on the program).  This difference is also referred to as the value of government intermediation.
(2) Depending on program goals, interest rates charged to borrowers can fall anywhere within this range.
(3) Appropriate default premium varies by loan.  Premiums that are too small yield uncovered losses, which are common in many go vernment lending programs.  Federal loan guarantees
shift default risks (they are not eliminated) from the private sector to the government, allowing private lenders to charge low er interest rates to borrowers.  Default premium subsidies are
very difficult to estimate ahead of time; however, historical data on actual defaults can provide a good proxy value.
(4) Private lenders need to earn a minimum return in order to continue lending.  Government programs do not.(5) Federal government’s large size often enables it to obtain a lower interest rate than private companies, even before default  premium is taken into account.Exhibit 3-3

3-9The second level of subsidy, also shown in Exhibit 3-3, is a bit more complicated.  Even
if the government-supported banks were to recover their costs of operations from borrowers, theymight still confer a large subsidy to the recipient sectors.  The banks are large institutions that canborrow at or very near the federal government’s cost of funds.  Investors view the risk of thefederal government not paying back loans as so remote that the rate charged the Treasury is oftencalled the “risk free rate.”  A similar situation holds true for insurance programs:  the federalgovernment’s cost of capital to finance an insurance program is lower than what would beavailable to private firms.  Because it has access to less expensive capital, the government cancharge lower interest rates and insurance premiums than private companies.  Costs are reducedstill further by the fact that the government is a non-profit entity, and thus does not mark up itsrates to earn a return.  Finally, the government often provides higher risk loans and insurancepolicies than private institutions may be willing to make.
By going through a government-supported bank, Joe’s Oil can borrow money or purchase
insurance at lower rates than would be available to it from private institutions.  It may also beable to obtain loans and insurance for business in high risk countries that its private bank issimply unwilling to offer.  The difference between what the company pays the government-supported bank and what it would have to pay a private institution is captured in our highestimate (which we call the value of government intermediation) and provides the best measureof the value of the credit programs to the recipient.
Credit programs have been some of Congress’ favorite ways to confer subsidies.
Although the programs provide tangible benefits to recipients, the cost of the subsidies hashistorically been fairly invisible to outsiders.  In some cases, the programs can confer benefits toindustry without losses to the government.  In other cases, programs (such as loan guarantees) donot require immediate outlays of cash, and program losses often do not become visible untilmany years later.
The attractiveness of these programs is apparent in the fact that outstanding direct loan
and guaranteed loan balances for federal credit programs are approaching $1 trillion.
37  To better
control these programs, a number of laws have been passed over the past ten years governing themeasuring, reporting, and auditing of credit subsidies.
38  These laws eliminated the previous
practice of recording lending on a cash basis -- an approach that makes loan guarantees all butinvisible until they begin to default.  Overall, the laws have greatly improved the federalgovernment’s ability to track the likely long-term financial impact of lending programs on theTreasury.  However, credit reform provides few insights as to the value of government loans andguarantees to the private sector, the second level of subsidy described above.

3-103.5.2    Subsidies to Oil Through Credit Programs
Since not every energy firm has access to cheap loans or insurance from the governmental
lending institutions, the banks’ patterns of involvement can distort the relative economics ofdifferent forms of energy.  The importance of distortions from these lending programs should notbe underestimated: they have heavily favored established fossil fuels over emerging renewablesand end-use efficiency.  Between 1980 and 1989, for example, more than 70 percent ofEximbank’s energy sector loans and guarantees went to fossil fuels; support for non-hydrorenewables and efficiency during that same period was negligible.  Support for the energy sectorthrough the multilateral development banks followed a similar pattern for the 1980 to 1988period, with 48 percent going to fossil fuel (three quarters of this to coal and oil) versus onepercent for non-hydro renewables and efficiency.
39
As shown in Exhibit 3-4, this pattern of support has continued into the 1990s.  Especially
within both OPIC and Eximbank, energy continues to be an extremely important component oftheir lending activity, yet very little financial support benefits end-use efficiency and non-hydrorenewables.  Support for oil exceeds 40 percent of the energy commitments of the InternationalFinance Corporation and Eximbank’s guarantees and insurance program.  Oil comprised 24 and40 percent of OPIC’s and Eximbank’s energy commitments, respectively.
The value of this support is quite large.  Exhibit 3-5 compares the government and private
costs of capital for 1995.  Government debt is the least expensive source of funds by far, at 6.9percent.  The highest grade (i.e., lowest default risk) corporations had to pay nearly three-quartersof a percentage point more to borrow funds.  In reality, corporate expansions are financed notonly through debt but also through stock (equity), which is a more expensive source of funds.The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimates the cost of funds to a particular firm (orindustry) given the existing mix of debt and equity.  The WACC for the largest oil refiningcompanies was 10.7 percent.  The average cost of capital in the higher risk oil and gas extractionindustry was over 14 percent, more than double the direct cost of government debt.  Thus, the
government can provide loans at interest rates considerably lower than the oil industry mayotherwise be charged.
Measuring the subsidies to oil through international lending programs is a surprisingly
difficult task.  The basic information required is standard data used by the banks to track loan andinsurance disbursements and performance.  Since all the banks publish audited financial reports,all must use transaction-by-transaction data on non-performance to estimate annual losses andwrite-offs on their activities.  Yet, very little of this data is contained in any of the banks’standard reports.  In addition, formal requests for information that we submitted to bothEximbank and OPIC suggest that these basic data are dispersed across an array of bank databasesand not tracked in any routine manner.  Neither bank was able to fulfill our data requests in atimely or efficient manner.  As a result, we were unable to aggregate total subsidies to oil usingloan-specific data.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
3-13Data reported by both Eximbank and OPIC under the Credit Reform Act in their annual
reports did enable us to make a rough estimate of those banks’ overall direct credit subsidies foroil.
40  Due to the unavailability of transaction-specific data on lending and insurance
performance, we have pro-rated the bank’s overall losses according to oil’s share of each bank’stotal commitments.  The implicit assumption is that the banks’ losses for individual sectors areproportionate to each sector’s share of total commitments.  We were not able to estimatesubsidies from the World Bank and its affiliates because they did not report data on loanperformance in a similar way.
Exhibit 3-6 shows our estimate of Eximbank’s and OPIC’s subsidies to oil.  Our low
estimate represents the cost to the Treasury in FY1995 of OPIC and Eximbank commitmentsrelated to oil.  This cost has three components:  anticipated losses on new commitments madeduring FY1995, the 1995 installment on losses from obligations in each bank’s portfolio madeprior to Credit Reform, and administrative costs not recovered through fees charged to clients.We estimate the sum of these costs for oil-related commitments at $10 million for OPIC andnearly $200 million for Eximbank.  The vastly different sizes mirror the banks’ differentmissions.  OPIC expects to break even on operations.  Eximbank serves to help U.S. exporterscompete by setting terms “commensurate with those available from foreign export creditagencies,” and it does not expect to break even.
41
While our low estimate reflects the cost to the Treasury of the banks’ oil-related
commitments, our high estimate also incorporates the value of the commitments to the recipientcompanies.  This estimate recognizes that because both OPIC and Eximbank can borrow moneyfrom the U.S. Treasury at extremely low interest rates, they are able to pass these savings throughto their borrowers in the form of below-market interest rates and insurance premiums.  It alsorecognizes that private banks are willing to provide loans at lower rates when guaranteed bygovernment-supported banks.  These benefits are independent of the subsidies provided by thegovernment’s failure to recover the costs of its programs.  Following the approach used by theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we estimate the value of thesebenefits at one percent of all outstanding commitments related to oil.
42  The total value of our
high estimate is the sum of our low estimate (i.e., the cost to the Treasury) plus this incrementalbenefit to the recipient companies.  As shown in Exhibit 3-6, our high estimate for the subsidiesprovided by OPIC and Eximbank are approximately $31 million and $241 million, respectively.

3-153.6 CONSUMPTION SUBSIDIES
The primary program used to subsidize oil consumption is the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP), run by the Department of Health and Human Services.  As itsname implies, LIHEAP helps low-income households to heat and cool their homes.  Part of thefunding also supports weatherization assistance.  Although not directly targeted at oil, about $275million in LIHEAP funds were used to purchase the fuel in 1995.  An increased emphasis onweatherization in the short term could help reduce the need for subsidized oil purchases over thelong term.
3.7 SUMMARY
Numerous federal agencies provide services of value to the oil industry.  Some of the
most valuable subsidies, such as loan guarantees, are also among the most difficult to track andquantify.  Federal programs providing research and development support, basic industryinformation, industry oversight, transportation infrastructure, export financing, and consumptionsubsidies provide between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion per year in subsidies to oil.  Thesesubsidized services reduce the cost of oil-related investment and consumption while increasingthe federal budget deficit.

4-1DEFENDING OIL SUPPLIES CHAPTER 4
 
The United States needs oil.  Despite some progress on alternatives, oil continues to fuel
our transportation fleet and our military.  However, much of the nation’s oil is transportedthrough fairly precarious means.  Approximately, 25 percent of our domestic crude flows throughthe Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, and about 45 percent of our total petroleum consumption istransported through a limited number of oil tanker channels.
43,44  These delivery systems are
vulnerable to disruption.
Markets react in three primary ways to vulnerable supplies.  First, they demand a higher
price to reflect the higher risks.  Second, they invest in approaches to make the supply less risky.This includes diversification of suppliers, the development of new supplies, the establishment ofstockpiles to cover demand if supply is interrupted, and the attempt to reduce the likelihood ofsupply disruptions.  Third, markets develop substitute materials and ways to use the limitedsupplies more efficiently.
In the oil industry, corporations have invested in diversifying their supply base across
countries.  However, it has been the United States government, rather than private firms, that hasdeveloped the largest stockpiles (such as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, described later in thischapter) and spent billions of dollars in defense costs to reduce the likelihood of supplyinterruptions and price shocks.  Because the government has borne these costs of securingsupply, they are not reflected in the current price of oil.  Thus, producers and consumers lackimportant price signals that would encourage investment in substitutes.  The government’s costsact as a subsidy to oil.  We estimate the costs of defending oil shipments and stockpiling reservesfor our base year, 1995.  This estimate has two elements:  defending oil shipments from thePersian Gulf and the costs of building and maintaining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  We alsoqualitatively discuss oil-related military activities within Alaska.  In order for markets to makewell-informed decisions between energy types, these costs should be reflected in the price we payfor oil.

4-24.1 MIDDLE EAST OIL SECURITY
Although the Middle East supplies approximately 27 percent of the world’s crude oil, the
bulk of its production goes to Europe and Japan, not to the United States.45,46  Nevertheless, the
United States is not insulated from the market impacts of disruptions in Persian Gulf oilproduction. The current market share of the region’s producers, as well as their share of known,low-cost reserves, influence markets.  Changes in Middle East crude prices strongly affect worldoil prices, and with them the United States.
Given the importance of oil in the world economy, events in the Middle East can severely
impact economic stability worldwide.  The economic importance of the region and its traditionalinstability have motivated a large U.S. military focus on the Middle East, and this focus has beenclearly linked to oil even by Department of Defense personnel.
47  The protection from price
spikes that DoD provides greatly benefits oil consumers worldwide.  A separate question iswhether the military’s presence in the Middle East also benefits producers.  To some degree, theanswer is yes.  The military presence protects industry investments in oil extraction and shippinginfrastructure from hostile action.  This protection directly reduces the cost of regionaloperations.  However, price stability can hurt some producers in the short-term who wouldbenefit from the price surges that sometimes accompany supply disruptions.  In addition, themilitary’s activities related to the Middle East clearly hurt domestic oil producers in the short-term, since they must compete with imports that do not reflect the military defense component intheir delivered cost to U.S. markets.
 48
                                                          
45 This figure is based on a ten year weighted average for the period 1986 to 1995.  The Middle East’s share
of oil production rose more than eight percent over that period, to approximately 30 percent in 1995.  See U.S.Energy Information Administration, International Energy Annual 1995 , December 1996, Table 2.2.
46 In 1995, the United States had net petroleum imports from the Persian Gulf of 1.563 million barrels per
day versus 3.365 and 3.979 million barrels per day for Europe and Japan, respectively.  See U.S. Energy InformationAdministration, International Petroleum Statistics Report , September 1997.
47 Joshua Gotbaum, DoD’s Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security, was very candid about
DoD’s role in securing oil supplies and defending economic security in his testimony before the Senate Committeeon Foreign Relations.  In his prepared statement he wrote: “As this committee is only too well aware, the economichealth of our Nation and its allies has on several occasions been severely affected by events in the Middle East, andtheir effect on oil supplies and prices.  And it is the need to defend against military threats to such national intereststhat gives rise to the second perspective from which DoD must address the issue of U.S. dependence on stable globaloil markets.  The Department of Defense must be prepared to protect U.S. interests around the globe, wherever theymay be threatened.  This requires that we maintain the forces necessary to deter or defend against aggression.  One ofthe key challenges that we face today is determining the appropriate strategy and force structure for the post-cold warera and to manage properly the drawdown of our forces without sacrificing the readiness to respond to threats in anincreasingly complex world.  And while that force structure is not predicated on meeting any single military threat,or protecting any single national interest, protecting against military threats to global oil supplies is an importantfactor for which we must be prepared.”  Joshua Gotbaum, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security,U.S. Department of Defense, United States Dependence on Foreign Oil, hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations,  Senate Hearing 104-21, March 27, 1995, p. 24-25.
48 The long-term impacts are less certain, as long-term volatility in prices could lead to permanent shifts
away from oil, hurting the interests of all producers, both domestic and foreign.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-3In the following section, we quantify the subsidy from oil defense in the Persian Gulf.
Deriving this estimate entails two main steps:  estimating total U.S. military spending in theregion and pro-rating an appropriate share of this spending to oil.  Both of these steps are fairlycomplicated, and we discuss them in detail below.  In addition, we evaluate which sectors of theoil market are most likely to benefit from the subsidy.
4.1.1    Military Spending in the Persian Gulf
Estimating the military costs for ensuring the security of the Middle East oil supply is not
a clear-cut task.  The Department of Defense neither reports its expenditures by geographic areanor by military objective.  However, DoD and private researchers have provided estimates ofdefense costs for the Middle East region.  They have used three main methods to do so:
• Total Cost Approach.   The total cost approach allocates the military’s
entire conventional force budget geographically.  The approach pro-ratesthe budget according to the estimated percentage of the military’s activeforce structure that serves objectives in a region.
49  Thus, it considers the
distribution of active combat units as a proxy for the geographic allocationof all defense resources, including general costs such as training andheadquarters support.  The approach generally uses routine, peacetimeoperations to avoid temporary biases caused by periodic regional flare-ups.However, some researchers add a premium for war risks, reflecting theexpected value of a war occurring in any particular year.
• Partial Cost Approach.   The partial cost approach estimates the full value
of all operations that directly benefit the military’s objectives in a region.It is the sum of the force, equipment, and support costs that serve theregion. Unlike the total cost approach, it does not attempt to allocate theportion of DoD’s budget that serves the military’s activities as a whole.
• Marginal Cost Approach.   This approach tries to assess the degree to
which military spending would decline if there were no longer anyobjectives in a region. The estimates vary depending on whether oneincludes only short-term changes in operations or both short and long-termchanges.  In the short-term, cost savings include only the costs ofoperations that are dedicated exclusively to the region and are not usefulfor meeting objectives elsewhere.  In the long-term, the military mayrealize added savings by restructuring to more efficiently fulfill remainingobjectives.  Thus, differences between the short-term and long-termmarginal costs of an objective can be substantial.  In addition, the marginal
                                                          
49 The total cost approach requires that combat units be assigned to individual regions.  In reality, the
military does not follow such rigid geographic assignments.  Units may serve objectives over a broader area.  Inaddition, they are often useful for meeting contingencies elsewhere.  Under the total cost approach, they aregenerally assigned to the regions that are perceived as their primary areas of concern.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-4cost approach varies as to whether direct costs in the field alone are
included, or whether support provided at the headquarters level is includedas well.
Exhibit 4-1 lists the primary estimates for the cost of the military presence in the Gulf.
To improve the comparability of estimates made in different years, we scaled the values tostandard 1995 dollars using the GDP implicit price deflator.  Once this adjustment has beenmade, the Persian Gulf total cost estimates range between $50 and $79 billion per year.
50  GAO’s
partial cost estimate adjusts to $31 billion annually, and CRS’s estimate of short-term marginalcosts adjusts to roughly $500 million annually.
 51
The GAO and CRS estimates are based on numbers provided by DoD that may be
inaccurately low.  DoD’s numbers reflect costs in the 1980s, but DoD’s presence in the PersianGulf appears to have increased since then (see note 51).  While the CRS short-term marginal costestimate is about $500 million for all objectives in Southwest Asia (scaled to 1995), DoD soughtsupplemental funding of $630 million that year for the incremental cost of heightened operationsin the Persian Gulf resulting from perceived Iraqi threats to Kuwait.
52  That figure is for
supplemental costs alone, and does not include any of DoD’s baseline marginal costs for theregion, raising questions regarding the accuracy of the estimate.  Methodological issues aside,existing analyses suggest an extremely wide range of Persian Gulf defense costs -- from $500million to $79 billion per year.
                                                          
50 Total cost estimates from Ravenal, Kaufmann and Steinbruner, and Copulos.  Detailed sourcing is shown
on Exhibit 4-1.
51 We were unable to make a second adjustment for changes in real military spending for the Persian Gulf.
Between 1988 and 1996, DoD reduced its personnel by 27 percent, and real military spending decreased by an equalamount.  However, over that same period, DoD increased the number of personnel ashore, naval deployments, andland-based prepositioned equipment in the Persian Gulf.  The increased attention given to the Persian Gulf is seen inthe rising trend of Ravenal's cost estimates during the 1990s (see Exhibit 4-1).  Because trends in the Persian Gulf donot appear to mirror trends in the military as a whole, simple metrics such as changes in total real military spendingwould not be valid as a scaling factor.  Unfortunately, detailed historic annual data on the geographic attribution offorce structure were not available.

Notes:
(1)  Estimates are adjusted to 1995 dollars using the GDP price deflator.  
(2)  We allocate 33.3 percent of DoD spending in the Middle East to oil.  This percentage is based on an even split of spending  among DoD's major objectives 
       in the region:  ensuring regional stability, the supply of oil, and the safety of U.S. citizens.  Both Ravenal and Deluc chi and Murphy believe that oil accounts for 
       a larger percentage of spending (50-100 percent), arguing that securing supply is the largest, most important mission in  the region.
(3)  Total cost estimates reflect all spending related to the Middle East, regardless of whether such costs potentially serve o bjectives in other regions as well.  These
       estimates include a share of DoD's general costs (e.g., overhead, support, training).  Partial estimates are equivalent to total costs, but without the share of general 
       spending.  Thus, they reflect spending only for those operations directly related to meeting Middle East objectives.  Ma rginal cost estimates reflect spending that is 
       specific to the Middle East, or the incremental spending that would disappear immediately in the absence of U.S. objecti ves in the Middle East.
(4)  This estimate includes peacetime defense costs for the Middle East.  Ravenal allocates DoD's conventional forces budget ba sed on the peacetime

(5)  This estimate includes Ravenal's estimate of peacetime defense costs plus his conventional war risk premium.  The premium is the product of Ravenal's 
       estimate of the costs and probability of the U.S. engaging in a conventional war in the region.  See Note 4 and Exhibit 4-1a for more information about the estimate.
(6)  This estimate is based on DoD's FY1990 budget authority for conventional forces.  Kaufmann estimated the geographic alloca tion of the budget authority based 
      on the distribution of the military's active force structure.  For more information about this estimate see Exhibit 4-1a.(7)  According to Copulus, this estimate is the amount listed in DoD's 1988 budget under the category "Gulf Contingencies."(8)  This estimate reflects the incremental costs of Southwest Asian operations.

4-74.1.2    Pro-rating Total Spending to Oil
Once total spending in the region is bounded, we evaluate the portion of that spending
that is properly allocable to the defense of oil supplies versus other military objectives.  Defenseof oil shipments from the Persian Gulf is an example of common costs.  Below, we provide a
discussion of common costs in general and how to allocate such costs across products.  We thendiscuss common costs in the context of Persian Gulf defense.  Finally, based on our discussion ofcommon costs, we pro-rate a portion of the military’s Persian Gulf operations to oil.
4.1.2.1 Treatment of Common Costs
The term “common cost” refers to a situation in which two or more outputs are produced
simultaneously from the same production process.
53  The presence of the U.S. military in the
Persian Gulf region, along with all of the general overhead support that makes that presencepossible, is an example of such a “production process.”  The “outputs” are the multiple militaryobjectives of this presence.  Recently, analysts at the RAND Corporation identified three primarypurposes of the military activity related to the Persian Gulf region:
54
• Ensuring access to oil supplies
• Preserving regional stability
• Preventing the emergence of regional hegemonic powers
Common costs create challenges for allocating production costs to individual beneficiary
products.  What portion of the U.S. military costs for the region is properly attributed to ensuringaccess to oil supplies versus another, simultaneously produced objective such as preservingregional stability?  The analysis by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) cited in Exhibit4-1 attempted to answer this question indirectly using a marginal cost approach.  CRS estimatedsavings from defense reductions if the entire Middle East were no longer a U.S. strategic interest.Their result was a paltry $500 million in annual savings out of a total presence of $31.4 billion
                                                          
53 Shared production costs are often referred to as joint costs  rather than common costs.  In fact, joint costs
are a sub-set of common costs, and refer to situations in which a shared production process yields fixed proportionsof outputs, such as leather and beef from a cattle operation.  See Ben Johnson Associates, Inc.,  “Costing Definitionsand Concepts,” obtained from http://www.microeconomics.com/ essays/cost_def/cost_def.htm, January 27, 1998.
54 See Graham Fuller and Ian Lesser, “Persian Gulf Myths,” Foreign Affairs,  May/June 1997, pp. 42-52.
Fuller and Lesser, both with RAND, argue that supplemental objectives such as maintaining Israel’s security;maintaining preferential access to Gulf markets; and encouraging political and economic reform and human rights,while beneficial, are not policy drivers for the regional military presence.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-8(1995 dollars), or roughly 1.4 percent.55  The marginal savings from a change in the oil objective
alone, rather than the entire Middle East, would undoubtedly be smaller still.  For example, ifeach objective has the same marginal costs, the marginal savings from eliminating oil securitywould be one-third of the total, or less than $200 million per year.  Even if we are to assume forthe moment that the CRS did a true, long-term, assessment of marginal costs, the strong commoncost attributes of the defense presence (i.e., military forces are useful for more than one objectiveand in more than one region) make relatively small cost savings an inevitable and pre-ordainedresult of the marginal analysis.
Assessing the benefit of services provided at their very low marginal cost misrepresents
both the real costs and the value of this military presence.  In addition, the idea that the real costsshould not be attributed to individual beneficiaries at all because they are common costscontradicts standard practice in both industry and in other areas of government activity.
56
Consider, for example, expensive federally-owned dams.  The dam represents a massive commoncost that provides electricity, irrigation, and flood control services.  Once the dam is built, themarginal cost of any of these services is near zero -- yet the fixed costs must be paid bysomebody, and the government allocates these costs back to the various beneficiaries of the dam.
The issue with oil is not whether common defense costs should be allocated to
beneficiaries, but the fairest method of doing so.  The approaches developed to allocate commoncosts in other industries such as dairies and oil refineries provide some useful insights to valuingoil defense.
57
• Split-off points.   The production of a good or service involves multiple
steps.  Even where some of the steps are identical for two or more outputs,a careful assessment often reveals one or more “split-off points” whereinputs (and costs) can be isolated for a single output.  As shown on Exhibit
                                                          
55 The Congressional Research Service analysis is based on data developed in an earlier GAO Report.
Delucchi and Murphy conclude that the GAO estimates on which the CRS marginal cost analysis is based,understated defense costs by a large margin.  See (a) U.S. Congressional Research Service, The External Costs of Oil
Used in Transportation , 92-574 ENR, June 17, 1992, pp. 23-33; (b) U.S. General Accounting Office, Southwest
Asia:  Costs of Protecting U.S. Interests,  GAO/NSIAD-91-250, A ugust 1991; and (c) Mark Delucchi and James
Murphy, “U.S. Military Expenditures to Protect the User of Persian-Gulf Oil for Motor Vehicles,” Report #15 in theseries The Annualized Social Cost of Motor-Vehicle Use in the United States, Based on 1990-91 Data , UCD-ITS-
RR-93-3 (15), April 1996, pp. 9-12.
56 Bohi and Toman argue that the military outlay, “to the extent it can be associated with energy protection,
may be seen as a fixed cost that cannot be altered by marginal changes in energy prices and demands.  As such, it isnot relevant to energy policy.”  (See Douglas Bohi and Michael Toman, The Economics of Energy Security , Boston:
Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, p. 26.)  In fact, charging oil users for this protective service would very likelyhave an impact on energy demand patterns, by encouraging longer term shifts away from imported oil, or to moreefficient mechanisms of securing the oil supply on the part of regional producers.  Whether or not these marketchanges would then trigger longer-term military restructuring or simply reduced missions (i.e., no need to worryabout oil anymore) is a separate question.
57 Many other industries, such as organic chemicals, meat production, timber, and coal mining, have joint
and/or common costs as well.  Even more industries (airlines for example) have large fixed costs and nearly identical
production processes for different products or services provided.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-94-2, the split-off point for the military presence in the Persian Gulf divides
the baseline presence from the objective-specific activities both in the fieldand at the headquarters level.
To the extent that the cost of defense analysts in DoD’s Washington, DC
office who are focused on oil security can be identified, these costs areproperly allocated only to the oil-defense mission objective.  Similarly,when the Persian Gulf force undertakes actual missions, if these missionsare associated with oil rather than one of the other objectives, the costs arealso properly attributed to oil.  A similar line of reasoning would be usedfor costs specific to other objectives as well.  The remaining multi-objective (common) costs would be smaller than the total, but wouldnonetheless need to be allocated across the objectives.
• Bounding Common Costs.   Although common costs are impossible to
allocate precisely, economists have developed some rules that help boundthe reasonable costs attributable to a single output.  These conditions statethat the costs allocated to any activity should never be:
58
- Less than the costs that would be saved by discontinuing that activity
(i.e., its incremental cost), nor
- More than the costs that would be incurred if only that activity was
undertaken (i.e., its stand-alone cost).
Thus, the CRS estimates for the cost of oil defense (which we estimate as one-third of the
CRS estimate for total incremental costs in the region) form the absolute lower bound  for oil-
related defense costs.59  The upper bound, the stand-alone cost, would be equivalent to all oil-
                                                          
58 These bounding statements are referred to as “Baumol-Willig” conditions, after the economists that
developed the argument.  See Zolton Biro, “Cost Allocation in Principle and Practice,” London Economics, Ltd.,October 1994, obtained from http://www.londecon.co.uk/pubs/comp/costall.htm, January 27, 1998.
59 The use of the CRS estimate as a bounding value is complicated by a number of factors.  First, the CRS
measured the marginal cost of all Persian Gulf defense, not just the oil objective, although we have used their resultsto estimate a marginal cost for oil defense alone.  Second, their numbers seem to be downwardly-biased since theyappear to examine only immediate savings rather than savings from longer-term restructuring, and because they donot appear to have evaluated the marginal costs for Persian Gulf defense outside of the region (e.g., in headquarters).In addition, they originate with DoD, which is not a disinterested source.  As Ravenal puts it:  “When attempting tojustify its entire defense budget request, or when demonstrating to our allies that we are paying a disproportionateshare of the costs of an alliance, the Pentagon prefers to state its costs fully.  But when defending against proposedcuts, it claims that deleting this or that unit or program from the force structure or the budget would save only the tipof its marginal costs.”  (Ravenal, 1991, p. 19).

objective (oil defense) as they are for several objectives.  The stand-alone cost would likely beover 95 percent of the total costs of the Persian Gulf presence.
60
4.1.2.2 Allocating Common Costs Across Multiple Objectives
To determine a fair way to allocate costs among the various military objectives, consider
a less complex example than Persian Gulf defense -- that of a dairy.  The cost of buying, housing,and feeding the dairy herd must be recovered from the sale of milk if the farmer is to stay inbusiness.  Yet, a dairy takes in raw milk and converts it into a variety of products such as skimmilk, cream, and cheese.  The processing costs after the split-off point (the creation of newproducts from raw milk) may well be small relative to the common costs of caring for the herd.If none of these products are saddled with the costs of looking after the herd, the dairy willunderprice its output and not earn enough revenue to survive as a business.  Yet, if any particularproduct is loaded with too large a share of the common costs, that product will not becompetitive in the market.
Determining how much of the common cost should be allocated to each product is not a
perfect process.  According to one practitioner, “the most to be expected is an allocation methodthat produces reasonable and equitable results.”
61  There are, however, a few common methods
used.  These approaches rely on pro-rating the common costs based on the ratio of one product tothe total products produced.  This ratio may be based either on some variant of the value in themarket of the goods produced, or on the relative physical quantities (e.g., pounds of cheeseversus pounds of milk).
62  Some complex industries do not allocate the common costs at all,
simply viewing their residual earnings (revenues less output-specific costs) as “contribution tojoint/common costs and profit”.  If their residual earnings are too low, they adjust theirproduction and pricing decisions accordingly.  Each approach relies on the ability to measure themarket value and/or quantity of the goods produced.  Thus, they are of limited application to theallocation of a non-traded service such as defense.
                                                          
60 Assuming the incremental costs for the other military objectives are similar to those for oil defense ($100
million each), the stand-alone cost of oil defense would only be about $200 million per year less than the total cost ofthe Persian Gulf military presence.
61 Ben Johnson and Associates, op. cit.
62 Revenue-based approaches include the sales value at split-off [(quantity of product A x sales
price)/(market value of all products produced)]; the estimated net realizable value (same as above, with the salesprice reduced by the separable product costs after the split-off point); the constant gross-margin percentage netrealizable value (same as estimated net realizable value approach except that revenues from each product are reducedby a gross margin as well as separable costs, with the gross margin equal to that earned on all products co-produced).See Charles Horngren and George Foster, Cost Accounting: A Managerial Emphasis, 7th Edition , Englewood Cliffs,
NJ:  Prentice Hall, 1991, pp. 529-536.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-12Another common approach for recovering fixed costs is that of Ramsey pricing .  Stated
simply, a Ramsey pricing approach allocates fixed costs based on the relative strength of demandfor the products co-produced.  That is, if people really need/want the product, they end up payinga much higher share of the fixed costs.  A good example of this is the airline industry.  The fixedcosts of a business and a leisure traveler are virtually the same:  reservations system, gate agents,baggage handling, plane, crew, and fuel.  The business traveler gets a few extra perks -- primarilymore flexibility in changing tickets -- but the cost implications of these differences are quitesmall.  Yet business travelers, because they need the service more (they have to get transportationon short notice and cannot wait for later flights) end up paying three to four times as much for thesame passage.
63  Thus, the business traveler pays a much higher proportion of fixed costs than
the leisure traveler.
4.1.2.3 Allocating Persian Gulf Costs to Oil Defense
While the bounding conditions can sometimes narrow the range of uncertainty for
allocating common costs substantially, they provide little help in the allocation of common costsof oil.  If we take the oil share of the CRS assessment (despite the limitations discussed in note59) to be the absolute lower bound of the cost of defending oil (the “incremental cost”parameter), we reach a value of less than $200 million per year.  If we assume that theincremental cost of the other regional objectives is similar (assuming three primary objectives),we generate an upper bound “stand alone” condition for oil of nearly $70 billion annually.
64  That
the truth stands somewhere in the middle is hardly helpful, as the possible range is so wide.
The Ramsey pricing model is perhaps the most applicable to oil defense.  The three
primary objectives that we outlined above (preserving regional stability, ensuring access to oilsupplies, and preventing the emergence of regional hegemonic powers) appear to be interrelated.Demand for all three "products" fluctuates depending on the relative state of unrest in the region.For example, concern for the three objectives increased dramatically after Saddam Husseininvaded Kuwait.  During periods of relative stability, demand for the three objectives decreasessomewhat, but they continue to be policy drivers in the region.  Because we have no means ofjudging each objective's relative share of total demand for "defense services," we allocatecommon costs equally between them.  This allocation yields cost estimates for oil defense of$10.5 billion to $23.3 billion dollars in 1995.
65  In contrast, one prominent defense analyst
believes that nearly all of the costs should be attributed to oil, resulting in estimates three times
                                                          
63 In economics terminology, the business traveler has a more inelastic demand for travel services than the
leisure traveler.
64 The upper bound is calculated using Ravenal's 1995 estimate of $70 million.  Ravenal made an estimate
of $79 million for 1997, but we do not use this value because it includes increases in spending since the base year ofour analysis.  Earl C. Ravenal, personal communication, March 1998; Earl C. Ravenal, “The 1998 Defense Budget,”Chapter 7 in The Cato Handbook for Congress , Washington, D.C.:  The Cato Institute, 1997, obtained from
http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb105-7.html, February 20, 1998.
65 Due to the methodological problems associated with using a short-term marginal cost approach for a
service with large common costs, we exclude the CRS figure from our range.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-13higher than we report.66  Yet, even our conservative estimates demonstrate the importance of oil
defense in reducing the delivered cost of oil to the U.S., Europe, and Japan.
4.1.4    Identifying Beneficiaries of the Subsidy Within Oil Markets
There are two central issues regarding the beneficiaries from the defense of oil shipments.
The first is whether the subsidy primarily benefits oil producers or oil consumers.  This isimportant in evaluating how markets are likely to react were subsidies removed.  The secondinvolves dividing benefits between domestic versus foreign sectors, which addresses strongconcerns expressed by domestic producers that the military spending puts them at a competitivedisadvantage.
4.1.4.1 Producers versus Consumers
The benefits from Persian Gulf defense accrue to both oil consumers and producers.
Delucchi and Murphy point out that as of 1992 there were at least $4 billion in U.S. petroleuminvestments in the Middle East, and more likely closer to $17 billion.
67  They estimate that,
because of this large investment, benefits to U.S. producers are worth between 50 and 100percent of those to U.S. oil consumers.
68  Others feel this value probably overstates benefits to
producers.69  Despite the uncertainty regarding which sector benefits most, it is apparent that
both oil producers and consumers benefit in a substantial way from the military presence.
4.1.4.2 Domestic versus Foreign
Analysts have taken two main approaches to weighing the domestic versus foreign
benefits of our Persian Gulf defense activity.  Some have argued that the military’s centralinterest in oil security is to protect domestic consumers from oil price shocks.  Given the interestin insulating domestic markets, some have argued that the entire cost of the military defenseshould be allocated to domestic oil consumption.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-14Other analysts point out that the price stability provided by the U.S. presence benefits oil
consumers throughout the world, not just domestic markets.  In reality, price stability even forforeign producers provides some indirect benefits to the U.S., since in an international tradingarena the U.S. could still suffer from price shocks affecting our key trading partners.  Oursummary metrics in Chapter 7 incorporate both perspectives.
4.1.5    Persian Gulf Defense Results and Summary
We estimate that defending Middle East oil costs U.S. taxpayers between $10.5 and $23.3
billion annually.  While these estimates are higher than reported by the Department of Defense,which uses a faulty short-term marginal cost approach, they are lower than estimates made byindependent analysts.
Beneficiaries of the oil defense subsidy include both domestic and foreign oil producers
and consumers.  The Persian Gulf defense costs are quite large, representing the single largestsubsidy to the oil fuel cycle in our analysis.  This spending helps to stabilize world oil prices, andshould therefore be seen as purchasing a benefit:  protection from major price swings inpetroleum and security for key petroleum investments in the region.  Because this benefit is beingpurchased by the taxpayer rather than by oil producers and consumers, important price signals toconserve oil and shift to other energy sources are being lost.  U.S. policy should recover defensecosts in the same way they recover other common costs such as dam construction: through userfees.  Only then would the price of oil from the Persian Gulf begin to reflect more fully theresources now expended to make it available to consumers throughout the world.
4.2 ALASKA DEFENSE
Alaska is another region that has vulnerable oil supplies and may benefit from a military
presence.  As with the Persian Gulf, the military accomplishes multiple objectives with a corepresence in Alaska, and budget data are not available to analyze in detail which costs are properlyattributed to oil.  The Alaska presence also differs somewhat from the Persian Gulf since theregion is under domestic control and supply disruptions may be less likely.
Alaska accounts for nearly 25 percent of total crude oil production in the United States,
and most of that oil travels approximately 800 miles from the North Slope, via the Trans-AlaskaPipeline System (TAPS), to a tanker terminal at the Port of Valdez on Prince William Sound.The quantity of North Slope production and the importance of oil to the United States economymake the Alaskan oil supply a key strategic asset and an obvious target for enemies of the U.S.Yet, securing the full length of the Alaskan pipeline is an enormous challenge, if notimpossible.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-15Officially, Alyeska, the company that operates TAPS, is responsible for the pipeline’s
security.  Alyeska maintains its own security force, which performs a combination of live visualsurveillance and video and aerial surveillance.  Although federal and state agencies are notdirectly responsible for daily security measures, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Departmentof Defense, Alaska National Guard, and Alaska State Troopers serve as reactionary elements thatwould respond to security incidents that are beyond Alyeska’s capabilities.  The FederalEmergency Management Agency would be involved in the event of a natural disaster.
The military representatives that we contacted in Alaska stressed that the security of
TAPS is the sole responsibility of Alyeska, and that the U.S. military does not engage in securityoperations.
71  One representative from Elmendorf Air Force Base’s Public Affairs Office flatly
denied that ensuring the security of the oil supply is among the military’s objectives in Alaska,suggesting that none of the common costs of the Alaska defense presence should be allocated tooil.
72
Historically, Alaska was considered a front line of defense during the Cold War due to its
proximity to the former Soviet Union.  As such, military personnel in Alaska noted that it wasthe focus of many Cold War defense operations.  Today, the state is a useful base for operationsnot only in the former Soviet Union, but in Asia as well.  Defense personnel there also pointedout that the military has a strong interest in the region simply because Alaska is U.S. territory andhome to U.S. citizens.
73  Yet, our research indicates that Alaska’s role as a large oil producer
receives consideration from the government and defense community, and that the federal (andperhaps also the state) government does incur costs related to the defense of Alaskan oilshipments.
Unlike the Persian Gulf situation, federal and state agencies do not appear to be directly
involved in the daily security of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.  Furthermore, the Department ofDefense does not explicitly allocate its spending and activities in Alaska among differingobjectives such as defense of natural resources, United States citizens, and United States borders.However, our research found the following examples of federal involvement in Alaskan oilsecurity:

assisting Alyeska security in the event of a hostile action.  Likewise, theFederal Bureau of Investigation maintains plans for responding to terroristactivities involving the pipeline.
74
• The Defense Investigative Service of the Department of Defense performs
vulnerability assessments of industrial facilities that are consideredessential to the nation’s defense.  Once its assessments are completed, theDepartment of Defense develops plans to defend the individual facilities.As of six years ago, the Department of Defense had nominated severalTAPS facilities for “key asset” designation.

Service personnel were unwilling to confirm whether these facilities hadultimately been designated.

• The Department of Defense’s Alaska Command conducted training
exercises in 1985, 1987, and possibly in other years under OperationBrimfrost for the Alaska pipeline’s defense.
77  Operation Brimfrost was
replaced by Operation Northern Edge in 1993.  Although the AlaskaCommand has not conducted pipeline defense exercises under NorthernEdge, it initiated harbor defense exercises in 1995.  Valdez, the transferpoint for oil from the pipeline to tankers, is one of the ports that has beenused for these harbor defense exercises.
78
While some of these activities may have involved oil-related infrastructure simply
because they provided a useful stage for training missions, others are clearly baseline supportrelated to oil security.  Unfortunately, much of the data needed to assess the spending on oil-related activities is unavailable.  As a result, we were not able to prepare a quantitative estimate.

4-174.3 STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE
Many sectors of the U.S. economy are dependent on oil, and much of this oil is imported.
An absence of alternative fuels makes the nation’s economy vulnerable to rapid changes in theprice and availability of crude.  As noted by DOE’s Deputy Secretary, “Disruptions in global oilmarkets and energy price shocks have been followed by recessions three times in the past 25years.”

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was initiated in 1975 with the stated mission of
protecting the United States from oil supply shocks that could potentially result from political,military, or natural causes.  As of 1995, the existing storage capacity within the StrategicPetroleum Reserve was 680 million barrels, with a drawdown capacity (i.e., rate at which oil canbe removed) of 3.9 million barrels per day.
80  By protecting consumers and refiners from oil
market disruptions, SPR reduces both the need for private sector entities to establish their owninventories and the incentives for oil consumers to increase their ability to shift fuels in times ofoil shortages.
4.3.1    Estimating the Annual Subsidy to SPR
The cost of SPR is commonly depicted in government publications as comprising the cost
of building and maintaining the storage facilities, operating the facilities on a day-to-day basis,and purchasing oil.  While all of these items are important cost elements, they present only asmall part of the real cost of SPR to taxpayers.
As shown in Exhibit 4-3, we estimate the cost of providing SPR between $1.6 and $5.4
billion for 1995.  These estimates are based on two different approaches.  The first is anannualized cost approach that assumes SPR can write off its unpaid interest each year instead ofaccumulating greater debt.  Depending on the interest rate used, this approach yields estimates of$1.6 billion to $2.2 billion for 1995.  The largest single component of these costs is the imputedinterest charges on the more than $16 billion spent to purchase oil since 1976.  The secondlargest cost item is the financing cost on funds invested to build and maintain the capitalinfrastructure.  Neither of these cost elements are accounted for in the government’s financialreports.

4-19The second approach recognizes that the Treasury must pay interest each year on SPR’s
debt, and that it must issue new debt to pay that interest.  Thus, SPR’s effective cost to taxpayersincludes compounding of interest (i.e., interest accruing on unpaid interest).  Using this approach,we estimate the upper bound cost of SPR in 1995, $5.4 billion.  As shown in Exhibit 4-3, interestcharges account for virtually all of SPR’s cost under this approach.
In the remainder of this chapter, we explain in greater detail how we developed each of
these estimates.
4.3.2    Annualized Cost to Build and Operate the SPR
Federal accounting for SPR is done on a cash basis.  Each year, funds appropriated by
Congress are reported in one of three main SPR accounts:  storage facility development,management, and oil acquisition.  This approach is useful in assessing the cash investment withina particular year, but provides little information on the full annualized cost of SPR to taxpayers.To estimate this annualized cost, we have adjusted many of the data elements provided in SPR’sAnnual Report and developed estimates for data not provided.  Each element of our analysis isdescribed below.  This analysis results in SPR subsidy estimates between $1.6 and $2.3 billion in1995.
4.3.2.1 Storage Facility Development
SPR’s Storage Facility Development account is used to purchase physical capital lasting
for multiple years.  The account includes both capital and operating costs, though these have notbeen broken out in SPR’s financial statements.  Based on conversations with reserve staff, weestimate that at least 30 percent of the costs incurred were for operations.  For the 70 percent thatwere capital costs, we use the standard methods of accounting to spread the costs of capitalpurchases over time based on the annual depreciation (or wearing out) of the capital assets
81.
Our low estimate assumes assets last 35 years, while our high estimate assumes assets last only25 years, and thus have a higher annual depreciation charge
82.
                                                          
81 Marycarol Shannahan, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, personal communication, April 27, 1998.  The
capital share was close to 100 percent of costs in 1976, dropping to ro ughly 30 percent in 1991 prior to the
beginning of renovations.  After 2000, the capital share is expected to be less than 10 percent of the facility account.
82 The appropriate asset life of SPR appears closer to the short end of this range.  Construction on SPR
began in 1976; in 1991, only 15 years later, major renovations began to repair and upgrade the Reserve.  Work is
expected to be completed in 2000 , and these investments are anticipated to last until 2025.  Shannahan, personnel
communication.

4-204.3.2.2 Oil Acquisition
The largest cost item in any single year is the purchase of crude oil for the reserve and its
transportation to SPR sites.  Our assumption is that this oil will eventually be sold.  Thus, we donot count the funds spent on oil as a subsidy.  Rather, when sales have occurred, we compare thesale price to the purchase price of the oil to estimate the nominal gain or loss on that sale.
4.3.2.3 Imputed Interest
In the private sector, unless a company’s investments can grow at least as fast as the
interest rate over the long-term, a private enterprise will lose money and go out of business.
83
Thus, oil held in an inventory must grow in value at the rate of interest -- or must protect such arate of growth in other parts of the company that would otherwise be harmed if oil were notcontinuously available.
Many discussions of the cost of SPR focus only on annual appropriations for oil
purchases and facility construction and maintenance, implicitly treating the governmentinvestment as “free” money.  However, with the United States running a budget deficit during theentire duration of SPR’s existence, the government has had to issue additional debt in the form ofTreasury bonds to develop and operate SPR, and it must pay interest on that debt.  These are realcosts to U.S. taxpayers that are directly attributable to SPR; however the government omits themfrom SPR’s reported costs.
We estimate these interest costs in two ways.  First, we use the government’s long-term
Treasury bond interest rate (since SPR is a long-term investment).  This estimates SPR’s hiddencost to the taxpayer.  Second, we calculate the cost of the capital if SPR were owned andoperated by the private sector instead of a service provided by the government.  For thiscalculation, we use the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the largest oil refiningcompanies because low cost government debt would not be available.
84  This second approach
estimates not only the hidden interest costs of SPR, but the benefit to oil markets of having thisservice publicly provided.
                                                          
83 Firms can, and do, survive for short periods of time without fully recovering their fixed costs of
operations.
84 We use a 5-year rolling average rate from the 30-year Treasury bond to reflect the ability to refinance
debt in a market with falling interest rates.  A 5-year average is used because debt can not always be refinancedimmediately, and doing so is not costless.  We were unable to calculate a 5-year rolling average for the privatefinancing cost because data were not available.  Instead, we assume all debt is held at 1995 interest rates.  Thisassumption reduces our subsidy value, since 1995 rates were lower than in the previous years.  Our use of theWACC for the largest oil refiners also reduces our estimate, since interest charges for smaller firms would have beeneven higher.

4-214.3.2.4 Miscalculating the Market:  Declines in Asset Value
Changes in the value of past investments can complicate the analysis of SPR’s annual
costs.  When a private firm determines that particular assets are now worth less than what theypaid for them (net of depreciation), they write these assets down to reflect a best estimate of theircurrent value.  These write-downs improve the accuracy of the firm’s reported financial results,but generally do not change the original financing obligations entered into in order to purchasethose assets in the first place.
85  Consider the purchase of a new automobile, for which the buyer
obtains a $15,000 loan.  The individual may ruin the car in an accident the next day, but stillmust repay the loan.
SPR has two situations where asset write-downs would be appropriate, though the
program does not appear to have explicitly done so:
• Decline in the Value of Oil Inventory.   The average acquisition cost per
barrel of oil added to SPR between 1976 and 1995 was $27.30.  Themarket price of that oil in 1995 was only $17.20 per barrel, suggesting acapital loss on oil acquisition of nearly $6 billion -- even excluding thetime-value of money  This is currently a paper loss, as theoretically theprice of oil could rise to $27 per barrel or higher prior to when it isactually sold.  We have counted only losses on actual sales in our subsidyestimates, not paper losses due to the declining market price for crude,because crude prices continue to fluctuate over a fairly wide margin.However, it may be appropriate for the SPR program to write down itsinventory more formally if price projections indicate full recovery of thepurchase price is unlikely.  If oil inventory had been depreciated each yearof the 1976 to 1995 period to reflect the decline in its market value, thereported cost of the SPR program in 1995 would have increased by about$300 million.
86
• Defunct Physical Assets.   SPR consists of five large underground storage
facilities for oil.  In 1995, one of these facilities, Weeks Island, waspermanently closed due to problems with oil leakage and the potential forenvironmental contamination.  With 9.3 percent of the SPR’s total storage
                                                          
85 Private equity investors may bear the brunt of such write-offs through reduced share values and deferred
dividend payments.  To the extent that share values fall and equity investors lose money, future borrowing costs arelikely to rise.
86 Marginal analyses of the cost of SPR, such as conducted by Mark Delucchi for the Union of Concerned
Scientists, do not evaluate these costs because they estimate the savings in SPR costs from today going forward ifmotor vehicle use were curtailed or eliminated.  Thus, the starting point for such analyses is today, instead of 1976,and all past subsidies for facility construction, oil acquisition, and accrued interest are ignored.  While appropriatefor marginal decision making, such an approach does not accurately measure the full taxpayer cost of SPR over time.See Roland Hwang, Money Down the Pipeline: Uncovering the Hidden Subsidies to the Oil Industry , Union of
Concerned Scientists, September 1995, pp. B-1 to B-3.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-22capacity, the implied capital write-off is at least $237 million.87  Increasing
past annual depreciation deductions so that Weeks Island would be worthzero in 1995 would add about $12 million per year to our subsidy estimate.
4.3.2.5 Return on Investment
The U.S. government is a non-profit entity, and therefore does not seek a return on its
investment in SPR.  This investment, totaling nearly $20 billion with no expected payback fordecades, entails substantial financial risks.  If SPR were privately owned and operated, privateinvestors would require compensation in the form of a return on their investment for taking onthose risks.  The fact that SPR is provided by the government rather than the private sectorincreases the value of the subsidy enjoyed by oil consumers.  We have not estimated theseadditional savings to oil consumers in our analysis.
4.3.3    Cost of SPR Including Compounding of Interest
Interest payments were the largest components in the estimate of SPR’s annual cost of
operations shown above.  Implicit in the calculations was the write-off of each year’s interest bill.In reality, this is not what happens.  When individuals take out a loan from a bank to buy a$15,000 car at 10 percent interest, they must pay 10 cents per year in interest for every dollarborrowed, or roughly $1,500.
88  If they fail to pay the interest in the first year, it is capitalized
(i.e., added to the original amount borrowed), increasing the total debt to $16,500.  Thus, in thesecond year of operations they would owe the bank not only interest on the original $15,000, butinterest on the $1,500 in unpaid interest from the previous year.  The process of paying (orearning) interest on accrued interest is called compounding.
It is worth considering compounding when assessing the cost of SPR.  Given the
government’s fiscal deficits throughout SPR’s life, the Treasury had to issue debt to provideSPR’s funding, and it had to pay interest on that debt.  To pay the interest, the Treasury wouldhave needed either to receive compensation for its investment or to issue more debt, effectivelyrequiring it to pay interest on accrued interest.  As the purpose of issuing the debt in the firstplace was to fund SPR, this compounding of interest would be directly attributable to SPR aswell.
                                                          
87 This amount is equal to 9.3 percent of our low estimate for the remaining undepreciated capital in 1995.
In fact, facility development costs are unlikely to be linearly related to the storage capacity.  Rather, costs per barrelare likely to be lower for larger facilities.  This suggests that the appropriate Weeks Island write-off would be higherthan its share of total storage capacity.
88 The exact amount will depend on the number of times per year interest is calculated, and the number of
times per year payments are made on the debt, both of which affect the annual interest charge.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-23If the Treasury fully accounted for SPR’s costs, it would have treated investments in SPR
as formal debt obligations between the program and the Treasury, and charged SPR interest tocover the actual costs incurred by the Treasury for its debt.  Thus, interest would have beencalculated at the Treasury’s cost of long-term borrowing (since SPR requires long-term funds),measured by the average 30-year Treasury Bond rate.  To pay the interest and principal on theoriginal investment, SPR would have collected a “price-shock insurance premium” in the form ofa user fee from oil consumers.  If the program did not repay the interest on its debt, the unpaidinterest would have been added to its overall debt burden, and the program would have begun topay interest on both the original debt and the accumulated unpaid interest.  Thus, if the Treasuryfully accounted for its investment in SPR, its costs would include compounding of unpaidinterest.
SPR has paid off none of its principal and none of its accrued interest since its inception.
The few oil sales it has implemented have been at prices below its average oil acquisition cost,yielding capital losses.  The billions of dollars tied up in SPR for as long as 20 years, withinterest compounded on unpaid interest from earlier periods, provides a proxy for the total publiccost of SPR if treated as a formal enterprise during its lifetime through 1995.
We used this approach to provide an alternative estimate to the annualized cost method
described above.  It mirrors the financial flows that the federal government actually incurred.Funds put into SPR required the issuance of Treasury Bonds, on which taxpayers paid debt.Interest not paid throughout this period required the issuance of still more debt.  Exhibit 4-4illustrates the impact of the compounding process, and shows that the interest cost alone on theaccrued debt was more than $5.2 billion in 1995, far higher than our high annualized costestimate of $2.3 billion.  As principal and accrued interest increase over time, the growth ininterest charges accelerates.  Thus, the incremental addition to debt in 1995 greatly exceeds thatduring 1979 ($360 million), when the total unpaid balance was much smaller.
As is also shown in Exhibit 4-4, SPR’s total debt from direct investment and
compounded interest on unpaid debt was $74.7 billion in 1995.  In comparison, the value ofSPR’s tangible assets in that year was only $10.2 billion in oil inventory (valued at the 1995market price) and capital assets with a book value of about $1.9 billion.

89 Although the book value of capital assets may not be an accurate representation of the market value of the
assets in question, we had no data with which to assess the market value.  Depending on the value of alternative usesof the storage capacity, the book value may be more or less than the actual market value of the assets.

Notes:
(1) New investment includes all funding to SPR in a given year, including capital, oil purchases, and management costs.  Within an enterprise,
all of these elements must be financed either through revenues, debt, or equity.  Interest calculations assume investment funds  are 
provided in twelve equal installments.
(2) We use a five year rolling average of 30-year Treasury bond rates to calculate the interest accrual on outstanding
debt.  This allows for debt refinancing in the case of falling interest rates (which we assume to be costless).The effective annual rate assumes monthly compounding.  Were debt instead held to term at the initial interest rates,total program costs through 1995 would have been approximately $12 billion higher.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-25The value of oil inventory shown above fluctuates with market prices.  Because SPR sales
tend to occur at times of price shocks (when prices rise), the non-crisis price of oil may not be thebest indicator of the Reserve’s value.  Our calculation ascribes a 50 percent price premium toadjust for this factor.
90  With this premium, the value of the oil inventory rises to $15.3 billion,
and the value of the assets plus inventory reaches $17.2 billion.
Based on SPR’s estimated debt and assets in 1995 ($74.7 billion and $17.2 billion
respectively), the government’s investment yielded a loss of $57.5 billion from the program’sinception through 1995.  This “loss” can be viewed as a proxy for the full cost to U.S. taxpayersof SPR’s protection against economically damaging price spikes.  As shown in Exhibit 4-3 theExhibit 4-4:  SPR Subsidy with compounding incremental cost in 1995 was $5.4 billion.  As withthe annualized cost approach, this estimate does not include declines in asset values, capitalwrite-offs, or the incremental benefits to consumers of having SPR provided by a non-profitentity.
4.3.4
    Strategic Petroleum Reserve Results and Summary
Maintaining a large supply of oil is far more expensive than SPR’s annual reports imply.
We estimate a range value for this cost of $1.6 to $5.4 billion per year, excluding unrecognizeddeclines in asset and inventory values.  The large subsidy value is due to the billions of dollars incapital that are invested in an enterprise, but do not produce income for long periods of time.
Our analysis does not attempt to answer the question of whether this program is a good or
a bad investment.  Even at $5.4 billion per year,  SPR may be a cost-effective way for the countryto protect against the many undesirable economic impacts of oil supply disruptions.  Shifting fullresponsibility for this function to private firms may not be a feasible alternative.  Because manybenefits of price stability accrue to oil consumers rather than producers, it is unlikely thatindividual producers would voluntarily establish adequate oil stockpiles to provide the level ofprotection now provided by SPR.  Thus, it is possible that SPR can only exist as a governmentservice.  Nevertheless, the full cost of providing this service, including financing costs, should beborne by oil consumers, rather than the general taxpayer.
91  As with the defense costs described
earlier in this chapter, charging the costs directly to oil consumers will contribute to moreaccurate price signals that promote increased conservation and a shift to alternatives.
                                                          
90 While severe supply disruptions could drive up the market price of oil by more than 50 percent, the
limited drawdown capacity of the reserves (3.9 million barrels per day) means that it would take four to six monthsto fully put SPR oil on the market.  This would reduce the Reserve’s ability to capitalize on the largest prices spikes,which do not tend to last that long.  In addition, since the purpose of the reserve is to reduce the price spike, sales arelikely to be aimed more at reestablishing price stability than maximizing sale revenues.
91 DOE notes that the “United States is unique among oil stockpiling countries in assigning all of the cost of
the Reserve to the general taxpayer.  Most other stockpiling countries partially shift the cost burden to the oilindustry by requiring that their oil companies maintain inventories in excess of working needs.”  U.S. Department ofEnergy, Office of Strategic Petroleum Reserve, “Opportunity for Public Comment on Strategic Petroleum ReservePolicy,” Federal Register , April 24, 1997, obtained from http://www.fe.doe.gov/spr/sprfedrg.html on March 5, 1998.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
4-264.4 SUMMARY
Disruptions in the supply of oil and increases in oil's price can have enormous deleterious
impacts on both the U.S. and global economies.  As DOE's Deputy Secretary pointed out, priceshocks and supply disruptions have been followed by recessions three times in the past 25years.
92  To protect the U.S. economy, the Department of Defense spends billions of dollars each
year to ensure a stable flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, and the Department of Energy spendsbillions more to maintain a stockpile of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  We estimate thatthese measures cost $12 billion to $29 billion in 1995.  Because these costs are borne by thegeneral taxpayer, they are not reflected in the price of oil, preventing energy markets fromfunctioning properly.  Oil supply security is by far the largest area of subsidies to oil.  Unless thecosts of this security are borne directly by oil producers and consumers through additional userfees on oil, large distortions in energy markets and uninformed decision-making will continue.

5-1SHIFTING ACCIDENT, CLOSURE AND/OR
POST-CLOSURE LIABILITIES TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR CHAPTER 5
The environmental and human health risks associated with different forms of energy vary
in nature and magnitude.  To address the risks posed by oil, production and transportation sitesrequire decommissioning and cleanup once they are taken out of service.  A substantial effort isalso necessary to safeguard against accidental releases, such as oil spills, and to remediatecontamination from spills that do occur.  Both the procedures to manage risks and the costs ofcontamination impose financial liabilities.  To the extent that these liabilities are absorbed by thegeneral public, and not oil firms, they constitute subsidies to oil. These subsidies hide importantinformation about the costs of oil and put cleaner forms of energy at a competitive disadvantage.Only by requiring oil companies to pay the full cost of oil-related risks can informed decisionsand fair competition occur between oil and cleaner energy sources.
This chapter examines subsidies from three areas of oil-related liability in detail:  oil well
plugging and abandonment (including both onshore and offshore wells); oil spill liability; andpipeline decommissioning.  We evaluate these liabilities to determine the extent to which theyare internalized by the oil companies, and we estimate the value of risks that are shifted to thepublic sector.
These three examples speak to a much larger issue in the natural resource subsidy arena.
Many industries commonly shift accident, closure, and post-closure liabilities to the state.Business enterprises are focused on the short-term:  putting a plant in operation, meeting payroll,and selling what they have produced.  It is often easy for oil companies to overlook the gradualbuild-up of environmental liabilities because most contamination does not affect immediateoperations.  Output is not reduced, and insurance rates do not rise, because firms generally do nothave insurance for environmental contamination.

5-2Lenders may worry that the contaminated property can no longer serve as collateral for
loans; however, many of the small operations that pose the largest risks may not receivefinancing through banks anyway.
Accident liabilities are generally more difficult to hide.  While small oil leaks may
continue undetected over time, large spills attract attention.  Nevertheless, firms may be able tosave money by purchasing lower levels of insurance coverage than necessary.  We examine theissue of oil spill liability in greater detail below.
Closure and post-closure liabilities fall into two categories.  The first involves a backlog
of contamination caused before environmental regulations were instituted or properlyfunctioning.  These liabilities represent subsidies to past oil producers rather than to present ones,though the environmental problems associated with them are very real.  The second categoryinvolves firms' present methods of controlling their closure and post-closure liabilities.  Whilewe examine both issues of liability below, we count only subsidies to current producers in oursubsidy totals.
Governments have recognized that, without action, they could well inherit the messes oil
firms leave behind.  Over the past twenty years, both the federal government and many stateshave taken increasing precautions to ensure that environmental liabilities are not ignored byoperating businesses and potentially transferred to the public.  Oil shippers must purchasecertificates of financial responsibility, guaranteeing a pre-set level of financial coverage in caseof an oil spill.  A number of state and federal taxes provide supplemental oil spill funds.  Certaintypes of processing operations are required to set aside closure and post-closure trust funds.  Oillease holders must post bonds that require a third party to pay for remediation if the lease holderitself is insolvent.  Many states also levy taxes on new oil production to finance abandoned wellplugging funds that help pay reclamation and remediation costs associated with defunct oilproduction sites.  Finally, governments can use environmental litigation to recover additionalcosts and damages resulting from improper closure and remediation.
Despite these important steps, substantial public liabilities remain with respect to properly
closing oil wells.  These arise from insufficient collections to address the backlog of abandonedwell sites, and from insufficient bonding levels to adequately protect the public sector fromhaving to use general tax revenues to address future site closure and reclamation.  The adequacyof financial coverage for oil spills is uncertain, as there are a number of court cases pending thatcould greatly affect the portion of oil spill liability borne by the general taxpayer in the event of alarge spill.  The liabilities associated with pipeline decommissioning are poorly characterized anddid not permit a subsidy estimate.
5.1 OIL WELL PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT
Oil is extracted from underground reserves by drilling from the surface into the oil
reserve.  As oil is extracted, well pressure tends to drop.  Well operators often reinject fluids ornatural gas into the ground to keep the well pressure up and the oil flowing.  A single oilextraction well may be supported by a number of reinjection wells.  All of these wells must be

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
5-3properly plugged at the conclusion of drilling activity in order to prevent migration of
hydrocarbons or contaminated brines into drinking water resources.92  In addition to requiring
plugging, offshore wells are generally supported by an offshore platform of some sort that mustbe dismantled and removed at the end of production.
From the perspective of oil well operators, dismantling offshore rigs, plugging wells, and
remediating any environmental damage caused during drilling are economic burdens requiringcash outlays at a time when the sites are no longer producing oil.  For large oil companies, thecosts are relatively insignificant.  However, many wells are sold by the large companies tosmaller operators as production and returns decline.  The responsibility for proper closure istransferred as well.  While Federal agencies will not approve a lease transfer without believingthat the new owner is financially capable of properly closing the site, our analysis of existing datasuggest that comprehensive financial assurance for these new owners is often lacking.
As noted above, federal agencies and most state governments require oil well operators to
purchase some form of bond prior to commencing drilling activity.  The bonds (or other similarfinancial assurance mechanisms) guarantee that the costs of properly closing wells will be paidup to the bond limit by a third party (such as an insurance company) if the original well operatorsare financially insolvent.  Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the financial assurance requirementsis hindered both by the large number of wells drilled before the rules took effect and by requiredlevels of assurance that are too low to cover the real cost of well closures.  When financialassurances are inadequate, the public bears the excess liability, a cost that is not reflected incurrent petroleum prices.
5.1.1    Plugging and Remediating Onshore Oil Wells
The scale of unfunded oil well closure liabilities is substantial.  The owners of many oil
wells are small and financially strapped.  Often, they have purchased wells (and their associatedclosure liability) from major oil companies as well production declined.
93  Many of these owners
are unlikely to have the financial resources to properly close their sites.
                                                          
92 There are a number of known cases of contamination from oil wells.  See U.S. General Accounting
Office, Drinking Water: Safeguards are not Preventing Contamination from Injected Oil and Gas Wastes ,
GAO/RCED-89-97, July 1989.
93 Within the State of Texas, for example, major oil companies sell wells to large independent producers
when production falls to 10 barrels per day.  The large independents, in turn, sell to “mom and pop” operators whenproduction falls to 3 barrels per day.  Thus, as revenues fall and the time for closure approaches, the financialstability of the owners actually decreases.  David Garlick, former head of the Oil and Gas Division of the TexasRailroad Commission, personal communication, March 13, 1998.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
5-4The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) estimates that 2.7 million oil
and gas wells have been drilled since state-level well regulations were instituted.94  Of this
amount, IOGCC estimates that 63,400 are abandoned with no known operator (referred to asorphan wells).  IOGCC estimates that, in the “unlikely” event that all of the orphan wells had tobe plugged and abandoned (P&A), the cost to the public sector would be $343 million, or anaverage of $5,400 per well.
95  In fact, at some point these wells will have to be plugged and
abandoned, and it is unclear who other than the public sector will do so.
The IOGCC data provided a starting point for our estimate of residual on-shore well
liabilities.  We believe IOGCC's data understate the liabilities by a large margin due to thefollowing weaknesses:
• Cost Data Incomplete.   Properly closing an oil well involves not only
plugging and abandoning it, but also assessing and remediating any on-sitecontamination.  In addition, full costing of this process for orphan wellsincludes both the payments that governments make to contractors forservices and the direct equipment and personnel costs the governmentitself incurs to run the program.  IOGCC’s estimate of $5,400 per wellrepresents a simple average of reported costs, but many states report only
the funds paid to P&A contractors.
96  The estimate misses remediation
costs and public-sector costs associated with P&A program oversight.  Forthe subset of states within the IOGCC survey that did incorporateremediation costs into their reported data, the average full cost of wellclosure was between $9,500 and $19,200.
97  These costs provide a
reasonable minimum target for bonding requirements at on-goingoperations.

94 See Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, Ad Hoc Idle Well Committee, Produce or Plug: The
Dilemma over the Nation’s Idle Oil and Gas Wells , December 1996, p. 5 (cited as “IOGCC, 1996”).
95 The cost estimate for plugging a well represents the average spending per well by state funds developed
to plug abandoned wells.  (IOGCC, 1996, 43).  Data reported by the states are somewhat inconsistent, and many donot include costs of site assessments, site remediation, or the public sector’s full personnel and equipment costs foroverseeing these programs.
96 This discrepancy is exemplified by the State of Texas.  While IOGCC’s data for Texas show average well
closure costs of only $4,300, further evaluation found that this figure includes only the funds paid to vendors forP&A services.  Rough estimates for other related costs for any well requiring remediation suggest a fully costedaverage of over $14,000 per well.

report, October 21, 1997.

federal property to $20,000 per well.  U.S. Bureau of Land Management, March 1995, p. ES-1.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
5-5• Well Universe Incomplete .  The focus of IOGCC’s analysis is on orphan
wells only.  Public liabilities are also affected by a host of other types ofsites.  For example, there are hundreds of thousands of “pre-regulatory”wells with no bonding drilled prior to the development of state regulations.The condition of many of these is poorly characterized, and it is likely thatsome may require additional public funding in order to address incompleteremediation or abandonment activities.  In addition, there are nearly600,000 operating or idle oil wells that appear to have bonding levelsbelow the expected cost of full well closure
99.  For each of these wells, the
public sector is acting as a de facto insurer.
Our estimate for the public liability for plugging and remediating onshore wells (shown in
Exhibit 5-1) involves a number of steps.  First, we estimate a more realistic average value for thefull cost of oil well closure; this value sets the floor for appropriate bonding levels.  Second, weadjust IOGCC figures for the number of wells requiring or receiving public subsidy to includeboth a small fraction of the pre-regulatory wells and idle and operating wells with inadequatebonding.  Third, we develop a weighted average value for current bond coverage, which allowsus to calculate how much higher existing bonding coverage needs to be to reach the average fullcost of closure.  Finally, we calculate the cost of purchasing this additional coverage in the suretymarket.
Throughout our analysis, we have pro-rated all IOGCC data on oil and gas wells to reflect
the oil subsector only.  In addition, we have separated inadequate collections to close pastabandoned sites from the annual subsidy that results from unrealistically low bonding levelstoday.  The values shown for residual liabilities on past operations have already been creditedwith user fees levied in many states on oil producers for well plugging and abandonment(“plugging funds”).
100  Although we report liabilities for past operations, we do not count them in
our subsidy totals because they represent a past benefit to producers.
Our estimates for under-bonding for existing onshore wells are likely to be too low for a
number of reasons.  First, we calculate existing bonding levels using the state bondingrequirements for the deepest wells.  Shallower wells will have lower bonding requirements, inwhich case we have overstated their current bonding levels.  Second, we use a premium rate foron-shore bonds that is lower than the actual losses incurred on on-shore policies during the 1989to 1993 period for which we have data.  To remain viable, surety companies must collect enoughin premiums to cover losses and earn a profit, which suggests they charge bonding rates higherthan the 5.5 percent premium we have assumed for the average firm.  Third, we use average
liabilities as our target for an appropriate bonding level when, in fact, surety requirements
                                                          
99 David Garlick notes that many of these operators may be too financially weak to obtain or pay for
bonding even if they wanted to.  Garlick, personal communication, March 13, 1996.
100 The contribution of these funds appears inadequate to fully address the total well liability.  Only 13,000
wells had been plugged since the start of the funds through the end of 1994, a period of 10 to as many as 40 years
depending on the state.  Meanwhile, IOGCC estimates the known plugging backlog at nearly 38, 000 wells.  (IOGCC,
1996, p. 43).

Notes:
(1) Data on oil and gas wells have been pro-rated to oil based on the ratio of historic oil versus gas plugging activity.(2) IOGCC estimates for average plugging and abandonment costs do not include remediation for many states.  Values shown in this  table represent an average 
high and an average low P&A plus remediation costs for the states within the IOGCC survey that were identified by the study's c oordinator as including 
all necessary cost elements.
(3) The well count has been scaled to eliminate double-counting of an estimated 10 percent of wells under federal jurisdiction t hat are also under state oversight.
(4) The plugging fund offset was calculated using the average annual spending on well plugging and abandonment by state funds ba sed on data in the IOGCC survey.
(5) Bonding levels vary across states.  Using IOGCC survey data, we calculated the weighted average bonding level for oil produc ing states.  The level shown 
represents an upper bound for two reasons.  First, it assumes the highest bonding level, though in reality this level applies o nly to the deepest wells.  Second,
many operators will have a blanket bond, translating to a much lower level of coverage per well than is assumed here.
(6) Bonding rates vary by state and producer, with a range of between 1 and 10 percent according to BLM's 
Bonding/Unfunded Liability Review.  We have used 
a simple average in our estimates, which probably understates the average premium cost.  Actual national statistical data on on shore bonding losses between 
1989 and 1993 shows a loss ratio of 10 percent.  Long-term premiums must at least equal loss ratios plus a minimum profit margi n if the industry is to remain 
viable.  See Surety Association of America.
(7) We count only the bonding shortfall on current operations in our subsidy total figures, as our goal is to measure subsidies to existing operations.  
For industry to cover remediation and plugging costs at past sites as well, user fees would need to rise an additional $50 to $ 100 million per year.

5-7normally aim to protect against above average losses.101  Nonetheless, we estimate a shortfall in
onshore bonding coverage for the current well portfolio of between $2.1 and $8.2 billion peryear, which would require an additional $120 to $450 million per year in bonding premiums.
The wide difference between our high and low estimates is driven by the range we use for
the total cost of well closure.  By including this bonding shortfall in our calculation of federalsubsidies, we are making the implicit assumption that the federal government is the insurer oflast resort.
5.1.2    Closure of Offshore Oil Platforms
As noted above, the problem with oil platforms is similar to that of onshore wells:
operators may not have the funds or the desire to incur substantial costs to properly shut downoperations at the end of a facility’s operating life.  As with many onshore wells, this potentialproblem is exacerbated by the steady transfer of offshore leases from major oil companies toindependents as production declines.
102
As with onshore wells, possible public liability remains despite bonding requirements for
offshore operators.  The General Accounting Office conducted a detailed study in 1993examining offshore drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.  These operations are overseen bythe Minerals Management Service (MMS), the federal agency responsible for the OuterContinental Shelf (OCS) drilling program.  GAO’s estimates for the full cost of dismantlingplatforms and plugging wells under the OCS program ranged from $4.2 to $4.4 billion. Yet,GAO found that the surety bonds in place covered only 1.6 percent of this prospective liability.According to MMS, total offshore liability has since risen to approximately $5.5 billion, of whichapproximately $1 billion is covered by surety bonds.
 103,104  Although the coverage ratio has risen
from only 1.6 to 18 percent over the past four years, the potential public exposure tops $4.5billion.
                                                          
101 Setting bonding at the average level of losses means that the public sector will inherit liabilities in a
substantial fraction of the closures.
102 Between 1983 and 1992, the number of independent firms operating offshore leases grew from 38 to 92,
and their share of total operators grew from 61 to 77 percent.  See U.S. House of Representatives, House Committeeon Natural Resources, Democratic Staff Report, “Offshore Benefits,” in Taking from the Taxpayer: Public Subsidies
for Natural Resource Development , August 1994, obtained from http:// www.house.gov/resources/ 105cong/
democrat/subsidy.htm, October 1997.
103 Both the GAO and the MMS estimates for closure are in nominal rather than net present value terms.
Insurance premiums are based on nominal values as well.  Expectations regarding the fraction of wells likely to beabandoned in a given year are reflected in the premium rates.
104 The total liability includes $1.5 billion in borehole liability, $3.4 billion in platform removal liability,
and $650 million in site clearance costs.  Totals do not sum due to rounding.  Carrol Williams, U.S. MineralsManagement Service, personal communications, October 15 and October 28, 1997.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
5-8Discussions with the Minerals Management Service suggest that one reason the coverage
appears so low is because many of the offshore leases are held by large, multinational oilcompanies.  These firms, due to their financial strength, are able to self-insure for the risksassociated with lease abandonment.  Although they are not counted in the bonded coveragecategory, they pose virtually no risk of lease abandonment.
MMS does not adjust its bonding numbers for this factor, but we have tried to do so here.
According to MMS, the total number of active leases is a reasonable proxy for the share of totalliability held.  Statistics for the 1990-96 period show that major oil companies held 1,670 of4,862 total leases, or 34 percent.
105  Pro-rating total liabilities in the Gulf (the location of the vast
majority of offshore activity) suggests that $1.9 billion of total liability is held by the majors, andassumed to be self-insured.  Combining bonding levels with self-insurance suggests a totalcoverage of $2.9 billion and a net shortfall of nearly $2.7 billion.
Unlike the onshore wells, most of the offshore wells continue to operate.  Thus,
increasing the bonding requirements for owners that are unable to cover the full liability throughtheir financial strength can address nearly all of the public offshore exposure.  The cost ofoffshore bonding varies based on a number of factors, including the number of wells, the age ofthe drilling equipment, the reserves left underneath the well, the amount of collateral, and thefinancial strength of the owners.  The cost of coverage ranges from one to four percent of thebonded amount depending on these factors.  However, the one percent cost applies only tofinancially strong operators with full collateral for the coverage.  A two percent rate is therealistic minimum for the independents.
106  These are the firms likely to make up the bulk of the
unfunded liability in the Gulf.  Based on a premium rate of two to four percent, addressing theliability shortfall would cost existing producers $53 to $106 million per year (see Exhibit 5-2).Currently, the federal taxpayer bears this liability, and the shortfall constitutes a subsidy to oil.  Itis unclear how new bonding requirements that took effect at the end of 1997 will affect the levelof residual subsidy.
107
                                                          
105 Data on lease counts were reported by MMS based on information assembled by J.M. Dodson, Inc., an
independent firm that analyzes data on offshore leases.  According to MMS, the share owned by the major oil firmsincludes all leases with any percentage of ownership by the majors.  Joint and several liability provisions enable
MMS to recover up to 100 percent of the closure and remediation costs from any owner.  Williams, personalcommunications, October 15 and 28, 1997.

107 MMS published a final rule stipulating higher surety bond coverage on offshore leases.  It was supposed
to take effect by December 1997.  See U.S. Minerals Management Service, “Surety Bond Requirements Amended:MMS Issues Final Rule,” May 21, 1997,  obtained from http:// www.mms.gov/omm/ gomr, October 24, 1997.

5-105.2 OIL SPILLS
Oil is a globally traded commodity with millions of barrels moved every day.  Oil
pipelines sometimes leak, and shipping vessels sometimes fail due to human error, naturalevents, or age.
108  The resulting spills (almost 14,000 are reported in the U.S. each year)
contaminate the surrounding ecosystems.109  While accidents are unlikely to be eliminated
entirely, governments can at least ensure that the private entities profiting from the movementand sale of oil bear full liability for any spills that do occur.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), passed in the wake of the large Exxon Valdez spill,
establishes the primary federal requirements for oil spill-related financial assurance and liability.OPA clarified responsible parties’ liability, making them directly liable for oil spill cleanups anddamages to natural resources.  Strict liability limits for tanker vessels were increased to eighttimes the previous requirements, and tankers operating in U.S. waters were required to purchasea Certificate of Financial Responsibility (COFR), demonstrating their ability to pay potentialspill-related costs.  While the law clarified issues of liability, it also placed limits on that liability,raising the possibility that liability caps might be too low to cover reasonably expected costs of aspill.
OPA established a two-tiered system of financial responsibility for spills.  The first tier
includes the COFR, with limits for any particular shipper based on the size of the ship (seeExhibit 5-3 below).  Larger vessels are required to have higher coverage because they can causelarger spills.  This coverage is strictly limited to the shipper regardless of fault; cargo owners arenot held liable for oil spills.
110  The Coast Guard’s National Pollution Funds Center administers
the Certificate of Financial Responsibility program to certify vessels that provide the necessaryfinancial assurance and to take enforcement actions against violators.
                                                          
108 An estimated 85 percent of all tanker accidents resulting in oil spills are due to human error.  See Odd

COFR premiums have cost private shipping interests approximately $70 million
annually.111  However, this first tier coverage restricts their liability to a maximum of $296
million on any single spill.112  A vessel the size of the Exxon Valdez would have a vessel liability
limit of only $142 million on any single spill, far less than the billions of dollars of costs causedby a spill of the Valdez magnitude.
113
The second tier of coverage is in the form of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF).

5-12consolidating several related precursor funds and instituting a temporary five cents per barrel tax
on oil produced in or imported to the United States.114  The tax was suspended in 1993 once the
fund reached its statutory limit of one billion dollars.
The fund may be used for a host of spill-related purposes, including removal,
remediation, damage assessments, administration of OPA and the fund, oil spill research anddevelopment, and payments of residual damages not recovered from responsible parties. OPAstipulates that expenditures from the fund are limited to one billion dollars for any one incident,with a cap of $500 million on damage assessments and claims.  While the fund clearly providesintra-industry cross-subsidies (i.e., the costs of a spill from one transporter in excess of itsliability are borne by taxes collected from other parties), it does provide a mechanism forensuring that the second tier of coverage is provided by the oil industry as a whole rather than bythe taxpayer.
The key question from our perspective is whether the combined liability limits for both
tiers are sufficient to cover the costs associated with spills.  If not, the public sector may bearsignificant residual risks.  The answer to this question depends on the likelihood that a spill willexceed the cap and whether the cap will actually be enforced.
5.2.1    Likelihood of a Spill Exceeding OPA Liability Caps
In addition to financial assurance provisions, OPA included the following elements that
have helped to reduce the likelihood and severity of spills.
• Increased Penalties.   OPA substantially increased administrative, civil,
and criminal penalties for oil spills.115
• Improved Tankers.   OPA requires new vessels carrying oil in U.S. waters
to have double hulls by 2015.116
 
 
                                                          
114 Congress created OSLTF in 1986, but did not provide the authorization necessary for it to collect or use
funds.  OSLTF was inactive until Congress granted the necessary authorization following the Exxon Valdez spill.U.S. Coast Guard, National Pollution Funds Center, National Pollution Funds Center 1996 Annual Report , p. 13.
115 Administrative penalties can reach $125,000.  The mandatory civil penalty was increased from $5,000
per offense to $25,000 per day and up to $1,000 per barrel of oil disposed.  Criminal penalties reach as high as$25,000 per day of violation and/or imprisonment for up to a year.  Knowingly discharging oil has penalties of up to$50,000 per day of violation and 3 years imprisonment.  (Sankovitch et al., p. 59).
116 Implementation issues such as the strength of the hull, the space between the hulls, and the allowed
single hulling of areas carrying fuel for the ship have reduced the actual protection provided.  Sankovitch et al., pp.15-17.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
5-13• Improved Cleanup Response.   Oil shippers must contract for oil spill
cleanup equipment to be positioned and readied at various points aroundthe country, with requirements stipulated in terms of the size of spill thatcan be addressed in a first, second, and third wave response.
While all of these factors help to reduce the likelihood of spills exceeding the available
liability coverage, it does not eliminate the possibility.  The Exxon Valdez spill cost $2 billion toclean up, with an additional damage award of billions more.
117  While the costs of an oil spill
vary widely, even a much smaller spill than the Valdez could exhaust both the COFR coverageand the entire collection of the Oil Spill Trust Fund.
118 While OPA originally allowed the NPFC
to petition Congress for borrowing authority from the U.S. Treasury if the costs incurred for aspill exceeded the capacity of the fund, this authority expired in 1994.  Darrel Nieley, NPFC’sChief of Financial Management, was uncertain what would happen currently in such an event.
119
Some risk remains that a portion of the costs of larger spills will be borne by the taxpayer due tothe caps on both the liability coverage and the Oil Spill Trust Fund.
5.2.2    Definitiveness of Vessel Liability Caps
A second central issue affecting whether OPA confers residual liabilities to the public
sector involves the stringency to which the vessel liability limits are adhered.  One industry tradepublication noted that while OPA established liability limits, it “severely restricted the limits’applicability.”
120  Since the liability limits are not applicable to spills resulting from a violation of
a federal regulation or safety standard, industry anticipates that “most spills will breach OPA’sdefenses.”
121  Fears of unlimited liability associated with spills have led to a reduction in lease
financing of tankers and other lending for tanker purchases.122  Up to a point, a higher effective

118 Based on an analysis by Anderson and Talley, cleanup costs per ton of oil range from $1,610 to $40,880
(1995 dollars).  Environmental damage costs add an additional $1,660 to $11,610 per ton spilled (also 1995 dollars).The costs per ton for the Valdez spill appear to have exceeded the upper range value in Anderson and Talley by awide margin.  While the two tiers of liability coverage appear sufficient for most spills, larger releases of over twomillion gallons (there have been at least five since 1976) risk depleting all available funds.

5-14cap could reduce the residual liability borne by the public.  However, if concerns over unlimited
liability become too severe, insurers may pull out of the market, leaving the public with a muchlarger exposure than before.
Several spills have exceeded the responsible party’s maximum liability.  In these cases,
the government has tried to recover the full costs of the spill from the oil shipper or its insurer.For example, the federal government has incurred costs of $82 million thus far for a 1994 spillnear San Juan, Puerto Rico; however, the liability limit for the responsible vessel was only $10million.
123  NPFC has attempted to recover the full costs incurred by the government for this and
other spills, including costs in excess of the responsible vessels’ liability limits.  These cases arecurrently in litigation.  Their outcomes may affirm the limitations on financial risk set by OPA orinvalidate those limitations, at least under certain circumstances.
State oil spill regulations also play a role in the ultimate liability borne by the private
sector.  OPA allows states to implement their own liability limits.  Using this authority, 30 stateshave their own oil pollution liability laws, and as many as 19 states impose strict unlimited
liability on shippers.  In addition, although the federal government restricts liability to shippers,
some states impose liability on cargo owners and charterers as well.
124
The impact of state laws on the federal caps also remain to be determined through
litigation.  A recent court decision seemed to uphold both the priority of federal liability limitsover state, and the liability caps established by OPA.
125  If this ruling delineates a trend, large
spills, especially if caused by independents with little market visibility and less to lose fromadverse publicity following a spill, will likely be borne in part by the general taxpayer.  However,given the uncertainty associated with the various ongoing cases, we assume there is no residualpublic liability from oil spills, and estimate the subsidy to oil to be zero.

5-155.3 PIPELINE ABANDONMENT126
Due to the hazardous material they transport, crude oil pipelines are potential sources of
environmental contamination.  Current regulations specify response and reporting requirementsfor contamination events such as oil spills; however, natural resources along pipeline routes maybe contaminated from events that pre-date current regulations or from the gradual accumulationof small, unnoticed incidents.  State and federal regulatory agencies have requirements forproperly closing pipelines so that they do not pose continuing threats to the environment afterthey are abandoned.  However, it is not clear that abandonment regulations fully address possiblesite contamination or the permanent removal of the lines.
127  Nor do they address the potential
problems that may arise when operators are unable to pay for proper closure procedures.
Pipelines are regulated either by state or federal agencies.  The U.S. Department of
Transportation’s Office of Pipeline Safety has regulatory jurisdiction over interstate pipelines,and state agencies regulate pipelines that do not cross state boundaries.  Within states, pipelineregulation may fall under the responsibility of more than one agency.  For example, two separateoffices within the Texas Railroad Commission regulate pipelines in the State of Texas.  ThePipeline Safety Office has responsibility for major lines (greater than eight inches in diameter),and the Oil and Gas Office regulates pipelines less than eight inches in diameter, which aretypically gathering lines further upstream (i.e., closer to the production sites).
While cases of abandonment involving interstate and major intrastate pipelines are likely
to be less common, smaller, upstream gathering pipeline systems are more dynamic, withindividual lines closing as wells dry up and production shifts to other locations.  We called stateand federal agencies responsible for regulating oil pipelines to assess not only their pipelineabandonment requirements, but their provisions for ensuring that operators, and not taxpayers,finance closure and remediation costs.  The answer from all levels of the regulatory bureaucracywas that pipeline operators must develop and provide details about their operation andmaintenance procedures, including procedures for abandonment.  Operators’ abandonmentprocedures must address the issues of safely disconnecting, purging, and sealing pipelines.However, it was not clear whether states and the federal government require environmental siteassessments to ensure that possible contamination is identified and remediated at the time ofclosure, or whether they have guidelines governing the complete removal of defunct pipelines.
                                                          
126 Information contained in this section was gathered from telephone conversations with the following
people:  (a) Bill Dase, Pipeline Safety Office, Railroad Commission of Texas; (b) Buck Furrow, U.S. Office ofPipeline Safety; (c) Marty Mathessen, American Petroleum Institute; (d) Paul McKey, Public Affairs, Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission; and (e) John Tintera, Site Remediation Group, Railroad Commission of Texas.Conversations were held on November 6-7, 1997.
127 The Office of Pipeline Safety (Department of Transportation) does not require pipeline operators to do
site assessments and any necessary remediation at the time of abandonment; it is unclear whether some otherregulatory body makes these requirements.  Linda Do ugherty, Compliance Office, U.S. Office of Pipeline Safety,
Compliance Office, personal communication, November 10, 1997.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
5-16In the event that an operator fails to follow proper abandonment procedures, our contacts
agreed that their offices would pursue operators in court, but they were generally unclear whatwould happen if legal action failed because the operator was insolvent or defunct.  In the case ofoil spills, pipeline operators must develop and demonstrate their capability to carry out responseplans.  However, neither the federal government nor the State of Texas requires that operatorsdemonstrate their ability to pay future closure costs with financial assurances such as insuranceor bonds.  Some states, like Texas, may impose taxes on oil production to finance trust fundscapable of paying cleanup and closure costs that are shifted to the state.  It is not clear whetherthe federal government and all states have such mechanisms for shielding taxpayers frompipeline cleanup and closure liability.
Our conversations indicate that the issue of public liability associated with pipeline
abandonment is poorly characterized.  While regulatory agencies have procedural requirements,they apparently do not have specific financial provisions to ensure that any closure and cleanupcosts remain in the private sector.  The magnitude of the problem, the historical cost ofcontamination from pipelines, and the current availability of general trust funds to financeremediation at abandoned or insolvent sites are all unknown.
5.4 SUMMARY
Governments have implemented a number of new requirements over the past ten years to
reduce the likelihood that the taxpayer will have to pay for oil-related accidents or facilityclosures.  These are positive steps that should be continued in order to eliminate the remainingliability subsidies.  For example, state and federal bonding requirements for offshore wellabandonment and remediation costs should be raised to cover the remaining shortfall incoverage.  Attention should be given to ongoing litigation that may have impacts on the public'sexposure to oil spill liabilities, and the poor characterization of potential liabilities associatedwith pipeline decommissioning should also be addressed to ensure that environmental liabilitiesare being adequately internalized.

6-1COST OF ACCESS TO OIL RESOURCES CHAPTER 6
Selling public resources to oil companies below fair market value reduces producers'
production costs.  This chapter provides a broad overview of oil leasing and the manner in whichgovernments provide subsidies to producers through their leasing processes.  In most cases,individual lease decisions will have little or no impact on world oil prices.  Rather, subsidizedleases increase producers' profits at the taxpayer's expense or allow otherwise uneconomicreserves to be developed.  In the extreme, however, a major producing country can affect theglobal price of oil by allowing widespread leasing below fair market value.
128
The environmental implications of poor leasing practices can be substantial. Even without
affecting world oil prices, subsidized access to oil tends to accelerate the development ofparticular oil fields, amplifying the direct environmental impacts of production.  If the subsidizedfields happen to be in parts of the world with weak central governments and poor environmentalenforcement, leasing subsidies can also displace more responsible producers in the marketplace.In addition, to the extent that lease terms do contribute to declining prices, oil consumption riseswith all of its concomitant environmental impacts.  Finally, subsidies in one country may putpressure on competing nations to increase subsidies to their own industries in order to maintaintheir competitiveness, exacerbating the problem.
The first part of this chapter provides background on leasing.  The chapter then discusses
the cost of managing oil production on federal lands and identifies potential lease-relatedsubsidies.  Little quantitative data are available for estimating leasing subsidies.  We haveprovided estimates of specific subsidies where possible, and evaluate other potential subsidiesqualitatively.
6.1 A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF LEASING
A lease is a sale of rights held by the public to another party for exploration and
development.  Leases allow the buyer to look for oil, to hold the rights for a limited period of
                                                          
128 Market prices regularly react to changes in the supply of oil.  When Saudi Arabia cuts production, prices
often rise.  When large new oil fields come on line, prices fall.  The terms of access to large new oil regions such asKazakhstan will affect their supply costs, potentially impacting both the equilibrium price for oil and determiningwhich fields in other parts of the world become relative high cost producers.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
6-2time without producing, and to extract and sell oil.  The following are the core elements of
leases:
• Location/Size.   Oil leases carefully stipulate the location in which the
purchaser may look for oil.  Larger leases have higher probabilities (otherthings being equal) of containing oil.  However, leases that are too large(or the combination of too many small ones) are considered monopolisticby the federal government and regulated.
• Duration.   A lease is an option to look for oil in a certain place for a
certain period of time.  The owner can generally hold the lease withoutdeveloping it for up to ten years.  Once oil development has begun, thelessee typically retains the lease rights until the oil reserve is exhausted.The time cap on the period a lease can be held without producing ensuresthat valuable public resources are not held inaccessible by the lessee.
• Financial Assurance.   The development of oil leases can create liabilities
for the public sector owner in the form of environmental contamination,well plugging, and platform removal (for offshore locations).  Lesseesmust post an acceptable form of financial assurance to convince thegovernment of their ability to pay for any necessary cleanup.  As discussedin Chapter 5, these assurance requirements are not always set at anadequate level.
• Payment Terms.   There are three main components of lease pricing:
royalties, rentals and bonuses.
-Royalties.   Royalties are a percentage of the value of production that is
paid to the lease owner.  They represent risk sharing between the sellerand the buyer.  If the well does not produce, the buyer pays noroyalties.  If the price of oil rises or falls, the royalty payments adjustautomatically.  Royalty rates vary by lease area and lessor.
 
-Rentals.  Lease rentals are “holding” charges that are paid to owners
until lessees begin producing oil.  Rental payments compensate ownersfor the time their resources are not being produced, and help to preventfirms from speculatively holding too many lease tracts.  Rental ratessometimes rise as the number of years without development increases,

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
6-3and are sometimes recoverable against royalties owed once production
begins.  On federal leases, rental payments stop once production androyalties begin.
129
-Bonuses.  Where the value of an oil lease appears particularly large,
buyers may agree to make an additional cash payment to the seller forrights to a tract.  These payments are in addition to rents and royalties.Bonus payments help ensure that the seller is adequately compensatedfor especially valuable reserves.  There is some interplay betweenroyalty levels and bonus levels.  For example, lower royalties maketracts more valuable, potentially resulting in higher bonus bids.
6.1.1    Interactions Between Payment Terms
Lease value is primarily driven by three factors:  the amount of oil, the market price of
oil, and the cost of extracting it from the lease and getting it to market.  The projected grossrevenues from a particular lease are equal to the quantity of oil to be extracted multiplied by theanticipated price per barrel.  To determine the lease value, all direct costs to develop the field,extract the oil, and transport it to market must be deducted from the projected gross revenues.  Inaddition, all levies on production, including local, state, and federal taxes, and all royalty, rental,and bonus payments are figured into the equation.  Unless the residual profit is high enough,firms will not be interested in developing a lease.
This simplified overview of leasing illustrates two important points.  First, the amount a
firm will pay for a lease (generally reflected in the bonus payment since all other terms are fixedby the government) is determined by expected profits after all levies.   Thus, in a competitive
bidding market, charging a higher royalty rate may simply reduce the bid prices by anapproximately equal amount.  Second, nearly every component in the calculation of expectedprofits is uncertain.  Oil prices may decline, or the actual oil on a site may be less than expected,both reducing the value of the field.  Alternatively, extraction costs may be higher thananticipated, or government levies may change (if they have not been fixed for the life of theproperty in the original lease agreement).
To protect against uncertainties, bidders employ a number of strategies.  First, they
require a rate of return that adequately compensates them for their risks.  Second, they use aportfolio approach, using high profits on successful wells to offset losses on dry ones.  Third,they share risks whenever possible with the seller.

6-4The payment terms described above represent a mix of variable payments (royalties and
some bonuses) and fixed payments (rentals and some bonuses) that share the risk and rewardsfrom oil exploration between the lessor and the lessee (i.e., the government and privatecompanies).  However, this method of risk sharing does not always guarantee an optimaloutcome for either party.  For example, larger fixed costs increase the risks to the buyer, butreduce the variability in revenues to the government.  If a lease has less oil than anticipated, thebuyer may lose money on the well.
Lease issues also extend beyond the composition of variable and fixed costs.  Royalties
themselves can introduce distortions in oil development.  Although royalties rise and fall indollar terms, they remain a fixed percentage of the price of oil.  As a well is depleted and the costof extracting oil rises, the required royalty payments do not change.  Thus, well production maybe stopped prematurely because the cost of production plus fixed royalties is too high to allow areturn on the remaining recoverable oil.  Reducing the royalty rate, it is argued, would allow this“marginal” production to continue until additional resources are depleted.  Such reductions arecommonly implemented at both the state and federal levels.
To avoid premature well closures, another oft-suggested modification to leasing rules is
to use variable rather than fixed royalties, linking payments to profitability rather than sale price.Royalties would be set at lower percentages when profits from a particular well are low, and riseto higher than normal percentages when profits rise.
While variable royalties theoretically encourage more complete oil extraction from a
reserve, their practical use is challenging.  Although production is easy to measure, profits aremuch more difficult.  A profit-based approach allows well operators to deduct a host of expensesfrom their revenues to calculate the basis of their royalty payments.  They have tremendousopportunities to manipulate the calculation in order to reduce their royalties owed.  This problemis demonstrated in other sectors of the economy.  For example, there have been numerous legalsuits in the movie picture industry over movies with hundreds of millions of dollars in“revenues” but zero “profits.”  To avoid this problem, industries (such as fast food) generallystick to fixed royalty structures in defining payment rates between franchises and parentcompanies.
130
In the remainder of this chapter, we first discuss the cost of federal management of oil
leases.  We then apply the general leasing framework discussed above to identify potential lease-related subsidies for oil production.
                                                          
130 The general issue underlying these examples -- the ability for corporations to artificially manipulate
profit levels to reduce their financial obligations to other parties -- also plays a central role in the taxation ofinternational corporations.  Because these firms buy and sell large quantities of goods and services among theirvarious divisions, and can set the prices for these transactions, they can decide which part of their operations shouldshow the profits.  These prices are often set to minimize the firms' tax (or royalty) burden.

June 1992, and U.S. General Accounting Office, Tax Administration: Compliance Measures and Audits of Large
Corporations Need Improvement , September 1994.

6-56.2 MANAGEMENT OF OIL PRODUCTION ON FEDERAL LANDS
Selling oil from public lands requires government expenditures to run lease sales, oversee
exploration and drilling activity, ensure sites are cleaned up, and collect the proper royalties fromlessees. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) arethe agencies primarily responsible for managing and overseeing oil production on public land.Other agencies, such as the Forest Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, are involved to alesser degree.  In 1995, MMS and BLM spent approximately $92 and $48 million, respectively,to oversee oil-related activities, of which approximately $12.5 million was collected directlyfrom users.
Within the United States, these management costs are mostly paid from general tax
revenues.  However, since the federal government also collects oil royalties from the mineralsales, the management costs (net of user fees) can be viewed as the government's "overhead" tocollect the revenues from the sale of oil.  The question is whether, once these overhead costs arededucted from royalties, the public is receiving a fair return on asset sales.  Federal timber salesare instructive.  Evaluation of timber sale receipts by independent analysts suggest that thegovernment pays more to make the timber available for sale (including building access roads)than it actually receives from sales.
131
The overhead on oil sales is not as onerous as for timber, and there does appear to be a
healthy net gain from oil concessions.  Oil-related overhead costs of MMS and BLM areequivalent to about 10 percent of the $1.3 billion in oil royalties collected at the federal level in1995.
132  Even once oil oversight activities at other federal agencies are added in, we do not
anticipate the overhead rising above 20 percent of sales revenues.
6.3 KEY ARENAS FOR GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER ACCESS TO OIL
Government involvement with oil leasing includes four main spheres of control:  the
initial establishment of property rights, setting (or modifying) the terms for existing oilproduction, setting the terms for new oil production, and ensuring that access to oil resources iscompetitively determined.  Subsidies to producers can be provided in any of these areas.  Wesummarize these subsidies below, and discuss each area in greater detail in the remainder of thischapter.
                                                          
131 According to the analysis, the government lost $375 million on timber sales held in 116 national forests
in 1995.  Randall O'Toole, "Forest-by-Forest Timber Sale Accounting for 1995," Thoreau Institute, obtained fromhttp://www.teleport.com/~rot/description95.html, March 17, 1998.
132 We do not treat oil rents, royalties, and bonuses as subsidy offsets, since they represent payment to the
taxpayer for the sale of publicly owned oil assets.  Nor, however, do we treat the government cost to manage oil salesas a subsidy to oil.  This decision reflects the necessity of incurring some costs in order to earn the oil royalties in thefirst place, and the relatively low level of overhead costs in comparison to other natural resource areas, such astimber.

6-6• Establishment of Property Rights.   When and how governments choose
to establish mineral rights and rectify competing claims on land can reducethe cost of access to oil resources substantially.  Government efforts toresolve property rights disputes can be intensified when oil is at stake,with the results often favorable to oil companies.  The Alaska NativeClaims Settlement Act is one example where the presence of oil ledinduced the federal government to actively arbitrate land claims andestablish control of key oil reserves and transportation corridors.
• Subsidies to Existing Oil Production.   Governments can consciously
reduce the required payments for existing leases, providing a potentialwindfall to lease owners or encouraging continued production in the faceof worsening extraction economics.  Governments may also providesubsidies inadvertently, such as through lapses in oversight.
- Failure to Meet Existing Lease Terms .  Poor auditing practices by
Federal agencies result in the loss of royalty income, estimated at $50to $75 million per year for the Bureau of Land Management alone.  Oilcompanies also reduce their contracted royalty payments through theuse of artificial transfer prices that understate the true value of oilextracted.  This practice costs the Treasury $30 to $130 million peryear.
-Changes to Existing Terms.   Governments may modify lease terms in
the middle of a lease to encourage increased production.  Subsidiesoccur when unnecessary reductions are provided to lease holders.
• Subsidies to New Production.   Governments may provide special
incentives for new production in order to encourage new activity.  Thesesubsidies may be targeted at job creation or economic development, andcan use a host of different approaches.  Examples include royalty relief oncertain types of oil deposits, non-competitive conversion of explorationlicenses into leases, relaxation of competitive restrictions on lease size,and limited public participation and oversight on leasing decisions.
 • Below-Market Lease Sales Due to Faulty Lease Auctioning Process.
Competitive auctions potentially maximize firms' payments for oil
resources, but a lessor's failure to ensure that an auction is trulycompetitive can enable firms to pay less than the fair value of a lease.Although uncommon in the United States, many countries award oilconcessions in a non-competitive and possibly corrupt way.  When thisoccurs, purchasers realize windfall gains, and taxpayers do not receive afair return on the public assets sold.

6-76.4 ESTABLISHMENT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS
Developing oil fields, especially remote or inhospitable ones, can cost hundreds of
millions of dollars.  Without clear property rights, this development will not take place.  Inaddition, resolving property disputes can cause delays that are expensive to industries interestedin investing, and may cause them to focus their efforts elsewhere.  To minimize delays,governments can establish property rights by brute force.  Because oil companies often have anextremely large financial interest in the outcome and tend to be the more powerful partiesinvolved in property disputes, the final property rights allocations can heavily favor them.
A good example of government intervention to resolve oil-related property rights disputes
is its resolution of native land claims in Alaska.  Native Alaskans claimed much of the land in thestate, including land critical to the development of the North Slope’s oil fields.  When theproperty rights issues raised by these claims impeded oil development, the United StatesCongress intervened, resolving the dispute with a combination of its power and taxpayer money.This intervention cleared the way for oil development and likely reduced the cost of acquiring thenecessary land.
The Alaska Statehood Act of 1959 triggered property rights disputes between the state
and native Alaskans.  The Act allowed the new state to select approximately 104 million acres,over one quarter of its total territory, to be considered state land.  Although the Act barred thestate from selecting land claimed by native Alaskans, Alaskan natives claimed 337 million acres,approximately 90 percent of Alaska.
133  Their claims included what would later become important
oil fields and much of the land along the planned Trans Alaskan Pipeline System (TAPS) route.For example, the Arctic Slope Native Association claimed the entire North Slope, includingPrudhoe Bay, and several Athabascan communities had filed for a significant portion of thepipeline’s route through the Yukon Flats region.
134
The initial land selections that the state eventually submitted to the Department of the
Interior included areas claimed by native Alaskans.  Two court decisions upheld native landclaims, and the federal government froze land transfers to the state in 1966 until native claimswere settled.  This land freeze impeded development of Prudhoe Bay and construction of TAPS.Congress and the President removed that obstacle by passing and signing into law the AlaskaNative Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971, extinguishing all previous claims in return forthe transfer of money and 44 million acres of land from the federal government to native
                                                          
133 The Statehood Act of 1959 contained a section requiring the State of Alaska and its people to disclaim
all right and title to lands held by natives or held in trust for natives by the Unites States.  See Mary Clay Berry, The
Alaska Pipeline: The Politics of Oil and Native Land Claims , Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, p. 32.
134 The Arctic Slope Native Corporation held the single largest native land claim, 57 million acres.  (Berry,
p. 44)

6-8Alaskans.  The value of the cash component of ANCSA was $962.5 million (1972 dollars), of
which $500 million was earmarked from future oil royalties.135  The remainder, $462.5 million,
was to be paid over an eleven year period.
ANCSA cleared the way for oil development.  The settlement permitted the official
(although de facto) transfer of Prudhoe Bay to the state, and restrictions on native land selections
prevented natives from selecting known oil land.136  In addition, all but 20 of the 800 miles that
the pipeline crosses today are controlled by the federal or state government.  This settlementofficially granted the federal and state governments control over the North Slope’s oildevelopment, and allowed development to proceed.
Under ANCSA, the federal government appears to have used its power to underpay
claimants, reducing the cost of land acquisition.  ANCSA was a unilateral act of Congress.Native Alaskans were involved in ANCSA’s development as one lobbying group among many,including oil companies, miners, the state, and environmental groups.  Once Congress passed andPresident Nixon signed ANCSA, the settlement was final; native Alaskans were not given theopportunity to vote to accept it.  At least one community with land claims along the pipeline’sroute voted to reject its land allotment, but the vote was inconsequential.  Faced with a “take it orleave it” option, the community took what it could.  Likewise, the North Slope natives’ regionalorganization voted against approving the settlement, but, again, such a vote was powerless.
The settlement was distributed among thirteen native Alaskan corporations created by
ANCSA.  Twelve regional corporations received land and money.  A thirteenth corporationcomprising native Alaskans who had left the state received only money.  One corporation, theArctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC), received approximately $48 million and 4.5 millionacres of land in the North Slope region.  The Arctic Slope Native Association had previouslyclaimed 15 million acres in that region.  Although ANCSA allowed native corporations to selecttheir land, large areas of the North Slope were exempt from consideration by ASRC, includingthe National Petroleum Reserve, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, and land previously selected by thestate (i.e., Prudhoe Bay).
There is good reason that some of the Alaskan natives rejected the agreement.  The
payment, less than $800 million in present value terms at the time of the agreement, was equal toless than $3 per acre on which claims were withdrawn.  Using the same valuation for the landincluded in the agreement, the total value of the deal (land plus money, scaled to 1995 dollars)was approximately $2.8 billion.  This payment constitutes slightly over 12 percent of the morethan $23 billion in oil revenues (1995 dollars) that the State of Alaska collected through theinitial lease sale at Prudhoe Bay and the royalties and taxes on oil during the eleven year payment
                                                          
135 In effect, this meant that over half of the payment was to come from royalties on oil produced from land
(and mineral reserves) that the Alaskan natives believed they owned anyway.
136 The State of Alaska's initial land selections included Prudhoe Bay and other areas of the North Slope.
The Department of the Interior had tentatively approved the selections, but the federal government's 1966 land freezeprevented the official approval and transfer of the selected land to the state.  The state ignored that technicality andconducted a North Slope lease sale in 1969, prior to ANCSA, that earned $900 million, nearly as much as the entireANCSA settlement.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
6-9of ANCSA.  Once federal royalties and payments from 1983 to the present are included, the low
price paid for the settlement becomes ever more apparent.
It is clear that federal intervention accelerated the pace of oil development in Alaska, and
reduced the cost of acquiring access to Alaskan oil.  This created a windfall that flowed both togovernments (Alaska and federal) and to the oil companies themselves, though quantifying thesize of the windfall and its distribution among the various parties would be extremely difficult.
6.5 SUBSIDIES TO EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCTION
There are important differences between existing and new production that influence how
subsidies are viewed.  The central difference is that existing oil production is a fairly perishablecommodity.  Once a well has been plugged, it rarely makes economic sense to redrill it.  Thus, ifwells are plugged before the oil has been fully extracted, the oil is lost.  In contrast, newproduction does not age the same way.  Reserves can sit for hundreds of years without degrading.Owners of the oil must determine the most opportune time to extract and exhaust their finiteresources.  The implications of this difference are discussed in the context of royalty reductions.
6.5.1    Subsidies to Existing Production
Subsidies to existing production fall into two main categories: failure to meet set lease
terms and changes to existing terms.  In the first category, we examine poor royalty auditingpractices and the use of artificially low prices for oil “sold” from one division of an oil companyto another, both of which can reduce the calculated royalties owed.  In the second category, wediscuss how reductions in royalty rates and extensions to the durations of existing leases affectgovernment revenues and producer incentives.
6.5.1.1 Failure to Meet Set Lease Terms
In any business activity, lapses in oversight can lead to losses in revenue collection.
Royalty payments are no different, and poor auditing practices yield substantial financial lossesto the U.S. taxpayer.  In addition, a number of oil companies have utilized royalty-avoidancestrategies to minimize their payments to both the federal and state governments for public oilresources.  Each of these areas is discussed in turn.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
6-106.5.1.1.1          Poor Auditing Practices
The Bureau of Land Management has historically failed to enforce lease terms
aggressively.  As a result, lease holders who underpaid their royalties were rarely caught.  TheCommittee on Natural Resources of the U.S. House of Representatives estimates that this laxoversight has cost the federal government an estimated $50 to $75 million per year in lost oilroyalties.
137
6.5.1.1.2          Underpayment of Contracted Royalties
In some cases, oil producers have flexibility in how they structure their financial
reporting, which enables them to minimize their royalty payments.  The use of "posted prices,"described below, is one such example that reduced federal royalty collections by hundreds ofmillions of dollars.
Federal royalties are calculated as a percentage of the value of the oil extracted.  When oil
is sold to independent buyers, the value of the oil is readily apparent by examining the price atwhich the crude oil was sold.  For integrated oil producers, however, the calculation becomesmuch more complex because the oil is not sold on an open market.  Rather, it is often “sold”from one division of a company to another.  Historically, integrated oil companies have used“posted” prices, which are based on corporate decisions rather than the marketplace, to determinethe value of the oil sold between divisions.
Increasing evidence gathered over the past four years suggests that major oil companies
have used posted prices that systematically understate the real market value of their oil.  Thispractice extends back to 1960, and the resulting underpayment of royalties is substantial, thougha matter of fierce disagreement.
138  The Minerals Management Service estimates that the value of
royalty underpayments to the federal government from 1960 to 1992 is as much as $422 million(interest included) for California production alone.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
6-11The Project on Government Oversight, a non-partisan, non-governmental organization
which has tracked this issue for a number of years, puts the figure substantially higher:  as muchas $1.5 billion (1960 to 1997) for California production, and an additional $1.3 billion (1985 to1997) for production east of the Rockies (including offshore production).
140  Leveling the unpaid
sum plus interest over the number of years of underpayment yields an annual subsidy between$31 and $130 million.
141 This estimate represents  federal underpayments only.  The same issue
led to underpayment of state (and often private) royalties as well.  For example, the State ofTexas recently settled a suit over oil royalties that required Chevron to pay $17.5 million toaddress claims of past underpayment within the state.
142  We were unable to estimate the subsidy
to oil companies that has resulted from underpayment at the state level.
In response to its multi-year investigation, MMS has developed new regulations that use
the market exchange price of oil, rather than posted prices, as the basis for royalty calculations onoil that is not sold in arms-length transactions.
143  MMS estimates that the new method will
increase annual royalty collections by between $50 and $100 million.144  In terms of the past
underpayments, MMS has issued bills totaling only $275 million, all of which is beingchallenged in court.
145,146  This sum is considerably less than the estimated value of
underpayments for California, suggesting that substantial royalty underpayments remainoutstanding.

communication, November 11, 1997.  The MMS figure, which applies to the California region for the period 1980 to1995, includes imputed interest on the unpaid amounts.  Fazio did not believe that underpayments prior to 1980, oroutside of California, were substantial.  However, Cynthia Quarterman of MMS noted in an earlier trade press articlethat California royalty underpayments "were easier to quantify because the West Coast is a distinct market, whilecrude is moved in and out of other states more readily."  (Crow, October 28, 1996).
146 Perhaps to avoid future problems with royalty underpayment, the oil companies successfully passed a
seven-year statute of limitations on all royalty collections.  See Tom DeRocco, "President Signs Federal Oil and GasRoyalty Simplification and Fairness Act into Law," U.S. Minerals Management Service, Office of CommunicationsPress Release, August 13, 1996.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
6-126.5.1.2 Changes to the Terms of the Lease Once Property is Under Production
A second type of subsidy for existing production involves changes to the terms of the
lease after the lease has already been issued.  Royalties may be reduced or eliminated, and leaseduration extended.  In addition, lease operators may be given options to expand their activitieswithout having to bid on additional properties.  Determining whether these changes constitutesubsidies or good business practice is not always easy.
Governments often provide incentives such as royalty reductions to try to prevent
marginal wells from closing.  To continue producing oil, operators must maintain well bores andwell pressures.  Changes in market conditions can make marginal wells unprofitable, leadingoperators to end production and plug the wells, often losing any remaining oil in the ground.
147
Alternatively, production costs may rise as the resource is depleted.  To avoid this lost source ofroyalties, governments offer incentives to reduce the cost of extracting oil and maintain theprofitability of marginal wells.  This objective forms the basis for scores of incentives at the stateand federal level.
148
The problem with this policy is that royalty reductions are not always needed to avoid
premature well closures.  In fact, a survey conducted by the Independent Petroleum Associationof America suggested that the biggest concern of marginal well operators was the market pricefor their product.
149  Changes in market prices appear to be much more important in production
decisions than reductions in royalties or taxes.  Because wells can remain idle for a period ofyears without necessitating closure, incentives to restart production are not needed immediatelyto avoid losing the resource, and governments can wait to see if prices recover.  However, manymarginal well incentives become active after the wells have been idle for only 12 months.  Therisk of prematurely activating such incentives is that oil prices may rise and the incentives mayturn out to have been unnecessary.  In such an event, governments lose the discounted portion ofnormal royalties for all oil depleted while the incentives were unnecessarily in place.
Determining the appropriate time to activate incentives is quite difficult and often leads to
imperfect and sometimes inaccurate decisions by government officials.  For this reason weconsider these incentives as potential subsidies and describe two federal examples here.  Timewill tell whether active royalty relief policies were good business practices or not.
                                                          
147 Many small wells pull oil from pools that are not accessible by surrounding wells.  Furthermore, the
profitability of wells generally decreases as they are depleted.  Resuming production would require re-drilling, butthe high costs of re-drilling often outweigh the benefit from producing the remaining oil.
148 See Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, State Incentives to Maximize Oil and Gas Recovery ,
January 1997, for a good summary of state-by-state subsidies to both marginal and new wells.

6-13• Royalty Relief for Heavy Oil.  In 1996, the Bureau of Land Management
implemented a final rule reducing the royalty rate on heavy oil.  Heavy oilis less valuable than lighter grades but more expensive to produce, andmany wells were idle or were expected to become idle if oil prices fellfurther.  Royalty relief was implemented to help them remain viable.
150
BLM’s projections on the economics of the change vary considerablydepending on their assumptions regarding the price of oil.  However, thecombined effect on revenues plus other public sector income (such asseverance taxes and corporate income taxes) ranges from a present valuegain of $105 million to a present value loss of $25 million.  The presentvalue has been calculated over the producing life of properties, around 20years.
151
• Royalty Relief for Stripper Wells.   Stripper wells are low volume oil
wells producing less than 15 barrels of oil (on average) per day.  Thesewells tend to have higher unit production costs, and to be adverselyaffected by low oil prices.  To encourage continued operation of thesewells (as well as renewed operation of idle stripper wells), the Bureau ofLand Management allowed operators to obtain a royalty reductionbeginning in the latter part of 1992.  At the time, BLM projectedsomewhat reduced federal revenues and somewhat increased staterevenues over the life of the properties.  The anticipated net losses areextremely small, less than $1 million per year.
152  The rule is currently
being reevaluated for cost and effectiveness.153
6.5.2    Subsidies to New Production through Lease Terms
While existing wells must often be used or lost, new wells do not constitute “use-or-lose”
situations.  Subsidies to new production raise two central questions.  The first is whether thesubsidy is necessary for the development to take place.  This question is the same as wediscussed above regarding existing production.  The second question is whether it makes sense toencourage the production of high cost oil with public money.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
6-14Governments provide lease subsidies for two primary reasons:  energy security and
economic stability.  By encouraging marginal domestic production, the flow of imports can beoffset somewhat, at least in the short-term; however, the incremental benefit to energy security isnot likely to be large.  In the longer term, depleting marginal oil supplies means that theremaining domestic reserves will tend to be more costly to extract, reducing the future ability todevelop a domestic response if oil prices begin to rise.
The issue of economic stability is more pernicious.  As oil-producing states begin losing
oil jobs due to reserve depletion or falling world oil prices, they come under increasing pressureto protect both jobs and government revenues.  The problem is more acute if the state’s economicand state revenue bases are poorly diversified (as is the case with Alaska).  Because the economicshock of industrial decline is potentially large, the government may introduce economically-inefficient policies (“give-aways”) to maintain the jobs and revenue status quo .  The shorter the
time frame for response and economic transition, the more likely are decisions that result inshort-term economic stimulus but long-term environmental damage -- as well as dubiouseconomic benefits.
A multi-country assessment conducted by Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner of Harvard
University comparing nations' economic reliance on natural resources and their long-termeconomic growth rate illustrates this point.  On average, a 17 percentage point increase in theshare of primary resource exports in gross domestic product in 1971 corresponded to a 1percentage point fall in average annual growth over the 1971 to 1989 period.  In contrast, many
natural resource poor countries, such as Taiwan, posted strong growth during that time frame.
154
We discuss some examples of lease subsidies to new production below.
6.5.2.1 Royalty Relief for Deep Water Oil Drilling
To encourage the development of oil and gas from deeper parts of the outer continental
shelf, the federal government gave royalty relief to producers willing to drill new wells in deepwater.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated the economic impacts of the rule, whichbecame effective in November 1995.  In the first five years, the relief was expected to increase
government revenues through higher bonus bids, as firms would be willing to pay more up-front
for drilling rights knowing they would have lower royalty obligations.  Yet, relief would reducegovernment revenues from royalties by $500 million over the life of the properties.  The

6-15estimated present value loss to the Treasury (net of increased bonuses) was $150 million.155
Using the interest rate assumptions in the CBO analysis, this translates to an average annual loss
to the Treasury of roughly $12.3 million for the 1996-2020 time period of CBO’s analysis.
There is substantial evidence that royalty reductions were not needed to encourage
exploration in many deeper water locations.  New technology, such as three-dimensional imagingand horizontal drilling, have dramatically reduced the costs of finding and producing oil.Average exploration and production costs per barrel have decreased by about 60 percent in realterms over the past 10 years, and exploration costs for one major oil company have fallen by 85percent over ten years due to improvements in imaging.
156
Other advances, such as computer-controlled thrusters to stabilize offshore floating rigs,
have also brought costs down by eliminating the need for much larger, more expensiveinstallations.  Even in colder regions, where icebergs traditionally necessitated massiveinstallations, new options such as floating installations that are tugged out of the path ofoncoming icebergs dramatically reduce costs.  For example, a floating rig for Canada’s GrandBanks and a deep water rig for the U.S. Gulf Coast cost between 50 and 90 percent less than theirprecursors.  They are also faster to design and build, reducing the market risk to the investor.
157
While some deepwater reserves may still be difficult to access, either due to their location or thedecline in the market price in oil, it is clear that innovation has made drastic cost reductions inaccessing many deepwater reserves.  These cost reductions call into question the federal strategyof reducing royalties to encourage production in many of these areas.
6.5.2.2Other Lease Subsidies to New Production
The federal government and many states have a number of lease-based incentives in place
to spur new oil production.  We did not have enough information to quantify the revenue lossesassociated with each one, but their variety demonstrates the many subsidies that can exist for newproduction.
158  In order to illustrate the variety of policies in place, we have included descriptions
of some state programs, though their inclusion does not affect our federal subsidy totals.  Inaddition to these types of incentives, limited public oversight of lease decisions can make leasesubsidies more likely.

6-16• Large Block Licenses .  Oil companies are sometimes given rights to
explore large blocks of land in return for a commitment to invest a pre-specified amount in oil exploration.  If oil is found, the license to explorecan be converted into a lease at fixed terms, without further bidding.  Theprocess can encourage oil exploration in areas in which it might nototherwise occur.  However, it can also give specific oil companiesvaluable rights to large tracts of oil land without having to pay any bonus.
• Increased Tract Size.  Governments may allow particular oil companies
to hold larger than normal tract sizes in order to encourage oildevelopment.  Larger sizes increase the chance of finding oil, and enable asingle firm or investment group to control an entire oil prospect.  This canencourage more rapid oil exploration and development, but may give acompany monopolistic or near monopolistic control in a region.
• Reduction in Taxes and Royalties in Return for Increased
Development.  Governments sometimes allow a portion of the costs
associated with exploring for new oil to be offset from royalties or taxesowed to the government from other operating sites.  The state, in essence,becomes a development partner.
• Temporary Royalty Reductions for New Wells.   A number of states
encourage new well development by excusing production from royaltiesfor the first years of production.
• Royalty Reductions for New, Higher Cost Fields.   Some states offer
reduced royalties for new, “high cost” production sites.
Subsidies to new leases come not only in the form of royalty relief, larger tracts, or the
ability to convert licenses into leases at a low cost.  Perhaps the most important subsidy comes inthe form of limited public participation in leasing decisions.  Exploration licenses in Alaska givean oil company the exclusive right to explore up to 500,000 acres for a period of ten years.According to local environmental groups, there is virtually no opportunity for public commentand review of the licenses.
159  Another Alaska program, "area-wide leasing," allows the state to
open large areas in certain regions to oil and gas exploration.  Once the Alaska Department ofNatural Resources (DNR) issues a “best interest finding,” which stipulates a particular lease saleis in the best interest of the state, it can conduct lease sales in the same area for the next ten yearswithout any additional public  comment.
160  Others in the state who feel that sales in the adjacent
areas are not in the state’s best interest have little recourse to challenge DNR’s decision.

6-17Limited public participation and many of the lease incentives discussed above provide
wide discretion to public officials regarding what is a “marginal” well, what regions are highcost, and when data suggest oil reserves are valuable enough to warrant lease auctions rather thanlarge area licenses.  With discretion comes the opportunity for arbitrary and capricious decisionsand corruption.  When these provisions are combined with reduced public oversight, thelikelihood of environmentally imprudent decisions rises substantially.
6.6 COMPETITIVENESS OF LEASE AUCTIONS
The final lease-related issue we examine is the process by which lease rights are sold to
private parties.  Most federal oil leases in the United States are auctioned to the highest bidder.The process used to award leases in many other countries is not always so transparent.  If leasesare competitive, auctions should theoretically ensure that the government receives full marketvalue for its oil resources.  Where sales are corrupt (as sometimes occurs outside of the UnitedStates) or non-competitive, subsidies to the purchasers can be enormous.  To be trulycompetitive, auctions require the following components:
• Sufficient Number of Bidders.   If too few bidders are interested in a
property, those that participate will be able to offer substantially less thanthe true value of the resource.  If the auction is not well publicized, or thepotential bidders do not have access to information about the tract, fewerbidders are likely.
• Independence of Each Bidder.  If bidders are able to collude, they can
avoid paying a fair market price for the resources being auctioned.
• Bid Evaluators Not Corrupt.   Government officials award leases based
on auction results.  If they are corrupt, they can accept kick-backs in returnfor giving the leases at below-market value to a specific bidder.
6.6.1    Lease Competitiveness In the United States
Offshore leases have been auctioned since 1954, one year after the passage of the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act.  The auctions, which have generally used a bonus bid system,appear to have been fair and competitive.  Mead et al. evaluated 1,223 offshore leases between
1954 and 1969, and found that the rates of return for winning bids matched that in generalindustry.  They also found no evidence that joint bids, where multiple oil companies teamtogether to bid on a single tract, led to lower winning bids or higher returns.
161  An analysis of
OCS leasing activity between 1954 and 1977 by Saidi and Marsden also focused on how joint

6-18bids affected the price of leases.  They found that the competitiveness of the OCS lease auction
was more strongly correlated with the number of bidders than with the number of bids,supporting the hypothesis that joint bidding situations did not lead to unfair auctions.
162
Onshore leases are a different story.  The first federal legislation governing onshore leases
was in 1920.  While the law called for competitive leasing for oil if the tract lay within a knownproducing field, less than five percent of federal leases were issued on a competitive basis priorto 1988.
163  Beginning in the 1950s, access to onshore tracts on federal lands was governed less
by market value and more by deception and sometimes intimidation.
To rectify these problems, the Bureau of Land Management introduced a lease lottery.  In
return for a filing fee, the lottery allowed any applicant to file an application for each tract of landup for leasing.  The winner was chosen in a random drawing.  Valuable leases were then sold bythe winner on a secondary market, with little of the economic rent accruing to the government.
164
Problems with the lotteries ultimately led to the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing ReformAct of 1987.  The Act instituted a mixed competitive/non-competitive auctioning approach.  Alltracts would be offered competitively in an auction; those for which there was no bidding interestwould then be put into a lottery.  The goal of the approach was to ensure that the higher valuetracts were bid competitively.
165
Early analysis of the reforms suggested that they dramatically increased returns to the
federal government, with bids rising from an average of $2.39 per acre in 1988, prior to reform,to $9.96 per acre later that year, under the new auctioning system.
166  While the current onshore
leasing system appears to ensure the public sector is adequately compensated for its oil, leasingpractices prior to 1988 provided substantial subsidies.

located next to lands currently producing oil and gas, were then resold within weeks on the secondary market for$100 million.  U.S. House of Representatives, 1994.

6-196.6.2    Competitive Access to Oil: The World Market Perspective
Despite a rocky history, it appears that leasing is currently fairly competitive at the federal
level in the United States.  Yet oil is produced in a global market.  Low cost producers in othercountries increase the pressure on the United States to make concessions for oil development inorder to stay competitive.  A process known as the “race to the bottom” is in effect.  Costpressures due in part to corruption and lax health, safety, and environmental standards in other oilproducing nations influence leasing practices in oil-reliant regions of the United States.
For example, a competitive analysis of Alaska’s position as a global oil producer included
nations such as Venezuela, Indonesia, Vietnam, Angola, and China in Alaska’s list of current orpotential competitors.
167  One can hardly count on competitive leasing procedures to fairly price
oil reserves in countries such as these.  In addition to artificially cheap access to oil reserves,producers in these countries may benefit from government-built or financed transportationinfrastructure such as pipelines.  To compete, producers such as Alaska are pressured to cut theirtaxes and royalties and to allow oil companies wider latitude in where they lease.  Given thesocial and environmental costs of oil development in these other countries, the United Statesshould be careful before it tries too hard to win the oil development contest.
6.7 SUMMARY
Leasing and royalty provisions are set at both the state and federal levels and can have a
substantial impact on the timing and location of oil development.  Decisions regarding the termsof access to limited oil resources have enormous financial implications.  Mistakes can cost thepublic hundreds of millions of dollars per year in well-run countries such as the United States.Mistakes and corruption in countries with fewer government resources and poorer managementcan cheat them out of billions of dollars per year or more.
The financial implications of a poorly run leasing program require that sound systems of
accountability be established that ensure proper public oversight of decisions.  This oversight isespecially important given the environmental impacts of oil development.  Standardized methodsfor reporting the financial implications of changes to leasing terms should be developed, as isdone for tax expenditures.  Such methods would enable policy options to be more easilycompared, and decisions more easily publicized.

7-1RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS CHAPTER 7
The U.S. government provided net subsidies of between $5.2 and $11.9 billion to the oil
sector during 1995, excluding the cost of defending Persian Gulf oil supplies.  We estimatedefense of oil supplies to be worth an additional $10.5 to $23.3 billion, demonstrating themagnitude of this specific subsidy element.  Thus, our estimate for net federal subsidies to oil,including defense, is $15.7 to $35.2 billion for 1995.  Because of the sensitivity of our totals tothe defense subsidy, we present our results both with and without this item.
The large range between our high and low estimates is indicative of the uncertainty
surrounding some of the data inputs needed to estimate specific subsidies.  Factors contributingto this range include differences between the cost of subsidies to taxpayers versus their value tothe oil industry, differences between data sources, and the use of multiple methodologicalapproaches to assess certain subsidies.
This chapter begins with a summary of the largest individual subsidies to oil.  We then
summarize subsidies by the type of activity supported.  Next, we develop a number of metrics toevaluate the subsidies in a broader market context.  Finally, we present policy recommendationssuggested by our work.
7.1 LARGEST INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIES TO OIL
Exhibit 7-1 lists the fifteen largest sources of subsidy to the oil fuel cycle at the federal
level.  As shown in the exhibit, the largest non-defense subsidies are worth between $4.5 and $11billion, over 85 percent of our total non-defense estimates.  Including defense, the fifteen largestsubsidies are worth $15 to $34 billion, more than 95 percent of our totals.  The most significantof these subsidies, grouped by topic, are described below.  A complete listing of subsidyelements can be found in Appendix Exhibit A-1.
• Defense of Persian Gulf Oil Supplies.   Defense of Persian Gulf oil
shipments and infrastructure comprises two-thirds of the total highestimate, conferring a subsidy of $10.5 to $23.3 billion per year.  Therange represents the variation in analytical approaches used by defenseanalysts (described in detail in Chapter 4).

7-3• Provision of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Stockpiling oil to protect
against supply disruptions provided between $1.6 and $5.4 billion insubsidies to oil markets in 1995 (see Chapter 4).  The high estimateincludes the 1995 increment of compounded interest incurred on the manyyears of unrepaid debt.
 • Tax Breaks for Domestic Oil Exploration and Production.   Despite
reforms intended to narrow the applicability of tax breaks for oil and gas,the industry continues to benefit substantially from tax subsidies, asdescribed in Chapter 2.  Three tax breaks benefiting oil exploration andproduction (the expensing of exploration and development costs, excess ofpercentage over cost depletion, and accelerated depreciation of oil-relatedcapital) reduced oil industry tax payments by between $1.1 and $2.3billion during 1995.
 • Support for Oil-related Exports and Foreign Production.   Tax credits
for foreign royalties paid, deferrals of U.S. income taxes due formultinational oil companies, and credit subsidies through the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, providebetween $0.8 and $1.6 billion per year in subsidies for exports and foreignproduction.  These provisions are presented in detail in Chapters 2 and 3.
• Provision and Maintenance of Coastal and Inland Shipping Routes.
With a large share of the total tonnage shipped through the nation’s
waterways and ports, oil benefits disproportionately from subsidies towater infrastructure (see Chapter 3). Reforms over the past ten years haveincreased the share of infrastructure costs borne by shippers; however,substantial subsidies remain. Tax exemptions for bonds used for harborconstruction and spending by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Army Corps ofEngineers continue to provide subsidies worth $600 to $650 million peryear to oil.
 • Unfunded and Underfunded Liabilities.   Inadequate bonding and user
fees for the current stock of onshore and offshore oil operators shift $170to $550 million in liability insurance premiums from oil companies to thepublic each year.   These subsidies are described in Chapter 5.
 • Royalty Losses.   Due to creative accounting by oil producers and lapses in
auditing practices by some government agencies, the federal governmentloses at least $80 and $200 million per year in royalties (see Chapter 6).Adequate data were not available to quantify the full value of royalty-related subsidies.

7-47.2 AGGREGATE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR OIL, BY ACTIVITY SUPPORTED
Individual subsidies can be classified by the type of activity they encourage, ranging from
support to oil exploration and development to providing regulatory oversight to the oil industry.As shown in Exhibit 7-2, the security of oil supply is by far the largest activity supported by thefederal government.  Security concerns, which include the two largest individual subsidies (theStrategic Petroleum Reserve and defense of Persian Gulf oil supplies), comprise over 75 percentof our estimates if defense of Persian Gulf oil is included, and at least 30 percent of all non-defense subsidies.  Incentives for oil exploration and production, at over 35 percent of the total,are the largest category of support for non-defense subsidies in our low estimate, and secondlargest in our high.
The third largest subsidy activity is support for oil-related transportation, a category often
overlooked.  This support primarily involves maintenance of oil shipping routes andinfrastructure, and is worth as much as $775 million per year.  It is important to remember thatthis category includes only the transport of oil; subsidies to transportation systems that rely on oil(and which therefore increase the demand for oil) are not included in our analysis.
The remaining subsidy categories each comprise between one and six percent of our total
estimates.  Though small on a percentage basis, the dollar value of these categories is stillsubstantial.  For example, transfers to the public sector of liability for properly closing oil drillingoperations were worth as much as $500 million in 1995.
7.3 SUBSIDIES IN CONTEXT
In this section we evaluate our subsidy estimates in the context of the oil production and
consumption that they support.  We discuss the value of these subsidies relative to the number ofbarrels of oil consumed and consumer expenditures for that oil.  While not all subsidies affectprices, these comparisons offer a better idea of the impact subsidies have on consumptionbehavior than the aggregate subsidy values alone.
We also discuss the results of our subsidy analysis in the context of two major policy
initiatives within the past decade to modify oil demand patterns.  The first is the issue of carbontaxes currently being debated.  The second policy is the Btu-tax that was proposed early in theClinton administration's first term.  This discussion underscores the importance of integratingsubsidy removal into ongoing policy reform efforts.
The subsidy metrics are evaluated using three scenarios, reflecting the complexity
associated with U.S. government subsidies that partly benefit foreign rather than domesticpetroleum:

*Many federal programs benefiting oil are partially funded by user fees levied on program beneficiaries.  The subsidy
  figures shown in this exhibit have already deducted user fees.  Detailed data on user fees and gross subsidy values   are provided in the Appendix exhibits.  The final category in this exhibit, "Subsidy Offsets," allows for adjustments to   account for any additional fees on oil that are not program specific, yet appropriately deducted from gross subsidies.  No such adjustments were appropriate in 1995.  Exhibit 2-1 further explains our treatment of federal levies.  ‡Numbers do not add due to rounding.

7-6• Scenario 1 evaluates domestic subsidies only, excluding credit subsidies
to international banks, defense of Persian Gulf oil supplies, and tax breaksfor foreign operations.
• Scenario 2  allocates a portion of the foreign subsidies to the domestic
market, reflecting the fact that some of the foreign oil supported by theseprograms is imported into the United States.
• Scenario 3  sets an upper bound by assuming all subsidies benefit domestic
markets.  Although in reality not all the oil supported by internationallyoriented programs reaches U.S. markets, foreign tax breaks and lendingprograms primarily benefit U.S. corporations, and supply shocks in thePersian Gulf affect the price of all U.S. oil, regardless of its origin.
In each scenario, we have adjusted both the subsidy value and the denominator
(consumption, consumer spending, carbon emissions, and Btus) to best approximate the scope ofthe subsidies included.  The consumption figures used for Scenario 1 are for domestic petroleumonly, and consumer expenditures exclude the value of imported oil prior to domestic refining.Scenarios 2 and 3 include total U.S. consumption and expenditure data.  The specific metrics areshown in Exhibit 7-3; more detail on their derivation can be found in Appendix Exhibit A-7a.
7.3.1    Subsidies as a Percent of Oil Prices
Subsidies to domestic oil are worth between $1.20 and $2.80 per barrel of domestic crude
consumed.  This range is equivalent to roughly 3 to 6.5 percent of consumer expenditures onpetroleum products in 1995.
196  The range is slightly lower in our second scenario, although the
uncertainty associated with the values suggests that the differences would probably not bestatistically significant.
Total federal subsidies for oil are worth as much as 17 percent of 1995 retail petroleum
prices.  Were all, or even most, of the benefits of the subsidies to foreign production to flow backto the U.S. oil sector, the impact on consumption decisions would be considerable.  Under thisscenario, the subsidy intensity of imported oil is much higher than domestic production.  Werethese subsidies eliminated, we would expect the relative competitive position of domestic versusimported oil to improve, with some marginal oil wells again becoming economic.
                                                          
196 Because our subsidy estimates are net of user fees, we have adjusted expenditure data to eliminate the
portion of prices attributable to the various fees on oil.

7-87.3.2    Subsidy Intensity in the Context of Proposed Oil Taxes
Tremendous attention has focused on efficient mechanisms to reduce the impact of
climate change.  Taxes on carbon are an oft-suggested tool to “get the prices right” (i.e., tointernalize environmental externalities) in energy markets.  A number of economists haveestimated economically efficient carbon tax levels that would begin the transition to lower-carbon fuels.  Their results suggest median values of between $9 and $14 per ton.
197
Our three subsidy scenarios suggest that federal oil subsidies are worth $7.50 to nearly
$60 per ton of carbon emitted from U.S. petroleum consumption.  While subsidy removal shouldnot be substituted for a carbon tax, since the latter is aimed specifically at mitigating externalitiesassociated with fossil fuels, the comparison is instructive.  The relative size of the valuessuggests that even without the political will to implement a carbon tax, phasing out oil subsidiescould help to improve the price signals that now exist within oil markets.  In addition, the factthat the subsidy intensity actually exceeds these carbon tax values underscores the marketdistortions that would remain if carbon taxes were implemented without concurrent subsidyreform.
A comparison to proposed taxes on Btus (British thermal units) illustrates a similar point.
Btus measure the heat content of a fuel.  During 1992 and 1993 the U.S. Congress proposed aBtu-based tax on energy.  In addition to raising revenues, proponents argued that the tax wouldensure that energy prices reflected the environmental impacts associated with the production andconsumption of particular fuels.  The proposed tax rate set for oil was $0.31 per million Btu(scaled to 1995 dollars).  In comparison, oil subsidies for 1995 ranged from 50 to 325 percent ofthe proposed tax value, depending on the scenario.  Had the tax been implemented, much of thehoped for benefit in terms of price signals would merely have offset distortions already in placefrom federal subsidies to oil.  Environmental externalities would still not have been reflected inoil prices.
7.3.3    Summary of Subsidy Intensity
The evaluation of subsidies in the context of the oil market demonstrates that subsidies to
oil are important and probably impact oil consumption decisions. Eliminating subsidiesthroughout the fuel cycle will help clarify price signals throughout the production chain,
                                                          
197 The tax values calculated are set at a rate such that the marginal cost of carbon-emitting activities reflects
the (estimated) damage these activities cause the environment.  We chose a median carbon tax estimate over anaverage because the source of our data contained an outlier, $142.50 per metric ton of carbon (1995 dollars), thatexceeded all of the other estimates by more than a factor of six.  Data on the optimal tax rate on carbon are from fivestudies (Nordhaus, Cline, Peck and Tiesberg, Fankauser, and Maddison) summarized in the Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change, Climate Change 1995: Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change , Contribution of
Working Group III to the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC, Cambridge University Press, 1996, Table 6.1, p.215.

7-9improving economic efficiency.  In conjunction with externality-based taxes, the price of oil
would begin to provide suppliers, consumers, and governments much more accurate informationwith which to adjust their economic decision making.
7.4 RECOMMENDATIONS
The impacts of oil subsidies merit greater attention as the world tries to shape a global
climate change strategy and address the many competing needs for scarce government funds.While it has long been recognized that oil prices do not reflect the environmental costs ofpetroleum consumption, our analysis shows that prices do not even reflect the direct costs ofpetroleum production.  At a time of tight fiscal constraints and cuts to social programs, thegovernment should not spend billions of dollars every year to subsidize oil and the environmentalproblems that result from its consumption.
The costs of supplying oil should fall on the user, not on the general taxpayer.  Continued
subsidization of oil makes little sense.  Subsidies to the oil fuel cycle distort oil exploration,production and consumption decisions; reduce the incentive to develop substitutes; intensifyenvironmental degradation; and cost taxpayers billions of dollars per year.  Our analysis suggeststhat subsidy reform can be a positive force in achieving environmental improvements andsubstantial fiscal savings, while also eliminating the price distortions that hinder economicefficiency.  Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the magnitude of subsidies is large enoughthat they can impede the efficacy of other policy reform efforts (such as carbon taxes) if ignored.
The historically low oil prices now in effect provide a tremendous opportunity for
governments to phase out their oil subsidies with minimal inflationary risks.  To help thisprocess, efforts to characterize, report, and remove oil subsidies need to be intensified.  Based onour analysis, we make the following recommendations for structural change.  To reduce theeconomic dislocations, many of these reforms should be phased in over time.
1) Decouple oil subsidies from rural economic development.   Many subsidies to oil
exploration and production are justified on the grounds that they provide jobs and livelihoodsfor isolated rural populations.  Data suggest that development policies focused on naturalresource extraction have rarely been successful.  In addition, rapid advances intelecommunications and computer technology provide an increasing range of developmentoptions for geographically-isolated communities.  By decoupling oil development and jobs,governments can stop subsidizing environmental degradation and work to create cleaner,higher value job opportunities for rural populations.
2) Internalize oil-related defense costs into market prices.   Where governments choose to
intervene in oil markets to ensure the security of supplies, the costs of this interventionshould be recovered through a user fee on oil consumers. Given the magnitude of these costs,excluding them from the price of oil creates significant and undesirable distortions inconsumption behavior.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States
7-103) Treat Strategic Petroleum Reserve like a formal government enterprise.   SPR costs
taxpayers billions of dollars per year in direct costs and foregone interest.  The Reserveshould be treated as a government enterprise, financed through taxes on oil consumption andformally held responsible for repayment of invested capital plus interest.
4) Include subsidy reform as an integral element in strategies to mitigate the impacts of
climate change.   Taxing emissions makes little sense if governments simultaneously
continue to subsidize fossil fuels.  Subsidy identification, reporting, and removal should be anintegral part of climate change mitigation programs.
5) Improve the transparency of oil leases on public lands so terms can be easily compared.
Subsidized lease terms can provide large benefits to oil producers at the taxpayers' expense,
and the resulting acceleration in oil development creates or aggravates environmentalproblems.  Leasing of public oil reserves should be done in a transparent manner at both thefederal and state levels.  Environmental groups should work with the relevant governmentagencies to develop a standard disclosure form to be completed for each sale.  Modificationof lease terms should also be reported in a standardized, publicly available format.  Thisdisclosure form will ensure that lease-related subsidies are visible and that lease terms arecomparable across sales.  Given the international nature of oil markets, the goal of thisdisclosure system should be to allow international comparisons of lease terms.
