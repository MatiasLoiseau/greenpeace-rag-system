CARVING UP THE CONGO

THE WORLD BANK CONDONES
LOGGING AS A POTENTIAL
QUICK FIX ... IN THE NAME
OF DEVELOPMENT

Tropical rainforest destruction and climate
change6 are two fundamental drivers
responsible for the world entering a period of
mass species extinction on a scale not seen
since the age of the dinosaurs.7

Climate change is the greatest threat the
world faces today. This global problem
demands a global solution. In February 2007,
a new report8 from the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underlined the
case for immediate action to reduce all sources
of climate changing GHG emissions, including
deforestation and degradation of forested
land.9 By storing carbon, forests play a
powerful role in mitigating the growing
instability of the climate.

The Congo rainforests of Central Africa form
the second largest remaining block of largely
intact tropical forest in the world. Yet these
globally critical carbon reserves are rapidly
being degraded both by deforestation and by
forest fragmentation – fifty million hectares
of rainforest is being carved up by logging
companies in Central Africa10 (that is an area
the size of Spain) – and important carbon
stocks lost.

The recent return of peace in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), the holding of
democratic elections for the first time in the
country’s history and the review of the legality
of current forestry titles provide a unique
opportunity for the international community
to support genuine development in one of the
world’s poorest countries and take critical
action to protect the global climate.

The recovery of the logging industry is probably
the most significant change impacting the
DRC’s forests in the post-war period.11

Agencies such as the World Bank are using
their enormous financial influence to impose
strategies for economic development on
countries such as the DRC. The DRC’s rich
rainforest and mineral resources, the main
stakes of its recent wars, are now at the core
of donor organisations’ assumptions about
reconstruction. They are viewed as a quick
source of tax revenue and foreign earnings to
kick-start the country’s collapsed economy,
and thereby, supposedly, to lift the country’s
people out of poverty.12

CARVING UP THE CONGO

In this report, Greenpeace looks at the World
Bank’s strategy of forestry reform against the
Bank’s own measures of the effectiveness of
its programmes in poverty alleviation. These
measures, according to the Bank’s ‘Annual
review of development effectiveness 2006:
Getting results’, include:

It is not simply a question of

1. accountable and capable governance

restoring governance systems

and restarting a dormant

2. effective delivery of essential services

difficult challenge of totally

3. sustainable and inclusive economic

governance and economic

systems. This will involve

controlling criminal and

corrupt systems and

gradually replacing them with

democratic systems and
institutions.’13

2003 report for USAID

The first section of this report looks at the
reforms themselves. The second section,
based on Greenpeace research and field
investigations, chronicles the governance,
and social and environmental impacts of
industrial logging.

Our work shows that even against the Bank’s
own measures, its strategy for forestry sector
reform is set to fail. This strategy is
unsustainable since it fails to protect Africa’s
remaining rainforests, their biodiversity and
their critical contribution to protecting the
global climate. The strategy has also proved
ineffective in neighbouring countries at
tackling corruption or driving genuine
development by supporting the rights and
needs of forest-dwelling communities.

THE DRC: LARGEST STRONGHOLD
OF CENTRAL AFRICA’S GLOBALLY
SIGNIFICANT CONGO RAINFORESTS
The spectacular Congo rainforests of Central
Africa form the second largest rainforest block
on earth after the Amazon forest, covering
more than 172 million hectares.14 The
rainforest contains numerous species of plants
and animals found nowhere else on earth. The
Congo forests are critical to the survival of our
closest animal relatives: the bonobo, the
chimpanzee and the gorilla. Millions of people,
too, rely on the rainforest for shelter, medicine,
food and their cultural survival.

In global terms, the forest plays a critical role
in keeping the planet’s climate stable by
storing carbon.15 The DRC alone accounts for
over 8% of that part of the world’s carbon
stocks which is held in forest biomass and
75% of those left in the tropical rainforests of
Central and West Africa.16

But the future of DRC’s rainforest and of the
life that depends upon it is in jeopardy. The
expansion of industrial logging into remaining
areas of intact forest is the single largest
threat to these forests.17 Across Central Africa,
widespread destruction has been brought by
industrial logging, both directly and via the
influx of settlers, poachers and artisanal or
small-scale miners that arrive once logging
roads have opened a way into the forest.
Outside the DRC, 71% of the richest Congo
rainforest area is slated for logging.18

Intact areas of rainforest are critical for
biodiversity protection and global
environmental services. Two-thirds19 of the
remaining intact areas of Central Africa’s Congo
rainforest lies within the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC).20 Ironically, as a result of
decades of despotism and war, much of the
DRC’s rainforest has not yet been destroyed by
the large-scale industrial logging and forest
clearance that has ravaged the rainforests
elsewhere in Africa. Consequently, the DRC has
the largest remaining unbroken areas of largely
intact rainforest, vital to healthy ecosystem
functioning and the survival of large forest
mammals such as elephants.21 Well over a
quarter22 of the DRC is still covered with large
areas of intact rainforest, covering some 60
million hectares.23 Within Central Africa as a
whole, only 8.5% of the remaining areas of
intact rainforest enjoys ‘protected’ status.24

THE BATTLE FOR THE DRC’S
RESOURCES: WINNERS AND
LOSERS
Local people and the wildlife of the DRC have
all suffered as a result of years of conflict in
the battle for control over the country’s rich
resources. With the end of war and democratic
elections in the DRC, the international
community now has a unique opportunity to
ensure that this rainforest is conserved. This is
important for the well-being of the
communities whose way of life and future
depend upon it, the region’s unique wildlife,
and the sake of the global climate. Urgent
action is needed to avoid replicating the
failures of the past.

In order to understand why the World Bank-
led reforms to the forestry sector in the DRC
are an inappropriate development model for
poverty alleviation, they must be seen
against the background of the preceding
decade of upheaval.

Since 1996 with the overthrow of General
Mobutu, continuing through nearly a decade of

ferocious fighting and atrocities against the
civilian population, and up to the country’s first
multiparty democratic parliamentary elections
at the end of 2006, the DRC has been a
battleground in a fight for control of natural
resources.25

At its height, at least seven foreign armies
were involved in the war. For these forces –
both foreign and Congolese – conflict was
primarily an opportunity to loot the DRC’s
resources.26 ‘Corrupt and criminal elites’,
backed by foreign multinationals, joined in the
free-for-all for control of the natural wealth
of the DRC.27

During the war, extensive logging titles were
awarded. One incentive for this large-scale
speculation was the price: until 2003, a
200,000-hectare logging title cost only $286
per year in forest area tax.28 These low taxes
encouraged companies to acquire titles to
forest they were not in a position to exploit,
hoping to sublease to other investors once
economic and political stability was
established.29

CARVING UP THE CONGO

By 2002, even though production was at a
virtual standstill because of the war, about
43.5 million hectares of forest – an area larger
than California and twice the size of the United
Kingdom – were controlled by the logging
industry31 (in addition to a dubious
arrangement with the Zimbabwean army to
log 34 million hectares of forests made,
ostensibly, in return for Zimbabwean military
support for the Kinshasa authorities32).
Requests for new titles have continued to pour
into the Ministry of Environment.33

The 285 long-term holdings current in 2002
overlapped with villages, agricultural lands and
biodiversity hotspots, depriving forest
communities of the right to manage their own
forests. The establishment of new protected
areas or community forests, or of forest-based
activities other than logging, was made
impossible in these areas.34 As a World Bank-
led forestry sector review summarises the
situation: ‘Forests were seized by logging
interests and there was little space left for
other forest uses.’35

These problems remain today.

After the war, a new fight for control of
the rainforest
According to Transparency International, the
DRC is one of the most corrupt countries in
the world.36 It has been classified as the classic
‘failed state’ in Africa – unable to control its
territory or resources – in a report
commissioned by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID),37 among
other sources.38

While war obviously provided a critical
opportunity for massive land grabbing in
recent years, the heart of the problem can be
ascribed to the economy of plunder and the
institutional corruption that has long
characterised the DRC’s political class. For
forty years, public office has been synonymous
with personal profit.39 The rule of law does
not exist in the DRC.

The logging sector is characterised by
corruption.41 As elsewhere, lawlessness and
corruption are an open invitation to loggers to
log irresponsibly without fear of sanction. This
situation has the effect of attracting the most
unscrupulous companies to the DRC, providing
even greater stimulus to corruption. As a
report for USAID on conflict timber states:

‘The DRC’s unenviable reputation as one of the
world’s most corrupt countries in fact
discourages honest logging companies from
operating in the country because they
recognise that they will be competing against a
set of companies accustomed to operating in
highly corrupt environments. Dishonest,
aggressive companies – “operators” – may,
however, find such an environment attractive
because they see opportunities for quick

profits in a context where rules are poorly
enforced, bribery is commonplace, and
unscrupulous entrepreneurs have broad leeway
to operate as they will. These firms are well
capitalised, as witnessed by the half million
dollar bribe reportedly offered by a Malaysian
lumber company to the DRC’s timber
allocation unit to obtain logging concessions.’42

dwelling communities and the fate of the
global environment. It is widely feared that
the imminent conclusion of the World Bank-
led legal review of current forest holdings is
set to confirm the vast majority of logging
titles and to open the way to the issuing of
further concessions. The battle is now at a
turning point.

In the words of the International Security
Information Service, ‘It is questionable whether
a legitimate industry can even exist in the DRC
where corruption is rampant and accountability
minimal.’43

A new battle for control of the DRC’s
rainforest is now in full swing, with the
interests of logging companies and corrupt
officials set against the rights of forest-

The questions that must be asked are: why
does the World Bank persist in supporting an
industrial logging-led model as the basis for
development, when this model is clearly
unable to make a meaningful contribution to
the fight against corruption, poverty
alleviation, or environmental protection? How
does it propose to help meet the monumental
challenge of supporting genuine development
in the DRC?

CARVING UP THE CONGO

DRC RAINFOREST DESTRUCTION:
THE WORLD BANK IS A
POWERFUL PLAYER
THE WORLD BANK HOLDS THE PURSE
STRINGS BUT WHO CALLS THE SHOTS?
Controlled by rich industrialised countries, the
World Bank is one of the world’s largest
sources of funding for developing countries. It
is the most important international donor in
the DRC, with direct influence on government
policy through its contribution to state
finances. Donor aid currently accounts for
nearly 60% of the DRC’s national budget.44

The World Bank suspended financial assistance
to the DRC during the conflicts of the 1990s
and resumed lending in 2001. By August 2006,
the World Bank Group had approved loans,
credits and grants to the DRC worth more
than $4 billion.45

The World Bank is by far the most influential
international actor behind the reform of the
DRC forestry sector. Several of the World
Bank’s budgetary support operations in the
DRC have been specifically linked to the
implementation of forest reform measures.

In June 2002, the World Bank approved a
$450 million Economic Recovery Credit for the
DRC. The release of $15 million of this was
made conditional on the adoption of the DRC
Forestry Code.46 The negotiations on this
structural credit between the World Bank and
the interim DRC Government also resulted in
the May 2002 moratorium on the granting of
new logging titles.47

One objective of the World Bank’s December
2005 $90 million budgetary support was that
the 2002 moratorium be maintained until the
completion of a legal review of existing titles
and the development of a three-year
geographical distribution plan for future
concessions. In response, the President Kabila
issued a presidential decree in October 2005
upholding the moratorium and laying out
criteria and a timeline for a legal review.48

The World Bank’s mission in the context of the
DRC’s forests is to help tackle corruption,
alleviate poverty, promote and support

sustainable development and consolidate
peace, while safeguarding the DRC’s globally
important natural heritage.49 However, the
Bank’s actual policy and project work on the
ground in the DRC focuses on generating
export-derived revenue for the Government
on the basis of exploitation of the DRC’s
natural resources. The DRC’s rich rainforest and
mineral resources are at the core of the Bank’s
assumptions about reconstruction. They are
viewed as a quick source of tax revenue and
foreign earnings to kick-start the country’s
collapsed economy,50 and thereby to lift the
country’s people out of poverty.

The majority of the World Bank’s operations
have been classified as either ‘emergency
lending’, or adjustment loans for policy reforms
and budget support, for which the Bank’s
social and environmental safeguard policies do
not apply.51 Further, because the reforms are
more an expression of the World Bank than the
autonomous political vision of the DRC
Government, their viability is questionable,
given the potential lack of political will for
their on-the-ground implementation in years
to come.52

The real decision-makers at the World Bank
are member governments. Member
governments exercise the direction of the
World Bank through a Board of Governors.
There is one governor for each of the 184
member countries, consisting mainly of finance
and development ministers from the
represented countries.53 The Board usually
meets once a year to review operations and
basic policies; it also controls the budget. The
Board delegates the day-to-day running of the
Bank to 24 full-time Executive Directors based
at the Bank’s headquarters in Washington DC.
Unlike the United Nations, where each member
nation has an equal vote, voting power at the
World Bank is determined by a nation’s
financial contribution. Five countries control
nearly 40% of all votes: France, Germany,
Japan, the United Kingdom and the United
States.54

The World Bank and those who control it have
not yet exercised their influence to ensure that
the Bank’s financial support for the DRC is
used appropriately or effectively to achieve
genuine development.

GREENPEACE INVESTIGATIONS EXPOSE
THE FLAW IN WORLD BANK STRATEGY
Greenpeace’s field investigations in both
Cameroon and the DRC expose how counting
on the logging industry to fight poverty tends
to have the opposite result, compromising
efforts to tackle corruption and build good
governance, and failing to meet the needs of
the poor or to ensure the long-term health of
the global environment.

Beyond the rhetoric, the World Bank’s
commitment to the principle of using the
forestry sector to generate revenue that can
be ‘trickled down’ to benefit forest dwelling
communities and protect the environment has
been implemented to only a limited extent in
the DRC, resulting in little positive impact.
The practical application of the principle so far
amounts to the devolution of tax revenue for
local development projects, and the proposed
formalisation of a pre-existing ad hoc system
whereby logging companies enter into social
responsibility contracts (cahiers des charges)
with forest dwelling communities to provide
social assistance, facilities and infrastructure –
these ‘contracts of shame’ amount to little
more than licenses to loot.

Taxes or private income?
Central to World Bank strategy is the concept
that by allocating rainforest to logging
companies and collecting tax on it, the DRC
Government will have money for development
for rainforest communities. In 2003–2006, no
taxes have been redistributed to local
authorities in the DRC. No accounting or
distribution systems at the provincial or
territory levels have been established by the
DRC Government to distribute taxes.57

Greenpeace fears that the same mechanisms
of fraud, corruption and embezzlement of
public funds that sank Cameroon’s forest
reform will become prevalent in the DRC
forestry sector.

Social responsibility contracts are little more
than licences to loot
World Bank-driven reforms formalise a colonial
tradition whereby a logging company deals
with local communities in an area of forest
where the company wishes to prospect or log.
Rather than genuinely contributing to poverty
alleviation, this approach produces forest
community dependency on the industry in
exchange for the loss of their forest resources.
Building schools and hospitals is a central
function of the state, and should not be reliant
on handouts from profit-making companies –
which generally complete such projects to very
low standards or fail to carry them out
altogether. When entering into these contracts
the objective of logging companies is simply to
‘buy’ social peace by offering the most meagre
benefits they can get away with – the deals
are depicted by one source as ‘wood in return
for beer and a football pitch’.60

A World Bank-led forestry sector review
concedes that these contracts are a poor
substitute for state provision:

‘In well functioning States, the State provides
social services throughout the country. In the
DRC context, the cahier des charges [social
responsibility contract] makes up for the
State’s inability to provide such services in
remote areas.’61

By defending this arrangement as a ‘legitimate’
substitute for properly planned and equitable
development, without any suggestion that
this will be a purely temporary arrangement
until the State can build up sufficient capacity
to assume these responsibilities, the World
Bank is helping build dependence on logging
rather than fostering genuine development
in the DRC.

The following timeline describes the key
events in international involvement in the DRC
during and following the wars. As this shows,
while many international bodies have called
for the corrupt system of control of natural
resources – including the rainforest – to be
tackled, in many respects the problem has
increased.

April 1999 –
Recommendation to cancel dormant
logging titles

In April 1999, a DRC Government
Interministerial Committee on Timber
recommends ‘rescinding all agreements and
contracts for non inventoried, abandoned
and/or undeveloped forests’.62 No immediate
action is taken by the Government.

June 2000 –
UN Security Council sets up fact
finding mission

In June 2000, the UN Security Council (UNSC)
establishes a panel of experts to collect
information on activities of illegal exploitation
of natural resources in the DRC.63 Although
the panel’s fact finding mission is intended to
include diamonds, gold, coltan, copper, cobalt,
timber, wildlife reserves, fiscal resources and
trade in general, most of the work of the panel
pertains to mineral resources. The panel
publishes its findings in October 2002 (see
below).

November 2001 –
UN Security Council recommends
the imposition of a boycott on
the trade in resources including
hardwood originating in
rebel-held zones

2001 –
World Bank resumes aid to the DRC

In 2001, the World Bank re-engages with the
DRC. By August 2006, the World Bank has
approved loans, credits and grants to the DRC
worth more than $4 billion.64 Much of this is
linked to reform of the forestry sector.

April 2002 –
Commission to review wartime title
allocations

The Sun City Agreement, signed in South
Africa in April 2002, establishes the transitional
DRC Government to run the country until
democratic elections can be held, and provides
for a parliamentary commission to review the
legality of extractive titles allocated during the
recent wars to make sure they conform with
Congolese law and that taxes due to the State
in respect of them have been paid.67

The commission’s report, known as the
Lutundula Report,68 is not submitted to
parliament until June 2005, by which time
events have overtaken it; moreover it focuses
largely on mining rather than the logging
industry. Nevertheless, that it is commissioned
at all shows that the Government already
recognises that the allocation of rights to
extractive industries poses a problem.

May 2002 –
Moratorium on the issuing of new
logging titles is imposed and
immediately violated

In May 2002, as part of negotiations over
budgetary support, the World Bank persuades
the transitional Government to impose a
moratorium on the issuing of new logging
titles. This is intended to allow time to review
the legality of the logging contracts that
remained after the initial April 2002 tax review
and to complete all the legal decrees necessary
to implement the new framework Forestry
Code (see below), also developed under
pressure from the Bank.73

On 14 May 2002, the Ministry of
Environment issues a decree74 suspending
the allocation of new industrial logging
titles75 and the renewal or extension of
existing ones, pending ‘the adoption of
transparent allocation procedures’.76

However, the moratorium is violated almost
immediately. New logging contracts for
Soforma and CFT are signed on 31 May 2002
– barely two weeks after the moratorium
is imposed.77

August 2002 –
The Forestry Code adopted

Modelled on the Forestry Law that the World
Bank developed for Cameroon in 1994, the
Forestry Code is to be the principal legal tool
for reform of the forestry sector in the DRC.
As in Cameroon, the law is pushed through by
the World Bank. The release of $15 million of
budgetary support is made conditional on its
adoption78 and consequently law 11/2002 is
adopted by the transitional Government of the
DRC in August 2002, replacing the 1949
colonial forestry regulations. The Forestry Code
claims to make a key contribution to
environmentally responsible and socially just
development:

‘The forestry system aims to promote rational

economic, social and cultural development for
today’s generation while preserving the forest

October 2002 –
UN Security Council recommends
review of wartime logging titles

In October 2002, the UNSC finally publishes
the findings of its independent panel of
experts on the illegal exploitation of the
natural resources of the DRC.81 Its
recommendations include the examination of
wartime-issued logging titles, and calls for the
World Bank among others to provide the
support necessary for such a review:

‘Reforms of the mining and the forestry sectors
should include the review of all concessions
and contracts signed during both wars. On
the basis of the Panel’s findings, this could also
target all informal agreements on the awarding
of concessions and the implementation of
contracts. The international community,
including the World Bank, the International
Finance Corporation and UNDP, could
collaborate closely with this commission and
provide the support necessary for it to carry
out its work in a thorough and objective
manner.’82 (Greenpeace emphasis)

June 2002–May 2003 –
New titles granted

THE NUMBERS GAME
May 2003: 132 logging
titles covering 19,403,498
hectares of rainforest83

A year after the decree instituting a
moratorium on new allocations of logging
titles, a first list is published of existing titles to
be subject to legal review prior to conversion
to concessions in line with the new Forestry
Code. The list published on 24 May 2003 in le
Potentiel84 – the DRC’s leading newspaper –
includes logging titles covering an additional
1.5 million hectares of rainforest that do not
appear on the Ministry of Environment’s
unpublished 2002 list of 122 titles covering
18 million hectares.85

2003 –
The World Bank extractive
industries review completed

The World Bank-commissioned Extractive
Industries Review (EIR) evaluation of the
contribution of World Bank projects is
completed. It concludes that, where basic
conditions of good governance are absent, the
oil, gas and mining sectors have no record and
little hope of contributing to poverty
reduction.86

Its final report presents a series of
recommendations, including that the World
Bank should not support private investment
in extractive industries in countries where
pro-poor governance is inadequate.87
In August 2004, the World Bank Group
responds by making commitments to change
its operations and policies.88

June 2005 –
Lutundula report published

The Lutundula Report on extractive titles
issued during wartime advises that the
management of natural resources has
worsened during the transitional period in the
lead up to democratic elections (2002-2006),
recommends that many titles be reviewed and
urges that no new ones be allocated.89

July 2005 –
Ministry of Finance tax review
of logging contracts

In July 2005 the Ministry of Finance publishes
how much area tax had been collected for the
year 2004. About 45% of area tax (annual tax
on the land area) is unpaid by logging
companies, which suggests that contracts
covering many millions of hectares are being
held by operators who fail to comply with the
terms of their contracts.90 Companies included
on the published list of defaulters include
Trans-M, Siforco, and Soforma (NST).91
According to the Ministry of Environment, only
18 contracts covering 2.1 million are cancelled
in 2005.92

October 2005 –

natural resource exploitation

On 25 January 2007, the UNSC panel of
experts presents its latest report.101
It recommends:
‘Urgent intervention against all forms of illegal
natural resource exploitation is required … The
Group of Experts recommends that the
existing laws of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, particularly the regulations
governing natural resources and their orderly
exploitation, be used as a baseline for a new
sanctions regime.’102

Late 2007? –
Legal review grants successful
companies four year license to
loot?

Once the legal review is completed, logging
companies whose titles have been accepted
for conversion will have four years in which to
put together a forest management plan
addressing social and environmental issues. If
the example of Cameroon’s experience is
indicative, during this time they may carry on
their unregulated plunder of the rainforests as
usual. What will happen to cancelled titles is
still unclear. The 2005 presidential decree
states that companies have the right to appeal,
but local communities directly affected by the
outcome do not. Will legal challenges allow
companies whose titles have been cancelled to
continue exploiting them while their challenges
proceed through the courts, a process that
could take years?

titles to concessions in accordance with the
Forestry Code.

Finally, under further pressure from the World
Bank as a result of the weaknesses of these
ministerial decrees and the continued
moratorium violations, on 24 October 2005
the president of the DRC issues a decree94
confirming the validity of the May 2002
moratorium, and extending the criteria to be
met before it can be lifted. In addition, the
presidential decree formally initiates a legal
review requiring an assessment of the validity
of all existing logging titles submitted
for conversion in line with the new
Forestry Code.95

The decree commits the DRC Government to
maintaining the moratorium on the awarding
of new concessions until new rules for the
awarding of logging titles through public
auction are adopted, until the legal review is
completed, and until the adoption of ‘a three-
year rolling plan for future concessions based
on participatory process of public consultation
… so that excessively large forest areas are not
opened up too quickly’.96

CARVING UP THE CONGO

WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT, WORLD
BANK-LED FORESTRY INITIATIVES
CAN MAKE POVERTY WORSE
The World Bank states that good governance
and anti-corruption are central to poverty
alleviation.

The World Bank congratulates itself for the
April 2002 (tax) review which cancelled
forestry titles covering 25 million hectares. Its
online Q & A celebrates this ‘cancellation of
non-compliant concessions [sic]’ as ‘an
unprecedented move anywhere in the world’,
critical to ‘slow[ing] the expansion of logging’
and ‘free[ing] up space for potential new
protected areas in the rainforest part of the
country.’103 In fact, in the absence of good
governance, the cancellation of non-compliant
titles has freed up space for new, predatory
logging operations.

The key initiatives introduced by the World
Bank to regain control of the industrial logging
industry – the moratorium on the allocation of
new forest holdings, the legal review of current
forest holdings, and the Forestry Code
governing the management of the forest – are
set to fail because they do not challenge the
corruption that characterises business and
politics in the DRC. The legal review’s narrow
scope (which may not even be rigorously
applied), the failure to enact decrees to
implement the key social and environmental
provisions of the Forestry Code, and the
absence of mechanisms to enforce both the
Forestry Code and the moratorium and to
penalise infractions, all contribute to undermine
forestry reform.

While few new areas have been protected since
the 2002 moratorium, the DRC Government
has signed logging contracts for new titles
(new allocations), new title boundaries
(extended titles), and renewal of existing titles.

In some cases, new contracts have been signed
for titles in areas previously occupied by ‘non-
compliant titles’, many of them in intact forest
landscapes. Apparent examples include CFT,
Forabola, ITB, Sicobois,  Sodefor, and Trans-M.104

The legal review – another World Bank-led
attempt to bring the logging industry in the
DRC under control – also looks set to endorse
the de facto expansion of industrial logging.

The remit of this legal review amounts to a
paper review. Beyond payment of tax and the
title having been obtained following due
process, to pass the legal review a logging title
must ‘[comply] with boundaries as defined by
the contract and the topographical map
attached to said contract’.

This is a critical issue because many companies
(eg Sodefor and Siforco) handed back forest
post-2002 when taxes were set to increase.
They may have been granted new (updated)
contracts at this stage to reflect the change
and may have taken the opportunity to redraw
their boundaries. This means that companies
will have had the opportunity to effectively
launder new forest holdings through the legal
paper review (no on the ground checks have
been possible).

The potential bypassing of due process to gain
new forest holdings is a governance,
environmental and a social issue. On the latter

point, while the Forestry Code does recognise
the rights of forest dwelling communities in the
process of allocating new areas of forest, they
will effectively be marginalised by the legal
review due to inadequate consultation with no
appropriate mechanisms to resolve outstanding
conflicts. This is left to the development of
forest management plans, which companies
have four years to prepare.

Fundamentally, in the context of the DRC – as
elsewhere in Africa – focusing primarily on the
raising of state revenue through industry
reform does not create the necessary
preconditions to bring genuine development
because it does not tackle corruption.

THE MORATORIUM HAS FAILED TO PREVENT
MILLIONS OF HECTARES OF LOGGING TITLES
BEING AWARDED
As the numbers show (see pp82–85), the
moratorium – while intended to allow time
for the development of a more considered,
coherent and effective approach to the
management of the DRC’s forest resource –
has failed to clamp down on the allocation of
new forest titles.

Right from the start of the moratorium in May
2002, ‘interest groups began to undermine the
reform strategy by taking advantage of the
fragile coalition government’.107 As a result,
industrial logging rights have continued to be
granted. The official list published in November
2005 includes 100 forestry contracts signed
after the moratorium began, covering a total
of 15 million hectares.108

How have logging companies and officials
allowed this violation of the law to happen?
A World Bank-led forestry sector review
identifies various irregularities. For instance:
‘Companies reportedly relinquished forests
they found non-productive or they had already
logged over, but in some cases these low-
value forests were exchanged for new ones.
Thirty-two contracts covering 4.6 million
hectares were reportedly awarded in 2003
under the guise of such “remapping” or
“exchange” of old titles. Similar transactions
seem to have continued in 2004 and 2005
under the guise of “readjustments” and
“relocations”.’109

CARVING UP THE CONGO

23

While such ‘exchanges’ do not necessarily
increase the total area under title, they are in
all but name, new titles. They open up new
areas of forest to logging with all the
associated impacts, without proper land use
planning, without transparency, without open
and competitive allocation, and without
consideration to other forest uses (see NST
case study below). The review also notes that
across these 32 titles ‘there appears to be a
discrepancy of more than 1 million hectares’
between the forest area described in the titles
and the boundaries drawn on the maps
attached to them.110 Another irregularity
identified by the World Bank-led forestry
sector review is the ‘rehabilitation’ of at least 7
titles that were cancelled in 2002, covering
2.4 million hectares.

This information, available in a recent joint
World Bank report to which the World Bank
contributed,111 leads to two important
conclusions. Firstly, that the scale of the
problem is massive (whatever the actual area
of forest involved). And secondly, that it is
impossible for anyone other than the World
Bank, the Independant Observer – overseeing
the legal review of logging titles pre- or post-
monatorium – and the DRC Government to
make considered judgement of the situation
due to the opacity with which information
relating to the industry is presented (for
instance, the failure to name logging
companies or to present maps). Throughout
the reform process, no maps have been made
publicly available by either the DRC
Government or the Independent Observer,
further obstructing efforts to expose
moratorium violations through improved
transparency.

A report funded by the UK Department for
International Development alleges that many
of the logging titles allocated following the
moratorium have represented a valuable
‘currency’ to members of the political elite.112
Hence, in the absence of enforcement – either
by the appropriate State authorities, or through
other forms of action against those profiting
from corruption – foreign companies have not
only benefited from but clearly reinforced the
political corruption that has controlled the
DRC’s resources throughout its history.

CARVING UP THE CONGO

NORD-SUD TIMBER CASHES IN
ON 3 MILLION HECTARES OF
RAINFOREST IN BREACH OF
THE MORATORIUM

During 2002–03 the companies of the
Liechtenstein-based, Portuguese-owned and
managed Nordsudtimber (NST) group, in
collaboration with officials in the DRC’s Ministry
of Environment organised a major restructuring
of the group’s forest titles.113 The DRC State
has been a shareholder in at least one of the
NST group of companies, and the present level
of state participation or political shareholders
NST or its subsidiaries (Sodefor, Soforma,
Forabola, CFT) is unclear.114

Perhaps motivated by the increase in the forest
area tax from $0.062/ha in 2003 to $0.50/ha
in 2007,115 NST abandoned large areas of
unproductive forest (logged-out forests and
areas unsuitable for logging such as savannah
or swamp). Certain NST logging titles were
completely abandoned, and others only
partially, with boundaries being modified to
exclude the non-productive forest.116 At the
same time, however, the group obtained a
number of new logging titles after the
moratorium was signed.117

Figures on how much new forest NST obtained
vary, but conservative estimates indicate that
the vast majority of NST’s forest holdings (over
65%, covering more than 3 million hectares)
are new forest areas which it did not control
prior to the moratorium.118

In 2004 and 2005, the then Vice President
Abdoulaye Yérodia and then Minister of
Forestry Anselme Enerunga confirmed the
‘legality’ of these titles,119 notwithstanding
their post-moratorium allocation.

NST argues that all these new titles are
legitimate: it claims not to have been aware of
the existence of the moratorium, and
everything was arranged with the Ministry of
Environment.120

NST does not dispute that it is logging in areas
it did not control at the time of the moratorium
– only it prefers not to call the titles in question
‘new awards’. In a 2004 response to
Greenpeace’s request for information, Sodefor
(an NST company) manager José Albano Maia
Trindade explained:

‘Recently, a redefinition of part of Sodefor’s
concessions was carried out with the objective
of effectively allocating useful logging areas, in
conformity with the permits we controlled, and
which would give us the means to restart our
activities at the end of the war years. It’s thus
not a question of the award of new
concessions.’121 [Greenpeace emphasis]

Clearly numerous new titles have been
allocated under the guise of a ‘redefinition’ or
‘exchange’ of old titles. These awards
nevertheless constitute new acquisitions, and
thus violate the moratorium.

In addition, these new NST titles seem to
violate the new DRC Forestry Code:122

s Method of allocation: NST post-moratorium
titles were all arranged via discretionary
procedures rather than via a public auction
procedure. It is difficult to argue that the
allocations of several dozen titles covering
three million hectares can all be presented as
‘exceptional cases’, as required by Article 83
of the Code.

s Sale price for allocation: Since no floor price
for auctioning concessions had been set at
the time the new titles were allocated, it was
impossible to fix a price for discretionary
allocations as required by Article 86.

s Area of allocation: The area obtained has

been largely in excess of 500,000 hectares,
in contravention of Article 92 which limits
the area of new titles that any one company
can obtain.

s Consultation with local communities: There
was no public consultation on the new
allocations, in contravention of Article 94
(indeed, the rules for public consultation
were yet to be defined by ministerial decree
at the time NST’s new titles were arranged)

s Redundant framework: Finally, the new titles
are referred to as ‘letter of intent’ and ‘wood
product supply guarantee’. Neither of these
types of permit are recognised in the new
Forestry Code and they can no longer legally
be allocated.

These new NST title allocations have also been
granted in the absence of land use planning,
since the process of forest zoning stipulated in
the Forestry Code has been stalled (see page
58–63). Proper land use planning prior to any
increase in forest controlled by industrial
logging interests is essential to ensuring socially
just and environmentally responsible
development for the DRC.

areas where local people depend heavily on the

(Equateur Province) are both partially located in
the Maringa-Lopori-Wamba landscape (see
pp61–62), an area which has been identified
as a priority landscape for conservation by the
Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP).123

Many of the NST titles are located in intact
forest landscapes and other areas of high
conservation value, including bonobo habitat,

CARVING UP THE CONGO

THE LEGAL REVIEW: WILL IT LAUNDER
ILLEGAL TITLES AND LEAVE CORRUPTION
UNCHALLENGED?
The legal review is a crisis point for the World
Bank, the DRC Government and the country’s
rainforest – the future of more than 20 million
hectares of forest hangs in the balance.
The legal review is a crucial opportunity to
stand up for good governance and the rule of
law. A display of firm governance is urgently
needed by cancelling forest contracts held by
loggers who have gained control of the
rainforest illegitimately, or whose operations
support corruption or violate social and
environmental laws.

Unfortunately, however, the legal review looks
set to reward corruption rather than tackle it,
due to the weakness of the criteria against
which it will assess the legitimacy of titles. The
review will not look at the way titles were
originally awarded – eg whether they were
awarded during wartime, or whether bribery
or other corrupt exchanges were involved –
but merely at whether or not companies have
complied with the terms of the contract
agreed with the Ministry of Environment. New
logging titles agreed with the Ministry of
Environment after May 2002 ought to fail the
legal review as they violate both the
moratorium125 and the Forestry Code.

The review will assess legality in terms of
compliance with a few very basic elements,126
the most important being the ‘legal validity of
the title’ (ie that it was obtained in accordance
with the correct procedures), ‘full payment of
forest area fees since 2003’ (ie since the end
of the war) and ‘complying with boundaries as
defined by the contract and the topographical
map attached to said contract’.127 On various
occasions in 2006, Greenpeace has sought
clarification of the actual scope of the review
from the appointed Independent Observer128
team overseeing the process (staffed by the
World Resources Institute (WRI) and Agreco).
They responded as follows:

s Payment of taxes: Article 118 of the
Forestry Code stipulates that ‘Any
suspension of payment [of taxes] shall
constitute ... a cause of forfeiture and result
in the cancellation of the forest contract.’129

The DRC Government has already been lax in
enforcing the area tax. In 2004, for instance,
according to a World Bank-led forestry sector
review, 45% of area tax on logging titles was
unpaid.130 A DRC Ministry of Finance 2005 list
of titles that had not paid tax in 2003-2004
shows that of the contracts up for conversion
that were signed prior to the moratorium, only
about 40 did not appear on the list of
defaulters during this period.131 As of March
2007, the definitive listing of tax payments
2003-05 has still not been published. In the
fourth report on its activities, the Independent
Observer complains of significant
discrepancies between documentation made
available for review.132

s Compliance with boundaries: The

Greenpeace suspects that retrospective
payment will be deemed acceptable. In other
words, legality will be bought retrospectively.

Independent Observer agrees with
Greenpeace that the ‘presence of infraction
reports is an inadequate means of verifying

CARVING UP THE CONGO

27

Greenpeace fears that the legal review is not
going to seize the opportunity to contribute to
poverty alleviation and environmental
protection by reining in the worst excesses of
the logging companies.

THE WORLD BANK LEAVES THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF MEASURES TO
MITIGATE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL
IMPACTS LARGELY TO THE INDUSTRY ITSELF
Under the Forestry Code (see below) logging
companies who keep their forest holdings have
four years from the conclusion of the legal
review to prepare forest management plans in
which major outstanding social and
environmental issues should, in theory, be
resolved (during which time they can keep
logging with virtual impunity).138 Deferring
resolution of outstanding social and
environmental conflicts to the development of
the forest management plan leaves logging
companies free to resolve these issues
themselves in whatever way they see fit
rather than obliging companies to deal with
these issues properly and in advance of the
conversion process.

In Greenpeace’s view, this arrangement is
overly favourable to the companies and
unlikely to foster environmental and social
responsibility, particularly in view of some
companies’ dismissive attitude to forest
management plans (see below). As the
Independent Observer admits, it ‘creates a
presumption that because the titles have
already been awarded for industrial forestry
this land is indeed suitable for this purpose.
Also the conversion process will not benefit
from any social and environmental safeguards
attached to the zoning process.’139 The legal
review process as it stands will in fact amount
to de facto land use planning in the absence of
key evidence as to the suitability of the land
for industrial forestry and the threats to social
and environmental interests. This is not an
acceptable position. Instead, the resolution of
such issues and any conflicts arising should
be a clear criterion of progress through the
legal review.

title holder’s respect of boundaries in the
DRC’. In a letter to Greenpeace in November
2006, the Independent Observer admitted:
‘It is a weakness in the process that we are
concerned about, but we do not have a
feasible alternative to offer.’133

This admission effectively rules out one of the
criteria of the legal review, and potentially
legitimises gross tax avoidance in cases where
loggers have been logging larger areas of
forest than that for which they have paid the
relevant taxes.

s Validity of title: According to the

Independent Observer, the correct
application process will have to have been
observed (ie obtaining a Prospecting
Authorisation and then a Letter of Intent
before receiving a Guarantee of Supply) and
the title holder must have a functioning
processing plant.134

Thus the review seems unlikely to be effective
even on its own narrow terms. There is also a
question mark over what will happen if and
when titles in violation of the moratorium are
actually cancelled: title holders are likely to use
their right of appeal to play for time and
continue logging.135 Logging and the
establishment of logging infrastructure are
already under way in many of the titles
allocated in breach of the moratorium,
amounting to de facto land use decisions in
favour of industrial logging which will be
extremely challenging to reverse.

In October 2006, a coalition of NGOs including
Greenpeace contacted the World Bank to raise
further concerns about the shortcomings and
risks of the legal review.136 These included:

s failure to undertake participatory land use

planning (zoning) prior to the completion of
the legal review process

s the absence of a guarantee that social

conflicts within existing logging title areas
will be fully assessed and every effort made
to resolve them prior to the completion of
the legal review process (see social chapter)

Similar concerns have been expressed by the
Independent Observer.137

ITB SEES FOREST MANAGEMENT
PLANS AS A PAPER EXERCISE
‘TO PLEASE THE WORLD BANK’

The requirement of the Forestry Code that
each logging company draw up a management
plan for every concession it holds is viewed
dismissively by some logging companies,
this is unsurprising given the country’s lack
of enforcement capacity.

The Lebanese company Industrie de
Transformation de Bois (ITB) is operating
adjacent to the Lake Télé-Lake Tumba Swamp
Forest landscape,140 the most extensive block
of swamp and seasonally inundated forest in
Africa. The landscape is important for the
conservation of bonobo and other threatened
species. The CBFP has identified this area as
key for biodiversity conservation planning in
the Congo Basin.

ITB is already logging in the area, and it appears
that the company considers the preparation of
a forest management plan for its titles to be a
bureaucratic formality. In the presence of
Greenpeace investigators, ITB’s chief forester
(chef de chantier) in Bikoro admitted: ‘The
people who are preparing regulations for
management plans have no idea of the reality

on the ground … We are going to present a
management plan to please the World Bank.’141

‘The other reforms we

intended to undertake were

delayed and had to be

postponed, particularly the

implementation of the

Program to Secure Forestry

Revenue, the transfer of 40%

of the area tax receipts to

local governments, the

preparation and adoption of

regulations implementing the

Forestry Code (awarding of

development, and combating

illegal operations), and the

submission to Parliament of

the draft Law on the
Conservation of Nature.’144

DRC Government

The company has built a logyard and wharf
near Bikoro in a bay at the edge of Lake
Tumba. (The company’s logs are stored there
before they are shipped to Kinshasa, where
they are either processed in its sawmill or go
on for export to Europe.) However, this bay
was well known to be an important breeding
ground for various fish populations. Since fish
stocks in the lake are already threatened by
overfishing, the loss of this area will create
further pressure. With local people relying on
fish for 90% of their protein,142 this has the
potential for serious social as well as
environmental consequences, which could
have been avoided. Even in the absence of
proper land use planning, local consultation
and the development of a properly constituted
and enforced management plan prior to the
commencement of logging would have helped
ensure that the resources upon which the
local population depended were protected.

Timber from ITB is imported into European
countries including Belgium, France, Italy and
Portugal. Interholco (Danzer’s trading branch)
is a client of ITB.143

reforms the World Bank imposed on Cameroon
in the mid-1990s. As the example of
Cameroon shows, industrial logging and the
wealth it creates do not improve the quality of
life of ordinary people when operating within a
corrupt political context. All of the signs for
the DRC are equally ominous.

Thanks to the failure to implement and/or
enforce its key social and environmental
provisions, the Forestry Code promises to do
more to hand control of the country’s forests
to the industrial logging industry, than to
promote those forests as a source of
sustainable livelihood for the majority of the
DRC’s people or as an area requiring
preservation for reasons of biodiversity or
climate protection. Genuine development and
environmental protection are likely to be the
casualties, not the beneficiaries of ‘reform’.

CARVING UP THE CONGO

UNIMPLEMENTED AND UNENFORCED,
THE 2002 FORESTRY CODE WILL NOT STOP
RAINFOREST PLUNDER OR CONTRIBUTE
TO POVERTY ALLEVIATION
Central to the World Bank’s reform strategy
for the DRC is the Forestry Code which it
imposed on the DRC Government. One of the
Bank’s key objectives has been to get industrial
logging to contribute to poverty alleviation
through the generation of state revenue.
Accordingly, the Code includes provision for
the redistribution of 40% of forest area tax
revenues to regional and local government
(25% to provinces and 15% to territoires –
article 122). It also makes compulsory the
direct negotiation between logging companies
and communities adjacent to their operations
of ‘social responsibility contracts’ (cahiers des
charges) (article 89); and introduces a
requirement for a forest management plan
(articles 71, 99, 100), covering among other
things the protection of biodiversity in
production areas. It also calls for ultimate
designation of at least 15% of the
country’s total surface area as classified
(ie protected) forest.

Five years on, some of the key reforms set out
in the Forestry Code remain unimplemented
(for example land use planning see pp58–63).
Of those aspects that have come into effect,
the new forestry tax regime has yet to deliver
any money whatsoever for local social
projects, and measures designed to ensure
that communities benefit from logging
(eg community consultation and social
responsibility contracts) have been
implemented in a derisory manner or not at all.
