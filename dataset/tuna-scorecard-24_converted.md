4  HIGH COST OF CHEAP TUNA 3RD EDITION

Introduction

In Greenpeace USA’s third scorecard measuring the human rights and sustainability practices of

16 major US supermarkets’ tuna supply chains, only two retailers achieved a passing score.

Since the last report, there are signs of progress and improvements for some retailers, though

there is still a significant and concerning gap between where these retailers’ human rights and

sustainability practices and policies are and where they need to be to effectively address these

critical issues.

This  year’s  scorecard  shows  year-on-year  growth,  with
now  two  major  retailers,  Aldi  and  Hy-Vee,  achieving  a
passing grade and several others following closely behind.
These developments show that retailers are increasingly
taking  responsibility  for  their  entire  tuna  supply  chain,
from fishing to the products they offer to consumers.

Nonetheless,  much  remains  to  be  done.  As  well  as
recognizing progress where made, this report lays out the
worst performing retailers. Retailers must adopt policies
that  reflect  what  science  and  justice  demand,  or  bear
the  consequences  as  consumers  make  more  informed
choices to spend their money elsewhere.

The United States is one of the world’s largest consumer
tuna  markets.1  Accounting  for  a  significant  portion  of
the  $40  billion  USD  global  industry,2,3  US  retailers  have
the  economic  power  to  shape  and  shift  the  global  tuna
industry through business practice, sourcing, and global
advocacy efforts. They play a key role in determining the
human rights outcomes of tens of thousands of workers
across the global tuna supply chain.

In the period since the publication of the second edition
of the High Cost of Cheap Tuna in 2023, there have been
numerous  investigations  and  reports  that  revealed  the
ongoing issues in the supply chain of seafood that ends
up  on  US  shelves  and  plates.  There  are  approximately
128,000  fishers  ensnared  in
forced  labor4,  fishers  who
may  be  stranded  at  sea  for
months or even over a year
at  a  time.  They  are  isolated
from  their  families,  with  no
way to alert anyone to their
situation  while  at  sea,  and
largely  hidden  from  sight.
There  is  often  an  overlap
between labor rights abuses
illegal,  unregulated
and
and
(IUU)
unreported
fishing  activities.  Together,
these  linked  issues  serve  to
perpetuate  the  depletion
of  tuna  stocks,  bycatch  of
marine  life  caught  on  tuna
lines, and suffering of fishers
subject  to  labor  abuses  on
board.

Since 2008, Greenpeace USA has periodically invited retailers to complete a survey on their

policies regarding the sourcing and marketing of tuna and tuna products sold in their stores; we

have then graded those responses and compiled them in a report. Prior to 2021, the survey’s

questions focused exclusively on retailers’ environmental and sustainability policies; last year, the

questionnaire expanded to incorporate policies on human rights and labor protections. For 2024,

the survey adds two non-point questions to provide more context.

This year’s survey contains 39 questions with points across six categories addressing the following issues:

1. Tuna Procurement Policy
(20%)
Do
the
retailers  have  official  policies  governing
procurement  of  their  tuna  that  cover  environmental
and human rights issues? For example, do they only buy
tuna from suppliers that recruit workers through formal
channels  that  do  not  charge  them  recruiting  fees?  Are
those  workers  guaranteed  a  local  living  wage?  What
policies  do  they  have  in  place  to  ensure  the  safety  and
well-being  of  workers  on  their  suppliers’  tuna  vessels?
What is their policy on procuring tuna from vessels that
engage  in  transshipment  at  sea?  Do  they  buy  any  tuna
from  “red”  or  “yellow”-listed  fisheries?  Is  all  their  tuna
Marine  Stewardship  Council  certified  or  from  a  Fishery
Improvement  Program?  This  section  does  not  address
the practical steps being made to enforce these policies,
merely whether such policies in fact exist.

2. Traceability (20%)
Can  retailers  trace  all  their  tuna  back  to  the  individual
vessel that caught it? Will they commit to making lists of
those  vessels  public?  How  can  retailers  guarantee  that
their  suppliers  are  providing  the  tuna  they  say  they  are
and that that tuna is caught in the manner and under the
conditions their suppliers claim? If so, how?

3. Advocacy and Initiatives
(10%)
Do  retailers  publicly  advocate  for  fisheries  reform,
improved  management,  and  stronger  guarantees  of
workers’ human and labor rights? If so, how? Do they add
their name to group letters sent to fisheries organizations
or  do  they  involve  themselves  in  discussions  with
individual  governments  or  relevant  United  Nations
agencies?  Do  they  source  their  tuna  from  vessels  with
democratic and independent trade unions?

4. Human Rights and Labor
Protections (25%)
What  due  diligence  do  retailers  pursue  to  ensure  that
suppliers are meeting their commitments to human rights
and labor protections? Do they have senior staff assigned
to follow these issues? Do they have systems in place to
regularly identify human rights risks and impacts? What
kind  of  grievance  and  remediation  mechanisms  are
available  to  workers?  How  do  they  deal  with  suppliers
when and if abuses are discovered?

5. Current Sourcing (20%)
Do  retailers  stock  any  tuna  of  threatened  species,  from
problematic fisheries, or from brands that have a history
of  using  either  of  the  above?  What  is  the  percentage  of
their tuna that is caught by various sustainable and less
sustainable  methods?  To  what  extent  do  they  consider
how  their  purchasing  practices  might  affect  the  human
and labor rights of workers in the supply chain?

6. Customer Education and
Labeling (5%)
What information do they provide to enable consumers to
make informed choices?

Each question was assigned a maximum point value, and
responses were scored accordingly. The score totals were
aggregated, and each section was weighted to provide a
final percentage score.

In  addition,  every  question  (across  all  categories)  was
also  classified  as  pertaining  either  to  environmental
issues, human rights issues, or both. For instance, some
questions  in  the  tuna  procurement  policy  category
related  to  environmental  sustainability  policies,  others
to  human  rights  policies,  and  some,  such  as  those
pertaining to companies’ stands on transshipment, were
classified  as  pertaining  to  both.  As  a  result,  in  addition

to  the  final  percentage  score,  each  retailer  received  an
overall environmental score (marked as “ENVIRO” in the
scorecard), and an overall human rights score (marked as
“HR”  in  the  scorecard).  The  full  survey  that  was  sent  to
retailers can be found in the Appendix.

We  recognize  that  human  and
labor  rights  and
environmental  policy  are  complex  and  evolving  fields
that  encompass  a  broad  range  of  issues  —  including
domestic and global politics, socioeconomics, migration,
climate change, and resource management — and impact
a  wide  spectrum  of  actors,  from  small  business  owners
and corporations to migrant fishers, seafood processors
and western consumers. We recognize also that there is
always  subjectivity  involved  in  policy  decisions  and  the
assessment  of  those  decisions.  With  this  in  mind,  we
have  striven  to  be  fair  and,  where  appropriate,  to  give
companies  the  benefit  of  the  doubt,  particularly  where
clear  effort  and  engagement  has  been  made  and  signs
of  progress  are  evident.  To  this  end,  Greenpeace  USA’s
goal is not to expose and shame; rather, it remains, as it
has  been  since  Day  One,  to  highlight,  for  both  retailers
and customers, the problems with existing supply chain
policies, as well as the solutions to correct them.

When  it  comes  to  the  responsiveness  of  companies,
this year 9 of 16 companies responded to our questions
—  Ahold  Delhaize  USA,  Albertsons,  Aldi,  Giant  Eagle,
Hy-Vee,  The  Kroger  Company,  Sprouts  Farmers  Market,
Target, and Whole Foods — provided detailed responses
to our questionnaire. We have taken the answers of these
responsive  companies  in  good  faith  and  not  sought  to
rigorously verify statements or claims made in response.
Policies and their contents were verified — but verifying
detailed, supply chain information is beyond the scope of
this  report.  The  “non-responsive  companies”  —  Costco,
HEB, Publix, Walmart, Trader Joe’s, Meijer, and Wegmans
— elected not to complete a survey. We therefore scored
them  on  publicly  available  policies  and  statements,
online inventory searches, working
group  membership,  and  other
factors.  The  accuracy  and  detail
of  those  assessments  can  best  be
refined  in  future  versions  of  this
report through greater cooperation
and  responsiveness  on  the  part  of
those retailers.

Two retailers received passing scores
This year, Aldi retained its top rank with a score of 71%,
earning a C grade – an improvement of 9% from its D rating
in 2023. With improvements over the past year in both its
Human Rights and Environmental scores, this progress is
certainly welcome, but there remains considerable room
for further improvement.

Hy-Vee, which ranked fourth in last year’s scorecard with
a mark of 50%, showed improvement across the board to
earn a score of 60%, joining Aldi as one of only two retailers
to receive a passing grade. This progress is largely due to
Hy-Vee’s increased emphasis on supply chain traceability
and product chain of custody.

Among the middle-performing cohort (35%-59%), there is
a  general  improvement  in  scores,  which  is  encouraging.
Target,  Whole  Foods,  Sprouts,  and  Albertsons  all
substantially  increased  their  scores  or  made  minor
in  their  policies.  Target
but  still  notable  changes
improvement  between
demonstrated  considerable
successive  scorecards,  showing  a  willingness  to  adapt
and  modernize  its  approaches  to  tuna  supply  chains  in
the areas of worker rights and sustainability. Whole Foods
was  also  a  top  performer  in  this  category  of  retailers,
increasing its score by 8 percentage points, leaving it just
short of joining Aldi and Hy-Vee in the passing group.

Changes since the last scorecard
Although  the  overall  range  of  scores  may  not  seem
promising  at  first  glance,  a  comparison  with  past
scorecards reveals a consistent trend of improvement for
the majority of retailers. Notable progress has been made
by  Aldi,  Target,  Hy-Vee,  and  Whole  Foods,  while  others
showed more modest gains. This upward trend indicates
a  shift  towards  responsible,  ethical,  and  sustainable
business  practices,  and  a  greater  focus  on  preserving
ocean health.

Since  Greenpeace  USA  began  surveying  companies  on
their sustainable sourcing policies over a decade ago, there
has  been  wider  adoption-or  at  least  acknowledgement-
of  key  policies  such  as  phasing  out  transshipment  at
sea,  Fisheries  Improvement  Projects  (FIPs),  and  fishing
methods  that  reduce  bycatch.  Recently,  the  importance
of providing free, accessible, and private Wi-Fi on board
has  gained  mainstream  recognition.  This  connectivity
is crucial for fishers to communicate not only with their
families and friends but also with unions and authorities
while at sea for extended periods.

Overall,  there  is  some  movement  towards  integrating
human and labor rights into retailer supplier policies. This
shift  is  essential  to  address  the  realities  and  challenges
along  the  tuna  supply  chain,  from  the  recruitment  of
fishers and conditions on board ships to processing plants
across the globe. As retailers profit from goods like tuna,
they  also  bear  responsibility  for  what  takes  place  along
the entire supply chain before these products reach their
shelves or seafood sections. This growing awareness and
accountability  are  promising  for  both  the  environment
and  workers.  However,  these  efforts  must  continue  and
accelerate to address these pressing issues effectively.

While  these  retailers  have  policies  that  mention  human
rights  and  sustainability,  they  lack  measurable  time-
bound  plans  for  improvement  or  for  alignment  with
internationally recognized frameworks such as the United
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Additionally, most rely heavily on third-party or supplier-
led initiatives for social, product, and transparency audits.
This  approach  is  not  an  effective  substitute  for  direct
engagement with workers across their supply chains and
does  not  adequately  address  the  implementation  and
monitoring of grievance and remediation mechanisms for
affected workers.

The Worst Performers
This year, half of all retailers scored 35% or lower. Among
them are Trader Joe’s (12%), Meijer (18%), Publix (21%),
Wegmans  (21%),  HEB  (26%),  Kroger  (27%),  and  Costco
(29%)  and  Giant  (29%).  As  with  last  year,  every  retailer
scored  worse  on  human  rights  than  on  environmental
and sustainability policies.

Despite  years  of  guidance  from  international  bodies,
academic  and  NGO  research,  shocking  media  exposés,
and  increasing  consumer  awareness,  many  businesses
are still failing to act on their responsibilities. Others have
made  promises  or  set  goals  without  attaching  timelines
or implementing tangible practices for their realization.

FINDINGS
The good

Almost Every Retailer Has Some Kind of Policy
in Place

For  sustainable  seafood  or  tuna  policies,  a  number
of  retailers  explicitly  feature  not  sourcing  from  “red”
fisheries according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium or from
any  company  that  engages  in  shark  finning.  It  is  worth
noting that trade in shark fins is illegal in the USA,5 but not
in  all  countries.  As  such,  it  is  important  that  companies
do take the measures to not source from companies that
engage in shark finning to limit this destructive practice.
Though  only  three  (Hy-Vee,  Giant  Eagle,  and  Sprouts)
included  language  in  support  of  marine  reserves  and
marine protected areas.

In terms of human rights, all retailers surveyed apart from
Trader Joe’s have a standalone human rights/labor policy
that covers all of their tuna procurement. Having a policy
is a key first step, but it is a first step.

Our Asks: We ask that supermarkets have a
sustainable/responsible seafood sourcing policy
and a standalone human rights/labor policy that
covers 100% of tuna procured across all categories
(fresh, frozen and shelf-stable) and sold in all stores.
For more information, see Q1-6 in the Appendix.

Many Retailers Are Able to Trace Tuna

Aldi,  Giant  Eagle,  HEB,  Publix,  Sprouts,  Wegmans  and
Target state in their response or on their publicly accessible
information that they are able to trace every shop keeping
unit (SKU) of tuna on their shelves. While encouraging to
see Target increase its coverage of tuna that they can trace,
it was disappointing to see Ahold Delhaize USA and Giant
Eagle  go  from  100%  of  their  SKU  tuna  being  traceable  in
the last scorecard to between 90% and 99%. Whole Foods
now also sits in this bracket, with canned tuna being fully
traceable but this not extending to other types.

For  full  traceability,  Hy-Vee  remains  the  only  retailer  to
commit  to  publishing  and  then  to  actually  publish  its
full vessel list. This is a commendable measure that goes
beyond  simple  promises  of  transparency  for  consumers
and  does  more  to  deliver  it.  That  Hy-Vee  continues  to
publish  its  list  shows  once  again  that  it  is  possible  for
retailers to take this step if they decide to.

Our Asks: We ask that supermarkets are able to
trace 100% of tuna (fresh, frozen and shelf-stable)
down to the individual vessel that caught the fish
and that they commit to publicly publish a list of
those vessels. For more information, see Q15-16 in
the Appendix.

The bad

Little Human Rights Due Diligence to Ensure
Policies Are Adhered To

There  remains  a  significant  lack  of  progress  in  the
area  of  human  rights  due  diligence,  with  a  continued
overreliance  on  third-parties  or  social  audits.  On  human
rights due diligence processes, there was a clear group of
the  retailers  who  have  such  a  process,  which  is  aligned
with  the  UN  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human
Rights  (UNGPs),  like  Ahold  Delhaize  USA,  Aldi,  Hy-Vee,
Kroger,  Target,  and  Whole  Food;  even  Albertsons  which
implements  a  due  diligence  framework  to  complement
social  audits  for  over  75%  of  its  tuna  suppliers.  And  the
rest  had  nothing  in  the  way  of  a  UNGP-aligned  human
rights due diligence process.

Our Asks: We ask that retailers move beyond third
party audits and instead institute comprehensive
human rights due diligence processes that cover
100% of their supply chain and that align with the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for
how they address their negative impacts on human
or labor rights. These processes must involve
meaningful engagement with workers in their
design, implementation, and governance. For more
information, see Q22-33 of the Appendix.

International Standards Not Being Upheld

For workers’ contracts, none of the retailers were able to
provide  in  their  response  or  publish  on  their  own  sites
examples  of  contracts  that  comply  with  ILO  core  labor
standards and ILO Convention No. 188 across all of their
tuna  suppliers.  Though  Aldi  and  Sprouts  do  apply  this
for  some  of  their  suppliers.  Others  assert  that  contracts
are written in a language that the worker understands, a
reasonable expectation for any contract.

Only  Aldi  and  Hy-Vee  make  explicit  commitments  to
the  International  Bill  of  Human  Rights,  the  ILO  Core
Conventions, and the C188 - Work in Fishing Convention.
While  Aldi  also  includes  a  commitment  to  uphold  the
UNGPs. That more progress has not been made to ensure
that  supplier  practices  and  tuna  sourcing  catch  up  to
these international standards is disappointing.

Our Asks: Retailers must preferentially source
tuna from vessels that use Port States that have
ratified and implemented the ILO Work in Fishing
Convention and that effectively conduct labor
inspections under the provisions of the convention;
and/or from companies with independent,
democratic trade unions and that respect their
workers’ rights to collectively bargain and engage
in union activities. For more information, see Q7 of the
Appendix.

Lack of Workers’ Voice and Grievance Mechanisms

Few Limits on Transshipment at Sea

Only  one  retailer,  Ahold  Delhaize  USA,  currently  has
a  policy  to  offer  a  safe  and  anonymous  mechanism
through which workers can raise complaints or concerns
regarding human rights issues, ensuring  that  all of their
tuna suppliers publicly disclose online and in all of their
labor contracts the procedures for their employees to file
grievances that are secure, anonymous, and confidential,
free from threat of retaliation. Plus ensuring that there is
a  protected  avenue  for  workers  to  take  their  complaint
to  the  level  of  the  retailer  themselves  if  the  issue  is  not
adequately dealt with by the supplier itself.

Additionally,  no  retailers  were  able  to  show  that  they
source  any  real  percentage  of  tuna  from  vessels  with
democratic and independent trade unions.

Our Asks: We ask that retailers ensure that workers
have access to secure, anonymous, confidential,
and independent complaints mechanisms with
strong protections against retaliation. While an
effective grievance mechanism must be in place at
the level of the supplier, a means must also exist
by which workers or their representatives can
take a complaint up to the level of the buyer, if not
resolved by the supplier. For more information, see
Q28-29 in the Appendix.

Transshipment  at  sea  —  in  which  fish  or  marine  wildlife
is  transferred  from  one  vessel  to  another,  enabling  the
fishing vessel to stay out at sea longer — is a major issue in
global commercial fisheries. This is a practice that allows
fishing vessels to remain at sea for months or even years,
and which is linked to both forced labor risk and Illegal,
Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing.

Ahold  Delhaize  USA,  Aldi,  Albertsons,  Giant  Eagle,  Hy-
Vee, Sprouts and Target claim to allow transshipment at
sea  only  when  there  is  100  percent  observer  coverage.
What we see in reality is that observer coverage remains
extremely  low.  While  there  are  nascent  endeavors  to
enhance  this  with  electronic  monitoring  in  the  form
of  video  surveillance  such  as  that  seen  in  the  Tuna
Transparency  Pledge,  more  needs  to  be  tested  and  the
issue  of  human  and  labor  rights  abuses  remains  largely
unaddressed.  This  policy,  at  the  very  least,  is  to  some
extent better than having no policy on transshipment at
all, which is the case for virtually every other retailer.

Our Asks: We ask that retailers commit to
completely phasing out buying fish from companies
that allow transshipment. For more information, see
Q8 of the Appendix.

Conclusion

©  Paul Hilton / Greenpeace

The road to actual accountability and real sustainability
is often  paved with good intentions and  promises to do
better. For the retailers in this survey, sustainability and
human  rights  policies  are  often  based  on  notions  that
in  3  or  5  years,  their  business  practices  will  align  with
industry  best-practices.  However,  with  the  depletion  of
ocean  life  and  the  suffering  of  workers  happening  now,
these  extended  timelines  are  simply  not  addressing  the
issues with the urgency that science and justice demand.
Retailers  must  not  only  strive  to  emulate  current  best-
practices  promptly  but  also  proactively  engage  with
domestic  and  international  governments  and  bodies  to
advocate for stronger labor protections and sustainability
in the global tuna sector.

The scorecard results reveal many signs of improvement
in the retailer tuna supply chain.  Comparing the current
scores  of  14  retailers  to  their  previous  years  shows  a
discernible trend of improvement, with only two retailers’
scores declining. Among the top performing retailers, the
trend  of  improvement  is  even  more  pronounced.  With
Aldi, Target, Hy-Vee, and Whole Foods making significant
scoring  gains  this  year,  there  are  now  two  retailers  that
have  passed  Greenpeace  USA’s  rigorous  tuna  scorecard
and two others that are close.

It  is  encouraging  to  note  that  most  retailers  have  made
some efforts to improve their tuna supply chains by creat-
ing policies that consider human rights and environmen-
tal concerns to a greater or and lesser extent in their tuna
procurement policies. However, for many retailers, their
dedication to addressing these issues does not extend be-
yond publishing such policies. Many fail to communicate
if or how they have made measurable time-bound prog-
ress towards developing and implementing due diligence
frameworks  that  align-even  in  part-with  the  United  Na-
tions Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Moreover,  regarding  social,  product,  and  transparency
audits,  many  retailers  remain  entirely  reliant  on  the
outcomes  of  third-party  or  supplier-led
initiatives.
This  suboptimal  approach  allows  some  suppliers  to
act  with  impunity  and  at  their  own  discretion  while
pacifying retailers by appearing to take remedial action.
Additionally,  this  complete  lack  of  direct  engagement
with workers throughout supply chains leaves many of the
retailers included in this report powerless to implement
or monitor grievance and remediation mechanisms that
ensure safety and anonymity for workers. The continued
lack of policy clarity, and strategic opacity that is apparent
across  many  of  the  retailer’s  human  rights  policies  only
serves  to  placate
impressionable  consumers  while
imperiling the broader fishers labor rights movement.

Retailers  can  and  should  take  steps  such  as  increasing
advocacy  efforts  at  domestic  and  international  policy
level, advocating for the UN Oceans Treaty, working with
suppliers and local government agencies to ensure better
protections  for  source-country  workers,  and  adding
better in-store customer education materials and package
labeling to help consumers make informed purchases.

Smaller  retailers  have  often  spearheaded  crucial  initia-
tives left unaddressed by larger corporate conglomerates.
However, larger retailers like Costco, Walmart, Albertsons,
and  Kroger,  with  their  significant  market  power,  have  a
considerable  opportunity  to  drive  substantial  progress
and  position  themselves  as  leaders  in  the  sustainability
and labor rights movement. Greenpeace USA urges these
larger  retailers  to  move  beyond  making  promises  and
take  more  concrete  steps  to  influence  broad  change  in
the industry.

For the third year running, Aldi placed first overall amongst all other retailers. In this edition, Aldi saw an impressive increase in year on year
scoring (9%). This increase can be attributed to Aldi’s increased performance across the Traceability, Human Rights and Labor Protections,
and  Current  Sourcing  categories.  On  Traceability,  Aldi’s  practice  of  conducting  product  traceability  exercises  at  production  facilities,
random product checks, as well as supplementing third-party traceability audits in order to address and combat fish fraud was notable.

Not only is Aldi able to score points in most categories due to the substance of its policies, but for a large part, Aldi continues to be
successful each year due to the public communication of the work it does, and the frameworks it adheres to. In its policy Aldi mentioned
that it preferential sources from tuna suppliers that source from Fish Aggregating Devices-free (FAD-free) purse seine vessels, and longline
fishing vessels that utilize best practices to mitigate bycatch.6 Bycatch minimization strategies like this are enforced by Aldi as it works
towards having bycatch-free supply chains by 2030.7

On Human Rights and Labor Protections, Aldi’s improved score is reflected by its efforts to further maintain its due diligence program
alongside  its  Corporate  Responsibility  Supplier  Evaluation  (CRSE)  program.8  Aldi’s  commitment  to  upholding  various  internationally-
recognized human rights instruments, as well as fundamental rights at work across all activities in its supply chain, including the UNGPs,
is noteworthy.9

PROS:  Aldi  should  also  be  commended  for  being  the  only  retailer  on  this  scorecard  to
actively  advocate  for  a  living  wage  for  the  workers  in  its  supply  chains  and,  for  including
explicit  mention  of  the  need  for  documentation  of  worker  payments  from  its  suppliers.10
Additionally on worker rights, Aldi’s Business Partner Sustainability Standards outline that
its  business  partners  must  respect  workers  rights  to  freedom  of  association,  collective
bargaining, and their right to elect representatives to form or join trade unions.11

With respect to worker recruitment across  supply  chains, in its  International  Policy  on
Forced Labor, Aldi maintains that the terms of all worker contracts must be clear, transparent,
and set forth in a language that the worker fully understands. Moreover, in an effort to reduce
modern  slavery  and  indentured  labor,  Aldi  abides  by  an  ‘Employer  Pays  Principle’,  which
stipulates that only legally licensed recruitment agencies may be used to recruit workers,
and that any costs borne from recruitment must be shouldered by the employer, and not by
a prospective employee.12

In  the  Tuna  Procurement  Policy  section,  Aldi  scored  well  for  having  comprehensive,
publicly available seafood and human rights policies. Additionally, Aldi picked up points for
those policies making specific reference to various internationally-recognized human rights
instruments,13  and  for  providing  considerate  detail  regarding  the  various  sustainability
pledges, initiatives, and organizations that Aldi is a party to in respect to its tuna sourcing.14
Moreover,  among  the  numerous  positive  standouts  across  Aldi’s  swath  of  policies
applicable  to  its  scoring  in  this  report,  Aldi’s  alignment  with  and  commitment  to  the
aforementioned  internationally  recognized  instruments  set  them  apart  from  the  vast
majority  of  other  retailers.  For  example,  Aldi’s  International  Forced  Labor  Policy,  which
explicitly  covers  all  stages  of  its  supply  chain,  is  guided  by  a  number  of  international
standards including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and numerous
International  Labor  Organization  conventions  too.15,16  In  this  sense,  Aldi  truly  sets  a  best-
practice standard in this domain; a standard that many other retailers could adopt.

Additionally,  it  is  commendable  that  Aldi  has  implemented  an  annual  Corporate
Responsibility  Supplier  Evaluation  (CSRE)  program,  that  it  conducts  in  a  positive  manner
with  its  suppliers  in  order  to  support  long-term  relationships  with  them.  For  those  who
demonstrate a strong commitment to continuous improvement Aldi prioritizes allocating a
majority of its supply-side business to these suppliers.17

CONS:  While  Aldi’s  recognition  of
grievance  mechanisms  is  present,
it  does  rely  heavily  on  third
party  organizations.  These  third
party  organizations  cannot  be
substituted for a robust internally-
developed framework.

With  respect  to  transshipment,
despite  Aldi  mandating  100%
observer  coverage  in  all  instances
where  this  practice  takes  place,  it
is  nonetheless  discouraging  that
Aldi  continues  to  allow  it.  Many
difficult  to  mitigate  human  rights
and environmental issues continue
to  be  associated  with  the  practice
of  transshipment;  and,  given  the
historical  attention  this  issue  has
received  from  rights  groups  it  is
imperative  that  retailers  like  Aldi
develop  an  explicit  standalone
transshipment  policy  or  stance.
That  being
said,  Aldi  does
deserve  recognition  for  its  ‘ALDI
Sustainability Assessments (ASAs)’,
retailer  conducts
wherein
traceback  exercises  with
the
express  purpose  of  linking  Aldi
products with their sources.

In this edition of the scorecard, Whole Foods was able to add 8 percentage points to its overall score in comparison to last year’s report.

In Whole Foods’ update of their retailer’s Supplier Code of Conduct (2023),18 it is encouraging to see explicit language used that requires
worker’s contracts to be provided in clear, understandable language, and delivered in a manner understood by the worker.19 Additionally,
Whole Foods is among a handful of retailers to have implemented a sufficient human rights due diligence process that applies to all of the
tuna suppliers in its supply chain and aligns with the UNGPs.20

However, despite Whole Foods’ Sustainability Report and Supplier Code of Conduct making reference to various International human
rights instruments, such as the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Core Conventions, the UNGPs, and the International Bill of Human
Rights, the retailer’s two key documents omit any mention of the ILO’s C188 Work in Fishing Convention, an essential commitment for any
retailer dedicated to a thorough due diligence standard.

Consistent with previous years, Whole Foods has continued to score highly across most environmental categories. As such, this year, Whole
Foods came second overall on this area, behind only Aldi. On its Customer Labeling, Whole Foods is more transparent with its customer base.
Whole Foods deserves commendation for its engagement and citation of relevant materials published through various not-for-profit
channels. In its survey, Whole Foods cited one of Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s reports, Forced Labor at Sea (2019 and 2021),21 as a key
source for review in determining whether companies or vessels associated with labor risks were part of its tuna supply chains. In light of
similar reports, and the pervasiveness of human rights risks across many tuna supply chains, Whole Foods has committed to conduct a
saliency assessment this year to aid in identifying any key human rights risks connected to its business. It should be noted however, that
no additional points were awarded to Whole Foods this year for providing this information.

PROS:  This  year,  Whole  Foods  scored  markedly  better  across
the  Human  Rights  and  Labor  Protections  section  of  the
survey.  While  nearly  all  retailers  had  some  form  of  policy  in
place, few of those policies contained such a high level of detail
or made robust reference to international instruments. Whole
Foods  also  deserves  commendation  for  including  language
in  its  policies  that  regard  worker  voice,  engagement,  and
remediation  mechanisms.  Additionally,  this  year  it  appears
as  though  Whole  Foods  has  implemented  more  thorough
assessments  of  the  potential  for  human  rights  risks  across  its
supply chains; and, as mentioned above, has even committed
to  conduct  a  saliency  assessment  to  identify  any  unknown
human rights risks connected to its business.

With  respect  to  Current  Sourcing,  Whole  Foods  stipulates
that all of its canned tuna must be sourced from pole and line,
troll, and handline fisheries that use an industry-leading ‘one-
by-one’  catch  method.22  Additionally,  the  source  fishery  must
either be MSC certified or be rated green or yellow by Monterey
Bay Aquarium (MBA)’s Seafood Watch fisheries tracker.23 On this
note, although unrelated to any scoring rubric, Whole Foods is
a  signatory  on  the  Bali  Declaration  in  support  of  one-by-one
fisheries in Indonesia.

On Traceability, Whole Foods can boast an industry-leading
approach  that  requires  every  tuna  supplier  to  use  electronic
tracing  software  that  tracks  each  catch  of  tuna  at  every  point
across the supply chain, from vessel to can.24

CONS: The most significant shortfall across all of Whole Foods
policies  is  the  absence  of  a  currently  operable  grievance
mechanism. And, despite there being some processes in place
for  communicating  how  the  retailer  addresses  human  rights,
these processes are not fully aligned with the UNGPs on Business
and Human Rights. One core attribute of a safe, anonymous, and
accessible  due  diligence  mechanism  is  that  those  who  access
and use it must not be exposed to any consequent risks. And,
although  Whole  Foods  is  confident  in  the  safety  of  its  current
mechanism, these deliverables cannot be guaranteed.

That being said, Whole Foods has advised that this year it is pi-
loting a grievance mechanism project for seafood industry work-
ers in Thailand in collaboration with the Issara Institute. Further,
it commits that the insights and results of this trial will support
the ongoing development of its human rights due diligence pro-
cesses.  Moreover,  Whole  Foods  has  committed  to  building  the
public reporting and communication capacity regarding poten-
tial human rights risks involved in its supply chains.

On  Current  Sourcing,  this  year  Whole  Foods  scored  less
well  reflecting  the  introduction  of  products  utilizing  less
environmentally-friendly catch-methods. Last year the retailer
only  sourced  tuna  that  had  been  caught  via  pole  and  line  or
troll  and  handline  methods,  the  two  most  widely  recognised
sustainable  methods.  However,  this  year,  it  seems  the  retailer
has  begun  stocking  tuna  products  caught  via  longlines  and
longlines with bycatch mitigation devices.

This year, Ahold Delhaize USA dropped a percentage point due to a slight decrease in traceability. This was due to the retailer no longer
being able to trace every SKU of tuna down to the vessel level; something that they claim to have been able to do in previous years.

In  other  areas  related  to  traceability,  however,  Ahold  was  able  to  score  rather  well.  Additionally,  to  combat  IUU,  Ahold  mandates
that tuna suppliers must be able to provide evidence that they are purchasing from legal fishing vessels. On this front, Ahold deserves
commendation for its continued monitoring and identification of environmental and human rights risks across its supply chains.

In the previous edition of this report, Greenpeace USA recognized the strength, depth, and transparency of Ahold’s 2022 Human Rights
Report;25 primarily because Ahold is among only a handful of retailers to make reference to international human rights instruments, and
express concern for migrant workers in its supply chains.26

Ahold does well in Advocacy and Initiatives, sending more letters to key policy makers in support of labor reform in the tuna and

fisheries sectors than any other retailer has.

As part of Ahold’s Code of Ethics, it has implemented an access to remedy process that plays both an integral and effective part in its
human rights due diligence framework. A key part of this framework is the company’s “Speak Up Line”, a free and accessible local ethics
helpline that is accessible 24/7 in the local languages of all countries in which Ahold operates.27

Ahold also deserves recognition for its work to incorporate the UNGPs on Business and Human Rights across all of the brands and stores
associated with the Ahold Delhaize family.28 However, with reference to tuna supply chains, more work could be done to implement the
International Labor Organisation’s Work in Fishing Convention (C188), of which there is no mention within Ahold’s policies.

PROS:  As  mentioned  in  previous  years,  Ahold’s  2021  Human
Rights Report proved to be a positive step in the right direction;
and the follow up to this report, released in 2022, further built
upon Ahold’s commitment towards improving its approach to
human rights across its supply chain.29 In line with this, Ahold
formally communicates its human rights due diligence process
via this report as well as through standalone policies; and, this
process aligns with the UNGPs.

In  the  Tuna  Procurement  Policy  section,  Ahold  remains
one of the only companies to express an explicit commitment
to  collective  bargaining  rights  and  a  freedom  of  association
for  workers  across  its  supply  chains.30  This  issue  has  come  to
the forefront across various seafood industries in recent years,
as  many  workers  seek  to  unionize.  In  the  Human  Rights  and
Labor Protections section, Ahold’s human rights due diligence
process remains considerably more modern and detailed than
many other retailers, a few of which have no related standalone
policies at all.

CONS: Overwhelmingly Ahold’s scores related to catch methods
in  the  Current  Sourcing  section  leave  much  to  be  desired.  In
comparison to previous years, the share of tuna sourced from
pole  and  line,  troll,  and  handline  has  decreased  substantially
while  sourcing  from  purse  seine  (with  the  use  of  FADs)  and
longlines  without  bycatch  mitigation  measures  has  gone  up
dramatically. These more destructive and less targeted methods
of fishing remain a persistent threat to wild marine life.

Ahold  has  made  considerable  strides  in  recent  years  to
add thorough and considered policies that function to protect
workers along its supply chain, and an implementation of either
or  both  of  these  suggestions  would  further  strengthen  the
company’s already strong human rights policies.

This year, Albertsons was only able to add an additional 3 percentage points to its previous score. Largely these extra points were awarded
due to the retailer building on its previous efforts to ensure the well-being and safety of at-sea tuna vessel workers.

Albertsons began to consult and engage with workers along its supply chains during impact risk assessments, improving its scoring in
the Human Rights and Labor Protections section for beginning. Although this is a welcome step in the right direction, Greenpeace USA
encourages Albertsons to develop this process further and not rely on third party audits.

Greenpeace USA also recognizes that over successive years, Albertsons has made improvements in data collection and is able to provide
data on shelf-stable tuna in addition to fresh and frozen. As such, on traceability the retailer scored quite well for conducting its own audits
and for having implemented a traceability and verification system that is able to trace tuna to the vessel level - thus bolstering efforts to
combat fish fraud.

Additionally of note, in April of this year Albertsons signed on to The Nature Conservancy’s Tuna Transparency Pledge, which aims to
advance on-the-water monitoring to 100% of all industrial tuna fishing vessels within each signatory’s supply chain by 2027. The pledge
aims to drastically curb IUU, and reduce bycatch and the killing of endangered, threatened and protected species.31 It should be noted
however, that the signing of this pledge has not meant the allocation of any additional points to Albertsons this year as none of the goals
or initiatives are yet realized.

PROS: It is commendable that Albertsons has a transshipment
policy  that  makes  reference  to  various  international  human
rights  instruments  related  to  vessel  and  crew  safety  and
worker protections, such as the Cape Town Agreement and the
ILO’s  Work  in  Fishing  Convention  (C188).32  Due  to  an  increase
in  communication  of  these  policies  and  how  they  protect
at-sea  workers,  Albertsons  was  able  to  pick  up  points  this
year  in  the  Tuna  Procurement  Policy  section  of  the  survey.
Unfortunately,  Albertsons’  policy  on  transshipment  does  not
include  any  explicit  language  that  signals  the  phasing  out  of
this  controversial  practice;  and,  instead  opts  for  guardrails
and  regulations  for  its  suppliers  that  continue  to  engage  in
transshipment.

As the largest US-based retailer to partner with Trace Register,
Albertsons  has  made  improvements  in  data  collection  and  is
able  to  provide  data  on  seafood  suppliers  down  to  a  specific
vessel level. During 2023, Albertsons and its seafood suppliers
undertook a major transition in an effort to collect data via newer
Trace Register software. On this front, Albertsons continues to
make  progress  on  its  traceability  commitments  through  the
implementation of its Due Diligence Plan for traceability; and,
in support of its efforts to combat IUU.33 As such, on traceability
the retailer scored quite well for conducting its own audits and
for  having  implemented  a  verification  system  that  is  able  to
trace tuna to the vessel level - thus bolstering efforts to combat
fish fraud.34

CONS:  Similar  to  other  middle-ranking  retailers,  Albertsons
scored  well  for  having  some  version  of  a  tuna  procurement
policy in place, but missed out on many points for not making
specific  reference  to  various  human  rights
instruments,
such  as  the  UN  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human
Rights  (UNGP)  and  ILO  Core  Conventions.  Moreover,  despite
mentioning the International Bill of Human Rights, and the ILO’s
C188 in different policies, there is little further mention of how
closely  Albertsons’  own  policies  align  with  these  instruments,
and  if  they  have  been  fully  implemented,  or  only  partially
adhered to.

Like  other  middle-scoring  retailers,  Albertsons  scored
rather  poorly  in  the  Current  Sourcing  section  of  the  survey
too. Despite requiring that its private-brand tuna products are
sourced from suppliers that are either Certified by the Marine
Stewardship Council or are from fisheries rated Green or Yellow
by  the  Monterey  Bay  Aquarium’s  Seafood  Watch  program,
Albertsons continues to stock other brands that are consistently
associated with environmental and human rights abuses, thus
putting  its  own  internal  efforts  towards  sustainability  and
adequate human rights protections at risk.

Additionally,  Albertsons  lost  points  for  continuing  to  allow
most  of  its  private-label  tuna  to  be  sourced  from  suppliers
with  more  indiscriminate  catch-methods,  such  as  purse-seine
and  longlines  without  by-catch  mitigation.  Shifting  towards
FAD-free  purse-seine  methods,  utilizing  by-catch  mitigation,
and preferencing tuna sourced from pole and line or handline
caught  suppliers  would  greatly  increase  Albertsons  scoring  in
this section.

Overall  in  this  year’s  edition  Giant  Eagle  scored  slightly  worse  than  last  year,  losing  percentage  points  due  to  backsliding  in  both  the
Traceability section and the Advocacy and Initiatives section of the survey too. Giant Eagle joins Ahold Delhaize USA as the only two
retailers on the scorecard to regress from their previous scoring.

Giant Eagle continues to perform poorly in the Current Sourcing section of the survey, opting to source from suppliers who utilize sub-
optimal catch-methods. Even despite the retailer being a core member of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership,35 which aims to reduce by-
catch and advocate for best-practice catch methods, Giant Eagle continues to source from suppliers utilizing FADs and longline methods
without bycatch mitigation devices.

With respect to fish fraud, an issue that is rampant across most tuna supply chains, Giant Eagle declined to answer any related questions.
As such, the retailer cannot guarantee that tuna canneries in its supply chain are able to ensure separation of brands, or that vessels in its
supply chains are able to guarantee product separation down to the fishing method. Irrespective of pledges signed or partnerships entered
into - if a company does not commit to traceability audits of its own tuna supply chains - they remain powerless to combat fish fraud.
Overall however, in the absence of more diligent policies, Giant Eagle’s general performance in this survey remains average at best.

PROS: On a promising note, Giant Eagle is aware of the many
issues  present  across  tuna  supply  chains,  and  communicates
its intentions to increasingly address these issues. For example,
Giant Eagle is among a handful of retailers that has a standalone
tuna policy,36 and has a sufficient Supplier Code of Conduct.37
It  has  also  recently  begun  working  with  the  World  Wildlife
Fund  and  Finance  Earth  in  supporting  an  anchovy  Fishery
Improvement Project (FIP) in Chile.38 Additionally, its work with
the  SFP  deserves  recognition,  and  its  inclusion  in  the  Ocean
Disclosure Project is commendable also.39

Despite unfortunately still allowing transshipment across its
supply chains, Giant Eagle explicitly commits to only allowing
transshipment-at-sea with 100 percent observer coverage.

Giant Eagle also has explicit language in support of sourcing
as  much  of  its  tuna  as  possible  from  suppliers  with  FIPs.
Additionally,  as  previously  mentioned  the  retailer  is  currently
in the early stages of supporting the work of an anchovy FIP in
Chile, and has committed to increasing its support of more FIPs
in the future.

CONS: Giant Eagle continues to perform poorly in the Current
Sourcing section of the survey, opting to source from suppliers
who  utilize  sub-optimal  catch-methods.  Even  despite  the
retailer  being  a  core  member  of  the  Sustainable  Fisheries
Partnership,40  which  aims  to  reduce  by-catch  and  advocate
for  best-practice  catch  methods,  Giant  Eagle  continues  to
source  from  suppliers  utilizing  FADs  and  longline  methods
without  bycatch  mitigation  devices.  Additionally,  Giant  Eagle
stocks  a  considerable  number  of  products  from  problematic
tuna  brands  that  have  been  historically  associated  with  poor
human  rights  and  sustainability  practices.  Stocking  anything
that doesn’t meet acceptable standards in these domains only
works to undermine a retailer’s own sustainability efforts, and
slows positive progress.

Despite  having  a  standalone  Human  Rights  Statement  and
a Supplier Code of Conduct, Giant Eagle fails to make explicit
reference to internationally recognized instruments such as the
UN Declaration of Human Rights, UNGPs, ILO Core Conventions,
and the ILO’s Work in Fisheries Convention, C188. In addition,
in  the  Human  Rights  &  Labor  Protections  section,  while  Giant
Eagle cites its work with the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership’s
Human  Rights  Risk  indicator  for  identifying  human  rights
risks  in  their  supply  chain,  this  work  is  not  supported  by  a
comprehensive  human  rights  due  diligence  process,  worker
engagement, or grievance mechanisms. This issue was perhaps
one of the biggest standout failures among all of Giant Eagles’
shortcomings as a retailer. The absence of a human rights due
diligence  framework,  and  as  such  the  lack  of  an  acceptable
grievance  mechanism  reflects
incredibly  poorly  on  any
company,  especially  those  engaged  directly  with  industries
where human rights abuses are highly prevalent.

Hy-Vee continues to go from strength to strength and continues to modernize and refine all of its existing policies regarding human rights, supply
chains, and sustainability. In comparison to its score in 2023, Hy-Vee added 10 percentage points to its score this year, one of the largest overall
scoring increases among all retailers.

Attributable in large part to an in-depth and thorough reassessment of many existing frameworks and policies, Hy-Vee was able to score much
more highly this year in the Human Rights and Labor Protections and the Advocacy and Initiatives sections of the survey. Unlike most retailers
in this report, Hy-Vee has not only updated its Seafood Procurement Policy within the last year, but it has also made explicit reference in this policy
to how its human rights and supplier code of conduct policies interact and accompany one another.41

As part of the updates to its Seafood Procurement Policy, in 2023 Hy-Vee developed a new Seafood Supply Chain Due Diligence Framework
and 3-Year Work Plan in collaboration with its partner FishWise. This framework is designed to align with the UNGPs by assessing potential human
rights impacts within its seafood supply chains through verification exercises; and, further by sharing the results and recommendations with its
seafood suppliers so that any additional steps are taken to mitigate potential human rights and instances of IUU-fishing.42;43

In  addition,  Hy-Vee  was  the  only  retailer  surveyed  in  this  report  to  provide  a  full  and  comprehensive  vessel  list.  This  public-facing  vessel
transparency  report,  developed  in  collaboration  with  Fish  Wise,  was  designed  and  completed  in  order  to  shed  light  on  the  complexity  of  Hy-
Vee’s tuna supply chains. In carrying-out and publishing this report, Hy-Vee exhibits a remarkable sense of awareness of its own impact in an
industry where illegal fishing and human and labor rights abuses regularly occur. Greenpeace commends the retailer for proactively increasing the
visibility into its own supply chain with the express purpose of further mitigating the risk of illegal fishing activities while protecting worker rights.44
Additionally, Hy-Vee is in the process of completing an update to its vessel list, which will be based on 2023 sourcing data.

PROS: On traceability, Hy-Vee scored highest overall, and was able to add an
additional few points this year as a result of its continued practice of internal
traceability audits that allow it to trace all tuna back to a vessel level 100% of
the time. Hy-Vee’s traceability work is rooted in internationally recognized best-
practice,  and  provides  a  publicly  transparent  overview  that  has  enabled  the
retailer  to  make  informed  and  considered  improvements  to  its  human  rights
policies over successive years.45

Additionally, as mentioned previously, Hy-Vee was the only retailer surveyed
in  this  report  to  provide  a  full  and  comprehensive  vessel  list.  In  carrying  out
and publishing this report, Hy-Vee exhibits a remarkable sense of awareness of
its own impact in an industry where illegal fishing and human and labor rights
abuses regularly occur.46

Hy-Vee  increasingly  advocates  for  observer  protections  by  encouraging
regulatory authorities and their respective observer programs to work together
and implement the International Observer Bill of Rights (IOBR) at the Regional
Fisheries  Management  Organization  (RFMO)  level.  RFMOs  are  multinational
governing bodies that play a key role in managing conservation and sustainable
management of high seas fisheries.

In  the  Current  Sourcing  section,  Hy-Vee  noted  that  it  no  longer  stocks
skipjack tuna from the Indian ocean, and has increased its use of pole and line
and troll or handline catch-methods.

In the Tuna Procurement Policy section, Hy-Vee once again scored quite high,
and stood out for making reference to international protection instruments such as
the UNGPs, the International Bill of Human Rights, the ILO Core Conventions, and
most importantly the C188 - Work in Fishing Convention. Additionally, Hy-Vee had
strong, internationally recognized requirements for its suppliers, including mandat-
ed rest times, crew conditions, and health and safety requirements. As such, Hy-Vee
scored highest out of all retailers on the steps taken by retailers to ensure the safety
and well-being of the workers in the tuna vessels across their supply chains.47

They were also one of two retailers to explicitly reference migrant worker rights in
their supplier Code of Conduct, and to require that suppliers treat migrant workers
the same as in-country nationals - an incredibly rare but vitally important provision.48

CONS:  Although  Hy-Vee  saw  an  improvement  in  its
Human  Rights  score,  it  scored  poorly  on  questions
related  to  the  specific  details  of  its  human  rights  due
diligence  framework  such  as  remediation,  worker
engagement,  and  worker  voice.  Although  the  retailer
has  signaled  that  its  new  draft  Seafood  Supply  Chain
policy  includes  a  thorough  Due  Diligence  Framework
and 3-Year Work Plan that aligns with the UNGPs, there
is  yet  no  publicly  available  proof  of  this.  Hy-Vee  has,
however, advised that a finalized version of this policy
will be published this year.

itself  with

Additionally,  while  Hy-Vee  has  made  efforts
to  familiarize
its  suppliers’  grievance
mechanisms, it has yet to establish its own grievance
mechanism or mandate an alignment of its supplier’s
mechanisms with the UNGPs. An internally developed
and  implemented  grievance  mechanism  would  go  a
long way to better ensuring the safety and protection
of workers along Hy-Vee’s supply chain.

With respect to Hy-Vee’s Current Sourcing policies,
as  reflected  in  its  average  score  across  this  section
of  the  survey,  there  is  much  to  be  desired  regarding
preferential  catch-methods  and  bycatch  reduction
efforts. Unfortunately, Hy-Vee continues to source the
majority  of  its  tuna  from  damaging  fishing  methods,
sourcing  well  over  90%  from  purse  seine  or  longline.
And, although there has been an encouraging increase
in  the  amount  of  tuna  the  retailer  sources  from
pole  and  line,  handline  or  troll,  and  longlines  with
bycatch mitigation devices - there is still too high of a
percentage to balance out the positive changes made
regarding other catch-methods.

This year, Kroger’s score remained exactly the same as last year. Although Kroger saw minor scoring increases in some sections, there were
notable decreases in other sections that canceled these gains out.

Despite  the  addition  of  a  few  extra  points  in  the  Tuna  Procurement  Policy  section,  Kroger  still  continues  to  perform  quite  poorly
across this entire section, opting to leave many questions blank and unanswered. Although it is commendable that in recent years Kroger
has updated its human rights policy to include a commitment to upholding multiple international instruments such as the UNGPs, some
Core ILO principles, and the International Bill of Human Rights - its policy simply does not go far enough in explaining how these apply to
Kroger’s tuna and seafood supply chains.49

Another major change that was noticed in Kroger’s policies this year is the unfortunate drop in points allocated towards sustainable
catch-methods in the Current Sourcing section of the survey. According to Kroger’s own data, the retailer has overseen a 20% decline in
sourcing pole and line caught tuna in favor of an increased reliance on purse-seine catch-methods utilizing free-school and FAD-caught
methods. Purse-seine nets, especially those utilizing FADs are associated with a much higher incidence of bycatch in comparison to pole
and line methods.

Overall, it seems Kroger is primed to make positive progress on a number of fronts, but has yet to do so. With respect to its Seafood
Sustainability Policy,50 multiple goals within this policy expired at the end of 2023, and it will be interesting to see whether the retailer
communicates how effective it has been in accomplishing these.

PROS:  In  regard  to  overall  positives,  it  is  encouraging  that
Kroger  has  developed  and  begun  implementing  its  Human
Rights  Policy  (2022),  and  that  it  commits  to  upholding  the
UNGPs,  the  International  Bill  of  Human  Rights,  and  the  ILO
Declaration  on  Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights  at  Work.51
However, despite also mentioning the implementation of a due
diligence  framework,  and  a  grievance  and  access  to  remedy
mechanism  -  Kroger  stops  short  of  fully  specifying  how  these
key human rights protections have been fully incorporated into
its operations and supply chains.

On  workers  freedom  of  association,  it  is  encouraging  that
Kroger  includes  language  in  its  Vendor  Code  of  Conduct  that
affirms  the  retailer’s  commitment  to  supporting  freedom  of
association  and  collective  bargaining  in  its  own  facilities;  but,
it  is  disappointing  that  the  Code  of  Conduct  stops  short  of
extending the same commitment to workers throughout Kroger
supply chains.52

Overall, there is a lot of improvement that needs to be made
across all of Kroger’s policies - however, a good start would be a
publicly available update regarding how the retailer is tracking
on  its  commitments  for  alignment  with  international  human
rights instruments, as specified in its 2022 Human Rights Policy.

CONS:  On  Traceability,  Kroger  scored  terribly  and  tied  for
the  worst  score  among  all  retailers.  Kroger’s  tracing  program
remains  poorly  developed  and  continues  to  rely  heavily  on
the  International  Seafood  Sustainability  Foundation  (ISSF),
which does not function as a substitute for a tailored internal
traceability policy.

With regard to transshipment, it is extremely disappointing
for a company of Kroger’s size and influence to leave this issue
largely unaddressed.

On Advocacy and Initiatives, Kroger scored quite poorly too
and was among the lowest scoring retailers for this section. Given
its size and industry influence It is disappointing that Kroger has
made little effort to engage with federal or international bodies
in  support  of  greater  advocacy  and  protection  for  biodiverse
marine environments, sustainable fisheries, or greater observer
protections.  Greenpeace  strongly  encourages  Kroger  to  make
better use of its voice in the community and help drive important
improvements across the greater seafood industry.

Overall, Meijer’s failings are numerous, and the lack of any coherent standalone policies related to human rights or tuna supply chains
is deeply problematic. Moreover, in Meijer’s Supplier Code of Conduct,53 which seemingly doubles as a human rights policy, there is no
mention of any of the numerous international human rights instruments, such as the ILO Core Conventions, the UNGPs, The International
Bill of Human Rights, or the ILO’s C188 - Work in Fishing Convention. Additionally, the retailer relies too heavily on supplier audits, and
supplier self-reporting of problems within its supply chain. When companies do not have robust internal audit systems in place, and instead
rely on third party or supplier self-auditing processes, supply chain abuses become more common and overlooked.

One positive this year was the release of Meijers’ updated Supplier Code of Conduct (2023)54 and, with it, a mention of support for
workers’  rights  for  freedom  of  association  and  the  implementation  of  a  Grievance  Mechanism.  Despite  there  being  little  additional
information surrounding these policies, such as explicit confirmation that these measures are accessible for workers across its supply
chains, this is a step in the right direction for Meijer.

PROS:  Aside  from  the  development  of  its  standalone  2023
Supplier  Code  of  Conduct,  which  includes  some  mention
of  human  rights,  freedom  of  association,  and  reference  to  a
grievance mechanism - there is little else to be positive about
when examining Meijer’s currently operable policies.

Although  the  retailer  deserves  some  commendation  for  its
work  with  the  Global  Seafood  Alliance,  and  its  participation
in  the  Ocean  Disclosure  Project,55  there  is  no  mention  of  any
progress related to these initiatives, or communication of how
they have shaped Meijers’ policies.

Overall, there is a lot of improvement that needs to be made
across all of Meijer’s policies, however a good start would be the
development of a standalone human rights  policy,  and  better
communication of which species its Sustainable Seafood policy
covers. In turn, perhaps next year Meijer could expect to see a
more substantial increase in scoring.

CONS:  Meijer’s  poor  score  was  largely  a  result  of  a  lack  of
information,  and  a  lack  of  alignment  with  any  internationally
recognised  frameworks  or  initiatives.  The  absence  of  a  shelf-
stable  tuna  policy,  or  any  standalone  tuna  policy  for  that
matter, greatly harmed Meijer’s ability to score any points in the
opening section of the survey.

One great failure was Meijer’s inability to provide any detail
regarding supplier requirements, or really any detail at all about
its  suppliers  in  general.  There  is  seemingly  no  framework  in
place to trace its own tuna products from vessel to cannery to
supplier, nor does the retailer have an internal traceability audit
system in place to begin remedying this egregious shortcoming.
In  such  circumstances,  retailers  remain  unable  to  back  up
any  public  advocacy  claims  they  may  make  in  support  of
sustainability or human rights. Similarly, Meijer does not have a
human rights due diligence framework in place, again relying on
suppliers to provide information regarding their own practices.
Across  the  Current  Sourcing  and  Customer  Education
and  Labeling  sections,  Meijer  performed  disappointingly
too.  Across  its  entire  survey  there  remains  no  mention  of
preferential sourcing for tuna from more sustainable fisheries,
nor does Meijer even make reference to any sustainable sourcing
certifications it has in place (internal or otherwise).

Easily one of the most notable overall standouts in this year’s edition, Target added 11 percentage points to its score this year, achieving
the largest single increase in scoring.

This increase was due to higher scores across Target’s Tuna Procurement Policy and Advocacy and Initiatives sections. Attributable
in large part to an in-depth and thorough reassessment of many existing frameworks and policies, both of Target’s 2023 Sustainability
and Governance Report, and Target’s draft Commitment to Sustainable Seafood, communicate the retailer’s current and future planned
initiatives and policies in detail. Additionally, alongside the submitted survey, Target provided a substantial amount of supplementary
information, references, and written justification for each of its answered responses.

Over the past year, Target has emphasized a renewed focus on social responsibility, product traceability, worker rights, and a push
to counter illegal fishing. Utilizing an internally-facing “Seafood Supply Chain Due Diligence Framework” and a “3-Year Work Plan”, this
currently operationalized framework aligns with the UNGPs on Business and Human Rights, and applies to all tuna suppliers across Target’s
supply chain. Implemented from 2023, and ongoing through 2024, these renewed processes and initiatives are reflected in Target’s draft
“Commitment to Sustainable Seafood” which is expected to be fully implemented by 2025.56

CONS: Overall one key downside of Target’s tuna procurement
and traceability policies is that it still allows transshipment. In
some cases where tuna is transshipped, traceability and chain-
of-custody can face disconnects and suffer as a result. However,
efforts to combat this are outlined in Target’s Detailed Guidance
for  At-Sea  Transshipment,  wherein  Target  specifies  that  in  all
instances  where  tuna  is  transshipped  there  is  100%  observer
coverage,  and  that  observers  have  access  to  independent
communication  devices  and  personal  life-saving  beacons.
Moreover, vessels that engage in transshipment within Target’s
supply chain are mandated to have an emergency action plan in
the event that threats to observer safety occur.60

In regard to its renewed Commitment to Sustainable Seafood
policy  that  allowed  Target  to  score  so  highly  in  this  year’s
scorecard - although Target expects to release the final version
of this framework in Q3 2024, and have it fully implemented in
2025, it is not exactly clear which sections are still being worked
on,  or  which  policies  and  initiatives  will  come  into  effect  next
year. As such there is still some degree of opaqueness that exists
around Target’s key document.

PROS:  Among  the  many  retailers  scored,  when  assessing
vendor  supply  chains  and  traceability,  Target  has  made
strides  to  become  a  leader  in  this  space.  One  example  of
this  is  the  implementation  of  an  internally  facing  Vendor
Expectations Letter (an accompanying product to their Seafood
Sustainability  Commitment),  that  all  seafood  vendors  sign
annually.  This  letter  references  both  the  ILO  Core  and  C188
Work in Fishing conventions.57 With further respect to vendors,
Target’s  Commitment  to  Sustainable  Seafood  outlines  that
preferential  sourcing  is  granted  to  vendors  that  are  members
of  the  International  Pole  &  Line  Foundation,  are  International
Seafood Sustainability Foundation participating companies, or
have  published  responsible  purchasing  policies,  and  actively
work  to  implement  environmental,  social  responsibility,  and
traceability initiatives.58

Further, for shelf-stable tuna products, Target is committed
to sourcing tuna from fisheries that are certified by the Marine
Stewardship  Council  with  supply  chain  traceability,  are  Green
or  Yellow  rated  according  to  the  Monterey  Bay  Aquarium’s
Seafood Watch program, or are from fisheries that are engaged
in  improvement  projects  that  mandate  trackable  time-bound
progress that is reported to a credible public industry reporting
platform such as Fishery Progress.59

Annually,

in  collaboration  with  a  sustainable  seafood
consultant,  Target  also  audits  its  own  tuna  supply  chain  and
reviews  its  tuna  vendors  traceability  practices,  assessing  the
implementation  of  vendors  tuna  policies  and  commitments,
and  works  with  vendors  to  strengthen  areas  of  weakness  or
concern.

This  year,  Sprouts  completed  a  survey  and  provided  Greenpeace  with  additional  supporting  resources  to  aid  in  the  completion  and
verification of its survey and profile. Alongside its Supplier Code of Conduct, its Responsible Seafood Sourcing Policy, and its Commitment
to Human Rights, Greenpeace was also able to draw upon Sprouts’ 2023 Impact Report to aid in the completion of its profile.61;62;63;64

Sprouts’ overall score increase this year was due to additional points picked up in the Tuna Procurement Policy section, and in the
Traceability  section  also.  On  Advocacy  and  Initiatives,  Sprouts  disappointingly  failed  to  record  a  single  score  throughout  the  entire
section, and with respect to the Human Rights and Labor Protections section, consistent with previous years, Sprouts scored very poorly.
It should be noted however, that in Sprouts’s Commitment to Human Rights, the retailer acknowledges that there is substantial work yet
to be done; and, that it is taking progressive steps to ensure alignment with the UNGPs and other unspecified human rights frameworks.65
The 4% bump this year was due to an increase in scoring in the Tuna Procurement Policy and Current Sourcing sections. Sprouts now
asserts that it can ensure that 40% of its tuna products come from suppliers that comply with ILO core labor standards, and the ILO’s Work
in Fishing Convention (C188).

Sprouts has enhanced its supply chain monitoring, and refined its human rights due diligence framework, though overall Sprouts is
still lagging massively behind other high-performing retailers due to a complete absence of a grievance mechanism, and the absence of a
commitment to uphold all four of the international instruments of human rights.

In Current Sourcing, Sprouts also saw a slight score increase due to the retailer no longer stocking yellowfin tuna sourced from Indian
Ocean fisheries, or Albacore tuna caught using the controversial drifting longline method. In both of these cases, further commendation is
due, as in each instance Sprouts has chosen to forgo profiting from unethical sourcing and catch-methods.

PROS:  Sprouts  achieved  its  highest  scores  and  ranking  for
the  Current  Sourcing  section.  Sprouts  sources  93%  of  its
tuna  from  suppliers  that  exclusively  utilize  pole  and  line
and troll or handline catch methods; two methods that are
deemed the most sustainable and ethical. Sprouts got one
of the highest scores for not stocking problematic species or
brands, and for halting the procurement of tuna caught via
unethical catch-methods..

On  Traceability,  Sprouts  was  also  in  the  group  of  top
performers,  and  although  they  did  not  top  the  cohort,  it
deserves praise for conducting ongoing internal traceability
audits  to  ensure  that  all  tuna  can  be  traced  back  to  the
individual fishing vessel. Additionally, Sprouts requires that
its  vendors  must  provide  chain  of  control  documents,  and
evidence  that  products  do  not  come  from  sources  utilizing
any illegal methods; including those violating human rights.66
With respect to human rights, Sprouts insists that it can
identify  risks  of  forced  or  child  labor  through  bi-annual
supply chain mapping, and that it reviews the policies and
practices associated with the suppliers sourcing from these
countries. Subsequently, as of this year, Sprouts has found
that roughly 45% of its tuna supply chain has completed a
human rights impact assessment, and that 40% of its tuna
products  come  from  suppliers  that  comply  with  ILO  core
labor  standards,  and  the  ILO’s  Work  in  Fishing  Convention
(C188).

CONS:  Despite  an  update  to  its  Human  Rights  Policy  over  the
past few years, Sprouts still lags massively behind other retailers
with  considered  and  developed  standalone  policies.  Sprouts’
commitment to human rights excludes an explicit alignment with
various  international  instruments  such  as  the  UN  Declaration
on  Human  Rights,  ILO  guidelines,  and  the  UNGPs.  Although
commendable improvement to its policy and its risk assessment
protocols  has  been  made,  the  retailers’  Human  Rights  scores
continue to be low - and Greenpeace urges Sprouts to push harder
on  an  alignment  to  these  frameworks,  and  to  communicate  its
progress towards these goals in a more transparent manner.

Furthermore  with  respect  to  human  rights,  when  it  comes  to
several  practical  elements  of  a  due  diligence  process  including
such  areas  as  remediation,  grievance  mechanisms,  and  worker
engagement, Sprouts barely has any current policies in place that
frame its approach of implementation of these key mechanisms.

On Advocacy and Initiatives, Sprouts scored badly, as one of
four retailers to nab no points at all across this entire section. For a
retailer like Sprouts, that has built its image on responsible social
and  environmental  practices,  it  is  severely  disappointing  that  it
has made no effort to engage with federal or international bodies
in  support  of  greater  advocacy  and  protection  for  biodiverse
marine  environments,  sustainable  fisheries,  or  greater  observer
protections.  Greenpeace  strongly  encourages  Sprouts  to  make
better use of its voice in the community and help drive important
improvements across the greater seafood industry.

Once again, Costco did not complete a survey or provide any supplementary materials to support Greenpeace USA in the scoring of its tuna
supply chain. As such, only publicly available information was used to update last year’s scores.

This year, Costco managed to increase its score slightly. With respect to traceability, through the use of internal and third party audits,
like those offered by the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF), Costco is able to trace to the vessel each catch of Albacore
Tuna that is destined for its private-brand Kirkland canned tuna products.67 As such, the communication of this audit framework earned
Costco extra points in the Traceability section.

In line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal number 8, Costco has committed to regular supply chain assessments
and  reviews.68  Costco  achieved  a  high  score  for  its  assurance  that  workers  throughout  its  tuna  supply  chains  receive  contracts  that
are accessible, and are written with language the worker understands. This closely mirrors stipulations set forth in Convention 188 as
developed by the International Labor Organisation.69

Broadly, it is a positive sign that Costco’s sustainability initiatives remain guided by seven of the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs); with SDG 14, “Life Below Water” being a focal point for the retailer’s seafood policy.70 Committing to the bare minimum,
Costco aims to not sell any seafood species that are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) endangered or critically
endangered lists.71 Though its direct partnership with the World Wildlife Fund to support Fisheries Improvement Projects is notable.72

Overwhelmingly,  large  parts  of  Costco’s  human  rights  and  sustainability  policies  rely  on  its  support  for  the  work  of  third  party
organizations like The Seafood Task Force; that despite doing valuable work, cannot be substituted for coherent internal Costco policies.

PROS:  Costco  could  claim  some  recognition  for  its  role  as
a  founding  member  of  the  Seafood  Task  Force,  a  coalition
of  organizations,  retailers,  and  NGOs  that  work  to  improve
sustainability
in  the  Thai  seafood  supply  chain  through
recruitment transparency, chain-of-custody oversight, and work
rights  more  broadly.73  However,  although  information  about
the task force is easily accessible via its website, it is difficult to
ascertain if or how many of the protocols, policies, and parts of
the task force’s ‘10-point-plan’ Costco actually adheres to.

Costco’s Supplier Code of Conduct (2018) does show that the
company has a grievance mechanism, and also that it reserves
the right to conduct audits of its vendors and suppliers at any
time;  in  turn  allowing  it  to  work  with  third  parties  to  analyze
risk  across  its  supply  chain.74  The  mention  of  both  of  these
mechanisms  in  Costco’s  policies  is  a  great  first  step,  however,
yet  again,  a  lack  of  further  depth  or  specific  reference  to  the
United Nations Guiding Principles effectiveness criteria result in
lower scores in the Traceability and Human Rights and Labor
Protections sections respectively.

CONS:  The  same  issues  that  dragged  down  Costco’s  scores  in
previous  years  largely  remained  consistent  in  this  edition  of
the  scorecard  also.  In  the  Tuna  Procurement  Policy  section,
its  sourcing  and  seafood  sustainability  policies  remain  vague,
as  does  its  policy  on  human  rights.75  Costco’s  human  rights
policy  could  be  improved  greatly  if  it  were  to  strictly  adhere
to standard international human rights principles, such as the
UNGPs,  ILO  Core  Conventions,  and  the  ILO’s  Work  in  Fishing
Convention (C188).

Additionally,  like  many  other  surveyed  retailers,  Costco
does  not  have  a  standalone  public  transshipment  policy,  nor
does it even make reference to the practice in any of its seafood
policy  briefing  web  pages  or  documents.  This  is  especially
disconcerting given Costco’s market capture, buying power, and
industry influence - all of which could easily be used to lead and
drive action on transshipment.

As has been the case in previous years, despite specifically mentioning on one of its Sustainable Seafood websites that, “H-E-B will gladly
answer questions regarding our sustainable seafood practices,” once again H-E-B declined requests to complete a survey for this year’s
tuna report card.76 As such, similar to the other retailers who declined to return a completed survey, H-E-B’s publicly available policies
were  instead  used  to  complete  their  scorecard.  These  included  H-E-B’s  Seafood  Policy,77  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct,78  and  its  Seafood
Sustainability Table.79

Despite  having  some  language  in  its  internal  policies  in  support  of  ILO  convention  138,80  that  specifies  vendors  must  not  employ
underage workers in their respective regions, H-E-B fails to cite an adherence to other core ILO labor standards or the C188 Work in Fishing
Convention.

Similar to most retailers, H-E-B scored points  early  on in  the  Tuna  Procurement Policy  section  for  having  some  sustainability and
human rights policies in place, but was largely unable to record scores for many of the more specific questions. It also scored well in terms
of Traceability, and for its efforts to source mostly sustainable fish from fisheries that are rated ‘Green’ or ‘Yellow’ on the Environmental
Defense Fund’s (EDF) Seafood Selector.

Where H-E-B fell down, as with many other non-responsive retailers, is the lack of depth and specificity in most of its publicly available

policies.

PROS: In the Tuna Procurement Policy and Current Sourcing
sections,  H-E-B  scored  well  for  having  some  policies  in  place
and for illustrating its seafood sustainability specifics (showing
how  each  species  of  tuna  has  been  sustainably  caught  and
how  it  is  classified)  in  a  product  sourcing  grid.81  Making  this
sustainability and sourcing information so easily accessible to
the public in this format is a promising step, though more must
be done.

Using this product sourcing grid, and H-E-B’s Seafood Policy
webpage it it is easy to see that this retailer preferentially sources
from fisheries that are rated ‘Green’ or ‘Yellow’ according to the
Environmental Defense Fund’s Seafood Selector, or are certified
as  sustainable  by  the  Marine  Stewardship  Council  (MSC).82
With further regard to sourcing, H-E-B mentions in its Seafood
Policy  that  it  only  sources  from  suppliers  involved  in  Fishery
Improvement  Projects  (FIPs),  that  meet  the  Conservation
Alliance  for  Seafood  Solutions  criteria;  and  track  the  time-
bound progress of these FIPs towards their sustainability goals
through the Fishery Progress website.83

H-E-B also scored well for its efforts to improve Traceability,
including its commitments to not selling IUU tuna, for utilizing
Trace Register to provide third party verification of its inventory,
and  for  undertaking  independent  audits  to  uncover  non-
compliant products and suppliers.84

CONS:  Like  many  retailers,  despite  an  undoubted  awareness
of the pervasive human rights concerns ingrained in the global
tuna  industry,  H-E-B’s  scores  in  the  human  rights  sections  of
the survey suffered due to a lack of policy depth and specificity.
Regarding adherence to common conventions and due diligence
frameworks, such as the UNGPs on Business and Human Rights
or core ILO conventions, across all of its policies, H-E-B fails to
mention any of these standard globally applicable policies, or
at a minimum even how it enforces its own vague human rights
policy.

One  instance  of  this  is  that  despite  having  some  language
in its internal policies in support of the bare-minimum policies
such as the ILO convention 138,85 which specifies vendors must
not employ underage workers in their respective regions, H-E-B
fails to cite an adherence to other industry-specific conventions
like the ILO’s C188 Work in Fishing Convention. With more than
half of the survey questions concerning human and labor rights
and protections, it is no surprise that HEB fared so poorly across
many survey sections.

As has been so in previous editions of this scorecard, Publix did not respond to requests from Greenpeace USA to complete the survey.
As such, its positions, policies, and initiatives were drawn from publicly available information, such as tuna product pages on its website,
news articles, and previously cited sources from past editions of this report. Due to no measurable changes year on year to Publix’s policies,
the retailer’s score didn’t change.

Like many other low-scoring retailers, Publix seemingly lacks coherent and structured frameworks and policies that are specific to their
tuna products. Instead, Publix opts for generalized blog-style explainers like its “Seafood Sustainability” page. And, although this webpage
mentions that some of their products are “responsibly sourced” or “sustainably sourced,” there is little supporting information regarding
what these labels actually mean in terms of traceability, sourcing, and at-sea worker rights.86

Compiling qualitative and quantitative data across a range of sustainability, supply chain, and human rights domains would no doubt
greatly aid Publix in creating the measurable time-bound policies it currently may not have. If Publix were to achieve some of these goals
or share any of these practices that it is implementing, it is likely that it could score highly on future editions of this scorecard.

PROS:  Publix  acknowledges  the
importance  of  making
commitments  to  sourcing  sustainable  seafood,  and  this
is  evidenced  by  its  public  collaboration  with  a  number  of
important  seafood-focused  sustainability  organizations  and
initiatives, such as the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP),
the Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI), and the Ocean
Disclosure Project (ODP).87

It should also be noted that Publix has previously participated
in  the  SFP’s  bycatch  audit  program.88  It  is  not  clear,  however,
to  what  degree  this  has  affected  their  sustainability  practices
related to Publix’s yellowfin tuna products, and as a result this
did not directly translate into any extra points awarded in the
survey.

CONS:  Despite  having  published  sustainability  reports  over
the past few years while committing to various initiatives and
making  donations  to  support  fishery  improvement  projects,
Publix still falls incredibly short of publicly communicating how
or  whether  these  statements  translate  directly  into  product
specific  policies  or  actions.  Largely,  there  remains  a  lack  of
adequate information regarding seafood sourcing, traceability,
product  chain  of  custody,  and  consequently  worker  rights
across Publix’s supply chain. As a result, Greenpeace USA was
unable  to  award  scores  for  many  questions  across  both  the
Environmental and Human Rights categories of the survey.

For the first time, Trader Joe’s (TJ) was added to the list of retailers in Greenpeace USA’s High Cost of Cheap Tuna report. Trader Joe’s boasts
a strong foothold in the US grocery landscape and a loyal and devoted consumer following that may be contingent on a public perception
that the retailer is both environmentally sustainable and fair to its workforce.

Unfortunately for TJ customers, the validity of this perception is difficult to verify given the complete lack of any formal sustainability,
supply chain, or worker rights policies available in the public domain. Moreover, as Trader Joe’s did not respond or fill out a survey, there
was little information available to score this retailer.

Perhaps  one  positive  is  that  Trader  Joe’s  does  state  that  they  use  the  Seafood  Watch  List  to  inform  its  product  development  and
procurement  policies.  Additionally,  Trader  Joe’s  mentions  that  in  2013  it  switched  sourcing  methods  for  several  wild-caught  seafood
products in order to reduce the potential for bycatch.89 However once again, these assurances are only published on the Product FAQs
page of its website, with no sources listed or ability to verify these claims.

As a consequence of the lack of public information, Trader Joe’s performed more poorly than any other retailer surveyed, and came in
dead last in this year’s edition of the tuna retailer scorecard. This ranking is incredibly disappointing given that the last time Trader Joe’s
was surveyed for its tuna sustainability in 2013, it topped Greenpeace USA’s rankings.

Additionally, in light of a recent labor rights push by Trader Joe’s employees, it was reported by Bloomberg, that in January of this year
an attorney representing Trader Joe’s at a National Labor Relations Board hearing argued that the US Labor Board is unconstitutional. This
argument was made against the US Labor Board after it accused the retailer of illegally threatening and retaliating against workers who
sought to formally organize.90 US labor law protects employees by extending them the right to organize and communicate about working
conditions even if they are not unionized.91

PROS: Trader Joe’s utilizes the Seafood Watch List to inform its
product development and procurement policies,92 and includes
some  mention  of  sustainable  fishing  methods  for  its  privately
labeled tuna products.

Trader  Joe’s  states  that  it  requires  suppliers  to  follow  US
law and the laws of any other relevant nation or international
governing body, but it doesn’t go further or provide much detail
on this beyond requesting that suppliers certify (whether that
be  self-reported  or  reviewed  by  third  parties  is  unclear)  that
there  was  no  use  of  forced  labor,  prison  labor,  or  child  labor.
Although  statements  like  this  are  encouraging  and  may  offer
some reassurance, they once again lack the requisite detail and
policy-related specificity to be deemed a formal policy.

CONS: For Trader Joe’s, more so than for any other retailer, the
list of ‘cons’ or negatives associated with all surveyed categories
is  difficult  to  quantify,  track,  or  list.  This  is  due  to  the  void  of
information  publicly  available  to  consumers,  prospective
partners,  or  organizations  wishing  to  learn  more  about  this
retailer.

Trader  Joe’s  sourcing  and  seafood  sustainability  policies
remain  vague  and  almost  entirely  non-existent,  as  does  its
policy  on  human  rights.  Trader  Joe’s  could  easily  improve
both of these policy areas if they were more clearly guided by
specific  international  principles,  such  as  the  UNGPs,  ILO  Core
Conventions  and  the  ILO  C188  Work  in  Fishing  Convention.
Trader Joe’s also does not seem to have a public transshipment
policy, which is disappointing.

With  respect  to  human  rights  across  its  supply  chain,
Trader  Joe’s  does  not  publicly  mention  anywhere  any  kind  of
adherence to, or consideration of grievance mechanisms, due
diligence frameworks, or engagement with vulnerable groups.

Once  again,  this  year  Walmart  did  not  complete  a  survey;  as  such,  publicly  available  information,  including  Walmart’s  Human  Rights
webpage,93 its Human Rights Statement on its corporate policy page,94 and its updated Seafood Policy95 were used to score the survey.
Additionally this year, with the use of Walmart’s 2023 “Enhanced Seafood Policy”,96 more contextual information was able to be added to
Walmart’s retailer profile. However since most of the policies proposed in this future focused policy will not be fully commercialized until
2025 or 2027, Greenpeace USA was unable to award Walmart any extra points in this current survey.

Of note, in 2022 Walmart partnered with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to
source tuna certified to Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) standards for its Great Value private-label brand.97 This partnership resulted in
the founding and launch of Pacific Island Tuna (PIT); a vertically integrated end-to-end tuna supply chain company with a core focus on
sustainability. Walmart has stated that it plans to source all of its Great Value Brand private-label canned skipjack tuna from the Pacific
Island Tuna company.98 This is a promising move, especially as PIT claims that no transshipment happens across their supply chain.99
However, the reliance on certifications like MSC and that this has not yet been implemented across Walmart’s supply chains mean that the
impact and reach is yet to be seen.

PROS: Walmart was one of the only retailers to have a reasonably thorough
standalone  policy  section  on  human  rights,  that  includes  language  in
support  of  global  forced  labor  prevention,  responsible  recruitment
expectations,  and  supplier  requirements  for  supply  chain  transparency.
Further, it is commendable that this policy makes reference to international
instruments, including the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles
and Rights at Work, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights.100

Largely, it appears that Walmart continues to prepare for large strides
forward  for  its  tuna  procurement,  sustainability,  and  supply  chain
transparency policies with the update and release of its ‘Enhanced Seafood
Policy’ (2023).101 However, as most of Walmart’s proposed keystone seafood
policies  are  either  in-progress  or  to  be  implemented  from  2025  through
2027,  it  is  difficult  to  accurately  report  on  their  current  state  of  affairs  in
2023 and 2024. That being said, there are some reasons to be both excited
and cautiously hopeful for many of the future initiatives outlined.

For its Fresh and Frozen and Shelf Stable tuna, Walmart has stated that
by 2027 it will only source from vessels that have 100% observer monitoring,
whether  electronic  or  human,  and  phasing  out  high  seas  transshipment
unless there is 100% coverage of observer monitoring as well.

CONS:  While  Walmart’s  sustainability  and  human
rights  policies  are  more  detailed  and  better
developed  than  most,  many  of  the  commitments
detailed  in  its  Enhanced  Seafood  Policy  are  goals
for 2025 and 2027, and at present it is unclear how
much  progress  has  been  made  towards  them.
Because  this  survey  is  interested  in  what  policies
are  currently  in  place,  Walmart’s  score  in  the  Tuna
Procurement Policy section suffered from a lack of
information  concerning  its  progress  towards  these
goals.

Like  other  retailers,  Walmart’s  policies  omit
a  number  of  key  details.  With  regard  to  human
rights  for  example,  while  Walmart  does  mention
the  need  to  ensure  migrant  workers  are  recruited
responsibly,
the  survey  questions  associated
with  this  topic  required  written  recognition  of  the
increased  risks  faced  by  migrant  workers  -  and
Walmart’s policies did not include this specifically-
aligned  language.  Moreover,  as  Walmart  continues
to  rely  on  third-party  social  audits  when  it  comes
to  monitoring,  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  from  its
own  internal  documents  various  key  details  about
these  audits.  Additionally,  although  Walmart  does
have a due diligence framework, it does not include
human rights nor apply to seafood supply chains.102
Similarly,  Walmart  mentions  its  use  of  a  grievance
mechanism,  yet  as  currently  implemented  it  does
not meet the UN’s guidelines.

As in the past two editions of this scorecard, this year Wegmans did not submit a survey. As such, Wegmans scoring was calculated using
publicly available information and information from previous scorecards. Primarily, Wegmans “Responsible Seafood Sourcing” website,
and “Wegmans Seafood Sourcing Policy 3.8” (2024) were analyzed and used to score the survey.103,104

Since the last edition of this report, it appears as though Wegmans has made some effort to increase the public communication of
its  sustainable  seafood  policies  with  the  2024  publication  of  “Wegmans  Seafood  Sourcing  Policy  3.8.”  In  this  policy  outline,  Wegmans
highlights changes in its approach to traceability, namely with its insistence that, by the end of 2024, all of its seafood suppliers must utilize
a Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability (GDST), which enforces an interoperable traceability system chosen by the supplier.105 Moreover,
with respect to seafood sourcing, this policy outline maintains that all seafood will be “sourced from fisheries or farms that are certified
as benchmarked to the standards of the Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI),” or that “seafood may be sourced from fisheries
or farms that have utilized alternative documented processes to verify alignment with and support of responsible practices related to
environmental impact.”106

However, despite the release of its updated seafood sourcing policy for 2024, Wegmans fails to outline timelines for implementation,
or specify key details about what percentage of which species caught are covered under these policies. As such, for the purpose of scoring
Wegmans for this scorecard, very little usable and detailed information was able to be carried across from this key policy document to their
finalized score.That being said, the release of “Wegmans Seafood Sourcing Policy 3.8” (2024), is an incredibly encouraging development,
and Wegmans deserves commendation for this update to its policies.

PROS:  The  largest  case  for  positivity  with  Wegmans  lies  in  its
updated  Seafood  Sourcing  Policy,  and  dedicated  webpage,
“Responsible  Seafood  Sourcing.”  This  includes  some  solid
moves  in  the  right  direction,  such  as  the  updated  traceability
and  sourcing  requirements,  along  with  supply  chain  and
supplier  requirements  regarding  the
ILO  Declaration  on
Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights  at  Work,  UN  Guiding
Principles  on  Business  &  Human  Rights  (UNGP),  and  the  ILO
Core Conventions, among others.
Greenpeace
this,

commends  Wegmans’
commitment  to  sourcing  from  fisheries  that  are  certified
sustainable  or  involved  in  a  Fisheries  Improvement  Program
(FIP).  Additionally,  it  is  promising  to  see  Wegmans  enforcing
supplier  commitments  to  a  GDST  standards  system,  a  move
that  will  hopefully  empower  it  to  maintain  and  report  more
accurately on its traceability standards. Although commitments
such as these are a positive signal, this scorecard marks policies
not promises.

Beyond

CONS: Across the board, the lack of detail in most of Wegmans’s
seafood policies undermines the company’s positive overtones
of commitments to improved traceability, sourcing, and human
rights across its supply chain. This lack of clarity, coupled with
rough timelines for these major commitments makes it unclear
how  Wegmans  will  achieve  both  its  promised  objectives  and
those that it requires of its suppliers.

Additionally,  based  on  available  information,  it  appears  as
though  Wegmans  relies  entirely  on  third-party  social  audits
to  ensure  its  sourcing  policies  and  standards  are  achieved.
While  third-party  audits  may  have  value  in  specific  instances,
social  audits  have  long  been  recognized  by  the  human
rights  community  as  insufficient.  To  effectively  address  the
problems and ensure that they are complying with international
labor, health, safety, and environmental standards, companies
must  establish  adequate  levels  of  independent  oversight  and
supply  chain  monitoring,  and  genuinely  engage  with  workers
employed in their supply chains.

119  According to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,
severity is determined by an assessment of the scale (seriousness of
harm), scope (number of individuals that are or will be affected), and
irremediable character of the violation. A determination of severity
does not require all three criteria to be met. There is no exhaustive
list of “incredibly severe” abuses, but some examples include murder,
disappearances, torture, and permanent or severe injuries (either physical
or mental), includng those that prevent the fisher from working or earning
the same pay. In these instances, your supplier will not be able to restore
those affected to a situation at least the same as, or equivalent to, their
situation before the human rights abuse. When in doubt, retailers should
consult directly with the affected people or their representatives before
determining whether the abuse/s can be effectively remediated.

113  To avoid confusion and aid in understanding, all salient terms of the

contract must be verbally communicated to each worker as part of the
onboarding process.

114  “Local” in this context means that, for example, distant water vessels
flagged to Taiwan must pay its crew at least a living wage for Taiwan.

115  “Living wage” should be based on collective bargaining or an

independently determined, established methodology. Companies should
publicly disclose the methodology they use and work with trade unions
and other relevant stakeholders to develop living wage benchmarks
where they do not already exist.

117  Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) defines Human Rights Due

Diligence as “an ongoing risk management process that a reasonable and
prudent company needs to follow in order to identify, prevent, mitigate
and account for how it addresses its adverse human rights impacts. As
set out in the UN Guiding Principles 17-21, this includes four key steps:
assessing actual and potential human rights impacts; integrating and
acting on the findings; tracking responses; and communicating about
how impacts are addressed.”
