in the Energy [R]evolution!

Energy [R]evolution

Together with the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC),
Greenpeace has published a global energy scenario as a practical
blueprint for how CO2 reduction targets can be urgently met, and how
an affordable energy supply on the basis of steady worldwide
economic development can be secured. These goals are both
possible to achieve at the same time. The urgent need for change in
the energy sector means that this scenario is based only on proven
and sustainable technologies, such as renewable energy sources and
efficient decentralised cogeneration.

Commissioned from the Department of Systems Analysis and
Technology Assessment (Institute of Technical Thermodynamics) at
the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), the report develops a global
sustainable energy pathway up to 2050. The future potential for
renewable energy sources has been assessed with input from all
sectors of the renewables industry around the world.

The good news is that the global market for renewables is booming.
Decades of technical progress have seen renewable energy
technologies such as wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels,
biomass power plants, solar thermal collectors and many others move
steadily into the mainstream. The global market for renewable energy
is growing dramatically; in 2008 its turnover was over $ 120 billion (US
dollars), almost twice as high as the previous year.

The power industry and utilities need to take more responsibility,
because today’s investment decisions will define the energy supply of
the next generation. We strongly believe that this should be the ‘solar
generation’. Politicians from the industrialised world urgently need to
rethink their energy strategy, while developing countries should learn
from the world’s past mistakes and build their own economies on the
strong foundations of a sustainable energy supply.

Renewable energy could more than double its share of the world’s
energy supply - reaching up to 30% by 2030. All that is lacking is the
political will to promote its large scale deployment in all sectors at a
global level, coupled with far reaching energy efficiency measures.
By 2030 about half of global electricity could come from renewable
energies.

The Energy [R]evolution Scenario concludes that the restructuring of
the global electricity sector requires an investment of $ 14.7 trillion
(US dollars) until 2030. This compares with $ 11.3 trillion under the
Reference Scenario based on International Energy Agency projections.

In fact, the additional costs for coal power generation alone from
today up to 2030 under the Reference Scenario could be as high as
$ 15.9 billion (US dollars): this would cover the entire investment
needed in renewable and cogeneration capacity to implement the
Energy [R]evolution Scenario. These renewable sources will produce
energy without any further fuel costs beyond 2030, while the costs for
coal and gas will continue to be a burden on national and global
economies.

In fact, given the significant risks associated with nuclear power, the
investments required to implement the Energy [R]evolution scenario
gain more appeal. Economically compelling returns resulting from
lower installed cost of renewable energy generation, like wind farms
(€1,200/kW in 2005) and concentrated solar power plants (€2,700/kW
in 2020)1, with measurable risk and associated quantifiable
contingencies do appeal. These renewable energy sources will
produce energy without any further fuel costs beyond 2030.

Investments required in energy infrastructures as well as emerging
opportunities in the clean tech industry offer much more attractive
opportunities for compelling investment returns from proven
technologies and future developments.

“ While the average annual investment

required to implement the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario would need just
under 1% of global GDP, it would lower
fuel costs by 25% - saving an annual
amount in the range of $ 750 billion.”

and a steam turbine are
located. The turbine drives a

Facts

• Renewable electricity generation capacity reached an
estimated 240 Gigawatts (GW) worldwide in 2007, an
increase of 50% over 2004. Renewables represent
5% of global power capacity and 3.4% of global
power generation. These figures exclude large
hydropower, which accounted for 15% of global
power generation alone.

• Renewable energy (excluding large hydropower)

generated as much electric power worldwide in 2006
as one-quarter of the world’s nuclear power plants.

• The largest component of renewable generation
capacity is wind power, which grew by 28%
worldwide in 2007, to reach 95 GW. The annual
capacity growth rate is even higher: 40% more in
2007 than in the year before.

• The fastest growing energy technology in the world is
grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV), with a 50%
annual increase in cumulative installed capacity in
both 2006 and 2007 to reach 7.7 GW. This translates
into 1.5 million homes with rooftop solar PV feeding
into the grid.

• Rooftop solar heat collectors provide hot water to

nearly 50 million households worldwide, and space
heating to a growing number of homes. Existing solar
hot water/heating capacity increased by 19% in 2006
to reach 105 Gigawatts thermal (GWth) globally.

• The use of biomass and geothermal energy for both

power and heating has been increasing in a number of
countries, including for district heating networks. More
than 2 million ground source heat pumps are now
used in 30 countries to heat (and cool) buildings.

• Renewable energy, in particular small hydropower,
biomass and solar PV, is providing electricity, heat,
motive power and water pumping for tens of millions
of people in the rural areas of developing countries,
serving agriculture, small industry, homes and
schools. 25 million households cook and light their
homes with biogas and 2.5 million households use
solar lighting systems.

• Developing countries account for more than 40% of

existing renewable power capacity, more than 70% of
solar hot water capacity and 45% of biofuels
production.

• In terms of investment, an estimated $ 71 billion US
dollars was invested in new renewable power and
heating capacity worldwide in 2007 (excluding large
hydropower). Of this, 47% was for wind power and
30% for solar PV. Investment in large hydropower, the
most established renewable energy source, added a
further $ 15–20 billion. The total amount invested in
new renewable energy capacity, manufacturing plants
and research and development during 2007 is
estimated to have reached a record $ 100 billion.
