Defending Forests, Defending Freedoms

Since 1971,
Greenpeace has been a
leading voice of the
environmental
movement. Greenpeace
works around the world
to protect oceans and
ancient forests, and to
fight toxic pollution,
genetic engineering,
global warming and
nuclear threats. Without
compromise,
Greenpeace takes on
powerful political and
corporate opposition to
protect the future of our
planet.

The Greenpeace Forest
Campaign works to
protect our national
forests from the Bush
administration’s clearcut
policies that favor the
timber industry over the
preservation of public
lands and civil liberties.
Greenpeace is working
to rescue critical ancient
forests on our public
lands that deserve to be
protected for future
generations.

Protecting our Heritage

Our national forests provide us with essential needs like clean air and water, soil
production,  flood  control  and  climate  stability.  They  also  offer  scenic  beauty,
recreational activities and related jobs and wildlife habitat. America’s forests play
a  critical  role  in  providing  large  expanses  of  undisturbed  terrain  for  plants  and
animals,  housing  17  percent  of  the  1,200  listed  threatened  and  endangered
species.

Most Americans assume that our government is protecting our national forests,
rich with vital ecological functions. Sadly, our hard earned tax dollars are instead
being used to fund logging, road building and other extractive industries in our
forests.

For  over  100  years,  our  national  forests  have  been  destructively  mismanaged,
primarily  for  timber.  Not  only  have  these  practices  been  ruinous  to  the  forest
ecosystem,  they  have  continually  wasted  the  American  people’s  money,
providing few benefits in return. Only two percent of the wood products used in
the United States come from public forests.

The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have
been entrusted to conserve our forests. However, despite the conservation intent
behind their creation, these government agencies have neglected to safeguard
our public lands. Due to the failures of these bureaus, dating back many years,
we are now faced with having only five percent of our ancient forests left intact.

The Forest Service: Negligent in its Duty to Protect Our Ancient Forests

The  Forest  Service  is  charged  with  managing  191  million  acres  of  forest  and
rangeland, an area equal to the size of Texas and 8.5 percent of the total U.S.
land area. By law and at every level of planning, the Forest Service must ensure
the social and economic benefits of its forest management for all Americans. This
means before it begins any timber sale program it must conduct a cost benefit
analysis  that  accounts  for  the  full  monetary  and  social  value  of  the  standing
forest and assess those values against those gained by the sale of the timber, as
well as an environmental impact analysis.

The  Forest  Service  consistently  ignores  this  type  of  analysis  while  steadfastly
pursuing  its  timber  sale  program.  This  is  a  breach  of  both  the  law  and  its
responsibility  to  the  American  people  who  have  entrusted  and  funded  this
agency  to  protect  our  forests.  In  fiscal  year  1997,  taxpayers  provided  over  $1

billion  to  subsidize  private  logging  companies  that
destroy our forests while the Forest Service spends
millions of dollars for road building and other timber
extraction  processes.  The  Forest  Service  has  been
unable  to  provide  data  on  the  cost  of  its  timber
programs  since  1998.  At  that  time,  the  agency
reported  a  $126  million  loss,  but  an  independent
analysis found losses to be three times that amount.

Our  tax  dollars  would  be  far  better  spent  on  the
ecological  and  recreational  resources  that  forests
provide,  creating  both  economic  gain  and  keeping
the  forest  ecosystem  thriving.  According  to  the
Forest  Service’s  own  data,  recreation  in  national
forests accounts for over 30 times both the amount
of revenue and jobs created than those from timber
sales.  Annually,  timber  produces  roughly  $4  billion
per  year  while  recreation,  fish  and  wildlife,  clean
water  and  roadless  areas  provide  a  combined  total
of $224 billion to the American economy each year.
If the Forest Service were a company, it would have
gone bankrupt long ago.

This  summer,  the  Forest  Service  and  BLM  are
planning  to  extensively  log  some  of  the  last
remaining  ancient  forests  across  the  United  States,
including  forests  in  Oregon,  Alaska  and  Virginia.  In
the  Pacific  Northwest  alone,  188  sales  totaling
almost 89,000 acres of old-growth forest are slated
for  the  chopping  block.  In  the  Siskiyou  National
Forest,  an  unprecedented  370  million  board  feet  of
timber  is  scheduled  to  be  cut.  This  is  the  largest
timber sale in modern U.S. history.

Bureau  of  Land  Management: Our  Ancient
Forests under the Freewheeling Axe

The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for
managing  262  million  acres  of  public  land,  located
primarily in 12 western states including Alaska.  BLM
is  notorious  for  liquidating  the  natural  resources
under  its  jurisdiction  for  the  benefit  of  private
interests. An 18-month study of the agency’s timber
sales  by  Public  Employees  for  Environmental
shows  widespread
Responsibility
mismanagement  of  the  BLM’s  Public  Domain
forestry  program.  This  mismanagement  includes
widespread  noncompliance  by  BLM  employees  to
follow the agencies own policies and regulations.

program  at  an  economic  loss.  According  to  Green
Scissors, the BLM agency fails to return 20 percent
of its timber revenues to the federal treasury to cover
the timber sale administration costs, as required by
law.

The threats to ancient forests are primarily due to the
agency’s complete lack of policy for protecting old-
growth  on  public  forests.  The  agency  attempts  to
sidestep  its  responsibility  by  denying  there  are  any
old-growth forests on BLM land, a huge fallacy when
one looks at its holdings in Oregon.  A review of over
30  BLM  timber  sales  by  PEER  found  that  BLM
districts in Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon and
federal
California  violated  NEPA  and  other
requirements  for  timber  sales.  This  summer,  over
18,000 acres of ancient forests in Oregon are threat-
ened by the BLM’s axe.

Join Greenpeace in Rescuing and Restoring our
Ancient Forests

These  public  lands  belong  to  us,  not  the  timber
industry.  Help  protect  our  American  heritage  by
telling your representatives to stop using Americans’
money to cut down our forests. Join Greenpeace in
calling for permanent protection of our last remaining
ancient  forests  and  an  immediate  end  to  all
commercial logging in public forests.
