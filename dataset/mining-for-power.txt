1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  5Greenpeace USA research reveals how the Bitcoin 
mining industry is interconnected with the fossil 
fuel and other polluting industry groups and climate 
denialists that oppose needed action to address the 
climate crisis. Bitcoin mining companies and trade 
groups are tied to politicians and dark-money groups 
pushing pro-corporate policy agendas that harm 
working people and BIPOC communities while limiting 
democracy. Ties to anti-environmental forces cast 
doubts on claims from Bitcoin industry advocates 
that mining promotes the build-out of renewable 
energy, stability of electricity grids, and reductions in 
methane gas emissions.
In reality, the mining industry’s impact on the climate 
reveals that Bitcoin proponents’ promises deviate 
substantially from reality. Independent research 
finds that Bitcoin mining – the Proof-of-Work (PoW) 
system that relies on millions of specialized and 
energy hungry computers to maintain and secure 
its decentralized digital ledger - emits as much 
greenhouse gas as some industrialized countries and 
that the majority of the electricity for Bitcoin mining 
comes from oil, coal, and gas ( see Appendix A for 
more detail on PoW and its environmental impacts ).1 
And Bitcoin’s carbon footprint has only grown over 
time. Researchers estimate that in 2021 mining a 
single bitcoin emitted 126 times the CO2 as a bitcoin 
mined in 2016.2 Bitcoin mines, essentially large 
warehouses of specialized computers, also consume 
large and growing amounts of water from generating 
their needed electricity and cooling equipment. 
Operations in the U.S. alone use as much water as 
300,000 households – about the size of Washington, 
DC.3 Meanwhile the increased energy demand 
from Bitcoin mines is straining electrical grids and 
increasing costs for ratepayers, while doing little to 
nothing for the expansion of renewable energy.4Additionally, the broader political agenda of many 
groups supporting Bitcoin are counter to promot -
ing sustainability and action to address the climate 
crisis. Since Bitcoin provides a lifeline for fossil fuels 
by helping keep dirty coal and gas plants running, it 
should come as no surprise that fossil fuel companies 
and climate deniers are excited about the industry. INTRODUCTION
Bitcoin mining companies and trade 
groups are tied to politicians and  
dark-money groups pushing pro-corporate 
policy agendas that harm working  
people and BIPOC communities  
while limiting democracy.
Bitcoin Mining’s Climate and 
Community Impacts:
Fact 1:  Bitcoin emits as much greenhouse gas as 
some industrialized countries. 
Fact 2:  The majority of electricity for Bitcoin mining 
comes from oil, coal, and gas.
Fact 3:  Bitcoin mining is designed so that its 
energy consumption will grow over time and so will 
greenhouse gas emissions, researchers estimate 
that in 2021 mining a single bitcoin emitted 126 
times the CO2 as a bitcoin mined in 2016. 
Fact 4:  Bitcoin consumes large and growing 
amounts of water, operations in the US alone use 
as much water as 300,000 households the size of 
Washington DC. 
Fact 5:  Bitcoin mining has huge impacts on 
communities including air and noise pollution. 
Fact 6:  Bitcoin mines strain electrical grids 
increasing costs to rate payers.

16 MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERSTake Exxon Mobil who has pilot projects to mine 
Bitcoin using methane gas from the dirty fracking 
fields of North Dakota and plans to expand similar 
operations around the world.5
Many staff of cryptocurrency mining and Bitcoin 
industry groups have worked with conservative 
think-tanks and advocacy groups like the American 
Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and organizations 
funded by the Koch brothers’ network that oppose 
policies to protect consumers, the environment, and 
workers, and want to slash public programs. Others 
have worked as lobbyists for fossil fuel companies 
and other big corporate interests. Numerous peo -
ple who worked in the Trump administration, which 
worked aggressively to eliminate or weaken environ -
mental and climate policies, have found new jobs 
advocating for Bitcoin as leaders of trade associations 
and Bitcoin mining companies.
The Satoshi Action Fund (SAF) stands out among 
crypto trade associations and Bitcoin advocacy 
groups as being the most aggressive in defending the 
polluting Bitcoin mining industry, especially through Numerous people who worked in the

and is connected to networks of right-wing advocacy 
groups, corporate interests, and climate deniers.
Ties to the groups and politicians spreading climate 
disinformation and protecting the dirty fossil fuel 
industry, not to mention weakening democracy and 
slashing public services, are the tell-tale features of 
an industry that is holding the U.S. back from a just 
transition to a more sustainable future. 
Interactive Power Map Explainer
Greenpeace USA visualized the relationships between Bitcoin 
industry groups, conservative and corporate interest groups, 
politicians, and other stakeholders described in this report 
using a power map. The power map shows relationships as 
connections between entities, and entities are color-coded 
based on their sector affiliation. We describe entities as 
Bitcoin industry groups and staff, conservative and corporate 
advocacy groups, for-profit companies, PACs, politicians, 
government agencies and staffers, and lobbyists. This 
network is hosted on LittleSis and is interactive following 
the QR code. Users can explore the map and gain additional information about the 
entities represented in this network by clicking the node of interest. 
In addition to descriptions in the report, this interactive map highlights the complex 
web of connections and alliances within and across sectors. Bitcoin industry groups 
are both directly and indirectly affiliated and interacting with conservative groups that 
have a record of spreading climate misinformation, supporting the fossil fuel industry, 
and promoting dangerous environmental policies. Additional stakeholders, like 
politicians, government staffers, and corporations, contribute to the comprehensive 
network and strengthen these relationships.

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  7BITCOIN MINING INDUSTRY AND 
ADVOCACY GROUPS
Expansion of the Bitcoin mining industry and the 
rising value of Bitcoin has propelled industry lobbying 
and the formation of trade associations to protect 
corporate interests from regulation and scrutiny. 
Bitcoin trade groups have taken a page from the 
playbook of the oil and gas and tobacco industries to 
promote greenwashing and downplay environmental 
and public health risks through public relations, 
lobbying, donating to political campaigns, and 
promoting model legislation friendly to the industry. 
Crypto industry groups, and the Bitcoin mining 
companies that support them, have responded to 
growing criticism of Bitcoin’s pollution and waste 
by amplifying greenwashing claims about bolstering 
electricity grids and renewable energy development.6 
For example, some Bitcoin mining advocates assert 
that the industry incentivizes the build-out of 
renewable energy and uses excess energy from solar 
and wind, but Bitcoin mines rarely provide direct 
funding to renewable energy projects and can’t run 
on curtailed energy alone.7 Increased demand from 
Bitcoin mines is actually straining electrical grids and 
increasing electrical rates for regular homeowners.8 
Meanwhile these groups work to prevent regulations 
that would create more transparency about Bitcoin 
miner’s energy use and carbon emissions, and protect 
lucrative incentives and subsidies for Bitcoin miners 
despite the costs to the climate and communities.
Greenpeace investigated the funding, lobbying, 
and staff of these trade groups to see how they 
are connected to broader political movements, 
government insiders and corporate special interest 
groups. We find that Bitcoin industry groups have 
ties to conservative think tanks, policy networks, and 
politicians but few connections to environmental 
organizations and renewable energy advocates despite 
industry claims about supporting sustainability. In 
particular, we find substantial overlap between groups 
advocating for Bitcoin mining and groups backed by 
the conservative billionaire Koch brothers and the ALEC network that push anti-environmental and 
anti-worker policies.9 These groups, often backed 
by the fossil fuel industry, have played a leading 
role in obstructing constructive action on climate 
change, spreading climate disinformation, and trying 
to limit democracy and stifle peaceful protest.10 
For example, ALEC aligned lawmakers have 
supported model bills created by a Bitcoin mining 
advocacy group. In Montana, an ALEC-aligned 
politician sponsored the legislation that limits 
local communities’ oversight of noisy and energy-
hungry Bitcoin mines.11 We also found a revolving 
door between the Bitcoin mining industry and 
government, especially the Trump administration. 
Several leaders of Bitcoin advocacy groups worked 
in the Trump administration while others worked for 
agencies that regulate the electrical grid such as the 
former President and CEO of the Energy Reliability 
Council of Texas (“ERCOT”) who now advises a 
Bitcoin mining company.12 The Trump administration 
rolled back renewable energy programs and 
repealed over 100 environmental policies on clean 
air, water, and wildlife.13Bitcoin trade groups have taken a 
page from the playbook of the oil 
and gas and tobacco industries to 
promote greenwashing and downplay 
environmental and public health risks 
through public relations, lobbying, 
donating to political campaigns,  
and promoting model legislation  
friendly to the industry.

18 MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERSMain Findings:
1) Bitcoin industry groups have ties to conservative 
think tanks, policy networks, and politicians but 
few connections to environmental organizations 
and renewable energy advocates despite industry 
claims about supporting sustainability. 
2) There is substantial overlap between groups 
advocating for Bitcoin mining and groups backed by 
the conservative billionaire Koch brothers and the 
ALEC network that push anti-environmental and 
anti-worker policies. 
3) There is a revolving door between the Bitcoin 
mining industry and government, especially the 
Trump administration.In the following sections, we describe some of the key 
trade associations and industry groups representing 
Bitcoin miners and broader Bitcoin related companies. 
Some of these organizations are focused on Bitcoin 
while others have a broader focus on cryptocurren -
cies and blockchain technologies but also advocate 
for Bitcoin and its wasteful Proof of Work (PoW) 
mining system.
Chamber of Digital Commerce
The Chamber of Digital Commerce (the Digital 
Chamber) is one of the largest and most well-
funded trade groups representing the cryptocurrency 
and blockchain industry, including Bitcoin miners. 
According to the most recent publicly available data, 
the group has over $3.4 million in revenue, much of 
which comes from company membership fees.14 The 
Digital Chamber’s membership includes large crypto 
exchange companies like Binance and other crypto 
services and investment companies as well as many 
of the large Bitcoin miners, including Riot Platforms, 
Marathon Digital, and Core Scientific.15 Some large 
traditional finance companies are also members. 
While the Digital Chamber has a broader focus than 
Bitcoin, the organization supports the Bitcoin mining 
industry and largely denies its negative impacts on 
the climate and communities.16 The Digital Chamber 
has spread industry greenwashing talk points about 
Bitcoin mining boosting renewable energy develop -
ment and reducing methane emissions.17 A Digital 
Chamber blog post states that, “the Bitcoin min -
ing industry is playing a pivotal role in advancing 
America’s energy security in four significant ways: 
grid stability, national security, decarbonization and 
sustainability.”18 Meanwhile, the group has opposed 
legislation to increase transparency, limit subsidies, 
and constrain fossil fuel use for Bitcoin miners, and 
pushes policymakers to support crypto mining.19 The 
Digital Chamber opposed the landmark New York 
state moratorium on new crypto mines connected to 
fossil fuel energy.20 
In September 2023, the Digital Chamber created the 
affiliate Digital Power Network (DPN) to lobby on 
behalf of Bitcoin mining companies and protect the 
industry’s public image through greenwashing about 
ensuring energy stability and advancing energy tran -
sitions.21 The group has fought against state legis -
lation that would create more oversight and reduce 
public subsidies for Bitcoin mining while authoring 
a U.S. Congressional resolution introduced by Texas 
Republican Congressman Pete Sessions supporting 
energy-hungry PoW mining.22 DPN recently announced 
that Ewelina Czapla would serve as Director after 
working at several conservative organizations 
including Director of Climate Policy at Citizens for 
Responsible Energy Solutions and Director of Energy 
Policy at the American Action Forum.23 The American 
Action Forum has opposed robust policies to address 
the climate crisis and advance just transitions such 
as sowing doubt about the Green New Deal.24 Citizens 
for Responsible Energy Solutions has ties to the 
Republican Party and supports conservative and 
market-based solutions to climate and environmen -
tal issues.25 Alex Chizhik is the head of Partnerships 
and has worked in the energy industry including for 
the AES Corporation, a large energy company that 
operates many coal and gas power plants.26 Taylor 
Barr, a policy and advocacy associate, used to work in 
the office of U.S. Senator Steve Daines (Republican, 
MT) who has questioned the scientific consensus on 
human-induced climate change.27

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  9Lobbying and Political Influence
The Digital Chamber has ties to the Republican Party  
and there is a revolving door between the organization’s 
staff and board of advisors with U.S. Congressional 
offices and federal agencies, especially those involved  
with regulating crypto. According to Open Secrets data,  
eight of the fifteen lobbyists for the Digital Chamber 
in 2022 had previously worked in government.28 
Perianne Boring, Founder and CEO of the Digital 
Chamber, is a prominent spokesperson for the crypto 
industry and a regular commentator in the press 
on crypto issues. Boring was previously a televi -
sion anchor for a finance show on RT America, the 
now-defunct Russian funded news channel, and 
worked as a legislative analyst in the Republican-led 
U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013 as 
well as an intern in the Obama White House.29 Cody 
Carbone, VP of Policy, was previously a lobbyist at 
the influential Ernst & Young law firm that represents 
many big trade associations and companies, includ -
ing electric utility and oil gas companies like Exxon 
Mobil, and was a legislative staffer for Republican 
Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey. 30The Digital Chamber’s board includes powerful figures 
with ties to government agencies and politicians. 
President Trump’s former White House Chief of Staff, 
Mick Mulvaney, is on the board of advisors.31 During 
Mulvaney’s tenure in the White House, he was a 
mouthpiece for attacks on science and huge cuts to 
climate and environmental programs.32 He denied the 
science of climate change in a remark during a 2017 
Senate committee hearing: “I’m not yet convinced 
that it is a direct correlation between man-made 
activity and the change in the climate.”33 Christopher 
Giancarlo is also on the board of advisors and is a 
chairman of the United States Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (CFTC) that oversees the lucra -
tive Bitcoin futures market. Another former chairman 
of the CFTC, James Newsome, is also on the Digital 
Chamber’s board of advisors. 
The Digital Chamber is one of the largest crypto 
industry lobbyists, especially after Sam Bankman 
Fried and his FTX empire collapsed. According to pub -
lic data compiled by Open Secrets, the group spent 
$230,000 on federal lobbying in 2023 and nearly $1 
million in 2022.34

110 MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERSIn addition to lobbying on behalf of the crypto indus -
try, the Digital Chamber donates money to political 
campaigns including through a super PAC. During the 
2020 election cycle, the super PAC spent $36,510, 
and in the 2022 cycle spent $15,593 which included 
$10,320 directly to a mix of Republican and Democrat 
federal candidates and $6,700 to Republican PACs, 
including the Davidson Victory Fund supporting Ohio 
Congressman Warren Davidson who is a member 
of the far-right House Freedom Caucus.35 Matthew 
Roszak, Chairman of Bloq – a company that runs 
a Bitcoin mining pool and marketplace for trading 
Bitcoin mining capacity – was a major donor to the 
super PAC, giving over $10,000 from 2019 to 2020.36 
Digital Energy Council
The Digital Energy Council (DEC) was launched 
in August 2023 by a former staffer of the Digital 
Chamber of Commerce and claims to be the voice 
of Bitcoin miners on Capitol Hill advocating for poli -
cies to support the industry.37 DEC promotes Bitcoin 
mining through lobbying and public relations work to 
spin the industry as a boost for national security and 
renewable energy.38 Since the organization is very new, 
there is little public information about its funders, 
expenses, and lobbying and political activities. DEC 
claims that several Bitcoin mining and energy com -
panies are members, but the list of members has not 
been publicly released.39 
The President and founder of DEC is Thomas Mapes 
who worked for and has ties to conservative politi -
cians and anti-environmental groups. In 2021, Mapes 
began working at the Digital Chamber of Commerce 
as Director of Energy Policy before launching DEC. 
Before that, Mapes worked in the Trump administra -
tion’s Department of Energy (DOE) as Deputy and then 
Chief of Staff for the Office of International Affairs 
under Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette.40 The poli -
cies of the Trump DOE were a disaster for the climate 
as the agency promoted liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
exports, supported the coal industry, and suppressed 
research on clean energy.41 Mapes is also connected 
to conservative and corporate interest groups. For 
example, he was a speaker at a 2022 FreedomWorks 
conference on cryptocurrency.42 FreedomWorks is 
a far-right libertarian group funded by conservative 
foundations and big corporations that is influential in 
pushing climate denial and anti-environmental poli -
cies.43 Mapes was a guest on the We Stand for Energy  
podcast which is an industry front group supported 
by the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association 
for U.S. electric utility companies.44 Edison Electric 
has resisted pro-renewable energy policies like net 
metering to encourage rooftop solar development, 
and worked with the American Legislative Exchange 
Council (ALEC) – a notorious corporate dark money 
group that seeks to limit environmental regulations 
among other right-wing priorities.45 
The Blockchain Association
The Blockchain Association is one of the largest 
cryptocurrency trade groups with over $7 million in 
revenue in 2021 and over 100 member companies.46 
The group is a vocal supporter of the crypto industry 
and involved in federal lobbying and policy to sup -
port the industry’s growth. Members include major 
crypto exchanges like Coinbase and other crypto 
investors and service providers as well as some large 
Bitcoin mining companies including Bitdeer and US 
Bitcoin Corp.47 Although the groups’ work is broader 
than Bitcoin, they still defend the dirty and wasteful 
Bitcoin mining industry. The Blockchain Association 
has downplayed Bitcoin’s environmental impact and 
contribution to the climate crisis. For example, their 
website states, “concerns about crypto’s energy 
usage are valid but often overstated, and ignore the 
industry’s hard work to make crypto sustainable and 
support the transition to renewables.”48
The Blockchain Association’s staff and board is 
stacked with former government employees and 
staffers of Congressional offices, including several 
powerful Republicans. The CEO, Kristin Smith, has 
a long history of working for Republican politicians 
and as a lobbyist for powerful firms like the Alpine

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  11Group, VogelHood Group, and Thompson Coburn 
where she represented big corporations from indus -
tries like media and communications.49 Smith was the 
Deputy Chief of Staff for Republican Representative 
Denny Rehberg (Montana) and worked in the offices 
of Republican Senators Olympia Snowe (Maine) and 
Conrad Burns (Montana).50 Smith is also an active 
political donor who contributed more than $160,000 
in the 2022 election cycle which included $50,000 to 
Minnesota Republican Congressman Tom Emmer’s 
joint fundraising committee.51 Emmer is one of the 
most vocal proponents of crypto on Capitol Hill.52 
Allie Nelson, Chief of Staff and Political Director, pre -
viously worked for other polluting industries including 
the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association which rep -
resents beef producers.53 The Executive Vice President 
of Government Relations, Dave Grimaldi, was Senior 
Counsel for the Office of Congressman Jim Clyburn, 
a powerful Democrat from South Carolina, and Chief 
of Staff to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn who 
was appointed by Barack Obama.54 Ron Hammond, 
the Director of Government Relations, had worked 
for national and state-level Republicans includ -
ing Representative Warren Davidson (Ohio) who is 
a member of the House Freedom Caucus and has 
opposed climate change policies, even introducing 
an amendment that would limit the Department of 
Defense’s ability to assess climate risks.55 Hammond 
also worked as a staffer and campaigner for multiple 
Texas state Republicans including Representative Pete Olson who has a dismal record on climate and envi -
ronmental issues.56
The Blockchain Association is a major presence on 
Capitol Hill, spending millions of dollars on federal 
lobbying, and drawing on a revolving door of former 
government staffers. In 2023 the group spent nearly 
$1.5 million on lobbying efforts and $1.9 million in 
2022.57 Of the 12 lobbyists working on behalf of the 
organization in 2023, over 80% had previously worked 
in government.58 The group has lobbied to reduce 
restrictions and oversight of the cryptocurrency 
industry including lobbying on a bill, the Crypto-Asset 
Environmental Transparency Act of 2023, that would 
require Bitcoin mining companies to report about 
their greenhouse gas emissions and electricity use.59 
That bill would be an important first-step in bring -
ing more transparency to the opaque Bitcoin mining 
industry and help ensure regulators, the public, and 
investors are aware of the climate risks from Bitcoin 
mining.60
The organization is also involved in electoral politics 
through its PAC although it has not attracted large 
amounts of money. The PAC has raised $7,500 for 
the 2024 election so far and raised $2,260 for the 
2021-22 election cycle, most of which came from 
executives at crypto companies, especially the Digital 
Currency Group – a venture capital company that 
owned popular crypto media outlet CoinDesk  and 
crypto investment companies Genesis and Grayscale 
Investments.61

112 MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERSBitcoin Mining Council
The Bitcoin Mining Council is a membership 
organization for Bitcoin miners that promotes the 
industry to the public and policymakers, and collects 
proprietary data on mining operations and energy 
use. While the group does not have a large lobbying 
and political presence, it is a voice for the industry 
spreading greenwashing about how Bitcoin mining 
supports development of renewable energy. According 
to the group’s website, there are 53 members who 
represent nearly half of global Bitcoin mining capacity. 
The group’s founding members include many of the 
largest mining companies and mining pools such as 
Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, and Poolin.62 
Companies who join the Bitcoin Mining Council agree 
to share their electricity usage and energy mix data 
for research and educational purposes. However, 
the underlying data is not made public and has not 
been verified by outside experts or regulatory agen -
cies. The group releases quarterly updates on mining 
and energy use which have been used to claim that 
the majority of energy comes from renewables.63 
Independent research contradicts those claims, 
finding that the majority of electricity for the global 
Bitcoin network is generated by fossil fuels.64
The Bitcoin Mining Council was formed when 
Michael Saylor, vocal Bitcoin proponent and CEO of 
MicroStrategy which is the largest corporate holder of 
bitcoin, attended a meeting of miners in 2021 that dis -
cussed energy use. Saylor says he wanted to create a 
permanent forum for promoting transparency, sharing 
best practices, and educating the public about the 
supposed benefits of Bitcoin mining.65 Yet, the data 
collected by the group is not shared openly and pub -
licly, preventing transparency. The group also asserts 
that Bitcoin’s energy use is a feature, not a problem or 
bug, and does not support solutions to reduce energy 
use or make changes to Bitcoin’s consensus mech -
anism. MicroStrategy owns around 140,000 bitcoin 
which is worth approximately $4.4 billion at Bitcoin’s 
price in late 2023, thus the company and Saylor stand 
to benefit from Bitcoin’s price continuing to increase 
and maintaining its current polluting PoW system.66
Satoshi Action Fund
Satoshi Action Fund (SAF) is a new organization 
that has quickly become one of the most vocal and 
active proponents of Bitcoin mining. The groups’ 
aggressive stance promoting the interests of Bitcoin 
miners regardless of local community impacts 
and opposition has even frustrated others in the 
industry.67 The name is taken from the pseudonym 
of the person, or people, who created the concept 
for Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakomoto, reflecting SAF’s focus 
exclusively on Bitcoin and protecting the energy-
intensive PoW system ( more detail on Bitcoin’s PoW 
consensus mechanism in Appendix A) .68 SAF develops 
model pro-Bitcoin mining legislation and promotes 
state-level policies that benefit the industry as well 
as some federal lobbying.69 The group also uses public 
relations and communications efforts to bolster 
the industry’s image and spread greenwashing, 
downplaying the ways Bitcoin mining contributes 
to the climate crisis and harms communities. Since 
SAF is relatively new, launching in 2022, there is little 
public information available on the group’s funding 
and expenditures.70 
SAF’s founders have deep ties to the fossil fuel 
industry, climate denial movement, and right-wing 
groups. The organization was initially registered as a 
nonprofit in Mississippi under the name Energy 45 
Fund with a mission to inform the public about the 
“environmental and economic gains” made under 
the Trump Administration.71 This was an attempt 
to obfuscate how the Trump administration was 
a disaster for the climate and environment. The 
organization’s name changed several more times, but 
not its state business ID number, to Energy Moms in 
October 2021 and then to Alliance for Energy Workers 
in March 2022 before switching names to Satoshi 
Action Fund in May 2022 and focusing on Bitcoin 
mining.72 While this was seemingly a major shift, 
advocating for energy-intensive Bitcoin is consistent 
with promoting the fossil fuel industry as Bitcoin 
provides a lifeline to coal and gas plants. A New 
York Times investigation found that during a podcast 
interview co-founder Mandy Gunasekara, who is

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  13influential in right-wing opposition to climate action, 
said her interest in Bitcoin came from Scott Pruitt, 
a former EPA administrator under Trump with deep 
ties to the fossil fuel industry, suggesting a business 
venture selling electricity contracts to Bitcoin 
miners.73 At a Bitcoin mining conference in 2022, Ms. 
Gunasekara tied her experience with the fossil fuel 
industry to her interest in Bitcoin, “In my time at EPA 
and on Capitol Hill, I worked a lot with the oil and 
gas industry. I feel like that’s a part of my natural 
attraction to the Bitcoin mining space.”74
An article in Politico  described the group’s forma -
tion as a reaction to growing concerns about the 
environmental damage from cryptocurrencies, “with 
Democrats pushing to make climate concerns a focal 
point of digital asset regulation, former EPA Chief of 
Staff Mandy Gunasekara has linked up with noted 
Bitcoin maximalist Dennis Porter to form a new 501c4 
organization that will promote the crypto mining 
industry’s policy efforts around Washington.”75
In 2023, SAF created a sister organization called 
Satoshi Action Education (SAE) to focus on public 
relations and research promoting Bitcoin mining.76 
The two organizations have the same leadership, 
CEO Dennis Porter and Policy Director Eric Petersen, 
and many overlapping board members that includes 
people from the Bitcoin mining industry and some 
with ties to the fossil fuel industry including Justin 
Ballard, an energy attorney who has worked for 
oil and gas companies.77 Yet, there is little publicly 
available information on the group’s funding sources 
and expenses.78 SAE spreads pro-industry messaging 
that often amounts to little more than greenwashing 
through sponsored research and communications 
that compliments SAF’s lobbying and political work.79 
Using industry-sponsored science to obfuscate 
negative environmental impacts is a tactic borrowed 
from the oil and gas, and tobacco industries who have 
used junk science and sophisticated PR campaigns 
to sow doubt about corporate damage to the climate 
and public health.80 Revolving Door with Right-Wing Politicians 
and Advocacy Groups
Our investigation reveals a revolving door between 
SAF’s staff and board members with the Trump 
administration, and right-wing groups that oppose 
action on climate change and spread climate denial. 
SAF was co-founded by conservative power couple 
Mandy and Surya Gunasekara who have lobbied for 
fossil fuel interests and pushed climate denial.81 This 
casts serious doubts on SAF’s claims about advancing 
sustainability and supporting the expansion of renew -
able energy. 
Mandy Gunasekara has a long history of promoting 
climate denial and opposing climate action and 
environmental protections.82 She is currently a 
member of the climate misinformation group the 
CO2 Coalition that is funded by the Koch brothers’ 
network and the Mercer Family Foundation - a major 
donor in the climate denial movement.83 Mandy is 
also a senior fellow at Life: Powered, a pro-fossil fuel 
industry group created by the far-right Texas Public 
Policy Foundation which is connected to climate 
deniers and conservative dark money groups like the 
Atlas Network, and Director of the Center for Energy 
and Conservation at the Independent Women’s Forum 
which has opposed action on climate change and 
has ties to the Koch network.84 Recently, she was 
among a group of hardline conservatives planning 
how to demolish federal regulations and agencies if 
a Republican is elected to the presidency in 2024. At a Bitcoin mining conference in 2022, 
Ms. Gunasekara tied her experience with 
the fossil fuel industry to her interest 
in Bitcoin, “In my time at EPA and on 
Capitol Hill, I worked a lot with the oil 
and gas industry. I feel like that’s a part 
of my natural attraction to the Bitcoin 
mining space.”74

114 MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERSMandy’s chapter in the Heritage Foundation’s “Project 
25” report lays out a corporate wishlist of climate 
change and environmental protection policies to 
slash from car emissions standards to support for 
renewables to the EPA’s environmental justice office.85 
Previously, Mandy worked in the EPA during the 
Trump Administration as principal deputy assistant 
administrator at the Office of Air and Radiation 
under Scott Pruitt and then chief of staff to EPA 
administrator Andrew Wheeler who was previously a 
lobbyist for a coal company.86 Mandy publicly boasted 
about rolling back progress on emissions reductions 
and being the “chief architect of the Paris Accord 
withdrawal and the repeal of the Clean Power Plan.”87 
Before that she was a staffer for Republican Senator 
James Inhofe of Oklahoma and reportedly handed 
him the snowball used as a prop during his infamous 
Senate floor speech in 2015 dismissing human-caused 
climate change.88 
Surya Gunasekara is also connected to the fossil fuel 
industry and right-wing politicians. He held several 
appointed positions during the Trump administration 
including Executive Director of Policy for Homeland 
Security and Senior Counsel, International Affairs 
at the Department of Energy (DOE).89 Previously he 
worked for conservative Republican Congressman 
Jim Renacci of Ohio and several industry groups, 
including the American Petroleum Institute that is a 
major force behind the climate denial movement and 
defender of the dirty fossil fuel industry.90 According 
to data compiled by Open Secrets, Surya has made 
nearly $55,000 in campaign contributions to the 
Republican party, Republican candidates, and aligned 
PACs since 2013, including a donation to far-right 
Congressman Matt Gaetz.91 The Gunasekaras have 
also contributed $4,300 to Republicans running for 
Mississippi state and local offices.92 The couple spent 
around $45,000 on Mandy’s attempted run for Public 
Service Commission as a “constitutional conservative” 
– a term used by the right-wing populist Tea Party 
movement – which ended when the state Supreme 
Court declared her ineligible due to state residency 
requirements.93SAF’s ties to right-wing groups and the fossil fuel 
industry go beyond its founders. At an event during a 
Bitcoin mining conference announcing the launch of 
SAF in 2022, the group’s CEO said they would be going 
to ALEC and State Policy Network conferences.94 The 
policy director, Eric Petersen, worked for Americans 
for Prosperity, a group funded by the Koch Brothers 
and fossil fuel companies that pushes climate denial 
and other anti-worker and anti-democratic policies.95 
Petersen has also worked for other libertarian groups 
including the Institute for Free Speech and the 
Pelican Institute for Public Policy. The Pelican Institute 
is a libertarian think tank in Louisiana that is part 
of the State Policy Network that is aligned with the 
American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) which 
is an architect of state-level attacks on democracy, 
the environment, and workers’ rights.96
When the group changed focus and names to SAF, 
they brought on Bitcoin booster, what some call a 
“Bitcoin maximalist”, Dennis Porter to be the CEO and 
public voice of the organization. Porter’s background 
is unclear and his LinkedIn page only lists being a 
Bitcoiner and self-employed.97 In an interview with 
the Coin Stories podcast sponsored by The Bitcoin 
Conference and Okcoin, Porter describes working 
various jobs including a stint supporting political 
campaigns.98 
SAF staff also promote Bitcoin in right-wing politi -
cal circles and attend conservative conferences and 
events. In summer 2023, CEO Dennis Porter attended 
a conference organized by the State Policy Network 
which is made up of libertarian state groups that, 
among other pro-corporate issues, spreads climate 
denial.99 Porter was reportedly on a panel with Kendall 
Cotton who is the CEO of the Frontier Institute of 
Montana, a libertarian think-tank that promotes cuts 
to government programs and privatization.100 Montana 
state Senator Daniel Zolnikov is on the board of the 
Frontier Institute and sponsored model legislation 
written by SAF ( more on these ties in the following 
sub-section ).

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  15Lobbying and Political Influence
SAF’s political activities and lobbying have ramped up 
quickly since the group’s formation in 2022. SAF says 
it started meeting with federal legislators in 2023, 
beginning with Senators Ron Wyden, Cynthia Lummis, 
and Ted Budd to discuss the Lummis-Gillibrand 
Responsible Financial Innovation Act.101 However, 
the bulk of the group’s efforts are aimed at the 
state level, replicating the playbook of ALEC to push 
model pro-industry bills through state legislatures. 
In 2023, SAF’s model “right to mine” bill that, among 
other things, prevents local entities from enacting 
zoning and noise ordinances for Bitcoin mining oper -
ations, was passed in Montana and Arkansas. New 
Hampshire, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, and 
Virginia have also proposed “right to mine” bills and 
other SAF supported legislation to protect Bitcoin and 
create tax incentives for Bitcoin mining. Our investi -
gation finds that conservative politicians have been 
the primary champions of SAF’s legislation, including 
those with ties to libertarian and big business groups 
like ALEC that resist climate change action and are 
supported by the oil and gas and electrical utility 
industries – industries that could benefit from the 
expansion of energy-hungry Bitcoin mining.
Montana passed SAF’s “right to mine” bill in 2023, 
which also banned additional taxes on bitcoin when 
it’s used as a form of payment.102 The “right to mine” 
legislation, Senate Bill 178 – Protection for Digital 
Mining, was sponsored by Republican Senator Daniel 
Zolnikov.103 The oil and gas industry is the top indus -
try contributing to Zolnikov’s campaigns.104 Zolnikov 
worked for an energy company, Broad Reach Power, 
after leaving the state house in 2020 and until winning 
election to the Montana Senate in 2023.105 Zolnikov is 
also on the board of directors of the Frontier Institute, 
a right-wing libertarian think tank that promotes 
Bitcoin mining and is a member of the ALEC-aligned 
State Policy Network.106 According to campaign 
finance documents, he contributed over $4,000 to 
the Frontier Institute in 2023.107 SAF also spent $11,700 
lobbying in Montana for the legislation and hired 
lobbyist Scott Boulanger, a former Republican state 
senator who had violated campaign laws when run -
ning for office in 2014.108 Boulanger donated $680 to 
Zolnikov’s election campaigns.109

116 MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERSIn Arkansas, the “right to mine” bill was passed in 
April 2023 after just eight days after being proposed 
by Republican Representative Rick McClure and spon -
sored by Republican Senator Joshua Bryant who both 
have ties to conservative advocacy groups and energy 
companies.110 In 2022, McClure received his largest 
single campaign contribution, $5,800, from conserva -
tive evangelical Michael Huckabee, a former governor 
of Arkansas and Republican presidential candidate 
who has spread climate disinformation.111 McClure got 
another large, $3,900, contribution from the Arkansas 
Conservative Legislative PAC which has received 
substantial donations from Koch Industries.112 Bryant 
is also a staunch conservative endorsed by Arkansas 
Right to Life and the NRA.113 In the 2022 election, 
he received $2,800 in campaign contributions from 
the Action Committee for Rural Electrification, the 
PAC for electric co-ops,114 $2,000 from the Arkansas 
Conservative Legislative PAC,115 and $2,900 from Mike 
Huckabee’s HuckPAC focused on supporting conser -
vative candidates across the country.116 
The Arkansas “right to mine” legislation is facing 
backlash from communities living near noisy Bitcoin 
mines and even criticism from Republican state 
lawmakers who are frustrated by how the ability of county and local governments to oversee mining 
facilities has been constrained. One state Senator 
Bryan King, a Republican, has led calls to repeal the 
law and criticized the law for giving Bitcoin miners 
special treatment and protecting them from taxes 
and regulations, like limits on noise.117 
SAF is very active in Texas which has the most 
Bitcoin mining in the U.S. So far in the 2024 election 
campaign season, SAF has spent up to $20,219 on 
lobbying in the state.118 The organization hired lobbyist 
Travis McCormick who worked for several Texas 
Republicans and was a commissioner on the Texas 
Railroad Commission that - despite its misleading 
name - is the main regulator of the state’s oil and  
gas industry and is notorious for its corporate  
friendly policies.119 
In 2023, SAF along with other Bitcoin industry groups 
and companies mobilized to block legislation limiting 
public incentives and subsidies for Bitcoin miners.120 
Senate Bill 1751, which was proposed by a Republican 
state senator, would have capped miner’s enrollment 
in a lucrative demand response program run by the 
grid operator ERCOT that pays industrial energy con -
sumers to reduce usage during high demand. The bill 
would have limited miners to 10% of all participants in

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  17the program, required miners to register with ERCOT 
as “large flexible load,” and prohibited property tax 
breaks to cryptocurrency mining facilities.121 The Texas 
Senate passed the bill with bi-partisan support, but 
died in the House after SAF and other industry groups 
like the Texas Blockchain Council led a big lobbying 
and PR push to kill the bill.122 The legislation never got 
out of the House Committee on State Affairs which is 
chaired by Republican Todd Hunter who has received 
large campaign contributions from an entity called TX 
Bitcoin and other corporate interests including energy 
and fossil fuel companies like Koch Industries, Atmos 
Energy, and CenterPoint.123 
In 2023 a Republican state representative supported 
by the oil and gas industry, Cody Harris, introduced 
a resolution affirming that Bitcoin is welcome in 
Texas and that “individuals who mine Bitcoin in Texas 
will never be inhibited by any law or resolution that 
restricts the practice of securing the Bitcoin net -
work for the safety of the virtual currency.”124 Harris 
has deep connections to right-wing groups and 
dirty industries. Conservative policy organizations 
are his second largest source of campaign funds 
with $216,243. The oil and gas industry has contrib -
uted $70,585 and the electric utilities industry has 
contributed $46,800.125 Harris is also supported by 
Koch Industries.126 These groups and industries have 
resisted policies to cut carbon emissions and phase 
out fossil fuels, and could benefit from Bitcoin’s 
increased electricity and fossil fuel use. Harris’s 8th 
district also includes Corsicana where Riot Platforms 
is developing what is slated to be the biggest Bitcoin 
mine in the world. Local residents have complained 
about the lack of transparency and oversight for the 
project, and the drain on local water resources.127 In 
2022, Harris received a $2,000 campaign contribution 
from Crestline Solutions, a lobbying firm that Riot has 
hired.128
The push for pro-Bitcoin mining legislation in Missouri 
is led by conservative Republican Representative Phil 
Christofanelli who sponsored a “right to mine” bill and 
is backed by corporate money and wealthy right-wing 
activists.129 Conservative policy organizations have 
contributed $18,300 to Christofanelli’s election cam -
paigns. His single largest donor is conservative busi -
nessman David Humphreys who has given $52,600 as 
part of his wider push to influence state politics and drive corporate and libertarian agendas, particularly 
limiting workers’ rights.130 Another wealthy mega-do -
nor, Rex Sinquefield, has also supported Christofanelli 
through $7,200 in campaign donations via the Grow 
Missouri PAC.131 Sinquefield also funds ALEC and 
the right-wing Club For Growth, and was described 
by Politico as “among a small and little-known, but 
powerful, group of big-money donors who have shied 
away from national politics to advance pet policy 
issues in their home states.”132 In 2023 Christofanelli 
received a $2,400 donation from the libertarian 
Aegis PAC run by Aegis Strategic that gets funding 
and support from the Koch Brothers network and is 
tied to Americans for Prosperity and the State Policy 
Network.133 Aegis has opposed some climate change 
policies.134 These donations reflect a long history of 
Christofanelli’s engagement with conservative groups. 
In June 2021 he was named ALEC-Freedom Works 
State Legislator of the Month for his commitment to 
free market policies.135 SAF has also hired four lob -
byists in the state who work for Catalyst, a lobbying 
and PR company that also works for crypto, tech, and 
online betting companies like Coinbase, FanDuel, and 
Uber.136
In Oklahoma, pro-Bitcoin mining legislation was 
sponsored by politicians supported by the oil and gas 
industry and utility companies. Republican Senator 
John Michael Montgomery sponsored the bill before 
resigning in July 2023 to lead a local Chamber of 
Commerce and was a major beneficiary of oil and gas 
company campaign contributions.137 The Oklahoma 
house sponsors were Republican Ryan Martinez 
and Democrat Lataisha Jackson. Before resigning 
in response to drunk driving charges, Martinez had 
received campaign contributions from the oil and gas, 
and electric utility industries, including a $1,000 con -
tribution in 2022 from the International Transmission 
Company that owns and operates high-voltage elec -
tricity transmission networks that could benefit from 
the expansion of Bitcoin mining.138 Jackson has also 
received campaign donations from the electric util -
ities industry. 139 Meanwhile, SAF is lobbying in the 
state, having hired four lobbyists with the firm A&A 
Advocates in 2023 to engage the legislature, governor, 
and attorney general.140 Those same lobbyists also 
work for companies like Marathon Petroleum, Plains 
Pipeline, and Google.141

118 MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERSThe Mississippi politicians advancing SAF aligned 
legislation are also linked to conservative groups and 
corporate money. Republican Senator Josh Harkins 
sponsored a “right to mine” bill and received a 2023 
award from Empower Mississippi that is part of the 
State Policy Network and led by people with ties 
to conservative advocacy groups like Americans 
for Prosperity.142 The sponsor in the House of 
Representatives, Republican Joseph (Jody) Steverson 
has received campaign contributions from utility and 
energy companies, including Mississippi Power Co 
and Koch Industries.143 SAF also hired lobbyist Daniel 
Harrison of Imperium Strategies to promote the inter -
ests of Bitcoin mining companies.144
New Hampshire is a hub of pro-mining Bitcoin legis -
lation pushed by libertarian politicians aligned with 
SAF. In 2023, SAF named Republican New Hampshire 
state Representative Keith Ammon as Lawmaker of 
the Year for supporting numerous pro-Bitcoin bills 
and initiatives in the state.145 Ammon is a conserva -
tive libertarian who supports cutting taxes and social 
services, and promoting school privatization.146 He was 
the Chair, Political Director, and Membership Director 
of New Hampshire Liberty Alliance - a libertarian 
advocacy group that pushes a small government and 
anti-tax agenda and is aligned with the larger national 
libertarian group Americans for Prosperity.147 Ammon 
recently introduced an anti-critical race theory bill 
that would bar schools from endorsing “divisive con -
cepts” and suggesting that New Hampshire—or the 
United States—is “fundamentally racist.”148
Funding
SAF’s increased activity and ability to get model leg -
islation adopted suggests the organization is receiving 
funding and building political connections. There is 
limited publicly available data on the organization’s 
finances, but the group’s social media accounts 
and website reveal some of SAF’s supporters and 
fundraising activities. SAF held a fundraiser at The 
Mining Conference in October 2022 which featured 
Republican U.S. Congressman Pete Session of Texas 
who is a climate skeptic and receives substantial 
campaign contributions from the oil and gas indus -
try.149 At the 2023 Mining Disruption conference, 
SAF hosted a yacht party fundraiser which included 
Richard Jackson, the Deputy Attorney of Oklahoma, where SAF’s model “right to mine” legislation has 
been proposed.150 Jackson had worked as general 
counsel for an oil and gas company and founded a 
blockchain company, EQ Concepts. An October 4, 
2023 fundraising dinner in Oklahoma featured Jackson 
as well as Republican State Senator Natham Dahm 
who is involved with the ALEC network and gets 
contributions from the oil and gas industry, includ -
ing $3,350 towards his 2022 campaign.151 Dahm has 
received scholarships to attend numerous right-wing 
conferences funded by dark money groups including 
the 48th annual ALEC Meeting in 2021, the ALEC States 
and National Policy Summer in 2019, and a Heartland 
Institute conference in New Orleans in 2019.152 
Texas Blockchain Council
The Texas Blockchain Council (TBC) is one of the most 
active and powerful state-level industry associations 
working to promote the interests of Bitcoin mining 
companies. TBC has been influential in getting Texas 
politicians, namely Republicans, to support Bitcoin 
including right-wing leaders like Governor Greg Abbott 
and Senator Ted Cruz. For these conservatives, Bitcoin 
is aligned with their libertarian ideas, support for the 
fossil fuel industry, and resistance to climate change 
action. 
In 2021, the TBC reported revenue of $859,000, largely 
from membership fees which includes Bitcoin mining 
companies, and operating an annual conference.153 
The group’s expenses primarily went towards advo -
cacy, communications, and lobbying. In 2021, the 
TBC spent $389,000 on a public policy group that 
consists of businesses and individuals who promote 
the benefits of blockchain technologies for Texas and 
help pass industry-friendly legislation.154 To assist its 
political efforts, the group spent $47,000 on lobby -
ing, and $79,000 on advertising and promotion. The 
TBC also disclosed holding $20,000 worth of bitcoin, 
so the organization has a financial stake in Bitcoin’s 
value increasing.155

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  19
The TBC’s leadership is connected to conservative 
groups and politicians in the state. Reed Clay, Vice-
President for Public Policy and External Affairs, has 
ties to right-wing Republicans in the state. Clay 
worked as Chief Operating Officer and Deputy Chief 
of Staff for Republican Governor Greg Abbott and 
Senior Counsel to the Attorney General of Texas under 
Republicans Ken Paxton and Florence Shapiro.156 
Clay helped implement Abbot and Paxton’s far-right 
policy agenda to weaken environmental and worker 
protections, promote oil and gas extraction, and 
block reductions in carbon emissions.157 After leaving 
government, Clay became one of the highest paid 
lobbyists in the state as the founder and CEO of 
Crestline Solutions, a lobbying firm that has worked 
for Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Platforms along 
with the fossil fuel and chemical industry with clients 
including Dow Chemical and the Texas Oil and Gas 
Association.158 He is also a Republican donor who in 
2020-21 contributed $20,000 to his old boss Abbott’s 
re-election campaign.159 The organizations’ board of directors and advisors 
also includes several people involved with anti-
environmental right-wing think tanks and the 
Trump administration. Brian Morgenstern is a board 
member and Head of Public Policy at Riot Platforms, 
a large Bitcoin mining company with operations 
in Texas, and worked in the Trump Whitehouse as 
deputy communications director and deputy press 
secretary after serving in the Trump administration’s 
Department of Treasury as deputy assistant secretary 
for external affairs.160 After the Trump presidency, 
he was involved in creating the America First Policy 
Institute to promote the radical MAGA agenda with 
former administration officials including former Texas 
Governor and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry who is 
a booster for the oil and gas industry.161 Morgenstern is 
a vocal defendant of the Bitcoin mining industry and 
has written op-eds that push industry greenwashing 
talking points about supporting renewables and grid 
stability and downplay the climate damage from 
Bitcoin.162 Genevieve Collins sits on the advisory board © Brittany Hallberg / Greenpeace

120 MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERSand is the State Director for Texas at Americans for 
Prosperity, the far-right advocacy group funded by 
corporate interests like the Kochs and the American 
Petroleum Institute that has fought against policies to 
address the climate crisis.163
The TBC’s lobbying activities have focused on protect -
ing the legal status of cryptocurrencies and subsidies 
for Bitcoin miners. Public data shows the TBC spent 
between $116,120 and $319,270 on lobbying since the 
2022 election cycle.164 The group created a political 
action committee, the Texas Blockchain Committee, 
which so far has not been very active, only spending 
around $3,700 in the 2020 and 2022 election cycles.165 
The committee donated $250 to Republican State 
Senator Tan Parker who was a champion of several 
pro-Bitcoin bills. 
TBC’s efforts have paid off with some key political 
victories. HB 1576 was passed which required 
creation of the Workgroup on Blockchain Matters. 
The working group was dominated by crypto industry 
representatives and released an industry-friendly 
report on policy recommendations for the state.166 
The “Virtual Currency Bill”, HB 4474, was also passed creating a legal status for cryptocurrencies.167 TBC 
also worked with mining companies and other 
industry groups to block passage of SB 1751 that 
would have cut incentives and tax breaks for Bitcoin 
miners. The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan 
support, but stalled in the House after TBC, SAF, the 
Chamber of Digital Commerce, and individual mining 
companies mobilized against it, appealing to Governor 
Abbott and other conservative politicians to oppose 
the legislation.168 
TBC also supports the Texas Bitcoin Foundation, 
a nonprofit think-tank that does research, public 
outreach, and education to promote Bitcoin. In 2021,

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  21Bitcoin is the largest and most popular digital crypto -
currency which works outside a centralized authority 
like a bank or government. It operates through a 
decentralized and collectively-maintained database, 
or digital ledger, that provides a record of all Bitcoin 
transactions stored on the blockchain . This process 
requires a mechanism for reaching consensus to 
validate transactions and prevent fraudulent transac -
tions. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism 
in which participants are committed to protecting 
the system’s integrity by putting in work, and thereby 
consuming electricity.172 
To prove their work, miners compete to be the first 
to guess the number that completes a complex 
algorithm. The computers act like random number 
generators and those with more computing power 
can guess more numbers in less time, increasing their 
chances of winning. The winner gets to validate a new 
set, or “block,” of Bitcoin transactions that are added 
to the blockchain and is rewarded with transaction 
fees and newly generated bitcoins.173 
As Bitcoin mining has evolved, miners have expanded 
their computing power. Mining companies use ware -
house-sized banks of specialized computers called 
application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) com -
puters designed solely to participate in the number 
guessing game. The machines are power-hungry 
and require resource-intensive cooling mechanisms. 
Bitcoin mining is estimated to use more electric -
ity than some entire countries, including what the 
Philippines and Sweden consumed in 2019.174 In the 
United States, the seven largest crypto mining com -
panies use the same amount of electricity needed to 
power every residence in Houston, which has a popu -
lation of 2.3 million people.175 Bitcoin’s energy-hungry technology has caused sub -
stantial environmental and social damage. Much of 
the electricity powering Bitcoin mines comes from 
fossil fuels, especially dirty coal. Researchers at 
Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance 
estimate that 62% of the electricity used for Bitcoin 
mining globally in 2022 came from fossil fuels and 
coal was the largest single source. Only 26% of the 
electricity was from renewables.176 Bitcoin mining 
companies have even reopened mothballed coal-
fired power plants while others are using waste coal, 
one of the dirtiest sources of energy.177 Analysis by 
researchers at the nonprofit WattTime for a New York 
Times  investigation found that 34 large crypto mines 
in the U.S. cause nearly 16.4 million tons of carbon 
pollution each year.178
Bitcoin’s energy consumption has kept more coal 
and gas power in our energy mix, in parallel with an 
increasingly urgent need to hasten our transition 
away from fossil fuels.179 Bitcoin’s fossil fuel lifeline 
even extends to companies like ExxonMobil, which is 
exploring how to do Bitcoin mining at fracked oil and 
gas wells.180 By creating new demand for dirty energy, 
Bitcoin mining is accelerating climate change and 
producing GHG emissions. 
Many other, and newer, cryptocurrencies don’t use 
this energy-guzzling process, thus, Bitcoin is far and 
away the most polluting cryptocurrency.181 Ethereum, 
the second most popular cryptocurrency, stopped

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  23Aegis Strategic
Aegis Strategic is a political consulting firm tied to 
the Koch network and run by a former top executive 
at Americans for Prosperity. The group is focused on 
picking and supporting political candidates who are 
aligned with the Koch’s libertarian and pro-corporate 
agenda, which often means supporting fossil fuels 
and resisting action on climate change.

 ◼Mother Jones  magazine published an investigation 
into the group and its ties to the Koch brothers:

aegis-strategic/  Americans for Prosperity
Americans for Prosperity (AFP) and the AFP 
Foundation are nonprofit groups founded by David 
Koch and Richard Fink in 2003 to promote liber -
tarian policies and now has 34 state chapters. AFP 
is largely a front group for the Koch network and 
is also a member of the State Policy Network. AFP 
has a long history of supporting climate denial and 
resisting action to reduce carbon emissions, pollu -
tion, and use of fossil fuels. In March 2011, AFP sent 
memos to U.S. senators to support an attack on 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s lawful 
regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air 
Act. Similarly, AFP California supported Proposition 
23, the ballot attack on state climate legislation that 
was heavily financed by Koch Industries and other 
oil companies. See Greenpeace USA research on 
AFP here: https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/fight -

Exchange Council (ALEC)
ALEC is one of the most secretive and powerful 
corporate lobbying networks in the U.S. that serves as 
a “model-bill factory” for sharing pro-corporate and 
often anti-environment legislation. ALEC corporate 
and political members convene in closed-door 
task forces to draft model templates for legislation 
introduced and pushed through statehouses across 
the country. The Natural Resources Defense Council 
(NRDC) once called ALEC “corporate America’s 
Trojan Horse” for the enormous success that it has 
had in orchestrating a broad spectrum attack on 
environmental, health, and safety standards, as well 
as democratic rights and corporate accountability. 
An estimated 98% of ALEC’s funding comes 
from corporations and well-known conservative 
foundations established by the Koch, Mercer, and 
Coors families, among others. Although many 
companies have left ALEC over disagreements with 
its extremist agenda, others remain. See Greenpeace

According to DeSmog , the Atlas Network is a 
Washington, DC-based non-profit organization that 
says it’s working to support a growing network of 
more than 500 “free market” organizations in nearly 
100 countries promoting free market ideas. Many 
of the member think tanks of the Atlas Network 
have supported climate science denial and have 
campaigned against legislation to limit greenhouse 
gas emissions. The Atlas Economic Research 
Foundation (AERF) was founded by Antony Fisher in 
1981 with the goal of spreading “innovative, market-
based perspectives to issues of public policy” globally. 
In 1955, Fisher had founded the Institute of Economic 
Affairs (IEA), after conferring with free-market 
economist F.A. Hayek. IEA became an influential 
London-based think tank promoting neoliberal ideas 
of limited government and low regulation. It has 
been embroiled in controversy over its secretive 
funding–including funding from U.S. dark money 
operations Donors Trust and Donors Capital–and the 
disclosure of substantial funding from oil giant BP. In 
the U.S, the Atlas network has cosponsored Heartland 
Institute events dedicated to the proposition that 
climate change is not a crisis and has supported 
organizations such as the John Locke Foundation 
that have attacked efforts by state elected officials 
working on climate solutions. The Atlas Network is 
closely linked with the State Policy Network. See

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  25Koch Brothers and Koch Industries
Koch Industries, led by Charles and the-late David 
Koch, is one of the largest private companies in the 
U.S. that began as an oil company but has since 
diversified into a range of industries from fertilizers, 
commodity and financial trading, and forest and 
consumer products. The Koch’s, and their network of 
organizations, have become one of the most pow -
erful forces in U.S. politics and are major lobbyists 
and campaign donors tied to far-right politicians. 
They are also financial kingpins of climate science 
denial and clean energy opposition. This private,

mation/State Policy Network
The State Policy Network (SPN) is both an organiza -
tion and a network of free-market state level think 
tanks and policy organizations that act as a coordi -
nated front for a variety of corporate priorities includ -
ing delaying action to mitigate climate change. SPN 
supports many think tanks that are leading the spread 
of climate change skepticism including the Heartland 
Institute, Cato Institute, and Heritage Foundation. SPN 
has promoted climate science denial conferences 
hosted by the Heartland Institute and circulated 
unscientific reports from Heartland. Coordinating 
around model state legislation introduced by politi -
cians in the American Legislative Exchange Council 
(ALEC, an SPN member), SPN has attacked legis -
lation to address climate change and spur energy 
transitions such as renewable portfolio standard 
laws in at least 15 states. SPN has been funded by 
wealthy families and other foundations tied to big 
corporate interests. See Greenpeace USA research

126 MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERSTexas Public Policy Foundation
The Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) is a 
conservative think tank in Texas that’s part of the 
State Policy Network and supported by corporate 
interests and the fossil fuel industry including the 
Koch Network and ExxonMobil. The organization has 
promoted climate denial and obstruction, and has 
a project called Life:Powered that defends fossil 
fuels, opposes policies to reduce carbon emissions, 
and spreads messaging critiquing the environmental 
movement. TPPF has used litigation and influence 
campaigns to oppose renewable energy development 
and keep fossil fuel plants operating, even outside of 
Texas.
 ◼For more information on TPPF, see Desmog’s 
profile: https:/ /www.desmog.com/texas-public-
policy-foundation/
 ◼New York Times  article on TPPF’s work opposing 
action on climate change: https:/ /www.nytimes.

foundation-climate-change.html  The Club for Growth
The Club for Growth is a nonprofit focused on cutting 
taxes and promoting free-market economic policies 
that was formed in 1999 by influential and wealthy 
conservative leaders. The Club for Growth, and its 
PAC, are among the largest political donors to right-
wing politicians and is very influential in national and 
state politics. The group is a vocal climate skeptic 
and has opposed policies to cut carbon emissions 
and other actions to address the climate crisis, like 
advocating for the U.S. to leave the Paris Climate 
Agreement. The Club for Growth is funded by pow -
erful and wealthy conservative donors like Richard 
Uihlein and Jeff Yass including groups tied to the Koch 
network.

1MINING FOR POWER: CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BITCOIN MINERS, CORPORATE INTEREST GROUPS, AND CLIMATE DENIERS  27The Heritage Foundation
The Heritage Foundation is a nonprofit think tank 
that is well known for its libertarian and free-market 
approach and being a promoter of climate denial. 
It was founded in 1973 by the late Joseph Coors 
(the founder of Coors Brewing) and the late Paul 
Weyrich who played a historic role in transforming 
wealthy people and businesses into major political 
influencers. The group is also a part of the State 
Policy Network. The Heritage Foundation has spread 
climate denial and resisted action to cut back fossil 
fuels. Heritage supported federal approval of the 
Keystone XL pipeline , which benefited Koch Industries  
and other major oil companies. The Heritage 
Foundation has also misinterpreted the impacts of 
climate change on the US economy; twisted news 
reports to justify claims about ‘ climate taxes’ ; issued 
deceptive economic analyses and presentations ; 
and released allegations about economic ruin and 
job losses  from green investments by Congress. See
