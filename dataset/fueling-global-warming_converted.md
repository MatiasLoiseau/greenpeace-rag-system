Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

FOREWORD BY GREENPEACE

In  1997,  the  issue  of  human-induced  climate  change  attracted  unprecedented  attention.
Not  only  are  physical  signs  of  global  warming,  such  as  temperature  change  and  sea  level  rise,
increasingly  apparent,  but  governments  have  agreed  to  a  legally  binding  instrument,  the  Kyoto
Protocol, to begin to address the problem.  How quickly the industrialized world will cut emissions
of the six major greenhouse gases, how  many  of  the  loopholes  negotiated  in  Kyoto  will  remain,
and what role developing countries will play in emissions reductions are all central issues at high
level  climate  talks  in  June  and  November  1998  under  the  Framework  Convention  on  Climate
Change.

Governments'  actions,  policies,  and  spending  are  benchmarks  for  evaluating  their
commitment  to  greenhouse  gas  reductions  and  the  proliferation  of  clean  energy  solutions.
Nowhere is this illustrated more clearly than through continued government subsidization of coal,
oil,  nuclear,  and  other  forms  of  so-called  "dirty"  energy.    These  subsidies  are  increasingly
controversial.    The  World  Bank,  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development
(OECD),  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  the  Economist,  and  other
influential financial publications have all called for their removal or reduction.

In the late 1980s, federal subsidies to oil were more than four times higher than those to all
renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  sources  combined;  subsidies  to  all  fossil  fuels  were  ten
times  higher.    With  the  goal  of  evaluating  existing  patterns  of  government  support,  Greenpeace
commissioned  Industrial  Economics,  Inc.  in  Cambridge,  Massachusetts  to  assess  current  federal
subsidies to U.S. oil.

The  results  of  this  comprehensive,  peer-reviewed  analysis  demonstrate  that  the  federal
government continues to subsidize the oil industry with billions of dollars of taxpayer funds each
year, and that the historic bias in government support against renewables and efficiency is likely to
remain.    Not  only  do  these  subsidies  divert  needed  public  support  for  emerging  clean  energy
technologies, but they often make it more difficult for cleaner fuels to compete in the marketplace.

Notwithstanding  the  tremendous  historical  subsidies  to  fossil  fuels,  this  current  support
directly  undermines  current  and  future  government  policies  aimed  at  reducing  greenhouse  gas
emissions.    The  bias  in  public  support  also  impedes  real  competition  within  deregulated  or
"liberalized" energy markets by distorting relative fuel prices.  The oil industry continues to argue
that  the  high  costs  of  solar  and  renewable  power  mean  that  clean  power  solutions  are  not
economically  viable  in  the  near  to  mid-term.    The  viability  of  these  energy  alternatives  must  be
evaluated taking into consideration the $5 to $35 billion in annual subsidies to oil documented in
this study, as well as the billions in additional support flowing to other fossil fuels both in the U.S.
and abroad.

Eliminating subsidies and incorporating environmental externalities into energy prices are
achievable, market-based solutions that can play an important near-term role in combating climate
change.    It  is  our  hope  that  this  independent,  peer-reviewed  study  will  make  an  important
contribution towards this end.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Despite increasing concerns over climate change and other environmental consequences
of our heavy reliance on oil, the U.S. government continues to subsidize the fuel.  Subsidies to
oil are provided to producers, transporters, and consumers in varied and often subtle ways.  These
subsidies  not  only  cost  taxpayers  billions  of  dollars  per  year,  but  they  often  exacerbate
environmental  damage.    They  can  also  reduce  oil  prices,  suppressing  market  signals  to
governments, oil consumers, and oil producers to begin shifting to alternatives.

This study examines federal subsidies to oil in detail, including policies directly targeted
to the oil sector and a pro-rated share of more generally-targeted provisions.  By highlighting and
quantifying this support, we demonstrate that subsidies continue to play a substantial role in the
U.S.  economy  and  identify  logical  areas  for  reforms  that  can  save  taxpayer  money,  reduce
environmental  damages,  and  help  the  country  to  meet  carbon  reduction  targets.    Our  analysis
includes a broad array of subsidy areas, including tax breaks, research and development support,
subsidized  credit  programs,  defense  of  oil  supplies,  below-market  sale  of  public  oil  resources,
subsidized oil transport, and private sector liabilities that are shifted onto the public.  We have
also analyzed federal levies on oil and deducted these from our subsidy values as appropriate to
obtain  our  net  subsidy  estimate.    Where  available  data  did  not  permit  specific  subsidies  to  be
quantified, we have described them qualitatively.

SUBSIDIES TO OIL ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR

The U.S. government provided net subsidies of between $5.2 and $11.9 billion to the oil
sector  during  1995,  excluding  the  cost  of  defending  Persian  Gulf  oil  supplies.    We  estimate
defense  of  oil  supplies  to  be  worth  an  additional  $10.5  to  $23.3  billion,  demonstrating  the
magnitude of this specific subsidy element.  Thus, our estimate for  net federal subsidies to oil,
including defense, is $15.7 to $35.2 billion for 1995.  Because of the sensitivity of our totals to
the defense subsidy, we present our results both with and without this item.

The  large  range  between  our  high  and  low  estimates  is  indicative  of  the  uncertainty
surrounding some of the data inputs needed to estimate specific subsidies.  Factors contributing
to this range include differences between the cost of subsidies to taxpayers versus their value to
the  oil  industry,  differences  between  data  sources,  and  the  use  of  multiple  methodological
approaches to assess certain subsidies.

LARGEST INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIES TO OIL

Exhibit ES-1 lists the fifteen largest sources of subsidy to the oil fuel cycle at the federal
level.  As shown in the exhibit, the largest non-defense subsidies are worth between $4.5 and $11
billion, over 85 percent of our total non-defense estimates.  Including defense, the fifteen largest
subsidies are worth $15 to $34 billion, more than 95 percent of our totals.  The most significant
of  these  subsidies,  grouped  by  topic,  are  described  below.    A  complete  listing  of  subsidy
elements can be found in Appendix Exhibit A-1.

Defense  of  Persian  Gulf  Oil  Supplies.    Defense  of  Persian  Gulf  oil
shipments  and  infrastructure  comprises  two-thirds  of  the  total  high
estimate,  conferring  a  subsidy  of  $10.5  to  $23.3  billion  per  year.    The
range  represents  the  variation  in  analytical  approaches  used  by  defense
analysts (described in detail in Chapter 4).

Provision of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Stockpiling oil to protect
against  supply  disruptions  provided  between  $1.6  and  $5.4  billion  in
subsidies  to  oil  markets  in  1995  (see  Chapter  4).    The  high  estimate
includes the 1995 increment of compounded interest incurred on the many
years of unrepaid debt.

Tax  Breaks  for  Domestic  Oil  Exploration  and  Production.    Despite
reforms intended to narrow the applicability of tax breaks for oil and gas,
the  industry  continues  to  benefit  substantially  from  tax  subsidies,  as
described  in  Chapter  2.    Three  tax  breaks  benefiting  oil  exploration  and
production (the expensing of exploration and development costs, excess of
percentage over cost depletion, and accelerated depreciation of oil-related
capital)  reduced  oil  industry  tax  payments  by  between  $1.1  and  $2.3
billion during 1995.

Support for Oil-related Exports and Foreign Production.  Tax credits
for  foreign  royalties  paid,  deferrals  of  U.S.  income  taxes  due  for
multinational  oil  companies,  and  credit  subsidies  through  the  Export-
Import  Bank  and  the  Overseas  Private  Investment  Corporation,  provide
between $0.8 and $1.6 billion per year in subsidies for exports and foreign
production.  These provisions are presented in detail in Chapters 2 and 3.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

•

•

•

Provision  and  Maintenance  of  Coastal  and  Inland  Shipping  Routes.
With  a  large  share  of  the  total  tonnage  shipped  through  the  nation’s
waterways  and  ports,  oil  benefits  disproportionately  from  subsidies  to
water infrastructure (see Chapter 3). Reforms over the past ten years have
increased  the  share  of  infrastructure  costs  borne  by  shippers;  however,
substantial  subsidies  remain.  Tax  exemptions  for  bonds  used  for  harbor
construction and spending by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Army Corps of
Engineers  continue  to  provide  subsidies  worth  $600  to  $650  million  per
year to oil.

Unfunded  and  Underfunded  Liabilities.    Inadequate  bonding  and  user
fees for the current stock of onshore and offshore oil operators shift $170
to $550 million in liability insurance premiums from oil companies to the
public each year.   These subsidies are described in Chapter 5.

Royalty Losses.  Due to creative accounting by oil producers and lapses in
auditing  practices  by  some  government  agencies,  the  federal  government
loses at least $80 and $200  million  per  year  in  royalties  (see  Chapter  6).
Adequate  data  were  not  available  to  quantify  the  full  value  of  royalty-
related subsidies.

FEDERAL TAX DATA SUGGEST EFFECTIVE TAX RATES ON OIL REMAIN LOW

Data  on  actual  tax  payments  by  the  largest  oil  companies  indicate  that  the  industry
continues to benefit from substantial federal tax breaks.  As shown in Exhibit ES-2, the average
effective  federal  tax  rate  (i.e.,  taxes  paid  as  a  percentage  of  taxable  income)  on  integrated
operations fell from 21.5 percent during the 1977 to 1981 period to only 11.9 percent  in 1995.
Although the statutory tax rate also fell during this period, the major oil companies continued to
pay taxes at a rate over 20 percentage points below the statutory level.

Tax  breaks  to  industry  remain  a  moving  target.    The  Taxpayer  Relief  Act  of  1997
included two new tax  subsidies  to  oil, as well as one tax break that was not targeted at  the oil
sector, but that benefits oil nonetheless.

AGGREGATE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR OIL, BY ACTIVITY SUPPORTED

Individual subsidies can be classified by the type of activity they encourage, ranging from
support for oil exploration and development to providing regulatory oversight to the oil industry.
As shown in Exhibit ES-3, maintaining secure oil supplies is by far the largest activity supported
by the federal government.  Security concerns, which include the two largest individual subsidies
(the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve  and  defense  of  Persian  Gulf  oil  supplies),  comprise  over  75

*Many federal programs benefiting oil are partially funded by user fees levied on program beneficiaries.  The subsidy
  figures shown in this exhibit have already deducted user fees.  Detailed data on user fees and gross subsidy values
  are provided in the Appendix exhibits.  The final category in this exhibit, "Subsidy Offsets," allows for adjustments to
  account for any additional fees on oil that are not program specific, yet appropriately deducted from gross subsidies.
  No such adjustments were appropriate in 1995.  Exhibit 2-1 further explains our treatment of federal levies.

percent of our estimates if defense of Persian Gulf oil is included, and at least 30 percent of all
non-defense subsidies.  Incentives for oil exploration and production, at over 35 percent of the
total,  are  the  largest  category  of  support  for  non-defense  subsidies  in  our  low  estimate,  and
second largest in our high.

The third largest subsidy activity is support for oil-related transportation, a category often
overlooked.    This  support  primarily  involves  maintenance  of  oil  shipping  routes  and
infrastructure,  and  is  worth  over  $700  million  per  year.    It  is  important  to  remember  that  this
category  includes  only  the  transport  of  oil;  subsidies  to  transportation  systems  that  rely  on  oil
(and which therefore increase the demand for oil) are not included in our analysis.

The remaining subsidy categories each comprise between one and six percent of our total
estimates.    Though  small  on  a  percentage  basis,  the  dollar  value  of  these  categories  is  still
substantial.  For example, transfers to the public sector of liability for properly closing oil drilling
operations were worth as much as $500 million in 1995.

SUBSIDIES IN CONTEXT

Aggregate  subsidy  values  provide  one  perspective  on  the  size  of  oil  subsidies.    It  is
equally important to evaluate their magnitude in the context of oil prices. While not all subsidies
affect prices, these comparisons offer a better idea of the impact subsidies have on consumption
behavior  than  the  aggregate  subsidy  values  alone.    We  have  also  found  it  useful  to  examine
subsidy values in the context of two major policy initiatives within the past decade to modify oil
demand patterns:  the carbon tax and the Btu-tax.  These metrics are shown in Exhibit ES-4.

The  subsidy  metrics  are  evaluated  using  three  scenarios,  reflecting  the  complexity
associated  with  U.S.  government  subsidies  that  partly  benefit  foreign  rather  than  domestic
petroleum:*

•

•

Scenario  1  evaluates  domestic  subsidies  only,  excluding  credit  subsidies
to international banks, defense of Persian Gulf oil supplies, and tax breaks
for foreign operations.

Scenario  2  allocates  a  portion  of  the  foreign  subsidies  to  the  domestic
market, reflecting the fact that some of the foreign oil supported by these
programs is imported into the United States.

*  Both  the  subsidies  (the  metric  numerator)  and  the  petroleum  consumption  figures  (the  metric
denominators) have been adjusted to best reflect the specific scenario.  The consumption figures used for Scenario 1
are  for  domestic  petroleum  only,  and  consumer  expenditures  exclude  the  value  of  imported  oil  prior  to  domestic
refining.  Scenarios 2 and 3 include total U.S. consumption and expenditure data.

•

Scenario 3 sets an upper bound by assuming all subsidies benefit domestic
markets.    Although  in  reality  not  all  the  oil  supported  by  internationally
oriented  programs  reaches  U.S.  markets,  foreign  tax  breaks  and  lending
programs  primarily  benefit  U.S.  corporations,  and  supply  shocks  in  the
Persian Gulf affect the price of all U.S. oil, regardless of its origin.

Subsidies as a Percent of Oil Prices

Subsidies to domestic oil are worth between $1.20 and $2.80 per barrel of domestic crude
consumed.    This  range  is  equivalent  to  roughly  3  to  6.5  percent  of  consumer  expenditures  on
petroleum products in 1995.†   The  range  is slightly  lower  in  our  second  scenario,  although  the
uncertainty  associated  with  the  values  suggests  that  the  differences  would  probably  not  be
statistically significant.

In our third scenario, total federal subsidies for oil are equivalent to as much as 17 percent
of U.S. consumer expenditures on petroleum.  In addition, the subsidy intensity of imported oil is
much higher than domestic production.  These results indicate two important points.  First, if a
significant portion of  the  benefits  of  subsidies  to  foreign  production  flows  back to the  U.S.  oil
sector,  subsidy  reform  would  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  consumption  decisions.    Second,
domestic oil would become more competitive with imports, resulting in some marginal oil wells
becoming economic again.

Subsidy Intensity in the Context of Proposed Oil Taxes

Tremendous  attention  has  focused  on  efficient  mechanisms  to  reduce  the  impact  of
climate  change.    Taxes  on  carbon  are  an  oft-suggested  tool  to  “get  the  prices  right”  (i.e.,  to
internalize  environmental  externalities)  in  energy  markets.    A  number  of  economists  have
estimated  economically  efficient  carbon  tax  levels  that  would  begin  the  transition  to  lower-
carbon fuels.  Their results suggest median values of between $9 and $14 per ton.‡

†  Because  our  subsidy  estimates  are  net  of  user  fees,  we  have  adjusted  expenditure  data  to  eliminate  the

portion of prices attributable to the various fees on oil.

‡  Values  are  estimates  for  the  1990-2000  period;  studies  generally  show  the  efficient  tax  rate  rising  over
time.  The calculated tax values are set at a rate such that the marginal cost of carbon-emitting activities reflects the
estimated  damage  these  activities  cause  the  environment.    We  use  a  median  carbon  tax  estimate  rather  than  an
average because the source of our data contained an outlier, $142.50 per metric ton of carbon (1995 dollars), that
exceeded  all  of  the  other  estimates  by  more  than  a  factor  of  six.    Carbon  tax  rate  data  are  from  five  studies
(Nordhaus,  Cline,  Peck  and  Tiesberg,  Fankauser,  and  Maddison)  summarized  in  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on
Climate  Change,  Climate  Change  1995:  Economic  and  Social  Dimensions  of  Climate  Change,  Contribution  of
Working Group III to the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC, Cambridge University Press, 1996, Table 6.1, p.
215.

ES-9

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Our  three  subsidy  scenarios  suggest  that  federal  oil  subsidies  are  worth  $7.50  to  nearly
$60 per ton of carbon emitted from U.S. petroleum consumption.  While subsidy removal should
not be substituted for a carbon tax, since the latter is aimed specifically at mitigating externalities
associated  with  fossil  fuels,  the  comparison  is  instructive.    The  relative  size  of  the  values
suggests that even without the political will to implement a carbon tax, phasing out oil subsidies
could help to improve the price signals that now exist within oil markets.  In addition, the fact
that  the  subsidy  intensity  actually  exceeds  these  carbon  tax  values  underscores  the  market
distortions  that  would  remain  if  carbon  taxes  were  implemented  without  concurrent  subsidy
reform.

A comparison to proposed taxes on Btus (British thermal units) illustrates a similar point.
Btus measure the heat content of a fuel.  During 1992 and 1993, the U.S. Congress proposed a
Btu-based tax on energy.  In addition to raising revenues, proponents argued that the tax would
ensure that energy prices reflected the environmental impacts associated with the production and
consumption  of  particular  fuels.    The  proposed  tax  rate  set  for  oil  was  $0.31  per  million  Btu
(scaled to 1995 dollars).  In comparison, oil subsidies for 1995 ranged from 50 to 325 percent of
the proposed tax value, depending on the scenario.  Had the tax been implemented, much of the
hoped for benefit in terms of price signals would merely have offset distortions already in place
from federal subsidies to oil.  Environmental externalities still would not have been reflected in
oil prices.

Summary

The evaluation of subsidies in the context of the oil market demonstrates that subsidies to
oil  are  important  and  probably  impact  oil  consumption  decisions.  Eliminating  subsidies
throughout  the  fuel  cycle  will  help  clarify  price  signals  at  every  stage  of  the  production  chain,
improving  economic  efficiency.    In  conjunction  with  externality-based  taxes,  the  price  of  oil
would begin to provide suppliers, consumers, and governments much more accurate information
with which to adjust their economic decision making.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The impacts  of  oil subsidies merit greater  attention  as  the  world  tries  to  shape  a  global
climate  change  strategy  and  address  the  many  competing  needs  for  scarce  government  funds.
While it has long ago been recognized  that  oil prices  do not  reflect the  environmental  costs  of
petroleum  consumption,  our  analysis  shows  that  prices  do  not  even  reflect  the  direct  costs  of
petroleum  production.    At  a  time  of  tight  fiscal  constraints  and  cuts  to  social  programs,  the
government should not spend billions of dollars every year to subsidize oil and the environmental
problems that result from its consumption.

The costs of supplying oil should fall on the user, not on the general taxpayer.  Continued
subsidization  of  oil  makes  little  sense.    Subsidies  to  the  oil  fuel  cycle  distort  oil  exploration,
production  and  consumption  decisions;  reduce  the  incentive  to  develop  substitutes;  intensify
environmental degradation; and cost taxpayers billions of dollars per year.  Our analysis suggests

ES-10

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

that  subsidy  reform  can  be  a  positive  force  in  achieving  environmental  improvements  and
substantial  fiscal  savings,  while  also  eliminating  the  price  distortions  that  hinder  economic
efficiency.   Furthermore,  our  analysis  suggests  that  the  magnitude  of  subsidies  is  large  enough
that they can impede the efficacy of other policy reform efforts (such as carbon taxes) if ignored.

The  historically  low  oil  prices  now  in  effect  provide  a  tremendous  opportunity  for
governments  to  phase  out  their  oil  subsidies  with  minimal  inflationary  risks.    To  help  this
process, efforts to characterize, report, and remove oil subsidies need to be intensified.  Based on
our  analysis,  we  make  the  following  recommendations  for  structural  change.    To  reduce
economic dislocations, many of these reforms should be phased in over time.

1)  Decouple  oil  subsidies  from  rural  economic  development.    Many  subsidies  to  oil
exploration and production are justified on the grounds that they provide jobs and livelihoods
for  isolated  rural  populations.    Data  suggest  that  development  policies  focused  on  natural
in
resource  extraction  have  rarely  been  successful.
telecommunications  and  computer  technology  provide  an  increasing  range  of  development
options for geographically  isolated communities.   By decoupling oil development and jobs,
governments  can  stop  subsidizing  environmental  degradation  and  work  to  create  cleaner,
higher value job opportunities for rural populations.

  In  addition,  rapid  advances

2)  Internalize  oil-related  defense  costs  into  market  prices.    Where  governments  choose  to
intervene  in  oil  markets  to  ensure  the  security  of  supplies,  the  costs  of  this  intervention
should be recovered through a user fee on oil consumers. Given the magnitude of these costs,
excluding  them  from  the  price  of  oil  creates  significant  and  undesirable  distortions  in
consumption behavior.

3)  Treat the Strategic Petroleum Reserve like a formal government enterprise.  SPR costs
taxpayers  billions  of  dollars  per  year  in  direct  costs  and  foregone  interest.    The  Reserve
should be treated as a government enterprise, financed through taxes on oil consumption and
formally held responsible for repayment of invested capital plus interest.

4)  Include  subsidy  reform  as  an  integral  element  in  strategies  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of
climate  change.    Taxing  emissions  makes  little  sense  if  governments  simultaneously
continue to subsidize fossil fuels.  Subsidy identification, reporting, and removal should be an
integral part of climate change mitigation programs.

5)  Improve the transparency of oil leases on public lands so terms can be easily compared.
Subsidized lease terms can provide large benefits to oil producers at the taxpayers' expense,
and  the  resulting  acceleration  in  oil  development  creates  or  aggravates  environmental
problems.  Leasing of public oil reserves should be done in a transparent manner at both the
federal  and  state  levels.    Environmental  groups  should  work  with  the  relevant  government
agencies to develop a standard disclosure form to be completed for each sale.  Modification
of  lease  terms  should  also  be  reported  in  a  standardized,  publicly  available  format.    This
disclosure  form  will  ensure  that  lease-related  subsidies  are  visible  and  that  lease  terms  are
comparable  across  sales.    Given  the  international  nature  of  oil  markets,  the  goal  of  this
disclosure system should be to allow international comparisons of lease terms.

INTRODUCTION

CHAPTER 1

Despite increasing concerns over the environmental consequences of our  heavy  reliance
on  oil,  the  U.S.  government  continues  to  subsidize  the  fuel.    Subsidies  to  oil  are  provided  to
producers, transporters, and consumers in varied and often subtle ways.  These subsidies not only
cost  taxpayers  billions  of  dollars  per  year,  but  they  often  exacerbate  environmental  damage.
They  can  also  reduce  oil  prices,  suppressing  market  signals  to  oil  consumers  to  decrease
consumption and begin shifting to alternatives.

This  study  examines  federal  subsidies  to  oil  in  detail.    By  highlighting  and  quantifying
this  support,  we  demonstrate  that  subsidies  continue  to  play  a  substantial  role  in  the  U.S.
economy and highlight logical areas for reforms that save taxpayer money, reduce environmental
damages, and potentially help the country to meet carbon reduction targets.

1.1

SUBSIDY BASICS

Subsidies  represent  government  policies  that  benefit  particular  sectors  of  the  economy.
Government subsidies are common in most countries and benefit many industries.  When these
subsidies  reduce  the  prices  of  natural  resources  or  natural  resource  intensive  products,  they
encourage additional pollution and habitat destruction.  An overview of subsidy basics will make
the rest of this report easier to understand.

•

•

Subsidies  are  not  just  cash.    A  great  deal  of  market  activity  involves
controlling  and  sharing  the  risks  and  rewards  of  economic  activities.
Subsidies  are  government-provided  goods  or  services,  including  risk-
bearing,  that  would  otherwise  have  to  be  purchased  in  the  market.
Subsidies  can  also  be  in  the  form  of  special  exemptions  from  standard
required payments (e.g., tax breaks).

Defining  the  baseline.    Subsidies  must  often  be  measured  against  some
baseline.  What would taxes owed have been in the absence of this special
tax break?  How much would industry have had to pay in interest to build

1-1

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

that  new  facility  if  the  government  had  not  guaranteed  the  loan?    Our
baseline  assumes  standard  corporate  tax  rates  and  no  special  agency
programs to finance or absorb market risks for oil-related endeavors.

•

Subsidy  targeting.    One  issue  related  to  defining  a  baseline  is  that  of
narrowly  targeted  subsidies  versus  more  broadly  targeted  programs  that
benefit  oil  as  well  as  some  other  industries.    Industry  representatives
inevitably conclude that only subsidies directly targeted at the oil industry
should  count  as  benefits  to  oil  producers  or  consumers.    In  fact,  many
other  subsidies  tilt  the  energy  playing  field  towards  oil  even  if  other
industries  also  benefit.    It  is  useful  to  consider  a  handful  of  common
subsidy targeting approaches.

•

•

•

•

Single  sector.    The  clearest  and  easiest  subsidies  to  identify  and
allocate  are  those  directly  targeted  to  the  oil  industry,  such  as
government  financing  of  oil-related  research  and  development
programs through the Department of Energy.

Multiple  sectors.    Other  subsidies  are  beneficial  to  a  number  of
economic  sectors,  including  oil.    For  example,  the  oil,  gas,  and
hard  rock  minerals  industries  are  all  eligible  for  the  percentage
depletion  allowance  (discussed  in  Chapter  2).    Since  many  other
energy  sources  do  not  benefit  from  this  provision  (and  the  rates
vary even for those that do benefit), the policy contributes to inter-
fuel market distortions.

Geographic region.  Most state and local subsidies are targeted to
particular  geographic  regions  (i.e.,  the  state  or  locality).    To  the
extent  that  natural  resource  intensive  industries  are  located  in  the
region  receiving  the  subsidy  (for  example,  corporate  tax  rate
reductions in a large, oil producing region), policies can encourage
incremental  pollution  and  the  development  of  “subsidy  clusters”
that rely on continued subsidization to survive.

Factor  of production.  Some subsidies  are targeted at  a  particular
factor  of  production  (e.g.,  labor,  capital)  instead  of  specific
industries.    Although  broadly  available  to  all  industrial  sectors,
subsidies  affecting  factors  of  production  can  cause  market
distortions  nonetheless.    Accelerated  depreciation  provisions,  for
example, allow any industry using capital equipment to deduct the
capital from taxes more quickly than the anticipated service life of
the  capital  asset.    These  provisions  give  capital  intensive  energy
types  a  competitive  advantage  over  types  that  require  less  capital
investment,  such  as  some  demand-side  management  options.    In

1-2

•

•

•

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

addition,  sector-specific  depreciation  rules  in  the  tax  code  can
create  additional  distortions  between  different  capital-intensive
energy sectors.

Externalities  are  extra.    While  environmental  externalities  such  as
pollution  certainly  constitute  subsidies  to  industry,  many  subsidy  studies
(including this one) do not analyze them.  The uncertainty regarding their
value  is  larger,  and  authors  often  wish  to  focus  on  the  many  ways  that
government  subsidies  directly  help  polluting
  Properly
functioning  markets  would  both  eliminate  internal  subsidies  to  oil  and
include a tax equal to the remaining externalities.

industries.

Treating offsets.  In addition to providing subsidies, the government also
levies fees on oil.  While subsidies act to distort energy markets in favor of
oil, certain fees may have the opposite  effect,  and are properly  treated as
offsets  to  subsidies.    Our  basic  approach  for  calculating  net  subsidies  is
shown  in  Exhibit  1-1.    Where  fees  represent  standard  treatment  of  all
industries, they are not considered subsidy offsets.  Where a fee is levied
only  on  oil  (or  on  oil  plus  a  few  other  sectors),  it  must  be  evaluated
further.  Many of these fees are earmarked to pay for government activities
such  as  oil  spill  cleanup  or  the  remediation  of  contamination  from
underground  gasoline  storage  tanks.    If  the  levies  pay  for  oil-related
government activities, then they are treated as user fees rather than subsidy
offsets  and  they  are  credited  against  the  oil-related  government  program
spending  that  they  support.    To  the  extent  that  a  particular  fee  is  levied
only on a few industries (including oil) and receipts do not support an oil-
related purpose, it is referred  to as  a  special  tax.    Special  taxes  are  extra
charges on oil that do not pay for activities related to the industry.  Thus,
they  offset  subsidies  by  decreasing  oil’s  competitive  advantage.    We
subtract  special  taxes  from  our  gross  subsidy  numbers.    Exhibit  2-1
provides  a  flow  chart illustrating how to differentiate  these  various  types
of fees.

Linkage  between  subsidy  levels  and  oil  prices.    In  the  aggregate,
subsidies  throughout  the  world  to  the  oil  fuel  cycle  depress  oil  prices,
encouraging overconsumption.  However, not every individual subsidy has
an  impact  on  oil  prices.    Many  subsidies  to  domestic  oil  producers,  for
example,  simply  keep  these  producers  competitive  with  less  expensive
imports  (which  are
through  a  variety  of
themselves  subsidized
mechanisms).  Subsidies that have little or no effect on commodity prices
will  not  likely  change  consumption  patterns  for  oil.    However,  removing
even  these  subsidies  will  affect  the  market  behavior  of  oil  producers.
Their removal will also save taxpayers money.

1-3

•

Cost to taxpayers versus value to recipients.    The cost  of  a  subsidy  to
taxpayers does not necessarily equal the value of the subsidy to recipients.
Many  government  loan  programs,  for  example,  allow  corporations  to
borrow  funds  at  the  lower  interest  rates  obtained  by  the  U.S.  Treasury.
Such loans do not directly cost the taxpayer but they have an incremental
benefit  to  the  industry  that  we  try  to  measure  here.    In  contrast,
government  programs  may  be  inefficient  and  unproductive.    Thus,  while
the programs cost the taxpayer a great deal of money, industry may value
them  at much less than  their direct cost.   We were  unable  to  incorporate
this latter category in our analysis.

Exhibit 1-1

CALCULATING NET SUBSIDIES TO OIL

Calculating the net subsidies to oil involves three  main steps, shown  below.   Instead of
deducting  aggregate  user  fees,  as  shown  in  Step  2,  we  have  deducted  each  user  fee  from  the
specific  federal  program  it  supports.    This  approach  does  not  affect  the  resulting  aggregate
figures, but provides more detail on individual program subsidies.

1)  Measure total federal subsidies to the oil fuel cycle:

+ Subsidies directly targeted to oil
+ Pro-rated portion of more broadly targeted programs to reflect oil's share
= Gross subsidies to oil

2)  Deduct fees collected from the oil industry and oil consumers:

- User fees collected from the oil sector to pay for oil-related government activities
- Fees levied only on the oil industry, but that support non-oil activities ("special taxes")
= Gross offsets

3)  Calculate net subsidies to oil

+ Gross subsidies to oil
+ Gross offsets
= Net subsidies to oil

SCOPE, METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS

This  report  focuses  on  subsidies  to  oil  throughout  its  entire  fuel  cycle,  including  oil
exploration,  development,  transport,  refining,  and  consumption.    The  report  also  includes
research and development, decommissioning, and remediation related to these stages of the fuel
cycle  wherever  possible.    Subsidies  evaluated  include  federal  agency  activities,  tax  breaks,
resource  sales,  liability  shifting,  and  below-market  insurance  programs.    Programs  benefiting
more than the oil sector, as outlined in the “Subsidy Basics” section above, have been included in
our estimates,  and in every case have been pro-rated to reflect  only  the  portion  accruing  to
oil.  We have  also  included incremental  reductions in state taxes  attributable  to  the  federal  tax
breaks, and post-closure liabilities associated with oil well abandonment that are regulated at the
state level, but not sufficiently funded by state-level user fees at this time.

We have chosen fiscal year 1995 as the base for our estimate, partly to allow for lags in
data availability and partly so that our figures will be comparable to Greenpeace’s estimates of
European energy subsidies.1

To address the complexity of government programs that support oil, we have adopted the

following conventions in how we classify and report our data:

•

Gross  and  Net  Subsidy  Numbers.    Many  government  programs  of
benefit  to  oil  are  at  least  partially  funded  through  user  fees  on  industry.
This fact represents significant progress over the past 20 years in charging
industries  a  higher  percentage  of  the  cost  of  government-provided  goods
and  services  that  are  required  by  activities  of  those  industries.  While
fiscally  prudent,  the  user  fee  approach  can  sometimes  create  a  system  in
which  specific  government  offices  rely  on  industry  user  fees  for  their
continued  existence,  increasing the risk of cooption.   For this  reason,  we
track  gross  subsidy  values  for  each  program  evaluated,  and  identify
programs  with  high  user  fee  collections  and  potentially  higher  cooption
risks.2  However,  gross  numbers  alone  overstate  the  effective  transfer  of
wealth from government to the oil industry.  Thus, our primary focus is on
net  subsidy  numbers,  deducting  special  taxes  and  user  fees  from  gross
subsidy values when it is appropriate to do so.3

1 Elisabeth Ruijgrok and Frans Oosterhuis, Energy Subsidies in Western Europe, Amsterdam: Greenpeace

International, May 1997.

2  A  reliance  on  user  fees  does  not  mean  cooption  occurs  per  se.    In  addition  to  the  magnitude  of  fees
collected  as  a  percentage  of  the  program  budget,  the  risk  of  cooption  rises  where  funds  collected  are  fed  directly
back into local operations rather than to the U.S. Treasury.

3  While  special  taxes  on  oil  may  offset  the  aggregate  subsidies  to  the  industry,  they  may  affect  different
activities  than  subsidies.    Therefore,  subsidies  and  special  taxes  may  not  counteract  each  other.    For  example,
subsidies  may  encourage  increased  oil  exploration  and  development  even  though  special  taxes  further  down  the
supply chain affect oil transport or refining.

Range  Estimates  to  Bound  Uncertainty.    We  have  used  high  and  low
estimates  for  many  of  the  programs  included  in  the  analysis.    This
variation reflects differences in analytic approaches or data  sources.    The
origin of very large variances between the high and low values on specific
items is explained in more detail in the report.

Separation  of  Domestic  Subsidies  to  Foreign  Oil  from  Subsidies  to
Domestic  Oil  in  our  Discussion  of  Results.      While  both  foreign  and
domestic  subsidies  cost  the  taxpayer  money,  their  impact  on  the  market
differs.    We  present  domestic  subsidies  to  foreign  oil  separately  from
support for domestic oil to make our results more useful to readers.

Separate  Reporting  of  the  Cost  of  Defending  Oil  Shipments.    Our
aggregate  subsidy  values  are  quite  sensitive  to  the  estimated  cost  of
defending  Persian  Gulf  oil  shipments,  as  these  costs  are  as  large  as  all
other  programs  combined.    As  a  result,  we  provide  aggregate  data  both
with  and  without  these  defense  costs  so  that  policy  analysts  can  more
clearly see the impact of non-defense subsidies.

Our  analysis  is  subject  to  a  number  of  caveats.    First,  by  focusing  only  on  oil  we  are
unable  to  present  a  holistic  picture  of  the  distortions  that  energy  subsidies  have  caused  in  the
marketplace.   Second, we do not  attempt to  quantify  the  impact  of  subsidies  on  prices  and  the
effect  subsidy  removal  might  have  on  long-term  energy  production  or  consumption  patterns.
Third, we were unable to analyze every federal agency involved with oil due to the limitations of
the available budget information.  Exhibit 1-2 lists the programs that were not analyzed.  Fourth,
we  did  not  evaluate  oil-related  environmental  externalities  or  exemptions  from  environmental
laws.    Fifth,  while  we  analyze  subsidies  to  fuel  transport,  we  do  not  analyze  subsidies  to
transportation  systems  overall,  even  though  these  likely  increase  the  demand  for  oil.    Had  we
done so, our subsidy estimates would be higher.  Finally, any change in economic structure will
cause short-term economic dislocations, including job losses in some parts of the economy and
job  gains  in  others.    Evaluating  the  magnitude  and  distribution  of  these  dislocations  was  also
beyond the scope of our analysis.

REPORT STRUCTURE

The remainder of this report is organized topically to enable sometimes complex subsidy
mechanisms  to  be  explained  in  greater  detail.    Chapter  2  provides  an  overview  of  federal  tax
subsidies to, and special taxes on, the oil fuel cycle.  Chapter 3 examines government programs
directly  supporting  oil  or  required  to  oversee  the  oil  industry.    These  include  research  and
development,  construction  and  maintenance  of  transportation  infrastructure,  oversight  of  the
industry, and credit subsidies for oil-related exports and foreign investment.

Chapter 4 examines government spending to defend oil supplies, including defense of oil
shipping  and  the  cost  of  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve  oil  stockpile.    Chapter  5  evaluates
unfunded liabilities associated with oil spills and the proper closure of oil-related infrastructure.
Chapter  6  examines  the  issue  of  oil  leases  in  detail,  and  explains  how  governments  provide
subsidies to producers through lease sale practices and lease terms.  This chapter also examines
the various government programs in place to manage oil production on federal lands.  Chapter 7
presents  our  summary  findings  and  our  recommendations  for  policy  changes.    Detailed  tables
used to derive our estimates are contained in the Appendix.

FEDERAL TAX SUBSIDIES AND SPECIAL TAXES ON OIL

CHAPTER 2

Tax subsidies result from selective tax legislation that benefits particular groups of people
or industries in the economy.  In effect, they share the costs of certain actions between the private
sector  and  the  government,  impacting  investment  decisions  by  increasing  the  expected  returns
associated with a particular pattern of economic activity.  Tax subsidies take a variety of forms.
Credits allow certain expenditures to be deducted from taxes owed.  Reductions in the tax rate
lower the percentage tax levels on particular activities relative to standard levels.  Reductions in
the  taxable  basis  maintain  the  standard  percentage  tax  rate,  but  allow  higher  than  normal
deductions from taxable income.  Finally, alterations in the taxable entity may allow shifting of
income and expenses in ways not normally allowed to reduce the tax burden.4

Tax  subsidies  directly  targeted  at  oil  production  are  the  easiest  provisions  to  identify.
However, many provisions available to a broader range of economic activity also benefit the oil
sector.   This  latter  class  of  provisions  are  still  properly  included  in  our  analysis  of  oil  because
other  types  of  economic  activity  that  could  substitute  for  oil  are  placed  at  a  relative  economic
disadvantage. Whenever we have included more broadly targeted tax breaks in our assessment,
we have pro-rated the subsidy so that numbers included in the report reflect only oil’s share. The
degree of distortion in economic activity from tax subsidies varies from provision to provision.
In general, greater distortions in economic decision  making  are  likely  to  result from  provisions
that narrowly target beneficiaries and create large divergences from the standard tax rates paid by
other entities in the economy.

Politicians often argue that tax breaks are costless.  They are not.  Although tax breaks do
not require outlays from the U.S. Treasury, they reduce baseline tax revenues, funds that must be
raised  in  other  ways,  often  from  other  economic  sectors.    In  addition,  tax  breaks  can  create
economic distortions that encourage inefficient or unwarranted investment.  For example, in the
early 1980s, provisions allowing for highly accelerated depreciation of nuclear plants permitted
much of the 40-year investment to be written off in a period of less than ten years.5  The larger

the amount that actual service life exceeds the tax depreciation period, the greater the portion of
the capital risk associated with these investments borne by the federal government.  As occurred
with  nuclear  power  plants,  this  reduces  the  normal  market  signals  that  encourage  investors  to
seek alternatives with shorter, less risky paybacks.  Although tax subsidies to oil are not as severe
as this example, their impact on market signals is the same.

Evaluating  net subsidies  to  oil  requires  examining  both  tax  breaks  and  special  taxes  on
oil.  Our approach to categorizing the various federal levies on the oil industry is summarized in
Exhibit  2-1.    Where  taxes  that  are  specific  to  the  oil  industry  are  used  for  general  revenue
purposes, they are treated as a  special  tax  and  netted  from  total  subsidy  values.    However,  not
every  levy  on  oil  is  a  “special  tax.”    Many  levies  are  earmarked  for  a  specific  purpose  that
benefits the production or sale of oil, or ameliorates a problem related to the oil fuel cycle.  In
essence, they reimburse the government for services to the industry.  Examples include fees for
leaking underground storage tanks, oil spills, and road building.6 So long as these funds are used
for  their  stipulated  purpose  and  pay  interest  on  any  unused  balances,  they  are  not  counted  as
special taxes, but are rather viewed as user fees.  User fees are treated as offsets to the costs of
programs  they  support.    Other  oil-related  payments,  such  as  royalties  (discussed  in  detail  in
Chapter  6),  are  also  not  considered  special  taxes  because  they  reflect  a  return  to  the  resource-
owner for selling the oil in question.

The  remainder  of  this  chapter  examines  federal  tax  breaks  and  special  taxes  for  oil  in

more detail.

2.1

FEDERAL TAX BREAKS TO OIL

We present tax breaks to oil in two ways.7 The first section examines specific provisions
that benefit oil, using data from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the U.S. Treasury to
estimate the value of the subsidies they provide.  The second section provides a rough measure of
the  aggregate  value  of  all  tax  breaks  using  data  on  the  overall  taxes  paid  by  the  major  oil
companies.  These sections represent alternative approaches to estimate the value of subsidies to
the industry; they are not additive.

6 Oil is generally viewed as a primary beneficiary of new road construction.  This reflects the fact that oil is
virtually the only fuel used in road transport and because use of oil for this purpose is by far the fuel’s major market,
nearly three times the next largest market, that of home heating oil.

7 Tax breaks are also called tax expenditures to reflect their cost to the government.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

2.1.1    Major Tax Provisions Benefiting Oil

Tax  expenditure  estimates  are  made  on  an  annual  basis  by  both  JCT  and  the  Treasury.
The two organizations prepare their estimates independently and often do not agree on estimated
tax losses.  Both sources develop estimates using a revenue loss approach, which estimates how
much additional revenue the Treasury would collect in the absence of particular tax provisions,
and best reflects the cost to taxpayers for these provisions.8  The Treasury also develops a second
set of estimates using an outlay equivalent approach.  Outlay equivalents reflect the fact that tax
breaks convey tax-free benefits.  The approach measures the amount that would have to be paid
to the taxpayer to derive the same after-tax income as obtained under the revenue loss approach.
For this reason, the outlay equivalent approach best reflects the value of the breaks to industry.

We have pro-rated the tax expenditure estimates to reflect their value to the oil industry.
The exhibits that follow include both a high and a low estimate for many of the provisions, and
this range can be fairly large.  Differences between our high and low estimates sometimes reflect
variance in our calculation methods or allocation assumptions.  More often, however, the range
reflects  differences  between  the  revenue  loss  and  outlay  equivalent  approaches,  as  well  as
differences  in  the  assumptions  made  by  JCT  and  the  Treasury.    Since  neither  of  these  groups
publish detailed derivations of their estimates, we were unable to evaluate particular assumptions
in order to narrow the estimate range.

Exhibit  2-2  provides  an  overview  of  federal  tax  breaks  benefiting  oil  and  Appendix
Exhibit A-2 provides more detailed information on each estimate.9  The following are the largest
sources of subsidy:

•

Accelerated  depreciation.    Accelerated  depreciation  provisions  enable
capital investments to be written off more quickly than their actual service
lives.    While  this  provision  applies  to  all  capital  investments  (including
renewable  energy),  the  largest  beneficiaries  are  established,  capital-
intensive industrial sectors, of which oil is one.  We have pro-rated these
provisions based on the portion of total capital expenditures that is related
to  oil.    Although  the  tax  losses  from  accelerated  depreciation  have  been
the
reduced  substantially  since
Congressional  Research  Service  notes  that  the  economic  decline  rate  for
both equipment  and buildings is still “much slower than that reflected  in

the  Tax  Reform  Act  of  1986,

8  This  calculation  is  made  for  each  tax  break  individually.    In  reality,  companies  often  find  alternative
mechanisms to shelter income when a particular tax break is removed.  Thus, the values from both sources should be
viewed as rough estimates.

9 All estimates are net of the alternative minimum tax (AMT).  The AMT was instituted to counteract the
large deductions that profitable corporations used in the 1980s to eliminate their tax liability completely.  In theory,
the AMT ensured that such firms, regardless of eligibility for particular tax breaks, paid some taxes to the Treasury.
In practice, it has had very little impact on the actual taxes paid by the oil industry.

Percentage  depletion  allowances  for  oil  allow  the  industry  to  write  off  a
percentage of the gross income from oil production each year, as opposed
to  a  percentage  of  the  gross  investment.    As  a  result,  deductions  can
actually exceed the original investment.  Beginning in 1975, the provision
was  successively  narrowed  so  that  it  primarily  benefited  smaller,
independent  oil  companies.    However,  this  trend  has  been  reversed
somewhat since 1990, because percentage  depletion  has  been  allowed  on
transferred  properties  (even  if  the  new  owner  would  not  otherwise  be
eligible  for  percentage  depletion  benefits)  and  exempted  from  the
Alternative  Minimum  Tax.11    In  1995,  the  value  of  this  provision  was
approximately $335 million to $746 million.

Expensing of Oil Exploration and Development Costs.  This provision
allows oil companies to immediately deduct many types of expenses from
their  taxable  income  that  other  industries  must  deduct  over  multiple
years.12
  The  ability  to  expense  these  costs  encourages  increased
exploration  and  extraction  of  domestic  oil.
the
Congressional  Research  Service,  this  provision  is  mostly  claimed  by
integrated oil producers.13  We estimate the value of this provision to be as
much as $243 million in 1995.

  According

to

Foreign Tax Credits (FTCs).  Foreign tax credit provisions  allow firms
that  operate  in  both  the  U.S.  and  abroad  to  avoid  double  taxation.    In
reality,  oil  companies  are  often  able  to  receive  credit  for  payments  to
foreign  governments  that  are  actually  royalties  rather  than  taxes  paid.14
This  is  especially  apparent  when  oil  companies  report  paying  taxes  in
countries that have no corporate income taxes.  In other cases, tax rates are

higher  for  oil  companies  than  for  other  sectors,  suggesting  similar
shifting.15    By  disguising  royalties  as  taxes,  oil  companies  can  claim
credits  against  U.S.  taxes  owed  rather  than  deductions,  as  royalties  are
normally treated.

Using an approach developed by Wahl, our low estimate assumes that all
foreign taxes paid in nations that have no standard corporate income taxes
are actually royalties.16  We then calculate the additional taxes that would
be  paid  if  they  were  treated  as  royalties  instead  of  taxes  (i.e.,  deducted
instead  of  credited).    Our  high  estimate  assumes  that  50  percent  of  all
foreign tax credits claimed by oil companies are really disguised royalties,
including  a  portion  of  the  tax  paid  in  foreign  nations  that  do  have  some
corporate  income  taxes.17    These  approaches  yield  estimates  of  $486
million and $1.06 billion for this subsidy in 1995.

Deferral of Foreign Income.  When a U.S. firm earns income through a
foreign  subsidiary,  that  income  is  taxed  only  when  it  is  repatriated  as
dividends or other income (at which point taxes paid on the income in the
foreign  country  are  also  credited  against  U.S.  taxes  owed).    Because  the
parent firms are able to time when this happens, they can defer their U.S.
tax  liabilities  for  many  years.    As  international  oil  companies  are  both
large and operate in many other countries, it is clear that they benefit from
this tax deferral.  We estimate that this provision confers between $62 and
$303 million in reduced taxes per year.18

15 Proposals to reform FTCs claimed by oil companies have been introduced for about the past six years,
but have been unsuccessful.  Although quantitative analyses of the benefits to oil companies prepared by JCT are not
publicly available, JCT did confirm that oil companies continue to pay differential rates in many large oil producing
nations.  Pat Dreissen, Joint Committee on Taxation, personal communication, February 24, 1998.

16  See  Jenny  Wahl,  Oil  Slickers:  How  Petroleum  Benefits  at  the  Taxpayer’s  Expense,  Washington,  DC:

Institute for Local Self Reliance, August 1996, p. 7.

17 Wahl’s high estimate assumed that all foreign taxes paid were disguised royalties, an assumption that we
did not feel was realistic (Wahl, p.7).  Corporate income taxes do exist in other countries.  Furthermore,  Braathen
has argued that, in addition to taxes paid on profits, some governments require de facto taxes in the form of required
exploration and development spending (Nils Axel Braathen, OECD, personal communication, December 11, 1997).
Nonetheless, we agree that the practice of disguising royalties as taxes is likely to occur in countries that have some
corporate income tax, and not just those that have none.  In such cases, taxes paid would include both the corporate
income tax and royalties. Such an arrangement would benefit both foreign governments and the oil companies.

18 Our low estimate follows Wahl’s methodology, allocating the total value of the tax expenditure by the 10
to 15.9 percent of the 7,500 largest controlled foreign corporations that were associated with oil and gas interests in
1996  (Wahl,  p.  6).    We  then  allocate  a  portion  of  this  to  oil  based  on  oil’s  share  of  total  foreign  pre-tax  income
earned by the largest U.S. energy companies.  Our high estimate pro-rates the deferred foreign income of major oil
producers (based on EIA data) by oil’s share of total foreign pre-tax income.

State and Federal Interactions.  Most state tax systems use the adjusted
gross income value from federal returns as a starting point for calculating
state  taxes.   Thus,  tax  breaks  that reduce the federal  taxable income  also
reduce the taxes paid at the state level, magnifying the distortionary effect
of the federal breaks.  Our estimate assumes an average state corporate tax
rate of 5 percent, yielding a 3 percent increase in tax benefits ($56 to $119
million)  once  interactions  between  state  and  federal  taxes  are  taken  into
account.19

2.1.2    Effective Tax Rates on the Oil Sector

Another  way  to  estimate  the  value  of  tax  breaks  is  to  examine  data  provided  by  the
Energy Information Administration (EIA) on actual taxes paid by the industry.  The statutory, or
marginal, tax rate is the percentage of taxable income that would be paid as taxes in the absence
of  special  provisions.    The  average  effective  tax  rate  measures  what  the  industry  actually  paid.
The difference between the two values is a proxy for the aggregate value of all tax breaks to a
particular industry.20

As  with  tax  expenditures,  the  effective  tax  rate  data  provided  by  EIA  are  subject  to  a
number of caveats.  First, they are based on survey data of only the largest oil producers.  Thus,
they do not reflect tax breaks (such as percentage depletion) that are primarily  used by  smaller
firms.21  Second, they are calculated after standard business deductions, such as depreciation, and
therefore  do  not  reflect  the  benefits  enjoyed  by  the  industry  from  accelerated  depreciation
provisions or the expensing of exploration and development costs.

According to the EIA’s data, the  average effective  tax  rate on integrated  operations  fell
from 21.5 percent during the 1977-1981 period to only 8.7 percent for 1992 to 1995.  During that
same period, the corporate statutory rate has also fallen by about 12 percentage points, from 47 to

19 Average percentage rates are from Wahl, p. 8.

20 Corporations pay a graduated income tax, rising from a low of 15 percent on the first $50,000 in taxable
income in 1995 to 35 percent for all taxable income over $18.3 million.  Given the large multinational oil companies
in  our  data  set,  as  well  as  IRS  recapture  provisions  which  charge  higher  marginal  rates  of  38  and  39  percent  for
taxable income between $100,000 and $335,000 and between $15 and $18.3 million, it is reasonable to assume an
overall statutory rate of approximately 35 percent for oil.

21 George Miller, Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, states
that the effective tax rate on independent oil and gas producers is estimated to be zero.  (George Miller, “Unjustified
Giveaway to the Oil Industry,” Albion Monitor, September 2, 1995, obtained from http://www.monitor.net/monitor,
September 1997.)  In contrast, the Independent Petroleum Association of America, representing the independent oil
and  gas  producers,  claims  that  a  1995  survey  of  independent  producers  “found  that  the  effective  tax  rate  for  the
industry [was] 20 percent greater than other industries.”  (Independent Petroleum Association of America, “Domestic
Oil and Natural Gas Producers Call on Congress for Fairer, More Competitive Tax System,” July 31, 1996, obtained
from  http://www.ipaa.org,  October  29,  1997.)    Given  that  the  majors  have  a  lower  effective  tax  rate  than  other
industries, and that independents are eligible for additional tax breaks, IPAA’s finding seems counterintuitive.

2-8

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

35  percent.    However,  as  Exhibit  2-3  shows,  integrated  producers  have  paid  roughly  25
percentage  points  less  in  taxes  than  their  statutory  rates  suggest  they  owe.    This  differential  is
evidence of the substantial tax breaks they have received over the past 20 years.

Special provisions reduced integrated producers’ tax liabilities by roughly $7.0 billion in
1995.  This approach yields subsidy estimates nearly $3 billion higher than what we calculated
on a provision-by-provision approach.  About $1 billion of this differential can be accounted for
by  the  fraction  of  foreign  tax  credits  claimed  and  state/local  tax  deductions  that  are  properly
excluded  from  U.S.  taxable  income  to  avoid  double  taxation.    This  leaves  a  $2  billion
discrepancy between the two estimation methods that we are unable to reconcile given available
data.    Due  to  this  limitation,  we  use  the  lower  estimates  for  tax  subsidies,  calculated  on  a
provision-by-provision basis, in our totals.  Although this approach is more conservative, it may
understate the value of tax breaks to oil.

Exhibit 2-3 also illustrates that the Alternative Minimum Tax provisions, implemented to
ensure that all profitable companies pay a fair tax regardless of tax preference items, have made
little difference in the taxes owed by the integrated energy firms included in the EIA survey.

Other tax data made available by EIA (see Exhibit 2-4) indicate that the production part
of the oil fuel cycle benefits from substantially lower taxes overall than downstream operations,
and  that  global  tax  rates  on  all  oil  operations  have  fallen  since  1980.    In  1995,  integrated  oil
companies  had  an  aggregate  effective  tax  rate  for  federal,  state,  local,  and  foreign  taxes  of  37
percent for their U.S. refining, marketing, and transportation operations, compared to only 20.3
percent for domestic production.22

2.2

THE EVER-CHANGING TAX ENVIRONMENT: NEW TAX BREAKS FOR OIL

While tax expenditure provisions expire, others are enacted with each new tax bill passed
by Congress.  In this ever-changing arena, continued vigilance is necessary to provide an up-to-
date picture of subsidies.  The recently passed Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA) is an example
of a very large (though fairly infrequent) revision of the tax code that often contains many new
tax subsidies.  This specific act contained approximately $130 billion in new tax breaks.

We analyzed TRA to identify components that provide new subsidies to oil, and found a
few new provisions that benefit the industry.23  None of these items are included in our quantified
subsidies since they were not in effect during 1995, our base year.

23  The  proposed  H.R.  1648,  “The  National  Security  Act  of  1997,”  contained  five  provisions  increasing
subsidies to oil production, but only one was eventually integrated in TRA 1997.  The defeated provisions included
an  attempt  to  count  water  reinjection  to  maintain  well  pressure  (a  process  used  by  most  wells)  as  “advanced”
recovery eligible for the enhanced oil recovery tax credit.  They also included a provision to expand capital expenses
that  could  be  deducted  from  taxes  immediately.    See  “H.R.  1648  The  National  Energy  Security  Act  of  1997,”

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Increased  ability  to  utilize  existing  oil  and  gas  percentage  depletion
allowance.  Existing rules cap the ability of firms to offset their taxes with
the percentage depletion allowance.  These rules have reduced the value of
this  tax  subsidy  to  larger  producers  over  the  past  twenty  years.    TRA
relaxes these rules, increasing the  ability of existing producers to use the
existing  provision  by  about  $70  million  between  1998  and  2000.    As
currently written, this provision will exist for only two fiscal years.  Thus,
once  the  subsidy  is  annualized  and  pro-rated  between  oil  and  gas,  the
market  impacts  are  not  likely  to  be  substantial.    However,  short-term
provisions  are  often  extended  year-after-year  for  decades.    Extensions
would increase the importance of the subsidy substantially.

Increased  Ability  to  Utilize  Existing  Accelerated  Depreciation
Provisions.  The Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) was developed to ensure
that  all  profit-making  entities  paid  a  minimum  level  of  tax,  despite  the
range of tax breaks available to them.  One aspect of the AMT was slower
depreciation  than  available  to  non-AMT  taxpayers.    TRA  eliminates  this
distinction.  As a result, the provision effectively reduces the minimum tax
level  under  AMT  and  increases  the  losses  to  the  Treasury  under  the
standard  accelerated  depreciation  provisions.    The  Joint  Committee  on
Taxation  estimates  that  incremental  losses  to  the  Treasury  will  be  $18.3
billion for FY1997 through FY2007 from all industries.24  Allocating this
subsidy based on oil’s share of total AMT payments yields a new subsidy
to  oil  worth  $770  million,  or  about  $70  million  per  year.25    Allocating
based  on  the  oil  sector’s  share  of  total  capital  spending  yields  a  similar
result.

Elimination of the use of motor fuels tax receipts for deficit reduction.
Road  transportation  is  almost  entirely  dependent  on  oil,  and  cars  and
trucks provide the fuel’s primary market.  A tax on gasoline and diesel fuel
finances many of the country’s roads.  For the past several years, a portion
of  the  gasoline  tax  went  to  deficit  reduction  rather  than  to  road
construction.  These funds offset a portion of the general taxes now used to
build  roads.26    TRA  eliminated  the  use  of  any  of  the  motor  fuels  tax
receipts  for  deficit  reduction.    If  receipts  previously  allocated  to  deficit

2.

25  According  to  JCT,  the  share  of  current  AMT  payments  is  a  reasonable  method  by  which  to  allocate

benefits to specific industries.  Tom Barthold, JCT, personal communication, February 20, 1998.

26 Some analysts counted this portion of the tax as an offset to oil subsidies, ignoring the fact that billions of
dollars of general tax revenues supplement the gasoline excise tax to finance road construction and repair.  See, for
example, U. S. Energy Information Administration, Federal Energy Subsidies: Direct and Indirect Interventions in
Energy Markets, November 1992.

reduction are now used to increase road spending, then what was once an
offset to subsidies will disappear.  The result could be a $2 billion increase
annually in net subsidies to highway construction.

•

Climate Change Action Plan.  The Clinton administration’s  greenhouse
gas  emission  reduction  plan  may  also  include  new  subsidies  to  the  oil
industry.    Although  the  support  will  not  start  until  FY1999,  early
discussions suggest the plan will provide $5 billion in incentives, a portion
of which may provide tax breaks and research support to the  oil  industry
for emission reduction activities.27

2.3

SPECIAL TAXES ON OIL

As we discussed at the beginning of this chapter, the government levies many fees on the
oil  industry.    Some  fees  reflect  the  baseline  treatment  of  all  industries  in  the  economy,  while
others specifically target the oil.  Of this latter category, “user fees”  reimburse the government
for  its  oil-related  activities,  while  “special  taxes”  increase  oil’s  general  tax  burden  above  the
normal baseline for all industries.  In this report, we deduct user fees from the specific oil-related
programs they help fund.  We treat special taxes as a general offset to overall subsidies.

Exhibit 2-5 summarizes federal taxes specific to oil.  Nearly all of  these levies are user
fees because they serve to address issues associated with oil production and consumption, such as
leaking  storage  tanks  and  spills.    The  largest  federal  levy,  that  on  motor  fuels,  pays  for  the
construction  of  roads.    While  not  related  to  oil  production  per  se,  it  is  clear  that  the  public
construction of highways greatly benefits oil producers since the primary demand for oil is from
the cars and trucks using these roads.  Thus, the motor fuels tax, like many other federal taxes on
oil, is appropriately treated as a user fee.

At the Federal level, the only levy on oil that qualifies as a “special tax” on industry is the
crude oil windfall profits tax, which was created to prevent the oil industry from selling existing
reserves at the higher market price that prevailed during the oil price shocks.  In many markets
with short-term scarcities that lead to windfall profits for a period of time, the government rarely
intervenes to levy a special tax as it did for oil.  However, the windfall profits tax was no longer
in effect in 1995, so it does not affect our analysis.

(1) Both provisions include some tax collections from oil that are used for non-oil purposes (e.g., deficit reduction and electric trains and
trolleys).  Thus, a portion of these provisions are special taxes on oil that offset some of the billions of dollars from the general fund
used to build road infrastructure.  Full accounting of these programs would both deduct these special taxes from the oil subsidy totals
and add spending for road building to those totals.  Because we have not evaluated subsidies to highways in this report, we do not
deduct these special taxes either.

SUMMARY

Tax  subsidies  to  oil  remain  an  important  source  of  government  support  for  the  oil  fuel
cycle, providing $1.9 to $4.1 billion in benefits during 1995.  Efforts to curb special tax breaks,
which culminated with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, have been steadily eroded over the past ten
years.    Tax  rates  on  integrated  operations  of  large  oil  producers  were  only  12  percent  in  1995,
versus a statutory rate of 35 percent.  In the 1990s, rates have been at their lowest levels since the
Energy  Information  Administration  began  tracking  the  data  in  1977.    Congressional  efforts
continue  to  try  to  broaden  the  definition  of  existing  tax  breaks  for  oil  and  gas,  including  three
provisions  of  benefit  to  the  industry  contained  in  the  recently  enacted  Taxpayer  Relief  Act  of
1997.    Greater  efforts  are  needed  to  reduce  tax  subsidies  to  oil,  encouraging  improved  price
signals to investors, producers, and consumers.

FEDERAL AGENCY PROGRAMS SUPPORTING OIL

CHAPTER 3

Many  types  of  government  programs  subsidize  oil,  with  different  programs  benefiting
each stage of the oil fuel cycle.  Government labs invest in research and development of direct
benefit to the industry.  Government employees gather and publish basic industry or geological
data that helps oil producers decide where and when to invest.   Government entities also build
and  maintain  vital  transportation  infrastructure  heavily  used  to  move  both  crude  and  refined
products, ensure safe and environmentally sound operations at oil extraction sites, and guarantee
or subsidize loans used by the industry to invest in new operations or to sell equipment to higher
risk  customers.    Unless  the  industry  is  charged  for  these  services,  government  involvement
reduces the risk of, or increases the returns to, oil-related activities.  The effect is to encourage
greater investment in, and production of, oil.

This  chapter  summarizes  most  federal  program  subsidies.    Where  programs  receive
funding from user fees, the net subsidy costs of the program are reduced accordingly.  Exhibit 3-
1 summarizes net program subsidies to oil.  Exhibit 3-2 illustrates the programs with substantial
cost  recovery  now  in  place.    Government  programs  to  ensure  the  stability  of  oil  supplies  are
discussed in Chapter 4, and programs to oversee oil leasing activities are discussed in Chapter 6.
A  more  detailed  presentation  of  estimates  for  each  individual  agency  program,  as  well  as
information on data sources, can be found in the Appendix to this report.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

General  support  for  research  and  development  (R&D)  can  help  industries  identify
promising  approaches  for  oil  exploration,  production,  and  processing,  and  reduce  the  cost  of
researching new technologies.  The federal government, through the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE)  and  its  predecessor  agencies,  has  a  history  of  heavily  funding  energy  research.    Since
1980,  only  NASA,  the  Department  of  Defense,  and  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human
Services have spent more on R&D.28

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

June 1998

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

The  pattern  of  federal  support  for  R&D  can  influence  which  energy  technologies  are
commercialized  and  when.    Historically,  the  pattern  of  federal  R&D  spending  for  energy  has
favored fossil and nuclear energy over renewables and efficiency.  Between 1950 and 1993, the
government  allocated  22  percent  of  its  energy  R&D  expenditures  to  fossil  fuels,  63  percent  to
nuclear fission and fusion, and only 16 percent to renewables and efficiency  combined.29  This
pattern had begun to shift by 1995, with funding moving away from nuclear energy to renewables
and efficiency.  However, fossil fuels, primarily coal and oil, still received almost one-quarter (23
percent)  of  total  R&D  spending,  albeit  of  a  much  smaller  federal  R&D  pie.30    Nonetheless,
decades  of  favoritism  for  petroleum  has  contributed  to  innovations  and  improvements  that
reduced  the  cost  of  oil  extraction  and  development.    During  1995,  DOE  continued  to  provide
$808 million in subsidies to fossil fuels, of which $118 million supported oil.31,32  This amount
could easily have been borne by the oil companies themselves.

In  terms  of  private  R&D,  the  petroleum  extraction  and  refining  sector  had  one  of  the
lowest R&D investment levels among all industries, averaging only 0.9 percent of sales between
1983 and 1993.  The average for all manufacturing sectors during that same period was over 3
percent  of  sales.33    One  possible  explanation  for  this  low  investment  is  that  public  support  for
R&D allowed the industry to reduce its spending.  Another reason may be that oil service firms,
rather  than  the  major  oil  producers,  have  been  the  source  of  higher  R&D  spending  levels,  and
that this spending is not reflected in aggregate statistics.

3.2

PROVISION OF BASIC INDUSTRY INFORMATION

Every  business  requires  data  on  its  competitive  environment.    In  the  oil  industry,  this
information  includes  basic  data  on  oil  deposits  and  geology,  production  and  distribution,  and
prices.  The federal government has long provided these data at little or no charge.  For example,
the Energy Information Administration within the Department of Energy provides a host of basic
data on oil prices, production, and investment that is of substantial benefit to both oil producers
and  consumers.    Similarly,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  has  provided  core  data  on  mineral
resources  for  most  of  this  century.    These  two  programs  cost  taxpayers  between  $74  and  $97
million for oil-related activities in 1995.  While industry often supplements the data they provide,

the  availability  of  baseline  information  helps  firms  to  focus  their  efforts.    In  many  other
industries, these data  are  gathered  by  the private sector and sold to interested  firms  rather  than
financed by the taxpayer.

3.3

TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE

Oil  is  often  extracted  thousands  of  miles  from  the  point  of  consumption.    Thus,
transporting the oil is an extremely important factor in oil economics.  Nearly all of the crude oil
moved in the United States travels by pipeline or by water.  Water shipments in the coastal areas
of the country move by tanker, whereas shipments on the inland waterways move by both tanker
and barge.  Refined products are shipped via a wider range of modes, including barge, rail, road,
and pipeline.

3.3.1    Coastal and Inland Waterways

Water  transportation  infrastructure  is  a  good  example  of  a  general  subsidy  that
substantially benefits oil and distorts  energy  markets.    Although  oil  is  not  the  only  commodity
shipped through U.S. ports and inland waterways, it is one of the main commodities.  Crude oil
and refined products comprised 38 percent of all waterborne tonnage transported in 1995.  While
crude oil comprises a much larger share of coastal shipping than refined products, the situation is
reversed for inland transport.34

Historical  subsidies  to  water  infrastructure  have  helped  to  reduce  the  overall  cost
structure of water shipments for oil.  Most of the costs of capital infrastructure development were
financed through Congressional appropriations,  and  there  has  been  no  attempt  to  recover  these
historic costs through increased charges on current users.  Between 1950 and 1977, an estimated
$13.6 billion (1995 dollars) of federal spending on water infrastructure accrued to the petroleum
sector.35

The government continues to provide substantial support for water transport.  The Army
Corps  of  Engineers  is  heavily  involved  with  building  and  maintaining  ports,  harbors,  and  the
nation’s inland water transportation system.  Dredging of harbors and waterways, as well as the
construction  and  operation  of  locks,  benefit  oil  shippers.    The  U.S.  Coast  Guard  also  plays  an
important role in regulating coastal shipping.  Activities benefiting oil transport include shipping
lane and navigational maintenance and improvements (including ice clearing); shipping channel
patrol; oil spill prevention and response; and inspection of waterfront facilities, including transfer
pipelines used to unload oil tankers.  Although the share of these programs’ costs borne by users
has risen over time, subsidies remain.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Our subsidy estimates  for  both  the  Army  Corps of Engineers  and  the  Coast  Guard  pro-
rate  total  subsidies  for  water  transport  based  on  oil’s  share  of  total  tonnage  shipped,  and  they
deduct all user fees collected to support the programs.36  In 1995, the Army Corps conferred over
$235 million in subsidies to oil.  Subsidies through the Coast Guard were over $450 million.

3.3.2    Shipping

In  addition  to  subsidies  for  water  infrastructure  and  services,  the  federal  government
provides  shipping  subsidies  to  U.S.-flag  vessels,  including  oil  tankers,  through  the  Maritime
Administration,  or  MARAD.    MARAD’s  objective  is  to  increase  the  competitiveness  and
productivity of the U.S. Merchant Marine.  Toward that end, it provides operating subsidies to
U.S.-flag ship operators engaged in foreign commerce in order to offset the differences in U.S.
and foreign operating costs.  In the past, MARAD also subsidized certain construction costs for
merchant ships when U.S. costs exceeded those in other countries.  We  estimate that MARAD
provided approximately $80 million in subsidies to oil-related shipping in 1995.

3.3.3    Pipelines

Government  involvement  with  pipelines  is  centered  on  rate  and  safety  regulation
(described in the next section) and provision of rights-of-way (discussed in Chapter 6).  We did
not identify any examples at the federal level of public money being used to build or  maintain
pipeline infrastructure.

3.4

GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT OF INDUSTRY BEHAVIOR

The federal government regulates occupational health and environmental issues of the oil
industry,  as  well  as  oversees  rate  setting  in  pipeline  natural  monopolies.    If  oil  requires  a
significantly  higher  level  of  public  oversight  than  substitute  energy  sources,  financing  this
oversight from general tax revenues rather than user fees will hide important price signals about
the relative economics of energy alternatives.

A variety of federal agencies provide environmental oversight of oil.  The Environmental
Protection Agency regulates emissions to air, land, and water.  The Fish and Wildlife Service and
the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  both  evaluate  impacts  of  oil  on
ecosystems.  The Coast Guard and the Office of Pipeline Safety oversee oil pipelines and transfer
stations to prevent leaks and spills.  Finally, the Coast Guard, EPA, and the Navy Supervisor of
Salvage  respond  to  oil  spills  and  assist  in  clean-ups.    Some,  but  not  all,  of  these  costs  of
environmental oversight are recovered from the industry through user fees.  For example, the Oil
Pollution Act (described in Chapter 5) allows agencies to recover costs related to oil spills from

36 Note that allocating total subsidies by tonnage moved may understate the true subsidies to oil, especially
in the case of ports and harbors.  To the extent that oil tankers are the deepest ships using these facilities, proper cost
accounting would assign oil the full cost of dredging or other harbor modifications required to handle this type of
vessel.

3-6

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

responsible parties and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which was created through a tax on oil.
However, no mechanism exists for recovering the costs of other types environmental oversight,
such as EPA’s responsibilities for ensuring the safety of the oil industry’s emissions.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates pipeline rates.  However, the full
cost of this oversight is recovered through user fees; thus, FERC does not provide a net subsidy
to oil.

3.5

CREDIT PROGRAMS SUPPORTING EXPORT OF OIL-RELATED GOODS
AND SERVICES

Most  subsidies  to  oil  encourage  additional  domestic  production  or  consumption.
However,  a  handful  of  lending  programs  provide  subsidies  to  U.S.  firms  in  the  oil  sector  who
wish  to  export  their  equipment  or  expertise  to  other  countries.    The  U.S.  Export-Import  Bank
(Eximbank) and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) both serve to promote U.S.
industry abroad.  The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), to which the
U.S. is a major contributor, focus on developing specific industrial sectors in specific countries.
Although their primary focus is not on U.S. business, U.S. firms are substantial beneficiaries of
their lending activity.

3.5.1    How Credit Subsidies Work

The lending institutions provide credit subsidies in three main ways:  below-market loans,
loan guarantees, and below-market credit insurance.  Below-market loans provide borrowers with
artificially  low  interest  rates.    In  some  cases  interest  rates  are  so  low  (as  in  the  case  of
concessional loans) that the loan is essentially a grant.  Loan guarantees also indirectly provide
borrowers  with  lower  interest  rates.    Guarantees  by  financially  strong  institutions  such  as
Eximbank reduce the risks to commercial lending banks, allowing them to charge the borrower
lower rates  than would  otherwise be available for a given level of  risk.    Finally,  below-market
credit insurance provides companies with artificially low costs of insuring against business and
political risks.

All of these instruments have two levels of subsidy.  The first, the cost to the  taxpayer,
measures  the  lending  programs'  losses.    One  source  of  losses  is  the  difference  between  the
interest  rate  (or  insurance  premium)  that  a  borrower  pays,  and  the  cost  of  those  funds  (or
insurance) to the federal government.  If OPIC, for example, borrows money from the Treasury at
an interest rate of eight percent and lends it to Joe’s Oil Company at six percent to develop an oil
field  in  Algeria,  the  immediate  subsidy  would  be  two  percent.    The  total  cost  to  the  taxpayer
would  also  include  the  cost  of  making  and  overseeing  loans,  which  banks  normally  recover
through the interest and fees they charge, as well as any uncovered losses from loan defaults or
insurance claims.  The percentage of the government’s full cost of running a credit program that
is recovered from beneficiaries varies widely by program.  We depict this range of cost recovery
in Exhibit 3-3.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

The second level of subsidy, also shown in Exhibit 3-3, is a bit more complicated.  Even
if the government-supported banks were to recover their costs of operations from borrowers, they
might still confer a large subsidy to the recipient sectors.  The banks are large institutions that can
borrow  at  or  very  near  the  federal  government’s  cost  of  funds.    Investors  view  the  risk  of  the
federal government not paying back loans as so remote that the rate charged the Treasury is often
called  the  “risk  free  rate.”    A  similar  situation  holds  true  for  insurance  programs:    the  federal
government’s  cost  of  capital  to  finance  an  insurance  program  is  lower  than  what  would  be
available to private firms.  Because it has access to  less  expensive  capital,  the  government can
charge lower interest rates and insurance premiums than private companies.  Costs are reduced
still further by the fact that the government is a non-profit entity, and thus does not mark up its
rates  to  earn  a  return.    Finally,  the  government  often  provides  higher  risk  loans  and  insurance
policies than private institutions may be willing to make.

By going through a government-supported bank, Joe’s Oil can borrow money or purchase
insurance at lower rates  than  would be available  to it from  private institutions.   It  may  also  be
able  to  obtain  loans  and  insurance  for  business  in  high  risk  countries  that  its  private  bank  is
simply  unwilling  to  offer.    The  difference  between  what  the  company  pays  the  government-
supported  bank  and  what  it  would  have  to  pay  a  private  institution  is  captured  in  our  high
estimate (which we call the value of government intermediation) and provides the best measure
of the value of the credit programs to the recipient.

Credit  programs  have  been  some  of  Congress’  favorite  ways  to  confer  subsidies.
Although  the  programs  provide  tangible  benefits  to  recipients,  the  cost  of  the  subsidies  has
historically been fairly invisible to outsiders.  In some cases, the programs can confer benefits to
industry without losses to the government.  In other cases, programs (such as loan guarantees) do
not  require  immediate  outlays  of  cash,  and  program  losses  often  do  not  become  visible  until
many years later.

The  attractiveness  of these programs  is  apparent  in  the  fact  that  outstanding  direct  loan
and guaranteed loan balances for federal credit programs are approaching $1 trillion.37  To better
control these programs, a number of laws have been passed over the past ten years governing the
measuring,  reporting,  and  auditing  of  credit  subsidies.38    These  laws  eliminated  the  previous
practice of recording lending on a cash basis -- an approach that makes loan guarantees all but
invisible  until  they  begin  to  default.    Overall,  the  laws  have  greatly  improved  the  federal
government’s  ability  to  track  the  likely  long-term  financial  impact  of  lending  programs  on  the
Treasury.  However, credit reform provides few insights as to the value of government loans and
guarantees to the private sector, the second level of subsidy described above.

3.5.2    Subsidies to Oil Through Credit Programs

Since not every energy firm has access to cheap loans or insurance from the governmental
lending  institutions,  the  banks’  patterns  of  involvement  can  distort  the  relative  economics  of
different forms of energy.  The importance of distortions from these lending programs should not
be underestimated: they have heavily favored established fossil fuels over emerging renewables
and  end-use  efficiency.    Between  1980  and  1989,  for  example,  more  than  70  percent  of
Eximbank’s  energy  sector  loans  and  guarantees  went  to  fossil  fuels;  support  for  non-hydro
renewables and efficiency during that same period was negligible.  Support for the energy sector
through  the  multilateral  development  banks  followed  a  similar  pattern  for  the  1980  to  1988
period,  with  48  percent  going  to  fossil  fuel  (three  quarters  of  this  to  coal  and  oil)  versus  one
percent for non-hydro renewables and efficiency.39

As shown in Exhibit 3-4, this pattern of support has continued into the 1990s.  Especially
within both OPIC and Eximbank, energy continues to be an extremely important component of
their lending activity, yet very little financial support benefits end-use efficiency and non-hydro
renewables.  Support for oil exceeds 40 percent of the energy commitments of the International
Finance Corporation and Eximbank’s guarantees and insurance program.  Oil comprised 24 and
40 percent of OPIC’s and Eximbank’s energy commitments, respectively.

The value of this support is quite large.  Exhibit 3-5 compares the government and private
costs of capital for 1995.  Government debt is the least expensive source of funds by far, at 6.9
percent.  The highest grade (i.e., lowest default risk) corporations had to pay nearly three-quarters
of  a  percentage  point  more  to  borrow  funds.    In  reality,  corporate  expansions  are  financed  not
only  through  debt  but  also  through  stock  (equity),  which  is  a  more  expensive  source  of  funds.
The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimates the cost of funds to a particular firm (or
industry)  given  the  existing  mix  of  debt  and  equity.    The  WACC  for  the  largest  oil  refining
companies was 10.7 percent.  The average cost of capital in the higher risk oil and gas extraction
industry was over 14 percent, more than  double the direct cost of government debt.    Thus,  the
government  can  provide  loans  at  interest  rates  considerably  lower  than  the  oil  industry  may
otherwise be charged.

Measuring  the  subsidies  to  oil  through  international  lending  programs  is  a  surprisingly
difficult task.  The basic information required is standard data used by the banks to track loan and
insurance disbursements and performance.  Since all the banks publish audited financial reports,
all  must  use  transaction-by-transaction  data  on  non-performance  to  estimate  annual  losses  and
write-offs  on  their  activities.    Yet,  very  little  of  this  data  is  contained  in  any  of  the  banks’
standard  reports.    In  addition,  formal  requests  for  information  that  we  submitted  to  both
Eximbank and OPIC suggest that these basic data are dispersed across an array of bank databases
and not tracked in  any routine manner.   Neither  bank  was  able  to  fulfill  our  data  requests  in  a
timely or efficient manner.  As a result, we were unable to aggregate total subsidies to oil using
loan-specific data.

Notes:

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) incorporates both debt and equity financing, a more
accurate measure of the cost for large projects.  There are a number of financial models used to calculate
the WACC, with small variations in the resulting cost of equity.  The WACC values shown here are an
average of these approaches.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

June 1998

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Data reported by both Eximbank and OPIC under the Credit Reform Act in their annual
reports did enable us to make a rough estimate of those banks’ overall direct credit subsidies for
oil.40    Due  to  the  unavailability  of  transaction-specific  data  on  lending  and  insurance
performance, we have pro-rated the bank’s overall losses according to oil’s share of each bank’s
total commitments.  The implicit assumption is that the banks’ losses for individual sectors are
proportionate  to  each  sector’s  share  of  total  commitments.    We  were  not  able  to  estimate
subsidies  from  the  World  Bank  and  its  affiliates  because  they  did  not  report  data  on  loan
performance in a similar way.

Exhibit  3-6  shows  our  estimate  of  Eximbank’s  and  OPIC’s  subsidies  to  oil.    Our  low
estimate  represents  the  cost  to  the  Treasury  in  FY1995  of  OPIC  and  Eximbank  commitments
related to oil.    This cost has  three  components:    anticipated  losses  on  new  commitments  made
during FY1995, the 1995  installment  on losses  from  obligations  in  each  bank’s  portfolio made
prior  to  Credit Reform, and  administrative  costs  not  recovered  through  fees  charged  to  clients.
We  estimate  the  sum  of  these  costs  for  oil-related  commitments  at  $10  million  for  OPIC  and
nearly  $200  million  for  Eximbank.    The  vastly  different  sizes  mirror  the  banks’  different
missions.  OPIC expects to break even on operations.  Eximbank serves to help U.S. exporters
compete  by  setting  terms  “commensurate  with  those  available  from  foreign  export  credit
agencies,” and it does not expect to break even.41

While  our  low  estimate  reflects  the  cost  to  the  Treasury  of  the  banks’  oil-related
commitments, our high estimate also incorporates the value of the commitments to the recipient
companies.  This estimate recognizes that because both OPIC and Eximbank can borrow money
from the U.S. Treasury at extremely low interest rates, they are able to pass these savings through
to  their  borrowers  in  the  form  of  below-market  interest  rates  and  insurance  premiums.    It  also
recognizes  that  private  banks  are  willing  to  provide  loans  at  lower  rates  when  guaranteed  by
government-supported  banks.   These  benefits  are  independent  of  the  subsidies  provided  by  the
government’s failure to recover the costs of its programs.   Following  the approach  used by the
Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development,  we  estimate  the  value  of  these
benefits  at one  percent  of all outstanding commitments related  to  oil.42    The  total  value  of  our
high estimate is the sum of our low estimate (i.e., the cost to the Treasury) plus this incremental
benefit to the recipient companies.  As shown in Exhibit 3-6, our high estimate for the subsidies
provided by OPIC and Eximbank are approximately $31 million and $241 million, respectively.

40 Historical data on actual losses incurred on loans serves as a proxy for estimating the default premium

that would have been included in a private sector interest rate.

Reductions, GAO/NSIAD-97-7, December 1996, p. 12.

42 Ronald Steenblik, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, personal  communication,
February 25, 1998.  A more accurate way to value the direct loans would be to compare the interest rate charged by
the bank to a market cost of capital similar to those shown in Exhibit 3-5.  Unfortunately, detailed data on interest
rates charged by the banks were not available.

Direct subsidies (i.e., bank losses) include administrative costs that are not recovered through the
rates charged by the bank to its clients, plus uncovered losses on loans, guarantees, and insurance.
The intermediation benefit includes interest rate savings to private borrowers resulting from
government guarantees, the government's lower cost of capital, and its non-profit status.
The one percent value follows the practice utilized by the OECD in in its subsidy analysis.  Actual
savings to borrowers in the oil industry are likely to be larger, as shown in Exhibit 3-5.

CONSUMPTION SUBSIDIES

The primary program used to subsidize oil consumption is the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance  Program  (LIHEAP),  run  by  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.    As  its
name implies, LIHEAP helps low-income households to heat and cool their homes.  Part of the
funding also supports weatherization assistance.  Although not directly targeted at oil, about $275
million  in  LIHEAP  funds  were  used  to  purchase  the  fuel  in  1995.    An  increased  emphasis  on
weatherization in the short term could help reduce the need for subsidized oil purchases over the
long term.

SUMMARY

Numerous  federal  agencies  provide  services  of  value  to  the  oil  industry.    Some  of  the
most valuable subsidies, such as loan guarantees, are also among the most difficult to track and
quantify.    Federal  programs  providing  research  and  development  support,  basic  industry
information, industry oversight, transportation infrastructure, export financing, and consumption
subsidies  provide  between  $1.5  billion  and  $1.6  billion  per  year  in  subsidies  to  oil.    These
subsidized services reduce the cost  of oil-related investment and  consumption  while  increasing
the federal budget deficit.

DEFENDING OIL SUPPLIES

CHAPTER 4

The United States needs oil.  Despite some progress on alternatives, oil continues to fuel
our  transportation  fleet  and  our  military.    However,  much  of  the  nation’s  oil  is  transported
through fairly precarious means.  Approximately, 25 percent of our domestic crude flows through
the Trans-Alaska  Pipeline System, and  about 45  percent of  our total  petroleum  consumption is
transported  through  a  limited  number  of  oil  tanker  channels.43,44    These  delivery  systems  are
vulnerable to disruption.

Markets react in three primary ways to vulnerable supplies.  First, they demand a higher
price to reflect the higher risks.  Second, they invest in approaches to make the supply less risky.
This includes diversification of suppliers, the development of new supplies, the establishment of
stockpiles to cover demand if supply is interrupted, and the attempt to reduce the likelihood of
supply  disruptions.    Third,  markets  develop  substitute  materials  and  ways  to  use  the  limited
supplies more efficiently.

In  the  oil  industry,  corporations  have  invested  in  diversifying  their  supply  base  across
countries.  However, it has been the United States government, rather than private firms, that has
developed the largest stockpiles (such as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, described later in this
chapter)  and  spent  billions  of  dollars  in  defense  costs  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  supply
interruptions  and  price  shocks.    Because  the  government  has  borne  these  costs  of  securing
supply,  they  are  not  reflected  in  the  current  price  of  oil.    Thus,  producers  and  consumers  lack
important price signals that would encourage investment in substitutes.  The government’s costs
act as a subsidy to oil.  We estimate the costs of defending oil shipments and stockpiling reserves
for  our  base  year,  1995.    This  estimate  has  two  elements:    defending  oil  shipments  from  the
Persian Gulf and the costs of building and maintaining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  We also
qualitatively discuss oil-related military activities within Alaska.  In order for markets  to make
well-informed decisions between energy types, these costs should be reflected in the price we pay
for oil.

4.1 MIDDLE EAST OIL SECURITY

Although the Middle East supplies approximately 27 percent of the world’s crude oil, the
bulk of its production goes to Europe and Japan, not to the United States.45,46  Nevertheless, the
United  States  is  not  insulated  from  the  market  impacts  of  disruptions  in  Persian  Gulf  oil
production. The current market share of the region’s producers, as well as their share of known,
low-cost reserves, influence markets.  Changes in Middle East crude prices strongly affect world
oil prices, and with them the United States.

Given the importance of oil in the world economy, events in the Middle East can severely
impact economic stability worldwide.  The economic importance of the region and its traditional
instability have motivated a large U.S. military focus on the Middle East, and this focus has been
clearly  linked  to  oil  even  by  Department  of  Defense  personnel.47    The  protection  from  price
spikes  that  DoD  provides  greatly  benefits  oil  consumers  worldwide.    A  separate  question  is
whether the military’s presence in the Middle East also benefits producers.  To some degree, the
answer is yes.  The military presence protects industry investments in oil extraction and shipping
infrastructure  from  hostile  action.    This  protection  directly  reduces  the  cost  of  regional
operations.    However,  price  stability  can  hurt  some  producers  in  the  short-term  who  would
benefit  from  the  price  surges  that  sometimes  accompany  supply  disruptions.    In  addition,  the
military’s  activities related  to the Middle  East  clearly  hurt  domestic  oil  producers  in  the  short-
term, since they must compete with imports that do not reflect the military defense component in
their delivered cost to U.S. markets. 48

45 This figure is based on a ten year weighted average for the period 1986 to 1995.  The Middle East’s share
of  oil  production  rose  more  than  eight  percent  over  that  period,  to  approximately  30  percent  in  1995.    See  U.S.
Energy Information Administration, International Energy Annual 1995, December 1996, Table 2.2.

46 In 1995, the United States had net petroleum imports from the Persian Gulf of 1.563 million barrels per
day versus 3.365 and 3.979 million barrels per day for Europe and Japan, respectively.  See U.S. Energy Information
Administration, International Petroleum Statistics Report, September 1997.

47 Joshua Gotbaum, DoD’s Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security, was very candid about
DoD’s role in securing oil supplies and defending economic security in his testimony before the Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations.  In his prepared statement he wrote: “As this committee is only too well aware, the economic
health of our Nation and its allies has on several occasions been severely affected by events in the Middle East, and
their effect on oil supplies and prices.  And it is the need to defend against military threats to such national interests
that gives rise to the second perspective from which DoD must address the issue of U.S. dependence on stable global
oil markets.  The Department of Defense must be prepared to protect U.S. interests around the globe, wherever they
may be threatened.  This requires that we maintain the forces necessary to deter or defend against aggression.  One of
the key challenges that we face today is determining the appropriate strategy and force structure for the post-cold war
era and to manage properly the drawdown of our forces without sacrificing the readiness to respond to threats in an
increasingly complex world.  And while that force structure is not predicated on meeting any single military threat,
or  protecting  any  single  national  interest,  protecting  against  military  threats  to  global  oil  supplies  is  an  important
factor  for  which  we  must  be  prepared.”    Joshua  Gotbaum,  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Economic  Security,
U.S. Department of Defense, United States Dependence on Foreign Oil, hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations,  Senate Hearing 104-21, March 27, 1995, p. 24-25.

48  The  long-term  impacts  are  less  certain,  as  long-term  volatility  in  prices  could  lead  to  permanent  shifts

away from oil, hurting the interests of all producers, both domestic and foreign.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

In  the  following  section,  we  quantify  the  subsidy  from  oil  defense  in  the  Persian  Gulf.
Deriving  this  estimate  entails  two  main  steps:    estimating  total  U.S.  military  spending  in  the
region and pro-rating an appropriate share of this spending to oil.  Both of these steps are fairly
complicated, and we discuss them in detail below.  In addition, we evaluate which sectors of the
oil market are most likely to benefit from the subsidy.

4.1.1    Military Spending in the Persian Gulf

Estimating the military costs for ensuring the security of the Middle East oil supply is not
a clear-cut task.  The Department of Defense neither reports its expenditures by geographic area
nor  by  military  objective.    However,  DoD  and  private  researchers  have  provided  estimates  of
defense costs for the Middle East region.  They have used three main methods to do so:

•

•

•

Total  Cost  Approach.    The  total  cost  approach  allocates  the  military’s
entire  conventional  force  budget  geographically.    The  approach  pro-rates
the  budget  according  to  the  estimated  percentage  of  the  military’s  active
force structure that serves objectives in a region.49  Thus, it considers the
distribution of active combat units as a proxy for the geographic allocation
of  all  defense  resources,  including  general  costs  such  as  training  and
headquarters  support.    The  approach  generally  uses  routine,  peacetime
operations to avoid temporary biases caused by periodic regional flare-ups.
However,  some  researchers  add  a  premium  for  war  risks,  reflecting  the
expected value of a war occurring in any particular year.

Partial Cost Approach.  The partial cost approach estimates the full value
of all operations that directly benefit the military’s objectives in a region.
It  is  the  sum  of  the  force,  equipment,  and  support  costs  that  serve  the
region. Unlike  the total cost approach,  it  does  not attempt to allocate  the
portion of DoD’s budget that serves the military’s activities as a whole.

Marginal  Cost  Approach.    This  approach  tries  to  assess  the  degree  to
which  military  spending  would  decline  if  there  were  no  longer  any
objectives  in  a  region.  The  estimates  vary  depending  on  whether  one
includes only short-term changes in operations or both short and long-term
changes.    In  the  short-term,  cost  savings  include  only  the  costs  of
operations that are dedicated  exclusively  to  the  region  and  are  not  useful
for  meeting  objectives  elsewhere.    In  the  long-term,  the  military  may
realize added savings by restructuring to more efficiently fulfill remaining
objectives.    Thus,  differences  between  the  short-term  and  long-term
marginal costs of an objective can be substantial.  In addition, the marginal

49  The  total  cost  approach  requires  that  combat  units  be  assigned  to  individual  regions.    In  reality,  the
military  does  not  follow  such  rigid  geographic  assignments.    Units  may  serve  objectives  over  a  broader  area.    In
addition,  they  are  often  useful  for  meeting  contingencies  elsewhere.    Under  the  total  cost  approach,  they  are
generally assigned to the regions that are perceived as their primary areas of concern.

4-3

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

cost  approach  varies  as  to  whether  direct  costs  in  the  field  alone  are
included, or whether support provided at the headquarters level is included
as well.

Exhibit 4-1 lists the  primary  estimates for the cost of the military  presence  in  the  Gulf.
To  improve  the  comparability  of  estimates  made  in  different  years,  we  scaled  the  values  to
standard  1995  dollars  using  the  GDP  implicit  price  deflator.    Once  this  adjustment  has  been
made, the Persian Gulf total cost estimates range between $50 and $79 billion per year.50  GAO’s
partial cost estimate adjusts to $31 billion annually, and CRS’s estimate of short-term marginal
costs adjusts to roughly $500 million annually. 51

The  GAO  and  CRS  estimates  are  based  on  numbers  provided  by  DoD  that  may  be
inaccurately low.  DoD’s numbers reflect costs in the 1980s, but DoD’s presence in the Persian
Gulf appears to have increased since then (see note 51).  While the CRS short-term marginal cost
estimate is about $500 million for all objectives in Southwest Asia (scaled to 1995), DoD sought
supplemental funding of $630 million that year for the incremental cost of heightened operations
in  the  Persian  Gulf  resulting  from  perceived  Iraqi  threats  to  Kuwait.52    That  figure  is  for
supplemental  costs  alone,  and  does  not  include  any  of  DoD’s  baseline  marginal  costs  for  the
region,  raising  questions  regarding  the  accuracy  of  the  estimate.    Methodological  issues  aside,
existing  analyses  suggest  an  extremely  wide  range  of  Persian  Gulf  defense  costs  --  from  $500
million to $79 billion per year.

50 Total cost estimates from Ravenal, Kaufmann and Steinbruner, and Copulos.  Detailed sourcing is shown

on Exhibit 4-1.

51 We were unable to make a second adjustment for changes in real military spending for the Persian Gulf.
Between 1988 and 1996, DoD reduced its personnel by 27 percent, and real military spending decreased by an equal
amount.  However, over that same period, DoD increased the number of personnel ashore, naval deployments, and
land-based prepositioned equipment in the Persian Gulf.  The increased attention given to the Persian Gulf is seen in
the rising trend of Ravenal's cost estimates during the 1990s (see Exhibit 4-1).  Because trends in the Persian Gulf do
not appear to mirror trends in the military as a whole, simple metrics such as changes in total real military spending
would not be valid as a scaling factor.  Unfortunately, detailed historic annual data on the geographic attribution of
force structure were not available.  See (a) U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
(Comptroller),  National  Defense  Budget  Estimates  for  FY  1998,  March  1997,  Chapter  6;  (b)  U.S.  Department  of

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

4.1.2    Pro-rating Total Spending to Oil

Once  total  spending  in  the  region  is  bounded,  we  evaluate  the  portion  of  that  spending
that is properly allocable to the defense of oil supplies versus other military objectives.  Defense
of  oil  shipments  from  the  Persian  Gulf  is  an  example  of common  costs.    Below,  we  provide  a
discussion of common costs in general and how to allocate such costs across products.  We then
discuss common costs in the context of Persian Gulf defense.  Finally, based on our discussion of
common costs, we pro-rate a portion of the military’s Persian Gulf operations to oil.

4.1.2.1 Treatment of Common Costs

The term “common cost” refers to a situation in which two or more outputs are produced
simultaneously  from  the  same  production  process.53    The  presence  of  the  U.S.  military  in  the
Persian  Gulf  region,  along  with  all  of  the  general  overhead  support  that  makes  that  presence
possible, is an example of such a “production process.”  The “outputs” are the multiple military
objectives of this presence.  Recently, analysts at the RAND Corporation identified three primary
purposes of the military activity related to the Persian Gulf region:54

•

•

•

Ensuring access to oil supplies

Preserving regional stability

Preventing the emergence of regional hegemonic powers

Common costs create challenges for allocating production costs to individual beneficiary
products.  What portion of the U.S. military costs for the region is properly attributed to ensuring
access  to  oil  supplies  versus  another,  simultaneously  produced  objective  such  as  preserving
regional stability?   The analysis by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) cited in  Exhibit
4-1 attempted to answer this question indirectly using a marginal cost approach.  CRS estimated
savings from defense reductions if the entire Middle East were no longer a U.S. strategic interest.
Their result was a paltry $500 million in annual savings out of a total presence of $31.4 billion

53 Shared production costs are often referred to as joint costs rather than common costs.  In fact, joint costs
are a sub-set of common costs, and refer to situations in which a shared production process yields fixed proportions
of outputs, such as leather and beef from a cattle operation.  See Ben Johnson Associates, Inc.,  “Costing Definitions
and Concepts,” obtained from http://www.microeconomics.com/ essays/cost_def/cost_def.htm, January 27, 1998.

54 See Graham Fuller  and  Ian  Lesser,  “Persian  Gulf  Myths,”  Foreign  Affairs,  May/June  1997,  pp.  42-52.
Fuller  and  Lesser,  both  with  RAND,  argue  that  supplemental  objectives  such  as  maintaining  Israel’s  security;
maintaining preferential access to Gulf markets; and encouraging political and economic reform and human rights,
while beneficial, are not policy drivers for the regional military presence.

(1995 dollars), or roughly 1.4 percent.55  The marginal savings from a change in the oil objective
alone,  rather  than  the  entire  Middle  East,  would  undoubtedly  be  smaller  still.    For  example,  if
each  objective  has  the  same  marginal  costs,  the  marginal  savings  from  eliminating  oil  security
would be one-third of the total, or less than $200 million per year.  Even if we are to assume for
the moment that the CRS did a true, long-term, assessment of marginal costs, the strong common
cost attributes of the defense presence (i.e., military forces are useful for more than one objective
and in more than one region) make relatively small cost savings an inevitable and pre-ordained
result of the marginal analysis.

Assessing the benefit of services provided at their very low marginal cost misrepresents
both the real costs and the value of this military presence.  In addition, the idea that the real costs
should  not  be  attributed  to  individual  beneficiaries  at  all  because  they  are  common  costs
contradicts  standard  practice  in  both  industry  and  in  other  areas  of  government  activity.56
Consider, for example, expensive federally-owned dams.  The dam represents a massive common
cost  that  provides  electricity,  irrigation,  and  flood  control  services.    Once  the  dam  is  built,  the
marginal  cost  of  any  of  these  services  is  near  zero  --  yet  the  fixed  costs  must  be  paid  by
somebody, and the government allocates these costs back to the various beneficiaries of the dam.

The  issue  with  oil  is  not  whether  common  defense  costs  should  be  allocated  to
beneficiaries, but the fairest method of doing so.  The approaches developed to allocate common
costs in other industries such as dairies and oil refineries provide some useful insights to valuing
oil defense.57

•

Split-off  points.    The  production  of  a  good  or  service  involves  multiple
steps.  Even where some of the steps are identical for two or more outputs,
a  careful  assessment  often  reveals  one  or  more  “split-off  points”  where
inputs (and costs) can be isolated for a single output.  As shown on Exhibit

55  The  Congressional  Research  Service  analysis  is  based  on  data  developed  in  an  earlier  GAO  Report.
Delucchi  and  Murphy  conclude  that  the  GAO  estimates  on  which  the  CRS  marginal  cost  analysis  is  based,
understated defense costs by a large margin.  See (a) U.S. Congressional Research Service, The External Costs of Oil
Used  in  Transportation,  92-574  ENR,  June  17,  1992,  pp.  23-33;  (b)  U.S.  General  Accounting  Office,  Southwest
Asia:    Costs  of  Protecting  U.S.  Interests,  GAO/NSIAD-91-250,  August  1991;  and  (c)  Mark  Delucchi  and  James
Murphy, “U.S. Military Expenditures to Protect the User of Persian-Gulf Oil for Motor Vehicles,” Report #15 in the
series The Annualized Social Cost of Motor-Vehicle Use in the United States, Based on 1990-91 Data, UCD-ITS-
RR-93-3 (15), April 1996, pp. 9-12.

56 Bohi and Toman argue that the military outlay, “to the extent it can be associated with energy protection,
may be seen as a fixed cost that cannot be altered by marginal changes in energy prices and demands.  As such, it is
not relevant to energy policy.”  (See Douglas Bohi and Michael Toman, The Economics of Energy Security, Boston:
Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, p. 26.)  In fact, charging oil users for this protective service would very likely
have an impact on energy demand patterns, by encouraging longer term shifts away from imported oil, or to more
efficient  mechanisms  of  securing  the  oil  supply  on  the  part  of  regional  producers.    Whether  or  not  these  market
changes  would  then  trigger  longer-term  military  restructuring  or  simply  reduced  missions  (i.e.,  no  need  to  worry
about oil anymore) is a separate question.

57 Many other industries, such as organic chemicals, meat production, timber, and coal mining, have joint
and/or common costs as well.  Even more industries (airlines for example) have large fixed costs and nearly identical
production processes for different products or services provided.

4-2, the split-off point for the military presence in the Persian Gulf divides
the baseline presence from the objective-specific activities both in the field
and at the headquarters level.

To the extent that the cost of defense analysts in DoD’s Washington, DC
office  who  are  focused  on  oil  security  can  be  identified,  these  costs  are
properly  allocated  only  to  the  oil-defense  mission  objective.    Similarly,
when the Persian Gulf force undertakes actual missions, if these missions
are associated with oil rather than one of the other objectives, the costs are
also properly attributed to oil.  A similar line of reasoning would be used
for  costs  specific  to  other  objectives  as  well.    The  remaining  multi-
objective  (common)  costs  would  be  smaller  than  the  total,  but  would
nonetheless need to be allocated across the objectives.

•

Bounding  Common  Costs.    Although  common  costs  are  impossible  to
allocate precisely, economists have developed some rules that help bound
the reasonable costs attributable to a single output.  These conditions state
that the costs allocated to any activity should never be:58

-

Less than the costs that would be saved by discontinuing that activity
(i.e., its incremental cost), nor

-  More  than  the  costs  that  would  be  incurred  if  only  that  activity  was

undertaken (i.e., its stand-alone cost).

Thus, the CRS estimates for the cost of oil defense (which we estimate as one-third of the
CRS  estimate  for  total  incremental  costs  in  the  region)  form  the  absolute  lower  bound  for  oil-
related defense  costs.59   The upper  bound, the stand-alone  cost,  would  be  equivalent  to  all  oil-

58  These  bounding  statements  are  referred  to  as  “Baumol-Willig”  conditions,  after  the  economists  that
developed  the  argument.    See  Zolton  Biro,  “Cost  Allocation  in  Principle  and  Practice,”  London  Economics,  Ltd.,
October 1994, obtained from http://www.londecon.co.uk/pubs/comp/costall.htm, January 27, 1998.

59 The use of the CRS estimate as a bounding value is complicated by a number of factors.  First, the CRS
measured the marginal cost of all Persian Gulf defense, not just the oil objective, although we have used their results
to estimate a marginal cost for oil defense alone.  Second, their numbers seem to be downwardly-biased since they
appear to examine only immediate savings rather than savings from longer-term restructuring, and because they do
not appear to have evaluated the marginal costs for Persian Gulf defense outside of the region (e.g., in headquarters).
In addition, they originate with DoD, which is not a disinterested source.  As Ravenal puts it:  “When attempting to
justify its entire defense budget request, or when demonstrating to our allies that we are paying a disproportionate
share of the costs of an alliance, the Pentagon prefers to state its costs fully.  But when defending against proposed
cuts, it claims that deleting this or that unit or program from the force structure or the budget would save only the tip
of its marginal costs.”  (Ravenal, 1991, p. 19).

specific costs, plus all multi-objective baseline costs, since these costs would be the same for one
objective (oil defense) as they are for several objectives.  The stand-alone cost would likely be
over 95 percent of the total costs of the Persian Gulf presence.60

4.1.2.2 Allocating Common Costs Across Multiple Objectives

To determine a fair way to allocate costs among the various military objectives, consider
a less complex example than Persian Gulf defense -- that of a dairy.  The cost of buying, housing,
and  feeding  the  dairy  herd  must  be  recovered  from  the  sale  of  milk  if  the  farmer  is  to  stay  in
business.  Yet, a dairy takes in raw milk and converts it into a variety of products such as skim
milk,  cream,  and  cheese.    The  processing  costs  after  the  split-off  point  (the  creation  of  new
products from raw milk) may well be small relative to the common costs of caring for the herd.
If  none  of  these  products  are  saddled  with  the  costs  of  looking  after  the  herd,  the  dairy  will
underprice its output and not earn enough revenue to survive as a business.  Yet, if any particular
product  is  loaded  with  too  large  a  share  of  the  common  costs,  that  product  will  not  be
competitive in the market.

Determining how much of the common cost should be allocated to each product is not a
perfect process.  According to one practitioner, “the most to be expected is an allocation method
that produces reasonable and equitable results.”61  There are, however, a few common methods
used.  These approaches rely on pro-rating the common costs based on the ratio of one product to
the total products produced.  This ratio may be based either on some variant of the value in the
market  of  the  goods  produced,  or  on  the  relative  physical  quantities  (e.g.,  pounds  of  cheese
versus  pounds  of  milk).62    Some  complex  industries  do  not  allocate  the  common  costs  at  all,
simply  viewing  their  residual  earnings  (revenues  less  output-specific  costs)  as  “contribution  to
joint/common  costs  and  profit”.    If  their  residual  earnings  are  too  low,  they  adjust  their
production and pricing decisions accordingly.  Each approach relies on the ability to measure the
market value and/or quantity of the goods produced.  Thus, they are of limited application to the
allocation of a non-traded service such as defense.

60 Assuming the incremental costs for the other military objectives are similar to those for oil defense ($100
million each), the stand-alone cost of oil defense would only be about $200 million per year less than the total cost of
the Persian Gulf military presence.

62  Revenue-based  approaches  include  the  sales  value  at  split-off  [(quantity  of  product  A  x  sales
price)/(market  value  of  all  products  produced)];  the  estimated  net  realizable  value  (same  as  above,  with  the  sales
price  reduced  by  the  separable  product  costs  after  the  split-off  point);  the  constant  gross-margin  percentage  net
realizable value (same as estimated net realizable value approach except that revenues from each product are reduced
by a gross margin as well as separable costs, with the gross margin equal to that earned on all products co-produced).

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Another common approach for recovering fixed costs is that of Ramsey pricing.  Stated
simply, a Ramsey pricing approach allocates fixed costs based on the relative strength of demand
for the products co-produced.  That is, if people really need/want the product, they end up paying
a much higher share of the fixed costs.  A good example of this is the airline industry.  The fixed
costs of a business and a leisure traveler are virtually the same:  reservations system, gate agents,
baggage handling, plane, crew, and fuel.  The business traveler gets a few extra perks -- primarily
more  flexibility  in  changing  tickets  --  but  the  cost  implications  of  these  differences  are  quite
small.  Yet business travelers, because they need the service more (they have to get transportation
on short notice and cannot wait for later flights) end up paying three to four times as much for the
same passage.63  Thus, the business traveler pays a  much  higher proportion  of  fixed  costs than
the leisure traveler.

4.1.2.3 Allocating Persian Gulf Costs to Oil Defense

While  the  bounding  conditions  can  sometimes  narrow  the  range  of  uncertainty  for
allocating common costs substantially, they provide little help in the allocation of common costs
of oil.  If we take the oil share of the CRS assessment (despite the limitations discussed in note
59)  to  be  the  absolute  lower  bound  of  the  cost  of  defending  oil  (the  “incremental  cost”
parameter),  we  reach  a  value  of  less  than  $200  million  per  year.    If  we  assume  that  the
incremental cost of the other regional objectives is similar (assuming three primary objectives),
we generate an upper bound “stand alone” condition for oil of nearly $70 billion annually.64  That
the truth stands somewhere in the middle is hardly helpful, as the possible range is so wide.

The  Ramsey  pricing  model  is  perhaps  the  most  applicable  to  oil  defense.    The  three
primary  objectives  that  we  outlined  above  (preserving  regional  stability,  ensuring  access  to  oil
supplies, and preventing the emergence of regional hegemonic powers) appear to be interrelated.
Demand for all three "products" fluctuates depending on the relative state of unrest in the region.
For  example,  concern  for  the  three  objectives  increased  dramatically  after  Saddam  Hussein
invaded Kuwait.  During periods of relative stability, demand for the three objectives decreases
somewhat, but they continue to be policy drivers in the region.  Because we have no means of
judging  each  objective's  relative  share  of  total  demand  for  "defense  services,"  we  allocate
common  costs  equally  between  them.    This  allocation  yields  cost  estimates  for  oil  defense  of
$10.5  billion  to  $23.3  billion  dollars  in  1995.65    In  contrast,  one  prominent  defense  analyst
believes that nearly all of the costs should be attributed to oil, resulting in estimates three times

63 In economics terminology, the business traveler has a more inelastic demand for travel services than the

leisure traveler.

64 The upper bound is calculated using Ravenal's 1995 estimate of $70 million.  Ravenal made an estimate
of $79 million for 1997, but we do not use this value because it includes increases in spending since the base year of
our analysis.  Earl C. Ravenal, personal communication, March 1998; Earl C. Ravenal, “The 1998 Defense Budget,”

http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb105-7.html, February 20, 1998.

65  Due  to  the  methodological  problems  associated  with  using  a  short-term  marginal  cost  approach  for  a

service with large common costs, we exclude the CRS figure from our range.

4-12

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

higher than we report.66  Yet, even our conservative estimates demonstrate the importance of oil
defense in reducing the delivered cost of oil to the U.S., Europe, and Japan.

4.1.4    Identifying Beneficiaries of the Subsidy Within Oil Markets

There are two central issues regarding the beneficiaries from the defense of oil shipments.
The  first  is  whether  the  subsidy  primarily  benefits  oil  producers  or  oil  consumers.    This  is
important  in  evaluating  how  markets  are  likely  to  react  were  subsidies  removed.    The  second
involves  dividing  benefits  between  domestic  versus  foreign  sectors,  which  addresses  strong
concerns expressed by domestic producers that the military spending puts them at a competitive
disadvantage.

4.1.4.1 Producers versus Consumers

The  benefits  from  Persian  Gulf  defense  accrue  to  both  oil  consumers  and  producers.
Delucchi and Murphy point out that as of 1992 there were at least $4 billion in U.S. petroleum
investments  in  the  Middle  East,  and  more  likely  closer  to  $17  billion.67    They  estimate  that,
because  of  this  large  investment,  benefits  to  U.S.  producers  are  worth  between  50  and  100
percent of those to U.S. oil consumers.68  Others feel this value probably overstates benefits to
producers.69    Despite  the  uncertainty  regarding  which  sector  benefits  most,  it  is  apparent  that
both oil producers and consumers benefit in a substantial way from the military presence.

4.1.4.2 Domestic versus Foreign

Analysts  have  taken  two  main  approaches  to  weighing  the  domestic  versus  foreign
benefits  of  our  Persian  Gulf  defense  activity.    Some  have  argued  that  the  military’s  central
interest in oil security is to protect domestic consumers from oil price shocks.  Given the interest
in  insulating  domestic  markets,  some  have  argued  that  the  entire  cost  of  the  military  defense
should be allocated to domestic oil consumption.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Other analysts point out that the price stability provided by the U.S. presence benefits oil
consumers  throughout the  world, not  just  domestic  markets.    In  reality,  price  stability  even  for
foreign  producers  provides  some  indirect  benefits  to  the  U.S.,  since  in  an  international  trading
arena  the  U.S.  could  still  suffer  from  price  shocks  affecting  our  key  trading  partners.    Our
summary metrics in Chapter 7 incorporate both perspectives.

4.1.5    Persian Gulf Defense Results and Summary

We estimate that defending Middle East oil costs U.S. taxpayers between $10.5 and $23.3
billion annually.  While these estimates are higher than reported by the Department of Defense,
which  uses  a  faulty  short-term  marginal  cost  approach,  they  are  lower  than  estimates  made  by
independent analysts.

Beneficiaries of the oil defense subsidy include both domestic and foreign oil producers
and  consumers.    The  Persian  Gulf  defense  costs  are  quite  large,  representing  the  single  largest
subsidy to the oil fuel cycle in our analysis.  This spending helps to stabilize world oil prices, and
should  therefore  be  seen  as  purchasing  a  benefit:    protection  from  major  price  swings  in
petroleum and security for key petroleum investments in the region.  Because this benefit is being
purchased by the taxpayer rather than by oil producers and consumers, important price signals to
conserve oil and shift to other energy sources are being lost.  U.S. policy should recover defense
costs in the same way they recover other common costs such as dam construction: through user
fees.    Only  then  would  the  price  of  oil  from  the  Persian  Gulf  begin  to  reflect  more  fully  the
resources now expended to make it available to consumers throughout the world.

4.2

ALASKA DEFENSE

Alaska is another region that has vulnerable oil supplies and may benefit from a military
presence.    As  with  the  Persian  Gulf,  the  military  accomplishes  multiple  objectives  with  a  core
presence in Alaska, and budget data are not available to analyze in detail which costs are properly
attributed  to  oil.    The  Alaska  presence  also  differs  somewhat  from  the  Persian  Gulf  since  the
region is under domestic control and supply disruptions may be less likely.

Alaska accounts for nearly 25 percent of total crude oil production in the United States,
and most of that oil travels approximately 800 miles from the North Slope, via the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline  System  (TAPS),  to  a  tanker  terminal  at  the  Port  of  Valdez  on  Prince  William  Sound.
The quantity of North Slope production and the importance of oil to the United States economy
make the Alaskan oil supply a key strategic asset and an obvious target for enemies of the U.S.
Yet,  securing  the  full  length  of  the  Alaskan  pipeline  is  an  enormous  challenge,  if  not
impossible.70

70 U.S. General Accounting Office, Trans-Alaska Pipeline:  Ensuring the Pipeline’s Security , pp. 5 and 15.

4-14

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Officially,  Alyeska,  the  company  that  operates  TAPS,  is  responsible  for  the  pipeline’s
security.  Alyeska maintains its own security force, which performs a combination of live visual
surveillance  and  video  and  aerial  surveillance.    Although  federal  and  state  agencies  are  not
directly responsible for daily security measures, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department
of Defense, Alaska National Guard, and Alaska State Troopers serve as reactionary elements that
would  respond  to  security  incidents  that  are  beyond  Alyeska’s  capabilities.    The  Federal
Emergency Management Agency would be involved in the event of a natural disaster.

The  military  representatives  that  we  contacted  in  Alaska  stressed  that  the  security  of
TAPS is the sole responsibility of Alyeska, and that the U.S. military does not engage in security
operations.71   One  representative from Elmendorf Air  Force Base’s  Public  Affairs Office  flatly
denied that ensuring the security of the oil supply is among the military’s objectives in Alaska,
suggesting that none of the common costs of the Alaska defense presence should be allocated to
oil.72

Historically, Alaska was considered a front line of defense during the Cold War due to its
proximity to the former Soviet Union.  As such, military personnel in Alaska noted that it was
the focus of many Cold War defense operations.  Today, the state is a useful base for operations
not only in the former Soviet Union, but in Asia as well.  Defense personnel there also pointed
out that the military has a strong interest in the region simply because Alaska is U.S. territory and
home  to  U.S.  citizens.73    Yet,  our  research  indicates  that  Alaska’s  role  as  a  large  oil  producer
receives  consideration  from  the  government  and  defense  community,  and  that  the  federal  (and
perhaps  also  the  state)  government  does  incur  costs  related  to  the  defense  of  Alaskan  oil
shipments.

Unlike the Persian Gulf situation, federal and state agencies do not appear to be directly
involved  in  the  daily  security  of  the  Trans-Alaska  Pipeline.    Furthermore,  the  Department  of
Defense  does  not  explicitly  allocate  its  spending  and  activities  in  Alaska  among  differing
objectives such as defense of natural resources, United States citizens, and United States borders.
However,  our  research  found  the  following  examples  of  federal  involvement  in  Alaskan  oil
security:

The Alaska Command of  the Department of Defense  maintains plans for
assisting Alyeska  security in  the  event  of  a  hostile  action.    Likewise,  the
Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains plans for responding to terrorist
activities involving the pipeline.74

The Defense Investigative Service of the Department of Defense performs
vulnerability  assessments  of  industrial  facilities  that  are  considered
essential to the nation’s defense.  Once its assessments are completed, the
Department of Defense develops plans to defend the individual facilities.
As  of  six  years  ago,  the  Department  of  Defense  had  nominated  several
TAPS  facilities  for  “key  asset”  designation.75    Defense  Investigative
Service  personnel  were  unwilling  to  confirm  whether  these  facilities  had
ultimately been designated.76

The  Department  of  Defense’s  Alaska  Command  conducted  training
exercises  in  1985,  1987,  and  possibly  in  other  years  under  Operation
Brimfrost  for  the  Alaska  pipeline’s  defense.77    Operation  Brimfrost  was
replaced  by  Operation  Northern  Edge  in  1993.    Although  the  Alaska
Command  has  not  conducted  pipeline  defense  exercises  under  Northern
Edge,  it  initiated  harbor  defense  exercises  in  1995.    Valdez,  the  transfer
point for oil from the pipeline to tankers, is one of the ports that has been
used for these harbor defense exercises.78

While  some  of  these  activities  may  have  involved  oil-related  infrastructure  simply
because  they  provided  a  useful  stage  for  training  missions,  others  are  clearly  baseline  support
related  to  oil  security.    Unfortunately,  much  of  the  data  needed  to  assess  the  spending  on  oil-
related activities is unavailable.  As a result, we were not able to prepare a quantitative estimate.

4.3

STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE

Many sectors of the U.S. economy are dependent on oil, and much of this oil is imported.
An absence of alternative fuels makes the nation’s economy vulnerable to rapid changes in the
price and availability of crude.  As noted by DOE’s Deputy Secretary, “Disruptions in global oil
markets  and  energy  price  shocks  have  been  followed  by  recessions  three  times  in  the  past  25
years.”79

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was initiated in 1975 with the stated mission of
protecting  the  United States from oil  supply shocks  that  could  potentially  result  from  political,
military,  or  natural  causes.    As  of  1995,  the  existing  storage  capacity  within  the  Strategic
Petroleum Reserve was 680 million barrels, with a drawdown capacity (i.e., rate at which oil can
be  removed)  of  3.9  million  barrels  per  day.80    By  protecting  consumers  and  refiners  from  oil
market disruptions, SPR reduces both the need for private sector entities to  establish  their own
inventories and the incentives for oil consumers to increase their ability to shift fuels in times of
oil shortages.

4.3.1    Estimating the Annual Subsidy to SPR

The cost of SPR is commonly depicted in government publications as comprising the cost
of building and maintaining the storage facilities, operating  the  facilities on  a day-to-day basis,
and  purchasing  oil.    While  all  of  these  items  are  important  cost  elements,  they  present  only  a
small part of the real cost of SPR to taxpayers.

As shown in Exhibit 4-3, we estimate the cost of providing SPR between $1.6 and $5.4
billion  for  1995.    These  estimates  are  based  on  two  different  approaches.    The  first  is  an
annualized cost approach that assumes SPR can write off its unpaid interest each year instead of
accumulating greater debt.  Depending on the interest rate used, this approach yields estimates of
$1.6 billion to $2.2 billion for 1995.  The largest single component of these costs is the imputed
interest  charges  on  the  more  than  $16  billion  spent  to  purchase  oil  since  1976.    The  second
largest  cost  item  is  the  financing  cost  on  funds  invested  to  build  and  maintain  the  capital
infrastructure.    Neither  of  these  cost  elements  are  accounted  for  in  the  government’s  financial
reports.

http://www.fe.doe.gov/remarks/916moler.html, February 25, 1998.

80 This capacity was reduced from 750 million barrels and a drawdown of 4.5 million barrels per day due to
the closure and decommissioning of  the  Weeks  Island  storage  facility.    See  U.S.  Department  of  Energy,  Strategic

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

June 1998

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

The second approach recognizes that the Treasury must pay interest each year on SPR’s
debt, and that it must issue new debt to pay that interest.  Thus, SPR’s effective cost to taxpayers
includes compounding of interest (i.e., interest accruing on unpaid interest).  Using this approach,
we estimate the upper bound cost of SPR in 1995, $5.4 billion.  As shown in Exhibit 4-3, interest
charges account for virtually all of SPR’s cost under this approach.

In the remainder of this chapter, we explain in greater detail how we developed each of

these estimates.

4.3.2    Annualized Cost to Build and Operate the SPR

Federal  accounting  for  SPR  is  done  on  a  cash  basis.    Each  year,  funds  appropriated  by
Congress  are  reported  in  one  of  three  main  SPR  accounts:    storage  facility  development,
management, and oil acquisition.  This approach is useful in assessing the cash investment within
a particular year, but provides little information on the full annualized cost of SPR to taxpayers.
To estimate this annualized cost, we have adjusted many of the data elements provided in SPR’s
Annual Report and developed estimates for data not provided.  Each element of our analysis is
described below.  This analysis results in SPR subsidy estimates between $1.6 and $2.3 billion in
1995.

4.3.2.1 Storage Facility Development

SPR’s Storage Facility Development account is used to purchase physical capital lasting
for multiple years.  The account includes both capital and operating costs, though these have not
been  broken  out  in  SPR’s  financial  statements.    Based  on  conversations  with  reserve  staff,  we
estimate that at least 30 percent of the costs incurred were for operations.  For the 70 percent that
were  capital  costs,  we  use  the  standard  methods  of  accounting  to  spread  the  costs  of  capital
purchases  over  time  based  on  the  annual  depreciation  (or  wearing  out)  of  the  capital  assets81.
Our low estimate assumes assets last 35 years, while our high estimate assumes assets last only
25 years, and thus have a higher annual depreciation charge82.

81  Marycarol  Shannahan,  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve,  personal  communication,  April  27,  1998.    The
capital  share  was  close  to  100  percent  of  costs  in  1976,  dropping  to  roughly  30  percent  in  1991  prior  to  the
beginning of renovations.  After 2000, the capital share is expected to be less than 10 percent of the facility account.

82  The  appropriate  asset  life  of  SPR  appears  closer  to  the  short  end  of  this  range.    Construction  on  SPR
began in 1976; in 1991, only 15 years later, major renovations began to repair and upgrade the Reserve.  Work is
expected to be completed in 2000, and these investments are anticipated to last until 2025.  Shannahan, personnel
communication.

4-19

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

4.3.2.2 Oil Acquisition

The largest cost item in any single year is the purchase of crude oil for the reserve and its
transportation to SPR sites.  Our assumption is that this oil will eventually be sold.  Thus, we do
not count the funds spent on oil as a subsidy.  Rather, when sales have occurred, we compare the
sale price to the purchase price of the oil to estimate the nominal gain or loss on that sale.

4.3.2.3 Imputed Interest

In  the  private  sector,  unless  a  company’s  investments  can  grow  at  least  as  fast  as  the
interest  rate  over  the  long-term,  a  private  enterprise  will  lose  money  and  go  out  of  business.83
Thus, oil held in an inventory must grow in value at the rate of interest -- or must protect such a
rate  of  growth  in  other  parts  of  the  company  that  would  otherwise  be  harmed  if  oil  were  not
continuously available.

Many  discussions  of  the  cost  of  SPR  focus  only  on  annual  appropriations  for  oil
purchases  and  facility  construction  and  maintenance,  implicitly  treating  the  government
investment as “free” money.  However, with the United States running a budget deficit during the
entire duration of SPR’s existence, the government has had to issue additional debt in the form of
Treasury bonds to develop and operate SPR, and it must pay interest on that debt.  These are real
costs to U.S. taxpayers that are directly attributable to SPR; however the government omits them
from SPR’s reported costs.

We estimate these interest costs in two ways.  First, we use the government’s long-term
Treasury bond interest rate (since SPR is a long-term investment).  This estimates SPR’s hidden
cost  to  the  taxpayer.    Second,  we  calculate  the  cost  of  the  capital  if  SPR  were  owned  and
operated  by  the  private  sector  instead  of  a  service  provided  by  the  government.    For  this
calculation,  we  use  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  the  largest  oil  refining
companies because  low cost government debt would not be available.84  This second  approach
estimates not only the hidden interest costs of SPR, but the benefit to oil markets of having this
service publicly provided.

83  Firms  can,  and  do,  survive  for  short  periods  of  time  without  fully  recovering  their  fixed  costs  of

operations.

84 We use a 5-year rolling average rate from the 30-year  Treasury  bond  to  reflect  the  ability  to  refinance
debt  in  a  market  with  falling  interest  rates.    A  5-year  average  is  used  because  debt  can  not  always  be  refinanced
immediately,  and  doing  so  is  not  costless.    We  were  unable  to  calculate  a  5-year  rolling  average  for  the  private
financing  cost  because  data  were  not  available.    Instead,  we  assume  all  debt  is  held  at  1995  interest  rates.    This
assumption  reduces  our  subsidy  value,  since  1995  rates  were  lower  than  in  the  previous  years.    Our  use  of  the
WACC for the largest oil refiners also reduces our estimate, since interest charges for smaller firms would have been
even higher.

4.3.2.4 Miscalculating the Market:  Declines in Asset Value

Changes  in  the  value  of  past  investments  can  complicate  the  analysis  of  SPR’s  annual
costs.  When a private firm determines that particular assets are now worth less than what they
paid for them (net of depreciation), they write these assets down to reflect a best estimate of their
current value.  These write-downs improve the accuracy of the firm’s reported financial results,
but generally do not change the original financing obligations entered into in order to purchase
those assets in the first place.85  Consider the purchase of a new automobile, for which the buyer
obtains  a  $15,000  loan.    The  individual  may  ruin  the  car  in  an  accident  the  next  day,  but  still
must repay the loan.

SPR  has  two  situations  where  asset  write-downs  would  be  appropriate,  though  the

program does not appear to have explicitly done so:

•

•

Decline in the Value of Oil Inventory.  The average acquisition cost per
barrel  of  oil  added  to  SPR  between  1976  and  1995  was  $27.30.    The
market price of that oil in 1995  was  only $17.20  per barrel,  suggesting a
capital  loss  on  oil  acquisition  of  nearly  $6  billion  --  even  excluding  the
time-value  of  money    This  is  currently  a  paper  loss,  as  theoretically  the
price  of  oil  could  rise  to  $27  per  barrel  or  higher  prior  to  when  it  is
actually sold.  We have counted only losses on actual sales in our subsidy
estimates,  not  paper  losses  due  to  the  declining  market  price  for  crude,
because  crude  prices  continue  to  fluctuate  over  a  fairly  wide  margin.
However,  it  may  be  appropriate  for  the  SPR  program  to  write  down  its
inventory  more  formally  if  price  projections  indicate  full  recovery  of  the
purchase price is unlikely.  If oil inventory had been depreciated each year
of  the  1976  to  1995  period  to  reflect  the  decline  in  its  market  value,  the
reported cost of the SPR program in 1995 would have increased by about
$300 million.86

Defunct Physical Assets.  SPR consists of five large underground storage
facilities  for  oil.    In  1995,  one  of  these  facilities,  Weeks  Island,  was
permanently closed due to problems with oil leakage and the potential for
environmental contamination.  With 9.3 percent of the SPR’s total storage

85 Private equity investors may bear the brunt of such write-offs through reduced share values and deferred
dividend payments.  To the extent that share values fall and equity investors lose money, future borrowing costs are
likely to rise.

86 Marginal analyses of the cost of SPR, such as conducted by Mark Delucchi for the Union of Concerned
Scientists, do not evaluate these costs because they estimate the savings in  SPR costs from today going forward if
motor vehicle use were curtailed or eliminated.  Thus, the starting point for such analyses is today, instead of 1976,
and all past subsidies for facility construction, oil acquisition, and accrued interest are ignored.  While appropriate
for marginal decision making, such an approach does not accurately measure the full taxpayer cost of SPR over time.
See  Roland  Hwang,  Money  Down  the  Pipeline:  Uncovering  the  Hidden  Subsidies  to  the  Oil  Industry,  Union  of
Concerned Scientists, September 1995, pp. B-1 to B-3.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

capacity, the implied capital write-off is at least $237 million.87  Increasing
past annual depreciation deductions so that Weeks Island would be worth
zero in 1995 would add about $12 million per year to our subsidy estimate.

4.3.2.5 Return on Investment

The  U.S.  government  is  a  non-profit  entity,  and  therefore  does  not  seek  a  return  on  its
investment in  SPR.  This investment,  totaling nearly  $20  billion  with  no  expected  payback  for
decades, entails substantial  financial  risks.    If  SPR  were  privately  owned  and  operated,  private
investors would require compensation in the form of a return on their investment for taking on
those  risks.    The  fact  that  SPR  is  provided  by  the  government  rather  than  the  private  sector
increases  the  value  of  the  subsidy  enjoyed  by  oil  consumers.    We  have  not  estimated  these
additional savings to oil consumers in our analysis.

4.3.3    Cost of SPR Including Compounding of Interest

Interest  payments  were  the  largest  components  in  the  estimate  of  SPR’s  annual  cost  of
operations shown above.  Implicit in the calculations was the write-off of each year’s interest bill.
In  reality,  this  is  not  what  happens.    When  individuals  take  out  a  loan  from  a  bank  to  buy  a
$15,000  car  at  10  percent  interest,  they  must  pay  10  cents  per  year  in  interest  for  every  dollar
borrowed, or roughly $1,500.88  If they fail to pay the interest in the  first  year, it is  capitalized
(i.e., added to the original amount borrowed), increasing the total debt to $16,500.  Thus, in the
second year of operations they would owe the bank not only interest on the original $15,000, but
interest  on  the  $1,500  in  unpaid  interest  from  the  previous  year.    The  process  of  paying  (or
earning) interest on accrued interest is called compounding.

It  is  worth  considering  compounding  when  assessing  the  cost  of  SPR.    Given  the
government’s  fiscal  deficits  throughout  SPR’s  life,  the  Treasury  had  to  issue  debt  to  provide
SPR’s funding, and it had to pay interest on that debt.  To pay the interest, the Treasury would
have needed either to receive compensation for its investment or to issue more debt, effectively
requiring  it  to  pay  interest  on  accrued  interest.    As  the  purpose  of  issuing  the  debt  in  the  first
place  was  to  fund  SPR,  this  compounding  of  interest  would  be  directly  attributable  to  SPR  as
well.

87 This amount is equal to 9.3 percent of our low estimate for the remaining undepreciated capital in 1995.
In fact, facility development costs are unlikely to be linearly related to the storage capacity.  Rather, costs per barrel
are likely to be lower for larger facilities.  This suggests that the appropriate Weeks Island write-off would be higher
than its share of total storage capacity.

88 The exact amount will depend on the number of times per year interest is calculated, and the number of

times per year payments are made on the debt, both of which affect the annual interest charge.

4-22

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

If the Treasury fully accounted for SPR’s costs, it would have treated investments in SPR
as formal debt obligations between the  program and  the Treasury,  and  charged  SPR  interest  to
cover  the  actual  costs  incurred  by  the  Treasury  for  its  debt.    Thus,  interest  would  have  been
calculated at the Treasury’s cost of  long-term borrowing (since SPR requires long-term  funds),
measured  by  the  average 30-year Treasury Bond  rate.   To pay  the  interest and  principal  on the
original investment, SPR would have collected a “price-shock insurance premium” in the form of
a user fee from oil consumers.  If the program did not repay the interest on its debt, the unpaid
interest would have been added to its overall debt burden, and the program would have begun to
pay interest on both the original debt and the accumulated unpaid interest.  Thus, if the Treasury
fully  accounted  for  its  investment  in  SPR,  its  costs  would  include  compounding  of  unpaid
interest.

SPR has paid off none of its principal and none of its accrued interest since its inception.
The few oil sales it has implemented have been at prices below its average oil acquisition cost,
yielding  capital  losses.    The  billions  of  dollars  tied  up  in  SPR  for  as  long  as  20  years,  with
interest compounded on unpaid interest from earlier periods, provides a proxy for the total public
cost of SPR if treated as a formal enterprise during its lifetime through 1995.

We used this approach to provide an alternative estimate to the annualized cost method
described  above.    It  mirrors  the  financial  flows  that  the  federal  government  actually  incurred.
Funds  put  into  SPR  required  the  issuance  of  Treasury  Bonds,  on  which  taxpayers  paid  debt.
Interest  not  paid  throughout  this  period  required  the  issuance  of  still  more  debt.    Exhibit  4-4
illustrates the impact of the compounding process, and shows that the interest cost alone on the
accrued  debt  was  more  than  $5.2  billion  in  1995,  far  higher  than  our  high  annualized  cost
estimate  of  $2.3  billion.    As  principal  and  accrued  interest  increase  over  time,  the  growth  in
interest charges accelerates.  Thus, the incremental addition to debt in 1995 greatly exceeds that
during 1979 ($360 million), when the total unpaid balance was much smaller.

As  is  also  shown  in  Exhibit  4-4,  SPR’s  total  debt  from  direct  investment  and
compounded  interest  on  unpaid  debt  was  $74.7  billion  in  1995.    In  comparison,  the  value  of
SPR’s  tangible  assets  in  that  year  was  only  $10.2  billion  in  oil  inventory  (valued  at  the  1995
market price) and capital assets with a book value of about $1.9 billion.89

89 Although the book value of capital assets may not be an accurate representation of the market value of the
assets in question, we had no data with which to assess the market value.  Depending on the value of alternative uses
of the storage capacity, the book value may be more or less than the actual market value of the assets.

New investment includes all funding to SPR in a given year, including capital, oil purchases, and management costs.  Within an enterprise,
all of these elements must be financed either through revenues, debt, or equity.  Interest calculations assume investment funds are
provided in twelve equal installments.
We use a five year rolling average of 30-year Treasury bond rates to calculate the interest accrual on outstanding
debt.  This allows for debt refinancing in the case of falling interest rates (which we assume to be costless).
The effective annual rate assumes monthly compounding.  Were debt instead held to term at the initial interest rates,
total program costs through 1995 would have been approximately $12 billion higher.

The 1995 market value of SPR's oil inventory is the product of SPR's end-of-year inventory (591.7 million barrels) and the 1995 average
refinery acquisition cost ($17.23/bbl).
The sale price premium assumes that the oil will be sold during periods of short supply when sale prices are higher than now.
We assume that the oil would be sold if prices increased by 50 percent.
The market value of SPR's capital assets may be higher or lower than the book value, but adequate data were not available to estimate it.
The total apparent taxpayer loss for SPR is base on debt incurred for capital investments into SPR plus the compounding of unpaid
interest on that debt.  As the amount of debt accumulates over time, new interest charges increase in value.  Incremental debt incurred
in 1995 reflects the amount of new interest charged on the accumulated debt in 1995.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

The value of oil inventory shown above fluctuates with market prices.  Because SPR sales
tend to occur at times of price shocks (when prices rise), the non-crisis price of oil may not be the
best  indicator  of  the  Reserve’s  value.    Our  calculation  ascribes  a  50  percent  price  premium  to
adjust for this factor.90  With this premium, the value of the oil inventory rises to $15.3 billion,
and the value of the assets plus inventory reaches $17.2 billion.

Based  on  SPR’s  estimated  debt  and  assets  in  1995  ($74.7  billion  and  $17.2  billion
respectively),  the  government’s  investment  yielded  a  loss  of  $57.5  billion  from  the  program’s
inception through 1995.  This “loss” can be viewed as a proxy for the full cost to U.S. taxpayers
of SPR’s protection against economically damaging price spikes.  As shown in Exhibit 4-3 the
Exhibit 4-4:  SPR Subsidy with compounding incremental cost in 1995 was $5.4 billion.  As with
the  annualized  cost  approach,  this  estimate  does  not  include  declines  in  asset  values,  capital
write-offs,  or  the  incremental  benefits  to  consumers  of  having  SPR  provided  by  a  non-profit
entity.

4.3.4    Strategic Petroleum Reserve Results and Summary

Maintaining a large supply of oil is far more expensive than SPR’s annual reports imply.
We estimate a range value for this cost of $1.6 to $5.4 billion per year, excluding unrecognized
declines in asset and inventory values.  The large subsidy value is due to the billions of dollars in
capital that are invested in an enterprise, but do not produce income for long periods of time.

Our analysis does not attempt to answer the question of whether this program is a good or
a bad investment.  Even at $5.4 billion per year,  SPR may be a cost-effective way for the country
to protect against the many undesirable economic impacts of oil supply disruptions.  Shifting full
responsibility for this function to private firms may not be a feasible alternative.  Because many
benefits  of  price  stability  accrue  to  oil  consumers  rather  than  producers,  it  is  unlikely  that
individual producers would voluntarily establish  adequate  oil  stockpiles  to  provide  the  level  of
protection now provided by SPR.  Thus, it is possible that SPR can only exist as a government
service.  Nevertheless, the full cost of providing this service, including financing costs, should be
borne by oil consumers, rather than the general taxpayer.91  As with the defense costs described
earlier  in  this  chapter,  charging  the  costs  directly  to  oil  consumers  will  contribute  to  more
accurate price signals that promote increased conservation and a shift to alternatives.

90  While  severe  supply  disruptions  could  drive  up  the  market  price  of  oil  by  more  than  50  percent,  the
limited drawdown capacity of the reserves (3.9 million barrels per day) means that it would take four to six months
to fully put SPR oil on the market.  This would reduce the Reserve’s ability to capitalize on the largest prices spikes,
which do not tend to last that long.  In addition, since the purpose of the reserve is to reduce the price spike, sales are
likely to be aimed more at reestablishing price stability than maximizing sale revenues.

91 DOE notes that the “United States is unique among oil stockpiling countries in assigning all of the cost of
the  Reserve  to  the  general  taxpayer.    Most  other  stockpiling  countries  partially  shift  the  cost  burden  to  the  oil
industry by requiring that their oil companies maintain inventories in excess of working needs.”  U.S. Department of
Energy, Office of Strategic Petroleum Reserve, “Opportunity for Public Comment on Strategic Petroleum Reserve
Policy,” Federal Register, April 24, 1997, obtained from http://www.fe.doe.gov/spr/sprfedrg.html on March 5, 1998.

SUMMARY

Disruptions in the supply of oil and increases in oil's price can have enormous deleterious
impacts on both the U.S. and global economies.  As DOE's Deputy Secretary pointed out, price
shocks  and  supply  disruptions  have  been  followed  by  recessions  three  times  in  the  past  25
years.92  To protect the U.S. economy, the Department of Defense spends billions of dollars each
year to ensure a stable flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, and the Department of Energy spends
billions more to maintain a stockpile of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  We estimate that
these  measures  cost  $12  billion  to  $29  billion  in  1995.    Because  these  costs  are  borne  by  the
general  taxpayer,  they  are  not  reflected  in  the  price  of  oil,  preventing  energy  markets  from
functioning properly.  Oil supply security is by far the largest area of subsidies to oil.  Unless the
costs of this security are borne directly by oil producers and consumers through additional user
fees on oil, large distortions in energy markets and uninformed decision-making will continue.

SHIFTING ACCIDENT, CLOSURE AND/OR
POST-CLOSURE LIABILITIES TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR

CHAPTER 5

The environmental and human health risks associated with different forms of energy vary
in nature and magnitude.  To address the risks posed by oil, production and transportation sites
require decommissioning and cleanup once they are taken out of service.  A substantial effort is
also  necessary  to  safeguard  against  accidental  releases,  such  as  oil  spills,  and  to  remediate
contamination from spills that do occur.  Both the procedures to manage risks and the costs of
contamination impose financial liabilities.  To the extent that these liabilities are absorbed by the
general public, and not oil firms, they constitute subsidies to oil. These subsidies hide important
information about the costs of oil and put cleaner forms of energy at a competitive disadvantage.
Only by requiring oil companies to pay the full cost of oil-related risks can informed decisions
and fair competition occur between oil and cleaner energy sources.

This chapter examines subsidies from three areas of oil-related liability in detail:  oil well
plugging  and  abandonment  (including  both  onshore  and  offshore  wells);  oil  spill  liability;  and
pipeline decommissioning.   We  evaluate  these  liabilities  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  they
are internalized by the oil companies, and we estimate the value of  risks  that are shifted to the
public sector.

These three examples speak to a much larger issue in the natural resource subsidy arena.
Many  industries  commonly  shift  accident,  closure,  and  post-closure  liabilities  to  the  state.
Business enterprises are focused on the short-term:  putting a plant in operation, meeting payroll,
and selling what they have produced.  It is often easy for oil companies to overlook the gradual
build-up  of  environmental  liabilities  because  most  contamination  does  not  affect  immediate
operations.  Output is not reduced, and insurance rates do not rise, because firms generally do not
have insurance for environmental contamination.91

91  The  availability  of  environmental  insurance  for  chronic  releases  remains  extremely  limited  within  the
U.S.    See  Bruce  McKenney  and  Doug  Koplow,  Improving  Access-to-Capital,  Site  Transition,  and  Brownfield
Redevelopment Through More Effective Environmental Risk Management, Cambridge, MA:  Industrial Economics,
Inc., prepared for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, February 1998.

Lenders  may  worry that the contaminated  property  can  no  longer  serve  as  collateral  for
loans;  however,  many  of  the  small  operations  that  pose  the  largest  risks  may  not  receive
financing through banks anyway.

Accident  liabilities  are  generally  more  difficult  to  hide.    While  small  oil  leaks  may
continue undetected over time, large spills attract attention.  Nevertheless, firms may be able to
save money by purchasing lower levels of insurance coverage than necessary.  We examine the
issue of oil spill liability in greater detail below.

Closure and post-closure liabilities fall into two categories.  The first involves a backlog
of  contamination  caused  before  environmental  regulations  were  instituted  or  properly
functioning.  These liabilities represent subsidies to past oil producers rather than to present ones,
though  the  environmental  problems  associated  with  them  are  very  real.    The  second  category
involves  firms'  present  methods  of  controlling  their  closure  and  post-closure  liabilities.    While
we examine both issues  of liability below,  we  count  only  subsidies  to  current  producers in our
subsidy totals.

Governments have recognized that, without action, they could well inherit the messes oil
firms  leave  behind.    Over  the  past  twenty  years,  both  the  federal  government  and  many  states
have  taken  increasing  precautions  to  ensure  that  environmental  liabilities  are  not  ignored  by
operating  businesses  and  potentially  transferred  to  the  public.    Oil  shippers  must  purchase
certificates of financial responsibility, guaranteeing a pre-set level of financial coverage in case
of an oil spill.  A number of state and federal taxes provide supplemental oil spill funds.  Certain
types of processing operations are required to set aside closure and post-closure trust funds.  Oil
lease holders must post bonds that require a third party to pay for remediation if the lease holder
itself is insolvent.  Many states also levy taxes on new oil production to finance abandoned well
plugging  funds  that  help  pay  reclamation  and  remediation  costs  associated  with  defunct  oil
production  sites.    Finally,  governments  can  use  environmental  litigation  to  recover  additional
costs and damages resulting from improper closure and remediation.

Despite these important steps, substantial public liabilities remain with respect to properly
closing oil wells.  These arise from insufficient collections to address the backlog of abandoned
well  sites,  and  from  insufficient  bonding  levels  to  adequately  protect  the  public  sector  from
having to use general tax revenues to address future site closure and reclamation.  The adequacy
of financial coverage for oil spills is uncertain, as there are a number of court cases pending that
could greatly affect the portion of oil spill liability borne by the general taxpayer in the event of a
large spill.  The liabilities associated with pipeline decommissioning are poorly characterized and
did not permit a subsidy estimate.

5.1

OIL WELL PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT

Oil  is  extracted  from  underground  reserves  by  drilling  from  the  surface  into  the  oil
reserve.  As oil is extracted, well pressure tends to drop.  Well operators often reinject fluids or
natural  gas  into  the  ground  to  keep  the  well  pressure  up  and  the  oil  flowing.    A  single  oil
extraction well may be supported by a number of reinjection wells.  All of these wells must be

5-2

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

properly  plugged  at  the  conclusion  of  drilling  activity  in  order  to  prevent  migration  of
hydrocarbons  or  contaminated  brines  into  drinking  water  resources.92    In  addition  to  requiring
plugging, offshore wells are generally supported by an offshore platform of some sort that must
be dismantled and removed at the end of production.

From the perspective of oil well operators, dismantling offshore rigs, plugging wells, and
remediating  any  environmental  damage  caused  during  drilling  are  economic  burdens  requiring
cash outlays at a time when the sites are no longer producing oil.  For large oil companies, the
costs  are  relatively  insignificant.    However,  many  wells  are  sold  by  the  large  companies  to
smaller  operators  as  production  and  returns  decline.    The  responsibility  for  proper  closure  is
transferred as well.  While Federal agencies will not approve a lease transfer without believing
that the new owner is financially capable of properly closing the site, our analysis of existing data
suggest that comprehensive financial assurance for these new owners is often lacking.

As noted above, federal agencies and most state governments require oil well operators to
purchase some form of bond prior to commencing drilling activity.  The bonds (or other similar
financial assurance mechanisms) guarantee that the costs of properly closing wells will be paid
up to the bond limit by a third party (such as an insurance company) if the original well operators
are financially insolvent.  Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the financial assurance requirements
is hindered both by the large number of wells drilled before the rules took effect and by required
levels  of  assurance  that  are  too  low  to  cover  the  real  cost  of  well  closures.    When  financial
assurances  are  inadequate,  the  public  bears  the  excess  liability,  a  cost  that  is  not  reflected  in
current petroleum prices.

5.1.1    Plugging and Remediating Onshore Oil Wells

The scale of unfunded oil well closure liabilities is substantial.  The owners of many oil
wells are small and financially strapped.  Often, they have purchased wells (and their associated
closure liability) from major oil companies as well production declined.93  Many of these owners
are unlikely to have the financial resources to properly close their sites.

92  There  are  a  number  of  known  cases  of  contamination  from  oil  wells.    See  U.S.  General  Accounting
Office,  Drinking  Water:  Safeguards  are  not  Preventing  Contamination  from  Injected  Oil  and  Gas  Wastes,
GAO/RCED-89-97, July 1989.

93 Within the State of Texas, for example, major  oil  companies  sell  wells  to  large  independent  producers
when production falls to 10 barrels per day.  The large independents, in turn, sell to “mom and pop” operators when
production  falls  to  3  barrels  per  day.    Thus,  as  revenues  fall  and  the  time  for  closure  approaches,  the  financial
stability  of  the  owners  actually  decreases.    David  Garlick,  former  head  of  the  Oil  and  Gas  Division  of  the  Texas

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) estimates that 2.7 million oil
and  gas  wells  have  been  drilled  since  state-level  well  regulations  were  instituted.94    Of  this
amount,  IOGCC  estimates  that  63,400  are  abandoned  with  no  known  operator  (referred  to  as
orphan wells).  IOGCC estimates that, in the “unlikely” event that all of the orphan wells had to
be  plugged  and  abandoned  (P&A),  the  cost  to  the  public  sector  would  be  $343  million,  or  an
average  of  $5,400  per  well.95    In  fact,  at  some  point  these  wells  will  have  to  be  plugged  and
abandoned, and it is unclear who other than the public sector will do so.

The  IOGCC  data  provided  a  starting  point  for  our  estimate  of  residual  on-shore  well
liabilities.    We  believe  IOGCC's  data  understate  the  liabilities  by  a  large  margin  due  to  the
following weaknesses:

•

Cost  Data  Incomplete.    Properly  closing  an  oil  well  involves  not  only
plugging and abandoning it, but also assessing and remediating any on-site
contamination.    In  addition,  full  costing  of  this  process  for  orphan  wells
includes  both  the  payments  that  governments  make  to  contractors  for
services  and  the  direct  equipment  and  personnel  costs  the  government
itself  incurs  to  run  the  program.    IOGCC’s  estimate  of  $5,400  per  well
represents a simple average of reported costs, but many states report only
the  funds  paid  to  P&A  contractors.96    The  estimate  misses  remediation
costs and public-sector costs associated with P&A program oversight.  For
the  subset  of  states  within  the  IOGCC  survey  that  did  incorporate
remediation  costs  into  their  reported  data,  the  average  full  cost  of  well
closure  was  between  $9,500  and  $19,200.97    These  costs  provide  a
reasonable  minimum  target  for  bonding  requirements  at  on-going
operations.98

94 See Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, Ad Hoc Idle Well Committee, Produce or Plug: The

Dilemma over the Nation’s Idle Oil and Gas Wells, December 1996, p. 5 (cited as “IOGCC, 1996”).

95 The cost estimate for plugging a well represents the average spending per well by state funds developed
to plug abandoned wells.  (IOGCC, 1996, 43).  Data reported by the states are somewhat inconsistent, and many do
not include costs of site assessments, site remediation, or the public sector’s full personnel and equipment costs for
overseeing these programs.

96 This discrepancy is exemplified by the State of Texas.  While IOGCC’s data for Texas show average well
closure  costs  of  only  $4,300,  further  evaluation  found  that  this  figure  includes  only  the  funds  paid  to  vendors  for
P&A  services.    Rough  estimates  for  other  related  costs  for  any  well  requiring  remediation  suggest  a  fully  costed
average  of  over  $14,000  per  well.    U.S.  Bureau  of  Land  Management,  Oil  and  Gas  Program,  Bonding/Unfunded
Liability Review, March 1995, p. E-16; John Tinterra, Texas Railroad Commission, personal communication, March

97 The subset of states comprises Pennsylvania, Ohio, and California.  These states were identified based on
a conversation with James Erb, Chairman of the IOGCC Ad Hoc Well Committee that prepared the Produce or Plug
report, October 21, 1997.

federal property to $20,000 per well.  U.S. Bureau of Land Management, March 1995, p. ES-1.

•

Well Universe Incomplete.  The focus of IOGCC’s analysis is on orphan
wells only.  Public liabilities are also affected by a host of other types of
sites.    For  example,  there  are  hundreds  of  thousands  of  “pre-regulatory”
wells with no bonding drilled prior to the development of state regulations.
The condition of many of these is poorly characterized, and it is likely that
some may require additional public funding in order to address incomplete
remediation  or  abandonment  activities.    In  addition,  there  are  nearly
600,000  operating  or  idle  oil  wells  that  appear  to  have  bonding  levels
below the expected cost of full well closure99.  For each of these wells, the
public sector is acting as a de facto insurer.

Our estimate for the public liability for plugging and remediating onshore wells (shown in
Exhibit 5-1) involves a number of steps.  First, we estimate a more realistic average value for the
full cost of oil well closure; this value sets the floor for appropriate bonding levels.  Second, we
adjust IOGCC  figures for the number of  wells requiring  or  receiving  public  subsidy  to  include
both  a  small  fraction  of  the  pre-regulatory  wells  and  idle  and  operating  wells  with  inadequate
bonding.  Third, we develop a weighted average value for current bond coverage, which allows
us to calculate how much higher existing bonding coverage needs to be to reach the average full
cost of closure.  Finally, we calculate the cost of purchasing this additional coverage in the surety
market.

Throughout our analysis, we have pro-rated all IOGCC data on oil and gas wells to reflect
the  oil  subsector  only.    In  addition,  we  have  separated  inadequate  collections  to  close  past
abandoned  sites  from  the  annual  subsidy  that  results  from  unrealistically  low  bonding  levels
today.    The  values  shown  for  residual  liabilities  on  past  operations  have  already  been  credited
with  user  fees  levied  in  many  states  on  oil  producers  for  well  plugging  and  abandonment
(“plugging funds”).100  Although we report liabilities for past operations, we do not count them in
our subsidy totals because they represent a past benefit to producers.

Our estimates for under-bonding for existing onshore wells are likely to be too low for a
number  of  reasons.    First,  we  calculate  existing  bonding  levels  using  the  state  bonding
requirements  for  the  deepest  wells.    Shallower  wells  will  have  lower  bonding  requirements,  in
which case we have overstated their current bonding levels.  Second, we use a premium rate for
on-shore bonds that is lower than the actual losses incurred on on-shore policies during the 1989
to 1993 period for which we have data.  To remain viable, surety companies must collect enough
in premiums to cover losses and earn a profit, which suggests they charge bonding rates higher
than  the  5.5  percent  premium  we  have  assumed  for  the  average  firm.    Third,  we  use  average
liabilities  as  our  target  for  an  appropriate  bonding  level  when,  in  fact,  surety  requirements

99  David  Garlick  notes  that  many  of  these  operators  may  be  too  financially  weak  to  obtain  or  pay  for

bonding even if they wanted to.  Garlick, personal communication, March 13, 1996.

100 The contribution of these funds appears inadequate to fully address the total well liability.  Only 13,000
wells had been plugged since the start of the funds through the end of 1994, a period of 10 to as many as 40 years
depending on the state.  Meanwhile, IOGCC estimates the known plugging backlog at nearly 38,000 wells.  (IOGCC,
1996, p. 43).

Notes:
(1) Data on oil and gas wells have been pro-rated to oil based on the ratio of historic oil versus gas plugging activity.
(2)

IOGCC estimates for average plugging and abandonment costs do not include remediation for many states.  Values shown in this table represent an average
high and an average low P&A plus remediation costs for the states within the IOGCC survey that were identified by the study's coordinator as including
all necessary cost elements.

(3) The well count has been scaled to eliminate double-counting of an estimated 10 percent of wells under federal jurisdiction that are also under state oversight.
(4) The plugging fund offset was calculated using the average annual spending on well plugging and abandonment by state funds based on data in the IOGCC survey.
(5) Bonding levels vary across states.  Using IOGCC survey data, we calculated the weighted average bonding level for oil producing states.  The level shown

represents an upper bound for two reasons.  First, it assumes the highest bonding level, though in reality this level applies only to the deepest wells.  Second,
many operators will have a blanket bond, translating to a much lower level of coverage per well than is assumed here.

(6) Bonding rates vary by state and producer, with a range of between 1 and 10 percent according to BLM's Bonding/Unfunded Liability Review.  We have used

a simple average in our estimates, which probably understates the average premium cost.  Actual national statistical data on onshore bonding losses between
1989 and 1993 shows a loss ratio of 10 percent.  Long-term premiums must at least equal loss ratios plus a minimum profit margin if the industry is to remain
viable.  See Surety Association of America.

(7) We count only the bonding shortfall on current operations in our subsidy total figures, as our goal is to measure subsidies to existing operations.
For industry to cover remediation and plugging costs at past sites as well, user fees would need to rise an additional $50 to $100 million per year.

normally aim to protect against above average losses.101  Nonetheless, we estimate a shortfall in
onshore  bonding  coverage  for  the  current  well  portfolio  of  between  $2.1  and  $8.2  billion  per
year, which would require an additional $120 to $450 million per year in bonding premiums.

The wide difference between our high and low estimates is driven by the range we use for
the total cost of  well closure.   By including  this  bonding  shortfall  in  our  calculation  of  federal
subsidies,  we  are  making  the  implicit  assumption  that  the  federal  government  is  the  insurer  of
last resort.

5.1.2    Closure of Offshore Oil Platforms

As  noted  above,  the  problem  with  oil  platforms  is  similar  to  that  of  onshore  wells:
operators may not have the funds or the desire to incur substantial costs to properly shut down
operations  at  the  end  of  a  facility’s  operating  life.    As  with  many  onshore  wells,  this  potential
problem  is  exacerbated  by  the  steady  transfer  of  offshore  leases  from  major  oil  companies  to
independents as production declines.102

As with onshore wells, possible public liability remains despite bonding requirements for
offshore  operators.    The  General  Accounting  Office  conducted  a  detailed  study  in  1993
examining offshore drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.  These operations are overseen by
the  Minerals  Management  Service  (MMS),  the  federal  agency  responsible  for  the  Outer
Continental  Shelf  (OCS)  drilling  program.    GAO’s  estimates  for  the  full  cost  of  dismantling
platforms  and  plugging  wells  under  the  OCS  program  ranged  from  $4.2  to  $4.4  billion.  Yet,
GAO found that the surety bonds in place covered only 1.6 percent of this prospective liability.
According to MMS, total offshore liability has since risen to approximately $5.5 billion, of which
approximately $1 billion is covered by surety bonds. 103,104  Although the coverage ratio has risen
from  only  1.6  to  18  percent  over  the  past  four  years,  the  potential  public  exposure  tops  $4.5
billion.

101  Setting  bonding  at  the  average  level  of  losses  means  that  the  public  sector  will  inherit  liabilities  in  a

substantial fraction of the closures.

102 Between 1983 and 1992, the number of independent firms operating offshore leases grew from 38 to 92,
and their share of total operators grew from 61 to 77 percent.  See U.S. House of Representatives, House Committee
on Natural Resources, Democratic Staff Report, “Offshore Benefits,” in Taking from the Taxpayer: Public Subsidies
for  Natural  Resource  Development,  August  1994,  obtained  from  http://www.house.gov/resources/105cong/
democrat/subsidy.htm, October 1997.

103 Both the GAO and the MMS estimates for closure are in nominal rather than net present value terms.
Insurance premiums are based on nominal values as well.  Expectations regarding the fraction of wells likely to be
abandoned in a given year are reflected in the premium rates.

104 The total  liability  includes  $1.5  billion  in  borehole  liability,  $3.4  billion  in  platform  removal  liability,
and  $650  million  in  site  clearance  costs.    Totals  do  not  sum  due  to  rounding.    Carrol  Williams,  U.S.  Minerals
Management Service, personal communications, October 15 and October 28, 1997.

5-7

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Discussions with the Minerals Management Service suggest that one reason the coverage
appears  so  low  is  because  many  of  the  offshore  leases  are  held  by  large,  multinational  oil
companies.    These  firms,  due  to  their  financial  strength,  are  able  to  self-insure  for  the  risks
associated  with  lease  abandonment.    Although  they  are  not  counted  in  the  bonded  coverage
category, they pose virtually no risk of lease abandonment.

MMS does not adjust its bonding numbers for this factor, but we have tried to do so here.
According to MMS, the total number of active leases is a reasonable proxy for the share of total
liability  held.    Statistics  for  the  1990-96  period  show  that  major  oil  companies  held  1,670  of
4,862 total leases, or 34 percent.105  Pro-rating total liabilities in the Gulf (the location of the vast
majority of offshore activity) suggests that $1.9 billion of total liability is held by the majors, and
assumed  to  be  self-insured.    Combining  bonding  levels  with  self-insurance  suggests  a  total
coverage of $2.9 billion and a net shortfall of nearly $2.7 billion.

Unlike  the  onshore  wells,  most  of  the  offshore  wells  continue  to  operate.    Thus,
increasing the bonding requirements for owners that are unable to cover the full liability through
their  financial  strength  can  address  nearly  all  of  the  public  offshore  exposure.    The  cost  of
offshore bonding varies based on a number of factors, including the number of wells, the age of
the  drilling  equipment,  the  reserves  left  underneath  the  well,  the  amount  of  collateral,  and  the
financial  strength  of  the  owners.    The  cost  of  coverage  ranges  from  one  to  four  percent  of  the
bonded  amount  depending  on  these  factors.    However,  the  one  percent  cost  applies  only  to
financially  strong  operators  with  full  collateral  for  the  coverage.    A  two  percent  rate  is  the
realistic minimum for the independents.106  These are the firms likely to make up the bulk of the
unfunded liability in the Gulf.  Based on a premium rate of two to four percent, addressing the
liability shortfall would cost existing producers $53 to $106 million per year (see Exhibit 5-2).
Currently, the federal taxpayer bears this liability, and the shortfall constitutes a subsidy to oil.  It
is unclear how new bonding requirements that took effect at the end of 1997 will affect the level
of residual subsidy.107

105 Data on lease counts were reported by MMS based on information assembled by J.M. Dodson, Inc., an
independent firm that analyzes data on offshore leases.  According to MMS, the share owned by the major oil firms
includes  all  leases  with  any  percentage  of  ownership  by  the  majors.    Joint  and  several  liability  provisions  enable
MMS  to  recover  up  to  100  percent  of  the  closure  and  remediation  costs  from  any  owner.    Williams,  personal
communications, October 15 and 28, 1997.

107 MMS published a final rule stipulating higher surety bond coverage on offshore leases.  It was supposed
to take effect by December 1997.  See U.S. Minerals Management Service, “Surety Bond Requirements Amended:

OIL SPILLS

Oil  is  a  globally  traded  commodity  with  millions  of  barrels  moved  every  day.    Oil
pipelines  sometimes  leak,  and  shipping  vessels  sometimes  fail  due  to  human  error,  natural
events,  or  age.108    The  resulting  spills  (almost  14,000  are  reported  in  the  U.S.  each  year)
contaminate  the  surrounding  ecosystems.109    While  accidents  are  unlikely  to  be  eliminated
entirely,  governments  can  at  least  ensure  that  the  private  entities  profiting  from  the  movement
and sale of oil bear full liability for any spills that do occur.

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), passed in the wake of the large Exxon Valdez spill,
establishes the primary federal requirements for oil spill-related financial assurance and liability.
OPA clarified responsible parties’ liability, making them directly liable for oil spill cleanups and
damages  to  natural  resources.    Strict  liability  limits  for  tanker  vessels  were  increased  to  eight
times the previous requirements, and tankers operating in U.S. waters were required to purchase
a  Certificate  of  Financial  Responsibility  (COFR),  demonstrating  their  ability  to  pay  potential
spill-related costs.  While the law clarified issues of liability, it also placed limits on that liability,
raising the possibility that liability caps might be too low to cover reasonably expected costs of a
spill.

OPA established a two-tiered system of  financial responsibility  for spills.   The  first tier
includes  the  COFR,  with  limits  for  any  particular  shipper  based  on  the  size  of  the  ship  (see
Exhibit 5-3 below).  Larger vessels are required to have higher coverage because they can cause
larger spills.  This coverage is strictly limited to the shipper regardless of fault; cargo owners are
not held liable for oil spills.110  The Coast Guard’s National Pollution Funds Center administers
the Certificate of Financial Responsibility program to certify vessels that provide  the  necessary
financial assurance and to take enforcement actions against violators.

108 An estimated 85 percent of all tanker accidents resulting in oil spills are due to human error.  See Odd
Auker  Hassel,  “Smooth  Sailing  or  Rough  Waters?    The  Tanker  Industry  and  the  Environmental  Challenges,”

COFR  premiums  have  cost  private  shipping  interests  approximately  $70  million
annually.111    However,  this  first  tier  coverage  restricts  their  liability  to  a  maximum  of  $296
million on any single spill.112  A vessel the size of the Exxon Valdez would have a vessel liability
limit of only $142 million on any single spill, far less than the billions of dollars of costs caused
by a spill of the Valdez magnitude.113

The second tier of coverage is in the form of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF).
OSTLF incurs cleanup, assessment, and restoration costs in excess of a vessel’s liability limit.  It
also funds immediate work on a spill, allowing a rapid response despite potential problems with
collecting funds from responsible parties.  OPA established the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund by

fund reached its statutory limit of one billion dollars.

The  fund  may  be  used  for  a  host  of  spill-related  purposes,  including  removal,
remediation,  damage  assessments,  administration  of  OPA  and  the  fund,  oil  spill  research  and
development,  and  payments  of  residual  damages  not  recovered  from  responsible  parties.  OPA
stipulates that expenditures from the fund are limited to one billion dollars for any one incident,
with a cap of $500 million on damage assessments and claims.  While the fund clearly provides
intra-industry  cross-subsidies  (i.e.,  the  costs  of  a  spill  from  one  transporter  in  excess  of  its
liability  are  borne  by  taxes  collected  from  other  parties),  it  does  provide  a  mechanism  for
ensuring that the second tier of coverage is provided by the oil industry as a whole rather than by
the taxpayer.

The key question from our perspective is whether the  combined liability  limits  for both
tiers  are  sufficient  to  cover  the  costs  associated  with  spills.    If  not,  the  public  sector  may  bear
significant residual risks.  The answer to this question depends on the likelihood that a spill will
exceed the cap and whether the cap will actually be enforced.

5.2.1    Likelihood of a Spill Exceeding OPA Liability Caps

In addition to financial assurance provisions, OPA included the following elements that

have helped to reduce the likelihood and severity of spills.

•

•

Increased  Penalties.    OPA  substantially  increased  administrative,  civil,
and criminal penalties for oil spills.115

Improved Tankers.  OPA requires new vessels carrying oil in U.S. waters
to have double hulls by 2015.116

114 Congress created OSLTF in 1986, but did not provide the authorization necessary for it to collect or use
funds.  OSLTF  was  inactive  until  Congress  granted  the  necessary  authorization  following  the  Exxon  Valdez  spill.
U.S. Coast Guard, National Pollution Funds Center, National Pollution Funds Center 1996 Annual Report, p. 13.

115 Administrative penalties can reach $125,000.  The mandatory civil penalty was increased from $5,000
per  offense  to  $25,000  per  day  and  up  to  $1,000  per  barrel  of  oil  disposed.    Criminal  penalties  reach  as  high  as
$25,000 per day of violation and/or imprisonment for up to a year.  Knowingly discharging oil has penalties of up to
$50,000 per day of violation and 3 years imprisonment.  (Sankovitch et al., p. 59).

116  Implementation  issues  such  as  the  strength  of  the  hull,  the  space  between  the  hulls,  and  the  allowed
single hulling of areas carrying fuel for the ship have reduced the actual protection provided.  Sankovitch et al., pp.
15-17.

•

Improved  Cleanup  Response.    Oil  shippers  must  contract  for  oil  spill
cleanup equipment to be positioned  and  readied  at  various  points  around
the country, with requirements stipulated in terms of the size of spill that
can be addressed in a first, second, and third wave response.

While all of these factors help to reduce the likelihood of spills exceeding the available
liability coverage, it does not eliminate the possibility.  The Exxon Valdez spill cost $2 billion to
clean up, with  an additional damage award of  billions  more.117   While  the  costs  of  an  oil  spill
vary widely, even a much smaller spill than the Valdez could exhaust both the COFR coverage
and the entire collection of the Oil Spill Trust Fund.118 While OPA originally allowed the NPFC
to petition Congress  for  borrowing  authority  from  the  U.S.  Treasury  if  the  costs  incurred  for  a
spill exceeded the capacity of  the fund, this authority expired in 1994.  Darrel Nieley,  NPFC’s
Chief of Financial Management, was uncertain what would happen currently in such an event.119
Some risk remains that a portion of the costs of larger spills will be borne by the taxpayer due to
the caps on both the liability coverage and the Oil Spill Trust Fund.

5.2.2    Definitiveness of Vessel Liability Caps

A  second  central  issue  affecting  whether  OPA  confers  residual  liabilities  to  the  public
sector involves the stringency to which the vessel liability limits are adhered.  One industry trade
publication  noted  that  while  OPA  established  liability  limits,  it  “severely  restricted  the  limits’
applicability.”120  Since the liability limits are not applicable to spills resulting from a violation of
a federal regulation or safety standard, industry anticipates  that  “most  spills will  breach  OPA’s
defenses.”121  Fears of unlimited liability associated with spills have led to a reduction in lease
financing of tankers and other lending for tanker purchases.122  Up to a point, a higher effective

Legacy of Confusion,” Asset Finance & Leasing Digest, May 1995, pp. 24-27.

118 Based on an analysis by Anderson and Talley, cleanup costs per ton of oil range from $1,610 to $40,880
(1995 dollars).  Environmental damage costs add an additional $1,660 to $11,610 per ton spilled (also 1995 dollars).
The costs per ton for the Valdez spill appear to have exceeded the upper range value in Anderson and Talley by a
wide margin.  While the two tiers of liability coverage appear sufficient for most spills, larger releases of over two
million  gallons  (there  have  been  at  least  five  since  1976)  risk  depleting  all  available  funds.    Eric  Anderson  and

cap could reduce the residual liability borne by the public.  However, if concerns over unlimited
liability become too severe, insurers may pull out of the market, leaving the public with a much
larger exposure than before.

Several spills have exceeded  the  responsible party’s maximum liability.   In these cases,
the government has tried to recover the full costs of the spill from the oil shipper or its insurer.
For example, the federal government has incurred costs of $82 million thus far for a 1994 spill
near San Juan, Puerto Rico; however, the liability limit for the responsible vessel was only $10
million.123  NPFC has attempted to recover the full costs incurred by the government for this and
other spills, including costs in excess of the responsible vessels’ liability limits.  These cases are
currently in litigation.  Their outcomes may affirm the limitations on financial risk set by OPA or
invalidate those limitations, at least under certain circumstances.

State  oil  spill  regulations  also  play  a  role  in  the  ultimate  liability  borne  by  the  private
sector.  OPA allows states to implement their own liability limits.  Using this authority, 30 states
have  their  own  oil  pollution  liability  laws,  and  as  many  as  19  states  impose  strict  unlimited
liability on shippers.  In addition, although the federal government restricts liability to shippers,
some states impose liability on cargo owners and charterers as well.124

The  impact  of  state  laws  on  the  federal  caps  also  remain  to  be  determined  through
litigation.  A recent court decision seemed to uphold both the priority of federal liability limits
over  state,  and  the  liability  caps  established  by  OPA.125    If  this  ruling  delineates  a  trend,  large
spills,  especially  if  caused  by  independents  with  little  market  visibility  and  less  to  lose  from
adverse publicity following a spill, will likely be borne in part by the general taxpayer.  However,
given the uncertainty associated with the various ongoing cases, we assume there is no residual
public liability from oil spills, and estimate the subsidy to oil to be zero.

124 State rules seem only to apply in state waters.  Sankovitch, p. 59; “Tanker Owners Cope with OPA,” Oil

and Gas Journal, July 27, 1992.

125 National Shipping Co. of Saudi Arabia v. Moran Trade Corp. of Delaware affirmed that the shipping
company’s liability was capped at $500,000 based on OPA, and that the OPA cap could not be bypassed by state
laws that allow greater recovery.  See “Cleanup Damages for Spills Limited to Those Available Under OPA, Court
Says,” Environment Reporter, September 26, 1997.

5.3

PIPELINE ABANDONMENT126

Due to the hazardous material they transport, crude oil pipelines are potential sources of
environmental contamination.  Current regulations specify response and  reporting  requirements
for contamination events such as oil spills; however, natural resources along pipeline routes may
be contaminated from events that pre-date current regulations or from the gradual accumulation
of  small,  unnoticed  incidents.    State  and  federal  regulatory  agencies  have  requirements  for
properly  closing  pipelines  so  that  they  do  not  pose  continuing  threats  to  the  environment  after
they are abandoned.  However, it is not clear that abandonment regulations fully address possible
site contamination or the permanent removal of  the  lines.127  Nor do they address the  potential
problems that may arise when operators are unable to pay for proper closure procedures.

Pipelines  are  regulated  either  by  state  or  federal  agencies.    The  U.S.  Department  of
Transportation’s  Office  of  Pipeline  Safety  has  regulatory  jurisdiction  over  interstate  pipelines,
and state agencies regulate pipelines that do not cross state boundaries.  Within states, pipeline
regulation may fall under the responsibility of more than one agency.  For example, two separate
offices  within  the  Texas  Railroad  Commission  regulate  pipelines  in  the  State  of  Texas.    The
Pipeline Safety Office has responsibility for major lines (greater than eight inches in diameter),
and  the  Oil  and  Gas  Office  regulates  pipelines  less  than  eight  inches  in  diameter,  which  are
typically gathering lines further upstream (i.e., closer to the production sites).

While cases of abandonment involving interstate and major intrastate pipelines are likely
to  be  less  common,  smaller,  upstream  gathering  pipeline  systems  are  more  dynamic,  with
individual lines closing as wells dry up and production shifts to other locations.  We called state
and  federal  agencies  responsible  for  regulating  oil  pipelines  to  assess  not  only  their  pipeline
abandonment  requirements,  but  their  provisions  for  ensuring  that  operators,  and  not  taxpayers,
finance closure and remediation costs.  The answer from all levels of the regulatory bureaucracy
was  that  pipeline  operators  must  develop  and  provide  details  about  their  operation  and
maintenance  procedures,  including  procedures  for  abandonment.    Operators’  abandonment
procedures  must  address  the  issues  of  safely  disconnecting,  purging,  and  sealing  pipelines.
However, it was not clear whether states and the federal government require environmental site
assessments  to  ensure  that  possible  contamination  is  identified  and  remediated  at  the  time  of
closure, or whether they have guidelines governing the complete removal of defunct pipelines.

126  Information  contained  in  this  section  was  gathered  from  telephone  conversations  with  the  following
people:    (a)  Bill  Dase,  Pipeline  Safety  Office,  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas;  (b)  Buck  Furrow,  U.S.  Office  of
Pipeline Safety; (c) Marty Mathessen, American Petroleum Institute; (d) Paul McKey, Public Affairs, Federal Energy
Regulatory  Commission;  and  (e)  John  Tintera,  Site  Remediation  Group,  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas.
Conversations were held on November 6-7, 1997.

127 The Office of Pipeline Safety (Department of Transportation) does not require pipeline operators to do
site  assessments  and  any  necessary  remediation  at  the  time  of  abandonment;  it  is  unclear  whether  some  other
regulatory  body  makes  these  requirements.    Linda  Dougherty,  Compliance  Office,  U.S.  Office  of  Pipeline  Safety,
Compliance Office, personal communication, November 10, 1997.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

In the event that an operator fails to follow proper abandonment procedures, our contacts
agreed that  their  offices would pursue operators in court,  but they were  generally  unclear  what
would happen if legal action failed because the operator was insolvent or defunct.  In the case of
oil spills, pipeline operators must develop and demonstrate their capability to carry out response
plans.    However,  neither  the  federal  government  nor  the  State  of  Texas  requires  that  operators
demonstrate their ability to pay future closure costs with financial assurances such as insurance
or  bonds.    Some  states,  like  Texas,  may  impose  taxes  on  oil  production  to  finance  trust  funds
capable of paying cleanup and closure costs that are shifted to the state.  It is not clear whether
the  federal  government  and  all  states  have  such  mechanisms  for  shielding  taxpayers  from
pipeline cleanup and closure liability.

Our  conversations  indicate  that  the  issue  of  public  liability  associated  with  pipeline
abandonment is poorly characterized.  While regulatory agencies have procedural requirements,
they apparently do not have specific financial provisions to ensure that any closure and cleanup
costs  remain  in  the  private  sector.    The  magnitude  of  the  problem,  the  historical  cost  of
contamination  from  pipelines,  and  the  current  availability  of  general  trust  funds  to  finance
remediation at abandoned or insolvent sites are all unknown.

5.4

SUMMARY

Governments have implemented a number of new requirements over the past ten years to
reduce  the  likelihood  that  the  taxpayer  will  have  to  pay  for  oil-related  accidents  or  facility
closures.  These are positive steps that should be continued in order to eliminate the remaining
liability  subsidies.    For  example,  state  and  federal  bonding  requirements  for  offshore  well
abandonment  and  remediation  costs  should  be  raised  to  cover  the  remaining  shortfall  in
coverage.  Attention should be given to ongoing litigation that may have impacts on the public's
exposure  to  oil  spill  liabilities,  and  the  poor  characterization  of  potential  liabilities  associated
with pipeline decommissioning should also be addressed to ensure that environmental liabilities
are being adequately internalized.

COST OF ACCESS TO OIL RESOURCES

CHAPTER 6

Selling  public  resources  to  oil  companies  below  fair  market  value  reduces  producers'
production costs.  This chapter provides a broad overview of oil leasing and the manner in which
governments  provide  subsidies  to  producers  through  their  leasing  processes.    In  most  cases,
individual lease decisions will have little  or  no  impact on  world oil  prices.   Rather,  subsidized
leases  increase  producers'  profits  at  the  taxpayer's  expense  or  allow  otherwise  uneconomic
reserves  to  be  developed.    In  the  extreme,  however,  a  major  producing  country  can  affect  the
global price of oil by allowing widespread leasing below fair market value.128

The environmental implications of poor leasing practices can be substantial. Even without
affecting  world  oil  prices,  subsidized  access  to  oil  tends  to  accelerate  the  development  of
particular oil fields, amplifying the direct environmental impacts of production.  If the subsidized
fields happen to be in parts of the world with weak central governments and poor environmental
enforcement, leasing subsidies can also displace more responsible producers in the marketplace.
In addition, to the extent that lease terms do contribute to declining prices, oil consumption rises
with  all  of  its  concomitant  environmental  impacts.    Finally,  subsidies  in  one  country  may  put
pressure on competing nations to increase subsidies to their own industries in order to maintain
their competitiveness, exacerbating the problem.

The first part of this chapter provides background on leasing.  The chapter then discusses
the  cost  of  managing  oil  production  on  federal  lands  and  identifies  potential  lease-related
subsidies.    Little  quantitative  data  are  available  for  estimating  leasing  subsidies.    We  have
provided  estimates  of  specific  subsidies  where  possible,  and  evaluate  other  potential  subsidies
qualitatively.

6.1

A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF LEASING

A  lease  is  a  sale  of  rights  held  by  the  public  to  another  party  for  exploration  and
development.  Leases allow the buyer to look for oil, to hold  the  rights  for a limited  period  of

128 Market prices regularly react to changes in the supply of oil.  When Saudi Arabia cuts production, prices
often rise.  When large new oil fields come on line, prices fall.  The terms of access to large new oil regions such as
Kazakhstan  will  affect  their  supply  costs,  potentially  impacting  both  the  equilibrium  price  for  oil  and  determining
which fields in other parts of the world become relative high cost producers.

time  without  producing,  and  to  extract  and  sell  oil.    The  following  are  the  core  elements  of
leases:

•

•

•

•

Location/Size.    Oil  leases  carefully  stipulate  the  location  in  which  the
purchaser may look for oil.  Larger leases have higher probabilities (other
things being equal) of containing oil.   However,  leases  that  are  too  large
(or the combination of too many small ones) are considered monopolistic
by the federal government and regulated.

Duration.    A  lease  is  an  option  to  look  for  oil  in  a  certain  place  for  a
certain  period  of  time.    The  owner  can  generally  hold  the  lease  without
developing  it  for  up  to  ten  years.    Once  oil  development  has  begun,  the
lessee  typically  retains  the  lease  rights  until  the  oil  reserve  is  exhausted.
The time cap on the period a lease can be held without producing ensures
that valuable public resources are not held inaccessible by the lessee.

Financial Assurance.  The development of oil leases can create liabilities
for  the  public  sector  owner  in  the  form  of  environmental  contamination,
well  plugging,  and  platform  removal  (for  offshore  locations).    Lessees
must  post  an  acceptable  form  of  financial  assurance  to  convince  the
government of their ability to pay for any necessary cleanup.  As discussed
in  Chapter  5,  these  assurance  requirements  are  not  always  set  at  an
adequate level.

Payment  Terms.    There  are  three  main  components  of  lease  pricing:
royalties, rentals and bonuses.

- Royalties.  Royalties are a percentage of the value of production that is
paid to the lease owner.  They represent risk sharing between the seller
and  the  buyer.    If  the  well  does  not  produce,  the  buyer  pays  no
royalties.  If the price of oil rises or falls, the royalty payments adjust
automatically.  Royalty rates vary by lease area and lessor.

- Rentals.    Lease  rentals  are  “holding”  charges  that  are  paid  to  owners
until lessees begin producing oil.  Rental payments compensate owners
for the time their resources are not being produced, and help to prevent
firms  from  speculatively  holding  too  many  lease  tracts.    Rental  rates
sometimes rise as the number of years without development increases,

6-2

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

and are sometimes recoverable against royalties owed once production
begins.    On  federal  leases,  rental  payments  stop  once  production  and
royalties begin.129

- Bonuses.    Where  the  value  of  an  oil  lease  appears  particularly  large,
buyers may agree to make an additional cash payment to the seller for
rights to a tract.  These payments are in addition to rents and royalties.
Bonus payments help ensure that the seller is adequately compensated
for  especially  valuable  reserves.    There  is  some  interplay  between
royalty  levels  and  bonus  levels.    For  example,  lower  royalties  make
tracts more valuable, potentially resulting in higher bonus bids.

6.1.1    Interactions Between Payment Terms

Lease value is primarily driven by three factors:  the  amount  of oil, the  market price of
oil,  and  the  cost  of  extracting  it  from  the  lease  and  getting  it  to  market.    The  projected  gross
revenues from a particular lease are equal to the quantity of oil to be extracted multiplied by the
anticipated price per barrel.  To determine the lease value, all direct costs to develop the field,
extract the oil, and transport it to market must be deducted from the projected gross revenues.  In
addition, all levies on production, including local, state, and federal taxes, and all royalty, rental,
and  bonus  payments  are  figured  into  the  equation.    Unless  the  residual  profit  is  high  enough,
firms will not be interested in developing a lease.

This simplified overview of leasing illustrates two important points.  First, the amount a
firm will pay for a lease (generally reflected in the bonus payment since all other terms are fixed
by  the  government)  is  determined  by  expected  profits  after  all  levies.    Thus,  in  a  competitive
bidding  market,  charging  a  higher  royalty  rate  may  simply  reduce  the  bid  prices  by  an
approximately  equal  amount.    Second,  nearly  every  component  in  the  calculation  of  expected
profits is uncertain.  Oil prices may decline, or the actual oil on a site may be less than expected,
both  reducing  the  value  of  the  field.    Alternatively,  extraction  costs  may  be  higher  than
anticipated,  or  government  levies  may  change  (if  they  have  not  been  fixed  for  the  life  of  the
property in the original lease agreement).

To  protect  against  uncertainties,  bidders  employ  a  number  of  strategies.    First,  they
require  a  rate  of  return  that  adequately  compensates  them  for  their  risks.    Second,  they  use  a
portfolio  approach,  using  high  profits  on  successful  wells  to  offset  losses  on  dry  ones.    Third,
they share risks whenever possible with the seller.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

The payment terms described above represent a mix of variable payments (royalties and
some  bonuses)  and  fixed  payments  (rentals  and  some  bonuses)  that  share  the  risk  and  rewards
from  oil  exploration  between  the  lessor  and  the  lessee  (i.e.,  the  government  and  private
companies).    However,  this  method  of  risk  sharing  does  not  always  guarantee  an  optimal
outcome  for  either  party.    For  example,  larger  fixed  costs  increase  the  risks  to  the  buyer,  but
reduce the variability in revenues to the government.  If a lease has less oil than anticipated, the
buyer may lose money on the well.

Lease issues also extend beyond the composition of variable and fixed costs.  Royalties
themselves  can  introduce  distortions  in  oil  development.    Although  royalties  rise  and  fall  in
dollar terms, they remain a fixed percentage of the price of oil.  As a well is depleted and the cost
of extracting oil rises, the required royalty payments do not change.  Thus, well production may
be stopped prematurely because the cost of production plus fixed royalties is too high to allow a
return on the remaining recoverable oil.  Reducing the royalty rate, it is argued, would allow this
“marginal” production to continue until  additional resources  are  depleted.    Such  reductions  are
commonly implemented at both the state and federal levels.

To avoid premature well closures, another oft-suggested modification to leasing rules is
to use variable rather than fixed royalties, linking payments to profitability rather than sale price.
Royalties would be set at lower percentages when profits from a particular well are low, and rise
to higher than normal percentages when profits rise.

While  variable  royalties  theoretically  encourage  more  complete  oil  extraction  from  a
reserve,  their  practical  use  is  challenging.    Although  production  is  easy  to  measure,  profits  are
much more difficult.  A profit-based approach allows well operators to deduct a host of expenses
from  their  revenues  to  calculate  the  basis  of  their  royalty  payments.    They  have  tremendous
opportunities to manipulate the calculation in order to reduce their royalties owed.  This problem
is demonstrated in other sectors of the economy.  For example, there have been numerous legal
suits  in  the  movie  picture  industry  over  movies  with  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in
“revenues”  but  zero  “profits.”    To  avoid  this  problem,  industries  (such  as  fast  food)  generally
stick  to  fixed  royalty  structures  in  defining  payment  rates  between  franchises  and  parent
companies.130

In  the  remainder  of  this  chapter,  we  first  discuss  the  cost  of  federal  management  of  oil
leases.  We then apply the general leasing framework discussed above to identify potential lease-
related subsidies for oil production.

130  The  general  issue  underlying  these  examples  --  the  ability  for  corporations  to  artificially  manipulate
profit  levels  to  reduce  their  financial  obligations  to  other  parties  --  also  plays  a  central  role  in  the  taxation  of
international  corporations.    Because  these  firms  buy  and  sell  large  quantities  of  goods  and  services  among  their
various divisions, and can set the prices for these transactions, they can decide which part of their operations should
show  the  profits.    These  prices  are  often  set  to  minimize  the  firms'  tax  (or  royalty)  burden.    See  U.S.  General
Accounting  Office,  International  Taxation:  Problems  Persist  in  Determining  Tax  Effects  of  Intercompany  Prices,

Corporations Need Improvement, September 1994.

6.2 MANAGEMENT OF OIL PRODUCTION ON FEDERAL LANDS

Selling oil from public lands requires government expenditures to run lease sales, oversee
exploration and drilling activity, ensure sites are cleaned up, and collect the proper royalties from
lessees. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are
the  agencies  primarily  responsible  for  managing  and  overseeing  oil  production  on  public  land.
Other  agencies,  such  as  the  Forest  Service  and  the  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs,  are  involved  to  a
lesser degree.  In 1995, MMS and BLM spent approximately $92 and $48 million, respectively,
to  oversee  oil-related  activities,  of  which  approximately  $12.5  million  was  collected  directly
from users.

Within  the  United  States,  these  management  costs  are  mostly  paid  from  general  tax
revenues.    However,  since  the  federal  government  also  collects  oil  royalties  from  the  mineral
sales, the management costs (net of user fees) can be viewed as the government's "overhead" to
collect the revenues from the sale of oil.  The question is whether, once these overhead costs are
deducted from royalties, the public is receiving a fair return on asset sales.  Federal timber sales
are  instructive.    Evaluation  of  timber  sale  receipts  by  independent  analysts  suggest  that  the
government  pays  more  to  make  the  timber  available  for  sale  (including  building  access  roads)
than it actually receives from sales.131

The overhead on oil sales is not as onerous as for timber, and there does appear to be a
healthy  net  gain  from  oil  concessions.    Oil-related  overhead  costs  of  MMS  and  BLM  are
equivalent to about 10 percent of the $1.3 billion in oil royalties collected at the federal level in
1995.132    Even  once  oil  oversight  activities  at  other  federal  agencies  are  added  in,  we  do  not
anticipate the overhead rising above 20 percent of sales revenues.

6.3

KEY ARENAS FOR GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER ACCESS TO OIL

Government  involvement  with  oil  leasing  includes  four  main  spheres  of  control:    the
initial  establishment  of  property  rights,  setting  (or  modifying)  the  terms  for  existing  oil
production, setting the terms for new oil production, and ensuring that access to oil resources is
competitively  determined.    Subsidies  to  producers  can  be  provided  in  any  of  these  areas.    We
summarize these subsidies below, and discuss each area in greater detail in the remainder of this
chapter.

131 According to the analysis, the government lost $375 million on timber sales held in 116 national forests
in 1995.  Randall O'Toole, "Forest-by-Forest Timber Sale Accounting for 1995," Thoreau Institute, obtained from

132 We do not treat oil rents, royalties, and bonuses as subsidy offsets, since they represent payment to the
taxpayer for the sale of publicly owned oil assets.  Nor, however, do we treat the government cost to manage oil sales
as a subsidy to oil.  This decision reflects the necessity of incurring some costs in order to earn the oil royalties in the
first  place,  and  the  relatively  low  level  of  overhead  costs  in  comparison  to  other  natural  resource  areas,  such  as
timber.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Establishment of Property Rights.  When and how governments choose
to establish mineral rights and rectify competing claims on land can reduce
the  cost  of  access  to  oil  resources  substantially.    Government  efforts  to
resolve  property  rights  disputes  can  be  intensified  when  oil  is  at  stake,
with  the  results  often  favorable  to  oil  companies.    The  Alaska  Native
Claims  Settlement  Act  is  one  example  where  the  presence  of  oil  led
induced  the  federal  government  to  actively  arbitrate  land  claims  and
establish control of key oil reserves and transportation corridors.

Subsidies  to  Existing  Oil  Production.    Governments  can  consciously
reduce  the  required  payments  for  existing  leases,  providing  a  potential
windfall to lease owners or encouraging continued production in the face
of  worsening  extraction  economics.    Governments  may  also  provide
subsidies inadvertently, such as through lapses in oversight.

- Failure  to  Meet  Existing  Lease  Terms.    Poor  auditing  practices  by
Federal agencies result in the loss of royalty income, estimated at $50
to $75 million per year for the Bureau of Land Management alone.  Oil
companies  also  reduce  their  contracted  royalty  payments  through  the
use  of  artificial  transfer  prices  that  understate  the  true  value  of  oil
extracted.    This  practice  costs  the  Treasury  $30  to  $130  million  per
year.

- Changes to Existing Terms.  Governments may modify lease terms in
the  middle  of  a  lease  to  encourage  increased  production.    Subsidies
occur when unnecessary reductions are provided to lease holders.

Subsidies  to  New  Production.    Governments  may  provide  special
incentives for new production in order to encourage new activity.  These
subsidies  may  be  targeted  at  job  creation  or  economic  development,  and
can use a host of different approaches.  Examples include royalty relief on
certain  types  of  oil  deposits,  non-competitive  conversion  of  exploration
licenses  into  leases,  relaxation  of  competitive  restrictions  on  lease  size,
and limited public participation and oversight on leasing decisions.

Below-Market  Lease  Sales  Due  to  Faulty  Lease  Auctioning  Process.
Competitive  auctions  potentially  maximize  firms'  payments  for  oil
resources,  but  a  lessor's  failure  to  ensure  that  an  auction  is  truly
competitive  can  enable  firms  to  pay  less  than  the  fair  value  of  a  lease.
Although  uncommon  in  the  United  States,  many  countries  award  oil
concessions  in  a  non-competitive  and  possibly  corrupt  way.    When  this
occurs,  purchasers  realize  windfall  gains,  and  taxpayers  do  not  receive  a
fair return on the public assets sold.

ESTABLISHMENT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS

Developing  oil  fields,  especially  remote  or  inhospitable  ones,  can  cost  hundreds  of
millions  of  dollars.    Without  clear  property  rights,  this  development  will  not  take  place.    In
addition, resolving property disputes can cause delays that are expensive to industries interested
in  investing,  and  may  cause  them  to  focus  their  efforts  elsewhere.    To  minimize  delays,
governments can establish property rights by brute force.  Because oil companies often have an
extremely  large  financial  interest  in  the  outcome  and  tend  to  be  the  more  powerful  parties
involved in property disputes, the final property rights allocations can heavily favor them.

A good example of government intervention to resolve oil-related property rights disputes
is its resolution of native land claims in Alaska.  Native Alaskans claimed much of the land in the
state,  including  land  critical  to  the  development  of  the  North  Slope’s  oil  fields.    When  the
property  rights  issues  raised  by  these  claims  impeded  oil  development,  the  United  States
Congress intervened, resolving the dispute with a combination of its power and taxpayer money.
This intervention cleared the way for oil development and likely reduced the cost of acquiring the
necessary land.

The  Alaska  Statehood  Act  of  1959  triggered  property  rights  disputes  between  the  state
and native Alaskans.  The Act allowed the new state to select approximately 104 million acres,
over one quarter of its total territory, to be considered state land.  Although the Act barred the
state from selecting land claimed by native Alaskans, Alaskan natives claimed 337 million acres,
approximately 90 percent of Alaska.133  Their claims included what would later become important
oil fields and much of the land along the planned Trans Alaskan Pipeline System (TAPS) route.
For  example,  the  Arctic  Slope  Native  Association  claimed  the  entire  North  Slope,  including
Prudhoe  Bay,  and  several  Athabascan  communities  had  filed  for  a  significant  portion  of  the
pipeline’s route through the Yukon Flats region.134

The  initial  land  selections  that  the  state  eventually  submitted  to  the  Department  of  the
Interior  included  areas  claimed  by  native  Alaskans.    Two  court  decisions  upheld  native  land
claims, and  the federal  government froze  land  transfers  to  the state  in  1966 until  native  claims
were settled.  This land freeze impeded development of Prudhoe Bay and construction of TAPS.
Congress  and  the  President  removed  that  obstacle  by  passing  and  signing  into  law  the  Alaska
Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971, extinguishing all previous claims in return for
the  transfer  of  money  and  44  million  acres  of  land  from  the  federal  government  to  native

133 The Statehood Act of 1959 contained a section requiring the State of Alaska and its people to disclaim
all right and title to lands held by natives or held in trust for natives by the Unites States.  See Mary Clay Berry, The
Alaska Pipeline: The Politics of Oil and Native Land Claims, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, p. 32.

134 The Arctic Slope Native Corporation held the single largest native land claim, 57 million acres.  (Berry,

p. 44)

6-7

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Alaskans.  The value of the cash component  of ANCSA  was $962.5  million (1972  dollars), of
which $500 million was earmarked from future oil royalties.135  The remainder, $462.5 million,
was to be paid over an eleven year period.

ANCSA  cleared  the  way  for  oil  development.    The  settlement  permitted  the  official
(although de facto) transfer of Prudhoe Bay to the state, and restrictions on native land selections
prevented natives from selecting known oil land.136  In addition, all but 20 of the 800 miles that
the  pipeline  crosses  today  are  controlled  by  the  federal  or  state  government.    This  settlement
officially  granted  the  federal  and  state  governments  control  over  the  North  Slope’s  oil
development, and allowed development to proceed.

Under  ANCSA,  the  federal  government  appears  to  have  used  its  power  to  underpay
claimants,  reducing  the  cost  of  land  acquisition.    ANCSA  was  a  unilateral  act  of  Congress.
Native Alaskans were involved in ANCSA’s development as one lobbying group among many,
including oil companies, miners, the state, and environmental groups.  Once Congress passed and
President  Nixon  signed  ANCSA,  the  settlement  was  final;  native  Alaskans  were  not  given  the
opportunity to vote to accept it.  At least one community with land claims along the pipeline’s
route voted to reject its land allotment, but the vote was inconsequential.  Faced with a “take it or
leave it” option, the community took what it could.  Likewise, the North Slope natives’ regional
organization voted against approving the settlement, but, again, such a vote was powerless.

The  settlement  was  distributed  among  thirteen  native  Alaskan  corporations  created  by
ANCSA.    Twelve  regional  corporations  received  land  and  money.    A  thirteenth  corporation
comprising  native  Alaskans  who  had  left  the  state  received  only  money.    One  corporation,  the
Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC), received approximately $48 million and 4.5 million
acres  of  land  in  the  North  Slope  region.    The  Arctic  Slope  Native  Association  had  previously
claimed 15 million acres in that region.  Although ANCSA allowed native corporations to select
their land, large areas of the North Slope were exempt from consideration by ASRC, including
the National Petroleum Reserve, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, and land previously selected by the
state (i.e., Prudhoe Bay).

There  is  good  reason  that  some  of  the  Alaskan  natives  rejected  the  agreement.    The
payment, less than $800 million in present value terms at the time of the agreement, was equal to
less than $3 per acre on which  claims were withdrawn.  Using the same valuation  for the land
included in the agreement, the total value of the deal (land plus money, scaled to 1995 dollars)
was approximately $2.8 billion.  This payment constitutes slightly  over  12 percent  of the more
than  $23  billion  in  oil  revenues  (1995  dollars)  that  the  State  of  Alaska  collected  through  the
initial lease sale at Prudhoe Bay and the royalties and taxes on oil during the eleven year payment

135 In effect, this meant that over half of the payment was to come from royalties on oil produced from land

(and mineral reserves) that the Alaskan natives believed they owned anyway.

136 The State of Alaska's initial land selections included Prudhoe Bay and other areas of the North Slope.
The Department of the Interior had tentatively approved the selections, but the federal government's 1966 land freeze
prevented the official approval and transfer of the selected land to the state.  The state ignored that technicality and
conducted a North Slope lease sale in 1969, prior to ANCSA, that earned $900 million, nearly as much as the entire
ANCSA settlement.

6-8

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

of ANCSA.  Once federal royalties and payments from 1983 to the present are included, the low
price paid for the settlement becomes ever more apparent.

It is clear that federal intervention accelerated the pace of oil development in Alaska, and
reduced the cost of acquiring access to Alaskan oil.  This created a windfall that flowed both to
governments (Alaska  and federal) and  to  the  oil  companies themselves, though quantifying the
size of the windfall and its distribution among the various parties would be extremely difficult.

6.5

SUBSIDIES TO EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCTION

There are important differences between existing and new production that influence how
subsidies are viewed.  The central difference is that existing oil production is a fairly perishable
commodity.  Once a well has been plugged, it rarely makes economic sense to redrill it.  Thus, if
wells  are  plugged  before  the  oil  has  been  fully  extracted,  the  oil  is  lost.    In  contrast,  new
production does not age the same way.  Reserves can sit for hundreds of years without degrading.
Owners  of  the  oil  must  determine  the  most  opportune  time  to  extract  and  exhaust  their  finite
resources.  The implications of this difference are discussed in the context of royalty reductions.

6.5.1    Subsidies to Existing Production

Subsidies  to  existing  production  fall  into  two  main  categories:  failure  to  meet  set  lease
terms  and  changes  to  existing  terms.    In  the  first  category,  we  examine  poor  royalty  auditing
practices and the use of artificially low prices for oil “sold” from one division of an oil company
to another, both of which can reduce the calculated royalties owed.  In the second category, we
discuss how reductions in royalty rates and extensions to the durations of existing leases affect
government revenues and producer incentives.

6.5.1.1 Failure to Meet Set Lease Terms

In  any  business  activity,  lapses  in  oversight  can  lead  to  losses  in  revenue  collection.
Royalty payments are no different, and poor auditing practices yield substantial financial losses
to  the  U.S.  taxpayer.    In  addition,  a  number  of  oil  companies  have  utilized  royalty-avoidance
strategies  to  minimize  their  payments  to  both  the  federal  and  state  governments  for  public  oil
resources.  Each of these areas is discussed in turn.

6-9

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

6.5.1.1.1          Poor Auditing Practices

The  Bureau  of  Land  Management  has  historically  failed  to  enforce  lease  terms
aggressively.   As a  result,  lease  holders who underpaid their royalties were rarely caught.  The
Committee  on  Natural  Resources  of  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  estimates  that  this  lax
oversight  has  cost  the  federal  government  an  estimated  $50  to  $75  million  per  year  in  lost  oil
royalties.137

6.5.1.1.2          Underpayment of Contracted Royalties

In  some  cases,  oil  producers  have  flexibility  in  how  they  structure  their  financial
reporting, which enables them to minimize their royalty payments.  The use of "posted prices,"
described  below,  is  one  such  example  that  reduced  federal  royalty  collections  by  hundreds  of
millions of dollars.

Federal royalties are calculated as a percentage of the value of the oil extracted.  When oil
is sold to independent buyers, the value of the oil is readily apparent by examining the price at
which  the  crude  oil  was  sold.    For  integrated  oil  producers,  however,  the  calculation  becomes
much  more  complex  because  the  oil  is  not  sold  on  an  open  market.    Rather,  it  is  often  “sold”
from  one  division  of  a  company  to  another.    Historically,  integrated  oil  companies  have  used
“posted” prices, which are based on corporate decisions rather than the marketplace, to determine
the value of the oil sold between divisions.

Increasing evidence gathered over the past four years suggests that major oil companies
have  used  posted  prices  that  systematically  understate  the  real  market  value  of  their  oil.    This
practice extends back to 1960, and the resulting underpayment of royalties is substantial, though
a matter of fierce disagreement.138  The Minerals Management Service estimates that the value of
royalty underpayments to the federal government from 1960 to 1992 is as much as $422 million
(interest included) for California production alone.139

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

The  Project  on  Government  Oversight,  a  non-partisan,  non-governmental  organization
which has tracked this issue for a number of years, puts the figure substantially higher:  as much
as $1.5 billion (1960 to 1997) for California production, and an additional $1.3 billion (1985 to
1997) for production east of the Rockies (including offshore production).140  Leveling the unpaid
sum plus interest  over the number of years of  underpayment  yields  an  annual  subsidy  between
$31 and $130 million.141 This estimate represents federal underpayments only.   The  same  issue
led  to  underpayment  of  state  (and  often  private)  royalties  as  well.    For  example,  the  State  of
Texas  recently  settled  a  suit  over  oil  royalties  that  required  Chevron  to  pay  $17.5  million  to
address claims of past underpayment within the state.142  We were unable to estimate the subsidy
to oil companies that has resulted from underpayment at the state level.

In response to its multi-year investigation, MMS has developed new regulations that use
the market exchange price of oil, rather than posted prices, as the basis for royalty calculations on
oil  that  is  not  sold  in  arms-length  transactions.143    MMS  estimates  that  the  new  method  will
increase  annual  royalty  collections  by  between  $50  and  $100  million.144    In  terms  of  the  past
underpayments,  MMS  has  issued  bills  totaling  only  $275  million,  all  of  which  is  being
challenged  in  court.145,146    This  sum  is  considerably  less  than  the  estimated  value  of
underpayments  for  California,  suggesting  that  substantial  royalty  underpayments  remain
outstanding.

140 As with the MMS estimates, these figures include interest.  Project on Government Oversight, Drilling

for the Truth: More Information Surfaces on Unpaid Oil Royalties, May 1997, pp. 3-4.

141 This amount is net of collections on the unpaid royalties.  Despite the large difference between the MMS
and the Project on Government Oversight estimates of unpaid amounts, even the much lower MMS  claims  are  all
being litigated by the oil companies.

communication, November 11, 1997.  The MMS figure, which applies to the California region for the period 1980 to
1995, includes imputed interest on the unpaid amounts.  Fazio did not believe that underpayments prior to 1980, or
outside of California, were substantial.  However, Cynthia Quarterman of MMS noted in an earlier trade press article
that  California  royalty  underpayments  "were  easier  to  quantify  because  the  West  Coast  is  a  distinct  market,  while
crude is moved in and out of other states more readily."  (Crow, October 28, 1996).

146  Perhaps  to  avoid  future  problems  with  royalty  underpayment,  the  oil  companies  successfully  passed  a
seven-year statute of limitations on all royalty collections.  See Tom DeRocco, "President Signs Federal Oil and Gas

Press Release, August 13, 1996.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

6.5.1.2 Changes to the Terms of the Lease Once Property is Under Production

A  second  type  of  subsidy  for  existing  production  involves  changes  to  the  terms  of  the
lease after the lease has already been issued.  Royalties may be reduced or eliminated, and lease
duration extended.  In addition,  lease  operators  may be given options to  expand  their  activities
without  having  to  bid  on  additional  properties.    Determining  whether  these  changes  constitute
subsidies or good business practice is not always easy.

Governments  often  provide  incentives  such  as  royalty  reductions  to  try  to  prevent
marginal wells from closing.  To continue producing oil, operators must maintain well bores and
well  pressures.    Changes  in  market  conditions  can  make  marginal  wells  unprofitable,  leading
operators to end production and plug the wells, often losing any remaining oil in the ground.147
Alternatively, production costs may rise as the resource is depleted.  To avoid this lost source of
royalties,  governments  offer  incentives  to  reduce  the  cost  of  extracting  oil  and  maintain  the
profitability of marginal wells.  This objective forms the basis for scores of incentives at the state
and federal level.148

The  problem  with  this  policy  is  that  royalty  reductions  are  not  always  needed  to  avoid
premature well closures.  In fact, a survey conducted by the Independent Petroleum Association
of America suggested that the biggest concern of marginal well operators was the market price
for their product.149  Changes in market prices appear to be much more important in production
decisions  than  reductions  in  royalties  or  taxes.    Because  wells  can  remain  idle  for  a  period  of
years without necessitating closure, incentives to restart production are not needed immediately
to avoid losing the resource, and governments can wait to see if prices recover.  However, many
marginal well incentives become active after the wells have been idle for only 12 months.  The
risk of prematurely activating such incentives is that oil prices may rise and the incentives may
turn out to have been unnecessary.  In such an event, governments lose the discounted portion of
normal royalties for all oil depleted while the incentives were unnecessarily in place.

Determining the appropriate time to activate incentives is quite difficult and often leads to
imperfect  and  sometimes  inaccurate  decisions  by  government  officials.    For  this  reason  we
consider these incentives as  potential  subsidies  and  describe  two  federal  examples  here.    Time
will tell whether active royalty relief policies were good business practices or not.

147  Many  small  wells  pull  oil  from  pools  that  are  not  accessible  by  surrounding  wells.    Furthermore,  the
profitability of wells generally decreases as they are depleted.  Resuming production would require re-drilling, but
the high costs of re-drilling often outweigh the benefit from producing the remaining oil.

148 See Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, State Incentives to Maximize Oil and Gas Recovery,

January 1997, for a good summary of state-by-state subsidies to both marginal and new wells.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Royalty Relief for Heavy Oil.  In 1996, the Bureau of Land Management
implemented a final rule reducing the royalty rate on heavy oil.  Heavy oil
is  less  valuable  than  lighter  grades  but  more  expensive  to  produce,  and
many  wells  were  idle  or  were  expected  to  become  idle  if  oil  prices  fell
further.    Royalty  relief  was  implemented  to  help  them  remain  viable.150
BLM’s  projections  on  the  economics  of  the  change  vary  considerably
depending on their assumptions regarding the price of oil.   However,  the
combined  effect  on  revenues  plus  other  public  sector  income  (such  as
severance taxes and corporate income  taxes)  ranges from a present  value
gain of $105 million to a present value  loss of $25  million.    The  present
value has been calculated over the producing life of properties, around 20
years.151

Royalty  Relief  for  Stripper  Wells.      Stripper  wells  are  low  volume  oil
wells  producing  less  than  15  barrels  of  oil  (on  average)  per  day.    These
wells  tend  to  have  higher  unit  production  costs,  and  to  be  adversely
affected  by  low  oil  prices.    To  encourage  continued  operation  of  these
wells (as well as renewed operation of idle stripper wells), the Bureau of
Land  Management  allowed  operators  to  obtain  a  royalty  reduction
beginning  in  the  latter  part  of  1992.    At  the  time,  BLM  projected
somewhat  reduced  federal  revenues  and  somewhat  increased  state
revenues  over  the  life  of  the  properties.    The  anticipated  net  losses  are
extremely  small,  less  than  $1  million  per  year.152    The  rule  is  currently
being reevaluated for cost and effectiveness.153

6.5.2    Subsidies to New Production through Lease Terms

While existing wells must often be used or lost, new wells do not constitute “use-or-lose”
situations.    Subsidies  to  new  production  raise  two  central  questions.    The  first  is  whether  the
subsidy  is  necessary  for  the  development  to  take  place.    This  question  is  the  same  as  we
discussed above regarding existing production.  The second question is whether it makes sense to
encourage the production of high cost oil with public money.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Governments  provide  lease  subsidies  for  two  primary  reasons:    energy  security  and
economic stability.   By encouraging  marginal  domestic  production,  the  flow  of  imports  can  be
offset somewhat, at least in the short-term; however, the incremental benefit to energy security is
not  likely  to  be  large.    In  the  longer  term,  depleting  marginal  oil  supplies  means  that  the
remaining domestic reserves will tend to be more costly to extract, reducing the future ability to
develop a domestic response if oil prices begin to rise.

The issue of economic stability is more pernicious.  As oil-producing states begin losing
oil jobs due to reserve depletion or falling world oil prices, they come under increasing pressure
to protect both jobs and government revenues.  The problem is more acute if the state’s economic
and state revenue bases are poorly diversified (as is the case with Alaska).  Because the economic
shock  of  industrial  decline  is  potentially  large,  the  government  may  introduce  economically-
inefficient policies (“give-aways”) to maintain the jobs and revenue status quo.  The shorter the
time  frame  for  response  and  economic  transition,  the  more  likely  are  decisions  that  result  in
short-term  economic  stimulus  but  long-term  environmental  damage  --  as  well  as  dubious
economic benefits.

A multi-country assessment conducted by Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner of Harvard
University  comparing  nations'  economic  reliance  on  natural  resources  and  their  long-term
economic  growth  rate  illustrates  this  point.    On  average,  a  17  percentage  point  increase  in  the
share  of  primary  resource  exports  in  gross  domestic  product  in  1971  corresponded  to  a  1
percentage point fall in average annual growth over the 1971 to 1989 period.  In contrast, many
natural resource poor countries, such as Taiwan, posted strong growth during that time frame.154

We discuss some examples of lease subsidies to new production below.

6.5.2.1 Royalty Relief for Deep Water Oil Drilling

To encourage the development of oil and gas from deeper parts of the outer continental
shelf, the federal government gave royalty relief to producers willing to drill new wells in deep
water.    The  Congressional  Budget  Office  estimated  the  economic  impacts  of  the  rule,  which
became effective in November 1995.  In the first five years, the relief was expected to increase
government revenues through higher bonus bids, as firms would be willing to pay more up-front
for drilling rights knowing they would have lower royalty obligations.  Yet, relief would reduce
government  revenues  from  royalties  by  $500  million  over  the  life  of  the  properties.    The

Roodman,  Paying  the  Piper:    Subsidies,  Politics,  and  the  Environment,  Washington,  DC:  Worldwatch  Institute,
December  1996,  p.  21.    The  Roodman  paper  has  a  number  of  examples  demonstrating  the  inefficacy  of  natural
resource subsidization as a strategy for development or economic stabilization.

estimated  present  value  loss  to  the  Treasury  (net  of  increased  bonuses)  was  $150  million.155
Using the interest rate assumptions in the CBO analysis, this translates to an average annual loss
to the Treasury of roughly $12.3 million for the 1996-2020 time period of CBO’s analysis.

There  is  substantial  evidence  that  royalty  reductions  were  not  needed  to  encourage
exploration in many deeper water locations.  New technology, such as three-dimensional imaging
and  horizontal  drilling,  have  dramatically  reduced  the  costs  of  finding  and  producing  oil.
Average exploration and production costs per barrel have decreased by about 60 percent in real
terms over the past 10 years, and exploration costs for one major oil company have fallen by 85
percent over ten years due to improvements in imaging.156

Other advances, such as computer-controlled thrusters to stabilize offshore floating rigs,
have  also  brought  costs  down  by  eliminating  the  need  for  much  larger,  more  expensive
installations.    Even  in  colder  regions,  where  icebergs  traditionally  necessitated  massive
installations,  new  options  such  as  floating  installations  that  are  tugged  out  of  the  path  of
oncoming  icebergs  dramatically  reduce  costs.    For  example,  a  floating  rig  for  Canada’s  Grand
Banks and a deep water rig for the U.S. Gulf Coast cost between 50 and 90 percent less than their
precursors.  They are also faster to design and build, reducing the market risk to the investor.157
While some deepwater reserves may still be difficult to access, either due to their location or the
decline in the market price in oil, it is clear that innovation has made drastic cost reductions in
accessing many deepwater reserves.  These cost reductions call into question the federal strategy
of reducing royalties to encourage production in many of these areas.

6.5.2.2 Other Lease Subsidies to New Production

The federal government and many states have a number of lease-based incentives in place
to spur new oil production.  We did not have enough information to quantify the revenue losses
associated with each one, but their variety demonstrates the many subsidies that can exist for new
production.158  In order to illustrate the variety of policies in place, we have included descriptions
of  some  state  programs,  though  their  inclusion  does  not  affect  our  federal  subsidy  totals.    In
addition to these types of incentives, limited public oversight of lease decisions can make lease
subsidies more likely.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Large  Block  Licenses.    Oil  companies  are  sometimes  given  rights  to
explore  large  blocks  of  land  in  return  for  a  commitment  to  invest  a  pre-
specified amount in oil exploration.  If oil is found, the license to explore
can be converted into a lease at fixed terms, without further bidding.  The
process  can  encourage  oil  exploration  in  areas  in  which  it  might  not
otherwise  occur.    However,  it  can  also  give  specific  oil  companies
valuable rights to large tracts of oil land without having to pay any bonus.

Increased Tract Size.  Governments may allow particular oil companies
to  hold  larger  than  normal  tract  sizes  in  order  to  encourage  oil
development.  Larger sizes increase the chance of finding oil, and enable a
single firm or investment group to control an entire oil prospect.  This can
encourage  more  rapid  oil  exploration  and  development,  but  may  give  a
company monopolistic or near monopolistic control in a region.

for  Increased
Development.    Governments  sometimes  allow  a  portion  of  the  costs
associated with exploring for new oil to be  offset from royalties or  taxes
owed to the government from other operating sites.  The state, in essence,
becomes a development partner.

Subsidies to new leases come not only in the form of royalty relief,  larger tracts, or the
ability to convert licenses into leases at a low cost.  Perhaps the most important subsidy comes in
the form of limited public participation in leasing decisions.  Exploration licenses in Alaska give
an  oil  company  the  exclusive  right  to  explore  up  to  500,000  acres  for  a  period  of  ten  years.
According to  local  environmental  groups,  there  is  virtually  no  opportunity  for  public  comment
and review of the licenses.159  Another Alaska program, "area-wide leasing," allows the state to
open large areas  in  certain regions  to  oil and gas  exploration.   Once  the Alaska Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) issues a “best interest finding,” which stipulates a particular lease sale
is in the best interest of the state, it can conduct lease sales in the same area for the next ten years
without any additional public  comment.160  Others in the state who feel that sales in the adjacent
areas are not in the state’s best interest have little recourse to challenge DNR’s decision.

Limited  public  participation  and  many  of  the  lease  incentives  discussed  above  provide
wide  discretion  to  public  officials  regarding  what  is  a  “marginal”  well,  what  regions  are  high
cost, and when data suggest oil reserves are valuable enough to warrant lease auctions rather than
large area licenses.  With discretion comes the opportunity for arbitrary and capricious decisions
and  corruption.    When  these  provisions  are  combined  with  reduced  public  oversight,  the
likelihood of environmentally imprudent decisions rises substantially.

6.6

COMPETITIVENESS OF LEASE AUCTIONS

The final lease-related issue we examine is the process by which lease rights are sold to
private parties.  Most federal oil leases in the United States are auctioned to the highest bidder.
The process used to award leases in many other countries is not always so transparent.  If leases
are  competitive,  auctions  should  theoretically  ensure  that  the  government  receives  full  market
value for its oil resources.  Where sales are corrupt (as sometimes occurs outside of the United
States)  or  non-competitive,  subsidies  to  the  purchasers  can  be  enormous.    To  be  truly
competitive, auctions require the following components:

•

•

•

Sufficient  Number  of  Bidders.    If  too  few  bidders  are  interested  in  a
property, those that participate will be able to offer substantially less than
the true value of the resource.  If the auction is not well publicized, or the
potential bidders do not have access to information about the tract, fewer
bidders are likely.

Independence  of  Each  Bidder.  If  bidders  are  able  to  collude,  they  can
avoid paying a fair market price for the resources being auctioned.

Bid Evaluators Not Corrupt.  Government  officials award  leases  based
on auction results.  If they are corrupt, they can accept kick-backs in return
for giving the leases at below-market value to a specific bidder.

6.6.1    Lease Competitiveness In the United States

Offshore leases have been auctioned since 1954, one year after the passage of the Outer
Continental  Shelf  Lands  Act.    The  auctions,  which  have  generally  used  a  bonus  bid  system,
appear to have been fair and competitive.  Mead et al. evaluated 1,223 offshore leases between
1954  and  1969,  and  found  that  the  rates  of  return  for  winning  bids  matched  that  in  general
industry.    They  also  found  no  evidence  that  joint  bids,  where  multiple  oil  companies  team
together to bid on a single tract, led to lower winning bids or  higher  returns.161  An analysis of
OCS leasing activity  between 1954  and 1977  by Saidi  and Marsden  also  focused on  how  joint

161 Walter Mead, Asbjorn Moseidjord, and Philip Sorenson, "The Rate of Return Earned by Lessees under

Cash Bonus Bidding for OCS Oil and Gas Leases," The Energy Journal, 1983, v. 4, pp. 37-52.

6-17

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

bids affected the price of leases.  They found that the competitiveness of the OCS lease auction
was  more  strongly  correlated  with  the  number  of  bidders  than  with  the  number  of  bids,
supporting the hypothesis that joint bidding situations did not lead to unfair auctions.162

Onshore leases are a different story.  The first federal legislation governing onshore leases
was in 1920.  While the law called for competitive leasing for oil if the tract lay within a known
producing field, less than five percent of federal leases were issued on a competitive basis prior
to 1988.163  Beginning in the 1950s, access to onshore tracts on federal lands was governed less
by market value and more by deception and sometimes intimidation.

To rectify these problems, the Bureau of Land Management introduced a lease lottery.  In
return for a filing fee, the lottery allowed any applicant to file an application for each tract of land
up for leasing.  The winner was chosen in a random drawing.  Valuable leases were then sold by
the winner on a secondary market, with little of the economic rent accruing to the government.164
Problems with the lotteries  ultimately  led to the Federal Onshore Oil  and  Gas  Leasing  Reform
Act of 1987.  The Act instituted a mixed competitive/non-competitive auctioning approach.  All
tracts would be offered competitively in an auction; those for which there was no bidding interest
would then be put into a lottery.  The goal of the approach was to ensure that the higher value
tracts were bid competitively.165

Early  analysis  of  the  reforms  suggested  that  they  dramatically  increased  returns  to  the
federal government, with bids rising from an average of $2.39 per acre in 1988, prior to reform,
to $9.96 per acre later that year, under the new auctioning system.166  While the current onshore
leasing system appears to ensure the public sector is adequately compensated for its oil, leasing
practices prior to 1988 provided substantial subsidies.

Continental Shelf Oil Lease Markets," European Journal of Operational Research, 1992, v. 58, pp. 335-343.

164 An egregious example of lost rents was the Amos Drew region of Wyoming.  In 1983, BLM leased 18
tracts non-competitively, receiving $13,000 in annual rental fees plus $1.2 million in lottery filing fees.  The tracts,
located next to lands  currently  producing  oil  and  gas,  were  then  resold  within  weeks  on  the  secondary  market  for
$100 million.  U.S. House of Representatives, 1994.

6.6.2    Competitive Access to Oil: The World Market Perspective

Despite a rocky history, it appears that leasing is currently fairly competitive at the federal
level in the United States.  Yet oil is produced in a global market.  Low cost producers in other
countries increase the pressure on the United States to make concessions for oil development in
order  to  stay  competitive.    A  process  known  as  the  “race  to  the  bottom”  is  in  effect.    Cost
pressures due in part to corruption and lax health, safety, and environmental standards in other oil
producing nations influence leasing practices in oil-reliant regions of the United States.

For example, a competitive analysis of Alaska’s position as a global oil producer included
nations such as Venezuela, Indonesia, Vietnam, Angola, and China in Alaska’s list of current or
potential competitors.167  One can hardly count on competitive leasing procedures to fairly price
oil  reserves  in  countries  such  as  these.    In  addition  to  artificially  cheap  access  to  oil  reserves,
producers  in  these  countries  may  benefit  from  government-built  or  financed  transportation
infrastructure such as pipelines.  To compete, producers such as Alaska are pressured to cut their
taxes  and  royalties  and  to  allow  oil  companies  wider  latitude  in  where  they  lease.    Given  the
social  and  environmental  costs  of  oil  development  in  these  other  countries,  the  United  States
should be careful before it tries too hard to win the oil development contest.

6.7

SUMMARY

Leasing and royalty provisions are set at both the state and federal levels and can have a
substantial impact on the timing and location of oil development.  Decisions regarding the terms
of access to limited oil resources have enormous financial  implications.   Mistakes can cost the
public hundreds of millions of dollars per year in well-run  countries  such as  the  United States.
Mistakes and corruption in countries with fewer government resources and poorer management
can cheat them out of billions of dollars per year or more.

The financial implications of a poorly run leasing program require that sound systems of
accountability be established that ensure proper public oversight of decisions.  This oversight is
especially important given the environmental impacts of oil development.  Standardized methods
for  reporting  the  financial  implications  of  changes  to  leasing  terms  should  be  developed,  as  is
done  for  tax  expenditures.    Such  methods  would  enable  policy  options  to  be  more  easily
compared, and decisions more easily publicized.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

CHAPTER 7

The U.S. government provided net subsidies of between $5.2 and $11.9 billion to the oil
sector  during  1995,  excluding  the  cost  of  defending  Persian  Gulf  oil  supplies.    We  estimate
defense  of  oil  supplies  to  be  worth  an  additional  $10.5  to  $23.3  billion,  demonstrating  the
magnitude of this specific subsidy element.  Thus, our estimate for  net federal subsidies to oil,
including defense, is $15.7 to $35.2 billion for 1995.  Because of the sensitivity of our totals to
the defense subsidy, we present our results both with and without this item.

The  large  range  between  our  high  and  low  estimates  is  indicative  of  the  uncertainty
surrounding some of the data inputs needed to estimate specific subsidies.  Factors contributing
to this range include differences between the cost of subsidies to taxpayers versus their value to
the  oil  industry,  differences  between  data  sources,  and  the  use  of  multiple  methodological
approaches to assess certain subsidies.

This chapter begins with a summary of the largest individual subsidies to  oil.   We then
summarize subsidies by the type of activity supported.  Next, we develop a number of metrics to
evaluate the subsidies in a broader market context.  Finally, we present policy recommendations
suggested by our work.

7.1

LARGEST INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIES TO OIL

Exhibit 7-1 lists the fifteen largest sources of subsidy to the oil fuel cycle at the federal
level.  As shown in the exhibit, the largest non-defense subsidies are worth between $4.5 and $11
billion, over 85 percent of our total non-defense estimates.  Including defense, the fifteen largest
subsidies are worth $15 to $34 billion, more than 95 percent of our totals.  The most significant
of  these  subsidies,  grouped  by  topic,  are  described  below.    A  complete  listing  of  subsidy
elements can be found in Appendix Exhibit A-1.

•

Defense  of  Persian  Gulf  Oil  Supplies.    Defense  of  Persian  Gulf  oil
shipments  and  infrastructure  comprises  two-thirds  of  the  total  high
estimate,  conferring  a  subsidy  of  $10.5  to  $23.3  billion  per  year.    The
range  represents  the  variation  in  analytical  approaches  used  by  defense
analysts (described in detail in Chapter 4).

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

Provision of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Stockpiling oil to protect
against  supply  disruptions  provided  between  $1.6  and  $5.4  billion  in
subsidies  to  oil  markets  in  1995  (see  Chapter  4).    The  high  estimate
includes the 1995 increment of compounded interest incurred on the many
years of unrepaid debt.

Tax  Breaks  for  Domestic  Oil  Exploration  and  Production.    Despite
reforms intended to narrow the applicability of tax breaks for oil and gas,
the  industry  continues  to  benefit  substantially  from  tax  subsidies,  as
described  in  Chapter  2.    Three  tax  breaks  benefiting  oil  exploration  and
production (the expensing of exploration and development costs, excess of
percentage over cost depletion, and accelerated depreciation of oil-related
capital)  reduced  oil  industry  tax  payments  by  between  $1.1  and  $2.3
billion during 1995.

Support for Oil-related Exports and Foreign Production.  Tax credits
for  foreign  royalties  paid,  deferrals  of  U.S.  income  taxes  due  for
multinational  oil  companies,  and  credit  subsidies  through  the  Export-
Import  Bank  and  the  Overseas  Private  Investment  Corporation,  provide
between $0.8 and $1.6 billion per year in subsidies for exports and foreign
production.  These provisions are presented in detail in Chapters 2 and 3.

Provision  and  Maintenance  of  Coastal  and  Inland  Shipping  Routes.
With  a  large  share  of  the  total  tonnage  shipped  through  the  nation’s
waterways  and  ports,  oil  benefits  disproportionately  from  subsidies  to
water infrastructure (see Chapter 3). Reforms over the past ten years have
increased  the  share  of  infrastructure  costs  borne  by  shippers;  however,
substantial  subsidies  remain.  Tax  exemptions  for  bonds  used  for  harbor
construction and spending by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Army Corps of
Engineers  continue  to  provide  subsidies  worth  $600  to  $650  million  per
year to oil.

Unfunded  and  Underfunded  Liabilities.    Inadequate  bonding  and  user
fees for the current stock of onshore and offshore oil operators shift $170
to $550 million in liability insurance premiums from oil companies to the
public each year.   These subsidies are described in Chapter 5.

Royalty Losses.  Due to creative accounting by oil producers and lapses in
auditing  practices  by  some  government  agencies,  the  federal  government
loses at least $80 and $200  million  per  year  in  royalties  (see  Chapter  6).
Adequate  data  were  not  available  to  quantify  the  full  value  of  royalty-
related subsidies.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

7.2

AGGREGATE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR OIL, BY ACTIVITY SUPPORTED

Individual subsidies can be classified by the type of activity they encourage, ranging from
support to oil exploration and development to providing regulatory oversight to the oil industry.
As shown in Exhibit 7-2, the security of oil supply is by far the largest activity supported by the
federal government.  Security concerns, which include the two largest  individual subsidies (the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve and defense of Persian Gulf oil supplies), comprise over 75 percent
of  our  estimates  if  defense  of  Persian  Gulf  oil  is  included,  and  at  least  30  percent  of  all  non-
defense subsidies.  Incentives for oil exploration and production, at over 35 percent of the total,
are  the  largest  category  of  support  for  non-defense  subsidies  in  our  low  estimate,  and  second
largest in our high.

The third largest subsidy activity is support for oil-related transportation, a category often
overlooked.    This  support  primarily  involves  maintenance  of  oil  shipping  routes  and
infrastructure, and is worth as much as $775 million per year.  It is important to remember that
this category includes only the transport of oil; subsidies to transportation systems that rely on oil
(and which therefore increase the demand for oil) are not included in our analysis.

The remaining subsidy categories each comprise between one and six percent of our total
estimates.    Though  small  on  a  percentage  basis,  the  dollar  value  of  these  categories  is  still
substantial.  For example, transfers to the public sector of liability for properly closing oil drilling
operations were worth as much as $500 million in 1995.

7.3

SUBSIDIES IN CONTEXT

In this section we evaluate our subsidy estimates in the context of the oil production and
consumption that they support.  We discuss the value of these subsidies relative to the number of
barrels of oil consumed and consumer  expenditures  for that  oil.   While  not  all  subsidies  affect
prices,  these  comparisons  offer  a  better  idea  of  the  impact  subsidies  have  on  consumption
behavior than the aggregate subsidy values alone.

We  also  discuss  the  results  of  our  subsidy  analysis  in  the  context  of  two  major  policy
initiatives within the past decade to modify oil demand patterns.  The first is the issue of carbon
taxes currently being debated.  The second policy is the Btu-tax that was proposed early in the
Clinton  administration's  first  term.    This  discussion  underscores  the  importance  of  integrating
subsidy removal into ongoing policy reform efforts.

The  subsidy  metrics  are  evaluated  using  three  scenarios,  reflecting  the  complexity
associated  with  U.S.  government  subsidies  that  partly  benefit  foreign  rather  than  domestic
petroleum:

*Many federal programs benefiting oil are partially funded by user fees levied on program beneficiaries.  The subsidy
  figures shown in this exhibit have already deducted user fees.  Detailed data on user fees and gross subsidy values
  are provided in the Appendix exhibits.  The final category in this exhibit, "Subsidy Offsets," allows for adjustments to
  account for any additional fees on oil that are not program specific, yet appropriately deducted from gross subsidies.
  No such adjustments were appropriate in 1995.  Exhibit 2-1 further explains our treatment of federal levies.

Scenario  1  evaluates  domestic  subsidies  only,  excluding  credit  subsidies
to international banks, defense of Persian Gulf oil supplies, and tax breaks
for foreign operations.

Scenario  2  allocates  a  portion  of  the  foreign  subsidies  to  the  domestic
market, reflecting the fact that some of the foreign oil supported by these
programs is imported into the United States.

Scenario 3 sets an upper bound by assuming all subsidies benefit domestic
markets.    Although  in  reality  not  all  the  oil  supported  by  internationally
oriented  programs  reaches  U.S.  markets,  foreign  tax  breaks  and  lending
programs  primarily  benefit  U.S.  corporations,  and  supply  shocks  in  the
Persian Gulf affect the price of all U.S. oil, regardless of its origin.

In  each  scenario,  we  have  adjusted  both  the  subsidy  value  and  the  denominator
(consumption, consumer spending, carbon emissions, and Btus) to best approximate the scope of
the subsidies included.  The consumption figures used for Scenario 1 are for domestic petroleum
only,  and  consumer  expenditures  exclude  the  value  of  imported  oil  prior  to  domestic  refining.
Scenarios 2 and 3 include total U.S. consumption and expenditure data.  The specific metrics are
shown in Exhibit 7-3; more detail on their derivation can be found in Appendix Exhibit A-7a.

7.3.1    Subsidies as a Percent of Oil Prices

Subsidies to domestic oil are worth between $1.20 and $2.80 per barrel of domestic crude
consumed.    This  range  is  equivalent  to  roughly  3  to  6.5  percent  of  consumer  expenditures  on
petroleum products in 1995.196  The range is slightly lower in our second scenario, although the
uncertainty  associated  with  the  values  suggests  that  the  differences  would  probably  not  be
statistically significant.

Total federal subsidies for oil are worth as much as 17 percent of 1995 retail petroleum
prices.  Were all, or even most, of the benefits of the subsidies to foreign production to flow back
to the U.S. oil sector, the impact on consumption decisions would be considerable.  Under this
scenario, the subsidy intensity of imported oil is much higher than domestic production.  Were
these subsidies eliminated, we would expect the relative competitive position of domestic versus
imported oil to improve, with some marginal oil wells again becoming economic.

196 Because our subsidy estimates are net of user fees, we have adjusted expenditure data to eliminate the

portion of prices attributable to the various fees on oil.

     (both barrels and Btus) were adjusted to exclude net imports since they do not benefit from domestic subsidies.  Consumer
      expenditure data were adjusted to exclude the value of net imports upon arrival to U.S. refineries, again because that value is not
      impacted by domestic subsidies.
2)  Subsidy value includes the pro-rated share of foreign subsidies that benefit net imports.  Foreign tax breaks and lending
     subsidies are pro-rated by U.S. net imports' share of total foreign petroleum products supplied.  Persian Gulf defense
     spending is pro-rated by the percentage of total Persian Gulf production imported by the U.S.

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

7.3.2    Subsidy Intensity in the Context of Proposed Oil Taxes

Tremendous  attention  has  focused  on  efficient  mechanisms  to  reduce  the  impact  of
climate  change.    Taxes  on  carbon  are  an  oft-suggested  tool  to  “get  the  prices  right”  (i.e.,  to
internalize  environmental  externalities)  in  energy  markets.    A  number  of  economists  have
estimated  economically  efficient  carbon  tax  levels  that  would  begin  the  transition  to  lower-
carbon fuels.  Their results suggest median values of between $9 and $14 per ton.197

Our  three  subsidy  scenarios  suggest  that  federal  oil  subsidies  are  worth  $7.50  to  nearly
$60 per ton of carbon emitted from U.S. petroleum consumption.  While subsidy removal should
not be substituted for a carbon tax, since the latter is aimed specifically at mitigating externalities
associated  with  fossil  fuels,  the  comparison  is  instructive.    The  relative  size  of  the  values
suggests that even without the political will to implement a carbon tax, phasing out oil subsidies
could help to improve the price signals that now exist within oil markets.  In addition, the fact
that  the  subsidy  intensity  actually  exceeds  these  carbon  tax  values  underscores  the  market
distortions  that  would  remain  if  carbon  taxes  were  implemented  without  concurrent  subsidy
reform.

A comparison to proposed taxes on Btus (British thermal units) illustrates a similar point.
Btus measure the heat content of a fuel.  During 1992 and 1993 the U.S. Congress  proposed a
Btu-based tax on energy.  In addition to raising revenues, proponents argued that the tax would
ensure that energy prices reflected the environmental impacts associated with the production and
consumption  of  particular  fuels.    The  proposed  tax  rate  set  for  oil  was  $0.31  per  million  Btu
(scaled to 1995 dollars).  In comparison, oil subsidies for 1995 ranged from 50 to 325 percent of
the proposed tax value, depending on the scenario.  Had the tax been implemented, much of the
hoped for benefit in terms of price signals would merely have offset distortions already in place
from federal subsidies to oil.  Environmental externalities would still not have been reflected in
oil prices.

7.3.3    Summary of Subsidy Intensity

The evaluation of subsidies in the context of the oil market demonstrates that subsidies to
oil  are  important  and  probably  impact  oil  consumption  decisions.  Eliminating  subsidies
throughout  the  fuel  cycle  will  help  clarify  price  signals  throughout  the  production  chain,

197 The tax values calculated are set at a rate such that the marginal cost of carbon-emitting activities reflects
the  (estimated)  damage  these  activities  cause  the  environment.    We  chose  a  median  carbon  tax  estimate  over  an
average because the source of our data contained an outlier, $142.50 per metric ton of carbon (1995 dollars), that
exceeded all of the other estimates by more than a factor of six.  Data on the optimal tax rate on carbon are from five
studies (Nordhaus, Cline, Peck and Tiesberg, Fankauser, and Maddison) summarized in the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, Climate Change 1995: Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change, Contribution of
Working Group III to the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC, Cambridge University Press, 1996, Table 6.1, p.
215.

improving  economic  efficiency.    In  conjunction  with  externality-based  taxes,  the  price  of  oil
would begin to provide suppliers, consumers, and governments much more accurate information
with which to adjust their economic decision making.

7.4

RECOMMENDATIONS

The impacts of oil  subsidies merit greater  attention  as  the  world  tries  to  shape  a  global
climate  change  strategy  and  address  the  many  competing  needs  for  scarce  government  funds.
While  it  has  long  been  recognized  that  oil  prices  do  not  reflect  the  environmental  costs  of
petroleum  consumption,  our  analysis  shows  that  prices  do  not  even  reflect  the  direct  costs  of
petroleum  production.    At  a  time  of  tight  fiscal  constraints  and  cuts  to  social  programs,  the
government should not spend billions of dollars every year to subsidize oil and the environmental
problems that result from its consumption.

The costs of supplying oil should fall on the user, not on the general taxpayer.  Continued
subsidization  of  oil  makes  little  sense.    Subsidies  to  the  oil  fuel  cycle  distort  oil  exploration,
production  and  consumption  decisions;  reduce  the  incentive  to  develop  substitutes;  intensify
environmental degradation; and cost taxpayers billions of dollars per year.  Our analysis suggests
that  subsidy  reform  can  be  a  positive  force  in  achieving  environmental  improvements  and
substantial  fiscal  savings,  while  also  eliminating  the  price  distortions  that  hinder  economic
efficiency.   Furthermore,  our  analysis  suggests  that  the  magnitude  of  subsidies  is  large  enough
that they can impede the efficacy of other policy reform efforts (such as carbon taxes) if ignored.

The  historically  low  oil  prices  now  in  effect  provide  a  tremendous  opportunity  for
governments  to  phase  out  their  oil  subsidies  with  minimal  inflationary  risks.    To  help  this
process, efforts to characterize, report, and remove oil subsidies need to be intensified.  Based on
our  analysis,  we  make  the  following  recommendations  for  structural  change.    To  reduce  the
economic dislocations, many of these reforms should be phased in over time.

1)  Decouple  oil  subsidies  from  rural  economic  development.    Many  subsidies  to  oil
exploration and production are justified on the grounds that they provide jobs and livelihoods
for  isolated  rural  populations.    Data  suggest  that  development  policies  focused  on  natural
in
resource  extraction  have  rarely  been  successful.
telecommunications  and  computer  technology  provide  an  increasing  range  of  development
options for geographically-isolated  communities.   By decoupling oil development  and  jobs,
governments  can  stop  subsidizing  environmental  degradation  and  work  to  create  cleaner,
higher value job opportunities for rural populations.

  In  addition,  rapid  advances

2)  Internalize  oil-related  defense  costs  into  market  prices.    Where  governments  choose  to
intervene  in  oil  markets  to  ensure  the  security  of  supplies,  the  costs  of  this  intervention
should be recovered through a user fee on oil consumers. Given the magnitude of these costs,
excluding  them  from  the  price  of  oil  creates  significant  and  undesirable  distortions  in
consumption behavior.

7-9

Fueling Global Warming:  Federal Subsidies to Oil in the United States

3)  Treat  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve  like  a  formal  government  enterprise.    SPR  costs
taxpayers  billions  of  dollars  per  year  in  direct  costs  and  foregone  interest.    The  Reserve
should be treated as a government enterprise, financed through taxes on oil consumption and
formally held responsible for repayment of invested capital plus interest.

4)  Include  subsidy  reform  as  an  integral  element  in  strategies  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of
climate  change.    Taxing  emissions  makes  little  sense  if  governments  simultaneously
continue to subsidize fossil fuels.  Subsidy identification, reporting, and removal should be an
integral part of climate change mitigation programs.

5)  Improve the transparency of oil leases on public lands so terms can be easily compared.
Subsidized lease terms can provide large benefits to oil producers at the taxpayers' expense,
and  the  resulting  acceleration  in  oil  development  creates  or  aggravates  environmental
problems.  Leasing of public oil reserves should be done in a transparent manner at both the
federal  and  state  levels.    Environmental  groups  should  work  with  the  relevant  government
agencies to develop a standard disclosure form to be completed for each sale.  Modification
of  lease  terms  should  also  be  reported  in  a  standardized,  publicly  available  format.    This
disclosure  form  will  ensure  that  lease-related  subsidies  are  visible  and  that  lease  terms  are
comparable  across  sales.    Given  the  international  nature  of  oil  markets,  the  goal  of  this
disclosure system should be to allow international comparisons of lease terms.
