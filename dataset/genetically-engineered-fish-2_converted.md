summary

This briefing examines the development of genetically engineered (GE)
fish, which could soon be produced on a commercial scale.

There are many GE fish under development, often engineered with growth
hormones to make the GE fish grow faster enabling them to reach
marketable size at an earlier age.

* There are numerous concerns over the welfare and environmental impact

of these unhealthy, fast growing fish.

* The techniques of producing GE fish are crude, and generally involve the
random insertion of DNA into the fish genome. This process may disrupt
the tightly controlled network of DNA in the fish.

Current understanding of the way in which genes are regulated is
extremely limited, and any change to the DNA of an organism at any point
may well have effects that are impossible to predict or control.

There is already concern regarding environmental effects, human health
impacts and welfare of intensive fish farming in aquaculture. Fish are
known to escape frequently from aquaculture facilities, which can then
interbreed with, or displace, native fish populations. There is a high
potential for ecological disruption should GE fish escape from aquaculture
facilities. Fast growing GE fish could compete for food, disrupting aquatic
food webs and ecosystems.

* Researchers have shown that GE fish with a growth hormone gene could
have a mating advantage due to their increased size. An experimental
study was developed (called the ‘Trojan gene’ model), which
demonstrated that the release of just 60 GE fish could lead to an
extinction of a wild population within only 40 generations.

* Contrary to industry claims, sterilisation of GE fish will not be 100 %

effective in a commercial situation, and will not prevent all
crossbreeding between GE fish and wild fish.

There is widespread opposition to the farming of GE fish in aquaculture
facilities, the most economically profitable method of rearing farmed fish.
Several governments and intergovernmental organisations have already
taken steps to ensure that any GE fish (e.g. for scientific research
purposes) are kept in secure, land-based facilities.

However, escaped GE fish will not respect national boundaries, GE fish
must be considered as global releases by the multilateral environmental
agreement, the UN Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.

* In a commercial aquaculture situation, the physical containment of

these fish can never be guaranteed. Escapes of GE fish into the aquatic
environment could have devastating effects on wild fish populations and
biodiversity.

Therefore, Greenpeace demands that the genetic engineering of fish
for commercial purposes should be prohibited.

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FISH
– NEW THREATS TO THE ENVIRONMENT

INTRODUCTION

Some GE fish are used in laboratory research
(e.g. for the study of gene regulation and
function) and some have been developed as
‘drug factories’, their bodies engineered to
contain products that are useful to the
pharmaceutical industry. However, much of
the research into GE fish has focused on the
development of traits such as rapid growth
that are valued by companies involved in
intensive fish farming.

introduction

Greenpeace first published a report in 2000 on
the hazards of genetically engineered fish.1 This
report is an update, presenting the new
scientific findings on threats to the environment
of genetically engineered fish.

The first genetically engineered (GE), also
called genetically modified (GM) or transgenic,
fish was reported in China in 1985. Since then,
experiments have been conducted with over 35
different kinds of GE fish in about 50
laboratories around the world.2 Most of the fish
being engineered are varieties important to the
aquaculture industry, such as salmon, carp,
trout, catfish, and tilapia. Genes introduced into
GE fish have come from a wide range of
sources, including other fish, chickens, humans,
cattle and rats.

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FISH
– NEW THREATS TO THE ENVIRONMENT

I GENETIC ENGINEERING OF FISH – CRUDE SCIENCE

An example of unexpected effects in GE fish:

There are several ways of producing GE fish, all of which are crude and
can lead to unexpected and unintended effects. One way to make GE fish
is by genetically altering the sperm of male fish. There are a number of
methods to do this, including:

* Attaching the new genes to viruses which then ‘smuggle’ these genes into

the sperm,

* Using an electric shock to create pores in the sperms’ cell membrane,

and then introducing the genes into the sperm.6

However, by far the most commonly employed method used to engineer
fish is by microinjection,7 where:

* Scientists make billions of copies of the DNA that they want to end up
in the GE fish by inserting the genes into a piece of DNA called a
plasmid that can be reproduced inside bacteria in the laboratory.

* The genes are then isolated and millions of copies are injected with a
very fine needle into fertilised fish eggs as soon as possible after
fertilisation (usually at the one or two cell stage). A piece of DNA
called a ‘promoter’ is also inserted along with the ‘new’ gene in order to
‘switch it on’ in its new host. Promoters, that often force genes to
express their traits at very high levels, also have the potential to
influence other genes in the organism.8

* Some of these eggs will have successfully incorporated the new genes,
and some of the fish that hatch will therefore be GE. As it is not
possible to insert a new gene with any accuracy, the gene transfer may
also disrupt the tightly controlled network of DNA in the fish. Current
understanding of the way in which genes are regulated is extremely
limited, and any change to the DNA of an organism at any point may
well have effects that are impossible to predict or control. The new gene
could, for example, alter chemical reactions within the cell or disturb
cell functions. This could lead to changes in behaviour, instability, and
the creation of novel substances in the fish such as new toxins or
allergens or changes in nutritional value.9

When GE coho salmon were compared to a control group of non-GE coho
salmon, it was found that the genetic engineering process had affected the
activity of a number of non-target genes in the GE fish. These changes
included an increased amount of the protein parvalbumin-b in the GE
salmon, a protein that has been identified as a major food allergen in fish.11

For further examples of unexpected effects in GE fish, see Section iv ii
“Unexpected effects and Trojan genes”.

II FAST GROWING, UNHEALTHY GE FISH

Most aquaculture-related research on GE fish has focused on increasing
the growth rates of farmed fish so that they reach marketable size more
quickly.12 Growth hormone genes taken from humans, other mammals or
fish have been engineered into at least 15 species of fish.13

* In one experiment, Atlantic salmon were engineered with growth

hormones to enable them to reach adult size more quickly. After one
year, most had a two- to six-fold increase in growth, whilst the largest
was 13 times normal size for its age.14

* A company called Aqua Bounty Farms (a division of A/F Protein) is

currently seeking approval in the United States to commercialise a GE
Atlantic salmon. This salmon has been engineered with an extra gene for
growth hormone production taken from a chinook salmon and a
‘promoter’ gene which forces the salmon to produce high levels of the
growth hormone all year round. This means that instead of only growing
during the spring and summer months, the GE salmon grows constantly,
reaching adult size in about 18 months. This compares to 24-30 months
for a non-GE salmon.15

* One study noted that when growth hormone is engineered into salmon,
“the endocrine stimulation can be elevated to pathological levels in
some cases”, such as abnormally enlarged skulls in the GE fish, leading
to difficulty in respiration and feeding.16 Other studies have reported
that GE carp have suffered from similar abnormalities.17

In summary, forced expression of the growth hormone in GE fish
raises a number of animal welfare concerns.

III CURRENT PROBLEMS WITH AQUACULTURE

GE fish are to be introduced within the context of intensive fish farming. In
order to begin to understand the hazards and risks posed by GE fish, it is
first necessary to examine the many problems that already exist within
current aquaculture systems.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
global demand for seafood may double by 2040.18 With wild fisheries
suffering major declines due to over-fishing and habitat destruction, it is
widely suggested that the projected shortfalls in fish supply will be met by
expansion within the aquaculture sector.19

Since 1987, global aquaculture production has more than doubled. By
1995, it accounted for 18.5% of the total world seafood supply.20 More
than 160 species of finfish and shellfish are currently farmed, including
catfish, trout, salmon, tilapia, oysters, crayfish, clams and shrimp.21

Aquaculture has a long history – fish farming has been integrated into
diverse sustainable farming practices in Asia for at least 2000 years.
Modern intensive aquaculture operations, however, are often grossly
inefficient, damaging to the environment and raise many welfare concerns.

One of the first kinds of GE fish expected to reach commercial approval is
salmon.

In salmon farming:

* Farmed salmon are fed synthetic pigments in order to give their flesh

the pink colour normally associated with salmon. Without this pigment,
the flesh of these salmon would be an unhealthy looking pale grey.24

* Farmed salmon accumulate cancer-causing chemicals in their bodies

called polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs) from the fishmeal they are fed.
On average, farmed salmon have 16 times the PCBs found in wild
salmon. PCBs not only cause cancer but also present other health risks
as well. These include neurodevelopmental risks to unborn children from
maternal consumption of PCB-contaminated fish.25

It is often suggested that fish farming will compensate for the collapse of
wild fisheries and is a means to provide more animal protein to hungry
people. Most intensive fish farming operations are, however, extremely
inefficient and require more protein in the form of fishmeal to feed the
farmed fish than is supplied by the end harvest. The fishmeal is commonly
made with wild-caught fish such as anchovy, jack mackerel, pilchard,
capelin, menhaden, herring, and sardines.

* It can take three to five pounds of fishmeal to produce a single pound of

farmed salmon.26

In summary, modern intensive aquaculture operations are often grossly
inefficient, damaging to the environment, and raise animal welfare concerns.

* The fish are kept in net pens, which are tethered in coastal waters. The

fish are so densely stocked that ideal conditions are created for disease.
These diseases race rapidly through the crowded fish pens, and in order
for the salmon to survive they are fed antibiotics, and dosed with
pesticides. The pesticides, uneaten feed and wastes from the fish
smother and pollute the sea floor beneath the fish farms, affecting
bottom dwelling organisms.22

* The salmon often incubate sea lice and other parasites, which then

spread to wild salmon populations. In Norway, parasites from fish farms
were so devastating to wild fish that the government made the decision
to poison all aquatic life in dozens of rivers and streams in the hope
that disease-free populations could then be restored.23

i fish escape from fish farms

In commercial aquaculture, fish are farmed in pens in contact with aquatic
systems for practical and economic reasons. However, fish frequently escape
in large numbers from fish farms. These escapes can occur due to human
accidents, harsh weather conditions or because of predators such as seals
tearing holes in the net pens and cages the fish are kept in.

* In 1988, a storm tore apart the moorings and nets of hundreds of sea
pens along the Norwegian coast, allowing a million farmed salmon to
escape.27 Between 1992-1996, losses of salmon from fish farms in
Norway averaged 1.3 million a year.28 As a result of incidents such as
these, in some parts of the country escaped fish that have bred and
formed their own populations outnumber wild ones by five to one.29

* Between 1994 and 1996, at least 120,000 salmon escaped from fish
farms in British Columbia. About 20,000 of them escaped from a
tanker truck spill on Vancouver Island.30

* From 1996 to 2000, almost 600,000 Atlantic salmon escaped from the
net pens in Washington State waters.There is evidence that Atlantic
salmon that have escaped from Washington or British Columbia fish farms
are beginning to establish a breeding population off Vancouver Island.31

* During 1999, 255,000 salmon escaped from Scottish fish farms.32

* A storm in December 2000 caused steel cages containing salmon to buckle in

Machias Bay in the US state of Maine, leading to the escape of 100,000 fish.33

* In the Magaguadavic River in New Brunswick, Canada, the number of

farmed fish entering the river between 1992 and 1999 was two to eight
times that of the wild salmon returning to the same river to spawn.34

Farmed salmon are genetically very uniform, bred to the needs of the
industry with traits such as rapid growth or high tolerance to the crowded
conditions in the fish farms. Wild salmon populations, on the other hand,
are genetically diverse and “highly adapted to the specific conditions of
the local river systems to which they return to spawn”.35

Interbreeding between wild salmon and those that escape from farms
alters the genetic makeup of the wild salmon populations.

* There is evidence that escaped Atlantic salmon are beginning to establish a
breeding population in the Pacific, off Vancouver Island in Canada.There is
much concern that these Atlantic salmon may compete for food and
habitat with the fragile populations of Pacific salmon, many of which have
already been listed under the Endangered Species Act.36 The Washington
State Hearings Board in the northwestern US has ruled that Atlantic
salmon that escape from fish farms should be classified as a “pollutant”.37

* In Maine, on the Atlantic coast of the US, Atlantic salmon have been

listed under the Endangered Species Act. It is estimated that only 500
Atlantic salmon with a truly native genetic makeup remain in the wild.
Escapes of farmed salmon pose a major threat to the recovery of these
genetically distinct wild salmon.38

In summary, fish regularly escape from commercial aquaculture
facilities and can threaten native fish populations.

IV POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF GE FISH

“For more than half a century theoretical biologists have been developing
ideas about biological networks and hierarchies and applying them to our
knowledge of molecular genetics. The task of assessing the environmental
impact of a genetically engineered organism is to understand what effect,
no matter how small, the genetic modification has had on every one of the
characteristics relevant to the organism's interactions with members of
other species (as well as the physical environment); and then to predict all
of the resultant effects that may occur in the organism's ecological
network. With our current, very sketchy knowledge of how complex
networks behave, it is impossible to carry out this task in a satisfactory way.
Our understanding of ecological networks and their evolution is insufficient
for any meaningful assessment of the impacts of artificial genetic change
accomplished by genetic engineering.” Dr. Peter Wills, theoretical biologist.39

When examining the potential ecological consequences of the release of a GE
fish, it is important to keep in mind that the complexity and dynamic behaviour
of biological systems means that there are fundamental limitations inherent in
any risk assessment.40 It is possible to make an evaluation of the behaviour of a
GE fish based on any new traits it may have (e.g. engineered cold tolerance
increasing the geographic range of GE fish, leading to possible invasion of any
escaped fish into new ecosystems). However, experience shows us that the most
devastating ecological consequences can often be completely unexpected.

For example:

* The intentional introduction of the myxoma virus (causing myxomatosis) to
control rabbit populations in England is one such example. As desired by
those introducing it, the myxoma virus caused a dramatic decline in rabbit
populations. However, it also led to a surge in the abundance of a
particular species of grass on which the rabbits previously grazed. Another
previously dominant species of grass was unable to compete and declined
substantially, giving rise to a shortage of nesting material for a certain
variety of ant.This, in turn, triggered the extinction of the already
endangered Large Blue butterfly (Maculina arion) due to a symbiotic
relationship between the ant and the butterfly.41

In summary, ecological networks are complex and poorly understood.
Therefore, the ecological impact of any escapes of GE fish cannot be
fully taken into account by risk assessment; the precautionary
principle must be applied.42

i impacts on native fish populations

COLD TOLERANCE – AN INVASIVE TRAIT?

Escaped GE fish will probably be able to travel over considerable distances
and may have novel traits that have never previously existed within a
particular ecosystem. Characteristics such as increased rates of growth,
cold tolerance or faster breeding cycles could give GE fish a competitive
advantage over native fish and potentially lead to the displacement of
native fish populations. In many cases, they may disrupt ecological systems
in some or all of the same ways as non-native species that have been
introduced into new habitats.43

* In 1954, the British colonial administration in Uganda first introduced Nile
perch into Lake Victoria, with the intention to increase fish production.
Within 30 years the carnivorous perch, which can grow up to 6 feet in
length, had decimated the indigenous fish populations, leading to the
extinction of 50% of the over 400 different species of small fish in the
lake. With the loss of so many species of algae-eating fish, the waters of
Lake Victoria are now frequently choked with algal blooms and oxygen
levels are seriously depleted. Several species of insect, which were once
kept under control by fish now gone from the lake, breed in unprecedented
numbers. Also, unlike the native fish, the Nile perch do not dry well in the
sun, and the wood fires needed to dry the Nile perch have increased the
rate of deforestation and consequent erosion of the lake’s shoreline.44

* Forty-four native species of fish in the United States are currently

threatened or endangered by non-indigenous fish.These introduced fish
have had far reaching impacts on the ecology of aquatic ecosystems and
have competed with native fish for food, shelter, mates, habitat and
breeding sites.45 In Florida, for example, blue tilapia escaped from two
aquaculture facilities and have since become established in Everglades
National Park and other waterways. In a number of streams where these
fish have become abundant, almost all vegetation and native fish species
have disappeared.46

* The European zebra mussel has spread into most freshwater habitats in the
eastern United States, having arrived in the Great Lakes via ballast water
released from ships that travelled from Europe. Zebra mussels compete
directly with native mussels, clams, and snails, and reduce food and oxygen
for native fauna.47 The invasive mussels also clog water intake pipes and
water filtration and electric generating plants, with an estimated US$3
billion a year spent on control and cleaning measures.48

In 1982, a scientist at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada
accidentally froze a tank filled with a species of arctic fish called a flounder.
When the tank was thawed out it was found that the fish were still alive.This
led to the discovery of a gene in the flounder that produces an ‘antifreeze’
protein, enabling it to tolerate freezing waters.49 Since then, biotech
researchers have been engineering salmon with this flounder gene in an
attempt to incorporate the antifreeze protein into the GE fish, in the hope
that salmon farms could operate in waters that would normally be excluded
because of subzero water conditions. Although researchers have managed to
engineer the salmon with the antifreeze gene with some success, the
antifreeze protein in the GE salmon is currently being expressed at levels that
are too low to make it commercially useful for this purpose. However it is
expected that the use of more powerful ‘promoter’ genes, taken from insects,
may increase the amounts of antifreeze protein in the salmon. Increased
tolerance to cold water could increase the geographic range of GE fish,
leading to possible invasion of any escaped fish into new ecosystems.

In summary, escaped GE fish could disrupt natural fish populations in a
similar fashion to other escaped non-native fish. However, because of
their novel characteristics, they could pose additional problems as
described by the “Trojan gene effect” below.

ii unexpected effects and trojan genes

“Unfortunately, for an exotic organism it is almost impossible to
determine either the risk of species spread or hazard to the
environment before introduction because of the nearly infinite
number of direct and indirect biotic interactions that occur in
nature.” William Muir & Richard Howard, authors of the Trojan Gene
Hypothesis50

Genes are engineered into fish because the genetic engineers want to
confer the GE fish with a particular trait, such as rapid growth. However,
due to inherent problems in the genetic engineering process, GE fish often
also exhibit a range of unanticipated characteristics.51

GE FISH REPORT |  9

fish

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FISH
– NEW THREATS TO THE ENVIRONMENT

* With salmon GE with growth hormones, for example, growth hormone
genes in the GE fish have also influenced swimming ability,52 feeding
rates,53 muscle structure and enzyme production,54 disease resistance,55
body morphometry,56 pituitary gland structure,57 life span,58 larval
developmental rate,59 smoltification,60 risk-avoidance behaviour,61 cranial
morphology and gill irrigation.62

“What surprised us was how fast a GMO mating advantage could
cause a transgene to spread in a population,” said Richard Howard,
another of the Purdue researchers. “A population invaded by a few
genetically modified individuals would become more and more
transgenic, and as it did the population would get smaller and
smaller. We call this the ‘Trojan gene effect’.”

These unanticipated consequences of the genetic engineering process, which
are also in many cases undesired effects, add to the difficulties of assessing
the ecological hazards associated with a GE fish. For example, although fish
genetically engineered with a growth hormone may have characteristics such
as increased size which increase their ability to compete with their wild
counterparts, the genetic engineering process often leaves them with some
kind of disadvantage, such as increased mortality in their offspring.63

Some scientists have argued that disadvantages, such as increased mortality
in the offspring of GE fish, mean that there is little risk that GE fish will
prove to be invasive or in other ways hazardous to the environment.64
Researchers at Purdue University in the US, however, found that interactions
between traits that would appear to offer a disadvantage and other traits in
GE fish that appear to offer some kind of competitive advantage, could
actually increase the hazard of GE fish to aquatic ecosystems.

The Purdue laboratory studies used GE and non-GE Japanese medaka fish
as experimental models to study the potential effects of the release of a
small number of GE fish into the wild. The GE fish were engineered with a
human growth hormone gene and had a competitive advantage — the
males were larger, making them more attractive to female mates. But the
genetic engineering process had also given the GE fish a disadvantage —
their offspring were less likely to survive.65 These data were then fed into
computer models, which came up with startling results. The first study
found that the release of just sixty of these GE fish into a wild
population of sixty thousand led to the extinction of both fish
populations in just 40 generations.66

“You have the very strange situation where the least fit individual in
the population is getting all the matings—this is the reverse of
Darwin’s model,” says William Muir, one of the researchers. “The sexual
selection drives the gene into the population and the reduced
viability drives the population to extinction.”67

“Imagine a pie, and you eat 30 percent of it every day,” said Howard.
“Half of it is gone in two days, and within a week less than one-tenth
of it remains. It is conceivable that a similar effect could occur among
fish populations if GMOs with ‘Trojan genes’ escape into the wild.”68

Further research on the “Trojan gene” effect has now been published in
scientific journals.69 Together, this research shows that there are
numerous ways in which genes engineered into GE fish could invade
wild fish populations, reduce their fitness, and potentially cause their
extinction.

One of the ways in which an escaped GE fish could impact on other fish
within an ecosystem, and end up being invasive, is through competition for
food. One study found that genetically engineered salmon with a growth
hormone gene consumed 250 % more food than non-GE salmon of the
same size, suggesting that they could be highly competitive. GE predatory
fish such as salmon, trout, or tilapia may also prey on other fish at
unusual times during the season, as many GE fish mature at an earlier age
than their non-GE counterparts. Altered feeding patterns such as these
could result in major disruptions to aquatic ecosystems.70

When researchers placed non-GE coho salmon and coho salmon GE with
a growth hormone gene together, they found that when food supplies were
low, the genetically engineered salmon dominated the acquisition of food
resources, consistently outgrew the non-GE salmon and affected their
growth. Dominant GE individuals emerged which then became
cannibalistic towards the other fish, including other GE salmon that were
weaker than them. When there was low availability of food, all the groups
containing genetically engineered salmon also then experienced population
crashes or complete extinctions, whereas groups containing only non-GE
salmon had good survival and growth rates.71

iii Sterilisation will not be 100 % effective

“One of the most significant issues raised by environmentalists is
the potential for negative effects on wild stock posed by “gene
flow” [from GE fish]. Use of sterile fish will eliminate this issue.”
Elliot Entis, President of Aqua Bounty Farms72

Companies currently seeking commercial approval to market GE fish are
claiming that sterilisation of these fish can protect the environment from
the hazards associated with the escape of GE fish from fish farms. They
claim that the methods used can be 100 % effective.73 However, other
evidence indicates that this cannot be achieved under commercial
conditions.

A number of different methods can be used to sterilise fish, but there is
one principal technique being proposed for GE fish, called ‘triploidy.’ With
this method, temperature or pressure shock is applied to fish eggs shortly
after fertilisation. This produces eggs that contain three chromosomes
(triploids) instead of the normal two and fish grown from these eggs
usually do not develop normal sexual characteristics.74

Although most of the fish produced by triploidy will be sterile, it is widely
acknowledged that a small percentage of triploid fish will develop sexual
characteristics and be fertile.75

* A study of GE tilapia fish that were triploids, for example, found that some

of the male fish had sperm in their testes, ‘indicative of reproductive
functionality’.76 One of the reasons that low fertility in male fish is of
concern was highlighted in publications by Muir and Howard, authors of
the Trojan Gene Hypothesis. Among their scenarios where escaped GE fish
could lead to extinction of both GE and native fish populations,77 was one
where GE male fish have lowered fertility,78 while at the same time being
more viable (through a trait such as increased disease resistance).79 The
researchers concluded that “attempts to reduce GE male fertility that
do not result in complete male sterility may increase the hazard
rather than reduce it”.80

Aqua Bounty Farms, the company currently seeking commercial approval for
its GE salmon, say that the company will ensure that all the triploid eggs will
be female and that every batch of eggs will be thoroughly screened.81 While it
is possible to achieve close to 100% sterilisation of eggs through careful

screening, many people in the industry (including from companies developing
the GE fish) are doubtful that this kind of screening would be economical
under conditions of commercial production.82

When GE crops were commercialised, the biotech industry demanded
‘tolerance’ levels to legalise genetic contamination of other crops with pollen
from GE plants, having denied for years that such contamination would ever
occur. Since the widespread commercialisation of these crops in the 1990’s,
there have been numerous instances of contamination from GE crops.83 It is
extremely likely, therefore, that faced with economic considerations under
commercial production, the companies developing GE fish will demand
acceptance of less than 100 % success rates in the sterilisation of GE fish.84

Even without GE fish reproducing, escapes of sterile GE fish could still have a
major impact on wild fish populations.This could occur through the spreading
of diseases or through competition with wild fish for resources, such as food
or habitat.85 Damage to wild fish populations could also occur if sterile GE
fish compete with wild fish for mates.86 This fruitless mating could depress
populations of already endangered species of fish.87

There are other major problems associated with triploid fish, which raise
questions as to whether the technique will be suitable for commercial
aquaculture operations, as well as major animal welfare concerns.

* Triploid Atlantic salmon exhibit greater variability in growth,88 diminished
tolerance of chronic stress,89 reduced survival during egg incubation and,
during marine grow-out,90 a number of abnormalities including spinal
abnormalities,91 abnormalities of the lower jaw,92 and greater susceptibility
to cataract formation.93 Triploid fish have also been found to suffer from
breathing difficulties, low blood haemoglobin levels and higher rates of
mortality.94

In summary, sterilisation is unlikely to be 100 % effective in a
commercial situation. In addition, there are welfare concerns
regarding triploid fish.

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FISH
– NEW THREATS TO THE ENVIRONMENT

V NO! TO THE COMMERCIALISATION OF GE FISH

GE fish could be the first GE animals to receive any government approval for
sale as food.95 No official approval has yet been granted for the sale of GE fish
for human consumption, but there are at least three countries where approval
could be in the pipeline.

* In the United States, commercial approval is currently being sought for GE
salmon and catfish.The company developing the GE salmon, Aqua Bounty
Farms, says that it has pre-orders for 15 million eggs and it had hoped to
receive commercial approval by 2002.There has been intense controversy
over GE fish in recent years, however, and the company now says that it
does not expect its application to be approved until late 2004 at the
earliest.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided to regulate
the salmon, GE with a gene for a growth hormone, as a new ‘animal drug’.
The FDA has been widely criticised as lacking both the legal authority and
ecological expertise to regulate GE fish.96

* Researchers at the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in
Cuba are seeking government approval for GE tilapia. Mario Estrada,
leader of the project, says that feeding studies have been conducted,
including an experiment in which the tilapia were eaten by human
volunteers.The researchers expect that it will be 2005 before they hear
whether or nor approval will be granted.97

* In China, GE carp is currently being tested for possible commercial

production.98 However, concerns about their impact on the environment
mean that commercialisation is unlikely in the near future.99

Although regulatory bodies in the US or elsewhere may soon decide to give
commercial approval for a GE fish, it is not possible to say if these GE fish
will be safe to eat.The process of genetic engineering itself typically results in
unexpected and unintended changes in the organism that is being genetically
engineered. In the case of a GE fish, this could include the modification of an
existing fish protein, or the creation of a new protein that could cause allergic
reactions.100 Such modifications could go unnoticed by government regulators
who often depend on the very companies who stand to profit from
commercial approval of a GE organism to do the safety assessment. In most
cases, government regulators require companies to assess the safety of GE
organisms by examining a narrow range of known characteristics, while

failing to require any thorough analysis of the hazards posed by unexpected
new molecules that could be harmful.101

GLOFISH – A GE PET

For just US$5, you too could be the proud owner of the world’s first GE
household pet. On sale since January 2004 in pet stores across the United
States, the GE fish called GloFish, are being marketed by a Texas biotech
firm called Yorktown Technologies. Originally developed from zebra fish by
researchers at the University of Singapore, GloFish engineered with a
fluorescing gene taken from a jellyfish glow green, while those engineered
with genes taken from Discosoma (a relative of sea anemones and coral)
have a reddish hue when exposed to black or fluorescent light.

While this GloFish might sound cute to some aquarium owners, the attempt
to win acceptance for this GE pet is really the thin end of a much more
ambitious wedge as far as the genetic engineering industry is concerned.The
industry has been told again and again by its public relations advisors that
there might have been more success in winning global acceptance of GE
foods if the first ones introduced had offered something perceived as a
‘consumer benefit’, such as increased vitamin content.The industry hopes a
cute GE pet could be a good way to prepare the public for a flood of other
GE animals in the pipeline, such as fast growing fish or pigs engineered for
intensive factory farming operations.

The US Food and Drug Administration declined to regulate the GE GloFish,
because there are currently no regulations that pertain to ornamental fish.
“Allowing the unregulated sale of GloFish provides a gateway for GE
fish to find their way on to our dinner plates and into our
environment,” commented Joseph Mendelson, legal director of the
Washington based Center for Food Safety. “By not stepping in to regulate
these fish, the US regulatory agencies are establishing a dangerous
precedent for all future gene-altered animals, whether created as food
or pet fads”.102

i widespread opposition to the commercial development of GE fish

Increasing awareness of the considerable hazards associated with GE fish
means that the commercial future of GE fish is far from certain.
Opposition to the commercial development of GE fish has been voiced by
governments, industry bodies, scientific institutions and a wide range of
other organisations.

* Deep concern about the ecological impacts of GE fish has been expressed
by highly influential scientific bodies such the Royal Society and the US
National Academy of Sciences.103 The Royal Society called for a
moratorium on the release of GE fish in sea pens and recommended that
commercial approval only be granted for GE fish kept in contained land-
based facilities. Although land-based facilities are an improvement on fish
farms located in open water, experience with such facilities shows that
animals, floods and human accident mean that fish could still end up
escaping into open waterways.104 Birds, for example, pick up fish from
land-based farms and then sometimes drop them into open water.
Flooding, which is increasingly common as climate change alters weather
patterns, can also provide routes for fish to escape.

* In 1992, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in the US published
an administrative rule, stating that: “The Department shall consider
releases of GE fish to pose a serious risk to wild populations. The
Department shall not authorize the release of GE fish into locations
where such fish may gain access to wild fish populations”.105 In 2001,
the state of Maryland in the US placed a five-year prohibition on the
introduction of any GE fish into any state waterways that flow into any
other body of water.106 In 2002, the Washington Fish and Wildlife
Commission banned all GE fish from Washington State fish farms in
marine waters.107 In 2003, California passed a law making it illegal to
spawn, cultivate, or incubate any GE fish in the waters of the Pacific Ocean
over which the state has jurisdiction.108

* During recent meetings of the National Atlantic Salmon Conservation

Organization (NASCO, established by international treaty and consisting of
Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Iceland, Norway, the Russian
Federation, and the United States), the parties agreed to support a
resolution, which states that the parties will “take all possible actions
to ensure that the use of GE salmon, in any part of the NASCO

Convention Area, is confined to secure, self-contained, land-based
facilities”.109

* In March 2002, European ministers agreed at the 5th North Sea

Conference at Bergen, Sweden to take all possible actions to prevent the
release of GE marine organisms to the marine environment, and to ensure
that their culture is confined to secure, self-contained, land-based
facilities.110 Other bans on the environmental release of GE fish are in place
at a local and national level in Europe.111 In Austria, for example, the
federal counties of Salzburg, Styria and Vorarlberg adopted amendments
to their fisheries law, which ban the release of GE fish.112

* A number of industry bodies representing aquaculture and fisheries

interests are strongly opposed to the use of GE fish.113 The Swedish Fish
Industry Association, for example, recommends its member companies
“to completely refrain from having anything to do with GE fish”.114

* In June 2003, the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission, the
Helsinki Commission and the Commission for the Protection of the Marine
Environment of the North East Atlantic held a joint ministerial meeting in
Bergen, Germany. In the joint declaration from this meeting, they stated
that: “Recognising that the release of genetically modified marine
organisms presents an inherent threat of potentially severe,
irreversible and transboundary effects, and the need to apply the
precautionary principle, we agree to take all possible actions, in
accordance with the requirements of the Directive 2001/18/EC and
comparable national legislation, to ensure that the culture of
genetically modified marine organisms is confined to secure, self-
contained, land-based facilities in order to prevent their release to
the marine environment.”115

Several governments, intergovernmental organisations and conventions have
already taken steps to try to prevent GE fish from being accidentally or
deliberately released into aquatic systems. However, steps need to be taken
globally, as any released GE fish will not respect national boundaries. A
suitable multilateral instrument would be the Cartagena Protocol on
Biosafety of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which seeks to protect
biological diversity from the potential hazards posed by GE organisms.

conclusions

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FISH
– NEW THREATS TO THE ENVIRONMENT

CONCLUSIONS

This report has examined many of the hazards associated with GE fish.
The physical containment of these fish cannot be guaranteed under
commercial conditions and any escapes into the environment could have
devastating effects on wild fish populations and biodiversity.

Greenpeace demands that:

* Genetic engineering of fish for commercial purposes should be prohibited.
Once approved for commercial use, GE fish may never be contained;

* The Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety of the Convention on
Biological Diversity consider the special transboundary challenges posed
by GE fish, including the risks they pose to the environment, with a view to
prohibiting any facilities that could result in the introduction (either
accidental or deliberate) of GE fish into freshwater and marine
ecosystems.

The Bergen Declaration (Ministerial Declaration from 5th North Sea Conference, Bergen, March 2002)
“Recognizing that the release of genetically modified marine organisms is an emerging issue in the North Sea
owing to the inherent, potentially severe, irreversible and transboundary effects, and the need to apply the
precautionary principle, the Ministers agree to take all possible actions, in accordance with the requirements of the
Directive 2001/18 EC and comparable national legislation, to ensure that the culture of genetically modifed
marine organisms is confined to secure, self-contained, land-based facilities in order to prevent their release to the
marine environment.”
Full text of the declaration, and further information and background to the North Sea Conference itself, is

Letter to Greenpeace from Margareta Winberg, Swedish Minister of Agriculture, Sep 2002: ‘According to a
decision taken by the Swedish Parliament last year “Alien species and genetically modified organisms that may be
a threat to biological diversity may not be introduced”. Further, the decision states “Genetically modified fish may
not be released”. This decision is the national position regarded as an instruction for Swedish delegations in future
international deliberations concerning genetically engineered salmon.
MAFF (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) 2001. Review of salmon and freshwater fisheries’, UK
Government Response. Available at: <www.defra.gov.uk/fish/salmon/salmon.pdf> Recommendation 51: “Any GE
fish kept in England and Wales should be confined to self- contained land-based and escape-proof facilities, with all
necessary measures taken to ensure they cannot deliberately (by, for example, vandals) or accidentally be released
into the natural environment.”

One of the biggest fish farming companies in the world, Nutreco Aquaculture, based in the Netherlands, say that
they “will never use GE eggs.” Forbes magazine, February 19, 2001 p. 106
Also, ‘Norwegians applaud Greenpeace stance’, Intrafish, 6 Apr 2001. Excerpt from Ethical rules for the
aquaculture association: “The association do not accept GM fish which differ from natural populations and which
can affect biodiversity and surrounding environment in a negative way”…”It's marvellous that Greenpeace is also
taking up the fight against genetically modified salmon,” said NFF chairman, Tarald Sivertsen. On the Norwegian
salmon farming organisation's website it is abundantly clear that Norwegian fish farmers and fish farmers across
the globe are against plans by the American company Aqua Bounty Farms to produce genetically modified salmon
on a commercial basis.

Comments sent in response to information requests from Greenpeace. Other replies include:
FEDIS (Belgian Federation of retailers) “As agreed, we're informing you of the position adopted on 9 May by the
Commission 'food safety' of FEDIS re: international commercialisation of eggs from GM salmon. (....) In the case
of GM salmon, members of FEDIS cannot accept its commercialization because the risks of environmental
damage have been clearly identified. It is now to competent authorities to verify them. The utmost precaution is
therefore necessary. (...). Besides, if one cannot say anymore that there is global overproduction of salmon, one can
still say that supply meets demand, which remains high. Consequently, an insufficient production can certainly not
be invoked to justify a demand for authorisation as the one introduced by A/F Protein. We will forward this
standpoint to our European organization EuroCommerce, as well as to the Ag Min Jaak Gabriels.” - Letter to
Greenpeace May 2001.
In 1996 the ISFA (organisation for salmon-producing countries around the world), implemented the following
resolution: In line with good environmental practice, the ISFA rejects unequivocally the production of genetically
modified salmon. “In connection with the aim of maintaining a high animal ethics standard, the ISFA's members
will not make use of growth hormones in their salmon production.”…. “It is not possible to make a clearer
statement. Nevertheless, every year we bear the brunt of attempts to connect gene manipulation to salmon through
[publicity] from this firm. We very much appreciate Greenpeace's engagement in focusing attention on this issue. I
am hoping in any case that a united salmon industry and Greenpeace's efforts can bring an end to these attempts.
Consumers across the globe should be made aware that Norwegian fish farmers base their livelihoods on a
sustainable and environmentally friendly production of a healthy and good product. The consumers deserve this
much and they can rely on this.”
