The farming of aquatic plants and animals is known as
aquaculture and has been practised for around 4000 years in
some regions of the world1. Since the mid-1980s, however,
production of ﬁsh, crustaceans and shellﬁsh by aquaculture
has grown massively (Figure 1). Globally, aquacultural
production has become the fastest growing food production
sector involving animal species. About 430 (97%) of the
aquatic species presently in culture have been domesticated
since the start of the 20th century2 and the number of aquatic
species domesticated is still rising rapidly. It was recently
estimated that aquaculture provides 43% of all the ﬁsh
consumed by humans today3.

The landings of ﬁsh from the world’s oceans have gradually declined
in recent years as stocks have been progressively overﬁshed4. At the
same time, demand for seafood has been steadily rising and, in
parallel, aquaculture production has expanded signiﬁcantly. This
expansion is both a response to increasing demand for seafood and,
especially in the case of luxury products such as salmon and shrimp,
an underlying cause of that rising demand (see ﬁgure 1).

The animal species that tend to dominate world aquaculture are
those at the lower end of the food chain – shellﬁsh, herbivorous ﬁsh
(plant-eating) and omnivorous ﬁsh (eating both plants and animals),
(see ﬁgure 2). For example, carp and shellﬁsh account for a
signiﬁcant share of species cultivated for human consumption in
developing countries5. However, production of species higher in the
food chain, such as shrimp, salmon, and marine ﬁnﬁsh, is now
growing, in response to a ready market for these species in
developed countries3,5.

Introduction

Against a continuing background of diminishing and over–exploited
marine resources, aquaculture has been widely held up as a panacea to
the problem of providing a growing world population with ever-increasing
amounts of ﬁsh for consumption. With the expansion of the industry,
however, the tendency has been for methods of production to intensify,
particularly in the production of carnivorous species. This has resulted in
many serious impacts on the environment and human rights abuses.

This report examines some of the serious environmental and social
impacts that have resulted from the development and practice of
aquaculture and which are reﬂected across the global industry. It starts
by looking at the production of salmon, tuna, other marine ﬁnﬁsh, shrimp
and tilapia. These case studies serve to illustrate a number of these
environmental and social problems, which together undermine the
sustainability of contemporary aquaculture (Section 2). Negative social
impacts have been associated with both the production and processing
industries in developing countries. Abuses stem from the desire of
producers and processors to maximise proﬁts within a highly competitive
market, while meeting the low prices demanded by consumers (Section
2). The use of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil as feed in the production of some
species is a key issue (Section 3). Other negative environmental impacts
can be addressed in a variety of ways in order to place aquaculture on a
more sustainable footing (Section 4 and 5). Section 6 brieﬂy explores
certiﬁcation of aquaculture products. Ultimately, aquaculture must
become sustainable. In order to achieve this, the aquaculture industry
will need to adopt and adhere to rigorous standards (Section 7).

Negative Impacts of Aquaculture
on People and on the Environment

The following case studies of negative impacts of aquaculture are far
from exhaustive. Rather, they provide examples that illustrate the wide
spectrum of problems associated with aquacultural activities, and
cast serious doubts on industry claims of sustainability.

2.1 SHRIMP

Destruction of Habitat: The creation of ponds for marine shrimp
aquaculture has led to the destruction of thousands of hectares of
mangroves and coastal wetlands. Signiﬁcant losses of mangroves
have occurred in many countries including the Philippines6, Vietnam7,
Thailand8, Bangladesh9 and Ecuador10.

Mangroves are important because they support numerous marine as
well as terrestrial species, protect coastlines from storms and are
important in the subsistence of many coastal communities.
Mangroves provide nursery grounds for various young aquatic
animals including commercially important ﬁsh, and their destruction
can lead to substantial losses for commercial ﬁsheries11,12.

Collection of Wild Juveniles as Stock

Aquaculture of some species relies on juvenile ﬁsh or shellﬁsh being
caught from the wild to stock culture ponds. For example, even
though hatchery-raised shrimp constitute a major supply of shrimp
juveniles (scientiﬁcally called “postlarvae”) to the aquaculture industry,
shrimp farms in many parts of the world are still based on wild-caught
juveniles. Some natural stocks of shrimp are now over-exploited as a
result of juveniles collection from the wild13,14. Furthermore, the
juvenile shrimp may only represent a small fraction of each catch, with
a large incidental catch (by-catch) and mortality of other species
taking place (see text box 1). This poses serious threats to regional
biodiversity and reduces food available to other species such as
aquatic birds and reptiles.

Box 1 Loss of other species during the collection
of wild shrimp juveniles

• In Bangladesh, for each tiger shrimp juvenile collected there were

12–551 shrimp larvae of other species caught and killed,
together with 5–152 ﬁnﬁsh larvae and 26–1636
macrozooplanktonic animals.

• In Honduras, the reported annual collection of 3.3 billion shrimp
juveniles resulted in the destruction of an estimated 15–20 billion
fry of other species13.

• In the Indian Sundarbans, tiger shrimp juveniles only account for
0.25–0.27% of the total catch. The rest of the catch contains
huge numbers of juvenile ﬁnﬁsh and shellﬁsh which are left aside
on the beach ﬂats to die15.

Chemicals used to Control Diseases

A wide variety of chemicals and drugs may be added to aquaculture
cages and ponds in order to control viral, bacterial, fungal or other
pathogens16. There is a risk that such agents may harm aquatic life
nearby. The use of antibiotics also brings a potential risk to public
health as over-use of these drugs can result in the development of
antibiotic-resistance in bacteria that cause disease in humans.
Studies on shrimp farms in Vietnam17 and the Philippines18 found
bacteria had acquired resistance to the antibiotics used on the farms.

Depletion and Salinizsation of Potable Water and Salinisation
of Agricultural Land

Intensive shrimp farming in ponds requires considerable amounts of
fresh water to maintain pond water at the optimum salinity for shrimp
growth. Typically this involves pumping water from nearby rivers or
groundwater supplies, and this may deplete local freshwater
resources. Furthermore, if aquifers are pumped excessively, salt water
seeps in from the nearby sea causing salinisation and making the
water unﬁt for human consumption19,20. For example, in Sri Lanka,
74% of coastal people in shrimp farming areas no longer have ready
access to drinking water21. Shrimp farming can also cause increased
soil salinity in adjacent agricultural areas, leading to declines in crops.
For instance, there are numerous reports of crop losses in Bangladesh
caused by the salinisation of land, associated with shrimp farming22.

Human Rights Abuses

The positioning of shrimp farms has often blocked access to coastal
areas that were once common land in use by many people. There is
often a lack of formalised land rights and entitlements in such areas
and this has led to large scale displacement of communities, often
without ﬁnancial compensation or alternative land made available on
which to live (see text box 2).

Non-violent protests against the industry have frequently been
countered with threats and intimidation. According to the
Environmental Justice Foundation21, violence has frequently been
meted out by security personnel and “enforcers” associated with the
shrimp industry, many protesters have been arrested on false charges
and there are even reports from at least 11 countries of protesters
being murdered (see ﬁgure 3). (In Bangladesh alone there have been
an estimated 150 murders linked to aquaculture disputes.)
Perpetrators of such violence are very rarely brought to justice.

Box 2 Case studies of land seizures for shrimp farm
construction

2.2 SALMON

Nutrient Pollution

• Some Indonesian shrimp farms have been constructed following
forced land seizures in which companies, supported by police
and government agencies, provided either inappropriate
compensation or none at all. Such cases have been reported
from Sumatra, Maluku, Papua and Sulawesi.

• In Ecuador, reports indicate that there have been thousands of

forced land seizures, only 2% of which have been resolved on a
legal basis. Tens of thousands of hectares of ancestral land have
allegedly been seized. This has often involved use of physical
force and the deployment of military personnel21.

• Between 1992-1998 in the Gulf of Fonseca, Honduras, many
coastal-dwelling people lost access to their traditional food
sources and access to ﬁshing sites because of encroachment on
land by commercial shrimp-farming companies23.

Organic wastes from ﬁsh or crustacean farming include uneaten food,
body wastes and dead ﬁsh24. In salmon farming, these wastes enter
the aquatic environment in the vicinity of the cages. In extreme cases
the large numbers of ﬁsh present in the cages can generate sufﬁcient
waste to cause oxygen levels in the water to fall, resulting in the
suffocation of both wild and farmed ﬁsh. More usually, the impacts of
intensive salmon culture are seen in a marked reduction in biodiversity
around the cages25. For example, a study in Scotland found a
reduction in biodiversity on the seabed up to 200 metres away from
salmon cages26. In Chile, biodiversity close to eight salmon farms was
reduced by at least 50%. Wastes can also act as plant nutrients and,
in areas where water circulation is restricted, these may also lead to
the rapid growth of certain species of phytoplankton (microscopic
algae) and ﬁlamentous algae27. Some of the algal blooms which can
result are very harmful: they can cause the death of a range of marine
animals and also cause shellﬁsh poisoning in humans.

Negative Impacts of Aquaculture
on People and on the Environment

Threat to Wild Fish from escaped Farmed Salmon

Human Rights Issues

Farmed Atlantic salmon have a lower genetic variability than wild
Atlantic salmon28,29. Hence, if they interbreed with wild salmon, the
offspring may be less ﬁt than wild salmon and genetic variability that is
important for adaptability in the wild may be lost. It was originally
thought that escaped salmon would be less able to cope with
conditions encountered in the wild and would be unable to survive,
thereby not posing a threat to the genetic diversity of wild
populations. In reality, the sheer numbers that have escaped (an
estimated 3 million per year)30 mean that they are now breeding with
wild salmon in Norway, Ireland, the United Kingdom and North
America. Because they produce offspring less able to survive in the
wild, this means that already vulnerable populations could be driven
towards extinction. In Norway, farmed salmon have been estimated to
comprise 11–35% of the population of spawning salmon; for some
populations this may rise to more than 80%28. Continuing escapes
may mean that the original genetic proﬁle of the population will not
re-assert itself31.

In addition to threats to wild Atlantic salmon caused by escapees in
their native regions, farmed Atlantic salmon that have been introduced
to Paciﬁc streams pose a threat to other native ﬁsh populations, such
as steelhead in North America and galaxiid ﬁshes in South America,
because they compete for food and habitat28.

Diseases and Parasites

Diseases and parasites can be particularly problematic in ﬁsh farming
where stocking densities are high. Wild populations of ﬁsh passing
near to farms may also be affected. One notable example is that of
parasitic sea lice which feed on salmon skin, mucous and blood and
which can even cause the death of the ﬁsh. There is evidence that
wild salmon populations have been affected by lice spread from farms
in British Columbia32 and Norway31. Recent research in British
Columbia suggests that sea lice infestation resulting from farms will
cause the local pink salmon populations to fall by 99% within their
next four generations33. If outbreaks continue unchecked, extinction is
almost certain.

In southern Chile the salmon farming industry has grown rapidly since
the late 1980s to serve export markets in western nations34,35. In 2005,
nearly 40% of the world’s farmed salmon was supplied from Chilean
producers and processors36.

This burgeoning industry has an appalling safety record. Poor or non-
existent safety conditions have been widely reported on Chilean farms
and in processing plants35,36. Over the past three years there have
been more than 50 accidental deaths, mostly of divers. By contrast,
no deaths have been reported in the Norwegian salmon industry, the
world’s largest producer of salmon37. Reports from Chile also tell of
low wages (around the national poverty line), long working hours, lack
of respect for maternity rights and persistent sexual harassment of
women35,36.

2.3 OTHER MARINE FINFISH

Marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture is an emerging industry. Improvements in
the technology of salmon farming together with decreasing market
prices for salmon have inspired the industry to start farming higher-
value marine ﬁnﬁsh species. Species which are now being farmed
include (1) Atlantic cod in Norway, UK, Canada and Iceland; (2)
haddock in Canada, Norway and northeastern United States; (3)
Paciﬁc threadﬁn in Hawaii; (4) black sableﬁsh under development in
British Columbia and Washington State; (5) mutton snapper; (6)
Atlantic halibut; (7) turbot; (8) sea bass and (9) sea bream5,28. Most
species are reared in net pens or cages like salmon, although Atlantic
halibut and turbot are generally farmed in tanks on land.

It is likely that environmental problems similar to those encountered in
salmon farming will also manifest themselves in the farming of these
“new” marine species in cages. In some cases they could be worse.
For example, cod produce considerably more waste than Atlantic
salmon28 leading to potential nutrient pollution. Even if the impacts of
this can be reduced by siting cages some distance offshore where
water movements are more vigorous, other impacts are still likely to
result. As in the case of salmon aquaculture, these include a risk of
disease spreading to wild populations and, if selectively bred, there is
a risk of escapees competing with wild ﬁsh and interbreeding with
them, causing a reduction in genetic variability.

2.4 TUNA RANCHING – WIPING OUT BLUEFIN TUNA IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN SEA

The present level of ﬁshing effort directed at northern blueﬁn tuna in
the Mediterranean threatens the future of this species in the region
and the future of hundreds of ﬁshermen. There are serious concerns
that commercial extinction of the species may be just around the
corner38.

In May 1999, Greenpeace released a report describing the depletion
of blueﬁn tuna in the Mediterranean39. This noted that the spawning
stock biomass (total weight) of tuna was estimated to have decreased
by 80% over the previous 20 years. In addition, huge amounts of
juvenile tuna were being caught every season. Greenpeace reported
that the main threat to the blueﬁn tuna at that time was Illegal,
Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) ﬁshing, also called “pirate ﬁshing”.
IUU ﬁshing operates outside of management and conservation rules
and, in effect, steals ﬁsh from the oceans. It has become a serious
and wide-ranging global problem, is a threat to marine biodiversity
and a serious obstacle to achieving sustainable ﬁsheries40,41.

Seven years on in 2006, further analysis by Greenpeace showed that
threats to the tuna had worsened38. Pirate ﬁshing continued
unabated, and was now fuelled by a new incentive of supplying tuna
to an increasing number of tuna ranches in Mediterranean countries.

In tuna ranching, ﬁsh are caught alive and grown on in cages with
artiﬁcial feeding. The fattened ﬁsh are then killed and exported, mainly
to Japan. Tuna ranching began in the late 1990s and has boomed,
spreading to 11 countries by 2006 (see ﬁgure 4). Today, due to poor
management of tuna ﬁsheries, nobody knows the exact numbers of
tuna taken from the Mediterranean Sea each year. Nonetheless, it is
clear that current catch levels are well above the legal quota. For
example, it was estimated, based on 2005 ﬁgures, that over 44,000
tonnes of tuna may have been caught in the Mediterranean. This was
37.5% over the legally sanctioned catch limit and, disturbingly, almost
70% above the scientiﬁcally recommended maximum catch level. The
total capacity of the tuna ranches exceeds the total allowable catch
quotas which exist to supply them. This is a clear incentive for illegal
ﬁshing in the region. An examination of available trends in the industry
clearly indicates that illegal ﬁshing for tuna is supplying ranches38.

2.5 TILAPIA

Introduction of Alien Species

When a species is released into an environment where is it not native,
it may reproduce successfully but have negative consequences on
native species42. Tilapia species provide a striking illustration of the
problems that such releases can cause. Three species of tilapia are
the most important in aquaculture: the Nile tilapia, the Mozambique
tilapia and the blue tilapia43. These freshwater ﬁsh are native to Africa
and the Middle East but over the past 30 years their use in
aquaculture has expanded and they are now farmed in about 85
countries worldwide. Presently, tilapia are second only to carp as the
quantitatively most important farmed ﬁsh in the world44. Tilapia have
escaped from sites where they are cultured into the wider
environment, have successfully invaded new habitats and
consequently have become a widely distributed exotic species.

Once in a non-native environment, tilapia threaten native ﬁsh by
feeding on their juveniles as well as on plants that are habitat refuges
for juveniles. Negative impacts of tilapia invasions into non-native
regions have been widely reported and include:

1 the decline of an endangered ﬁsh species in Nevada and Arizona,

2 the decline of a native ﬁsh in Madagascar,

3 the decline of native cichlid species in Nicaragua and in Kenya, and

4 the breeding of escaped tilapia in Lake Chichincanab, Mexico to
become the dominant species44 at the cost of the native ﬁsh
populations.

A speciﬁc assessment of several important industrially ﬁshed species
concluded that, for the most part, the ﬁsheries were entirely
unsustainable47. Other research has shown that the ﬁsheries must be
regarded as fully exploited or over-exploited48,49. Consequently, there
is a crucial need for aquaculture to reduce its dependence on
ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil.

Demands for Fishmeal and Fish Oil in Aquaculture…..

The quantity of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil used by the aquaculture industry
has increased over the years as aquaculture has expanded and
intensiﬁed. In 2003, the industry used 53% of the total world’s
ﬁshmeal production and 86% of the world’s ﬁsh oil production5,52. The
increased demand for ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil by aquaculture has been
met by diverting these products away from their use as feed for
agricultural animals, in itself a controversial issue. Currently,
agricultural use of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil is increasingly restricted to
starter and breeder diets for poultry and pigs. Fish oil previously used
in the manufacture of hard margarines and bakery products has now
been largely diverted to aquacultural use53. Figure 5 depicts the
estimated global use of ﬁshmeal within compound aquafeeds in 2003
by major species.

Although a trend has emerged in recent years of replacing ﬁshmeal
with plant-based proteins in aquaculture feeds, the fraction of
ﬁshmeal/oil used for diets of carnivorous species remains high.
Moreover, this trend has not been fast enough to offset the growing
use of ﬁshmeal, caused simply by an increase in the overall number of
farmed carnivorous ﬁsh produced. For example, the quantity of wild
ﬁsh required as feed to produce one unit of farmed salmon reduced
by 25% between 1997 and 2001, but the total production of farmed
salmon grew by 60%5, eclipsing much of the improvement in
conversion efﬁciencies.

Greenpeace International Challenging the Aquaculture on Sustainability 13

Fishmeal and ﬁsh oil used in aquaculture feeds are largely derived
from small oily ﬁsh such as anchovies, herrings and sardines (larger
sardines are also known as pilchards), taken in the so-called
“industrial ﬁsheries”. As aquaculture methods have intensiﬁed, there
has been a growing dependence on ﬁshmeal/oil as a feed source.
The farming of carnivorous species in particular is highly dependent
on the use of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil, in synthetic diets used to simulate
natural prey taken as food in the wild.

Farming Carnivores – A Net Loss of Protein….

The aquaculture industry has consistently promoted the idea that its
activities are key to assuring future sustainable world ﬁsh supplies and
will relieve pressures on over-exploited marine resources. In fact, in the
case of carnivorous ﬁsh and shrimp the input of wild caught ﬁsh
exceeds the output of farmed ﬁsh by a considerable margin, since
conversion efﬁciencies are not high. For example, each kilogram of
salmon, other marine ﬁnﬁsh or shrimp produced may use 2.5–5 kg of
wild ﬁsh as feed45. For tuna ranching, the ratio of wild ﬁsh needed as
feed to the amount of tuna ﬁsh produced is even higher – 20 kg ﬁsh-
feed to 1 kg farmed ﬁsh46. Thus, farming of carnivorous species results
in a net loss rather than a net gain of ﬁsh protein. Instead of alleviating
pressure on wild ﬁsh stocks, therefore, aquaculture of carnivorous
species increases pressure on wild stocks of ﬁsh, albeit of different
species. With further intensiﬁcation of aquaculture and expansion of
marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture, it is likely that demand for ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh
oil will even outstrip the current unsustainable supply.

Unsustainable Fisheries….

Many global marine ﬁsheries are currently exploited in an
unsustainable manner, and this includes industrial ﬁsheries. Concerns
extend to other marine species because ﬁsh taken by industrial
ﬁshers play a vital role in marine ecosystems. They are prey for many
other ﬁsh species (including commercially important species), marine
mammals and sea birds. Overﬁshing of industrially ﬁshed species has
led to negative impacts on the breeding success of some seabirds
(see text box 3).

Box 3 Negative impacts of industrial ﬁsheries on seabirds

• In the late 1960s the Norwegian spring-spawning herring stock
collapsed due to over ﬁshing. Stocks continued to remain low
between 1969 and 1987 and this severely impacted the breeding
success of Atlantic pufﬁns due to lack of food50.

• Overﬁshing of North Sea sandeel stocks in recent years has had a

negative impact on the breeding success of black-legged
kittiwakes51. Closure of the ﬁshery east of Scotland was
recommended from 2000–2004 to safeguard these birds and the
local population of pufﬁns.

Use of Fishmeal/Fish Oil/Bycatch
in Aquaculture Feeds and Associated Problems

Food Security Issues….

The use of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil derived from marine species of ﬁsh for
aquaculture also has implications for human food security. For
example, in Southeast Asia and Africa, small pelagic (open water) ﬁsh
such as those targeted by industrial ﬁsheries are important in the
human diet54. Demand for such ﬁsh is likely to grow as populations
increase, bringing them under pressure both from aquaculture and
direct consumption55. In addition, low value ﬁsh (inappropriately
termed “trash ﬁsh”) caught as by-catch and used for ﬁshmeal
production are actually an important food source for poorer people in
developing countries56. Use of “trash ﬁsh” in aquaculture inﬂates
prices such that the rural poor can no longer afford to buy it52. With
these factors in mind, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) has recommended that governments of major aquaculture-
producing countries prohibit the use of “trash ﬁsh” as feed for the
culture of high value ﬁsh.

The aquaculture industry is highly dependent upon wild caught ﬁsh to
manufacture feed for cultured species. This is widely recognised as an
intensive and generally unsustainable use of a ﬁnite resource. In turn,
the industry has recognised the need to evaluate and use more plant-
based feed materials and reduce dependence on ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil.

Plants are already used in aquaculture feeds. Those that are used
and/or show particular promise for the future include soybean, barley,
canola, corn, cottonseed and pea/lupin57. It is important to note that if
plant-based feeds are used in aquaculture, to be sustainable they
must be sourced from agriculture that is sustainable. Sustainable
agriculture by deﬁnition precludes the use of any genetically modiﬁed
crops. These crops are associated with a number of potential
environmental impacts, genetic contamination of non-GE crops and
have also sparked a number of food-safety concerns which remain
unresolved58.

For some herbivorous and omnivorous ﬁsh, it has been possible to
replace completely any ﬁshmeal in the diet with plant-based
feedstuffs without impacts on ﬁsh growth and yield52. Rearing such
species in this way suggests a more sustainable future path for
aquaculture provided that the feeds themselves are produced
through sustainable agriculture.

Feeding of carnivorous species seems to be more problematic.
Fishmeal and ﬁsh oil can be reduced by at least 50% in the diet, but
complete substitution for plant ingredients has not yet been possible
for commercial production. Problems include the presence of certain
compounds in plants that are not favourable to ﬁsh, known as anti-
nutritional factors, and the lack of certain essential (omega-3) fatty
acids29,52. Oily ﬁsh is considered to be an important source of omega-
3 fatty acids in human nutrition, but feeding ﬁsh with plant oil-based
diets alone reduces the amount in their ﬂesh. Recent research,
however, has found that the ﬁsh oil input could be reduced by feeding
ﬁsh with plant oils but switching to ﬁsh oils in the period just prior to
slaughter59. Recent research on marine shrimp suggests that it may
be possible to replace ﬁshmeal in the diet largely with plant-based
ingredients, although further study is needed60,61.

Some aquaculture, particularly that classiﬁed as “organic”, uses ﬁsh
trimmings as feed – offcuts of ﬁsh from the ﬁlleting and processing of
ﬁsh for human consumption. This is more sustainable than using
normal ﬁshmeal in that a waste product is being used. However,
unless the ﬁshery from which the ﬁsh trimmings come from is itself
sustainable, the use of ﬁsh trimmings cannot be seen as sustainable
because it perpetuates the cycle of over-exploitation of ﬁsheries.

In aquaponics systems, efﬂuents from ﬁsh farming are used as a
nutrient source for growing vegetables, herbs and/or ﬂowers. One
existing commercially viable aquaponics system involves the
cultivation of tilapia in land-based tanks from which the waste water is
used to grow vegetables (without soil) in greenhouses65. A company
in the Netherlands called ‘Happy Shrimp’ partially use waste from
their farms to grow vegetables. The shrimp are fed on algae and
bacteria as well as on aquaculture feed containing a high proportion
of plant protein. The shrimp are cultivated in greenhouses
and no shrimp juveniles are extracted from the wild66.

In integrated rice–ﬁsh culture, ﬁsh are cultivated alongside rice, which
optimises use of both land and water. The nitrogen-rich ﬁsh excretory
products fertilise the rice, and the ﬁsh also control weeds and pests
by consuming them as food. Much of the ﬁsh nutrition is derived
naturally in this way. Major constraints to widespread use of such
methods include the fact that many farmers are not educated in the
required skills67. This could be overcome if policy makers gave active
support to this practice. Integrated rice–ﬁsh culture is crucial for local
food security rather than for supplying export markets.

In order for aquaculture operations to move towards sustainable
production, the industry needs to recognise and address the full
spectrum of environmental and societal impacts caused by its
operations. Essentially, this means that it will no longer be acceptable
for the industry to place burdens of production, (such as the disposal
of waste) onto the wider environment.

In turn, this implies moving towards closed production systems. For
example, in order to prevent nutrient pollution, ways can be found to
use nutrients present in waste products beneﬁcially. Examples include
integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) (see text box 4),
aquaponics and integrated rice-ﬁsh culture.

Box 4 Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems (IMTA)

In IMTA systems, organic waste products from the fed species
(ﬁnﬁsh or shrimp) are used as food by other cultivated species
such as seaweed and shellﬁsh. For example, at a commercial IMTA
farm in Israel, marine ﬁsh (gilthead seabream) are farmed and their
nutrient-rich waste is used to grow seaweed. In turn, the seaweed
is used to feed Japanese abalone which can be sold
commercially62. In other systems being developed, the seaweed
itself may be commercially viable63,64.

The growth of aquaculture has led to a multiplicity of concerns
attached to environmental impacts, social impacts, food safety,
animal health and welfare and economic/ﬁnancial issues. All of these
factors inﬂuence the sustainability of a given aquaculture system.
Presently, there are a growing number of certiﬁcation schemes which
seek to reassure buyers, retailers and consumers about various of
these concerns. Currently existing certiﬁcation schemes, however, do
not cover all of these issues and can sometimes present a confusing
and conﬂicting picture to retailers and consumers. A recent analysis of
18 aquaculture certiﬁcation schemes by the World Wildlife Fund
(WWF) showed that they generally had major shortcomings in terms
of the way in which they considered environmental standards and
social issues68.

The WWF report sets out benchmark criteria on environmental,
social and animal welfare issues in aquaculture. The FAO has also
recently published a document which covers many of the relevant
issues and could be used as a guide by certification bodies69. Any
certification process, as an absolute minimum, needs to conform to
these FAO guidelines. Nonetheless, certification criteria alone will
not ensure the sustainability of the aquaculture industry worldwide.
In order to do so, a more fundamental rethink and restructuring of
the industry is essential.

Any aquaculture that takes place needs to be sustainable and fair.
For aquaculture systems to be sustainable, they must not lead to
natural systems being subject to degradation caused by:

1 an increase in concentrations of naturally occurring substances,

2 an increase in concentrations of substances, produced by society,

such as persistent chemicals and carbon dioxide and

3 physical disturbance.

In addition people should not be subject to conditions that
systematically undermine their capacity to meet their basic needs for
food, water and shelter.

In practical terms, these four conditions can be translated into the
following recommendations:

Use of Fishmeal, Fish oil and “Trash Fish”: To reduce the
pressure on stocks caught for ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil, there needs to be
a continued move towards sustainably produced plant-based feeds.
Cultivating ﬁsh that are lower down the food chain (herbivores and
omnivores rather than top predators) that can be fed on plant-based
diets is key to achieving sustainable aquaculture practices. Industry
must expand its research and development on herbivorous and
omnivorous ﬁsh which have strong market potential and suitability
for farming.

In more general terms, there is an urgent need for ﬁsheries
management to shift towards an ecosystem-based approach wherein
a global network of fully protected marine reserves covering 40% of
the oceans is established together with sustainable ﬁsheries
management outside of the reserves70. This is key to achieving
sustainable ﬁsheries.

Greenpeace considers the culture of species that require ﬁshmeal or
ﬁsh oil-based feeds derived from unsustainable ﬁsheries and/or which
yield conversion ratios of greater than one (i.e. represent a net loss in
ﬁsh protein yield) as unsustainable. Plant-based feeds should
originate from sustainable agriculture, and sources of omega 3 should
be algal derivatives, grape seed oils, etc.

Nutrient Pollution and Chemical Pollution: To reduce nutrient
wastes, there is great potential for the development of integrated
multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems, aquaponics and integrated
rice-ﬁsh culture.

Greenpeace considers aquaculture that results in negative
environmental impacts in terms of discharges/efﬂuents to the
surrounding environment as unsustainable.

Escapes of Farmed Fish to the Wild: To overcome these problems
it has been suggested that enclosed bag nets/closed wall sea pens
should be used to prevent ﬁsh from escaping, or that land-based
tanks should be used5. Ultimately, land-based tanks are the only
option if the goal is to eliminate any risk of escapes which might
otherwise occur as a result of hurricanes or other extreme weather
events at sea. It is crucial to use native rather than exotic species42.

Greenpeace recommends that only species which are native should
be cultivated in open water systems, and then only in bag nets,
closed wall sea pens or equivalent closed systems. Cultivation of non-
native species should be restricted to land-based tanks.

Protection of Local Habitat: Some aquaculture practices have had
serious negative impacts on local habitat. Aquaculture practices must
be set up in a way that provides for the protection of coastal
ecosystems and local habitats. In addition, no new aquaculture
practices should be permitted in areas that are to be designated as
marine reserves and any existing aquaculture operations within such
areas should be phased out.

Greenpeace considers aquaculture which causes negative effects to
local wildlife (plants as well as animals) or represents a risk to local
wild populations as unsustainable.

Use of Wild Juveniles: The use of wild-caught juveniles to supply
aquaculture practices, particularly some shrimp aquaculture, is
destructive to marine ecosystems.

Greenpeace considers aquaculture which relies on wild-caught
juveniles as unsustainable.

Transgenic Fish: The physical containment of genetically engineered
ﬁsh cannot be guaranteed under commercial conditions and any
escapes into the environment could have devastating effects on wild
ﬁsh populations and biodiversity71.

Greenpeace demands that genetic engineering of ﬁsh for commercial
purposes should be prohibited.

Diseases: Greenpeace recommends cultivation at stocking densities
that minimise the risk of disease outbreaks and transmission and,
therefore, minimise requirements for therapeutic treatments.

Resources: Greenpeace considers aquaculture that depletes local
resources, for example, drinking water supplies and mangrove
forests, as unsustainable.

Human Health: Greenpeace considers aquaculture that threatens
human health as unfair and unsustainable.

Human Rights: Greenpeace considers aquaculture that does not
support the long-term economic and social well-being of local
communities as unfair and unsustainable.
