The NGO Coalition ‘Human Rights for Migrant Fishers’

Abolish	the	Overseas	Employment	Scheme	for	Migrant	Fishers

and	Expedite	the	Domestication	of	ILO	Convention	No.	188

(October	 21,	 2019,	 Taipei)	 Taiwan’s	 overseas	 employment	 scheme	 for	 migrant

fishers	contributes	to	‘bloody	seafood’	and	human	trafficking.	Migrant	fishers	from

Southeast	 Asia	 are	 the	 major	 victims.	 The	 International	 Labour	 Organization	 (ILO)

convened	 the	 Inaugural	 Plenary	 Meeting	 of	 the	 Southeast	 Asia	 (SEA)	 Forum	 for

Fishers	in	Bali,	Indonesia	on	September	25-26.	The	discussion	among	governments,

employers	associations,	trade	unions,	and	civil	society	representatives	about	how	to

curb	 human	 trafficking,	 forced	 labor,	 and	 slavery	 at	 sea	 led	 to	 a	 resolution.	 This

resolution	 calls	 for	 all	 flag	 States	 to	 ratify	 ILO	 Convention	 No.	 188	 (C188)	 and	 the

Protocol	 to	 ILO	 Convention	 No.	 29	 (C29),	 conduct	 gap	 analysis	 between	 domestic
regulations	 and	 ILO	 C188,	 and	 domesticate	 ILO	 C188	 with	 12	 months.	 In	 the	 36th
meeting	 of	 the	 Human	 Rights	 Promotion	 Panel	 of	 the	 Executive	 Yuan	 in	 June	 this

year,	the	Taiwanese	government	decided	to	domesticate	ILO	C188.	The	Ministry	of

Labor	will	oversee	the	process	of	domestication.	The	NGO	Coalition	‘Human	Rights

for	 Migrant	 Fishers’	 believes	 that	 this	 decision	 could	 help	 increase	 protection	 for

migrant	fishers.	However,	considerable	time	is	needed	for	domestication.	During	this

transition	 period,	 it	 is	 still	 urgent	 for	 the	 Government	 to	 deal	 with	 the	 problems

caused	by	the	overseas	employment	scheme	for	migrant	fishers.

The	 ILO	 resolution	 recognizes	 the	 strong	 connection	 between	 human	 trafficking,

forced	 labor,	 slavery	 and	 illegal,	 unreported	 and	 unregulated	 (IUU)	 fishing.	 Given

that	 distant	 water	 fishing	 has	 a	 very	 unique	 working	 environment,	 where	 fishers

work	far	away	from	shore,	and	that	fish	stocks	are	being	depleted,	some	vessels	are

taking	 risks,	 breaking	 laws	 in	 order	 to	 gain	 more	 profits.	 Some	 vessels	 choose	 to

reduce	 their	 operational	 costs	 by	 exploiting	 migrant	 fishers,	 including	 unlawfully

deducting	 their	 wages.	 This	 is	 why	 migrant	 fishers	 are	 often	 the	 frontline	 victims.

Migrant	fishers	working	on	Taiwanese	vessels	are	often	not	protected	by	applicable

laws.	 Incidents	 where	 migrant	 fishers	 are	 mistreated	 happen	 again	 and	 again.	 It

seems	that	the	regulation	for	overseas	employment	of	migrant	fishers	is	ineffective,

or	even	nonexistent.	The	NGO	Coalition	‘Human	Rights	for	Migrant	Fishers’	calls	for

the	 Taiwanese	 government	 to	 refer	 to	 ‘The	 Act	 to	 Implement	 the	 International

Covenant	on	Civil	and	Political	Rights	and	the	International	Covenant	on	Economic,

Social	 and	 Cultural	 Rights’,	 domesticate	 ILO	 C188	 and	 abolish	 the	 two-tiered

recruitment	system.

Currently,	regarding	the	employment	of	migrant	fishers,	Taiwan	uses	the	‘two-tiered

The NGO Coalition ‘Human Rights for Migrant Fishers’

system’,	 differentiating	 between	 domestic	 employment	 and	 overseas	 employment

of	migrant	fishers.	Migrant	fishers	recruited	domestically	and	overseas	are	subject	to

two	 different	 regulations	 administered	 by	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Labor	 and	 the	 Fisheries

Agency	 of	 the	 Council	 of	 Agriculture,	 respectively.	 This	 two-tiered	 system	 leads	 to

different	 wages	 and	 labor	 standards	 for	 migrant	 fishers.	 From	 the	 latest	 list	 of

vessels	 violating	 ‘The	 Act	 for	 Distant	 Water	 Fisheries’,	 unapproved	 recruitment	 of

migrant	fishers	accounted	for	41%	of	total	violations.	This	high	rate	shows	again	the

difficulty	 to	 enforce	 the	 regulation	 on	 overseas	 employment	 of	 migrant	 fishers.

Those	 migrant	 fishers	 recruited	 without	 the	 approval	 of	 the	 Government	 often	 fall

prey	 to	 debt	 bondage,	 forced	 labor,	 human	 trafficking	 and	 other	 human	 rights

abuses.	 The	 NGO	 Coalition	 ‘Human	 Rights	 for	 Migrant	 Fishers’	 believes	 that	 the

Government	 should	 first	 abolish	 the	 overseas	 employment	 scheme	 for	 migrant

fishers.	 Migrant	 fishers	 working	 in	 distant	 waters,	 and	 those	 working	 in	 coastal

waters,	should	all	be	managed	by	the	Ministry	of	Labor,	and	hence	all	be	protected

by	the	same	labor	standards.

In	 the	 2019	 Trafficking	 in	 Persons	 Report	 by	 the	 US	 Department	 of	 State,	 the

prioritized	recommendations	for	Taiwan	include	increasing	inspection	of	Taiwanese

vessels	 in	 distant	 waters	 suspected	 of	 forced	 labor.	 This	 shows	 the	 international

community	is	very	concerned	with	labor	exploitation	in	the	Taiwanese	distant	water

fishing	industry.	Combatting	human	trafficking	is	an	urgent	task	for	the	international

community.	 The	 NGO	 Coalition	 ‘Human	 Rights	 for	 Migrant	 Fishers’	 calls	 for	 the

Taiwanese	 government	 to	 domesticate	 ILO	 C188	 as	 soon	 as	 possible.	 Taiwan,	 as	 a

major	global	fishing	entity,	must	strictly	enforce	relevant	regulations,	ending	illegal

recruitment	and	labor	exploitation	so	that	Taiwan	can	stand	as	the	beacon	of	human

rights	 in	 Asia.	 The	 NGO	 Coalition	 ‘Human	 Rights	 for	 Migrant	 Fishers’	 calls	 for	 the

Government	to	immediately	implement	the	following	recommendations:

•  Abolish	the	overseas	employment	scheme	for	migrant	fishers	and

domesticate	ILO	C188.

•

Implement	other	ILO	conventions	for	labor	rights,	including	the	Protocol	to

ILO	C29	(Forced	Labor	Convention),	ILO	C87	(Freedom	of	Association	and

Protection	of	the	Right	to	Organize	Convention),	ILO	C98	(Right	to	Organize

and	Collective	Bargaining	Convention),	etc.

•  Migrant	fishers	hired	to	work	on	Taiwanese	fishing	vessels,	regardless	of

where	they	operate,	should	all	be	governed	by	the	Ministry	of	Labor,	and

thus	all	be	covered	by	the	same	labor	standards	and	legal	protection.

•

Increase	the	frequency	and	reliability	of	labor	inspections	for	coastal	and
distant	water	fishing	vessels.

•  Handle	human	trafficking	and	forced	labor	cases	promptly	once	reported,

strictly	enforce	relevant	regulations,	and	increase	prosecution	and	conviction

rates.

•  Establish	a	timely	and	effective	grievance	mechanism	for	migrant	fishers

(particularly	for	urgent	cases	at	sea).
