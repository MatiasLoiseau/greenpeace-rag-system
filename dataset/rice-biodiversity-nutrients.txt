What happened to the rice landraces during the ‘Green Revolution’?  
There are few sectors in agriculture where the so-called Green Revolution had such an 
overwhelming impact as in rice production. In 1966, the International Rice Research Institute 
(IRRI) released the first high yielding rice variet y in the Philippines. In the subsequent decade 
a small number of such high yielding varieties (HYV) almost completely replaced thousands 
of the traditional rice landraces previously cult ivated by the farmers. The traditional varieties 
where collected for conservation in the seed banks of national and international research 
institutions, which farmers had no access to. Adoption of the new varieties was expedited 
through vigorous political support in the Phil ippines, as in other Asian countries.  
The new rice plants had shorter stems, a higher harvest index (grain/straw ratio), and an 
enhanced response to fertilizer use. They ha d the advantage of deliv ering significantly higher 
yields when combined with accompanying ma nagement practices, including irrigation, 
pesticide and fertilizer application, and mech anization. Therefore, high yielding varieties 
spread only in favorable environments, where the natural and infrastructural setting allowed 
for such practices. In unfavorable environments , in which irrigation and mechanization were 
not possible or agrochemicals were not availabl e, the cultivation of the traditional landraces 
persisted.  
Today most of the rice fields throughout Asia are occupied by merely a small number of high 
yielding rice varieties. In the Ph ilippines almost half of the rice  area is devoted to four of the 
most widespread HYVs. In Cambodi a, one single IRRI variety ( IR66) accounts for around 90 
percent of the rice area. And in Pakistan, onl y four HYVs are planted on 99 percent of the 
countries rice fields. These figures1 illustrate the immense ‘genetic erosion’ that has occurred 
since the onset of the Green Revolution. The culti vation of traditional landraces is restricted to 
marginal areas, such as uplands environments. In  these areas, the biodiv ersity of rice varieties 
still remains substantial. For ex ample, a study in the Philippines2 found that more than 50 
kinds of rice landraces where cultivated in only two upland municipalities in the mountainous 

 3
Province of Aklan. However, biodiv ersity is also threatened in such areas, as an example from 
India demonstrates: while in the late 1950s ar ound 1700 rice varieties where cultivated in the 
Jeypore tract of the State of Orissa, by 1996 the nu mber had dwindled down to slightly more 
than 300 varieties3.  
What makes rice landraces interesting today? 
Genetic and Morphological Diversity  
The dominance of only a few rice varieties in As ian rice production poses a major threat to 
the genetic diversity of the plant. Many landrac es are preserved in seed banks, but these are 
not accessible to the farmers. Furthermore, this kind of conservation does not allow the rice 
varieties to adapt to changing environmental se ttings and changing agricu ltural practices. In 
contrast, on-farm conservation of  diverse rice landraces is dynamic, i.e. the varieties are 
subjected to continuous selecti on by the farmers and are thus allowed to develop and evolve. 
Local rice varieties should  therefore be seen as the products of  careful selection rather than an 
unchanging embodiment of ancient germplasm.  Consequently, ensuring genetic diversity 
requires that rice landraces are cu ltivated continuously, and not simply stored in seed banks.  
While most high yielding varieties in Asia ar e colorless with long and slender grains, local 
rice varieties often ex hibit tremendous morphological divers ity. The color of the outer layer 
(pericarp ) can range from black/purple to red and br ownish or colorless. In a study on upland 
rice in Aklan/Philippines2, the grain weight - as  characterized by the thousand kernel weight - 
varied between 8 and 27 grams, the small gr ain varieties being the most popular ones. HYVs 
from the same province varied on ly between 17 and 24 grams. In fact, more than 30 out of 51 
identified landraces cultivated in the area we re popular short grain varieties (grain length 
<5.5mm). Differences in the quant ity of the fibrous hull, which encloses the rice grain and is 
useless in human as well as  in animal diets, were al so pronounced between upland rice 
varieties. Hull proportion ranged from 20 to 28 percent for most vari eties, but some had 

 4
values below 20 percent. Such varieties are adva ntageous because they have a higher net grain 
yield.  
Disease Resistance  
Genetic diversity is known to substantially decrea se a crop’s vulnerability  to diseases. A large 
scale experiment carried out in  the Yunnan Province of China4 demonstrated how 
diversification of rice varieties was able to si gnificantly reduce rice blast infestation. The rice 
blast disease, one of the major diseases in Asian rice production, is caused by a fungus, which 
exist as a combination of pathogenic races. Therefore rice resistance genes often remain 
effective only for a few years of agricultu ral production, before succumbing to new 
pathogenic races. In the above-mentioned expe riment, however, diversification was so 
successful as a pest management strategy that  farmers were able to abandon the use of 
fungicides after two years. Subsequently th e ‘Yunnan diversification program’ expanded to 
more than 40 000 hectares of rice land. Co rresponding experiences were observed in the 
Province of Aklan in the Philippines2, where more than 50 rice land races are cultiv ated in two 
upland municipalities. Farmers in those areas report that they do not face any rice pest 
infestation except for rats and birds.  
Cultural and Market Value  
Rice is not only the dominant staple food, but also an integral part of ru ral culture in Asia. It 
can therefore be attributed a cultural value, which is the most evident in areas that still 
maintain a large diversity of rice varieties. In  the Province of Aklan in  the Philippines farmers 
traditionally serve particular rice varieties for certain occasions. The most highly valued 
varieties are reserved for festivals and marriages, or offered to distinguished visitors. Some varieties are used for the prep aration of sweet snacks, while others deliver relatively high 
yields and are rather used as an every-day f ood. The varieties’ names in the local language 
often reflect the rice’s appearance (e.g. Bihud means caviar), smell ( Manum balay means that 

 5
it  can be smelled by the neighbor), or agronomic traits (e.g. Kabiray means that it produces 
many tillers). Many varieties are characterized by a very specific taste, and seeds of different 
varieties are exchanged among neighbors and relati ves or given as presents. Considering these 
aspects, loss of biodiversity also  implies a fading rural culture.  
The high status of landraces and their superior quality is also reflected in a higher market 
value, which can make their cultivation economically attractive. In the Province of 
Aklan/Philippines, the Catholic Church initia ted a marketing campaign for landraces in the 
1990s. Local rice varieties have since then been sold as ‘food for the royals’ in the local 
markets, which has caused the price level to soar to three times that of ordinary HYVs of rice. 
The demand for local rice is so high that certain varieties can often only be obtained by ordering in advance directly from the farmers.  
Grain and Straw Quality 
Another aspect that makes rice landraces attractive is the high quality of the grain. This refers to the palatability, the texture, and particular ly the nutritional value, which will be discussed 
extensively in the following sections. Moreover, th e quality of the rice stra w as an animal feed 
may gain increasing importance in the future due to the aggravating scarcity of feed resources. Rice straw is suitable as a feed for ruminants such as cows or water buffaloes, which in turn 
are used in food production or serve as draught  animals. On the one hand, landraces deliver 
relatively more straw than high yielding varieties. On the other hand, their straw tends to have 
higher crude protein content (own unpublished da ta), which is often the most important 
limiting factor in ruminant nutrition in tropical countries.

Brown Rice or Milled Rice?  
The rice grain consists of the starchy endosperm, the bran including th e embryo and the outer 
grain layers, and the inedible fibrous hull (see Fig.  1). The endosperm, i.e. the inner part of the 
grain, contains mostly starch and around 6 to10 percent protein. The bran is more diverse in 
its composition and contains protei n, lipids, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The major vitamins 
present in the rice bran are vitamin E ( α-tocopherol) and the B-vitami ns (thiamin, riboflavin, 
and niacin). The mineral fraction is main ly composed of phosphorus, potassium, and 
magnesium.  
The mechanical processing of the rice grain usua lly comprises two steps: first, the hull is 
removed from the grain to obtain brown rice , which is the least processed edible form of rice. 
Nowadays, the rice grain is usually further pr ocessed by additionally removing the bran layer 
from the endosperm to obtain milled rice . This is done in commercial milling due to the 
consumers’ preferences and because the bran  contains up to 20 percent lipids, making it 
susceptible to rancidity. The predominant form  of rice found on today’s markets is therefore 
milled rice. The bran fraction of higher nutritional va lue is for the most part used as an animal 
feed. This implies not only the loss of a nutritionally valuable rice component in human diets, 
but also a reduction of the quantity of rice available for human nutrition by around 10 to 15 
percent. In Asia, the large-scale adoption of the rice milling technology was accompanied by 
the spread of vitamin B-deficiency ( beriberi ), due to a loss of vitami ns through disposal of the 
rice bran.  
In certain upland areas where rice landraces are grown, farmers process their rice manually and remove only the fibrous hull. Rice is then consumed as ‘brown rice’, i.e. including the 
bran layer. Rancidity of the rice oil in the outer layers of the grain is prevented by removing 
the hull just shortly prior to consumption. Rice is thus protected from oxidation and can be 
stored for up to one year without perishing.

 8
Are rice landraces ‘healthier’ than high yielding varieties? 
The nutritional value of rice depends on many factors, and due to the ab undant biodiversity of 
local varieties, one can surely not generalize on the ‘nutritional value of landraces’. Rather, 
the immense diversity encompasses many desirable properties, which are present in the large 
assortment of rice varieties. Such favorable prope rties are discussed in the subsequent sections 
regarding the individual nutritional components. 
Carbohydrates 
Rice is mostly considered a starchy staple food, which provides a large portion (sometimes up to 90 percent in Asia) of dietary energy. Brown rice contains about 75-85 percent 
carbohydrates, and milled rice even around 90 per cent. Starch properti es are therefore an 
important factor determining the grain quality. Starch can differ widely in its composition, i.e. the proportion of the two starchy fractions: amylose  consists of linearly linked glucose 
molecules and amylopectine  is composed of glucose mol ecules with branched links. The 
starch of so-called waxy rice varieties consist of amylopectine only. These varieties absorb 
less water upon cooking and have a sticky texture. On the other hand, rice varieties with an 
amylose content of more than 25 percent absorb  more water and have a fluffy texture after 
cooking.  
Rice starch is usually digested quite rapidly, compared to other starch foods such as noodles, 
sweet potato, or cassava. This leads to a prompt and pronounced increase of the blood glucose 
level (= high glycemic index) after the ingestion of rice, similar to that of white bread or pure 
glucose. Rapid starch digestion is regarded as unfavorable, because, in the long term, it can 
induce type II diabetes (i.e. non-insulin depe ndent diabetes) in ad ults. Moreover, fast 
digestion can cause a sensation of hunger only shortly after the inges tion of rice, and the 
energy released is quickly used. 

 9
Farmers cultivating rice landraces in the Philippines report a relatively long feeling of 
satiation after the ingestion of cer tain varieties. On the one hand, this might be due to the fact 
that they eat brown rice instead of milled rice, and thus more than just starch. On the other 
hand, it can be attributed to th e relatively slow starch digestibil ity of certain rice varieties. 
Fairly slow starch digestion (=  a low glycemic index) was de monstrated for certain landraces 
from Aklan/Philippines5. This can partly be explained by th eir starch composition, i.e. high 
proportion of amylose. However, other factors, which may be specific to certain varieties, 
such as the physiochemical starch structure or the size of the st arch granules, al so contribute 
to delayed starch digestion. Sl owly digestible varieties might be useful in the prevention or 
treatment of type II diabetes. Other varieties, especially waxy ones were digested very rapidly 
in the study cited. Such waxy varieties are mostly used for th e preparation of sweet snacks, 
which means that they are cooked and then co oled down before consumption. Cooling after 
cooking such varieties has been shown to substantially slow down starch digestion due to 
physiochemical changes in the starch structure ( retrogradation)5.  
Protein 
Rice is mainly a carbohydrate staple food, but because animal products can be scarce or expensive in developing countries, it is often the most important source of prot ein in people’s 
diet as well. Rice protein is of very high qua lity as compared to other food crops. Protein 
quality is determined by the amino acid composition and by its digestibil ity. Certain essential 
amino acids such as lysine (the first limiting amino acid), whic h are particularly important for 
the growth of children, are of ten scarce in plant foods, while being more abundant in animal 
protein. However, rice has a relatively fa vorable amino acid composition with a high 
proportion of lysine and a high pr otein digestibility. This make s rice a reasonably good source 
of protein in diets with limited animal prot ein availability. Brown rice not only has a higher 
protein content, but also a higher pr oportion of lysine than milled rice. 

 10
The average protein content of a HYV of rice av ailable on the market is around seven percent. 
For high yielding IRRI varieties in the Philippines protein content ranges from six to ten 
percent6. Conversely, rice landraces from the Philip pines exhibited protein contents of up to 
fourteen percent2, double the amount of an ordinary high yielding variety. The highest values 
reported in scientific literature reach up to 16 percent of protein7 (for a Chinese fragrant long-
grain rice). 
The human daily protein requirement is estimated at 0.8-1.2 grams per kilogram bodyweight, 
depending on age. The requirement is the highest for children and declines with advancing 
age. A moderate daily intake of 200 grams of an average HYV of rice (with seven percent 
protein) per day contributes ar ound fourteen grams of protei n. Consumption of the same 
amount of a high protein landrace (with fourteen  percent protein) c ontributes 28 grams of 
protein to the daily ration. Ba sed on these values, an averag e adult can cover only around one 
fourth of the daily protein allowance with an ordinary HYV, as opposed to half of the dietary 
requirement with a high protein variety. With elevated consum ption of high protein landraces 
it is even possible to fully cover the recommended daily protein allowance.  
The grain protein content of rice is responsive to nitrogen fertilization, because nitrogen is 
required for the protein synthesis. Landraces tend to have high protein content although they are often cultivated without the use of fertilizer. It is therefore concei vable that the protein 
content of landraces can be further increased by the modera te application of nitrogen 
fertilizer.  
Oil and essential fatty acids 
The potential of rice to cont ribute to the supply of essen tial dietary lipids is generally 
underestimated. This may be due to the fact that  the predominant form of rice available on the 
market is milled rice, containing only negligible amounts of lipids. Almost all of the rice’s oil 
content is located in the outer layers of the grain, which are removed during milling.  

 11
Rice lipids, commonly denoted as oil (‘rice bran oil’) due to its liquid character at room 
temperature, are characterized by a high nutritiona l value. The liquid consistency of the oil is 
caused by the high proportion of unsaturated fa tty acids, accounting for up to 80 percent. 
Because of its high level of unsaturation, rice  bran oil is known to have blood cholesterol 
lowering effects. The major unsaturated fatty  acids in rice oil ar e oleic acid (a mono-
unsaturated acid) and linoleic acid (an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid). Such essential 
fatty acids cannot be synthesized  in the human body and therefore have to be ingested with 
food. They play an important role in many physiological pro cesses, including cell membrane 
function and the development and fu nctioning of the nervous system.  
A study on Philippine rice landraces2 demonstrated that the average lipid content was 
significantly higher than that of  the HYVs collected from the sa me area. While for all of the 
HYVs (brown rice) lipid content ranged between 2.0 and 2.1 percent, the average value for 
the landraces was 2.3 percent, w ith individual vari eties reaching up to 3.2 percent. Of the total 
lipid content, certain varieties contained mo re than 80 percent unsaturated fatty acids. 
Linoleic acid, which is an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid, accounted for 30 percent of the 
lipid fraction on average. Some landrace varietie s had a linoleic acid content of almost one 
percent of the total grain. Ingesting 200g of such a variet y would thus supply around two 
grams of essential linoleic acid, which is a pproximately half of the daily requirement.  
β-Carotene and Other Carotenoids 
β-Carotene is a type of carotenoid, which is one of the most important classes of plant 
pigments. In the plant tissue, carotenoids function primarily as au xiliary pigments in 
photosynthetic processes and act as antioxidants against oxidative damage. In the human diet 
some of the carotenoids act as vitamin A precursor s as they can be converted in the intestinal 
tract. 

 12
β-Carotene is by far the most effective vitamin A precursor of all carote noids and can play an 
important role in diets lacking animal products. Vitamin A itself is abundant in meat, fish, 
milk, and liver, but is not found in plant foods at  all. As animal products are usually expensive 
or scarce in developing countries, plant based β-carotene, functioning as a vitamin A 
precursor, can account for more than 80 percent of the vitamin A supply8 . 
The stepwise conversion of β-carotene into vitamin A first comprises its absorption into the 
intestinal cells, followed by an enzyme-mediated chemical transformation. The absorption rate of β -carotene into the intestinal cells is around 20 to 50 percent and decreases with 
increasing ingestion. It additi onally requires the presence of a sufficient quantity and quality 
of lipids in the diet
9. The enzymatic reactions necessary for the conversion of β-carotene into 
vitamin A also require the presence of lipids, especially unsaturated fatty acids10. The 
absorption and transformation of β-carotene implies some losses: between six and twelve 
units of β -carotene yield one unit of vitamin A. After synthesis in the intestinal cells, vitamin 
A is finally transported to the liver for storage. 
Some plant foods containing abundant β-carotene are green leafy ve getables, squash, or palm 
oil. Rice is usually a very poor source of prov itamin A. While the endo sperm is virtually free 
of carotenoids, some traces may be present in the bran fracti on. Higher levels of β-carotene 
are only found in pigmented, i.e. colored rice vari eties. Such colored rice varieties, especially 
red and black sorts, are only cultivated in ar eas that maintain a high diversity of rice 
genotypes.  
A study on Philippine upland rice varieties2  found distinguished differences in β -carotene 
content depending on the grain color. The highest average content was found in black varieties, with values reaching up to 0.13 mg/kg (brown rice). Conversely, much lower 
concentrations were found in red varieties, while β-carotene was hardly de tectable at all in 
colorless varieties. Similar results were obtained in another survey including varieties from 
Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand
11. The highest concentration was detected in a black variety 

 13
from Malaysia with 0.22 mg /kg. Further analyses of β-carotene concentrations (own 
unpublished data) revealed values of up to 0.38 mg/kg in a black/purple landrace rice from the 
Philippines.  
It is interesting to compare these values to those of bioengineered varieties. The genetically 
engineered rice varieties know as Golden Rice  have been modified to contain β-carotene in 
the endosperm, which is usually completely devoi d of caroteneoids. Vari ous recent scientific 
publications12, 13, 14 report total carotenoid le vels of 0.3 to 1.6 mg/ kg for such bioengineered 
varieties. However, more precise figures on the β-carotene fraction of the carotenoids, which 
actually has vitamin A precursor function, are not given in these article s. Considering that 
only a certain portion of these carotenoids is actually β-carotene, one can assume that the β-
carotene content of un-milled black varieties is similar to that of Golden Rice varieties.  
Seeing that the absorption and conversion of β-carotene requires the presence of dietary 
lipids, the oil content of rice varieties contai ning carotenoids is also  an important aspect. 
Analysis of a set of 54 Asian rice landrac es revealed a close correlation between the β -
carotene content and the lipid content11. In other words, varieties containing an elevated level 
of β-carotene (especially black/pur ple varieties) likewise had a high lipid content. This 
interrelation might occur naturally due to enhanc ed storage of the carotenoids – which are fat-
soluble - in the grain. From a nutritional point of view this interrelationship is a very favorable 
one, because it ensures the supply of the necessa ry lipids (especially un saturated fatty acids) 
necessary for the transformation of β-carotene into vitamin A. It can therefore be assumed that 
the efficiency of black rice β-carotene as a vitamin A precursor is high.  
Apart from β-carotene, black and purple varieties fr om Malaysia were also found to have 
elevated concentrations of other carotenoids, especially lutein. Two samples were identified 
that had lutein contents of 1.6 and 2.4 mg/kg, respectively (own unpublished data). Lutein 
does not have any function as a vitamin A precursor. However, it  is a principal component of 
the eye’s macular pigment. The macula is a part of the retina that is responsible for detailed 

 14
and central vision (e.g for reading). Elevated i ngestion of lutein results in a high macula 
pigment density and may lead to delayed age related macular degeneration.  
Iron 
Iron deficiency anemia is considered to be  one of the most wide-spread micronutrient 
disorders in the world. Some estimates say that around half of the world’s population is 
deficient in dietary iron supply. Iron is the main ingredient in hemoglobin, which is found in 
red blood cells and is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body . Symptoms of iron 
deficiency include a lack of en ergy, fatigue, pale skin, brittle and white fingernails, brittle 
hair, etc.  
As with vitamins, minerals are chiefly located in  the bran of the rice grain. Therefore, rice can 
only contribute significantly to the iron supply if  it is eaten as brown rice. Analysis of a 
number of rice samples grown unde r greenhouse conditions at the International Rice Research 
Institute (IRRI) showed that loca l varieties had an iron content up to 2.5 times higher than that 
of the common high yielding varieties7. In contrast to landraces, the most commonly grown 
HYVs were at the lowest end of the scale wi th an average iron content of around 10 mg/kg. 
The highest value cited in that same study was 26 mg/kg for a landrace. A different set of 
landraces from various Southeast Asian countri es (own unpublished data) demonstrated iron 
contents of up to 33 mg/kg. Generally, iron content tends to be higher in aromatic and colored 
(red and black) rice vari eties than in colorless varieties and ordinary HYVs15. The highest 
value published is for a Chinese red long-grain variety, which reportedly had a content of 64 mg/kg
7.  
Increasing the iron content in rice has also been  an objective of geneti c engineering in recent 
years. By transferring a soybean gene into  rice, an iron level of 13-38 mg/kg has been 
achieved in brown rice16. That level is higher than in th e non-manipulated control varieties 
used in those experiments, but it is not higher than the iron levels found in certain landraces.  

 15
The bioavailability of ingested iron depends ve ry much on the intake level and is higher in 
iron deficient diets. It also depends on the pr esence of other nutrients such as vitamin C. 
Furthermore, iron absorption can be  improved by elevated amounts of β-carotene or vitamin 
A in the diet17. On the other hand inhibitory substances  present in the grai n, such as phytic 
acid or polyphenols can reduce the iron bioavail ability. Depending on the presence of either 
inhibitory or adjuvant substances the iron av ailability may vary greatly. However, little 
research has been done on this aspect so fa r. Assuming a realistic absorption capacity of 
around 10 percent, 200g of unmilled high-iron rice (with an iron content of around 30 mg/kg) 
could contribute up to half of  the daily iron requirement.  
Zinc 
Zinc is believed to be  low in the diets of ar ound 2.5 billion people worldw ide. It is involved in 
many enzymatic reactions in the body and is also essential for DNA synthesis. The requirement of zinc is incr eased during pregnancy as we ll as throughout childhood and 
adolescence. The clinical manifestations in seve re cases of zinc deficiency include diarrhea, 
weight loss, infections, and it is fatal if untre ated. A moderate zinc deficiency of zinc is 
characterized by growth retard ation and delayed puberty in adolescents, poor appetite, 
delayed wound healing, etc.  
As with iron, most of the zinc present in th e rice grain is located in the outer layers. The 
consumer’s preference for milled rice therefore substantially reduces the availability of zinc. Conversely, brown rice can contribute appreciable amounts of zinc to the diet. The variability 
in zinc content among different rice varieties is qu ite pronounced. Values ranging from 14 to 
59 mg/kg are given in scientific literature
7, 15. As with iron, zinc conc entration is substantially 
higher in certain landraces than in commonly grown high yielding varieties. Furthermore, 
varieties that are high in iron content are ofte n also high in zinc. A set of landraces form 
Southeast Asia (own unpublished data) exhibited an average zinc content of 41mg/kg with 

 16
values reaching up to 57 mg/kg. Similarly to iron, the zinc c ontent tends to be higher in 
aromatic and colored rice varieties.  
A major concern related to cerea l-based diets is the low bioava ilability of zinc due to the 
presence of a high level of phytic acid, whic h inhibits zinc absorp tion. Therefore, the 
screening for rice varieties that have elevated  zinc content while simultaneously containing 
low levels of phytic acid merits  further scientific study.  
Antioxidants 
The bran fraction of certain rice varieties - especi ally pigmented (i.e. colo red) ones - is rich in 
antioxidant compounds. Antioxidants comprise  polyphenols, carotenoids, vitamin E (= α -
tocopherol) and tocotrienols (compounds chemica lly similar to vitamin E). Antioxidants have 
various beneficial effects in the human body, especially the se questration of aggressive and 
carcinogenic molecules, the so-called free radi cals. They thus prot ect the body tissue and 
especially the DNA from oxidative damage.  
A feeding experiment18, 19 found that rabbits fed with red and black rice varieties (or only their 
bran) had an improved antioxidant status in th eir blood and decreased atherosclerotic plaque 
formation. The authors of the study could not relate these effects to a certain constituent, but 
suggested selenium, flavonoids (polyphenolic substances), or tocotrienols as possible 
candidates. They concluded that black a nd red rice can help in the prevention of 
arthrosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases in humans due to the presence of antioxidants. A 
different study using mice as experimental animals20 came to similar results. That study 
identified a novel tocotrienol in rice bran which provides  an approach to promoting 
cardiovascular health. The study concluded that such tocotrienols can prevent or reverse blood clots and lesions that may lead to diseases su ch as myocardial infarc tion, stroke, or other 
blood system thromboses.  

 17
The function and the phys iological effects of various anti oxidant substances are not fully 
understood and represent an innovative research fi eld. The diversity of rice varieties offers 
tremendous scope for scientists to further investigate the pot ential for the synthesis of 
antioxidants and their possible beneficial effects.  
Conclusion 
The immense genetic diversity in rice landraces is similarly reflected by their multiplicity of 
nutritional characteristics. Appropr iate rice varieties exist for enhancing the supply of various 
nutrients, including protein, esse ntial lipids, certain minerals, and to some extent also β -
carotene. Some varieties may even be characterized by a combination of favorable nutritional traits. This is true for varieties containing elevated levels of both β-carotene and essential 
lipids, for example. More synergies between nut ritional components may exist and have to be 
elucidated in further scientific work.  
The diversity of such favorable nutritional charac teristics is not represented in the most wide-
spread HYVs currently prevailing in Asian ri ce cultivation. These have been developed 
mainly to optimize the quantitative yields, and not the nutritional value. The high nutritional 
quality of rice landraces can form a solid basis for changing priorities in rice breeding, putting 
more emphasis on the grain nutritional value. Modern conventional breeding techniques, 
including molecular marker-assisted selection, may be very useful in accelerating the 
development of more nutritious rice variet ies. Combining high yields and high grain 
nutritional value thus appears to be possi ble without any genetic manipulation.  
The current prevalence of milled rice on the mark et reduces the rice’s nutritional value and 
essentially turns it into a simple carbohydrate food.  Therefore, in addition to developing more 
nutritious varieties, awareness of the benefits of eating brow n rice should be raised among 
rice consumers. Such a combined approach would ultimately result in a sustainable enhancement of the essential nutri ent supply in rice-based diets.
