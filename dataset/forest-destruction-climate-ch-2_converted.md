Forests are vital to life on earth. They are the richest of all
ecosystems - covering only eight per cent of the planet1
and are home to two thirds of all known species of terrestrial
plants and animals2.  Millions of people rely directly on forests
for food, water, medicines and other basic materials.
For these forest peoples the forest defines their culture and
way of life. Within developing countries, one billion of the
world's poorest people depend upon forests for part of their
livelihoods, and as many as 350 million people living in and
around forests are heavily dependent on forests for their
livelihoods and security3.

Forests are also important in helping regulate global climate
and weather patterns, critical environmental systems that
support life on Earth.

Much of the world's original forests have either been severely
degraded or have disappeared completely. We are destroying
forests at an unprecedented rate, with an area of forest the
size of a football pitch cut down every two seconds. Half of
the forests lost in the last 10,000 years have met their end in
the last 80 years and most of that destruction took place in
the last 30 years4.

This is driving major biodiversity loss on earth as well as
destroying the livelihoods of many millions of forest dependent
peoples.  The current extinction rate of plant and animal
species is approximately 1,000 times faster than it was in pre-
human times5.  Scientists claim that the Earth is in the sixth
major extinction event6 and that extinction rates will further
increase ten fold by the year 20507.

The forests and climate change

About one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions are
caused by deforestation, mainly from tropical forests8.
This excludes emissions arising from forest degradation
from activities such as industrial selective logging, both
legal and illegal.

Forests and their soils are huge carbon stores - more so than
any other land-based ecosystem. According to FAO studies9,
they store nearly three hundred billion tonnes equivalent to 40
times the amount currently emitted to the atmosphere every
year through the burning of fossil fuels and the production of
cement10.

According to recent estimates, Indonesia is the world's third
largest greenhouse gas emitter behind only China and the
USA11.   Indonesia's high level of emissions is a consequence
of the staggering rate at which its forests are being cleared -
amounting to almost 2 million hectares per year12 - and
particularly the destruction of carbon-rich peatland forests.
An estimated two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) are
released each year from the drainage and burning of peatland
forests alone in South East Asia, equivalent to eight per cent
of global emissions from the use of fossil fuels. Fully 90 per
cent of CO2 emissions from peatland forests in South East
Asia comes from Indonesia alone13.

Ancient Forests: the Climate Coolers

The Paradise Forests: Indonesia

The Paradise Forests of Asia Pacific stretch from peninsular
Southeast Asia, through Indonesia, and on to Papua New
Guinea and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific. The Paradise
Forests are home to hundreds of indigenous cultures and
countless plants and animals found nowhere else in the
world.

Indonesia has the largest remaining forest area within the
Paradise Forests, consisting of both large tracts of intact
forests and secondary forest areas. An estimated 88.5 million
hectares of forests remain15.  While this may seem a lot, in
reality almost half of Indonesia's forests have been destroyed
since 1950 when the country's total forest cover was 162
million ha16.

Indonesia is currently losing its forests faster than any other
major forested country17.  Around 51 square kilometres of
forests are destroyed every day, equivalent to over 300
football fields per hour.

Ancient forests play an essential role in regulating the world's
climate and global weather patterns, critical environmental
systems that support life on earth. Today, only 20 per cent
of the world's original forests remain in large, intact forest
landscapes (IFL)14.

Fragmentation through human activities such as industrial
logging, degrades ancient forests and increases their
vulnerability to drought and fires, both of which are expected
to increase in tropical forest regions as a result of climate
change. This creates a vicious cycle and a climate feedback
loop, in which degraded forest becomes increasingly
vulnerable to forest fires, which in turn releases yet more
greenhouse gases, further driving climate change, leading to
more fires and fragmentation.

Preventing climate change from reaching dangerous levels
demands that the rise in average global temperature,
compared to pre-industrial levels, is kept as far below 2
degrees Celsius as possible. To achieve this requires urgent
international action to drastically cut greenhouse gas
emissions from two major sources: burning of fossil fuels for
energy and deforestation. These sources account for about
two-thirds and one-fifth of emissions to the atmosphere
respectively.

Greenpeace is promoting an energy revolution requiring
countries to invest in renewable energy and improving energy
efficiency. Greenpeace is also seeking a strong commitment
to halt forest destruction worldwide and to have these goals
enshrined in an international agreement which is binding on
governments.

Drivers of forest destruction in Indonesia

A staggering 72 percent of Indonesia's intact forest
landscapes (IFL) have either disappeared or been severely
degraded from decades of industrial and illegal logging18.

The once mighty forests of Borneo and Kalimantan have fallen
victim to unscrupulous logging companies and timber barons,
with large tracts of intact forests only existing in mountainous
and less accessible areas. Only the Indonesian provinces of
Papua and Papua Barat, on the Western side of the Island of
New Guinea, hold extensive areas of large intact forests19.
But these too are coming under increased pressure as the
loggers move to new forests and from the growing threat from
the booming palm oil industry.

The World Bank estimates that up to 80 per cent of logging in
Indonesia is illegal,  but even without the problems of illegal20
logging, the logging effort in Indonesia is currently
unsustainable.  In 2006, a total of 29 million hectares of
Indonesia's forests had been earmarked for logging
concessions, with a further 10 million earmarked for total
conversion into timber plantations21.

One of the growing new threats to Indonesia's forests is the
'gold rush' for developing oil palm plantations, driven by the
increasing global demand for palm oil for food, use in the
cosmetics industry and the emerging demand for so-called
green biofuels.

The area of land under oil palm plantation in Indonesia has
almost tripled in the ten years between 1995 and 2005 with a
nearly ten-fold increase in the past 20 years22.  Close to six
million hectares of oil palm plantations have already been
developed and millions more are planned. The Ministry of
Energy plans to develop four million hectares by 2015,
alongside an additional three million hectares for Jatropha
plantations for the use in biofuel alone23.  According to
research conducted by a coalition of Indonesian NGOs in
2005, provincial and district governments have plans for 20
million hectares of oil palm plantation development24.

Palm Oil expansion into peatlands:
A global climate killer

The conversion of forests into plantations not only destroys
valuable forests, but is also the leading contributor to
Indonesia's massive greenhouse gas emissions.  One of the
key reasons for this is the destruction of peatland forests in
Kalimantan and Sumatra, especially for palm oil production.

Tropical peatlands have been created over tens of thousands
of years under peat swamp forests.  As these forests die they
form large peat mounds, rich in the accumulated carbon of
generations of trees. Indonesia has 22.5 million hectares of
peat soils, which is 12 per cent of Indonesia's land area and
83 per cent of South-east Asian peatlands25. It is estimated
that Southeast Asia's peat soils store 42 billion tonnes of
carbon26.

In order to prepare peatlands for agricultural use, companies
start by digging canals through an area to drain the peatlands
of water and remove the valuable timber.  Once drained, peat
mounds collapse in on themselves and become dry and
highly flammable.  When the carbon in the soil is exposed to
oxygen, it oxidises and releases its carbon to the atmosphere.
Even when not burnt, each hectare of drained peatland
releases about 100 tonnes of CO2 each year. The release of
CO2 occurs quickly if fire is used to clear the remaining forest.
It is the drainage and clearing of the peatland  drives
greenhouse gas emissions, the use of fire merely speeds up
the process.

Despite this there are plans to continue to expand oil palm
production in these areas. A report of the Indonesian Forest
Ministry and the European Union states:

“The world demand for palm oil is forecast to increase from its
present 20.2 million tonnes a year to 40 million tonnes in
2020. If this demand is to be met, 300.000 ha of new estates
will need to be planted in each of the next 20 years. We
predict that by far the largest slice of this new land will come
from within Indonesia where labour and land remain plentiful.
And we expect that Sumatra, with its relatively well-developed
infrastructure and nucleus of skilled labour, will absorb 1.6
million hectares of this expansion. It is inevitable that most
new oil palm will be in the wetlands, as the more 'desirable'
dry lands of the island are now occupied.”

Many community members who have agreed to give up their
land to a company and to receive their few hectares of oil
palm plantation to manage themselves, end up in a debt trap
cycle to the company that is impossible to break out of31.

What must happen?

The forests of Indonesia are under siege from deforestation
for oil palm expansion, timber plantations and also from illegal
and destructive logging, degrading forests and often a
precursor to deforestation.  This is driving climate change and
causing Indonesia to be one of the largest global greenhouse
gas polluters on the planet.

Indonesia is hosting the next Conference of the Parties to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
which will be held in Bali in December 2007.

In the run up to this meeting Greenpeace wants the
Indonesian government to immediately introduce a
moratorium on further destruction of peatlands, to implement
an effective action plan against forest fires and to support a
reduced deforestation scheme in the Papuan provinces.

Greenpeace is calling on the Indonesian Government to
implement a moratorium on deforestation and industrial
logging in order to review its forest laws, address its poor
record of governance and law enforcement and to implement
an environmentally- responsible and socially-just land-use
planning system.

Approximately 14 per cent of Indonesia peatlands are under
oil palm plantations, another 10 per cent are under timber
plantations.  This does not take into account state-owned,
cooperative or other agricultural developments.
Approximately 12 per cent of Indonesia's peatlands are under
logging concessions27.

This is already a staggering level of peatland destruction and
to prevent further conversion of peatlands urgent action is
needed.

The Social Impacts of Oil Palm Expansion

Palm oil expansion in Indonesia is not only wreaking havoc on
forests and peatlands, but in many cases it is also pushing
indigenous and local communities off their land. In some
cases, communities become trapped in a vicious cycle of
debt, working their own land that has been converted to palm
oil.

Land on which palm oil companies wish to establish
plantations is often subject to existing claims by indigenous
and local communities. Companies are required by law to
conduct a process of consulting communities and gaining
their consent to forego their rights to the land, for which they
must be compensated. However, communities are often
cheated out of their land and promises of compensation, and
the building of schools and medical clinics, are often not
fulfilled.

The Indonesian-based NGO Sawit Watch has documented
numerous cases of communities having been deceived by
palm oil companies and dispossessed of their land and their
rights29.

Efforts to swindle local communities out of their land rights
include intimidation and outright cheating. Companies have
used the attendance lists at consultation or 'socialisation'
meetings as 'evidence' to show that communities agreed to
sign over their land use rights.

Communities have also lost their forests because the land has
simply been bulldozed and cleared, either through bulldozer
drivers misinterpreting maps or through the use of incorrect
maps30.
