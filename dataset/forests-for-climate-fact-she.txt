FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaattee  is designed to become a crucial part of the
second phase of the Kyoto Pr otocol agr
eements on climate change
in 2012. Because the climate emergency requires urgent action,
countries that commit to Forests for Climate could make fundingavailable to protect forests as early as 2009. 
Industrialised nations would be able to meet a proportion of their
overall emissions reduction targets through the purchase of cost-effective “tropical deforestation units.” This “tropical deforestationcommitment” would be additional to deeper cuts in their domestic
energy and industrial emissions. A minimum mandatory commitment would ensure a steady andsignificant stream of funds. The billions raised would then be used to help developing countries protect their tropical forests. 
FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaattee  recognises that carbon markets are important
tools in climate pr otection. The cheaper tr
opical deforestation units
would therefore not be directly exchangeable in the markets. This
avoids the risk of them bringing down the price of carbon, andreducing incentives to invest in clean and renewable energytechnologies.
The World is Waiting: 
Developing countries around the world are asking for funding to help
stop the destruction of tropical forests. What’s been missing is aninternationally agreed plan to help these countries protect their forests.
Forests for Climate is that plan.For more information on FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaatteeplease contact:

Tackling tropical deforestation would save an
incredible one-fifth of global greenhouse gasemissions, and give our planet a fightingchance against dangerous climate change. 
FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaattee  would be able to
provide funds to the gr
eatest number of
countries with tropical forests. Tailored
funding programmes, with varying reportingstandards, would allow FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaattee
to apply to nations as diverse as Brazil, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, andIndonesia. 
Countries that are able to mor
e reliably and
accurately report on their emission
reductions would receive a higher rate ofreturn on funding. This provides a strongincentive for developing countries tocontinually improve their forest protectionprogrammes. 
By ensuring that tropical forest countries take
on national commitments, FFoorreessttss  ffoorr
CClliimmaattee  protects against “leakage”- forest
destruction moving fr om one ar
ea of a
country to another. Because so many
countries can participate in FFoorreessttss  ffoorr
CClliimmaattee, it protects against leakage across
international bor
ders. Win for Biodiversity
Tropical forests are essential to life itself; they
keep climate in check, regulate water flow,and maintain the healthy ecosystems onwhich humanity depends. Orangutans,elephants, tigers, and jaguars all make theirhomes in tropical forests which contain halfof all life on earth. 
Protection of biodiversity lies at the core of
Forests for Climate. The proposalprioritises protection of intact and otherimportant natural forests, such as peatlandforests. These store significant amounts ofcarbon, and are much more likely to copewith the impacts of climate change.Win for Indigenous Peoples
Up to 150 million indigenous people live inancient forests worldwide. All too often theyhave been sidelined or subject to humanrights abuses by those intruding in theirforests.
Indigenous peoples need to have their
futures secured so they can remainguardians of the forest. Forests for Climatewould fully recognise and respect their rights, and directly engage local peoples in the development and implementation ofthis process.
