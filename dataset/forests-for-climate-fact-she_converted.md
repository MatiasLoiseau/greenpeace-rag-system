Protecting the world’s remaining tropical forests is a key part
of the solution to tackling the climate crisis. Tropical forests,
the “lungs of the earth” are giant carbon stores. When they
are destroyed through logging or burning, this carbon is
released into the atmosphere.

Tropical deforestation is responsible for about 20% of global
greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire international
transport sector. Forest destruction in Indonesia and Brazil
make these countries the third and fourth highest emitters of
greenhouse gas emissions in the world.

Greenpeace has the solution. Forests for Climate is a
landmark proposal for an international funding mechanism to
protect tropical forests. It is estimated that halving emissions
from deforestation will cost US$10-15 billion per year. Forests
for Climate has the potential to raise these funds, and more.

If countries commit to Forests for Climate, we can achieve
win-win-win benefits for climate, biodiversity, and local
communities and forest peoples.

FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaattee  offers the solution.
Now we need the political will to make it a reality.

How Forests for Climate works

FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaattee  is designed to become a crucial part of the
second phase of the Kyoto Protocol agreements on climate change
in 2012. Because the climate emergency requires urgent action,
countries that commit to Forests for Climate could make funding
available to protect forests as early as 2009.

Industrialised nations would be able to meet a proportion of their
overall emissions reduction targets through the purchase of cost-
effective “tropical deforestation units.” This “tropical deforestation
commitment” would be additional to deeper cuts in their domestic
energy and industrial emissions.

A minimum mandatory commitment would ensure a steady and
significant stream of funds. The billions raised would then be used
to help developing countries protect their tropical forests.

FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaattee  recognises that carbon markets are important
tools in climate protection. The cheaper tropical deforestation units
would therefore not be directly exchangeable in the markets. This
avoids the risk of them bringing down the price of carbon, and
reducing incentives to invest in clean and renewable energy
technologies.

Tackling tropical deforestation would save an
incredible one-fifth of global greenhouse gas
emissions, and give our planet a fighting
chance against dangerous climate change.

FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaattee  would be able to
provide funds to the greatest number of
countries with tropical forests. Tailored
funding programmes, with varying reporting
standards, would allow FFoorreessttss  ffoorr  CClliimmaattee
to apply to nations as diverse as Brazil, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and
Indonesia.

Countries that are able to more reliably and
accurately report on their emission
reductions would receive a higher rate of
return on funding. This provides a strong
incentive for developing countries to
continually improve their forest protection
programmes.

By ensuring that tropical forest countries take
on national commitments, FFoorreessttss  ffoorr
CClliimmaattee  protects against “leakage”- forest
destruction moving from one area of a
country to another. Because so many
countries can participate in FFoorreessttss  ffoorr
CClliimmaattee, it protects against leakage across
international borders.

Win for Biodiversity
Tropical forests are essential to life itself; they
keep climate in check, regulate water flow,
and maintain the healthy ecosystems on
which humanity depends. Orangutans,
elephants, tigers, and jaguars all make their
homes in tropical forests which contain half
of all life on earth.

Protection of biodiversity lies at the core of
Forests for Climate. The proposal
prioritises protection of intact and other
important natural forests, such as peatland
forests. These store significant amounts of
carbon, and are much more likely to cope
with the impacts of climate change.

Win for Indigenous Peoples
Up to 150 million indigenous people live in
ancient forests worldwide. All too often they
have been sidelined or subject to human
rights abuses by those intruding in their
forests.

Indigenous peoples need to have their
futures secured so they can remain
guardians of the forest. Forests for Climate
would fully recognise and respect their
rights, and directly engage local peoples
in the development and implementation of
this process.

The World is Waiting:
Developing countries around the world are asking for funding to help
stop the destruction of tropical forests. What’s been missing is an
internationally agreed plan to help these countries protect their forests.

Forests for Climate is that plan.
