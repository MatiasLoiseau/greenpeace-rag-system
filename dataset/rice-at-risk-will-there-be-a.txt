GE RICE REPORT |  3introduction
Proponents of genetic engineering argue that
“co-existence” of genetically engineered (GE,sometimes called genetic modified, GM ortransgenic) and non-GE rice is possible.Theyargue that countries, and even neighbouringfarmers, will be able to produce and keepseparate GE rice, non-GE (conventional), andorganic rice for export and/or domesticconsumption. However , there is strong evidencethat co-existence for rice is not possible – GEcontamination will occur .i GE RICE CAN’T BE CONTAINED
Cultivated rice has many wild and weedy relatives with which GE rice can,and will, cross pollinate.The main cultivated rice species,
Oryza sativa ,
cross pollinates (outcrosses) and produces viable offspring with close wildrelatives, notably 
O. rufipogon (Lu et al. 2003). O. rufipogon is thought to
be the ancestor of cultivated rice and is an endangered species in China(Gao 2004). However , it is also regarded as a weed in rice cultivation. Inaddition, weedy strains of O. sativa such as “red rice” occur where O.sativa is cultivated.This includes southern Europe and the USA where it isan important agricultural weed (NAPPO 2003; Messeguer 
et al. 2004).
These wild and weedy relatives grow in close proximity to cultivated rice.Hence, there is a large overlap between the areas of cultivated rice and thewild and/or weedy relatives of rice in many parts of Asia and other ricegrowing areas (Lu 
et al. 2003).
Cultivation of GE rice will cause these wild and weedy relatives to becomecontaminated with the GE transgenes (the GE DNA insert). Numerousstudies now provide a substantial amount of scientific evidence forcultivated rice outcrossing to non-GE rice (e.g., Langevin 
et al. 1990; Lu
et al. 2003; Gealy et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2004; Messeguer et al. 2004;
Song et al. 2002, 2003, 2004; and NAPPO 2003). Cultivated varieties of
rice have been shown to outcross with both wild rice species ( O. rufipogon
and O. nivara ) and weedy rice (mostly O. sativa, or red rice).
Cultivated rice pollen has been recorded at a distance of over 100 metres(Song 
et al. 2004) from the source plants and gene flow (outcrossing) has
been observed at a distance of 43 metres (Song et al. 2003). However , a
separation distance of only 10 meters is required between GE and non-GErice fields in the USA, which is wholly inadequate to prevent GEcontamination. Song 
et al. (2004) suggest an isolation distance of 100 m
between GE and non-GE rice or close wild relatives and suggest that sugarcane may be planted as a buffer to reduce GE pollen dispersal. But, it isunclear how practical or effective these measures would be in areas wherethere are many small-scale producers, where neighbouring rice fields canbe much closer than 100 m. In any case, isolation distances will notprevent GE contamination as there are many other routes forcontamination to occur (see “Other routes of GE contamination” below).

4|  GE RICE REPORTOutcrossing rates of rice are lower than those of maize or canola (oilseed
rape), but they are still significant. Measured outcrossing rates vary from0.04 % (Messeguer 
et al. 2004) between cultivated rice and 0.005-0.01
% for cultivated rice to weedy rice and 1.2-2.2 % to wild rice (Chen et
al.2004). However , the persistence of weedy rice varieties means that
these unwanted populations will become reservoirs for the escaped genesfrom GE rice. Rice seed has varied dormancy, but weedy rice has astronger seed dormancy than cultivated rice (Gu 
et al. 2003), increasing
the potential for weedy rice populations to persist as reservoirs of GEtransgenes that could contaminate future non-GE rice crops. AsMesseguer 
et al. (2004) state: “Although the gene flow values are
relatively low, the shattering and dormancy of the red rice seeds,
which ensure their persistence in the field, lead into an undesirable
effect of durability of the transferred genes.”
Rice outcrossing already causes problems in rice cultivation. Red rice is aproblem weed in many rice-growing regions of the world, contributing toextensive yield losses in some areas. Because of the problems that alreadyexist with red rice, the prospect of herbicide-tolerant red rice is a statedfear for the rice-growing agricultural community (Danley-Greiner 2001).There are concerns that if red rice becomes tolerant to the herbicide usedin conjunction with a GE herbicide-tolerant rice, it will become moredifficult to control, and of course, will make the herbicide-tolerant varietyuseless for farmers (Gealy 
et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2004).
We can conclude with certainty that gene flow from GE rice to non-GErice, wild and weedy relatives will occur .The GE contaminated populationsof wild and weedy species of rice are likely to be persistent, becomingreservoirs of GE transgenes for further contamination.ii TRADITIONAL VARIETIES OF RICE THREATENED BY GE
CONTAMINATION
Traditional varieties of rice in Asia could become contaminated with GEtransgenes if GE rice is grown.Transgene contamination has already beenfound in local traditional varieties of maize in Mexico (Quist and Chapela2001; CEC 2004).
GE maize imported into Mexico from the USA for food is now inadvertently
being grown in Mexico and has resulted in contamination of local traditionalvarieties through outcrossing. Farmers in Mexico traditionally save seed fromone harvest to the next; sowing and seed exchange between farmers iscommon.This is in contrast to the hybrid system where seed is bought eachyear from a seed merchant.The GE contamination in the traditional maizevarieties will be highly difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate. It will persistin these local traditional varieties and can spread by seed exchange or cross-pollination.The tradition of locally bred varieties and seed exchange is verysimilar for rice in parts of Asia.Therefore, just as traditional varieties ofmaize have been contaminated in Mexico, traditional varieties of rice couldbecome contaminated with GE in Asia.
GE contamination of locally bred traditional varieties is a cultural violation.
GE contamination could have adverse effects on biodiversity (for example, ifthe GE contamination is from an insecticidal GE rice, such as 
Btrice).
Importantly, it will remove farmers’ choice to grow non-GE rice by producingwidespread GE contamination.RICE AT RISK :

GE RICE REPORT |  5iii OTHER ROUTES OF GE CONTAMINATION
Cross-pollination (outcrossing) of rice in the field is an important route of
contamination but it is not the only way that non-GE varieties of ricecould become contaminated.The potential for contamination unfortunatelyexists at many points along both the production and distribution chains.
For example:
*
Human error . GE and non-GE rice may become mixed when seed and
plants are transferred, for example during sowing; transplanting;harvesting; moving seed or labelling or storing seed and grain. In seedplots there can be planting errors.
*
Ineffective segregation.The infrastructure requirements for segregation
of GE and non-GE rice are very high, much greater than theinfrastructure currently available in many parts of the world.This lackof segregation capacity can lead to contamination of food supplies andseed stocks.
*
Trucks transporting GE rice can be the source of GE grains that fall on
fields or roadsides during transport and loading.This means that even ifGE rice is not cultivated but only imported, contamination of non-GErice and its wild and weedy relatives could still occur .
*
Many small farmers do not own farm machinery and hire someone with
a machine to do seeding or harvesting for them.The machinery mayoperate on several farms during a day or week. GE seed or a GE ricecrop could contaminate a non-GE rice farm if the machinery is notspecially cleaned in between farms.
*
Farmers often sell their rice through middlemen who gather rice from
several farms together in one truck for transportation to processingplants (mills). If the truck mixes a single crop of GE rice into a non-GEconsignment, it will become contaminated. Similarly, a non-GE riceconsignment may be contaminated if the truck was previously used for aGE consignment and not carefully cleaned.*
In many parts of Asia, farmers will grow multiple crops of rice,sometimes as many as three and a half crops in a year . It means theycontinue to grow rice without a break. Rice seeds that fall in the fieldduring harvesting can germinate during the next cropping cycle. If thefirst crop is GE, but not the next, there is potential for contamination inthe second crop.
GE rice cannot be contained – there are so many routes that can causeGE contamination of non-GE rice.These routes can spread GE ricecontamination over long distances and will affect all types of non-GE rice,including hybrid rice. Even if there were rigorous controls placed on thedistribution, planting and transport of GE rice, GE contamination wouldstill occur because of human error . GE rice contamination would be highlydifficult to eradicate and would probably increase because of thepersistence of populations of wild and weedy relatives, which would alsobecome GE contaminated.
iv PHARMACEUTICAL GE RICE – A SPECIAL THREAT
Some crop plants, including rice, have been genetically engineered toproduce pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals (GE “pharm” crops).Box 1 shows some of the wide variety of compounds that are currentlybeing engineered into rice plants.These pharm crops are not intended to beeaten by humans and animals, but to be used by drug companies or inindustrial processes.The compounds produced by these plants are oftenbiologically active chemicals and all are potentially toxic to animals andhumans.The genetic engineering industry insists that they can producethese compounds by genetically engineering crops such as maize and riceand keep them out of the human and animal food supply. However , manypeople, including scientists, doubt that these pharm crops can be kept outof animal and human food supplies and are concerned about the possibleconsequences (see, for example Anon 2004).

6|  GE RICE REPORTRICE AT RISK :
WILL THERE BE A CHOICE WITH GE RICE ? rice
“Contamination of human foods with plant-made pharmaceuticals
can occur through dispersal of seed or pollen. Wildlife, especially
waterfowl, can transport seed for long distances, as can extreme
weather events such as floods or tornadoes. Harvesting equipment
can carry seed residues to conventional fields, seeds can be spilled
from trucks, or unharvested seeds can sprout as volunteers amid the
following year’s crop. Cross-pollination occurs at considerable
distances in high winds or by insect, even with self-pollinating crops
such as rice.” (Freese et al. 2004).
Moreover , widespread contamination of the non-GE (conventional) crop
seed supply in the US increases doubts that GE pharm crops can becontained. As Freese 
et al. (2004) conclude:
“When certified and even breeder seeds, whose cultivation is subject
to extraordinary gene confinement measures, become contaminated,
it becomes impossible to believe in 100% containment of pharm
genes, no matter how stringent the gene confinement measures that
are applied (including geographic isolation).”
BOX1:PHARMACEUTICAL AND INDUSTRIAL COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED INTO RICE PLANTS
LactoferrinLysozymeAlpha-1-antitrypsinDirigent proteinLaccasePinoresinol reductasePinoresinol-lariciresinol reductaseSecoisolariciresinol reductaseAntithrombinSerum albuminAminoglycoside 3’-adenylyltransferaseCBI (the identity of many compounds are not divulged in applications,claiming this information as “confidential business information”)
source: Freese 2002.Pharm rice could pose a special threat to farmers saving their seed.Ellstrand (2003) considers a hypothetical example of a pharm cropgenetically engineered to produce a non-edible, commercial, biochemicalcompound.The GE transgene producing the chemical is passed to wild orweedy relatives of the crop, which then act as a reservoir for the escapedtransgene.This “reservoir” can then return the GE transgene back to thecrop at a different place and time, resulting in GE pharm contamination.This becomes especially problematic if farmers follow the tradition ofsaving seed from one harvest for planting for the next.The frequency of theGE transgene could increase year-to-year as the seed is saved. Eventually,the concentration of the commercial biochemical compound could reachtoxic levels in the harvested seed and have an impact on human health. AsEllstrand (2003) states, the scenario is very unlikely, but none of the stepsare unrealistic.Therefore, if GE pharm rice ever became mixed with, orcontaminated, local varieties of rice where seed is saved, it has thepotential to have serious impacts on human health.
conclusion - co-existence is not possible
Proponents of GE argue that “co-existence” of GE and non-GE rice is
possible. Lessons from Mexico show that GE contamination cannot beprevented.There are several routes that can lead to the contamination ofnon-GE rice, and preventing contamination all along the production anddistribution chain is impractical and impossible.This contamination willthreaten traditional varieties and remove farmers’ choice.
Rice must be
protected and kept GE-free.
