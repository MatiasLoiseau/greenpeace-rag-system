INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT.

MEMORANDUM

OPIC and Ex-Im are federal agencies that provide insurance, loans, and loan guarantees for

overseas projects or to U.S. companies that invest in or provide products for overseas projects.

These projects include oil and gas fields, pipelines, oil refineries and power plants that result in

the direct, indirect, and cumulative emission of billions of tons of greenhouse gases (GHG).

Indeed, OPIC and Ex-Im supported projects are directly or indirectly responsible for 8% of the

annual world-wide GHG emissions – the equivalent of 31.7% of annual U.S. GHG emissions.1

Defendants acknowledge that greenhouse gas emissions may contribute to global warming, and

10

that such climate change may have adverse impacts on the domestic environment.2  This action

11

seeks to compel Defendants to comply with NEPA to analyze the significance of impacts on the

12

domestic environment traceable to their respective actions in support of energy projects that emit

13

greenhouse gases.

14

OPIC and Ex-Im have taken specific final actions providing the basis for this lawsuit.

15

Plaintiffs sent demand letters requesting that OPIC and Ex-Im analyze in a NEPA document

16

whether their respective actions to fund overseas energy projects contribute to global warming.

1 See Declaration of Richard Heede at ¶ 14, n.11 (“Heede Decl.”) (Pls.’ Exh. 1); see also

Declaration of Dr. Michael MacCracken at ¶ 41 (“MacCracken Decl.”) (Pls.’ Exh. 2).

2 Plaintiffs attach expert affidavits to describe the impacts of global warming on the

domestic environment.  See generally MacCracken Decl. Plaintiffs acknowledge that facts in
administrative appeals such as this matter are normally limited to those established by the
administrative record.  Plaintiffs, however, may provide extra-record materials to establish
standing.  See Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw, 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000); EPIC v. Blackwell,
2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20717 *128 (N.D. Ca. 2004) (“Ninth Circuit case law indicates that a
plaintiff may submit a declaration on standing without it being considered improper extra-record
evidence.”). Plaintiffs may also submit extra-record evidence to demonstrate that an agency did
not consider relevant factors.  See Southwest Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. United States Forest
Serv., 100 F.3d 1443, 1450 (9th Cir. 1996).  Plaintiffs’ declarations fit within both of these
exceptions to the record rule.

In response, each agency issued a finding that its actions, both individually (on a project-by-

project basis) and cumulatively (as a portfolio of similar projects), do not have significant

impacts.  Each agency made this finding in a final report and in its reply to the Plaintiffs’

demand letters.  Each finding is final: in reliance, OPIC and Ex-Im have not applied NEPA to

their respective actions on either a portfolio-wide basis or in individual applications for energy

projects.  However, neither agency prepared an EA to support its finding of no significant

impact, nor did they follow required procedures, including response to public comments and

consultation with other federal agencies.

OPIC and Ex-Im’s claims that their actions do not give rise to Plaintiffs’ standing have

10

no merit. In the face of overwhelming scientific evidence that their actions contribute to global

11

warming – including record evidence that Defendants themselves have compiled – they now

12

claim that “the basic connection between human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and

13

observed climate change itself has not been established.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 15.  This extreme

14

position is not supported by any scientific evidence in the record, but by the defense attorneys’

15

selected excerpts from an extra-record report.  Based on these selected excerpts (but not the full

16

report’s conclusions) they argue that Plaintiffs do not have the requisite injury for standing.

17

Further, Defendants attempt to turn the standing inquiry on its head by arguing that Plaintiffs’

18

standing is defeated by the grossly speculative notion of whether the injury could have occurred

19

without government action. The appropriate focus of this inquiry is on the Defendants’

20

affirmative actions, and Plaintiffs amply demonstrate the reasonable concern that their concrete

21

interests are harmed by Defendants’ actions.

22

Defendants also strain to recast Plaintiffs’ claims as an effort to have the Courts micro-

23

manage Defendants’ discretionary administration of their programs.  This “straw-man” argument

fails because Plaintiffs’ claims, as fully supported by the administrative record, challenge

Defendants’ discrete and mandatory obligation to comply with NEPA.  Likewise, OPIC’s claim

that nebulous legislative history – not express statutory language – somehow immunizes it from

suit is without merit.  As expressly recognized by Ex-Im’s own rule, Defendants must apply

NEPA to assess whether their actions may have an impact on the domestic environment.

Moreover, all material facts proffered by defendants are controverted by facts in either

the Administrative Record, Plaintiffs’ declarations, or both.  Defendants’ Motion should be

denied.

II.

BACKGROUND/STATUTORY FRAMEWORK.

NEPA serves as our nation’s “basic national charter for protection of the environment.”

12

40 C.F.R. § 1500.1(a).  It “declares a broad national commitment to protecting and promoting

13

environmental quality,” and ensures such protection though “important ‘action-forcing’

14

procedures.”  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348-49 (1989); see

15

also Anderson v. Evans, 314 F.3d 1006, 1016 (9th Cir. 2002) (“NEPA is a statute that aims to

16

promote environmentally sensitive governmental decision-making”).  These “action-forcing”

17

procedures require all federal agencies to prepare a “detailed statement … on the environmental

18

impact” for every “major federal action [ ] significantly affecting the quality of the human

19

environment.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332 (2).3  All federal agencies must comply with NEPA “unless

3 This “detailed statement” must include, among other things, a discussion of:

(i)
(ii)

(iii)
(iv)

(v)

the environmental impact of the proposed action,
any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be
implemented,
alternatives to the proposed action,
the relationship between local short-term uses of man’s environment and the
maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and
any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved
in the proposed action should it be implemented.

existing law applicable to the agency’s operations expressly prohibits or makes compliance

impossible.” 40 C.F.R. § 1500.6.

In order to implement NEPA’s requirements, the Council on Environmental Quality

(CEQ) issued regulations in 1978 that are binding on all federal agencies.  40 C.F.R. § 1500-

1508.  These regulations clearly define what constitutes agency action and the process for

determining whether the action or program significantly affects the quality of the human

environment.  40 C.F.R. § 1505.1.  Under CEQ regulations, “actions” are defined to include:

“new and continuing activities, including projects and programs entirely or partly financed,

assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.18.4

10

An agency must prepare an EA to determine whether an action is likely to have

11

"significant" environmental effects.  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(b) (“[i]n determining whether to prepare

12

an environmental impact statement the Federal agency shall ... prepare an environmental

13

assessment.”) (emphasis added); 40 C.F.R. § 1508.9; Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v. BLM,

14

387 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. 2004).  An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) must be prepared

15

if the EA concludes that the impact is significant.  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4.  If, after the EA, the

16

agency concludes that the action will not have a significant effect on the environment, the agency

17

may issue a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and may then proceed with the action. 40

18

C.F.R. § 1508.13. Klamath-Siskiyou, 387 F.3d at 993.

19

An agency must take a “hard look” at the environmental effects of a proposed action in

20

an EA to determine if the action’s impacts are significant.  Marsh v. Or. Natural Res. Council,

21

490 U.S. 360, 374 (1989).  As a part of this hard look, the agency must consider all reasonably

42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C).

4 “Actions” under NEPA also expressly include the circumstance where the responsible

officials fail to act.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.18

foreseeable impacts caused by the proposed action, including, among other things, all

foreseeable direct and indirect impacts of the action.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.8, 1508.25(c); City of

Davis v. Coleman, 521 F.2d 661, 679-80 (9th Cir. 1975).  Indeed, “NEPA does not recognize any

distinction between primary and secondary effects.”  Border Power Plant Working Group v.

DOE, 260 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1015 (S.D. Cal. 2003) (citing Methow Valley Citizens Council v.

Regional Forester, 833 F.2d 810, 816-817 (9th Cir. 1987), rev'd on other grounds, Methow

Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332).

Direct impacts are defined as those impacts “which are caused by the action and occur at

the same time and place.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(a).  Indirect impacts, on the other hand, include

10

those impacts “which are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in

11

distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.  Indirect effects may include growth inducing

12

effects and other effects related to induced changes in the pattern of land use, population density

13

or growth rate, and related effects on air and water and other natural systems, including

14

ecosystems.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(b).

15

The agency must also consider the cumulative impacts of past, present, and reasonably

16

foreseeable future actions.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.8; Hall v. Norton, 266 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir.

17

2001).  Cumulative impacts refer to the “impact on the environment which results from the

18

incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable

19

future actions regardless of what agency or person undertakes such action.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.7.

20

When considering whether the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of an action are

21

significant, CEQ regulations require federal agencies to evaluate both the “context” and

22

“intensity” of the impact.  The question of “context” focuses on the significance of the action in

23

its particular setting, and “means that the significance of an action must be analyzed in several

contexts such as society as a whole (human, national), the affected region, the affected interests,

and the locality.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.27 (a).  “Intensity,” on the other hand addresses the severity

of the action.  With regard to intensity, CEQ regulations require the agency to consider a range

of relevant factors including, among others:

(1) the “degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are

likely to be highly controversial;”

(2) the “degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly

uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks;”

(3) “[w]hether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant

but cumulatively significant impacts . ..;”

40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.27(b)(4), (5), (7).

In reaching a conclusion regarding the significance of an impact, the agency must “[set]

16

forth sufficient information to enable the decision-maker to consider fully the environmental

17

factors involved and to make a reasoned decision after balancing the risks of harm to the

18

environment against the benefits to be derived from the proposed action.”  County of Suffolk v.

19

Secretary of Interior, 562 F.2d 1368, 1375 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied 434 U.S. 1064 (1978).

20

CEQ regulations expressly provide that an agency’s adoption of a program or approval of

21

a group of concerted actions to implement a specific policy or executive directive is a major

22

federal action.5  For such systematic and connected, actions CEQ regulations direct each agency

23

to determine, in compliance with NEPA, whether such actions may have significant impact on

24

the human environment, and if so, prepare a programmatic EIS.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.18(b).

25

CEQ regulations likewise direct a programmatic EIS to be prepared where distinct individual

programs, such as a group of concerted actions to implement a specific policy or plan; systematic
and connected agency decisions allocating agency resources to implement a specific statutory
program or executive directive.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.18(b)(3).

projects have similar cumulative impacts (so-called “cumulative actions”).  See 40 C.F.R. §

1508.25.  “Cumulative actions” are defined as actions “which when viewed with other proposed

actions have cumulatively significant impacts and should therefore be discussed in the same

impact statement.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.

As the Ninth Circuit has previously explained, the only exception to NEPA’s requirement

for preparation of an EA or an EIS is where the proposed major federal action falls within a

previously identified “categorical exclusion.”6  The Steamboaters v. FERC, 759 F.2d 1382, 1393

(9th Cir. 1985) (“The only exception to this requirement is where the proposed project ‘normally

does not require either an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment. ...’”)

10

(quoting 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(a)(2)) (emphasis added).  If the proposed action does not fall within

11

a previously promulgated categorical exception, the agency must prepare an EA or an EIS.

12

Steamboaters, 759 F.2d at 1393; see also 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(b) (EA required if action is not

13

categorically excluded).  “An agency cannot avoid its statutory responsibilities under NEPA

14

merely by asserting that an activity it wishes to pursue will have an insignificant effect on the

15

environment.”  Alaska Ctr. for the Environment v. United States Forest Service, 189 F.3d 851,

16

859 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Steamboaters, 759 F.2d at 1393).  NEPA demands preparation of an

17

EA for this determination.

6 An agency may propose categorical exclusions for certain actions that do not generally

have a significant affect on the human environment.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.4.  “Categorical
exclusion” means: “a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a
significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect
in procedures adopted by a Federal agency in implementation of these regulations (§ 1507.3) and
for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact
statement is required.”  Id.  CEQ regulations require an agency to promulgate rules identifying
categorical exclusions.  See 40 C.F.R § 1508.4.  Neither OPIC nor Ex-Im have issued a
categorical exclusion for the type of projects at issue here.

III.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING TO SUE.

To establish Article III standing, Plaintiffs must show: (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation,

and (3) redressability.  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw, 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000); Lujan

v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  In a NEPA case, the causation and

redressability standards are relaxed.  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 573, n.7 (“The person

who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right

without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.”); Public Citizen v.

DOT, 316 F.3d 1002, 1006 (9th Cir. 2003) rev’d on other grounds, 541 U.S. 752 (2004); Comm.

10

To Save the Rio Hondo v. Lucerno, 102 F.3d 445, 452 (10th Cir. 1996) (same).

11

A court need only determine that one of the several plaintiffs has standing for this matter

12

to proceed.  Watt v. Energy Action Educ. Found., 454 U.S. 151, 160 (1981) (“Because we find

13

California [one of three plaintiffs] has standing, we do not consider the standing of the other

14

plaintiffs.”) (citing Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S.

15

252, 264, and n. 9 (1977)); Public Citizen, 316 F.3d at 1014-15 (“We need only find that one

16

petitioner has standing to allow a case to proceed.”).

17

An organization has standing to sue on behalf of its members when a member would

18

have standing to sue in his or her own right, the interests at issue are germane to the

19

organization’s purpose, and participation of the individual is not necessary to the claim or

20

requested relief.  Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343

21

(1977); Public Citizen, 316 F.3d at 1019.  As is demonstrated by the discussion below and

22

attached declarations, the members represented by the organizational Plaintiffs all have standing.

23

The issues are germane to the organizations’ purposes – the organizations are all environmental

24

groups dedicated to such issues.  See generally Dean Declaration (Pls.’ Exh. 15); Passacantando

Declaration (Pls.’ Exh. 16). And, the individual participation of the members is not necessary to

the claims or requested relief.

Additionally, Courts have created a prudential standing requirement that a plaintiff’s

interests fall within the “zone of interests” protected by the statute on which the claim is based.

Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997).  NEPA, the statute at issue here, protects

environmental interests – the very interests in which the Plaintiffs are injured.

Defendants allege that their actions, funding and insuring overseas energy projects that

emit greenhouse gases, have not been proven to harm the Plaintiffs’ interests in the domestic

environment, and that Plaintiffs therefore do not have standing to pursue this Complaint.  They

10

fundamentally misconstrue the Complaint and, as a result, the requirements for standing.

11

Plaintiffs do not seek a remedy to limit emissions associated with Defendants’ actions, or to halt

12

approval of energy project applications.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that, as with most environmental

13

impacts, the impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions traceable to Defendants’ actions are not yet

14

known with absolute precision. However, the administrative record, as supplemented by

15

Plaintiffs’ declarations, reasonably demonstrates that the physical impacts of Defendants’ actions

16

harm the Plaintiffs’ concrete interests.  That showing is adequate for standing to bring the

17

Complaint, which seeks compliance with NEPA procedures for the express purpose of assuring

18

that Defendants thereafter make informed decisions about whether their respective actions cause

19

(or, through a reasonably foreseeable causal linkage, contribute to) adverse impacts on the

20

domestic environment, and if so, whether the impacts are significant.7

7 At the standing stage, Plaintiffs need not prove that Defendants’ actions have or will cause a
particular environmental effect.

To require that plaintiffs prove particular environmental effects for standing
purposes is overmuch and "would in essence be requiring that the plaintiff

A.  Plaintiffs Have Alleged Actual or Imminent Injury to Their Concrete

and Particularized Interests

“To satisfy the injury in fact requirement, a plaintiff asserting a procedural injury must show that

'the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is

the ultimate basis of his standing.’”  Public Citizen, 316 F.3d at 1015 (quoting Cantrell v. City of

Long Beach, 241 F.3d 674, 679 (9th Cir. 2001)); Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 573 n.8.  In

this analysis, a plaintiff need not present evidence of actual environmental harm.  Laidlaw, 528

U.S. at 182; Ocean Advocates v. United States Army Corps of Eng'rs, 361 F.3d 1108, 1120 (9th

10

Cir. 2004) (“‘To require actual evidence of environmental harm … misunderstands the nature of

11

environmental harm’ and would unduly limit the enforcement of statutory environmental

12

protections.”) (quoting Ecological Rights Fund. v. Pacific Lumber Co., 230 F.3d 1141, 1151 (9th

13

Cir. 2000)); Citizens for Better Forestry v. USDA, 341 F.3d 961, 972 (9th Cir. 2003) (“Were we

14

to agree … that a NEPA plaintiff's standing depends on 'proof' that the challenged federal project

15

will have particular environmental effects, we would in essence be requiring that the plaintiff

16

conduct the same environmental investigation that he seeks in his suit to compel the agency to

conduct the same environmental investigation that he seeks in his suit to compel
the agency to undertake." City of Davis, 521 F.2d at 670-671; see also Ecological
Rights Found. v. Pac. Lumber Co., 230 F.3d 1141, 1151 (9th Cir. 2000)
("requiring the plaintiff to show actual environmental harm as a condition for
standing confuses the jurisdictional inquiry . . . with the merits inquiry").

Kootenai Tribe of Idaho v. Veneman, 313 F.3d 1094, 1112 (9th Cir. 2002); Rather Plaintiffs need
only demonstrate a reasonable fear that such actions may result in injury to the Plaintiffs’
recreational, aesthetic, and economic interests. Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 183 (“Here, injury in fact
was adequately documented by the affidavits and testimony of FOE members asserting that
Laidlaw's pollutant discharges, and the affiants' reasonable concerns about the effects of those
discharges, directly affected those affiants' recreational, aesthetic, and economic interests.”); see
also Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149, 157 (4th Cir.
2000) (”Further, CLEAN has presented ample evidence that [plaintiff’s] fears are reasonable and
not based on mere conjecture.”); To require more inappropriately confuses standing with this
matter’s merits. Kootenai Tribe, 313 F.3d at 1112.

violated its procedural obligations; (2) these procedural obligations were designed to protect

plaintiff’s concrete interests; and (3) it is reasonably probable that the challenged action will

threaten plaintiffs’ concrete interests.  See Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 972; see also

Rio Hondo, 102 F.3d at 451-52.

1.  Defendants Have Violated NEPA’s Procedural Obligations

Plaintiffs allege that each Defendant violated NEPA by failing to prepare an EA to

determine whether its actions financing and insuring overseas energy projects, either project-by-

project or as a portfolio, may have significant impacts on the domestic environment.  2d Amend.

10

Complaint at Count 1.  Defendants acknowledge that climate change is occurring, and do not

11

dispute that their actions funding and insuring energy projects may contribute to climate change

12

to some extent. Ex-Im Bank’s Role in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change at 29-30

13

(Ex-Im AR at Tab 1) (hereinafter “Ex-Im Climate Change Report.”); Climate Change: Assessing

14

Our Actions at 16-20, 49 (OPIC AR at 5) (hereinafter “Assessing our Actions”).8 However, they

actions are insignificant.  Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 33; Letter from Mildred O. Caller to

16, 2000 (hereinafter “Ex-Im’s Response to Plaintiffs’ Demand Letter”).9 As explained below,

OPIC and Ex-Im each violates NEPA by not making that finding in a form (EA) and through the

comment and consultation procedures required by NEPA.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1501.4(b) (“[i]n

determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement the Federal agency shall ...

prepare an environmental assessment.”) (emphasis added).

OPIC and Ex-Im’s violation deprived Plaintiffs of the opportunity to participate in the

EA and FONSI or EIS process.

Standing may properly hinge on this type of injury.  We have determined that an
environmental plaintiff was "surely … harmed [when agency action] precluded
the kind of public comment and participation NEPA requires in the EIS process,"
and that this type of "procedural" injury is tied to a substantive "harm to the
environment"  "'the harm consists of added risk to the environment that takes
place when governmental decisionmakers make up their minds without having
before them an analysis (with public comment) of the likely effects of their
decision on the environment. NEPA's object is to minimize that risk, the risk of
uninformed choice. …'"  West v. Secretary of the DOT, 206 F.3d 920, 930 n.14
(9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Sierra Club v. Marsh, 872 F.2d 497, 500 (1st Cir. 1989)).
The same can be said for failure to allow any public input in the EA/FONSI
process, which is, after all, the threshold step for determining whether to prepare
an EIS in the first place.

Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 971.

2.  Defendants’ Procedural Violations Threaten Injury to Plaintiffs’

Concrete Interests

NEPA’s procedural obligations are designed to protect the very aesthetic, recreational

27

and economic interests that Plaintiffs allege are injured by the Defendants’ uninformed decision

28

making.  See id. at 971; Rio Hondo, 102 F.3d at 451-52.  In the context of NEPA the “concrete

29

interest” test focuses on whether there is “a 'geographic nexus' between the individual asserting

30

(quoting Douglas County v. Babbitt, 48 F.3d 1495, 1500 n.5 (9th Cir. 1995)).  Thus,

“environmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the

affected area and are persons ‘for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be

lessened’ by the challenged activity.”  Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 183 (quoting Sierra Club v. Morton,

405 U.S. 727, 735 (1972)).  Plaintiffs’ declarations satisfy these criteria.  They demonstrate that

the Defendants’ actions result in greenhouse gas emissions which contribute, to some extent, to

the adverse impacts of global warming on Plaintiffs’ interests.

Members of the Plaintiff organizations use and enjoy areas that are, or will, be affected

by climate change.  See Dustan Decl. at ¶¶ 4, 10. 12 (Pls.’ Exh. 5); Duchin Decl. at ¶¶ 5, 6, 8, 9

The municipal Plaintiffs likewise satisfy the criteria for concrete interest. A city may

establish standing to sue the federal government “when a harm to the city itself has been

alleged.”  City of Olmsted Falls v. FAA, 292 F.3d 261, 268 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  The municipal

10

Plaintiffs own property in areas that are being and/or will be adversely affected by climate

change.  See Andre Decl. at ¶¶ 7-14 (Pls.’ Exh. 10); Johnson Decl. at ¶¶ 11,12, 18, 19 (Pls.’ Exh.

12

11); Hayes Decl. at ¶¶ 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16 (Pls.’ Exh. 12).  The municipalities also allege that

13

critical infrastructure components are, or will be, affected by climate change, limiting their

14

ability to provide municipal services, such as water and sewer service, and requiring up-grades to

15

existing infrastructure.  See Johnson Decl. at ¶¶ 14, 15, 21, 24, 25; Andre Decl. at ¶ 11; Hayes

Decisionmaking Will Increase the Risk of Harm to Plaintiffs’
Interests.

“Environmental plaintiffs ‘seeking to enforce a procedural requirement the disregard of

17

which could impair a separate concrete interest of theirs, … can establish standing 'without

18

meeting all the normal standards for … immediacy.’” Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at

19

972 (quoting Hall, 266 F.3d at 975) (internal citations omitted); see also Defenders of Wildlife,

20

504 U.S. at 572 & n.7.  Thus Plaintiffs need only demonstrate a reasonable probability that

21

Defendants’ actions threaten to increase the risk of injury to their concrete interests.  See Citizens

22

for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 972; Rio Hondo, 102 F.3d at 451-52.  The question of reasonable

23

probability deals with the likelihood of harm, not with its cause.  See Citizens for Better

The attached declarations amply demonstrate the likelihood of harm to Plaintiffs’

concrete interests as a result of climate change, and likewise demonstrate that the Defendants’

actions may contribute to this injury.  Indeed, OPIC and Ex-Im concede that global warming is

occurring and concede that their actions contribute to global warming, thus increasing risk of

harm to Plaintiffs’ interests by some degree.  See Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 29-30, 33;

Assessing Our Actions at 16-20, 49.

Dr. MacCracken’s declaration further documents the scientific consensus that climate

10

change is occurring, anthropomorphic GHG emissions are the dominant factor in this change,

11

climate change will have impacts in the U.S., and these impacts will affect the areas Plaintiffs

12

use and enjoy.  Dr. MacCracken concludes, “there can be no doubt that the human-induced

13

changes in atmospheric composition are intensifying the natural greenhouse effect and causing

14

global warming that is larger and much longer lasting than could be induced by natural

15

oscillations.”  MacCracken Decl. at ¶ 15.  Further, “natural influences alone cannot explain the

16

very sharp warming of the late 20th century.”  Id. at 17.  “The IPCC has looked particularly

17

closely at climate change during the 20th century, and found that the increase in greenhouse gas

18

concentrations is very likely [90-99% chance] the dominant cause of the increase in average

19

global surface temperatures of approximately 0.6ºC during this period.”  Id. at ¶ 16.

10 The causation question, on the other hand “concerns only whether plaintiffs injury is
dependent upon the agency's policy, or is instead the result of independent incentives governing
the third parties’ decisionmaking process.’”  Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 973, n.8
(quoting Idaho Conservation League v. Mumma, 956 F.2d at 1517-18) (internal quotations and

The “location of emission is not important in considering the potential climatic impacts,”

and “emissions of CO2 anywhere on Earth affect the climate everywhere on Earth, causing

consequences for everyone. … In that respect, emissions outside of the U.S. will contribute to

global warming impacts in the U.S.”  Id. at ¶ 22.  In addition, “[i]t is not only the amount of

warming, but also its very rapid rate that pose unprecedented challenges to the extant

environment and the society and communities that have developed in the world.  The need to

limit emissions is thus to both reduce the amount of change and to slow the onset of the change,

creating a greater likelihood that adaptation is possible and will cost less.”  Id. at ¶ 26.

Dr. MacCracken details the associated U.S. impacts that can be expected as a result of

10

this warming.  These impacts include, among others: significant sea level rise; increased ocean

11

temperatures and loss of arctic sea ice; more frequent and intense extreme weather events; an

12

increase in local flooding and coastal inundation; increased droughts and wild fires; reduction in

13

snowpack; decreased water and air quality; increased pest and disease outbreaks; severe threats

14

to coral habitats; and changes in the composition of forests. See id. at ¶¶ 27-38.  In Dr.

15

MacCracken’s expert opinion, these impacts will affect the specific areas used by Plaintiffs.  See

16

id. at ¶ 27-39.

17

OPIC and Ex-Im both acknowledge that their actions contribute to GHG emissions and

18

global climate change.  Based only on a limited analysis of the direct emissions from power-

19

plants, the agencies themselves estimate that they currently contribute approximately 1.0% of

20

total global CO2 emissions.  See Assessing Our Actions at 19 (noting that 1999 OPIC emissions

21

equal 0.24% of global emissions); Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 29 (noting that 2001 Ex-Im

22

emissions equal 0.80% of global emissions).  They also acknowledge that by 2012-15 this

23

amount will likely rise to 2.0% of total global CO2 emissions.  See Assessing Our Actions at 19

(noting that OPIC emissions will rise to 0.43% of global emissions in 2015); Ex-Im Climate

Change Report at 29 (noting that 2001 Ex-Im emissions will rise to 1.4% of global emissions by

2012).11  This level of emissions increases global temperatures.  See Ex-Im Climate Change

Report at 29.  Therefore, even ignoring the indirect contribution of CO2 from OPIC/Ex-Im

projects, the agencies’ own estimates of their actions demonstrate an increased risk of harm to

Plaintiffs’ interests.

Plaintiffs are not required to “conduct the same environmental investigation that [they

seek] to compel the agency to undertake” in order to establish standing.  Citizens for Better

Forestry, 341 F.3d at 972.  However, in order to provide the Court a more complete

10

understanding of direct, indirect and cumulative emissions associated with OPIC and Ex-Im

11

energy projects, Plaintiffs’ experts have undertaken an analysis of GHG emissions from projects

12

financed and insured by the agencies.  See generally Heede Decl. and accompanying

13

spreadsheets (Pls.’ Exh. 1).  This accounting of direct, indirect and cumulative CO2 emissions

14

from OPIC/Ex-Im projects indicates an annual combined contribution of 507 million tonnes of

15

carbon (MtC), an amount equal to almost 8% of annual global CO2 emissions in 2002.  Heede

16

Decl. at ¶ 13, 14, n.10.  Over their full life-cycle, OPIC and Ex-Im projects will cumulatively

17

contribute 14,000 MtC (or 14 GtC) – an amount equivalent to eight times total U.S. Carbon

11 Defendants attempt to minimize the magnitude of these numbers by comparing them to

the “natural flux of carbon in the atmosphere.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 19.  Climate change experts
explain that this comparison has no scientific basis, and is, quite simply, illogical.  “Because of
how the carbon cycle works, it is the ratio of a given contribution to the total human-induced
emissions of carbon that is of importance, not the ratio to the gross emissions from the oceans
and the biosphere that are naturally balanced by uptake by these two carbon reservoirs.”

emissions in 2003, and more than twice the amount of all global carbon emissions in 2002.12

See Heede Decl. at ¶ 14; MacCracken Decl. at ¶ 41.  Emissions of this magnitude clearly provide

a reasonable probability of increased risk to Plaintiffs’ interests.  See MacCracken Decl. at ¶

41(“[e]mission of 14,000 [MtC] is a large amount and will lead to larger changes in the climate

and a greater risk that various climatic thresholds will be exceeded.”); ¶ 45 (“eliminating or

greatly reducing the substantial amount of carbon emissions associated with OPIC/EX-IM

projects would help ensure that critical climatic thresholds are not exceeded and would be an

important component of efforts to significantly reduce and delay the projected adverse

consequences of global warming resulting from present and future emissions.”).

4.  The Government’s Argument that Plaintiffs Cannot Establish Injury

in Fact is Without Merit

In the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, and the Defendants’ admission that

14

climate change is occurring and that their actions contribute to such change, the Government’s

15

attorneys now make the remarkable post hoc argument that climate change is speculative, and

16

that Plaintiffs’ injuries are not sufficiently “imminent,” or are too conjectural to confer standing.

17

Defs.’ Mem. at 11-14.  These claims are entirely without merit.

18

It should first be noted that the Defendants cannot rely on extra-record evidence or

19

rationale to defend their final actions.   See Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike Extra-Record Evidence.

20

In any event, the Defendants’ claim that “the basic connection between human-induced

21

greenhouse gas emissions and observed climate change has not been established” is directly

22

rebutted by their own administrative record. Defs.’ Mem. at 15. OPIC, for example,

23

acknowledges recent studies which conclude “that human activity is the dominant force behind

12 This estimate assumes no growth in either agencies’ current energy portfolio. See

Heede Decl. at ¶ 14.

the sharp global warming trend seen in the 20th century,” and notes that “there is a strong and

growing scientific consensus that these steady additions of GHGs have tipped a delicate balance

and begun to impact our climate and may be the dominant force driving recent warming trends.”

Assessing Our Actions at 7, 28; see also Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 4 (“the information

presented … leads one to conclude that GHG concentrations have indeed risen and that there is a

reasonable likelihood that the increased concentrations of these gases will result in increased

average global temperatures during the coming decades.”).  This scientific consensus is likewise

documented by Plaintiffs’ expert testimony.  See generally MacCracken Decl.13

Further, the Government’s claim fails to address the correct inquiry.  Standing cannot be

10

defeated by Defendants’ speculation in a brief on whether climate change is caused by natural

11

variations.  Rather, Plaintiffs demonstrate standing upon showing that it is reasonably probable

12

that climate change threatens their concrete interests.  Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184 (plaintiffs’

13

“reasonable” concern is enough for injury in fact).  Plaintiffs amply meet this burden.

14

The Government also suggests that Plaintiffs’ injuries are not sufficiently concrete or

15

particularized to support standing because plaintiffs have not identified injuries that threaten any

13 The Government does not, and cannot, offer any record evidence to refute the scientific
consensus that anthropomorphic GHG emissions are the dominant force behind global warming.
Instead, the Government’s attorneys offer their own non-expert opinion of “uncertainty,” citing
selected portions of an extra-record report for support of their misplaced suggestion.  Defs.’
Mem. at 12 (citing National Academy of Science/National Research Council Report) (Defs.’ Att.
4a).  Contrary to the Government’s suggestion, the NAS study does not conclude that the
connection between human-induced GHG emissions and climate change is uncertain.  In fact, the
very first sentence of the report emphasizes the connection and acknowledges that effects are
already occurring: “[g]reenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth’s atmosphere as a result of
human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.
Temperatures are, in fact, rising.”  See NAS Report at p. 1 (Defs.’ Att 4a.).  The report goes on to
specifically note that current policy decisions --such as those within the scope of OPIC and Ex-
Im’s authority -- will affect the extent of damage caused by global warming: “national policy
decisions made now and in the longer-term future will influence the extent of any damage
suffered by vulnerable human populations and ecosystems …” Id.

particular region of the U.S., Defs.’ Mem. at 11, and because there is “no evidence that the

specific impacts are likely to occur.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 13.  Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs

must provide specific proof of actual environmental harm finds no support in Ninth Circuit case

law.  See Ocean Advocates, 361 F.3d at 1120 (“To require actual evidence of environmental

harm … misunderstands the nature of environmental harm’ and would unduly limit the

enforcement of statutory environmental protections.”) (internal quotations and citations omitted).

Furthermore, contrary to the Government’s implication, Plaintiffs have specifically alleged

particularized harm, and have responded with expert evidence demonstrating the reasonable

probability of increased risk of harm. See MacCracken Decl. at ¶¶ 27-39; 40-45.  Plaintiffs need

10

not “conduct the same environmental investigation that [they seek] to compel the agency to

11

undertake” simply to establish standing. Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 972; see also

12

Rio Hondo, 102 F.3d at 451 (“[NEPA] was not intended to require the plaintiff to show with

13

certainty, or even with a substantial probability, the results of agency action; those examinations

14

are left to an environmental impact statement.”).

15

Defendants’ also dispute Plaintiffs’ standing by asserting that their injuries are “too

16

remote” or too conjectural to confer standing.  Defendants, however, overlook several important

17

points.  First, because Plaintiffs claim a procedural injury, they can “establish standing without

18

meeting all the normal standards for … immediacy.”  Id. at 972 (internal quotations and citations

19

omitted).  Furthermore, in this case Plaintiffs have not only alleged that the impacts of global

20

warming will occur in the future, but also that such impacts are already affecting Plaintiffs’

21

interests.  See, e.g., Ellinghouse Decl. at ¶ ¶ 4, 8; Hayes Decl. at ¶ 18; Dustan Decl. at ¶¶ 10, 12;

22

Duchin Decl. at ¶¶ 4, 5; Berndt Decl. at 5; MacCracken Decl. at ¶¶ 24, 32, 38, 45.  Thus

23

Plaintiffs’ injuries are “actual” and not “remote.”

Finally, the alleged impacts are not conjectural.  Defs.’ Mem. at 14.  Defendants

themselves expressly acknowledge that the very impacts alleged to injure Plaintiffs are likely to

result from global warming.  See, e.g., Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 3 (“The direct regional

environmental impact of such a climate change could include changes in temperature and

precipitations levels, with corresponding changes to the properties and moisture content of soil.

The global impact could include changes in weather patterns and rises in sea level.  The changes

in turn can result in major consequences to ecological systems, human health and socioeconomic

sectors such as agriculture, coastal resources, forests, energy and transportation.”).  The fact that

government studies and statements confirm the Plaintiffs’ allegations weighs in favor of finding

10

standing.  See Central Delta Water Agency v. United States, 306 F.3d 938, 947-48 (9th Cir.

11

2002) (concluding that plaintiffs successfully alleged a credible threat of future injury based, in

12

part, on the fact that the government’s own studies confirmed plaintiff’s allegations); see also

17

B.  Increased Harm to Plaintiffs’ Interests Is Fairly Traceable to

Defendants Uninformed Decisionmaking

“‘Once a plaintiff has established an injury in fact under NEPA, the causation and

18

redressability requirements are relaxed.’”  Public Citizen, 316 F.3d at 1016 (quoting Cantrell,

19

241 F.3d at 682).  Unlike an ordinary causation analysis, a petitioner asserting a procedural

20

injury “need only show its increased risk is fairly traceable to the agency's failure to comply with

21

[NEPA].”  Rio Hondo, 102 F.3d at 451; see also Public Citizen, 316 F.3d at 1016.

traceability 'does not mean that plaintiffs must show to a scientific certainty that
defendant's [emissions] . . . caused the precise harm suffered by the plaintiffs.'
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Watkins, 954 F.2d 974, 980 n.7 (4th
Cir. 1992). . . . If scientific certainty were the standard, then plaintiffs would be
required to supply costly, strict proof of causation to meet a threshold
jurisdictional requirement -- even where, as here, the asserted cause of action does
not itself require such proof. Thus, the "fairly traceable" standard is "'not

equivalent to a requirement of tort causation.'" Id. . . . Rather than pinpointing the
origins of particular molecules, a plaintiff "must merely show that a defendant
discharges a pollutant that causes or contributes to the kinds of injuries alleged" in
the specific geographic area of concern. Watkins, 954 F.2d at 980 (internal
quotation marks omitted). In this way a plaintiff demonstrates that a particular
defendant's discharge has affected or has the potential to affect his interests. See
954 F.2d at 980-81.

Gaston Copper, 204 F.3d at 161 (internal quotations and citations omitted).

10

Further, “[u]nder the National Environmental Policy Act, an injury results not from the

11

agency’s decision, but from the agency’s uninformed decisionmaking.  The increased risk of

12

adverse environmental consequences is due to the agency’s ‘failure substantively to consider the

13

environmental ramifications of its actions in accordance with NEPA.’”  Rio Hondo, 102 F.3d at

14

452 (emphasis in original) (quoting Catron County v. United States Forest Service, 75 F.3d

15

1429, 1433 (10th Cir. 1996)). In this case, Plaintiffs’ increased risk of injury is traceable to OPIC

16

and Ex-Im’s failure to consider the environmental impact of CO2 emissions from projects they

17

finance and insure.

18

The Government argues the chain of causation in this case is too attenuated to confer

19

standing.  In particular, the Government claims that the Plaintiff cannot establish causation

20

because most projects would go forward without OPIC/Ex-Im’s involvement, and that their

21

contribution to global GHG emissions is minimal.14  Defs.’ Mem. at 14-21. This argument stands

22

the causation analysis on its head, and assumes as a predicate the very conclusion that NEPA

23

analysis is designed to answer – i.e., whether the program’s impacts are significant.

14 Defendants further suggest that causation cannot be established because “the basic
connection between human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and observed climate change
itself has not be established.” Defs.’ Mem. at 15. This argument is addressed supra as part of
Plaintiffs’ injury in fact analysis.

As an initial matter, the correct inquiry is the impact of Government action – not

speculation of whether the impact would occur in the absence of government action.  And, as

OPIC and Ex-Im both acknowledge, projects they finance emit greenhouse gases. See Assessing

Our Actions at 16-20; Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 29-30.

Furthermore, the agencies’ very purpose contradicts the notion that these projects would

have gone forward even without the agencies’ assistance.15  First, OPIC and Ex-Im invariably

describe themselves as lenders, financers, and insurers of “last resort.”  See, e.g., 2000 Ex-Im

Annual Report at 2 (Ex-Im AR at Tab 4) (“By targeting financing gaps and officially supported

(emphasis added); 2001 Ex-Im Bank Annual Report at 1 (Ex-Im AR at Tab 5) (“Ex-Im Bank

11

supports U.S. exports sales that otherwise would not go forward.”). Consequently, the agencies

12

purportedly only become involved in transactions where private markets are unable or unwilling

13

to bear the risks associated with each transaction.  OPIC’s 2005 Congressional Budget Request

14

emphasizes OPIC’s directive to not compete with private finance and insurance markets, and

15

specifically identifies the following management goal for OPIC projects: “[e]valuate new

16

projects to ensure that they would not have gone forward but for OPIC’s involvement.”16 OPIC

17

2005 Congressional Budget Request at 10 (Pls.’ Exh. 14).

15 As explained in Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike, these post hoc allegations should be

struck.

16 Emphasizing the convenient inconsistency in the Government’s position on this point,

OPIC has also previously argued to Congress that is not possible to determine whether a
particular investment would or would not be made without OPIC support.  See H. Rep. No. 97-
83, 97th Congress, 1st Sess. at 25 (1981) (“The Committee added an amendment … which would
require OPIC when deciding whether or not to support investments in developing countries to
consider whether the investment is likely to be made without OPIC support.  The amendment
assumes that OPIC ought to limit its support to those investments in developing countries which
would probably not be made without benefit of OPIC support.  OPIC opposed the amendment on

The Defendants’ assertion that the impacts are too attenuated also has no support in this

record.   To the contrary, OPIC and Ex-Im expressly recognize that their financing of a fossil-

fuel-fired power plant results in GHG emissions.  See Assessing Our Actions at 16-20; Ex-Im

Climate Change Report at 29-30.  Ex-Im also recognizes that its financing of oil and gas

extraction projects leads to GHG emissions.  Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 30, Appendix B;

2000 Ex-Im Bank Annual Report at 17 (Ex-Im AR at Tab 4) (“petroleum sector projects

supported by Ex-Im Bank represent a second significant source of carbon dioxide.”). Indeed, the

entire purpose of financing oil field development is to bring oil to market for combustion.

Combustion is not only “reasonably foreseeable,” see 40 C.F.R. § 1508.8(b), but intended.  Thus,

10

it is not too attenuated.

11

As a result, this case is unlike Florida Audubon, and other cases cited by the Defendant,

12

in which the court has found the chain of causation too attenuated to establish standing.  First,

13

unlike Florida Audubon, causation in this case does not turn on speculation over the independent

14

behavior of third parties in response to a shift in tax policy.17 Florida Audubon Soc'y v. Bentsen,

the grounds that it is impossible to determine whether a particular investment will or will not be
made and why.”).

17  The Court Florida Audubon, outlined the extremely attenuated nature of plaintiffs

argument in the following paragraph:

For the tax credit to pose a substantial probability of a demonstrably increased
risk of particularized environmental damage, the credit must prompt third-party
fuel producers to undertake the acquisition of production facilities for ETBE and
begin to produce ETBE in such quantities as to increase the demand for ethanol
from which the ETBE is derived. This increased demand for ethanol must then
not simply displace existing markets for currently-produced ethanol, but in fact
increase demand for the agricultural products from which ethanol is made. Again,
this demand must not be filled by existing corn or sugar supplies, but instead spur
new production of these products by farmers, who must be shown to have
increased production at least to some measurable extent because of the tax credit,
rather than any one of other innumerable farming considerations, including

94 F.3d 658, 669-670 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  In this case, the third party action – combustion of fossil

fuel – is the intended purpose of these projects.  Florida Audubon is therefore inapplicable.

Second, the court in Florida Audubon rejected the “protracted chain of causation” in that case

solely because “plaintiffs have put forward no parallel testimony supporting each step of their

attenuated causal path.”  Id

. at 671.  Here Petitioners' have submitted just such testimony,

detailing each step in the short, logical chain connecting the Defendants’ actions to the increased

risk to Plaintiffs’ interests.  See generally MacCracken and Heede Decls.  And, unlike Florida

Audubon, Defendants here do not dispute the essential elements of causation in this case – that

their actions result in GHG emissions, that these GHG emissions contribute to climate change,

10

and that climate change will have the type of impacts alleged by Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Ex-Im

11

Climate Change Report at 3, 29-30, 33-34. Given Defendants’ admissions, the facts before this

12

Court amply support a finding that Plaintiffs’ injuries can be “fairly traced” to Defendants’

13

uninformed decision-making. Rio Hondo, 102 F.3d at 451; Gaston Copper, 204 F.3d at 161.

14
15
16

C.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Redressability Requirements

With respect to redressability, the Plaintiffs need not demonstrate that the agencies’

17

consideration of their direct, indirect, and cumulative GHG emissions would actually change the

weather, the availability of credit, and existing subsidy programs. Moreover, any
agricultural pollution from this increased production must be demonstrably more
damaging than the pollution formerly caused by prior agricultural production or
other prior use of land now cultivated because of the ETBE tax credit. Finally, the
farmers who have increased production (and pollution) as a result of the tax credit
must include farmers in the regions visited by appellants, and they must use
techniques or chemicals in such fashion and to such extent as to threaten a
demonstrably increased risk of environmental harm to the wildlife areas enjoyed
by appellants.

Florida Audubon, 94 F.3d at 669-670.  Such speculation is entirely absent here.  The cases of
Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984) and Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426
U.S. 26 (1976), cited by the Government for support, likewise turned on speculative third-party
responses to a change in tax policy, and therefore are similarly distinct from the current matter.

result of the agencies’ decisions.  See Rio Hondo, 103 F.3d at 452.  A petitioner “‘who asserts

inadequacy of a government agency's environmental studies … need not show that further

analysis by the government would result in a different conclusion.  It suffices that … the

[agency's] decision could be influenced by the environmental considerations that [the relevant

statute] requires an agency to study.’”  Citizens for Better Forestry, 341 F.3d at 976 (quoting

Public Citizen, 316 F.3d at 1019) (internal citation omitted; emphasis in original).  OPIC and Ex-

Im are required by statute to “insure that … environmental amenities and values … be given

appropriate consideration in [administrative] decisionmaking.”  42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(B).

Plaintiffs therefore “have a relatively easy burden to meet in this case.”  Citizens for Better

10

Forestry, 341 F.3d at 976.  Here, NEPA’s fundamental purpose is to influence decisionmaking

11

by providing important information.  Plaintiffs’ burden is thus met.

IV.

THE APA PROVIDES JURISDICTION OVER DEFENDANTS’
NEPA VIOLATIONS.

The Defendants rely on Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, ___ U.S. ___, 124

17

S.Ct. 2373, 2379 (2004) (“SUWA”) and Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871

18

(1990) for the notion that this matter presents no final agency action over which this Court has

19

jurisdiction.  Defs.’ Mem. at 23-28.  Defendants’ reliance on SUWA and Lujan is misplaced for

20

at least two reasons.  First, what the Defendants characterize as a broad “programmatic attack” is

21

actually a claim that OPIC and Ex-Im violated a discrete and non-discretionary legal obligation

22

to prepare an EA.  This NEPA violation falls well within the scope of the courts’ jurisdiction

23

under 5 U.S.C. § 706(1).  Catron County, 75 F.3d at 1434.  Second, SUWA is not controlling

*101-*103 (N.D. Ca. 2004).

Plaintiffs describe below the violations that will be challenged.  In short, Plaintiffs will

challenge, inter alia, Defendants’ affirmative and final finding that their aggregate energy

portfolios do not have significant environmental impacts.  Plaintiffs will also challenge

Defendants’ affirmative approval of specific projects that will directly or indirectly emit

greenhouse gases, in the absence of the documentation and procedures required by NEPA.

These violations are all established by the Administrative Record.  After describing these

actions, Plaintiffs explain why these actions are final and subject to judicial review.

A.  The Administrative Record Demonstrates that Defendants’ Failure to

Prepare an Environmental Assessment Violates NEPA.

OPIC and Ex-Im have violated NEPA by failing to prepare an EA to determine whether

14

the direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of their actions have a significant effect on the human

15

environment.  See 2d Amd. Cmplt. at ¶¶ 151-152 and request for relief.  The facts supporting this

16

allegation are clear and undisputed: (1) each defendant looked to see whether their actions

17

contribute to climate change, see generally Assessing our Actions; Ex-Im Climate Change

18

Report; (2) each agency determined that it only makes sense to do so in the aggregate or on a

19

portfolio-wide basis, see, e.g., Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 33 (“Hence, Ex-Im Bank’s ‘role’

20

in the GHG emission and climate change issue must be assessed by examining the aggregation of

21

its actions taken to finance projects which produce CO2 emissions.”); Assessing Our Actions at

22

16 (evaluating “OPIC Power Portfolio CO2 emissions” in order “to assess the cumulative GHG

23

and climate implications of [OPIC’s] investment activities”); (3) each agency affirmatively

24

found that their cumulative energy portfolios result in GHG emissions, but concluded that they

25

do not have a significant environmental impact; and (4) neither agency supported this finding

with an EA.  On the basis of that conclusion, Defendants concluded that NEPA does not apply.

See Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 33 (Ex-Im AR at Tab 1); OPIC’s Response to Plaintiffs’

Demand Letter (OPIC AR 4368-70).

NEPA explicitly requires preparation of an EA to determine whether impacts of a

proposed action will be significant.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.9.  That determination – whether the

impact is significant – is the sole purpose of an EA.  See id.  Contrary to the agencies’

suggestion, bald claims of insignificance do not obviate their NEPA duties.  The direct, indirect

and cumulative emissions from Defendants’ project have a reasonably foreseeable cumulative

impact on the earth’s climate, and OPIC and Ex-Im must prepare an EA to evaluate the

10

significance of these reasonably foreseeable impacts.  Their failure to do so violates NEPA, and

11

each violation is a final agency action

12
13
14
15
16

1.  Defendants’ Concede that Greenhouse Gas Emissions are a
Reasonably Foreseeable Impact and Case Law Supports that
Conclusion

NEPA requires that federal agencies consider “any adverse environmental effects” of

17

their “major ... actions,” 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C), and CEQ regulations, which are binding on the

18

agencies, explain that “effects” include both “direct effects” as well as “indirect effects.”  40

19

C.F.R. § 1508.8.  Indirect effects are defined as those that “are caused by the action and are later

20

in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.”  Id.  “Indirect effects

21

may include ... effects on air and water and other natural systems, including ecosystems.”  Id.

22

An agency therefore must consider, as part of its analysis all reasonably foreseeable impacts

23

caused by the proposed action.  See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.8, 1508.25(c); City of Davis, 521 F.2d at

24

676.  “As in other legal contexts, an environmental effect is ‘reasonably foreseeable’ if it is

reaching a decision.’”  Mid States Coalition for Progress v. Surface Transp. Bd., 345 F.3d 520,

548 (8th Cir. 2003) (quoting Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992)).

Defendants here concede that GHG emissions are a reasonably foreseeable impact of

their decisions to finance and insure projects in their energy programs – including coal, oil, and

gas power plants, and oil and gas fields.  Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 30, 33; Assessing Our

Actions at 16. They likewise concede that GHG emissions contribute to climate change.  See id.

Indeed, it is only the extent of the Defendants’ contributions to Climate Change that is disputed.

“When the nature of the effect is reasonably foreseeable but its extent is not … the agency may

not simply ignore the effect.”  Mid States Coalition for Progress, 345 F.3d at 549.

10

Courts have expressly required federal agencies to evaluate the extent of indirect CO2

11

emissions from federal projects significantly smaller than the massive financing and insurance

12

programs at issue here.  For example, in Mid States Coalition, 345 F.3d at 532, plaintiffs

13

challenged the Surface Transportation Board’s approval of a new rail line to service coal mining

14

operations in Wyoming's Powder River Basin.  Plaintiffs alleged that the Board’s failure to

15

consider the air pollution impacts resulting from eventual combustion of coal delivered by the

16

rail line violated NEPA.  Id. at 549.  The court agreed, and finding that the eventual combustion

17

of the coal was not “speculative” – as the Board claimed – but instead “almost certain,” the court

18

concluded that the defendant was legally required to consider the project’s indirect CO2

19

emissions.  Id.

20

Similarly, in Border Power Plant Working Group v. DOE, 260 F. Supp. 2d 997 (S.D.

21

Cal. 2003), the court found that the Department of Energy (DOE) was required to evaluate the

22

GHG emissions of a single 500 MW gas-turbine power plant– despite the fact that the plant’s

23

contribution to climate change may be minor, and despite the fact that the plant was located in

Mexico.  See id. at 1029 (“Because these emissions have potential environmental impacts and

were indicated by the record, the Court finds that the EA's failure to disclose and analyze their

significance is counter to NEPA.”).  The C02 contributions of the 500 MW project at issue in

Border Power are no doubt dwarfed by OPIC and Ex-Im’s total energy portfolio, yet, for the

purpose of NEPA, DOE’s failure to consider these reasonably foreseeable emissions still

rendered its decision “inadequate under NEPA.” Id.

2.  Defendants Concede that Each Agency’s Energy Projects Have

Cumulative Impacts.

CEQ regulations require a programmatic EIS to be prepared where distinct individual

11

projects have similar cumulative impacts -- so-called cumulative actions.  40 C.F.R § 1508.25.

12

“Cumulative actions” are defined as actions “which when viewed with other proposed actions

13

have cumulatively significant impacts and should therefore be discussed in the same impact

14

statement.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.25.  Cumulative impacts are likewise described as “the impact on

15

the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other

16

past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions ….  Cumulative impacts can result from

17

individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.”  40

18

C.F.R. § 1508.7.  If substantial questions are raised as to whether the group of actions will have a

19

cumulative impact, a single EA must be prepared to determine the significance of those

20

cumulative actions.  See Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr., 387 F.3d at 998 (cumulative NEPA

21

analysis must be “done in a single document when the record raises ‘substantial questions’ about

22

whether there will be ‘significant environmental impacts’ from the collection of anticipated

23

projects.”); Blue Mountains Biodiv. Project v. Blackwood, 161 F.3d 1208, 1215 (9th Cir. 1998);

In this case, both agencies readily concede that each individual project adds to the

cumulative impact on climate change.  Indeed, each agency has conceded that the impact of

these projects should be evaluated at the program or portfolio level.  Thus OPIC “recognized that

carbon dioxide emissions and climate change impacts are global and that the assessment of such

impacts should not be limited to the project-specific level, but must be done on a cumulative

basis.”  OPIC Press Release, Landmark OPIC Report Shows Way for Government and Business

to Demonstrate Accountability for Climate Impacts, October 30, 2000 (OPIC AR 4384).

Based on this recognition, OPIC prepared an analysis of cumulative carbon dioxide

emissions associated with the agency’s “power portfolio” including its investment in and

10

insurance of power plants.  Assessing Our Actions at 12, 16-20.  OPIC, however, did not prepare

11

an EA of its energy portfolio, nor did it consider the impacts of indirect emissions – such as

12

those associated with eventual combustion of fossil fuel extracted from projects financed or

13

insured by OPIC.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.8 (NEPA analysis must include consideration of

14

“indirect effects”).  OPIC likewise did not consider alternatives to its power portfolio

15

investments, see 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14; did not invite comments from other federal agencies,

16

including EPA, see 40 C.F.R. § 1503.1; and did not publish its analysis for public comment. Id.

17

Ex-Im has also acknowledged that carbon dioxide emissions associated with its projects

18

contribute to global warming, and has determined that the impact of its own energy program

19

investment must be assessed at an “aggregate” level: “the aggregate contribution from … global

20

point sources of [CO2] from manmade activity appears to be triggering some effect on earth’s

21

climate. Hence Ex-Im Bank’s ‘role’ in the [Greenhouse Gas] emission and climate change issue

22

must be assessed by examining the aggregation of its actions taken to finance projects which

23

produce CO2 emissions.”  Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 33.  Ex-Im, like OPIC, conducted a

limited analysis of the aggregate direct impact of its actions on climate change. Id. But Ex-Im

also refused to use NEPA procedures for this analysis – it did not consider indirect emissions

associated with combustion of fossil fuels, it failed to present alternatives to its energy program

investments, it did not invite comments from other federal agencies with expertise in the area,

and it failed to publish its limited analysis for public comment.

3.  Defendants’ Failure to Prepare an Environmental Assessment

Violates NEPA

It is undisputed that neither agency has prepared a programmatic EA or EIS to assess the

10

significance of the environmental impacts associated with each agency’s portfolios.  Nor have

11

the agencies prepared individual EAs for each project that consider the direct, indirect, and

12

cumulative impacts of all reasonably foreseeable past, present, and future actions.  Instead, both

13

agencies have declared that they have no NEPA obligation unless they first determine that their

14

actions “could, in fact, cause a significant impact.”  See e.g., Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 33

15

(Ex-Im AR Tab 1); OPIC’s Response to Plaintiffs Demand Letter (OPIC AR 4368-70) (arguing

16

that NEPA review is only triggered if “OPIC’s contribution to GHGs meets the ‘significance’

17

test”).

18

This position is patently wrong.  Under such an interpretation, EAs would simply serve

19

no purpose – they would never be prepared, and CEQ’s extensive rules on when and how to

20

prepare EAs would be superfluous.  NEPA demands more.  “An agency cannot avoid its

21

statutory responsibilities under NEPA merely by asserting that an activity it wishes to pursue will

22

have an insignificant effect on the environment.”  Alaska Ctr. for the Environment v. United

23

States Forest Service, 189 F.3d 851, 859 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Steamboaters, 759 F.2d at

24

1393).  An EA must be prepared for this determination.  Indeed, a FONSI may only be made

25

after preparation of an EA.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.13 (“[FONSI] shall include the environmental

assessment …”).  This failure to prepare an EA violates the agencies legal obligations under

NEPA.

B.  Defendants’ Failure to Prepare a Programmatic Environmental
Assessment is a Discrete Violation of their Ministerial Legal
Obligation Under NEPA.

The scope of the parties’ disagreement is narrow.  As explained above, Plaintiffs allege

that OPIC and Ex-Im are required to determine whether their actions have a significant

environmental impact through preparation of an EA, but the agencies have refused to comply

10

with NEPA.  2d Amd. Cmplt. at ¶¶ 151-152.  The record demonstrates that Defendants agree that

11

GHG emissions are a reasonably foreseeable result of their actions, and that they should

12

determine if their role in climate change may significantly affect the environment, thus triggering

13

NEPA review.  Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 33 (Ex-Im AR at Tab 1); Assessing Our Actions

14

at 5. Indeed, Ex-Im acknowledges, “Ex-Im Bank’s Environmental Procedures call for a NEPA

15

triggered environmental review for ‘those projects which may significantly affect the quality of

16

the human environment of the US.’”  Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 33; 12 C.F.R. §

17

408.4(b)(1).  Further, the agencies fully agree with the notion that GHG emissions from projects

18

they sponsor must be looked at in the “aggregate” and “portfolio-wide” – or in NEPA parlance,

19

“programmatic” basis.  Assessing Our Actions at 16 (evaluating GHG contribution of OPIC’s

20

“power portfolio”); see also OPIC Press Release, Landmark OPIC Report Shows Way for

21

Government and Business to Demonstrate Accountability for Climate Impacts, October 30, 2000

22

(OPIC AR 4384) (“assessment of [climate change] impacts should not be limited to the project-

23

specific level, but must be done on a cumulative basis.”); Ex-Im Climate Change Report at 33

24

(Ex-Im AR at Tab 1); (“Hence, Ex-Im Bank’s ‘role’ in the GHG emission and climate change

issue must be assessed by examining the effects of the aggregation of its actions taken to finance

They therefore did just that.  OPIC and Ex-Im each looked at their programmatic actions

and concluded, erroneously, that they do not have to comply with NEPA because these

programmatic actions do not have a significant impact on the environment.  Ex-Im Climate

Change Report at 33-34; Assessing Our Actions at 20, 49.  Indeed, the record demonstrates that

the agencies’ exclusive rationale for their refusal to apply NEPA is that their programmatic

actions do not have significant impacts on the domestic environment:

However, our own analysis of project emissions from projects actually supported
by OPIC during this period . . . indicates that the total annual share of 1996 global
CO2 emissions that can be attributed to OPIC-supported projects is no more than
0.5 percent.  This observation is corroborated by a more comprehensive analysis
conducted by Ex-Im bank.  (“Ex-In Bank’s Role in Greenhouse Gas Emissions
and Climate Change,” August 31, 1999).  Therefore, we question whether the
assumption that OPIC’s contribution to GHGs meets the “significance” test that
could, under your interpretation, trigger a PEIS [programmatic environmental
impact statement] under NEPA, or, for that matter, an EIS pursuant to EO 12114.

OPIC Response to Plaintiffs’ Demand Letter at 2 (AR 4369).

It should be noted that, as stated in response to Issue # 3, Ex-Im Bank has
previously concluded that its role in the production of greenhouse gases through
the projects it finances is not significant with respect to its potential effect on the
environment with respect to concerns associated with climate change.

impact on global climate change resulting from the projected greenhouse gas

Emissions and Climate Change, which was issued initially in June 1999 and
revised on August 31, 1999.

Id. at 4.

The dispute arises, however, because the Defendants failed to employ the required EA

process to determine the significance of their actions’ impacts.  40 C.F.R. § 1508.9. NEPA rules

require that a FONSI “shall include the environmental assessment.”  40 C.F.R. § 1508.13.  The

Defendants refuse to perform an EA.

10

The APA provides that “the reviewing court shall compel agency action unlawfully

11

withheld.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1) (emphasis added).  SUWA and Lujan held that action falling within

12

this provision’s scope must be discrete and legally required.18  SUWA, 124 S.Ct at 2378-79.  The

13

Defendants’ failure to prepare an EA constitutes a discrete failure to perform a legally required

14

act.  Catron County, 75 F.3d at 1434 (“alleged failure to comply with NEPA constitutes final

15

agency action”).  A failure to act “is simply the omission of an action without formally rejecting

16

a request.”  SUWA, 124 S.Ct. at 2379.  Here, OPIC and Ex-Im’s failures to act are discrete.  As

17

established above, they specifically determined that they would not apply NEPA because their

18

actions purportedly do not have a significant impact.  But, they failed to prepare an EA in

19

support of that decision.  The specific failure to prepare an EA in support of this conclusion is a

20

discrete failure to act.

18 SUWA observed that 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) codified the traditional use of mandamus to
remedy an agency’s failure to act.  SUWA, 124 S.Ct. at 2379.  Plaintiffs also seek mandamus
under 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  2d Amd. Cmplt. at ¶ 9. Mandamus is available when: (1) the plaintiff's
claim is clear and certain; (2) the defendant official's duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed
as to be free from doubt; and (3) no other adequate remedy is available.  R.T. Vanderbilt Co. v.
Babbitt, 113 F.3d 1061, 1065 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1997).  As explained in the text, Plaintiffs’ claim that
an EA is needed to support the Defendants’ FONSI is clear and certain, and Defendants
obligation to perform an EA is non-discretionary.  A mandamus should issue if the APA fails to
provide an adequate remedy.

The agency action that Plaintiffs seek to compel is also legally required.  See id.; Catron

County, 75 F.3d at 1434.  An EA is the exclusive mechanism used to determine whether impacts

are significant.  “[T]he Federal agency shall: … prepare an environmental assessment” to

determine whether an impact is significant.  40 C.F.R. § 1501.4 (emphasis added); see also 40

C.F.R. § 1508.9 (“’Environmental Assessment’ means a concise public document … that serves

to briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an

environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.”).  And, any FONSI shall

be supported by an EA.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.13.  Therefore, OPIC and Ex-Im failed to perform

the discrete, legally required act of preparing an EA to support its FONSI.  Such acts may be

10

compelled under the APA.  See Catron County, 75 F.3d at 1434.

C.  Defendants’ Affirmative Acts Violate NEPA and are Subject to

Review Under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).

Separate from an agency’s failure to act, the APA also authorizes the courts to determine

15

whether an agency’s affirmative actions were “in accordance with the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).

16

Review of an agency’s affirmative actions are not limited by SUWA.  See EPIC, 2004 U.S. Dist.

17

LEXIS 20717 at *102 (“The instant case entails not a failure to act as in Norton; rather, this

18

involves a challenge to an affirmative final agency action.  Therefore, Norton [SUWA] is not

19

controlling here.”).  Affirmative “agency action” includes “the whole or part of an agency …

20

order … sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13).

21

Two affirmative final agency actions are clearly presented here.  First, each agency has

22

effectively issued a FONSI.  They have concluded that their cumulative actions do not have a

23

significant impact, and on that basis have rejected Plaintiffs’ demand for preparation of an EA.

24

These FONSIs, however, are not in accordance with the law because they are not based on an

25

EA, as required by NEPA.  40 C.F.R. §§ 1508.8, 1508.13. Second, the agencies’ decisions to

finance particular projects constitute final agency action.  These individual actions are not in

accordance with the law because OPIC and Ex-Im did not consider their impacts under NEPA.

Agency action is "final" if two conditions are satisfied: “First, the action must mark the

consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process - it must not be of a merely tentative or

interlocutory nature.  And second, the action must be one by which 'rights or obligations have

been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett,, 520 U.S. at 177-78

(citation and internal quotes omitted).  Both of these affirmative actions constitute final action

that may be reviewed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).

1.  Defendants’ FONSIs are affirmative final agency actions subject to

judicial review under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).

The above-described FONSIs are final affirmative actions that are not in accordance with

13

the law.  NEPA “simply guarantees a particular procedure, not a particular result.  Hence a

14

person with standing who is injured by a failure to comply with the NEPA procedure may

15

complain of that failure at the time the failure takes place, for the claim can never get riper.”

19

environmental impact of the action in question”).

20

OPIC and Ex-Im’s climate change reports, and their subsequent rejection of Plaintiffs’

21

demand letters, are FONSIs – they mark the consummation of the agencies’ decisions that NEPA

22

is not applicable to their actions.  See Makua v. Rumsfeld, 136 F. Supp. 2d 1155, 1161 (D. Haw.,

23

2001) (“The Finding of No Significant Impact Marked the Culmination of Defendants'

consider NEPA’s applicability.

The FONSIs also determine obligations and the legal consequences flowing from this

obligation.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78.  OPIC and Ex-Im have decided that they are not

obligated to apply NEPA.  They thus have not provided the process and analysis required by

NEPA.  Indeed, the record produced by Defendants unequivocally demonstrates that, after

having made their FONSIs, OPIC and Ex-Im continued to pursue their energy portfolios or

programs without regard to NEPA.  See e.g., OPIC Environmental Clearance Documents (OPIC

AR 190-1362) (no NEPA review); Ex-Im Project Engineering Evaluations (Ex-Im AR Tabs 24-

28) (no NEPA review). Therefore, the Defendants’ affirmative finding that their actions do not

result in significant impacts are final actions not in accordance with the law, and thus subject to

10

review under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).

11
12

2.  Defendants’ decisions to finance particular projects are final agency

actions subject to judicial review.

Final agency action includes the grant of money or assistance.  5 U.S.C. § 551(11)(A).

15

The Defendants’ decisions to finance or otherwise assist the projects identified in the complaint

16

and record constitute final agency action.  Defendants do not dispute that these actions are final,

17

nor do they dispute Plaintiffs’ claim that these projects were not subjected to NEPA review.

18

Indeed, the record is devoid of any NEPA review for these projects.

19

Rather, Defendants persist in their “straw man” argument that Plaintiffs are mounting a

20

broad challenge to the discretion exercised in the administration of their program.  See Defs.’

21

Mem. at 28 (citing Sierra Club v. Peterson, 228 F.3d 559, 567 (5th Cir. 2000)).  As established

22

above, Plaintiffs are not mounting such a challenge and Sierra Club v. Peterson is irrelevant to

23

this matter.  Further, the fact that Defendants have failed to apply NEPA to all of their actions

24

does not prevent Plaintiffs from selecting particular individual actions to challenge.  That is

25

exactly what Plaintiffs do here.

The Defendants also argue that laches bars the challenges to the particular projects

identified in the Complaint.  See Defs.’ Mem. at 28-29, n. 18.  However, Plaintiffs do not even

attempt to claim that this matter meets the elements necessary to claim laches.  See Neighbors of

Cuddy Mountain v. United States Forest Service, 137 F.3d 1372, 1381 (9th Cir. 1997) (“the party

seeking to invoke [laches] must show: (1) that the opposing party lacked diligence in pursuing its

claim; and (2) that prejudice resulted from that lack of diligence.”).  These elements are not met

here.  And, “’we have repeatedly cautioned against application of the equitable doctrine of laches

to public interest environmental litigation. … This approach has found unanimous support in the

other circuits.’" Id. (quoting Portland Audubon Soc'y v. Lujan, 884 F.2d 1233, 1241 (9th Cir.

10

1989)).

11

Further, the cases cited by Defendants in support of their laches argument address

12

mootness – not laches.  However, Defendants fail to develop a mootness argument other than to

13

generically state that commitments for unspecified projects have been made and monies have

14

been partially or fully disbursed or are in the process being repaid.  See Defs.’ Mem. at 28, n. 18.

15

No project-specific analysis is provided.  Id.  This mere footnote fails to meet the particularly

When evaluating the issue of mootness in NEPA cases, we have repeatedly
emphasized that if the completion of the action challenged under NEPA is
sufficient to render the case nonjusticiable, entities "could merely ignore the
requirements of NEPA, build its structures before a case gets to court, and then
hide behind the mootness doctrine.  Such a result is not acceptable."  West, 206
F.3d at 925 (quoting Columbia Basin Land Protection Ass'n v. Schlesinger, 643
F.2d 585, 592 n.1 (9th Cir. 1981)).  Accordingly, defendants in NEPA cases face
a particularly heavy burden in establishing mootness.

Cantrell v. City of Long Beach, 241 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir. 2001).  This is especially

27

important, where as here, specific projects are, by Defendants’ admission, still active and

28

Defendants’ failure to comply with NEPA is on-going.  Indeed, it is undisputed that the

Defendants continue to assist projects without first applying NEPA.  Defendants’

violations are thus capable of repetition, yet evading review.  See Anderson v. Evans, 371

F.3d 475, 479 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc).  Defendants’ mootness argument is without

merit.

V.

OPIC’S ACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW
UNDER THE APA, AND OPIC IS SUBJECT TO NEPA

Federal agencies are subject to judicial review of their actions under the APA unless

another statute specifically precludes review.  OPIC’s organic statute does not contain express

10

language that precludes review, and legislative history does not suggest that Congress intended

11

to exempt the agency from review.  Furthermore, OPIC is subject to the requirements of NEPA.

12

NEPA requirements apply to all federal agencies.  See 42 U.S.C. § 4332.  The requirements set

13

forth in NEPA are “supplementary to those set forth in existing authorizations of Federal

14

agencies.”  42 U.S.C. § 4335.  OPIC is subject to specific environmental review requirements

15

that are tailored to the agency’s overseas operations. See 22 U.S.C. § 2151p(c)(1)(A). NEPA

16

supplements these procedures – they do not supplant NEPA.  Legislative history helps to explain

17

the relationship between these requirements, but history does not suggest that Congress intended

18

to divorce OPIC and NEPA procedures, as Defendants suggest.  Rather, the absence of express

19

language to that effect demonstrates that NEPA applies.

20
21
22

A.  OPIC’s Organic Statute Does Not Preclude Judicial Review

The APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702, allows judicial review of agency action for persons “suffering

23

legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.…”

24

Section 702 is applicable unless judicial review is expressly precluded by statute.  See 5 U.S.C. §

25

701(a)(1).  “In the absence of express statutory language,” the Supreme Court has “reserved that

26

exception for cases in which the existence of an alternative review procedure provided ‘clear and

convincing evidence’ … of a legislative intent to preclude judicial review.”  Franklin v.

Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 820 (1992) (citation omitted).

OPIC’s organic statute does not contain express language that precludes judicial review,

nor does it contain an “alternate review procedure.”  Furthermore, legislative history does not

indicate that Congress intended for OPIC to be immune from judicial review.

Defendants confuse the two threshold requirements for determining reviewability.  For a

statute to preclude judicial review, it must offer express language or alternative evidence of

congressional intent.  Defendants seek to stitch pieces of these separate requirements into a

single standard.  Defendants argue that the “express language” of OPIC’s organic statute

10

“demonstrates Congress’s intent to preclude judicial review of OPIC’s compliance with its

11

environmental review obligations.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 30 (emphasis added).  Statutory text may be

12

termed “express” when it offers a clear statement whose meaning does not require additional

13

evidence to discern.  See, e.g., Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company v. Pueblo of

14

Santa Ana, 472 U.S. 237, 276 (1985).  An examination of Congressional intent should not be

15

necessary to interpret express language.  Defendants cannot point to express language in OPIC’s

16

statute to support their position.

17

The section that Defendants rely upon reads: “Each guaranty contract executed by such

18

officer or officers as may be designated by the Board shall be conclusively presumed to be issued

19

in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.”  22 U.S.C. § 2197(j).  This section contains

20

no express reference to judicial review or an “alternate review procedure,” and the language

21

bears little resemblance to other express statutory provisions that purport to insulate agencies

22

from judicial review.  For example, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act

23

(ISTEA), Pub. L. No. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914 (1991), provides: “[A]ny decision by the

Secretary concerning a plan or program described in this section shall not be considered to be a

Federal action subject to review under [NEPA].”  23 U.S.C. § 134(o) (emphasis added).

According to the Sixth Circuit, “This language specifically precludes judicial review of certain

actions under NEPA.”  Southwest Williamson County Community Ass’n, 173 F.3d at 1038

(emphasis added).  Thus, even with clear language exempting “any decision” under ISTEA from

review, the court found preclusion to be limited.  Other statutes that preclude review similarly

provide explicit direction that agency actions “shall not be reviewable in any court.”  See, e.g.,

Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. § 288i; Transportation Equity Act for the 21st

Century, 23 U.S.C. § 135; Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b); Regional Rail

10

Reorganization Act of 1973, 45 U.S.C. § 716.  OPIC’s organic statute clearly does not exempt

11

the agency from judicial review.

12

Defendants argue that the statute’s “presumption of compliance” is sufficient express

13

language.  This phrase, however, does not appear in OPIC’s organic statute.  It is a basic tenet of

14

administrative law that agency decisions are presumptively valid.  But that basic premise does

15

not amount to blanket immunity from review.  Defendants rely solely on legislative history and

16

their own experts to carry their point.  Yet even the legislative history does not expressly exempt

17

OPIC from judicial review.  The congressional records provide no more explicit language than

18

the OPIC statute.  A House Committee Report explains that guaranty contracts are presumed to

19

be in compliance with statutory requirements.  This explanation mirrors the accepted statutory

20

text, and it does little to clarify Congress’ intent.  It is important to note, moreover, that the

21

legislative history fails to make reference to the applicability (or lack thereof) of judicial review.

22

A close reading of the legislative history in fact suggests the opposite.  The Committee

23

Report states that despite the “presumption of compliance,” “a claimant would not, however, be

protected if execution of the contract was induced by fraud or misrepresentation.”  H. Rep. No.

91-611, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. at 37 (1969).  Thus, even guaranty contracts that carry a

“presumption of compliance” are not entirely shielded from review.  By defining the

applicability of the “presumption of compliance,” Congress anticipated the necessity for some

investigation to determine if a contract was “induced by fraud or misrepresentation.”  Thus, not

only does the OPIC statute not preclude review, it provides for a specific situation when review

is required.

In addition, Defendants’ arguments fail because they confuse the intended beneficiaries

of the “presumption of compliance.”  A House Committee Report indicates that this presumption

10

is intended to protect contract claimants, not OPIC.  As Defendant asserts, OPIC’s clients may

11

rely on the “presumption of compliance” when “assessing the validity of OPIC’s guarantees.”

12

Defs.’ Mem. at 31.

13

Additional legislative history suggests that OPIC actions are indeed subject to judicial

14

review.  In 1992, an amendment was proposed to transfer OPIC operations to the Office of

15

Management and Budget (OMB).  138 Cong. Rec. H7494-03, at 32.  The amendment failed, but

16

the record of discussion sheds some light on OPIC’s susceptibility to review.  The proposed

17

revision provides: “Orders and actions of the Director of the [OMB] in the exercise of functions

18

of the [OPIC] shall be subject to judicial review to the same extent and in the same manner as if

19

such orders and actions had been by the [OPIC].”  Id.  Clearly, the Representatives participating

20

in that conversation assumed that OPIC was subject to judicial review.

21

Finally, OPIC’s arguments fail when exposed to strict statutory interpretation.  Even if a

22

“presumption of compliance” is deemed to equal a prohibition on judicial review, Defendants

23

have highlighted a very narrow provision as express language.  A plain reading of section

2197(j) clearly indicates a treatment of guaranty contracts.  OPIC’s activities extend beyond

guaranty contracts, however.  The specific reference to guaranty contracts, and none of OPIC’s

other functions, demands a limited treatment of that section’s applicability.  The agency’s

organic statute provides: “The requirements of section 2151p(c) of this title relating to

environmental impact statements and environmental assessments shall apply to any investment

which the Corporation insures, reinsures, guarantees, or finances.…”  22 U.S.C. § 2199(g)

(emphasis added).  Thus, even if Congress intended to immunize guaranty contracts from review,

there is nothing in OPIC’s statute or legislative history to suggest that immunity is extended to

all of the agency’s actions.  Defendants have not established the “clear and convincing evidence”

10

of Congress’ intent to preclude all of OPIC’s actions from judicial review under the APA.

11
12
13

B.    OPIC Is Subject to NEPA Requirements

Even if the OPIC statute does preclude judicial review, the agency must still conform to

14

the requirements of NEPA.  “[E]ach agency of the Federal Government shall comply with

15

[NEPA] unless existing law applicable to the agency’s operations expressly prohibits or makes

16

compliance impossible.”  40 C.F.R. § 1500.6.  Defendants argue that OPIC’s statutory

17

requirements supplant NEPA.  Rather than supplanting NEPA requirements, however, the OPIC

18

statute gives the agencies directions on how to apply NEPA.  As Defendants state, the

19

environmental assessment and environmental impact statement are not unique to OPIC, but are

20

“terms of art from NEPA.” Defs.’ Mem. at 34.

21

OPIC’s environmental mandates apply to overseas – not domestic – environmental

22

impacts.  Therefore, as with application of NEPA to Ex-Im, OPIC’s statutory requirements are

23

supplemental and complementary to the agency’s duties under NEPA.  This principle is

24

supported by case law, legislative history, and a plain reading of the pertinent legislative texts.

The Ninth Circuit has recognized two tests to exempt agency action from NEPA

requirements.  When an agency has NEPA-like procedures in place, but declines to apply actual

NEPA procedures to its actions, courts may apply a “displacement” test or a “functional

equivalent” test.  “The ‘displacement’ argument asserts that Congress intended to displace one

procedure with another.  The “functional equivalent” argument is that one process requires the

same steps as another.”  Douglas County, 48 F.3d at 1504 n. 10.  Defendants argue that Congress

intended to “displace” NEPA requirements with procedures specifically tailored to OPIC, and

that the NEPA process is therefore “superfluous.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 32.  These cases are

inapposite because review of impacts abroad does not render domestic review superfluous.19

10

Further, Merrell and Douglas County may be distinguished from the instant matter

11

because the respective defendants in those cases are agencies with a “responsibility to protect the

12

environment.”  Courts provide a more flexible application of NEPA to such agencies.  In

13

Merrell, the court approved of a statement taken from the legislative history of the Federal

14

Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, which stated: Because the basic thrust and principal

15

responsibility of [the Environmental Protection Agency] are to protect the environment,

16

[Congress] does not see a need to [apply NEPA].”  Merrell, 807 F.2d at 780 (citation omitted).

17

In Douglas County, the court found that “NEPA does not require an [environmental impact

18

statement] for actions that preserve the physical environment.”  Douglas County, 48 F.3d at

19

1505.  The agency action at issue in Douglas County “furthers the purpose of NEPA,” and

20

requiring additional NEPA procedures “would only hinder its efforts at attaining the goal of

19 Defendants rely primarily on Douglas County and Merrell v. Thomas, 807 F.2d 776

(9th Cir. 1986), to advance these arguments.  Douglas County has been specifically rejected by
the Tenth Circuit and the District Court for the District of Columbia.  See Catron County, 75
F.3d 1429; Cape Hatteras Access Preservation Alliance v. U.S. Dept. of Interior, 2004 WL
2430095 (D.D.C. 2004), 34 Envtl. L. Rep. 20,136.

improving the environment.”  Id. at 1506 (citing Pacific Legal Foundation v. Andrus, 657 F.2d

829, 837 (6th Cir. 1981).

OPIC has an economic mission, and it is not an environmental protection agency.  Thus,

unlike the defendants in Merrell and Douglas County, OPIC’s actions are not presumed to

further the goal of “improving the environment,” and its environmental review procedures do not

displace NEPA.

Furthermore, in Douglas County, the court found that the Endangered Species Act “has

an important mandate that distinguishes it from NEPA. … This mandate conflicts with the

requirements of NEPA because in cases where extinction is at issue, the Secretary has no

10

discretion to consider the [other] environmental impact[s] of his or her actions.”  Douglas

11

County, 48 F.3d at 1503.  In other words, Congress had specifically given preference to

12

endangered species protection, to the exclusion of other environmental considerations.

13

OPIC, however, is required to: “refuse to insure, reinsure, guarantee, or finance any

14

investment in connection with a project which the Corporation determines will pose an

15

unreasonable or major environmental, health, or safety hazard, or will result in the significant

degradation of national parks or similar protected areas.”  22 U.S.C. § 2191(n).  Contrary to

17

Douglas County, OPIC lacks the discretion to not consider the environmental impacts of its

18

actions.

19

OPIC also argues that its organic statute displaces NEPA because it sets forth a specific

20

procedure for environmental review that is different from the NEPA process.  Defendants argue

21

that there would be “little point” to OPIC’s specific procedural requirements if NEPA otherwise

22

applied.  Defs.’ Mem. at 35.  These additional requirements were intended to clarify OPIC’s

23

duties under NEPA, however, not to supplant them.  Similarly, the public comment procedures

set forth at 22 U.S.C. § 2191a serve to further define OPIC’s statutory commitments, rather than

curtailing them.

The OPIC Act requires “an environmental impact statement for any program or project

… significantly affecting the environment of the global commons outside the jurisdiction of any

country [or] the environment of the United States.”  22 U.S.C. § 2151p(c)(1)(A).  An EA is

required for “any proposed program or project … significantly affecting the environment of any

foreign country.”  22 U.S.C. § 2151p(c)(1)(B).  Under most circumstances, NEPA requires the

preparation of an EIS for agency actions that affect the environment of the United States.  Thus,

the OPIC statute does not conflict with NEPA.  The requirement of an EA for projects outside of

10

the United States simply adds to the demands of NEPA.  Rather than supplanting NEPA

11

requirements, as Defendants suggest, the OPIC statute gives the agencies directions on how to

12

apply NEPA.  As Defendants state, the EA and EIS are not unique to OPIC, but are “terms of art

13

from NEPA.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 34.

14

In a further explication of OPIC’s relationship to NEPA, Congress granted to the

15

President power to exempt individual OPIC projects from environmental review.  See 22 U.S.C.

16

§ 2151p(c)(2).  This section balances the President’s interest in foreign policy with the

17

requirements of NEPA.  It shows that Congress did anticipate that NEPA would generally apply

18

to OPIC’s actions.  The section does not suggest, however, that Congress intended to exempt all

19

of OPIC’s activities from NEPA review.

20

Defendants argue that Congress intended to divorce OPIC’s environmental review

21

responsibilities from its responsibilities under NEPA.  Legislative history suggests, however, that

22

Congress intended to define OPIC’s environmental review process via reference to NEPA.  A

1981 (ISDCA) discusses the environmental review procedures that are applicable to OPIC.  As

Defendants correctly point out, OPIC is synonymous with U.S. AID in the text: “[t]he committee

does not … expect this amendment to section 118 to impose any more or any fewer requirements

on AID than are already set forth in AID’s own environmental procedures (regulation 16, 22

CFR par. 216).” H. Rep. No. 97-58, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 47 (1981) (emphasis added).

This does not amount to an express statutory exemption.  See 40 C.F.R. § 1500.6.  To the

contrary, the U.S. AID regulations clearly anticipate NEPA’s applicability to the agency’s

actions.  Thus, NEPA requirements do not violate the “no more, no less” provision in the above

statement.  U.S. AID’s requirements are laid out in implementing regulations, which provide:

10

“These procedures are consistent with Executive Order 12114 … and the purposes of the

11

National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 ….  They are intended to implement the

12

requirements of NEPA as they effect the A.I.D. program.”  22 C.F.R. § 216.1(a) (emphasis

13

added).  These regulations clearly correlate the NEPA process with OPIC’s own environmental

14

review process.  The regulations further define the EIS that is required by AID procedures: “It is

15

a specific document having a definite format and content, as provided in NEPA and the CEQ

16

Regulations.”  22 C.F.R. § 216.1(c)(5).

17

These regulations reflect Congress’ specific intent to apply NEPA to OPIC actions.  The

18

reference to U.S. AID procedures in the legislative history relied upon by Defendants provides

19

“clear and convincing evidence” that OPIC is subject to NEPA.  The fact that the Committee

20

Report on the ISDCA excluded a specific reference to NEPA for that statute does not belie this

21

point.  Reference to NEPA was struck “so as to avoid confusion.”  H. Rep. No. 97-58, 97th

22

Cong., 1st Sess. 47 (1981).  The agency regulations referred to in the statute already describe the

23

agency’s duties under NEPA, so additional reference to NEPA may have cast those procedures

into question.  The excision does not indicate that Congress sought to modify those regulations

and exclude OPIC from its responsibilities under NEPA.

VI.  CONCLUSION.

For the reasons stated, Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied.
