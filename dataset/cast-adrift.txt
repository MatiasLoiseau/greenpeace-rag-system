ContentsThe purpose of this briefing
is two-fold. First, it is toshow the comprehensivescale of adaptations thatwill be required the worldover in the face of globalwarming. And, secondly, ithighlights the shamefulabdication of responsibilityby industrialized countries,
overwhelminglyresponsible for creating the
problem, to pay to helpothers, with far fewerresources, live with it.

2 Cast adriftThe other reason is possibly one of embarrassment. 
First, because governments in rich countries are stillwithholding from the general public the full scale of thechanges needed to both stop and live with climatechange. And, secondly, because of the pitifully smallresources that are being made available by rich countries
that created the problem, to poor countries who will sufferit first and worst. The clearest indication of this is the largesums of money, hidden across countless differentgovernment budget lines, being spent by rich countries toadapt at home to the global warming that is alreadyinevitable.
Such a gap between rhetoric, obligation and reality is not
new.
In 1992, at the original Earth Summit, the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) was
signed along with the detailed general programme ofaction Agenda 21. Inconveniently for politicians today,because it gives us all a ruler with which to measure ourgovernments’ response, the secretariat of the EarthSummit put a price on what it would cost to implement thenew environmental agreements and meet their targets:
“Implementing Agenda 21 in low-income countries
would cost an average of more than US$600billion annually between 1993 and 2000, of which$125 billion would have to come in the form ofinternational donations or concessions.”
But even in the euphoric atmosphere and optimism of the
end of the Cold War, aid didn’t go up, it went down. Andthe downturn began immediately after the Earth Summitin the period 1992–94. The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated thatthe cumulative shortfall from 1992–98, based on the levelthat aid would have reached if earlier trends hadcontinued, was $88.7 billion. In 1998 alone the shortfallon the prior trend was $21 billion. In just one example, anextra three billion ECU promised at the time by theEuropean Commission simply failed to materialise.
1
Today, still no estimate has been made of what it will
cost the majority world to adapt to global warming. Thefew lines of international assistance that do exist
developed from arrangements made at the time of theEarth Summit.
The main conduit of funds set up at the time dedicated
to sustainable development was the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), operated jointly by the World Bank, theUNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and theUNDP (United National Development Programme). TheGEF now administers three new funds under the ClimateConvention and Kyoto Protocol – a special climatechange fund, a least-developed-countries’ fund and anadaptation fund. In the year 1999–2000, GEF funding forclimate change was $1.4 billion. Of this, only $199 millionwas grant funding; the rest was leveraged through co-financing.
In Marrakech in 2001 at the seventh Conference of the
Parties to the climate convention (COP7) rich countriescommitted themselves to provide $ 0.41 billion per yearby 2005 to help developing countries “manage their
emissions and adapt to climate change”.
2Since then,
however, only about $0.02 billion has been found. ButSummary and introduction
In 2001 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) published the last comprehensiveassessment of knowledge about global warming. In one area there was a particular black hole.“Estimates of the costs of adaptation are few,” saidthe Synthesis of its Third Assessment Report. Partly the reason for this is because, as the IPCCsays, “the available estimates indicate that costs arehighly sensitive to decision criteria for… specificadaptation measures.”

even the larger figure looks modest compared to the
annual subsidy given by rich countries to their own,heavily polluting, fossil fuel industries, conservativelyestimated at around $73 billion per year for the late1990s.
3 And, compared to the scale of the problem, even
the committed funds look hopelessly inadequate. As theofficial US Global Change Research Information Officepoints out:
“It is estimated that with 1.0 metre sea-level rise,
protection of the vulnerable portion of thecoastline of Dar es Salaam would cost US$380million and protecting the populated coastline ofTanzania would cost US$14.6 billion.”
4
Wealthy members of the international community,
overwhelmingly responsible for current global warming,are obliged by international legal norms and moral codesto meet much of the cost of the problem in poor
countries. This briefing illustrates their chronic failure yetto do so. It also reveals the current ‘I’m all right Jack’
approach by showing some of the projected costs foradaptation measures planned or underway in theindustrialised world. Though not directly comparable for anumber of reasons, these examples highlight theunacknowledged scale and cost of the challenge facingpoor countries. They show a wealthy minority casting therest of the world adrift amidst a problem they had no role
in creating. The IPCC comments that “there are fewcomprehensive estimates of the costs of adaptation.”Even so, compared to the sums on offer from rich to poor
countries, in just one case the cost of maintaining thefunctions of Japanese infrastructure alone against a one-metre rise in sea level is estimated to be between 11.5and 20 trillion yen (roughly £65–100 billion).
5Ironically,estimates show that in the US, energy demand would
increase significantly to help adapt to climate change.The cost of meeting the higher demand might bebetween $200 and $300 billion, with annual costs risingby $33–73 billion.

Anote on blurred definitions
This briefing gathers together many of the generalestimates and several specific examples of measures toadapt to global warming. But the difference betweenspending on mitigation – measures to curb greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions and arrest the problem – andadaptation – measures designed to help us live with now
inevitable change – is not always clear-cut. For example,a deliberate shift towards low-input sustainableagriculture could both reduce the fossil fuel intensity offarming and increase crop resilience in the face of
extreme weather. It would be a case of simultaneousmitigation and adaptation . The field then does not always
have clear boundary markers. To isolate spending onadaptation is notoriously difficult. It can, for example, getswept up in the costs of post-disaster reconstruction. For
example, how much of the money spent in Germany toclean up after severe flooding in 2002 which requiredabout 17,000 people to be evacuated, could be calledspending on adaptation?
7Across the rest of Europe the
flooding affected over 600,000 people and cost at least$15 billion. Or, similarly, how much of the money thatwent to reorganize health and social services in Europefollowing more than 20,000 deaths from the freak
heatwave of 2003 could be called adaptation spending?
3 Cast adrift


For one big reason, forcing a distinction between the
cost implications of either can be counter-productive.Whilst mitigation and adaptation might seem expensive
in the short-to-medium term, the failure to do either willmean much greater, and possibly incalculable, cost inthe long-term.
The UNEP’s Finance Initiative estimates that on current
trends, worldwide economic losses due to naturaldisasters – the vast majority being hydro-meteorologicaland therefore directly affected by climate change – willhit $150 billion per year in the next decade: roughly threetimes the size of the global aid budget. As a formerdirector of one of the world’s largest insurancecompanies, CGNU, Andrew Dlugolecki did his own sumsand came to an even more dramatic conclusion.Comparing annual average economic growth figures witha linear projection of rising climate-related damages, heconcluded that by about 2065 damages would exceedgross world income. In other words, climate change willhave bankrupted the global economy. The importantthing, then, is action. Action to stop climate change, butnot to ignore that for many people living in resource-poorcountries ‘dangerous’ climate change is already with us.And, at the moment, these people are being cast adriftand left to sink by rich countries in a warming world.

General cost estimates
The reason that even this better-studied area is sofraught with difficulty is summed up by the EuropeanEnvironment Agency (EEA): 
“Important factors that influence the estimates
include differences in cost definitions andbaseline scenarios, the assumed effectiveness ofpolicies and measures for reduction of emissions,and the greenhouse gases that have been takeninto account (only carbon dioxide or all gases). A further important factor is different assumptionsabout using the Kyoto mechanisms: jointimplementation, clean development mechanism,emissions trading and the EU internal emissionstrading scheme.”
8
Putting difficulties in finding the right numbers aside,Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of theEEA concludes:
“The substantial financial costs for Europe’s
economy, people and ecosystems meanseveryone has to play a role and take account ofclimate change in their policy decisions…strategies are needed, at European, regional,national and local level, to adapt to climatechange.”

The range of adaptation challenges in Europe, even withall its enormous economic resources, is huge. Theyinclude:/L50098More frequent and costly storms, floods, droughts andother extreme weather hitting every aspect ofpeoples’ livelihoods and the economy. 
/L50098Wetter conditions in northern Europe but drier weather
in the south threatening agriculture.
/L50098More frequent and more intense heatwaves, a provenand fatal threat to the elderly and frail.
/L50098Melting glaciers, with three-quarters of those in theSwiss Alps likely to disappear by 2050, which willchange the face of Europe.
/L50098Rising sea levels threatening major infrastructure forcenturies to come. 
According to the EEA, two-thirds of catastrophic events
since 1980 have been climate-driven by floods, storms,droughts or heatwaves. Such disasters doubled duringthe 1990s compared to the 1980s and now cost around$11 billion annually and account for 79 per cent ofeconomic losses from catastrophic events.
10The annual
cost of adaptation in Canada was put at $11.6 billion byone 1999 study.

Table 1 shows the range of adaptation strategies needed
by Europe.
Insurance and business at risk
Climate change will necessarily have a growing impacton all economic sectors – an impact that is currentlygoing largely unaddressed. The extent of the ‘value atrisk’ from climate change could be as much as 15per cent of the total market capitalisation of major
5 Cast adriftClimate change adaptation costs for
industrialised countries
Wildly varying estimates exist for what it will cost rich
countries to adapt to climate change. Even when itcomes to the more direct costs of implementing theKyoto Protocol, the estimate for the European Union
ranges from about €4billion to €30 billion per year. 

companies12– potentially some £165 billion of the
market capitalisation of companies on the FTSE All ShareIndex.
13Failure to address the potential risks associated
with climate change, which are faced by every businessand investment portfolio, raises serious questions aboutthe proper exercise of corporate governance andfiduciary duty. In addition, the failure of firms to report ontheir exposure to climate-related risk is creating aperverse incentive for investment in carbon intensiveindustries.
14In one sense, the very scale of value
potentially at risk means that the cost of corporate re-engineering to reduce that risk might appear to benegligible or negative in the long term. But corporationsexist in the here and now and, initially, adapting to globalwarming is going to cost.
The risks to business from climate change fall into two
broad categories. First there are the direct impacts fromclimate change in the form of flood damage resultingfrom rising sea levels, changing weather patterns andsingular extreme weather events. Then there are theindirect risks associated with changing factor prices,demand conditions, policy changes resulting from carbonmitigation schemes (such as carbon emissions trading
schemes, climate change levy etc.), political unrest,international conflict, risk to reputation and risk of litigation. 
More immediate risks to business are, however, posed
by the indirect effects of climate change. These include,
but are not limited to, the introduction of carbon taxesand carbon trading regimes for large GHG emitters, plusthe change in factor prices which will result from theseadditional costs. A recent Royal Society report promotingthe replacement of the Climate Change Levy with acarbon tax, estimates that to reduce emissions in linewith the UK’s Kyoto commitment would require a 10 percent increase in the price of petrol and a 15 per centincrease in the price of electricity.
15If this relatively
modest measure were to be taken up, adaptation in thebusiness sector would mean having to rework theiraccounts to absorb such price rises.
6 Cast adriftClimate change impact Adaptation strategies (examples)
Increasing temperatures Modify building design to cope with higher temperatures and enhanced need for
summer cooling.
Precipitation extremes Dams and other flood protection constructions, as well as urban storm sewage systems, need
to be assessed for ability to cope with enhanced runoff from more intense storms.
Glacier retreat Hydro-electric power plants in glacial areas need to adapt to reduced summer flow as glacial
extent decreases and to enhanced winter flow as temperatures rise.
Snow cover The skiing industry at lower elevations needs to diversify to take account of decreasing snow
cover. Implementation of snow-making machines is a short-term strategy.
Arctic sea ice Need to protect the habitats of indigenous people.Rise in sea level Infrastructure changes in vulnerable areas, for example, modification of harbours and ports,
enhancement of existing sea defences and managed retreat in areas of low-value land.
Marine growing season Manage changes in fishing and tourism (harmful algae blooms).Marine species composition Commercial fishing industry and policy-makers need to take account of shifts in the
geographical distribution of species; for example, the northward movement of cod in the
southern North Sea.
Species composition Develop and manage strategies that create a porous landscape allowing species to migrate
freely.
Plant species distribution in Establish ecological reserves to reduce additional pressure from land-use and tourism activities.
mountain regionsTerrestrial carbon uptake Strategies to increase carbon sink strength of soils under agricultural land; establish long-
rotation tree species; building design to incorporate more wood.
River discharge Establish flood areas, enforce dikes.
Agriculture New cropping practices to take account of longer growing season; development of two-crops-
per-season agriculture. Establish new varieties; avoid agriculture in risk zones (flood areas, very
dry soils).
Economic losses Change construction design for buildings and infrastructure; avoid building homes in areas
where risks of floods are high.

A 15 per cent increase in the price of electricity, based
on 2002 data, would represent an annual cost of morethan £2 billion (see Table 2), just under half of it falling onthe private sector, and slightly more falling onhouseholds.
16
In a theme which keeps repeating itself, the most strikinginsight is the degree to which business is flying blindabout the likely impacts of across-the-board adaptation.The IPO (initial public offering) by company Xstrata is acase in point. This major coal mining firm’s ListingParticulars runs to 500 pages and yet climate changeissues receive only a fleeting mention in two paragraphs.Significantly no mention is made of emissions restrictionsor carbon tax or any other element of climate-related riskwhen discussing “Factors affecting the Business”.Although from the statements that are included, such as:“Commodity prices are significantly affected by changesin global economic conditions and related industrycycles” and “Prices of commodity products… can varysignificantly when supply and demand fluctuate” thesection is rather short on useful information of any sort.Xstrata had to defend itself against criticism for its lack ofdisclosure following the announcement by the JapaneseGovernment that it intended to impose a levy on coal aspart of its commitment to reduce GHG emissions. Xtrataplc’s share price fell 9 per cent in the space of an hour ofthis news and traded at a low of 490p, over40 per cent below its price on flotation.
17This information
should not, however, have come as a surprise to Xstrata,since Japan, one of Xstrata’s main customers, is a Kyotosignatory with a commitment to reducing carbonemissions by 8 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2012.
Similarly Alcan, in a Listing related to its merger with the
Alusuisse group, did not find space to discuss its CO
2
emissions, other than in the context of the potentialincreased demand for the aluminium that would berequired by automotive manufactures to reduce weight
and increase efficiency in response to concerns aboutCO
2emissions.18This ignored the fact that aluminium
production is a particularly intense source of GHGs, andhighly vulnerable to emissions legislation as a result.
Legal adaptation
Yetanother adaptation cost comes from the potential for
legal liability, as those affected by climate change seekredress in the courts from those they view as responsible.
As scientific predictions on global climate change becomemore certain, and courts become more willing to hearcases from overseas parties, these risks may increase. 
Already action is being brought before the US courts by
Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the City of BoulderColorado against the US Government. The plaintiffs claimthat two government agencies – the Export-Import Bankof the United States (Ex-Im) and the Overseas PrivateInvestment Corporation (OPIC) – have invested millionsof dollars in overseas fossil fuel projects therebycontributing to global warming in contravention of theNational Environmental Policy Act. 
Increasingly there is the potential for companies to face
lawsuits similar to those that have affected the tobaccoand asbestos industries, particularly where companies
are open to accusations of negligence in the face ofclear scientific evidence. Parallels have been drawn, forexample, between tobacco companies who knew oftobacco’s addictive properties yet made claims to the
contrary, and oil companies – specifically Exxon – whohave consistently attempted to undermine scientificfindings on climate change.
19
With the Kyoto Protocol now cleared to enter into force,there could be a logical adaptation and application ofinternational economic rules. Outgoing EU TradeCommissioner Pascal Lamy indicated recently thatbusinesses of non-ratifying countries like the US could besubjected to new trade restrictive measures from othertrading nations who have ratified the Protocol, in thename of levelling the economic playing field.
There have already been clear hints from Pascal Lamy,
outgoing EU Trade Commissioner, that Europe feels wellwithin its rights to use economic measures againstAmerica. The most likely economic weapons would beso-called ‘counter-subsidy’ measures or ‘border taxadjustments’. Both are acceptable in international tradewhere environmental agreements like Kyoto have beennegotiated in good faith. In direct response to such aproposal, Pascal Lamy’s reply was an example of the artof ‘denial, non-denial’. It was a “thought provokingcontribution”, he said, though at the time“counterproductive” to contemplate trade action while theEU was persuading Russia to ratify Kyoto. But then he
wrote, “There is a clear case for being aware of anyadverse effects on our industry and doing everything inour power to minimize these”, and further, “In that senseit is relevant also to keep under review the scope foraction under WTO rules to ‘level the playing field’.”
Reputation risk
An area in which companies have not been slow torecognise the risk to their immediate future is in relation
to the threat to their reputation and the threat to carefully

cultivated brand images. As the example of ExxonMobil
illustrates, it can be very damaging to brand image, salesand thereby market values to be seen as ‘environmentalenemy No.1’ – some estimates have put the value at riskfrom the ‘Stop Esso’ campaign at 10 per cent of itsmarket value. With consumers increasingly willing to joinin campaigns to boycott a company’s products,companies are increasingly careful to appear sensitive toenvironmental issues. 
Indeed the cynic might suggest that the vast majority of
corporate initiatives on climate change andenvironmental concerns generally are mere windowdressing aimed at mitigating just this type of risk. BMW,as a single example among many, makes much in itsadvertising and marketing literature of its commitment toand investments in fuel cell technology. Yet to date, not asingle vehicle is in production. The global value ofclimate-focused cause-related marketing might be seenas another adaptation cost.
Such figures are not available but Exxon, for example,
announced a $100 million endowment to StanfordUniversity for climate research, particularly technologicalsolutions. Many observers have suggested that this ismore of an attempt to buy back some of the reputationlost through involvement in opposition to the climatechange debate rather than a genuine acceptance that thecompany’s future may depend on such research activities.
Insurance
More than many other sectors, the insurance industry is atthe cutting edge of economic adaptation to climatechange. Global firms like Swiss Re and Munich Reprovide much of the original data on the economic costs
of extreme weather events. From the household level toglobal agricultural production it is through insurance thatthe true costs of adaptation are most likely to be revealed. 
Insurance estimates and rising dividend payments may
also provide the missing link in bringing legal claims forcompensation into the heart of the global warming issue.For example, when massive flooding hit Germany in thesummer of 2002, interior ministry officials estimated thedamage at €9 billion. One-third of a million people were
affected. In 2003, heatwaves in Paris killed more than11,000 people above the seasonal average, leaving
countless aggrieved relatives. And the only thing holdingback court claims has been the problem of attribution. 
Looking at how the insurance market works for science
journal Nature, Myles Allen from the physics department
at Oxford University suggests that problem is now largelysolved. “All you have to do”, he writes, “is work out a‘mean likelihood-weighted liability’ by averaging over allpossibilities consistent with currently availableinformation.” Unpacked, that means that if past GHGemissions increase flood risk tenfold, and a floodhappens, 90 per cent of subsequent damages can beattributed to past emissions. Because carbon dioxidemixes itself in the global commons of the atmosphere,“an equitable settlement would apportion liabilityaccording to emissions”.

As the Association of British Insurers (ABI) points out:
“Climate change is not a remote issue for future
generations to deal with. It is, in various forms, herealready, impacting on insurers’ businesses now.”

The ‘risk transfer mechanisms’ of insurance are likely to be
applied in various ways to deal with their increasingexposure to extreme weather; to insure new technologies,such as renewable energy assets; and to manage newliabilities like directors being held responsible for theenvironmental impact of their businesses in the future. 
For Britain alone, the ABI reports that weather risks are
increasing by 2–4 per cent per year for households andother property due to changing weather. Claims for stormand flood damages doubled to over £6 billion between1998 and 2003, compared to the previous five years.
Other insurance areas that saw rising claims fromclimate-related effects including rising motor insuranceclaims, and human health effects that could “influencethe balance between state and private provision of healthcare and pension products”. Overall, for the industry, withdamages hitting $150 billion per year in 10 years,insurers stand to be hit with at least $30–40 billion inclaims annually.
22
Insurance premiums are the reverse side of the coin ofclimate-related damage costs. They are deliberately long-term, so they are likely to represent a significant
adaptation cost. As we are locked into an inescapabledegree of climate change over the next 30–40 years dueto past emissions of greenhouse gases, the insurance
cost for particularly vulnerable infrastructure and sectorswill continue to rise. 
After flooding in autumn 2000, £25 million extra motor
claims were made. Without further action, the ABIestimates that river and coastal flooding damages couldincrease from £1 billion per year to £20 billion per year.
Building and construction
It’s increasingly evident following several severe floodingincidents in Europe and the United States that climatechange will have a significant impact on the builtenvironment.According to the UK Government, the value of domestic
property with a current one per cent risk of flooding isestimated at £200 billion. Floods in the winter of 2000/1were estimated to have cost the insurance industry £750million.
23Box 1 indicates the comprehensive range of
threats and likely measures needed for adaptation. There are enormous difficulties, and several unknowablefactors, in estimating what the cost of adapting existing
building stock, and ‘climate proofing’ new buildings will be.
But, as an example of what such costs might be, one
analysis by British-based environmental consultants ERMgives an indication. Technical problems with dealing witheconomic, environmental and political variables, and theclash between climatic uncertainties and the ‘need forprecision in defining design specifications forinfrastructure’ means the cost estimates are given over afairly wide range. Their conclusion was that Britain would
face a 1–5 per cent increase on current building costs
adding up to £26 billion ‘aggregated over the entirebuilding stock’. This estimate excludes the cost ofadapting new-build commercial stock.
24
If the estimate of 1–5 per cent of construction costs asadditional costs for adaptation to climate change in theUK is broadly representative of other OECD countries, thiswould suggest adaptation costs in this sector in the orderof US$15–74 billion per annum for OECD countries as awhole, around one-third of this arising in the US, andone-fifth in Japan.
Investments in early warning systems 
and weather forecasting
Catalysed by the progress of global warming, major new
investments are being made in climate warning andweather forecasting systems. At the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology (MIT) in the US they believe theyare close to finding the ‘Holy Grail of climate science’. Ajoint project potentially to be launched with NASA will be

11 Cast adriftProblem : Flooding of buildings will be more common
under climate change. Flooding leads to damage ofbuilding contents, possible contamination from sewage,and structural collapse. Some buildings could becomeuninsurable if they are in particularly flood-prone areas.
Problem : Increased rates of coastal erosion, due to sea-
level rise and storm surges, can have catastrophicconsequences for buildings in vulnerable locations.
Problem : Subsidence is expected to increase in buildings
on clay soils, due to higher temperatures, lower summerrainfall, and increased evapo-transpiration. 
Problem : If climate change leads to more frequent
depressions (storms), there will be increased structuraldamage to buildings. 
Problem : Increased driving rain will occur, affecting
building facades and internal structures and lead to morerain penetration around openings. More intense rainfallevents could lead to drainage systems (including roofdrainage, sewer systems, carriageway drainage etc.)being unable to cope. 
Problem : Higher ground temperatures would lead to
ground contaminants becoming more active, andconsequently attacking foundations. Climate change willaffect the durability of materials – in some cases theimpacts may be helpful, while others will be detrimental. 
Problem : Climate change is expected to reduce summer
rainfall, so that pressures on water resources are likely toincrease. 
Problem : Higher summer temperatures could lead to a
significant increase in the demand for air conditioning inbuildings, and hence in higher summer energy demand. 
Problem : Flooding on site is expected to become more
common.
Problem : When a building regulation comes up for
review, it is examined to see where it may be necessary
to revise the technical requirements, in the light of climate
change. 
Benefit and problem: Higher winter temperatures under
climate change would help reduce the UK’s death ratefrom hypothermia, and decrease winter energyconsumption. However, milder, more humid winters willlead to more mould growth in housing, which is already amajor course of respiratory allergies.Adaptation : Flooding can be avoided by careful siting of
buildings, and buildings can be protected byembankments, or designed to minimise damage, e.g.using water-resistant materials.
Adaptation : Improving coastal defences can alleviate local
problems, but they need to be carefully sited to avoidadverse consequences at adjacent areas of the coast.
Adaptation : New buildings should include improved
foundation design. Underpinning would reduce theeffects of subsidence in existing buildings.
Adaptation : The level of damage could be reduced if
more buildings were built to regulatory standards than isthe case at present. Higher building standards may beneeded in future, but careful design can also reduce theaerodynamic load on a building. For existing buildings, theoptions are more limited, and in some cases, retrofit ofnew roofs might need to be considered.
Adaptation : Drainage systems and drainage design
standards may need upgrading. Attenuation measures fordealing with surface water runoff, e.g. through the use ofsustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS), lagoons,and soakaways should be promoted.
Further research is needed.
Adaptation : Planning for new developments, particularly
intensive water users, will need to consider whether waterresources can meet their requirements and should aim to
improve water use efficiency.
Adaptation : Air conditioning should be seen as a ‘last
resort’ adaptation option. More favourable options are to
design-in more shading and natural ventilation, and toincrease the thermal mass of a building.
Adaptation : The construction process could adapt to the
impacts, however – for instance by increasingprefabrication.
Adaptation : Changes to building standards, codes and
regulations will help to avoid the worst potential impacts of
climate change, but dissemination to industry of informationabout climate change impacts is also important.
Benefit and problem: The implications of climate change
forthe construction process are in some cases, in the
short term, beneficial: less working days would be lost, asless snow and frost occur, but workers will be more likelyto suffer heat stress in summer.Box 1: Climate change impacts on buildings and adaptation

used to measure soil moisture which they describe as
“data needed to predict global change, assess globalwarming and support the Kyoto Protocol”. The project iscosting $218 million to design, build and launch. 
Such initiatives are key to adapting to the increasinglyvolatile weather patterns associated with climate change.Without them, vital economic sectors like agriculturebecome more vulnerable.
Citing the drought in the US Midwest in 1988 which
started in a small area, the MIT team explains how, “thesoil became dry and there was less evaporation, whichmeant less precipitation. Soon, crops and cattle were dyingas the drought spread. The opposite happened in 1993,when the Mississippi River flooded for weeks on end.”
Amongst industrialised countries, Canada has done more
work than most to address the issue of adaptation. Thegovernment body Environment Canada estimates that$150 billion of their nation’s economy is weather-sensitive.
25The observed rise in the number of weather-
related disasters has led to significant investment in
adaptation and forecasting.
Of actual spending on ‘Weather and Environmental
Predictions’ in the year 2002/3, $188.3 million (73 percent) went to reducing the impact of weather and relatedhazards on health, safety and the economy, and $71million (27 per cent) went on adaptation to day-to-dayand longer-term changes in atmospheric, hydrologicaland ice conditions.
An innovative scheme in Britain called U R @ RISK
promoted by the official body, the Environment Agency,in collaboration with the Met Office, involves sendingflood warnings to people by mobile phone text message,e-mail and through the digital TV sets.
26 The scheme is
funded by £2.7million of government money and has atarget to “deliver effective and timely flood warnings to80 per cent of those at risk by 2010”. The Agency andMet Office also contribute their own funds to the £3.9million total cost of the project over two years. Totalspending on flood management by central and localgovernment in the UK was budgeted at £492 million for2004/5 and £550 million in 2005/6.

Sea and river defencesThe impact of climate change on sea and river levels isone of the areas that policy-makers have not been ableto ignore, due to the imminent threat to important
infrastructure and housing. The most apparent cases aresmall islands under threat, but there are also someconsiderable losses to be made by not protecting theshores from mounting water levels in OECD countries. 
In the past century, the sea level rose by between 0.8 mm
per year and 3.0 mm per year in Europe, and it is expectedto continue to rise. Between 1990 and 2100 the projected
rate of sea-level rise is between 2.2 and 4.4 times higherthan the rate in the twentieth century.
28The United StatesIn the US, there are roughly 20,000 km (12,000 miles) ofcoastline and more than 32,000 km
2of coastal wetlands.
The land area of coastal counties comprises about 25per cent of the total land area of the United States, andaccounted for 53 per cent of the US population (141million people) in 1997. The size of the coastal zonepotentially at risk from sea-level rise is enormous andcould have disastrous consequences. 
Estimates of the cost of adapting to a half-metre sea-
level rise in the US have ranged from $20 billion to $138billion, where the southeast and mid-Atlantic coasts arethe most vulnerable. One estimate of the financial cost ofprotecting all developed areas from a half-metre sea-level rise is $50–66 billion, with $115–174 billion for aone-metre rise.
29Another estimate comes from a recent
OECD paper, which projects that the costs of adapting toa one-metre sea-level rise would amount to $156 billion,representing three per cent of GNP.
30
Not adapting has also proved costly. In 1993, for example,
water flows in the Mississippi and Missouri watershedexceeded all measures ever recorded, leaving a bill fordamages of between $12 billion and $16 billion.
31Not
surprisingly, insurance prices for coastal properties havefollowed suit and are increasing at a higher rate than the
value of all insured US properties. Between 1988 and
1993, the total value of insured property in coastal
counties from Maine to Texas increased by 69 per cent,from $1.9 trillion to $3.15 trillion.
32Roughly 1,500 homes
per year will be lost to coastal erosion for severaldecades, at a cost to property owners of $530 million. It isestimated that a half-metre sea-level rise by 2100 couldcause cumulative impacts to US coastal property of$20–150 billion, without even including the prospects ofincreased storm frequency or intensity.
33
EuropeA recent report from the European Commission highlightsthe 132,300 km under the direct threat of coastal erosionin the enlarged EU.
34Roughly one-third of this area is
rich in biodiversity and represents important ecosystems.Most of these sites are part of the EU’s NATURA 2000network of protected areas. The total value of economicassets located in the threatened area, which includesbeaches, agricultural land and industrial facilities, isbetween €500 billion and €1,000 billion.
The report shows that 875 km of the enlarged EU
coastline started to erode within the past 20 years andthat the adaptation costs are increasing: in 2001 theywere estimated to be €3.2 billion.

Overall, some 12,200 km of the EU’s coastline is eroding –
nearly one-fifth of the total – the worst affected countries
(in absolute terms) being Greece, the UK and Italy. If thecosts of coastal protection in the EU were similar to thoseforthe US, estimated at $500–2,600 per metre (but much
more for sea walls and bulkheads whose price rangegoes up to $13,200 per metre),
36the overall cost would
be between $6 billion and $32 billion (see Table 5).
There are numerous other ‘spot’ costs and estimates that
have been made. This is a selection.
/L50098Italy — The high economic value of the Italian coast
makes it particularly vulnerable to sea-level rises. If
the sea rises by 100 cm by 2100, Italy will need toprotect almost its entire coast. One way of doing thiswould be to reconstruct the pre-existing dune as afirst barrier to sea-level rise, which would cost about€30–50 million. In addition, houses worth €30–50
million would need to be demolished and there arealso other additional costs, where no cost estimate isavailable.
38The present value of the area at risk of
permanent flooding between 2002 and 2100 variesfrom €130 million to €270 million.
39
/L50098The Netherlands — The Netherlands has already
suffered from substantial flooding damages, and thepotential for more is huge. Estimates show that losses inthe order of €100 billion resulting from sea floods and
€50 billion for river floods are conceivable. Relatively
minor river flooding in December 1993 (loss of €100
million) and January 1995 resulted in total losses of€180 million. In September 1998, heavy rainfall
occurred which caused losses of some €500 million.
40
A staggering 67 per cent of the population in TheNetherlands would be affected by a one-metre sea-level rise. To protect the affected area would costabout $12 billion, or 5 per cent of GNP.
41Some
staggering amounts have already been paid or areprojected for protection against flooding. Theconstruction of embankments in the province ofLimburg in 1995 ended up costing about €80 million.
The costs of flood protection of the Zandmaas/Maasroute have been estimated between €380
million and €1,045 million.
42
However, the concern is not just about rising sealevels. Climate change could enhance the risk ofpersistent drought, with corresponding low waterlevels. This could have substantial effect on transport,which could lead to a 10 per cent increase intransport costs by 2050. The annual costs of transporton the River Rhine could rise with between €80
million and €600 million.

/L50098UK—There are approximately 21 million properties in
England and Wales, of which around 1.8 million
homes and 130,000 commercial properties are at riskfrom inland or coastal flooding, along with 5 millionpeople. Together with agricultural land at risk, theserepresent assets in the region of £220 billion.
44
Over the past 6 years, storm and flood losses in theUK have exceeded £6 billion – twice the previousperiod. The Government’s Foresight report shows that
if no action is taken against climate change, theannual average damages from river and coastalflooding could increase from the current figure of £1billion to between £2 billion and £21 billion. Theincreasing risk posed by coastal erosion is the maindriver behind increased national flood risk.
45
The risk is now so high that the ABI is worried aboutbeing able to cope. The Environment Agency will objectto any planning application that is not accompanied by
its own Flood Risk Assessment in local authority areasthat are not guided by a Strategic Flood RiskAssessment. The lack of an appropriate Flood RiskAssessment currently accounts for over half of allsustained objections from the Agency. The targeting ofnew developments in Thames Gateway has led totime-consuming and costly processes for individualdevelopers, costing around £50,000 per assessment.
46
The Environment Agency has estimated that the
costs of upgrading the Thames’ flood defences couldbe between £4 billion and £6 billion over the next 20years. However, these figures are likely to be grosslyunderestimated, as they have been calculated withoutincorporating any impacts of climate change onpresent-day storm-surge heights.
47DEFRA
(Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs)
has a long-term strategy to invest about £5 billion incoastal infrastructure between 2000 and 2015.
48
However, despite the scale of these figures, the ABI isconcerned that it is not enough. For example, it pointsout that the £4–6 billion required to fund the upgrade inflood defences for the Thames Estuary over the next 20years would take over half the national flood defencebudget if no contribution from new developments wereincluded. The Government’s Foresight report suggests
that a real increase in expenditure of £10 million to £30million each year would be required to manage floodrisk over the century and that by 2020, expenditurewould need to be closer to £1 billion per year.
/L50098Germany, Japan, and Poland — The adaptation/
protection cost for Germany for a one-metre sea-levelrise is estimated at $23.5 billion, which represents 2.2per cent of GNP.
49
The adaptation/protection cost for Japan for a one-metre sea-level rise is estimated at up to $156 billion,representing up to 12 per cent of GNP.
50The total
expenditure to keep the present level of functions andstability for about 1,000 Japanese ports is estimatedto be $110 billion in the event of a one-metre sea-

Drainage
Drainage costs, due to rising sea levels around Italy areestimated between €50 million and €100 million. This is
cheaper than doing nothing, as potential damages areestimated at €130 million to €270 million, although it is
believed that the adaptation cost is reasonably low, as thedrainage system is already developed and works well.
53
The ABI has pointed out that it is essential that UK watercompanies be allowed to raise the necessary funds(£1.2 billion according to their draft business plans) tomaintain and improve their assets to reduce theincidence of sewer flooding.
54
In Toronto, Canada, adaptation costs for wastewatertreatment are estimated between CAN$633 million andCAN$9.4 billion, depending on risk aversion, while thoseforNiagara are CAN$8–24 million, Halifax and Penticton
are estimated at CAN$8–14 million, around CAN$6.5million and CAN$15–28.5 million respectively. However,no adaptation costs are anticipated in Montreal orYellowknife.
55
Based on draining projects in the Ottawa area, it is
estimated that each 5 per cent increase in rainfall intensityincreases the cost of pipes by 4–8 per cent and the costof end-of-pipe storage by between 10 and 35 per cent.
56
The cost of adapting the drainage system in the Fondi plainin Italy to an expected rise in the sea level is estimated at€50–100 million over the course of the next century.
57
Health
While no comprehensive picture exists for healthadaptation costs, indications can be drawn from relatedexperiences. But changes to extreme weather patternsand new vector-borne diseases will bring inevitableadaptation costs.
58
In the summer of 2003, an estimated 11,435 people diedin France when a record-breaking heatwave struck in thefirst two weeks of August. A ministry of health report onthe response of the public health system found a “lack ofanticipation, organization and coordination”. Respondingto the report, Health Minister Jean-François Mattei,
announced $748 million in extra funding for hospitalemergency services.
59
Malaria was officially eradicated in Europe in 1975 but isexperiencing a come-back, with 12,000 cases per year inWestern Europe. According to the World Health
Organisation’s Roll Back Malaria (RBM) GlobalPartnership, launched in 1998, fighting malaria canaccount for 40 per cent of government spending onpublic health. Poor families in the developing worldspend up to 25 per cent of their annual income ontreatment and prevention of malaria. The RBM initiativeestimates that it will take “$2 billion per year to financeeffective malaria control in Africa, and $1 billion per yearforother malaria-endemic areas”.
60
Despite the lack of a comprehensive cost estimate for
adaptation in the North, a picture emerges of the scale ofthe challenge. Picture these examples repeated acrossthe developed world and the predicament facing
developing countries is clear. In the US city ofPhiladelphia, its Hot Weather Health Watch/WarningSystem is estimated to have cost $50,000–60,000 to setup in 1995, with annual direct operating costs of $75,000in 1995–98, rising to $115,000 in 2002.
61
Another estimate for the cost of developing and installinga heat warning system in Rome, Italy is between $50,000and $75,000.
62Health Canada recently supported three
projects totalling $700,000 to integrate research andpolicy on climate change and health.
63
Analysing all the health-related outcomes of climatechange and predicting human response to thoseoutcomes may sound like an impossible task, but the USEnvironmental Protection Agency has enlisted dozens ofresearchers from 11 universities and public institutions to
do just that. The Climate Change and Human Healthwebsite stems from a $3 million Environmental ProtectionAgency grant to Johns Hopkins University, and fulfils oneof the Agency’s main objectives. “One of the key purposesof the grant was to make this information public,” explainsRebecca Freeman, a doctoral student in the Department ofGeography and Environmental Engineering at JohnsHopkins, and the creator of the website.
64
Water
Watershed degradation will be a common feature of a
warming world. New York City’s decision to invest inupgraded protection of its Catskills watershed gives anindication of the kind of costs involved in such majorprojects. Building a filtration plant was estimated to cost$6–8 billion, with annual operating costs of $300 millionwhile repairing the degraded watershed would take “$1billion to $1.5 billion, for land acquisition, new watershedrules and regulations, and financial assistance towatershed communities to promote environmental qualityand their local economies”.
65
One Libyan project to pipe water 1,000 km from thesouthern Nubian Desert to the Mediterranean wasestimated to cost $25 billion, but because the groundwaterwould have run out in 40–60 years, it was abandoned.
66A
water pipeline from Alaska to Lake Shasta, California(2,200 km), another adaptation measure in the face ofclimate change, would have cost US$110 billion.
67
Other proposed projects include some short-distancecross-border water sales (Canada–US) by pipeline, e.g.,from Coutts, Alberta to Sweetgrass, Montana. The USArmy Corps of Engineers investigated water transfer fromMississippi/Missouri to High Plains.
68
AgricultureOne cruel twist of global warming is that many of the richcountries responsible could, in the short-to-medium term,benefit agriculturally, with a longer growing season andthe chance to extend the range of crops grown. Thesame cannot be said for much of Africa which faces adrop in the productivity of its farming. 
15 Cast adrift

However, the shape of agricultural adaptation in the
North is also highly uncertain. As Britain’s Ministry ofAgriculture Food and Fisheries said in 2000:
“Even small changes in precipitation will have
profound consequences for plant production…Decreased spring and summer rainfall would haveserious implications, decreasing crop watersupply, especially in light soils, increasing moisturestress and reducing growth. The impact onhorticultural crops would be severe. Demand forirrigation would probably increase.”
69
One of the perverse possibilities of a warming climate forEurope is a new mini-ice age that could result if the Gulf
Stream that warms Britain and Western Europe is‘switched off’. In this case the challenge and cost ofadaptation are likely to be great. 
Any change in the climate, however, is likely to involve
investments in agricultural technology; funds needed todevelop new equipment; costs for disseminatinginformation; education costs; the cost of climateinformation; and higher, per-unit costs of water.
70
The cost of agricultural adaptation to the current climatein Canada has been estimated at over $1.3 billion, andthe costs of other adaptations, for example, cropinsurance, irrigation, research and development, are alsolikely to increase under climate change.
71
A range of water-related problems point to the need for:“improving irrigation systems and adjusting the selectionof planting dates and cultivars… longer and warmergrowing seasons may allow earlier planting andharvesting dates” to avoid arid late summer conditions.
According to the Canadian government, “thesestrategies, along with water transfers and changes tocrop insurance programs, are adaptation options oftensuggested for dealing with future climate changes.”
72
To help farming adapt to changing climate conditions, in
1996–97 the Agricultural Research Institute of Ontario
(ARIO) received CAN$42,356,784 from the OntarioGovernment for research purposes. A year earlier thefederal government earmarked CAN$276.1 million for the
Research Branch of Agriculture and Agri-food Canada.
73
An estimate for the benefit of adapting US agriculture toclimate change was put at US$7–11 billion.
74
FisheriesGlobally, while many key fish stocks are already underthreat due to over-fishing, there is a reported degree ofoptimism about fisheries’ ability to adapt to climatechange. This, however, may be due to an assumption“that changes are gradual and predictable”, which maynot be the case.
75
The challenge will then be to adapt: in living ecosystemspopulations can crash or relocate suddenly in responseto new environmental signals. Adaptive interventions are
needed. For example, Canada spent $15 million in 2000dredging the Great Lakes in response to low water levels.
Tourism
Reliable weather is often one of the guiding principles fora tourist’s decision to go to a particular destination. So far,the tourism industry has been slow to react to thechallenges that climate change holds in store, despite the
16 Cast adrift

17 Cast adriftfact that over half of the world’s 715 million international
tourist arrivals (2002) are concentrated in relatively few
destinations, most which are part of the OECD. Over 50per cent of the arrivals go to only ten destinations: the US,Germany, the UK, Japan, France, Italy, China, TheNetherlands, Canada and Belgium/Luxembourg.
76
In Europe, cold winters are expected to more or lessdisappear by 2008 and hot summers are expected tobecome more frequent. Ski resorts in the northernhemisphere have for some time been experiencing lessand less snow and it has been estimated that the annualsnow cover has decreased by about 10 per cent since1966. The snow cover period shortened by about a week
between 1971 and 1994 and this trend is likely tocontinue over the twenty-first century. Glaciers are alsocurrently retreating, which will affect summer skiing inglacial regions.
77
The European skiing industry is slowly waking up to theneed for adaptation, but there remains a lot of scepticism.A focus-group study among tourism representatives inSwitzerland revealed that while climate change was aknown phenomenon, the information disseminated on thesubject wasn’t trusted. On the other hand, they did useclimate change to legitimately forward strategies, whichimplies that some form of adaptation is already takingplace, although not on a large or measurable scale.
78
The impact of climate change on the skiing industry inAustralia, Canada and the US is not expected to be ashigh as in Europe, due to an already high level of artificialsnowmaking. However, the economic impact ofadditional snowmaking requirements remains animportant uncertainty. In Canada, the average ski seasonin a case study area was projected to reduce by up to 16
per cent in the 2020s and up to 32 per cent in the2050s. Snowmaking would increase by up to 144 percent in the 2020s and up to 187 per cent in the 2050s.Without snowmaking, the season would reduce up to 57per cent in the 2050s.
79
Areas that are currently regarded to have a pleasantsummer climate, like the Mediterranean, are alsoexpected to suffer as the destinations become too hot.Sea-level rise is another problem that could put popularbeaches under water, thus diverting tourists elsewhere.Northern Europe is sometimes seen as an alternative,but unpredictable weather makes this less likely. Extremeweather conditions will also take their toll on sensitivemonuments and buildings, leading to faster deteriorationand increased conservation costs.
What is far more apparent than adaptation costs is the
scale of income loss for tourism destinations expectedfrom changes in the climate. On average, eachinternational arrival in Europe generates an estimatedexpenditure of $580, excluding transport costs. A changein tourism flows could have substantial effects onEuropean economies. It is estimated that the
Mediterranean might forego between 111 and 198 millionarrivals by 2050 due to climate change, amounting to$64–110 billion in receipts.
80 In the US, for example,
recreational beach visits account for almost 200 million
visitor days per year. The total annual value of these visitshas been estimated to be over $3 billion, something thatcould be under threat due to sea-level rise and increasedtemperatures.
81In Switzerland, it is estimated that the
potential annual cost of climate change accounted for bytourism could be as high as $1.2 to $1.6 billion.
82


18 Cast adriftAgainst the meagre pledge of $0.41 billion in additional
funds to help poor countries adapt to the problem, richcountries are making billions available to protectthemselves. France alone is spending nearly twice thatfigure to adapt its health service in response to just onesevere heatwave in 2003.
In the UK, official adaptation priorities are
comprehensively laid out.
83They cover coastal and river
flood defence programmes, where spending alreadyexceeds the total new amount committed to help thewhole of the developing world. But also:
/L50098Improved water resource management.
/L50098Enhanced resilience of building and infrastructure.
/L50098Management of wildlife, forestry and agriculture.
/L50098Co-ordinated approaches to planning.
/L50098Awareness raising of climate change impacts.
/L50098Improved long-term and short-term risk prediction.
Given rich countries historical responsibility for global
warming, and the resources at their disposal, at the veryleast we believe that funds available for adaptationshould be raised substantially. But to what level? Weneed to take account of the globally agreed MillenniumDevelopment Goals for poverty reduction, which havetheir own costs attached, costs far higher than the natureand level of current aid programmes will pay for.Excluding health and sanitation this calls for an extra $50billion per year. The additional costs of adapting to climate change are
unknown. An initial assessment based on the bestavailable predictions for various scenarios of warming is
needed. Until that happens, however, rich countriescould, as a minimum, make additional funds availableequal to the amount they use to subsidise their domesticpolluting fossil fuel industries. Using the late 1990s as abenchmark, a conservative estimate suggests that richcountries’ fossil fuel subsidies stood at around $73 billionper year.
84That would, perhaps, be a good place to
begin the upward bidding.Conclusion
The purpose of this briefing is two-fold. First, it is to
show the comprehensive scale of adaptations thatwill be required the world over in the face of globalwarming. And, secondly, it highlights the shamefulabdication of responsibility by industrialisedcountries, overwhelmingly responsible for creatingthe problem, to pay to help others, with far fewerresources, live with it.

Current priorities are climate change,
ecological debt and local sustainability
nefis leading this campaign
characterised by a highly diversemembership that seeks to combatthe spectre of ‘Ghost Town Britain’. It promotes the importance of localsustainability and self-determination.For example, Local Works was a bigpart of the campaign to defendcommunity pharmacies. Taking as astarting point the fact that local
communities should be more in chargeof their own economies, education,healthcare, consumer and leisureneeds, Local Works is campaigning fora legal framework that can make
this happen.The needs of communities must be at
the heart of environmental, social andpolitical justice. At a time of growingdisenchantment with political processes,individuals and communities can andshould have a real impact on howmoney is spent in their communitiesand what they invest in. Having atangible impact on the delivery ofservices is a vital tool for political,social, environmental and economicreinvigoration in all of our communities.
Local Works recognises that there 
is no single blueprint, but thatcommunities should draw up andimplement their own plans to achievethese goals.

Local Works: Local people must be put back at the heart
of their local economies. Policies that favour the largeand remote are threatening the vibrancy and diversity ofour communities, bringing Ghost Town Britain. Giving realpower to local people can reinvigorate our local rural and urban economies.One of the other things we do
