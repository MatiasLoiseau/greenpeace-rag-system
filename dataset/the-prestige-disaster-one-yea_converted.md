Never again another Prestige

Far away from the press headlines, an almost silent battle is being fought between
those who profit from the business of transporting hazardous substances by sea and
those of us who defend drastic measures to prevent new oil slicks. Ever since the
Prestige began to pour lethal fuel into the Atlantic one year ago, little has changed
in legal terms. Although the European Union has forbidden the entry of single-hulled
ships carrying heavy fuel into European ports, this type of fuel represents only
around 5% of all the oil products that enter Europe. Nevertheless, the International
Maritime Organisation (IMO) has already hit the roof over this timid initiative.

A change in the regime of responsibility has not even been contemplated by the
EU or the IMO. With things as they are, unlimited responsibility in accidents such
as that of the Prestige continues to sound like a Utopia. Where is Crown
Resources today? Once again, people and the environment have paid and will
continue to pay a high price whilst those that profit from the traffic of crude oil
hide behind unapproachable legal structures.

One year after the catastrophe, we now know that the European coastline had
never before suffered so much as the result of an oil slick: over 2,000 kilometres
of coast affected, hundreds of thousands of birds covered in oil and, one year
later, the fuel continues to reach our shores. The figures are staggering and not
even the tireless propaganda efforts of certain leaders have managed to convince
us that “nothing happened here”.

With this report, Greenpeace looks back, once again, and reviews the year that
has passed since the Prestige. However, above all, we want to look forward and
propose specific measures that will prevent another Prestige from happening.
Our proposals are ambitious but indispensable and range from the protection of
coastal areas in order to ensure their recovery to changes in the preventive inter-
national maritime legislation. It would be shameful if, after so much damage,
nothing were to change.

The next oil slick is waiting to happen. The question we ask ourselves is not whe-
ther or not it will happen, but when and where. We want to stop asking this ques-
tion. We want things to change. That is the reason behind this report. That is the
reason behind the proposals it contains. We hope that they do not fall on deaf ears.

The Prestige Disaster
O n e Ye a r O n

Executive Summary

a
a

t 3.15 p.m. on 13th November
2002, the 26-year-old, single-
hulled oil tanker Prestige,
flying the Bahamian flag and
loaded with 77,000 tonnes of
residual heavy fuel oil, sent out
an SOS at a distance of 28
miles (50 kilometres) from
Finisterre, Galicia, Spain. At five o’clock that
afternoon, the first litres of crude oil began to
pollute the Atlantic Ocean.

oo

One year later, the remains of the slick,
the sadly famous “chapapote”, “pichi”
or “galipote”, depending on the stretch
of coast where it comes to shore,
continues to appear like a never-ending
tide on the Atlantic coast1

Studies such as “El Impacto del Prestige”2,
carried out by scientists from Galician
universities, reveal a particular concern about the
current situation. The authors, who also studied
the repercussions of the sinking of the Mar Egeo
ship off the coast of A Coruña in 1992, estimate
that the damage caused by the Prestige is even
greater. The enormous loss of bird life, between
250,000 and 300,000 specimens according to
estimates by the Spanish Ornithology Society
(SEO/BirdLife), indicates that we are talking of
the greatest catastrophe of this type ever
suffered in Europe and the second most serious
in the world after the wildlife deaths caused by
the Exxon Valdez in Alaska in 1989. The research
done by these experts indicates that, from an
economic point of view, the Prestige disaster
actually exceeds that of the Exxon Valdez since
the cost of the cleaning and recovery work could
total 2,500 million euros, compared to the 1,800
million spent in Alaska.

According to the predictions of expert scientists
in this area, the socio-economic and
environmental repercussions of the oil slick will
continue to be felt for at least a decade along

the 2,000 kilometres of coast that have been
affected. The entire Cantabrian and Galician
Atlantic coasts have seen their shores seriously
damaged by the arrival of countless waves of
crude oil. The spill has blackened beaches and
cliffs, eliminated some of the marine life, either
directly (due to mortalities) or indirectly (many
free-moving organisms fled when faced with
the presence of the hydrocarbon). It has also
jeopardised the quality of the waters, which will
take many years to recover the characteristics
necessary for marine life to develop as it was
before the environmental disaster.

Despite this serious situation, the Spanish
government has still not presented a
comprehensive recovery plan which would serve
to speed up the environmental, economic and
social recovery of the affected coastline.
Furthermore, there has been no change in the
international global regulatory regime which
could prevent similar accidents in the future.

The Prestige disaster must serve as a salutary
lesson and lead to a change in direction. This is
how it must be understood by those that
manage economic and environmental resources.
The Cantabrian and Galician coasts have been a
source of wealth for hundreds of years, both in
terms of resources and employment. Now they
are more vulnerable than ever and their very
structure and function are under threat.

We must use all the expertise and resources
necessary in order to prevent such a huge-scale
disaster from ever happening again. The Spanish
government must understand the role that the
marine environment plays in the natural
biological balance and must give priority to the
environmental, economic and social recovery of
the affected area as a whole.

A fair measure of the Spanish government’s
scarce interest is the amount of money invested
in evaluating the catastrophe caused by the
Prestige. The Ministry of Science and
Technology has implemented research
programmes which total, according to several
sources close to the government, less than 10
million euros. The amount spent by the North

American government in evaluating and
monitoring the oil slick caused by the Exxon
Valdez came close to 400 million dollars. Forty
times the budget for the Prestige.

This would require the development of an
environmental monitoring system for the affected
ecosystems. The measures put forward so far by
the government are partial and fragmentary and
in many cases they completely overlook the
natural areas that have been affected. This is true
of the so-called “Plan Galicia”, a combination of
costly infrastructures (ports, roads and railways)
which are totally unrelated to the recovery
programmes needed by the Galician and
Cantabrian coasts.

In order to prevent new oil slicks in coastal
areas, it is essential to force the shipping
industry to operate with the greatest safety
guarantees, to control maritime traffic,
strengthen safety measures and control
pollution from the land.

Greenpeace believes that urgent action
is necessary in order to prevent
catrastrophes like that of the Prestige
from happening again on our coasts.
To achieve this, it is essential for
solutions to be implemented which will
prevent new disasters. Greenpeace also
considers the complete recovery of the
affected ecosystems to be urgently
necessary.

oo

Together with these measures, the recovery of the
areas affected by the pollution must not be further
delayed . The Spanish government, in collaboration
with the scientific and fishing community, must
prepare a comprehensive plan by which to restore
the affected areas. Scientific and technical
knowledge must be employed to lessen the effects
of the spill and accelerate the recovery of the
damaged coastal ecosystems, something which
will, without doubt, benefit those economies that
are linked to the marine environment.

This protection will accelerate the recovery of
the damaged natural environment, as well as
all its inhabitants.

Currently, along the 2,000 kilometres of coast
affected by the Prestige, there are only two
protected marine reserves: the Islas Atlánticas,
which have the protected status of a National
Park, and a small area on the Basque coast, the
protected biotope of Gaztelugatxe. The lack of
protected marine reserves must be remedied
quickly, as was demanded by the European
Union in a report recently presented to the
European Parliament.

The Spanish government, and some other EU
States did propose that the International
Maritime Organisation (IMO) establish a
Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) that
would help protect the area from dangerous
ships in the Atlantic. A dozen countries
belonging to the IMO have expressed their
opposition to this proposal, thereby
demonstrating the scarce importance that these
governments give to environmental issues.

In the scientific world, there exists a general
consensus regarding the beneficial effect of
protecting areas of particular biological value.

The final decision regarding this proposal for
protection will be taken in October 2004. Even if
the measure is finally approved, it is clearly not

enough to ensure the recovery of the area
affected by the oil slick since other threats will
remain, as is acknowledged by many countries,
even those that oppose the declaration of a
protected marine reserve. The Spanish
government has a duty and obligation to
implement all necessary measures within its
sphere of activity, where it cannot be denied the
right to create protected areas which will help
to prevent new catastrophes and will benefit
the environmental and economic recovery of the
affected areas.

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO)
is the UN body charged with the task of
protecting the oceans and human life from the
activities of the shipping industry. Following the
sinking of the Prestige, and earlier the Erika,
there was a recognition among the public and
some authorities that the current regulations
were inadequate to ensure protection of the
environment, lives and livelihoods. It is clear
that a range of measures need to be
implemented urgently which would increase the
quality of shipping. These include:

The regime of responsibility that arises from
an accident. The current compensation
system is based on the limited financial
responsibility of the owner of the vessel,
according to the tonnage of the ship. Under
the current system, this responsibility is
restricted exclusively to the shipowner whilst
the managers, charterers, operators and
owners of the load (which, in the case of oil
slicks, are usually large multinational oil
companies) are entirely exempt of all
responsibility. Following the case of the
Exxon Valdez (property of Exxon-Mobil) and
the Erika (property of the company Total
Fina), in which the affected countries
demanded that the oil companies accepted
their responsibility for the oil slick caused,
the reaction of these companies did not lead
to an increase in safety but instead quite the
opposite. The large oil companies have
gradually reduced their safety measures in
order to evade their responsibilities. Although
governments and industry should fully

comply with the polluter pays principle, the
reality is that the financial liability paid by
commercial interests is absurdly low. The real
cost is The international community fulfils
the requirement that “he who pollutes,
pays” but forgets to mention that the
amount paid is absurd and that the rest of
the cost is borne by the citizens and the
environment on which they and their
livelihoods depend. In this context, it
becomes clear that the interest in investing
to improve ship safety is minimal.
The rapid phase out of single-hulled tankers
worldwide.
The establishment of Particularly Sensitive
Sea Areas (PSSAs) for the most vulnerable
coastlines.
A more robust and transparent inspection
and maintenance regime including the
publication of classification society survey
results.
Closure of loopholes such as the use of Flags
of Convenience whereby shipowners can
avoid their responsibilities by flagging a
vessel with a county in which the standards
are lowest.

Greenpeace demands the creation
of a network of protected marine
reserves along the entire length of
the coast affected by the Prestige
disaster, as one of the solutions to
enable the recovery of the ecosystems
affected by the oil spill.

o

o

These are some of the measures which need to
be implemented globally by the IMO. However,
in the absence of any moves by the IMO, the
EU has taken some steps, albeit limited, in
calling for an early phase out of single-hulled
tankers carrying heavy fuel oil. The EU has also
proposed certain Marine Protected Areas.
While neither of these measures go far
enough, they are at least more than has been
taken by the IMO.

Repercussions of the Prestige oil slick

O

il slicks are occasional but intense
cases of pollution. The short-term
effects, obvious and spectacular, are
followed by other medium- and long-
term effects which are less visible but
generally more important from an
ecological and economic point of view3.

o

One year after the accident involving the
Prestige, the impact caused by the spillage is
clear. The serious pollution of almost 2,000
kilometres of coast is not a fleeting occurrence
that can be forgotten.

Images of the sea, beaches and cliffs covered in
black are not merely pictures engraved in our
minds. Their consequences cover a series of
economic, health-related, social and
environmental issues which must be taken into
account.

In the report “Prestige: Seis meses después”
(Prestige: Six months afterwards) Greenpeace
protested at the lack of information about the
impact of the spillage on the affected
ecosystems. Six months on, we cannot say that
the situation has improved noticeably. Very little
is known about the studies that are being
carried out by the administration to assess the
repercussions of the oil slick. Nor has it made
public any recovery plans or measures dealing
with the issues and sectors affected, such as
food safety, tourism or social repercussions.

The sectors that are directly related with the
marine environment, fishing, shellfishing and
tourism, are already suffering the effects of the
Prestige oil slick. However, they are not alone,
since the economy and well-being of all the
affected communities have suffered indirect effects.

An evaluation is necessary of the health of the
volunteers who collected the remains of the oil
slick, as well as that of the coastal population
which has suffered the impact of the fuel. In
addition to public health, food safety also
requires great attention. Analyses have shown

that the fuel oil spilled by the Prestige is
highly toxic. Its composition includes substances
that are classed as being highly dangerous for
human health, such as polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), for which neither Spain
nor Europe has yet decreed limits regarding
their presence in food. These limits have only
been established by the Galician Autonomous
Government, however they have not been
converted into regulations and are not,
therefore, official4.

The Prestige Disaster
O n e Ye a r O n

At the end of February, Greenpeace demanded
that the Ministry of Health carry out an
epidemiological study which would allow the
risks for human health to be evaluated. In mid-
March, the Ministry announced that it would do
so, however it appears to have forgotten its
promise since the study has still not been
performed.

The deterioration of the coastal areas and
marine environment cannot be ignored. It is not
enough to fill the beaches with machines that
will clear away the lumps of fuel. The effects
suffered at all levels of the ecosystem must be
studied and evaluated and measures must be
taken to speed its recovery.

o

Heavy fuel oil from the Prestige
continues to reach the coasts of
Galicia, the North of the Iberian
peninsula and the French Atlantic,
going beyond Brittany and even
threatening the English coastline.

o

European Parliament report on reinforcing maritime safety
following the sinking of the Prestige oil tanker. 15 July 2003.

An analysis of all these repercussions is the first
step in preventing another Prestige from
happening. It is essential that a serious
evaluation be made of the affected ecosystems.
From a biological point of view, a reduction in
certain species and a decline in the marine
habitat has been observed, as acknowledged in
the report on the Prestige catastrophe that
was presented to the European Parliament in
September5.

When it came to evaluating the effects, the
administration clearly chose to marginalise the
scientific community, right from the very start.
The scientific work that has been carried out
until now has not been framed within a
comprehensive recovery plan organised by the
public administration.

The impact of the Prestige according
to the ministry of the environment/

Until now, the Ministry of the Environment has only offered
information  regarding  the  number  of  beaches  affected,
which  has  totalled  1,064  since  the  start  of  the  disaster.
According  to  these  figures, on  the  2nd  October, 1,053  of
these  beaches  were  considered  to  be  completely  clean, 9
had remains of hydrocarbons on rocks and/or in underlying
layers and 2 had fuel remains on the surface. With regard to
the waste collected, by that same date 83,751.28 tonnes
had  been  removed  from  the  1,900  kilometres  of  affected
coastline. The  Ministry  of  the  Environment  deals  with  the
Islas  Atlánticas  National  Park  separately. In  this  area, by
19th September, 4,589.9 tonnes of waste had been remo-
ved from the land and 1,593.5 tonnes had been extracted
from the seabed6.

Nothing is said about the effects of this pollution on the
affected  coastal  ecosystems, information  is  only  given
about  the  presence  or  absence  of  fuel. As  of  now, no
information whatsoever has been provided referring to stu-
dies that are being carried out to analyse the impact and
repercussions in the short, medium and long term.

Some of the steps taken by the Ministry, such as the deci-
sion to open the Islas Atlánticas National Park to tourists
this summer, call into question its interest in restoring the
affected  environment. Shortly  after  it  was  opened, the
Director  of  the  park, Emilio  Rodríguez  Merino, himself
admitted that the decision had been hasty and that 3,000
visitors  each  day  were  not  what  the  islands  needed  in
order to recover.

The  Ministry  of  the  Environment  has  assured  that  it  will
carry out a detailed study over three years to evaluate the
exact  impact  of  the  oil  slick  on  various  parts  of  the
Galician coast, in order to adopt, where necessary, appro-
priate measures7.

The  information  obtained  by  Greenpeace  limits  these
“various parts” to the Islas Atlánticas National Park, two
other protected nature reserves in Galicia and one in each
of  the  affected  autonomous  regions: Asturias, Cantabria
and the Basque Country. There is no doubt that these stu-
dies  will  be  insufficient  to  provide  an  overall  understan-
ding of the phenomenon. The Ministry of the Environment
announced  that  it  would  be  contracting  assistance  in
order  to  complete  the  studies, however  these  contracts
have still not been awarded despite the fact that the pro-
posals  were  presented  in  August. One  of  the  proposals
came  from  a  company  chaired  by  Carlos  del  Álamo, who
was  removed  from  his  post  as  Regional  Minister  for  the
Environment in the Galician Autonomous Government due
to his poor conduct during the oil slick. To the surprise of
many, the Ministry of the Environment later appointed Del
Álamo as President of the Islas Atlánticas National Park.

Impact upon organisms and marine communities8

o

The ecological effects of a hydrocarbon spill
depend essentially on the type of habitat
affected. In the case of the Prestige, the route
followed by the ship before it sank combined
with the location of the area in which it lies
submerged, mean that practically all marine
habitats have been and are still in danger.

One must remember that pollution is not evenly
distributed in a marine context. Therefore, if we
look at the ecosystem vertically, the amount of
hydrocarbons increases as we approach the
seabed, whereas in horizontal terms, the
concentration increases as we head towards
coastal areas.

Hydrocarbon spills cause different physiological
and biochemical problems in the affected
organisms which have consequences for their
viability and reproductive success, whilst also
provoking genetic alterations. As a result of
these processes, their populations undergo
demographic changes.

The effects of spill pollution on organisms may
be classified in the following way:

Direct lethal effects: caused by fuel
impregnation or asphyxia.

Direct sublethal effects: caused by direct
contact between the pollutant and the
organism, without causing death.
Nonetheless, genetic, biochemical or
physiological alterations do occur which may
reduce viability and biological efficiency.

Indirect effects: disruption of the ecosystem.
The main processes to be affected include
alterations in the habitat, changes in the
relationship between predators and their prey
and between competitors, alterations in
productivity levels and, lastly, changes in the
trophic network.

9Ott. R., C. Peterson & R.Rice. Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) legacy: Shifting
paradigms in oil ecostoxicology.

In general, there is not a lot of evidence of the
direct effects of oil slicks, except in the case of
catastrophic seabird mortalities, the smothering
of coastal flora and fauna especially sedentary
species. The other effects are much more difficult
to detect, above all in the case of ocean regions,
since these are habitats which are difficult to
observe and in which the concentration of spilt
hydrocarbons tends to be low. It is somewhat
easier to identify direct effects in coastal areas
where the consequences may be very serious,
above all in the case of small populations.

The characteristics of the Prestige oil slick
make it reasonable to suppose that the main
effects will appear in the medium and long
term, since the continued presence of pollutant
substances in the ecosystem means that they
will enter most organisms via the food chain.

Oil slicks: direct and indirect
effects/

In  1978, the  Amoco  Cádiz  oil  slick  in  the
Brittany  region  of  France  caused  almost  total
mortality  in  the  first  age  class  of  various  flat
fish species (those born in 1978). Their natural
habitat  consists  of  sandy  areas  in  shallow
waters and a large part of the hydrocarbon was
deposited in such areas, reducing their popula-
tions to minimal levels.

The work carried out in the case of the Exxon
Valdez  concentrated  on  marine  mammal, bird
and fish species due to their economic and/or
ecological  value. The  results  showed  that  very
low  concentrations  of  pollutants  had  toxic
effects on fish larvae and embryos, with effects
such as reduced growth, increased mortality or
even  genetic  alterations  which  caused  dama-
ged  in  following  generations9. In  the  case  of
marine mammals or birds, it was shown that the
cause for the high level of pollutants was due to
the fact that the diets of the species analysed
contained  other  marine  species  which  had
been affected by the oil spill. At the same time,
a reduction in reproductive success and/or an
increase in mortality was observed.

The evidence that has been gathered until now
indicates that the level of hydrocarbons is
relatively low throughout the Galician continental
shelf. Samples taken in December 2002 detected
high values only in very specific locations (south
of the Vigo Ria and in certain parts of the Costa
da Morte), which could lead one to believe that
the situation is one of practical normality.

However, data provided by the Spanish
Oceanography Institute regarding the level of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in
sediments and the presence of fuel on the
seabed show very high levels of pollutants over
a large part of the Galician continental shelf.

Similar patterns have been observed in the
sediments of coastal areas10.

During the month of September, the Coast
Guard carried out an exploration project to
investigate the Asturian, Cantabrian and
Basque sea beds. The results showed that no
fuel had been found, although those
responsible specified that this did not mean
that no fuel remained, simply that they had
been unable to find it11.

Initial data about the distribution and
abundance of PAHs in marine organisms is
beginning to become available12.

The Prestige Disaster
O n e Ye a r O n

These results show high levels of pollutants in
sessile or sedentary coastal animals (bivalves,
barnacles, sea urchins) in the geographic areas
affected. These animals are at the base of the food
chain, therefore their contamination will enter the
rest of the chain when they are consumed by
other predators. The organisms situated at higher
trophic levels, such as fish, decapod crustaceans or
cephalopod molluscs, are affected to a lesser
degree than sedentary organisms, but nonetheless
they have high values in the affected area. Lastly,
the results for fish and cephalopods from the
continental shelf show similar patterns to those in
coastal areas, although the level of pollutants is
lower. It is foreseeable that the level of pollutants
in predators will increase during the coming years.

The characteristics of the Prestige oil
slick make it reasonable to suppose
that the main effects will appear in the
medium and long term

The case of the goose barnacle/

The goose barnacle provides an example of the
huge impact caused and the complex reaction
of organisms in response to an oil spill.

Each  bed  of  goose  barnacles  forms  a  local
population  whose  growth  and  reproduction
rates depend on the environmental conditions
and  the  population’s  density. Goose  barnacle
larvae are released from different parts of the
coast (and, therefore, from different beds) in
order  to  form  one  single  larval  population
along a considerable length of the coast. Once
they are fully developed, the individuals attach
themselves to rocky habitats. This attachment
is mainly done by fixing onto adult individuals,
rather  than  directly  onto  the  rock. Later  on,
they  gradually  move  and  position  themselves
on the rocks. If there are many adults, there is
great  competition  for  the  substrata  and  the
young barnacles do not develop.

Studies carried out on populations affected by
the  oil  slick  show  that  the  level  of  polycyclic
aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs)  is  very  high,
although  it  has  not  produced  catastrophic
mortalities. However, the morphology of goose
barnacles makes them act like a “trap” for the
fuel and it is therefore likely that the degree of
contamination will not diminish or will only do
so very slowly.

This  data  highlights  a  situation  in  which  the
goose  barnacle  population  presents  a  high
level of pollutants and a high density of speci-
mens, since their extraction has been forbid-
den for a long period of time. The high level of
pollutants will probably jeopardise their reco-
very  and  mean  that  their  larva  production  is
lower than normal.

For  food  safety  purposes, their  commercial
collection should be forbidden for a very long
period  of  time. Nonetheless, active  recovery
work should be carried out in order to selecti-
vely  extract  the  affected  goose  barnacles  in
order  to  allow  the  development  of  new  non-
contaminated individuals.

Impact upon the fishing industry

o

The administrative authorities responsible for
the management of marine resources (the
Galician Autonomous Government for interior
waters and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food for exterior waters) reacted quickly
with regard to the establishment of fishing and
shellfishing bans in the areas affected by the
arrival of the Prestige oil spill.

than that of the Prestige, fishing and
shellfishing activities were suspended for 18
months, whereas in this case, fishing was
resumed after 3 months. There is no doubt that,
in the case of the Prestige, the decision to
recommence fishing activities, although based
on scientific considerations, had a
fundamentally political component.

Thus, the suspension of fishing and shellfishing
activities along the Galician coast was gradually
decreed between 16th November and early
December 2002. Later on, the other autonomous
regions (Asturias, Cantabria and the Basque
Country) were affected by the arrival of crude oil
on their waters and coasts and were also forced
to temporarily close their fishing grounds.

“The re-opening order is untouchable”

Seven  senior  skippers  from  Galician  fishermen’s
guilds  travelled  to  Madrid  in  March  to  attend  an
interview with the General Secretary for Fisheries,
Carmen Fraga, and express their outright rejection
of the renewal of fishing activities due to the hasti-
ness of the measure. The response given by the fis-
heries representative was categorical: the order is
untouchable. The  fishing  skippers  also  expressed
their opinion: “This is the path of absurdity, there is
no criteria. It is sheer nonsense” .13

The suspension of fishing activities lasted until
February, at which time a gradual process was
begun by which fishing areas were opened
according to the fishing method and zone. This
operation ended on 8th October. In most of the
affected areas, fishing and shellfishing has now
been resumed, in some cases against the wishes
of the fishermen and -women themselves. On
7th October, the ban on shellfishing in the last
stretch of the Galician coast was lifted, meaning
that fishing and shellfishing activities were once
again resumed along the whole of the coast
affected by the Prestige spill.

This situation contrasts with that experienced
in France following the Erika catastrophe.
Despite the fact that the spill was much smaller

The case of the octopus/

The octopus provides a good example of the
side  effects  of  the  moratorium  on  fishing
activities.

This species has a very high growth rate and,
given  the  suspension  of  its  capture, one  may
expect an increase in its overall biomass cau-
sed by the growth of individuals and the birth of
new generations, added to a reduced mortality
due to the absence of fishing activities.

When  fishing  recommenced, a  considerable
increase  was  observed  in  the  size  of  the  cat-
ches and the body size of the animals themsel-
ves. However, these  initially  large  catches
rapidly diminished in the areas that were open
to fishing (where a great amount of fishing acti-
vity was concentrated). Within a few weeks, the
size of the catches had reached all-time lows.

However, we must take into account that this
type of gradual re-opening process brings with
it the concentration of fishing efforts in specific
areas which may quickly become over-exploited.
At the same time, the precautionary moratorium
constitutes a complete ban on fishing activities
which should have positive effects since it
allows the growth and recovery of stocks, many
of which are already in a prior state of over-
exploitation. This positive side effect is therefore
superimposed upon the negative biological
effects caused by the oil slick, making the end
result difficult to predict.

Commercial effects

No market research has yet been published
reflecting the repercussions of the Prestige oil
slick on the consumers of sea products and,
therefore, the market.

Despite this, there are a series of repercussions
which can be observed since an oil slick is
perceived by consumers as a sudden pollution
incident which affects the products they
traditionally consume.

The first predictable consequence of a
catastrophe of this type is, therefore, an initial
distrust among consumers towards the product
in question. Until this initial mistrust is
eliminated (which depends on both the
evolution of the oil slick and the
administration’s transparent management), the
demand for these items may drop considerably.

A second consequence may involve a change in
the variety of goods supplied and consumer
preferences, due to the appearance of
alternative, substitute products:

Commercial species already known to the
o
consumer but from a different geographical
origin. This could include the Scottish velvet
swimming crab, French spider crabs, Moroccan
octopuses and sardines, etc.

Preference for new species, whose quality and
o
low prices may make them attractive to consumers.

The appearance of aquaculture products in the

o
marketplace, which undermine the demand for
“wild” products.

Another point that must be taken into account
is that many sea products are recognised, at
both a national and international level, as
high-quality products and are, therefore,
intended for a high-priced market based on
consumers of this type of product (which in
many cases explains the profitability of the
fishing industry). It is possible that the serious
pollution caused by the Prestige may hugely
damage these products, something which
would provoke a serious crisis in the sector.

o

The  initial  figures  produced  by  the  Pontevedra  Chamber  of
Commerce have estimated a loss of 1,390 million euros in the
Galician fishing sector and processing industry15.

The losses are distributed in the following way16:

Shellfishing: 90% loss (54 million of the 60 predicted)
Extractive fishing: 80% loss (176 million of 220 predicted)
Aquaculture: 75% loss (90 million of 120 predicted)
Marketing sector: 40% loss (700 million of 1,750 predicted)
Canning industry: 30% loss (255 million of 850 predicted)
Frozen-food industry: 10% loss (70 million of 700 predicted)

The seriousness of the crisis will vary
according to the importance of the fishing
sector. Without doubt, Galicia will be the most
affected, due to the extent of the oil slick’s
impact and the importance of the fishing
sector in its economy.

The Galician fishing sector’s production
represents one third of national production.
This percentage increases to 40% if we look at
the economic value of the product. It supplies
64% of molluscs and 30% of fish. Employment
in its fishing sector provides more than half of
the fishing jobs in the country. The total
number of Galician boats represents around
50% of the Spanish fleet. 51% of the
traditional Galician fleet, the fleet most
affected by the temporary ban on activities as
a result of the pollution caused by the oil spill,
is to be found in A Coruña, the area which
has, in turn, suffered most due to the
Prestige oil spill.

The fishing sector is less important in the other
regions affected by the oil slick, however they
all have a strong fleet which provides wealth
and employment. In Asturias, the traditional
fleet consists of 464 boats which produce 39
million euros per year, to which one must add
the income earned by other activities such as
aquaculture, shellfishing, canning, the
marketing sector and other associated
activities. The situation of Cantabria and the
Basque Country is similar. In the latter, the
traditional inshore fleet consists of 325 boats
which provide direct employment to more than
2,300 people and produce 91 million euros
per year.

The official figures of the Galician Autonomous
Government estimate that the Galician GDP will
fall by 0.5% in relation to the previous year14.

The Prestige Disaster
O n e Ye a r O n

Food safety

o

An important number of the living organisms
directly affected by the oil slick form part of
the food resources that humans have exploited
for many generations in order to obtain food.

The magnitude of the Prestige catastrophe
makes it impossible to cover all the related
food safety issues, therefore it is essential to
increase the analytical and control efforts in
those areas or resources which are, by nature,
more likely to be contaminated.

Following the oil spill caused by the Exxon
Valdez in Alaska in 1989, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) drew up a protocol
for risk assessment, as well as a set of
recommendations about the condition of the
food resources in the affected area, with
regard to the level of dangerous pollutants
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) to be found in their tissues17.

The existing legislation on safe PAH limits in
food, particularly fish and seafood in both
Spain and the European Union, is extremely
limited, whereas in other countries such as the
U.S. and Canada considerable progress has
been made both in terms of prevention and the
development of oil slick management
strategies which include food safety issues.

In the case of Spain, there exists only one
legislative reference, made in relation to olive
pomace oil18. Although this is the only national
legislation that exists regarding limits for PAHs
in food, it represents official recognition of its
potential toxicity.

As a result of the Prestige disaster, the
Galician Autonomous Government has begun
to monitor PAHs in marine resources and has
established criteria regarding safety limits19.

These coincide with those used in the
European Union but do not include 10 of the
16 compounds that are classified as potentially
carcinogenic by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).

Between 8th January and 5th June 2003, the
Spanish Food Safety Agency20 carried out a
study of the presence of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fishing products from
the entire length of the coast affected by the
accident. The results of the analysis show that
some of the fish, crustacean and cephalopod
samples contain toxic substances which
prohibit their consumption, thereby reducing
fishing sector profits even further. Nonetheless,
the results obtained are amazingly good.

PAHs represent 46.4% of the composition of
the  77,000  tonnes  of  fuel  stored  in  the
Prestige. The  International  Cancer  Agency
classifies  PAHs  as  type “2b”, which  means
that  there  exists  sufficient  proof  of  their
carcinogenic  effect  on  laboratory  animals
but  the  proof  of  carcinogenic  effects  on
humans is insufficient.

The results of the study show that in Cantabria
30.23% of the fish, crustacean and cephalopod
samples analysed contained higher amounts
than the maximum limits allowed for human
consumption. The analysis carried out on
samples of bivalve molluscs (clams, mussels,
oysters, limpets, etc) showed that 3.77% of the
total exceeded the maximum limits established

17Yender R., J. Michel & C. Lord (2002). Managing seafood safety after an oil spill. Seattle: Hazardous Materials Response Division. Office of Response
and Restoration, NOAA.
18The Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs lists 8 PAHs to determine the suitability of olive pomace oil for consumption, establishing a maximum limit
of 2mg/kg of oil for each individual compound and 5 for the compounds in total.

for PAHs2121. However, in Galicia, the region
most affected by the toxic spill, only 7.87% of
the fish, crustaceans and cephalopods
analysed contained traces of fuel greater than
those allowed, whereas 100% of the bivalves
contained no notable remains of polycyclic

aromatic hydrocarbons. In Asturias, 14.5% of
bivalve molluscs had a PAH content higher
than the guide values. In the Basque Country,
no fuel remains were found in any species.
These results are official, however this does
not make them any less surprising.

Repercussions for the tourist sector

o

The tourist sector is possibly, together with the
fishing industry, one of the sectors worst
affected by the environmental disaster. The
importance of this sector is by no means
insignificant, since overall it represents 12% of
Spain’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The statistics for this summer represent the first
indications of the repercussions for the tourist
sector. They show that tourist figures have not
been good in the coastal regions that have been
affected by successive oil slicks from the
Prestige. The general tendency of the regional
governments has been to minimise and even
deny the existence of any “Prestige effect” on
the tourist sector, despite, for example, directly
witnessing the withdrawal of all the blue tourist
“blue flags”22.

If one compares the figures provided by the
National Statistics Institute for the months of
July and August of this year and 2002, a
decrease in hotel occupancy levels can be
observed. The autonomous region that has most
suffered is Galicia, followed closely by
Cantabria. Asturias has experienced a less
significant decrease and the Basque Country
has been the least affected.

The figures provided by the State Department
for Commerce and Tourism regarding the
arrival of foreign tourists show an even

sharper decline. Almost all of the regions
affected by the oil spill have lost foreign
visitors this year. The worst affected was
Asturias, with a 19.2% fall in relation to 2002,
followed by Galicia with 10.2% and Cantabria
which suffered a drop of 10.1%. Only the
Basque Country registered an increase of
12.1% upon the previous year, following the
same tendency as the rest of Spain which
experienced an overall increase of 2.4%.

The Prestige Disaster
O n e Ye a r O n

Social repercussions:
the case of the Galician Coast23

o

Of the 2,750,000 inhabitants of Galicia, one
and a half million live next to the sea in little
over 10% of the territory. The inhabitants of the
coastal communities were those to be first and
most affected by the Prestige catastrophe.

The fishing sector that works along the Galician
coast has suffered the most, in both social and
economic terms. In Galicia, fishing has an
enormous economic, social and cultural
importance. For each fisherman or woman who
works on the sea, three more jobs are created
in other related activities. In total, this involves
120,000 people and represents 12.2% of all
employment in Galicia24.

The Galician inshore fleet consists of over 6,000
vessels, most of which are less than 10 metres
in length. This fleet performs its work along a
1,200 kilometre stretch of coast, going from the
intertidal area to a distance of 25 miles, in a
coastal ecosystem that is characterised by its
great biodiversity, variability and spatial
complexity. This is reflected in the classification
of extractive activities which range from fishing,
in its strictest sense, to harvesting activities,
which include a wide variety of trades:
shellfishers who work on the beach, in shallow
waters or from boats, barnacle collectors, razor-
shell collectors, sea urchin collectors, mussel
seed collectors, polychaete collectors and
gatherers of various seaweed species. In terms
of fishing activities, the fishermen/women
alternate various methods throughout the
yearly cycle in order to catch a wide variety of
species. In total, over 40 different methods are
used to catch approximately 135 fish species.

The crews of the coastal fishing vessels range
between one and four fishermen/women who
are usually related in some way. This pattern
further worsens the repercussion of a
catastrophe such as that of the Prestige since
it weakens the mutual help network and
concentrates the effects of the impact in
domestic units with family ties.

The socio-economic balance of many fishing
communities depends directly on fishing and
shellfishing activities and in many of them this
represents the main source of employment.

The greater the dependency of the
population on the affected natural
resources, the more vulnerable the
socio-economic structure of the
fishing community becomes

o

o

It is clear that in the case of many Galician
fishing communities, the repercussions of the
Prestige oil spill on the social and economic
structure will take their toll over time. The
problem is greater in those cases where no
alternative employment exists.

Right from the start of the crisis, the public
authorities provided the affected fishermen and
women with a financial aid system to lessen
their hardship during the period of inactivity
imposed as a result of the hydrocarbon spill.
The shellfishers and sailors received 40 euros a
day. These subsidies came to an end when the
fishing areas were re-opened. Although this
assistance lessens the economic effects in the
short term, it does not resolve them or prevent
the deterioration of the marine ecosystem and
the market from taking its toll. Indeed, not long
after returning to work, the fishing community
complained of the scarcity of the catches and
the small size of the animals caught.

For various reasons, traditional inshore fishing
constitutes a socially, politically and
economically dismembered sector. The great
spatial dispersion of the fishing communities
along the length of the coast makes it difficult
for them to interrelate. The sector’s problems
are perceived locally and this leads to solutions

that are created within and for a specific
location. The diversity of the methods used and
the species caught generates internal friction
and conflict.

Local problems are dealt with by each of the 63
Galician fishermen’s guilds. Each one functions
as an autonomous and separate entity in
relation to the others, thereby complicating the
joint resolution of common problems that affect
them all. The guilds are organised into
provincial federations but there is no Galician
federation of guilds to unite them all.

However, when faced with the Prestige
catastrophe, the sector’s initial reaction was to
join forces in fighting the problem. A few days
after the disaster, a Committee of Affected
Guilds was created to defend the interests of the
affected fishermen and women. This currently
encompasses 48 guilds. A further seven guilds
are in the process of constituting another co-
ordinating body. The rest do not consider
themselves to be affected by the oil slick.

The objectives of the committee of guilds
focussed first and foremost on defending the
economic and social interests of those affected.
They presented a claim to the IOPC Funds, the

organisation responsible for compensating those
affected by hydrocarbon spills. The amount
requested (130 million euros) was calculated on
the basis of the income that all the fishermen
and women would cease to earn during the
period of inactivity. This amount did not take into
account the intangible aspects of the disaster,
such as social costs, the impoverishment of the
coastal ecosystem or the repercussions of
pollution on the future of the fishing industry. In
order to avoid any delay in the payments, the
Committee reached an agreement with the
Administration according to which the latter
would advance the stipulated amount to the
sector and later negotiate with the IOPC Funds
or make a legal claim against those responsible.

Together with the claim, the Committee signed a
series of collaboration agreements with the
Universities of A Coruña and Santiago de
Compostela in order to obtain independent
scientific information regarding the level of
pollution in the affected species, as well as an
evaluation of the economic and social damaged
caused by the spill. Likewise, it participated in
social revitalisation and environmental recovery
projects intended to encourage the development
of the fishing sector and a rational and
responsible use of resources.

The Prestige demands solutions

An oil slick provokes an environmental crisis
that affects a huge number of economic sectors
and mobilises extremely diverse social forces. It
also requires fast responses which will minimise
its effects, a rigorous evaluation of the damage
caused and the restoration of the affected
ecosystems.

The Prestige catastrophe has highlighted the
absence of contingency plans or, at least, the
lack of capacity to carry out such plans. The fact
that this situation has arisen in an area which
has already suffered several serious oil-related
catastrophes is, without doubt, an aggravating
factor which is hard to explain to the thousands

o

The only plan so far put
forward by the Administration,
the so-called “Plan Galicia”,
has nothing to do with the
Prestige. It is an infrastructures
plan that proposes roads, trains
and ports which will be of no
use in helping goose barnacles,
razor shells or octopuses to
return to their oil-affected
habitats

o

of people affected. The slowness of the response
given by the different administrative bodies does
not help to lessen the effects of the catastrophe.
Solutions must be implemented without delay
and must cover all relevant aspects.

The only plan so far put forward by the
Administration, the so-called “Plan Galicia”, has
nothing to do with the Prestige. It is an

and ports which will be of no use in helping
goose barnacles, razor shells or octopuses to
return to their oil-affected habitats.

The other measures presented by the Spanish
executive during the year that has passed since
the start of the catastrophe have been aimed at
reducing the environmental impact in areas
affected by the hydrocarbon pollution. However,
none of them deal with the urgent need to
restore (a much more complicated concept than
that of cleaning) the 2,000 kilometres of
coastline damaged by the Prestige spill.

The apathy shown by the public administration
becomes clear if one examines the efforts made
in terms of financing. According to several sources
close to the government, the funding for the
research carried out by the Ministry of Science
and Technology to evaluate the catastrophe
amounts to less than 10 million euros25. In the
case of the Exxon Valdez oil slick,26 the evaluation
costs totalled 214 million dollars, besides another
180 million that was invested in research and
monitoring. In other words, forty times the budget
allocated for the Prestige oil slick.

Solutions for the recovery of the coastal and marine
ecosystems affected by the Prestige oil spill

T
t

he recovery of the coastal and
marine ecosystems affected by
the Prestige disaster cannot
simply be left in nature’s hands.
There exist many studies,
research projects and action
protocols taken from similar
cases of oil slicks throughout the
world. The fundamental steps to be taken are as
follows:

Evaluation of the impact caused by the
Prestige oil slick.
Environmental monitoring of the
repercussions in space and time.
Protection of the most valuable areas in
order to speed up recovery.

recovery of the animal and plant populations
that were devastated by the oil slick,
something which would doubtlessly contribute
to the recovery of the economic and social
sectors whose existence is linked to the coast.

It is crucially important to
develop an environmental
monitoring system which allows
real-time data to be gathered
about the evolution of the slick
and the affected ecosystems, with
adequate spatial and temporal
coverage in order to predict the
evolution of the pollutants and
their ecological effect

The report on the Prestige27 that was
presented before the European Parliament last
September underlines the need to carry out an
evaluation of the impact caused by the
accident, placing special emphasis on
environmental recovery. One year after the
disaster, this European Union demand has still
not been undertaken by the Spanish
government, which attempts to avoid its
responsibilities at all costs by affirming that the
catastrophe has been “overcome”28.

However, a study carried out by over 40
professors and doctors from Galician
universities estimates that it will take 10 years
for the areas affected by the Prestige oil spill
to return to normal, whilst a return to biological
normality could take until the year 201529.

o o

The protection of areas of great biological value
will speed up the recovery of the ecosystem as
a whole. There exists widespread scientific
consensus regarding the beneficial effect of
establishing protected marine reserves. They are
more and more frequently used as one of the
most powerful tools with which to fight the
environmental deterioration suffered by oceans.
This conservation and management method
becomes even more necessary when dealing
with a disaster as serious as that caused by an
oil slick on the Atlantic and Cantabrian coasts.
At an international level, there exist a number
of treaties and conventions which provide for
the establishment of protected marine
reserves30.

Despite these alarming figures, no recovery
plan has been announced for the areas
affected by the Prestige spill. We are not
referring to the cleaning away of the most
visible hydrocarbon waste but rather the
restoration of all damaged areas and the

Article 194 of the Law of the Sea31
states the need to take the measures
that are necessary in order to protect
and conserve special or vulnerable
ecosystems, as well as the habitats of
species and other forms of marine life
which have been decimated,
threatened or are in danger.

waste. This convention is approved by the
International Maritime Organisation and
specifies the establishment of “special areas” in
which, for technical reasons related to
oceanographic and ecological characteristics, as
well as the maritime traffic that they withstand,
obligatory regulations for the prevention and
control of sea pollution must be implemented.
Nine areas have so far been designated: the
Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea,
the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf area, the Gulf of
Aden, the Antarctic Ocean, the North Sea and
the Great Caribbean area. These special areas
benefit from stricter regulations and it is
forbidden for any kind of ship to dump
hydrocarbons or oil mixtures in their waters.

The Oslo and Paris Convention for the Protection
of the Marine Environment of the North-East
Atlantic, known as OSPAR, includes among its
areas of work a Strategy on the protection of the
ecosystems and biological diversity of the
maritime area. The aim of this strategy is to
protect and conserve marine ecosystems which
are, or could be, affected by human activities. To
this end, the members of this convention,
including Spain, have proposed the creation of a
network of protected marine reserves within the
OSPAR area. This network will also include areas
that the European Union member states
designate as Special Areas of Conservation
according to the EU Birds and Habitats
Directives. The timescale for adopting this
network of protected marine reserves is 2010.

The United Nations’ International Maritime
Organisation (IMO)32 establishes the so-called
“Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas” (commonly
referred to as PSSA) for areas which require

special protection because of their importance,
due to ecological, scientific or socio-economic
reasons, and may be susceptible to damage
caused by international maritime activities.
Currently, there exist six: the Great Barrier Reef
in Australia (1990), the Sabana-Camagüey
Archipelago in Cuba (1997), the Malpelo Island
in Colombia (2002), Florida Keys in the United
States (2002), the Wadden Sea in Denmark,
Germany and Holland (2002) and the Paracas
National Park in Peru (2003). The Nordic and
Baltic transport ministers recently backed the
proposal to designate the Baltic Sea as the
seventh “Particularly Sensitive Sea Area”, with
the aim of “preventing oil slicks in the area such
as those caused by the Erika and the
Prestige”.

In April 2003, the Spanish government, together
with five other countries (the United Kingdom,
France, Portugal, Ireland and Belgium) presented
the Marine Environmental Protection Committee
of the International Maritime Organisation with
an initiative for the establishment of a
Particularly Sensitive Sea Area from the south
coast of Portugal to the north of the Shetland
Islands in Scotland. This area therefore includes
the Galician and Cantabrian coasts. The “West
European PSSA” also includes two important
passageways for international shipping traffic,
the Faeroe Islands’ channel, to the north of the
United Kingdom, and the English Channel,
between the United Kingdom and France.

The proposal seeks to ban the passing of single-
hull tankers which transport heavy crude oil,
heavy fuel oil, bitumen, tar and their emulsions
within the boundaries of the protected sea area.
Countries such as Russia, Greece, New
Zealand, Panama, Brazil, Liberia and Argentina
have strongly opposed this declaration,
claiming that the specified area is sensitive to
many other threats besides that of single-
hulled shipping traffic.

Another argument used to oppose this protected
sea area is that it will affect the routes followed
by tankers and will force them to alter their
course and sail through areas of great ecological
value, thereby increasing the risk of disasters.

Other nations such as India, Canada, the
United States, Singapore, Norway and Cuba
have also expressed their reluctance to
designate this stretch of the Atlantic as a
protected sea area, both due to its vast
dimension and the risk that it involves for

other coastal countries since it would
increase the number of dangerous ships that
pass along their coasts33. The decision of the
International Maritime Organisation in
relation to this proposal will be announced
in 2004.

Special area MARPOL

Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) - (IMO)

The  IMO  must  accept  its  responsibilities  and  protect  the
planet’s  seas  and  oceans  from  all  the  threats  that  are
currently posed by maritime traffic. Greenpeace has formed
part of the IMO, as an observing body, since 1991. In June
of this year, following complaints presented on behalf of the
industry and certain countries (not clearly identified) regar-
ding  the  environmental  protest  activities  that  Greenpeace
has been carrying out for over 30 years, the International
Agency considered its expulsion. The final decision will be
taken  in  a  meeting  which  will  be  held  at  the  end  of
November.

The discrepancies between all these countries
serve to demonstrate the scarce importance that
countries give to the environment, as well as the
hypocrisy that surrounds international
agreements and agencies. In the case in hand,
some countries (including some recognised flags
of convenience) prefer not to protect an area
that is seriously threatened by oil slicks, arguing
that there exist other threats or that the area to
be protected is too large, despite being aware of
the risks involved. However, they avoid dealing
with the root of the problem and say nothing
about those who are really to blame: the
thousands of ships that sail all around the world

33This is a recurring problem. When the Exxon Valdez accident took place in Alaska, the United States toughed its laws to ban the passing of single-hull
tankers through its waters, which meant that this kind of vessel moved to Europe.

and whose deplorable conditions turn them into
genuine time bombs ready to ruin the way of life
of thousands of people. The International
Maritime Organisation establishes protective
measures but the member states do not want to
implement them if this will affect the huge
interests that control the world-wide traffic of
hazardous substances, even when this has just
caused an episode of environmental, economic
and social destruction along 2,000 kilometres of
coast in the Iberian Peninsula.

We do not know what decision the International
Maritime Organisation will take, but even if this
protected marine area is approved in October of
next year, the measure is insufficient to recover
the area affected by the oil slick, since the other
threats will continue to exist, as is acknowledged
by many countries. The Prestige serves as a
good example to demonstrate that the distancing
of maritime traffic is not, in itself, a solution to
the problem. Despite the fact that the ship sank
130 miles away from the peninsular coast, this
distance only meant that the area affected was
much greater than if the accident had occurred in
a closed bay. Moreover, when a ship finds itself in
difficulty at a great distance from the coast, it
takes longer to go to its rescue and the likelihood
of a disastrous outcome becomes greater.

Furthermore, if the declaration
of a protected sea area
is not accompanied by other
o
technical measures then it will
not provide any real protection

In this case, it would only give a legal status to
the regulatory measure established by the
European Union to forbid the entry of single-
hulled ships transporting certain substances into
its ports. What is more, the protective measure
for the area has not been agreed with the fishing
community nor with scientific bodies. Nor have
the most valuable natural areas which must
benefit from strict protection been identified.

The Spanish government has a duty and
obligation to implement all necessary measures
within its sphere of activity, where it cannot be
denied the right to create protected areas which
will help to prevent new catastrophes and will
benefit the environmental and economic
recovery of the affected areas.

At an international level, the European Union
provides for the establishment of protected
natural areas, but there exists no specific or
distinct status to protect marine areas.

The regulations referring to protected marine
areas are contained within two directives:
Directive 79/409/EEC, concerning the
conservation of wild birds34 and, above all,
Directive 92/43/EEC35 concerning the conservation
of natural habitats36, whose objectives are to
contribute to guaranteeing biodiversity through
the conservation of natural habitats, wild flora
and fauna in the European territory of the
member states. The practical implementation of
these two Directives for Birds and Habitats has
led to the creation of a European environmental
network called “Natura 2000”,37 consisting of the
so-called “Special Protection Areas” (SPAs).

The importance of the areas that constitute
the Natura 2000 Network is explained in the
report about the Prestige38 that was presented
in the European Parliament
in September, which demands an evaluation
of the negative environmental repercussions,
placing special emphasis on the sites proposed
for inclusion within the Natura 2000 network
and natural areas of environmental interest
which lie within the area affected
by the oil slick.

Similarly, the European Parliament report:

Requests the immediate fulfilment of the
Directive relating to habitats in areas of
environmental interest located in the
corresponding coastal regions of the EU and
their immediate inclusion in the Natura 2000
network.

o

34This Directive designates Special Protection Areas for Birds or SPABs.
35Later modified by Directive 97/62/EC, concerning the conservation of Natural Habitats and Wild Fauna and Flora.
36This Directive designates Sites of Community Importance or SCIs.
37The Natura 2000 Network should have been in operation since 2000, as its name suggests, but the delays suffered by practically all countries in
providing a list of important sites and the presentation of incomplete lists has hugely delayed the implementation of this European network of protected
areas.

The Prestige Disaster
O n e Ye a r O n

Reiterates the requests approved in its
resolutions of 21st November 2002 regarding
the Prestige oil tanker catastrophe off the
coast of Galicia and 19th December 2002
regarding the catastrophe caused by the
Prestige oil tanker, to create sensitive
European fishing-maritime areas, chosen as
a result of their great fishing and shellfishing
wealth and the high dependency of their
populations on these resources.

Despite this request, Spain has still not
announced any proposals for evaluation,
recovery and protection in this sense.

We can affirm that, in general, the protected sea
areas strategy is not in very good health due to
three factors: the scarce number of protected
marine reserves, which makes it impossible to
provide effective protection, the small size of
many of the protected areas, a limiting factor
when it comes to enjoying the benefits provided
by protected marine reserves, and the lack of
real protection provided for them, since in many
cases there barely exists any form of surveillance
or control and the protection that they
supposedly receive is not enforced.

At the end of 2002, Spain possessed 87439
protected areas, of which only 19 correspond
to protected marine reserves. The creation of
protected marine reserves in Spain has not
been the result of an objective analysis of
conservation and management needs, it has
instead been the consequence of opportunistic
motives, in an attempt to avoid socially
conflictive situations.

The combination of coastal laws affecting the
land environment and those affecting the
marine environment creates a complex
legislative situation in which the responsibility
for certain territories is assigned to different
administrative authorities (fundamentally
regional and national). These legislative
divisions do not coincide with the maritime-
coastal ecoregions and create “artificial”
administrative divisions within the existing
environmental units.

Another fact to bear in mind is that the
majority of marine areas with some form of
legal protection are to be found in the

Mediterranean and, to a lesser degree, in the
Canary Islands. In contrast, the protected areas
on the Atlantic coast are much fewer in
number and much smaller in size, despite the
Islas Atlánticas on the Galician coast being
declared a National Park in the year 200240.

This geographical imbalance in the degree of
protection is not based on ecological worth,
since that of the Atlantic and Cantabrian
coastline equals or exceeds that of the
Mediterranean. We must seek an explanation
for this disproportion in social, economic,
political and administrative areas. Differences in
how and to what extent protected marine
reserves are used and an understanding of their
usefulness as a management and conservation
tool have created a socio-economic and
administrative context in the Mediterranean
and the Canary Islands which favours the
protection of coastal and marine areas.

The administration should have been aware of
this inequality and should have taken steps to
equal the balance, however it has permitted a
situation in which the Atlantic, a coastal area
with many fishing grounds, has not one single
marine reserve.

Without doubt, the vulnerable situation of this
coastline has been aggravated by the impact of
the Prestige oil slick, whose fuel oil has
buried a good part of some exceptionally
valuable marine and coastal ecosystems of
great natural wealth and biodiversity.

The Spanish government has not presented a
single proposal for the protection of natural
maritime and coastal areas affected by the oil
slick, despite the international scientific
community’s recognition of the benefits that
this protection would provide.

Existing scientific information justifies the
establishment of protected marine reserves
with total protection as a key management tool
for coastal and marine ecosystems. The
protection of the most valuable areas from all
the threats that they face would bring about a
substantial improvement in their natural state
and would allow them to act as true “Noah’s
arks”, exporting biodiversity to the other
coastal and marine areas affected.

The vulnerability of the coastline affected
by the Prestige

o

An analysis of the coast affected by the
Prestige oil slick enables us to observe the
vulnerability of this 2,653 kilometre-long
coastal region. Of this stretch, 88% (2,336 km)
constitutes priority habitats according to the
Habitats Directive, of which 1,183 kilometres

have been designated Sites of Community
Importance (SCIs) but only 449 km have been
declared to be Protected Natural Areas41. In
other words, only 16.9% of the entire coast
affected by the oil slick currently receives real
protection.

Proposal for the protection of marine and coastal
areas on the Galician Atlantic and Cantabrian coasts

o

Despite the essential role played by the marine
environment in the ecological balance, neither
the Spanish government nor the regional
authorities have taken particular interest in
protecting the marine environment. This
situation is particularly clear in the case of the
maritime-coastal region along the Cantabrian
and Galician Atlantic coasts.

Greenpeace demands the creation of an
effective network of protected areas along the
Cantabrian and Galician Atlantic coastline. This
protection would greatly speed up the
recovery of the coastal ecosystems that have
been affected along the 2,000 kilometre
stretch of coast. This network must cover a
considerable area in order to provide
protection against new catastrophes and lay
the foundations for a sustainable use of
marine resources in the future, compatible
with the recovery of those areas affected by
the Prestige. A sustainable use that was far
from being a reality before the oil-tanker
accident occurred.

However, no governmental department has put
forward any proposals in this respect, despite
the European Union’s specific request
expressed in the report about reinforcing
maritime safety after the sinking of the
Prestige oil tanker, presented before the
European Parliament in September42.

The creation of new protected marine reserves
will, without doubt, benefit the environment,
economy and society. In such areas, the
conservation strategies established must be
based on an integrated management method
which analyses all the uses, resources and
services that are offered by the various
habitats and geographical locations. In
accordance with this information, the different
areas must be divided into zones, for which
the permitted intensity and nature of human
use must be defined.

On the basis of these ideas, Greenpeace puts
forward the following proposals for protection:

o

The protection of these areas is doubly
important due to their ecological value
and their usefulness in the recovery
process

o

Estuaries and coastal wetlands: All
areas of this type must be protected and
included within the European Natura 2000
network, as was recently demanded by the
European Parliament43. In these areas, the
use of destructive fishing methods
(particularly different forms of dredging and
trawling) which disturb the characteristic
sedimentary habitat must be forbidden.
Surrounding urban development must be
limited and activities that affect the
ecological balance must be prevented
(pollution, eutrophication, alterations to
water flow or sediments).

Islas Atlánticas National Park: The
number of areas included must be extended
northwards, as was requested by several
bodies at the time of its creation: Islas
Sisargas, Islas Loberías and adjacent coastal
areas, as well as other smaller islands and
neighbouring areas of open coast.

Chain of exposed coastal areas
along the entire coastline: The
exposed sea areas along the Galician and
Cantabrian coast possess great biodiversity
and are highly important as habitats for
certain fishing resources (goose barnacles,
mussel seeds and diverse fish species, for
example). Many of the species that live in
these habitats consist of restricted local
populations and their reproductive success
depends on their interrelation with other
nearby populations. This type of ecosystem
has been severely affected by the recent oil
slick caused by the Prestige. What is
more, the impact has been extensive.

and women, the scientific community and
society in general. The involvement of
fishermen and women is of vital importance
since decades of centralised fisheries
management have clearly shown that if
fishermen and -women are not involved in the
decisions that affect the management of
natural resources, it is very difficult to ensure
that they are carried out effectively.

The Spanish administration should
begin a design process for
a network of marine protected areas

These facts make it reasonable to suppose
that the recovery of the affected populations
will be slower than that observed in previous
disasters of this type since, in this case, all the
local populations have been destroyed along
long stretches of the coast.

Thus, the administration should begin a
design process for this network of protected
areas. The process should be open to all users
and interested parties, including fishermen

Noah’s Arks to recover the coast affected

o

Among the studies carried out in the area
affected by the Prestige disaster, there exists
a coastal protection proposal prepared by the
Department of Ecology and Animal Biology of
the University of Vigo which suggests the
creation of a network of special-interest areas
called “Noah’s Arks” along the entire Galician
coast.

well as technical criteria such as accessibility
and closeness to pollution-fighting
infrastructures. The objective of the
establishment of a network of protected
marine reserves is twofold:

to guarantee the reproduction of organisms

that have survived the oil slick.

The aim of this network is to protect a group of
valuable areas that have been affected by the
impact of the oil spill. These areas have been

to repopulate the areas damaged by fuel,

once they have been cleaned.

Solutions aimed at preventing
new catastrophes

T
t

he recovery of coastal and
marine areas affected by the oil
slick caused by the Prestige
will not be sufficient if
governments and the
International Maritime
Organisation, responsible for the
safety of maritime traffic

throughout the world, do not strengthen the
regulations to prevent oil slicks. These
regulations should also ensure that those
which cause spills do not escape financial
responsibility. Together with the reinforcement
of maritime safety, the Spanish government

must work to provide the measures and plans
that are necessary in order to fight oil slicks
efficiently. The shortcomings that were
witnessed during the Prestige accident made
this very clear.

The fight against pollution from the land must
be another objective. Besides large and
spectacular oil slicks, coastal waters receive
vast amounts of pollution every day in the
form of industrial and urban sewage and
dumping of all kinds, which relentlessly
deteriorate the quality of the marine
environment.

Measures to improve the safety
of maritime traffic

o

The recent report that was presented in the
European Parliament about the reinforcement
of maritime safety following the sinking of
the Prestige oil tanker considers it
necessary to prepare specific emergency
plans in areas of heavy maritime traffic45.
Similarly, it asks for protection, prevention
and surveillance programmes to be
implemented for maritime transport routes in
those areas which are most vulnerable and
are exposed to the risk of chemical and oil
accidents. The report asks the Commission
and the European Council to present a co-
ordinated proposal to the International
Maritime Organisation for the declaration of
sensitive maritime routes along the coasts of
the European Union which contemplates the
need to establish a “zero” level of polluting
discharges, as well as a ban on the
transportation of dangerous products.

European Union is an observer at the IMO, it
is the states that are full members, hence an
initial move should be that the EU itself gains
full member status. The EU and its member
States need to argue the case for stronger
measures within the IMO. The toughening of
measures in European waters alone will only
serve to move the current fleet of
‘rustbuckets’ towards countries in the South.

Until now, the demands made by
the European Union have not been
take into account by the
International Maritime
Organisation, which has made no
progress on issues relating to
maritime safety despite the fact
that a year has passed since the
Prestige catastrophe

The member states of the European Union
must take their role in the International
Maritime Organisation seriously. The

The Prestige Disaster
O n e Ye a r O n

One of the first aspects that the IMO should
modify is the regime of responsibility that
arises from an accident. The current
compensation system is based on the limited
financial responsibility of the owner of the
vessel, according to the tonnage of the ship.
In the case of the sinking of the Erika oil
tanker off the French coast three years ago,
responsibility was limited to 13.5 million
euros, despite the fact that the damage
accumulated as a result of the oil slick
totalled almost 1,000 million euros. What is
more, under the current system, this
responsibility is restricted exclusively to the
shipowner whilst the managers, charterers,
operators and owners of the load (which, in
the case of oil slicks, are usually large
multinational oil companies) are entirely
exempt of all responsibility.

o

Greenpeace has demanded
a change in the system,
in order that responsibility
be extended to the entire
transport chain, including
the owners of the cargo

o

Following the case of the Exxon Valdez
(property of Exxon) and the Erika (property of
the company TotalFina), in which the affected
countries demanded that the oil companies
accepted their responsibility for the oil slick
caused, the reaction of these companies did
not lead to an increase in safety but instead
quite the opposite. The large oil companies
have gradually reduced their safety measures
in order to evade their responsibilities. Over
the last decade, they have done away with a
large part of their crude oil transportation
fleet and have chosen to transport their
hazardous products in cheap vessels hired
from intermediary companies. Thus, in the
event of an accident, responsibility is
dispersed. There is no better example than
that of the Prestige, in which the cargo-
owning company, the Swiss firm Crown
Resources, legally vanished after the accident.

Greenpeace has demanded a change in the
system, in order that responsibility be
extended to the entire transport chain,
including the owners of the cargo. This would
mean that the use of ‘rustbuckets’ for the
transportation of products would no longer be
lucrative. However, one year after the accident
involving the Prestige oil tanker, the
International Maritime Organisation has taken
no steps to change the current regime of
responsibility and continues to allow hundreds
of “profitable” time bombs to sail the oceans
and seas of the entire world.

Another of the issues often related to oil
slicks is the so-called flags of convenience. The
Prestige was registered in the Bahamas, one
of the nations which awards flags without any
concern for the fulfilment of international
regulations, including those referring to
maritime transport safety. Flags of
convenience are a common factor in a large
number of shipping accidents in that they
provide a loophole through which
disreputable shipping companies and owners
can avoid their responsibilities. Despite this,
the International Maritime Organisation has
not introduced any changes in the regulations
to prevent their use or sanction those
countries that violate the legislation with
absolute impunity.

Lastly, another common factor in many oil
slicks are single-hulled tankers, which provide
much lower levels of safety than those
equipped with a doublehull. The hiring of
these vessels for the transportation of all
kinds of products is very common since they
are, generally, cheaper. The reality of the
situation shows that they are more likely to
suffer accidents. The International Maritime
Organisation has done nothing to prevent
these ships from transporting hazardous
substances all around the world.

However, in the absence o any moves by the
IMO, the European Union has taken action,
albeit limited, in this area. It has modified the
regulations in order to ban the entry of single-
hull tankers in European ports from 20th
October onwards. Despite being important,
this measure is insufficient since it does not

IMO: ACT NOW!
It is clear that a range of measures needs to be implemented urgently which
would increase the quality of shipping. These include:

A liability regime which can both act as an incentive to use high quality
ships and crews and which is more consistent with the polluter pays principle.
This means that the charterers (i.e. the oil companies in the case of tankers)
should not be excluded from liability as is currently the situation.

The rapid phase out of single-hulled tankers worldwide.

The establishment of Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSAs) for the most
vulnerable coastlines.

!

A more robust and transparent inspection and maintenance regime including the publication
of classification society survey results.

Closure of loopholes such as the use of Flags of Convenience whereby shipowners can avoid
their responsibilities by flagging a vessel with a county in which the standards are lowest.

prevent ships like the Prestige from sailing
through European waters (it only forbids them
to dock in its ports) and nor is it useful in
fighting oil slicks such as that caused by the
Exxon Valdez, a double-hulled oil tanker, in
Alaska. The EU has also proposed certain
Marine Protected Areas. While neither of these
measures go far enough, they are at least more
than has been taken by the IMO.

The European Union must do more to prevent
safety policies from being determined by the
oil companies. The regulations decreed by the
EU are reduced to promises and a selective
toughening of the rules, clearly adapted to
certain commercial interests which do not give
as much importance to protecting the marine
and coastal environment.

Although governments and industry should fully
comply with the polluter pays principle, the
reality is that the financial liability paid by
commercial interests is absurdly low. The real
cost is borne by the citizens and the environment
on which they and their livelihoods depend. In
this context, it becomes clear that the interest in
investing to improve ship safety is minimal.

Safety measures to fight pollution
and catastrophes

o

o

Despite having suffered successive incidents of
serious pollution on our coasts as the result of
shipping accidents, Spain still has no resources
or contingency planning to lessen the effects of
a catastrophe of this type. Despite the opinions
expressed by the government stating the
opposite, prevention is fundamental. We
cannot continue to believe that oil slicks are
inevitable, something we have heard from the
lips of more than one official, and that little
more can be done than to trust that the wind
will take the spilt cargo far away.

Ignorance of the natural processes that take
place in different parts of the world may lead
one to believe that nature is unpredictable.
However, the true situation demonstrates that
an ever more exhaustive understanding of
these processes allows their evolution to be
fully explained and, to a certain degree, allows
natural phenomena to be predicted46.

The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for
applying and implementing the Contingency
Plan to fight sea pollution, required by both the

Law on Ports and the Merchant Navy and the
MARPOL Convention, in order to control ships
and their spillages. Despite this legal mandate
for the creation and implementation of
contingency plans which would make it
possible to fight accidental sea pollution in all
the maritime areas of the coastal regions of
Spain, not a single plan is currently operative in
Spain. The basic regulations for their creation
were not even developed until the year 200147.

The Galician Autonomous Government was
planning to approve a Decree with a Basic
Contingency Plan for Sea Pollution at the start
of September, to guarantee the co-ordination
between competent bodies during pollution
incidents and predict the resources and services
necessary in the event of another oil slick.
However, this has not yet come into being.

Spain lacks the tugs and anti-pollution barriers
necessary to deal with oil slicks. Despite this,
the Ministry of Public Works has assigned
thousands of millions of euros to the
Infrastructures Plan, many of which have been
given by the European Union, to continue
financing the transformation of the natural
environment via the construction of ports,
airports, dual carriageways and motorways.

In October 2003, the Ministry of Public Works
announced that in 2004 it would spend 123.5
million euros on a programme for maritime
traffic safety and coastal surveillance in
Galicia48. This figure sharply contrasts with the
1,045 million euros that it will invest in
infrastructures in this region, as part of the so-
called “Plan Galicia”49.

In the report about the Prestige prepared by the
European Parliament, a request is made for the
Commission to include the establishment of
Urgent Intervention Plans for all European coastal

areas within the agenda of the VI Research and
Technological Development Framework Programme
for the year 2004. These plans would make it
possible to face all kinds of risks and catastrophes,
as well as the design and construction of new ships
technologically developed for collecting and
cleaning toxic sea spills and the promotion of new
technologies for environmental recovery and the
treatment of waste.

However, the Spanish administration cannot sit
back and wait for the European Union to come
and solve the problems that occur on our
coasts. The Spanish government must promote
the development of European actions whilst at
the same time taking immediate measures to
protect the coast, since this is exclusively and
solely their responsibility.

It is therefore necessary to establish protocols
for action in the event of different types of
accidents in the various maritime regions of
Spain. Equally, refuge or shelter areas must be
created which are specially equipped to harbour
damaged ships, with the aim of spatially limiting
the effects of the accident.

One of the projects envisaged in the Plan Galicia
is the construction of a new exterior port in A
Coruña which some officials have attempted to
justify as a “port of refuge”.
It is clear that an exterior port is completely
unsuited to the function of a shelter area and
that a port of refuge must be exclusively devoted
to this task and is therefore incompatible with
the activities of a commercial port.

Another necessary measure is the redefinition of
powers regarding the protection and
conservation of the maritime-coastal
environment in order to guarantee an
immediate and co-ordinated response and
efficient management which would give priority
to safeguarding the environment, over and
above commercial or corporate interests.

Both ports and oil companies must be obliged
to have sufficient anti-pollution resources in

Ireland, with cracks on the deck as the result of a
violent storm. Ireland took the decision to keep the
boat in the bay, accepting the risk that an oil spill
could occur. Once inside the bay, the Marine Safety
Directorate, together with the Irish Coast Guard and
the Marine Survey Office demanded that the ship-
ping  operator  transfer  the  cargo  to  another  ship
and  provisionally  repair  the  “Princess  Eva” in
Ireland. The  ship  left  Ireland  a  few  months  later,
with the cracks on the deck welded and her tanks
empty.

In  November  2002, the  “Prestige”,
77,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil, sent out an SOS at
a distance of 28 miles from Finisterre, in Spain. A
crack on its starboard side meant that it was losing
some of its cargo. Spain took the decision to send
the “Prestige” far from its coast, out to sea, when
the  boat  was  already  losing  oil  and  had  been
seriously damaged by the sea’s actions. What hap-
pened  was  inevitable:  the  boat  split  in  two  and
sank. The rest of the story is well-known.

order to deal with the pollution caused by the
substances that are being transported, loaded or
unloaded, in the event of an accident.

The state must also invest in anti-pollution
resources:

Anti-pollution ships with the capacity to
absorb and store polluting substances,
permanently located in areas of greatest
maritime traffic: Bay of Biscay, Galicia,
Andalusia, the Mediterranean and the Canary
Islands.
Anti-pollution barriers to fight serious cases
of pollution in the worst possible sea and
weather conditions, also distributed
throughout the various maritime areas, with
the resources necessary for their installation.

The current increase in general-purpose ports,
apart from the 43 existing ports, which compete
amongst themselves to attract new maritime
traffic in order to survive, does nothing but
increase the risks, to the detriment of our
threatened coastline.

The Prestige Disaster
O n e Ye a r O n

o

The elimination of threats
in the coastal region

The Prestige disaster has aggravated the
poor situation of the marine and coastal
environment along the affected coast.
However, it is not the only cause of this
deterioration. The destruction of habitats,
pollution and the effects of climate change
are the most obvious results of a series of
activities that have been identified for some
time now: overfishing, oil and gas
prospecting, maritime transport, the
accumulation and transportation of
hazardous substances, waste dumping,
excessive port infrastructures and sand and
gravel extraction.

The spills which originate from ships,
accidental or otherwise, are not the only
source of pollution for the maritime-coastal
environment. They represent 25% of the
pollution that reaches the coast and sea. The
rest comes from the land.

The lack of knowledge about marine and
coastal ecosystems and the benefits that can
be obtained by preserving them in good
condition is reflected in the inconceivable,

arbitrary and thoughtless decisions that are
taken regarding the location of industries,
landfills, exterior ports, etc, which alter
marine hydrodynamics, destroy animal and
plant communities and pour all kinds of
waste into the sea, promising to convert
certain coastal areas into sewers.

The control of pollution from the land and
from ports located along the length of the
coast must become a reality as soon as
possible, in order to completely prevent all
waste materials from entering the sea.

Hydrocarbon research licences in the bay of biscay,
opposite the Asturian coast/

On  24th  October  of  this  year, the  cabinet  ministers  approved  a  Royal  Decree  by  which  five  research
licences were awarded to the company Repsol Investigaciones Petrolíferas, S.A. giving it the exclusive
right to search for hydrocarbons during a period of six years in an area of 478,863 hectares located
opposite the Asturian coast.

Drilling activities and the future installation of oil platforms will in no way contribute to improving the
coast affected by the Prestige oil slick. However, this does not seem to matter to the Spanish govern-
ment, which allows a dangerous activity to be carried out along the damaged coastline without even
having presented a recovery plan for the area. Instead of eliminating existing threats, they are adding
greater uncertainty to the coast’s future.
