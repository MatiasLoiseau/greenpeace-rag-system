In May 2007, Apple announced that all of its new products
would be free from brominated flame retardants (BFRs) andthe chlorinated plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) by the end of2008.  The following month, Apple launched its latestproduct, the iPhone, to an eager US market and is now
gearing up for its release in Europe in November this year.  In
order to see what progress Apple has already made towards
meeting its pledge on hazardous chemicals and materials,Greenpeace purchased an iPhone in Washington, DC in June
and forwarded it to laboratories in the UK for deconstructionand analysis.
The iPhone was carefully deconstructed at the Greenpeace
Research Laboratories, based at the University of Exeter (UK),and a selection of 18 internal and external materials andcomponents were subsequently forwarded to an independentlaboratory elsewher e in the UK for analysis of chemical
composition.  This analysis focused primarily on thosesubstances regulated under the European Union's RoHSDirective (2005/84/EC), which pr events the use of lead,
cadmium, mercury, chromium (VI) and certain brominatedflame r etardants in electrical and electronic goods.  Additional
tests were also run for certain other hazardous substancesand materials, including PVC and the toxic phthalateplasticisers they commonly contain.
•All components tested appear to be compliant with the
requirements of the EU RoHS Directive, to the extent that 1) no cadmium or mer cury were detected, 2) lead and
chromium were detected in a small proportion of samplesand at relatively low concentrations and 3) there was noevidence for the presence of the most toxic and regulatedform of chromium (chromium (VI)) in a range of other metal-plated components tested.
•However, half of the components analysed did test positive
for br omine, in three cases at over 1% of the total surface
chemical composition of the material, suggesting continuedwidespread use of either additive or reactive brominatedflame retardants.  Although none of the BFRs covered byRoHS could be detected in the sample with the highestbromine content (10% by weight, in the flexible circuit boardof the phone's antenna), all forms of BFR (even ifchemically-bound into polymers) can act as a significantsource of toxic and persistent brominated pollutants oncethe iPhone handset enters the waste str eam.•The presence of antimony in four of the components raises
additional concerns.  Despite its well recognised toxicity,antimony (often used to enhance brominated flameretardant formulations) is not currently regulated underRoHS.
•A high level of chlorine was detected in the plastic coating
of the headphone cables, along with phthalates plasticisersat a total of over 1.5% by weight, both characteristic ofPVC.  Although the use of PVC and phthalate esters is notcurrently prohibited or even regulated under RoHS, it isworth noting that none of the four phthalates found in thisstudy are permitted for use in components of toys orchildcare articles sold in Europe.
•As we were able to analyse only a small selection of the
different components and materials, it is not possible(without a lot of additional testing) to conclude that allmaterials used in the iPhone curr ently on sale in the USA
would comply with EU law .
The fact that a product brought newly to the US market inJune 2007 still utilises PVC and br ominated flame retar dants
(even if not those BFRs regulated under the RoHS Directive)suggests that Apple is not making early progress towards its
2008 commitment to phase-out all uses of these materials,even in entir ely new product lines.  Whether the iPhone model
due for release in Europe in November 2007 will also rely onbrominated internal components and PVC headphonesremains to be seen.
If Apple really wants to reinvent the phone, it needs to design
out all hazar dous substances and materials from its handsets
and peripherals.

4 Missed Call: iPhone's hazardous chemicalsIntroduction
Analysis of internal and external components from an Apple
iPod purchased in the UK during 2007 indicated thatbrominated materials and PVC were still common to manycomponents
1.  This current study focuses on a more recent
Apple product, the iPhone, released in the USA in June 20072
and due for release on the European market in earlyNovember .
Under European law, all electrical and electronic goodsplaced on the market in the EU from July 2006 onwards mustcomply with strict limits relating to a number of specifichazardous chemicals.  Under the so-called RoHS Directive
3,
homogenous materials and components must not containmore than 0.1% by weight of the heavy metals lead,chromium (VI) and mer cury or of the organic br ominated flame
retardants (BFRs) PBDEs and PBBs, and no mor e than
0.01% by weight of cadmium.  These requirements underRoHS do not, however, address all hazardous chemicals andmaterials commonly use in electr onics.  For this r eason, the
current study of the iPhone focuses not just on issues ofRoHS compliance, but also investigates the presence of otherhazardous chemical additives and materials commonlyassociated with electronics, including PVC and additionalBFRs additional to those regulated under the RoHS Directive.Materials and methods
An iPhone was purchased in Washington, DC on 29 June2007 and forwarded to the Greenpeace ResearchLaboratories at the University of Exeter (UK) for dismantlingand analysis.  The handset was dismantled in our laboratory,taking care to avoid contamination with dust and grease andcross-contamination between different components.Individual components were placed in antistatic bags forstorage prior to analysis.
A total of 18 individual components and/or materials (listed 
in Table 1 below) were forwarded to an independent analyticallaboratory for analysis of surface elemental composition usingXRF (X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometry).  This analyticaltechnique yields data on the composition of a number ofchemical elements (with a detection limit in the range of 20parts per million, ppm, or 0.002% of the total composition),with a focus on those of regulatory concern under the EURoHS Directive (i.e. cadmium, chromium, mercury, lead andbromine.  Identification of br omine indicates the pr esence of
brominated additives or polymeric materials used for fireretardancy purposes).  In addition, XRF gives an indication ofthe presence of certain other elements of environmental andtoxicological concer n, including antimony (frequently used as
a synergist in brominated flame retardant formulations
4and
commonly found in electronic wastes5) and chlorine (for which
high concentrations in plastic materials commonly indicate thepresence of PVC).Missed Call: iPhone's

6 Missed Call: iPhone's hazardous chemicalsResults
Detailed results from the XRF analyses are provided at 
Annex 1.  In summary:-
1)no evidence was found for the presence of the heavy
metals cadmium or mer
cury in any of the 18 samples
analysed (above the detection limit of 20 ppm);
2)low concentrations of total chromium (100-280 ppm) were
found in some of these materials, but ther
e is no reason to
believe that any significant quantities of the chromium
present was in the most toxic form chr omium (VI).
Although it was not possible to confirm the absence ofchromium (VI) in those components testing positive forchromium, separate chemical analysis in our laboratories of a range of other plated components in the phone(especially screw heads) found no evidence of chromium (VI);
3)lead was found in four of the components/materials, at
concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 ppm, well below thecompliance limits under RoHS  (1000 ppm).  Theseincluded the black outer casing of the phone beneathwhich the antenna was located (XRF-2), one of the inter nal
flexible cir
cuit boards (XRF-5), an internal rubber
component in the r egion of the micr ophone (XRF-16) and
the Apple-branded rubberised base of the USBcradle/docking station (XRF-36);4)bromine was detected in half of the samples tested (9), 
at levels ranging fr 
om 10 ppm to a high of 100 000 ppm 
(or 10% of the total surface composition of the material).  The highest concentrations were found in the flexible circuitboard which makes up the antenna (XRF-4).  Next highest
were in the headphone socket (XRF-6, 41 000 ppm) and a
circuit board inside the phone (XRF-27, 14 000 ppm). Both the flexible antenna and the headphone socket alsoyielded positive readings for antimony (though levels of
antimony could not be quantified), pr
obably arising from
the use of antimony trioxide as a synergist in the flameretardant mix.  Antimony was also detected in surfacesamples of two of the chips tested (XRF-21 and XRF-31),again along with significant bromine concentrations (2 400and 3 200 ppm respectively).  Although not currentlyregulated under the RoHS Directive, there are substantialconcerns regarding the toxicity and carcinogenicity of theform of antimony used in such applications
6.  There is
evidence that the pr esence of antimony in some
brominated polymers can also enhance the formation 
of brominated dioxins and furans during combustion7,
though without disclosure of the types of brominatedmaterials used in the iPhone, it is not possible to determine the relevance of this mechanism in this case;
5)one sample, namely the white headphone cable (XRF-33),
showed a high level of chlorine, indicating that the cablecasing is made fr
om PVC.
Based on the outcome of these XRF screening analyses, twoof the 18 materials were selected for more specific anddetailed chemical analysis (using gas chromatography/massspectrometry) at the same analytical laboratory:-
a)the flexible circuit board which made up the antenna of the
phone (XRF-4) was analysed for the pr
esence of the
extractable (additive) brominated flame retardants PBDEs
(excluding the 'decaBDE' form, which is currently exemptedunder RoHS) and PBBs;
b)the white casing of the headphone cable (XRF-33) was
analysed for the pr
esence of a range of phthalate esters
commonly used as plasticisers in flexible PVC, includingthose phthalate esters prohibited from use in toys and
childcare articles in the EU.Missed Call: iPhone's

Further details of the methods employed can be provided on
request. 
Despite the very high br omine content, the flexible antenna
circuit board contained no detectable residues of PBDEs 
(<30 ppm), including octa- and nona-BDE, nor of PBBs,(though the absence of PBBs is not unexpected given thatthese are historically used chemicals that are now are largelyobsolete).  Two limitations to the analysis performed are worth
noting:- 
i)the limits of detection are relatively high (as the method 
is designed primarily to test compliance with the RoHS
Dir
ective), such that any small traces of PBDEs (below
regulatory significance) would not have been detected;
ii)the exclusion of decaBDE from the analysis (also for
r
egulatory reasons) means that even high concentrations of
this flame retardant would not have been detected in this
study.  However , were decaBDE present at high levels, it is
likely that the analyses would have detected the pr esence of
nonaBDE and octaBDEs which ar e commonly present at
significant levels as contaminants in decaBDE formulations.
While these are significant limitations, it is possible to
conclude that the flexible antenna cir cuit boar d, at least,
would be in compliance with existing EU laws on thepresence of brominated flame retardants.  Although thepossibility cannot be ruled out that the high levels of brominedetected in this component resulted from the presence ofdecaBDE or another additive br ominated flame retardant not
addressed by RoHS, it seems more likely (on the basis ofexperience with similar components in various brands oflaptop computers
8) that the bromine is present in a reactive
polymeric form (such as cross-linked TBBPA-based
formulations) or, at least, in poorly extractable oligomeric
forms which cannot be quantified using gas chromatographictechniques.  Whether in additive or reactive form, thepresence of such high proportions by weight of bromine insuch materials is of concer n with respect to the disposal or
recycling of end-of-life iPhone handsets, as even cross-linkedorganic-bound bromine can contribute to the formation oftoxic chemicals, including persistent and bioaccumulativebrominated dioxins and related compounds during thermal
destruction or processing
9. The flexible plastic of the headphone cable did yield high
concentrations of extractable additives, namely phthalateesters (more commonly known as phthalates), comprising a
total of over 1.5% of the overall weight of the material.  
In total, four phthalates were detected, dominated by DEHP
(at 11,400 ppm, or 1.1% by weight), followed by DnBP 
(5,070 ppm, or 0.5%), DiNP (725 ppm, or 0.07%) and DiDP(75 ppm, or 0.007%).  These figures, together with thepresence of high levels of chlorine, strongly indicate that theheadphone cable is made of PVC, plasticised with phthalatesincluding those banned for use in toys and childcare articles in the EU
10.  Furthermore, these results are similar (though
higher overall) than those found in previous analyses ofheadphone cables sold with an Apple iPod, for which wehave confirmed the presence of PVC (DEHP 6,000-6,900ppm; DnBP 2 200-2,700 ppm; DiNP 2 100-2,700  ppm).
The two most abundant phthalates in the headphone cables
of both the iPhone and iPod ar e those classified in Eur ope as
'toxic to r eproduction: category 2’
11, as a result of their ability
to interfere with sexual development in mammals, especially inmales.  These phthalates are prohibited from use in all toys orchildcar e articles put on the market in Eur ope (with a limit of
0.1% by weight), according to Directive 2005/84/EC.  Thetwo other phthalates found in the headphones sold with theiPhone (DiNP and DiDP) are prohibited under the sameDirective from use in toys and childcare articles if they can beplaced in the mouth by children.  Although it is unclearwhether headphones from an iPod or iPhone could ever beclassified as components of toys or childcare articles, it isclear that the presence of high levels of phthalates in suchmaterials could contribute to overall levels of exposure tosuch chemicals for the user, including childr en.Disassembly

Conclusions
Of the 18 different internal and external components and
materials tested from an Apple iPhone purchased in the USAin June 2007, all would appear to be compliant with therequirements of the EU's Directive on use of certainhazardous substances in electronics and electrical goods (theRoHS Directive).  In particular:-
•no cadmium or mercury were detected;
•lead and chromium were detected in a small proportion of
samples and at relatively low concentrations;
•there was no evidence for the presence of the toxic and
regulated form of chromium, chromium (VI),  in a range ofother metal-plated components tested (primarily screwheads).
Nevertheless, it should be noted that:-
1) despite ef forts to include as wide a range of dif fer
 ent
components and materials as possible in the analyses, the
study was inevitably limited in scope to those 18 samplestested.  It is not possible, therefore, to conclude from theseresults that all components and materials used in theiPhone model currently on sale in the USA would be RoHScompliant if brought to the European market.  This wouldneed to be the subject of more detailed investigation;
2) half of the components analysed tested positive for
br
omine, in three cases at over 1% of the total surface
chemical composition of the material, suggestingcontinued widespread use of either additive or reactivebrominated flame retardants.  Although none of the PBDEs or PBBs covered by RoHS could be detected inthe sample that yielded the highest br omine content 
(100,000 ppm or 10% by weight in the flexible antennacircuit board), even chemically bound bromine  can act asa significant source of toxic and persistent br ominated
pollutants once the iPhone handset enters the wastestream;3) the presence of antimony in four of the components raises
additional concer
ns.  Despite its well recognised toxicity,
antimony (often used to enhance brominated flame
retardant formulations) is not currently regulated under
RoHS.
4) the presence of high levels of chlorine in the plastic coating
of the headphone cables, combined with that of phthalateesters at a total of over 1.5% by weight, str
ongly indicates
that the headphones supplied with the iPhone model onsale in the USA are made from PVC.  Once again, althoughthe use of PVC and phthalate esters is not currentlyprohibited or even regulated under RoHS, it is worth notingthat none of the four phthalates found in this study arepermitted for use in components of toys or childcar e
articles sold in Europe.  
5)also of concern is the fact that the battery was, unusually,
'har
dwired' (glued and soldered) in to the handset,
hindering r eplacement and r endering material separation
for recycling or appropriate disposal more difficult, and
therefore less likely to occur.
The fact that a product brought newly to the US market inJune 2007 still utilises PVC and brominated flame retardants(even if not those BFRs regulated under the RoHS Directive)suggests that Apple is not making early pr ogress towards its
2008 commitment to phase-out all uses of these materials,even in entir ely new product lines.  Whether the iPhone model
due for release in Europe in November 2007 will also rely onbrominated internal components and PVC headphonesremains to be seen.
