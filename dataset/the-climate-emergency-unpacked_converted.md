As the climate crisis intensifies, there is growing worldwide
acceptance of the need to slash greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions  from  the  burning  of  fossil  fuels  to  limit  global
heating to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.1 As this need
for  drastic  cuts  in  fossil  fuel  emissions  begins  to  assume
concrete form – as car companies invest heavily in electric
technology,  and  local  and  national  governments  start
to  timetable  bans  on  gasoline  and  diesel  vehicles2  and
domestic  gas  boilers3  –  the  fossil  fuel  industry’s  future  is
necessarily coming into question. Institutional and equity
investors,  banks  and  insurers  have  been  progressively
withdrawing from the sector because of its doubtful future
in a world increasingly alert to the urgent need to halt global
heating.4 Companies that have invested and continue to
invest huge sums of money in finding and developing new
oil and gas fields and building refineries (even though the
oil and gas in already operational fields would by itself be
enough to take the world past the 1.5 °C carbon budget5)

risk  being  left  with  stranded  assets6  and  plunged  into
financial jeopardy.

In  response  to  this  existential  uncertainty,  vertically
integrated  fossil  fuel  majors  such  as  Aramco,7  Total,8
Exxon9 and Shell10 have reportedly been making massive
investments  in  petrochemical  and  plastic  production.
They  are  well  placed  to  do  so,  as  more  than  99%  of
plastic is produced from fossil fuels,11 with an estimated
6% of global oil production either used as feedstock for
plastics or burned to provide energy for the production
processes.12 Significant amounts of ethane and propane
separated  from  natural  gas  are  also  used.  Coal  is  also
used as a plastic feedstock, particularly in China.13

Global production and consumption of plastics have
increased  dramatically  since  the  1950s.14  According
to  trade  body  PlasticsEurope,  in  2020  global  plastic
production reached 367 million metric tons, up from 359
million metric tons in 2018.15 If business as usual continues,

industry estimates predict that plastic production could
double by 2030-2035 and triple by 2050, in comparison
to  2015.16  Indeed,  according  to  a  recent  report  by  the
Minderoo  Foundation,  producers  of  the  five  primary
single-use  plastic  polymers  plan  to  increase  capacity
by 30% – an additional 70 million metric tons – in the five
years between 2020 and 2025 alone.17

As well as driving an increase in plastic pollution, such
expansion would bring a huge increase in GHG emissions,
threatening  humanity’s  ability  to  keep  global  heating
below  1.5  °C.  In  the  U.S.,  a  recent  study  found  that  new
and  proposed  oil,  gas  and  petrochemical  infrastructure
in the industry’s Texas and Louisiana heartland alone will
potentially emit an extra 541 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent (CO2e) annually by 2030, equal to the
emissions of 131 coal-fired power plants – with 38% of this
attributable directly to petrochemical facilities.18 A report
from the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL)

estimates that projected growth in plastic production would
see global emissions from the plastic life cycle increase by
more than 50% of 2019 levels to 1.34 billion metric tons CO2e
a year by 2030 – equivalent to nearly 300 coal-fired power
plants – and more than double again by 2050. The report
adds that the sector’s total emissions by 2050 could use
between 10% and 13% of the entire 1.5 °C carbon budget,
rising to a quarter or more by 2100.19

Plastic  industry  expansion  seems  to  be  grounded  in
sectoral assumptions not only that fossil feedstocks will go
on being cheap and abundant,20 but also that demand for
plastic will keep growing (both in the global North and in the
global South).21 And as some of the world’s most iconic users
of  single-use  plastic  packaging,  fast-moving  consumer
goods  (FMCG)  companies  like  Coca-Cola,  Nestlé  and
PepsiCo are playing a key role in creating that demand.

for  around  40%  of  total  non-fiber  plastic  demand  and
contributes  over  half  of  plastic  waste  worldwide.22  And
bullish  industry  projections  talk  up  the  scope  for  sector
growth, driven by sharp increases in plastic consumption
in  developing  economies.23  Despite  intensifying  public
and regulatory pressure on consumer brands to address
their plastic pollution, most FMCG companies have failed
to meaningfully reduce single-use plastic packaging and
adopt reuse-based alternatives.24  In this context, the FMCG
sector’s  continued  dependence  on  single-use  plastic
packaging  is  helping  enable  the  fossil  fuel  industry’s
move to expand plastic production.

In this report, we examine how consumer brands’ failure
to significantly reduce their reliance on single-use plastic,
combined  with  ongoing  fossil  fuel  industry  investments
of  billions  of  dollars  in  expanding  plastic  production
capacity,  risk  creating  a  plastic  boom  that  could  triple
production capacity by 2050. In addition to accelerating

the  plastic  pollution  crisis,  this  expansion  poses  a  serious
threat to our ability to stay within the 1.5 °C carbon budget.
Specifically, we examine:
•  How  FMCG  companies  are  failing  to  transparently
impacts  of  their  plastic

report  the  full  climate
packaging;

•  Supply chain connections between nine major FMCG

companies and the fossil fuel industry;

•  The decades-long focus on recycling as a smokescreen

to enable increased plastic production;

•  Climate impacts and issues with “chemical recycling”;
•  Human  health  and  environmental  justice  impacts  of

the petrochemical expansion;

•  Key geographies where the expansion is happening;

and

•  The  need  for  FMCGs  to  shift  to  package-free  or
reusable systems of delivery to stop enabling the fossil
fuel industry expansion and to help meet climate goals.

CONTRIBUTING

GHGs are emitted at every stage of the plastic life cycle. During oil
and gas extraction, gas consisting mainly of methane – a GHG tens
of times as powerful as carbon dioxide – leaks into the atmosphere.
In oil fields that lack gas processing infrastructure, gas from wells may
be intentionally vented or flared (burned off): the latter consumes the
methane  but  releases  large  amounts  of  carbon  dioxide  and  other
harmful air pollutants. Emissions also result from the fossil fuel-derived
energy consumed by the drilling process and the piping of oil and gas
to processing facilities, as well as from leaking pipelines and tanks.

Energy is used by each stage in the production of plastic packaging
from  raw  natural  gas  or  crude  oil.  These  include  refining  out  the
feedstock, such as ethane (one of several gaseous so-called “natural
gas liquids” processed out from the methane that is the main constituent
of  natural  gas)  or  naphtha  (a  liquid  fraction  refined  from  crude  oil),
“cracking”  this  feedstock  into  substances  called  olefin  monomers,25
polymerizing these monomers and processing them further into plastic
resins with the desired qualities, and then manufacturing packaging
items from these resins. These processes all involve GHG emissions, with
cracking  being  especially  energy-intensive.  Between  some  of  these
stages there are transport-related emissions too.

Once plastic packaging is discarded, it may end up being burned
in an incinerator/waste-to-energy plant or (especially in developing
countries) in the open air. Both scenarios release large amounts of
GHGs and other harmful air pollutants. Alternatively, the packaging
may  be  recycled.  Mechanical  recycling  is  said  to  produce  around
half the emissions that would result from production of an equivalent
amount of virgin plastic.26 So-called “chemical recycling” processes
may be even more energy-intensive; companies have been reluctant
to disclose their emissions, but the available data indicate very large
carbon footprints.

If plastic packaging is sent to a landfill, emissions are largely confined
to those from its collection and transportation. However, plastic at the
surface of landfills, as well as plastic that ends up in the environment,
degrades on exposure to sunlight, emitting methane and other gases.27
Plastic in the oceans may also interfere with plankton’s ability to absorb
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,28 which serves as a vital brake
on global heating. In 2019, the estimated global emissions of the entire
plastic life cycle (including incineration) for that year were calculated to
be equivalent to those of nearly 200 coal-fired power stations.29

Many  analyses  of  plastics’  climate  impact  have  focused  on
the  emissions  from  resin  production  and  manufacturing  of  plastic
products,30  overlooking  the  large  upstream  contribution  of  fossil
feedstocks  and  the  impact  of  disposal.  CIEL  has  estimated  that  oil
extraction,  transportation  and  refining  for  plastic  production  are
responsible for emissions of 108 million metric tons CO2e worldwide, with
natural gas extraction and transportation for plastic production in the

U.S. alone contributing an additional 9.5 to 10.5 million metric tons
a year.31 The boom in gas and oil fracking is of particular concern,
owing to large-scale leakage and venting of methane.32

Analyses  that  include  these  embedded  upstream  emissions
have estimated the average emissions of plastic  production at
around 5 metric tons CO2e per metric ton of plastic if end-of-life
emissions (associated with landfill, incineration or recycling) are
also included.33

While  many  FMCG  companies  disclose  the  GHG  emissions
attributed to their overall supply chain, and in some cases the total
emissions that they attribute to plastic packaging, none of the nine
major companies on which we have focused in this report (Coca-
Cola,  PepsiCo,  Nestlé,  Mondelēz,  Danone,  Unilever,  Colgate-
Palmolive, Procter & Gamble and Mars) publicly discloses how it
calculates the emissions produced by each metric ton of plastic
that  it  uses  –  making  independent  verification  of  their  claims
impossible. Given that historically some life-cycle analyses of
plastic performed by or relied on by FMCG companies do not
fully include the impacts attributable to oil and gas exploration,
extraction  and  processing,  the  GHG  emissions  of  these
companies’ plastic packaging could be much higher than they
realize or are willing to disclose. This could also be the case if the
companies are failing to take proper account of the risk of their
packaging being incinerated, for example, by mapping their local
sales  data  onto  publicly  available  information  about  municipal
waste disposal methods.

The plastic supply chain is largely opaque, making it hard
to trace an individual single-use plastic package sold by an
FMCG company back through the processes of packaging
manufacturing,  plastic  resin  production,  petrochemical
production,  and  oil  and  gas  extraction,  refining  and
processing. However, establishing supply chain links is made
somewhat easier by the fact that many of the world’s largest
fossil  fuel  companies  are  vertically  integrated  businesses
with  significant  downstream  operations,  supplying  and
processing  oil  and  gas,  producing  petrochemicals  and
manufacturing  plastic  resin  –  in  fact,  some  of  them  are
among the world’s largest plastic resin producers.

This  report  looks  at  the  supply  chain  relationships
between  nine  major  FMCG  companies  responsible  for
significant  amounts  of  plastic  pollution  globally,  and  12
key  resin  producers  providing  the  world  with  plastic  resin
and  packaging.  Ten  of  the  resin  suppliers  are  large  fossil
fuel  companies,  and  only  two  exclusively  make  plastic
and plastic packaging. At least one analysis suggests that
nearly all of the plastic producers profiled here have at least
half  of  their  capacity  tied  directly  to  plastic  packaging.34
To determine which companies to include for this analysis,
we  reviewed  worldwide  2019  plastic  resin  production
capacity,  prioritizing  polyethylene  and  polypropylene  for
their relevance to the plastic packaging market. Of the top
25  plastic  resin  producers,  we  examined  ExxonMobil  (#1
in  worldwide  capacity),  Dow  (#2),  SABIC  (#3,  a  subsidiary

of Saudi Aramco), Ineos (#5), Braskem (#6), Formosa (#8),
Total (#12), Indorama (#13), Chevron Phillips Chemical (#15)
and Borealis (#22, a subsidiary of OMV).35 Shell36 and Eni37
(through its subsidiary Versalis38) are also key players in the
production of single-use plastic packaging.

Despite  the  FMCG  sector’s

lack  of  transparency
concerning  its  plastic  supply  chains,  our  investigation
revealed plastic supply chain connections between every
single  FMCG  company  we  researched  and  at  least  one
major  fossil  fuel  and/or  petrochemical  company.  Coca-
Cola,  PepsiCo,  Nestlé,  Mondelēz,  Danone,  Unilever,
Colgate-Palmolive, Procter & Gamble and  Mars  all buy
packaging  from  manufacturers  supplied  with  plastic
resin  or  petrochemicals  by  well-known  companies  like
ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron Phillips, Ineos and Dow. All the
connections our research identified are shown in the supply
chain graphic and in the Appendix.39

To  establish  these  supply  chain  connections,  we
consulted detailed import/export records40 and analyzed
customer–supplier  relationships  via  the  Bloomberg  data
service.41  We  also  reviewed  publicly  available  sources,
including  company  annual  reports,  press  releases  and
websites, and identified plastic manufacturers co-located
at FMCG manufacturing facilities.

To understand the nature of the relationships we found
and that are presented in this chart, it is helpful to consider
the example of PET bottles.

THE PET BOTTLE
One  of  the  most  iconic  and  familiar  plastic  packaging
materials is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), used for water
and soda bottles as well as bottles for shampoo, liquid soap
and body wash. For the majority of the nine FMCG companies
highlighted in this report, PET represents a large share of their
packaging portfolios by weight.42 For example, in 2020, PET
made approximately 45% of the total packaging mix used
by  Coca-Cola43  49%  and  27%  respectively  of  the  plastic
packaging used by Danone,44 and Colgate-Palmolive.45

The  use  of  PET  bottles  has  long  been  justified  by  the
beverage  industry  on  the  grounds  that  they  are  more
environmentally friendly than other packaging types because
of  their  lower  weight,  and  thus  lower  transport-related
emissions.46 Indeed in the late 1960s, Coca-Cola sponsored
the first life-cycle analysis to justify the use of plastic for its
soda bottles in light of rising environmental concerns around
disposable  plastic  bottles.47  However,  recent  analyses
suggest  that  PET  is  one  of  the  more  emissions-intense
plastics,  second  only  to  polystyrene,  when  total  life-cycle
emissions are considered.48

HOW A PET BOTTLE IS MADE
PET is a type of polyester. The two primary raw materials
for  PET  are  the  petrochemicals  monoethylene  glycol
(MEG),  also  known  as  ethylene  glycol,  and  terephthalic
acid (TPA) or purified terephthalic acid (PTA).49 TPA/PTA
itself is produced from paraxylene (PX), which is produced
at oil refineries, generally from naphtha,50 while MEG is
produced  from  ethylene,  via  the  intermediate  ethylene
oxide.51  PET  specifically  and  polyester  more  broadly
represent  a  key  end  use  of  both  TPA/PTA52  and  MEG.53
TPA/PTA  is  reacted  with  MEG  to  produce  PET  resin.54
The  resin  is  heated  until  molten,  then  injection-molded
into what are known as PET preforms, which can later be
blown into plastic bottles. PET resin can also be extruded
into sheets that can then be formed into packaging such
as cupcake trays and fruit and vegetable containers.
KEY MANUFACTURERS
Key manufacturers of both PET and TPA/PTA include Alpek
(notably U.S. subsidiary DAK Americas), Indorama Ventures
(IVL) and Nan Ya Plastics (a subsidiary of Formosa). Growth
projections  indicate  that  Indorama’s  PET  capacity  could
reach 6 million metric tons per year by 2024, nearly double
that of its closest competitor Alpek/DAK Americas.55 Ineos
Oxide is the largest producer of ethylene oxide and MEG in
western Europe.56

DIFFERENT WAYS OF OPERATING
Some  PET  producers  are  integrated,  meaning  that  they
produce  and  market  petrochemicals  and  resin  (in  the
form  of  chips  or  pellets),  as  well  as  PET  preforms,  bottles
and  sometimes  finished  bottles  (with  caps  and  closures).
PET  producers  also  sell  their  PET  resin  to  packaging
manufacturers, such as Amcor or Berry Global,57 that use it
to make preforms, bottles, sheets, and rigid PET packaging,
which are then sold to FMCG companies. Some beverage
companies,  however,  make  their  own  PET  bottles  from
purchased  resin,  or  blow-mold  bottles  from  purchased
preforms. Some large beverage companies even engage a
packaging company to set up a bottle manufacturing plant
within their production facility (co-location).

Thai-based Indorama is an example of an integrated
petrochemical and resin manufacturer; it claims that one
in five PET bottles in the world is manufactured from its
resins.58  In  recent  years  Indorama  has  purchased  key
petrochemical inputs from fossil fuel companies Chevron
Phillips  (ethylene),  ExxonMobil  (PX,  ethylene),  Ineos
(ethylene),  SABIC  (MEG)  and  Shell  (MEG).59  Indorama
reportedly  secured  a  long-term  contract  to  purchase
ethane and propane feedstock from Targa Resources in
2016, for its hydrocarbon cracking facility (“cracker”) in
Louisiana.60 Targa has natural gas fractionation facilities
at  Mont  Belvieu,  Texas,61  and  owns  gas  gathering  and

processing infrastructure across the U.S., including in the
Permian Basin, at the heart of the U.S. fracking boom.62
Indorama  stated  as  recently  as  2019  that  Coca-Cola,
PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble were three of its four main
customers.63 As of 2018, Nestlé had also been a major
customer.64 Indorama’s supplier relationships with Coca-
Cola,65 PepsiCo66 and Nestlé67 have been corroborated
in the press and through research by Greenpeace USA.
OTHER PLASTIC PACKAGING
Just  as  with  the  PET  bottle,  almost  every  type  of  plastic
packaging  is  the  end  product  of  its  own  multi-stage
production  process  that  begins  with  a  fossil  fuel  –  oil,  gas
or coal. While these processes differ in their details, the overall
business relationships are similar. Some of the world’s largest
resin  producers,  such  as  ExxonMobil,  Shell  and  Chevron
Phillips,  are  vertically  integrated  fossil  fuel/petrochemical
companies  that  make  their  own  petrochemicals  from  their
oil and gas operations – sometimes purchasing additional key
inputs from other companies – and then produce and market
plastic resin. Some of these companies, including ExxonMobil,
produce  and  market  resins  specifically  designed  for
particular  packaging  applications,  such  as  films,  wraps
and  pouches.68  These  resins  are  purchased  by  packaging
manufacturers such as Amcor and Berry Global Group Inc.;
such companies are known as “converters,” as they convert
the resin into products.

THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY UNPACKEDAs demonstrated through the public LinkedIn accounts
of self-identified current and former ExxonMobil Chemical
employees, the company (like some other fossil fuel and
petrochemical companies with significant plastic interests)
likely  has  connections  with  large  FMCG  companies,
including Mars, PepsiCo, and Unilever.69

In  our  investigation,  we  also  found  evidence  that
some of the FMCG companies on which we focused have
received  shipments  of  plastic  resin  produced  by  large
integrated  resin  manufacturers.  For  example,  Colgate-
Palmolive  has  received  shipments  of  Chevron-branded
high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  resin  from  a  Chevron
distribution division.70

Frequently,  however,  FMCG  companies  are  supplied
by specialist packaging manufacturers without significant
upstream  interests,  among  the  most  notable  of  which
is  Amcor.  Amcor  is  a  global  business  manufacturing
flexible  and  rigid  packaging,  specialty  cartons  and
closures, polyethylene film and bags; the vast majority of
its sales are of flexible packaging (accounting for 78% of
its  revenue  in  2020).71  Amcor  designs  and  manufactures
flexible  packaging  for  many  large  FMCG  companies,
including  all  nine  highlighted  in  this  report:  Coca-Cola,
Colgate-Palmolive,  Danone,  Mars,  Mondelēz,  Nestlé,
PepsiCo,  Procter  &  Gamble  and  Unilever.72  PepsiCo  is
one of Amcor’s largest customers: 8% of Amcor’s revenue
was attributable to PepsiCo as of July 2021.73 Amcor has
a  plant  co-located  with  a  PepsiCo  Gatorade  factory  in
Mountaintop, Pennsylvania,74 and also manufactures PET
containers  for  PepsiCo’s  Lipton  tea  in  Central  America.75
Amcor and Nestlé have partnered to create recyclable pet
food pouches and candy packaging;76 about 5% of Amcor’s
revenue is attributable to Nestlé.77 Approximately 1.8% of
Amcor’s revenue is attributable to Unilever,78 with Amcor
supplying  products  such  as  home  laundry  packaging  to
Unilever in India.79 Danone provides about 1.5% of Amcor’s
revenue,80  with  products  including  PET  yogurt  jars  for
Danone’s  La  Serenisima  brand  in  Argentina.81  Mondelēz
and  Amcor  have  partnered  to  produce  chocolate  tray
packaging for Mondelēz’s Cadbury brand.82 Amcor’s resin
suppliers include ExxonMobil Chemical, Borealis, Alpek/
DAK Americas, Indorama and Dow.83 Thus, all nine of the
consumer goods companies featured in this report have
indirect supply chain connections through Amcor to Alpek/
DAK Americas, Borealis, Dow, ExxonMobil and Indorama.
Many global shipments of polyethylene and polypropylene
films originate at Amcor’s Italy plant, which is adjacent to a
large Eni facility.

Berry  Global  is  another  major  global  manufacturer
and  marketer  of  plastic  packaging  products.  Berry  has
claimed  to  be  the  largest  resin  buyer  among  plastic
packaging  manufacturers,  procuring  approximately  3.2
million metric tons of resin annually (mostly polyethylene and
polypropylene).84 The company’s suppliers of resin include
Total and SABIC,85 and it has received plastic closures from
Shell.86 Berry also recently entered into a supply agreement
with Borealis.87 Berry’s known customers include Coca-Cola,
Colgate-Palmolive, Mondelēz, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Procter &
Gamble and Unilever.88

Alpla  is  a  privately  owned  company  headquartered
in Austria, and one of the largest packaging producers in
Europe.  It  specializes  in  blow-molded  bottles  and  caps,
injection-molded  parts,  preforms  and  tubes.  Alpla  has
received HDPE resin from Braskem and Ineos, and both
HDPE  and  polypropylene  from  SABIC.89  Alpla  has  also
received PET from Indorama.90 Alpla’s known customers
include  Coca-Cola;91  Colgate-Palmolive;92  Procter
&  Gamble,  for  which  it  produces  bottles  for  Head  &
Shoulders  shampoo  with  up  to  25%  “beach  plastic”;93
PepsiCo,  for  which  it  produces  50%  recycled  PET
bottles;94  and  Unilever,  for  which  it  makes  bottles  for
Dove bodywash.95 Thus, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive,
PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever have indirect
supply chain connections via Alpla to Braskem, Indorama,
Ineos  and  SABIC.  Similar  indirect  connections  between
FMCG  and  fossil  fuel/petrochemical  companies  were
identified via a number of other packaging manufacturers.
The  only  petrochemical  companies  included  in  the
graphic for which we found no links with the nine FMCG
companies we focused on were Formosa and Eni/Versalis.
Given  Formosa’s  ranking  as  the  sixth-largest  chemical
company96  and  tenth-largest  producer  of  propylene97
in  the  world,  and  in  view  of  its  operations’  reported
health impacts on communities, the lack of supply chain
information about the company is particularly concerning.
Unsurprisingly,  FMCG  companies  tend  not  to
advertise  their  reliance  on  the  industry  that  poses
the number one threat to the global climate. This lack
of  transparency  allows  FMCG  companies  to  evade
accountability  for  any  environmental  and  human  rights
violations  committed  by  the  companies  that  supply  the
plastic  or  fossil  feedstocks  for  their  plastic  packaging,
and  to  trumpet  climate  commitments  that
ignore
their  role  in  enabling  the  fossil  fuel  industry’s  pivot  to
expand  production  of  petrochemicals  that  are  used  to
make plastic.

THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY UNPACKEDBIG BRANDS AND THE
FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY
USE  RECYCLING
AS A SMOKESCREEN

It is clear that plastics recycling cannot resolve the plastic
pollution  problem  and  is  being  used  as  a  smokescreen
by  industry  to  divert  attention  away  from  the  systemic
changes that are needed. Globally, as of 2015, only 9%
of  all  plastic  waste  ever  created  had  been  recycled.98
One study estimated that less than 1% of plastic has been
recycled  more  than  once.99  The  vast  majority  of  plastic
packaging  ends  up  either  “downcycled”  into  lower-grade
products or in a landfill, in the environment or incinerated.100
One  analysis  reported  the  2018  U.S.  domestic  plastic
recycling  rate  at  just  2.2%,101  and  similarly  abysmal  rates
can be found around the world. Recent Greenpeace USA
research shows that much of the plastic packaging used by
food and beverage companies in the U.S. has so little chance
of being recycled by municipal systems that the “recyclable”
labels on the products in question appear not to meet the
legal requirements for such claims, putting the companies at
risk of legal challenge for deceptive marketing.102
To  take  one  company-specific  example,

in  2020
Mondelēz  reported  to  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation
that  93%  of  its  total  packaging,  including  a  significant
proportion of its plastic packaging, was “designed for the
future of recycling,” but conceded that most of its plastic
packaging  “is  not  currently  recycled  ‘in  practice  and  at
scale’ as is required to be considered recyclable under the
[Foundation’s  own]  Global  Commitment103  definition”  –  in
fact, the proportion that actually met that definition was a
mere 2%.104 Mondelēz also makes the 93% recyclability claim
on its website but without clarifying that in reality just 2% of its
plastic packaging is actually recyclable.105

Some  types  of  packaging  are  effectively  unrecyclable
because of their design – for example, sachets and pouches
that  typically  consist  of  layers  of  different  materials  (also
known as “flexibles”).106 These are widely used in the global
North  for  products  from  snacks  to  pet  food,  and  are
ubiquitous  in  India  and  parts  of  Southeast  Asia  as  a
means  of  marketing  personal  care  and  other  products,
especially  to  low-income  households.107  Though  Unilever
claims  to  have  developed  a  process  to  recover  the
polyethylene  (the  main  constituent)  from  such  sachets,
this  has  not  been  proved  commercially  viable.108  Another
(Materials  Recovery
flexible  waste  recycling  project

for  the  Future)  has  found  collected  material  to  be
of insufficient quality for like-to-like recycling.109 Regardless
of  the  technological  shortcomings,  the
logistics  and
economics  of  collecting  flexible  plastic  waste  make  its
recycling unviable at scale.

“CHEMICAL RECYCLING”
“Chemical  recycling”  is  the  next  act  of  a  decades-long
effort  by  the  fossil  fuel  and  consumer  goods  industries
to  convince  the  public  that  recycling  can  mitigate  the
massive  environmental  costs  of  single-use  plastic  despite
overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

Currently, commercial-scale technologies promoted by
industry as “chemical recycling” or “advanced recycling”
involve  one  of  two  related  “plastic-to-fuel”  processes:
gasification  and  pyrolysis.  Both  use  heat  to  break  down
the  polymer,  not  into  its  constituent  monomers,  but
respectively  into  either  a  hydrogen-rich  gaseous  mixture
called  “syngas”  or  a  cocktail  of  various  gaseous  and
liquid hydrocarbons. While either of these outputs can then
in theory be further processed to create olefin monomers
from  which  new  plastic  can  be  produced,  in  practice
they tend not to be of sufficient quality.110 They can more
readily  be  refined  into  fuel111  –  which  is  then  burned  with
the  emission  of  just  as  much  GHG  as  the  equivalent
conventional  fossil  fuel,112  making  nonsense  of  the
“recycling”  claim.  The  fact  that  the  U.S.  petrochemical
sector’s front organization, the American Chemistry Council
(ACC),  in  arguing  for  light-touch  regulation  of  chemical
recycling, states that “Advanced recycling facilities … receive
plastic feedstock that is converted to valuable fuels and
petroleum products” and that “regulations should identify
fuels  and  petroleum
companies  that  manufacture
products from post-use plastics feedstock as producers of
alternative  energy”113  shows  clearly  where  the  industry’s
priorities lie. One major pyrolysis proponent, Dow Chemical,
has even admitted to the National Recycling Coalition that
its program “is not recycling.”114

Moreover,  even  when  the  output  of  plastic-to-
fuel  plants  is  further  processed  into  new  plastic,  the
energy-intensive multi-stage process entails high GHG
emissions.  Studies  have  exaggerated  plastic-to-fuel’s

REALITY

THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY UNPACKEDemissions  performance  by  assuming  that  the  plastic
processed  would  otherwise  have  been  incinerated  and
subtracting the corresponding emissions,115 and by arguing
that  the  pyrolysis  process  can  generate  most  of  its  own
energy, though this is only made possible by burning some
of the hydrocarbons produced in the process – effectively
incinerating  a  percentage  (often  a  considerable  one)  of
the waste plastic feedstock. Thus the less external energy
input the plant uses, the greater the GHG emissions from
the plant itself and the lower its output of olefins.116

When  gasification  uses  municipal  solid  waste  as  a
feedstock, its global heating potential is up to seven times
that  of  virgin  plastic  production  if  “avoided  emissions”
from  waste  incineration  are  ignored.117  The  oil  produced
by pyrolysis is so impure that it can only be cracked to make
olefins if it is first subjected to energy- and carbon-intensive
purification, or mixed with a much larger quantity of virgin
feedstock, further undermining the technology’s low-carbon
pretensions.  Moreover,  pyrolysis  and  gasification  emit
carcinogens and other toxins.118

Finally,  the  economics  of  “chemical  recycling”  appear
not  to  be  viable  without  heavy  government  subsidies  due
to the low value of the recovered feedstock.119 It is therefore
unsurprising that, according to the ACC’s own figures, shale
gas-driven  investment  in  U.S.  petrochemical  facilities  is
currently outpacing investment in “chemical recycling” by over
12 to 1.120 Rather than limiting plastic production, “chemical
recycling” appears if anything to be providing an excuse
to increase it.121 In any case, as with mechanical recycling, it
would not be in the fossil fuel industry’s interest for “chemical
recycling” to be so successful that it began to threaten virgin
plastic production.122 Furthermore, the need to earn a return
on the capital investments in facilities using such technologies
will necessitate a steady plastic waste stream, and so could
be used to justify a ramping up of virgin plastic output.

BIG BRANDS’ COLLABORATION
WITH THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY

Despite the failures of plastic recycling, FMCG companies
have  been  working  in  partnership  with  the  fossil  fuel,
petrochemical and packaging sectors to promote recycling,
oppose legislation that would restrict single-use packaging
and/or adopt so-called “chemical recycling” as part of their
“circular economy” commitments.

The petrochemical industry has been aware of doubts
about  the  economic  viability  and  technical  limitations
of  recycled  plastic  for  decades.123  Initially  oil  companies
set  up  their  own  recycling  projects,  but  more  recently  the
industry has relied on targeted investment in existing local
infrastructure  and  research  and  development,124  along
with  lobbying  for  public-sector  investment.125  At  the  end
of  the  1980s  industry  players  also  began  a  successful
lobbying campaign to persuade state legislatures that the

international recycling symbol should be made mandatory on
all  plastic  packaging.  By  this  means,  industry  largely
succeeded  in  convincing  the  public  that  all  plastic
is  recyclable  and  thus  environmentally  acceptable,
protecting  its  highly  profitable  core  business  of  selling
virgin,  non-recycled  plastic.126  Though  there  is  growing
public skepticism as to whether material of all kinds sent for
recycling is actually recycled, and confusion around plastic
recyclability, recycling participation rates remain high.127

Despite  knowing

the  economic  and

technical
shortcomings of plastic recycling, the fossil fuel/petrochemical
sector  and  FMCG  companies  frequently  collaborate  to
promote recycling as the primary solution to the plastic crisis
and  lobby  against  restrictions  on  single-use  plastic.  Such
alliances  can  trace  their  inspiration  back  to  Keep  America
Beautiful, an organization set up in the 1950s to promote the
idea that litter was consumers’, not companies’, responsibility –
and still going strong today with board membership including
BlueTriton Brands (formerly Nestlé Waters North America128),
Mars, PepsiCo and Dow Chemical.129 In the late 1980s, faced
with the threat of anti-plastic legislation at the state and even
federal level, the U.S. plastic industry reportedly embarked on
a multimillion-dollar PR campaign.130 The industry front group
Society of the Plastics Industry (later to become the Plastics
Industry  Association,  or  PLASTICS131)  set  up  the  Council  for
Solid Waste Solutions,132 which reportedly involved fossil fuel
and  plastic  companies,  including  Amoco,  Chevron,  Dow,
DuPont, Exxon and Mobil, as well as FMCG major Procter &
Gamble.133 Even though many in the industry had long been
aware  that  the  economic  and  technical  viability  of  plastic
recycling  was  doubtful,134  the  Council,  the  Society  and  the
wider industry proceeded to campaign successfully across
the U.S. to avert the threat of restrictions on plastic packaging
by promoting recycling.135 Companies including Amoco and
Mobil even set up short-lived recycling projects themselves,136
although the public sector soon began to shoulder most of
the cost of plastic recycling.137

In a 2020 investigative report by the National Public Radio,
Larry  Thomas,  former  president  of  PLASTICS,  underscored
the apparent intent behind the industry’s recycling playbook,
saying  “If  the  public  thinks  that  recycling  is  working,  then
they are not going to be as concerned about the environment.”
Thomas  continued,  “You  know,  they  were  not  interested  in
putting any real money or effort into recycling because they
wanted to sell virgin material. Nobody that is producing a virgin
product wants something to come along that is going to replace
it. Produce more virgin material — that’s their business.”138

A  newer  front  group  pushing  a  similarly  disingenuous
message is the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, formed in 2019 –
this time with the involvement of two FMCG majors, PepsiCo and
Procter & Gamble, alongside dozens of fossil fuel and plastic
companies.139 The Alliance sponsors projects aiming to improve
recycling  infrastructure  and  develop  “chemical  recycling”
technologies,140  but  has  yet  to  announce  any  significant
achievements. Its highly publicized project with Renew Oceans

18

THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY UNPACKED

to  recycle  plastic  waste  from  India’s  River  Ganges  recently
closed after allegedly collecting just one metric ton of waste.141
The Alliance’s status as a charity obscures the fact that it was
set  up  as  a  project  of  the  ACC,142  which  represents  nearly
150  chemicals,  plastic  and  packaging  companies.143  The
ACC itself was an early opponent of anti-plastic bag laws,144
spending  more  than  $9m  between  2007  and  2010  on
obstructing bans in California and Seattle alone.145

Other  ACC  front  groups

include  the  misleading
Wrap  Recycling  Action  Program,  which  encourages  U.S.
consumers  to  drop  off  wrappers,  bags  and  flexible
packaging  at  stores,  even  though  they  will  mostly  end
up being downcycled – if they are recycled at all;146 and
Materials  Recovery  for  the  Future  (MRFF),  a  research
initiative  whose  FMCG  members  and  supporters  include
Johnson  &  Johnson,  KraftHeinz,  Mars,  Mondelēz,  Nestlé,
PepsiCo,  Procter  &  Gamble,  SC  Johnson,  Unilever  and
Walmart.147 MRFF is supposedly aiming to pioneer recycling
of  post-consumer  flexible  packaging,  but  in  practice
appears focused mainly on downcycling opportunities.148

Most recently the ACC has lobbied the U.S. government
to  oppose  anti-plastic  legislation  in  Kenya  in  order  to
expand  U.S.  export  markets,149  was  an  early  opponent  of
domestic plastic bag laws (through its front organization the
Progressive  Bag  Alliance)150  and  has  promoted  so-called
“advanced  recycling.”151  At  the  same  time  it  has  pledged
to ensure that all plastic packaging is “re-used, recycled or
recovered” – but not until 2040,152 a date hardly consistent
with the 45% global emissions cut needed by 2030 to keep
within the 1.5 °C barrier.153

The  Society  of  the  Plastics

Industry’s  successor,
PLASTICS,  has  continued  to  lobby  across  the  U.S.,  along
with  the  ACC,  successfully  pressuring  state  legislators
to  introduce  preemptive  laws  against  plastic  bans.154
PLASTICS  does  not  disclose  its  membership,  although
Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and SC Johnson are known to have
been  members  until  they  left  in  2019  following  public
pressure.155  FMCG  companies,  including  PepsiCo  and
Unilever, have joined with the ACC, PLASTICS and others in
supporting the US RECOVERY Bill, which proposes a $500m
boost for recycling while restricting funds for incineration –
but does not address the need to reduce single-use plastic
production.156  The  Recycling  Partnership,  with  members
including PepsiCo, Colgate-Palmolive, Nestlé and Procter &
Gamble, as well as the ACC,157 is reportedly pursuing a similar
agenda, calling for investment in recycling while failing to
support the introduction of state-level legislation requiring
refundable deposits on plastic bottles (even though such
legislation and the resultant collection infrastructure have
been shown to increase collection rates massively).158 Such
lobbying  activity  is  not  confined  to  the  U.S.:  Coca-Cola,
Danone, L’Oréal and Nestlé, along with a number of plastic
and packaging companies including Alpla and Greiner, are
members  of  an  Austrian  group  called  Packaging  With  a
Future159 which encourages reliance on plastic packaging160

and has opposed the introduction of minimum quotas for
the proportion of reusable packaging sold by retailers.161

In  addition  to  joint  lobbying,  FMCGs  have  been
partnering with fossil fuel companies to push “chemical”
or  “advanced  recycling”  to
justify  their  continued
reliance on single-use plastic. One FMCG major, Procter &
Gamble, has even developed its own process to purify and
recycle contaminated polypropylene using a gas solvent.162
It  has  licensed  this  to  a  company  called  PureCycle,163
which  has  in  turn  partnered  with  Nestlé  to  develop  new
packaging164 and signed a supply agreement with L’Oréal.165
It has also partnered with two FMCG packaging suppliers:
petrochemical  giant  Total,  with  which  it  has  a  strategic
partnership encompassing a U.S. supply agreement and a
commitment to explore the feasibility of a plant in Europe;166
and packaging company Aptar, with which it has formed a
product  development  partnership.167  In  May  2021,  a  class
action lawsuit was filed alleging PureCycle executives made
false and misleading statements, including overstating the
effectiveness of the company’s technology.168

Coca-Cola,169  Danone,170  L’Oréal171  and  PepsiCo172  all
signed supply agreements for recycled bottles with Loop
Industries,  a  Canadian  startup  developing  a  new  low-
heat, pressureless depolymerization project in partnership
with plastics giant Indorama.173 The company claimed the
process  could  produce  virgin-quality,  food-grade  PET
resin from inputs “of any color, transparency or condition,”
including ocean-degraded plastic.174 As of 2020, PepsiCo
and  L’Oréal  were  still  citing  their  involvement  with  Loop
(described  in  PepsiCo’s  case  as  a  “partnership”)  as
evidence of their environmental commitments.175 However
in  late  2020  Loop  faced  accusations  from  investment
research firm Hindenburg that it had grossly exaggerated
the efficacy and financial viability of its technology.176 Two
weeks later, Coca-Cola canceled its agreement with Loop
after the company failed to deliver by the agreed date.177
Soon  afterward  an  “independent  review”  commissioned
by  Loop  apparently  confirmed  the  technical  viability  of
its  process,178  but  Hindenburg  responded  by  pinpointing
numerous  flaws  in  the  review’s  scientific  methodology
and noted that in any case its failure to address questions
concerning  the  process’s  yield  and  economic  viability
made it “largely meaningless.”179 Loop is now facing a class-
action lawsuit alleging securities fraud.180

While Loop was at least purporting to offer a plastic-
to-plastic  technology,  FMCG  companies  have  also
partnered with fossil fuel and technology companies to
develop pyrolysis (“plastic-to-fuel”) plants – for example,
Mars and Nestlé with Total and Recycling Technologies.181
Buyers  of  pyrolysis-derived  plastic  from  Saudi  Aramco
subsidiary  SABIC’s  TruCircle  range182  include  Unilever,
which  has  used  it  for  its  Knorr183  and  Magnum184
brands, and Mars, which has begun to use it in pet food
packaging.185  Procter  &  Gamble  has  announced  it  will
use chemically recycled resin from Indorama.186

THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY UNPACKEDTHE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY IS
EXPANDING PLASTIC PRODUCTION
THREATENING CLIMATE AND HUMAN HEALTH

The  cross-sector  promotion  of  recycling  (and  “advanced
recycling”)
is  enabling  fossil  fuel  and  petrochemical
companies to appear committed to addressing the plastic
pollution  crisis  while  continuing  to  invest  massively  in  new
infrastructure to extract oil and gas to make virgin plastic.187
The  fact  that  fossil  fuel  companies  are  investing  hugely
both in new fossil exploration and production188 and in new
ethane crackers189 and associated virgin plastic production
strongly  suggests  that  they  do  not  envisage  a  wholesale
shift to recycled plastic. Indeed, a study from the Minderoo
Foundation  found  that  none  of  the  world’s  largest  100
polymer producers procures more than 2% of its feedstock
from recycled or bio-based materials.190

If  business  as  usual  continues,  industry  estimates
predict  that  plastic  production  could  double  by  2030-
2035  and  triple  by  2050,  in  comparison  to  2015.191  One
conservative  estimate  predicts  that  by  2050  the  sector
will  have  used  up  between  10%  and  13%  of  the  world’s
1.5 °C carbon budget (the remaining allowance of carbon
emissions  that  must  not  be  exceeded  if  we  are  to  stay
within the 1.5°C carbon budget).192

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IMPACTS
The expansion of plastic production, if allowed to continue,
won’t only impact our climate and environment. The toxic
and carcinogenic pollutants that fossil fuel extraction and
plastic production emit193 alongside GHGs will continue to
threaten the health of more communities close to the new
facilities (in the U.S. a burden disproportionately borne by
low-income communities and communities of color).194

Fossil

sites,195

fuel  extraction

refineries196  and
petrochemical  plants197  all  emit  a  range  of  toxic  and
into  the  air,  putting  nearby
carcinogenic  chemicals
communities as well as local ecosystems at risk. In the case
of  fracking,  surface  and  groundwater  pollution  can  also
be significant.198 A recent compendium of scientific studies
“uncovered no evidence that fracking can be practiced in a
manner that does not threaten human health.”199

As  of  2010  in  the  U.S.,  17.6  million  people  (6%  of  the
population)  lived  within  a  mile  of  an  active  oil  or  gas
extraction  site.200  According  to  the  recent  report  Fossil
Fuel Racism by Greenpeace USA, the Gulf Coast Center
for Law & Policy and the Movement for Black Lives,201 56%
of the “toxic burden” of U.S. refineries is borne by people
of color (who make up 39% of the country’s population)
and 19% by low-income people (who make up 14% of the

Turning

to  end-of-life

population). The petrochemical sector’s impact on people
of color is even worse: they bear 66% of the toxic burden,
while 18% falls on low-income people. For both refineries
and  petrochemical  facilities,  a  majority  of  toxic  burden
falls in areas that have both above-average populations
of color and below-average income.202
impacts,

toxic  emissions
from  incineration  of  plastic  and  other  waste  materials
(including so-called “waste-to-energy”) also threaten the
health of nearby residents.203 In the U.S., approximately
80%  of  waste  incinerators  are  located  in  low-income
communities,  communities  of  color,  or  both.204
Incinerators being built in the UK are following the same
pattern: they are three times more likely to be built in the
poorest communities than in the wealthiest ones. Moreover,
existing  UK  incinerators  tend  to  be  located  in  areas  with
above-average populations of people of color.205 Landfills
often present similar environmental injustices.206

The  plastic  waste  trade  also  particularly  impacts
communities in the Global South – where historically much
of  Europe  and  North  America’s  plastic  waste  has  been
exported, supposedly for recycling. China used to take the
bulk of this waste, but since it banned plastic imports in 2018,
plastic  waste  streams  have  been  redirected,  first  toward
Southeast Asian and African countries207 and more recently
to Turkey as well.208

A  series  of  investigations  has  revealed  exported
waste from countries in the Global North being illegally
dumped and polluting local environments. For instance,
Greenpeace investigators from Italy, UK,  and Malaysia
found  household  plastic  from  countries  including  the
UK,209  Italy210  and  Germany211  at  multiple  illegal  dump
sites in Malaysia, while a BBC investigation found British
plastic waste being burned near communities in Turkey.212
A  2019  Frontline/NPR  investigation  found  plastic  waste
exported from the U.S., supposedly for recycling, being
Indonesian  communities.213  Greek  and
dumped
Liberian  authorities  remain  at  loggerheads  about  an
illicit shipment of plastic waste from Greece to the West
African nation in late 2019.214

in

Such disputes can drag on for years. Between 2013 and
2014,  103  shipping  containers  of  mixed  municipal  waste
from Canada, including unrecyclable plastics, were illegally
dumped215 in the Philippines. Although 69 containers were
eventually repatriated in 2019 after numerous campaigns for
their return, the contents of 26 containers were dumped in
open landfills and eight remain unaccounted for to this day.216

THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY UNPACKEDWHERE THE EXPANSION
IS HAPPENING AND
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE

There is limited publicly available data regarding which
companies are expanding and where plastic production is
set to increase. However, recent analysis from the Minderoo
Foundation  shows  that  of  the  companies  we  examined
for this report, Exxon, Shell, Saudi Aramco, Formosa and
Borealis  are  among  the  top  producers  planning  to  add
virgin  polymer  capacity  between  2020  and  2025.217
According to the analysis, Exxon is one of three producers
adding the most capacity, and Shell is notably expanding
capacity at a rate of 145% over the same five-year period.
In terms of where in the world new plastic production
facilities are likely to be built, we know that currently Asia,
North America and Europe are the biggest producers;
within  Asia,  China  is  the  major  player,  producing  an
estimated  31%  of  the  world’s  plastics,  according  to
PlasticsEurope.218

Data  on  future  expansion  is  difficult  to  find,
however  projected  ethylene  production  offers  a
reasonable  proxy  for  future  plastic  expansion,  and
here  data  are  available.  Industry  analysts  identify
India,219 North America, the Middle East,  China  and
Southeast  Asia220  as  key  regions  looking  to  expand
ethylene  production  capacity.  Factors  expected
to  drive  expansion  in  these  regions  include  cheap
ethane  (North  America221  and  the  Middle  East),
low  capital  costs  (China)  and  unmet  demand  for
ethylene derivatives along with the desire to balance
trade  and  generate  employment  (China,  India  and
Southeast Asia). However, China and North America
are  expected  to  continue  to  be  the  largest  drivers
of  global  ethylene  demand  growth  as  they  add
production capacity for ethylene and derivatives. 222

This  expansion  has  serious  implications  both  for  the

Following  are  three  snapshots  from  around  the  world,
showing  how  the  fossil  fuel/petrochemical  sector  is
ignoring both the climate imperative and public health in
pursuit of increased plastic profits.

JIM FITTERLING, CEO DOW CHEMICALS

TAFT, ST CHARLES

Louisiana’s  “Cancer  Alley”  is  a  region  along  the  lower
Mississippi River that acquired its nickname in the 1980s as
a  result  of  suspected  cancer  clusters  that  locals  believed
stemmed from toxic pollution from nearby chemical plants.223
The region currently has nearly 150 oil refineries and plastics
and chemicals facilities.224 It is also home to an above-average
Black/African  American  population225  whose  human  rights
are  severely  threatened  by  the  concentration  of  polluting
industries,  according  to  the  UN.226  One  study  found  that
census  tracts  with  the  highest  risk  of  toxic  air  pollution
exposure  were  predominantly  located  in  two  parishes,
East  Baton  Rouge  Parish  and  Orleans  Parish,  which  had
Black/African  American  populations  of  84%  and  60%
respectively.227 According to the EPA’s 2015 National Air Toxics
Assessment map, seven out of the 10 census tracts with the
highest levels of air pollution-related cancer risk in the U.S.
are located in St. John the Baptist Parish,228 another of the
11 parishes that make up Cancer Alley.229 As the founder of
environmental justice group RISE St. James puts it, polluting
industries “come to Black communities because they think no
one’s going to say anything.”230

RISE St. James is based in another Cancer Alley parish, St.
James. Taiwanese company Formosa Plastics aims to build an
enormous plastic production complex in St. James Parish – a
project driven, as the firm acknowledges, by growing plastic
demand  and  the  falling  cost  of  gas,231  but  also  consistent
with  the  company’s  reported  desire  to  develop  production
overseas  due  to  opposition  to  air  and  water  pollution  in
Taiwan.232  According  to  opponents,  among  other  things
the  complex  will  produce  resins  and  petrochemicals  to  be
used  for  single-use  plastic  packaging.233  The  complex  is  to
be located next to a predominantly Black/African American
community and just a mile from an elementary school,234 yet
the  Louisiana  Department  of  Environmental  Quality  (LDEQ)
gave it approval to emit high levels of multiple carcinogens
and  other  harmful  pollutants,235  on  the  basis  of  state-level
standards that campaigners say ignore current science from
the U.S. EPA.236 EPA data show that another Formosa plant,
in Baton Rouge, breached the Clean Air Act every quarter
between  2009  and  2018.237  Toxic  pollution  aside,  the  new
complex, due to be fully operational by 2029 (but with its first

stage to be completed by 2024), has been approved to emit
13.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year – equivalent
to  the  emissions  of  2.6  million  cars.238  Lawyers  representing
a  Formosa  subsidiary  reportedly  downplayed  the  plant’s
climate  impact  with  the  bizarre  argument  that  because
its  emissions  would  be  “miniscule”  in  national  and  global
terms, its potential contribution to climate change should be
regarded as “also miniscule, assuming there are any effects
at all”; meanwhile, the LDEQ explained its air quality permit
approval  on  the  grounds  that  because  “GHGs  emitted
anywhere in the world affect climate everywhere in the world,”
the project will “have no more impact on Louisiana (relative
to GHGs) than if the facility was constructed elsewhere, but
will provide the social and economic benefits.”239 Though it has
no jurisdiction over the plans, in April 2021 the New Orleans City
Council expressed unanimous opposition to the plant, citing
fears over potential environmental and public health impacts
on the city, even though New Orleans is 65 miles downriver
from  the  site.240  Formosa’s  plant  is  just  one  of  88  new
petrochemical facilities under construction or planned in the
Gulf region.241

Farther  down  the  Gulf  coast,  ExxonMobil’s  Baytown
complex  near  Houston,  Texas,  includes  an  olefins  facility,
one of the largest ethylene plants in the world. The facility’s
history  of  air  quality  violations  goes  back  at  least  to  the
1990s, and in the decade 2010 to 2019 the Texas Commission
on  Environmental  Quality  fined  it  22  times,  with  the  EPA
imposing additional penalties for Clean Air Act breaches.242
Negative impacts from the Baytown facility have been shown
to disproportionately affect both people of color and low-
income populations.243 Yet despite this history and a Sierra
Club lawsuit aimed at preventing the facility’s expansion,244
in  2019  it  saw  completion  of  a  multi-billion-dollar  ethane
cracker  to  feed  two  polyethylene  lines  that  started  up  in
2017 – all part of ExxonMobil’s 10-year, $20 billion “Growing
the Gulf” expansion program.245 Within months of the new
cracker’s  completion,  an  explosion  and  fire  at  the  olefins
plant  had  injured  37  and  necessitated  a  shelter-in-place
order to local residents.246 Unfortunately, safety incidents are
a relatively common occurrence for chemical facilities. As of

Although  Europe  favors  naphtha  as  a  petrochemical
feedstock  (as  was  the  case  in  the  U.S.  until  the  fracking
boom), significant amounts of natural gas liquids (ethane,
propane  and  butane)  are  also  used,  and  naphtha’s
importance  as  a  feedstock  in  Western  Europe  was
projected  to  fall  by  more  than  25%  between  2010  and
2020.254 The EU is keen to diversify its energy supplies, and

in  2018  European  Commission  President  Jean-Claude
Juncker  pledged  to  support  infrastructure  investment  to
facilitate liquefied natural gas imports from the U.S., which
was eager to boost gas exports.255 This trend, along with the
low price of U.S. shale gas, is likely to help drive a switch to
ethane as a petrochemical feedstock in Europe, along with
the associated development of facilities.

The Port of Antwerp in Belgium is the world’s second-largest
petrochemical cluster after Houston and sits at the heart of the
Western European pipeline network, with dedicated pipeline
systems for naphtha, ethylene and propylene, among others,
serving a multitude of sites.256 A number of firms are expanding
or  upgrading  their  cracking  capacity  in  the  region  to  take
advantage of cheap gas feedstocks – including Total, which
has upgraded its Antwerp plant in part to enable one cracker
to use ethane imported from Norway;257 and Borealis, which
has been sourcing U.S. ethane for its cracker in Sweden since
2016258 and is building what will be one of the world’s largest
propylene plants at Antwerp.259

However,  Anglo-Swiss  chemical  giant  Ineos  is  the
European  company  that  is  likely  investing  most  heavily
in  plans  reliant  on  U.S.  fracking.  Ineos,  which  claims  to
be  Europe’s  largest  ethylene  producer,260  has  its  own
fleet of tankers (the so-called Dragon ships) that began
importing U.S. shale gas-derived ethane to Europe in 2016.
Ineos states that it has invested $2 billion in its U.S. ethane
supply chain, including the ships and infrastructure in the
U.S.  and  Scotland,  and  it  has  signed  15-year  contracts
for  U.S.  ethane.261  In  October  2020,  Ineos  announced
that it will also import U.S. butane to Antwerp.262 In 2020,
the company itself obtained its first permits to drill in the
Texas shales.263 Ineos’s founder has predicted a “shale gas
revolution” in the UK264 and has said “Shale gas economics
has  revitalized  U.S.  manufacturing.  When  U.S.  shale  gas
arrives in Europe, it has the potential to do the same for
European  manufacturing.”265  The  company  attributes  its
switch to U.S. shale gas to historic high feedstock prices
and poor availability in Europe.266

In  2019,  Ineos  announced  a  £3  billion  ($4.1  billion)
investment in a new ethane cracker – supposedly the first
in Europe for 20 years – and a propylene plant at Antwerp,
specifically citing the need to compete with the fracking-
driven  U.S.  petrochemical  expansion.  Both  plants  are
intended  to  process  U.S.  shale  gas  shipped  by  Ineos.267
Ineos  presents  the  cracker  as  a  low-carbon  alternative
to  crackers  that  use  naphtha,  and  claims  that  the  two
plants’ huge processing capacity will not equate to new
plastics production capacity but will simply enable the firm
to replace more carbon-intensive feedstock – while also
justifying virgin plastic production as necessary to boost
the  performance  of  recycled  plastic.268  However,  in  the
wake of a delay caused by legal action,269 and facing a
poor economic outlook along with the wider petrochemical
sector,  Ineos  suspended  construction  of  the  propylene
plant in January 2021.270

ASIA

FROM BIG TO BIGGER

Northeast  Asia  has  been  the  largest  producer  and
consumer of ethylene in recent years – accounting for 27%
of global capacity and around 29% of global demand in
2020. Industry experts predict that the region’s ethylene
output will continue to increase rapidly and that capacity
additions in the region will total around 28 million metric
tons in the period from 2020 to 2025.271

This growth is predicted to be led by mainland China,
which  is  expected  to  have  eight  ethylene  crackers
become  operational  in  2021.  This  expansion  will  raise
China’s effective ethylene capacity to 39.8 million metric
tons per year by the end of the year – a 23% increase
from 2020.272 It follows the startup of six new ethylene
crackers  in  2020,  which  is  calculated  to  have  taken
effective  ethylene  capacity  to  32.2  million  metric  tons
per year by the end of that year, up by 21% from 2019.273

This  Chinese  capacity  growth  has  been  partly
(JVs)  and
driven  by  several
collaborations  with  global
fuel  and
petrochemical  majors.  For  instance,  China’s  state-
controlled  Sinopec  Engineering  has  reportedly

joint  ventures
fossil

signed  an  engineering  and  construction  contract
with  ExxonMobil  for  the  latter’s  planned  Huizhou
petrochemical  complex
in  Guangdong  Province.
Early  construction  work  for  the  complex,  which  will
include  a  1.6  million  metric  tons  per  year  flexible-
feed  steam  cracker  and  downstream  polyethylene
and polypropylene plants, began in April 2020, with
startup planned for 2023. In what is unusual for a non-
Chinese company, ExxonMobil will own 100% of the
project.274 International companies involved in JVs in
China include ExxonMobil itself (also with Sinopec),275
BASF,276 Shell277 and SABIC.278

While naphtha remains by far the most widely used
feedstock  in  Northeast  Asia,  much  of  China’s  ethylene
capacity growth in the years since 2012 has been based
on coal-to-olefin and methanol-to-olefin plants because
of the cost advantages that they offered at a time of high
oil prices.279 However, with pressure on new coal-to-olefin
projects due to climate and other environmental impacts,
recent years have seen growing interest in importing U.S.
ethane as a feedstock, with several new ethane crackers.

beSouth  Korea  is  also  predicted
to be a leader in the construction
of new crackers,280 with three such
facilities expected to be completed
in  2021.  GS  Caltex  is  building  a
mixed-feed cracker with capacity
to  produce  700,000  metric  tons
per year of ethylene and 350,000
metric tons per year of propylene. It
is expected to be fully operational
sometime  in  2021  and  will  have
an
integrated  500,000  metric
tons  per  year  of  polyethylene
capacity.281 Korean petrochemical
firm  LG  Chem’s  second  cracker
at  Yeosu  began  operating
in
June  2021  after  a  technical  issue
forced the new plant to shut down
for  several  days.  The  cracker  is
intended  to  have  800,000  metric
tons per year of ethylene capacity
and 800,000 metric tons per year
of  fully  integrated  polyethylene
capacity.282  Hyundai  Oilbank  and
Lotte  Chemical  are  involved  in
a  joint  venture  in  Daesan  which
includes building a steam cracker
and  downstream  units  capable
of  producing  850,000  metric
tons per year of polyethylene and
500,000  metric  tons  per  year  of
polypropylene. It is expected to be
operational by the end of 2021.283

under

India  is  also  a  potential  focus
for expansion, with the government
having recently announced a raft
of  new  petrochemical  projects.
Around  11  projects  worth  about
$17  billion  are  scheduled  to  be
completed  by  2024,  and  new
projects
consideration
are worth a potential total of $87
billion.  These
include  Nayara
Energy’s  proposed  $20  billion
complex  at  Vadinar  in  Gujarat,
which  as  reported  may  include  a
cracker and downstream units for
polypropylene  and  polyethylene.
There  are  also  proposals
to
invest  an  additional  $10  billion
in  expanding  production  of
polypropylene,  polyethylene  and
PVC  at  the  already  vast  Reliance
Industries-owned  Jamnagar  site
in Gujarat.284 These proposals are

part of plans to more than double
the  megacomplex’s  conversion  of
crude to chemicals to 35%, at the
expense of fuel production.285

Ethylene production capacity in
Southeast  Asia  has  increased  by
43% in the last 10 years, with growth
driven  both  by  increasing  regional
demand for ethylene and derivatives
and by the region’s proximity to the
Chinese market.286 Large olefins and
derivatives  complexes  have  been
constructed in Singapore, Thailand
and Malaysia in the last decade,287
and  new  capacity  is  planned  for
the  coming  years  in  Indonesia,288
Vietnam289 and Brunei.290

In Thailand, after many delays
petrochemical producer PTT Global
Chemical  (PTTGC)  is  reported  to
have started commercial operation
of its fifth cracker at Map Ta Phut – a
naphtha cracker with the capacity
to  produce  500,000  metric  tons
per  year  of  ethylene  and  260,000
metric tons per year of propylene –
in March 2021.291

In  2019  Malaysia’s

state-
owned  Petronas  started  up  a  1.29
million metric tons per year cracker
complex at Pengerang in a JV with
Saudi Aramco. However, production
has twice been halted by explosions
and  is  not  set  to  resume  until  the
fourth quarter of 2021.292

In  Indonesia,  a  JV  between
Russia’s Rosneft and state-owned PT
Pertamina (known as PT Pertamina
Rosneft Pengolahan dan Petrokimia
or PRPP) is developing an integrated
refinery and petrochemical complex
at  Tuban,  one  of  several  new
facilities  planned  for  the  island  of
Java.  Scheduled  to  be  completed
by  2025,
it  reportedly  aims  to
produce  1.2  million  metric  tons  per
year  of  polypropylene  products,
1.3  million  metric  tons  per  year  of
paraxylene and 650 metric tons per
year of polyethylene.293

These  are  just  a  few  examples
of  the  many  expansion  projects
currently  under  way  or  planned
around  the  world  —  more  of  which
are detailed on the global map.

THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY UNPACKEDBIG BRANDS MUST SHIFT
TO REUSE TO STOP THE
PETROCHEMICAL EXPANSION
AND MEET CLIMATE GOALS

Clearly, given the detrimental impacts to communities and
the  need  to  keep  climate  change  below  1.5  °C,  the  fossil
fuel  industry  cannot  be  allowed  to  continue  expanding
petrochemical production to make plastic.

The consumer goods sector has a clear choice to make:
Companies can rapidly move away from single-use plastic
and  seriously  invest  in  reuse  and  packaging-free  based
delivery systems, or they can continue to enable the fossil
fuel  industry’s  attempts  to  ramp  up  plastic  production
behind the smokescreen of recycling.

Among  progressive  businesses,  governments  and
nongovernmental  organizations,  there
is  already  a
consensus that our current linear economic model with its
“take, make, dispose” philosophy must be abandoned in
favor of a circular model that decouples economic activity
from  the  consumption  of  finite  resources  and  designs
waste out of the system. Reuse will be central to such a slow
circular economy, with recycling confined mainly to dealing
with reusable packaging that has reached the end of its life.
However,  while  some  major  FMCG  companies  have
acknowledged  the  need  to  either  avoid  packaging
altogether or replace single-use packaging with containers
that can be reused a large number of times,294 to date not
one  has  committed  to  targets  for  large-scale  reuse  or
significant  reduction  of  single-use  plastic  packaging.  For
instance, big brands like Coca-Cola, Nestlé and PepsiCo

have  all  made  high-level  pledges  to  tackle  plastic
pollution  that  focus  on  recycling,  while  in  reality  these
companies  and  others  in  the  sector  have  made  very
little progress on reducing throwaway plastic. In fact, a
2020 review of action by companies signed up to the Ellen
McArthur  Foundation  Global  Plastics  Commitment  found
that plastic packaging use by signatories actually grew by
0.6% in 2019 and that reusables accounted for just 1.9% of
their packaging, up just 0.1% from the previous year.295

Instead,  most  brands  continue  to  propose  plastic
recycling  as  the  central  solution  to  the  plastic  pollution
crisis, even though there is abundant evidence of its failure.
This is despite the fact that multiple studies have shown
that reusing packaging is far less carbon-intensive than
relying on single-use packaging. For instance, one  life-
cycle assessment study estimated that if the glass bottles
used in the food and drinks packaging sector were reused
by up to three times, it would save approximately 50,000
metric tons of CO2e per year. 296

It’s  time  for  these  big  brands  to  shift  direction  –  to
reduce both their dependence on oil and gas and their
plastic  footprints  and  move  beyond  the  throwaway
culture that single-use plastic exemplifies – by investing
in reuse- and packaging-free–based delivery systems and
other  innovations.  Governments  must  encourage,  assist
and, where necessary, compel them to act.

FOLLOWING STEPS:

MOVE QUICKLY TO ALTERNATIVE
DELIVERY SYSTEMS BASED ON REUSE

•  Set reuse targets of at least 25% reusable packaging
by  2025  and  50%  by  2030.297  Sectors  for  which  a
switch to reuse is comparatively easy – such as soft
drinks, mineral water, alcoholic beverages and coffee
chains – should set more ambitious targets than this.

PHASE OUT ALL SINGLE-USE PLASTIC

•  Support development of an ambitious Global Plastics
Treaty that will address the entire plastics life cycle and
emphasize the need to reduce plastic production and
eliminate single-use plastic.

•  Support bans on the plastics waste trade.

MOVE TOWARD A ZERO-WASTE ECONOMY

•  Adopt  a  zero-waste  approach  that  progressively

waste sectors (including waste-picker communities
where present).

ENCOURAGE A PHASE-OUT OF SINGLE-USE PLASTIC

Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Paris Agreement states: “This
Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention,
including its objective, aims to strengthen the global response
to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable
development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by: (a)
Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well
below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to
limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial
levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks
and impacts of climate change.” See United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (2015) p.3.

Howarth (2019)

33  Material Economics (2019) pp.104, 106-107, drawing on data

from PlasticsEurope and the IPCC, estimates average life cycle
emissions of 5 metric tons of carbon dioxide (not CO2e) per met-
ric ton of plastic, comprising 2.3 metric tons from production
(including oil/gas production and refining) and 2.7 metric tons
from disposal (assumed to be by incineration). The presentation
of carbon dioxide rather than CO2e figures may indicate an
underestimate of total global heating potential (if methane
emissions have been omitted) or may simply be an error. The
latter seems possible, given the very similar estimate arrived at
by ODI (2020) p.27, which, drawing on a number of earlier studies
including the above, estimates an average 4.9 metric tons CO2e
per metric ton of plastic as of 2015 (again including oil/gas
production and end-of-life emissions from incineration, landfill
or recycling).

between July 2017 and February 2021 (American Chemistry
Council (2021a)), compared with investments in completed or
under-construction chemical facilities as a whole of $128bn
since 2010, with projects worth a further $81bn at the planning
stage – the scale of these investments being attributed to the
shale gas boom (American Chemistry Council (2021b)).

127   For example, a 2016 U.S. national survey for Keep America

Beautiful found that 33% of all respondents were skeptical that
their curbside recycling (not specifically plastic) was actually
recycled, with millennials being the most skeptical age group at
43% (Keep America Beautiful (2016)). A similar 2019 survey for
the Carton Council is reported to have found a 44% overall level
of skepticism, though 85% of its respondents reported that they
did recycle (Mohan (2019)). A 2019 survey by YouGov for packag-
ing company Hi-Cone found that 31% of respondents in the four
survey countries (the US, the UK, Spain and Mexico) believed that
only a quarter of what they put in recycling bins was recycled,
while a further 34% believed that only half was recycled, and

56% of respondents (48% in the U.S.) “found recycling different
plastics difficult to understand”; nevertheless 75% of adults
(60% in the U.S.) engaged in some recycling at home (Hi-Cone
(2020) pp.5, 11, 18). Another survey conducted by YouGov for
Hi-Cone in 2020 (with different questions) found that 61% of
respondents across the four countries claim to recycle at least
75% of their plastic waste (Hi-Cone (2021) p.12).

187  Despite the impact of the Covid pandemic, which saw upstream
oil and gas investment fall by nearly a third in 2020, global
investment still totaled $328bn (IEA (2020)). See also Carbon
Tracker (2020), Charles et al. (2021) and Rainforest Action
Network (2021).

Between 2010 and 2017 in the U.S., fossil fuel and
petrochemical companies reportedly invested $186bn in new
cracking facilities that will produce the raw materials for
plastics (see Taylor (2017)). ExxonMobil alone has an ongoing
$20bn-plus program of petrochemical expansion just in the U.S.
Gulf Coast region (see ExxonMobil, Growing the Gulf (Online)).

294  Greenpeace does not in general consider the replacement of

single-use plastic packaging with single-use packaging made
of other materials such as paper, card, glass or metal – even
when recyclable – to be a satisfactory solution to the problems
created by plastic, as this has the potential in its own right to
exacerbate climate change and other environmental crises. See
