GREENPEACE SECURITY
INSPECTION REPORT
FACILITY: KUEHNE CHEMICAL
COMPANY SOUTH KEARNY, NJ

FACILITY: KUEHNE CHEMICAL COMPANY SOUTH KEARNY, NJ

COMPANY: KUEHNE CHEMICAL COMPANY

FINDING: FAILURE TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC RISKS

According to the Kuehne Chemical Company’s own
reports to the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), its South Kearny New Jersey facility puts
12,000,000 people at risk in the New Jersey-New York
City area due to the bulk storage of 2 million pounds
of chlorine gas. This plant puts more people at risk of
a chemical disaster than any other plant in the U.S.

The fatal explosions at the Tesoro refinery in
Tumwater, Washington on April 2nd, which killed
seven workers, and at BP’s Deepwater oil rig on April
20th, which killed eleven workers and triggered the
largest oil disaster in U.S. history are costly reminders
of the catastrophic risks inherent in many petro-
chemical processes.

These catastrophic risks existed well before
September 11, 2001. Kuehne is also well aware of
safer chemical processes that could eliminate these
risks. Since 9/11 the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) has advised chemical facilities that
the magnitude of a terrorist attack may well be “more
severe” than the “worst case” accident scenarios
reported by Kuehne and other companies to the EPA.

In July 2002, the N.Y. Daily News ran a front page story listing
the highest risk plants in the metropolitan area, including
Kuehne at: www.nyenvirolaw.org/PDF/DailyNews-7-14-
02-toxicTimeBombsAtChemicalPlants-terrorStrikeCo
uldEndangerMillions.pdf

In November 2003, CBS’ 60 Minutes featured a story
on the hazards of U.S. chemical plants and their
vulnerability to terrorism, which also included Kuehne’s
South Kearny facility.

Instead of adopting a safer available process at this
plant, Kuehne has asked for $50 million in taxpayer
funds to convert to a safer process. Meanwhile, other
companies such as K2 Pure Solutions are planning
new facilities in California without taxpayer funding.

According to Kuehne, “The main planned change to
improve safety is the ongoing security analysis, and
implementation of security measures and devices
such as the strategic placement of surveillance
cameras around the facility.”

In a May 6, 2003 letter to Kuehne Chemical,
Greenpeace suggested several safer processes
including on-site generation of small quantities of
chlorine that are used on a “just-in-time” basis.
This eliminates the hazards inherent in storing 90-
ton rail cars of chlorine gas. In 2008, Dow Chemical
announced a partnership with K2 Pure Solutions
(k2pure.com) to use this process to address this risk
at Dow’s Pittsburgh, California plant.

The failed terrorist car bomb in New York City’s Times
Square on May 1st and the June 7th arrests of terror
suspects in New Jersey have also re-newed concerns
about terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.

Although the DHS plans to inspect “high risk”
chemical plants, it admitted at a March 3rd Senate
hearing that they will inspect only approximately 4
percent of all 5,333 high risk plants by the end of 2010.
Many of these plants use chlorine gas or other toxic-
by-inhalation (TIH) substances.

Under the interim authority of the temporary law,
however, the DHS has no authority to require the
use of safer chemical processes that can eliminate
a chemical facility as an attractive terrorist target or
prevent an accidental disaster.

Kuehne is a member of the largest lobbying
association of the chemical industry, the American
Chemistry Council (ACC). The ACC opposed
conditional requirements to use safer chemical
process in the legislation (H.R. 2868) that passed the
U.S. House of Representatives in November, 2009. In
their 2003 letter Greenpeace urged Kuehne to break
with the ACC and support policies now in the House
passed bill.

In November 2009, Clorox announced that they will
convert all of their U.S. facilities that use chlorine gas
to safer processes. Also the Association of American
Railroads “strongly support efforts to replace TIH
materials with less hazardous substitutes and new
technologies wherever possible.”

Whether its terrorism or accidents, the only sure
way to safeguard employees and surrounding
communities is prevention. In this regard the Kuehne
plant has failed to fully secure their facility against
terrorists or catastrophic accidents.

12 MILLION PEOPLE AT RISK

STORAGE CAPACITY: 2 MILLION POUNDS OF CHLORINE
Plant Production & Functions:
Bleach Manufacture (Sodium Hypochlorite) & Chlorine Repackaging

RISK ASSESSMENT

Worst-Case-Scenario For One Of Many Onsite Rail Cars
• One 90-ton railcar can release of 180,000 lbs. chlorine gas

• 14-mile radius of downwind vulnerability zone

• 11 rail cars can be on site. True worst-case-scenario is release 2 million lbs. of chlorine gas

Vulnerability Zone

• Jersey City

• New York City

• Newark International Airport

• LaGuardia Airport

Accident History 2000-2010

• 8 chlorine release incidents

Greenpeace’s inspection reveals these chemical railcars, one labeled as chlorine, and 1 ton cylinders inside the Kuehne
Chemical Co. in South Kearny, NJ on May 13, 2010. These pictures were taken from the pedestrian walkway on the Pulaski
Skyway. There is a fence on the skyway that runs part of the length of the facility and is meant to add security to the facility but,
as demonstrated by the photo, when standing on either side of the fence, one has a clear, unobstructed view of the facility. This
facility failed inspection because it puts 12 million people at risk including inhabitants of New York City.

Greenpeace inspectors examine the Kuehne Chemi-
cal Co. in South Kearny, NJ from the Hackensack
River on March 13, 2010. Greenpeace inspected the
facility and failed it because the plant stores up to
2 million pounds of chlorine gas that put 12 million
Americans at risk of a chemical disaster including
inhabitants of New York City. No amount of fencing,
cameras, or gatekeepers can eliminate the inherent
danger of this facility.
