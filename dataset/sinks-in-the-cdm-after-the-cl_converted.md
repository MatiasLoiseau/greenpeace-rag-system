Sinks in the CDM:
After the climate, biodiversity
goes down the drain.

An analysis of the CDM sinks agreement at CoP-91.

SUMMARY

CoP-9 has agreed the rules of accounting for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry,
so  called  “Sinks”,  projects  in  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  for  the  first
commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  as  required  by  the  Marrakech  Accords
(17/CP.7, 10(b)). This document presents a rough guide and analysis of the key decisions
that were made in Milan at CoP-9 on CDM sinks rules (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27)2.

As  is  well  known,  Greenpeace  and  many  other  environmental  groups  have  long  been
opposed  to  the  inclusion  of  sinks  projects  in  the  CDM,  and  this  opposition  remains.
Nevertheless,  Parties  have  agreed  to  include  sinks  and  consequently  the  focus  of  our
efforts  since  Marrakech  has  been  to  ensure  that  the  rules  have  climatic,  environmental
and social integrity.

After the key climate concern was overruled by allowing “offset-sinks” into the CDM at
CoP-6bis,  the  current  rules  should  at  least  have  prevented  subsidies  to  environmentally
and  socially  damaging  projects.  Unfortunately,  the  door  is  now  wide  open  for  projects
with disastrous effects for biodiversity and local livelihoods. Such projects should now,
and most likely will, be opposed on the ground and investors should be held accountable.

Sinks in the CDM: Post-CoP9 analysis – 19th December 2003

No  party  acting  in  good  faith  should  want  to  give  Kyoto  a  bad  reputation  by  using
monocultures or genetically modified organisms in the name of climate protection.

The last years of negotiation have clearly revealed the fact that the main advocates of the
use of sinks projects (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan) are universally opposed to
rules that would provide this integrity.  In many ways the positions that these countries
have  argued  have  borne  out  the  worst  fears  of  opponents  to  sink  projects.    It  has  only
really been the concerted opposition of the European Union, the Environmental Integrity
Group  (Switzerland,  Mexico,  South  Korea)  and  Norway  that  has  enabled  the  worst
excesses of these countries to be watered down.  Once again developing countries, as a
group,  have  acted  in  such  a  way  as  to  score  own  goals  against  their  environment,
although many supported strong rules to reflect the impermanence of sink projects.  By
marrying  arguments  about  local  sovereignty  to  the  interests  of  industrial  plantation
advocates  many  of  them  have  missed  an  opportunity  to  redress  democratic  deficits  and
power imbalances between those with project financing from the industrialized countries
and those most affected in the host countries.  In effect, many developing countries have
missed  a  major  opportunity  to  use  international  law  to  advance  local  sustainable
development objectives.

In terms of the detail of the decisions taken at CoP-9 there is not much good news for the
environment  or  local  communities  in  the  final  sinks  rules.  Large  scale  plantations  with
non-native  monocultures,  possibly  using  genetically  modified  organisms  and  displacing
local  inhabitants,  will  be  allowed  under  these  rules;  and  as  the  final  insult,  local
communities  and  stakeholders  will  only  have  minimal  chance  to  comment  on  projects
and no real influence over the decision and final design.

Greenpeace  calls  on  all  Parties  not  to  use  any  sink  projects  for  reaching  their  Kyoto
targets for two reasons:

1)  Credits  from  sink  projects  will  allow  higher  fossil  fuel  related  emissions.  No
political  or  financial  resources  must  be  diverted  from  the  pivotal  task  of
promoting  renewable  energy  sources  and  energy  efficiency,  if  we want  to  avoid
catastrophic climate change.

2)  The  agreement  adopted in  Milan does  not  rule out  environmentally  and  socially

destructive projects.

Greenpeace  specifically  calls  on  all  governments  to  keep  sink  credits  out  of  national
emissions trading systems, such as the European Emission Trading System.

BACKGROUND

Although  the  last  stage  of  the  negotiations  was  focused  on  the  modalities  of  how  to
include  sinks  in the  CDM,  the primary  climatic  concern  should not be forgotten.  Many
parties together with environmental NGOs were and are opposed to the inclusion of sinks
as offsets. Why? Accounting for sinks allows for higher fossil fuel emissions. In order to
reach  safe  climate  levels,  emissions  from  the  inert  energy  systems  have  to  be  reduced
dramatically over the coming years and decades. Any diversion of political and financial
resources  away  from  this  tremendous  task  can  render  the  ultimate  goal  of  the  climate
change  Convention  unachievable:  ‘the  prevention  of  dangerous  interference  with  the
climate system’.

A major inherent problem of sinks is the risk of re-emissions of sequestered carbon in the
future (non-permanence). Fires, pest attacks, and increased need for agricultural land are
likely to turn today’s sinks into future sources. Thus, allowing higher fossil fuel related
emissions today by doing afforestation projects is like borrowing from future generations.
In 20, 30 or 50 years, future societies will have to make up for any re-emission. However,
at that time they will also be faced with a much higher mitigation and adaptation burden.
Thus,  if  sink  reversal  occurs  in  the  future,  it  is  unlikely  that  truly  additional  emission
reductions will be possible due to the high mitigation and adaptation burden at that time.
Furthermore, the argument that sinks “buy us time” would only materialize if new energy
saving/efficiency  technologies  and  behavioral  changes  would  ‘fall  from  the  sky’.
Otherwise, the ‘buying time’ argument is simply a myth. Since ‘learning-by-doing’ is the
only viable way to spur the development and – more importantly – the dissemination of
sustainable  technologies,  the  climate  will  suffer  for  every  euro  that  we  invest  in  sink
projects instead of energy saving & efficiency or renewable projects.

As decided in Bonn, in July 2001 (CoP-6bis), eligible forestry activities under the CDM
are constrained to afforestation and reforestation projects. Furthermore, the acquisition of
such  credits  by  Annex  I  countries  has  been  limited  to  1%  of  the  country’s  base  year
emissions.  The  exact  definitions  and  modalities  for  the  inclusion  of  afforestation  and
reforestation projects were not agreed upon at CoP-6bis, but deferred to CoP-9. After 2
years of negotiations, the modalities were finally agreed in Milan in December 2003. This
document provides an overview and brief assessment of the agreed rules.

Sinks in the CDM: Post-CoP9 analysis – 19th December 2003

ISSUE-BY-ISSUE ANALYSIS
In the following, the key issues within the adopted CDM sink rules for the first
commitment period are highlighted.

1. Industrial Plantations:

The  current  rules  leave  the  door  wide  open  for  destructive  large-scale  monoculture
plantations.  Although  the  Project  Design  Document  contains  certain  requirements  to
report  on  what  the  social  and  environmental  impacts  might  be  (see  below),  there  is  no
international minimum standard to judge whether certain impacts are unacceptable or not.
This  open  door  to  destructive  projects  is  a  serious  flaw  in  the  adopted  sinks  rules.
Environmentally  and  socially  destructive  projects  will  be  opposed  (such  as  the  World
Bank PLANTAR project). No investor would want to risk its reputation by investing in
such projects.

2. GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms):

Genetically modified organisms are not excluded under the current rules. It is completely
left to the host country and the user of the CER credit, whether GMOs will be used in a
sink projects or not. The actual language is:

Recognizing  that  host  Parties  evaluate,  in  accordance  with  their  national  laws,  potential  risks
associated with the use of genetically modified organisms by afforestation and reforestation project
activities and that Parties included in Annex I evaluate, in accordance with their national laws, the
use  of  temporary  certified  emission  reductions  and/or  long-term  certified  emission  reductions
generated  from  afforestation  and  reforestation  project  activities  that  make  use  of  genetically
modified organisms, (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 2).

In order to operationalize this language, the buyer of a CER credit, the Annex I country,
has to know, whether the project uses GMOs or not. Thus, there is language in the project
design document that requests to report the used “species and varieties”:

2. […] The description shall include the following:
 (a) A description of the afforestation or reforestation project activity [    ] including species and
varieties  selected  and  how  technology  and  know-how  will  be  transferred,  if  appropriate;  [      ];
(FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 18, Appendix B, para 2(e))

The big question is whether the need to report on ‘varieties’ comprises the duty to say,
whether GMOs have been used or not. Canadian lawyers might try to find a way around
this.

Sinks in the CDM: Post-CoP9 analysis – 19th December 2003

3. MEAs (Multilateral Environmental Agreements):

The  link  to  other  multilateral  environmental  agreements  has  now  been  watered  down
beyond recognition (primarily thanks to Canada). The language in the current text even
turned  into  the  opposite  of  what  should  have  been  achieved.  Instead  of  requesting
synergies  and  coherence  between  the  UNFCCC,  and  the  Convention  on  Biological
Diversity  (CBD),  the  Convention  to  Combat  Desertification  (CCD)  and  the  Ramsar
Convention on Wetlands, the current language implicitly stresses WTO Trade rules. This
could  allow  international  trade  rules  to  override  a  country’s  choice  to  not  buy  credits
from environmentally damaging sinks projects on the international market.

Cognizant of relevant  provisions of international agreements  that may  apply to afforestation  and
reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism, (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27,
page 2, principles of CoP.9 Decision).

Canada deleted “environmental” from “international environmental agreements” in a last
second intervention. By not making an explicit link to the CBD, the adopted CDM sinks
rules  are  another  shameful  example  of  how  the  UNFCCC  sinks  accounting  rules
disrespect the agenda of biodiversity.

4. Socio- and Environmental Impacts.

A socio-economic and/or environmental impact assessment has only to be done, if there
are ‘any negative impacts’ considered being ‘significant’ by the project participants or the
host party. Furthermore, the impact assessment is not subject to any kind of guidelines,
but  completely  up  to  the  host  party.  This  regrettable  decision  is  due  to  the  so-called
‘sovereignty’  concerns  voiced  by  many  of  the  potential  host  countries,  as  well  the
eagerness of some Annex-I countries, like Canada, for cheap credits. Furthermore, there
was  neither  any  discussion  on  what  ‘significant’  impacts  are,  nor  are  there  any
monitoring requirements for those impacts that were assumed not to be significant at the
project start (but which might turn out to be significant later). Overall, the current rules
don’t give any guarantee that destructive projects could not go forward.

The  only  positive  element  is  that  the  Appendix  B,  and  therefore  the  Project  Design
Document, will require some information on estimated impacts. This makes it easier for
NGOs  and  local  stakeholders  to  scrutinize  projects.  However,  it  is  still  left  to  critical
stakeholders  to  take  the  time  and  energy  to  campaign  against  destructive  projects.  Not
allowing  large-scale  monoculture  plantations  in  the  first  place  would  have  saved
everybody a lot of time and trouble.

The relevant paragraph 12 (c) is:

(c) Project participants have submitted to the designated operational entity documentation on the
analysis of the socio-economic and environmental impacts, including impacts on biodiversity and
natural  ecosystems,  and  impacts  outside  the  project  boundary  of  the  proposed  afforestation  or
reforestation  project  activity  under  the  CDM.  If  any  negative  impact  is considered  significant  by
the project participants or the host Party, project participants have undertaken a socio-economic

Page 6 of 18

Sinks in the CDM: Post-CoP9 analysis – 19th December 2003

impact assessment and/or an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the procedures
required  by  the  host  Party.  Project  participants  shall  submit  a  statement  that  confirms  that  they
have undertaken such an assessment in accordance with the procedures required by the host Party
and  include  a  description  of  the  planned  monitoring  and  remedial  measures  to  address
them;(FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 7).

The relevant text in the project design document is:

2. […]
b)  A  description  of  the  present  environmental  conditions  of  the  area  including  a  description  of
climate, hydrology, soils, ecosystems, and the possible presence of rare or endangered species and
their habitats;
(c) A description of legal title to the land, rights of access to the sequestered carbon, current and
tenure and land use;
[….]

(j) Environmental impacts of the project activity:

(i) Documentation on the analysis of the environmental impacts, including impacts on biodiversity,
natural ecosystems, and impacts outside the project boundary of the proposed afforestation or
reforestation project activity under the CDM. This analysis should include, where applicable,
information on, inter alia, hydrology, soils, risk of fires, pests and diseases;
(ii) If any negative impact is considered significant by the project participants or the host Party, a
statement that project participants have undertaken an environmental impact assessment, in
accordance with the procedures required by the host Party, including conclusions and all
references to support documentation.

(k) Socio-economic impacts of the project activity:

(i) Documentation on the analysis of the socio-economic impacts, including impacts outside the
project boundary of the proposed afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM.
This analysis should include, where applicable, information on, inter alia, local communities,
indigenous peoples, land tenure,  local employment, food production, cultural and religious sites,
access to fuelwood and other forest products;
(ii) If any negative impact is considered significant by the project participants or the host Party, a
statement that project participants have undertaken a socioeconomic impact assessment, in
accordance with the procedures required by the host Party, including conclusions and all
references to support documentation.

(FCCC/SBTSA/2003/L.27, pages 19-21).

5. Stakeholder involvement:

The stakeholder requirements are very weak. The project’s location in rural areas and the
larger  size  of  sinks  projects  vs.  energy  projects  clearly  warranted  extended  stakeholder
participation  requirements.  However,  the  adopted  language  is  as  insufficient  as  in  the
current  energy  rules.  A  website  for  comments  on  a  Project  Design  Document  hardly
seems  sufficient  to  allow  input  from  rural  communities  that  have  neither  telephone  nor
internet. A much better language proposed by the EU was dropped. This language would
have required that “local stakeholders have been involved at an early stage in the project
design”.
The only language that goes beyond the inadequate stakeholder rules for energy projects,
is a slightly extended commenting period of 45 days, instead of 30 days.

(b)  Comments  by local stakeholders have  been invited, a summary  of the  comments received has
been provided, and a report to the designated operational entity on how due account was taken of
any comments has been received;
(FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 12 (b)

Page 7 of 18

Sinks in the CDM: Post-CoP9 analysis – 19th December 2003

15. The designated operational entity shall:
[…]
(c)  Receive,  within  45  days,  comments  on  the  validation  requirements  from  Parties,  stakeholders
and  UNFCCC  accredited  non-governmental  organizations  and  make  them  publicly  available;
(FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page

(n) Stakeholder comments, including a brief description of the process, a summary of the
comments  received,  and  a  report  on  how  due  account  was  taken  of  any  comments  received;
(FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 20).

6. Non-permanence / Accounting:

The non-permanence issue does not only require proper accounting and liability for any
re-emissions, but as well a strong incentive for long-term projects. Clearly, the focus of
the negotiations has only been on the accounting scheme. Safeguards against short-term
projects,  such  as  a  minimum  project  lifetime  have  been  discarded  completely  in  the
current rules.

The adopted accounting scheme offers two options, the tCER (‘temporary CER’) and the
lCER  (‘long-term  CER’)  schemes.  Both  options  are  very  similar.  In  fact,  the  tCER
accounting approach is basically a subcategory of the lCER accounting approach.

•  The  tCER  scheme  is  basically  the  original  European  tCER  proposal  (which  was
based  on  a  Colombian  proposal  from  some  years  ago).  The  project  can  generate  as
many  tCERs  as  the  number  of  tons  of  carbon  that  can  be  verified  to  have  been
additionally sequestered by the projects since the project start date. After 5 years, the
tCERs expire and have to be replaced by other credits. If a new verification is done,
new tCERs can be issued again every 5 years. Since the market price will be driven
by buyers’ optimization, the price of a tCER credit will be approximately equal to a
lCER  with  a  5-year  validity  period.  Thus  the  tCER  price  will  be  between  14%  and
41%  of  an  energy  CER  credit,  depending  on  the  assumed  effective  annual  interest
rate.

•  The lCER scheme is based on the last-minute Canadian proposal to extent the tCER
system. After Canada dropped its flawed “insurance” approaches, this new proposal
certainly has some merits. The basic idea is that the project can issue lCER credits for
every  verified  ton  of  carbon.  This  lCER  credit  has  to  be  replaced  as  soon  as  the
verification shows that the carbon stock has decreased or if no verification report is
provided within 5 years. Thus, the holder of the lCER, the Annex I country, always
faces the risk, that it has to replace the credit.

Both accounting schemes require verification/ monitoring every five years. The liability
for re-emissions rests always on the buyer side (unless certain side contracts are done on
a  private  basis)  and  is  unlimited  until  the  end  of  the  crediting  period,  when  the  lCERs
have to be replaced.

Page 8 of 18

Sinks in the CDM: Post-CoP9 analysis – 19th December 2003

In  comparison  to  tCERs,  some  elements  of  the  lCER  accounting  scheme  are  better,
namely  the  resulting  price  differentiation  from  project  to  project.  A  high-risk  project
might fail after a couple of years. Therefore, the respective “high-risk” lCERs will find
buyers only at a lower price. Projects that can be assumed to be sustainable over 60 years,
can  sell  lCERs  at  higher  prices  (see  Table  1).  However,  the  disadvantage  of  lCERs  in
comparison to tCERs is clearly the missing educative component. Buying an offset credit
that  is  valid  for  more  than  5  years,  is  likely  to  support  politicians’  myopia.  A  possible
replacement  of  lCERs  in  20  years  time  is  likely  to  be  outside  the  horizon  of  today’s
decision-makers. Thus, in summary, the lCER approach is beneficial on the seller’s side
(since  it  will  result  in  less  revenue  for  short-term,  high-risk  projects)  and  the  tCER
approach is beneficial on the buyer’s side (since a five year validity reminds the buyer of
the non-permanent nature of sinks).

Table 1 - Price of lCERs expressed as a percentage fraction of a CER from energy projects. Depending on
the  lifetime  (validity  period)  of  a  lCER  and  the  effective  annual  interest  rate  (taking  into  account  real
interest rate and CER price projections), the market price for a lCER is likely to be between 14% to 100%
of a normal CER.  Effective lCER market prices might even be slightly lower, due to a risk premium for the
buyer and ongoing costs for verification.

Validity period (Years)

95%

10%
41%
65%

Overall,  the  adopted  rules  don’t  solve  the  non-permanence  problem  of  sinks.  No
modalities  could  have  ever  solved  it,  since  the  risk  of  non-permanence  is  an  inherent
feature of sinks - in contrast to the permanent nature of emission reductions in the energy
sector.  The  lCER  accounting  scheme  seems  preferable,  since  higher  risk  /  short-term
projects  will  get  lower  revenues  for  the  issuance  of  lCERs.  Moreover,  the  rules  clearly
fail to favour long-term  over short-term projects, which could have been achieved by a
minimum project lifetime requirement.

7. Invasive alien species:

Invasive alien species are those non-native species that threaten ecosystems, habitats and
other  species  by  their  introduction.  The  current  rules  fail  to  explicitly  exclude  invasive
alien species. However, the principles in the decision text mention that ‘parties evaluate
[…] risks associated with the use of potentially invasive alien species’. Thus, one could
make the case that those species that have found to be ‘invasive’ are implicitly excluded.
Why else would one evaluate the potentially invasive alien species?

Recognizing  that  host  Parties  evaluate,  in  accordance  with  their  national  laws,  risks  associated
with the use of potentially invasive alien species by afforestation and reforestation project activities

Page 9 of 18

Sinks in the CDM: Post-CoP9 analysis – 19th December 2003

and that Parties included in Annex I evaluate, in  accordance with their national laws, the use of
temporary certified emission reductions and/or  long-term certified  emission reductions generated
from  afforestation  and  reforestation  project  activities  that  make  use  of  potentially  invasive  alien
species,
(FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 2).

8. Leakage:

On  leakage,  there  is  good  and  bad  news.  The  good  news  is  that  ‘positive’  leakage  is
excluded. This means that project developers cannot claim credits for emission reductions
or removal increases outside the project boundary. Otherwise numerous problems would
occur, such as ‘who is liable for re-emissions?’ Furthermore, claiming carbon credits for
something that is happening on somebody else’s land would be a dangerous concept. In a
conservative manner, the current rules correctly require to subtract any off-site negative
leakage from the earned credits.

The bad news is that there is no “100% default assumption” of negative leakage. With the
current  rules,  project  developers  are  inclined  to  claim  that  the  estimation  of  leakage  is
difficult, “thus leakage is assumed to be zero”. The EU proposal required that significant
leakage has either to be estimated or prevented, if the project is to claim any credits. This
proposal was – unfortunately - dropped.

9. Non-CO2 gases

The adopted rules follow a conservative approach with regard to the accounting for non-
CO2  gases.  The  adopted  language  is  acceptable.  The  “baseline”  only  includes  CO2
emissions. The “actual” project emissions take into account CO2 and

“[…]  the  increase  in  emissions  of  the  greenhouse  gases  measured  in  CO2  equivalents  by  the
sources  that  are  increased  as  a  result  of  the  implementation  of  the  afforestation  or  reforestation
project activity […] “ (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 5).

The reasoning behind this conservative approach is the following:
a)  non-CO2  gases  might  increase  significantly  due  to  project  implementation.  For
example,  if  fertilizers  are  used,  the  global warming  effect of  resulting nitrous oxide
emissions  might  counterbalance  any  CO2  sequestration  completely.  Thus,  it  is
warranted to account for any increased non-CO2 emissions.

b)  The  mere  cessation  of  previous  land-use  activities  might  result  in  a  decline  in  non-
CO2  emissions.  Since  high  non-CO2  emitting  land-use  activities  are  agriculture
activities  that  are  simply  shifted  elsewhere,  credits  would  have  been  given  without
actually decreasing emissions. Furthermore, since only afforestation and reforestation
activities  are  eligible  under  the  CDM,  the  accounting  for  discontinued  former
activities would have stretched the mandate of the negotiators.

10.  Additionality:

The text on additionality is parallel to the text in the energy decision (17/CP.7). As long
as the continuing objectivity of the Executive Board is guaranteed, the current language is
acceptable.  A particular EU proposal would have been beneficial since it tried to clarify
the  current  energy  /  sinks  additionality  language.  The  EU  proposal  suggested  an
additional  sentence  and  would  have  been  along  the  lines  “so  that  project  activities  that
would  have  occurred  in  the  absence  of  the  CDM  are  not  registered.”  This  proposed
clarification  to  paragraph  18  was  finally  dropped,  since  there  were  some  (probably
unfounded) concerns that a clarification of the language in the sinks text might backfire
on  the  interpretation  in  the  energy  rules.  Clearly,  any  interpretation  of  the  current
additionality  language  other  than  the  current  Executive  Board  interpretation  would  be
unacceptable. No projects should be registered that would have happened anyway. Since
the tropical industrial plantation area has been growing by 4 Mio hectares over the past
10  years,  it  is  of  utmost  importance  to  clearly  rule  out  any  such  business  as  usual
increases from the CDM.

18. An afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is additional if the actual net
greenhouse gas removals by sinks are increased above the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in
the  carbon  pools  within  the  project  boundary  that  would  have  occurred  in  the  absence  of  the
registered CDM afforestation or reforestation project activity. (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 9).

Furthermore, the baseline methodology requires taking into account some determinants,
such  as  existing  or  historical  changes  in  carbon  stocks.  This  language  definitely  could
have been more detailed.

22. In choosing a baseline methodology for an afforestation or reforestation project activity under
the CDM, project participants shall select from among the following approaches the one deemed
most appropriate for the project activity, taking into account any guidance by the Executive Board,
and justify the appropriateness of their choice:
(a) Existing or historical, as applicable, changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the
project boundary;
(b) Changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary from a land use that
represents an economically attractive course of action, taking into account barriers to investment;
(c) Changes in carbon stocks in the pools within the project boundary from the most likely land use
at the time the project starts.
(FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 9)

11.  1990 reference year:

Luckily, the 1990 reference year has been kept in the reforestation definitions. A shift to a
later reference year could have had disastrous consequences, e.g. creating the perception
for  landowners  that  deforestation  will  be  rewarded  at  some  point  in  the  future.  Thus,
perverse  incentives  for  deforestation  have  been  avoided.  The  main  concern  on  data
availability by Japan has been constructively countered by the European Union by a side
event on satellite data availability.

12.  Small-scale:

Climate  Action  Network  has  always  argued  that  there  shouldn’t  be  any  small-scale  (or
special  project)  simplified  modalities,  since  all  projects  within  the  CDM  should  benefit
local  people  and  biodiversity.  Creating  special  rules  for  more  environmentally  and
socially sound  small  projects  creates  the  perception  that  the  other  sinks  projects  can be
big monoculture plantations.

The  adopted  text  allows  for  simplified  modalities  to  be  developed  for  small-scale  sink
projects. Small-scale sink projects are defined as projects that result in a removal of less
than 8 kilotonnes CO2 per year. Furthermore, the development or implementation has to
be done by low-income  communities and individuals. As a consequence of limiting the
uptake  rate  (8ktCO2/year),  the  actual  size  of  eligible  projects  varies  according  to  the
project type. For fast growing species, the size will be limited. Assuming uptake rates of
20 to 40 tCO2/ha/year, the eligible size will be between 200 to 400 hectare or about 270
and  540  football  fields.  For  lower  uptake  rates,  e.g.  landscape  restoration  projects  in
semi-arid regions, the eligible size will be relatively bigger. Assuming an uptake rate of
10 to 5 tCO2/ha/year, the size will be 800 to 1600 hectare or 1100 to 2200 football fields.

1 (i) “Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM” are those
that are expected to result in net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks of less than
8 kilotonnes of CO2 per year and are developed or implemented by low-income communities and
individuals as determined by the host Party. (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27, page 5).

In  what  way  the  modalities  will  be  simplified  remains  to  be  determined.  Parties  and
UNFCCC accredited observers are asked for submissions on this issue until 24 February
2004.  Based  on  these  submissions  and  relevant  work  by  the  Executive  Board,  the
UNFCCC secretariat will produce a technical paper. SBSTA will then propose simplified
modalities for adoption in Buenos Aires at CoP-10. Possibilities for simplified modalities,
as they were discussed in the corridors of Milan, include i) ODA (Official Development
Aid) funding for registrations and verification costs and ii) simplified baselines.

There  is  one  important  thing  to  watch  out  for  during  the  coming  year,  when  the
modalities  are  designed:  It  must  be  guaranteed  that  large  plantations  cannot  be  split  up
and claim credits as several small-scale projects.

13.  Geophysical location

The current text requires reporting “a description of the physical location and boundaries
of  the  project  activity”  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27,  page  18,  Appendix  B,  2(a)).The
current text does not specify whether geo-referencing methods should be used to describe
the physical location. However, it is highly important that the geo-referenced boundaries
are  reported  as  well,  to  facilitate  on-the-ground  inspections  by  stakeholders.  This
clarification should be made by the Executive Board.

OUTLOOK FOR 2nd COMMITMENT PERIOD

The  decisions  taken  in  Marrakech  in  relation  to  the  accounting  for  sinks  of  all  kinds,
including  within  the  CDM,  relate  only  to  the  first  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto
Protocol  (2008-12).    The  fundamental  issue  that  has  motivated  Greenpeace’s  concerns
over the use of sink credits of any kind to offset against fossil fuel emission reductions
remains unresolved.  This issue can be expressed as a question with specific reference to
Article  2  of  the  UNFCCC  and  the  objective  of  the  prevention  of  dangerous  climate
change:  What are the geophysical possibilities, if any, for a trade off between the use of
sink  credits  and  industrial  greenhouse  gas  emissions  whilst  limiting  global  warming  to
2°C3 or less?

The IPCC Special Report on LULUCF failed to address this issue in any quantitative way
and  as  a  consequence  there  is  little  or  no  coherent  guidance  from  the  scientific
community on this issue.  There are those who advocate full inclusion of sinks, included
avoided deforestation on an full crediting basis (Schulze, Mollicone et al. 2003); these are
principally  scientists  involving  in  carbon  accounting  and  flux  measurements.    Others
disagree, arguing that carbon can be released quickly from the biosphere due to human or
climatic disturbances (Korner 2003).  Advocates of inclusion of sink credits in the Kyoto
systems  often  make  the  mistake  that  there  is  “no  difference  in  climatological  effect
between CO2 taken up by the land and CO2 reductions due to other causes” (Noble and
Scholes 2001).  It is clear that there are substantial differences when one views the issue,
as one must do, from a systems perspective where all aspects of atmospheric stabilization
and the carbon cycle are taken into account.

The recent German Global Change Advisory Council report on the future of the climate
regime,  for  example,  recognizes  the  significance  and  importance  of  the  problem  of
reducing  deforestation  emissions,  maintaining  existing  carbon  reservoirs  and  enhancing
the  uptake  of  carbon.  It  calls  for  a  full  accounting  of  terrestrial  carbon  fluxes  (Graßl,
Kokott  et  al.  2003).    It  finds,  however,  that  “at  the  present  time  the  Council  advises
against seeking to regulate the conservation of biological terrestrial carbon stocks within
the  same  system,  with  the  same  allocation  procedure  and  with  the  same  instruments  as
reduction commitments for fossil carbon stocks”.  Instead it calls for the biosphere to be
taken into account under a special agreement that does not involve carbon crediting.

The perspective that Greenpeace has brought to this issue to date is that to meet necessary
climate  protection  goals,  it  is  necessary  to  take  simultaneous  action  to  deeply  reduce
industrial  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  principally  CO2  from  fossil  fuel  burning,  and  to
reduce  deforestation  emissions.    As  a  direct  consequence  of  the  climate  objective  that
Greenpeace believes necessary (limiting the global mean temperature increase to below
2°C)  we  consider  that  there  is  virtually  no  room  for  a  tradeoff  with  sink  credits.    If  a
significantly higher climate target were acceptable or the climate sensitivity is very low,

3 The Climate Action Network is calling for climate policy globally to limit global mean warming below
2°C above pre-industrial levels – see http://www.climatenetwork.org/docs/CAN-DP_Framework.pdf.

then there would be room for trade off in this area.  Unfortunately these conditions do not
appear  to  apply.    The  risk  of  large  scale  releases  of  carbon  from  the  biosphere  arising
from climate change (Cramer, Bondeau et al. 2001; Jones, Cox et al. 2003), including the
risk of climate change induced collapse of the Amazon forests (Cowling, Cox et al. 2003;
Cox, Betts et al. 2003), adds to concerns in this area.

Debate  continues  over  these  questions.    A  new  proposal  for  accounting  for  tropical
deforestation under the Kyoto Protocol was put forward at CoP-9 (Santilli, Moutinho et
al. 2003).  This proposal has many positive features when compared to earlier proposals,
and is motivated by the urgent need to find a way to bring deforestation of the Amazon
(and elsewhere) under control.  The main problem remains as described above, however.

There urgently needs to be a full scientific assessment of these issues, so as to understand
the  full  range  of  answers  to  the  question  raised  above:  What  are  the  geophysical
possibilities, if any, for a trade off between tropical deforestation emission reductions and
industrial  greenhouse  gas  emissions  whilst  limiting  global  warming  to  2°C  or  less?
Progress seems likely only if this question can be answered so that all parties can fully
see  the  circumstances  and  consequence  of  tradeoffs  between  fossil  fuel  reductions  and
action  to  reduce,  for  example,  tropical  deforestation.    Greenpeace  is  willing  to  support
initiatives  that  assess  these  questions  and  provide  scientific  advice  to  policy  makers  on
the implications of the range of answers that would emerge from such an analysis.  Until
there is good scientific evidence to the contrary, we remain of the view that accounting
for LULUCF activities and fossil fuel related emissions must happen in separate systems.

In  conclusion  Greenpeace  remains  actively  engaged  in  discussions  regarding  future
commitment rules and modalities – as well as LULUCF activities. Of paramount concern
to us is that:

1)  All  policies  contribute  to  the  prevention  of  dangerous  climate  change  and

particular to limiting global warming to below a 2oC increase.

2)  Ensuring  that  any  LULUCF  activities  protect  biodiversity  and  enhance  other

environmental values.

Greenpeace welcomes any dialogue on this issue.

ANNEX I: Glossary & Abbreviations

Annex I of the Convention list those countries with quantified emission reduction or limitation obligations. Basically Annex I countries

are industrialized countries plus those countries with economies in transition

Appendix B is the Appendix in the agreed rules (document FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27) that outlines the necessary information for the

Project Design Document.

Base year emissions - The Emissions in the base year (mostly 1990) which are taken as the reference for future emission

reduction obligations.

Baseline - The baseline of a project determines the changes in emissions or removals that would have occurred in the absence of

the project activity

CDM - The Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol (Art. 12), which allows Annex I - Parties to achieve part of their

emission reduction obligations by investing in projects in developing countries (non-Annex I countries)

CERs - Certified Emission Reductions, which is the name for emissions credits / allowances, that stem from projects under the

Clean Development Mechanism.

CO2 - Carbon Dioxide, the main greenhouse gas emitted by human activities.
Commitment period - The Commitment Period is the 5-year interval in which the emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto

Protocol are binding. The first commitment period is from 2008 to 2012.

CoP-9 - Ninth Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC
EIT - Countries with Economies in Transition.

Executive Board - The Executive Board supervises the Clean Development Mechanism and decides on methodological and

operational questions regarding the implementation of the projects under the CDM.

FCA  - Full Carbon Accounting. That means, all sources and sinks are quantified / estimated and somehow subject to policy targets.

GMOs - Genetically Modified Organisms

lCERs - long-term CERs. These are credits from afforestation and reforestation CDM projects which have to be replaced once either

a) no verification report is given each 5 years, b) the net sequestration decreased again or c) the end of the crediting period is
reached.

Leakage - If the implementation of a project affects emissions or removals outside the project boundary, the project causes

"leakage".

LULUCF - Landuse, Land-Use Change and Forestry activities
MEAs - Multilateral Environmental Agreements, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention to Combat

Desertification (UNCCD), the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and others...

Non-permanence - As a sequestered carbon can be re-emitted in the future due to fire, pest attacks or increased land use needs,

the sequestration and subsequent storage is non-permanent. In contrast, emission reductions in the energy sector cause a
permanent decrease of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations compared to a  business-as-usual scenario.

ODA - Official Development Aid

Project Design Document - The project design document contains the basic information about a project under the Clean

Development Mechanism, that the project developer has to provide

Registration - The registration of a project is the formal acceptance by the Executive Board that the project is eligible as an CDM

project. The decision is made upon the "Validation" by an independent organization. (see para 11. in FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27,
page 7)

SBSTA - Subsidiary Body for Technical Advice that assists the Conference of the Parties.
Sinks - A sink is the opposite to a source. Since growing trees sequester carbon out of the atmosphere, they are often called sinks.
The term "sinks" is often used synonymously for LULUCF projects. Note, that biospheric sinks can turn into sources, when the
forest is cut, burned or dies at some point in the future.

tCERs - temporary CERs. tCERs are credits from afforestation and reforestation CDM projects that expire at the end of the

subsequent commitment period and have to be replaced at that point. Compare to lCERs, which is the alternative credit unit for
sink CDM projects.

UNFCCC  - United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Kyoto Protocol belongs to this Framework Convention.

Verification - Verification is the determination of the actual carbon uptake and GHG emissions of a project done by an independent

verifier.

Annex II: FOSSIL-AWARDS ON SINKS

Five  out  of  twenty-seven  fossil-of-the-day  awards  at  CoP-9  were  given  in  relation  to
Parties’  performance  in  the  CDM  sinks  negotiations  –  see  below.  The  Climate  Action
Network (CAN) nominates and elects fossil-of-the-day winners on each conference day.

CANADA
Canada,  again,  successfully  made  it  to  the  fossil  podium  earning  3rd  place  for  being  a
poor sport in the final sinks-CDM contact group. Canada seemed to have forgotten some
of the common courtesies most parties learned in the sandbox long before they arrived at
UNFCCC playground. While no party was happy with the final sinks-CDM text, Parties
gracefully  accepted  the  trade-offs,  and  commended  the  co-chairs  for  respectfully  and
fairly  balancing  the  interests  of  all  parties.  Rather  than  playing  respectfully  with  other
Parties, Canada chose to start throwing sand, some of it flying in the face of the co-chairs.
If this wasn’t enough, it gratuitously grandstanded with the only amendment which was
to  delete  “environmental”  from  the  reference  recognizing  “international  environmental
agreements”. Parties still aren’t certain whether Canada was motivated by an interest to
include WTO linkages or it was just more attention-seeking behaviour.

CANADA, NEW ZEALAND & CHINA
For  not  supporting
the  clear  exclusion  of  genetically  modified  organisms…
Canada  and  New  Zealand  were  recipients  of  a  fossil  on  this  issue  last  week  so  it’s  a
double hit for these countries. They are rapidly genetically engineering a bad reputation
for  themselves.  GMOs  have  been  altered  at  a  fundamental  genetic  level  in  ways  that
could never occur naturally. There have been no long term studies on their impacts and
risk  the  creation  of  many  ecological  impacts.  China  joins  the  GMO  hall  of  infamy  this
week  for  also  not  opposing  the  specific  exclusion  of  GMOs,  paving  the  way  for
genetically  modified  trees  in  sinks  projects  all  around  the  world.  So  thanks  for  nothing
Canada, New Zealand and China!

5th Dec. 2003
NORWAY & NEW ZEALAND
Both awards are about the GMO issue. Norway was found to deserve some friendly fire
for  temporarily  chickening  out  on  the  clear  GMO  and  invasive  alien  species  language.
Norway  dropped  their  strong  proposal  on  GMOs  and  invasive  alien  species  like  a  hot
potato seemingly before anyone even had a chance to oppose it!

Page 17 of 18

Sinks in the CDM: Post-CoP9 analysis – 19th December 2003

And  in  an  oversight  from  our  ceremony  on  Wednesday,  we  are  also  disappointed  to
present New Zealand with a Fossil of the Day. We had hoped that New Zealand would do
the right thing and support the exclusion of GMOs and invasive alien species. But no, it
seems that New Zealand has decided to follow Canada and Japan down the garden path to
allow genetically modified and alien invasive sinks projects.

5th Dec. 2003
COLOMBIA
For  their  intervention  yesterday  vigorously  arguing  for  the  flawed  concept  of  positive
leakage. Under positive leakage, a project developer can claim credits for carbon uptake
outside their project boundary. So it seems that Columbia wants to have their cake and
eat  their  neighbours  too!  Despite  the  fact  that  there  would  be  no  verification,  ongoing
monitoring or liability for any re-emissions. Come on Columbia, don’t be so greedy!

3rd Dec. 2003
CANADA, JAPAN, ARGENTINA, FRANCE & IRELAND
For not supporting the clear exclusion of genetically modified organisms. If genetically
modified organisms are planted in the name of the Kyoto Protocol, the Protocol turns into
a  subsidy  system  for  the  environmental  experiment  that  is  Genetic  Engineering.
Genetically modified organisms have been altered at a fundamental genetic level in ways
that  could  never  occur  in  nature.  Their  release  into  the  environment  poses  enormous,
unknown  and  unquantifiable  risks.  No  long  term  studies  have  been  conducted  into  the
effects  of  the  release  of  GMOs  into  the  environment  so  we  don’t  know  what  we  are
messing  with!  But  the  risks  include  –  cross  pollination  with  non  GMO  organisms,  the
creation  of  unknown  toxins  and  allergens  which  can  affect  fauna  grazing  on  the  GMO
and  other  unknown  impacts  on  pollinators,  the  possible  transmission  of  altered  genetic
material through soil bacteria and other ecological effects. Clearly a protocol designed to
protect  the  environment  has  no  place  in  supporting  the  release  of  GMOs  into  the
environment as sinks projects or through any other means. GMOs must be excluded from
sinks projects.
