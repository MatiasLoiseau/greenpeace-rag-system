cause wilderness proposals to be con-troversial and make wilderness legisla-tion difficult to pass.Federal land management agenciesusually fail to adequately considerroadless areas for their potential forwilderness protection. Instead, designa-tion of new wilderness has almostalways been driven by the efforts ofconcerned citizens. This tradition con-tinues today, with citizen-inspiredwilderness legislation pending orplanned for a number of states and ter-ritories, including Alaska, California,Colorado, the northern RockyMountains, Puerto Rico, Utah, Vermontand Washington.NATIONAL PARK SYSTEMBackgroundMost national park areas are createdby an act of Congress. First, a “specialresource study” conducted by theNational Park Service is usuallyrequired. After the study is completed,Congress must pass a bill that authoriz-es the establishment of a new NationalPark System unit. Each unit has its ownunique authorizing legislation. TheNational Park System is made up of awide range of natural, historic andarchaeological units. Each has a differ-ent purpose and thus permits differentactivities within its boundaries. Thisallows national parks to be tailored increative ways to address site-specificproblems and opportunities.There are more than 30 differentNational Park System classifications allunder the jurisdiction of the NationalThe purpose of this User’s Guide is toinform activists and citizens about thevarious forms of federal land manage-mentthat can provide increased pro-tection. For each land classification,one will find general backgroundinformation, an explanation of howsuch areas are established, and issuesto consider when deciding on the bestprotection approach for a particulararea. The following are the major pub-lic land categories, listed from mostprotected to least protected: NATIONAL WILDERNESSPRESERVATION SYSTEMBackgroundThe National Wilderness PreservationSystem is not an independent federalland system. Congress may designatewilderness areas only on existing feder-al lands that meet the wilderness crite-ria set out in the act. This includes landmanaged by the National Park Service,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S.Forest Service and Bureau of LandManagement. Wilderness areas are protected fromthe construction of roads, dams orother permanent structures. Timbercutting, new mining claims and mineralleasing, oil and gas development andmotorized vehicles and equipment areprohibited. Special provisions in thelaw allow firefighting, insect and dis-ease control and emergency actions toinsure the health and safety of people.The law allows certain non-conformingpre-existing uses, such as livestockgrazing, to continue.The designation of wilderness areasrequires an act of Congress. The criteriafor new wilderness areas are set in theWilderness Act. Wilderness is definedin the act as an area of undevelopedfederal land that meets the followingcriteria:  Ggenerally appears to have beenaffected primarily by the forces ofnature, with the imprint of man’s worksubstantially unnoticeable; Ghas outstanding opportunities forsolitude or a primitive and unconfinedtype of recreation; Ghas at least 5,000 acres or is of suf-ficient size as to make practical itspreservation and use in an unimpairedcondition; and Gmay also contain ecological, geo-logical, or other features of scientific,educational, scenic or historical value.Issues to ConsiderBy the mid-1980s, the creation of newwilderness areas had become the majoroffensive strategy of land preservationactivists. Wilderness designationensures strong and lasting protection.Unfortunately, many important areasare ineligible for designation under theWilderness Act. Most of the nation’sfederal public lands do not qualifybecause of the presence of roads orother factors. Land that is state-ownedor privately owned cannot be designat-ed under the Wilderness Act. Another major problem is a lack ofpublic awareness about federal wilder-ness designation. For example, whatdesignations allow hunting and whichprohibit it? Lack of knowledge can

Park Service. The following are themost useful designations for land pro-tection activists, listed from the mostprotected to least protected category:National Park WildernessDesignated wilderness areas in nationalparks have the strongest protection ofany federal public lands. They prohibitnot only the activities banned underthe Wilderness Act, but also livestockgrazing, which is permitted in mostother federal wilderness areas. Thereare currently 54 National Park Systemwilderness areas totaling almost 44 mil-lion acres. New National Park Systemwilderness requires an act of Congress. National PreservesA national preserve is a unit of theNational Park System that is identical inmanagement policy and intent to thatof a national park, except thatCongress has authorized a particularactivity or type of use in each that doesnot occur in a national park. For exam-ple, national preserves in Alaska allowsport hunting and trapping.National MonumentsNational monuments are intended topreserve at least one nationally signifi-cant resource. They are usually createdunder the Antiquities Act of 1906,which authorizes the president todeclare by public proclamation land-marks, structures and other objects ofhistoric or scientific interest situated onlands owned or controlled by the gov-ernment to be national monuments. National Rivers, Seashores andLakeshoresNational rivers preserve ribbons of landbordering on free-flowing streams,which have not been dammed, chan-neled or otherwise altered. These areasallow recreational activities such as hik-ing, canoeing and hunting. Nationalrivers include several variations, such asnational river and recreation area, Wildand Scenic River and scenic river way.National seashores and lakeshoresare very similar in purpose and man-agement to national rivers. Hunting isNATIONAL WILD AND SCENICRIVERS SYSTEMBackgroundThe Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968establishes the Wild and Scenic RiversSystem that includes “wild,”“scenic”and “recreational” rivers. Wild riversmust be “essentially primitive andwaters unpolluted.” Scenic rivers are“largely primitive and shorelines large-ly undeveloped.” Recreational rivers“are readily accessible by road or rail-road” and “may have some develop-ment along their shorelines, and...mayhave undergone some impoundmentor diversion in the past.”Wild and Scenic Rivers include ahalf-mile corridor on both sides of theriver and prohibit the construction ofnew dams or other diversions. Wildand Scenic Rivers can be designated onfederal, state, or private lands and pro-vide for the acquisition of private landswithin the river corridor.There are currently 175 designatedunits of the National Wild and ScenicRivers System encompassing 11,329miles of river. They are managed pri-marily by various federal agencies,including the National Park Service, theForest Service, the Bureau of LandManagement and the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service. Several rivers are man-aged by state agencies.National Wild and Scenic RiverProtection OptionsThe Wild and Scenic Rivers Act desig-nated 156 rivers for immediate inclu-sion in the National Wild and ScenicRivers System. It also provided for thestudy of additional rivers for potentialinclusion in the system, and includedan initial list of 136 study rivers. After astudy has been completed, rivers canbe authorized for inclusion in theNational Wild and Scenic Rivers Systemby an act of Congress or by individualstate legislation submitted for theInterior secretary’s approval.In 1982, the National Park Servicecompleted the extensive NationalRivers Inventory (updated in 1993),that listed river segments that are free-allowed in most national seashores andlakeshores unless otherwise specified inthe authorizing legislation.National Recreation AreasOriginally, national recreation areas(NRAs) were units surrounding reser-voirs impounded by other federalagencies. The concept of recreationareas has grown to include other landsand waters protected by Congress forrecreational use, including major areasin urban centers. The focus is primarilyon providing public recreation whilepreserving natural values. Nationalrecreation areas are generally the mostdeveloped and intensively used of thenatural area National Park Systemunits. However, with few exceptionsthey still provide protection from log-ging, livestock grazing, mining, oil andgas drilling and other extractive activi-ties.Issues to ConsiderAlong with federal wilderness areas,national parks have proven over timeto provide the strongest and most per-manent protection for large wild land-scapes. The average new national parktakes many years to go from vision toreality. However, once a national parkis created, the land's preservation is abattle that will not have to be foughtagain. It is no coincidence that themost ecologically intact landscapes inthe United States are centered onnational parks or wilderness areas.A number of campaigns are under-way to create new National ParkSystem units to protect significant for-est lands. The most prominent of thesepark proposals are Blackwater CanyonNational Park (West Virginia), HellsCanyon-Chief Joseph National Preserve(Idaho, Oregon and Washington),Maine Woods National Park andPreserve (Maine) and Mount HoodNational Park (Oregon).

the United States today. This is animportant and unfinished part of theAmerican land conservation agenda.NATIONAL FORESTSBackgroundThe National Forest System encompass-es 191 million acres of national forestsand national grasslands. These landsare managed for a wide range of“multiple uses,” including resourceextraction (such as logging, livestockgrazing, mining, and oil and gasdrilling), recreation (such as hiking,camping, skiing, hunting, fishing, off-roading and snowmobiling), watershedprotection and animal and plant habitat.National Forest Protection OptionsCitizen activists from around the coun-try have been working to change theForest Service mandate to focus onconservation rather than resourcedevelopment and intensive recreation.This approach offers great promise, butit is a long-term effort. There are otheroptions that may offer a better chanceof providing permanent protection inthe near-term. The section below ranksthese options from the most protectedto the least protected:National Forest WildernessOne option that offers permanent pro-tection is to designate importantnational forest lands as wilderness.There are currently 406 national forestwilderness areas totaling almost 35 mil-lion acres. As with all wilderness desig-nations, creating new national forestwilderness requires an act of Congress.Unfortunately, most national forestlands do not meet Wilderness Act crite-ria for designation. Moreover, nationalforest wilderness areas often permitcommercial livestock grazing, a usethat degrades wilderness values. National Wild and Scenic RiversDesignation under the Wild and ScenicRivers Act offers another layer of pro-tection for rivers in national forests.Wild rivers can preserve primitive riverflowing and have one or more “out-standingly remarkable values.” Most ofthe rivers studied under the Wild andScenic Rivers Act and the NationalRivers Inventory have not yet been des-ignated as Wild and Scenic Rivers.Issues to ConsiderThe prohibition of new dams andwater diversions alone makes it worthadding rivers to the Wild and ScenicRivers System. Depending on the riverclassification and land managementagency, designation under the Wildand Scenic Rivers Act can significantlystrengthen river corridor protection.Although a Wild and Scenic River des-ignation does not ensure the protec-tion of private lands, it provides amechanism for public acquisition,which can make future protection possible.NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGESYSTEMBackgroundThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceadministers the 93 million-acreNational Wildlife Refuge System(NWRS). The mission of the NationalWildlife Refuge System is to “adminis-ter a national network of lands andwater for the conservation, manage-ment and where appropriate, restora-tion of the fish, wildlife and plantresources and their habitats within theUnited States for the benefit of presentand future generations of Americans.”The NWRS includes 535 NationalWildlife Refuges and other areas, total-ing 91 million acres of land and water.The 1997 National Wildlife RefugeSystem Improvement Act requiresdevelopment of management plans foreach refuge in the system, sets stan-dards for refuge protection and estab-lishes that the first purpose of refugemanagement is to protect biodiversity.In terms of on-the-ground manage-ment, many national wildlife refugeshave fairly strong protection. They donot allow commercial logging, miningand most other industrial activities.They usually have minimal recreationaldevelopment and low public use. Manyendangered wildlife species haverecovered due, in large part, to nation-al wildlife refuges. However, nationalwildlife refuges do not necessarilyensure the same level of protection aswilderness or National Park Systemunits (see below).   National Wildlife Refuge ProtectionOptionsMany national wildlife refuges contin-ue to permit uses that are clearly dam-aging to native biodiversity. Somerefuges face massive threats, such asthe proposed drilling for oil and gas inthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,and several already have active oil andgas wells. Intensive wildlife manipula-tion is often practiced and commerciallivestock grazing is allowed in most ofthe western refuges. Sport hunting,which is allowed in more than half ofthe national wildlife refuges, is consid-ered by many conservationists to beinconsistent with the purpose of therefuge system.New national wildlife refuges can becreated through specific legislation bythe U.S. Congress to authorize theestablishment of a refuge or an expan-sion. Moreover, there are a number ofoptions for providing key nationalwildlife refuge lands with a higherlevel of protection. These optionsinclude the designation of qualifiedlands under the National WildernessPreservation System, the transfer ofcertain areas to the National ParkSystem or the designation of areas asadditions to the National Wild andScenic River System.Issues to ConsiderFew major new units have been addedto the National Wildlife Refuge Systemin recent years. Meanwhile, conserva-tionists have been so overwhelmed bythe protection of national forests andBureau of Land Management landsthat they have paid relatively littleattention to providing better protec-tion for our existing national wildliferefuges. In fact, there is no activenational wildlife refuge movement in

corridors with little, if any, extractionand development. Unfortunately, theForest Service often permits damagingactivities, such as logging, livestockgrazing and off-road vehicle use withinthe scenic and recreational river corri-dors. Still, Wild and Scenic Rivers pre-vent new dams and water diversionsand offer the potential for better pro-tection than conventional national for-est lands.National Scenic AreasNational scenic areas are not as pro-tected as wilderness areas or NationalPark System units. However, theyreceive significantly stronger protec-tion than standard national forestmanagement. National scenic areas aredesignated through congressional leg-islation, which provides direction onthe level of protection. Most nationalforest scenic areas allow some level oflogging, livestock grazing and otherindustrial activities to continue.National MonumentsThere are only a handful of nationalmonuments on national forest lands.They can be created under theAntiquities Act of 1906 or through con-gressional legislation. National forestmonuments are not as well protectedas those administered by the NationalPark Service. Most of them allow somelevel of logging, livestock grazing andother industrial activities to continue.National Recreation AreasNational recreation areas (NRAs) are animprovement over general nationalforest management, but they are muchless protected than National ParkSystem NRAs. For example, most allowlogging, livestock grazing, road-build-ing and intensive motorized recreation.The creation of a national recreationarea requires an act of Congress. Issues to ConsiderSpecial management areas such as Wildand Scenic Rivers, national scenic areas,national monuments and nationalrecreation areas offer an increasedlevel of protection from standardNational Conservation AreasThe Bureau of Land Managementadministers 13 national conservationareas encompassing 14 million acres.National conservation areas are createdthrough an act of Congress, but theiractual level of protection depends inlarge part on the BLM managementplan for each area and how well theagency implements the plan. Manynational conservation areas continue tobe threatened by road-building, oil andgas drilling, mining, intensive motor-ized recreation and off-road vehicleuse.National MonumentsThere are 15 national monumentstotaling 4.7 million acres administeredby the Bureau of Land Management.Unfortunately, these monuments gen-erally allow commercial resourceextraction and other industrial uses.Unlike national monuments underNational Park Service administration,BLM monuments do not have specificcongressional legislation to direct theirprotection.Issues to ConsiderIn 2000, the National LandscapeConservation System was created tohelp ensure protection of these BLMspecial management areas. To date, thisvision has not been realized. TheBureau of Land Management remainsas firmly committed to industrial devel-opment as the Forest Service. For theforeseeable future, the only BLM landsthat can be considered fully protectedare those designated under theWilderness Act or transferred to theNational Park System. However, the cre-ation of new Wild and Scenic Rivers,national conservation areas and nation-al monuments is still an important toolthat provides stronger protection thanstandard BLM administration.national forest management. However,they still allow a number of damagingland uses. If the goal is preservation oflands free from resource extraction andintensive recreational uses, the bestoptions are designation of wildernessareas or the transfer of key areas tothe National Park System.BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT LANDSBackgroundThe Bureau of Land Managementadministers 267 million acres, including55 million acres of forest land. Thiscomprises approximately one-eighth ofthe United States’ land base. Theagency also administers 300 millionadditional acres of subsurface mineralresources.Bureau of Land ManagementProtection OptionsConservationists have used a numberof strategies to preserve key tracts ofBureau of Land Management land inrecent years. The section below discuss-es these options, ranked from the mostto the least protective:Bureau of Land ManagementWildernessOne option that offers permanent pro-tection is to designate important BLMlands as wilderness. The BLM currentlymanages 161 wilderness areas encom-passing 6.5 million acres.Unfortunately, most BLM lands do notmeet Wilderness Act criteria for desig-nation.National Wild and Scenic RiversDesignation under the Wild and ScenicRivers Act offers another layer of pro-tection for rivers on Bureau of LandManagement lands. Thirty-eight riversor river sections are currently managedby the BLM as part of the NationalWild and Scenic Rivers System. The BLMoften permits damaging activities, suchas livestock grazing, within the scenicand recreational river “corridors” butthis designation does prevent newdams and water diversions.43America’s Keystone Forests
