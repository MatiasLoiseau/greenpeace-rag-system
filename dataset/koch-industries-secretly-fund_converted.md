Executive Summary

Most Americans have never heard of Koch Industries, one of
the largest private corporations in the country, because it has
no Koch-branded consumer products, sells no shares on the
stock market and has few of the disclosure requirements of
a public company. Although Koch intentionally stays out of
the public eye, it is now playing a quiet but dominant role in a
high-profile national policy debate on global warming. Koch
Industries has become a financial kingpin of climate science
denial and clean energy opposition. This private, out-of-sight
corporation is now a partner to ExxonMobil, the American
Petroleum Institute and other donors that support organiza-
tions and front-groups opposing progressive clean energy
and climate policy. In fact, Koch has out-spent ExxonMobil
in funding these groups in recent years. From 2005 to 2008,
ExxonMobil spent $8.9 million while the Koch Industries-
controlled foundations contributed $24.9 million in funding to
organizations of the ‘climate denial machine’.

The company’s tight knit network of lobbyists, former
executives and organizations has created a forceful stream
of misinformation that Koch-funded entities produce and
disseminate. This campaign propaganda is then replicated,
repackaged and echoed many times throughout the
Koch-funded web of political front groups and think tanks.
On repeated occasions documented below, organizations
funded by Koch foundations have led the assault on climate
science and scientists, “green jobs,” renewable energy and
climate policy progress.

This report focuses on activities by Koch Industries and its
affiliates, as well as the family—and company—controlled
foundations which fund organizations that spread inaccurate
and misleading information about climate science and clean
energy policies. Included is research on the company and
the Koch brothers, two of the top ten richest people in the
United States. The Koch brothers own the corporation
and control its political spending. Also included are newly
compiled funding connections from Koch foundations to a
vast array of conservative and libertarian organizations and
front groups. The report documents the Koch-funded funded
groups’ actions and the Koch legacy of climate denial and
obstruction of environmental policy. Case studies contained
in this report include:

• ClimateGate Echo Chamber—At least twenty Koch-funded
organizations have repeatedly rebroadcast, referenced and
appeared as media spokespeople in the story, dubbed “Cli-
mateGate,” of supposed malfeasance by climate scientists
gleaned from a cache of stolen emails from the University of
East Anglia in November 2009. These organizations claim
the emails prove a “conspiracy” of scientists and casts doubt
on the scientific consensus regarding climate change.

• Polar Bear Junk Science—In a 2007 published ‘junk
science’ article on polar bears and Arctic climate impacts,
the author acknowledged receiving research funding from
ExxonMobil, American Petroleum Institute and the Charles G.
Koch foundation. The paper, which appeared in the journal
Ecological Complexity, was published as a “Viewpoint”
piece, rather than new scientific research. It was not peer-

reviewed and was criticized by leading polar bear and Arctic
ice scientists for containing “no new research” and drawing
unfounded conclusions. Regardless, multiple Koch and
Exxon-funded groups rebroadcast the article’s conclusions
that polar bears were not endangered by climate change,
through their websites and other media outlets. Additional
Koch-funded groups and industry groups threatened to sue
the Federal government for listing the polar bear.

For years, both openly and behind the scenes, ExxonMobil
dominated the voice of climate science denial in the
national global warming dialogue. However, after a decade of
reputation-damaging public disclosures, as well as pressure
from scientific organizations, shareholders and senators,
ExxonMobil implemented a new public relations strategy
under a new CEO, and has begun to moderate its public
statements on climate change. ExxonMobil’s website de-
clares:1 “We have discontinued contributions to several public
policy research groups whose position on climate change
diverted attention from the important discussion on how the
world will secure the energy required for economic growth in
an environmentally responsible manner.”

In spite of publishing this statement and reducing funding to
a number of prominent climate denial organizations over the
past few years, ExxonMobil continues to support dozens of
organizations who are part of the climate denial movement
with millions of dollars in annual funding.2 ExxonMobil has
responded to public scrutiny by slightly reducing their
support of climate denial, and Koch Industries is outpacing
ExxonMobil’s funding activities while drawing very little public
attention. As ExxonMobil’s silent partner in funding the
climate-denial machine, Koch Industries often uses similar
and sometimes more aggressive tactics.

Kansas-based Koch Industries is a conglomerate dominated
by petroleum and chemical interests with approximately $100
billion in annual sales, operations in nearly 60 countries and
70,000 employees. Most of Koch’s operations are invisible
to the public, with the exception of a handful of retail brands
such as Brawny® paper towels and Dixie® cups, produced
by its subsidiary Georgia-Pacific Corporation. Koch
Industries has been ranked as the first- or second-largest
privately-held company in the United States in recent years,
currently ranked second behind Cargill corporation.

Two brothers, Charles and David Koch, each own 42 percent
of the company. Part of Koch Industries’ influence is chan-
neled through three foundations, also controlled by the two
brothers. This report documents roughly 40 climate denial
and opposition organizations receiving Koch foundation
grants in recent years, including:

• More than $5 million to Americans for Prosperity Founda-
tion (AFP) for its nationwide “Hot Air Tour”3 campaign to
spreading misinformation about climate science and oppos-
ing clean energy and climate legislation.

• More than $1 million to the Heritage Foundation, a mainstay
of misinformation on climate and environmental policy issues.

• Over $1 million to the Cato Institute, which disputes the
scientific evidence behind global warming, questions the
rationale for taking climate action, and has been heavily
involved in spinning the recent ClimateGate story.

• $800,000 to the Manhattan Institute, which has hosted
Bjorn Lomborg twice in the last two years. Lomborg is a
prominent media spokesperson who challenges and attacks
policy measures to address climate change.

Executive Summary

SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THE 2006 ELECTION
CYCLE, KOCH’S PAC
SPENT MORE ON
CONTRIBUTIONS TO
FEDERAL CANDIDATES
THAN ANY OTHER OIL-
 AND-GAS SECTOR PAC.

• $365,000 to Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment
(FREE) which advocates against taking action on climate change because
warming is “inevitable” and expensive to address.

• $360,000 to Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy (PRIPP) which
supported and funded An Inconvenient Truth…or Convenient Fiction,4 a film
attacking the science of global warming and intended as a rebuttal to former
Vice-President Al Gore’s documentary. PRIPP also threatened to sue the US
Government for listing the polar bear as an endangered species.

• $325,000 to the Tax Foundation, which issued a misleading study on the
costs of proposed climate legislation.

This is only part of the picture, because the full scope of direct contributions to
organizations is not disclosed by individual Koch family members, executives,
or from the company itself.

Contributions through Koch’s political action committee (PAC) are a matter
of public record. Since the beginning of the 2006 election cycle, Koch’s PAC
spent more on contributions to federal candidates5 than any other oil-and-gas
sector PAC. For that period, Koch Industries and
its executives spent $2.51 million compared to next
three biggest contributors: Exxon ($1.71 million),
Valero ($1.68 million), and Chevron ($1.22 million).

Koch executives and their families wield political
influence in other ways too, including direct federal
lobbying and campaign contributions. Over the last
few years, Koch Industries, Koch employees, and
Koch family members:

• Spent $37.9 million from 2006 to 2009 for direct
lobbying on oil and energy issues, outspent only by
ExxonMobil ($87.8 million) and Chevron Corporation
($50 million).

• Spent $5.74 million in PAC money for candidates,
committees, and campaign expenditures since the
2006 election cycle.

• Contributed at least $270,800 to federal political
party committees since the 2006 election cycle.

The combination of foundation-funded front-groups,
big lobbying budgets, PAC donations, and direct
campaign contributions makes Koch Industries
and the Koch brothers among the most formidable
obstacles to advancing clean energy and climate
policy in the US.

Case Studies:

How does Koch Industries Influence the Climate Policy Debate?

Case Study 1: The Koch-funded “ClimateGate” Echo Chamber

In November 2009, anonymous hackers illegally obtained and disseminated thousands of personal
emails from climate scientists housed on the server of the University of East Anglia. The emails
spanned 13 years of correspondence and a handful of selected emails were taken out of context
by a number of climate-denier organizations. These organizations, many funded by Koch, claim the
emails prove a “conspiracy” of scientists and cast doubt on the scientific consensus on human-
caused climate change.

This incident, dubbed “ClimateGate” by climate-denier groups, has been distorted and repeated
many times by conservative media and blogs since late November 2009. Twenty organizations,
roughly half of the Koch-funded groups profiled in this report, have contributed to the “ClimateGate”
echo chamber. Among the most vocal groups are organizations that received over $1,000,000 from
Koch foundations since 2005, including Americans for Prosperity, the Heritage Foundation, and the
Cato Institute.

1) Americans For Prosperity (received over $5 million from Koch since 2005) hosted a live we-
bcast from Copenhagen6 on Dec 9th as part of their “Hot Air Tour,” using the “ClimateGate”
emails as a reason to prevent passage of any progressive global warming policy. During
the webcast, Steve Lonegan, AFP’s New Jersey Director, said “ClimateGate” could have
uncovered “the biggest hoax our world has ever seen” and vowed not to allow any climate
bill to pass the US Senate. Several members of the Copenhagen youth delegation crashed
the AFP event and were angrily called “Hitler Youth” by AFP guest speaker and well known
climate denier Lord Christopher Monckton. In addition to the Copenhagen webcast, AFP
mentions “ClimateGate” in many7 blog8 posts, including in their protest of the Environmental
Protection Agency CO2 regulations, known as the endangerment finding.9

2) The Heritage Foundation (received over $1 million from Koch since 2005) has posted
several articles on its website regarding “ClimateGate.” The blogs run the gamut of possible
climate-denier angles on the incident, ranging from conspiracy accusations10, to a history of
imagined climate scandals11, to effects on world politics12, to supposed negative economic
consequences from climate legislation.13

3) The Cato Institute (received over $1 million in grants from Koch since 2005) is the front-
group for climate-denier Patrick Michaels14, who has been a vocal spokesperson regarding
“ClimateGate”. Within two weeks following the email breach at East Anglia University,
Patrick Michaels had appeared in over twenty media interviews15 on shows including CNN’s
Anderson Cooper 360, NBC’s Nightly News, FOX’s Fox & Friends, C-SPAN’s Washington
Journal, and BBC’s Have Your Say. Michaels, taking one line of an illegally-obtained email out
of context, has claimed the scientists have committed a “capital crime”16 and their actions are
“akin to filtering what goes in the bible.”17

Case Study 2: Polar Bear Junk Science

In 2007, several prominent climate denial scientists published
a non-peer reviewed article,35 (Dyck, Soon et al, 2007 “Polar
bears of western Hudson Bay and climate change: Are
warming spring air temperatures the ‘‘ultimate’’ survival
control factor?”) concluding that polar bears are not being
threatened by anthropogenic global warming. One of the
paper’s authors, Dr. Willie Soon, disclosed in the acknowl-
edgements section that he had received direct corporate
funding for the work, stating “W. Soon’s effort for the
completion of this paper was partially supported by grants
from the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, American
Petroleum Institute, and Exxon-Mobil Corporation.” (Exxon
grants to Soon’s organization are detailed below. The exact
amount received from the Koch foundation was not found
on its 990 forms. The American Petroleum Institute does
not disclose the multiple grants it has made to such climate
denial organizations over the years.)

The paper, which did not include any new scientific research,
but drew from other published work, appeared in the journal
Ecological Complexity as a “Viewpoint” piece. This article
declared Arctic sea ice decline was less severe than recent
well founded conclusions in peer-reviewed literature.36 The
authors question the climate science of Arctic warming and
the scientific modeling that indicates climate change as a
threat to polar bear populations. Leading polar bear and
Arctic ice scientists criticized the article for containing “no
new research” and drawing erroneous conclusions from
existing research. Two polar bear experts, Dr. Ian Stirling37
and Dr. Andrew Derocher38, published a response to the
paper, stating that the 2007 article did not adequately
support the claim that non-climate factors were causing the
polar bear population decline. Stirling and Deroucher wrote,

page 10

“[The article’s authors] suggest that factors other than climate
warming are responsible for a decline in the polar bear
population of Western Hudson Bay… In our examination
of their alternative explanations, and the data available to
evaluate each, we found little support for any.”39

Oil interests and their allies likely realize that polar bear
protections might hinder oil exploration in the Arctic. In
addition, because polar bear decline is an iconic symbol of
the climate crisis, undermining the scientific proof of polar
bears in peril would potentially delay overall climate policy
measures that will reduce oil consumption.

The co-authors of the paper include long time climate
deniers: Sallie Baliunas,40 David Legates41 and Tim Ball42.
Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas have a documented history
of receiving money from oil interests. ExxonMobil Foundation
tax records and company documents confirm a series
of grants to the Center for Astrophysics, which employs
both Soon and Baliunas. In 2008, ExxonMobil contributed
$76,10643 to Soon and Baliunas’ institute, the Smithsonian
Astrophysics Observatory, with funding totalling over
$340,000 in four grants since 2005.

Soon and Baliunas were the authors of another controversial
climate “junk science” report in 2003, funded by the
American Petroleum Institute. The paper, “Lessons & Limits
of Climate History: Was the 20th Century Climate Unusual?”,
published by another industry-funded think tank, the George
Marshall Institute,44 attacked the research of climate scientist
Michael Mann, who has also been a prominent target in the
“Climategate” controversy detailed above. Soon, Baliunas and
Legates teamed up on a version of the same paper, pub-
lished in a small journal Climate Research, which generated

Case Studies:
How does Koch Industries Influence the Climate Policy Debate?

such an uproar that the Editor in Chief and several others
resigned in protest.45 46 Both Soon and Baliunas have been
associated as spokespeople, advisors and board members
of multiple Koch-funded climate denial groups over the past
decade.

The 2007 polar bear junk science paper prompted a letter to
ExxonMobil from North Carolina Representative Brad Miller,47
Chair of the US House Subcommittee on Investigations
and Oversight, which raised a key question about Exxon’s
funding, which could well have been asked of Koch and API:

“To people outside the scientific community, one PhD may
seem like another. Certainly Exxon knows better, however.
Yet according to Dr Soon, an astrophysicist by profession,
ExxonMobil funded the development of his “opinions” on
global warming and its potential impact on polar bear
populations…The Congress and the Public have a right to
know why ExxonMobil is funding a scientist whose writing
is outside his area of expertise to create the impression that
expert scientists have conducted vigorous, peer reviewed
work that says the problems with polar bears [and climate
change] are unproven or unserious.”48

Exxon responded,49 denying responsibility for Soon’s re-
search and claiming that the paper had undergone a “lengthy
peer review process.”

The Koch-funded climate denial groups kicked into gear
before the paper was published. Regardless of the non-peer
reviewed status of the Ecological Complexity paper, it gave
the appearance of a peer reviewed paper. Multiple Koch and
Exxon-funded groups rebroadcast the story through their
websites and other media outlets, emphasizing the paper
and its ‘findings’ that polar bears are not endangered by
climate change. When the Bush Administration was forced
to consider listing the polar bear under the Endangered
Species Act (by a lawsuit brought by Greenpeace and other
environmental groups), Sarah Palin and her officers in the
Alaskan government referenced the 2007 Dyck, Soon et al.
polar bear paper in its formal protest of government action
to protect the polar bear, even before the paper was even
published.50

Additional Koch-funded groups and industry groups threat-
ened to sue the Federal government for listing the polar bear
under the Endangered Species Act, including the American
Enterprise Institute51, the Heritage Foundation52, and National
Association of Manufacturers.53

How does Koch Industries Influence the Climate Policy Debate?

Case Study 3: The “Spanish Study” on Green Jobs

Since the creation of new clean energy jobs is a critical
benefit of climate and energy policy, opponents have
focused on discrediting ‘green’ jobs. A report appeared on
this subject in spring of 2009 called the “Study of the effects
on employment of public aid to renewable energy sources”54
by Gabriel Calzada Alvarez, an economics professor at King
Juan Carlos University in Madrid. According to Dr. Alvarez’s
study, Spain’s policy commitments to renewable energy
development had actually cost Spain jobs—2.2 jobs lost for
each clean energy job created.

The study became a favorite talking point for opponents of
clean energy, who seized on the study when it was released
in March—coinciding with the House Energy and Commerce
Committee discussions on the American Clean Energy
and Security Act. The study was trumpeted by opposition
groups, covered by reporters, and repeated in congressional
testimony by US Representatives opposed to clean energy
policy and climate mitigation measures.

Despite the fact that the conclusions and methodology
of the study by Alvarez have been repeatedly proven
unsupportable55 (most recently by the US’s own National
Renewable Energy Laboratory56, in addition to ministers with
the Spanish government57 and independent experts58 ), the
‘study’ continues to be trumpeted. The study recently made
its way into fact sheets circulated by clean energy opposition
group Americans for Prosperity,59 which is founded and
chaired by David Koch.

Where did the “Spanish study” come from, and who
promoted it? Several organizations and individuals—each
supported through the Koch web—have played key roles in
supporting, disseminating and promoting the research.

• March 2009: The Institute for Energy Research (IER)
supported60 and disseminated61 the “Spanish study,” released
in March of 2009.

• April 2009: Patrick Michaels was an early commenter on
the study62, saying in April 2009 that he wasn’t surprised by
the findings and that the U.S. should expect similar results
from stimulus funding on renewable energy.

• May 2009: The Heritage Foundation promoted the report
in a variety of ways63, including a May 2009 Washington, DC
briefing.

page 12

• July 2009: Americans for Prosperity’s Colorado64 chapter
promoted the study through its blog.

• July 2009: Americans for Prosperity’s policy director Phil
Kerpen repeated the study’s findings in July 2009 testimony65
to the Western Caucuses Bicameral Hearing on Cap & Trade.

• August 2009: American Energy Alliance (AEA), IER’s
advocacy arm, incorporated the report’s findings into fact
sheets that it disseminated66 during its “American Energy
Express” bus tour in August 2009.

• September 2009: Americans for Prosperity’s Texas67 chapter
posted comments repeating the study’s faulty conclusions.

• September 2009: Americans for Prosperity’s policy director
Phil Kerpen repeated the study’s findings in online68 comments.

Case Study 4: The “Danish Study” on Wind Power

A similar play was conducted a few months later with another
study linked to the Koch web. The “Danish study,”69 prepared
by Danish think-tank CEPOS, provides clean energy op-
ponents a means of raising questions about the viability
of renewable energy and a means of directly criticizing
President Obama for his statement that Denmark produces
almost 20% of its electricity through wind power.

However, the study contains factual errors,71 its conclusions
have been misrepresented72 and to boot, its findings are
not particularly relevant to the US.73 The study includes
errors such as a miscalculation of the electricity production
from wind in Denmark (they claim 5% of total production in
Denmark though the real percentage is 20%). In addition, the
study does not take into account the differences between
the European and North American electric grids.

How does Koch Industries Influence the Climate Policy Debate?

Nevertheless, like the study from Spain, the CEPOS study is
being promoted and disseminated through many of the same
organizations in Koch’s web. The “Danish Study” appears to
follow a similar pattern.

• CEPOS was recently awarded74 a $100,000 grant from
the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, which has given
CEPOS “several awards.”75 The Charles G. Koch Foundation
and the Claude R. Lambe Foundation both support the Atlas
Economic Research Foundation.

• The Institute for Energy Research is promoting the study
among its members and Hill staff, as well as online.76 IER
organized a three-day tour in September 2009 to bring the
report’s co-author Hugh Sharman and CEPOS chief execu-
tive Martin Agerup to Washington D.C. to explain the study to
a “wider American audience.” The organization also created
fact sheets77 that promote the study’s findings and claim
President Obama is misusing the Danish example.

• Heritage Foundation promoted the study78 on their website.

Case Study 5: Koch Organizations Instrumental in
Dissemination of ACCF/NAM Claims

The Koch web is also playing a role in promoting other
studies that exaggerate the costs of climate policy. In 2008,
the Koch-web-funded American Council on Capital Forma-
tion’s (ACCF) teamed up with the National Association of
Manufacturers (NAM) to sponsor and disseminate a study
of the economic impact of the Lieberman-Warner Climate
Security Act. Every step of the way, Koch-funded anti-clean
energy groups played a key role in moving the NAM/ACCF
study in the media and at the grassroots level.

• ACCF funded and co-released the study with NAM.

• ACCF disseminated the results in presentations at over a
dozen “Climate Dialogues”79 organized by the U.S. Cham-
ber’s Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth (AEEG).80

• The (AEEG) “climate dialogues” involved other organizations
funded through the Koch web, including:

» The Heritage Foundation which provided speakers

for some events81

» Frontiers of Freedom staff and scholars participated82

in some of the dialogues.

What is Koch Industries?

Company History and Background

“My joke is that we’re the biggest company you’ve never heard of.” —David Koch.83

Koch Industries84 is the second-largest85 privately-held company in the United
States, a conglomerate of more than twenty companies with $100 billion in annual
sales, operations in nearly 60 countries86 and 70,000 employees.87 Koch’s industry
areas span petroleum refining, fuel pipelines, coal supply and trading, oil and gas
exploration, chemicals and polymers, fertilizer production, ranching and forestry
products.

Koch operates crude oil gathering systems and pipelines across North America.
Its Flint Hills Resources subsidiary owns refineries in Alaska, Minnesota, and Texas
that process more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil daily. The company owns
a 3% stake in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, 4,000 miles of oil and products
pipelines in the US, and an 80,000 barrels-per day refinery in Rotterdam.88 In
addition, Koch Industries has held multiple leases on the polluting tar sands of
Alberta, Canada since the 1990s and the Koch Pipeline Company operates the
pipelines that carry tar sands crude from Canada into Minnesota and Wisconsin
where Koch’s Flint Hill Resources owns oil refineries.89

The vast majority of Koch Industries assets are controlled by Charles G. and David
H. Koch, two of four sons of the company’s founder, who each own 42% of the
company stock. According to 2009 Forbes rankings, the Koch brothers are tied
for the 19th richest person90 in the world, and for ninth richest American,91 each
worth between $14 and $16 billion.

The corporation’s history dates back to the 1920s when Fred Koch, father to
Charles and David Koch, developed a process to refine more gasoline from
crude oil. When he tried to market his invention, the major oil companies sued
him for patent infringement. Koch eventually won a 15 year legal battle, but the
controversy made it tough to attract many US customers.92 Fred Koch went to

the Soviet Union in 1929, where he persuaded Josef Stalin’s
authoritarian government to pay him $5 million to build oil
refineries.93 Koch eventually grew disenchanted with Stalinism
and returned to the United States and helped found the
libertarian John Birch Society. Over time, Koch developed US
and global pipeline and drilling equipment businesses that
profited handsomely by servicing the major oil companies.
Fred Koch launched Wood River Oil & Refining in Illinois
(1940) and bought the Rock Island refinery in Oklahoma
(1947). He folded the remaining purchasing and gathering
network into his company, Rock Island Oil & Refining.94

Charles Koch renamed the company Koch Industries after
his father’s death in 1967. As the new CEO and chairman,
Charles began a series of acquisitions, adding petrochemical
and oil trading service operations. Koch Industries purchased
a Corpus Christi, Texas, refinery in 1981.95 It expanded its
pipeline system, buying Bigheart Pipe Line in Oklahoma
(1986) and two systems from Santa Fe Southern Pacific
(1988). In 1991 Koch purchased the Corpus Christi marine
terminal, pipelines, and gathering systems of Scurlock
Permian (a unit of Ashland Oil). In 1992 the company bought
United Gas Pipe Line (renamed Koch Gateway Pipeline) and
its pipeline system extending from Texas to Florida. Koch
Industries also acquired USX-Delhi Group, a natural gas
processor and transporter.

Koch Industries also diversified its industry areas under the
leadership of Charles Koch. Currently, the company owns
cattle ranches with a total of 15,000 head of cattle in Kansas,
Montana, and Texas. In 1998 Koch bought Purina Mills, the
largest US producer of animal feed. Lethargic energy and
livestock prices in 1998 and 1999, however, led Koch to lay
off several hundred employees, sell its feedlots, and divest
portions of its natural gas gathering and pipeline systems.
Purina Mills filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999 and was
acquired by US dairy co-op Land O’Lakes in 2001.

Koch acquired INVISTA, creators of Lycra®96 fiber and
Stainmaster® carpet, in 2004 for $4.2 billion from DuPont
Corporation.

In 2005, Koch paid over $13 billion for the Georgia-Pacific
Corporation, one of the world’s largest manufacturers and
distributors of tissue, pulp and paper, packaging, dimensional
lumber and plywood. The acquisition gave Koch Industries
its only recognizable retail products including Quilted North-
ern®, Angel Soft®, Brawny®, Vanity Fair® and Dixie® cups.

What is Koch Industries?
Company History and Background

Record of Environmental Crimes and Violations:
The Koch companies have a notorious environmental record. Some of the more
egregious examples include:

• In 2009, the US Justice Department and EPA announced that Koch Industries’
Invista subsidiary would pay a $1.7 million penalty and spend $500 million116 to fix
environmental violations at facilities in seven states, in an agreement with the US
EPA and Department of Justice.117

• Leaks on Koch-operated oil pipelines have resulted in major spills in Minnesota
in recent years. In December 2009, a Koch pipeline spilled 210,000 gallons of
crude oil in Philbrook, MN118 and another in 2005 spilled over 100,000 gallons in
Little Falls, Minnesota.119

• In May 2001, Koch Industries paid $25 million to settle with the US Government120
over a long-standing suit brought by Bill Koch—one of the brothers bought out
in 1983—for the company’s long-standing practice of illegally accounting for the
amount of oil removed from federal and Native American lands.

IN 2000, THE EPA FINED
KOCH INDUSTRIES $30
MILLION FOR ITS ROLE
IN 300 OIL SPILLS THAT
RESULTED IN MORE
THAN THREE MILLION
GALLONS OF CRUDE OIL
LEAKING INTO PONDS,
LAKES, STREAMS AND
COASTAL WATERS.

• In late 2000, the company was charged with covering up the
illegal releases of 91 tons of the known carcinogen benzene
from its refinery in Corpus Christi. Initially facing a 97-count
indictment and potential fines of $350 million, Koch cut a deal
with then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to drop all major
charges in exchange for a guilty plea for falsifying documents,
and a $20 million settlement.121

• In 2000, the EPA fined Koch Industries $30 million for its role
in 300 oil spills122 that resulted in more than three million gallons
of crude oil leaking into ponds, lakes, streams and coastal
waters.

• In 1999 a Koch subsidiary pleaded guilty to charges123 that
it had negligently allowed aviation fuel to leak into waters near
the Mississippi River from its refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota,
and that it had illegally dumped a million gallons of high-
ammonia wastewater onto the ground and into the Mississippi.

• Koch’s negligence toward environmental safety has led to
tragic losses of life. In 1996, a rusty and corroded Koch pipeline124
leaked flammable butane near a Texas residential neighbor-
hood. Warned by the smell of gas, two teenagers drove their
truck toward the nearest payphone to call for help, but they
never made it. Sparks from their truck ignited the gas cloud and
the two burned alive. The National Transportation Safety Board
determined125  that “the probable cause of this accident was the
failure of Koch to adequately protect its pipeline from corrosion”
and the ineffectiveness of Koch’s program to educate local
residents about how to respond during a pipeline leak.

Charles G. Koch. Chief Executive Officer, Koch Indus-
tries. Ranked as 9th richest American, worth $16 billion.
Born in 1935. Lives in Wichita, Kansas. Co-founder of
the Cato Institute.

David H. Koch. Executive Vice-President, Koch Indus-
tries. Ranked as 9th richest American, worth $16 billion.
Born in 1940. Lives in New York City. Co-founder and
chairman of Americans for Prosperity.

Charles G. Koch98, born in 1935, is the CEO and Chairman of Koch Industries. His father, Fred
Koch, was a staunch libertarian and a founder of the John Birch Society.99 Like his father, Charles is also an
ardent supporter of libertarian and conservative organizations. He is a co-founder of the Cato Institute100, the
Chairman of the Institute for Humane Studies101, and has sponsored multiple conferences102 for entrepreneurs to
encourage them to fund free-market groups. Charles has even applied his libertarian ideology to the structure of
Koch Industries, using his own trademarked “Market Based Management”103 to run the entire company. “Just as
central planning is a failure in running government, so it is at the level of the firm,” says Charles.

The U.S. Senate investigated104 Charles Koch for his alleged role in funding so-called “issue ads” that violated
campaign law by helping conservative Republican congressional candidates in 1996. Koch Industries has been
the largest oil and gas industry contributor to electoral campaigns since the 2006 election105 cycle. During the 2008
elections, Koch Industries contributed over $1.8 million106, 88% to Republican candidates.

The Koch Brothers

Charles and his brother David were involved in a decades-long family dispute107 with their brothers,
Bill and Fred, regarding a buy-out of company shares. Bill and Fred claimed that Charles and David
shortchanged them by $340 million. The vicious lawsuits began in the early 1980s and continued for
nearly two decades.

David H. Koch108, born in 1940, is Executive Vice-President of Koch Industries, and
the CEO of the subsidiary Koch Chemical Technology Group. According to the 2009 Forbes ranking,
he is the second-richest109 person living in New York City, following Michael Bloomberg. In addition to
his Park Avenue residence, he has homes in Aspen, CO; Southampton, NY; and Palm Beach, FL.110
Although he’s donated millions to conservative, libertarian organizations, David Koch has only garnered
public attention for his non-political philanthropy. Regarding a $100 million naming gift to the New York
City Opera and Ballet, he explains “I could afford it.…And, of course, there are beautiful girls.”111 A few
of his namesakes include the new David H. Koch Theater at New York’s Lincoln Center, the David H.
Koch Dinosaur Wing in New York’s American Natural History Museum,112 and the new David H. Koch
Hall of Human Origins113 at Smithsonian’s Natural History Museum in Washington D.C.

David Koch was the 1980 Vice Presidential candidate114 for the anti-regulatory Libertarian Party. Cur-
rently, David Koch is on the Board of Directors for the Cato Institute as well as the Reason Foundation,
two right-wing, climate-denier think-tanks. He is also a founding member and Chairman115 of the Ameri-
cans for Prosperity Foundation, an astroturf group that opposes climate solutions and clean energy.

Koch Climate Opposition Funding:

The Koch Web

“Koch’s  chief  political  influence  tool  is  a  web  of  interconnected,  right-wing  think  tanks
and advocacy groups funded by foundations controlled and supported by the two Koch
brothers.”–Center for Public Integrity126

The Koch brothers, their family members and Koch Industries
employees direct a web of financing that supports conserva-
tive and libertarian special interest groups and think-tanks,
with a strong focus on fighting environmental regulation and
easing limits on industrial pollution.127

of dollars of contributions to these groups, such as U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, state Chambers of Commerce, the
National Association of Manufacturers and its state affiliates,
the American Petroleum Institute and others. Comprehensive
examination and research of the entire Koch web is ongoing.

This web is currently fueling a campaign to oppose clean
energy and climate legislation, by funding organizations that
generate, disseminate and repeat inaccurate and misleading
information about climate science, clean energy and climate
policies. This information is then provided to astroturf groups
(fake grassroots organizations that are created or sponsored
by industries)—some of which are also funded by Koch
interests—which use the misinformation to increase opposi-
tion to clean energy policies and climate solutions.

Koch foundations contributed over $48 million to climate
opposition groups from 1997 to 2008. The climate debate
heated up in 1997 around the Kyoto Protocol international
negotiations, galvanizing corporate opposition to climate
policy. The volume of funding has increased significantly
in recent years as climate policy has gained momentum in
the United States. One half of the Koch grants since 1997
were dispersed in recent years, between 2005 to 2008. As
a rough indicator of the scale and significance of this invest-
ment, the Koch foundations surpass ExxonMobil and the
ExxonMobil Foundation as a funding source to organizations
that generate and disseminate misinformation on the science
of and solutions to global warming. From 2005 to 2008, the
Koch Foundations provided $24.9 million in funding to such
groups; during the same time ExxonMobil provided about
$8.9 million to groups with similar activities.

The Koch web spans beyond clean energy and climate
concerns, and beyond connections plainly visible through
publicly available funding trails and records. Many of the
organizations funded by Koch are also working against health
care reform. Koch’s interests are also advocated through
dozens of trade associations (501-C-6’s). Koch Industries nor
its owners or officers are required to report potentially millions

Sources of data for Koch Foundation grants
Foundations disclose major recipients of grants on their IRS
990 forms (tax returns). The data cited in this report comes
from the foundations’ IRS 990 tax forms, accessed through
the GuideStar database and from data available on the

Koch Climate Opposition Funding:

The Foundations
Climate denial organizations receive millions of dollars
in grants made by three Koch-controlled foundations:
the Claude R. Lambe foundation; the Charles G. Koch
foundation; and the David H. Koch foundation.

Claude R. Lambe Foundation
The Claude R. Lambe Foundation is the financier of
organizations taking a more visible, active role in day-to-
day efforts to oppose clean energy and climate policy.
The Foundation contributed $12.2 million to climate
opposition groups since 2005.

The Board of Directors is comprised entirely of Koch
family members, senior Koch executives and staff who
serve Koch foundations:128

—  President
—  Secretary
—  Treasurer

• Richard Fink
• Logan Moore
• Vonda Holliman
• Charles G. Koch  —  Director
• Elizabeth B. Koch  —  Director
• Elizabeth R. Koch  —  Director
• Charles C. Koch  —  Director

Charles G. Koch Foundation
The Charles G. Koch Foundation tends to fund institutes
that broadly support efforts to oppose clean energy and
climate legislation. The Foundation contributed $11.7
million since 2005 to such climate denial organizations
and front groups.

The Board of Directors129 of the Charles G. Koch Founda-
tion is nearly identical to that of the Claude R. Lambe
Foundation:

—
• Richard Fink
—
• Kevin Gentry
—
• Logan Moore
• Vonda Holliman  —
• Charles G. Koch  —
• Elizabeth B. Koch  —
• Elizabeth R. Koch  —
• Charles C. Koch  —

David H. Koch Foundation
The David H. Koch Foundation historically had a wide array
of conservative, anti-environmental grant recipients. From
1997 to 2008 the foundation contributed over $9 million to
climate opposition groups. Since 2005, the Foundation has
contributed $1 million to the Americans for Prosperity Foun-
dation (AFP). AFP is the only climate denial organization to
recently receive money from the David H. Koch Foundation.
David Koch is a co-founder and chairman of AFP.

The small staff of the David H. Koch Foundation includes:130

• David H. Koch  —  President/Director
• Ruth E. Williams  —  Secretary
• Vonda Holliman  —  Treasurer

Koch Foundations and Climate Denial

For this analysis, Koch foundation grants were tabulated from 1997 to 2008 (the most recent year of available contribution
information). To simplify the presentation, all grants from the three Koch Foundations have been totaled for each organiza-
tion. Specific donations from each foundation to each organization are detailed at www.greenpeace.org/kochmoney. The
list below includes contributions to those organizations that have been documented to be propagating misinformation
about clean energy policies and climate science.

Since 1997, the Koch foundations have contributed over $48 million in grants to climate opposition groups.
More than half that total, almost $25 million, was given since 2005.

Total Koch foundation funding
$24,888,282—Recently contributed to climate opposition groups, between 2005–2008
$48,510,856—Total contributed to climate opposition groups, between 1997–2008

Combined grants from Koch foundations (Claude R. Lambe, Charles G. Koch, and David H. Koch Foundations) to climate
opposition groups (sorted in descending order by total funding):

Mercatus Center
$9,247,500 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $9,874,500]

The Mercatus Center131 is a conservative think-tank at George Mason University, in which Charles Koch sits on the Board
of Directors.132 The Mercatus Center suggested in 2001 that global warming would be, “beneficial, occurring at night, in the
winter, and at the poles.”133 In 2009, they conceded that global warming is man-made and problematic but recommend
doing nothing to cut emissions, instead promoting “work to facilitate movement of people from areas likely to be harmed
by climate change.”134

Americans for Prosperity Foundation (AFP)
$5,176,500 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[No Koch foundation grants received prior to 2005]

Beginning in 2008, Americans For Prosperity135 organized astroturf “Hot Air Tour” with a hot air balloon136 local events
across the country to build opposition to clean energy and climate legislation. This astroturf campaign has been repeatedly
exposed by the media, including the Wall Street Journal’s blog137, Environmental Capital. AFP also runs the “No Climate
Tax”138 campaign and helped organize the “Tea Parties” tax protests.139 Koch executives Richard Fink and Wayne Gable
have strong interconnections with AFP.

Institute for Humane Studies (IHS)
$1,967,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $3,923,457]

The Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University offers scholarships and career training to libertarian
students. Charles Koch is the chairman of the IHS board of directors.140 In a recent article, Mother Jones called the Institute
for Human Studies a “haven for climate change deniers.”141 Several climate deniers have prominent positions at IHS,
including: Robert Bradley142, member of the Academic Review Committee and author of Climate Alarmism Reconsidered
(2003)143; and Fred Singer144, Research Professor at IHS. A number of climate deniers are guest lecturers for IHS, such as
Bruce Yandle145, Senior Associate146 with Political Economy Research Center, and Kenneth Green147, Resident Scholar148 with
American Enterprise Institute.

Koch Foundations and Climate Denial

The Heritage Foundation
$1,620,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $3,358,000]

The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank149 that misinterprets science and
policy regarding the climate150 and uses their conclusions to argue against action on global warming. Recently the Heritage
Foundation has: misinterpreted the impacts of global warming151 on the US economy; twisted news reports to justify claims
about ‘climate taxes’152; issued deceptive economic analyses and presentations153; and released allegations about economic
ruin and job losses154 from green stimulus investments by Congress. Heritage Foundation also teamed up with Institute for
Energy Research (IER155) to promote the widely debunked “Spanish” study.156

Cato Institute
$1,028,400 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $5,278,400]

The Cato Institute is focused on disputing the science behind global warming and questioning
the rationale157 for taking action. The organization’s 2009 “Handbook for Policymakers”158 on global
warming begins with the suggestions that Congress should “pass no legislation restricting emissions of carbon dioxide” and
“inform the public about how little climate change would be prevented by proposed legislation.” Robert Bradley, an adjunct
scholar at the Cato Institute, is also a founder and the CEO of the Institute for Energy Research. In 2007 the Cato Foundation
gave $120,000159 to New Hope Environmental Services, an “advocacy science consulting firm” founded and run by long-time
climate science denier Patrick Michaels160, who uses New Hope to publish his World Climate Report, a sort of ongoing
journal of denial of climate science. Michaels is also a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, which paid him $98,000161 to write a
book “The Satanic Gases” with fellow climate denier Robert Balling. Over the years, Michaels’ work has been financed by a
number of coal and polluter interests162, including the Western Fuels Association, the Intermountain Rural Electric Association,
and others.

The Manhattan Institute
$800,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $1,325,000]

The Institute publishes climate science denials163 and has hosted Bjorn Lomborg164, a prominent spokesperson against
addressing climate change, at Manhattan Institute events165 several times over the last two years.

Washington Legal Foundation (WLF)
$655,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $1,255,000]

WLF publishes articles on the business threats posed by regulation of global warming pollution, such as vulnerability
to tort claims.166

Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies
$542,500 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $1,750,700]

The Federalist Society advocates for inaction on global warming: “Global warming is nothing more than an educated guess
by many of the same scientists who are still arguing about what happened to the dinosaurs. Perhaps we should think care-
fully before putting blind faith in people who cannot explain the simple disappearance of tens of millions of creatures, many of
which were the size of locomotives.”167

In a Federalist Society Newsletter from 2000, they claim: “The science is not settled (as claimed by Vice President Gore),
that it is not “compelling” (as claimed by President Clinton), and that there is certainly no scientific consensus favoring global
warming. If anything, the largest number of scientists, some 17,000, signed a petition against the Kyoto Protocol in 1998.”168

Koch Foundations and Climate Denial

Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment
$365,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $1,460,000]

Peter Geddes169, Executive Vice President of FREE170, has advocated against taking action171
on climate change because warming is “inevitable” and expensive to address. In addition, FREE sponsors seminars for
federal judges172 that have been criticized for creating judicial conflicts of interest. FREE states173 it only takes money for judicial
seminars from foundations whose founder is deceased (termed “dead-man foundations” by FREE), and that corporate
funding does not fund judicial seminars. However, the Claude R. Lambe foundation has been listed as a funder of at least
six seminars since 1997. A 1999 Koch Foundations report questions this rationale, stating “Charles Koch’s control of Koch
industries…calls into question the relevance of this term, as defined by FREE, if not the accuracy of the disclosure.”174

Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy (PRIPP)
$360,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $1,100,000]

PRIPP supported and funded An Inconvenient Truth…or Convenient Fiction175, a film attacking the science of global warming
and intended as a rebuttal to former Vice-President Al Gore’s documentary. The film was produced by PRIPP Senior Fellow
Steven Hayward and promoted176 by the Heritage Foundation. Hayward is also an IER board member and a fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute. Hayward and another AEI colleague were exposed177 two years ago for offering to pay IPCC
scientists $10,000 for critiques of the IPCC findings.

Tax Foundation
$325,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $525,000]

The Tax Foundation opposed American Clean Energy and Security Act178 and issued a study179 on the costs of climate change
legislation. Wayne Gable, a former Managing Director of Federal Affairs at Koch Industries, served as President of the Tax
Foundation from 1989–1991.

Independent Women’s Forum (IWF)
$290,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
 [Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $335,000]

IWF has spread misinformation on climate science and touts the work of climate deniers.180 IWF was run by Nancy Pfo-
tenhauer181 (formerly Nancy Mitchell), who was Koch Industries’ chief in-house lobbyist182 from 1996 to 2001. In 2003, IWF
affiliated itself with Americans for Prosperity183 (AFP), a group that split from Citizens for a Sound Economy. Pfotenhauer
served as president and CEO of AFP until 2005184. Pfotenhauer left IWF to work on the McCain presidential campaign. More
recently, IWF soft-launched a project called Mothers for Educating with Sound Science (MESS)185 including radio appear-
ances questioning the science of global warming and warning of dire impacts of global warming pollution regulation.

Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF)
$283,125 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $393,999]

TPPF fellows recently wrote on why reducing global warming pollution won’t work186 and the devastating impact the American
Clean Energy and Security Act187 would have on all aspects of American life.

Koch Foundations and Climate Denial

American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF)
$215,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $225,000]

ACCF has partnered twice with the National Association of Manufacturers to produce and disseminate distorted economic
analyses188 that overstate the costs of climate legislation and have been prominently featured at US Chamber of Commerce-
organized “forums”189 on climate over the past year. The ACCF/NAM studies have been credibly debunked190 more than once.191

George C. Marshall Institute
$210,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $240,000]

The George C. Marshall Institute192 has a long history of global warming denial, including
publication of junk science reports funded by the American Petroleum Institute and authored by Sallie Baliunas193, a scientist
affiliated with several organizations194 receiving money from oil corporations. The Marshall Institute also produced a “Cocktail
Conversation Guide”195 with suggestions for denying the dangers of global warming in any social setting.

The Reason Foundation
$205,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $1,706,200]

The Foundation promotes the tenets of “Free Market Environmentalism (FME)”196 to argue that those who suffer from the
effects of global warming have little legal or moral claim for compensation from GHG emitters.

Institute for Energy Research (IER)
$175,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $235,000]

IER supported and promoted the “Spanish”197 and “Danish”198 studies critical of clean energy jobs, both of which have been
debunked by credible sources. IER also argues that efforts to curb global warming would accomplish little at too great a
cost199, promotes ACCF/NAM and Heritage Foundation studies200 that exaggerate the costs of climate policy, and discourages
U.S. leadership201 on the international stage. Robert Bradley, a former Enron executive, is the CEO of IER and one of its
founders. Thomas Pyle, a former Koch and oil-industry lobbyist, is the President of IER and the American Energy Alliance
(AEA), the 501c4 counterpart to IER. AEA was founded by the National Association of Manufacturers and the American
Petroleum Institute202 to fight the BTU tax proposal in 1993, and in recent years funded by ExxonMobil and Koch Industries.203
AEA has been active in the climate debate, from running ads repeating false claims about the costs of climate legislation to
trashing clean energy at town halls204 around the US.

Fraser Institute
$175,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[No Koch foundation grants received prior to 2005]

The Fraser Institute205 publishes in-depth critiques of climate science, including a 110-page report attacking the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change’s Fourth Assessment report. They also offer lesson plans206 and educational materials207
designed to encourage children to be skeptical of mainstream climate science.

Frontiers of Freedom
$150,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $175,000]

Frontiers of Freedom208 has actively opposed global warming action for over a decade. As Director of Policy with Frontiers of

denial and high estimates of the cost of climate policy. FF reinforced the Tax Foundations’ characterization of climate regula-
tions as a tax on the poor and middle class.212 FF also smears213 climate science and spreads typical climate disinformation.214

National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA)
$130,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $570,000]

American Council on Science and Health (ACSH)
$125,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[No Koch foundation grants received prior to 2005]

In 1997, ACSH released a position paper217 titled, “Global Climate Change and Human Health,” which claims that cutting
green house gas emissions, because it would hurt the economy, would be more detrimental to public health than global
warming. “...policymakers can safely take several decades to plan a response, and scientists will have enough time to
develop cost-effective and anti-climate-change strategies.” Among the reviewers of the report were famous climate deniers
Sallie Baliunas218 and Fred Singer.219

Atlas Economic Research Foundation
$113,800 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008

$100,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $150,000]

AEI has a long track record223 of distorting the science and solutions of climate change. Its argu-
ments224 tend to de-emphasize the environmental and economic risks of climate change, exaggerate the costs of addressing
the problem and question the value of putting a policy in place at all, as illustrated by a recent Wall Street Journal oped225 by
AEI fellow Steven Hayward.

Independence Institute
$85,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $291,000]

array of Koch-funded opposition organizations including IER, ACCF, Mercatus and other sources. ALEC publishes its own
materials as well, including a “Climate Change Overview for State Legislators”229 which downplays the science and risks of
global warming and exaggerates the costs of addressing it. The Overview was written by Daniel Simmons, who moved from
ALEC to become AEA’s Director of State Affairs. Simmons was at the Mercatus Institute before ALEC and is a graduate of
the George Mason University School of Law.

Media Research Center (MRC)
$14,030 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $15,005]

The Media Research Center245 is a conservative news organization that analyzes and spins mainstream news content in order
to counter an alleged “strident liberal bias”.246 MRC has several projects that analyze various types and angles of media.
These projects, such as the “Business and Media Institute” and “Free Market Project,” have released several reports that
claim the national media favors247 the environmental view on global warming and excludes climate deniers in their coverage.248
The Media Research Center has also contributed to the “ClimateGate” echo chamber249, criticizing national media outlets for
a lack of “ClimateGate” coverage.

John Locke Foundation (JLF)
$10,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $85,000]

The John Locke Foundation250 is a conservative think-tank based in North Carolina, focused on local and state issues. JLF
advocates for inaction on global warming, stating in a 2005 policy brief251 that “a green house gas reduction policy would have
only costs and no benefits.” In 2007, JLF released a policy report252 that publishes several climate denier myths, intended to
instruct average North Carolina citizens on refuting global warming. On JLF’s “Right Angles” blog, the “ClimateGate” cover-
age253 calls for a “reconsideration of ‘green’ efforts” and notes that some have tried to rescind the Oscar Vice President Al
Gore received for An Inconvenient Truth.

National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF)
$5,000 received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $32,500]

In an open letter to Representative Mary Bono-Mack254 and to Representative Walt Minnick255, the National Taxpayers Union
advocates against the carbon regulatory measures in the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 as a “tax hike”
without acknowledging the environmental or economic benefits. “If Congress deems carbon dioxide emissions to be a prob-
lem worthy of attention, then it should confront them without raising taxes on struggling American families in the process.”

Citizens for a Sound Economy (now FreedomWorks)
No grants received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
 [Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $6,510,375]

Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE)256 was founded by David Koch in 1984, which split in 2003257 into Americans For
Prosperity and FreedomWorks.258 FreedomWorks is an astroturf group led by former U.S. Representative Dick Armey, with
a mission of promoting a conservative agenda. The astroturf group tries to cast doubt on the need for climate legislation259,
declaring: “organizations pushing action on global warming – such as the United Nations, the environmental movement, and
former Vice President Al Gore – have substantial institutional, ideological, and financial stakes in creating a restrictive new
layer of global warming regulation.” FreedomWorks also participates in the echochamber260 around the “ClimateGate” story.

Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)
No grants received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $471,420]

CEI, among many other statements denying the seriousness of global warming,
has argued that climate change would create a “milder, greener, more prosperous world” and that “Kyoto was a power grab
based on deception and fear.” CEI maintains a website262 as part of their aggressive campaign to convince the public that
global warming is uncertain, and has spent considerable time and effort adding to the echo chamber around “ClimateGate.”

Heartland Institute (HI)
No grants received from Koch foundations 2005–2008
[Total Koch foundation grants 1997–2008: $30,000]

The Heartland Institute264, a Chicago-based, industry-funded conservative think-tank,
has had a long history of climate denial that continues today. Since 2007, HI has
hosted their annual International Conference on Climate Change265, where dozens of
climate deniers converge266 to discuss issues and strategies to oppose climate action.
On their global warming website, HI has dozens of articles267, dating back to 1996,
documenting their perspective that the Kyoto Protocol is unnecessary because “greenhouse gas (GHG) levels will unlikely
ever pose a problem.”268 The Heartland Institute has also been a major part of the “Climategate” echo chamber. The Institute
has posted dozens of blogs to exaggerate the significance of the incident, claiming “the global movement to ‘do something’
about global warming…stands discredited”269 and “the IPCC should be disbanded as a threat to mankind.”270 In addition to
blogs, spokespeople from the Heartland Institute271 have commented on “ClimateGate” several times in the media as well.

Lobbying and Political Spending

It is worth noting that Koch also hires outside lawyers to lobby on its behalf, in some cases the
same firms that lobby for other groups of which Koch is a member. For example:

• Siff and Lake, $190,000 (2009), $220,000 (2008), $200,000 (2007), which also lobbies for

Western Fuels Association.

• Mehlman/Vogel, $200,000 (2009), $120,000 (2008), $20,000 (2007) which also lobbies for
API (2009, 2008), Business Roundtable (2009, 2008), EEI (2009, 2008) and Energy Future
Holdings (2009).

• Pyle and Associates, $40,000 (2007), which also lobbied for the National Petrochemical and

Refiners Association279, of which Koch is a member.

• The Rhoads Group, $100,000 (2007) which also lobbies for the National Petrochemical and

Refiners Association280 of which Koch is a member.

• Hunton and Williams, $60,000 (2009), $150,000 (2008), $80,000 (2007), which also lobbied

for National Association of Manufacturers (2009, 2008) and Americans for Affordable Climate
Policy (2009), Edison Electric Institute (2009, 2008, 2007), Gas Processing Association (2009,
2008) and the Foundation for Environment and Economic Progress (2009, 2008, 2007))
• Capitol Tax Partners, $30,000 (2009), $240,000 (2008), $220,000 (2007), which who also

lobbies for Edison Electric Institute (2009, 2008, 2007) and National Electrical Manufacturers
Association (2008, 2007)

 In addition, Koch executives serve on the boards of other organizations wielding influence
against clean energy and climate policy. The Executive Vice President for Operations Excellence
& Compliance at Koch Industries, James Mahoney, is also a vice-president of the National
Petrochemical & Refiners Association (NPRA). NPRA significantly increased its lobbying budget
in 2009, reporting $1.68 million in direct federal lobbying expenses.181 This more than doubled the
lobby spending of the organization from 2008, when its total lobbying budget was $810,000.

didates283 and committees than any other oil-and-gas sector based PAC. For that period, Koch Industries
and its executives spent $3.55 million compared to next three biggest contributors: Exxon ($2.6 million),
Chevron ($2.08 million), and Valero ($2.03 million).

3. Family and Individual Political Contributions

Charles and David Koch, along with their wives, have contributed substantial amounts to federal GOP party
committees. Since the 2006 election cycle, Koch family members contributed at least $270,800 to the
Republican National Committee (RNC), NRSC, and NRCC.

• 2006 election cycle: $101,400
