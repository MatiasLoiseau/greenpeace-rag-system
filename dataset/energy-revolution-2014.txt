© ROBERT MEYERS / GREENPEACE “WE CAN CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT SUPERSTORM SANDY, AND THE MOST SEVERE DROUGHT IN DECADES, AND THE WORST WILDFIRES SOME 
STATES HAVE EVER SEEN WERE ALL JUST A FREAK COINCIDENCE. OR WE CAN CHOOSE TO BELIEVE IN THE OVERWHELMING JUDGMENT OF 
SCIENCE – AND ACT BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE .” PRESIDENT BARRACK OBAMA-FROM 2013 STATE OF THE UNION.introduction 
A wide political spectrum worries that the American middle class 
has fallen in stature. An echelon class of fewer than 1% have 
benefited from relaxing all manner of safeguards that were 
supposed to referee self-interest in order for the economy as a 
whole could prosper. In real terms, wages for the vast majority of
Americans have not risen, or have fallen, for the last few decades.
For most, the ‘jobless recovery’ seems almost a numbers game 
played by politicians and investment bankers.
This report demonstrates that a transition to a renewable energy 
economy can free resources for economic development. It means 
more and better jobs, greater energy independence, and it is more 
democratic as citizens attain more control of their energy demand 
and supply. 
Even today the United States mines a billion tons of coal each year,
most of which is burned at home. Coal has monopolized almost half
of US rail capacity, not counting the eventual transportation of toxic 
coal ash which is the second largest waste stream in the country. The 
electricity sector is the largest user of freshwater, with a fossil-based 
system using steam turbines, and coal is the worst culprit. One thing is certain about the Energy (R)evolution – it is 
happening. In some ways it's happening even more quickly than we 
proposed in previous scenarios, as Chapter 4 shows. The US 
scenario aims to wean the economy off dirty fuels as thoroughly 
and quickly as possible, but also in a way that is technologically,
politically, and ecologically realistic. 
The driving goal of the Energy [R]evolution is stopping global
climate disruption, which is caused primarily by burning coal, oil,
and methane gas. But the reasons to modernize our energy system 
are innumerable. 
Our antiquated, fossil fuel-based system hoards resources to deal
with incessant inputs, outputs, and undesirable externalities – 
extraction, transportation, fuel processing, combustion, pollution 
abatement, and waste processing or storage. In a post-recession 
world, it has become obvious that we have neglected upkeep of
infrastructure that is required for the economy to function. Bridges 
need maintenance, urban sewer systems are corroded, entire cities 
like Detroit have been abandoned by industry. ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
6

And, yet, the fact that industry is having to rely on more extreme 
and costly methods to produce their wares is a sign their end is 
nigh. Already, wind and solar out-compete fossil fuel-produced 
electricity in some parts of the country, despite federal subsidies 
that favor fossil fuels by several fold. A precipitous drop in 
domestic coal demand has made industry invest in exports for their 
survival, not just to increase profits. But Americans in the Pacific 
Northwest are rejecting attempts to build export terminals in states 
that will be shutting down their last coal plants in just a few years.
People are onto the fact that coal, oil, and methane gas from 
anywhere sully the planet everywhere. 
The US government needs to view both demand and supply of fossil
fuels as a problem. We must abolish all support for dirty energy,
whether used domestically or abroad. Legislation like the “End 
Polluter Welfare Act,” introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-
VT) and Congressman Keith Ellison (D-MN) is a good start.
President Obama banning public financing of coal-fired power 
plants abroad is another good step. But it's not nearly enough; we 
need much more action by our leaders.
At the same time, we need American leadership that accepts 
humility in the face of intransigent domestic politics, instead of
pulling other countries down to our level. That means allowing other 
nations to take climate as seriously as they do trade and negotiate 
international legally binding commitments. The Paris climate treaty 
in 2015 cannot be the culmination of efforts to turn climate 
negotiations into a polluters anonymous meeting, while trade 
treaties grandfather environmental loopholes lobbied for by carbon-
intensive industries. 
A day will soon come when the Republican party abandons its climate 
denier platform, and the President realizes her climate legacy rides on 
complete embrace of a clean energy economy – these two 
developments will undoubtedly be mutually reinforcing. In the 
meantime, other policymakers and citizens across the country can 
keep moving forward with the US Energy (R)evolution.Water impacts are also a dominant concern regarding of oil and 
gas extraction. Fracking has come to symbolize the wanton abuse 
by an industry historically unfettered by federal health standards.
Parts of the country like West Texas are stricken by drought, and 
sucked even dryer to get at the fuel, the burning of which is causing 
climate disruptions like phenomenal lack of rain. Meanwhile, re-
injecting their fracking wastes deep into the ground under intense 
pressures has made neighboring Oklahoma the second most
earthquake-prone state. 
It is incredibly frustrating that the first President to make climate a 
rhetorical priority has decided to embrace extreme fossil fuel
extraction. The President may accept climate science in theory, but he 
appears to deny the required time line for action to avoid runaway 
climate change. Scientists give the global community maybe to the 
end of the decade to peak global emissions. The great weakness of
President Obama’s climate policy approach is that it remains insular 
rather than global, which includes overt support for increasing global
supply of fossil fuels.
President Obama’s quintessentially pandering energy platform of
‘all of the above’ has done little, if anything, to forestall climate 
denier attacks on timid use of administrative authority to help the 
climate – assuming, optimistically, this is the President's reasoning.
His administration has expanded drilling into new parts of the 
outer-continental shelf, including into ultra-deepwater. As the 
pristine and fragile Arctic melts, rather than increase emphasis on 
protection of the ecosystem the President has begun permitting on 
production drilling for the first time. He has opened public lands to 
fracking. He has increased subsidized sales of publicly-owned coal.
His administration is overseeing an historic rise in development of
new terminals for export of coal and methane gas, considering 
crude oil exports, while his diplomats lobby foreign governments to 
increase imports. None of this can be justified in exchange for an 
international commitment to reduce US territorial emissions by 
17% below 2005 levels (4% below 1990). Emissions are falling,
but most of it is not due to the President's policies. By the time the 
Obama Climate Plan was announced in his fifth year in office,
emissions were already down 12% from 2005. EPA has not yet
established pollution limits on existing power plants.

8ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
The expert consensus is that a fundamental shift in the way we 
consume and generate energy must begin immediately and be well
underway within the next ten years in order to avert the worst
impacts of climate change.1The scale of the challenge requires a 
complete transformation of the way we produce, consume and 
distribute energy, while maintaining economic growth. The five key 
principles behind this Energy [R]evolution will be to: 
•Implement renewable solutions, especially through decentralized 
energy systems and grid expansions 
•Respect the natural limits of the environment 
•Phase out dirty, unsustainable energy sources 
•Create greater equity in the use of resources 
•Decouple economic growth from the consumption of fossil fuels 
Decentralized energy systems, where power and heat are produced 
close to the point of final use will avoid the current energy waste in 
distribution. Investments in ‘climate infrastructure’ such as smartinteractive grids and super grids to transport large quantities of
offshore wind and concentrating solar power are essential. Building 
up clusters of renewable micro grids, especially for people living in 
remote areas, will be a central tool in providing sustainable 
electricity to the almost two billion people around who currently 
don’t have access to electricity. 
the energy [r]evolution for USA – key results 
Renewable energy sources account for 6.6% of USA’s primary energy 
demand in 2011. The main sources are biomass which is mostly used for 
heating and hydro and wind, used for power generation.
For electricity generation renewables contributed in 2011 about
13% and for heat supply around 10%, the majority from biomass 
but increasingly from solar thermal collectors and although to a 
much lower extend - geothermal heat pumps as well. About 93% of
the primary energy supply today still comes from fossil fuels.

9The Energy [R]evolution scenario describes development pathways to a 
sustainable energy supply, achieving the urgently needed CO 2reduction 
target and a fossil fuel phase-out. The results of the Energy [R]evolution 
scenario which will be achieved through the following measures:
•Curbing energy demand:Combining the projections on population 
development, GDP growth and energy intensity results in future 
development pathways for North America’s final energy demand.
Under the Reference scenario, which reflects a continuation of
current trends and policies (see chapter 3, page 31), total
primary energy demand increases by 11% from the current
95,201 Trillion BTU/a to around 105,800 Trillion BTU/a in 
2050. In the Energy [R]evolution scenario, primary energy 
demand decreases by 40% compared to current consumption and 
it is expected to reach around 57,500 Trillion BTU/a by 2050.
•Controlling power demand:Under the Energy [R]evolution scenario,
electricity demand is expected to decrease in both the industry sector 
as well as in the residential and service sector, but to grow in the 
transport sector. Total electricity demand will rise from 3,796 TWh/a 
to 4,153 TWh/a by the year 2050. Compared to the Reference 
scenario, efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service 
sectors avoid the generation of about 1,930 TWh/a. This reduction 
can be achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient electronic 
devices using the best available technology in all demand sectors.
•Reducing heating demand : Compared to the Reference scenario,
consumption equivalent to around 5,380 Trillion BTU/a is avoided 
through efficiency gains by 2050. As a result of energy-related 
renovation of the existing stock of residential buildings, as well as 
the introduction of low energy standards and ‘passive houses’ for 
new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services 
will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.
•Electricity generation : The development of the electricity supply 
sector is characterized by a dynamically growing renewable energy 
market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. This will
compensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the 
number of fossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilization.
By 2050, 97% of the electricity produced in the USA will come from 
renewable energy sources. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, solar 
thermal energy and PV – will contribute 88% of electricity 
generation. Already by 2020 the share of renewable electricity 
production will be 37% and 71% by 2030. The installed capacity of
renewables will reach 1,366 GW in 2030 and 1,857 GW by 2050.
•Future costs of electricity generation : The introduction of
renewable technologies under the Energy [R]evolution scenario 
slightly increases the future costs of electricity generation 
compared to the Reference scenario. This difference will be only 
around 0.3 cent/kWh up to 2025, however, if increasing fossil
fuel prices are assumed. Because of high costs for conventional
fuels and the lower CO 2intensity of electricity generation,
electricity generation costs will become economically favorable 
under the Energy [R]evolution scenario and by 2050 costs will be 
10.5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference version.•The future electricity bill:Under the Reference scenario, on the 
other hand, unchecked growth in demand, an increase in fossil fuel
prices and the cost of CO 2emissions result in total electricity 
supply costs rising from today’s US$ 469 billion per year to more 
than US$ 1,088 billion in 2050. The Energy [R]evolution scenario 
not only complies with US CO 2reduction targets but also helps to 
stabilize energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.
Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to 
renewables leads to long term costs for electricity supply that are 
47% lower than in the Reference scenario. 
•Future investment in power generation : It would require 
US$ 6,750 billion in investment for the Energy [R]evolution 
scenario to become reality (including investments for replacement
after the economic lifetime of the plants) - approximately US$ 
4,080 billion or US$ 102 billion annual more than in the Reference 
scenario (US$ 2,670 billion). Under the Reference version, the 
levels of investment in conventional power plants add up to almost
66% while approx. 34% would be invested in renewable energy 
and cogeneration (CHP) until 2050. Under the Energy [R]evolution 
scenario, however, USA would shift almost 95% of the entire 
investment towards renewables and cogeneration. Until 2030, the 
fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be focused 
mainly on CHP plants. The average annual investment in the power 
sector under the Energy [R]evolution scenario between today and 
2050 would be approximately US$ 170 billion.
•Fuel costs savings : Because non-biomass renewable energy has no 
fuel costs, however, the fossil fuel cost savings (excluding nuclear) 
in the Energy [R]evolution scenario reach a total of US$ 6,100 
billion up to 2050, or US$ 153 billion per year. The total fuel
cost savings therefore would cover 150% of the total additional
investments compared to the Reference scenario. These renewable 
energy sources would then go on to produce electricity without
any further fuel costs beyond 2050, while the costs for coal and 
gas will continue to be a burden on national economies.
•Heating supply : Today, renewables meet 10% of USA’s primary 
energy demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming 
from the use of biomass. The lack of district heating networks is 
a severe structural barrier to the large scale utilization of
geothermal and solar thermal energy. Dedicated support
instruments are required to ensure a dynamic development. In the 
Energy [R]evolution scenario, renewables provide 45% of USA’s 
total heat demand in 2030 and 94% in 2050. Energy efficiency 
measures help to reduce the currently growing energy demand for 
heating by 28% in 2050 (relative to the Reference scenario), in 
spite of improving living standards. In the industry sector solar 
collectors, geothermal energy (incl. heat pumps), and electricity 
from renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil
fuel-fired systems. A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the 
remaining conventional applications leads to a further reduction 
of CO 2emissions.

10 ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
•Future investments in the heat sector : The Energy [R]evolution 
shows a major revision of current investment strategies in heating 
technologies is needed. Especially solar and heat pump 
technologies need enormous increase in installations, if these 
potentials are to be tapped for the heat sector. Total installed 
capacity needs to increase by the factor of 70 for solar thermal
and by the factor of more than 400 for heat pumps. Capacity of
biomass technologies will be lower than in the Reference case but
remains a main pillar of heat supply. Renewable heating 
technologies are extremely variable, from low tech biomass stoves 
and unglazed solar collectors to very sophisticated enhanced 
geothermal systems and solar thermal district heating plants with 
seasonal storage. Thus it can only roughly be calculated, that the 
Energy [R]evolution scenario in total requires more than 
US$ 4,300 billion to be invested in renewable heating 
technologies until 2050 (including investments for replacement
after the economic lifetime of the plants) - approximately 
US$ 108 billion per year.
•Future employment in the energy sector: Energy sector jobs in 
USA are higher in the Energy [R]evolution scenario at every 
stage in the projection. In 2015, extremely strong growth in 
renewable energy in the Energy [R]evolution scenario meant
overall energy employment increased by 665,300 (61%), while 
jobs in the Reference scenario remain static. Jobs in the Energy 
[R]evolution drop between 2020 and 2030, but remain 414,000 
above 2010 levels. Jobs in the Reference scenario are just
27,000 above 2010 levels by 2030. Jobs in the Reference 
scenario remain relatively contstant over the entire period. In the 
Energy [R]evolution scenario, energy sector jobs double by 2015,
with 0.7 million additional jobs. Jobs drop between 2015 and 
2030, but despite this are 38% above 2010 levels. Renewable 
energy accounts for 61% of energy jobs by 2030, with solar heat
having the greatest share (18%), followed by geothermal and 
heat pump heat and wind. 
•Transport: A key target in the USA is to introduce incentives for 
people to drive smaller cars, something almost completely absent
today. In addition, it is vital to shift transport use to efficient
modes like rail, light rail and buses, especially in the expanding 
large metropolitan areas. Together with rising prices for fossil
fuels, these changes reduce the huge car sales projected under the 
Reference scenario. Energy demand from the transport sector is 
reduced by around 18,700 Trillion BTU/a in 2050 (saving 71%) 
compared to the Reference scenario. Energy demand in the 
transport sector will therefore decrease between 2011 and 2050 
by 71% to 7,480 Trillion BTU/a. Highly efficient propulsion 
technology with hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery-electric power 
trains will bring large efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will
provide 12% of the transport sector’s total energy demand in the 
Energy [R]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 39%.•Primary energy consumption : Compared to the Reference 
scenario, overall primary energy demand will be reduced by 46% 
in 2050. Around 87% of the remaining demand will be covered 
by renewable energy sources. The Energy [R]evolution version 
aims to phase out coal and oil as fast as technically and 
economically possible. This is made possible mainly by 
replacement of coal power plants with renewables and a fast
introduction of very efficient electric vehicles in the transport
sector to replace oil combustion engines. This leads to an overall
renewable primary energy share of 42% in 2030 and 87% in 
2050. Nuclear energy is phased out just after 2035.
•Development of CO 2emissions : Whilst USA’s emissions of CO 2will
increase by 4% between 2011 and 2050 under the Reference 
scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution scenario they will
decrease from 5,420 million tonnes in 2011 to 
188 million tonnes in 2050 Annual per capita emissions will drop 
from 17.1 tonnes to 0.5 tonnes. In spite of the phasing out of
nuclear energy and increasing demand, CO 2emissions will
decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains 
and the increased use of renewable energy in vehicles will reduce 
emissions in the transport sector. With a share of 45% of CO 2, the 
transport sector will be the largest remaining source of emissions 
in 2050. By 2025, USA’s CO 2emissions are 27% below 1990 
levels, by 2030 the reduction is 48%, while by 2050 the total
energy related CO 2reduction reaches 96%. 
policy changes 
To make the Energy [R]evolution real and to avoid dangerous 
climate change, Greenpeace and GWEC demand that the following 
policies and actions are implemented in the energy sector:
1.Abolish all subsidies, including any policies which confer a 
financial benefit, to fossil fuels and nuclear energy.
2.Internalize the currently socialized cost of industrial climate 
pollution, such as through a federal carbon fee.
3.Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming 
appliances, buildings and vehicles.
4.Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and 
combined heat and power generation.
5.Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access 
to the grid for renewable power generators.
6.Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example by 
feed-in tariff schemes.
7.Implement better labeling and disclosure mechanisms to 
provide more environmental product information.
8.Increase research and development budgets for renewable 
energy and energy efficiency.

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY 
FROM FIRST SPEECH AS SECRETARY 
OF STATE 21 FEBRUARY 2013 

If we do not take urgent and immediate action to protect the climate,
the threats from climate change could become irreversible. 
The goal of climate policy should be to keep the global mean 
temperature rise to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. We 
have very little time within which we can change our energy system 
to meet these targets. This means that global emissions will have to 
peak and start to decline by the end of the next decade at the latest.
The only way forwards is a rapid reduction in the emission of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
1.1 the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC)
In recognition of the global threats of climate change, world 
governments negotiated the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, committing to preventing 
dangerous climate change. Five years later the convention was 
strengthened with a Kyoto Protocol that included binding emission 
caps for industrialized countries.
In Copenhagen 2009, members of the UNFCCC were expected to 
arrive at a new binding agreement with new emission reduction 
commitments. Unfortunately, these expectations were not met.
Countries did, however, announce voluntary emission reduction 
pledges for 2020.
An evaluation of the climate pledges for 2020 by the United 
Nations Environment Program (UNEP) shows that the targets are 
woefully inadequate to keep temperature increase below 
catastrophic warming of 2°C or more – a target governments have 
committed to. Instead the targets put us on a path towards 2.5°C 
to 5°C warming, which would have devastating consequences for 
humanity.2
In 2012 governments decided to give it another try, and to 
negotiate a new comprehensive climate agreement by 2015. This is 
our chance to get it right and learn from past mistakes. The new 
agreement must ensure broad participation of all major emitters,
apply a fair sharing of effort, provide finance and support for the 
vulnerable and catalyse faster emission cuts before 2020 and 
beyond, so that warming can be kept as far below 2°C as possible.
12 1climate & energy policy |THE UNFCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL & INTERNATIONAL ENERGY POLICY 
This means that the new agreement in 2015, with the Fifth 
Assessment Report of the IPCC on its heels, should strive for 
climate action for 2020 that ensures that the world stay as far 
below an average temperature increase of 2°C as possible. Such an 
agreement will need to ensure:
•Industrialized countries increase the ambition of their 2020 targets 
adopted in Cancun, to close the gap between current commitments 
and what science demands for avoiding surpassing 2°C.
•Developed countries capitalize the Green Climate Fund, making good 
on their agreement to provide $100 billion per year, and work hard 
at home to generate political support for significantly more finance 
to help developing countries adapt to climate impacts, protect their 
forests and be part of the energy revolution.
•Developed and developing countries alike announce ambitious 
post-2020 commitments (i.e., 2025) as soon as possible, with the 
intention they be enshrined in a 2015 Paris Treaty that is 
internationally legally binding.
1.2 international energy policy 
At present there is a distortion in many energy markets, where 
renewable energy generators have to compete with old nuclear and 
fossil fuel power stations but not on a level playing field. This is 
because consumers and taxpayers have already paid the interest
and depreciation on the original investments so the generators are 
running at a marginal cost. Political action is needed to overcome 
market distortions so renewable energy technologies can compete 
on their own merits.
While governments around the world are liberalizing their electricity 
markets, the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy should 
lead to higher demand. Without political support, however, renewable 
energy remains at a disadvantage, marginalized because there has 
been decades of massive financial, political and structural support to 
conventional technologies. Developing renewables will therefore 
require strong political and economic efforts for example, through 
laws that guarantee stable tariffs over a period of up to 20 years.
Renewable energy will also contribute to sustainable economic 
growth, high quality jobs, technology development, global
competitiveness and industrial and research leadership.ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

13 1.3 USA climate protection and energy policy 
Janet L. Sawin, Ph.D., Sunna Research, 
with additions from Kyle Ash, Greenpeace USA 
1.3.1 federal policies 
In June of 2013, President Obama gave a climate speech at
Georgetown University where he announced a ‘climate plan’. Obama 
announcing a climate plan came with the realization that action by 
Congress seems a lost cause for the rest of his presidency. Climate 
denialism remains the position of the Republican Party, which 
controls the House of Representatives. Obama’s climate and energy 
policies achieve little in terms of what is needed from the US on 
climate pollution reduction, and much of the policies in Obama’s 
plan were already announced or implemented. However, several
policies are very good steps toward scaling up renewable energy.
One goal that was already achieved upon announcement of the 
Obama climate plan was permitting enough renewables on public 
lands by 2020 to power more than 6 million homes. According to 
the Bureau of Land Management, 7.8 GW of capacity in wind,
solar, and geothermal has been approved. Obama’s plan expanded a 
program to encourage efficiency in commercial, industrial, and 
multi-family buildings, with the goal that buildings be 20 percent
more energy efficient by 2020. The Obama administration also 
strengthened a goal for itself, aiming to increase the electricity it
uses from renewables to 20% by 2020. The federal government is 
the largest energy consumer.
The Obama administration has also implemented, proposed, or 
announced plans for policies to deal with climate pollution from the 
transportation and electricity sector. Even if these policies do not
achieve sufficient mitigation, they do encourage renewables. The 
pollution restrictions applying to passenger vehicles made from 
2017 may already be helping to encourage electric vehicle 
production, marketing and development. Pollution limits on future 
power plants were supposed to be already finalized and 
promulgated, which has been delayed repeatedly. The limits on 
future plants would obviously have no impact with respect to 
current emissions, whereas no one knows what EPA may propose 
for limits on existing plants. Obama’s climate plan aims to finalize 
standards for future plants by 2014, and for existing plants by 
2015. Implementation of these standards would be phased in under 
the next President. Despite the feeble effort by Obama to deal with 
coal, the threat that the utility sector regulations may force some 
internalization of climate pollution costs does not stand on its own.
President Obama also continues to call for the elimination of fossil
fuel subsidies, reflected in his budget proposal, although a policy 
objective also dependent on assent from Congress. The 2009 Federal Stimulus Package 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA),
designed to stimulate the national economy, provided several billion 
dollars for renewable energy and energy efficiency, and allocated about
$3.5 billion for smart-grid investments. One significant aspect of the 
stimulus was the provision for a cash grant in place of the federal
production tax credit (for wind, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass) 
and the investment tax credit (mostly solar and small wind projects).
This was important because prior to ARRA developers had difficulty 
securing financing against potential tax equity. ARRA provided the 
certainty needed to get projects going again, meaning that construction 
moved forward on many projects that otherwise would have remained 
dormant. While the ARRA funds continued to be available for qualified 
projects that began construction before the end of 2011, the cash grant
expired at the end of that year.
Renewable Electricity 
Aside from targets in the Obama climate plan that address energy 
demand of the federal government and energy production on public 
lands, no standards or official targets exist at the national level.
The Investment Tax Credit (particularly important for solar) has been 
extended through 2016; in 2017 it reverts from the current 30% 
back to its original level of 10%. The Production Tax Credit, which 
has been important for driving investment in wind power in particular,
was extended through 2012 under ARRA. As of early December, it
was expected to expire at year’s end for wind power, but to continue 
through 2013 for other technologies covered by the program.
Renewable Heating/Cooling 
No policies specific to renewable heating/cooling exist at the 
national level, although investment tax credits are available for 
relevant technologies.

Renewable Transport 
Aside from vehicle emissions rules encouraging low-emissions 
technology or electric vehicles, federal regulation related to 
renewable transport is directed at biofuels.
Several federal incentives for biofuels expired at the end of 2011.
The national volumetric ethanol excise tax credit (VEETC) of
$0.45 per gallon of pure ethanol, which was first introduced in the 
1980s, was allowed to expire. In addition, the U.S. import tariff
was eliminated at year’s end. However, the U.S. Renewable Fuel
Standard (RFS) remains in place. It is an ethanol blending 
mandate that requires 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel to be 
blended annually with transport fuel by 2022, with annual
increases in the interim; over time the standard requires a rising 
share of advanced biofuels. The Environmental Protection Agency 
sets annual minimum volume requirements under the RFS – see 
Table 1 for the final volumes for 2012. The equivalent shares of
fuel volume are 9.23% total renewable fuel, 1.21% advanced 
biofuel, 0.91% biodiesel, and 0.006% cellulosic biofuel. For 2013,
the biomass-based diesel blend volume has been increased to 1.3 
billion gallons.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development oversees 
an Advanced Biofuel Payment Program that provides payments to 
eligible biofuel producers to expand production of advanced biofuels 
refined from non-corn sources. Under the same department, the 
Repowering Assistance Program encourages the replacement of
fossil fuels with renewable biomass to provide process heat or 
power in the operation of eligible biorefineries.1.3.2 state policies 
States continue to lead in implementing policies to advance 
renewable energy, with a variety of policies in use in all end-use 
sectors—power, heating and cooling, and transportation. However,
the rate of new policy enactment has slowed and some incentives 
have been reduced in recent years due to a combination of factors 
including the economic slump and falling renewable energy costs.
General Incentives and Financing 
Public Benefit Funds As of November 2012, 18 states plus 
Washington DC and Puerto Rico had public benefit funds to 
support renewable energy and energy efficiency. Funds totaled an 
estimated $7.8 billion by 2017. One example is Oregon, where the 
budget for renewables (and amount used) in 2012 was $14.2 
million; other states include Vermont ($3 million used in FY 2012,
though the payment for 2013 is expected to decline significantly) 
and Wisconsin (which increased its budget for 2012 from $7.6 
million to $10 million). Note, however, that in some states the funds 
can be taken for purposes unrelated to renewable energy 
development. 
In 2011 there were more state-funded clean energy projects 
(32,734) that in any previous year, representing an 18% increase 
over 2010 and a near doubling of projects relative to 2009.
PACE financing Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing is 
a growing trend. PACE programs allow low-interest funding of
renewable energy installations by property owners, usually to be 
repaid through additional property tax assessments. At last count, the 
laws of 28 states plus Washington DC allowed local governments to 
form PACE programs to facilitate and encourage renewable energy 
installations in their municipalities (Hawaii permits it based on 
existing law and 27 states have passed legislation). The latest
additions include New Jersey (2012), Wyoming and Connecticut
(both 2011). In 2012, Connecticut passed legislation enabling PACE 
financing for commercial properties. 
Note, however, that in July 2010, the Federal Housing Financing 
Agency issued a statement regarding lien status associated with 
most PACE programs; as a result, most local programs have been 
suspended awaiting further clarification.
Investment Incentives At least 30 states and Washington D.C. have 
some sort of financial incentive to support renewable energy, and 
many of these also had incentives supported by utilities, non-profits 
or local governments. 
As of October 2012, 16 states and 2 U.S. territories (Puerto Rico 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands) had grant programs in place to support
renewable energy. Several of these states also had grant programs 
at the utility, local levels or in the private sector, and another six 
states had utility, local or private only (not state-level) grant
programs. At the same time, 37 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands 
had loan programs for renewable energy.

Other support programs in place by late 2012 include: 
•Rebate programs – 16 states plus Washington D.C., Puerto Rico 
and U.S. Virgin Islands. One of the most recent rebates to become 
available (September 2012) was a biomass/clean-burning wood 
stove rebate program in Maryland. Connecticut’s Residential Solar 
Investment Program (stemming from legislation enacted in 2011) 
provides a rebate for systems up to 10 kW and offers a 
performance-based incentive over 6 years for third-party-owned 
systems. In addition, about 17 states have utility, local or non-
profit programs but no state-level rebate programs.
•Property tax incentives: 38 states and Puerto Rico 
•Sales tax incentives: 27 states plus Puerto Rico 
•Tax credits: 24 states (most offer both personal and corporate 
tax credits, while some offer only one or the other).
Most of these cover solar energy (particularly solar PV, but also 
solar thermal heat) while many include other RE technologies 
ranging from wind power to biomass heat and geothermal heat
pumps. New York state has an aerobic digester gas to electricity 
rebate and performance incentive with a $57 million budget for 
2011-2015.
Several states also have financial programs to support energy 
efficiency improvements, with some programs applying to both 
renewable energy and energy efficiency (particularly related to 
green buildings).
Renewable Electricity 
Renewable Portfolio Standards After several years of state-level
expansion of Renewable Portfolio Standards—with states enacting 
new policies or expanding targets and creating carve-outs for solar— 
no states added new RPS laws in 2011 or 2012. However, in 2011 
at least three states revised existing mandates. California revised its 
existing mandate from 20% by 2010 to 20% by 2013, 25% by 
2016, and 33% by 2020. New Jersey reduced the solar carve-out
under its existing RPS, and Illinois added a requirement for 
distributed generation. In addition, Indiana established a voluntary 
goal of 4% electricity from renewables by 2013 and 10% by 2025.
During 2012, legislators attempted to repeal or weaken Renewable 
Portfolio Standards (RPS) in several states, although most such 
efforts failed to pass. By late October, three states had weakened 
their laws or rendered them irrelevant to renewables. In Ohio, a new 
law allowed anything that is a “new, retrofitted, refueled, or 
repowered generating facility” to qualify for the state RPS, while 
adding certain combined heat and power facilities and waste heat
recovery systems to the renewable energy portion of the standard.
The renewables portion of Ohio’s mandate was reduced to 12.5% 
by 2025. In New Hampshire, the list of eligible resources was 
expanded and the solar electric carve-out was weakened. Virginia 
allowed research and development to meet 20% of the state’s 
renewable energy target.On the positive front, other states proposed new RPS laws during 
2012 or considered converting non-binding goals to standards.
Both Maryland and New Jersey made revisions to existing laws,
with New Jersey addressing the oversupply of renewable energy 
credits and accelerating its solar carve-out. Maryland also 
accelerated its solar carve-out and advanced the 2% requirement
for solar from 2022 to 2020.
As of November 2012, 29 U.S. states plus Washington DC and 2 
territories had RPS laws, while 8 states and 2 territories had 
renewable portfolio (non-binding) goals. Most of these had final
target dates in the 2020-2025 period; share targets range from a 
low of 10% in Indiana (by 2025), Michigan and Wisconsin (both 
by 2015) to a high of 40% in Hawaii (by 2030), with several
states in the 15-25% range. At least two states have set capacity 
quotas rather than shares: Texas 5,880 MW by 2015 (with a non-
wind goal of 500 MW), and Iowa 105 MW. Of the 29 states with 
binding quotas, 16 states plus Washington DC had RPS laws that
included provisions for solar and/or distributed generation, with 
specific targets for solar and/or distributed generation, and/or 
multipliers for them. Delaware has one of the most aggressive solar 
carve-outs, mandating 3.5% solar PV by 2026.
Although more than half of U.S. states have RPS laws, their targets 
no longer challenge the industries’ (particularly wind and solar power) 
capabilities, which have rapidly moved ahead of policy requirements.
According to data from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,
state mandates call for the equivalent of about 6 GW of incremental
additions from the 2012-2020 period. This compares with the 5-10 
GW of wind capacity added each year between 2009 and 2012. On 
the solar front the situation is similar. New Jersey’s mandate enacted 
in July 2012, for example, calls for utilities to procure about 300 MW 
of new solar power assets through 2020, yet solar installations in the 
state reached 275 MW in the first half of 2012. 
Feed-in Tariffs Some state and local (see below) governments have 
developed Feed-in Tariff (FIT) policies. In 2011, Rhode Island 
became the 5th U.S. state to implement a FIT, joining Vermont,
Oregon, Hawaii and California. The Hawaiian FIT was revised during 
2011 to include solar projects of 500 kW-5 MW scale, and wind 
projects of 100 kW-5 MW. Oregon also adjusted its FIT rates in 
2011, reducing its solar payment option tariff for on-site generation.3
Net Metering As of November 2012, 43 states plus Washington DC 
and four U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, US 
Virgin Islands) had adopted net metering policies. Most policies 
apply only to certain utility types (for example, investor-owned 
utilities), and most states have established capacity limits; however,
at least 3 states (New Jersey, Ohio and Arizona) have no capacity 
limit in place. In addition, three states with no state level policy 
have voluntary utility programs.

RENEWABLE ENERGY ENGINES?’ RENEWABLE ENERGY WORLD, 14 NOVEMBER 2012.

As of August 2012, more than 180,000 net-metered renewable 
energy systems had been installed in the United States. One of the 
most significant developments during the year was a ruling by the 
California Public Utilities Commission regarding how the state’s net
metering cap should be calculated. The decision was projected to 
result in a near-doubling of net metering capacity available in the 
state, expanding the aggregate cap to more than 5 GW.4
It is important to note, however, that utility opposition to net
metering is on the rise in some states, particularly those with 
significant distributed solar PV capacity, such as California. Under 
their current business models and rate structures, some utilities have 
argued that net metering is affecting their bottom line.
Green Power Purchasing Eight U.S. states (Colorado, Iowa, Maine,
Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Virginia and Washington) mandate 
electric utilities to offer voluntary green power options for their 
customers. These laws were enacted in the last decade (2000-2009 
timeframe), with Maine’s being the most recent (2009).
Renewable Heating and Cooling 
A number of states now have incentives specifically targeting 
renewable heating, particularly solar water heating and geothermal
heat pumps. In June 2008, Hawaii was the first state to enact
renewable heating mandates, requiring that all new homes be 
outfitted with solar water heating systems. As of 1 January 2010,
the law prohibits the issuing of building permits for single-family 
homes that do not have solar water heaters. 
There also appears to be a growing interest in incorporating thermal
energy sources into state RPS policy, which could help to promote 
investment in these technologies (although it could also negatively 
affect the economic viability of solar electric projects). In as many as 
14 states, some type of thermal renewable energy now qualifies to 
meet at least a portion of RPS targets.5In 2012, New Hampshire 
became the first state to adopt a thermal renewable energy carve out,
requiring that a portion of the RPS mandate be met with thermal
energy. The law covers solar water/space heating, geothermal heat
pumps and biomass systems that begin operation after 1 January 
2013, and allocates the energy equivalent of 0.2% of the 2013 total
electric load to renewable heat, increasing by that amount annual to a 
share of 2.6% by 2025. Also in 2012, Maryland created a thermal
carve out in its RPS for solar water heating, geothermal heating and 
cooling, and biomass (systems primarily using animal waste) heating. Renewable Transport 
Several U.S. states have biofuel mandates in place. These include 
Missouri and Montana, which both require E10 (a blend of 10% 
ethanol and 90% gasoline), as well as Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington 
state. Many of the state blend requirements increase over time.
Iowa’s E10 mandate was no longer in force as of early 2012.
State Highlight 
In December 2011, the state of Vermont implemented a 
Comprehensive Energy Plan, which sets out a framework for 
achieving the goal of 90% of the state’s energy from renewable 
sources by 2050. The plan focuses on all end-use sectors, including 
better implantation of renewable energy technologies in the heating 
and transport sectors.
1.3.3 city and local policies 
Thousands of city and local governments around the world have put
in place policies, targets or plans to advance renewable energy and 
energy efficiency, and many of these are in the United States. For 
example, A growing number of U.S. cities have also enacted FITs,
including Los Angeles and Sacramento in California, and Gainesville 
in Florida, which passed a FIT program in 2011 after the city’s 
Assistant General Manager Ed Regan visited Germany to evaluate 
their FIT model up close. The Long Island Power Authority unveiled 
a new feed-in tariff program that offered 20-year contracts to 
projects of 50 kW - 20 MW in size, with an aggregate cap of 50 
MW; the queue for applications opened in July 2012.
Other developments include the following: Ithaca in New York 
switched to renewable electricity in late 2011 and planned to 
produce 100% renewable electricity for all of the city’s consumers 
starting in 2012. In late 2011 or early 2012, the city of Austin,
Texas became the largest local U.S. government using 100% 
renewable energy. San Francisco has established a public utility to 
provide the city with 100% renewable electricity by 2020, and 
Cincinnati, Ohio, has developed a power aggregation deal to provide 
100% renewable electricity to all customers. Cities have also 
adopted policies and programs to transform their buildings and 
transportation systems. For example, St. Paul in Minnesota started 
a program in 2011 that began providing solar district heat to 80% 
of its downtown. Chicago and New York City have built solar-
powered charging systems to encourage use of electric vehicles that
can run on renewable electricity. As of October 1, 2012, New York 
City mandates the use of 2% biodiesel in all oil heat to be used in 
the city (although this was temporarily suspended following “super 
storm” Sandy and not in effect as of early December).

19 2the energy [r]evolution concept |KEY PRINCIPLES 
The expert consensus is that a fundamental shift in the way we 
consume and generate energy must begin immediately and be well
underway within the next ten years in order to avert the worst
impacts of climate change.6The scale of the challenge requires a 
complete transformation of the way we produce, consume and 
distribute energy, while maintaining economic growth. Nothing short
of such a revolution will enable us to limit global warming to a rise 
in temperature of lower than 2°C, above which the impacts become 
devastating. This chapter explains the basic principles and strategic 
approach of the Energy [R]evolution concept, which have formed 
the basis for the scenario modelling since the very first Energy 
[R]evolution scenario published in 2005. However, this concept has 
been constantly improved as technologies develop and new technical
and economical possibilities emerge. 
Current electricity generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels in 
very large power stations which generate carbon dioxide and also 
waste much of their primary input energy. More energy is lost as the 
power is moved around the electricity network and is converted from 
high transmission voltage down to a supply suitable for domestic or 
commercial consumers. The system is vulnerable to disruption:
localized technical, weather-related or even deliberately caused faults 
can quickly cascade, resulting in widespread blackouts. Whichever 
technology generates the electricity within this old fashioned 
configuration, it will inevitably be subject to some, or all, of these 
problems. At the core of the Energy [R]evolution therefore there are 
changes both to the way that energy is produced and distributed. 
2.1 key principles 
The Energy [R]evolution can be achieved by adhering 
to five key principles:
1.Respect natural limits – phase out fossil fuels by the end of this 
century We must learn to respect natural limits. There is only so 
much carbon that the atmosphere can absorb. Each year we emit
almost 30 billion tonnes of carbon equivalent; we are literally filling 
up the sky. Geological resources of coal could provide several
hundred years of fuel, but we cannot burn them and keep within safe 
limits. Oil and coal development must be ended. 
The global Energy [R]evolution scenario has a target to reduce 
energy related CO 2emissions to a maximum of 3.5 Gigatonnes 
(Gt) by 2050 and phase out over 80% of fossil fuels by 2050.
2.Equity and fair access to energy As long as there are natural limits 
there needs to be a fair distribution of benefits and costs within 
societies, between nations and between present and future 
generations. At one extreme, a third of the world’s population has 
no access to electricity, whilst the most industrialized countries 
consume much more than their fair share.
The effects of climate change on the poorest communities are 
exacerbated by massive global energy inequality. If we are to 
address climate change, one of the principles must be equity and fairness, so that the benefits of energy services – such as light,
heat, power and transport – are available for all: north and 
south, rich and poor. Only in this way can we create true energy 
security, as well as the conditions for genuine human wellbeing.
The global Energy [R]evolution scenario has a target to 
achieve energy equity as soon as technically possible. By 2050 
the average annual per capita emission should be between 0.5 
and 1 tonne of CO 2. 
3.Implement clean, renewable solutions and decentralize energy 
systems There is no energy shortage. All we need to do is use 
existing technologies to harness energy effectively and 
efficiently. Renewable energy and energy efficiency measures 
are ready, viable and increasingly competitive. Wind, solar and 
other renewable energy technologies have experienced double 
digit market growth for the past decade.7
Just as climate change is real, so is the renewable energy sector.
Sustainable, decentralized energy systems produce fewer carbon 
emissions, are cheaper and are less dependent on imported fuel.
They create more jobs and empower local communities.
Decentralized systems are more secure and more efficient. This is 
what the Energy [R]evolution must aim to create.
To stop the earth’s climate spinning out of control, most of the 
world’s fossil fuel reserves – coal, oil and gas – must remain in 
the ground. Our goal is for humans to live within the natural
limits of our small planet. 
4.Decouple growth from fossil fuel use Starting in the developed 
countries, economic growth must be fully decoupled from fossil
fuel usage. It is a fallacy to suggest that economic growth must
be predicated on their increased combustion.
We need to use the energy we produce much more efficiently,
and we need to make the transition to renewable energy and 
away from fossil fuels quickly in order to enable clean and 
sustainable growth.
5.Phase out dirty, unsustainable energy We need to phase out coal
and nuclear power. We cannot continue to build coal plants at a 
time when emissions pose a real and present danger to both 
ecosystems and people. And we cannot continue to fuel the 
myriad nuclear threats by pretending nuclear power can in any 
way help to combat climate change. There is no role for nuclear 
power in the Energy [R]evolution.“THE STONE AGE DID NOT END FOR LACK OF STONE, AND THE OIL 
AGE WILL END LONG BEFORE THE WORLD RUNS OUT OF OIL.”

2.2 the “3 step implementation” 
In 2009, renewable energy sources accounted for 13% of the 
world’s primary energy demand. Biomass, which is mostly used for 
heating, was the main renewable energy source. The share of
renewable energy in electricity generation was 18%. About 81% of
primary energy supply today still comes from fossil fuels.8
Now is the time to make substantial structural changes in the energy 
and power sector within the next decade. Many power plants in 
industrialized countries, such as the USA, Japan and the European 
Union, are nearing retirement; more than half of all operating power 
plants are over 20 years old. At the same time developing countries,
such as China, India, South Africa and Brazil, are looking to satisfy the 
growing energy demand created by their expanding economies.
Within this decade, the power sector will decide how new electricity 
demand will be met, either by fossil and nuclear fuels or by the efficient
use of renewable energy. The Energy [R]evolution scenario puts forward 
a policy and technical model for renewable energy and cogeneration 
combined with energy efficiency to meet the world’s needs.
Both renewable energy and cogeneration on a large scale and 
through decentralized, smaller units – have to grow faster than 
overall global energy demand. Both approaches must replace old 
generating technologies and deliver the additional energy required 
in the developing world. 
A transition phase is required to build up the necessary infrastructure 
because it is not possible to switch directly from a large scale fossil
and nuclear fuel based energy system to a full renewable energy 
supply. Whilst remaining firmly committed to the promotion of
renewable sources of energy, we appreciate that conventional natural
gas, used in appropriately scaled cogeneration plants, is valuable as a 
transition fuel, and can also drive cost-effective decentralization of the 
energy infrastructure. With warmer summers, tri-generation which incorporates heat-fired absorption chillers to deliver cooling capacity 
in addition to heat and power, will become a valuable means of
achieving emissions reductions. The Energy [R]evolution envisages a 
development pathway which turns the present energy supply structure 
into a sustainable system. There are three main stages to this.
Step 1:energy efficiency and equity The Energy [R]evolution 
makes an ambitious exploitation of the potential for energy 
efficiency. It focuses on current best practice and technologies that
will become available in the future, assuming continuous innovation.
The energy savings are fairly equally distributed over the three 
sectors – industry, transport and domestic/business. Intelligent use,
not abstinence, is the basic philosophy. 
The most important energy saving options are improved heat insulation 
and building design, super efficient electrical machines and drives,
replacement of old-style electrical heating systems by renewable heat
production (such as solar collectors) and a reduction in energy 
consumption by vehicles used for goods and passenger traffic.
Industrialized countries currently use energy in the most inefficient way 
and can reduce their consumption drastically without the loss of either 
housing comfort or information and entertainment electronics. The 
global Energy [R]evolution scenario depends on energy saved in OECD 
countries to meet the increasing power requirements in developing 
countries. The ultimate goal is stabilization of global energy consumption 
within the next two decades. At the same time, the aim is to create 
‘energy equity’ – shifting towards a fairer worldwide distribution of
efficiently-used supply.
A dramatic reduction in primary energy demand compared to the 
Reference scenario – but with the same GDP and population 
development – is a crucial prerequisite for achieving a significant
share of renewable energy sources in the overall energy supply 
system, compensating for the phasing out of nuclear energy and 
reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

Step 2:the renewable energy [r]evolution Decentralized energy and 
large scale renewables In order to achieve higher fuel efficiencies and 
reduce distribution losses, the Energy [R]evolution scenario makes 
extensive use of Decentralized Energy (DE).This term refers to 
energy generated at or near the point of use.
Decentralized energy is connected to a local distribution network 
system, supplying homes and offices, rather than the high voltage 
transmission system. Because electricity generation is closer to 
consumers, any waste heat from combustion processes can be piped 
to nearby buildings, a system known as cogeneration or combined 
heat and power. This means that for a fuel like gas, all the input
energy is used, not just a fraction as with traditional centralized 
fossil fuel electricity plant. 
Decentralized energy also includes stand-alone systems entirely 
separate from the public networks, for example heat pumps, solar 
thermal panels or biomass heating. These can all be commercialized 
for domestic users to provide sustainable, low emission heating.
Some consider decentralized energy technologies ‘disruptive’
because they do not fit the existing electricity market and system.
However, with appropriate changes they can grow exponentially 
with overall benefit and diversification for the energy sector.A huge proportion of global energy in 2050 will be produced by 
decentralized energy sources, although large scale renewable energy 
supply will still be needed for an energy revolution. Large offshore 
wind farms and concentrating solar power (CSP) plants in the 
sunbelt regions of the world will therefore have an important role 
to play.
Cogeneration (CHP) The increased use of combined heat and power 
generation (CHP) will improve the supply system’s energy 
conversion efficiency, whether using natural gas or biomass. In the 
longer term, a decreasing demand for heat and the large potential
for producing heat directly from renewable energy sources will limit
the need for further expansion of CHP. 
Renewable electricity The electricity sector will be the pioneer of
renewable energy utilization. Many renewable electricity 
technologies have been experiencing steady growth over the past 20 
to 30 years of up to 35% annually and are expected to consolidate 
at a high level between 2030 and 2050. By 2050, under the Energy 
[R]evolution scenario, the majority of electricity will be produced 
from renewable energy sources. The anticipated growth of
electricity use in transport will further promote the effective use of
renewable power generation technologies.

INTEGRATED GENERATION. ENERGY SOLUTIONS COME FROM LOCAL OPPORTUNITIES AT BOTH A SMALL AND COMMUNITY SCALE. THE TOWN SHOWN HERE MAKES 
USE OF – AMONG OTHERS – WIND, BIOMASS AND HYDRO RESOURCES. NATURAL GAS, WHERE NEEDED, CAN BE DEPLOYED IN A HIGHLY EFFICIENT MANNER. 

Renewable heating In the heat supply sector, the contribution of
renewable energy will increase significantly. Growth rates are 
expected to be similar to those of the renewable electricity sector.
Fossil fuels will be increasingly replaced by more efficient modern 
technologies, in particular biomass, solar collectors and 
geothermal. By 2050, renewable energy technologies will satisfy the 
major part of heating and cooling demand.
Transport Before new technologies including hybrid and electric cars 
can seriously enter the transport sector, other electricity users need to 
make large efficiency gains. In this study, biomass is primarily 
committed to stationary applications; the use of biofuels for transport
is limited by the availability of sustainably grown biomass and only 
for heavy duty vehicles, ships and aviation. In contrast to previous 
versions of Energy [R]evolution scenarios, first generation biofuels 
are entirely banned now for use in private cars. Electric vehicles will
therefore play an even more important role in improving energy 
efficiency in transport and substituting for fossil fuels.
Overall, to achieve an economically attractive growth of renewable 
energy sources requires a balanced and timely mobilization of all
technologies. Such a mobilization depends on the resource 
availability, cost reduction potential and technological maturity.
When combined with technology-driven solutions, lifestyle changes -
like simply driving less and using more public transport – have a 
huge potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.New business modelThe Energy [R]evolution scenario will also 
result in a dramatic change in the business model of energy 
companies, utilities, fuel suppliers and the manufacturers of energy 
technologies. Decentralized energy generation and large solar or 
offshore wind arrays which operate in remote areas, without the 
need for any fuel, will have a profound impact on the way utilities 
operate in 2020 and beyond.
Today’s power supply value chain is broken down into clearly 
defined players but a global renewable power supply will inevitably 
change this division of roles and responsibilities. 
Table 2.1 provides an overview of how the value chain would 
change in a revolutionized energy mix.
The current model is a relatively small number of large power plants 
that are owned and operated by utilities or their subsidiaries,
generating electricity for the population. Under the Energy 
[R]evolution scenario, around 60 to 70% of electricity will be made 
by small but numerous decentralized power plants. Ownership will
shift towards more private investors, the manufacturer of renewable 
energy technologies and EPC companies (engineering, procurement
and construction) away from centralized utilities. In turn, the value 
chain for power companies will shift towards project development,
equipment manufacturing and operation and maintenance.ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

Simply selling electricity to customers will play a smaller role, as 
the power companies of the future will deliver a total power plant
and the required IT services to the customer, not just electricity.
They will therefore move towards becoming service suppliers for the 
customer. Moreover, the majority of power plants will not require 
any fuel supply, so mining and other fuel production companies will
lose their strategic importance.
The future pattern under the Energy [R]evolution will see more and 
more renewable energy companies, such as wind turbine 
manufacturers, becoming involved in project development,
installation and operation and maintenance, whilst utilities will lose 
their status. Those traditional energy supply companies which do 
not move towards renewable project development will either lose 
market share or drop out of the market completely.
Step 3: optimized integration – renewables 24/7 A complete 
transformation of the energy system will be necessary to 
accommodate the significantly higher shares of renewable energy 
expected under the Energy [R]evolution scenario. The grid network 
of cables and sub-stations that brings electricity to our homes and 
factories was designed for large, centralized generators running at
huge loads, providing ‘baseload’ power. Until now, renewable energy 
has been seen as an additional slice of the energy mix and had had 
adapt to the grid’s operating conditions. If the Energy [R]evolution 
scenario is to be realized, this will have to change.
Because renewable energy relies mostly on natural resources, which 
are not available at all times, some critics say this makes it
unsuitable for large portions of energy demand. Existing practice in 
a number of countries has already shown that this is false. 
Clever technologies can track and manage energy use patterns,
provide flexible power that follows demand through the day, use 
better storage options and group customers together to form 
‘virtual batteries’. With current and emerging solutions, we can 
secure the renewable energy future needed to avert catastrophic 
climate change. Renewable energy 24/7 is technically and 
economically possible, it just needs the right policy and the 
commercial investment to get things moving and ‘keep the lights 
on’.9Further adaptations to how the grid network operates will
allow integration of even larger quantities of renewable capacity.
Changes to the grid required to support decentralized energy Most
grids around the world have large power plants in the middle 
connected by high voltage alternating current (AC) power lines and 
smaller distribution network carries power to final consumers. The 
centralized grid model was designed and planned up to 60 years 
ago, and brought great benefit to cities and rural areas. However 
the system is very wasteful, with much energy lost in transition. A 
system based on renewable energy, requiring lots of smaller 
generators, some with variable amounts of power output will need a 
new architecture. The overall concept of a smart grid is one that balances fluctuations in 
energy demand and supply to share out power effectively among users.
New measures to manage demand, forecasting the weather for storage 
needs, plus advanced communication and control technologies will help 
deliver electricity effectively. 
Technological opportunities Changes to the power system by 2050 
will create huge business opportunities for the information,
communication and technology (ICT) sector. A smart grid has 
power supplied from a diverse range of sources and places and it
relies on the collection and analysis of a lot of data. Smart grids 
require software, hardware and data networks capable of delivering 
data quickly, and responding to the information that they contain.
Several important ICT players are racing to smarten up energy 
grids across the globe and hundreds of companies could be involved 
with smart grids.
There are numerous IT companies offering products and services to 
manage and monitor energy. These include IBM, Fujitsu, Google,
Microsoft and Cisco. These and other giants of the 
telecommunications and technology sector have the power to make 
the grid smarter, and to move us faster towards a clean energy 
future. Greenpeace has initiated the ‘Cool IT’ campaign to put
pressure on the IT sector to make such technologies a reality.
2.3 the new electricity grid 
In the future power generators will be smaller and distributed throughout
the grid, which is more efficient and avoids energy losses during long 
distance transmission. There will also be some concentrated supply from 
large renewable power plants. Examples of the large generators of the 
future are massive wind farms already being built in Europe’s North Sea 
and plans for large areas of concentrating solar mirrors to generate 
energy in Southern Europe. 
The challenge ahead will require an innovative power system 
architecture involving both new technologies and new ways of
managing the network to ensure a balance between fluctuations in 
energy demand and supply. The key elements of this new power 
system architecture are micro grids, smart grids and an efficient
large scale super grid. The three types of system will support and 
interconnect with each other (see Figure 2.3, page 26).

24 2the energy [r]evolution concept |THE NEW ELECTRICITY GRID 
2.3.1 hybrid systems 
While grid in the developed world supplies power to nearly 100% 
of the population, many rural areas in the developing world rely on 
unreliable grids or polluting electricity, for example from stand-
alone diesel generators. This is also very expensive for small
communities.
The standard approach of extending the grid used in developed 
countries is often not economic in rural areas of developing 
countries where potential electricity use is low and there are long 
distances to existing grid.
Electrification based on renewable energy systems with a hybrid mix of
sources is often the cheapest as well as the least polluting alternative.
Hybrid systems connect renewable energy sources such as wind and 
solar power to a battery via a charge controller, which stores the 
generated electricity and acts as the main power supply. Back-up supply 
typically comes from a fossil fuel, for example in a wind-battery-diesel
or PV-battery-diesel system. Such decentralized hybrid systems are 
more reliable, consumers can be involved in their operation through 
innovative technologies and they can make best use of local resources.They are also less dependent on large scale infrastructure and can be 
constructed and connected faster, especially in rural areas. 
Finance can often be an issue for relatively poor rural communities 
wanting to install such hybrid renewable systems. Greenpeace’s 
funding model, the Feed-in Tariff Support Mechanism (FTSM),
allows projects to be bundled together so the financial package is 
large enough to be eligible for international investment support. In 
the Pacific region, for example, power generation projects from a 
number of islands, an entire island state such as the Maldives or even 
several island states could be bundled into one project package. This 
would make it large enough for funding as an international project by 
OECD countries. In terms of project planning, it is essential that the 
communities themselves are directly involved in the process.
2.3.2 smart grids 
The task of integrating renewable energy technologies into existing power 
systems is similar in all power systems around the world, whether they 
are large centralized networks or island systems. The main aim of power 
system operation is to balance electricity consumption and generation. box 2.2: definitions and technical terms

infrastructure are embedded inside distribution networks and 
use local energy generation resources. An example of a 
microgrid would be a combination of solar panels, micro 
turbines, fuel cells, energy efficiency and information/
communication technology to manage the load, for example 
on an island or small rural town.
Smart grids balance demand out over a region.A ‘smart’
electricity grid connects decentralized renewable energy 
sources and co-generation and distributes power highly 
efficiently. Advanced types of control and management
technologies for the electricity grid can also make it run more 
efficiently overall. For example, smart electricity meters show 
real-time use and costs, allowing big energy users to switch off
or turn down on a signal from the grid operator, and avoid 
high power prices. 
Super grids transport large energy loads between regions. This 
refers to interconnection - typically based on HVDC 
technology - between countries or areas with large supply and 
large demand. An example would be the interconnection of all
the large renewable based power plants in the North Sea.
Baseload is the concept that there must be a minimum,
uninterruptible supply of power to the grid at all times,traditionally provided by coal or nuclear power. The Energy 
[R]evolution challenges this, and instead relies on a variety of
‘flexible’ energy sources combined over a large area to meet
demand. Currently, ‘baseload’ is part of the business model for 
nuclear and coal power plants, where the operator can produce 
electricity around the clock whether or not it is actually needed.
Constrained power refers to when there is a local oversupply of
free wind and solar power which has to be shut down, either 
because it cannot be transferred to other locations (bottlenecks) 
or because it is competing with inflexible nuclear or coal power 
that has been given priority access to the grid. Constrained power 
is available for thermal storage (e.g. for district heating) or, once 
the technology is available, for regeneration as electricity 
Variable power is electricity produced by wind or solar power 
depending on the weather. Some technologies can make 
variable power dispatchable, e.g. by adding heat storage to 
concentrated solar power.
Dispatchable is a type of power that can be stored and 
‘dispatched’ when needed to areas of high demand, e.g. gas-
fired power plants or hydro power plants.
Interconnector is a transmission line that connects different parts of
the electricity grid. Load curve is the typical pattern of electricity 
through the day, which has a predictable peak and trough that can 
be anticipated from outside temperatures and historical data.
Node is a point of connection in the electricity grid between 
regions or countries, where there can be local supply feeding 
into the grid as well.

Thorough forward planning is needed to ensure that the available 
production can match demand at all times. In addition to balancing 
supply and demand, the power system must also be able to:
•Fulfill defined power quality standards – voltage/frequency -
which may require additional technical equipment, and 
•Survive extreme situations such as sudden interruptions of supply,
for example from a fault at a generation unit or a breakdown in 
the transmission system. 
Integrating renewable energy by using a smart grid means moving 
away from the concept of baseload power towards a mix of flexible 
and dispatchable renewable power plants. In a smart grid, a 
portfolio of flexible energy providers can follow the load during both 
day and night (for example, solar plus gas, geothermal, wind and 
demand management) without blackouts. 
What is a smart grid? Until now, renewable power technology 
development has put most effort into adjusting its technical
performance to the needs of the existing network, mainly by 
complying with grid codes, which cover such issues as voltage 
frequency and reactive power. However, the time has come for the 
power systems themselves to better adjust to the needs of variable 
generation. This means that they must become flexible enough to 
follow the fluctuations of variable renewable power, for example by 
adjusting demand via demand-side management and/or deploying 
thermal or electrical storage systems.
The future power system will consist of tens of thousands of
generation units such as solar panels, wind turbines and other 
renewable generation, partly within the distribution network, partly 
concentrated in large power plants such as offshore wind parks. The 
power system planning will become more complex due to the larger 
number of generation assets and the significant share of variable 
power generation causing constantly changing power flows. 
Smart grid technology will be needed to support power system 
planning. This will operate by actively supporting day-ahead 
forecasts and system balancing, providing real-time information 
about the status of the network and the generation units, in 
combination with weather forecasts. It will also play a significant
role in making sure systems can meet the peak demand and make 
better use of distribution and transmission assets, thereby keeping 
the need for network extensions to the absolute minimum.
To develop a power system based almost entirely on renewable 
energy sources requires a completely new power system 
architecture, which will need substantial amounts of further work 
to fully emerge.10 Figure 2.3 shows a simplified graphic 
representation of the key elements in future renewable-based power 
systems using smart grid technology. 
A range of options are available to enable the large-scale 
integration of variable renewable energy resources into the power 
supply system. Some features of smart grids could be:Managing level and timing of demand for electricity. Changes to pricing 
schemes can give consumers financial incentives to reduce or shut off
their supply at periods of peak consumption, a system that is already 
used for some large industrial customers. A Norwegian power supplier 
even involves private household customers by sending them a text
message with a signal to shut down. Each household can decide in 
advance whether or not they want to participate. In Germany,
experiments are being conducted with time flexible tariffs so that
washing machines operate at night and refrigerators turn off
temporarily during periods of high demand. 
Advances in communications technology. In Italy, for example, 30 
million ‘smart meters’ have been installed to allow remote meter 
reading and control of consumer and service information. Many 
household electrical products or systems, such as refrigerators,
dishwashers, washing machines, storage heaters, water pumps and air 
conditioning, can be managed either by temporary shut-off or by 
rescheduling their time of operation, thus freeing up electricity load for 
other uses and dovetailing it with variations in renewable supply.
Creating Virtual Power Plants (VPP).Virtual power plants 
interconnect a range of real power plants (for example solar, wind 
and hydro) as well as storage options distributed in the power 
system using information technology. A real life example of a VPP is 
the Combined Renewable Energy Power Plant developed by three 
German companies.11 This system interconnects and controls 11 wind 
power plants, 20 solar power plants, four CHP plants based on 
biomass and a pumped storage unit, all geographically spread 
around Germany. The VPP monitors (and anticipates through 
weather forecasts) when the wind turbines and solar modules will be 
generating electricity. Biogas and pumped storage units are used to 
make up the difference, either delivering electricity as needed in 
order to balance short term fluctuations or temporarily storing it.12 
Together, the combination ensures sufficient electricity supply to 
cover demand. 
Electricity storage options.Pumped storage is the most established 
technology for storing energy from a type of hydroelectric power 
station. Water is pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a 
higher elevation during times of low cost, off-peak electricity.
During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is 
released through turbines. Taking into account evaporation losses 
from the exposed water surface and conversion losses, roughly 70 
to 85% of the electrical energy used to pump the water into the 
elevated reservoir can be regained when it is released. Pumped 
storage plants can also respond to changes in the power system 
load demand within seconds. Pumped storage has been successfully 
used for many decades all over the world. In 2007, the European 
Union had 38 GW of pumped storage capacity, representing 5% of
total electrical capacity.

Vehicle-to-Grid.Another way of ‘storing’ electricity is to use it to directly 
meet the demand from electric vehicles. The number of electric cars and 
trucks is expected to increase dramatically under the Energy 
[R]evolution scenario. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) concept, for example, is 
based on electric cars equipped with batteries that can be charged during 
times when there is surplus renewable generation and then discharged to 
supply peaking capacity or ancillary services to the power system while 
they are parked. During peak demand times cars are often parked close 
to main load centers, for instance outside factories, so there would be no 
network issues. Within the V2G concept a Virtual Power Plant would be 
built using ICT technology to aggregate the electric cars participating in 
the relevant electricity markets and to meter the charging/de-charging 
activities. In 2009, the EDISON demonstration project was launched to 
develop and test the infrastructure for integrating electric cars into the 
power system of the Danish island of Bornholm. 
2.3.3 the super grid 
Greenpeace simulation studies Renewables 24/7 (2010) and Battle 
of the Grids (2011) have shown that extreme situations with low 
solar radiation and little wind in many parts of Europe are not
frequent, but they can occur. The power system, even with massive 
amounts of renewable energy, must be adequately designed to cope 
with such an event. A key element in achieving this is through the 
construction of new onshore and offshore super grids. 
The Energy [R]evolution scenario assumes that about 70% of all
generation is distributed and located close to load centers. The 
remaining 30% will be large scale renewable generation such as 
large offshore wind farms or large arrays of concentrating solar 
power plants. A North Sea offshore super grid, for example, would 
enable the efficient integration of renewable energy into the power 
system across the whole North Sea region, linking the UK, France,
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. By 
aggregating power generation from wind farms spread across the 
whole area, periods of very low or very high power flows would be 
reduced to a negligible amount. A dip in wind power generation in 
one area would be balanced by higher production in another area,
even hundreds of kilometers away. Over a year, an installed offshore 
wind power capacity of 68.4 GW in the North Sea would be able to 
generate an estimated 247 TWh of electricity.13 
2.3.4 baseload blocks progress 
Generally, coal and nuclear plants run as so-called base load, meaning 
they work most of the time at maximum capacity regardless of how 
much electricity consumers need. When demand is low the power is 
wasted. When demand is high additional gas is needed as a backup. 
However, coal and nuclear cannot be turned down on windy days so 
wind turbines will get switched off to prevent overloading the system.
The recent global economic crisis triggered a drop in energy demand 
and revealed system conflict between inflexible base load power,
especially nuclear, and variable renewable sources, especially wind power, with wind operators told to shut off their generators. In 
Northern Spain and Germany, this uncomfortable mix is already 
exposing the limits of the grid capacity. If Europe continues to support
nuclear and coal power alongside a growth in renewables, clashes will
occur more and more, creating a bloated, inefficient grid. 
Despite the disadvantages stacked against renewable energy it has begun 
to challenge the profitability of older plants. After construction costs, a 
wind turbine is generating electricity almost for free and without burning 
any fuel. Meanwhile, coal and nuclear plants use expensive and highly 
polluting fuels. Even where nuclear plants are kept running and wind 
turbines are switched off, conventional energy providers are concerned.
Like any commodity, oversupply reduces prices across the market. In 
energy markets, this affects nuclear and coal too. We can expect more 
intense conflicts over access to the grids over the coming years.

14 BATTLE OF THE GRIDS, GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL, FEBRUARY 2011.box 2.3:do we need baseload power plants? 14 
Power from some renewable plants, such as wind and solar,
varies during the day and week. Some see this as an 
insurmountable problem, because up until now we have relied 
on coal or nuclear to provide a fixed amount of power at all
times. In current policy-making there is a struggle to determine 
which type of infrastructure or management we choose and 
which energy mix to favor as we move away from a polluting,
carbon intensive energy system. Some important facts include:
•electricity demand fluctuates in a predictable way.
•smart management can work with big electricity users, so 
their peak demand moves to a different part of the day,
evening out the load on the overall system.
•electricity from renewable sources can be stored and 
‘dispatched’ to where it is needed in a number of ways,
using advanced grid technologies.
Wind-rich countries in Europe are already experiencing conflict
between renewable and conventional power. In Spain, where a 
lot of wind and solar is now connected to the grid, gas power is 
stepping in to bridge the gap between demand and supply. This is 
because gas plants can be switched off or run at reduced power,
for example when there is low electricity demand or high wind 
production. As we move to a mostly renewable electricity sector,
gas plants will be needed as backup for times of high demand 
and low renewable production. Effectively, a kWh from a wind 
turbine displaces a kWh from a gas plant, avoiding carbon 
dioxide emissions. Renewable electricity sources such as thermal
solar plants (CSP), geothermal, hydro, biomass and biogas can 
gradually phase out the need for natural gas. (See Case Studies,
section 2.4 for more). The gas plants and pipelines would then 
progressively be converted for transporting biogas.

2the energy [r]evolution concept |THE NEW ELECTRICITY GRID 
One of the key conclusions from Greenpeace research is that in the 
coming decades, traditional power plants will have less and less 
space to run in baseload mode. With increasing penetration of
variable generation from wind and photovoltaic in the electricity 
grid, the remaining part of the system will have to run in more 
‘load following’ mode, filling the immediate gap between demand 
and production. This means the economics of base load plants like 
nuclear and coal will change fundamentally as more variable 
generation is introduced to the electricity grid. Option 3: Supply system with more than 25 percent fluctuating 
renewable energy – renewable energy priority 
•This approach adds renewables but gives priority to clean energy.
•If renewable energy is given priority to the grid, it “cuts into” the 
base load power. 
•Theoretically, nuclear and coal need to run at reduced capacity or be 
entirely turned off in peak supply times (very sunny or windy). 
•There are technical and safety limitations to the speed, scale 
and frequency of changes in power output for nuclear and coal-
CCS plants.

3scenarios for a future energy supply |SCENARIO BACKGROUND 
31 Moving from principles to action for energy supply that mitigates 
against climate change requires a long-term perspective. Energy 
infrastructure takes time to build up; new energy technologies take 
time to develop. Policy shifts often also need many years to take 
effect. In most world regions the transformation from fossil to 
renewable energies will require additional investment and higher 
supply costs over about twenty years. However, there will be 
tremendous economic benefits in the long term, due to much lower 
consumption of increasingly expensive, rare or imported fuels. Any 
analysis that seeks to tackle energy and environmental issues 
therefore needs to look ahead at least half a century. 
Scenarios are necessary to describe possible development paths, to 
give decision-makers a broad overview and indicate how far they 
can shape the future energy system. Two scenarios are used here to 
show the wide range of possible pathways in each world region for 
a future energy supply system: 
•Reference scenario , reflecting a continuation of current trends 
and policies.
•The Energy [R]evolution scenario , designed to achieve a set of
environmental policy targets. 
The global Reference scenario of the Energy [R]evolution 2012 was 
based on the Current Policies scenarios published by the International
Energy Agency (IEA) in World Energy Outlook 2011 (WEO 2011).15 
It only takes existing international energy and environmental policies 
into account. Its assumptions include, for example, continuing 
progress in electricity and gas market reforms, the liberalization of
cross-border energy trade and recent policies designed to combat
environmental pollution. The Reference scenario does not include 
additional policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Reference scenario for this updated US study is based on the 
Reference case of the Annual Energy Outlook 2013 (AEO2013),
prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). As 
the EIA’s projections only extend to 2040, they have been extended 
by extrapolating their key macroeconomic and energy indicators 
forward to 2050. This provides a baseline for comparison with the 
Energy [R]evolution scenario. The projections are based generally 
on federal, state, and local laws and regulations in effect as of the 
end of September 2012, the Reference case projection is defined as 
a business-as-usual trend estimate, given known technology and 
technological and demographic trends.
The global Energy [R]evolution scenario has a key target to reduce 
worldwide carbon dioxide emissions from energy use down to a level
of below 4 Gigatonnes per year by 2050 in order to hold the increase 
in average global temperature under +2°C. 
A second objective is the global phasing out of nuclear energy. The 
Energy [R]evolution scenarios published by Greenpeace in 2007,
2008 and 2010 included ‘basic’ and ‘advanced’ scenarios, the less 
ambitious target was for 10 Gigatonnes CO 2emissions per year by 
2050. However, the 2012 revision only focuses on the more ambitious 
“advanced” Energy [R]evolution scenario first published in 2010. This global carbon dioxide emission reduction target translates into 
a carbon budget for USA, which forms one of the key assumption 
for the Energy [R]evolution scenario. To achieve the target, the 
scenario includes significant efforts to fully exploit the large 
potential for energy efficiency, using currently available best
practice technology. At the same time, all cost-effective renewable 
energy sources are used for heat and electricity generation as well
as the production of biofuels. The general framework parameters 
for population and GDP growth remain unchanged from the 
Reference scenario.
Efficiency in use of electricity and fuels in industry and 
“other sectors” has been completely re-evaluated compared to 
earlier versions of the Energy [R]evolution scenarios using a 
consistent approach based on technical efficiency potentials and 
energy intensities. 
Hydrogen generated by electrolysis and renewable electricity is 
introduced in this scenario as third renewable fuel in the transport
sector after 2025 complementary to biofuels and direct use of
renewable electricity. Hydrogen generation can have high energy 
losses, however the limited potentials of biofuels and probably also 
battery electric mobility makes it necessary to have a third 
renewable option. Alternatively, this renewable hydrogen could be 
converted into synthetic methane or liquid fuels depending of
economic benefits (storage costs vs. additional losses) and 
technology and market development in the transport sector 
(combustion engines vs. fuel cells).
In all sectors, the latest market development projections of the 
renewable energy industry 16 have been taken into account. The fast
introduction of electric vehicles, combined with the implementation 
of smart grids and fast expansion of super grids allows a high share 
of fluctuating renewable power generation (photovoltaic and wind) 
to be employed. In this scenario, renewable energy would pass 50% 
of USA energy supply just after 2035.
These scenarios by no means claim to predict the future; they 
simply describe and compare two potential development pathways 
out of the broad range of possible ‘futures’. The Energy 
[R]evolution scenarios are designed to indicate the efforts and 
actions required to achieve their ambitious objectives and to 
illustrate the options we have at hand to change our energy supply 
system into one that is truly sustainable.

ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
3scenarios for a future energy supply |SCENARIO BACKGROUND & ECONOMIC GROWTH 
32 3.1 scenario background 
The scenarios in this report were jointly commissioned by 
Greenpeace, the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) and the 
European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) from the Systems 
Analysis group of the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics, part of
the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The supply scenarios were 
calculated using the Mesap/PlaNet simulation model adopted in the 
previous Energy [R]evolution studies.17 The global energy demand 
projections were developed from the University of Utrecht,
Netherlands, based on an analysis of the future potential for energy 
efficiency measures in 2012. Finally the Institute for Sustainable 
Futures (ISF) analyzed the employment effects of the Energy 
[R]evolution and Reference scenarios. 
3.1.1 status and future projections for renewable heating 
technologies 
EREC and DLR undertook detailed research about the current
renewable heating technology markets, market forecasts, cost
projections and state of the technology development. The cost
projection as well as the technology option have been used as an 
input information for this new Energy [R]evolution scenario.
3.2 population development 
Future population development is an important factor in energy 
scenario building because population size affects the size and 
composition of energy demand, directly and through its impact on 
economic growth and development. For this study the population 
projections from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
up to 2050 are applied.18 
3.3 economic growth 
Economic growth is a key driver for energy demand. Since 1971,
each 1% increase in global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has 
been accompanied by a 0.6% increase in primary energy 
consumption. The decoupling of energy demand and GDP growth is 
therefore a prerequisite for an energy revolution. Most global
energy/economic/environmental models constructed in the past have 
relied on market exchange rates to place countries in a common 
currency for estimation and calibration. This approach has been the 
subject of considerable discussion in recent years, and an 
alternative has been proposed in the form of purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. Purchasing power parities compare 
the costs in different currencies of a fixed basket of traded and 
non-traded goods and services and yield a widely-based measure of
the standard of living. This is important in analysing the main 
drivers of energy demand or for comparing energy intensities 
among countries. 
Although PPP assessments are still relatively imprecise compared 
to statistics based on national income and product trade and 
national price indexes, they are considered to provide a better basis 
for a scenario development.19 Thus all data on economic 
development in WEO 2011 refers to purchasing power adjusted 
GDP. However, as WEO 2011 only covers the time period up to 
2035, the projections for 2035-2050 for the Energy [R]evolution 
scenario are based on our own estimates. 
Prospects for GDP growth have decreased considerably since the 
previous study, due to the financial crisis at the beginning of 2009,
although underlying growth trends continue much the same. GDP 
growth in all regions is expected to slow gradually over the coming 
decades. World GDP is assumed to grow on average by 3.8% per 
year over the period 2009-2030, compared to 3.1% from 1971 to 
2007, and on average by 3.1% per year over the entire modelling 
period (2009-2050). China and India are expected to grow faster

per year over the projection period.
3.4 oil and gas price projections 
The recent dramatic fluctuations in global oil prices have resulted in 
slightly higher forward price projections for fossil fuels. Under the 
2004 ‘high oil and gas price’ scenario from the European Commission,
for example, an oil price of just US$ 34 per barrel (/bbl) was assumed 
in 2030. More recent projections of oil prices by 2035 in the IEA’s 
WEO 2011 range from US$ 2010 97/bbl in the 450 ppm scenario up to 
US$ 2010 140/bbl in current policies scenario. Since the first Energy [R]evolution study was published in 2007,
however, the actual price of oil has reached over US$ 100/bbl for the first
time, and in July 2008 reached a record high of more than US$ 140/bbl.
Although oil prices fell back to US$ 100/bbl in September 2008 and 
around US$ 80/bbl in April 2010, prices have increased to more than 
US$ 110/bbl in early 2012. Thus, the projections in the IEA Current
Policies scenario might still be considered too conservative. Taking into 
account the growing global demand for oil we have assumed a price 
development path for fossil fuels slightly higher than the IEA WEO 2011 
“Current Policies” case extrapolated forward to 2050 (see Table 3.3). 
As the supply of natural gas is limited by the availability of pipeline 
infrastructure, there is no world market price for gas. In most regions 
of the world the gas price is directly tied to the price of oil. Gas prices 
are therefore assumed to increase to US$24-30/GJ by 2050.

3.5 cost of CO 2emissions 
The costs of CO 2allowances needs to be included in the calculation 
of electricity generation costs. Projections of emissions costs are 
even more uncertain than energy prices, and a broad range of
future estimates has been made in studies. Other projections have 
assumed higher CO 2costs than than those included in this Energy 
[R]evolution study (75 US$ 2010 /tCO 2)20 , reflecting estimates of the 
total external costs of CO 2emissions. The CO 2cost estimates in the 
2010 version of the global 
Energy [R]evolution were rather conservative (50 US$ 2008 /t). 
CO 2costs are applied in Kyoto Protocol Non-Annex B countries 
only from 2030 on.
3.6 cost projections for efficient fossil fuel 
generation and carbon capture and storage (CCS)
Further cost reduction potentials are assumed for fuel power 
technologies in use today for coal, gas, lignite and oil. Because they 
are at an advanced stage of market development the potential for 
cost reductions is limited, and will be achieved mainly through an 
increase in efficiency.21 
There is much speculation about the potential for carbon capture and 
storage (CCS) to mitigate the effect of fossil fuel consumption on 
climate change, even though the technology is still under development. 
CCS means trapping CO 2from fossil fuels, either before or after 
they are burned, and ‘storing’ (effectively disposing of) it in the sea 
or beneath the surface of the earth. There are currently three 
different methods of capturing CO 2: ‘pre-combustion’, ‘post-
combustion’ and ‘oxyfuel combustion’. However, development is at a 
very early stage and CCS will not be implemented - in the best case 
- before 2020 and will probably not become commercially viable as 
a possible effective mitigation option until 2030. 
Cost estimates for CCS vary considerably, depending on factors such 
as power station configuration, technology, fuel costs, size of project
and location. One thing is certain, however: CCS is expensive. It
requires significant funds to construct the power stations and the 
necessary infrastructure to transport and store carbon. The IPCC 
special report on CCS assesses costs at US$ 15-75 per tonne of
captured CO 222 , while a 2007 US Department of Energy report found 
installing carbon capture systems to most modern plants resulted in a 
near doubling of costs.23 These costs are estimated to increase the 
price of electricity in a range from 21-91%.24 ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

Non-Annex-B countries Pipeline networks will also need to be constructed to move CO 2to 
storage sites. This is likely to require a considerable outlay of
capital.25 Costs will vary depending on a number of factors,
including pipeline length, diameter and manufacture from 
corrosion-resistant steel, as well as the volume of CO 2to be 
transported. Pipelines built near population centres or on difficult
terrain, such as marshy or rocky ground, are more expensive.26 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates a 
cost range for pipelines of US$ 1 – 8/tonne of CO 2transported. A 
United States Congressional Research Services report calculated 
capital costs for an 11 mile pipeline in the Midwestern region of the 
US at approximately US$ 6 million. The same report estimates that a 
dedicated interstate pipeline network in North Carolina would cost
upwards of US$ 5 billion due to the limited geological sequestration 
potential in that part of the country.27 Storage and subsequent
monitoring and verification costs are estimated by the IPCC to range 
from US$ 0.5-8/tCO 2(for storage) and US$ 0.1-0.3/tCO 2. The 
overall cost of CCS could therefore be a major barrier to its 
deployment.28 
For the above reasons, CCS power plants are not included in our 
economic analysis. Greenpeace also advocates against CCS because 
of other social, political, and environmental costs.29 
Table 3.5 summarises our assumptions on the technical and economic 
parameters of future fossil-fueled power plant technologies. Based on 
estimates from WEO 2010, we assume that further technical
innovation will not prevent an increase of future investment costs 
because raw material costs and technical complexity will continue to 
increase. Also, improvements in power plant efficiency are outweighed 
by the expected increase in fossil fuel prices, which would increase 
electricity generation costs significantly.

3.7 cost projections for renewable energy technologies 
The different renewable energy technologies available today all have 
different technical maturity, costs and development potential.
Whereas hydro power has been widely used for decades, other 
technologies, such as the gasification of biomass or ocean energy,
have yet to find their way to market maturity. Some renewable 
sources by their very nature, including wind and solar power, provide 
a variable supply, requiring coordination with the grid network. But
although in many cases renewable energy technologies are 
‘distributed’ - their output being generated and delivered locally to 
the consumer – in the future we can also have large-scale 
applications like offshore wind parks, photovoltaic power plants or 
concentrating solar power stations.
It is possible to develop a wide spectrum of options to market
maturity, using the individual advantages of the different
technologies, and linking them with each other, and integrating them 
step by step into the existing supply structures. This approach will
provide a complementary portfolio of environmentally friendly 
technologies for heat and power supply and the provision of
transport fuels.
Many of the renewable technologies employed today are at a 
relatively early stage of market development. As a result, the costs 
of electricity, heat and fuel production are generally higher than 
those of competing conventional systems - a reminder that the 
environmental and social costs of conventional power production 
are not reflected in market prices. It is expected, however that large 
cost reductions can come from technical advances, manufacturing 
improvements and large-scale production, unlike conventional
technologies. The dynamic trend of cost developments over time 
plays a crucial role in identifying economically sensible expansion 
strategies for scenarios spanning several decades.To identify long-term cost developments, learning curves have been 
applied to the model calculations to reflect how the cost of a 
particular technology can change in relation to the cumulative 
production volumes. For many technologies, the learning factor (or 
progress ratio) is between 0.75 for less mature systems to 0.95 and 
higher for well-established technologies. A learning factor of 0.9 
means that costs are expected to fall by 10% every time the 
cumulative output from the technology doubles. Empirical data 
shows, for example, that the learning factor for PV solar modules 
has been fairly constant at 0.8 over 30 years whilst that for wind 
energy varies from 0.75 in the UK to 0.94 in the more advanced 
German market.
Assumptions on future costs for renewable electricity technologies in 
the Energy [R]evolution scenario are derived from a review of
learning curve studies, for example by Lena Neij and others 30 , from 
the analysis of recent technology foresight and road mapping studies,
including the European Commission funded NEEDS project (New 
Energy Externalities Developments for Sustainability) 31 or the IEA 
Energy Technology Perspectives 2008, projections by the European 
Renewable Energy Council published in April 2010 (“Re-Thinking 
2050”) and discussions with experts from different sectors of the 
renewable energy industry.

ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
36 3.7.1 photovoltaics (PV ) 
The worldwide photovoltaics (PV) market has been growing at over 
40% per annum in recent years and the contribution is starting to 
make a significant contribution to electricity generation.
Photovoltaics are important because of its decentralized /
centralized character, its flexibility for use in an urban environment
and huge potential for cost reduction. The PV industry has been 
increasingly exploiting this potential during the last few years, with 
installation prices more than halving in the last few years. Current
development is focused on improving existing modules and system 
components by increasing their energy efficiency and reducing 
material usage. Technologies like PV thin film (using alternative 
semiconductor materials) or dye sensitive solar cells are developing 
quickly and present a huge potential for cost reduction. The mature 
technology crystalline silicon, with a proven lifetime of 30 years, is 
continually increasing its cell and module efficiency (by 0.5% 
annually), whereas the cell thickness is rapidly decreasing (from 
230 to 180 microns over the last five years). Commercial module 
efficiency varies from 14 to 21%, depending on silicon quality and 
fabrication process.
The learning factor for PV modules has been fairly constant over 
the last 30 years with costs reducing by 20% each time the 
installed capacity doubles, indicating a high rate of technical
learning. Assuming a globally installed capacity of 1,500 GW by 
between 2030 and 2040 in the Energy [R]evolution scenario, and 
with an electricity output of 2,600 TWh/a, we can expect that
generation costs of around US$ 5-10 cents/kWh (depending on the 
region) will be achieved. During the following five to ten years, PV 
will become competitive with retail electricity prices in many parts 
of the world, and competitive with fossil fuel costs by 2030. Cost
data applied in this study is shown in Table 3.6. In the long term,
additional costs for the integration into the power supply system of
up to 25% of PV investment have been taken into account
(estimation for local batteries and load and generation 
management measures).3.7.2 concentrating solar power (CSP ) 
Solar thermal ‘concentrating’ power stations (CSP) can only use 
direct sunlight and are therefore dependent on very sunny locations.
Southern Europe has a technical potential for this technology which 
far exceeds local demand. The various solar thermal technologies 
have good prospects for further development and cost reductions.
Because of their more simple design, ‘Fresnel’ collectors are 
considered as an option for additional cost trimming. The efficiency of
central receiver systems can be increased by producing compressed 
air at a temperature of up to 10,000 C°, which is then used to run a 
combined gas and steam turbine.
Thermal storage systems are a way for CSP electricity generators 
to reduce costs. The Spanish Andasol 1 plant, for example, is 
equipped with molten salt storage with a capacity of 7.5 hours. A 
higher level of full load operation can be realized by using a 
thermal storage system and a large collector field. Although this 
leads to higher investment costs, it reduces the cost of electricity 
generation. 
Depending on the level of irradiation and mode of operation, it is 
expected that long term future electricity generation costs of 
US$ 6-10 cents/kWh can be achieved. This presupposes rapid market
introduction in the next few years. CSP investment costs assumed for 
this study and shown in Table 3.7 include costs for an increasing 
storage capacity up to 12 hours per day and additional solar fields up 
to solar multiple 3, achieving a maximum of 6,500 full load hours 
per year.3scenarios for a future energy supply |COST PROJECTIONS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES

3.7.3 wind power 
Within a short period of time, the dynamic development of wind 
power has resulted in the establishment of a flourishing global
market. In Europe, favorable policy incentives were the early drivers 
for the global wind market. The boom in demand for wind power 
technology has nonetheless led to supply constraints. As a 
consequence, the cost of new systems has increased. The industry is 
continuously expanding production capacity, however, so it is 
already resolving the bottlenecks in the supply chain. Taking into 
account market development projections, learning curve analysis 
and industry expectations, we assume that investment costs for 
wind turbines will reduce by 25% for onshore and 50% for 
offshore installations up to 2050. Additional costs for grid 
integration of up to 25% of investment has been taken into account
also in the cost data for wind power shown in Table 3.9.3.7.4 biomass 
The crucial factor for the economics of using biomass for energy is 
the cost of the feedstock, which today ranges from a negative for 
waste wood (based on credit for waste disposal costs avoided) 
through inexpensive residual materials to the more expensive energy 
crops. The resulting spectrum of energy generation costs is 
correspondingly broad. One of the most economic options is the use 
of waste wood in steam turbine combined heat and power (CHP) 
plants. Gasification of solid biomass, on the other hand, which has a 
wide range of applications, is still relatively expensive. In the long 
term it is expected that using wood gas both in micro CHP units 
(engines and fuel cells) and in gas-and-steam power plants will
have the most favorable electricity production costs. Converting 
crops into ethanol and ‘bio diesel’ made from rapeseed methyl ester 
(RME) has become increasingly important in recent years, for 
example in Brazil, the USA and Europe –although its climate 
benefit is disputed. Processes for obtaining synthetic fuels from 
biogenic synthesis gases will also play a larger role.
A large potential for exploiting modern technologies exists in Latin 
and North America, Europe and the Transition Economies, either in 
stationary appliances or the transport sector. In the long term,
Europe and the Transition Economies could realize 20-50% of the 
potential for biomass from energy crops, whilst biomass use in all the 
other regions will have to rely on forest residues, industrial wood 
waste and straw. In Latin America, North America and Africa in 
particular, an increasing residue potential will be available.
In other regions, such as the Middle East and all Asian regions,
increased use of biomass is restricted, either due to a generally low 
availability or already high traditional use. For the latter, using 
modern, more efficient technologies will improve the sustainability 
of current usage and have positive side effects, such as reducing 
indoor pollution and the heavy workloads currently associated with 
traditional biomass use.

box 3.1:biomass in the 2012 energy [r]evolution 
(4th edition)
The 2012 Energy [R]evolution (4th ed.) is an energy scenario 
which shows a possible pathway for the global energy system to 
move from fossil fuels dominated supply towards energy 
efficiency and sustainable renewable energy use. The aim is to 
only use sustainable bioenergy and reduce the use of
unsustainable bioenergy in developing countries which is 
currently in the range of 30 to 40 EJ/a. The fourth edition of the 
Energy [R]evolution again decreases the amount of bioenergy 
used significantly due to sustainability reasons, and the lack of
global environmental and social standards. The amount of
bioenergy used in this report is based on bioenergy potential
surveys which are drawn from existing studies, but not
necessarily reflecting all the ecological assumptions that
Greenpeace would use. It is intended as a coarsescale, “order-of-
magnitude” example of what the energy mix would look like in 
the future (2050) with largely phased-out fossil fuels. The 
rationale underpinning the use of biomass in the 2012 Energy 
[R]evolution is explained here but note the amount of bioenergy 
included in the Energy [R]evolution does not mean that
Greenpeace per se agrees to the amount without strict criteria.
The Energy [R]evolution takes a precautionary approach to the 
future use of bioenergy. This reflects growing concerns about the 
greenhouse gas balance of many biofuel sources, and also the risks 
posed by expanded biofuels crop production to biodiversity (forests,
wetlands and grasslands) and food security. It should be stressed,
however, that this conservative approach is based on an assessment
of today’s technologies and their associated risks. The development
of advanced forms of bio energies which do not involve significant
land take, are demonstrably sustainable in terms of their impacts 
on the wider environment, and have clear greenhouse gas benefits,
should be an objective of public policy, and would provide additional
flexibility in the renewable energy mix.
All energy production has some impact on the environment.
What is important is to minimise the impact on the environment,
through reduction in energy usage, increased efficiency and 
careful choice of renewable energy sources. Different sources of
energy have different impacts and these impacts can vary 
enormously with scale. Hence, a range of energy sources are 
needed, each with its own limits of what is sustainable.
Biomass is part of the mix of a wide variety of non-finite fuels 
that, together, provide a practical and possible means to eliminate 
our dependency on fossil fuels. Thereby we can minimise 
greenhouse gas emissions, especially from fossil carbon, from energy production. Concerns have also been raised about how 
countries account for the emissions associated with biofuels 
production and combustion. The lifecycle emissions of different
biofuels can vary enormously. To ensure that biofuels are produced 
and used in ways which maximise its greenhouse gas saving 
potential, these accounting problems will need to be resolved in 
future. The Energy [R]evolution prioritises non-combustion 
resources (wind, solar etc.). Greenpeace does not consider biomass 
as carbon, or greenhouse gas neutral because of the time biomass 
takes to regrow and because of emissions arising from direct and 
indirect land use changes. The Energy [R]evolution scenario is an 
energy scenario, therefore only energy-related CO2 emissions are 
calculated and no other GHG emissions can be covered, e.g. from 
agricultural practices. However, the Energy [R]evolution 
summarises the entire amount of bioenergy used in the energy 
model and indicates possible additional emissions connected to the 
use of biofuels. As there are many scientific publications about the 
GHG emission effects of bioenergy which vary between carbon 
neutral to higher CO 2emissions than fossil fuels a range is given in 
the Energy [R]evolution.
Bioenergy in the Energy [R]evolution scenario is largely limited 
to that which can be gained from wood processing and 
agricultural (crop harvest and processing) residues as well as 
from discarded wood products. The amounts are based on 
existing studies, some of which apply sustainability criteria but
do not necessarily reflect all Greenpeace’s sustainability criteria.
Largescale biomass from forests would not be sustainable.32 The 
Energy [R]evolution recognises that there are competing uses 
for biomass, e.g. maintaining soil fertility, use of straw as animal
feed and bedding, use of woodchip in furniture and does not use 
the full potential. Importantly, the use of biomass in the 2012 
Energy [R]evolution has been developed within the context of
Greenpeace’s broader bioenergy position to minimise and avoid 
the growth of bioenergy and in order to prevent use of
unsustainable bioenergy. The Energy [R]evolution uses the latest
available bioenergy technologies for power and heat generation,
as well as transport systems. These technologies can use different
types of fuel and biogas is preferred due to higher conversion 
efficiencies. Therefore the primary source for biomass is not fixed 
and can be changed over time. Of course, any individual
bioenergy project developed in reality needs to be thoroughly 
researched to ensure our sustainability criteria are met.
Greenpeace supports the most efficient use of biomass in stationary 
applications. For example, the use of agricultural and wood 
processing residues in, preferably regional and efficient cogeneration 
power plants, such as CHP (combined heat and power plants).

CONTRIBUTES TO GENERATING ELECTRICITY FOR UP 
TO 75,000 HOMES. 
3.7.5 geothermal 
Geothermal energy has long been used worldwide for supplying heat,
and since the beginning of the last century for electricity generation.
Geothermally generated electricity was previously limited to sites with 
specific geological conditions, but further intensive research and 
development work widened potential sites. In particular the creation 
of large underground heat exchange surfaces - Enhanced Geothermal
Systems (EGS) - and the improvement of low temperature power 
conversion, for example with the Organic Rankine Cycle, could make 
it possible to produce geothermal electricity anywhere. Advanced heat
and power co-generation plants will also improve the economics of
geothermal electricity.
A large part of the costs for a geothermal power plant come from 
deep underground drilling, so further development of innovative 
drilling technology is expected. Assuming a global average market
growth for geothermal power capacity of 15% per year up to 
2020, adjusting to 12% up to 2030 and still 7% per year beyond 
2030, the result would be a cost reduction potential of more than 
60% by 2050: 
•for conventional geothermal power (without heat credits), from 
US$ 15 cents/kWh to about US$ 9 cents/kWh; 
•for EGS, despite the presently high figures (about US$ 20-30 
cents/kWh), electricity production costs - depending on the credits for 
heat supply - are expected to come down to around 
US$ 8 cents/kWh in the long term. 
Because of its non-fluctuating supply and a grid load operating 
almost 100% of the time, geothermal energy is considered to be a 
key element in a future supply structure based on renewable 
sources. Up to now we have only used a marginal part of the 
potential. Shallow geothermal drilling, for example, can deliver 
energy for heating and cooling at any time anywhere, and can be 
used for thermal energy storage.3.7.6 ocean energy 
Ocean energy, particularly offshore wave energy, is a significant
resource, and has the potential to satisfy an important percentage of
electricity supply worldwide. Globally, the potential of ocean energy 
has been estimated at around 90,000 TWh/year. The most significant
advantages are the vast availability and high predictability of the 
resource and a technology with very low visual impact and no CO 2
emissions. Many different concepts and devices have been developed,
including taking energy from the tides, waves, currents and both 
thermal and saline gradient resources. Many of these are in an 
advanced phase of research and development, large scale prototypes 
have been deployed in real sea conditions and some have reached 
pre-market deployment. There are a few grid connected, fully 
operational commercial wave and tidal generating plants. 
The cost of energy from initial tidal and wave energy farms has 
been estimated to be in the range of US$ 25-95 cents/kWh 33 , and 
for initial tidal stream farms in the range of US$ 14-28 cents/kWh.
Generation costs of US$ 8-10 cents/kWh are expected by 2030.
Key areas for development will include concept design, optimization 
of the device configuration, reduction of capital costs by exploring 
the use of alternative structural materials, economies of scale and 
learning from operation. According to the latest research findings,
the learning factor is estimated to be 10-15% for offshore wave 
and 5-10% for tidal stream. In the long term, ocean energy has the 
potential to become one of the most competitive and cost effective 
forms of generation. In the next few years a dynamic market
penetration is expected, following a similar curve to wind energy.
Because of the early development stage any future cost estimates 
for ocean energy systems are uncertain. Present cost estimates are 
based on analysis from the European NEEDS project.34 3scenarios for a future energy supply |COST PROJECTIONS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES

3.7.7 hydro power 
Hydro power is a mature technology with a significant part of its global
resource already exploited. There is still, however, some potential left both 
for new schemes (especially small scale run-of-river projects with little or 
no reservoir impoundment) and for repowering of existing sites. There is 
likely to be some more potential for hydropower with the increasing need 
for flood control and the maintenance of water supply during dry periods.
Sustainable hydropower makes an effort to integrate plants with river 
ecosystems while reconciling ecology with economically attractive power 
generation. 3.7.8 summary of renewable energy cost development 
Figure 3.1 summarizes the cost trends for renewable power 
technologies derived from the respective learning curves. It is 
important to note that the expected cost reduction is not a function 
of time, but of cumulative capacity (production of units), so dynamic 
market development is required. Most of the technologies will be 
able to reduce their specific investment costs to between 30% and 
60% of current once they have achieved full maturity (after 2040).
Reduced investment costs for renewable energy technologies lead 
directly to reduced heat and electricity generation costs, as shown in 
Figure 3.2. Generation costs today are around US$ 8 to 
35 cents/kWh for the most important technologies, including 
photovoltaic. In the long term, costs are expected to converge at
around US$ 6 to 12 cents/kWh. These estimates depend on site-
specific conditions such as the local wind regime or solar irradiation,
the availability of biomass at reasonable prices or the credit granted 
for heat supply in the case of combined heat and power generation. E[R]

3.8 cost projections for renewable 
heating technologies 
Renewable heating has the longest tradition of all renewable 
technologies. EREC and DLR carried out a survey on costs of
renewable heating technologies in Europe, which analyses installation 
costs of renewable heating technologies, ranging from direct solar 
collector systems to geothermal and ambient heat applications and 
biomass technologies. The report shows that some technologies are 
already mature and compete on the market – especially simple 
heating systems in the domestic sector. However, more sophisticated 
technologies, which can provide higher shares of heat demand from 
renewable sources, are still under development and rather expensive.
Market barriers slow down the further implementation and cost
reduction of renewable heating systems, especially for heating 
networks. Nevertheless, significant learning rates can be expected if
renewable heating is increasingly implemented as projected in the 
Energy [R]evolution scenario.
3.8.1 solar thermal technologies 
Solar collectors depend on direct solar irradiation, so the yield 
strongly depends on the location. In very sunny regions even very 
simple collectors can provide hot water to households at very low 
cost. In Europe, thermosiphon systems can provide total hot water 
demand in households at around 260 $/m 2installation costs. In 
regions with less sun, where additional space heating is needed,
installation cost for pumped systems are twice as high. In these 
areas, economies of scales can decrease solar heating costs 
significantly. Large scale solar collector system are known from 
390-940 $/m 2, depending on the share of solar energy in the whole 
heating system and the level of storage required. While those cost
assumptions were transferred to all OECD Regions and the Eastern 
European Economies, a lower cost level for households was 
assumed in very sunny or developing regions.3.8.2 deep geothermal applications 
Deep geothermal heat from aquifers or reservoirs can be used 
directly in hydrothermal heating plants to supply heat demand close 
to the plant or in a district heating network for several different types 
of heat. Due to the high drilling costs deep geothermal energy is 
mostly feasibly for large applications in combination with heat
networks. It is already economic feasible and has been in use for a 
long time, where aquifers can be found near the surface, e.g. in the 
Pacific Island or along the Pacific ring of fire. Also in Europe deep 
geothermal applications are being developed for heating purposes at
investment costs from 
780 $/kWth (shallow) to 4,700 $/kWth (deep), with the costs 
strongly dependent on the drilling depth. As deep geothermal systems 
require a high technology level, European cost assumptions were 
transferred to all regions worldwide.
3.8.3 heat pumps (aerothermal systems)
Heat pumps typically provide hot water or space heat for heating 
systems with relatively low supply temperature or can serve as a 
supplement to other heating technologies. They have become increasingly 
popular for underfloor heating in buildings in Europe. Economies of
scale are less important than for deep geothermal, so there is focus on 
small household applications with investment costs in Europe ranging 
from 780-2,500 $/kW for ground water systems and from 1,900-4,700 
$/kW for ground source or aerothermal systems.

3.8.4 biomass applications 
There is broad portfolio of modern technologies for heat production 
from biomass, ranging from small scale single room stoves to heating 
or CHP-plants in MW scale. Investments costs in Europe show a 
similar variety: simple log wood stoves can be obtained from 
150 $/kW, more sophisticated automated heating systems that cover 
the whole heat demand of a building are significantly more expensive.
Log wood or pellet boilers range from 630-1,900 $/kW, with large 
applications being cheaper than small systems. Considering the possible 
applications of this wide range of technologies especially in the 
household sector, higher investment costs were assumed for hightech 
regions of the OECD, the Eastern European Economies and Middle 
East. Sunny regions with low space heat demand as well as developing 
regions are covered with very low investment costs. Economy of scales 
apply to heating plants above 500kW, with investment cost between 
620-1,100 $/kW. Heating plants can deliver process heat or provide 
whole neighborhoods with heat. Even if heat networks demand 
additional investment, there is great potential to use solid biomass for 
heat generation in both small and large heating centers linked to local
heating networks.
Cost reductions expected vary strongly within each technology sector,
depending on the maturity of a specific technology. E.g. small wood 
stoves will not see significant cost reductions, while there is still
learning potential for automated pellet heating systems. Cost for simple 
solar collectors for swimming pools might be already optimized,
whereas integration in large systems is neither technological nor 
economical mature. Table 3.13 shows average development pathways 
for a variety of heat technology options.3.9 assumptions for fossil fuel phase out 
More than 80% of the global current energy supply is based on fossil
fuels. Oil dominates the entire transport sector; oil and gas make up 
the heating sector and coal is the most-used fuel for power. Each 
sector has different renewable energy and energy efficiency 
technologies combinations which depend on the locally available 
resources, infrastructure and to some extent, lifestyle. The renewable 
energy technology pathways use in this scenario are based on 
currently available “off-the-shelf” technologies, market situations and 
market projections developed from renewable industry associations 
such as the Global Wind Energy Council, the European Photovoltaic 
Industry Association and the European Renewable Energy Council,
the DLR and Greenpeace International. 
In line with this modeling, the Energy [R]evolution needs to map 
out a clear pathway to phase-out oil in the short term and gas in 
the mid to long term. This pathway has been identified on the basis 
of a detailed analysis of the global conventional oil resources,
current infrastructure of those industries, the estimated production 
capacities of existing oil wells and the investment plans know by 
end 2011. Those remaining fossil fuel resources between 2012 and 
2050 form the oil pathway, so no new deep sea and arctic oil
exploration, no oil shale and tar sand mining for two reasons: 
•First and foremost, to limit carbon emissions to save the climate.
•Second, financial resources must flow from 2012 onwards in the 
development of new and larger markets for renewable energy 
technologies and energy efficiency to avoid “locking-in” new 
fossil fuel infrastructure. ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

Figure 3.3 shows the remaining production capacities with an annual
production decline between 2.5% and 5% and the additional
production capacities assuming all new projects planned for 2012 to 
2020 will go ahead. Even with new projects, the amount of remaining 
conventional oil is very limited and therefore a transition towards a 
low oil demand pattern is essential.3.9.2 coal – production decline assumptions 
While there is an urgent need for a transition away from oil and 
gas to avoid “locking-in” investments in new production wells, the 
climate is the clearly limiting factor for the coal resource, not its 
availability. All existing coal mines – even without new expansions 
of mines – could produce more coal, but its burning puts the world 
on a catastrophic climate change pathway.

3.10 review: greenpeace scenario projections 
of the past 
Greenpeace has published numerous projections in cooperation with 
renewable industry associations and scientific institutions in the 
past decade. This section provides an overview of the projections 
between 2000 and 2011 and compares them with real market
developments and projections of the IEA World Energy Outlook – 
our Reference scenario. 
3.10.1 the development of the global wind industry 
Greenpeace and the European Wind Energy Association published 
“Windforce 10” for the first time in 1999– a global market
projection for wind turbines until 2030. Since then, an updated 
prognosis has been published every second year. Since 2006 the report has been renamed to “Global Wind Energy Outlook” with a 
new partner – the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) – a new 
umbrella organization of all regional wind industry associations.
Figure 3.5 shows the projections made each year between 2000 
and 2010 compared to the real market data. The graph also 
includes the first two Energy [R]evolution (ER) editions (published 
in 2007 and 2008) against the IEA’s wind projections published in 
World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2007. 
The projections from the “Wind force 10” and “Windforce 12” were 
calculated by BTM consultants, Denmark. The “Windforce 10” 
(2001 - 2011) projection for the global wind market was actually 
10% lower than the actual market development. All following 
editions were around 10% above or below the real market. In 2006,
the new “Global Wind Energy Outlook” had two different scenarios, a 
moderate and an advanced wind power market projections calculated ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

by GWEC and Greenpeace International. The figures here show only 
the advanced projections, as the moderate were too low. However,
these very projections were the most criticized at the time, being 
called “over ambitious” or even “impossible”. 
In contrast, the IEA “Current Policy” projections seriously under 
estimated the wind industry’s ability to increase manufacturing 
capacity and reduce costs. In 2000, the IEA published projections 
of global installed capacity for wind turbines of 32,500 MW for 2010. This capacity had been connected to the grid by early 2003,
only two-and-a-half years later. By 2010, the global wind capacity 
was close to 200,000 MW; around six times more than the IEA’s 
assumption a decade earlier. 
Only time will tell if the GPI/DLR/GWEC longer-term projections 
for the global wind industry will remain close to the real market.
However the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 
projections over the past decade have been constantly increased 
and keep coming close to our progressive growth rates.

3.10.2 the development of the global solar 
photovoltaic industry 
Inspired by the successful work with the European Wind Energy 
Association (EWEA), Greenpeace began working with the 
European Photovoltaic Industry Association to publish “Solar 
Generation 10” – a global market projection for solar photovoltaic 
technology up to 2020 for the first time in 2001. Since then, six 
editions have been published and EPIA and Greenpeace have 
continuously improved the calculation methodology with experts 
from both organizations.Figure 3.7 shows the actual projections for each year between 
2001 and 2010 compared to the real market data, against the first
two Energy [R]evolution editions (published in 2007 and 2008) 
and the IEA ’s solar projections published in World Energy Outlook 
(WEO) 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2007. The IEA did not make 
specific projections for solar photovoltaic in the first editions 
analyzed in the research, instead the category “Solar/Tidal/Other” 
are presented in Figure 3.7 and 3.8.
In contrast to the wind projections, all the SolarGeneration 
projections have been too conservative. The total installed capacity in ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

2010 was close to 40,000 MW about 30% higher than projected in 
SolarGeneration published ten years earlier. Even SolarGeneration 5,
published in 2008, under-estimated the possible market growth of
photovoltaic in the advanced scenario. In contrast, the IEA WEO 
2000 estimations for 2010 were reached in 2004. 
The long-term projections for solar photovoltaic are more difficult
than for wind because the costs have dropped significantly faster than projected. For some OECD countries, solar has reached grid 
parity with fossil fuels in 2012 and other solar technologies, such 
as concentrated solar power plants (CSP), are also headed in that
direction. Therefore, future projections for solar photovoltaic do not
just depend on cost improvements, but also on available storage 
technologies. Grid integration can actually be a bottle-neck to solar 
that is now expected much earlier than estimated.

3.11 how does the global energy [r]evolution 
scenario compare to other scenarios? 
The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a ground-
breaking new “Special Report on Renewables” (SRREN) in May 2011.
This report showed the latest and most comprehensive analysis of
scientific reports on all renewable energy resources and global
scientifically accepted energy scenarios. The Energy [R]evolution was 
among three scenarios chosen as an indicative scenario for an ambitious 
renewable energy pathway. The following summarizes the IPCC’s view. 
Four future pathways, the following models were assessed intensively: 
•International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook 2009, (IEA 
WEO 2009) 
•Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution 2010, (ER 2010) 
•ReMIND-RECIPE 
•MiniCam EMF 22 
The World Energy Outlook of the International Energy Agency was 
used as an example baseline scenario (least amount of development
of renewable energy) and the other three treated as “mitigation 
scenarios”, to address climate change risks. The four scenarios 
provide substantial additional information on a number of technical
details, represent a range of underlying assumptions and follow 
different methodologies. They provide different renewable energy 
deployment paths, including Greenpeace’s “optimistic application 
path for renewable energy assuming that . . . the current high dynamic 
(increase rates) in the sector can be maintained”. The IPCC notes that scenario results are determined partly by 
assumptions, but also might depend on the underlying modelling 
architecture and model specific restrictions. The scenarios analyzed 
use different modelling architectures, demand projections and 
technology portfolios for the supply side. The full results are 
provided in Table 3.14, but in summary:
•The IEA baseline has a high demand projection with low 
renewable energy development.
•ReMind-RECIPE, MiniCam EMF 22 scenarios portrays a high 
demand expectation and significant increase of renewable energy is 
combined with the possibility to employ CCS and nuclear. 
•The ER 2010 relies on and low demand (due to a significant increase 
of energy efficiency) combined with high renewable energy deployment,
no CCS employment and a global nuclear phase-out by 2045. 
Both population increase and GDP development are major driving 
forces on future energy demand and therefore at least indirectly 
determining the resulting shares of renewable energy. The IPCC 
analysis shows which models use assumptions based on outside inputs 
and what results are generated from within the models. All scenarios 
take a 50% increase of the global population into account on 
baseline 2009. Regards gross domestic product (GDP), all assume or 
calculate a significant increase in terms of the GDP. The IEA WEO 
2009 and the ER 2010 model uses forecasts of International
Monetary Fund (IMF 2009) and the Organization of Economic Co-
Operation and Development (OECD) as inputs to project GSP. The 
other two scenarios calculate GDP from within their model. ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
4.1energy demand by sector 
Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth 
and energy intensity results in future development pathways for the 
final energy demand of the USA. These are shown in Figure 4.1 for 
the Reference and the Energy [R]evolution scenario. Under the 
Reference scenario, total primary energy demand increases by 11% 
from the current 95,201 Trillion BTU/a to around 105,800 Trillion 
BTU/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution scenario, primary energy 
demand decreases by 40% compared to current consumption and it
is expected to reach 57,500 Trillion BTU/a by 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution scenario, electricity demand is 
expected to decrease in both the industry sector as well as in the 
residential and service sector, but to grow in the transport sector 
(see Figure 4.2). Total electricity demand in the scenario rises from 
3,796 TWh/a to 4,153 TWh/a by the year 2050. Compared to the 
Reference scenario, efficiency measures in the industry, residential
and service sectors avoid the generation of about 1,930 TWh/a.
This reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing highly 
efficient electronic devices using the best available technology in all
demand sectors.Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the 
Energy [R]evolution scenario, demand for heat supply is expected 
to decrease almost constantly (see Figure 4.4). Compared to the 
Reference scenario, consumption equivalent to around 5,400 Trillion 
BTU/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. As a result of
energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residential
buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and 
‘passive houses’ for new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort
and energy services will be accompanied by a much lower future 
energy demand.

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterized by a 
dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing share 
of renewable electricity. This will compensate for the phasing out of
nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants 
required for grid stabilization. By 2050, 97% of the electricity 
produced in the USA will come from renewable energy sources. ‘New’
renewables – mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV – will
contribute 88% of electricity generation. Already by 2020 the share of
renewable electricity production will be 37% and 71% by 2030. The 
installed capacity of renewables will reach 1,370 GW in 2030 and 
1,857 GW by 2050.
Table 4.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different renewable 
technologies in the US over time. Up to 2020 hydro and wind will
remain the main contributors of the growing market share. After 
2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by 
electricity from photovoltaics, concentrating solar thermal power 
(CSP) and biomass. The Energy [R]evolution scenario will lead to a 
high share of fluctuating power generation sources (photovoltaic, wind 
and ocean) of 44% by 2030, therefore the expansion of smart grids,
demand side management (DSM) and storage capacities will be used 
for a better grid integration and power generation management. CSP 
plants with thermal energy storage play an important role in the 
scenario making solar power generation dispatchable, like conventional
power plants.table 4.1: renewable electricity generation capacity under

4.3 future costs of electricity generation 
Figure 4.6 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies under 
the Energy [R]evolution scenario slightly increases the future costs of
electricity generation compared to the Reference scenario. This 
difference will be only around 0.3 US$ cent/kWh up to 2025, however,
if increasing fossil fuel prices are assumed. Because of high costs for 
conventional fuels and the lower CO 2intensity of electricity generation,
electricity generation costs will become economically favorable under 
the Energy [R]evolution scenario and by 2050 costs will be 10.5 US$ 
cents/kWh below those in the Reference version.
Under the Reference scenario,on the other hand, unchecked growth in 
demand, an increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO 2emissions 
result in total electricity supply costs rising from today’s US$ 469 
billion per year to more than US$ 1,088 billion in 2050. Figure 4.6 
shows that the Energy [R]evolution scenario not only complies with 
USA’s CO 2reduction targets but also helps to stabilize energy costs and 
relieve the economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency 
and shifting energy supply to renewables lead to long term costs for 
electricity supply that are 47% lower than in the Reference scenario.
4.4 future investments in the power sector 
It would require US$ 6,754 billion in investment for the Energy 
[R]evolution scenario to become reality (including investments for 
replacement after the economic lifetime of the plants) -
approximately US$ 4,084 billion or US$ 103 billion annual more 
than in the Reference scenario (US$ 2,670 billion). Under the 
Reference version, the levels of investment in conventional power 
plants add up to almost 66% while approx. 34% would be invested 
in renewable energy and cogeneration (CHP) until 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution scenario, however, USA would shift
almost 95% of the entire investment towards renewables and 
cogeneration. Until 2030, the fossil fuel share of power sector 
investment would be focused mainly on CHP plants. The average 
annual investment in the power sector under the Energy 
[R]evolution scenario between today and 2050 would be 
approximately US$ 169 billion.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, however, the fossil fuel
cost savings (excluding nuclear) in the Energy [R]evolution 
scenario reach a total of US$ 6,124 billion up to 2050, or 
US$ 153 billion per year. The total fuel cost savings therefore would 
cover 150% of the total additional investments compared to the 
Reference scenario. These renewable energy sources would then go 
on to produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond 
2050, while the costs for coal and gas will continue to be a burden 
on national economies.figure 4.6: total electricity supply costs and specific

4.5 energy supply for heating and cooling 
Today, renewables meet 10% of USA’s primary energy demand for 
heat supply, the main contribution coming from the use of biomass.
The lack of district heating networks is a severe structural barrier 
to the large scale utilization of geothermal and solar thermal
energy. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure a 
dynamic development. In the Energy [R]evolution scenario,
renewables provide 45% of USA’s total heat demand in 2030 and 
94% in 2050.
•Energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently growing 
energy demand for heating and cooling by 28% in 2050 (relative 
to the reference scenario), in spite of improving living standards 
and economic growth.
•In the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy (incl.
heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from renewable 
sources are increasingly substituting for fossil fuel-fired systems.
•A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining 
conventional applications leads to a further reduction of 
CO 2emissions.
Table 4.2 shows the development of the different renewable 
technologies for heating in the US over time. Up to 2020 biomass 
will remain the main contributor of the growing market share. After 
2020, the continuing growth of solar collectors and a growing 
share of geothermal heat pumps will reduce the dependence on 
fossil fuels.table 4.2: projection of renewable heating and cooling

4.6 future investment in the heating and 
cooling sector 
In the heat sector the Energy [R]evolution scenario would require a 
major revision of current investment strategies in heating 
technologies. Especially solar and heat pump technologies need 
enormous increase in installations, if these potentials are to be 
tapped for the heat sector. Installed capacity needs to increase by 
the factor of 70 for solar thermal and by the factor of about 400 
for heat pumps. Capacity of biomass technologies will decrease but
remain a pillar of heat supply. In addition, a strong role of
geothermal heat for district heating and low temperature process 
heat in industry was assumed.
Renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from low 
tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to very 
sophisticated enhanced geothermal systems and solar thermal
district heating plants with seasonal storage. Thus it can only 
roughly be calculated, that the Energy [R]evolution scenario in 
total requires around US$ 4,300 billion to be invested in renewable 
heating technologies until 2050 (including investments for 
replacement after the economic lifetime of the plants) -
approximately US$ 108 billion per year.table 4.3: renewable heating and cooling capacities under

4.7 transport 
A key target in the USA is to introduce incentives for people to drive 
smaller cars, something almost completely absent today. In addition,
it is vital to shift transport use to efficient modes like rail, light rail
and buses, especially in the expanding large metropolitan areas as 
well as reduced air travel per capita. Together with rising prices for 
fossil fuels, these changes reduce the huge car sales projected under 
the Reference scenario. Energy demand from the transport sector is 
reduced by around 18,700 Trillion BTU/a in 2050 (saving 71%) 
compared to the Reference scenario. Energy demand in the transport
sector will therefore decrease between 2011 and 2050 by 71% to 
7,480 Trillion BTU/a.
Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in hybrid 
and battery-electric power trains will bring large efficiency gains.
By 2030, electricity will provide 12% of the transport sector’s 
total energy demand in the Energy [R]evolution, while in 2050 the 
share will be 39%.table 4.4: transport energy demand by mode under the

4.8 development of CO 2emissions 
Whilst USA’s emissions of CO 2will increase by 4% between 2011 and 
2050 under the Reference scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution 
scenario they will decrease from 5,420 million tonnes in 2011 to 188 
million tonnes in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 
17.1 tonnes to 0.5 tonnes. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy 
and increasing demand, CO 2emissions will decrease in the electricity 
sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of
renewable energy in vehicles will reduce emissions in the transport
sector. With a share of 45 % of CO 2, the transport sector will be the 
largest remaining source of emissions in 2050. By 2025, USA’s CO 2
emissions are 27% below 1990 levels, by 2030 the reduction is 48%,
while by 2050 the total energy related CO 2reduction reaches 96%. 
4.9 primary energy consumption 
Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting 
primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution scenario is 
shown in Figure 4.12. Compared to the Reference scenario, overall
primary energy demand will be reduced by 46% in 2050. Around 87% 
of the remaining demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.
The Energy [R]evolution version aims to phase out coal and oil as fast
as technically and economically possible. This is made possible mainly 
by replacement of coal power plants with renewables and a fast
introduction of very efficient electric vehicles in the transport sector to 
replace oil combustion engines. This leads to an overall renewable 
primary energy share of 42% in 2030 and 87% in 2050. Nuclear 
energy is phased out just after 2035.figure 4.11:development of CO 2emissions by sector

5.1 methodology to calculate jobs 
Greenpeace International and the European Renewable Energy Council
have published four global Energy [R]evolution scenarios. These 
compare a low-carbon Energy [R]evolution scenario to a Reference 
scenario based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) “business as 
usual” projections (from the World Energy Outlook series, for example 
International Energy Agency, 2007, 2011a). The Institute for 
Sustainable Futures (ISF) analyzed the employment effects of the 
2008 and 2012 Energy [R]evolution global scenarios. The methodology 
used in the 2012 global analysis is used to calculate energy sector 
employment for the USA’s Energy [R]evolution and Reference scenario. 
Employment is projected for the US for both scenarios at 2015,
2020 and 2030 by using a series of employment multipliers and 
the projected electrical generation, electrical capacity, heat
collector capacity, and primary consumption of coal, gas and 
biomass (excluding gas used for transport). The results of the 
energy scenarios are used as inputs to the employment modelling. 
Only direct employment is included, namely jobs in construction,
manufacturing, operations and maintenance (O&M), and fuel supply 
associated with electricity generation and direct heat provision. Indirect
jobs and induced jobs are not included in the calculations. Indirect jobs 
generally include jobs in secondary industries that supply the primary 
industry sector, for example, catering and accommodation. Induced jobs 
are those resulting from spending wages earned in the primary 
industries. Energy efficiency jobs are also excluded, despite the fact that
the Energy [R]evolution includes significant development of efficiency,
as the uncertainties in estimation are too great. 
A detailed description of the methodology is given in Rutovitz & 
Harris, 2012a.5.2 overview 
Inputs for energy generation and demand for each 
scenario include:
•The amount of electrical and heating capacity that will be 
installed each year for each technology; 
•The primary energy demand for coal, gas and biomass fuels in the 
electricity and heating sectors; and  
•The amount of electricity generated per year from nuclear, oil and diesel.
Inputs for each technology include:
•“Employment factors”, or the number of jobs per unit of capacity,
separated into manufacturing, construction, operation and 
maintenance, and per unit of primary energy for fuel supply;
•For the 2020 and 2030 calculations, a “decline factor” for each 
technology that reduces the employment factors by a certain 
percentage per year to reflect the employment per unit reduction 
as technology efficiencies improve;
•The percentage of local manufacturing and domestic fuel
production in each region, in order to calculate the number of
manufacturing and fuel production jobs in the region; and 
•The percentage of world trade which originates in the region for 
coal and gas fuels, and for renewable traded components.
The electrical capacity increase and energy use figures from each 
scenario are multiplied by the employment factors for each of the 
technologies, as well as the proportion of fuel or manufacturing 
occurring locally. The calculation is summarized in Table 5.1.

61 5future employment |LIMITATIONS & EMPLOYMENT FACTORS 
5.3 limitations 
Employment numbers are indicative only, as a large number of
assumptions are required to make calculations. Quantitative data on 
present employment based on actual surveys is difficult to obtain, so it is 
not possible to calibrate the methodology against time series data, or even 
against current data in many regions. There are also some significant
areas of employment that are not included, including replacement of
generating plant, and energy efficiency jobs. However, within the limits of
data availability, the figures presented are indicative of employment levels 
in the electricity and heat sectors under the two scenarios. 
Insufficient data means it was not possible to include a comprehensive 
assessment for the heat supply sector. Only a partial estimate of the jobs in heat supply is included, as biomass, gas and coal jobs in this sector 
include only fuel supply jobs where heat is supplied directly (that is, not
via a combined heat and power plant), while jobs in heat from geothermal
and solar collectors primarily include manufacturing and installation. 
5.4 employment factors 
The employment factors used in the 2013 USA analysis are shown in 
Table 5.2, with the main source given in the notes. Most factors are 
from the 2012 global analysis (Rutovitz & Harris, 2012a), but USA 
only factors are used for coal fuel, nuclear construction and O&M,
hydro, and solar thermal power. The data for coal mining employment
and geothermal heat has been updated.

using the ratio used by the EWEA (European Wind Energy Association, 2009). For further 
detail, see Rutovitz & Harris, 2012a.
7.Wind offshore : All factors are from a German report (Price Waterhouse Coopers, 2012).
8.Solar PV : The Solar PV employment factors are all from the JEDI model (National
Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2011) 
9.Geothermal: The construction and installation, and O&M factor is derived from a study 
conducted by Sinclair Knight Merz (2005). The O&M factors are the weighted averages from 
employment data reported for thirteen power stations totalling 1050 MW in the US, Canada,
Greece and Australia (some of them hypothetical). The manufacturing factor is derived from a 
US study (Geothermal Energy Association, 2010). 
10.Solar thermal power : Construction and O&M jobs were derived from a weighted average of
eight reported power plants (1512 MW) in the US (Rutovitz & Harris, 2012a). The 
manufacturing factor came from the European Renewable Energy Council, 2008, page 16.
11.Ocean : The construction factor used in this study is a combined projection for wave and tidal
power derived from data for offshore wind power (Batten & Bahaj, 2007). A study of a 
particular wave power technology, Wave Dragon, provided jobs creation potential for that
technology, and the O&M factor used here is based on that report (Soerensen, 2008). 
12.Geothermal and heat pumps : One overall factor has been used for jobs per MW installed. This 
is derived from analysis of a US industry survey in 2012, which reported 9,088 total jobs in 
2012, including 2,611 manufacturing jobs (Battocletti & Glassley, 2012). Shipments of heat
pumps during that year came to 1,314 MW. 
13.Solar thermal heating : One overall factor has been used for jobs per MW installed, as this 
was the only data available on any large scale. This may underestimate jobs, as it may not
include O&M. The global figure comes is derived from the IEA heating and cooling program 
report (Weiss & Mauthner, 2011). notes on employment factors 
1.Coal: Construction, manufacturing and O&M factors are from the JEDI model (National
Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2011a). Fuel employment is calculated from the 2010 mining 
employment of 86,195 from the US EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2011) 
and the coal production from the BP world statistical review (BP, 2013).
2.Gas, oil and diesel: Installation and manufacturing factors are from the Jobs and Economic 
Development Impact (JEDI) model (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2011b). The 
O&M factor is an average of the figure from the 2010 report, the JEDI model, a US study 
(National Commission on Energy Policy, 2009) and ISF research (National Commission on 
Energy Policy, 2009; National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2011b; Rutovitz & Harris,
2012a; Rutovitz & Usher, 2010). The fuel factor per PJ is from 2008 information on US gas 
production (America’s Natural Gas Alliance, 2008). 
3.Nuclear : The construction and O& M factor is from a US study (National Commission on 
Energy Policy, 2009). The manufacturing factor is from the 2012 global report (Rutovitz & 
Harris, 2012b).The fuel factor was derived by ISF in 2009 (Rutovitz & Atherton, 2009).
4.Bioenergy : Employment factors for construction, manufacturing and O&M use the average 
values of studies from Greece, the UK, Spain, USA, and Europe wide (Kjaer, 2006; Moreno & 
López, 2008; Thornley, 2006; Thornley et al., 2009; Thornley, Rogers, & Huang, 2008;
Tourkolias & Mirasgedis, 2011). Fuel employment per PJ primary energy is derived from five 
studies (Domac, Richards, & Risovic, 2005; EPRI, 2001; Hillring, 2002; Thornley, 2006;
Upham & Speakman, 2007; Valente, Spinelli, & Hillring, 2011).
5.Hydro – large : Employment factors are from a US study (Navigant Consulting, 2009).
6.Wind – onshore : The installation factor used is from the European Wind Energy Association 
(EWEA). The manufacturing factor is derived using the employment per MW in turbine 
manufacture at Vestas from 2007 to 2011 (Vestas, 2011), adjusted for total manufacturing table 5.2: employment factors used in the 2013 analysis for the USA region

5.5 coal, gas and renewable technology trade 
It is assumed that all net manufacturing for energy technologies,
including wind and PV, occurs within the US. 
The USA is a significant producer of coal and gas, and is the fourth 
largest hard coal exporter (International Energy Agency, 2011b). Coal
exports in the Reference scenario are taken from the 2011 World Energy 
Outlook New Policies scenario (International Energy Agency, 2011a).
Coal exports in the Energy [R]evolution scenario are calculated from the 
percentage of trade which the US has in the IEA scenario at 2020 and 
2030, multiplied by the projected world imports of coal in MTCE from 
the global Energy [R]evolution scenario (Teske et al., 2012).
The proportion of domestic gas production in the Reference scenario 
is taken from the US Energy Information Agency projection (U.S.
Energy Information Administration, 2012); both consumption and 
production has increased more rapidly than projected in the 2011 
World Energy Outlook (International Energy Agency, 2011a). In the 
[R]evolution scenario, gas production is assumed to increase, but only 
to keep pace with consumption. It is assumed that the projected rise in 
production in the US EIA projection would not eventuate if global and 
US consumption increases more slowly. 
The proportion of domestic coal and gas production, and the MTCE 
coal exports in each scenario, are shown in Table 5.3 and 
Table 5.4. It is assumed that the US becomes self-sufficient in gas 
production, but does not become an exporter. 
5.6 adjustment for learning rates – decline factors 
Employment factors are adjusted to take into account the reduction in 
employment per unit of electrical capacity as technologies and 
production techniques mature. The learning rates assumed have a 
significant effect on the outcome of the analysis, and are given in Table 
5.5. These declines rates are calculated directly from the cost data 
used in the Energy [R]evolution modelling for the USA.table 5.5:technology cost decline factors

5future employment |FUTURE EMPLOYMENT IN THE ENERGY SECTOR 
5.7 future employment in the energy sector 
Energy sector jobs in USA are higher in the Energy [R]evolution 
scenario at every stage in the projection. In 2015, extremely strong 
growth in renewable energy in the Energy [R]evolution scenario 
mean overall energy employment increases by 665,300 (61%),
while jobs in the Reference scenario remain static. Jobs in the 
Energy [R]evolution drop between 2020 and 2030, but remain 
414,000 above 2010 levels. Jobs in the Reference scenario are just
27,000 above 2010 levels by 2030.
•In 2015, jobs in the Energy [R]evolution scenario increase 
by 61% to 1.8 million, while jobs in the Reference scenario 
remain static.
• In 2020, there are nearly 2.0 million energy sector jobs in the 
Energy [R]evolution scenario and just over 1.1 million in the 
Reference scenario.
•In 2030, there are approximately 1.5 million jobs in the 
Energy [R]evolution scenario and 1.1 million jobs in the 
Reference scenario.
Figure 5.1 shows the change in job numbers under both scenarios for 
each technology between 2010 and 2030. Jobs in the Reference 
scenario remain relatively constant over the entire period.
In the Energy [R]evolution scenario, energy sector jobs double by 
2015, with 0.7 million additional jobs. Jobs drop between 2015 and 
2030, but despite this are 38% above 2010 levels. Renewable 
energy accounts for 61% of energy jobs by 2030, with solar heat
having the greatest share (18%), followed by geothermal and heat
pump heat and wind.REFERENCE ENERGY

5.8 employment in the renewable heating sector 
Employment in the renewable heat sector includes jobs in 
installation, manufacturing and fuel supply. However, this analysis 
does not capture jobs associated with export of solar thermal heating 
systems, so may be an underestimate of jobs in this sector.
5.8.1 employment in solar heating 
In the Energy [R]evolution scenario, solar heating would provide 16% 
of total heat supply by 2030, and would employ approximately 
266,000 people. Growth is much more modest in the Reference 
scenario, with solar heating providing only 0.3% of heat supply in 
2030. In the Energy [R]evolution scenario, capacity increases by 47 
times over the period, and only 1 fold in the Reference scenario.5.8.2 employment in geothermal and heat pump heating 
In the Energy [R]evolution scenario, geothermal and heat pump heating 
would provide 17% of total heat supply by 2030, and employ 
approximately 202,000 people. Growth is very slow in the Reference 
scenario, with geothermal and heat pump heating providing only 0.1% 
of heat supply, and only employing about 400 people.
5.8.3 employment in biomass heat (fuel supply only)
The Energy [R]evolution and the Reference scenarios are similar,
with biomass heating providing between 6% and 12% of the total
heat supply, and employing from 49,000 to 58,000 people. In 2030 
onwards, employment and capacities are slightly higher in the 
Reference scenario compared to the [R]evolution scenario.

66 5.8.4 employment in biomass 
Electricity generation from biomass stays relatively constant in the Energy 
[R]evolution scenario, with biomass generation increasing from 1.7% in 
2010, to 2.0% in 2030. Job numbers in biomass for electricity and heat
combined reach 118,000 in 2030, 12% higher than in 2010.
In the Reference scenario, biomass generation almost doubles, and 
provides 3.5% of electricity in 2030. Jobs increase by 13% to 
151,000 in 2015, and reach 156,000 by 2030, 17% above 2010 
levels. Jobs in biomass fuels for heating are included here.
5.8.5 employment in solar photovoltaics 
In the Energy [R]evolution scenario, solar photovoltaics grow from less 
than 0.9% of electricity supply in 2010 to provide nearly 11% ofelectricity by 2030. Employment increases to 2020 and then reduces 
somewhat, but is still 38% above 2010 levels by 2030, at 77,800. In 
the Reference scenario, growth is very modest. Solar photovoltaics 
provides 0.9% of generation in 2030, and employs 6,400 people, 72% 
below the number of solar PV jobs in 2010.
5.8.6 employment in wind energy 
In the Energy [R]evolution scenario, wind energy grows very strongly 
and would provide 30% of total electricity generation by 2030, and 
employ approximately 160,000 people. Growth is much more modest
in the Reference scenario, with wind energy providing only 3% of
generation, and employing approximately 20,000 people.5future employment |EMPLOYMENT IN THE RENEWABLE HEATING SECTOR

68 5.8.10 employment in coal 
Coal sector employment in the Energy [R]evolution scenario falls 
by 75% from 2010, to reach 44,400 in 2030. In the same period,
generation drops to 7% of total supply. Coal sector jobs in the 
[R]eference scenario also drop, although much less significantly, to 
reach 147,500 by 2030.
Coal jobs in both scenarios include coal used for heat supply.
5.8.11 employment in gas, oil & diesel 
Gas generation in the Energy [R]evolution scenario is projected to 
be -4% lower in 2030 than in 2010. Jobs are reduced by 188,000 
in the same period. In the Reference scenario, gas generation 
remains relatively constant, and jobs fall by only - 71,600 between 
2010 and 2030, -11% below 2010 levels.5.8.12 employment in nuclear energy 
In the Reference scenario, nuclear power is projected to provide 
19% of the USA’s electricity by 2030. The sector would employ 
approximately 66,500 people. In the Energy [R]evolution scenario,
nuclear power is reduced by 94% over the period. Projected 
employment in the Energy [R]evolution scenario is 98,100, more 
than double the Reference scenario employment in nuclear energy.
This is because of the large number of people employed on 
decommissioning as a result of the rapid program to remove 
nuclear facilities.

71 7.1 the power plant market 1970 to 2012 
A new analysis of the global power plant market shows that since 
the late 1990s, renewable energy especially wind and solar 
photovoltaic installations grew faster than any other power plant
technology across the world – over 630,000 MW total new 
installed capacities between 2000 and 2012. However, it is too 
early to claim the end of the fossil fuel based power generation,
because more than 695,000 MW of new coal power plants were 
built with embedded cumulative emissions of 78 billion tonnes CO 2
over their technical lifetime.
The global market volume of renewable energies in 2012 was on 
average, as much as the total global energy market volume each year 
between 1970 and 2000. There is a window of opportunity for new 
renewable energy installations to replace old plants in OECD countries 
and for electrification in developing countries. However, the window 
will close within the next years without good renewable energy policies 
and legally binding CO 2reduction targets.Between 1970 and 1990, the global power plant market was 
dominated by OECD 35 countries that electrified their economies 
mainly with coal, gas and hydro power plants. The power sector was 
in the hands of state-owned utilities with regional or nationwide 
supply monopolies. The nuclear industry had a relatively short
period of steady growth between 1970 and the mid 1980s - with a 
peak in 1985, one year before the Chernobyl accident - and went
into decline in following years, with no recent signs of growth. 
Between 1990 and 2000, the global power plant industry went
through a series of changes. While OECD countries began to 
liberalize their electricity markets, electricity demand did not match 
previous growth, so fewer new power plants were built. Capital-
intensive projects with long payback times, such as coal and 
nuclear power plants, were unable to get sufficient financial
support. The decade of gas power plants started.

The economies of developing countries, especially in Asia, started 
growing during the 1990s, triggering a new wave of power plant
projects. Similarly to the US and Europe, most of the new markets in 
the USA region of Southeast Asia partly deregulated their power 
sectors. A large number of new power plants in this region were built
from Independent Power Producer (IPPs), who sell the electricity 
mainly to state-owned utilities. The majority of new power plant
technology in liberalized power markets is fueled by gas, except for in 
China which focused on building new coal power plants. Excluding 
China, the rest of the global power plant market has seen a 
significant decline of new coal power plant projects since the late 
1990s with growing gas and renewable generation, particularly wind. 
7.2 power plant markets in the US, Europe and China 
The graphs show how much electricity market liberalization 
influences the choice of power plant technology. While the US and 
European power sectors moved towards deregulated markets, which 
favor mainly gas power plants, China added a large amount of coal
until 2009, with the first signs for a change in favor of renewable 
energy in 2009 and 2010. ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION

72 US: Liberalization of the US power sector started with the Energy 
Policy Act 1992, and became a game changer for the whole sector.
While the US in 2010 is still far away from a fully liberalized 
electricity market, the effect has been a shift from coal and nuclear 
towards gas and wind. Since 2005 wind power plants make up an 
increasing share of the new installed capacities as a result of mainly 
state-based renewable energy support programs. However until end 
2012, USA renewable energy policy has been very insecure therefore 
market volumes especially for solar and wind power fluctuate 
significantly. 2012 was a particular good year both for solar 
photovoltaic and onshore wind.
Europe: About five years after the US began deregulating the power 
sector, the European Community started a similar process with 
similar effect on the power plant market. Investors backed fewer new 
power plants and extended the lifetime of the existing ones. New coal
and nuclear power plants have seen a market share of well below 
10% since then. The growing share of renewables, especially wind 
and solar photovoltaic, are due to a legally-binding target and the 
associated feed-in laws which have been in force in several member 
states of the EU 27 since the late 1990s.

ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION 
A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
74 China: The steady economic growth in China since the late 1990s and 
the growing power demand led to an explosion of the coal power 
plant market, especially after 2002. In 2006 the market hit the peak 
year for new coal power plants: 88% of the newly installed coal
power plants worldwide were built in China. At the same time, China 
is trying to take its dirtiest plants offline, between 2006 and 2010, a 
total of 76,825 MW of small coal power plants were phased out
under the 11 th Five Year Program. While coal still dominates the new 
added capacity with an annual new installed capacity of around 50 
GW each year between 2005 and 2012, wind power is rapidly 
growing as well. Since 2003 the wind market doubled each year to a 
record high of about 18,000 MW 36 by 2010, 49% of the global wind 
market. The following years 2011 and 2012 the market was smaller 
at 17.6 GW and 13.2 GW. Since 2012, a new policy for grid 
connected solar photovoltaic is in force and market growth is 
expected to follow the development of the wind industry between 
2003 and 2010. 7.3 the global market shares in the power plant 
market: renewables gaining ground 
Since the year 2000, the wind power market gained a growing 
market share within the global power plant market. Initially only a 
handful of countries, namely Germany, Denmark and Spain,
dominated the wind market, by the end of 2012 however the wind 
industry is present in 79 countries around the world. Following the 
example of the wind industry, the solar photovoltaic industry 
experienced an equal growth since 2005. Between 2000 and 2012,
29% of all new power plants worldwide were renewable-powered – 
mainly wind – and 37% run on gas. So, two-thirds of all new power 
plants installed globally are gas power plants and renewable, with 
close to one-third as coal. Nuclear remains irrelevant on a global
scale with just 1.7% of the global market share.

75 About 633,000 MW of new renewable energy capacity has been 
installed over the last decade, while 695,000 MW of new coal, with 
embedded cumulative emissions of more than 78 billion tonnes CO 2over 
their technical lifetime, came online – 81% or 563,000 MW in China.
The energy revolution has started on a global level already. This 
picture is even clearer when we look into the global market shares 
but exclude China, the country with where the majority of coalexpansion takes place. About 35% of all new power plants since 
2000 have been renewables and 52% have been gas power plants 
(87% in total). Coal gained a market share of only 11% globally,
if China is excluded in this calculation. Between 2000 and 2012,
China has added over 560,000 MW of new coal capacity: four 
times the entire coal capacity of the EU! However, China has also 
recently kick-started its wind market, and solar photovoltaics is 
expected to follow in the years to come.

A SUSTAINABLE USA ENERGY OUTLOOK 
76 6the silent revolution |THE GLOBAL RENEWABLE ENERGY MARKET IN 2012 
6.4 the global renewable energy market in 2012 
The renewable energy sector has been growing substantially over the 
last 10 years. In 2011, the increases in the installation rates of both 
wind and solar power were particularly impressive. The total amount
of renewable energy installed worldwide is reliably tracked by the 
Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21). Its 
latest global status report (2013) shows how the technologies have 
grown. The following text has been taken from the Renewables 2013 – 
Global Status Report– published in June 2013 with the permit of
REN 21 and is a shortened version of the executive summary.
6.4.1 continued renewable energy capacity growth 
Global demand for renewable energy continued to rise during 2011 
and 2012, supplying an estimated 19% of global final energy 
consumption in 2011 (the latest year for which data are available),
with a little less than half from traditional biomass. Useful heat
energy from modern renewable sources accounted for an estimated 
4.1% of total final energy use, hydropower made up about 3.7%,
and an estimated 1.8% was provided by wind, solar, geothermal,
biomass power, and biofuels. 
Total renewable power capacity worldwide exceeded 1,470 GW in 
2012, up about 8.5% from 2011. Hydropower rose 3% to an 
estimated 990 GW, while other renewables grew 21.5% to exceed 480 
GW. Globally, wind power accounted for about 39% of renewable power 
capacity added in 2012, followed by hydropower and solar PV, each 
accounting for approximately 26%. Renewables made up just over half
of total net additions to electric generating capacity from all sources in 
2012. By year’s end, they comprised more than 26% of global
generating capacity and supplied an estimated 21.7% of global
electricity, with 16.5% of electricity provided by hydropower. Industrial,
commercial and residential consumers are increasingly becoming 
producers of renewable power in a growing number of countries.
Demand continued to rise in the heating and cooling sector, which 
offers an immense, yet mostly untapped, potential for renewable energy 
deployment. Already, heat from modern biomass, solar, and geothermal
sources represents a significant portion of the energy derived from 
renewables, and the sector is slowly evolving as countries begin to enact
support policies. Trends in the sector include the use of larger systems,
increasing use of combined heat and power (CHP), the feeding of
renewable heat and cooling into district schemes, and the growing use 
of modern renewable heat for industrial purposes. After years of rapid 
growth, biodiesel production continued to expand in 2012 but at a 
much slower rate; fuel ethanol production peaked in 2010 and has 
since declined. Small but growing quantities of gaseous biofuels are 
being used to fuel vehicles, and there are limited but increasing 
initiatives to link electric transport systems with renewable energy.
Most technologies continued to see expansion in manufacturing and 
global demand during 2012. However, uncertain policy environments 
and declining policy support affected investment climates in a number 
of established markets, slowing momentum in Europe, China and India.Solar PV and onshore wind power experienced continued price 
reductions due to economies of scale and technology advances, but
also due to a production surplus of modules and turbines. Combined 
with the international economic crisis and ongoing tensions in 
international trade, these developments have created new challenges 
for some renewable industries and equipment manufacturers, leading 
to industry consolidation. However, they also have opened up new 
opportunities and pushed companies to explore new markets.
Subsequently, renewables are becoming more affordable for a broader 
range of consumers in developed and developing countries alike.
Renewables are picking up speed across Asia, Latin America, the 
Middle East, and Africa, with new investment in all technologies. The 
Middle East-North Africa region (MENA) and South Africa, in 
particular, witnessed the launch of ambitious new targets in 2012, and 
the emergence of policy frameworks and renewables deployment.
Markets, manufacturing, and investment shifted increasingly towards 
developing countries during 2012.
The top countries for renewable power capacity at year’s end were 
China, the United States, Brazil, Canada and Germany; the top 
countries for non-hydro capacity were China, the United States and 
Germany, followed by Spain, Italy and India. By region, the BRICS 
nations accounted for 36% of total global renewable power capacity 
and almost 27% of non-hydro renewable capacity. The EU had the 
most non-hydro capacity at the end of 2012, with approximately 
44% of the global total. Renewables represent a rapidly growing 
share of energy supply in a growing number of countries and regions:
•In China, wind power generation increased more than generation 
from coal and passed nuclear power output for the first time.
•In the European Union, renewables accounted for almost 70% of
additions to electric capacity in 2012, mostly from solar PV and 
wind power. In 2011 (the latest data available), renewables met
20.6% of the region’s electricity consumption and 13.4% of
gross final energy consumption.
•In Germany, renewables accounted for 22.9% of electricity 
consumption (up from 20.5% in 2011), 10.4% of national heat
use, and 12.6% of total final energy demand.
•The United States added more capacity from wind power than 
any other technology, and all renewables made up about half of
total electric capacity additions during the year.
•Wind and solar power are achieving high levels of penetration in 
countries like Denmark and Italy, which in 2012 generated 30% 
of electricity with wind and 5.6% with solar PV, respectively.
As their shares of variable wind and solar power increase, a number of
countries (including Denmark, Germany and Spain) have begun to 
enact policies and measures to successfully transform their energy 
systems to accommodate even larger shares. Impacts of all of these 
developments on jobs in the renewable energy sector have varied by 
country and technology, but, globally, the number of people working in 
renewable industries has continued to rise. An estimated 5.7 million 
people worldwide work directly or indirectly in the sector.

6.4.2 an evolving policy landscape 
At least 138 countries had renewable energy targets by the end of
2012. As of early 2013, renewable energy support policies were 
identified in 127 countries, more than two-thirds of which are 
developing countries or emerging economies. The rate of adoption 
of new policies and targets has remained slow relative to the early 
to mid-2000s. As the sector has matured, revisions to historic 
policies have become increasingly common. In response to rapidly 
changing market conditions for renewable technologies, tight
national budgets, and the broader impacts of the global economic 
crisis, some countries undertook extensive revisions to existing laws,
some of which were imposed retroactively. Others increased support
for renewables, and several countries around the world adopted 
ambitious new targets. 
Most policies to support renewable energy target the power sector,
with Feed-in tariffs (FITs) and renewable portfolio standards 
(RPS) used most frequently. During 2012, FIT policies were 
enacted in five countries, all in Africa and the Middle East; the 
majority of FIT-related changes involved reduced support. New 
RPS policies were enacted in two countries. An increasing number 
of countries turned to public competitive bidding, or tendering, to 
deploy renewables. 
In the heating and cooling sector, promotion policies and targets 
continued to be adopted at a slower rate than in the power sector,
although their adoption is increasing steadily. As of early 2013, 20 
countries had specific renewable heating targets in place while at
least 19 countries and states mandated the use of renewable heat
technologies. Renewable heating and cooling are also supported 
through building codes and other measures. Biofuel blend mandates 
were identified at the national level in 27 countries and in 27 
states/provinces. Despite increasing pressure in major markets such 
as Europe and the United States, due to growing debate over the 
overall sustainability of first generation biofuels, regulatory policies 
promoting the use of biofuels existed in at least 49 countries as of
early 2013. 
Thousands of cities and towns around the world have developed 
their own plans and policies to advance renewable energy, and 
momentum accelerated in 2012. To achieve ambitious targets, local
governments adopted a range of measures, including: FITs or 
technology-specific capacity targets; fiscal incentives to support
renewable energy deployment; and new building codes and 
standards, including solar heat mandates. Others developed 
renewable district heating and cooling systems; promoted the use of
renewably-powered electric transport; formed consortia to fund 
projects; or advanced advocacy and information sharing. Several
cities are working with their national governments to promote 
renewable energy, while others have begun to organize from the 
bottom up. In Europe, 1,116 new cities and towns joined the 
Covenant of Mayors in 2012, committing to a 20% CO 2reduction 
target and plans for climate mitigation, energy efficiency, and 
renewable energy.6.4.3 investment trends 
Global new investment in renewable power and fuels was 
US$ 244 billion in 2012, down 12% from the previous year’s 
record. The total was still the second highest ever and 8% above 
the 2010 level. If the unreported investments in hydropower 
projects larger than 50 MW and in solar hot water collectors are 
included, total new investment in renewable energy exceeded 
US$ 285 billion. 
The decline in investment—after several years of growth— resulted 
from uncertainty about support policies in major developed 
economies, especially in Europe (down 36%) and the United States 
(down 35%). Nonetheless, considering only net additions to electric 
generating capacity (excluding replacement plants) in 2012, global
investment in renewable power was ahead of fossil fuels for the 
third consecutive year. 
The year 2012 saw the most dramatic shift yet in the balance of
investment activity between developed and developing economies.
Outlays in developing countries reached US$ 112 billion,
representing 46% of the world total; this was up from 34% in 
2011, and continued an unbroken eight-year growth trend. 
By contrast, investment in developed economies fell 29% to 
US$ 132 billion, the lowest level since 2009. The shift was driven 
by reductions in subsidies for solar and wind project development in 
Europe and the United States; increased investor interest in 
emerging markets with rising power demand and attractive 
renewable energy resources; and falling technology costs of wind 
and solar PV. Europe and China accounted for 60% of global
investment in 2012. 
Solar power was the leading sector by far in terms of money 
committed in 2012, receiving 57% of total new investment in 
renewable energy (96% of which went to solar PV). Even so, the 
USD 140.4 billion for solar was down 11% from 2011 levels, due 
to a slump in financing of CSP projects in Spain and the United 
States, as well as sharply lower PV system prices. Solar was 
followed by wind power (USD 80.3 billion) and hydropower 
projects larger than 50 MW (estimated at USD 33 billion).
6.4.4 rural renewable energy 
The year 2012 saw improved access to modern energy services 
through the use of renewables. Rural use of renewable electricity has 
increased with greater affordability, improved knowledge about local
renewable resources, and more sophisticated technology applications.
Attention to mini-grids has risen in parallel with price reductions in 
solar, wind, inverter, gasification and metering technologies.
Technological progress also advanced the use of renewables in the 
rural heating and cooking sectors. Rural renewable energy markets 
show significant diversity, with the levels of electrification, access to 
clean cookstoves, financing models, actors, and support policies 
varying greatly among countries and regions.

non-violent direct action to tackle the most
crucial threats to our planet’s biodiversity and 
environment. Greenpeace is a non-profit
organization, present in over 50 countries across 
Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and the 
Pacific. It speaks for 2.8 million supporters 
worldwide, and inspires many millions more to 
take action every day. To maintain its 
independence, Greenpeace does not accept
donations from governments or corporations but
relies on contributions from individual supporters 
and foundation grants. Greenpeace has been 
campaigning against environmental degradation 
since 1971 when a small boat of volunteers and 
journalists sailed into Amchitka, an area west of
Alaska, where the US Government was 
conducting underground nuclear tests. This 
tradition of ‘bearing witness’ in a non-violent
manner continues today, and ships are an 
important part of all its campaign work.
