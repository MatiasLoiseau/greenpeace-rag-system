Corporate Welfare for Coal

The biggest coal mining companies depend on subsidized federal coal,
even as they attack federal climate and clean air policies
For decades, the federal coal program has given coal mining companies access to publicly owned
coal at subsidized rates, with minimal consideration of the impacts to communities and the envi-
ronment when that coal is mined, transported, and burned. Access to subsidized federal coal led
to expanded coal mining in Western States, and also encouraged the use of coal generally. Indeed,
when Interior Secretary Sally Jewell announced a moratorium on new federal coal leasing and a
comprehensive review of the federal coal program, she acknowledged that in the past, “our practice
was really about getting as much coal as possible.”1

Whatever logic may have held in the past, a federal program that has flooded the market with sub-
sidized coal is clearly inconsistent with federal policy priorities to address climate change. In that
regard, the moratorium and review of the federal coal program provide an important opportunity to
align the management of federal coal with US commitments to reduce carbon pollution and acceler-
ate the transition toward clean energy.

As the federal government and communities impacted by the coal industry reconsider how to man-
age federal coal, it will also be important to recognize the role of the companies that mine federal
coal. To a significant extent, the federal government has allowed the coal mining industry itself to
manage the development of federal coal, including key decisions about how much coal to lease and
mine. In order to address the many problems with the federal coal program, policy makers must
contend with the impacts of the current corporate control of publicly owned coal.

Access to subsidized federal coal helped some coal mining companies dramatically expand their
coal production, particularly in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. While sever-
al coal mining companies mine federal coal, three companies in particular dominate federal coal
production: Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy. In part because of their access to
subsidized federal coal, these companies have grown to become the three largest coal producers,
accounting for about 40% of all the coal mined in the US.2

However, because the federal government does not publish details showing the quantity of feder-
al coal produced from each coal mine, or by company, the extent to which these companies de-
pend on federal coal has been less clear. This report reveals federal coal production data obtained
through a Freedom of Information Act request, and shows that each of these three coal mining
companies depend on federal coal for the vast majority of the coal they mine in the US. Federal coal
accounted for 88% of Cloud Peak Energy’s total coal production, 83% of Arch Coal’s, and 68% of
Peabody Energy’s total 2014 US coal production. Together, federal coal accounted for 77% of these
three companies’ combined 2014 US coal production.

In effect, these coal mining companies are the beneficiaries of a major corporate welfare program.
Yet even while they’ve grown from their access to subsidized federal coal, these same companies
have attempted to position themselves as victims of the federal government, and continue to try
and block or delay federal policies aimed at addressing climate change and reducing air and water
pollution. As the largest US coal mining companies, Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak
Energy have played a major role in this effort against what some in the industry call a “war on coal.”

Peabody Energy in particular has pursued an aggressive strategy, including legal challenges against
the Clean Power Plan, lobbying, campaign contributions, and misleading public relations efforts. By
providing subsidized access to federal coal to these companies, the federal government has ulti-
mately helped fuel the coal industry’s attacks on federal climate policy.

The moratorium on new coal leases and comprehensive review of the federal coal program provide
an important opportunity for policymakers and communities impacted by the coal industry to con-
sider new approaches. Instead of continuing to give the biggest coal mining companies subsidized
access to billions of tons of publicly-owned coal, the federal government should assert its right –
and responsibility – as owner of one of the largest coal reserves in the world, and manage federal
coal in ways that support US efforts to address climate change, consult with communities impacted
by coal mining and transport, and help ensure a just transition from coal to clean energy.

Most of the coal mined by the three biggest coal companies in the US
belongs to the American public
The US coal mining industry has fought federal policies aimed at addressing climate change and
reducing air and water pollution, sometimes using rhetoric characterizing these health and environ-
mental protections as a “war on coal.” Yet what has often been left out of the public debate around
federal policies affecting the coal industry is that the biggest coal mining companies in the US actu-
ally depend on federal coal for the vast majority of the coal they mine. In fact, federal coal account-
ed for more than three-fourths of the coal mined by the top three coal mining companies in the US,
Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy. While this coal belongs to the American public
and is managed by the Interior Department, mining companies have leased billions of tons at subsi-
dized rates through a process that they have largely controlled.

While the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) tracks the quanti-
ty of federal coal mined by each company in order to assess royalties, that information has not
been made publicly available. This report shows the results of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request for the quantities of federal coal produced by each coal mining company and subsidiary
in 2014. We compiled the data from that FOIA request for each company’s subsidiaries, in order to
calculate the total amount of federal coal mined by Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak
Energy in 2014. Then we compared those results to the total 2014 coal production from each mine
operated by those companies and their subsidiaries, as reported by the Mine Safety and Health
Administration (MSHA), as well as to each company’s total 2014 US coal production as reported in
company 10-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This provides the first
detailed assessment of the extent to which major US coal mining companies depend on federal
coal.

Peabody Energy, the largest US coal mining company, mined a total of 189,500,000 tons of coal in
the US in 2014, according to the company’s 10-K filing with the SEC. FOIA results show that Pea-
body Energy and its subsidiaries mined 129,313,326 tons of federal coal in 2014, 68% of the com-
pany’s total US coal production.

Arch Coal, the second largest US coal mining company, mined a total of 132,614,000 tons of coal in
the US in 2014, according to the company’s 10-K filing with the SEC. FOIA results show that Arch
Coal and its subsidiaries mined 110,132,055 tons of federal coal in 2014, 83% of the company’s
total.

Corporate Welfare for Coalgreenpeace.orgCloud Peak Energy, the third largest US coal mining company, mined a total of 85,800,000 tons of
coal in the US in 2014, according to the company’s 10-K filing with the SEC. FOIA results show that
Cloud Peak Energy and its subsidiaries mined 75,469,617 tons of federal coal in 2014, 88% of the
company’s total.

The combined total US coal production in 2014 from these three companies, Peabody Energy, Arch
Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy, was 407,914,000 tons, which represents over 40% of all the coal
mined in the US in 2014, 1,000,049,000 tons.3 FOIA results show that these three companies mined
314,914,998 tons of federal coal in 2014, 77% of their combined total US coal production. FOIA
results for the three largest companies, organized by subsidiary and parent company, are available
in Appendix 1.

The FOIA results also include federal coal production data for several other smaller coal mining
companies, which along with the three largest companies show 407,039,077 tons of federal coal
mined in 2014. Peabody Energy’s 129,313,326 tons of federal coal production in 2014 repre-
sents 31.8% of that total, while Arch Coal’s 110,132,055 tons was 27%, and Cloud Peak Energy’s
75,469,617 tons was 18.5% of the total. Combined, Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak
Energy accounted for 77.3% of the total federal coal production from all companies and subsidi-
aries that were reported in the FOIA results. The full FOIA results, including federal coal production
data for companies and subsidiaries besides the top three companies that are the focus of this
report, are available in Appendix 4.

The federal coal mined by the top three coal mining companies in 2014
will cause $18.8 billion in damages when burned, using the federal
government’s mid-range social cost of carbon figures
In his January 2016 State of the Union address, President Obama said:
“Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future -- especially in communities that rely
on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don’t show them where the trends are going. That’s
why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better
reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.”4

Several federal government agencies use the Interagency Working Group’s Social Cost of Carbon
figures in order to measure the economic damages that will result from one ton of carbon pollution
in a given year.5 Social cost of carbon figures could be used by the Interior Department to estimate
the costs of federal coal to “taxpayers and our planet.”

Our 2014 report, Leasing Coal, Fueling Climate Change, showed that the Interior Department has
leased 2.2 billion tons of federal coal to the mining industry since the beginning of the Obama ad-
ministration, and calculated the carbon pollution and damages to society that will be caused when
that coal is burned, using the federal government’s social cost of carbon figures.6 The FOIA results
allow similar calculations of the carbon pollution and damages to society from each company’s
2014 federal coal production, again using the federal government’s social cost of carbon figures.

The vast majority, 97%, of these three companies’ combined 2014 federal coal production was from
reserves of sub-bituminous coal in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana, so we use an
emission factor of 1.659 metric tons carbon dioxide per short ton of coal, the same figure used by
the Interior Department in its environmental review of a Powder River Basin coal lease.7 We use the
US Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator to estimate the
equivalent annual emissions from passenger vehicles.8

Peabody Energy’s 2014 federal coal production of 129,313,326 tons resulted in 214,530,808 metric
tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of the annual emissions from over 45 million passenger
vehicles.

Arch Coal’s 2014 federal coal production of 110,132,055 tons resulted in 182,709,079 metric tons of
carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of the annual emissions from over 38 million passenger vehicles.

Cloud Peak Energy’s 2014 federal coal production of 75,469,617 tons resulted in 125,204,095 met-
ric tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of the annual emissions from over 26 million passenger
vehicles.

Combined, these top three US coal mining companies’ 2014 federal coal production of 314,914,998
tons resulted in 522,443,982 metric tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of the annual emis-
sions from over 109 million passenger vehicles.

Note that these carbon pollution figures account only for these companies’ federal coal production,
not the rest of their coal production, and do not include the carbon and methane pollution associat-
ed with the mining, processing, and transporting of the coal.

With these carbon pollution figures for each company’s 2014 federal coal production, we can then
calculate a monetary value for some of the damages to society using the federal government’s so-
cial cost of carbon figures. The mid-range (3% discount rate) social cost of carbon for a metric ton
of carbon pollution emitted in 2015 is $36.

The 214,530,808 metric tons of carbon dioxide from Peabody Energy’s 2014 federal coal produc-
tion would amount to $7,723,109,088 ($7.7 billion) in damages to society, using the federal govern-
ment’s mid-range social cost of carbon figures.

The 182,709,079 metric tons of carbon dioxide from Arch Coal’s 2014 federal coal production would amount
to $6,577,526,844 ($6.5 billion) in damages to society, using the federal government’s mid-range social cost
of carbon figures.

The 125,204,095 metric tons of carbon dioxide from Cloud Peak Energy’s 2014 federal coal produc-
tion would amount to $4,507,347,420 ($4.5 billion) in damages to society, using the federal govern-
ment’s mid-range social cost of carbon figures.

Combined, the 522,443,982 metric tons of carbon dioxide from these top three US coal mining
companies’ 2014 federal coal production would amount to $18,807,983,352 ($18.8 billion) in dam-
ages to society, using the federal government’s mid-range social cost of carbon figures.

The federal government’s social cost of carbon figures also include other cost estimates using
different discount rates. In addition to the “mid-range” estimate of $36 per ton of carbon dioxide
emitted in 2015 using a 3% discount rate, estimates include $11 per ton of carbon dioxide (using a
5% discount rate), $56 per ton (using a 2.5% discount rate), and $105 per ton (using a 3% discount
rate, 95th percentile). Table 1 shows all of the social cost of carbon estimates for each company’s
2014 federal coal production, as well as for the combined total federal coal production for all three
companies and the total federal coal production from all companies reported in the FOIA data.

Even these billion dollar figures represent only a portion of the damages to society from the mining
and burning of this publicly-owned coal. First, these figures account only for the federal coal mined
in a single year, 2014. Moreover, the federal government’s social cost of carbon figures are consid-
ered to be too low by many experts.9 These figures also only account for carbon dioxide emissions

when the coal is burned, not the air and water pollution impacts to communities and the environ-
ment from mercury and other toxins. Even before it is burned, mining and transporting coal disrupts
communities and damages agricultural and public lands. Finally, after it is burned, coal ash pollution
threatens the drinking water and safety of communities around the country.

Of course, these damages are borne by communities and the environment, not the companies that
mine federal coal. As corporations seeking to minimize costs, that is not surprising. But this coal
belongs to the American public and is managed by the Interior Department, so a thorough consider-
ation of these costs should inform federal coal management decisions. Instead, as the next sections
summarize, many of the key decisions about the way this publicly owned coal is managed have
been made by the coal industry, not the federal government.

Federal coal management decisions have been dominated by the coal industry itself
Even while supplying these top three coal mining companies with the majority of the coal they mine,
the federal government has provided very little direction or oversight of the way this publicly owned
coal is managed. The following sections describe a variety of factors that have allowed the feder-
al coal program to be largely run by the coal industry itself, including loopholes within key federal
rules, coal industry influence on state governments where federal coal is mined, lax management
by state Bureau of Land Management offices, and a lack of meaningful oversight from Department
of Interior officials in Washington DC. This is intended as a partial list and summary of some of the
many problems with federal coal management, and additional details are available in several other
reports cited below, as well as in the “Further Reading” section at the end of this report.

Decertification of the Powder River Basin as a coal producing region shifted
management of federal coal to the industry-led “lease by application” process
One key loophole that has allowed the coal industry to dominate federal coal management deci-
sions is that the Powder River Basin is no longer considered a “coal producing region,” despite
being the source of about 40% of US coal production. Since the Powder River Basin was decer-
tified as a coal producing region, federal coal has primarily been leased to coal mining companies
using the “lease by application” process, which gives the industry primary responsibility for deci-
sions about how much, where, and when federal coal should be leased and mined. More details
about the history and impacts of the decertification decision are available in the Institute for Energy
Economics and Financial Analysis report, “The Great Giveaway: An analysis of The United States’
Long-Term Trend of Selling Federally Owned Coal for Less Than Fair Market Value.”10

Under the “lease by application” process, coal mining companies operating in the Powder River
Basin typically select coal leases that neighbor their existing mining operations, which are cheap-
er to exploit than would be the case for other coal mining companies. That has contributed to a
general lack of competition for coal leases, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report
assessing elements of the federal coal program found that about 90% of the coal leases since 1990
involved a single bidder (96 of 107 coal lease sales.)11 The 2.2 billion tons of federal coal that have
been sold since the beginning of the Obama administration under the “lease by application” pro-
cess have averaged $1.03 per ton,12 and in a March 2015 speech, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell
acknowledged that “most Americans would be surprised to know that coal companies can make a
winning bid for about a dollar a ton to mine taxpayer-owned coal.”13

Coal leases for particularly polluting lignite are sold for less than one cent per ton
In fact, many coal leases have been sold for much lower amounts, even for less than one cent per
ton, because state BLM officials have sometimes simply used the minimum price per acre as the
“fair market value” for minimum bids. The GAO report found that “in North Dakota all successful
bonus bids were $100 per acre in nominal dollars, the minimum bid BLM can accept for a lease
tract.” Even though the Interior Department has clear authority to increase minimum bids, the $100
per acre minimum has not even been adjusted for inflation since it was established in 1982.14 Feder-
al coal lease sales in North Dakota are for lignite, also known as brown coal, so the end result is that
particularly polluting coal is leased for a fraction of a cent per ton. The most recent federal lignite
coal lease in North Dakota, in 2010, was sold for $0.005/ton, and the coal lease before that in 2007
was sold for $0.003/ton.15

Royalty rate reductions further subsidize federal coal production
In addition to coal lease sales, which are primarily managed by the Bureau of Land Management,
coal mining companies pay royalties, which are managed by the Office of Natural Resources Rev-
enue (ONRR). Under the Mineral Leasing Act, royalty rates for surface mined coal are supposed to
be a minimum of 12.5%. But in practice, effective royalty rates are much lower because coal mining
companies are often offered royalty rate reductions. A report by Headwaters Economics found an
effective royalty rate of just 4.9% for federal coal mined between 2008 and 2012, amounting to an
average of $1.70 per ton.16 Royalty rate reductions are sometimes approved because of a mining
company’s “financial hardship,” and the Interior Department’s Inspector General report noted that
the responsible BLM officials “generally do not have the expertise to evaluate a company’s financial
statements.”17h

BLM has even proposed royalty rate reduction that would apply retroactively, after the coal has al-
ready been mined. In December 2015, BLM proposed a royalty reduction for 13 million tons of coal
from a Colorado mine that had already been closed, which would effectively subsidize the mining
company by lowering royalties from 8% to 5% for coal that had already been mined and sold.18
After it was publicized, the Interior Department rejected the proposed royalty rate reduction. 19

The coal industry expands access to federal coal with less oversight using lease
modifications
While the “lease by application” process has allowed the coal industry to largely control the man-
agement of federal coal, mining companies are also able to expand existing coal mines with even
less oversight and public participation by using “lease modifications.” While the “lease by appli-
cations” process has been largely uncompetitive, lease modifications allow mining companies to
expand existing mines without any possibility of competition from other mining companies, minimal
review, and even lower prices.

Lease modifications have become more important to the coal mining industry since the 2005 En-
ergy Policy Act, which significantly expanded the maximum acreage for lease modifications from
160 acres to 960 acres. The 2005 Energy Policy Act was influenced by former Vice President Dick
Cheney’s “Energy Task Force” meetings with energy industry interests, including Peabody Energy20
and the National Mining Association.21 Before its inclusion in the 2005 Energy Policy Act, the meas-
ure increasing the maximum acreage for lease modifications was introduced by Wyoming’s Sena-
tors22 and Representative23 as part of the “Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 2005.”

Corporate Welfare for Coalgreenpeace.orgCorporate Welfare for Coal10

The Inspector General report raised concerns about lease modifications, and noted that among the
lease modifications it analyzed, “more than half of the FMVs [fair market value calculations] were for
$100 per acre (the lowest price allowed by regulation) without adequate supporting documentation
for this minimal price.”24 The Interior Department does not publish complete records of coal lease
modifications, and neither did the Inspector General report identifying problems with these under-
valued lease modifications. However, the Inspector General did provide those details in response to
a request from Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), then-chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee. Those details for the 45 lease modifications reviewed by the Inspector General,
including acreage, tonnage, sales price, date, and lessee, are provided in Table 2 below, along with
calculations showing the price per ton for each coal lease modification, totals, and averages. The
original table from the Inspector General’s letter to Senator Wyden is available in Appendix 2.

These records show that coal mining companies obtained over 192 million tons of federal coal
through these 45 coal lease modifications, at an average price of $0.16 per ton of coal. Table 2 also
shows how coal mining companies moved to take advantage of the increased maximum acreage
limits, beginning with Arch Coal’s 487 acre tract containing 2.3 million tons of coal in 2007. (Arch
Coal lobbied on the Coal Lease Amendments Act, according to the Center for Responsive Poli-
tics).25 After this, most coal lease modifications were for tracts of land well over the earlier 160 acre
limit, with 19 of the 25 coal lease modifications (76%) greater than the earlier acreage limit. The
average acreage for these coal lease modifications increased from 84 to 422 acres, and allowed
coal mining companies to obtain significantly more federal coal using coal lease modifications and
thereby minimize oversight, environmental reviews, and competition. Beginning with that first Arch
Coal lease modification until the end of the Inspector General review period in 2012, mining compa-
nies obtained over 170 million tons of federal coal using coal lease modifications, eight times more
than the 21 million tons of coal obtained from 2001 until 2007.

Coal companies receive further subsidies from state governments,
including avoiding requirements to post bonds for their mine reclamation
obligations
While the Interior Department is responsible for managing federal coal, the state in which federal
coal is mined receives half of the royalties. Federal coal mining occurs mostly in Western States, with
the vast majority of federal coal production in the Powder River Basin region of Wyoming and Mon-
tana, as well as significant amounts in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and North Dakota, and small-

er amounts in other states. While the Interior Department has allowed the coal mining industry to
largely run the federal coal mining process, state governments have sometimes gone beyond even
this lax approach. For example, states like Utah 26 and Wyoming 27 have sought to use state funds to
subsidize coal export proposals in Washington, Oregon, and California that would ship federal coal
to Asia.

Another major way that the state of Wyoming has subsidized federal coal mining is by allowing coal
mining companies to avoid posting bonds to pay for mine reclamation as required by the Surface
Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Instead, Wyoming’s Department of Environmental Quality
(DEQ) has allowed coal mining companies to “self-bond,” using their supposed financial strength, or
even that of a subsidiary, as an indication of the company’s ability to reclaim its mines. One report,
“Assessing Thermal Coal Production Subsidies,” estimated that self-bonding in the Powder River
Basin amounted to a subsidy of $0.78 for each ton of coal. 28

This practice of self-bonding has come under increased scrutiny as coal mining companies like Arch
Coal and Alpha Natural Resources have filed for bankruptcy, raising concerns that taxpayers could
end up footing the bill for mine reclamation - exactly what the Surface Mining Control and Recla-
mation Act sought to avoid. Secretary Jewell highlighted those concerns in testimony to the House
Natural Resources Committee: “With the increased financial fragility of many coal mining compa-
nies, if they are self-bonded that does potentially leave the states and the taxpayers at risk.” 29
After acknowledging that Alpha no longer qualified for self-bonding, Wyoming regulators ordered
the company to post bonds for the $411 million it owes to reclaim its Wyoming mines. But Wyo-

Arch Coal’s bankruptcy has raised concerns about the company’s ability to pay for its reclamation
obligations at its Black Thunder mine in Wyoming, one of the largest strip mines in the world

ming’s Governor undermined that effort, and instead announced a deal that would require just $61
million for the company’s mine reclamation, less than 15% of the company’s obligation. 30 However,
federal regulators at the Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation Enforcement (OSMRE) did not
sanction the deal, and notified Wyoming that its deal with Alpha, as well as its failure to require Arch
Coal to post a sufficient bond for its mine reclamation, may violate the law. 31 In its response to OS-
MRE, Wyoming regulators acknowledged “systemic problems with self-bonding,” yet also rejected
OSMRE concerns that the deal with Alpha may violate the law. 32 Following its letters to Wyoming,
OSMRE also notified state regulators in Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico that Peabody Energy
may no longer qualify for self-bonding. 33

While Wyoming regulators have now acknowledged “systemic problems” with its self-bonding pro-
gram, the state has not suggested how it will address those problems in order to protect taxpayers
and the environment, even though organizations representing landowners in the region such as the
Western Organization of Resource Councils have warned the state about these problems for several
years. In light of the efforts by Wyoming’s Governor and regulators to prioritize the interests of the
coal industry ahead of other concerns, federal regulators will likely need to increase their involvement
and intervene to enforce the requirements of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.

More information about coal mine reclamation and problems with self-bonding is available in “Un-
dermined Promise II,” a report by the Western Organization of Resource Councils, National Wildlife
Federation, and Natural Resources Defense Council. 34

Coal companies provide data to the Interior Department about federal
coal leases, and have significantly underestimated the quantity of coal in
some leases
Another example of the extent to which the coal industry has dominated federal coal management
is that coal companies supply the data to the government about the quantity and quality of federal
coal within lease tracts they hope to mine. And data revealed by the Interior Department’s Inspector
General show that coal mining companies have significantly underestimated the amounts of coal in
several cases. For example, as shown in Table 3 below, a coal lease to expand a Peabody Energy
subsidiary’s mine in Colorado was estimated to contain 1.4 million tons of coal and was sold for
$350,000, or $0.25 per ton. But Peabody’s subsidiary actually ended up mining more than 2.5 million
tons of federal coal from that lease, so the lease sale price amounted to just $0.13 per ton.

The Inspector General’s report explained the overall concern:

“Before a lease sale takes place, a mining company explores the site for the existence and extent of
coal seams, including the energy content and quality of the coal. The mining company is required to
furnish the information to BLM, which helps form the basis of BLM’s FMV determination. BLM, how-
ever, does not independently verify the data, relying instead on test results supplied by the mining
company.” 35

The Inspector General’s report also noted that “a company could provide incorrect data to BLM, re-
sulting in BLM’s undervaluing the FMV and unknowingly accepting a low bid.” Although the Inspec-
tor General did not include the data in its report, it did respond to Senator Wyden’s letter with a table
showing “Coal Leases that May Have Underestimated Reserves at Time of Sale.” The data from that
table is reproduced below in Table 3, along with additional columns to show the difference (in tons)
between the amount of coal estimated at the time of the lease sale and the amount of coal actually

mined, as well as to show the impact of these underestimates in terms of the price per ton. Totals
and averages are also calculated, showing that coal mining companies mined nearly 70 million more tons
of coal from these 15 coal lease sales than what the companies estimated was contained in them. The original
table from the Inspector General’s letter to Senator Wyden is available in Appendix 3.

Instead of subsidizing increased coal mining and the coal industry’s
political attacks, federal coal management should support US efforts to
address climate change
While Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy have grown in part because of their ac-
cess to subsidized federal coal, as well as significant control over how federal coal is managed, these
companies have nevertheless sought to portray themselves as the victims of federal regulations. And
these companies have led the coal industry’s efforts to block federal climate and clean air policies.
Peabody Energy and Arch Coal spent more on lobbying than any other coal mining company,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics.36

As the largest coal mining company, Peabody Energy in particular has played a central role in the
coal industry’s attacks, including challenging the Clean Power Plan in court.37 Peabody also contin-
ues to rely on climate change denial38 and other misleading public relations efforts,39 and was recently
investigated by the New York Attorney General for misleading investors and regulators about the
risks of climate change policies to its business.40 The coal industry’s efforts to block federal climate
and clean air policies may not be surprising, but it is noteworthy that these coal industry attacks have
been partially financed by these companies’ access to subsidized federal coal.

Instead of continuing to subsidize increased coal production and the coal industry’s political attacks,
the Interior Department should realign the management of federal coal by consulting with communi-
ties impacted by coal mining and transport, helping ensure a just transition from coal to clean energy,
and supporting US commitments to address climate change. A former Interior Department Deputy
Secretary and a former economic adviser to President Obama have suggested a “carbon adder”
to incorporate the federal government’s social cost of carbon figures into federal coal management
decisions and royalty rates.41 Issues surrounding this approach have been studied by the Institute for
Policy Integrity,42 Vulcan Philanthropy,43 and others.

Ultimately, federal coal management must be reconciled with the reality that the vast majority of US
coal reserves cannot be mined and burned. The US holds the largest coal reserves in the world, and
a study published in Nature44 showed that in order to avoid an increase in global warming above
2 degrees Celsius, over 90% of US coal reserves must remain in the ground.45 The President and
Interior Department have clear authority to end new federal coal leasing, which is detailed in a report
by the Center for Biological Diversity.46 That authority has also been acknowledged by Cloud Peak
Energy, the company most dependent on federal coal, which warned investors in its 10-K filing with
the SEC: “There is no requirement that the federal government must lease its coal.”47

Federal coal production data for each company’s subsidiaries are from the results of a Greenpeace FOIA
request to the US Interior Department, the full results of which are published in Appendix 4. Total US coal
production figures for Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Cloud Peak Energy come from company 10-K
filings with the SEC for the year ending December 31, 2014:

Page 34 of Peabody Energy’s 10-K reports a total 2014 coal production of 227.2 million tons, of which
37.7 million tons was from mines in Australia, for a total US coal production of 189.5 million tons. https://
www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1064728/000106472815000021/btu-20141231x10k.htm
Page 61 of Arch Coal’s 10-K reports a total 2014 coal production of 132,614,000.million tons. https://
www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037676/000104746915001419/a2223254z10-k.htm
Page 4 of Cloud Peak Energy’s 10-K reports that the company sold 87.1 million tons of coal in 2014,
of which 0.2 million was resold coal mined by other companies. 1.1 million tons was from the Deck-
er Mine, which is not included in the company’s total for this report because Cloud Peak held a
