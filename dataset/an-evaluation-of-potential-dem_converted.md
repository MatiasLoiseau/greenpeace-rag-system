An Evaluation of Potential Demand for
Renewable Generation
 H.R. 2454 (Waxman-Markey) Renewable Electricity Standard vs.
Existing State Renewable Portfolio Standards

Prepared for Greenpeace
September 25, 2009

Overview

(cid:1) Task

– Conduct a comparative analysis of renewable generation requirements under the
proposed H.R. 2454 (Waxman-Markey) Renewable Electricity Standard (RES)
and renewable generation requirements under existing state Renewable Portfolio
Standards (RPS)

(cid:1) Assumptions were derived from EIA and EPA analyses of the

Waxman-Markey bill

– EIA: Energy Market and Economic Impacts of H.R. 2454, the American Clean

Energy and Security Act of 2009

• Released July 2009; Modified August 5, 2009

• Forecasts through 2030

– EPA: Analysis of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 H.R. 2454

in the 111th Congress

• Released June 23, 2009

• Forecasts through 2025

Renewable Generation Demand under Federal
RES vs. State RPS - Evaluation Methodology

(cid:1) Federal RES Analysis

– Relied upon EPA and EIA projections:

• Average annual retail demand growth

• New nuclear and coal + carbon capture and storage (CCS) generation

– Assumed that Federal RES applies to 78% of LSEs (those with 4 million MWh +

of annual generation)
(cid:1) State RPS demand analysis

– Relied upon EIA 2007 base energy sales data by load-serving entity (LSE)

• Source: EIA, “Table 10. Class of Ownership, Number of Bundled Ultimate Consumers,

Revenue, Sales, and Average Retail Price for All Sectors by State, Utility, 2007.”

– Evaluated how RPS regulations impact LSEs

• Sources of RPS demand regulations: various, including state legislature and regulatory
agency websites, Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), LBNL, and DSIRE database.

• Where RPS requirements are mandated as shares of final sales, the RPS is determined
by projecting total energy sales from affected load-serving entities (LSE), multiplied by
LSE-level RPS percentage requirement as per relevant state legislation.

HR 2454: American Clean Energy and Security
Act of 2009 (Waxman-Markey Bill)

(cid:1) Approved by the House on June 26, 2009.
(cid:1) Combined Efficiency and Renewable Electricity Standard - CERES (Title I,

Subtitle A, Sec. 101)

– Requires retail electricity providers to meet a minimum share of sales with electricity savings

and qualifying renewable generation by holding tradable credits.

– Nominal targets begin at 6% in 2012 and rise to 20% by 2020.

– Qualifying renewable resources include new and existing solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas,

qualified waste-to-energy1, geothermal, and qualified hydroelectric.2

– Retailers selling less than 4 million MWh per year are exempted from CERES.

– Up to 25 percent of the target may be met with electricity savings (Governors may petition to

raise this amount to 40 percent).

– Sales of generation from new nuclear, new coal with carbon-capture and sequestration

(CCS), and existing hydropower capacity are deducted from each retail provider’s total sales
for assessing the CERES requirement

1 Qualified waste-to-energy means energy from the combustion of municipal solid waste or construction, demolition, or disaster debris, or from the
gassification or pyrolization of such waste or debris and the combustion of the resulting gas at the same facility. For further information see HR 2454
subsection(a)(13).

2 Qualified hydropower means energy produced from increased efficiency achieved, or additions of capacity made on or after Jan.1,1988 at a
hydroelectric  facility or dam placed in service before that date.  For further information see HR 2454 subsection (a)(12).

State Renewable Portfolio Standards

(cid:1) 29 states plus the District of Columbia have passed mandatory renewable
generation requirements or goals and 5 more have passed voluntary
standards or goals.

(cid:1) The design of each RPS varies by target and timing, the types of renewable
generation allowed, the geographic scope within which a generator might be
eligible to meet the standard, and the types enforcement mechanisms and
escape clauses included.

Demand for Renewable Generation under Existing
State RPS

(cid:1) Assuming EIA and EPA demand growth estimates, demand for renewable generation under state

renewable portfolio standards around the U.S. ranges from approximately 16,000 TWh (roughly 5%
of base retail demand) to over 40,000 TWh (roughly 10% of base retail demand) between 2012
and 2030.

(cid:1) EPA and EIA annual average demand growth projections are slightly different (0.57% v. 0.64%

respectively)

State RPS v. Waxman-Markey Federal RES

(cid:1) When using EIA and EPA assumptions, the demand ultimately created for
renewable generation through the proposed Waxman-Markey Federal RES
is somewhat weaker than that created by existing state RPS programs.
(cid:1) The following exhibit provides an overview of the provisions included in

CERES that diminish the projected demand for renewables.

(cid:1) The following comparative analysis provides a more in depth review of how
these factors reduce the ultimate demand for renewables under the CERES
provision of H.R. 2454 and how that effective demand relates to that
projected to develop under existing state RPS programs.

Conclusions

State RPS vs. Waxman-Markey Federal RES
Conclusions

(cid:1) The effective demand for renewable generation under a federal

standard falls short of that projected to develop under existing state
programs in the EIA case.  In the EPA case there is a shortfall in
early years but in outer years this shortfall is eliminated.  The extent
of the shortfalls in the EPA case are less significant than that found
in the EIA case.

(cid:1) Given that EPA and EIA demand growth projections are very similar,
the difference in the extent and timing of the projected shortfalls can
be explained by the notable differences between EPA and EIA
projections of new nuclear and coal + CCS generation.  These
differences and their impacts are shown in the next two exhibits.
