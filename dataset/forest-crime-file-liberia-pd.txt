Liberian timber trade
fuels regional insecurity 
Liberian logging: destroying forests and funding war
“There is overwhelming evidence that the Liberian backed RUF are still operational,
nurtured by Taylor and his primary funders – Liberia’s logging companies andshipping register. While the logging industry poses a threat to the future of theLiberian forests, both pose a critical risk to national and regional security.” 
Global Witness, Taylor Made: the pivotal role of Liberia’s forests and Flag of Convenience in regional conflict
September 2001
Logging is a lucrative business in poverty-stricken Liberia and has long been one of the
prime sources of government revenue. Indeed, while Liberia’s estimated Gross DomesticProduct (GDP) in 2000 was only around US$450 million, well over US$100 million of thiswas raised by the forestry sector in 2000.
1Following a United Nations (UN) ban on all
diamond exports from Liberia in March 2001, logging has become the single largest sourceof export earnings for the Liberian government.
2But at what cost?
Recent reports by a Panel of Experts to the UN Security Council (UNSC) reveal that the
Liberian timber industry is involved in both environmental destruction and human rightsabuses. This includes driving the destruction of the Liberia’s remaining forests and illegalarms trafficking to Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone.
3Furthermore,
according to articles published in the Washington Post and the Mail & Guardian in 2001,
the illicit diamond trade between Sierra Leone and Liberia has been instrumental inlaundering capital on behalf of the international terrorist network Al- Qaeda. Kouwenhovenhas been named as a key actor in this illicit diamond trade.

Liberia’s ancient forests 
After years of over-harvesting throughout western Africa, Liberia’s forest now represents
almost half of what remains of the Upper Guinean Forest Ecosystem, a rainforest belt thatonce covered the whole of Liberia, plus parts of Sierra Leone, Guinea, the Ivory Coast,Ghana and Togo. It has been identified as one of 25 threatened biodiversity ‘hotspots’globally, and supports many species that are found nowhere else.
5 
This forest is home to some 9,000 species of plants and more than 1,300 species of
vertebrate animals. It supports the only viable populations of the pygmy hippopotamus(Hexaprotodon liberiensis) and represents the last stronghold of the forest elephant(Loxodonta africana cyclotis) in West Africa.

/telhandsetcirc+31 20 523 62 22www.greenpeace.orgLiberia’s forest is also the lifeline of the country’s indigenous communities. The forest
provides shelter for their physical, cultural and religious life, including hosting shrines,traditional bush schools and cover for streams. It is also a vital source of foods, medicinalherbs and other materials.
Industrial logging has already destroyed much of the accessible lowland and coastal regions
of West Africa’s tropical forests. It is estimated that almost 90% of these forests have alreadybeen destroyed and what remains is heavily fragmented.
7
The threat of logging
The future of Liberia’s remaining forest is now in serious doubt. The European
Commission’s Joint Research Centre (ECJRC) has recently reported high levels ofdeforestation in Liberia’s remaining lowland rainforests. Intensive industrial logging wasnamed as the primary cause of forest loss.
9 Meanwhile, just one company – the Oriental
Timber Company (OTC) – has recently been granted logging rights to one third (1.6 million
hectares) of the Liberia’s remaining 4.8 million hectares of forest. According to the LiberianForest Development Authority (FDA), a total of three million hectares of the forest (around63%) have already been allocated to logging.

Timber Export Values – Liberia 1996-2000
Source: World Trade Atlas cited in Global Witness (2001)
Recent figures reveal that the Liberian timber trade has expanded dramatically over the last
five years. The income generated by timber exports has risen from US$5 million to at leastUS$100 million a year.
11This rapid expansion has resulted in an industry that is essentially
unregulated.
The implications of an unregulated industry operating this level of forest exploitation are severe,
and hold the potential for wiping out vital ancient forest habitats and the endangered speciesthat depend upon them, for displacing communities and for leading to long-term consequencesof deforestation including floods, droughts and changes in regional and global climate.

/telhandsetcirc+31 20 523 62 22www.greenpeace.orgKey players in the scandal: 
Liberian timber barons and the international markets
In December 2000, a report submitted by a Panel of Experts to the UN Security Council
(UNSC) named Liberia’s timber industry as one of several regional players involved inillegally supplying arms to Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels fighting the governmentforces and UN peacekeepers in the war-torn neighbouring country of Sierra Leone. Thesupply of arms to the RUF broke UN sanctions banning weapons transfers to the country.
12
The report revealed that the Liberian timber industry was involved in a series of illicit
activities, including the acquisition of weapons, and noted that logging roads were also usedto move weapons from Liberia to Sierra Leone. It therefore recommended a temporaryembargo on Liberian timber exports “until Liberia could convincingly demonstrate that itwas no longer involved in the trafficking of arms to, or diamonds from, Sierra Leone”.
13But
in early 2001, China and France – together responsible for two-thirds of Liberia’s timberexports – objected, and the timber clauses were subsequently dropped from the final report.
14
Since then, the UK-based environmental and human rights organization Global Witness and
the UNSC have both released compelling evidence of the continued involvement of Liberia’spresident Charles Taylor and the Liberian timber industry in the illegal trade in arms.
15 
Their investigations have revealed that:
• taxes from the logging industry have been used by Taylor to maintain brutal paramilitary
units involved in human rights abuses
• Taylor tried to acquire several thousand AK-47 assault rifles and an unknown quantity
of rocket-propelled grenades from Libya in May 2001
• logging companies have been recruiting and arming ex-combatants, often from Taylor’s
now- defunct National Patriotic Front, to build up private militias
• a number of companies employ indiscriminate logging practices, which show no regard
for their environmental or social impact
Van Kowenhoven who runs
OTC and other timbercompanies
“Van Kouwenhoven is
responsible for thelogistical aspects of manyof the arms deals.Through his interests in a… timber project inLiberia [OTC], heorganizes the transfer ofweaponry from Monroviainto Sierra Leone. Roadsbuilt and maintained fortimber extraction are alsoconveniently used forweapons movementwithin Liberia, and for theonward shipment ofweapons to SierraLeone.”

/telhandsetcirc+31 20 523 62 22www.greenpeace.orgLiberia’s timber barons
The UNSC and Global Witness reports have produced strong evidence that several of the twenty-
five companies producing timber in Liberia are guilty of causing environmental damage, abusinghuman rights, running private militia or trafficking illegal arms to RUF rebels in Sierra Leone.
The largest – OTC – is also the most notorious. Other companies implicated in one or more
of these scandals include the Royal Timber Corporation (RTC), Mohammed Group ofCompanies (MGC), the Inland Logging Company (ILC) and the United Logging Company(ULC).
16In addition, the UNSC 2000 report named three companies – Exotic and Tropical
Timber Enterprise (ETTE), Forum Liberia and OTC – as “providing a large amount of
unrecorded extra budgetary income to President Taylor for unspecified purposes”.17
Table 1: Some key players in Liberia’s timber scandals
Logging company Description
Oriental Timber Company (OTC) Run by Dutch national Gus Kouwenhoven – a close associate of
President Charles Taylor – OTC is by far the largest and most notoriouslogging company operating in Liberia.
18 Kouwenhoven has been
described as “responsible for the logistical aspects of many of the arms
deals [with the RUF in Sierra Leone]”.
Royal Timber Corporation (RTC) Gus Kouwenhoven also runs RTC, the second largest timber operation
in Liberia. RTC is believed to have vastly under-reported its timber
production over the last two years. 
Mohammed Group Mohammed Salamé, Liberian ambassador-at-large based in the Ivory of Companies (MGC) Coast, has been involved in aiding sanctions-busting arms transfers to
Liberia. He owns two companies, Salami Molowi Inc (SMI) and Bureaux
Ivorian Ngorian (BIN). 
Inland Logging Company (ILC) Maurice and Oscar Cooper, both long-term associates of President
Taylor, manage ILC. The company reports that it exported around
20,000m3 of logs in 2000; indications are that this figure was nearer50,000m3. ILC has a private militia which harass and intimidate local
communities in Sinoe county.
United Logging Company (ULC) Owned by Hussein Fawaz, who also owns Maryland Wood Processing
Industry (MWPI) – together the two companies export more than 13% ofLiberia’s timber. The Chairman of ULC is the son of President Taylor,Charles ‘Chuckie’ Taylor Jr, whom the UN has banned from travelling
because of his involvement with arms trafficking.
Sources: UNSC (2000); UNSC (2001); Global Witness (2001)19
Gus Kouwenhoven’s Oriental Timber Company 
By far the largest and most notorious logging company in Liberia, Gus Kouwenhoven’s OTC
is characterized by corruption, illegality and a total disregard for the environmental or socialimpact of its operations. 
The company is believed to have paid President Taylor between US$3 million and US$5
million for its massive concession – the largest in Liberia’s history. Although the concession isnot legally valid and has never been ratified by the Liberian congress, OTC opens upbetween 5,000 and 10,000 hectares of undisturbed forest life every month.
20Each year,
hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of Liberia’s forest is exported as OTC logs toconsumer countries such as China, Italy and France.

/telhandsetcirc+31 20 523 62 22www.greenpeace.orgOTC also violates national and international labour laws, particularly regarding worker
safety. In addition, it has shown a total disregard for the rights and customs of local people.Local government officials and Liberian Forest Development Authority representativesinspecting the company’s interests have been met with police intimidation and arrest. Theprivate militia it operates to protect its holdings are armed with AK-47 assault rifles.
Kouwenhoven has been described by the UNSC as “responsible for the logistical aspects of
many of the arms deals [with the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone]”.
21He also
runs the Royal Timber Corporation (RTC) in the northwest of the country, strategicallylocated on the border with Sierra Leone. In March 2001, the UN imposed sanctions onLiberia for its role in blocking Sierra Leone’s peace process. The measures imposed includedrestricting the travel of certain individuals, of whom Kouwenhoven was one.
Public outcry against OTC has been widespread in both the national and international press.
Yet President Taylor continues to defend the company, and has responded to criticism by
removing people from office, and using police intimidation and arrests.
The export market – driving the destruction
At least 70% of the wood produced in Liberia is destined for the export market.23The key
actors driving this destructive, corrupt and destabilizing industry are the countries andcompanies importing the timber.
Liberia’s main log exports have traditionally been to Europe. More recently, however, the
market has shifted with companies such as OTC beginning to tap into the rapidly growingChinese market. 
While sources of trade data vary considerably, recent figures show that China (45%) is by
far the largest importer of Liberian timber, followed by France (26%) and Italy (12%). Intotal, the EU is responsible for around 52% of imports.
24
Despite a series of high profile Greenpeace protests between July 2000 and December 2001,
which highlighted the illegal activities of OTC and other companies involved in theinternational timber trade, significant volumes of OTC and/or RTC logs have recently beenlocated in China, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Greece.

Greenpeace International Keizersgracht 176, 1016 DW Amsterdam, The Netherlands
/telhandsetcirc+31 20 523 62 22www.greenpeace.orgOne of the most important buyers of OTC/RTC logs in Europe is the Danish multinational
timber trader DLH Nordisk.25Listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, DLH Nordisk has
offices in 24 countries worldwide, making it one of the world’s largest international timbertraders. Its major markets are the US, Denmark and France, with Europe accounting formore than two-thirds of all DLH sales.
26
Following investigations by Greenpeace and other NGOs, DLH was exposed, in July 2001,
as a major buyer of logs from OTC and RTC.27DLH claimed it would suspend buying from
OTC. DLH made it clear that “they do not want to purchase wood from companies whichviolate human rights or have destructive logging practices as this would not be compatiblewith DLH’s basic values”. The company announced a full investigation and a reassessmentof its position with regard to Liberia. In October 2001, a new UNSC report againdocumented the role of Gus Kouwenhoven and provided further evidence of OTC’s role inarms trafficking. Independent investigations by Global Witness also revealed ongoing socialconflicts in OTC’s operations.
28
In February 2002, Greenpeace again exposed that DLH’s continuing purchase of large
quantities of logs from OTC and RTC.29Recent Greenpeace investigations reveal that OTC
logs bought by DLH no longer carry the clear OTC marking. OTC is now selling its logsthrough the Evergreen Trading Corporation (ETC), a company that shares the same address.
Another company also buying from OTC is the Greece-based plywood and flooring
producer Shelman. Sourcing logs from OTC, MGC and ULC, Shelman sells processed wood– as plywood, flooring, chipboard, veneers, sawn timber and mouldings – all over the world.A large proportion of its sales are within Greece itself, but the US and Canada are alsoconsumers, especially for flooring.
30
Other companies known to be buying logs from these companies include the Dutch logger
and importer Wijma (buying from OTC and RTC), the German logging and processingcompanies Feldmeyer-Group  (buying from RTC through its trade subsidiary ‘tt’) andDanzer-Group (buying from OTC and ILC through its trade subsidiary IHC-Interholco),
31
the Italian producer of railway sleepers Tecnoalp (which bought from OTC in 2001) and
many more throughout Europe.
Any company buying from these suppliers should therefore be aware that it may be
contributing to the destruction of Liberia’s forests or even be buying from OTC, RTC orother Liberian companies implicated in the environmental and social scandals uncovered byorganisations such as the UNSC and Global Witness.

Greenpeace call for action
Liberian logging companies have been implicated in illegal and destructive logging. In
addition, their role as a threat to regional security and human rights has been exposed. In therun up to the United Nations’ forthcoming Ancient Forest Summit
32, Rio+1033and beyond,
Greenpeace is urging governments of all importing countries to immediately stop their role inthe destruction of Liberian forests by committing to the following principles: 
• stop the destruction
by stopping any further industrial activities in intact ancient forest until responsible plans
for forest conservation and sustainable use have been agreed.
• clean up the timber trade
by ensuring that timber is produced and traded in a legal and ecologically responsible 
way;by refusing to trade with companies known to be operating illegally or destructively;and by demanding that all wood and wood products entering national ports must come from legal and well-managed forest operations according to high social and ecological standards.
34
• come up with the money
by providing at least US$15 billion each year to pay for forest conservation and 
sustainable development.
