THE ILLEGAL FISHING AND
FORCED LABOR PREVENTION ACT:
A BILL TO COMBAT ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED, AND UNREGULATED FISHING
AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AT SEA

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, a top threat to ocean ecosystems and
global food security, is inextricably linked to human rights abuses at sea. Workers on
fishing vessels around the world routinely deal with multiple abuses at sea—withholding of
pay, debt bondage, beatings, excessive working hours, and much more. IUU fishing, human
trafficking, and forced labor in the seafood industry are human rights and environmental
crises that demand swift action.

Fishing operations that engage in human trafficking and
forced labor are often the same ones that ignore fisheries
management regulations and laws. Illegal fishing is not
a small problem. Of the annual global seafood catch, an
estimated one-third—as much as 56 billion pounds—
is illegally fished.1 IUU fishing contributes greatly to
overfishing, which has impacted fisheries around the world.
Depletion of nearshore fisheries resources exacerbates
human rights abuses, forcing vessels to travel farther and
remain out at sea longer, raising costs, and increasing
incentives to engage in illegal labor practices and abuses.

As it becomes harder to find laborers willing to voluntarily
work in these conditions, more operators resort to human
trafficking to assemble crews. Further, demand in the U.S.
and elsewhere for cheap seafood contributes to low prices in
some markets that do not reflect the true cost of production.

The United States imports more seafood than any other
single nation in the world and is thus in a unique position to
deal with these intertwined crises. Lack of action means U.S.
dollars are perpetuating these problems. With its strength of
governance and ample resources, the United States should
be able to reject illegally fished and unethically harvested

seafood from its commerce stream. Yet, according to a recent
report by the U.S. International Trade Commission, the
United States imported an estimated $2.4 billion worth of
seafood derived from IUU fishing in 2019.2

By requiring information about the origins of seafood and its
supply chains, tracking seafood from boat to plate, expanding
transparency, and working with other countries to drive
changes on the water, the United States could lead in the
fight against IUU fishing, forced labor, and other human
rights abuses. Congress and federal agencies have laid the
groundwork with initiatives such as the Seafood Import
Monitoring Program and capacity-building with other nations
under international agreements. Much work remains to be
done, however, to effectively deter IUU fishing, protect basic
human rights in the seafood industry, and close our markets
to illegally sourced products.

The Illegal Fishing and Forced Labor Prevention
Act provides a comprehensive approach for the
U.S. government to tackle these global crises.

The Illegal Fishing and Forced Labor Prevention Act
represents a significant step forward in explicitly linking
illegal fishing to forced labor in the seafood industry,
enhancing traceability and transparency in seafood supply
chains, and strengthening enforcement against IUU fishing
and associated labor abuses.

IMPROVING THE UNITED STATES’ TRACEABILITY
SYSTEM FOR SEAFOOD IMPORTS
The Illegal Fishing and Forced Labor Prevention Act fills
key gaps in the Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP),
which currently requires importers of some seafood products
to report certain supply chain data to verify legality. The
bill takes a critical step in making seafood supply chains
more traceable by expanding the SIMP to require reporting
for imports of all species. The current program applies to
only 40 percent of imported seafood, a glaring loophole that
IUU fishing operations exploit by deliberately misreporting
species to escape regulation.

Expanding the SIMP to all seafood would allow U.S. Customs
and Border Protection (CBP) to use the Tariff Act, a law
prohibiting imports produced by forced labor, to block or
seize all seafood imports that may have been produced in this
way. To enforce the Tariff Act, a product must be traceable
from the point in the supply chain where the forced labor
is occurring to the point of importation. Currently, some
seafood known to be harvested by forced labor is not fully
traceable to the vessels (the site of the forced labor), and
CBP is therefore unable to determine if such tainted goods
are entering the U.S. market. Since the SIMP requires

traceability from the vessel to the point of entry into U.S.
commerce, it is a necessary tool for CBP to exclude seafood
that may have been produced by forced labor. Expanding
the SIMP to all species would close the U.S. market for the
remaining 60 percent of seafood that could be produced by
forced labor.

The legislation requires a rulemaking process for the SIMP
to mandate reporting of data relating to labor conditions in
the seafood supply chain. It further requires importers to
provide additional supply chain data at the time of entry—
transshipment information (e.g., when seafood is moved from
one vessel to another at sea), more granular information
about the location of the harvest, and information about
vessel ownership to make it easier to hold bad actors
accountable.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) will be required to develop a comprehensive data
audit procedure, prioritizing the audit of imports from
countries identified by other agencies as having human
trafficking, forced labor, or child labor in any part of their
seafood supply chain. This will make the SIMP more effective
and explicitly link IUU fishing to human rights abuses.

MAKING THE SEAFOOD IMPORT SCREENING SYSTEM
MORE EFFECTIVE
In its current form, the United States’ seafood import control
system does not effectively block IUU-fished or unethically
harvested seafood imports. The bill directs CBP and NOAA to
update the electronic import control system—the Automated
Commercial Environment—to better verify the data received
and to use predictive analysis to detect illegal imports.
By incorporating artificial intelligence into the system,
the United States will be able to more proactively identify
seafood shipments at risk for IUU fishing and labor abuses.

ILLUMINATING FISHING ACTIVITIES
The invisibility of fishing operations, including
transshipment, is a key reason why IUU fishing and its
associated human rights abuses abound. Illuminating supply
chains from the point of harvest is essential to eradicating

these problems. Under current federal law, nearly all
information submitted by seafood importers to U.S. agencies
that pertains to legality of harvest and seafood supply chain
practices is kept highly confidential. The Illegal Fishing and
Forced Labor Prevention Act increases transparency of the
data that accompany seafood imports into the United States,
including information on the legality of catch, and improves
the ability of federal agencies to share information with each
other to better enforce conservation and labor requirements.

It would also expand the use of automatic identification
systems (AIS), important vessel tracking tools that can aid
in monitoring transshipping events, identifying vessels at
higher risk of labor abuses, and overall enforcement. Seafood
importers will be required to provide the unique mobile
maritime service identity associated with their AIS as a
condition of seafood import.

PORT-TO-PLATE SEAFOOD TRACEABILITY
Currently, seafood labeling and traceability requirements
end when imported seafood reaches U.S. ports, leaving a
massive gap in accountability. The bill extends traceability
reporting requirements for imported seafood throughout the
entire supply chain. It also empowers seafood consumers
by establishing seafood labeling requirements for basic
information such as what fish it is, where and how it was
caught, and if it was wild-caught or farm-raised.

INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE AND CAPACITY BUILDING
TO DRIVE CHANGE BEYOND U.S. WATERS
The High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act
(High Seas Driftnet Act) is one of the main tools the United
States can use to put pressure on other nations to end IUU
fishing. It requires NOAA to submit a regular report to
Congress identifying nations engaged in IUU fishing and other
harmful practices if NOAA has evidence of specific vessels
engaged in IUU fishing. If listed nations do not address the
issue, NOAA can issue a negative certification, which can
have drastic consequences, including denial of access to U.S.
ports and restrictions on seafood and other fish product
imports. Yet NOAA has repeatedly failed to use this powerful
law to accomplish what it was intended to do: leverage
its resources and market power to protect fisheries and
ecosystems.

The Illegal Fishing and Forced Labor Prevention Act allows
the United States to identify nations for failing to address
IUU fishing as a whole, rather than citing only specific IUU
activity of specific vessels. The bill also allows NOAA to
consider data from nongovernmental organizations, the
public, and other stakeholders when making determinations
about which nations should be listed. It also expands the
identification criteria to include whether other federal
agencies have found human trafficking, forced labor, or child
labor in any part of a nation’s seafood supply chain and aligns
the definition of IUU fishing with that used by the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization.

REINTERPRETING IUU FISHING TO INCLUDE VIOLATIONS
OF FUNDAMENTAL LABOR RIGHTS
The Illegal Fishing and Forced Labor Prevention Act
recognizes that illegal fishing and labor rights abuse are
interconnected and that compliance with international labor
standards is critical to ending illegal fishing and overfishing.
Restrictions on migrant workers’ ability to form or lead
trade unions, systemic discrimination against migrant
fishers in many distant-water fisheries, and rampant forced
labor in many fisheries combine to significantly reduce
the cost of labor and keep otherwise unprofitable fishing
operations afloat. By expanding the authority of the United
States government under the High Seas Driftnet Act and the
Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management
Act to penalize fishing nations for labor rights abuses and
demand labor reforms in their fisheries, IUU fishing and
overfishing will also be substantially curtailed.

BETTER INTERAGENCY COOPERATION
The IUU Interagency Working Group, established by Section
3551 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020, is
tasked by this legislation to develop a whole-of-government
approach for federal agencies to work more cohesively and
collaborate with state agencies to investigate and prosecute
IUU fishing and seafood fraud. This interagency cooperation,
along with stronger enforcement tools, will make the U.S.
response to IUU fishing more efficient and effective.

CONCLUSION
IUU fishing is a scourge on its own, contributing to the
loss of marine biodiversity and the depletion of the world’s
fisheries. But it is also inexorably tied to forced labor, human
trafficking, and human rights abuses of crew members around
the globe. Because these problems are intertwined, the
United States must tackle both together. Passing the Illegal
Fishing and Forced Labor Prevention Act is a critical step for
U.S. leadership in addressing IUU fishing and human rights
abuses in the seafood sector. With this holistic framework,
the United States will be poised to drive change for all
communities dependent on the ocean.
