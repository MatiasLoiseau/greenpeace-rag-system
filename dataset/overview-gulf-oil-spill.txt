OFFSHORE DISASTER: Gulf Oil Spill Factsheet
On April 20, 2010, a British Petroleum (BP) offshore oil rig exploded, killing 11 workers on the rig and spilling tens of 
thousands of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil well, located 5,000 feet below 
the ocean’s surface, leaked 5 million barrels (205.8 million gallons) of crude oil into Gulf Coast, with devastating 
consequences for Gulf Coast communities and the fragile wetlands, bayous, and coastal waters on which they de -
pend. The spill, which was estimated to be more than 130 miles long and 70 miles wide, has impacted the coastlines 
of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. The release of crude oil from BP’s leaking continues to threaten 
hundreds of species in the Gulf of Mexico, including critical habitat for endangered species, such as whales, sea 
turtles, and migratory birds.
 TIMELINE
 »July 2007: A study of the Interior Department’s Minerals Management Service (MMS) data reveals that offshore oil drilling 
projects are riddled with a history of accidents, fires and deaths as reported in Drilling Contractor.
 »July 30, 2008: A top agency manager at MMS faces criminal charges for violating conflict of interest laws. The Interior 
Department begins investigating other conflicts of interest, and the revolving door between oil companies and former MMS 
and Interior employees.
 »April 2009: The MMS gave BP a “categorical exclusion” from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirement 
to prepare a detailed environmental impact statement for BP’s drilling operation. The Washington Post reported that BP’s 
exploration plan for the Deepwater Horizon rig stated that the prospect of an oil spill was “unlikely,” and that “no mitigation 
measures other than those required by regulation and BP policy will be employed to avoid, diminish or eliminate potential 
impacts on environmental resources.”
 »March 31, 2010: President Obama unveils plans to open large swaths of U.S. coastal waters to oil and natural gas drilling.
 »April 2: In a speech in North Carolina, President Obama states that “It turns out, by the way, that oil rigs today generally don’t 
cause spills. They are technologically very advanced. Even during Katrina, the spills didn’t come from the oil rigs, they came 
from the refineries onshore.”
 »April 7: The Government Accountability Office reports that Department of Interior managers routinely “suppressed” critical 
findings on the safety of offshore drilling projects, including the likelihood of oil spills.
 »April 20: BP’s Deepwater Horizon exploratory oil drilling platform explodes in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven workers are missing 
and presumed dead. Seven are critically injured.
 »April 23: Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry says that no oil appears to be leaking from the undersea wellhead or at the 
water’s surface.
 »April 24: The Coast Guard reverses its earlier statement and estimates that BP’s well is spilling 1,000 barrels (42,000 gallons) 
of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico.
 »April 24 and 25: High seas and turbulent weather prevent clean-up crews and response teams from reaching the spill site.
 »April 27: Underwater robots are deployed to stop the flow of oil but are unsuccessful.
 »April 28: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association states that BP’s well is spilling 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) 
per day into the Gulf of Mexico.
 »April 29: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declares a state of emergency.
 »April 30: Experts state in the Wall Street Journal that BP’s oil well could be leaking up to 25,000 barrels (1,050,000 gallons) 
per day into the Gulf of Mexico.
 »May 1: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service states that the spill will impact 20 National Wildlife Refuges, including Breton Island 
National Wildlife Refuge, the second oldest wildlife refuge in the country established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 
1904.
 »May 2: President Obama visits a Coast Guard station on the Louisiana coast. President Obama announces that BP will bear 
all costs of the oil spill.
 »May 3: Tony Hayward, BP Chief Executive, announces that BP is fully responsible for the cleanup and any “legitimate” claims 
from the spill.
 »May 3: Senator for New Jersey Robert Menendez introduces a bill to raise the economic damages liability cap from $75 
million to $10 billion for oil companies such as BP.
 »May 4: Senior BP Officials testify in Congress that the oil well could be leaking as much as 60,000 barrels (2,520,000 gallons) 
per day into the Gulf of Mexico.
 »May 4: BP announces that it may need an additional three months to drill a relief well.
 »May 29: BP says the complex “top kill” maneuver, started three days earlier to plug the well, has failed.
 »June 16: BP agrees to set up a $20 billion fund for damage claims from the spill, suspends dividend payments to sharehold -
ers and says it will pay $100 million to workers idled by the six-month moratorium on deep-sea drilling.

 »June 20: Internal BP document released by U.S. Congressman Ed Markey shows BP estimates that a worst-case scenario 
rate could be 100,000 barrels (4.2 million gallons/15.9 million litres) a day. This is far higher than the U.S. government estimate 
of 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons/9.5 million litres) a day.
 »June 24: A U.S. judge refuses to put on hold his decision to lift a ban on deepwater drilling imposed after the spill.
 »July 19: BP says it has spent $3.95 billion so far on efforts to tackle its leaking well.
 »July 23: BP says it is temporarily suspending relief well activities due to the approach of Tropical Storm Bonnie.
 »July 27: BP names American Bob Dudley as its next CEO, saying Tony Hayward will stand down on Oct. 1.
 »July 15: BP finally gets a cap to securely fit on top the oil well, giving a temporary fix.
 »Aug 2: U.S. government data shows 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked before the well was capped in mid-July, suggesting the 
company had underestimated the cost by at least $1 billion.
 »Aug 5: BP’s static kill plugs the Macondo drill site, stopping the flow of oil 108 days after it started. The bottom kill method is 
being viewed by BP as the permanent solution. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
 The oil plume from the Gulf oil spill is expected to cause long term damage to the coastlines of Louisiana, Alabama, 
Mississippi, and Florida and to irreversibly alter the Gulf Coast ecosystem. The Gulf Coast is home to pristine eco -
systems and some of the nation’s most prized wildlife refuges and conservation areas. The Gulf of Mexico provides 
habitat for hundreds of species, and each year, approximately five million migratory birds make their way through the 
region. According to The Times-Picayune, the threatened area is a vital wintering or resting spot for more than 70 
percent of the nation’s waterfowl including the brown pelican, Louisiana’s state bird. In addition, many endangered 
species rely on Gulf waters, and fragile populations of North Atlantic bluefin tuna, four species of sea turtles, six 
whale species, sharks, and dolphins are in the spill’s impact zone. 
 ECONOMIC IMPACTS
 According to Associated Press reports, damages from the Gulf oil spill could be in the billions of dollars. This 
disaster will undoubtedly exact a severe toll on the coastline industries that rely on Gulf Waters, such as Louisiana’s 
oyster and shrimp harvest. Just in Louisiana alone, annual retail seafood sales are $1.8 billion, recreational fishing 
generates approximately $1 billion in retail sales, and saltwater sport fishing generates about $757 million each year, 
in addition to the thousands of jobs supported by these industries. 
 THE SOLUTIONS
 » The Gulf oil spill and other catastrophes like it are predictable outcomes of our reliance on fossil fuels. We must change 
course. Congress must act NOW to:
 »Put stricter regulations in place for the coal and oil industries to make them safer and more accountable for the damage they 
do.
 »Place a ban on new offshore drilling.
 »There should be an immediate end to all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy and investments should be focused on 
clean renewable energy, efficiency technology, and infrastructure development.
 »Pass legislation that jumpstarts a clean energy revolution in the U.S.
