paper protection for the Amazo n

Almost ten years ago, world leaders ga t h e red in Rio de Janeiro, Bra z il. The meeting, known as the Earth
S u m m i t, became one of the defining moments of the fight to reverse the worldwide trend of enviro n m e n t a l
d e g radation. To ge t h e r, more than 180 countries re c o g n i zed the harm being infli c ted on our fra g ile earth
and vowed to put the world on a more sustainable path. Central to this was the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD). This lega lly binding agreement was intended to provide a comprehensive framework fo r
the  pro tection  of  the  world’s  thre a tened  natural  habitats,  including  ancient  fo rests  and  the  li fe  that
depends upon them.

A decade late r, the world’s ancient fo rests are still waiting for governments to keep their Earth Summit
p ro m i s e.  To d a y,  some  80%  of  the  world’s  fo rests  have  been  degraded  or  destroyed.  The  Amazo n
ra i n fo rest is no exception. Last year defo restation of the Bra z ilian Amazon was gre a ter than at any time
since 1995.2 Fu e lled by high international market demand, mahogany (Sw i e tenia macrophyll a) is driving
the destruction of the ra i n fo rests of the Bra z ilian Amazo n .

The vast majority of Bra z il ’s mahogany is exported. Luxury products from Bra z ilian mahogany are sold in
some of the most prestigious re t a il outlets in the world’s wealthiest countries. But the glamourous image
hides a corrupt industry that is undermining tra ditional culture s, and leading the ill e gal destruction of the
w o r l d ’s most precious ancient fo re s t, critical to the survival in the wild of cre a t u res such as the jaguar.

O f ten re fe r red to as ‘green gold’, mahogany can fe tch over US$1,6 0 0/m3. Ill e gal mahogany opens the door
for ill e gal logging of other species, and for widespread exploitation of the Bra z ilian Amazon. The Bra z ili a n
G o v e r n m e n t ’s assessment of the problem is that 80% of all Amazon timber originates from ill e gal sourc e s.
At the core of ill e gal logging is widespread corruption.

D e s p i te  many  years  of  campaigning  by  NGOs  such  as  Gre e n p e a c e,  the  plethora  of  domestic  and
i n ternational agre e m e n t s,  action pro g rammes  and  laws pledging  to pro tect the  Amazon  or control  the
m a h o gany  trade  have  proved  hopelessly  inadequate.  Over  the  last  decade,  numerous  inte r n a t i o n a l
a g reements  have  been  signed  to  pro tect  species  such  as  mahogany  and  the  remaining  intact  ancient
fo rests in which mahogany occurs. These include the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Gro u p
of  Eight  (G8)  Nations’  Action  Programme  on  Fo r e s t s and  the  Convention  on  International  Trade  in
Endangered Species (CITES). These agreements are not working.

Recent Greenpeace investigations in the Bra z ilian state of Pa rá reveal just how
deeply ro o ted the problem re m a i n s. No re liable legal chain of custody exists
for mahoga n y. Ill e ga lity is widespread. The key players are ruthless.

This report sets out the evidence and names many of the key actors involved
in the supply and trade of ill e gal mahogany from Bra z il. Osmar Alves Fe r re i ra
and  Moisés  Carv a lho  Pe re i ra  are  two  kingpins  in  the  state  of  Pa rá,  which
s u p p lies  the  vast  majority  of  Bra z il ’s  mahogany  tra d e.  Ill e gal  mahogany  is
l a u n d e red  through  fraudulent  use  of  official  documents.  By  the  time  it  is
shipped from the Amazon, the mahogany appears legal and its ill e gal origins
a re untra c e a b l e.

Fe r re i ra  and  Moisés  are  connected  to  at  least  five  export  companies  –
E x p o r t a d o ra Pe ra c c h i / S e r raria Cotia, Tapajos Timber, S e m a s a, M a d e i re i ra
M C P and J u a ry/ J a to b a – that to gether control around 80% of exports fro m
the state of Pa rá. On the importing side, just four companies in the North –
A ljoma  Lumber,  DLH  Nordi s k,
J  Gibson  McIlvain  Co  Ltd a n d
I n te rcontinental Hard w o o d s – account for over 80% of the tra d e.

However unwittingly, manufa c t u rers and re t a ilers in North America, Euro p e
and Japan are aiding and abetting high level crime. This goes for high-c l a s s
re t a il outlets in the USA carrying lines from Fu r n i t u re Brands Inte r n a t i o n a l ,
L i feStyle  Furnishings  International,  Stickley  and  Ethan Allen;  Harrods and
John Lewis Partnership in the UK; International Design Centres in Japan; and
others are all involved in the scandal. Whatever these companies may claim,
t h e re is no way of knowing whether the mahogany they sell is legal – and the
odds are that it is not.

The  trade in  ill e gal  mahogany  is  just  the  tip  of  the  iceberg.  It  signals  the
fa il u re of world governments to act to pro tect the Amazon – just one of the
w o r l d ’s last remaining ancient fo re s t s.

Th e 200 2 Anc ien t Fo re st S umm it 3

At the April 2002 Ancient Fo rest Summit at The Hague in The Netherlands, world governments will meet to
decide a te n -year plan for the ancient fo re s t s. The outcome of this meeting will determine the fa te of the
w o r l d ’s remaining ancient fo rests and the plants, animals and people they support. Whether go v e r n m e n t s
act to stamp out the ill e gal and destructive trade in mahogany will be but one test of their ability to move
beyond rhetoric and into the realm of action.

Governments must act to s top the destruction, clean up the timber tra d e and fund the pro tection of
ancient fo re s t s.

The law of the land

c a r te blanche for destruction

Logging companies bet on the incapacity of the [Brazilian] government to
c a r ry out enforcement measures; or they just change activities when caught
because timber is just another business front and considered a te m p o r a ry
activity; the same way the forest is considered as a te m p o r a ry stage on the
road to regional development.4
– Ibama, 1997

Most of the remaining stock of mahogany lies in indigenous reserv e s, and a
large  proportion  of  Brazil ’s  mahogany  harvest  is  extracted  from  them.
Mahogany  logging  has  been  impli c a ted  in  serious  social  di s r u ption  of
i n digenous communities, including assassination, alcohol and drug relate d
p r o b l e m s, increased prostitution and the spread of di s e a s e s. 5

I llegal logging road on Indian lands documented
by Greenpeace in September 2001

M a h o ga ny –  gree n go ld

M a h o ga n y, the green gold of the Amazon, is the most valuable Amazon timber. The demand for mahoga n y
is almost exclusively driven by the international marke t.6 To d a y, dealers are willing to pay up to $1,6 0 0/m3
for this precious and increasingly ra re commodi t y.

B ra z il ’s ‘mahogany belt’ covers some 80 million hectares of the Bra z ilian Amazon. A region of fo rests rich
in ra re and wonderful wood species and areas of enormous ecological di v e r s i t y, it stre tches from the south
of Pa rá to Acre, crossing the north of Mato Gro s s o, Rondônia and southern Amazo n a s. Unsurprisingly, this
region fa lls within the Amazo n’s ‘defo restation belt’.

M a h o gany  pro s p e c tors fly  hundreds  of  kil o m e t res  over  dense  fo rest  in  search  of  scatte red mahoga n y
t re e s, often fewer than one per hectare. To gain access to a single mahogany tre e, loggers often bull d oze
ill e gal access ro a d s, criss-c rossing previously untouched fo re s t. Logs are extra c ted up to 500km from the
n e a rest sawmill.

The  high  value  of  mahogany  pays  for  the  long  pioneer
roads that cut through the Amazon to reach the infre q u e n t
m a h o gany tre e s. These logging roads are the first step in
to d a y’s colonization process of  fo rest cleara n c e, leadi n g
to agricultural and ra n c h i n g.7 For instance, the president of
the Ta il â n dia logging industry association admits that he
sees the introduction of soya plantations to Southern Pa rá
as the industry’s future once the logging is finished.8

Thousands of kil o m e t res of ill e gal roads have been opened
in  Pa rá  State,  the  largest  mahogany  producing  and
exporting region in Bra z il. Intensive and pre d a to ry logg i n g
p ractices have already depleted the mahogany stocks of
the South of Pa rá. Indian lands have been heavily exploite d
in the hunt for remaining sto c k s.

I nvasio n of I nd ia n lan d s

Wh o  p r o f i t s ?
Although ill e gal, it is not unpre c e d e n ted for Indi a n s, including some members of the Kayapó, to
a llow loggers  onto Indian land in order to make some meagre earnings themselves. However,
w h ile Indians receive at best R$80 (US$30 )9 per tre e, the sawn timber from that tree then sells on
the export market for upwards of US$3,30 0.1 0 This same tree supplies enough mahogany timber
to  assemble  between  12  and  15  twelve- s e a ter  solid  mahogany  dining  room  tables,  which
wholesale for US$4,1 50 and re t a il to the public for US$8,5 50 each.

H e n c e, the products from one 5m3 m a h o gany log have a re t a il value of up to US$128,250 when
sold at prestigious re t a ilers such as Harrods in the UK11 – equivalent to the sale of 4275 mahoga n y
t rees in the fo re s t.

The largest remaining concentrations of mahogany are  found on or  around Indian lands in Pa rá  State.
F i f teen Indian lands cover 16,2 4 3,000 hectares of fo re s t1 2 – an area roughly the size of Nepal or Wa s h i n g to n
S t a te in the USA – mostly in the south of the state.13

On paper, the Bra z ilian Constitution pro tects Indian lands from all industrial exploitation. However, the
h u ge profit made by the individuals and companies that control the mahogany market explains the motive
for the widespread ill e gal invasion of Indian lands. By the end of 1992,1 4 m a h o gany logging had exte n d e d
o n to all 15 Indian lands and has continued since.

Lawyers at the Social-Environmental Institute1 5 working on behalf of Indians say they have never seen a fa i r
and legal contract for mahogany logg i n g.1 6 The standard tactic used by the loggers is to enter the Indi a n
l a n d s, fe ll the trees and then nego t i a te on the basis of the trees that have been cut down.1 7

W h e re contracts have been nego t i a ted with Indi a n s, it has
o f ten  led  them  into  debt  bondage  to  the  sawmill s.  As
M e ga ron,  a  Kayapó  chief,  explains:  ‘The  Kayapó…  are
fo rced  to  pay  with  more  mahoga n y.  Indians  cannot  li v e
f rom wind.’1 8

Many violent conflicts resulting from the ill e gal industry
have  been  re p o r ted  on  Indian  lands.  Indians  have  been
fo rced to take di rect action to halt the ill e gal invasion of
their  lands  by  logge r s.  Tra g i c a ll y,  this  has  sometimes
ended in violence. An unknown number of Indians have
been  murd e red  because  of  their  opposition  to  the
i n d u s t ry.1 9 E n ding the ill e gal logging on their land re q u i re s
sustained  efforts  to  find  alternatives  that  provide  the
I n dians with income from the fo re s t, without destroying it.

One five metre mahogany log supplies enough timber to make up to 15 of these
tables – a total reta il value of US$128,250

T he  M iddl e Lan d

The Indian lands in Pa rá surround the ‘ Terra do Meio’ or Middle Land, a region of Fe d e ral public land about
the size of Austria (8.3 million hectares). One of the largest relatively undisturbed areas of ra i n fo rest in the
e a s tern Amazon, the Middle Land is situated on the northern edge of the mahogany belt, between the
Xingu and  Tapajós  rivers. The region is  of  critical importance  to  wil dli fe  and  Indian people.  It shelte r s
n u m e rous  species  including  jaguars,  giant  alli ga to r s,  spider  monkeys  and  ante a te r s,  all  of  which  are

c u r rently under threat of extinction in the wild.

Recently loggers and miners have crossed the Xingu river
h e a ding  west,  invading  public  lands  within  the  Middl e
Land. Even José Altino Machado, the famous leader of the
A m a zon  ga r i m p e i ros  (gold  pro s p e c to r s ) ,2 0 is  amazed  by
the  speed  of  the  invasion.  In  an  inte rview  published  in
August 2001,21 Machado said that since 1995 loggers and
farmers had opened 600km of roads between São Fé lix do
Xingu,  an  important  logging  town  at  the  edge  of  the
M i d dle Land, and Itaituba.

A c c o rding  to  José  Altino,  another  400km  of  roads  are
c u r rently  opening  up  the  re g i o n .2 2 Recent  Gre e n p e a c e
field investigations show that one of these roads is being
opened  by  Osmar  Fe r re i ra,  one  of  the  key  players  in
B ra z il ’s  ill e gal  mahogany  tra d e,  to  transport  logs  to  the
s a w m ill  he  is  buil ding  in  the  town  of  Uruará,  along  the
Tra n s a m a zonian Highway.2 3

A problematic secto r

The forest industry in Brazil is not a sector with problems,
but a problematic secto r.2 4
– Ibama, 1997

What  logging  companies  present  to  Ibama  as  being
‘management plans’  are just  fa ke papers  that ‘legali ze’
activities that are never monitored or controlled by the
federal  agency.  These  ‘management  plans’  are  just
bureaucratic requirements for the release of mahogany
export li c e n s e s. 25

I llegal mahogany is laundered through the fraudulent use of official documents

Fraud ul ent AT PFs –  c ov erin g the  t ra cks of  t he il lega l l og ge r s

In Bra z il, there is widespread fraudulent use of official documentation at the initial stages of the
supply chain.26 This renders subsequent national and international measures to control the ill e ga l
t rade in timber such as mahogany almost meaningless.

The  Bra z ilian  government  issues  ATPF  (Authorization  for  the  Transport  of  Fo rest  Pro d u c t s )
documents  in  an  attempt  to  control  the  timber  tra d e.  In  theory,  ATPFs  should  prevent  the
t ransport of logs that are not legal in origin. In pra c t i c e, an industry re p resentative has note d ,
ATPFs can easily be purchased for around US$1/m3 of timber.27 – creating a blank cheque for ill e ga l
l o gging activities. More o v e r, ATPFs are frequently reused many times to launder re p e a ted ill e ga l
s a l e s.

Once ill e gal mahogany has reached the sawmill using fraudulent AT P F s, it is ‘lega li zed’. Ibama, the
B ra z ilian fe d e ral environment age n c y, acknowledges that many sawmills present documentation
in perfect ord e r, fraudulently declaring ill e ga ll y- s o u rced timber as originating from an appro v e d
FM P.28

One common practice is for companies to overe s t i m a te the volume of timber in a given area of
fo rest in the FMP they present to Ibama. Often, Ibama does not inspect the fo rest befo re the
p roject is approved. The overe s t i m a te gains a company spare ATPF papers, which can be used to
launder  ill e gal  timber  from  outside  the  FMP area.  Fe d e ral  Pro s e c u tor  Ubiratan  Cazetta  note s:
‘Many Fo rest Management Plans are the object of fraud. The di f fe rence between the volume of
m a h o gany re a lly existing (in the fo rest) and what is specified in the FMPs serves as the starting
point that supports the ‘lega li z a t i o n’ of mahogany coming from Indian Re s e rv e s.29

T h e re have been several initiatives by official Bra z ilian agencies to clamp down on the ill e gal mahoga n y
t ra d e. In 1996, fo llowing the release of sate lli te images exposing the extent of defo restation in the Amazo n ,
and a strong campaign led by Greenpeace and other NGOs, the Bra z ilian government put in place a two-
year mora torium on any new Fo rest Management Plans (FMPs) for mahoga n y. This stopped the expansion
of the mahogany marke t. The mora torium on new FMPs has been extended and will remain in place until
June 2002.

In 1999, fo llowing an evaluation of 65 re g i s te red mahogany FMPs in Pa rá State, the Bra z ilian go v e r n m e n t
suspended 39 FMPs and cancelled 13 FM P s. Reasons included lack of ge o g raphical co-o rdi n a tes for the
FM P,  inaccura te  maps  and  overestimation  of  the  volume  of  mahogany  in  the  fo re s t.30 The  re s p e c te d
B ra z ilian re s e a rch institute EMBRAPA noted that FMPs ‘only exist to satisfy a legal demand’ 3 1 – i.e. they
exist  on  paper  to  supply  the  industry  with  the  official  ATPF  documents  necessary  to  launder  ill e ga l
m a h o gany into the legal marke t.

Eight of the remaining 13 mahogany FMPs are owned by people impli c a ted in illegal logging

A c c o rding  to  re c o rds  held  by  Ibama  in  Pa rá  State,  only  13  FMPs  for  mahogany  extraction  re m a i n
re g i s te re d . 32 A ll of these FMPs are inside or around the Middle Land. The owners of eight of these FM P s
have been impli c a ted in ill e gal logg i n g. Official Authorization for the Transport of Fo rest Products (AT P F )
documents relating to these FMPs have been used fraudulently to cover the tracks of the ill e gal tra d e.

In  1998,  the  Bra z ilian  Government  li s ted  mahogany  under  Appendix  III  of  CITES  in  an  effort  to  help  it
re g u l a te  the  international  tra d e.  Bra z il  also  fixed  quotas  for  mahogany  exports,  which  are  dete r m i n e d
yearly and have been pro g ressively reduced. For 2001, the quota is li m i ted to 20,0 0 0 m3 in the first half and
1 0,0 0 0 m3 in the second half. CITES Appendix III does not certify the lega lity of mahogany at point of origin,
nor does it deal with domestic trade or processed products such as plywood and other finished pro d u c t s.33

These measures have been a first step in the right di rection, but the government has still fa iled to full y
c o n t rol the activities of those players remaining in the industry to d a y. A shortage of money and equipment
p revents Ibama, the government body in charge of contro lling fo rest exploitation and the timber industry,
f rom  monitoring  the  origin  of  the  timber  that  enters  the  marke t.  Hence,  only a  tiny  fraction  of ill e ga l
m a h o gany exploited on Indian lands is picked up. For instance, O Lib e r a l re p o r ted in 1997 that ‘sawmill s
receiving ill e gal timber are located only 100 metres from the São Fe lix do Xingu Airport… The head of
Ibama states that he is aware of the exploitation, but blames the situation on the orga n i z a t i o n’s lack of
equipment and financial re s o u rc e s. ’34

Even when Ibama inte rvenes and proves the ill e gal origin of logs, government authorities ra rely succeed in
punishing those re s p o n s ible for the crime. Rate of collection of fines issued against timber companies fo r
i n f ractions  is  extremely  low.  As  the  then  president  of  Ibama,  Eduardo  Martins,  declared  in  1997:
‘ P ra c t i c a lly 100% of the fines re l a ted to Ibama’s issuing documents of infraction against those destro y e r s
of  fauna and  fl o ra  are  not  paid.’3 5 A l s o,  companies are adept  as  using judicial  appeals  and  other  lega l
m a n o e u v res to retain control of ill e ga ll y- s o u rced timber.36

The ban on new mahogany FMPs has consoli d a ted control of the trade into the hands of the fe w, and the
continued strong global demand and high market value for mahogany products cre a tes a strong incentive
for Pa rá ’s reis do mogno – the mahogany kings – to log ill e ga ll y.

M oi s és  Ca r valh o Pe re i ra

In August 2001, Epoca – Brazil ’s second largest weekly news magazine – li n ke d
then president of the Brazilian Senate, Jader Barbalh o, with illegal mahogany
trade through Moisés

Moisés exploits mahogany from Kayapó Indian lands. He pays them R$80/m3 [US$30] and resells it fo r
R $ 3,500 [US$1390]. Most of the timber is exported to the UK.3 8
Epoca, August 2001

Moisés is said to be the most powerful mahogany king, re p o r ted to make about US$1 million a day during
the logging season. Money gained from this trade is laundered into other enterprises – Moisés is also a
rancher and his fortune from mahogany has been used to finance a car dealership, a hotel and a re g i o n a l
television station and a long list of other businesses.39 Most of them are in the logging town of Re d e n ç ã o, in
the South of Pa rá.

A c c o rding to sources within the Bra z ilian government and documents cited at Ibama in Bra s ilia, Moisés is
li n ked with several companies involved in the ill e gal chain of supply of mahogany to the export marke t.
These include Madeire i ra Juary/ J a toba (sawmill and exporter), 2M (sawmill), Madeire i ra MCP (sawmill and
e x p o r ter), Millennium (sawmill), Madeire ra Prizina (one FMP), Madeire i ra Rio Pre to (sawmill), Ouro Ve rd e
( s a w m ill), Rio Negro (sawmill) and Serraria Mara j o a ra/Semasa (three FM P s, sawmill and exporte r ) .

In August 1998, ‘Operação Mogno’, an investigation on the Kayapó Indian Re s e rve in Pa rá by Ibama and
the Fe d e ral Po li c e, confirmed the involvement of the company Juary in ill e gal mahogany logging on Indi a n
l a n d s. The  investigation showed  that  Moisés’ original  application for  the FMP near  São  Fe lix do  Xingu
( J u a ry I farm) was based on false inventories of the volume of mahoga n y. The official documents were
being used to launder mahogany ill e ga lly extra c ted from Kayapó lands.40/41

O p e ração  Mogno  also  re s u l ted  in  a  similar  charge  against  the  company  2M  for  having  ill e ga ll y
o v e re s t i m a ted by 16,1 56 m3 the volume of mahogany existing in two FM P s.

In 2000, Moisés closed Juary, only to open another company, Jato b a .4 2 Neither Juary nor Jatoba officiall y
c o n t rols any of the mahogany FMPs re g i s te red to d a y. Last year, Juary/ J a toba sold mahogany through the
Danish-based trader DLH Nordisk to the USA, the UK, The Netherlands and Germany. Juary also sold to
A ljoma Lumber in the USA – the largest single mahogany importer in 2000.4 3

P a r t n e r s   i n   m a h o g a n y  c r i m e

Semasa  is  another  company  li n ked  to  Moisés  and  is  the  largest  single  holder  of  currently  re g i s te re d
m a h o gany  FM P s,  contro lling  thre e.  Semasa  sells  mainly  to  the  USA  via  DLH  Nordisk  and  through  UK
i m p o r ter  Allan  Thomas  Cra i g.  In  1994-95,  Semasa  traded  in  excess  of  the  authorized  volume  for  its
( u n i n v e n toried) FM P s. That authorized volume was itself based on a company estimate for the density of
m a h o gany  that was three times the regional avera ge. Ibama has  also cancelled one  of  Semasa’s FM P s
because it was a fiction – existing on paper only. 4 4

B a r b a lh o.4 5 A c c o rding to E p o c a: ‘Jader stands accused of association with the ill e gal trade in mahogany in

having  embezzled  more  than  R$3  million  (US$1.1m)  from  Pa rá  State  Bank  and  the  former  Fe d e ra l

In December 2000, A critica reported the results of Operação Xingu

The assault on the mahogany of the Middle Land began in the early 1990s when Exportadora Pe ra c c h i
d e c l a red ownership of areas along the road opened by the Canopus mining company. The road opens the
fo rest between the Xingu River and the Iriri river and further south, bordering Kayapó Indian land.

Time and again, the mahogany kings have proven adept at manipulating the legal sy s tem and exploiting its
li m i t a t i o n s. In the mid 1990s, one group of Indians sought help from the courts to expel Pe racchi, Maginco
and Impar from their lands where these companies were ill e ga lly logg i n g. They also sought to fo rce the
l o ggers to pay the re c o v e ry plan for the devastation caused. Pe racchi made numerous appeals aga i n s t
Fe d e ral court injunctions that pro h ib i ted the company access to the ill e gal logging road inside Indian lands.
Pe racchi argued that the Fe d e ral court in Bra s ilia had no jurisdiction in the area and that the matter should
be decided by a local judge in São Fé lix do Xingu. The local NGO, Nucleo de Dire i tos Indi ge n a s, acting on
behalf of the Indi a n s, was ‘to t a lly against such tra n s fe r, because a local judge would be more vulnerable to
p o li t i c a l /economic pre s s u re’ .53

In  another  case  in  September  1999,  the  Fe d e ral  Prosecution  Office  in  Pa rá  filed  charges  against  the
companies Serra Dourada and Pe racchi with the Fe d e ral Judge of Marabá. Quoting an Ibama report about
the  results  of Operação  Mogno from  1998, the Fe d e ral  Pro s e c u tor  Ubiratan Cazetta stated:  ‘Fo ll o w i n g
confirmation that the timber [extra c ted from Indian Lands] was tra n s p o r ted to sawmills in São Fe lix do
Xingu,  Tucumã  and  Re d e n ç ã o,  [the  authorities]  carried  out  an  assessment  of  the  companies’  existing
m a h o gany stocks as well as in the companies’ re c o rds of the volume traded to date.’

A c c o rding to the Pro s e c u to r, the investigation revealed a striking good order in the paperw o r k. Too perfe c t
in fa c t. The inspectors decided to investiga te the two FMPs owned by Serra Dourada. ‘The field inspection
showed that the [volume of mahogany in the] FMP was overe s t i m a ted. The volume of mahogany simply
does not exist in that are a . ’ 54 With an overe s t i m a ted sto c k, Serra Dourada was able to get from Ibama
documents covering the exploitation of an additional 21,0 8 6 m3. These were used to launder the mahoga n y
obtained ill e ga ll y. ‘It is easy to conclude that the di f fe rence between the volume of mahogany existing in
the plan and in the fo rest is coming from Indian Lands. ’5 5 D e s p i te these findi n g s, both FMPs – 383 8 /93 and
2 4 8 0/94  –  are  today  authorized  to  log  mahoga n y.  Pe racchi  was  also  found  to  have  overe s t i m a te  by
1 6,5 54 m3 the mahogany in its three FMPs (077/9 0, 1561 /91 and 3773/92) all re g i s te red in São Fe lix do

G r e e n p e a c e

I ll e g a lly logged timber in a log-yard on the banks of the river Xingu

In July 2000, a Greenpeace investigation team inspected ill e gal logging operations in the Middle Land and
in  the  Indian lands surro u n ding  it.  This  was  the  second  Greenpeace  expedition  to the  area,  fo ll o w i n g
s u rveys in 1999 to document ill e gal logging in Pa rá State. Greenpeace fieldwork in the São Fe lix do Xingu
region found ill e gal mahogany operations on Kayapó Indian lands (see map).

Video documentation of the findings was deli v e red to environmental authorities a few days late r, to ge t h e r
with a call for immedi a te action. Gre e n p e a c e, Ibama and the Fe d e ral Po lice initially estimated the volume
of ill e gal mahogany at 6000m3. When Ibama and the Fe d e ral Po lice flew over the area in early Septe m b e r
2 0 0 0, they estimated that 20,0 0 0 m3 of mahogany was lying in log-y a rds on Kayapó land or being tugged on
the Xingu river.

For  two  whole  months  after  receiving  incontro v e r t ible  evidence  of  large-scale  ill e gal  logg i n g,  the
government fa iled to act. A Fe d e ral Po lice agent told Greenpeace that the loggers had been informed and
w e re  removing  the  timber  from  the  Indian  lands.  Not  until  late  September  2000  did  the  Fe d e ra l
government task fo rce  start Operação Xingu.  It was not until November that they got results  – seizing
timber at the re g i o n’s sawmills worth roughly R$6 million (US$3m).

Two companies li n ked with Moisés were involved. Madeire i ra Pirizina was found with 264 2 m3 of mahoga n y
logs  and  was  later  fined  R$79 2,594  (US$40 0,000).  Madeire i ra  Rio  Pre to  was  found  with  2332m3 o f
m a h o gany logs and was fined R$1.2 million (US$600,000) for possession of ill e gal timber.

Two  companies  li n ked  with  Fe r re i ra  were  also  involved.  Serra  Dourada  was  apprehended  with  about
2 8 0 0 m3 of timber. Pe racchi was found with 1712m3 of mahogany logs and 123m3 of sawn timber – re c e i v i n g
a total fine of over R$800,000 (US$41 0,000)

In total, Ibama apprehended over 16,0 0 0 m3 of ill e gal timber from Kayapó land at seven sawmills in Sã o
Fé lix do Xingu, which included 79 2 4 m3 of mahogany logs and 123m3 of sawn mahoga n y.

But  in  January  2001,  three  of  the  companies  –  Serra  Dourada,  Pirizina  and  Ouro  Ve rde  –  received  a
p rovisional decision from a local judge allowing them to trade the ill e gal mahoga n y. As ill e gal logging is
c o v e red under the Fe d e ral Environmental Crimes Law, the issue is outside of the jurisdiction of a local
j u d ge. The judge was later suspended on suspicion of corruption. The investigation showed that all the
documents re l a ted to Operação Xingu had di s a p p e a red from the judge’s office in São Fé lix do Xingu.

Land.  Using  global  positioning  sy s tem  (GPS)  equipment,5 7 digital  video  cameras  and  photo g ra p h i c
e q u i p m e n t, Greenpeace documented logging roads and airstrips on the Ara w e tê, Apite rewa and Ka y a p ó

The most significant finding was located at the position S 07o 26'802" W 052o 41'169" – the same position
w h e re Greenpeace documented evidence in 2000 that led to the fe d e ral go v e r n m e n t ’s Operação Xingu.
H e re in 2001, Greenpeace documented a large log-y a rd on the Kayapó land, on the left bank of the Xingu
R i v e r. It was full of trucks, cars, bull d ozers and hundreds of logs. A large road heads west from the log-y a rd
i n to the Kayap Menkragnoti fo re s t. At the log-y a rd, also used as the port, boats wait to take the logs to
s a w m ill s. An aerial survey of the log-y a rd exposed large log- rafts of mahogany heading down river to w a rd
São Fé lix do Xingu. Greenpeace also found a smaller log-y a rd at the edge of the Kayapó land, on the right
bank of the Xingu, north of the Kayapó and Goro t i re land. A logging road leads into the fo re s t.

G reenpeace  has  deli v e red  a  copy  of  the  video  and  photo g raphs  to  the  Fe d e ral  Prosecution  office

E x p o r te r s, tra d e r s, manufa c t u re r s, re t a ilers and end consumers of mahogany participate in the process of
devastation of the Amazon driven by profit on the one hand and ‘pre s t i ge’ on the other. The glamouro u s

both destructive and corrupt.

DLH Nordisk is the largest international trader of Bra z ilian mahoga n y.62 A c c o rding to sources inside DLH,
the company controls up to 50% of the international market in Bra z ilian mahogany to countries includi n g

33 In many ways, CITES Appendix III is an ineffective mechanism for

controlling the international trade in mahogany as the illegalities are
primarily at the initial stages of the supply chain. However, rather
counterproductively, it legitimizes the trade in the market place by the
ostensible regulation through chain of custody documentation.

80 Timbmet and International Timber (part of Saint Gobain) are two of the
main UK traders of mahogany. Both belong to the WWF95+ Group of
companies, which has the strongest commitment to buy from legal and
well-managed sources to standards of the Forestry Stewardship Council
(FSC). However, these companies continue to buy mahogany, primarily
from DLH which sourced for the UK market between February 2000 and
May 2001 from Exportadora Peracchi, Tapajos Timber, Jatoba and MCP.
