About the Report
Greenpeace France has commissioned a report with the French research institute
DETENTE to help inform the discussion on the European Pressurized Reactor. The
main authors are Antoine Bonduelle and Mathias Lefère. The full version of the report
is only available in French at http://www.greenpeace.fr

Introduction

Plans being promoted by the French Industry Minister, Fontaine, are currently being
considered by the French government. The so-called European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) - a
ten-year old Framatome/Siemens design - would officially cost some 3.5 billion € and begin
producing electricity as early as 2010. In the Minister's view, the 59th  French reactor would
not be needed to match a growing electricity demand at a competitive price, but to « to have
at our disposition a maximum of energy options which will enable us to decide whether or
not to replace the nuclear park entirely or partly at the time horizon of 2020 - 2025  1.»

The Government was widely believed to planning to support the Minister's proposal but may
delay a decision until after the 'Energy Debate' in the French Assemblée next March, as
concerns have been raised about the EPR’s economics.

To help inform this discussion, Greenpeace France has commissioned a report from the
French research institute DETENTE comparing the EPR option with wind energy. If instead
of investing in an EPR, the French utility EdF would instead invest as much money in wind
generation, how much electricity will then be produced and how many jobs will be created?

In recent years wind power has gone through an industrial and technological revolution. In
Germany, some 13,500 MW are now operational, of which 3,200MW have been installed last
year alone, the equivalent of the consumption of more than 2 million households. France is
lagging far behind with only 220MW installed today. At a European level, the European
Wind Energy Association (EWEA) is cautiously estimating that the installed wind capacity
by 2010 will be 75,000MW2, tripling the current installed capacity and adding the equivalent
electricity production of some 14 large nuclear reactors or more than 2 reactors every year. In
reality, wind has already taken the lead and left nuclear far behind.

Meanwhile, nuclear power has been at a standstill or even in decline retreat in the European
Union. No single reactor has been connected to the grid in the last 4 years. In reality, it will
take at least another 10 years before a new reactor could come on line, while a growing
number of old reactors will be permanently shut down.

The aim of the report is not to present a comprehensive energy scenario, but to clarify the
economic and social impacts of a key energy choice about to be made by the French
government: either to add a 59th nuclear reactor to the nuclear overcapacity or to launch a
renewable energy sector. The latter would be supported by 85% the French clients of EdF3.

Methodology

The report compares the job creation and electricity production of 2 energy options: a new
EPR or wind power:

1. The report first calculates the cost of a new EPR, based on figures
from the French nuclear industry and French official references. It
then estimates the amount of electricity (TWh) that would be
produced over its lifetime.

2. Calculates at an equal investment base as 1 EPR, how many wind
turbines could be installed, and how much electricity would be
produced. Interest rates are assumed to be identical.

3. Compares the electricity production of the EPR and wind options
4. Estimates and compares the job creation for both options

A sensitivity study, comparing nuclear and wind option under 4 scenario's:

1.

2.
3.
4.

 DETENTE scenario, or central scenario: based on the construction of
1 EPR 'demonstration' reactor'
 EoP-H scenario: lower costs nuclear – higher costs wind
 EoP-B scenario: higher costs nuclear – lower costs wind
 1+4 EPR scenario: where 5 EPRs are constructed instead of 1, based
on the central scenario

The 4 scenario's are described in more detail in the annex. It should be noted that the capital
base in the 4 scenario's is different, as based on the investment in the nuclear capacity.

A conservative estimation of costs, in favor of nuclear

DETENTE has preferred to use figures from the French nuclear industry and French official
references (government, parliament) in order to give the report more relevance to the
forthcoming French Energy Debate. However, DETENTE questions the credibility and
correctness of these figures, which in general favor the nuclear option by under-estimating
nuclear costs and over-estimating costs related to wind power.

in French)

Main Results

The DETENTE scenario or central scenario, is based on the most 'balanced' figures from the
French nuclear industry and official references. Comparing the construction of 1 EPR with a
wind project of an identical investment, gives a much higher job creation and electricity
production in the wind option. This is shown in graph 1 and graph 2

Figure 1: annual electricity generation – DETENTE scenario: (nuclear:red ;   total wind:
yellow ; offshore wind: blue)

A wind programme generates 2.3 times more electricity at its full deployment than an EPR.
In electricity terms: 24 TWh / year for wind instead of 10 TWh / year for EPR.

This annual production is not identical to the actualized production which is used in the
economic calculations of this study. Production early in the studied timeframe are favored by
the actualization. The actualized wind production is thus 'only' 52% higher (111 TWh wind –
compared to 73 TWh nuclear over their lifetime), whereas the annual wind production – once
fully deployed – is 2.3 times higher than the nuclear production.

In the wind programme, the increase in capacity is more smooth than in the nuclear option,
which would be an advantage in the French context of large generation overcapacity. The
need for new capacity will indeed be large from 2030 onwards. The startup of an EPR as
early as 2012 will thus be more of a commercial handicap to EdF.

Figure 2: job creation in man-years – DETENTE scenario: (nuclear:red ; total wind: yellow ;
offshore wind: blue)

The results in terms of employment are spectacular. In the EPR option, the construction
generates up to 8000 temporary jobs4 with a peak shortly in advance of the entry into
operation of the reactor in 2012. But after startup, employment takes a steep dive. In the wind
option, construction is more evenly spread over time and employment takes the lead over
nuclear.
But above all, the permanent employment in the nuclear sector – either in the maintenance
and the operation of the reactor – remains very limited, even if ratios favorable to nuclear are
applied5.

In the EPR case, refurbishment creates temporarily increases in employment. In the wind
case, the decrease in employment after 2030 corresponds to the choice of this scenario not to
construct new turbines after this date.

The distribution of the creation of employment in time is different in the 2 cases. A
comparison of man-years of employment is however possible. It corresponds more or less to
the surface under the graphs presented above.

Job creation could be valued more by decision-makers if it arises earlier in time. This is
presented by actualizing the job creation, using a rate of 8% as used by the French public
services6.

4  This figure is higher than the 5000 used by the industry. Quoted from 'Le Point' July 27th 2003
5

 The ratios of permanent employment in the nuclear sector are taken from SFEN (Société Française d’Energie
Nucléaire), and are clearly favoring the nuclear option

6  As part of the sensitivity study, a rate of 3% has been applied, which gives an even more favorable

result for wind power.

Over a timeframe of 60 years – the official lifetime of the EPR – the number of man-years
generated by the wind option is nearly 5 times higher. If employment is actualized, reflecting
the political preference for early job creation, the ratio is still a factor 2 higher for wind.  The
wind option thus shows major social benefits.

Sensitivity study

Starting from the 'central' DETENTE scenario, 3 other scenario's are developed, which are
presented in more detail in the annex.

It is remarkable that in every scenario, the annual production by wind energy is by far larger
at its full deployment. Even in the case where 5 EPRs are constructed – a case considered as
unrealistic given the large nuclear overcapacity in France – wind still generates 30% more
electricity (65 TWh/y instead of 50 TWh/y for the EPR) at an equal capital base.

The wind option has large social advantages with a job creation which surpasses the nuclear
option in every scenario.  Even in the 1+4 scenario, nearly 3 times as much jobs are created
by wind (if actualized, the ratio remains 1.6 times higher).

Conclusions

Based on figures from the nuclear industry and French official references which in general
favor nuclear energy, the report «Wind vs Nuclear 2003» demonstrates that a clear choice for
wind power instead of a new EPR would offer France major social and economic benefits. At
an equal investment, wind power generates 5 times more jobs and 2.3 times more electricity
than nuclear. Even in an extreme scenario with low costs for nuclear and high costs for wind,
wind remains the best option.

In the context of the French 'Energy Debate', the French Parliament should carefully and
critically evaluate the socio-economic consequences of the proposal of the French Industry
Minister to construct the EPR.
