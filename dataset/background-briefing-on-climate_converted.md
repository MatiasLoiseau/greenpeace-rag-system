BACKGROUND MEDIA BRIEFING
CLIMATE CHANGE LITIGATION
December 2004

Summary of legal actions
This document provides more information on 10 legal actions that have been
announced around the world under several different legal theories in order to
combat climate change. The 10 actions have been grouped together by legal
category.

PUBLIC LAW
The five actions detailed below (from the United States of America, Australia,
Germany and Argentina) are aimed at the decisions or omissions of public
bodies.

In the United States of America, NGOs and affected individuals have been
joined by the cities of Boulder, Oakland and Arcata in suing the US export
credit agencies for funding fossil fuel projects under the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) and the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has illegally provided over
$32 billion in financing and insurance for oil fields, pipelines and coal-fired
power plants over the past 10 years without assessing their contribution to
global warming, or their impact on the US environment as required under
NEPA the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). More information is

In addition, twelve US states, several cities, and over a dozen environmental
groups today, are suing the Bush administration´s Environmental Protection
Agency´s failure to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air
Act.

In Australia, NGOs challenged a minister´s power to prevent a planning body
from considering greenhouse gas emissions before deciding to approve a
coal mine expansion. The judge agreed with the NGOs and said that these
emissions must be taken into account.

In Germany, NGOs have begun legal action against the German
government´s secret export credit support for fossil fuel projects since 1997.

“After the 2003 Santa Fe floods in Argentina which killed many people and
caused millions of dollars of damage, citizens have successfully used Article 6
of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change alongside the “Acción
Informativa” mechanism to reveal official failure to adapt to climate change.
The legal action has so far revealed that infrastructure changes needed to
protect people had been drawn up but not acted upon by the authorities.”

CIVIL LAW
The first civil law case was brought by eight US States, New York City and
NGOs in July 2004 against the five biggest US power companies. The
plaintiffs argue that the huge emissions from the defendants´power plants are
a public nuisance and that the court should order them to be reduced.

HUMAN RIGHTS
The Inuit Circumpolar Conference has announced that it is developing a
human rights case against the Bush Administration at the Inter-American
Human Rights Commission. They will argue that the impacts in the Arctic of
human-induced climate change infringe upon the environmental, subsistence,
and other human rights of Inuit.

PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW
In November 2004, petitions from Belize, Nepal and Peru were submitted by
NGOs and individuals to the World Heritage Committee to place world
heritage glaciers and coral reefs on the List of World Heritage in Danger as a
result of climate change.

Danger-listing is a legal mechanism under the UNESCO World Heritage
Convention requiring an increased level of protection where the best parts of
the planet are facing serious and significant threats. The petitions argue that
that the Committee must address both the causes and impacts of climate
change when drawing up the required programme for corrective measures, in
order to ensure that the legal duty on States under Article 4 of the Convention
to transmit

World Heritage Sites to future generations will not be complied with. The three
petitions cover the Belize Barrier Reef, the Huarascán National Park in Peru
and the Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park in Nepal.
