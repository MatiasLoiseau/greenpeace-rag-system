Imagine if an electricity company tried
to build a dirty coal fired power plant
on a rural beach near a national park in,
say, southern California in 2002.

Now, imagine if that coastal area was a breeding ground for whales and
dolphins. Most likely, the company would be laughed out of the state.

But that’s exactly what one Southern Californian company, Edison, is try-
ing to do in Thailand against the bitter objections of local farmers and
fisherfolk.

The battle over two-coal plants proposed by Edison and some corporate
friends has emerged as one of Thailand’s most intense and longest run-
ning struggles.

The struggle against Edison is a fight for human
rights and environmental protection from the many
negative impacts of coal plants, not least amongst
them global warming.

At issue is a proposal to build two huge coal-fired
power plants in two villages on the Gulf of Thailand,
Ban Krut and Bo Nok. The question as to whether
these plants can be built has gathered steam over
the last seven years as communities in the area have
organized a solid resistance campaign. In it, despite
often harsh repression, they have won support from
around the world and delayed the plants.

Edison International, a U.S. corporation, is at the
center of a consortium pushing this model of power
generation on to the community and government of
Thailand. Villagers say that the plant developers rep-
resent foreign multinationals seeking to practice
gross double standards at the expense of people
and places on the other side of the world. If the
Edison Consortium has its way it will have serious
negative affects including the following:

• uproot a sustainable community that is opposed

to such industrial development

• create a pollution problem that will despoil local

ecosystems and public health

• grossly contribute to climate change through

carbon dioxide emissions, and

• reduce the potential for Thailand to meet its

electricity with clean energy.

Greenpeace aims to expose the hypocrisy of Edison
in pursuing this power plant over the wishes of the
local community, and its failure to address the cli-
mate change potential of its plans, which will be at
the expense of us all. The deeper that emerging
economies like that of Thailand become embedded
in the dirty energy pathway, the worse global warm-
ing will be in years to come. The good news is that
there are viable alternatives to fossil fuels in the
Thai setting: namely wind, solar and biomass-power
generation.

But Edison and its partners want only to bring old
King Coal to Thailand. The technology that the
developers would use at both the plants would
never meet the environmental and social protection
standards in California, homestate of the Edison
Corporation. Yet the companies involved would
gladly spend two billion dollars on building these
plants that would cloud the air, sully the water and
choke the children of Thailand.

Bo Nok power plant
would have the
capacity of generat-
ing 734 MW of elec-
tricity. The plant cov-
ers an area of 162
hectares along the
coast in the Bornok
sub-district, Muang

Edison International is a holding company, head-
quartered in Southern California. It is the “ultimate”
parent company of Edison Mission Energy, which
owns the 40% stake in the proposed Bo Nok power
plant in Thailand. EIX, as Edison International is
known on the stock exchange, is also infamous as the
parent of Southern California Edison. Its total assets
amount to U.S.$36.9 billion according to the compa-
ny’s most recent tax filings.

Southern California Edison is an embattled electricity
utility in the Los Angeles area of California that buys
and sells power. SCE, the acronym by which Edison is
best known throughout the United States, services 11
million customers and is literally a household name in
central and coastal Southern California. It is virtually
bankrupt at the time of writing, and has sought state
support—a bailout—to continue its services in
California.

Edison Mission Energy is a global power generating
company that is wholly-owned by Edison
International. EME has 76 assets, with a net generat-
ing capacity of nearly 19,000 megawatts. Projects
span the globe, from Australia, Italy and New
Zealand, to Thailand, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.
It also owns significant interests in coal mines in
Australia and Indonesia—preferred sources for the Bo
Nok power plant.

There are other companies under the umbrella of
Edison International: Edison Capital provides capital
and financial services for global power and infrastruc-
ture projects, Edison Enterprises is the company’s retail
subsidiary, and Edison O&M Services provides power
plants with operations and maintenance services.

is backed in large part by taxpayer money: the U.S.
Export-Import Bank has helped to finance U.S. equip-
ment and services exports to Paiton worth more than
$500 million, while the Export-Import Bank of Japan
is contributing $900 million, with other funding from
the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation
(OPIC). On October 7, 1999, Indonesia’s national
power company filed a lawsuit against Paiton to nul-
lify the 30-year power purchase agreement signed by
the previous management of the state company in
1994, under the allegedly corrupt administration of
former president Suharto.1

Polluting Our National Landmarks: If you’ve visited
the Grand Canyon and had trouble seeing it, it was
possibly because of air pollution from Edison’s
Mojave power plant. Located in Laughlin, Nevada,
the 1,580 megawatt plant burns a slurry, or soup, of
powdered coal and water piped 275 miles from the
highly controversial Black Mesa mine. The Mojave
power station is said by some to be the largest single
source of greenhouse gas emissions in North
America, and its torrent of air pollution halves visibil-
ity in the Grand Canyon.
It burns coal with no pollu-
tion controls for mercury, smog, or acid rain. The only
coal slurry line in the U.S., it
draws 3 million gallons of
ancient water—the
U.S.Geological Survey esti-
mates that it is 10,000 to
35,000 years old—each day
from an aquifer that is one
of the few sources of water
in that region of the U.S.A.2

On January 24, 2002, thousands of local villagers gath-
ered on the beach at Bo Nok in Thailand’s Prachuap Khiri
Khan province for a visit by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin
Shinawatrat, who had come to tour the site of the Edison
Consortium’s proposed coal-fired plant.19 Although the
protest was peaceful, some opponents had a clear warning
for the Prime Minister and the Edison consortium: “You
build, we burn”.

Greenpeace does not support property damage, but the
protesters’ slogan reveals how contentious the 7-year bat-
tle over the two proposed coal-fired power plants in
Prachuap Khiri Khan has become. It is also a clear signal
for the California-based company—Edison Mission Energy,
which owns 40 percent of one project20—that is the cause
for so much consternation. Building this plant would be a
bad business decision. It should be a blinding wake up call
for anyone investing in Edison: get out while you can.

After touring both plant sites and looking at whale bones
displayed by local villagers—a symbol of the rich marine
ecosystem threatened by the project—the Prime Minister
said he would make a final decision on the plants by April
13, the traditional Thai new year.21 So even though the
government has already granted the necessary licenses
and signed long term power contracts with the Edison
consortium, a potent grassroots opposition campaign has
succeeding in stalling the project—at least for now.

Build up to the Stand Off

When large amounts of land started changing
hands around the Bo Nok sub-district in 1995,
locals were told that developers were planning a
new golf course and resort.22 By the time residents
found out about the coal-fired plant slated for
the site, it was practically a done deal: the gov-
ernment had already endorsed the project and
before long entered into long-term power con-
tracts with the Edison group for years to come.

Villagers were immediately suspicious of the
project, having heard horror stories about the
infamous coal-fired power plant complex in Mae
Moh, a village in the northern Thai province of
Lampang. In October 1992, the Mae Moh plant
started leaking toxic gases, killing cattle and
sending more than 4,000 people to seek medical
attention. Despite the installation of pollution
mitigation equipment, the plants leaked again in
1998, with similar results.23

“I just didn’t believe the company and the gov-
ernment,” says Amnvay Songying, a Bo Nok aloe
vera farmer. “In the case of Mae Moh villagers
have complained about pollution and health
problems like asthma.”

The Edison consortium soon adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy,
movement leaders say. Anan Pongpattana-Sagul, principal of Ban
Nong Pulok School, organized a group of teachers to examine the
details of the project. But after the company paid for some of the
teachers to take a trip to see coal-fired power plants in Mae Moh and
in the United States, many of them dropped their opposition. Mr Anan
said, “I knew that it was the company’s trick to buy us”.24

Despite the company’s efforts, local opposition grew steadily among
the community of fishers, farmers, and merchants. Villagers sent
dozens of letters to federal and local authorities, staged demonstra-
tions, and attracted widespread media attention.

Crackdown
In December 1998, tired of being ignored, thousands of people rallied
in front of the Prachuap Provincial Hall. After officials failed to meet
with them, the group proceeded to block the Southern Highway, the
main route between Bangkok and the south of Thailand. Although
the gathering was peaceful, riot police were sent in with trucks to
break up the crowd, injuring 25 people. Even with the crackdown the
protest lasted until the Deputy Interior Minister promised villagers
that the plants would not be built as long as he is in office.25

It was only then that the government agreed to hold public hearings
on the plants. But fearing their participation would legitimize a cor-
rupt process, opponents boycotted the September 1999 hearings,
demanding that the Government first revoke the plant permits and
make the power contracts available to the public. Hundreds of protest-
ers registered their objections by gathering outside of the hearing
room in protest.26

Charoen Wat-aksorn, 34, a pineapple merchant and leader of the
opposition movement, says that the villagers have tried for years to
get attention to their cause through political channels but that only
radical grassroots organizing ensures they are heard. “It must be a
large group of people or the threat of violence or the government
won’t listen,” he said.

Verging on Victory
The government appears to now be finally listening. The fact that the
Prime Minister visited the area of the plants in January 2002 was a
milestone for the movement. Before it, in December, the Senate com-
mittee on Environment urged the government to relocate the two
power plants to avoid “another riot’’.27 But tensions are still running
high and will not abate until the proposed plants are scrapped.

Pressure on the government to do this has been growing in recent
months. In January, 533 leading Thai academics signed a petition call-
ing on the government to abandon the two projects and to set up an
independent body to review the contracts, which critics suspect gave
the companies a sweetheart deal.28 The petition made front page news
in the leading Thai newspapers. Meanwhile, the Student
Confederation of Thailand also launched a petition campaign in oppo-
sition to the plants.29

When a researcher from Thailand’s Science Ministry
recently reported the “discovery” of whales off the
coast of Bo Nok, local fisherman Wirot Pongnoi
wasn’t surprised. He says he has seen whales feeding
off the coast of Bo Nok since he was a kid. “We did
not make a big deal out of it, because we just
thought whales were common in the gulf,” says the
46-year old Pongnoi.

These days, the Bryde’s whale has become a symbol
for the movement against the Edison group’s power
plant at Bo Nok, and for good reason. The endan-
gered whales depend on the rich marine life in the
area, just as Pongnoi and his fellow fisherman do for
their livelihood. The developers maintain their coal-
fired plant will be whale-friendly. But the existence
of whales in the area was not even mentioned in the
Edison Consortium’s Environmental Impact
Assessment. And according to a government report,
coal-ash from the power plants could pose a signifi-
cant threat to the whales.

Besides whales, the area is habitat to more than 190
species of fish and several species of dolphin. The
Science Ministry’s investigation also confirmed many
of the local villagers’ worst fears about the project.
Among other things, it determined that the plants’
turbines could draw in an estimated 550 minnows

per minute or some 578 million young fish per year,
killing virtually all of them and severely affecting the
marine food chain.

“That would affect the marine ecosystem severely,
and this was not taken into consideration in either of
the EIA reports for the two projects,” said Suphavit
Piamphongsarn, head of the ministry’s investigation
committee. “This figure we have is the minimum. It’s
possible that the real impact would be more.”

The plant’s cooling system will pump hot wastewater
back into the sea, further endangering marine life.
Thorn Thamrongnawaswas of Kasetsart University,
told the Bangkok Post that the Bo Nok and Ban Krut
power plants would destroy 10 billion fish over the
plants 25 year operational lifespan.

Fishermen are also concerned about plans to build a
2 mile-long pier, which they say will obstruct their
boats and nets. The 330,000 cubic metres of ash pro-
duced by the plant would be stored within 50 feet of
a canal used by local fisherman every day. To make
matters worse, debris would be dumped into the
ocean during construction.

The threat to the local fishery and coastal biodiversity
are just some of the plant’s worst social and environ-
mental impacts.

Other impacts include:
• Loss of farming income: For generations, farmers
in Bo Nok have grown coconuts and pineapples,
among other crops. Acid rain caused by the emis-
sion of sulphur dioxode, and ash, could pollute the
land and waterways contaminating their crops and
lowering yields. This has been the experience of
farmers near the Mae Moh plant in northern
Thailand, where sulfur dioxide releases have dam-
aged rice fields, according to the Thai green
group, Terra.

• Climate Change: Scientists, politicians and business

leaders around the world acknowledge that
humanity is causing global warming. Continued
global warming will cause the melting of glaciers
and the polar ice caps, rising oceans, droughts,
massive flooding, coral bleaching and an increase
in storm activity. Coal is the largest contributor of
carbon dioxide of any of the major forms of elec-
tricity generation, and the single largest source of
global warming gases.

• Damage to nearby wetlands: The project poses a

threat to nearby Sam Roi Yot National Park, a wet-
land park that is home to more than 200 species.30
The Park has been nominated as a wetland of inter-
national importance under the Ramsar Convention,
a global environmental treaty dealing with wetland
preservation. The Environmental Impact Assessment
conceded that sulphur dioxide from the plant will
drift over the wetlands, which scientists say could
harm the wetlands and erode the coastal limestone
cliffs in the Sam Roi Yot National Park.

As a result of these impacts, the costs for which are
not “internalized” to the price paid for electricity by
consumers but ultimately borne by the public, coal is
significantly more expensive than power from natural
gas or biomass, two other options in Thailand. Once
the true cost of these “externalities”—the public
health impacts, lower agricultural productivity and
other impacts from pollution—are included, coal is a
very expensive energy option. Wind power world-
wide is competitive with coal even without these
costs being internalized to the price.

• Threats to human health: When asked why they
doubt the company’s safety claims, opponents of
the plant frequently point to the case of Mae Moh,
a lignite-fired plant in Northern Thailand, which
has released high levels of sulphur dioxide and
caused 42,000 local people to suffer from breathing
problems.31 This is why coal power plants are effec-
tively outlawed in California, the homestate of the
proponent, Edison International (see p 12).

The good news is that thanks to new, cleaner, renew-
able technologies, these coal plants are not even neces-
sary. In Southeast Asia, Greenpeace is actively promot-
ing policies and projects that favor energy generated
by wind, solar technology and biomass-based power,
the potential for which in Thailand is huge. A separate
report on the clean energy now available to Thailand
has been published by Greenpeace and is available
from the website http://www.cleanenergynow.org

As the Thai government decides whether or not to
approve the stalled power plants, the Prime
Minister’s office has ordered the state energy author-
ity to investigate the power contracts with Edison
and its partners, which one top official called “unjus-
tified and suspicious”.32

At issue are three amendments to the Edison plant’s
contract, which critics say put the Government at a dis-
advantage. Chaturon Chaisaeng, the Prime Minister’s
appointee in charge of energy policy, said he believed
changes to the terms had been made in the 1990s that
unduly favored the companies. Canceling the contracts
was therefore among the options, he said.

“The contracts, at a preliminary glance, seem unfair
to the government as it has to take all responsibilities
even though errors have been made by the private
sector,” Mr Chaturon said.33

Two of the three amendments increased the “avail-
ability payments”—money transferred to power gen-
erators in exchange for making their generation
capacity available, independently of whether energy
is actually provided or not.

The National Energy Policy Office has claimed that
canceling the two contracts will result in a hefty fine
of more than 10 million baht. These costs, the gov-
ernment claims, will be passed on to electricity
ratepayers.34

But Witoon Permpongsacharoen, from the Project for
Ecological Recovery, said at a recent public debate
that the government would be within its rights to
scrap the projects without paying any compensation.
There are many factors it could cite in annulling the
contracts with the company, such as the 1997 eco-
nomic crisis or the fact that the company has failed
to demonstrate its financial readiness to implement
construction, he said.35

Even if it is forced to pay the penalty, critics say, that
might be cheaper than allowing the plants to pro-
ceed. According to an analysis by the Thai group
AEPS, due to the “take-or-pay” nature of the power
purchase agreements, consumers will have to pay for
the Edison group’s power whether it is needed or
not. In addition, the government will save millions of
baht required to build transmission facilities to trans-
port the power to Bangkok. And given the potential-
ly exorbitant social and environmental costs, 10 mil-
lion baht may be a small price to pay.36

EXIM EXITS

As if standing up to their own government and a major developer
weren’t enough, the Thai opponents of the Bo Nok power plant may
have a third obstacle to overcome: pressure from the U.S. government.

On September 1999, the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Richard
Hecklinger met with Savit Bhotiwihok, the then Minister of the Prime
Minister’s office in charge of energy policy of the country. In an inter-
view after the meeting with a Thai newpaper, The Nation, the Prime
Minister said Hecklinger described the United States government as
“particularly concerned” by delays in the Bo Nok project. Hecklinger
implied that the repercussions for Thailand could extend to other U.S.
investment, according to Savit’s interview with The Nation newspaper:

“The ambassador was also quoted as saying that while Thailand has the
potential to become a centre for economic activity, problems and delays
as in the Bo Nok project could erode the potential for investment. The
delay in the public-hearing process could, he said, become an obstacle in
the way of future investment.”

Hecklinger’s comments outraged grassroots groups, who charged the
Ambassador with interfering in the country’s internal affairs. A leading
academic, Danai Kimpadanai, said: “This is pressure on the Thai govern-
ment to approve the project’s construction.”37

The U.S. embassy responded to the criticism by saying it “has a duty
to advocate U.S. business in the same way Thai embassies do in
other countries.”38

The Edison Consortium
had attempted to
secure U.S. taxpayer
financing for the Bo
Nok plant. The Export-
Import Bank of the
United States—a tax-
payer funded govern-
ment agency devoted to
corporate welfare—had
been in discussions with
the proponents about
funding the Bo Nok
project. But in the face
of pressure from Thai
activists and the U.S.
environmental group
Friends of the Earth, the
ExIm Bank claimed in
spring 1999 that it had
officially withdrawn the
project for funding con-
sideration.39

Dear Shareholders*

As you know, the past few years have been difficult for our company. California’s power
crisis pushed our utility, Southern California Edison, to the brink of bankruptcy.
However, through a three-pronged strategy of creative accounting, blackout threats,
and political juice, we succeeded in protecting the assets of our parent company while
getting our ratepayers to bail out SCE. Here’s a little of the history to remind you:

The California deregulation law required us to sell off most of our power plants in the
state. But that was OK, for several reasons. First, we were able to sell them at above
book value to deregulated companies. The law also forced taxpayers to bail us out for
our bad nuclear investments. Meanwhile, we shifted billions from the utility to our par-
ent company, to fund dividends and stock repurchases. We then went on a global shop-
ping spree, snatching up old, polluting power plants throughout the world. The value
proposition from all this change is that we no longer have to deal with California’s
annoying environmental laws. Now, most of the power we produce around the world is
from coal, something we could never have gotten away with in the Golden State.

In 2000 the California power crisis hit. Wholesale power rates skyrocketed, and our utili-
ty started running up big debts. Some suggested that our parent company—which had
siphoned off all the utility’s profits—should help pay those bills. Instead, we jacked up
rates by 40 percent. Then, we found a loophole in the law that allowed Edison
International to say, for the purposes of paying off debts, that we had never heard of
Southern California Edison, or even Southern California for that matter. Check out our
cool website disclaimer on this very subject at www.edison.com!

We figured that if we turned the lights out often enough, the state would bail out the
utility. There was the little problem that, despite our friend Governor Davis’ efforts, the
California legislature refused to pay off our debts. So we had to bring in our lawyers
and lobbyists to meet secretly with the state regulators, arranging a lucrative bailout
that sticks our customers with the bill. This type of corporate strategy is what makes us
an innovative leader in the industry as we move back to the future with coal worldwide.

Environmentalists have recently criticized some of our investment decisions. They ask,
why are we building a coal-fired plant smack dab on a beach in a tranquil Thai fishing
village, something we could never get away with in California? Answer: Because we can!

Make no mistake—Edison’s environmental commitment remains as strong as ever; we
spend millions of dollars every year crafting and communicating a green image. And
those who doubt our commitment to the environment should talk to our CEO John
Bryson, one of the founders of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

As long as we continue to pursue this strategy—gouging our consumers in California
and foisting polluting power plants on developing countries—we believe that Edison
International will have a bright and powerful future.

* Although this is not Edison’s real letter to its shareholders we think it should be.

Unplugging Edison’s PR Machine
Myth #1:
Unless the Plants Are Built, Thailand Will Run Out of Power
When the two coal-fired power plants slated for Prachuap
Khiri Khan were first approved, the Thai economy was riding
high and power use was projected to skyrocket. But with the
devaluation of the Thai currency, the baht, in 1997 the coun-
try’s economy went into a tailspin and has been in the dol-
drums ever since.  Now, critics are questioning whether it
now needs the additional power from the plants at all.

Myth #4:
Edison Could Build the Same Plant in California
The Edison group insists that the Bo Nok plant will employ
the latest technology, minimizing its impacts on the envi-
ronment. In response to questions from environmentalists
and government officials, President Robert Driscoll, Edison
Mission Energy senior vice president for Asia Pacific Region,
has said that Bo Nok would use the same technology even
if it were built in southern California.

The National Energy Policy Office maintains that the coun-
try’s reserve margin would drop to precarious levels if the
plants are cancelled. But others contend that NEPO’s
demand forecasts are overly optimistic: In 1997, the state’s
“electricity load forecast panel” used an economic growth
figure of 4.7% to predict energy demand and power plant
investment for the following five years. In reality, economic
growth has not exceeded 2%.40

Myth #2:
Coal is the Cheapest Alternative
When you add the environmental and social costs into the
equation, coal suddenly becomes much more expensive.
Even if Thailand’s environmental laws are properly
enforced, a coal-fired plant still emits more sulfur-dioxode,
nitrous-oxide, carbon-dioxide, particulates and heavy met-
als than other types of power plants.41 These pollutants
have damaging health and environmental effects. Power
from a renewable technology like biomass is actually about
a third cheaper than that from coal once social and envi-
ronmental costs are taken into account (see page 8 for
internalization of costs).

Myth #3:
The Plants will use high quality “Clean Coal”
The Edison consortium claims that it will use “clean coal”
technology. “Clean” or “Enviro-coal” is a misnomer: even
the cleanest of these new technologies is still dirtier than
natural gas, for example. And studies show that even the
best “clean coal” technology has minimal effect on green-
house gas emissions. Also, dangerous levels of air and
water pollution have been recorded in areas burning so-
called clean coal. And whether the coal is low in sulfur or
not, coal mining often involves human rights violations.

The low sulfur coal for Bo Nok will be supplied by
Indonesia’s Adaro coal mine, which is partly owned by
Edison. PT Adaro, located in the province of South
Kalimantan, has come under protest since it opened by
local residents who say dredging in the area had created
dust problems and polluted water supplies. In September
1999, human rights and environmental activists in
Indonesia called for a halt to all coal mining in the province
at a protest rally outside their governor’s office and the
local assembly. They said coal mining brought suffering to
local people and destroyed the environment.42

But could such a plant really be built on Edison’s home turf?
No, according to Curtis Moore, energy expert and former
counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and
Public Works. He says the emissions from the proposed plant
would be many times above what would be allowed in
California. For example, the Thai plant is expected to emit
nitrogen oxides, which impacts lung function and can cause
asthma attacks, at 170 parts per million. New California
plants would be limited to 2.5 parts per million. “There is no
doubt that the Thai plant greatly exceeds anything new or
old that is retrofited in California,” says Moore.43

Thai environmental activist Ponglert Pongwanan accuses
Edison of using an unethical double standard. “Why, if they
can’t build it in the United States, are they allowed to build
it here in Thailand?” he asks.

Myth #5:
Coal Power Plants will create Local Benefits
Companies argue that the construction of large-scale coal-
fired power plants will bring about increased employment
for local community members and also positive income for
the local government from royalties and other proceeds
from hosting power plants. These are rarely forthcoming, as
the experience with multinational owned coal plants in the
Philippines has shown. As far as employment goes, the proj-
ect would indeed create some short-term construction jobs.
But in the long run, coal is much less labor intensive than
renewable energy technologies. A study, based on United
States plants, found that both wind and photovoltaic plants
provide 40% more employment than coal plants (see table).44
