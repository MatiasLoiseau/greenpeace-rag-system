In1998-9, Thanry’s subsidiaries held some 650,000 ha of forest
concessions in Cameroon – 16 percent of the total concession area in
that period13.

During the MINEF investigations, Thanry’s subsidiaries were found to
be logging ‘anarchically’ and “without the least respect for the logging
area”. They were also found to be logging undersized trees, as well as
logging in some areas without legal permits. The subsidiaries SAB and
SEBC were described as “flagrant examples of companies violating all
kinds of forestry laws”. The report concludes that the kind of forest
exploitation carried out by these companies is “putting at stake the
entire forestry policies to promote sustainable forestry management in
Cameroon.”

Moreover, along with another French company, Coron, Thanry’s sub-
sidiary CFC has been severely criticised for obtaining concessions by
irregular procedures and for owning forest operations which are larger
than the law currently allows14. Both Coron and CFC obtained conces-
sions through an unlawful discretionary process: a presidential decree
signed by the Prime Minister in March 1996. This is in clear violation of
the country’s new forest legislation that requires a public and competi-
tive allocation process to grant new concessions15.

In 1996-97, Thanry’s subsidiaries produced around 460,000 m3. Their
main markets include China and the G8 country, France16.

The Baka ‘pygmy’ communities of

Cameroon are under threat from a

logging industry in which corruption

and the violation of indigenous

peoples’ rights are widespread.

The remaining large ancient forests of West Africa are under
threat1. Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast have already lost almost
all of their natural forest. Liberia is the only west African coun-
try where large areas of ancient forest remain. But since the end
of the war in 1997, foreign logging companies have been rapidly
destroying vast forest areas, operating in an environment of
almost total lawlessness. In Central Africa, where large areas of
relatively intact forests still remain, destructive logging opera-
tions are now expanding rapidly into the heart of the Congo
Basin – an area famous for its rich biological and cultural diversi-
ty2. Most logging operations in this region are highly destructive
and a significant proportion are illegal, with corruption and the
violation of indigenous peoples’ rights widespread. Despite
claims to the contrary by the G8 governments, a substantial part
of the trade in illegal timber is fuelled by demand from the inter-
national market3. Greenpeace is calling on all governments to
stop their role in this trade.

Today, only around one fifth

of the world’s large ancient

forests remain, most having

already been destroyed by

human activity. In West

Africa almost all of the natur-

al forest has gone,while

Central Africa now faces

increasing threat from the

rapid expansion of destruc-

tive logging operations

O v e r v i e w

In April this year, Greenpeace documented illegal activities in the
global timber trade in its report Against the Law: the G8 and the
illegal timber trade. The report summarised examples of illegal
activities in the African timber trade, including the unauthorised
trade in CITES-listed species4 and the harvesting of trees below
the legal size for cutting.

support many species

which do not occur

elsewhere.

The response of G8 governments to the report has been to play
down the role of the international timber market in driving
demand for the illegal production and trade of wood, and to argue
that this is largely a domestic issue5. Thus governments seek to
minimise their role in driving this trade and limit their responsibili-
ty for its environmental and social impacts.

However, such arguments are inconsistent with the
trade figures. These show that, for example, all of the
industrial roundwood produced in Gabon and at least
50 percent of that produced in Cameroon is exported
as logs, sawnwood or panels – and that around half of
these exports go to G8 and EU countries6.

Since the release of Against the Law, a number of
leaked reports on the forest industry in Cameroon
have revealed major illegalities in almost all conces-
sions, in what has been described as “the most cor-
rupt country in the world”7.

There is much evidence to suggest that
illegality and corruption within Cameroon’s
forest industry are the norm rather than the
exception.

A recent study8 financed by the World Bank
reveals that the Cameroonian government is
losing millions of dollars due to fraudulent
practices and illegal logging. The least regu-
lated type of logging licence, the vente de
coupe9, is currently the most prevalent. In
1998-99, ventes de coupes accounted for
almost 200,000 of the 350,000 ha of forest
allocated for cutting in that period. The
study indicates that in some areas up to 90
percent of these logging licences are operat-
ed illegally. Harvesters were found to be log-
ging without a licence, overlogging the des-
ignated area, logging far beyond the defined
boundaries of the licence and logging after
the licence had expired. While most of these
cutting licences are owned by Cameroonian
nationals, they are commonly subcontracted
to foreign logging companies, which then
export the majority of this illegally harvested
timber.

The donor community is finally becoming
increasingly concerned about the escalating

illegal logging practices in
Cameroon. Discussions are
currently underway to deter-
mine how best to improve
monitoring capacity on the
ground as a primary tool to
curb illegal logging.

In March 2000 the Cameroonian

Government published a communiqué

summarising the illegal practices found

in logging concessions in the East,

South and Central provinces of

Cameroon in December 1999.

Once again, Greenpeace is calling on G8 governments
to honour their commitment to combat the illegal
production and trade of wood and wood products.
It demands that these governments:

• DO NOT buy illegal timber products
• DO NOT fund forest destruction through aid for

unsustainable forestry

• DO NOT allow G8 countries to be markets for illegal

timber

• DO buy wood products from sustainable certified

forests

• DO provide urgent assistance to forest countries to

tackle illegal logging

• DO increase the capacity for monitoring and trans-

parency throughout the production and transport of
wood and wood products globally

Illegal loggers owned by companies
in G8 countries

Following pressure from the World Bank, the Ministry of
Environment and Forests (MINEF) of Cameroon conduct-
ed a series of field inspections in the country’s East,
South and Central Provinces during December 1999. The
MINEF team inspected 26 concessions allocated in 1997.
The result was two internal reports detailing major illegal-
ities in almost all of the concessions visited10. Illegalities
ranged from logging outside concession areas to fraudu-
lent markings on logs in order to avoid payment of tax.
Yet despite the seriousness of the infractions, the penal-
ties11 allocated were far too low (only 4-20 million CFA12)
to discourage the logging companies from continuing
their illegal activities.

logging subsidiaries owned by companies in

G8 countries which were fined for operating

illegaly in Cameroon in December 1999.

No less than four of the logging operations found to be
operating illegally have parent companies in G8 nations:
these are Bolloré, Coron and Thanry (French), and Vasto
Legno (Italian). Together, these four companies control
more than  a third of all logging activity in Cameroon.
The inspected subsidiaries were SIBAF (Bolloré), SAB,
CFC and SEBC (Thanry), EGTF (Coron) and SEFAC (Vasto
Legno).

Thanry (France)

Of the European-owned companies listed in the MINEF
report, the worst offender was the French-owned Thanry,
with its three inspected subsidiaries fined a total of 41
million CFA.

Thanry has numerous forestry operations in West and
Central Africa. In Cameroon, Thanry is the largest logging
company, operating through six subsidiaries: CFC
(Compagnie Forestière du Cameroun), CIBEC (Compagnie
Industrielle du Bois au Cameroun), J Prenant, Propalm,
SAB (Société Africaine des Bois) and SEBC (Société
d’Exploitation Forestière des Bois du Cameroun).

On the 6th April 2000 - the opening day of the G8 Environment

Ministers meeting in Okinawa, Japan - Greenpeace denounced the

role of Italian company Vasto Legno in illegal logging in Africa.
