3There is now growingawareness on theimperatives for a globalenergy future which marksa distinct departure frompast trends and patternsof energy production anduse. These imperativesemerge as much from theneed to ensure energysecurity, as they do fromthe urgency of controllinglocal pollution fromcombustion of differentfuels and, of course, thegrowing challenge ofclimate change, whichrequires reduction inemissions of greenhousegases (GHSs), particularlycarbon dioxide.This publication provides stimulati ng analysis on future scenar ios ofenergy use, which focus on a range of technolog ies that are expected toemerge in the coming years and decades. There is now universalrecogn ition of the fact that new technolog ies and much greate r use ofsome that alread y exist provide the most hopeful prospec ts formitigation of emissions of GHGs.  It is for this reason that theInternational Energy Agency , which in the past pursued an approachbased on a single time path of energy demand and suppl y, has nowdeveloped alternative scenar ios that incorporate future technolog icalchanges. In the Fourth Assessment Repor t of the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Chan ge (IPCC) as well, technolog y is includ ed as acrosscu tting theme in recogn ition of the fact that an assessment oftechnolog ical options would be impor tant both for mitigation as well asadaptati on measures for tackling climate change. The scientif ic evidence on the need for urgent action on the problem ofclimate change has now become stronger and convincing. Futuresolutions would lie in the use of existing renewab le energy technolog ies,greate r efforts at energy efficiency and the dissemination ofdecentr alized energy technolog ies and options. This particularpublication provides much analysis and well-res earched material tostimulate thinking on options that could be adopted in these areas.  It isexpected that readers who are knowledgeab le inthe field as well asthose who are seeking an understanding of the subjec ts covered in theensui ng pages would greatly benef it from reading this publication.Dr. R.

The good news first. Renewable energy, combined with energy efficiency,can meet half of the world’s energy needs by 2050. This new report,“Energy [R]evolution: A Blueprint for Solving Global Warming,” showsthat it is not only economically feasible, but also economically desirable,to cut U.S. CO2emissions by almost 75% within the next 43 years.These reductions can be achieved without nuclear power, and whilevirtually ending U.S. dependence on coal. Contrary to popular opinion, amassive uptake of renewable energy and efficiency improvements alonecan solve our global warming problem. All that is missing is the rightpolicy support from the President and Congress.The bad news is that time is running out. The overwhelming consensusof scientif ic opinion is that the global climate is changing and that thischange is caused in large part by human activities; if left uncheck ed, itwill have disastrous consequences for Earth’s ecosys tems and societies.Furthermore , there is solid scientif ic evidence that we must act now.This is reflected in the conclusi ons of the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Chan ge (IPCC),  a collabor ative effort involving more than1,000 scientis ts. Its next repor t, due for release early this year, isexpected to make the case for urgent action even stronger. In the United States there is a groundswe ll of activity at the local andstate levels. Many mayors, governors, and public and business leadersare doing their part to address climate change. But they can only do somuch;  action is needed at the federal level. Now is the time for anational, science-bas ed cap on greenhous e gas emissions.

It’s time for a national plan to address global warming. Such a plan willcreate jobs, improve the security of America’s energy supply, and protectAmericans from volatile energy prices. It will restore America’s moralleadership on the critical international issue of climate change. And realaction in the United States will inspire confidence as the rest of theworld negotiates future global commitments to address climate change.In addition to global warming, other energy-related challen ges havebecome extreme ly pressi ng. Worldwide energy demand is growing at astaggering rate. Over-reliance on energy impor ts from a few, oftenpoliticall y unstable, countr ies, and volatile oil and gas prices, havetogethe r pushed energy security to the top of the political agenda,  whilethreaten ing to inflict a massi ve drain on the global economy . But whilethere is a broad consensus that we need to change the way we produceand consume energy, there is still disagreement about what changes areneeded and how they shoul d be achieved.the energy scenarioThe European Renewab le Energy Counc il (EREC) and GreenpeaceInternational comm issioned this repor t from the Depar tment ofSystems Analysis and Technolog y Assessment (Institute of TechnicalThermodynam ics) at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).  TheWorldwatch Institute was hired to serve as a techn ical consultant forthe U.S. and North American portions of the repor t. The repor tpresents a scenar io for how the United States can reduce CO2emissionsdramaticall y and secure an affordab le energy suppl y on the basis ofsteady worldwide econom ic development through the year 2050.  Bothof these impor tant aims can be achieved simultaneousl y. The scenar iorelies primarily on improvements in energy efficiency and deployment ofrenewab le energy to achieve these goals. The future potential forrenewab le energy sources has been assessed with input from all sectorsof the renewab le energy industry, and forms the basis of the Energy[R]ev olution Scenar io.

5 © PAUL LANGROCK/ZENIT/GREENPEACEthe potential for renewable energyRenewab le energy technolog ies such as wind turbines, solarphoto voltaic panels, biomass power plants,  solar thermal collec tors, andbiofuels are rapidly becom ing mainstream.  The global market forrenewab le energy is growing dramaticall y; global investment in 2006reached US$38 billion, 26% higher than the previous year. The time window available for making the transition from fossil fuels torenewable energy is relatively short. Today, energy companies have plans tobuild well over 100 coal-burning power plants across the United States; ifthose plants are built, it will be impossible to reduce CO2emissions in timeto avoid dangerous climate impacts. But it is not too late yet.We can solve global warming, save money , and improve air and waterquality withou t compr omising our quality of life. Strict techn icalstandards are the only reliable way to ensure that only the mostefficient transpor tation systems,  industrial equipment,  buildings, heatingand cooling systems,  and appliances will be produced and sold.Consume rs shoul d have the oppor tunity to buy products that minimiseboth their energy bills and their impac t on the global climate.from vision to realityThis repor t shows that business as usual is a recipe for climate chaos.If the world continues on its current course, CO2emissions will almos tdouble by 2050,  with catas trophic consequences for the natur alenvironment,  the global economy , and human society as a whole. Wehave the oppor tunity now to change that course, but the window isnarrow and closing quickl y. The policy choices of the coming years will determine the world’senvironmental and econom ic situati on for many decades to come.  Theworld cannot afford to stick to the conventional energy developmentpath, relying on fossil fuels, nuclear , and other outdated technolog ies.Energy efficiency improvements and renewab le energy must playleading roles in the world’s energy future.For the sake of a sound environment,  political stability, and thrivingeconom ies, now is the time to comm it to a truly secure and sustainableenergy future - a future built on clean technolog ies, econom icdevelopment,  millions of new jobs, and a liveable environment.

the energy [r]evolutionThe climate change imperative demands nothing short of an EnergyRevolution. At the core of this revolution will be a change in the waythat energy is produced,  distributed, and consumed.  The good news isthat America is blessed with some of the best renewab le energyresour ces in the world and after initial success with energy efficiencyfollowing the oil crisis in the 70s, there is still enormous potential forimprovement in the United States.This repor t shows that we have a choice: we can cut carbon dioxide(CO2) emissions in the United States nearly 75% by 2050 withou trelying on dangerous nuclear power or expensi ve new coal technolog ies.With rapid deployment of energy efficiency and renewab le energy wecan stop global warming. Spurred by oil-price volatility and the war in Iraq, the issue of energysecurity is now at the top of the energy policy agenda.  One reason forprice increas es is that suppl ies of all fossil fuels - oil, gas, and coal -are becom ing scarcer and more expensi ve to produce.  The days of cheapoil and gas are coming to an end. At the same time green energy isboom ing business in America, and this growth has to continue if we aregoing to stop global warming. Renewab le energy technolog ies candeliver the energy we need,  as this repor t shows, but only withconsis tent suppor t based on an understanding that solving globalwarming is our top energy priority. The solution to our future energy needs lies in greate r use of renewab leenergy sources for both heat and power. Nuclear power is not thesolution. There are multiple threats to people and the environment fromits operations. These includ e the risks and environmental damage fromuranium mining, processi ng, and transpor t the risk of nuclear weaponsproliferation; the unsolved problem of nuclear waste; and the potentialhazard of a serious accident. In addition, uranium, the fuel for nuclearpower, is a finite resour ce. By contr ast, the reserves of renewab le energythat are techn ically accessib le globall y are large enough to providemany times more power than the world currently consumes - foreve r.Renewab le energy technolog ies vary widely in their techn ical andeconom ic matur ity, but there is a range of technolog ies that offerincreasi ngly attractive options. These includ e wind, biomass,  solar,geothe rmal, ocean,  and hydroelectric power. Their common feature isthat they produce little or no greenhous e gases, and rely on virtuallyinexhaus tible natur al sources for their “fuel.” Some of thesetechnolog ies are alread y competiti ve, and their econom ics will continueto improve as they develop techn ically. The price of fossil fuels, on theother hand,  continues to rise. At the same time there is enormous potential for reducing our energyconsumption, while providing the same level of energy services. This studydetails a series of energy efficiency measures that together can substantiallyreduce demand in industry, homes, business, and transportation.

The challen ges posed by global warming are great and they require newways of thinking about energy. At the core of the Energy [R]ev olutionwill be a change in the way that energy is produced,  distributed, andconsumed.  The five key principles behind this shift are:1.respec ting the natur al limits of the environment,  2.implementi ng renewab le solutions, espec ially through decentr alizedenergy systems,3.phasi ng out dirty, unsus tainable energy sources,4.decoupling economic growth from the consumption of fossil fuels, and5.creati ng greate r equity in the use of resour ces.Two contr asting scenar ios are outlined in this repor t, the ReferenceScenar io and the Energy [R]ev olution Scenar io. The ReferenceScenar io is based on the Reference Scenar io published by theInternational Energy Agency (IEA) in World Energy Outlook 2004,  andextrapolated forward from 2030.  In its repor t the IEA suggests thatglobal CO2emissions will almos t double as energy demand grows andmost of that demand is met with coal, gas, and oil.The first goal of the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is to cut global carbondioxide emissions in half by mid-century. The second objective is to achievethese reductions while phasing out nuclear energy. This report shows howthe United States can achieve these goals. It outlines how the U.S. canmore fully exploit the large potential for reducing energy demand throughenergy efficiency, to ensure we are using our energy resources wisely. Atthe same time, cost-effective renewable energy sources are accessed forheat, electricity generation, and the production of biofuels.the Energy [R]evolution Scenario describes adevelopment pathway to transform the present situationinto a safe, sustainable energy supply. the key findings ofthe scenario are as follows:•The electricity sector can pioneer renewab le energy development.  By2050,  nearly 80% of electricity can be produced from renewab leenergy sources. In the Energy [R]ev olution Scenar io 34% isgenerated by wind, 18% by solar, 14% by hydro, and 9% biomass.There is a smalle r amount of ocean energy and geothe rmal power, aswell as nearly 20% fossil generation, 85% of which is natur al gas.•Under our Energy [R]ev olution Scenar io total carbon dioxideemissions are reduced 72% withou t resor ting to an increas e indangerous nuclear power or new coal technolog ies.•In the heat suppl y sector, the contr ibution of renewab les will grow tomore than 60% by 2050.  Fossil fuels will be increasi ngly replaced bymore efficient modern technolog ies, in particular biomass,  solar, andgeothe rmal technolog ies.•America’s oil use can be cut over 50% by 2050 with much more efficientcars and trucks potentially including new plug-in hybrids, use of biofuels,and greater reliance on electricity for public transportation.We have a long way to go. Today in America less than 10% ofelectricity is generated renewab ly, while the contr ibution of renewab lesto heat suppl y is only 8%. More than 95% of America’s primaryenergy suppl y still comes from fossil fuels and CO2emissions areprojected to increas e by more than 50% under the Reference Scenar io. The United States faces a significant increas e in expend iture onelectricity suppl y under the Reference Scenar io. The undiminishedgrowth in demand for electricity, increas e in fossil fuel prices, and costof CO2emissions will all result in North America’s electricity suppl ycosts rising from $290 billion per year to $750 billion per year in2050.  The Energy [R]ev olution Scenar io, on the other hand,  not onlymeets global CO2reduc tion targets but also helps to stabilize energycosts and thus relieves the econom ic pressure on society. Increasi ngenergy efficiency and shifting energy suppl y to renewab le energyresour ces reduces the net long-term costs for electricity suppl y by 40%compared to the Reference Scenar io. In other words,  followingstringent environmental targets in the energy sector makes not onlygood environmental sense, but good econom ic sense, as well.to make the energy [r]evolution real and to avoiddangerous climate change, greenpeace recommends that the United States:•phase out of all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy,•set legally binding targets for renewab le energy, •provide defined and stable returns for renewab le energy investors,•guarantee priority access to the grid, and•institute strong efficiency standards for all appliances,  buildings, and vehicles.

United States energy [r]evolution scenario“AN INCREASE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND A GROWING POPULATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO RESULT IN AN EQUIVALENT INCREASE IN ENERGY DEMAND. “

the development of future global energy demand isdetermined by three key factors:•Populati on development:  the numbe r of people consum ing energy orusing energy services.•Econom ic development,  for which Gross Domes tic Product (GDP) isthe most commonl y used indicator . In general, an increas e in GDPtriggers an increas e in energy demand.•Energy intensity: how much energy is required to produce a unit of GDP.Both the Reference and energy [r]evolution scenarios are based on the sameprojections of population and economic development. The future developmentof energy intensity, however, differs between the two, taking into account themeasures to increase energy efficiency under the energy [r]evolution scenario.projection of population developmentFollowing the IEA’s Reference Scenario, which uses United Nationspopulation development projections, the population of America will increasefrom 300 million people now to 420 million in 2050. This continuing growthwill put additional pressure on energy resources and the environment.projection of energy intensityAn increase in economic activity and a growing population does notnecessarily have to result in an equivalent increase in energy demand. There isstill a large potential for exploiting energy efficiency measures. Under theReference Scenario, we assume that energy intensity will be reduced by 1.3%per year, leading to a reduction in final energy demand per unit of GDP ofabout 45% between 2003 and 2050. Under the energy [r]evolution scenario,it is assumed that active policy and technical support for energy efficiencymeasures will lead to an even higher reduction in energy intensity of 70%.development of global energy demandCombi ning the projections on populati on development,  GDP growth andenergy intensity results in future development pathways for energydemand in America. These are shown in Figure 17 for both theReference and the energy [r]evolution scenar ios. Under the ReferenceScenar io, total energy demand increas es by almos t 50% from thecurrent 95,000 PJ/a to 143,000 PJ/a in 2050.  In the energy[r]evolution scenar io, a decreas e is expected to 56,000 PJ/a by 2050,half of the projected consumpti on under the Reference Scenar io.An accelerated increas e in energy efficiency, which is a crucialprerequisite for achieving a sufficiently large share of renewab lesources in energy suppl y, will be benef icial not only for the environmentbut from an econom ic point of view. Taking into account the full lifecycle, in most cases the implementati on of energy efficiency measuressaves money compared to increasi ng energy suppl y. A dedicated energyefficiency strategy therefore helps to compensate in part for theadditional costs required during the market introduction phase ofrenewab le energy sources.Under the energy [r]evolution scenar io, electricity demand is expectedto decreas e. With the exploitation of efficiency measures,  an increas ecan be avoided despite continuing econom ic growth, leading toelectricity demand of around 3,600 TWh/a in 2050.  Compared to theReference Scenar io, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about3,200 TWh/a.  This reduc tion in energy demand can be achieved inparticular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using thebest available technolog y in all demand sectors. Introduction of passivesolar design in both residential and comme rcial buildings will help tocurb the growing demand for active air-cond itioning.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the energy[r]evolution scenario, final demand for heat supply will experience a steepdecline (see Figure 17). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumptionequivalent to 87,500 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. Asa result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residentialbuildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and ‘passivehouses’ for new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energyservices will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.In the transpor t sector, which is not analysed in detail in the presentstudy, it is assumed under the energy [r]evolution scenar io that energydemand will decreas e by 10% to 27,000 PJ/a by 2050,  saving half ofthe demand expected under the Reference Scenar io. This reduc tion canbe achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shiftingthe transpor t of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-related behav iour patte rns.figure 17:usa: projection of energy demand by sector in the reference and energy [r]evolution scenarios

electricity generationThe development of the electricity suppl y sector is characterised by adynam ically growing renewab le energy market and an increasi ng shareof renewab le electricity. This will compensate for the phasi ng out ofnuclear energy and reduce the numbe r of fossil fuel-fired power plantsrequired for grid stabilisation. By 2050 nearly 80% of the electricityproduced in the United States will come from renewab le energysources. ‘New’  renewab les - mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV -will contr ibute most of electricity generation. The following strategypaves the way for a future renewab le energy suppl y:•The phasi ng out of nuclear energy and rising electricity demand willbe met initially by bringing into operation new highly efficient gas-fired combi ned-cycle power plants,  plus an increasi ng capac ity ofwind turbines and biomass.  In the long term, wind will be the mostimpor tant single source of electricity generation.•Solar energy, hydro and biomass will make substantial contributions toelectricity generation. In particular, as non-fluctuating renewable energysources, hydro, biomass and solar thermal, combined with efficient heatstorage, will be important elements in the overall generation mix.•The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from thecurrent 107 GW to 888 GW in 2050. Increasing renewable capacity by afactor of eight within the next 43 years requires political support andwell-designed policy instruments, however. There will be a considerabledemand for investment in new production capacity over the next 20 years.As investment cycles in the power sector are long, decisions onrestructuring America’s energy supply system need to be taken now.To achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable energy sources, abalanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is of great importance.This mobilisation depends on technical potentials, cost reduction andtechnological maturity. Figure 22 shows the comparative evolution of thedifferent renewable technologies over time. Up to 2010, hydro power andbiomass will remain the main contributors to the growing market share.After 2020, the growing use of wind will take over the lead, complementedby electricity from photovoltaics and solar thermal power plants.This scenario is only one possible renewable future. Relative growth ratesshould not be taken for a Greenpeace endorsement of one technologyover another, but instead reflect the current understanding of resourcepotential and somewhat conservative assumptions about expectedtechnological development. There are several renewable resources andtechnologies that could provide a much larger source of energy in thefuture than projected here. Geothermal power plants, for example, couldultimately provide far more energy than is reflected in our scenario ifrecent evaluations by the U.S. Department of Energy’s NationalRenewable Energy Laboratory hold up. Similarly, ocean energy and solarthermal power, both of which have tremendous resource potential, couldturn out to be more attractive than is currently understood. Therefore, thescenario presented here may be quite conservative, given the sheer size ofthe renewable resource base and the opportunity for technologyadvancement and cost reductions during the study period.

heat supplyDevelopment of renewab les in the heat suppl y sector raises differentissues.  Today, renewab les provide 8% of primary energy demand forheat suppl y, the main contr ibution coming from the use of biomass.  Thelack of district heating networ ks is a severe structural barrier to thelarge-scale utilisation of geothe rmal and solar thermal energy. Pastexperience shows that it is easier to implement effective suppor tinstruments in the grid-connec ted electricity sector than in the heatmarket, with its multitud e of different actors. Dedicated suppor tinstruments are required to ensure a dynam ic development.•Energy efficiency measures can decreas e the current demand for heat suppl y by 30%.•The increasi ng contr ibution of decentr alised combi ned heat andpower production in a shrinking heat market will lead to a CHPshare of nearly 20% in 2050.•For direct heating, solar collec tors, biomass/bi ogas as well asgeothe rmal energy will increasi ngly replace fossil fuel-fired systems.•A shift from coal and oil to natur al gas in the remai ning conventionalapplications will lead to a further reduc tion of CO2emissions.

primary energy consumptionTaking into account the assumpti ons discuss ed above, the resulti ngprimary energy consumpti on in America under the energy [r]evolutionscenar io is shown in Figure 26. Compared to the Reference Scenar io,overall energy demand will be reduced by over 60% in 2050.  Half ofthe remai ning demand will be covered by renewab le energy sources.Note that becaus e of the ‘efficiency method’  used for the calculati on ofprimary energy consumpti on, which postulates that the amount ofelectricity generation from hydro, wind, solar and geothe rmal energyequals the primary energy consumpti on, the share of renewab les seemsto be lower than their actual impor tance as energy suppl iers.development of CO2emissionsWhilst emissions of CO2in the United States will increase by over 50%under the Reference Scenario, under the energy [r]evolution scenariothey will decrease from 5,600 million tons in 2003 to 1,550 m/t in2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 19.2 t to 3.7 t. Inspite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing demand, CO2emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiencygains and the increased use of biofuels will even reduce emissions in thetransport sector. Transport will take over as the largest source of CO2emissions in the Unites Sates, with a share of 62% in 2050.figure 25:usa: development of primary energyconsumption under the reference scenario figure 26:usa: development of primary energyconsumption under the energy [r]evolution scenario (‘EFFICIENCY’ = REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE REFERENCE SCENARIO)
figure 27:usa: development of co2emissions by sector under the energy [r]evolution scenario(‘EFFICIENCY’ = REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE REFERENCE SCENARIO)


future costs of electricity generationFigure 28 shows that the introduction of renewab le technolog ies underthe energy [r]evolution scenar io will still be competiti ve with the costsof electricity generation in the Reference Scenar io, partly becaus e ofthe additional CO2emission costs that will be impos ed on powergeneration from 2010 onwards.  From 2020 the cost difference willincreas e from about 0.4 cents/kWh up to 1.8 cents/kWh in 2050.  Notethat any increas e in fossil fuel prices beyond the projection given inTable 3 will reduce the gap between the two scenar ios. Due to growing demand, we face a significant increase in society’sexpenditure on electricity supply. Under the Reference Scenario, theunchecked growth in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the costof CO2emissions result in total electricity supply costs for North Americarising from today’s $290 billion per year to more than $750 bn in 2050.Figure 29 shows that the energy [r]evolution scenario not only complieswith global CO2reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costsand relieve the economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiencyand shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs forelectricity supply that are 40% lower than in the Reference Scenario. Itbecomes clear that pursuing stringent environmental targets in the energysector also pays off in terms of economics.

Greenpeace is a global organisation that uses non-v iolent directaction to tackle the most crucial threats to our planet’s biodiversityand environment.  Greenpeace is a non-pr ofit organisation, present in40 countr ies across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. Itspeaks for 2.8 million suppor ters worldwide, and inspires manymillions more to take action every day. To maintain itsindepend ence, Greenpeace does not accept donati ons fromgovernments or corporations but relies on contr ibutions fromindividual suppor ters and foundati on grants.Greenpeace has been campai gning against environmentaldegradati on since 1971 when a small boat of voluntee rs andjournalists sailed into Amch itka, an area north of Alaska,  where theUS Government was conduc ting underground nuclear tests.
