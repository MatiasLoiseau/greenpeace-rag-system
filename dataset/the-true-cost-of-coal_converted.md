The True
Cost of Coal
How people and the
planet are paying the price
for the world's dirtiest fuel

Section

Introduction

1

Coal burning has existed for centuries, and its use as a fuel has
been recorded since the 1100s. It powered the Industrial Revolution,
changing the course of first Britain, and then the world, in the
process. In the US, the first coal-fired power plant – Pearl Street
Station – opened on the shores of the lower East River in New York
City in September 1882.1 Shortly thereafter, coal became the staple
diet for power plants across the world.

Today, coal is used to produce nearly 40% of the world’s
electricity.2 However, burning coal is one of the most
harmful practices on the planet. It causes irreparable
damage to the environment, people’s health and
communities around the world. The coal industry isn’t
paying for the damage it causes, but the world at large is.
It’s this cost – the true cost of coal – that this report
reveals, showing and quantifying its effects on people
and the environment around the world.

Spiralling energy demand means that the use of coal is
on the rise– and at an alarming rate. Between 1999 and
2006, coal use around the world grew by 30%. Similar
increases are predicted for the future if we do not reduce
our dependence on this dirtiest of fossil fuels.

The single greatest threat facing our climate

The fact is that coal is the most polluting energy source
around, and the dominant source of the world’s carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions. Across the planet, 11 billion
tonnes3 of CO2 come from coal-fired power generation
every year.4 In 2005, this made up just about 41% of all
fossil fuel CO2 emissions.5 If plans to build new coal-fired
power plants go ahead, CO2 emissions from coal will
increase 60% by 2030.6

Climate change is the greatest environmental threat and
humanitarian and economic challenge the world has ever
faced. Millions of people are already feeling the impacts
of climate change and an estimated 150,000 people die
each year from its effects.7 To avoid the worst impacts of
climate change, including widespread drought, flooding
and massive population displacement caused by rising
sea levels, temperature increases must peak as far below
2ºC (compared to pre-industrial levels) as possible. To do
this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) in its Fourth Assessment Report indicates that
global greenhouse gas emissions must peak at the latest
by 2015.

How we deal with the coal question will make or break
whether we get there. Indeed, James Hansen, the top
NASA scientist, has stated that the ‘single most important
action’ needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce
CO2 emissions from coal– an opinion repeated by experts
around the world.8

Why is revealing the true cost of coal important?

Coal may be the cheapest fossil fuel on the market, but
its market price is only half the story. The financial price
includes a range of factors, from mining and retailing
costs to government taxes and, of course, profit, but it
ignores some of the biggest taxes, and costs of coal: the
tremendous human and environmental damage it causes.
If the true cost of coal to governments and people around
the world were reflected in its market price, the viability of
building ever more coal plants would be very different.

This damage doesn’t start and finish with the CO2
emissions caused during coal burning. The entire process
– or chain of custody – from mining, through combustion
to waste disposal, and in some cases recultivation, has a
dire impact on the environment, human health and the
social fabric of communities living near mines, plants and
waste sites. It severely disrupts ecosystems and
contaminates water supplies. It emits other greenhouse
gases like nitrogen oxide and methane, as well as black
carbon and toxic chemicals like mercury and arsenic.
Leaking waste ruins fish stocks and agriculture, and
therefore also livelihoods. It directly contributes to health
problems like black lung disease. Because none of these
are reflected in the price of coal, they’re referred to
“external costs”.

As more coal-fired power plants are built, external costs
will increase dramatically. We’re talking vast sums –
particularly when it comes to fighting global warming
caused by burning coal. In 2006, the Stern Review on the
Economics of Climate Change insisted that 1% of global
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year needs to be
invested to combat climate change12 – Stern increased
the estimate to 2% in June 2008.13 What’s more,
according to the review, costs required to tackle the
effects of climate change could reach between 5% and
20% of the global GDP by 2100.14

An urgent need for action

The true cost of coal underlines the urgent need for action
to avoid the disastrous consequences of a coal-powered
future. While most governments so far have been slow to
react, community movements are forming across the
globe and demanding an end to coal. These movements
are strong and gaining momentum.

The good news is that a future without coal is possible: the
world already has enough technically accessible renewable
energy to meet current energy demands six times over.
For example, it is estimated that the world's wind
resources alone could generate enough power to supply
twice the projected electricity consumption in 2020.15

These external costs are inevitably paid by society – often
by its poorest members. In Jharia, India, thousands of
people living around the area’s decaying coal mine endure
horrendous living conditions caused by uncontrollable coal
fires.9 In Russia, unsafe mining conditions have meant
injury and death for scores of workers.10 In the Kuyavia-
Pomerania region of Poland, mining activities have caused
the water level of Lake Ostrowskie to drop dramatically.11
This list of examples could go on indefinitely.

Greenpeace’s Energy [R]evolution16 blueprint shows how
renewable sources of energy, combined with greater
energy efficiency, can cut global CO2 emissions from fossil
fuels by 50% and deliver half the world’s energy needs by
2050. Moving to a renewable future would save the world
up to US$ 180 billion a year in comparison to business as
usual.17 This is the exact amount needed in extra aid to
reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by their
target date of 2015.

Coal powered the Industrial Revolution. Now, clean
energy technologies need to take over and power a new
revolution in energy to help the world escape the clutches
of climate change.

In purely economic terms, the continued use of coal is
also a ticking time-bomb. Greenpeace’s own preliminary
analysis of the true costs of coal, conducted by the
Dutch Research Institute CE Delft, shows that damages
attributable to the coal chain of custody amount to
roughly €360 billion in 2007 (See The True Cost of Coal,
page 9). This figure is most certainly an underestimation,
as it doesn’t account for all damages caused by coal.
Nevertheless, it gives an idea of the scale of harm we
subject ourselves and our environment to by continuing
to mine and burn coal.

The True
Cost of Coal

Section

The True Cost of Coal

Traditionally considered the cheapest fuel around, the
market price for coal ignores its most significant
impacts. These so-called "external costs" manifests
themselves as damages such as respiratory
diseases, mining accidents, acid rain, smog pollution,
reduced agricultural yields and climate change.

The harm caused by mining and burning coal is not
reflected in its price per tonne or its costs for a kWh
of electricity, but the world at large is nevertheless
paying for it. This report seeks to answer the
question: just how much are we paying? While it
currently isn’t possible to account for all the
devastation coal wreaks on a global scale, it is
possible to approximate the annual damage costs
for some of its more conspicuous impacts.

At the request of Greenpeace, the Dutch research
institute CE Delft conducted a preliminary analysis of
the external costs of impacts to human health and
the environment caused by coal mining and
combustion. This evaluation focused on the external
costs in 2007 of damages attributable to climate
change, human health impacts from air pollution
and fatalities due to major mining accidents –
factors for which reasonably reliable global data is
currently available.

Based on the factors examined, the analysis reveals:
• Coal-fired power stations caused an estimated

€356 billion worth of damage in 2007;

• Accidents in the global coal power chain cost

at least €161 million in 2007; and

• Mining carries with it hidden damage costs, which

came to at least €674 million in 2007.

Combining all the costs listed above, CE Delft arrived
at a global figure of roughly €360 billion. Over the
next ten years, this could mean costs in excess of
€3,6 trillion – a sum of money equal to more than six
times the price of the 2008 economic bailout of
troubled financial institutions in the US ($US 700
billion, October 2008).

This ﬁgure estimates a lower limit for the annual costs
coal exacts on humans and the environment. To do the
calculation, CE Delft used International Energy Agency
data to assemble coal combustion emission ﬁgures for
the largest coal-power producing countries – US, China,
India, Japan, Germany, South Africa, Australia, Russia
and Poland – which together account for 85% of global
coal combustion emissions. Together with emissions
from other EU countries, 91% of global coal combustion
emissions were included in the ﬁnal calculation.
Additionally, emissions attributable to coal mining
operations globally were collected along with data
related to major accidents in the coal power chain.18

This staggering number is most likely an
underestimation of the yearly damages caused by coal
around the world, as not all the impacts was assessed,
while costs for climate change are expected to increase
dramatically in the future. In many ways, the true cost of
coal on a global scale defies calculation, largely due to
the absence of data that reliably catalogues coal’s every
negative effect. What's more, quantifying social
impacts, such as community displacement, loss of
cultural heritage and human rights violations in a
credible manner is virtually impossible. While the figure
presented above does not precisely quantify coal’s
every cost, it does provide a sense of the scale of harm
we subject ourselves and our environment to by
continuing to mine and burn coal.

In an age of high energy prices and seemingly
insatiable energy appetites, the lowest-cost energy
sources tend to be the most favoured. While coal
might be comparatively cheap in the marketplace, in
reality the cost of coal is far too high and the world
simply cannot afford to continue using it. Given the
availability of alternatives such as renewable energy
and energy efficiency, which can meet our energy
needs in a safe and climate-friendly way, there is no
need to continue relying on coal. We must reduce our
dependence on this dirty fuel and abandon plans to
build new coal-fired power stations. The true cost of
failing to do this – and not harnessing instead the
potential of a clean, sustainable energy – is
something we dare not contemplate.

Coal – a dirty fuel
that’s destroying
our climate

Coal burning contributes more to climate change than any other
fossil fuel. Coal-fired power stations pump vast amounts of CO2
into the atmosphere each year, 11 billion tonnes to be precise.19
This amounts to 72% of CO2 emissions from power generation
and 41% of total global emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels.20

Climate change is the greatest environmental threat and
humanitarian and economic challenge the world has ever
faced. Millions of people are already feeling the impacts of
sea-level rise and coastal erosion and the increasing
intensity of natural disasters such as floods, droughts,
severe storms and forest fires. Such effects will only get
worse as temperatures rise. More frequent severe
weather will also affect agriculture and further undermine
food security. A warming world could also see diseases
like dengue fever and malaria spreading. If nothing is done
to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global
warming gas, one-quarter of plant and animal species
face increased risk of extinction.21

In Bangladesh and India alone, the impacts of climate
change such as sea-level rise and drought could force
125 million people from their homes. Up to 1.2 billion
people in Asia could suffer increased water shortages by
2020, according to the United Nations climate panel.
Wheat production could disappear from the African
continent.22

Society as we know it is at risk if CO2 emissions are not
rapidly cut. Coal use lies at the root of the problem.

As the single largest source of CO2 emissions, the manner
in which we deal with coal in the coming years will

determine whether we can respond adequately to the
climate crisis. The urgency in this matter simply cannot
be understated. As former US Vice President Al Gore
recently remarked, “We've reached the stage where it is
time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of
new coal plants.”23 A coal plant built today will emit CO2
pollution for at least the next 40 years.

In the power sector, the coming two decades will witness
the largest turnover in electricity generating technology
the world has ever seen. Existing plants will need to be
retired. Decisions made by nations and power utilities on
how to manage this turnover will define our energy supply
for the next generation. In contrast, a business-as-usual
approach would allow CO2 emissions from coal to rise by
60% by 2030.

Those peddling technological fixes – such as carbon
capture and storage (See Carbon Capture and Storage
(CCS) – the flawed case for business as usual, page 12),
which claims to make coal clean and safe for the climate
– create a dangerous distraction as the world seeks truly
sustainable solutions that will reduce emissions and
protect our climate. It is only by quitting coal and
increasing energy efficiency and production of renewable
energy that we will prevent catastrophic climate change.

Carbon Capture
and Storage (CCS) –
the flawed case for
business as usual

CCS aims to reduce the climate impact of burning
fossil fuels by capturing CO2 from power plant
smokestacks and dumping it underground.

Its future development has been widely promoted by
the coal industry as a justification for the construction
of new coal-fired power plants and ‘business as
usual’. But CCS cannot deliver in time to avoid
dangerous climate change – the earliest possibility for
deployment of CCS at a useful scale is not expected
until at least 2030, while global greenhouse gas
emissions must start falling after 2015 to avoid the
worst impacts of climate change.

Concerns about the feasibility, costs, safety, and
liability of CCS also make it a massive gamble – one
that risks taking attention and investment away from
the deployment of renewable energy sources. A
recent survey of 1,000 ‘climate decision-makers and
influencers’ around the world revealed substantial
doubt in the ability of CCS to deliver. Just 34% were
confident that retrofitting ‘clean coal technology’
to existing power plants could reduce CO2 emissions
over the next 25 years without unacceptable side
effects, and only 36% were confident in its ability to
deliver low-carbon energy from new power plants.24
In short, CCS won’t be ready in time to save the
climate, and should not be used as an excuse to
continue burning coal.

For more information about CCS, see the 2008
Greenpeace report ‘False Hope: Why carbon capture
and storage won’t save the climate’ –

Climate change is already having a serious social, ecological
and economical impact. We are already close to the threshold of
irreversible change for certain parts of the climate system, such
as the Arctic sea ice. Preventing dangerous climate change means
halting the growth in CO2 emissions by 2015, and then more than
halving CO2 output by 2050. The inescapable conclusion is that we
have to phase out use of coal.

An elderly woman looks out from
her balcony on to the floods in
Arles, France. Climate change is
projected to make extreme river
floods even more frequent in some
areas, especially in central,
northern and northeastern Europe.
From 1998-2002, Europe suffered
about 100 damaging floods causing
some 700 fatalities, the
displacement of about half a million
people, and at least 25 billion Euros
in insured economic losses.

Drought in Australia has forced
grazers already facing economic
hardship to re-evaluate stock
numbers, prompting large livestock
sales throughout the country.
Climate change will only make this
worse. Rising temperatures will
likely increase the occurrence and
severity of droughts in southern
and eastern Australia, exacerbating
security problems. Production from
agriculture and forestry is
projected to decline by 2030 over
much of the region as a result.

A winter drought caused crop
losses of around 80% amongst corn
farmers in the Rio Grande

pictured here, normally harvests 120
sacks per hectare but in 2005 he
only harvested 28. The agricultural
sector is extremely sensitive to
climate variability. Decreases in
precipitation are predicted by the
end of the 21st century for the
Northern and Southern Tropics. In
some African countries, yields from
rain-fed agriculture could be
reduced by up to 50% by 2020.

The Chain of Custody

Coal’s legacy

The damage caused by coal doesn’t end once it’s burnt. At
the end of the chain are coal combustion wastes (known
collectively as CCW), abandoned mines, devastated
communities and ravaged landscapes. CCWs are toxic
and often laced with lead, arsenic and cadmium that can
cause poisoning, kidney diseases and cancer respectively.
Acid mine drainage (AMD) damages soils and makes
water unsafe for consumption. Collapsing mines cause
land to subside, resulting in structural damage to homes
and buildings and infrastructure like highways, buildings
and bridges. Attempts to mitigate the devastation left once
coal is removed are inadequate at best. “Reclaimed” land
never quite recovers; poisoned communities remain
contaminated; and no matter how hard you scrub,
the social fabric of human societies is forever dirtied with
coal dust.

Every link in the chain of custody contributes to the
overall damage caused by coal – each in its own
particular way. This damage is real. It will only get worse
in the future if nothing is done. And it all forms part of the
true cost of coal.

Coal’s journey from the ground to the waste heap is often
called its chain of custody. The chain has three main links
– mining coal, burning coal and disposing of coal’s
waste. When you look at the facts, one thing very quickly
becomes obvious: each part of the chain causes
irreparable damage to our planet and the health of the
people on it. In the next section, Coal first hand, we
share the stories of people who are feeling these effects
of coal today.

Mining coal

Mining causes widespread deforestation, soil erosion,
water shortages and pollution, smouldering coal fires
and the emission of greenhouse gases. Massive
excavation operations strip land bare, lower water tables,
generate huge waste mountains and blanket surrounding
communities with dust particles and debris. Mining leads
to the loss of fertile soils through erosion, while runoff into
nearby water bodies clogs rivers and smothers aquatic
life. It kills miners quickly through accidents, or more
slowly with black lung disease. And it also displaces
whole communities, forced to abandon their homes
because of coal mines, coal fires, landslides and
contaminated water supplies.

Burning coal

Coal combustion leaves a similar trail of destruction in its
wake. The huge volumes of water needed to “wash” coal
and cool operating power stations cause water
shortages in many areas. Pollutants spewed from
smokestacks threaten public health and the environment
– fine dust particles are a major cause of pulmonary
(lung) disease; mercury harms neurological development
in children and the unborn; and coal-fired power plants
are the biggest single source of polluting emissions,
such as carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides
and methane, contributing to climate change and
causing acid rain and smog.

Coal
first hand

When calculating the true cost of coal, we can
assess much of the damage - like the cost of
health care, harm caused by climate change,
and mining accidents in - financial terms. But
it’s impossible to put a cost on everything.

3

How do you calculate every single instance of
environmental damage? How do you quantify human
rights abuses suffered by workers in the coal industry?
How can you put a price on communities seeing their
culture eroded?

The following stories come from those directly affected by
coal, right now, shedding light on these unquantifiable
issues. They all come from countries particularly afflicted
by coal, showing its effects at each stage of its lifecycle:
from mining to combustion and coal’s dirty legacy.

In Columbia, indigenous communities are threatened and
forced off their lands to make way for coal mines;
thousands in Jharia, India, suffer from horrendous living
conditions because of uncontrollable coal fires; in Russia,
unsafe mining conditions have meant injury and death for
scores of workers

In places like Indonesia, China and Thailand air pollution
from coal combustion is destroying livelihoods, damaging
ancient relics, reducing crop yields and killing people. The
legacy of mining ensures that land in South Africa will
continue to be poisoned by acid mine drainage long after
mines are closed, while in the Kuyavia-Pomerania region
of Poland, mining activities have caused the water level of
Lake Ostrowskie to drop dramatically. In the United States
coal has meant blowing up mountains, burying streams
and contaminating nearby communities. In Germany,
reclaiming opencast mines has created dead lakes with
water as acid as vinegar.

However, in response to the unmitigated destruction and
harm caused by coal, communities are rising up. In
Australia, winemakers, horsebreeders, local residents and
miners are saying no to mine expansion and yes to a just
transition to renewable energy. In the Philippines, a
diverse group has united to oppose a new coal-fired
power station, calling instead for clean energy
development. Stories such as these inspire, provide hope
and point the direction towards a better future – one not
marred by dirty coal but fuelled by energy sources that
are safe, sustainable and will protect our climate.

CZN was run as a joint venture between ExxonMobil and
the Colombian government from the 1980s until 2001,
when it was taken over by a consortium of European-
based mining companies including BHP Billiton, Glencore,
and Anglo-American.26 Covering 150 square miles in
southern Guajira, the site consists of an integrated mine,
railroad, and coastal export terminal.27 While it currently
produces about 30 million tonnes of coal per year, the
mining company is investing US$1 billion to increase
production to 40 million tonnes per year by 2011.28

The Colombian government claims that the mine brings
progress to the poverty-stricken region of La Guajira. But
the reality is that Afro-Colombian and indigenous
communities are under siege by the mine (see Violated,
p.23 ). Much of the land close to the mine is
uninhabitable due to blasting, dust and contamination.
Miners and local communities suffer from poor health
and the loss of land, homes, livelihoods and even life.
The surrounding air is polluted by fly ash and methane,
and the water is contaminated by waste sludge and a
cocktail of other chemicals.29

The effects of CZN first hand

False promises

The Wayuu indigenous people from Tamaquito are some
of the worst affected by the mine. Initially, they were
promised something very different: “On arrival, the
mining company offered the Wayuu participation in the
benefits of the coal mining. This implied ‘development’
and ‘progress’, which for the Wayuu meant a solution
to the problems of poor water supplies, education, and
health care,” said Remedios Fajardo Gómez.30 “The
contamination arrived as mining operations advanced.
Coal dust and noise from the equipment and the
explosions have affected human, animal and plant life in
the communities near the mine. Several Wayuu died and
others were permanently injured by poisoning, after
eating contaminated garbage from the mining
company’s dumps.”31

Jairo Dionisio Fuentes Epiayu, the governor of Tamaquito,
told us what happened next:

“As time passed, the relationship with the mining
companies went from bad to worse, and we started to
see the bad implications of the [mining] proposal… the
companies continuously violate our rights, they do not
respect our traditional laws that must be applied to

22

compensate the irreversible damage they have caused to
the communities and to nature.” 32

Today, Tamaquito is isolated, without employment, and
without access to schooling, health services and transport
links. The villagers’ livelihoods are threatened, as they are
left without any means of subsistence. “We realised we
had made a mistake,” Jairo said. “The mine has
completely surrounded us. We do not have access to
roads to leave our village, our children cannot access
schools, we have to walk on trails, and it takes us four
hours to go to the nearest village... CZN does not even
allow us on its property to hunt, and our hunting grounds
are depleted because of the mine. We need to support
ourselves by hunting, by planting, but now Cerrejón has
bought all the land, so we have no chance of surviving.”33

Forced displacement and isolation

In 1980, the community Media Luna was chosen as the
spot to construct the port needed to ship coal from CZN
around the world.34 Next to the port, the mining company
also built an airport, a train terminal and a complete
industry complex.

At the time, 750 Wayuu lived at Media Luna. Initially, the
company and residents of Media Luna started
negotiations towards a resettlement programme.
However, community members were threatened and
shouted at by company representatives in the process
and the negotiations eventually broke down.

The Wayuu were forced to relocate to an area nearby, but
it didn’t take long for their new home to become heavily
contaminated with air and water pollution from the mine.
The company ordered the Wayuu to move again, but 42
people from seven families refused to leave. The mining
company’s response? They put a chain-linked fence
around the families living there. They put locks on the gate
to the fence and armed guards patrolled the area to
report the movements of the residents. The residents
were also harassed, prevented from building new houses,
and even denied access to water. Still they stayed, and
they continue to do so today.

Demolition and destitution

The Wayuu are not the only community to have been
displaced by force. A number of Afro-Colombian
communities were dispersed without compensation when
the mine was first being developed.

image Even the health of those not
working in the mines is affected by
mining operations. Air pollution drifts
into nearby villages, causing
respiratory problems and skin rashes
in the communities there.

One of these was Tabaco, which was wiped off the map
in 2002 to allow for the expansion of the Cerrejón mine.
On that occasion, employees of the mine, armed security
guards, and even the army, forced residents to leave
under threat. Some were even literally dragged out from
their homes before the village was levelled with
bulldozers.35 Today, Tabaco lies buried in the middle of the
coal mine. Its residents have been scattered, with about
60 families still living in inadequate provisional dwellings in
the coal town Albania.

Emilio Pérez, a former resident of Tabaco, spoke of life
there before the mine. “Life was rich. We shared, and no
one suffered because we shared what we had,” he
explained. “There was a river near the town. We had land.
We walked freely all over the territory. But the last six
years we have had no land to work. We are displaced,
and we have no lodging.” 36 Under Colombian law,
indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities can claim
collective land titles that they identify as ancestral lands.
However, although the Tabaco community has farmed
their lands for centuries, they cannot pursue legal titles
because the land quite literally isn’t there anymore; it has
been swallowed up by the mine and completely
destroyed.37

Illegal negotiation tactics

Another community threatened with the same fate as
Tabaco is nearby Chancleta. Here, the mine company has
been putting pressure on the inhabitants in a new and
sinister way, using “divide and rule” tactics to weaken and
ultimately break up local communities. Chancleta residents
were intimidated if they sought collective negotiation, they
were told that they must agree to individual settlements –
or get nothing. The president of the Chancleta
neighbourhood council, Wilman Palmezano explains more:

“From the beginning, the mining companies chose to
negotiate with the villagers on an individual basis to
assess compensation for land and houses. However,
most communities want to conduct collective negotiations
to obtain a new area to rebuild their village with houses,
land and an infrastructure of roads, schools and
churches.” 38

The company is now negotiating collectively with
Chancleta. In the past the company refused to do this,
but now it has changed tactics, partly as a result of
intensified pressure applied to it, both nationally and
internationally.

The outlook

Forced displacement of hundreds of families from their
homes and lands, destruction of collective and family
relationships, damage to health, death of flora and fauna –
no mining company can justify so many violations.

What makes the situation even more tragic is that the
residents of Chancleta, Media Luna and Tabaco did not
realise the coming of the mine would mean the end of
their community. By the time they did, it was too late. It’s
likely that they won’t be the last communities to suffer the
same fate.

Story By: Erika Bjureby

Violated

Claims about the benefits coal brings to the world -
such as employment and cheap electricity - do not
take account of the people that actually reside in
mining regions. Mining operations regularly displace
whole communities and can force people off their
land because of coal fires, subsidence, contaminated
water supplies, air pollution and other damage.

The Colombian case study clearly shows the dire
impact of coal mining on communities living next to
mines. The villagers in this story were seeking only to
enhance the quality of their existence, and instead
wound up having to defend their lives and their land.

As if this was not enough, the struggle of the workers
against conditions in the mines has resulted in the
murder of four trade unionists in Colombia. Four
leaders of the Sintamienergética miners’ union, who
worked for the Drummond mine - a US-based coal
company - in northern Colombia, were murdered in
2001 by right-wing paramilitary forces near the firm’s
La Loma operation. The case was brought to court in
the USA to expose Drummond's involvement with the
paramilitary and violence against workers in Colombia.
However, in the end, Drummond was found “not
liable” in the deaths of the trade unionists. This ruling,
of course, further worsened conditions for the workers
and exacerbated the conflict between the union and
the company. This is just one example of how coal’s
impact on human rights in Colombia, and elsewhere in
the world, worsens day by day.

Jharia is one of the most important
coal mines in India and one of the
largest in Asia. Once a treasure trove
of high-quality coking coal,
uncontrollable coal fires have turned
the mine into a slow-burning inferno.

An illegal coal picker stabs at the
ground in search of coal under
the surface. The coal she collects
will be sold at the local market to
pay for her food.

Illegal coal pickers cautiously
collect coal during the day while
keeping one eye on the security

Collecting coal is a family effort –
every able body is expected to
help. As a result, many children

collector, lives in a one-room house in one of the active
fire zones called Bokapahadi. The floor of her house has a
huge crack running through it, and fumes from
underneath fill the house. She told us:

“I have lived here for 40 years. Last year, the floor cracked
and since then my house is on fire. When we walk barefoot,
our feet burn. At night, my children feel suffocated due to
the pungent fumes. Eight of us sleep in this room. We have
nowhere to go, neither do we have the money to make
another house. Probably we will die here.”40

Lung and skin disease

Ill health adds to the sense of despair in the town.
Pollution invades everything – air, water and land. Smoke
from the fires contains poisonous gases including carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen
oxide. These fumes, along with fine coal dust from the
fires, cause several lung and skin diseases.

The problem is made worse by the fact that most mine
workers, including shovel drivers, do not wear masks,
boots or overalls. It’s no surprise that the most common
diseases in this area are pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis,
asthma and other chronic lung disorders. Dr Rajiv
Agarwal, a local doctor in Jharia, told us that, “Most
patients who are mine workers suffer from
pneumoconiosis here. Once it is detected, there is not
much one can do. A film of coal soot covers the lungs.
Anaemia and malnutrition are also very common, a fall out
of abject poverty and extreme labour in mining areas.” 41

Miners bear the brunt of it, but everyone is affected. Shanti
lives in Lodhna, also a fire zone. She told us, “I have
continuing headaches due to the noxious gases around. It
lasts for days. My children are also down with headache
most of the time. At times, there is no one to go to work
because my husband has TB. He coughs blood and is very
sick. I hope we get over these troubled times soon.” 42

Despite the obvious evidence to the contrary, when
asked about safety provisions, Mr Subrata Chowdhury,
ex-chairman and managing director of BCCL,
completely denied the fact that workers suffer from
respiratory disorders.

Crumbling under fire and subsidence, Jharia is a place of
smouldering land and noxious fumes that make breathing
difficult. Yet thousands of inhabitants cling to this
collapsing town, eking out a living. Many of them are
illegal coal collectors, who spend their days frantically
picking up pieces of coal from the mine dump to sell at
the local market for 50 Rupees (US$1.20) a basket.

It’s a miserable existence. To make matters worse, the
threat of displacement hovers over their heads on a daily
basis as the fires continue to spread (see Burning Just
Below the Surface, p 29)

How did it come to this?

Before coal was unearthed in this area, Jharia was a belt
of dense forests inhabited by tribes. Agriculture and cattle
rearing were the basic forms of livelihood.

Lore has it that King Raja Shiv Prasad Singh, who reigned
over Jharia and surrounding areas, first leased 200 acres
of land to a Gujarati merchant for just Rs 200 (US$5) to
start mining.

The mine grew, and soon the fires started – smouldering
coal seams and waste heaps set alight by neglect and
poor mining techniques. Since the first fire was seen in
Jharia in 1916 (in a colliery called Bohra), unscientific
mining39 has been the prime reason behind the spread of
fire and subsidence. One particularly bad period was just
after 1971, when the mines were nationalised and a
public sector company called Bharat Coking Coal Limited
(BCCL) took over Jharia. These new owners started to dig
huge opencast mines to get to seams of coal near the
surface – a cheaper way of mining. Once used, these
enormous coal pits were then abandoned, leaving the
coal seams exposed to the atmosphere. This caused the
seams to ignite. Once alight, these fires are virtually
impossible to put out. According to BCCL, there are 67
active fire zones in Jharia today.

Jharia first hand

Horrendous living conditions

Thousands of poor, mostly unskilled, migrants from
neighbouring states have settled in Jharia over the years.
Most of them collect coal illegally to pay for their two
meals a day. This has put huge pressure on the existing
infrastructure. Gayatri Devi, a 50-year-old illegal coal

Burning Just Below the Surface

Coal seams, storage piles or waste piles that have
started to burn and can’t be put out are known as
coal fires. Their cause is spontaneous combustion
– a process whereby the interaction of oxygen with
coal creates heat. Mining operations accelerate this
process because they expose formerly covered
coal piles to oxygen and additionally lead to the
accumulation of large coal waste and storage piles.
Coal fires can also be ignited by lightning or forest
fires. For example, in Indonesia the same fires used
to clear large tracts of rainforest for mining have lit
over 300 coal fires since the 1980s.46

Coal ﬁres contribute to climate change by releasing
huge amounts of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere. Health and environmental impacts
from coal mine ﬁres can be also be quite severe.
Coal ﬁres release toxic elements, such as arsenic,
mercury and selenium, into the atmosphere where
they can be inhaled, settle on crops and foods, be
taken up by livestock or build up in the tissues of
birds and ﬁsh. Additional harmful emissions from
these ﬁres also include high benzene, toluene,
xylene, and ethylbenzene.47

Their long-term impacts are immense – once a
mine has created a path for oxygen to reach a coal
seam, coal fires can burn underground for
hundreds of years. The world’s oldest known coal
fire has been smouldering in Australia for more than
2,000 years.48

Displacement

In spite of all these issues, what people worry about most
is displacement. Technical director of BCCL, T.K.Lahiry,
recently announced:

“Loss of good quality coking coal is a national loss. It is in
a way degradation of environment. BCCL is losing its
profitability and people are living in extremely unsafe
conditions. The only solution is to rehabilitate people
inhabiting such hazardous areas.”43

This rehabilitation comes in the form of the Jharia Action
Plan – a Rs 60 billion (US$1.5 billion) initiative to re-house
inhabitants and get the coal fires under control. In
response to the plan, India’s Ministry of Coal has also
released Rs 600 million (US$15 million) for a pilot project
to build housing for the residents of Bokapahari, one of
the worst affected areas.

These plans are good in principle but they don’t address
the complexity of the problem. In fact, in Bokapahari there
is widespread and strong resistance to the forthcoming
displacement. According to the residents, huge families of
eight to ten people are being given one-room structures.
Belagaria (where the new housing is being built) is far
away from the city, and has hardly any employment
opportunities. Given the gloomy choice of living in fire
zones or losing their livelihood, most people have no
choice but to try to stay put.

Ashok Agarwal, president of Jharia Bachao Sangharsh
Samiti – a local resistance body currently fighting BCCL’s
plans in the Supreme Court – sums up the no-win
situation as follows:

“The company started opencast and slaughter mining
because it is cheaper and can be easily done. Once the
fire spread, almost nothing was done to extinguish it.
Sand stowing44 is avoided because it is expensive. Fire
zones are left open. Now they want to remove all the
people and extract more coal. However, their
compensation is useless compared to the damage done.
What will people do where there are no jobs?”45

As Jharia burns, people continue to put up with the
horrendous conditions, the disease, pollution and threat of
displacement. Why? Because they have no other choice.

The Russian coal industry employs 200,000
people, producing 309 million tonnes of
coal in 2006.49 Mining is perhaps the most
dangerous profession in the country. But
official statistics on mining accidents and
health impacts are not easy to come by.

Vorkuta miners protesting
against wage arrears managed to
close down the biggest mine in
Russia, Vorgashorskaya, for a
period of two months.

This miner suffered grave burns
when a methane explosion
ripped through the Vorkutinskaya
coal mine in northern Russia.
Five miners died in this blast
and 12 others were badly injured.

The workers want their wage
arrears for many months to be
paid in full. Nowadays they have
no money to buy essentials like
food and medicine. Their families
live in horrible ramshackle
houses, the 50-year-old former
barracks used to house
prisoners' escort servicemen.

31

Russian coal mines are hazardous and chronically
underfunded. As a result, accidents are frequent and the
human cost is shockingly large. In 2003, a mine blast in
Kemerovoin in southern Siberia killed 13 people. The
following April, 45 more miners were killed in an explosion
in the same region. One year later, in 2005, a methane
explosion claimed the lives of another 21.50 Two years
later, Russia suffered its worst mining disaster in more
than 60 years when 110 coal miners perished in a blast at
the Ulyanovskaya mine. This tragic accident was shortly
followed by another in which 38 more miners died.51

A national report commissioned in 2006 found that the
Komi Republic (one of the leaders in coal production) had
an overall occupational disease rate of 8.3 per 10,000
employees – five times the national average. These figures
make the coal industry the most dangerous profession in
Russia, with 26.05 work-related diseases for every 10,000
employees.52 While these numbers are big enough to
raise alarm, they do not reflect the whole picture of coal
mining in Russia, where thousands of workers suffer from
chronic and severe illnesses (see Health Risk, page 33)

Vorkuta – a town ruled by coal

Located 160 km inside the Arctic Circle, Vorkuta is a
mining city with a population of more than 100,000. It was
originally built in the early 20th century, and has grown with
the success of its coal industry. However, recent mine
closures - and the health problems that result from a
career in the mines - mean that few in the town have
been left untouched by mining’s negative effects.

Pay and employment problems

During the 1990s and the early part of the 21st century,
several mines started to close because high operation
costs plagued the mine operators. The result was that
1% of Vorkuta’s coal mine workers lost their jobs in 1993,
followed by a further 9% the following year.53

At the same time, the workers who remained employed
found themselves in an unenviable position. Pressures on
mine owners’ budgets meant that, at several times during
the late 1980s and 1990s, many workers simply weren’t
paid – sometimes for up to a year. This led to several
outbursts of union activity. In one case, things got so bad
that the workers resorted to locking mining company
directors and local officials in their buildings in order to
get the money they were owed.54

32

Health issues

Today, five mines in Vorkuta employ about eight thousand
people. Out of 114 cases of occupational disease
reported in the town in 2007, 101 were in the coal
mines.55 The most common illnesses are the chronic
diseases associated with using industrial equipment,
physical overwork, strained organs and systems. In
2008, there were also around 30 cases of chronic
bronchitis, 10 cases of cochlear neuritis, five cases of
dust disease, two cases of pneumatic hammer disease,
and two cases of lung cancer.56

The impact of Russian
mining first hand

One miner who has suffered greatly for his work is
Ainiyatulla Tukhfatullin. He was born in 1949 in a village in
Tatarstan, a province in the Volga basin. In 1971, after
service in the army, he came to Vorkuta and was employed
in the Zapolyarnaya mine. For 34 years, he worked with
primitive tools in mines between 250 to 750 metres
underground – breeding grounds for disease and illness.

Injuries

Injuries were part of his life: “At the beginning of the
1970s, we didn’t even have rock-drills. We mined coal
with saws, axes, shovels. There were also electric drills:
they said they weighed 32 kg. I have fractures head-to-
toe. If I start telling you my medical history, your notebook
won’t be long enough to write it all down.”57

He spoke about one incident in 1987 when he was hit by
a falling rock. It left him hospitalised and in agony for two
months with a fractured clavicle. In 2004, Ainiyatulla was
diagnosed with pneumatic hammer disease: “You see, my
hands are shaking – that’s pneumatic hammer disease,”
he explains.58

In 2005, Ainiyatulla was injured in an underground
accident. He fell, causing a knee ligament to rupture on
his left leg. He needed a serious and painful operation –
with a seven-month stay in a hospital bed.

It ended his career and he now gets invalidity benefit. It
comes to about 7,500 roubles a month, plus
compensation of about 10,000 roubles. That’s only about
US$ 700 dollars a month, hardly enough to live on.

A lack of care

Today, Ainiyatulla spends lots of his life at the centre for
occupational pathology, making the journey there for
treatment courses five times per year. Each course lasts
about three weeks. He tells us: “Sometimes I also have to
go by taxi. But it is very expensive, 300 roubles one way.”59

To make matters worse, a lack of public funding has
forced the centre for pathology to cut back on services so
people like Ainiyatulla can no longer stay there overnight.
The source of the funding problem is Vorkuta’s chronic
deficit, which is caused in part by the fact that tax
revenues from the Vorkutaugol coal company are sent to
Moscow, not Vorkuta. Things are so bad in the city that
there’s even talk of closing the centre altogether.

“As soon as we heard about that in April, we just couldn’t
believe our ears. This is a mining city, and there will be no
place where the miners’ diseases are treated,” he added.
“Write about that. Maybe then we'll get help to restore the
day and night clinic." 60

Health Risk

Removing coal from the ground can be arduous, dirty
and dangerous. Accidental explosions and sudden
mine collapses are only a few of the many perils
facing the world’s coal miners. This high risk
profession also comes with long working hours under
strenuous conditions. It carries with it many health
hazards from exposure to noxious fumes, toxic
metals and dust particles.

Black lung disease, also known as pneumoconiosis
or CWP, is perhaps the most infamous health
problem impact resulting from a career in the coal
mines. It has been associated with coal mining for
centuries. CWP is caused by repeated exposure to
dust containing crystalline silica, which settles in the
lungs causing them to harden. This in turn reduces
the efficiency with which inhaled oxygen is
transferred to the bloodstream. The severity of the
disease varies, but it is chronic, progressive and
often fatal. Although some symptoms can be
alleviated, there is no known cure. Individuals with
CWP suffer from shortness of breath, tiredness,
emphysema and coughs, heart problems and
ultimately respiratory failure.61

Black lung takes a much heavier toll on miners in
developing countries. In China, about 600,000 coal
miners suffer from the disease – a number that is
going up by about 70,000 each year.62 In the US, the
prevalence of the disease has fallen since federal
mining legislation was passed but 1,200 people still
die from it every year. 63

In 2006, the bustling industrial town of Cilacap was
filled with optimism. President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono had announced the opening of a new coal-
fired power plant in the area. But despite the initial
hope for local economic growth, the real cost to the
Southeast Java town soon became shockingly clear.

Jono is a 50-year-old fisherman
who catches fish in the waters
around the coal plant. Since the
plant started operating, he has
seen his fishing catch decrease
by 50%.

The Cilacap power station is
located in a coastal community
situated in central java. Here
almost 80% of the local
community make a living from
fishing. However, the power
station has severely affected the
waters from which these people
fish and many have seen their
livelihoods lost.

jasmine he planted in front of his house. Trees around the
area have layers of black dust on their leaves. Dozens of
people have been driven away by the coal dust and
constant humming coming from the plant.

“We pay double our water bill to clean our houses. Dust
keeps us sweeping the floors many times a day,” Sarjono
tells us. “Many of my neighbours have moved away. Who
can stand living like this?”66

Job losses

The pollution from the plant has had a devastating effect
on the ability of many to make a living from the land.
About 12 hectares of productive rice fields in two villages
were effectively ruined after the plant flooded them with a
mixture of hot salt water and effluent from the plant.

This incident forced one farmer, Noto, and his son off their
land. Now, to earn money, they dig sand and transport it
back to his village in a small boat. With a 10-hour day
starting at 6 a.m. it’s backbreaking work just to fill a small
truck. Noto’s tiny earnings are never more than about
80,000 rupiah a day, about US$8.67

Along with many of his neighbours, losing his rice field
meant Noto had no choice. In fact, Noto and his son are
among the lucky ones – many of his neighbours have no
work at all.

The original aim of building the power plant was to
encourage local economic growth. In turn, this would help
expand Cilacap’s industrial area to around 2,000 hectares
– more than ten times its former size.64 At the beginning
of the project, the government watched proudly. The plant
was delivering 600 megawatts of electricity to the Java-
Bali electricity grid. Many new jobs had been created,
causing a booming trade in building materials. Other
locals earned money by renting their houses to
construction engineers.

Soon the reality hit home – and it all started with a black
cloud of dust that covered the local town.

Health

Alia is four and lives with her parents and two older
siblings. An abandoned rice field is the only thing
separating their home from the coal-fired power plant,
300 metres away. In the early days of the power plant
being opened, Alia played happily with her friends outside
her house. The only small sign of danger was the
persistent coughing that all the children began to pick up.

It was an early sign of something far more serious: seven
months ago, Alia was diagnosed with bronchitis. Her father
has been affected, too. He worked at the plant for over a
year, unloading the coal trucks without a breathing mask,
inhaling the soot and fumes. Now he has lung spots.

Another local girl who suffers is three-year-old Safira.
She’s small for her age and has had coughs and colds at
least twice a month since she was born. Her mother,
Rohimah, can’t afford to take her to the doctor. The only
medication Safira gets is over-the-counter fever tablets
and cough syrup.

Purwanto, a local doctor, told us:

“A lack of nutrition caused many of the mothers in the
area to be unable to nurse their children, reducing their
babies’ resistance to infections. I have seen a shift to
more cases of respiratory infections in children than adults
in the area since the plant started operating.” 65

Purwanto is all too familiar with the suffering of children
caused by the power station. He was forced to leave his
own home in a nearby complex after two of his children
developed bronchitis.

A local uprising

The illnesses, pollution and deterioration in quality of life
have taken their toll on the locals living near the power
station. One day at dawn, in late 2005, the neighbourhood
was woken by a loud noise from the plant. Residents said
it sounded like a plane taking off nearby.

“The noise kept coming on and off every five minutes. We
couldn’t even hear ourselves talking. Later we found out it
was the plant cleaning their pipes,” said Sugriyatno, who
also lives in the complex.68

The incident drove the people of the housing complex,
and three surrounding villages, to gather together and
protest about the many problems by the plant. They
formed a committee so they could take their complaints
to the local government and the power plant.

Sugriyatno, who led the effort, said:

“We are negotiating compensation for the damage in the
three villages and Griya Kencana Permai complex caused
by the plant’s operation. There has been a lot of damage
already. However, we are still hopeful that a positive
solution will come out of this.” 69

He also pointed out that the power plant’s owners had
never showed sympathy or offered support to the
neighbourhood they destroyed. The locals won’t back
down; but neither, it seems, will the polluters.

Burning up Borneo –
deforestation and coal

The deforestation caused by coal mining is readily
apparent in Indonesia, the world’s second largest
coal exporter. Coal extracted from Indonesian mines
is shipped all over the planet to countries such as
Japan and Italy. Kalimantan is the centre of
Indonesia’s coal mining sector, with an estimated
21 billion tonnes of coal reserves. Of the 76 million
tonnes of coal produced by Indonesia in 2000,
85% came from Kalimantan.70

In East Kalimantan, mining companies have been
land grabbing and securing deals for coal
concessions, and now millions of hectares overlap
with areas of remaining rainforests. Deforestation
maps for the period 2000-2007 show recent
clearance inside active mining concessions, indicating
that strip mining activities are expanding.71

One forecast by the Japanese Institute of Energy
Economics estimates that Kalimantan’s production
could triple by 2020. If this expansion happens, the
coal industry will become one of the leading causes
of deforestation in Borneo. 72

Shanxi Province, located in the heart of China, is the country’s greatest
coal producer, with about a third of the nation’s coal reserves.73 Every
day, an endless stream of trucks flows out of the region carrying the
'black gold' that keeps Chinese factories, the heart of the economy,
up and running. This reliance on coal is not without its consequences,
however. A journey through Shanxi Province reveals the trail of
destruction that coal has left in its wake.

Plant life along coal transport
roads is choked with dust. It is
estimated that 60 million tons of
coal dust are lost from trucks
and deposited along roadsides
each year.

A bleak future – Xiaoyi‘s
dependency on coal has
resulted in huge problems: a
homogenous industry structure,
declining employment, severe
pollution, and endless disputes
caused by careless and
unbridled economic growth.

The coal mine, coking factory
and power plant in Hanjiashan
village have had a major impact
on the surrounding environment
and village life. Over the years,
the water-intensive operations
dried up the local river and wells;
that and heavy pollution have
lowered crop yields significantly.

Datong – “The Coal Capital”

History on the brink of destruction

Xiaoyi – a city of “grey mountains,
black water and yellow smoke”.

Wasted Water

Xiaoyi is ranked as one of the top ten coal producing
areas in Shanxi Province.77 But coal mining, processing
and combustion have taken their toll on the health and
well-being of residents and the surrounding environment.
Driving into the city, smokestacks from a coal-fired power
plant are readily visible. They rise high into the air,
belching out clouds of pollution. The area alongside the
road bears the scars of this power plant: the water in a
nearby creek runs yellow-black; piles of coal sludge litter
the adjacent landscape, which is used by local
sheepherders for grazing.

One local herder expresses his outrage and sense of
helplessness:

“Because of this power plant, the water is like this every
day, too dirty, all black. I can’t say what kind of pollution
there is, but if you put this water into the ground, there’s
no crop. Once the water touches the crops they die. Our
loss is huge. I try not to let the sheep drink this water,
since it’s polluted water by the plant. If they drink it they’ll
get sick. I use the groundwater in the village myself, and
the sheep do, too.”78

Although the village’s well-water has not been affected by
pollution, the village now suffers from water shortages.
“It’s all the fault of the power plant, it pumps out the
water. We used to have plenty of water beneath our
village, now it’s no good, there’s too little water.”79 When
asked about the coal sludge piling up by the roadside,
the man says that it is from coal ash tossed out by the
power plant. “It’s all black and everywhere... The ash and
gas floating around chokes me so bad I can hardly go on
living…”80 The man mops his forehead with a towel on
his shoulder, so angry and agitated he cannot go on. The
sheep at his side begin bleating, seemingly echoing the
anger of their master.

Datong, in northern Shanxi Province, is a city that both
beneﬁts, and suffers from, coal. Massive, high-quality coal
deposits have brought economic prosperity to the area
but at the same time are leading to its decline. Large-
scale, intense exploitation means that the once-abundant
coal reserves are now on the verge of exhaustion;
subsequently, unemployment is rising. Coal also threatens
the survival of the area’s cultural heritage. Air pollution
from coal combustion is causing damage to a nearby
ancient landmark and UNESCO world heritage site, the
Yungang Grottoes (see Particularly Polluting, page 43) 74

The Yungang Grottoes are an archaeological site dating
back more than 1,500 years. The Buddhist stone carvings
and cave art preserved here are priceless. Up until 1998,
not more than 350 metres in front of the Yungang
Grottoes, lay State Highway 109, a necessary route for all
coal shipments. Countless numbers of coal trucks would
pass by — as many as 16,000 trucks per day.75 Dust
stirred up by these trucks would settle and gradually
accumulate on the surface of the stone carvings and form
an acidic coat of dust. This caused severe damage to the
Yungang Grottoes, as the connective material in the
Grottoes’ sandstone blocks is mostly calcium, which
corrodes easily in an acidic environment. Now, the surface
of many stone carvings or sculptures simply crumbles
away at the lightest touch.

Struggling to protect the Grottoes is Dr Huang Jizhong,
secretary of the Yungang Grottoes Research Institute,
who has worked at the site for more than twenty years.
He is deeply grieved that such a precious and treasured
work of art is being sacrificed to the city’s industrial
pollution. A thick layer of ash covers many of the stone
carvings and people often ask why the Institute does not
conduct a restoration. To this Dr Huang replies, “Due to
extremely severe weathering on the surface, while some
of the ash that we see is coal ash, another portion of it is
a product of weathering on the sandstone. Even if we
used the gentlest cleaning methods, it would have an
effect on the Grottoes. All we can do now is try to think of
ways to strengthen and lengthen the life of these cultural
relics without affecting them negatively.”76

Linfen – no longer the
“City of Flowers and Fruit”

Agriculture on the decline

Linfen, located in the southwest region of Shanxi
Province, is better known today for its excessive air
pollution than anything else. According to China’s State
Environmental Protection Agency, Linfen has the worst air
pollution in the country.81 Abundant coal resources, which
once held a clear advantage for the city economically, led
to the development of large and small coking and iron
smelting factories in the 1980s. Now, a forest of
smokestacks surrounds the city, and the pollution
generated by them has severely affected local farmers.

Mr Shi, Mrs Chang and their four-year-old grandson, Shi
Gaoxiong, live in a small mountainside courtyard just a
wall’s width away from one of the city’s coking plants. Life
here isn’t easy.

“Day and night the coking plant makes a racket, but
nothing can be done. When you go out the door,
everything is covered in dust… and the crops and fruit
don’t grow as well as before. We used to be able to
gather about 1,000 jin (500 kg) of corn, and now we only
get 700 or 800; potatoes used to get about 500 jin (250
kg), and now it’s only 150 or 200. The smoke is so bad
that everybody in the village gets dizzy, an itchy throat
and cough. When we wake up early in the morning, the
wall and road are all covered in black. If you come out
and take a little walk around your whole body gets
covered in black.” 82

With little other choice, they are forced to try and eke out
a living on polluted land. These villagers and millions of
others like them live in the shadow of coal.

As this brief glimpse of Shanxi Province shows, the true
cost of coal in China is borne heavily by the local people
and the environment. Industries have profited from coal
and reaped economic benefits, but those hardest hit are
left to bear the darker side of coal-driven progress.

Story by: Iris Cheng and Meng Wei

image China's coal resources are
extensive. The country derives
70% of its energy from it.

Particularly Polluting

In the US, air pollution is believed to cut short the
lives of 30,000 people every year.83 In India, a study
in 2001 found that people in 14 of the country’s 20
largest cities breathe air that the government deems
‘dangerous’. In China, pulmonary (lung) disease is
the second largest cause of adult deaths – 13.9% of
the total.84

Unsurprisingly, one of the main reasons for this is coal
– or rather the fine particles that come from burning
it. Particulate pollution, also called particulate matter
or soot, is one of the many nasty by-products of coal
combustion. It can be released either directly from
smokestacks or formed indirectly through the
reactions of pollutants like sulphur dioxide with air.
Particles have a diameter that is 40 times smaller
than a human hair and they contain sulphates,
nitrates, ammonium, sodium chloride, carbon and
mineral dust.85 Particulate matter is especially
dangerous because the smallest of particles can be
inhaled deep inside the lungs and have the potential
to cross directly into the bloodstream. It affects
human health through increased rates of heart
attacks and strokes, lung and cardiovascular disease
and even premature death.86

Particulate matter exacts a toll on the environment as
well. Aside from contributing to haze and visibility
issues, the acidity of these particles can leach
precious nutrients from soils, contaminate water and
damage forests and crops.

Secluded in the mountains of northern Thailand lies
Southeast Asia’s largest lignite coal-fired power plant,
which is fed by the country’s largest opencast mine next
door. The plant has 13 generating units, a capacity of
2,625 MW, and a track record of pollution and death
stretching back to the day it was first switched on.

Victims of power plant pollution

people continue to suffer from
major respiratory complications,
and most villagers continue to
be unable to afford medical
treatment.

concentrations up to 14 times higher than those typically
found in uncontaminated soil.93 In 2003, the State Natural
Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning Office
found critically high levels of toxic heavy metals in almost
all water sources around the plant and coal mine.94

Mae Moh first hand

You only need to go to nearby villages and hospitals to
see the damage Mae Moh is causing. In one village, 70-
year-old Khun Siributr Wongchana has sold most of his
belongings and even part of his house to pay for the cost
of treating his acute respiratory problems. Every few hours
he sucks on plastic inhalers to try and soothe the
asthmatic irritation that burns his lungs. Opening a photo
album, he flicks through pages of images showing fellow
villagers and friends who are either sick or have already
passed away.

In the local hospital of Mae Moh, two more elderly
villagers lie hooked up to oxygen tanks. The hospital’s
director, Khun Prasert Kijsuwanaratana, just smiles when
asked to comment on the link between health issues and
the nearby power plant. “You may take pictures in the
wards if you like,” she said, “but I am not authorised to
talk about this issue.”95

Estimates suggest that some 300 villagers have lost their
lives as a direct result of pollution from the plant, and
thousands more suffer from respiratory problems. A
scientific study published in 2000 concluded that, even
with sulphur control equipment installed, people living
near Mae Moh are three times more likely to suffer from
chronic coughing.96 To date, over 30,000 people have
also been displaced from their homes. Those that
continue to live in the area face the effect of acid rain on
their farmland.

A lethal start

On 3 October 1992, the Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand (EGAT) switched on the first 11 units at Mae
Moh without any sulphur dioxide control equipment.87
Immediately, SO2 generated by the plant started to float
above Mae Moh, mixing with air and water to create a
highly toxic acid rain. The rainwater contained sulphate
concentration levels 50% higher than acceptable
international standards (see Hazy Horizons, page 47) 88

Within days, more than a thousand people from 40
different villages within seven kilometres of the plant fell ill.
Exposure to the sulphur dioxide gas caused breathing
difficulties, nausea, dizziness and inflammation of eyes
and nasal cavities.89 Within two months, more than 50%
of the rice fields near the plant were also damaged by
acid rain. Domestic livestock started dying. At least
42,000 local people were found to be suffering from
breathing problems.

After this disastrous start, the plant installed some
desulphurisation devices. However, Egat continued to
operate the plant while some of the devices were out of
service or shut down for maintenance. As a result, pollution
problems recurred in 1996, resulting in the death of six
villagers in the Mae Moh valley from blood poisoning.90

Disaster struck again in 1998, when severe SO2 pollution
was trapped in the valley. The toxic clouds destroyed
plants and crop yields overnight, leaving hundreds
sick.91 Out of the more than 8,200 patients visiting
inspection clinics organised by EGAT in the first six
months of that year, almost 3,500 were suffering from
respiratory illnesses.

Any improvements?

The owners of the power plant claim to have cleaned up
their act. When questioned on the issue, company
engineer Khun Ponlit Sesth-Kamnerd pointed at blinking
red LED indicators on the map in front of him saying,
“They are all showing zero. You can see that there is no
longer any problem with air pollution.”92

However, that’s simply not true. For a start, the plant still
spews out seven tons of SO2 every hour. A study
conducted by Greenpeace Research Laboratories in
2002 also showed that the Mae Moh power plant
produces 4 million tonnes of fly ash and 39 tonnes of
mercury every year. Fly ash samples taken from the

Southeast Asia’s largest lignite-fired
power station. Environmental activists in
Thailand see the plant as an example of
a dirty energy technology that should be
phased out and replaced with clean,
renewable resources.

The outlook

Over the years, communities around the Mae Moh power
plant have filed several lawsuits against EGAT, seeking
compensation for mental and physical health
deterioration, medical expenses, and damage to crops
and land.

In May 2004, the Thai Provincial court awarded 5.7 million
Baht (US$142,500) to the villagers for crop damage
caused by the sulphur emissions from the power plant.
This was a pretty small victory considering the scores of
people affected, many of whom just couldn't afford
medical treatment.

The villagers won a more substantial victory in 2006,
when the energy minister promised the area 300 million
Baht (US$ 87,100) per year to cover treatment for their
health problems caused by the plant.97 Two years on,
however, the villagers haven’t seen any of it. Only time will
tell whether the government lives up to its promise.

After decades of struggles, countless protests and much
suffering, Mae Moh's Patients’ Right Network did secure
a small victory in the form of a land grant consisting of
approximately 200 rais (34 hectares) and local government
funding to relocate those affected by the power station.
They now plan to create an eco-community beyond the
5 km radius of the power station, which is considered a
dead zone, where villagers can rebuild their lives.

The hope is that moving out from under the shadow of
Mae Moh will allow villagers to regain their strength and
spirit, and help keep the struggle against the power
plant going.98

Hazy Horizons

Coal-fired power plants are major sources of sulphur
dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which cause acid rain
and ground-level ozone (smog). Acid rain occurs
when these gases react in the atmosphere with
water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form sulphuric
acid and nitric acid.

Smog forms when nitrogen oxides react with the
chemicals in the air or sunlight. Similarly to soot,
smog causes serious damage to the environment –
it can destroy whole ecosystems by harming plants
and trees, making them vulnerable to disease and
extreme weather. Further, it can cause a wide range
of symptoms in humans, such as increased risk of
asthma, lung damage and premature deaths.99

The environmental impact of acid rain has been well
documented – largely because of the shocking visible
damage it has done to so many forests around the
world, particularly in Scandinavia.

Pollution control devices, such as flue gas scrubbers,
have been developed to reduce these pollutants from
coming out of the smokestacks. However, the fact
remains that coal is still by far the single biggest
source of sulphur emissions caused by power
generation. In 2004, 95% of the 10.3 million tons of
SO2, and 90% of 3.9 million tons of NOx, released by
US power plants came from coal.100 The cost of the
harm caused by acid rain, smog and the other effects
of these gases is huge, and makes a big contribution
to the true cost of coal.

Disused coal mines – gone, but not forgotten

Veteran environmental activist,
Matthews Hlabane, explains how
the acid mine drainage (AMD)
water flows into this pool. The
children from the local
community of Maguqa, located
about 2 kilometre away, like to
swim in the pool as the water is
nice and warm. But the warm
pools hide a sinister reality. The
water is heated by coal fires in
abandoned mines – many of
which have been burning since
the 1940s.

Water draining from the mines
is filled with sulphate salts,
heavy metals and carcinogenic
substances like benzene and
toluene. The salt in AMD
precipitates out, covering
impacted areas with a thick,
white crust as shown here.

AMD seeps down hill into the
Brugspruit stream. The polluted
Brugspruit then joins the Olifants
River and eventually flows into
the Loskop Dam, where large-
scale dying off of fish, crocodiles
and turtles has been attributed to
the contaminated water from
coal mines.

the environment, mainly due to AMD – water draining from
the mines filled with sulphate salts, heavy metals and
carcinogenic substances like benzene and toluene. This
AMD damages wildlife and spreads illness and disease.
According to the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry,
coupled with failing sewage works, AMD also poses the
biggest threat to the quality of South Africa’s limited water
resources (see Coal’s Aftermath, page 53) 102

The effects of disused mines,
first hand

One place that feels these effects most shockingly is
Emalahleni.103 The name means ‘place of coal’, hardly
surprising considering that it is surrounded by 22 collieries
– plus steel, vanadium and manganese plants.

One of the biggest abandoned mines in the area is the
Transvaal and Delagoa Bay (T&DB) mine. It was opened
in 1896. When it closed in 1953, it was left ownerless and
abandoned – and free to pollute.

Health problems

Among the most vulnerable in Emalahleni are the children
of Nyerere Street, in Maguqa. Their soccer field lies in a
small floodplain on the side of a small stream. The stream
is dirty and dangerous, filled with untreated sewage from
the municipality.104

Last summer, a surge in the water level deposited white
salts over their soccer field105 – all from AMD from the
surrounding mines. They were forced to move their field
when the salts started stinging their eyes.

When not playing soccer (among other things), the
children of Maguqa swim in the warm water two kilometres
upstream. The warm pools hide a sinister reality – the
water is heated by coal fires still burning in the abandoned
mines, many of which have been burning since the 1940s.

Shockingly, the pool is easily accessible and there are no
warning signs. This is despite the fact that the water is so
poisonous, it can’t be used for irrigation, let alone for
swimming and bathing.106

Damaged water supplies

In 2006 and 2007, there were three separate incidents
around the Loskop Dam, about 60 kilometres downstream
from Emalahleni. AMD leaked into the water supply, killing
thousands of fish, crocodiles and freshwater turtles. As it
travelled down the river, it also damaged farms and
poisoned the water used by communities along the way.

Dr Jan Myburgh, veterinarian and academic at the
University of Pretoria, called the situation “an ecological
catastrophe”. 107 Worse, is that the nature of AMD means
the damage to the water supply is set to continue in the
long term, because once the mine has breached the
water table, underground rocks are exposed to oxygen
and rainwater. This exposure sets off chemical reactions
that release the toxic substances in AMD.

Moving further up the river, there are hundreds of AMD
dams over a stretch of more than 10 kilometres. The water
is stained red and gold by dissolved iron. Everywhere the
landscape dips, you’ll find AMD leakage. It scorches the
soil and kills off all the vegetation it touches. One look at
the Brugspruit River, and you’d be forgiven for thinking it
had been snowed over – but it’s actually salt from the
white salt residue.

“This place is hell on Earth”, says veteran environmental
campaigner Matthews Hlabane. “The soil is burning and
full of salt, the water is contaminated, the air is dangerous.
And we don’t see it being fixed.”108

Action was taken about ten years ago, when activists
from the local community were making a lot of noise.
Even so, Matthews points out a worrying truth: “As soon
as we stop making a noise, the interest dies down.”

It seems like an impossible challenge to resolve. In
Emalahleni itself, the sewerage system is already
inadequate and unfit for the job – not to mention that it
pollutes the river. The treatment plant at Brugspruit, just
upstream, is ten years old, but for more than a year it has
been out of action. It’s due for major refurbishment,109 but
also suffers from other problems: electric cable theft, severe
staff shortages, industrial effluent and and untreated
sewage releases.

Air pollution

Emalahleni is in the Mpumalanga province – and the air
pollution from coal fires in the disused mines is having an
impact on the entire region. Nobody has calculated the
costs yet, but as health suffers the reality is beginning to
hit home. Officials in the Mpumalanga province have
talked about “a definite trend towards increased lower
respiratory tract infections in children under five years of
age in Mpumalanga in the winter months”.110

In November 2007, the national government declared an
area of Mpumalanga – over 301,106 square kilometres –
as a national pollution priority area.111 Having measured
the ambient air pollution, it is thought to be worse than
that in the former East Germany.112

The outlook

South Africa is betting on unproven clean coal
technologies and expensive nuclear power plants to deal
with climate change challenges, while at the same time
planning to double its electricity production by 2050 in the
face of an electricity supply crisis that sees regular
blackouts. Coal-fired electricity generation and coal
mining are expanding, while dealing with the pollution
from abandoned mines is a low priority.

The Geosciences Council, an advisory body to the
Department of Minerals and Energy (DME), is putting
together a list of 6,000 ownerless mines that need urgent
action.113 The T&DB mine tops the list, with an estimated
clean-up cost of around R100 million (US$ 10.7 million).
This represents a small part of the much larger total clean-
up cost for all mines of R30-100 billion.

Clearly, the financial cost is huge. While some mine
owners – like Anglo Coal and BHP Billiton- are now
treating their own AMD at a cost of R300 million (US$32.5
million),114 these are isolated cases. The majority of the
cost for the clean-ups will be borne by the public, either
as ongoing environmental damage, or as treatment from
the public purse.

Story by: Victor Munnik

image The eMalahleni Local Municipal
Council sewage system is a mess. The
Klarinet 2 & 3 pump station was flooded by
over two metres of raw sewage which it
spilled into the nearby river. Dysfunctional
municipal sewage works add to the
pollution threats from AMD.

Coal’s Aftermath

The legacy issues associated with coal include a
great deal of water pollution. AMD is just one of them.
It can cover rivers, estuaries and sea beds in an
orange blanket of iron hydroxide, killing all plant and
animal life in its path. Water that has come into
contact with AMD is undrinkable for humans, and too
toxic for use in irrigation and agriculture.115

It is difficult to make an accurate estimate of the scale
of the pollution caused by AMD. However, by 1989 it
was estimated that about 19,300 kilometres of
streams and rivers (nearly three times the length of
the Nile) and about 72,000 hectares of lakes and
reservoirs across the world had been seriously
damaged.116 As sources of AMD remain toxic for
hundreds of years, these numbers will only have gone
up since then.

Coal combustion wastes (CCW) are another part of
coal’s legacy that often degrades water resources.
Left over after coal is burned, they contain toxic
substances like arsenic, cadmium, chromium and
lead, which can destroy ecosystems completely.
Typically, the solid portion of CCW is disposed of in
landfill, while the liquid fraction is pumped into natural
depressions or diked basins (referred to as
impoundments).117 Old mines are also used to store
CCW, alongside waste from the mine itself. Left
unregulated, as these dumping grounds often are,
there is a high risk of leakages and contamination of
local groundwater, leading to contamination of
drinking water, arable land and livestock.

Bełchatów power plant in the Łódź Region is
the largest in Poland, supplying almost 20% of
the nation’s energy. It’s also the largest brown-
coal power plant in Europe.118 Each year its
chimneys belch more than 31 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.119

In Eastern Europe, Poland is the
largest producer and consumer
of coal; in fact, it is the second
largest coal producer and
consumer in all of Europe,
outranked only by Germany.

Plans to expand mining in Poland
are underway. One of the big
worries is how this expansion
may affect local water bodies,
such Lake Gopło. The fragile
ecosystem around this lake is
home to a bird sanctuary of
Europe-wide significance.

The Bełchatów lignite open pit
mine is the biggest man-made
hole in Europe. Poland
generates more than 90% of its
electricity from coal. The wind
park in the background shows
that there is the potential for
Poland to better harness the
power of clean energy.

55

A large portion of the coal that supplies Bełchatów comes
from the nearby opencast mine. The changes in the
landscape already caused by this mine are plain to see.
Located just a dozen kilometres from Bełchatów town,
the mining area covers 2,500 hectares – the same as
3,300 football pitches. The mine itself is promoted as
Europe’s biggest opencast coal mine.120 The burnt-out
landscape surrounding it is littered with heaps of coal
waste, trucks and excavators. Deep in the mine, conveyor
belts slither along, laden with earth and rock. On the
observation deck built around the hole, people fall silent;
the view has a sobering effect.

More damage to come

Plans to expand mining in Poland are underway in several
other areas – some of which are dangerously near
Poland’s famous Lake Gopło, the cradle of the state. One
of the big worries is the effect mining will have on the
water levels in these lakes, along with the fragile
ecosystems and the valuable tourism trade that relies on
them. (see Disappearing Act, page 57)

Przyjezierze

Przyjezierze is a village that has already witnessed these
damaging effects first hand. The village is located along
Lake Ostrowskie in the Kuyavia-Pomerania region, and is
heavily dependent on tourism. Or rather, it was dependent
on tourism. Over the last few years, ponds have
disappeared, wells have dried up, trees have died, and
the water level of the lake has gone down by almost two
metres.121 As the lake begins to dry up, so does the flow
of tourists.

Most people blame the local coal mine for the falling water
levels. The coal mine denies any responsibility, instead
arguing that the dramatic developments are merely the
result of drought and lack of rain. This argument doesn’t
stand up. As the bitter inhabitants of the area have
pointed out, lakes that aren’t near coal mines haven’t
dried up as drastically as those that are.122

Kleczew

A similar situation has unfolded near Kleczew, a few
kilometres from Przyjezierze. Here, the Jóźwin II B mine
began operating ten years ago and is still running at full
steam today.

In the intervening decade, the mine has created a dark
grey desert landscape that stretches as far as the horizon.
Experts at Poznań’s University of Agriculture have found
that, “water drainage around the brown coal mining areas
in the Kleczew region has led to the formation of expansive
craters of depression. As mining has expanded northward
since the late 1980s, the water levels of lakes across the
Powidzki Landscape Park have begun to fall.”123

Kruszwica

Another location set to suffer is Lake Gopło. Situated
near the town of Kruszwica, it is home to Gopło
Millennium Park (Nadgoplański Park Tysiąclecia). This
park is protected by the EU Natura 2000 programme
and contains a bird sanctuary of Europe-wide
significance. It was also along the banks of Lake Gopło
that the history of the Polish tribe first started. Now this
valuable and delicate area is under threat.

This threat comes from excavation rights for the
Tomisławice opencast mine (less than 10 kilometres away
from Kruszwica), which were signed on 2 February 2008.
The mine is due to open in 2009.

Two months after this announcement, local residents
organised a protest against the plans – one of the first
protests of its type in Poland. About five thousand people
demonstrated along the streets of Kruszwica.124 One of
them was Józef Drzazgowski, of the Przyjezierze
Association for Protecting the Natural Environment. “If
Tomisławice starts mining” he argued, “Lake Gopło´s water
level will shrink over the coming decades similarly to the
developments at Lake Ostrowskie.”125

coal unloaded from bulk carriers.

It should come as no surprise that this claim is not backed
up by the Tomisławice Opencast Environmental Impact
Report, commissioned by the coal mine itself. According
to this report, an advance decision to start depositing coal
mine water in Lake Gopło from 2017 would: “permit
hitherto water levels in the Lake to be maintained”. If this is
not the case, a substantial change in water levels could
have devastating effects. This could occur immediately, if
too much or too little water is fed into the lake. Devastating
effects could also occur years later, when the mine stops
operating and the lake starts to dry up. Lake Gopło is an
important part of the trophic chain of all the surrounding
lakes. Many species of birds would be in danger, including
the little bittern, the bearded reedling and the greylag
goose – the symbol of Gopło Millennium Park. Marshes
and peat bogs would also dry up, causing irreversible
destruction to the richest amphibian reproduction areas in
the Kuyavia region.

Despite this, the mining company refuses to look these
facts in the face. “I can’t understand why Kruszwica has
become so involved. It’s located in an area where future
mining won’t have the slightest impact on it,” Arkadiusz
Michalski, chief environment protection engineer at KWB
Konin has stated. 126

Dr Michał Kupczyk, ornithologist at Poznań’s Adam
Mickiewicz University disagrees. “We’re not talking about
the area immediately next to the mining operations,” he
states. “We’re talking about an impact on regions tens, if
not hundreds of kilometres away.” 127 If he’s right, the
damage in Poland caused by opencast mining has only
just begun.

Disappearing Act

Coal mining has wide-reaching effects on local water
resources. Tremendous volumes of water are required
for mining operations. Often, land areas as well as
rivers are drained to get coal out of the ground and
consequently whole water bodies disappear.

When coal is excavated from deep underground,
groundwater is pumped out to dry up the areas being
mined. Removing vast amounts of water often drains
water from an area beyond the immediate coal-
mining environment. As a consequence, water tables
are lowered, natural ecosystems are damaged, the
growth and reproduction of aquatic plants and
animals is disrupted, valued recreational ﬁsh or bird
species are diminished, and whole regions are
endangered – often across national boundaries.128

Surface mining operations, such as Mountain Top
Removal (MTR), can cause water resources to
disappear in another way – by covering them under
mounds of dirt. MTR operations literally dump
mountains into streams. In what the industry terms as
“valley fills”, rubble generated by blowing up the
mountains is dumped into neighbouring valleys,
burying acres of wildlife habitat and permanently
destroying the ecological functions of the affected
streams. In the US, over 1,200 miles of streams have
already been buried and permanently destroyed in
the central region of Appalachia while local
communities have been drastically affected. By
themselves, these valley fills are expected to bury and
permanently destroy at least 2,400 miles of streams
located in central Appalachia by 2013.129

Largely hidden from most
Americans, MTR is a highly
destructive form of coal mining.
In the US, about a million acres
have been destroyed by MTR in

The central Appalachian Mountain region in the US provides
much of the country’s coal. In the early 1980s, coal companies
operating there started using a form of opencast mining
called mountain top removal. In the process, they have utterly
devastated the land and communities of the Appalachian
coalfields, particularly those of eastern Kentucky. Why?
Because it’s the cheapest way of getting their hands on coal.

Kentucky. There is little evidence
to show that reclamation efforts
undo all of the environmental
harm caused during the mining
process.

County, Kentucky. On occasion,
blasts from the nearby mining
site have sent rocks flying on to
the Urias’s property and engulfed
their home in dust.

“When I was a kid it was
beautiful over here,” Raul
explains. “Now there’s nothing...
Now what you have is 100-foot-
high walls, areas they say are
‘reclaimed’ but they’re not... just
dead brown stuff lying there.
The wildlife’s gone. There’s just
nothing left.”

59

MTR works exactly as it sounds – miners blow up whole
sections of mountains to get to the coal below the surface.
Once that coal is removed, the vast amount of loose rock
and dirt caused by the explosions (called “overburden”) is
dumped into nearby valleys.

This devastating method of mining has already buried
hundreds of miles of streams in Kentucky and decimated
hundreds of thousands of acres of ancient forest. MTR is
wreaking havoc across large swathes of this mountain
region – one of the richest temperate forest ecosystems in
the world. The physical impact of dumping thousands of
tonnes of overburden into mountain valleys is bad
enough. But this waste rock and dirt also contains toxic
metals such as selenium, arsenic, and mercury that leach
into ground and surface water, poisoning everything in
their path – streams, fish, flora, fauna, even people.

The effects of MTR first hand

Thousands of people living in the eastern Kentucky
coalfields have been directly affected by MTR and can
bear witness to the neglect, denial and greed of the
coal companies.

Toxic poisoning

Erica and Raul Urias live in what was once a verdant,
bowl-shaped valley in Pike County. Their home is now
surrounded by the moonscape of mountain top removal
and their property has been pelted with flying rocks and
engulfed by sulphur-rich dust from mining blasts, but
what they worry about most is their four-year-old
daughter, Makayla.

In 2006, they discovered that the water in which they had
been bathing Makayla, and which she sometimes drank
for the first three years of her life, contained 130 times the
concentration of arsenic allowed by the EPA, as well as
higher than normal levels of mercury (see Mercury, page
61). At the moment Makayla is fine, but Erica and Raul are
still worried about the future. “I’ve got fears. I worry about
my daughter,” Raul told us. “I know that prolonged
exposure to arsenic can cause internal organ damage”.130

During his own childhood, Raul knew this valley as
a different place altogether. “When I was a kid it was
beautiful over here,” he explained. “The streams ran clear,
never black. There were minnows and crawdads, a large
amount of frogs. Now there’s nothing... Now what you
have is 100-foot-high walls, areas they say are ‘reclaimed’
but they’re not... just dead brown stuff lying there. The
wildlife’s gone. There’s just nothing left.”131

Sheer ignorance

“We found showy orchids; we found trilliums...
pipsissewa... just all kinds of wonderful little wildflowers in
there.... But, it’s gone, it’s gone. I mean, they completely
denuded the whole entire hollow and made it a valley fill.”132

Decades ago, Mary Jane used to lead nature hikes in
the part of Leslie County in which she and her husband
Raleigh now live. Since 2007, the couple have been
fighting the MTR operation of Whymore Coal. During their
struggle, they’ve witnessed the complete degradation of
this once-pristine ecology.

What makes matters worse is that some of this
destruction is due to needless mistakes on the part of
the coal company. Mary Jane Adams revealed to us that
Whymore Coal recklessly slashed a a 100-foot-wide
swathe right along the mountain, cutting away priceless
forest habitat for the endangered Indiana Indiana brown
bat. Yet, as the Adamses later found out, the company
had slashed the strip in the wrong place. “They didn’t
know where the coal seam was,” Mary Jane told us.133
An important wildlife habitat eliminated for absolutely
nothing.134

Inadequate restoration

“I don’t care how much grassland they put here, [the
animals have] to have the nuts to survive on during the
winter. The turkey, the grouse, the squirrels, the deer,
everything. They’re taking all this big timber out and not
replacing it with anything in the future.”135

In Floyd County, Kentucky, Rick Handshoe has witnessed
the woeful inadequacy of the post-mining reclamation
process.

The main problem, Rick points out, is that coal companies
most commonly reclaim mine sites as pastureland,
planting a mix of seven crops. Not only do these crops
need replanting every now and then, they only grow with

image The extent to which impacted
land can be repaired after mining is open
for debate. Mountain tops cannot be
replaced once blown apart, valleys and
streams buried under millions of tonnes
of earth won’t be restored. Mining so
fundamentally alters natural systems that
what is lost can never truly be regained.

Mercury

The coal industry is the single largest source of
mercury emissions in the world.140 Of the 2,190
tonnes of mercury pumped into the atmosphere each
year, over half comes from the chimneys of coal-fired
power plants.141

Burning coal releases large amounts of mercury
present in raw coal into the air. This mercury
eventually gets into rivers, streams and lakes, either
through rain, dust, or simply by gravity.142 Once in the
water, it finds its way into the food chain – starting in
algae and working its way up through fish, then birds
and mammals. Concentrations of mercury increase
the further up the food chain you go.143

Can mercury harm humans? Yes. It’s a neurotoxin
that can be passed on from mothers to unborn
babies, causing brain damage, blindness, seizures
and many other problems. Exposure comes mainly
from eating contaminated fish.

In the US, 8% of women of childbearing age have
more mercury in their blood than is deemed safe by
the US Environmental Protection Agency.144 This
results in about 410,000 children born each year
having been exposed to dangerous levels of mercury
in the womb.

the help of strong fertiliser. Once the coal company’s
bond money is returned by the state, the fertilising stops,
and everything dies out.136

These inadequate efforts are completely destroying
surface and ground water resources along with the
ecosystem upon which the local wildlife depend. Rick’s
first-hand observations are confirmed by a 2003 report
distributed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
This report stated that “lands reclaimed in this manner will
take much longer than observed in old field succession to
return to pre-mining forest vegetation”.137 Or, as Rick puts
it, “There will never be trees here.” 138

In 2003, the company mining near Rick’s property killed
an entire stream. According to Rick, the water in the creek
ran orange. He describes what happened next:

“There were no fish in the creek. When you kill what you
can’t see with your eyes in the creek, then the
salamanders can’t live there, the crawfish can’t live there,
the fish can’t live there. Then how about the raccoons
that come down and feed on the minnows and the
crawfish? They’re not there for them. You kill that one; you
kill the chain, their food chain.”139

This incident was labelled an accident, although there was
nothing accidental about the mining company illegally
draining an abandoned underground mine without first
building a catchment pond. ‘Accidents’ like this have
been occurring for decades. The environmental
devastation they have caused in Floyd County can be
seen across the region.

The outlook?

As long as MTR mining continues, and as long as
companies continue to put profit before the health of the
land and the people, the outlook for eastern Kentucky
and the central Appalachian coalfields is bleak. As the
price of a ton of coal has skyrocketed, the rush to mine
‘cheap coal’ by MTR is making matters worse, increasing
the likelihood of human sickness, contaminated water,
and degraded ecosystems -costs that are considered
‘external’ by the mining company. These costs are being
paid by the coalfield residents and all those who live
downstream. It’s a price they shouldn’t have to pay.

the flooding of the lake. At 10

Zwenkau will be the biggest lake

“Without the miners, we could not cruise on this lake today”,
explains Captain Thomas Nagel as he slowly navigates his
ship across Lake Zwenkau in East Germany. The water looks
like clear, black tea and smells of sulphide. Its pH level is 2.6 –
the same acidity as vinegar.145 In the southeastern corner of
the lake, the two grey towers of the coal-fired power station
Böhlen-Lippendorf pierce high into the air.146

The opencast mine in Profen
supplies the water for the
flooding of Lake Zwenkau. Since
March 2007, around 10 million
cubic metres of water have been
re-routed into the lake. This
drains other areas besides the
immediate coal-mining
environment; this results in
lowered water tables and
damaged natural ecosystems.

In the southeastern corner of the
lake, the two grey towers of the
coal-fired power station Böhlen-
Lippendorf pierce high into the
air. Böhlen-Lippendorf emits
almost 14 million tonnes of CO2
per year and is the seventh
biggest CO2 emitter in the league
of coal-fired power stations in
Germany.

“Without the miners, we could not
cruise on this lake today”,
explains Captain Thomas Nagel.
So far, the recultivation of Lake
Zwenkau has cost €145.6 million.
While millions of Euros in public
funds are invested in recultivation,
scientists state: “it is still not clear
whether these approaches are
sustainable.”

63

Lake Zwenkau sits on a former opencast mine, 20
minutes’ drive from Leipzig in Saxony. Open from 1921 to
1999, the mine covered 2,863 hectares – the size of more
than 4,000 football pitches.147 Now, thanks to
recultivation, the site is being transformed into a tourist
hotspot, complete with a marina, swimming apartments
and an aerial railway across the lake to the nearby
amusement park, Belantis. At 10 kilometres2, it will be the
biggest lake of its kind in the so-called ‘New Central
German Lake District’.148

Lake Zwenkau is one of many projects set up to
recultivate the scarred surface of former opencast mines
in Germany. However, it also highlights some of the many
challenges that come with recultivating land desecrated
by opencast mining, along with the flaws in the way
governments are currently going about it (see Reclaiming
What’s Lost, page 65).

Recultivation – problems and flaws

Who pays for it?

The recultivation of Lake Zwenkau has so far cost €145.6
million.149 In the Central German and Lusatian region alone,
€8.3 billion have been spent on the restoration of former
opencast mines since 1990.150

The way Germany pays for this recultivation is relatively
unique: in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR),
opencast mining was run by the government. As
a result, recultivation, through the LMBV. 151

Philipp Steuer, from the environmental organisation
Ökolöwe in Leipzig, explains the problem with this:

“Recultivation is associated with tremendous costs. Usually,
the mining companies need to bear the costs, which is the
only acceptable option. But in the East German case, the
costs for recultivation have been taken on by the public
authorities. This is only justifiable with respect to the
governmental organisation of lignite surface mining in the
former GDR… That further costs are currently covered by
the European Union (EU), in the framework of so-called
‘regional aid’, is a non-justifiable cross-subsidisation of
landscape-wrecking surface mining.”152

Of course, the problem doesn’t go away if recultivation is
left to mining companies. The tremendous costs involved
mean the bare minimum is done, with very little chance of
an area ever fully recovering (See US: Eastern Kentucky –
Turning mountain tops into mine waste, page 58).

Acid mine drainage

There are 172 post-coal-mining lakes in East Germany,
and most of them suffer from a similar problem – acid
mine drainage. The consequences are easy to see:
aquatic plants and animals can’t survive, water supplies
can become contaminated, and structures like waste-
water pipes can be hit by acid corrosion.153

Lake Zwenkau is no exception. Only last year, Jörg
Hagelganz of the environmental department at the
regional council of Saxony publicly declared, “Lake
Zwenkau will turn into the most acidic lake in Germany,
if we don’t do anything.”154

Damage to water levels

To dilute the acidification of Lake Zwenkau, the LMBV
currently relies on ‘active flooding’. Since March 2007,
around 10 million cubic meters of water have been re-
routed into the lake155 from the drainage of the opencast
mine in Profen.156 Removing such vast amounts of water
drains other areas besides the immediate coal-mining
environment. The result is lowered water tables and
damage to natural ecosystems.157

Another example is the Lusatian region, where
recultivation projects also rely on active ﬂooding with river
water. Here, the ﬂooding of the Lusatian Lake District
severely affected the surrounding rivers Spree, Neiße and
Schwarze Elster. In 2003, so little water from the Spree
reached Berlin that the discharge of the capital’s
wastewater actually changed the direction of the river.158

As if that wasn’t enough, the Lusatian region now
struggles with another problem with water levels – after
the drainage pumps were switched off in 18 of the
region’s closed-down opencast mines, groundwater levels
rose dramatically.

The effect of this rise? Harvests failed, basements were
flooded and buildings cracked apart. Sewage treatment
plants and cemeteries may be affected in the future.159
“This is a new phenomenon. None of us had water in our
basements before,” stated Siegmar Kugler, deputy district
mayor of Zerre and member of the “Watergroup” Spreetal,
a group that documents the rise of groundwater in the
municipality.160 Despite the fact that 100-year old houses
had never flooded before surface mining started, the
LMBV only accepted responsibility in late 2008.161 Until
then, residents had to install pumps themselves to keep
the water under control.

Skirting the real issue

No-one knows whether landscapes can ever be restored to
resemble their natural state.162 While millions of Euros in public
funds are invested in recultivation, scientists state that “it is still
not clear whether these approaches are sustainable”.163

Of course, one of the biggest issues with recultivation is that,
in one sense, it’s a dangerous diversion – it takes people’s
eyes off the fact that opencast coal mining still happens. No
matter how effective recultivation is, these gigantic projects
do not legitimise opencast mining – the most damaging of
mining techniques.

All the while the public pays for recultivation, the German
government is still subsidising coal. Contrary to all
declarations by the coal industry, the 2004 study of the
Federal Environment Agency showed that taking the effects of
lignite into account, as well as direct state subsidies, amounts
to €4.5 billion a year.164

The outlook

The mining continues

In August 2008, Saxony’s Prime Minister Stanislaw Tillich
announced that he continues to stand for an energy-mix
that includes lignite, the dirtiest type of coal (see Appendix I:
Coal Basics, page 78). 165 Dr Joachim Geisler, chairman of
the Central German Lignite Company MIBRAG stated that
the company will invest €28 million to modernise surface
mining machinery in 2008. That’s in addition to talking
intensely with partners “about a new development of a coal-
fired power station in Profen”.166

This all means that the massive mining machines will
continue to cut through the country. People are still being
resettled. Forests and whole ecosystems are still being
destroyed.

“With the continuation of surface mining, we delay and
displace the restoration of whole landscapes,” says
Dr Werban, former head of the UNESCO-Biospherereservoir
Spreewald.167 “We could save millions in recultivation, if we
would respect nature more and not try to force everything
through with raw violence. Everything is geared towards
commerce, and only an infinitesimal percentage of
recultivation is dedicated to nature conservation. There is
too little left for nature.”168 It seems nothing has been learnt
from the past. “But nature is reclaiming its share back”, Dr
Werban predicts.

image The soil continues to tell the
story of coal mining. “With the
continuation of surface mining, we
delay and displace the restoration of
whole landscapes,” says Dr Werban,
former head of the UNESCO-
Biospherereservoir Spreewald.

Reclaiming what’s lost

Mining takes functioning ecosystems and reduces
them to piles of sand tailings, overburden and rock.
At just a single mining site, millions of cubic metres of
soil can be moved over the life of the mine. The
devastation is so complete that much of the land
never recovers.

In some parts of the world, reclamation (also known
as recultivation or rehabilitation) activities attempt to
return some ravaged areas to productive land.
However, the extent to which impacted land can be
repaired after mining is open for debate. Mountain
tops cannot be replaced once blown apart, valleys
and streams buried under millions of tonnes of earth
won’t be restored, and cavernous pits created by
opencast mining are likely to remain that way. Mining
so fundamentally alters natural systems that what is
lost can never truly be regained.

In places like the US, there is little evidence to show
that any effort can undo all of the environmental harm
caused during the mining process. This is because of
the poor quality of the soil on reclaimed sites. Soil in
an undisturbed system is a dynamic medium, varying
in its composition and teeming with life. Soils found at
reclaimed sites lack structure, are largely bankrupt
from a nutrient perspective, and devoid of the insect
and plant life. As a result, planting success rates tend
to hover around 20-30% in some areas, while in
others only 10% of new seedlings survive.169

Australia

King Coal’s dirty throne

Australia is heavily dependent
on coal, with over 80% of
electricity sourced from coal-
fired power. But this comes with
a heavy cost. A Greenpeace
report demonstrates how
Australia can reduce reliance
on coal and generate over 40%
of its electricity from renewable
energy by 2020.

66

The port of Newcastle is the
world’s largest coal export point,
currently exporting 80 million
tonnes of coal annually. Plans
are underway to expand capacity
over the next five years to at
least 120 million tonnes annually,
and even as much as 200 million
tonnes per annum.

While coal companies and
governments cannot get Hunter
Valley coal out fast enough, local
farmers and residents are
alarmed at the environmental
and social impacts of coal
dependency. There is a growing
community belief that the costs
of the region’s coal industry
vastly outweigh any perceived
benefits.

The True
Cost of Coal
How people and the

Section

Coal is king in Australia, and the Hunter Valley
region in New South Wales (NSW) is its throne.
Most coal mining in Australia is opencast,
meaning a journey through the Hunter Valley can
often be mistaken for a trip to the moon, with
massive mines stretching out over the horizon.

There is every reason to stop
Mangoola from going ahead.
Not only would an expansion of
mining exacerbate existing water
scarcity issues, but it would force
more than 200 residents to
relocate.

Local residents protesting about
the proposed opencast mine at
Anvil Hill. The mine would cover
more than 3,500 hectares and
destroy vast areas of the local
environment.

This wind turbine at Kooragang
is a reminder that a more
sustainable solution is possible.
Research has shown that the
Hunter Valley could provide 40%
of New South Wales’s energy
from renewable sources by 2020,
creating more than 10,700 jobs
in the process.

67

Nearly a third of all exported coal travelling around the
world comes from Australia.170 Newcastle, in New South
Wales, is the world’s largest coal-exporting port,
shipping out over twice as much coal as the US..171

This coal releases enormous amounts of greenhouse
gases when it’s burnt. Because this happens outside
Australia, these emissions don’t count towards Australia’s
emissions quota – so Australia can ramp up its coal
production with impunity. But aside from being a perfect
example of how to cause catastrophic climate change,
Australia’s mining is responsible for myriad local
environmental damages, many of which are now running
out of control.

The impact of coal first hand:
Hunter Valley

The Hunter Valley is world-renowned for its wine
production and thoroughbred racehorse stud farms. Yet
the environment on which they rely is at risk from mining
(see Land Destruction, page 69). There’s a very real threat
that these multi-million-dollar industries could be
destroyed by the spread of coal mining across the Hunter
Valley, a view shared by many in the region:

“As much as the mining industry would like to believe that
mining and wine tourism can co-exist, that is certainly not
the view of the wine tourism industry”.172

Water shortages

Competition for limited resources is just one manifestation
of the impact of mining on the agricultural activities in the
region. The Hunter Valley region is seriously short of water
– a situation made worse by ongoing drought. The
opencast mines in the area require tremendous quantities
of water to operate, largely to damp down hazardous
dust clouds generated by the large-scale excavations.
The battle over the finite water supply so far has farming
interests on the losing end – water-guzzling coal mines
and power stations continue to get priority access to
water. In fact, when the New South Wales government
announced in 2007 that parts of the state would receive
zero water allocations, coal mines continued to operate
normally, further draining the region’s water supplies.
These cuts have seriously threatened the financial health
of some of the long-established farms in the region.173

Continuing the destruction: Anvil Hill

Despite the obvious and dramatic damage coal is inflicting
on Hunter Valley, plans are in place to double the export
capacity of Newcastle and several new coal mines are
proposed to supply this extra coal.

One of these new mines is the proposed ‘Mangoola’
opencast mine at Anvil Hill. The plan for the mine is
massive – with a project area of more than 3,500 hectares
and seeking to extract more than 220 million tonnes of
coal over two decades.174 Just a single year’s worth of
coal from the mine would produce as much CO2 as the
entire transport sector in New South Wales. The mine
would operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with a
noise impact “almost five times greater than the impact
of any approved mining project in NSW”.175

Local bushland facing extinction

Anvil Hill contains some of the last remaining bushland in
the Hunter Valley. It is home to 440 flora and fauna
species – 25 of which are listed as threatened.176 The area
is sufficiently sensitive and ecologically unique that a
report in 2005 recommended that Anvil Hill should be
protected by making it a nature reserve or managed trust
reserve.177 If Mangoola and other proposed mines go
ahead the expansion of mining will threaten some 1, 300
hectares of this high quality habitat. Mitigation measures
outlined in the Environmental Assessment conducted for
the proposed mine would not adequately compensate for
this loss.178

Threat to industry and community

There is every reason to stop Mangoola from going
ahead. Not only would an expansion of mining exacerbate
existing water scarcity issues, but it would force more
than 200 residents to relocate. The horsebreeding and
wine-growing industries have been vocal in their
opposition to the mine, concerned about their own
relocation – no mean feat for vineyards that take years to
establish. In registering their opposition to the Mangoola
mine, the Upper Hunters Winemakers’ Association noted:

“Many longstanding, sustainable agricultural enterprises
will be displaced by this mine, impacting the existing
communities and families that have, in some cases, been
in operation for generations.”179

image There are more than fifty coal
mines in the Hunter Valley region, mostly
opencast mines. It estimated that over
600 square kilometres of the Hunter Valley
has been affected by coal mining.

Other constituencies, including local residents, have grave
concerns about the proposed mines at Anvil Hill. To argue
their case, the Anvil Hill alliance was formed in 2005. This
local action group has gained support from a number of
NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and has been
actively campaigning to have the plans for the mine
rejected since its inception. In June 2007, more than 400
people spent the weekend camped out on the proposed
site, spelling out the words “Save Anvil Hill” in a clear
message to the state government.

Even people who have worked in the coal industry think
opening up new mines is going a step too far. One
example is Graham Brown, a retired miner who supports
a shift away from coal in the Hunter Valley. He’s keen to
see jobs and the local economy protected by a move to
a low-carbon economy, telling us that “We need a
transition mechanism in place, fully funded by the coal
companies.”180

The future

A more sustainable solution is possible – and it’s one that
local people and environmental groups have been fighting
for. Research has shown that the Hunter Valley could
provide 40% of New South Wales’s energy from
renewable sources by 2020, creating more than 10,700
jobs in the process.181 In fact, with the help of the existing
infrastructure, Hunter Valley could actually become a
renewable energy-exporting region, sending emission-free
electricity around the state, while developing clean energy
technologies for the rest of the world.

Sadly, the reality is not so positive. Shortly after World
Environment Day in June 2007, the New South Wales
government approved Anvil Hill’s transformation into a
coal mine, despite the many reasons not to go ahead
with the plan. The mine has since been sold to Swiss
multinational, Xtrata, in late 2007, having become too
much of a liability for its previous owners Centennial Coal.
The good news is that the mine remains undeveloped.
Whether that stays the case in the future is as yet unclear.

Land Destruction

Massive excavations and huge waste mountains are
among the most visible leftovers from mining. Mining
activities also lead to deforestation of large tracts of
land, the loss of fertile top soils through erosion, and
land subsidence. Much of this land remains barren
and contaminated long after coal mining operations
cease.182

Land disrupted and stripped bare by mining is much
more susceptible to erosion. Soil loss from surface-
mined areas can be one to two thousand times
greater than in than forested areas, and ten times that
of grazing land.183 This soil run-off finds its way to
streams, especially during heavy rain and snow melts,
wreaking havoc on aquatic ecosystems. In large
quantities, this soil run-off can so thoroughly pollute
water bodies that it stops fish from spawning, kills
fish eggs and larvae, suffocates small aquatic life and
blocks out light, preventing photosynthesis.184

Sedimentation also reduces the capacity of
downstream reservoirs and alters water courses,
causing water shortages, flooding and cloudiness.185
If the sediment is contaminated, it can also make
water undrinkable and, in many cases, unfit for use in
agriculture and industry.186

Subsiding land from collapsing mines can also cause
soil erosion as well as disrupt surface and subsurface
drainage and the creation of wet or ponded areas.
When occurring in agricultural areas, these
phenomena can decrease the productivity of
crops.187 For example, in parts of the US, land
classified as moderately and severely affected by
subsidence, and where nothing had been done to
repair the land, has experienced corn yield reductions
anywhere between 42% and 95%.188

“As long as there are
dedicated and selfless
citizens who are for

RISE will continue
campaigning and serve

* Interview with Aurora Alerta Lim, co-convener of RISE. Iloilo City, Philippines. 12 September 2008.

73

This concern over the effects of climate change is a
serious issue for the Philippines. The archipelago was
listed in 2007 by the NGO Germanwatch as the country
most at risk from the effects of climate change.191 The
country is already hit by more severe and frequent
typhoons, as in November 2007 when more than 200,000
people were evacuated.192 It also suffers droughts, and
the 7,107 islands are threatened by rising sea levels. Yet
in spite of this, the government perseveres with coal.

Fighting lies

Much of the work of Aurora (or Tita Au, as friends call her)
and her group of environmental advocates is centred
around countering the lies and half-truths spread by the
coal supporters. She says that much of the enthusiasm
for coal in Iloilo City is based on falsehoods:

“There is a ground swelling of support for coal-fired power
plants in the country due to misinformation that includes
‘clean coal technology’ and the misleading argument that
coal is cheap.” 193

It is easy to see why these claims seduce. Iloilo’s main
energy source is an off-grid 72 MW diesel power plant.
Because diesel is so expensive the electricity rate in the
city is among, if not the most expensive in the country.
What’s more, the city also experiences frequent power
outages. The power station proponents attribute this to a
lack of supply, but the truth is that a new coal-fired power
station in Illoilo City will not solve these problems. Too little
power is not the issue. Disruptions in electricity are
actually due to problems in transmission and
distribution.194 Any electricity price drop that might come
after a new power station is built will be paid for in its
impact on those living in the community. Aurora remarks,

“It will be the people who will have to bear the health and
environmental costs of burning coal.”195

Despite their uphill battle and the power and influence of
coal plant proponents, Aurora isn’t intimidated. She, and
others like her, work ceaselessly to call attention to the
urgency of the climate crisis and our global need for more
sustainable energy sources.

As you enter the city, the division is easy to see. Hundreds
of banners have been hung up around the city. Half say
“yes to coal”. The other half say “no to coal”. A closer look
at the banners shows that the “Yes” banners are
expensive and professionally printed. The “No” ones are
almost all hand painted. Here lies part of the problem:
support for the new power station comes from
government ofﬁcials and rich business groups. In contrast,
the ﬁerce opposition comes from a vast and diverse
alliance of citizens including the inﬂuential Catholic Church,
doctors, professors, engineers, enlightened businessmen,
civic leaders, and students. Overall, one thing becomes
clear: instead of seriously addressing the issue of climate
change and its effects on the poor, the Arroyo government
is promoting privatisation and expansion of Philippine coal-
power plants. But the opposition is growing (see Growing
Resistance, page 75).189

Opposition RISEs up

Despite their diversity, the opposition has become
organised. In 2003, this group of citizens founded
Responsible Ilongos for Sustainable Energy (RISE). Their
first aim was to stop the construction of a coal-fired
power plant in the fishing village of Ajuy in Northern Iloilo,
and to promote sustainable development through
renewable energy.

RISE was immediately effective. It was able to delay the
power plant in Ajuv until the funder, KEPCO, eventually
pulled out and transferred the project further south to the
coastal town of Banate in the hope of facing less
opposition. Here again, RISE convinced the Provincial
Board to turn down the proposal.

Sadly, this wasn’t the end of it. The plan for a coal-fired
power plant was moved again, this time to Iloilo City, and
RISE moved with it.

Aurora – a story of resistance

Aurora Alerta Lim is a determined lady. Recently retired
assistant to the Central Philippine University president of
environmental concerns, she produces and co-hosts an
environmental talk show on the university TV channel and
is one of the leaders of the RISE campaign. “The greatest
challenge,” she told us, “is the apathy of the national and
city government to global warming. They endorse the use
of coal for energy generation despite our warning against
the severe impact of climate change.”190

is established on the site of the proposed
coal-fired power plant in Iloilo City. For the
gathering of local communities and pro-
renewable energy groups who pledge to
continue work to help stopping climate
change, a Greenpeace volunteer cooks
noodles using a solar cooker.

Fighting for a sustainable future

Thanks to the work of people like Aurora, RISE is gaining
momentum. In March 2008, thousands followed a call by
the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines
(CBCP) to take part in an ecumenical prayer rally in Iloilo.
The rally demonstrated against coal, and campaigned for
the right to choose a sustainable development path. Even
the governors of neighbouring provinces have spoken out
against coal, and have set examples by securing their
provinces’ future energy supply with small-scale hydro
and wind turbines.

Yet Iloilo officials are still falling for the industry’s claim that
coal is the best possible source of energy for Iloilo,
despite the availability of affordable alternatives. As Aurora
pointed out to us, “There are several sources of energy
which Iloilo can tap. We are campaigning for an increase
in the transmission of geothermal energy, solar, wind,
hydropower, and biomass for cogeneration.”196

The outlook

The protests in the last year did have some effect, as the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources
(DENR) froze the environmental certificate of compliance
(ECC) for the planned power plant for several months. But
it wasn’t enough to stop it completely. Despite a strong
and organised opposition, the certificate was granted this
past September.

While this condemns the region to an as-yet unknown
human cost, it’s not the end of it. RISE doesn’t even think
about giving up:

“As long as there are dedicated and selfless citizens who
are for sustainable development, RISE will continue
campaigning and serve as watchdogs for the
environment.”197

In Iloilo, a dedicated local group of activists fully
understand the impact coal will have on their community,
damaging human health, ecosystems, and quality of life.
In their fight, they are also defending all the planet’s
inhabitants from devastating, runaway climate change.

Growing Resistance

In 1844, legendary social theorist Friedrich Engels
spoke of: "an industrial revolution, a revolution which
at the same time changed the whole of civil
society”.198 Coal played a central part in this. Today,
coal powers a different kind of revolution, one where
resistance movements are forming against its
continued use. In the places profiled in this report and
elsewhere, communities around the globe are rising
up and saying no to coal – organising protests
against proposed power plants and opencast mines,
occupying building sites and blockading coal trains
and shipments.

In Poland, about 5,000 people took to the streets in
Kruszwica in April 2008, to oppose the plans for an
opencast mine near Poland’s cradle of cultural
heritage and nature reserve, Lake Gopło.199 This was
the first protest of its kind in the country’s history. In
Australia, an alliance between thoroughbred
horsebreeders, vineyard owners and local residents
formed to oppose a new opencast mine in Anvil Hill.
Disguised as railway workers, protesters in the UK
stopped a coal train on its way to the nation’s largest
power plant, Drax Power Station, in June 2008.
Some climbed onto the train and unloaded almost 20
tonnes of coal on to the tracks. Others chained
themselves to it. “Leave it in the ground” read the
banner, which activists unfurled during their action.200
In the autumn of 2008, anti-coal activists in Germany
started a petition for a referendum to stop further site
developments of surface mines in the federal state of
Brandenburg.201

All of these actions demonstrate that resistance
against inhumane, climate-destructive and harmful
practices such as burning coal is growing and set
only to get stronger.

Leaving
coal behind

That coal wreaks havoc and destruction on the
planet and our health could be the understatement
of the century. Coal is causing our planet harm.
That is easy to see. In this report, we’ve looked at
the damage caused right along its chain of custody
– from digging it out of the ground to what remains
after it has been burnt.

We’ve exposed the destruction caused by mining – from
black lung disease to coal fires and acid mine drainage.
We’ve uncovered the effects of coal-fired power plants
locally and globally, including the urgent threat of
greenhouse gases building up in the atmosphere. We’ve
also spotlighted coal’s legacy – the often-forgotten harm
caused by abandoned mines and the reclamation
attempts that never really work.

Finally, with the analysis of CE Delft, we’ve put a price tag
on some of the more conspicuous ‘external’ costs
associated with coal’s chain of custody on a global scale.
The total came to roughly €360 billion a year- a staggering
number that nevertheless is likely to be an underestimation.
It is simply impossible today to assess all potential
emissions and precisely quantify every incidence of
damage induced by coal around the world.

The true cost of coal underlines the urgent need for action
to avoid the disastrous consequences of a coal-powered
future. Indeed, coal must be phased out if we are to keep
global temperature rises as far below 2OC as possible
(compared to pre-industrial levels) and avoid catastrophic
climate change. However, even in the face of climate
change and all the other costs that come with coal, many
countries still harbour plans to build new coal-fired power
stations . If all current plans are realised, CO2 emissions
from coal will increase 60% by 2030.202 Not only is this a
totally unsustainable plan for the future, it’s an unnecessary
and dangerous one.

There are options available to us other than coal – options
that work. Greenpeace’s Energy [R]evolution provides a
practical blueprint that shows how renewable energy,
combined with greater energy efficiency, can cut global
CO2 emissions from fossil fuels by 50%.203 This solution
provides the same level of energy “services” while phasing
out reliance on coal.

This is possible because decades of technological
progress have moved renewable energy technologies
into the mainstream – technologies like wind turbines,
solar photovoltaic panels, biomass power plants and
solar thermal collectors. The market for renewable
energy is also growing dramatically; in 2007, global
annual investment in renewable energy exceeded
US$100 billion.204 At the same time, our use of energy is
shamefully inefficient: a large proportion of the coal
being burned is just wasted, something which can easily
be avoided through available technology measures.

Leaving coal behind is the only way forward. The world
simply cannot to afford to continue with it – the costs to
the climate, our planet and ourselves is much too high.
Coal may have been essential in powering the Industrial
Revolution, but now its time has passed. It is time to bring
about a revolution of another sort – one powered by
clean, sustainable energy solutions that will protect our
climate, health and environment now and for generations
to come.

Appendix I
Coal Basics

Assembled here are the basics on coal: its different
types, how it is mined, technologies used to burn it
and how much countries have, produce and
consume every year.

Anthracite is the hardest type of coal – often with more
than 90% of its weight in fixed carbon. Because of this
higher energy value, it’s used in heating.

Coal types

Coal is a fossil fuel. This means it was originally organic
matter (wood and leaves) that was subjected to pressure
and heat, taking on a compacted, carbon-rich form over
millions of years.

The quality of coal depends on its carbon content, which in
turn depends on what temperatures and pressures the coal
formed under. The higher the carbon content of coal, the
higher its energy value and the more heat it produces when
burned. This energy value is usually measured in British
Thermal Units (Btu value). The Btu value of different coals
can vary enormously. For example, peat has a Btu value of
4,500, while the value for the hardest coal can be over
14,000.205

There are many different types of coal, but most fall into
one of four main categories:206

Lignite (also known as brown coal) has the lowest carbon
content and the highest amount of moisture. It’s
geologically younger than other forms of coal, and mostly
used in power generation. Brown coal is the dirtiest coal
type as the process converting it into usable energy is very
intensive. For example, it takes ﬁve tonnes of lignite to yield
the equivalent energy level of one tonne of hard coal.

Sub-bituminous coal contains more carbon and less
moisture than lignite. Like lignite, it is used for power
generation. It is also used for other purposes, including
making cement.

Bituminous coal is considered a hard coal, with up to 86%
of its weight in fixed carbon (the carbon that remains in the
coal after volatile material is taken out before burning). As
well as being used in power generation, it’s often turned
into coke to be used in iron and steel manufacturing.207

78

Coal mining

Coal is mined in either opencast (also called mountain top,
surface or strip mining) or underground mining. Each
approach carries with it different costs, health and safety, as
well as environmental issues.

Opencast mining

Opencast mining is used if coal seams are found near the
surface of the earth. It’s cheaper than underground mining
and arguably more “efficient”, as coal recovery rates are
90%. In opencast mining, the earth and rock above the
coal seam (called overburden) are broken up by explosives
and taken away. The exposed coal seam is drilled so it
fractures, and then the loose coal is removed.208 Globally,
about 40% of coal mines are opencast. But in some
countries the percentage is much higher. Opencast mines
make up 80% of mines in Australia, and 67% in the US.209

Opencast mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife
habitats by literally blowing the tops off of mountains and
tearing apart landscapes. This method of mining leads to
deforestation, erosion, subsidence, lowering of water tables
and the destruction of agricultural land. The public health of
miners and local communities is threatened by the dust
generated by the explosions and drilling.210

Underground mining

Underground mining is used to reach coal buried too deep
for opencast techniques. It’s less efficient, more labour
intensive and more expensive than opencast mining. But
since most of the world’s coal is buried deep, the majority
of the world’s coal mines are underground.211

Appendix

There are two main underground mining methods – Room
and pillar and Longwall mining. Room and pillar mining is
used for shallower coal seams. It involves cutting rooms
into the coal seams and leaving pillars of coal to support
the roof (hence the lower recovery rate). Longwall mining
has a higher recovery rate because it uses mechanical
shearers to mine the coal, and power supports to keep
the mine stable. After the support structures are removed,
the mine collapses.212

Underground mining brings huge amounts of waste earth
and rock to the surface – waste that often becomes toxic
when it comes into contact with air and water.
Underground mining also causes subsidence as mines
collapse and the land above it starts to sink. Subsidence
can cause serious structural damage to homes and
buildings and can tear up infrastructure like highways,
buildings and bridges. In Australia an earthquake caused
by underground mining in 1989 destroyed hundreds of
homes, killing 13 people and injuring another 165. The
costs caused by the disaster were higher than the proﬁt the
mine had generated since its opening 90 years earlier.213

Less catastrophic effects attributable to subsidence include
soil erosion, disruption of surface and subsurface drainage,
and wet or ponded areas. It also lowers the water table,
changing the flow of groundwater and streams.214

Coal combustion technologies

There are three types of coal power plant currently in use to
create electricity:

Pulverised coal-fired (PCF) power plants. In these plants,
coal is ground into a fine powder and blown into a boiler. It
burns at between 1,300°C and 1,700°C, creating steam
that drives a generator and turbine.215 This method is by far
the most established and common of the three. PCF plants
account for over 90% of the electricity produced from coal,
and about 38% of the power generated from any source
around the world.216

The bad news is that PCF plants are also horribly inefficient.
While it’s true that new, so-called super-critical and ultra-
critical plants can reach thermal efficiencies of up to 50%,
the worldwide average thermal efficiency of PCF plants is
less than 32%.217, 218

Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) plants. Here, coal is
burned with air in a fluid bed mixing gas and solids. This is
done either at ambient pressure (called Atmospheric FBC)
or under pressure (called Pressurised FBC) and at
temperatures lower than those in PCF plants.

FBC technology can be used with low quality coal or coal
mixed with other fuels like biomass. Thermal efficiencies
range between 40% and 44%. The lower combustion
temperatures in FBC systems cuts the amount of nitrogen
oxide (NOx) produced.219 Finally, because more than 95% of
sulphur pollutants from the coal can be captured inside the
boiler, FBC plants produce far less sulphur dioxide (SO2) 220

Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants. IGCC
plants are the newest of the three, with average thermal
efficiency percentages in the 40s. At present, the use of
IGCC for coal-based electricity production is limited, with
only four coal-based IGCC demonstration plants in
operation globally, two located in the US, one in Spain and
one in the Netherlands.221 The process they use involves
two separate steps: first, coal is turned into gas through a
controlled “shortage” of air in an enclosed pressurised
reactor. The resulting gas – a mixture of carbon monoxide
(CO) and Hydrogen (H2) called Syngas – is then burnt to
drive a gas turbine. In the second step, the exhaust gas
from step one is used to create steam that drives a
separate steam turbine. Typically, the gas turbine in step
one generates between 60% and 70% of the power, with
the steam turbine generating the rest.

Appendix II
True Cost of
Coal Calculation

The true cost of coal figure presented in this report
is a preliminary calculation that evaluates some of
the hidden costs of coal - those costs not included
in the price per tonne of coal or the coal-based
electricity that powers our society.

To approximate a true cost for coal, the independent
Dutch research institute CE Delft conservatively evaluated
the external costs in 2007 of the human health impacts
from air pollution from coal, damages attributable to
climate change and fatalities due to major accidents
resulting from mining operations. These costs were
separately compiled and then combined to arrive at a
ﬁgure which estimates a lower limit for the costs that
coal exacted on humans and the environment in 2007.

The analysis reveals that:

• The approximate annual damage burden of coal
combustion in power plants, from the factors
examined, is roughly €355.75 billion.

• the approximate global damage burden related to

accidents in the coal power chain, from the factors
examined, is €161.28 million.

• the approximate annual damage costs of mining,

from the factors examined, is €674million.

The cost of coal presented in this report does not
represent a comprehensive evaluation of all the external
impacts attributable to the coal chain of custody.
Accurate and reliable data for many parts of this chain,
i.e. economic damages attributable to acid mine drainage,
simply do not exist on a global scale. Quantifying many
social impacts, such as community displacement, loss of
cultural heritage and human rights violations, in a credible
manner, is virtually impossible.

It is with these caveats that the methodology for this
analysis is provided below. To access the full report for
this assessment, please go to: www.greenpeace.org.

Scope of analysis

The calculation for the true cost of coal examined the
following factors:

• Costs for society attributable to climate change

• Human health impact that result from air pollution

Data collection

Determining global emissions from coal

For this analysis, emissions are primarily derived from existing
data on a national level, for the largest coal-power producing
countries. Emissions are separately assessed for power
generation (plant level) and for mining. As the aim of this
study is to derive an estimate of global damages, it is not
necessary to link exact ﬂows of coal from mines to power
plants. Instead, all emissions related to mining are assessed,
and approximately 91% of emissions related to global power
generation (based on International Energy Agency data). It is
important to note here that direct assessments of damage
costs are unavailable for many countries around the world.

1. Primary emissions from coal combustion

Carbon dioxide (CO2)
Based on global CO2 emissions from power generation, a
ranking of the ten polluters was compiled – the US, China,
India, Japan, Germany, South Africa, Australia, Russia
and Poland. These countries account for 85% of global
coal combustion emissions. Together with emissions from
other EU countries225, 91% of global coal combustion
emissions are covered. These are the countries that are
assessed further for polluting emissions, referred to as
“classical pollutants”226 in this analysis (See Table II.1).

Sulphur dioxide (SO2)
The EU was assessed in the aggregate, with country-
speciﬁc data derived for the US, China, India, Japan,
South Africa, Australia, Russia (See Table II.1).

Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
The EU was assessed in the aggregate, with country-
speciﬁc data derived for the US, China, India, Japan,
South Africa, Australia, Russia (See Table II.1).

Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5
Data for China, Japan, South Africa, the EU and US are
included (See Table II.1).

Methane (CH4)
An aggregate global ﬁgure was generated, which was
based on a generic emission factor of kg CH4 generated
per tonne of coal equivalent for methane emissions from
coal storage at power stations (See Table II.1).

2. Emissions from coal mining

Global emissions related to mining were included in this
analysis by relying on data from EcoInvent 2007. For
several regions (East Asia, Eastern Europe, Western
Europe and North America), average emission data was
used. Pollutants assessed for economic analysis were
CO2, CH4, PM 2.5, SO2 and NOx (See Table II.2).

Calculations

1. Damages attributable to climate change

Annual damage costs in the year 2007 for coal-derived
CO2 and CH4 emissions were estimated for this analysis.
This included emissions from both coal combustion and
mining operations. A prevention cost assessment was
performed by using a ﬁgure of €20/tonne. This value is
based on the approximate prevention costs for CO2,
which were estimated by using the average price for
carbon credits in the European Union Emission Trading
Scheme (EU ETS). 227 This was done in lieu of using
ﬁgures for actual damage costs caused by CO2 emissions
as there is a great deal of uncertainty associated with
such ﬁgures. It is important to note that CO2 prevention
costs will increase sharply. Some studies show the price
may very well double in the next decade and as much as
ten times by mid-century. While future costs for CO2
prevention were not considered in the context of this
analysis, a review of projected costs are provided in the
table below.

For CH4, a factor of 23 was applied to reﬂect the impact
of methane on global warming as compared to CO2 and
to estimate damage costs – €460/tonne. These values
were then multiplied by the estimated annual emissions
(See Table II.1) to calculate overall climate change-related
damage costs attributable to these pollutants.

2. Human health impacts that result from air pollution

For non-CO2 pollutants, or “classical pollutants”, a
calculation of damage costs per tonne of emissions was
performed. The basis of the damage costs for this
calculation was the European-Union-based NEEDS
(Network of Europeans for Electoral and Democracy
Support) project (the last stage of the ExternE series),
which has attached a monetary estimate to health
impacts resulting from emissions of speciﬁc air pollutants.
These estimates are available for emissions in 39
European and non-European countries and ﬁve sea
regions. The results also include estimates of EU-average
damage costs per tonne of speciﬁc pollutants.

The ﬁgures used in the NEEDS project were based
primarily on willingness to pay (WTP) values from empirical
studies on evaluation of mortality and morbidity effects.
These ﬁgures were adjusted using purchasing power
parity (PPP) factors and consequently, an average value
weighted with respect to population was calculated to
provide more representative ﬁgures for a global
calculation. 228

Without being able to run a full model including
background pollution, dispersion pattern, population
affected, meteorological conditions etc, only very rough
estimates could be produced.

3. Fatalities due to major accidents resulting from
mining operations

Damage costs for mining accidents per unit of electricity
generation have been previously calculated by Hirschberg
at al., 2004 (See Table II.4). These ﬁgures include only
accidents with more than ﬁve fatalities.

Results

Combustion

The analysis reveals that the approximate annual external
costs of coal combustion, from the factors examined, is
€355.75 billion.

Mining

The analysis reveals that the approximate annual external
costs of coal mining, from the factors examined, is
€673.87 million. The total value is signiﬁcantly lower than
those values related to coal combustion. However, it is
worth noting that this analysis is incomplete. Factors such
as ecosystem destruction, water and soil contamination
etc. were not included in this analysis due to the lack of
reliable global data for these kinds of impacts.

Accidents

The analysis reveals that the approximate annual external
costs of mining accidents, from the factors examined, is
€161.28 million.

Conclusion

Combining all damages listed above, CE Delft arrived at a
total damage ﬁgure of roughly €360 billion. As discussed
previously, this estimate does not include all possible
emissions or all possible damages and should therefore
be considered lower limits. This is true even for the factors
considered in this analysis as not all the data was
complete, however the analysis still covered 91% of all
emissions. For example, including emissions of particulate
matter from Russia and India might have increased the
estimate considerably. In the context of the parameters
considered, this analysis shows that coal combustion in
power plants accounts for the greatest level of damage. It
is responsible for more than 99% of the total. Damage
burden due to mining emissions is estimated to be about
€674 million per year, and damage burden due to
accidents – about €161 million per year.

will increase to 40.4 Gt CO2-eq in 2030 under a business as

223 Note here that these numbers differ slightly depending on the
source. For example, the IEA statistical data propose that the
world produces a total of 6284 Mt coal per year; China 2481
Mt; and the US 1066 Mt (see IEA 2007 “Key World Statistics”,
OECD/IEA 2007.)

225 The other EU countries included in this analysis are Spain, the
Czech Republic, Italy, Greece, France, Netherlands, Romania,
Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland and Belgium.

226 So-called “classical pollutants” include sulphur dioxide,
nitrogen oxides, particulate matter 2.5 and methane.

227 Although country-specific marginal abatement costs are
available, these cannot be taken as a proxy for society’s
willingness to pay (WTP) per country, unless more evidence to
support such values is available, see ExternE 2005.

228 Translating European-based WTP numbers for global use
could have been achieved with several other factors aside
from PPP, i.e. by GDP per capita at PPP and by average
incomes. Per country, these methods lead to very different
numbers, but all methods lead to roughly the same global
number: €360 billion in 2007.
