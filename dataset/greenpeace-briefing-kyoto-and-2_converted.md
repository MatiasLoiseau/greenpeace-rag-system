Kyoto and the Bali Mandate:
what the world needs to do to combat climate change

Climate change is undoubtedly the greatest environmental threat facing the planet today.
According to a series of reports released throughout 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) the impacts of climate change are already being felt, particularly in the
poorest countries of the world – those with least capacity to adapt and the least historical
responsibility for causing climate change. Immediate action is required to keep global mean
temperature rise as far below 2˚C as possible compared to pre-industrial levels in order to avoid
the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.

The IPCC reports also state that our “[M]itigation efforts over the next two to three decades will
have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels”. In other words, we
need to act now. Time is not on our side. If we want to keep temperature rise below 2°C, global
emissions need to peak by 2015 and then be reduced by at least 50% by 2050 (from 1990
levels). This means industrialized countries cutting their emissions by at least 30% by 2020 and
by at least 80% by 2050.

Keeping global temperature rise below 2˚C is still possible
It is still technologically, economically and scientifically possible to keep global temperature rise
well below 2ºC, but we are within a decade or two of closing off those options with known
technological means.

The consequences of delay in the process of reducing emissions are serious. If we delay, we will
face a dire global emergency in the 2020s which will require rates of emissions reductions, which
in the past have only been associated with massive economic collapse, i.e., with the collapse of
the Soviet Union. We must not allow ourselves to be forced to choose between economic
catastrophe and climate catastrophe…the most likely outcome in that case would be both. We
have a good chance of avoiding this if we act now.

Industrialized countries must act first
From a moral, legal and practical perspective, the initial burden of emissions reductions has to fall
on industrialized countries. Domestic reductions of at least 30% on 1990 levels (the ‘baseline’
year for the Kyoto Protocol) by 2020 from industrialized countries are required, with a target of at
least 80% reductions by mid-century. However, a fair means must be found for engaging rapidly
industrialising countries in reduction efforts in the near future.

Although climate change is at last taking centre stage globally with discussions in fora such as
ASEAN, APEC the G8 and now the United Nations High Level meeting, not enough urgency
prevails in these discussions and there is insufficient momentum towards the crucial United
Nations climate negotiations to be held in Bali, Indonesia in December of this year.  What must be
agreed at this negotiation is a Bali Mandate that establishes the ambition, content, process and
timetable for negotiation of the next stage of international action on climate change to be
concluded by 2009.

The Bali Mandate
A strong Mandate in Bali is a first critical step towards the negotiation of essential
agreements that can peak emissions by 2015.  Without this step the world cannot have
confidence that the international community is seriously tackling this issue.

If we are to prevent, or avoid being committed to, dangerous climate change the Bali Mandate
has to be ambitious.  It must set the parameters for the negotiations in 2008 and 2009 that can
set the world on a course to stay as far below a 2ºC  temperature rise as possible. This requires
that the emission limits and actions to be negotiated under the Bali Mandate achieve the
following:

• Peak in global emission by 2015 and put the world on a track that can lead to more

than a halving of global emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels;
followed by

• Developed countries emission reductions commitments, as a group, of at least
30% by 2020 (from 1990 levels) and virtually complete decarbonisation (greater
than 85% reductions) by 2050.

Recent studies have revealed that the response from the climate to the anticipated rise in
greenhouse gases (GHGs) could be even more dramatic than previously thought. We
have to act even faster and take more dramatic action if we are to avoid the damage
associated with a 2ºC global average temperature rise. This means that for now we have
to aim for stabilizing GHGs in the atmosphere at a level below 400 ppm and then seek to
bring them down as rapidly as possible.

In accordance with the principles of historical responsibility and equity,industrialized
countries must take the lead in substantially reducing emissions whilst a means must be
found to involve rapidly developing countries in reduction efforts in the near future.

•

Including more countries in the Kyoto emission trading regime, which meansnewly
industrialised countries with a high per capita incomes such as South Korea,
Singapore and Saudi Arabia should join the Kyoto system and adopt binding
emission limitation targets for the next commitment period beginning 2013.

Setting the world on the pathway to 50% global reductions by 2050 must include more
countries than currently have binding reduction commitments. The present list of
countries with commitments should not be viewed as set in stone. There are a number of
countries that are at least as wealthy as those on the original list and by any measure of
fairness should be taking on binding targets after 2012.

• New market mechanisms to create incentives for rapidly industrialising, middle

income countries such as China, Brazil, India and South Africa to participate in the
Kyoto emissions trading system (through sectoral or other quantified action
commitments for greenhouse gas emission limitations and/or reductions (e.g. for
the electricity sector).

These mechanisms will need to be tailored, to the different circumstances of middle
income countries but must all involve additional action and not involve crediting for action
that would have happened anyway. These countries should actively support the
development of these mechanisms and to be involved in their implementation

•

Establish architecture for the Kyoto second commitment period that would enable
any developing country that wishes to join the international trading system with
national level quantitative emissions limitation commitments to do so.

This would allow a developing country to volunteer to negotiate a national emissions
reduction target and having done so, that country would then be eligible to join the
international trading system.

• A massive new Clean Technology Deployment Mechanism system aimed at
switching to clean, efficient, renewable technology in developing countries.

Developing countries need assistance to follow a low carbon path to development. The
availability of resources and technology from the industrialized countries is critical as is
the capacity and ability of the developing countries to act. New and effective forms of
clean technology cooperation and deployment combining financing with set goals and
policies are required to enable developing countries as a group to contribute to the global
effort.

• A Deforestation Reduction Mechanism that provides the necessary scale and

financing to drastically reduce deforestation. The reductions from forest protection
must be additional to cuts in industrial emissions.

Tropical forests contain up to 40% of the world’s terrestrial carbon and play a powerful
role in mitigating the growing instability of the climate. Therefore addressing deforestation
must be a critical component of the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol, Funding for this
mechanism must be linked to developed country emission reduction commitments and
the resulting reductions must be additional to cuts in fossil fuel emission targets by
developed countries. The world needs deeper cuts in both fossil fuel and deforestation
emissions in order to keep us well below a 2˚C rise in global mean temperatures.

Accounting for the reduction of emissions from deforestation must be done at a national
level and not project by project. A project which reduces deforestation in one part of a
country could simply lead to more deforestation in other parts of that country whereas a
national approach would account for all of the emissions from all of the projects within a
country.
Actions funded under the Deforestation Reduction Mechanism must also protect
biodiversity and engage and share benefits with local indigenous peoples.  This must not
turn into an international subsidy for logging companies and agribusiness

Credits from a Deforestation Reduction Mechanism should not be freely/openly traded
within an international carbon market for industrial greenhouse gas emissions. Markets
like the CDM contain strict governance, monitoring, and verification requirements for
participants, which some of the most important developing countries with tropical forests
would not be able to meet. Also, the inclusion of a large number of cheap deforestation
credits could potentially “flood” the market, thus delaying industrialized countries from
making the necessary changes in the energy sector now (because they would purchase
the cheap deforestation credits instead).

• An Adaptation Mechanism track with a reliable financing mechanism linked to real
needs  and  coupled   to  a large   international   effort  to scale   up  adaptation   action,
which at present falls far short of needs

The impacts  of climate change will  disproportionately  affect  those societies  who have
contributed the least to the problem. Developing countries don't have the resources that
the wealthy countries have to adapt to the impacts of climate change. They are often
cultures that rely on the land (farming and hunting) for subsistence and economic activity.

The funds currently available to assess and counter the projected impacts do not begin to
provide anywhere near the scale of funding required: $50bn per year as a minimum. A
post 2012 regime must ensure consistent and sufficient funding linked to the costs of
adaptation and damages for the most vulnerable countries and should prioritise the most
vulnerable communities and those with the least capacity to cope with climate change
impacts.

This package to be agreed to by 2009 at the latest

The carbon markets and business need political certainty to provide a favourable investment
environment for the deployment of climate-friendly, sustainable technologies. Continuity is
required to signal an ongoing and strengthening commitment to emission reductions and
keep the carbon market strong and the price of carbon high. A gap between the first and
second phase of Kyoto would. severely compromise this signal and  be disastrous for the
price of carbon

Summary
In summary, global emissions must be cut by at least 50% by 2050. The “aspirational targets”,
that are being promoted by some at fora such as APEC or the ‘major economies meeting’ in
Washington D.C. will not be effective in securing the emission reductions required. History shows
this unequivocally. Recognising that the non-binding targets in the United Nations Framework on
Climate Change were inadequate to protect the climate, the international community agreed
binding emission cuts - for industrialized nations - in Kyoto in 1997.

The Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution Scenario1shows, that we can reduce emissions from the
power sector by 50% by 2050, if we ensure both a massive uptake of sustainable renewable
energy options and double the efficiency with which we use energy.

There is still time but it is indeed getting very late. Ominously, the climate is changing faster than
we imagined and impacts coming earlier than were predicted. The costs of adaptation to
inevitable changes in the next decade or so are already staggering.  Sober scientists and
economists are raising alarm bells that can be ignored only at great peril to us all

There is no time for diversions. The world’s governments must concentrate their discussions on
mandating a framework for negotiations on the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol
at Bali.
