Forest destruction, climate change and palm oil expansion in Indonesia 3©Image CopyrightForests are vital to life on earth. They are the richest of all
ecosystems - covering only eight per cent of the planet1
and are home to two thirds of all known species of terrestrialplants and animals
2.  Millions of people rely directly on forests
for food, water, medicines and other basic materials. 
For these forest peoples the forest defines their culture and
way of life. Within developing countries, one billion of the
world's poorest people depend upon forests for part of theirlivelihoods, and as many as 350 million people living in and
around forests are heavily dependent on forests for theirlivelihoods and security
3.
Forests are also important in helping regulate global climateand weather patterns, critical environmental systems thatsupport life on Earth.
Much of the world's original forests have either been severely
degraded or have disappear ed completely. W e are destroying
forests at an unpr ecedented rate, with an area of forest the
size of a football pitch cut down every two seconds. Half ofthe forests lost in the last 10,000 years have met their end inthe last 80 years and most of that destruction took place inthe last 30 years
4. 
This is driving major biodiversity loss on earth as well asdestroying the livelihoods of many millions of forest dependentpeoples.  The current extinction rate of plant and animalspecies is approximately 1,000 times faster than it was in pr e-
human times
5.  Scientists claim that the Earth is in the sixth
major extinction event6and that extinction rates will further
increase ten fold by the year 20507. The forests and climate change
About one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions arecaused by deforestation, mainly from tropical forests
8.  
This excludes emissions arising from forest degradation 
from activities such as industrial selective logging, both 
legal and illegal.
Forests and their soils are huge carbon stores - more so than
any other land-based ecosystem. According to FAO studies9,
they store nearly three hundred billion tonnes equivalent to 40times the amount curr ently emitted to the atmosphere every
year through the burning of fossil fuels and the production ofcement
10. 
According to recent estimates, Indonesia is the world's thirdlargest greenhouse gas emitter behind only China and theUSA
11.   Indonesia's high level of emissions is a consequence
of the staggering rate at which its forests ar e being cleared -
amounting to almost 2 million hectar es per year12- and
particularly the destruction of carbon-rich peatland forests. An estimated two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) arereleased each year fr om the drainage and bur ning of peatland
forests alone in South East Asia, equivalent to eight per cent
of global emissions from the use of fossil fuels. Fully 90 percent of CO2 emissions from peatland forests in South East
Asia comes from Indonesia alone

4 Forest destruction, climate change and palm oil expansion in IndonesiaAncient Forests: the Climate Coolers
Ancient forests play an essential role in regulating the world's
climate and global weather patterns, critical environmental
systems that support life on earth. Today, only 20 per cent of the world's original forests remain in large, intact forest
landscapes (IFL)
14. 
Fragmentation through human activities such as industriallogging, degrades ancient forests and increases their
vulnerability to drought and fires, both of which are expectedto increase in tropical forest regions as a result of climatechange. This creates a vicious cycle and a climate feedbackloop, in which degraded for est becomes increasingly
vulnerable to for est fir es, which in tur n releases yet mor e
greenhouse gases, further driving climate change, leading tomore fires and fragmentation. 
Preventing climate change from reaching dangerous levels
demands that the rise in average global temperature,compared to pre-industrial levels, is kept as far below 2degrees Celsius as possible. To achieve this requires urgentinternational action to drastically cut greenhouse gas
emissions fr om two major sources: burning of fossil fuels for
energy and deforestation. These sources account for abouttwo-thirds and one-fifth of emissions to the atmosphererespectively.
Greenpeace is promoting an energy revolution requiring
countries to invest in renewable energy and improving energy
efficiency. Greenpeace is also seeking a strong commitment
to halt for est destruction worldwide and to have these goals
enshrined in an international agreement which is binding ongovernments. The Paradise Forests: Indonesia
The Paradise Forests of Asia Pacific stretch from peninsular
Southeast Asia, through Indonesia, and on to Papua New
Guinea and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific. The ParadiseForests are home to hundreds of indigenous cultures and
countless plants and animals found nowhere else in the
world.   
Indonesia has the largest remaining forest area within the
Paradise Forests, consisting of both large tracts of intactforests and secondary forest areas. An estimated 88.5 millionhectares of forests remain
15.  While this may seem a lot, in
reality almost half of Indonesia's forests have been destroyed
since 1950 when the country's total forest cover was 162million ha
16. 
Indonesia is currently losing its forests faster than any other
major forested country17.  Around 51 square kilometres of
forests are destroyed every day, equivalent to over 300
football fields per hour.

Forest destruction, climate change and palm oil expansion in Indonesia 5Drivers of forest destruction in Indonesia 
A staggering 72 percent of Indonesia's intact forest
landscapes (IFL) have either disappeared or been severely
degraded from decades of industrial and illegal logging18.  
The once mighty for ests of Borneo and Kalimantan have fallen
victim to unscrupulous logging companies and timber barons,with large tracts of intact forests only existing in mountainous
and less accessible areas. Only the Indonesian provinces of
Papua and Papua Barat, on the Western side of the Island ofNew Guinea, hold extensive areas of large intact forests
19. 
But these too are coming under increased pressure as theloggers move to new forests and fr om the gr owing thr eat fr om
the booming palm oil industry.
The World Bank estimates that up to 80 per cent of logging in
Indonesia is illegal,  but even without the problems of illegal
20
logging, the logging effort in Indonesia is currentlyunsustainable.  In 2006, a total of 29 million hectar es of
Indonesia's forests had been earmarked for loggingconcessions, with a further 10 million earmarked for totalconversion into timber plantations
21. 
One of the growing new threats to Indonesia's forests is the'gold rush' for developing oil palm plantations, driven by theincreasing global demand for palm oil for food, use in thecosmetics industry and the emerging demand for so-calledgreen biofuels.
The area of land under oil palm plantation in Indonesia has
almost tripled in the ten years between 1995 and 2005 with anearly ten-fold increase in the past 20 years
22.  Close to six
million hectares of oil palm plantations have already beendeveloped and millions mor e are planned. The Ministry of
Energy plans to develop four million hectares by 2015,alongside an additional three million hectares for Jatrophaplantations for the use in biofuel alone
23.  Accor ding to
research conducted by a coalition of Indonesian NGOs in2005, provincial and district governments have plans for 20million hectares of oil palm plantation development
24.  Palm Oil expansion into peatlands: 
A global climate killer
The conversion of forests into plantations not only destroys
valuable forests, but is also the leading contributor toIndonesia's massive greenhouse gas emissions.  One of thekey reasons for this is the destruction of peatland forests in
Kalimantan and Sumatra, especially for palm oil production.  
Tropical peatlands have been created over tens of thousands
of years under peat swamp forests.  As these forests die they
form large peat mounds, rich in the accumulated carbon of
generations of trees. Indonesia has 22.5 million hectares ofpeat soils, which is 12 per cent of Indonesia's land area and83 per cent of South-east Asian peatlands
25. It is estimated
that Southeast Asia's peat soils store 42 billion tonnes ofcarbon
26.  
In order to pr epare peatlands for agricultural use, companies
start by digging canals thr ough an ar ea to drain the peatlands
of water and remove the valuable timber.  Once drained, peatmounds collapse in on themselves and become dry andhighly flammable.  When the carbon in the soil is exposed tooxygen, it oxidises and r eleases its carbon to the atmosphere.
Even when not burnt, each hectare of drained peatlandreleases about 100 tonnes of CO2 each year. The release ofCO2 occurs quickly if fire is used to clear the remaining forest.It is the drainage and clearing of the peatland  drivesgreenhouse gas emissions, the use of fire merely speeds upthe process. 
Despite this there are plans to continue to expand oil palm
production in these areas. A report of the Indonesian ForestMinistry and the European Union states: 
“The world demand for palm oil is forecast to increase from its
present 20.2 million tonnes a year to 40 million tonnes in2020. If this demand is to be met, 300.000 ha of new estateswill need to be planted in each of the next 20 years. W e
predict that by far the largest slice of this new land will comefrom within Indonesia where labour and land remain plentiful.And we expect that Sumatra, with its relatively well-developedinfrastructure and nucleus of skilled labour
, will absorb 1.6
million hectares of this expansion. It is inevitable that mostnew oil palm will be in the wetlands, as the more 'desirable'dry lands of the island are now occupied.”© GREENPEACE/CHEDAR ANDERSON 


6 Forest destruction, climate change and palm oil expansion in IndonesiaApproximately 14 per cent of Indonesia peatlands are under
oil palm plantations, another 10 per cent are under timberplantations.  This does not take into account state-owned,cooperative or other agricultural developments.Approximately 12 per cent of Indonesia's peatlands are under
logging concessions
27. 
This is already a staggering level of peatland destruction and
to prevent further conversion of peatlands urgent action is
needed. 
The Social Impacts of Oil Palm Expansion
Palm oil expansion in Indonesia is not only wreaking havoc on
forests and peatlands, but in many cases it is also pushingindigenous and local communities off their land. In somecases, communities become trapped in a vicious cycle ofdebt, working their own land that has been converted to palmoil. 
Land on which palm oil companies wish to establish
plantations is often subject to existing claims by indigenousand local communities. Companies are required by law toconduct a process of consulting communities and gainingtheir consent to forego their rights to the land, for which theymust be compensated. However, communities are oftencheated out of their land and promises of compensation, andthe building of schools and medical clinics, ar e often not
fulfilled.  
The Indonesian-based NGO Sawit Watch has documented
numerous cases of communities having been deceived bypalm oil companies and dispossessed of their land and theirrights
29. 
Efforts to swindle local communities out of their land rightsinclude intimidation and outright cheating. Companies haveused the attendance lists at consultation or 'socialisation'meetings as 'evidence' to show that communities agreed tosign over their land use rights. 
Communities have also lost their forests because the land has
simply been bulldozed and cleared, either through bulldozerdrivers misinterpreting maps or through the use of incorr ect
maps
30. Many community members who have agreed to give up theirland to a company and to receive their few hectares of oilpalm plantation to manage themselves, end up in a debt trapcycle to the company that is impossible to break out of
31. 
What must happen?
The for ests of Indonesia are under siege from deforestation
for oil palm expansion, timber plantations and also from illegaland destructive logging, degrading forests and often aprecursor to deforestation.  This is driving climate change and
causing Indonesia to be one of the largest global greenhousegas polluters on the planet.
Indonesia is hosting the next Conference of the Parties to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,which will be held in Bali in December 2007.  
In the run up to this meeting Gr eenpeace wants the
Indonesian gover nment to immediately introduce a
moratorium on further destruction of peatlands, to implement
an effective action plan against forest fires and to support areduced defor estation scheme in the Papuan provinces.
Greenpeace is calling on the Indonesian Government toimplement a moratorium on deforestation and industriallogging in order to review its forest laws, address its poorrecord of governance and law enforcement and to implementan envir onmentally- responsible and socially-just land-use
planning system.
