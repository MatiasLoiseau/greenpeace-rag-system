GREENPEACE BRIEFING  
Donors Trust : The shadow operation that has laundered $146  million in climate -denial funding  
 
One year ago, in February 2012, internal documents from the Heartland Institute were revealed by a sting oper ation, 
leading to the discovery that Heartland had one significant “Anonymous Donor ” who accounted  for a vast majority of 
their funding revenue.  It was then discov ered that these checks were being routed through  two interlaced trusts  in 
Alexandria Virginia: Donors Trust  and Donors Capital Fund.  
 
Over the past year, Greenpeace and other researchers have  discovered that Donors Trust , a shadowy funding operation 
for an ti-government extremists,  is laundering  millions of dollars in climate denial funding  for donors who do not want to 
be associated with their pet causes . For the purposes of this report, any funding attributed to “ Donors Trust ” includes 
funding from both Donors Trust  and Donors Capital Fund. Donors Capital Fund is the sister organization to Donors Trust , 
with the same mission, same leadership, and same office address.  
 
Since the late 1990s, Greenpeace has tracked and exposed the funding to climate denial front groups from Big Oil  
donors , including ExxonMobil and the Koch brothers foundations.   As these funding connections have been revealed, the 
publicly traceable funding to these groups has slowly declined, while the overall revenue and budgets of these groups 
has increased in many cases.  This has coincided with a  sharp  increase in  anonymous  and untraceable funding for denial 
groups  through Donors Trust . 
  
Greenpeace defines “climate denial” organizations as those that have attempted to undermine and obstruct the 
scientific consensus around climate change or policy solutions to climate change , against the recommendations of the 
scientific community  that countries must act urgently  to reduce carbon pollution. Funding of these organizations is only 
disclosed on the  IRS 990 tax forms  of non -prof it foundations  without divulging individual donors, which means that a 
great deal of  corporate and industry giving is untraceable. The groups rarely publish their funders on their websites or in 
other publications.   
 
 
1. KEY FINDINGS  
 
 As traceable funding  from big oil ( Exxon and Koch ) to climate denial  front groups  has slowly declined  over the 
last few years, “anonymous” money from Donors Trust  has sharply increased.  
 Donors Trust  was created with the  intent of bolstering support to  climate denial and anti -government extremists 
while hiding the identity of m ajor funders, like Charles G. Koch  Foundation and the Koch’s  Knowledge and 
Progress Fund . 
 Donors Trust  and its associated organization, Don ors Capital Fund, have funded 102  climate -denial organizations 
since 2002.  
 From 2002 to 2011 , Donors Trust  and Donors  Capital Fund have provided $146  million to climate denial groups.  
 In 2010,  a dozen climate denial groups receive d between 30% to  70% of their funding from Donors Trust , 
including the Koch -founded Americans for Prosperity, as well as Committee for a Constr uctive Tomorrow 
(CFACT ) 
 Additional climate denial organizations that have received major funding in recent years by Donors Trust  include 
the Heartland Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute,  Cato Institute and the James Partnership (Cornwall 
Alliance) .  
 
 
 

2. DONORS TRUST: LAUNDERING DENIAL MONEY  
 
Donors Trust  collect s funds from wealthy ideological individuals , and redistributes the funding to extreme anti -
government , anti -regulation groups that fit the Donors Trust  criteria. The website states: “ Donors Trust  can administer 
and protect your charitable intent only if your philanthropic goals are consistent with the Trust's mission and purpose to 
advance liberty through limited government, personal responsibility, and free enterprise.”1 
 
Donors Trust  is the public facing organization , while its sister organization Donors Capital Fund exists to process 
donations over $1,000,000. Both organizations are led  by Whitney Ball and share the same office in a Washington DC 
suburb.  Donors Trust  and Donors Capi tal Fund offer total anonymity to  funders.  In addition, all money given to Donors 
Trust  and Donors Capital Fund is tax deductible because t hey are considered public charities , even though the money is 
anonymous and untraceable .  As seen in Figure 1, as Bi g Oil funding declined for climate denial, anonymous funding 
through Donors Trust  increased substantially, especially as the momentum for new climate policy action was building 
through the mid -2000s.  
 
 
 
 
In a 2005 interview , Whitney Ball explains the formation of Donors Trust2:  
 
“Charitable capital that i s held in a vehicle like a private foundation often drifts away from the in tent of 
its founding donor(s) over time. Donor intent seems  especially hard to maintain for donors who want 
to support a free society  as the founders understood it. So in 1999, a small group of donors active in 
this cause launched Donors Trust  to help like -minded donors. ”  
 
Setting up one’s own private foundation is not appealing since the money has to be disclosed on tax forms and linked to 
the funder. Donors Trust  gives ultra -conservative funders a vehicle to give to their extreme and controversial pet -causes 
without leaving fingerprints on the grants.

Figure 1: As traceable Big Oil funding for climate denial declined, anonymous and untraceable funding 
through Donors Trust sharply increased. The massive increase for climate denial groups in the mid -2000s 
coincides with momentum  of policy  action on climat e solutions.  

 
From the Donors Trust  FAQ web site 3 
 
How can I give anonymously and still receive a tax deduction?  
 
You wish to keep your charitable giving private, especially gifts funding sensitive or controversial issues. Know that any 
contributions to your Donors Trust  account that have to be reported to the IRS will not become public information. Unlike 
with privat e foundations, gifts from your account will remain as anonymous as you request . 
 
I need some administrative help to organize and distribute my charitable giving. Does Donors Trust  offer these services?  
 
You make annual gifts to a number of charities but are tired of writing checks and managing the IRS receipts. Write one 
check to Donors Trust  and receive one IRS receipt. From your account, request gifts to your favorite charities .  
 
 
 
3. KEY PLAYERS  
 
 Char les Koch  
Charles Koch  is CEO and Chairman of Koch Industries , a massive privately -held corporation with business areas in 
petroleum refining, fuel pipelines, chemical and polymer production, and forestry products. Charles Koch  is widely seen 
as a behind -the-scenes operative attempting to control the ultra -conservative movement in the United States. He is a 
co-founder of the Cato Institute, the Chairman of the Institute for Humane Studies, and has sponsored several secret 
political strategy conferences for anti-government extremists  including major  climate deniers.  He has donated $8 million 
of traceable money to Donors Trust  from 2006 -2010, and has included the Donors Trust  Executive Director  at his  invite -
only strategy  and fundraising meetings . 
 
 Whitney Ball 
Whitney Ball is the co -founder and executive director of Donors Trust  and is one of two paid board members of Donors 
Capital.  Ball has an extensive history with anti -government extremists and funders. She has worked as development 
director at the Cato  Institute, executive director of Philanthropy Roundtable, and she serves on the board of the State 
Policy Network.4 The Koch brothers have funded each of these organizations that are affiliated with Ball. She has also 
attended the Koch Brother strategy me etings for climate deniers and extreme conservatives.5 
 
 Steven Hayward  
Steven Hayward is a board member and treasurer of Donors Capital Fund.6  He comments frequently on environmental 
issues from a libertarian perspective, recently publishing The Almanac of Environmental Trends . He is a fellow at the 
Pacific Research Institute, and previously was a f ellow at the Ameri can Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and 
a contributing editor to Reason Magazine. The Koch brothers have funded each of these organizations.  
 
 In 2006, Hayward authored a letter offering $10,000 to scientists that could detail the “limitations of climate model 
outputs as they pertain to the development of climate policy.”7 While at AEI, Hayward contributed frequently to AEI’s 
Energy and Environment Outlook, and Hayward consistently downplays the urgency of climate change, and discourages 
policy action by claiming it is too costly. In a 2009 interview when asked about disappearing Arctic sea ice, he responded 
“Is this evidence that  something is happening? Yes. Is it dangerous? That is much less clear.” He also supported the idea 
of geoengineering (specifically injecting particles into the air to block sunlight) as an alternative to transitioning to low -
carbon technology.8 Steven Hay ward is also featured in the Cornwall Alliance’s climate denial video, “Resisting the Green 
Dragon.” Cornwall is a project of the James Partnership, which received 75% of its funding from Donors Trust  in 2010.

4. KEY TAKERS OF DONORS TRUST MONEY  
 
 Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)  
 
In 2011, CFACT received 40% of its budget from Donors Trust ($1.2 million). The previous year, CFACT received nearly 
half, $1.3 million totaling 45.5%,  from Donors Trust. This indicates that Donors Trust may b e keeping afloat one of the 
country’s most strident and misleading climate denial organizations. CFACT was originally founded to counter the 
environmental movement, and anti -environmental programs dominate its agenda today. According to the CFACT 
website:9 “In 1985, the Committee For a  Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) was founded to promote a positive voice on 
environment and development issues...Today, this Washington DC -based group...can be heard relentlessly infusing the 
environmental debate with a balanced  perspective on environmental stewardship. ” 
 
CFACT refuses to accept any scientific evidence, not to mention the consensus, that human activity is causing climate 
change. CFACT maintains an FAQ webpage that attempts to refute arguments that the vast majori ty of scientists say 
climate change is human -caused:10 
o “While some continue to insist that human ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions are causing potentially 
catastrophic changes in climate and weather, growing numbers of scientists say nature, not man, rules 
the cli mate.”  
o  “Today, the real danger is laws and policies implemented in a misplaced belief that humans can control 
or prevent climate change. These policies raise energy costs, kill jobs, and impose especially heavy 
burdens on poor families.”  
o “Regulating carbo n dioxide may be profitable for certain industries and governments, but will impose 
enormous costs on society – while having no effect on our weather and climate.”  
o The idea that there is a “scientific consensus” does not hold up. Scientists who are skeptic al about 
“dangerous man -made climate change” have been speaking out for years.11 
 
Marc Morano, the long -standing climate denier, currently serves as CFACT’s primary climate -denial spokesperson. The 
organization also sponsors and produces Morano’s website, C limateDepot.com.  Morano is frequently a “talking head” 
on cable television news, casting doubt on the scientific evidence of human influence on the climate. Recently on Fox 
News, Morano claimed, “[Climate change action] is now akin to medieval witchcraft,  where we used to blame witches 
for controlling the weather."12 
 
CFACT’s 2011 financial disclosure form shows that Morano is the most valued employee at CFACT, receiving the largest 
salary of $150,000 a year. Morano’s compensation is 40% more than both the Executive Director and the President’s 
salaries, whose compensation is roughly $105,000 annually. After Morano’s arrival at CFACT in 2009, CFACT’s revenue 
increased significantly, nearly doubling from 2008 to 2009.  
 
 
 Dr. Willie Soon  
 
Dr. Willie Soon is an aerospace engineer employed at the Harvard -Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, who is well -
known for accepting funds from oil and coal business interests. Greenpeace Freedom of Information Act inquiries to 
Smithsonian Institute reveal that in 2011 and 2 012, Dr. Soon  received nearly $115,000 from Donors Trust.13 Since 1994, 
Dr. Soon has received over $1.3 million from ExxonMobil, the Koch brothers, American Petroleum Institute, Texaco, 
Southern Company, Donors Trust and others.

13 https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/603297 -willie -soon -foia-response -grants -08-08-2012.html  

 
Even though Dr. Soon is not a trained climatologist and most of his work is not peer -reviewed, his work is still frequently 
cited by climate deniers. He has been affiliated with a number of climate denial organizations, including the Heartland 
Institute, George C. Marshall Instit ute, and Tech Central Station.14 Dr. Soon pretends to be a jack -of-all-trades when it 
comes to scientific expertise. He has published articles claiming that polar bears are not threatened by climate change, 
mercury from coal plants is not a public health th reat, and variability of the sun is responsible for Arctic changes.  
 
In addition to his organizational affiliations, Dr. Soon has conspired to weaken the scientific consensus on climate 
change. In a letter obtained by Greenpeace, Dr. Soon alerts his collea gues to an upcoming UN climate change report 
(IPCC  Fourth Assessment), and states “I hope we can start discussing to see what we can do to weaken the fourth 
assessment.” He also says “As A -team, we may give it our best shot to…counter some of the chapters ,” and “Even if we 
can tackle ONE single chapter forcefully and effectively, we will really accomplish A LOT!” 15 
 
 
 Heartland Institute  
 
The Heartland Institute received $14.5 million from  Donors Trust from 2002  to 2011 . A Chicago -based think tank, 
Heartland coordinates the largest conference of climate deniers every year, dubbed “Denial -palooza” by climate change 
advocates.16   Last year, the Heartland Institute was widely criticized for its “Unabomber billboard” campaign, which 
featured a picture of  Ted Kaczynski’s mugshot with the question “I still believe in global warming. Do you?”17 In 2012, 
leaked documents exposed dozens of Heartland’s big business funders, including donors from the oil, coal, and tobacco 
industries.  
 
 
 
 
The documents also revealed one “Anonymous Donor” that Heartland depends upon for a massive portion of its 
budget.18 In some years this Anonymous Donor provided over half of Heartland’s total revenue. From 2007 to 2011, the 
Anonymous Donor gave $8.6 million to the Heartland Institute specifically for “Global Warming Projects.” Climate 
change appears to be this donor’s pet issue, as th ese program -specific grants constitute more than half of the donor’s 
total funding to the Heartland Institute.

Figure 2: This table f rom the leaked “Heartland Fundraising Plan” shows funding from an Anonymous Donor from 
2007 to 2011. In some years, this donor has provided 60% of Heartland’s budget, and clearly considers global 
warming as a priority issue. The Anonymous donor appears to funnel the funds through Donors Trust to protect 
anonymity.  

By comparing the “Anonymous Donor” funding to the Donors Trust forms, the grant sizes from the two sources are 
nearly identical year to year. In  addition, in some years the grant sizes from each source is nearly 60% of Heartland’s 
budget. This indicates that at least some (and probably most) of the “Anonymous Donor” money is flowing through 
Donors Trust.  
 
 
 
 
 Americans for Prosperity (AFP)  
 
In 2010 , Americans for Prosperity Foundation (AFP) received $7.7 million from Donors Trust, making up 44% of the AFP 
Foundation ’s annual revenue. The secretive oil billionaire David Koch is the founder and chairman of Americans for 
Prosperity, as well as a major funder.  
 
AFP is a major astroturf orga nization that aims to give the appearance of grassroots support to positions that favor the 
oil industry, coal companies and other entrenched business interests. AFP has dozens of state chapters and organizes 
tea party events. During the fiscal cliff discu ssions at the end of 2012, AFP staunchly opposed the production tax credit 
for wind power, claiming that “ politically -connected groups like the wind industry are getting special tax treatment. ”19  
In September 2012, AFP opposed new EPA protections to reduce  carbon pollution from power plants, stating that 
“Individuals all across this country, from electric utility consumers to coal miners, understand the importance of coal in 
our lives. ”20 
 
From 2008 to 2010, AFP hosted the “Hot Air Tour” as a nationwide campaign against climate change action, hosting 
events in 40 cities with a hot air balloon. The slogan of the tour was “Global Warming Alarmism: Lost jobs, Higher taxes, 
Less freedom.”21  AFP also hosted “Hot Air Tour” events during the UN climate conferences in Copenhagen in 2009 and 
Cancun in 2010.22 AFP attacked President Obama in its invite to the Copenhagen Hot Air Tour, claiming: “No doubt, the 
President intends to commit the United States  to an energy rationing scheme that makes the U.S. accountable to U.N. 
bureaucrats, kills jobs here, dramatically raises the price of gasoline and electricity, and infringes on our personal and 
national freedoms.” 23

Figure 3: Grants from the Anonymous donor and the Heartland Institute are nearly identical. In addition, the amounts are a la rge 
share of Heartland’s total revenue – in some years, adding the two is more than 100% of Heartlands funding, illustrating that t he 
Anonymous Donor is using Donors Trust to hide his identity for some, if not all, of the anonymous grants.  
 

The Americans for Prosperity Foundation  and its state chapters are also associate members of the State Policy Network 
(SPN), an affiliation of conservative state -based groups that attack climate action. SPN and many of its members receive 
direct funding from Donors Trust.
