Product of an opportune initiative from Greenpeace, this work is

above all a manifest of unity and consensus. We must protect this

environment for our own well-being and that of everyone else, and

we should respect it for no other reason than its own singularity.

The protection of the Gulf of California is the most important task

in favor of our own survival, for many generations. It is a task that

will last many, many years. That is why it is so urgent.

ocean and land.

Few places on earth represent such dramatic environmental

contrasts as can be found in this region. For the past six million

years the Sea of Cortez has maintained this long and arid

peninsula of Baja California separate from the rest of the Mexican

territory, which at the same time has kept the Sea of Cortez locked

in within its own depths and apart from the Pacific Ocean.

All around, the central theme is the evolutionary isolation that

generates unique and extraordinary species, and the insularities

that harbor astonishing forms. In this scenery, where land and sea

embrace each other, isolation and biological evolution are the

cause and engine of this immense natural richness. Islands and

bays, sea mountains and estuaries, reefs and lagoons, they all keep

the genetic secrets of its founding life forms in its isolated

landscapes, and the evolutionary memories of the species that

provided their origins.

For six million years these plants and these animals evolved

without the presence of modern human beings until they formed a

spectacular collection of biological species. Since the peninsula’s

separation from continental Mexico, this collection of living beings

has remained there, evolving and surviving, with adaptations ever

more incredible and wonderful, with a rich diversity of forms. The

Gulf and the deserts surrounding it regulate the climate, maintain

the fisheries, feed our richest agricultural valleys, and with their

spectacular beauty, feed and nourish our dreams and culture as

well. If we left them alone, the desert and sea would survive

without us, but we would not survive without them.

1 :: The Gulf of California

The Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, harbors

great biological richness with highly productive waters. It is

among the five most productive and biologically diverse marine

ecosystems of the world. It is approximately 1,000 Km long and

150 Km wide (Álvarez-Borrego, 1983) and covers an area of

278,000 Km2. Five states surround this sea: Sonora, Sinaloa,

Nayarit, Baja California, and Baja California Sur (Morgan et al.,

2005) (Fig. 1).

The coastline of the gulf is irregular and includes a great number

of coastal bays and lagoons. The northern portion is dominated by

the Colorado River delta, resulting in a unique ecosystem. The

eastern coast of the gulf has a series of rivers that originate in the

chain of mountains running through Sonora and Sinaloa. These

rivers deliver water and sediments to the enclosed sea, however

there are no rivers on the peninsula side due to the dry conditions

of the region. The sea floor is characterized by underwater canyons

and depressions that, in some places, are over 3 kilometers deep.

These underwater canyons form a series of depressions that

increase in depth towards the mouth of the gulf.

1.1 Biological richness and diversity

The Gulf of California region is recognized worldwide for its

biological richness, high number of unique species, productive

waters and scenic beauty. This region includes 23 priority areas for

marine biodiversity, 42 areas of priority for terrestrial biodiversity

and 62 priority areas for the conservation of birds, all described

and identified by National Commission on knowledge and use of

biodiversity (CONABIO for its initials in Spanish) (Enríquez-

Andrade et al., 2005). This high biodiversity can be explained

through two phenomena: (i) the wide variety of habitats including

mangrove forests, coastal lagoons, rocky and coral reefs,

hydrothermal vents and other shallow and deep marine habitats;

and (ii) the geology and oceanographic conditions of the region

(Ezcurra, 1998; Carvajal el at., 2004). There are 887 species of

plants and animals living on the 922 islands of the gulf, including

90 endemic species. Sixty of these are reptiles, placing Mexico

second in the world in terms of the number of endemic reptiles

(CSGC, 2004).

species of fish and 77 are endemic (CSGC, 2004; Enríquez-

Andrade et al., 2005). Of the 271 reef species known in the Sea of

Cortez, 52 are endemic (Ezcurra, 1998). The Totoaba (Cynoscion

macdonaldi) is endemic to the upper gulf and is endangered. Five

of the eight species of sea turtles can be found in the region, and

all five species are categorized as endangered on the IUCN red list.

The Gulf of California is considered a very important area for the

feeding, reproduction and migration of these species (CSGC,

2004). The five species of sea turtles found here are: the

loggerhead (Caretta caretta), the Pacific green (Chelonia mydas

agassizi), the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the hawksbill

(Eretmochelys imbricada), and the olive ridley (Lepidochelys

olivacea).

In the case of the Pacific green turtle, it uses the coastal lagoons

and bays of Baja California, Sinaloa and Sonora as feeding

grounds and can be commonly found around the Midriff Islands.

The leatherback is considered to be critically endangered and has

several nesting grounds in the southern portion of Baja California

Sur. The loggerhead and hawksbill turtles feed in waters off this

state, and the olive ridley nests in the southern portion of the

peninsula (CSGC, 2004; Morgan et al., 2005).

(Ezcurra, 1998; Enríquez-Andrade et al., 2005; Morgan et al.,

2005). There are also around 40 colonies of California sea lions

(Zalophus californianus) forming a population of approximately

30,000 individuals (Enríquez-Andrade et al., 2005). The blue

whale (Balaenoptera musculus), listed as endangered by the IUCN,

arrives to the gulf from Alaska after the feeding season; while the

humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) uses the area as

reproduction grounds (Morgan et al., 2005).

1.2 Cultural importance

The historical and cultural importance of the peninsula of Baja

California has been recognized by specialists around the world.

Even though studies of the indigenous cultures of the peninsula

began in the late 19th century, the last 70 years have seen the

most scientific activity focused on the region (Reygadas-Dahl,

2003). There are a great number of cave paintings, encompassing

a variety of styles, on the peninsula. The most famous of these are

the great mural style paintings found in the central region of the

peninsula on the San Borja, San Juan, San Francisco, and

Guadalupe Sierras (Hambleton, 2003). It is also worth mentioning

that many archaeological remains have been found belonging to

1.3 Socioeconomic importance

There are approximately 8.6 million people living in the Gulf of

California region, and this number is expected to rise to 10.4

million by the year 2010. Population density is considered to be

low now; however this entire region is attracting people from

different places at a fast rate. This can be seen through the

population growth rates which are higher than the average national

growth rate (CSGC, 2004). Between 1990 and 2000 Mexico had

an annual population growth rate of 1.9%, while the gulf region

had a growth rate of 2.4%. Baja California, Baja California Sur,

The fishing industries create employment for more than 50,000

people and have resulted in the construction of around 250

processing plants. There are nearly 26,000 boats dedicated to

fishing in the Gulf of California. Among them are 72% of the

national tuna fishing fleet, and almost all of them fish sardine as

well. Also, 52% of the total number of boats dedicated to shrimp

fishing in the country work in this region as well.

Sonora, Sinaloa and Nayarit produce 40% of the national

agricultural products (Enríquez-Andrade et al., 2005). These four

states dedicate 1.5 million hectares of land (40% of the total

national agricultural land) to agricultural production (CSGC,

2004).

is estimated that 4.8 million tourists (8% of the national total)

visit this region annually and spend approximately 2 billion dollars.

activities (Robadue, 2002; CSGC, 2004; Enríquez-Andrade et al.,

can be observed in coastal municipalities, and it is those

municipalities where the pressure on resources is highest

(CSGC, 2004).

The abundant natural resources and the economic activity have

created new investment opportunities that encourage regional

economic growth. The cities and ports of the region have become

specialized in the primary and tertiary sectors, transforming the

Gulf of California region into one of the regions with the highest

per capita incomes in Mexico. The region is important for the

production and export of primary products (agriculture, cattle,

fishing and mining). In total the Gulf of California is responsible

for 10% of the total gross national product (GNP). The fishing

and agricultural sectors contribute 17%, with Sonora and Sinaloa

as the main producers (CSGC, 2004)

2 :: Threats in the Gulf of California

The natural ecosystems in the Gulf of California region have been

1970’s, but were considered rare by the year 2000 (Sala et al.,

potentially have negative impacts on local communities because

they depend directly on the availability of natural resources for

their wellbeing.

2.1 Overfishing and aquaculture

For many years, the artisanal fisheries in the region were

sustainable. As fish populations have decreased, fishermen have

changed fishing techniques in search of those that maximize their

efforts. High extraction rates and the use of gill nets, trawling

techniques and longlines have all played a role in the rapid

reduction of fish populations, therefore risking the sustainability of

this activity (Ezcurra, 1998; Morgan et al., 2005).

As fish populations decrease the community structure begins to

change because as one species disappears or becomes rare, others

take their place in the community (Morgan et al., 2005). Studies

have demonstrated that the abundance and density of some species

of commercial value have decreased in the last 30 years as a result

of the increase in fishing effort (Sala et al., 2004; COBI, 2005).

However, this phenomenon is not easy to detect with the types of

data used by the state and federal governments because these

group various species into broad multi-species categories such as

“groupers” or “sharks”. When these data are separated by

species, then the effects of overfishing become apparent. The

disappearance of large predatory species (sharks and large

groupers) is evident, as is the substitution of these species by

species of smaller size from lower down in the food chain

(herbivores).

The shrimp fishery also poses a major threat to the ecology of the

region because 90% of total catch is discarded as bycatch

(Excurra, 1998; Morgan et al., 2005). In the Gulf of California

shrimp fishery bycatch is made up of more than 100 fish species

and between 85 and 114 species of invertebrates. Among the non-

target species is the Totoaba, who is especially vulnerable during its

juvenile stage when it is caught during trawling (García-Caudillo et

al., 2000). It is estimated that every year 200,000 tons of bycatch

are returned to the sea, while only 30,000 tons of shrimp are

caught (Carvajal et al., 2004).

Agriculture no longer expands towards the large inland valleys but,

through aquaculture, it expands to occupy salt marshes, coastal

lagoons, and estuaries. It mostly is dedicated to shrimp farming,

and the construction of these farms has resulted in coastal

modifications. This modification has resulted in a loss of habitat

that affects many species, not only the species that live

permanently on these habitats. Many marine species, like fish, use

these habitats as nursery grounds or during other stages in their

life cycle. Aquaculture also creates conflicts with agriculture

because it needs great amounts of water; and with conservationists

because it affects water quality and the state of coastal habitats

located near and around the farms (Robles et al., 1980).

2.2 Pollution

Urban water discharge causes environmental damage to coastal

areas. Guaymas is a shocking example of a coastal city where

pollution problems in the bay have reached extreme levels (Ortiz-

An example of a collapsed fishery in the Gulf of California is that

Agricultural runoff has also become a major source of pollution in

the Gulf of California region. Pollutants are carried toward the

gulf from the United States and from Sonora and Sinaloa. The

coasts of Sonora and Sinaloa are among the most productive in

terms of agriculture in Mexico. This activity is causing damage to

marine and coastal ecosystems because of the chemicals used. By

the 1950’s this type of pollution had already impacted the pelican

population on the islands of Salsipuedes, Las Animas and San

Lorenzo.

Shrimp farms are also sources of pollution because their residual

waters are often discharged directly into the natural environment.

Around 70% of the aquaculture infrastructure of the entire

country is located in the state of Sinaloa, which means that its

coastal areas, in particular lagoons, are constantly receiving large

amounts of water enriched with nutrients (Ortiz-Lozano et al.,

2005). This can cause the lagoons to become eutrophic zones

where algal blooms are frequent and the possibility of the

formation of dead zones is high.

2.3 Loss of habitat

The coastline is a narrow fringe where the ocean and land interact,

and where drastic modifications take place as a result of human

activities. These changes begin from the moment human activity

begins and changes in the natural environment start to happen.

The Gulf of California is not exempt from this phenomenon, and

there are plenty of examples of cases where economic activities are

in conflict with the well being of marine and coastal ecosystems.

Estuary and coastal lagoon ecosystems are threatened by the

construction of industries and tourist developments. The

deterioration of these types of habitats affects a great number of

marine species including shrimp, mollusks and fish. These

developments are also likely to have negative impacts on the

migratory bird species that use them as feeding or resting areas

during their migration (Ezcurra, 1998). Los Cabos and Mazatlan,

considered two of the most important tourist destinations in the

country, are also among the places that have suffered severe

disturbance (Ortiz-Lozano et al., 2005) as a result of the

development that has taken place in order to satisfy the demands

of the tourist industry.

have been significant habitat changes caused by the reduction in

the amount of fresh water reaching the gulf and resulting in an

increase in salinity levels in the water and the disappearance of

wetland vegetation. In the last 100 years the river’s water has

been used to irrigate agricultural land and for other human uses.

Wetland areas have varied between 5,800 and 63,000 hectares

from 1973 to1993 (Glenn et al., 1996). This wetland habitat is

important for threatened species like the desert pupfish

(Cyprinodon macularis) and the Yuma clapper rail (Rallus

longirostris yumanensis). The decrease in the amount of water

reaching the gulf has also caused a change in the natural

conditions in what used to be an estuary-like habitat important for

fish reproduction (Morgan et al., 2005). Changes in salinity

attributed to the water quality of the Colorado River have been

recorded on the northern portion of the gulf (INE, 1994) the area

where the Totoaba and Vaquita, both endangered, can be found.

Mangroves are disappearing at a rate of 2.5% annually on a

national level (INE, 2005). The cause for this degradation varies

depending on the area where the mangrove is, but sedimentation,

eutrophication, deforestation and changes in local hydrology may

have negative impacts on the mangrove forests. In many cases,

mangrove forests are cut down in order to clear space to build

shrimp farms or tourism developments. Water flow is very

important for the development and health of mangrove forests, and

it changes when coastal areas are modified by the construction of

shrimp farms, marinas and channels (Conservation International,

www.conservation.org.mx).

Tourism can also have a negative impact on the natural resources

on which it depends. Infrastructure built to satisfy the needs of

national and international tourists causes environmental damage

through the modification and destruction of natural habitats, water

consumption, and sewer discharges. Highly developed areas like

Quintana Roo have attracted the attention of conservationists and

the community as a whole due to the severe ecosystem destruction

that is tourism-related. In the Gulf of California, tourism

destinations like Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas are described as

places where “extreme” changes of the natural environment have

taken place (Ortiz-Lozano et al., 2005).

Ecotourism has also had its impacts on some ecosystems,

especially those located on and around islands which are

considered to be the most vulnerable and fragile of all. Due to its

isolation, evolutionary processes have transformed the islands of

the Gulf of California into ecosystems that are highly vulnerable to

the ecological impacts caused by the introduction of exotic species,

habitat deterioration, hunting and fishing. Studies done in the last

years have shown that introduced species, like rats, cats and goats,

can cause devastating damage to native plant, bird and reptile

populations (Ezcurra, 1998).

3 :: Marine Reserves, a special type of Natural Protected Area

Marine Protected Area (MPA), is a term that is becoming

3.1 Benefits of Marine Reserves

increasingly common in the context of biodiversity conservation,

habitat protection and fisheries management. The term covers a

wide range of protection measures, with an equally wide variation

in the benefits conferred by this status. MPAs can be created for

many purposes, ranging from the protection of a species to a whole

habitat or ecosystem, to the protection of certain interests, such as

small scale or recreational fishing. Marine reserves are the type of

MPA that offer the highest level of protection and are closed to all

extractive and disposal activities.

In the last decade, marine reserves have become a favored

conservation tool of many conservationists and of the scientific

community (Allison et al., 1998). This is because reserves offer

new and stricter ways to protect ecosystems that cannot be

implemented otherwise, such as providing full protection for critical

habitats and the species that live in those habitats. In addition to

protecting the ecosystem in its entirety, marine reserves can also

bring benefits to the fisheries in the surrounding waters and thus

help to avoid overfishing.

In Mexico, a natural protected area (NPA) is an area of ocean or

land representative of a particular ecosystem and its associated

biodiversity, which has not suffered any significant changes caused

by humans and where special protection, conservation, restoration

and development regimes are implemented (SEMARNAT, 2000).

Mexican NPAs used to be created based on laws that applied to

the logging, fishing and hunting sectors. On January 28, 1988, a

new law, the General Act for Ecological Balance and the

Protection of the Environment (LGEEPA for its initials in

Spanish), was established and since then NPAs are created under a

different set of laws. On November 30, 2000, the federal

government published a set of regulations that allowed the creation

and implementation of specific conservation measures in protected

areas. One such example is the prohibition of fishing activities

when the volume of bycatch is larger than the volume of the target

species (Bezaury-Creel, 2004).

In order to adequately protect the wide range of marine species

and habitats found in Mexican waters, Mexico must further develop

its NPA system, with a network of fully-protected marine reserves

providing the backbone.

Marine reserves are a conservation tool that can bring benefits to

the fishing industry, recreational activities and other activities that

use, directly or indirectly, marine resources (Allison et al., 1998;

Gell and Roberts, 2003). Recent studies show that reserves can

help increase biomass, abundance, and diversity of species that live

in them. Average biomass can be more than four times greater

inside a reserve than in an area that is not protected. Density and

species richness can be double within a reserve than outside one;

and average size of individuals can also be larger (Gell and

Roberts, 2003; PISCO, 2002).

These changes have been observed in species that are commercially

important as well as on those that are not. Protection from fishing

activity allows organisms to live longer and thus, reach larger sizes.

Furthermore, degraded habitats located inside a reserve will be

allowed to recover and become able to support a higher number of

organisms. This results in more species that will serve as prey for

more species that are predators, until the complexity of the food

chain is restored. Marine reserves are the only conservation tool

used today that yields a cascading series of events that promote the

entire ecosystem’s wellbeing (PISCO, 2002).

Marine reserves not only bring benefits to populations living inside

them, but also can affect populations of species living around them.

This overflow of individuals can help maintain and restore

populations outside of the reserves. In the case of fish, some

individuals will leave the reserves to find places with lower

densities and, therefore, less competition for resources. The

overflow rate of larvae, juvenile and adults increases as time passes

resulting in population growth. There are some cases in which

species only spend a stage of their life cycle in the reserve, and

then move to other place to occupy other habitats (PISCO, 2002).

The benefits resulting from a reserve are easier to see on species

that spend their entire lives inside them. However, marine reserves

can also help protect migratory species (such as tuna, marlin,

cetaceans, birds) if they are designed adequately (PISCO, 2002).

Despite the long range of movements that these species have, entire

populations are highly vulnerable to fishing or other human

activities when they aggregate in specific areas to reproduce or

feed, or in migratory corridors, or in areas suitable as nursery

1 0 |   A   M A R I N E   R E S E R V E   N E T W O R K   F O R  T H E   G U L F   O F   C A L I F O R N I A

grounds. In the case of many fish species, these aggregations take

place in the same areas every year making it easier for fishermen

to capture them, and thus harvest a large portion of the population

in a short period of time (Sala et al., 2003).

If a reserve is established in a critical or key area it can help

protect a migratory species of special interest during a stage in

which it is vulnerable. For example, protecting nursery habitats of

commercially important species can result in an increase of the

adult population, which in many cases live in other areas (PISCO,

2002).

3.2 Principles for designing marine reserves

If a marine reserve’s main objective is to restore and protect

biodiversity of an area while promoting sustainable fishing

practices, then there are several criteria that can be used to

analyze different areas and thus come up with a several scenarios

for a marine reserve network (Table I). There are models that can

be used to help analyze these criteria and the different options, and

they hold the benefit of being flexible enough to satisfy every

community’s needs (PISCO, 2002).

There is a wide variety of habitats in the ocean, and each one

supports communities of plants and other organisms. The

importance of protecting different habitats lies in that there is

connectivity among all habitats. For example, estuaries and

lagoons are nursery habitats for many species of fish. These are

places with high productivity, and so the organic matter produced

here works as a natural fertilizer on other coastal environments

when it is carried out by currents and the tide. Also, these habitats

trap sediments carried by runoff and prevent it from covering other

habitats like rocky and coral reefs.

As mentioned above, many species use different habitats during

their lifetime. In the Gulf of California there are many fish species

that as adults live on rocky reefs, but the larvae travel with the

currents and the juvenile forms are found in coastal lagoons or

mangrove forests. As these juveniles grow, they move away from

coastal habitats until they reach the rocky reefs once they reach

their adult stage. The ocean is filled with species with very

different needs, and this is why all types of habitats are important.

In order to support and protect this biodiversity, it is necessary to

protect parts of each habitat present in a region (Sala et al.,

2002).

the establishment of large marine reserves. However, a network of

reserves can be designed and it can achieve its conservation

objectives without compromising the economic wellbeing of local

communities. This network can include reserves of different sizes

guaranteeing connectivity between reserves through the movement

of organisms. When reserves include different sizes and are

located at different distances from each other we can ensure the

protection of species with different needs and characteristics. For

example, a network of marine reserves can include feeding grounds

in oceanic habitats and also reproduction and/or breeding grounds

in shallow or coastal habitats.

To ensure that a marine reserve or network of marine reserves

meets its objectives it is absolutely crucial that all stakeholders,

including resource management specialists, government agencies,

biologists, sociologists, commercial and recreational fishermen,

conservationists and community members are included in the

planning process from its inception so as to create the optimal

marine reserve network. If a reserve, or a network of reserves, is

not designed properly then it will not meet its conservation

objectives successfully.

marine reserves that covers 40% of the world’s oceans in order to

marine BIAs and 20 terrestrial BIAs that together covered a large

portion of marine, coastal and terrestrial critical habitats of the

important species. Rocky areas along the Gulf’s coastline were

divided into 69 planning units and using an algorithm model a

to improve marine and coastal management, Comunidad y

Biodiversidad (COBI) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) teamed

up to develop a new exercise to identify priority areas in the Gulf of

California (Ulloa et al., 2006). Even though it is not the first to

gather regional information, this exercise is important because it is

entirely based on spatial information relating to the distribution

and diversity of species, natural communities, and ecological

systems in the region. The main outcome of this exercise is the

identification of 54 priority areas, more than the number identified

in other exercises - a result of using fine scale data. These priority

areas cover 24% of the Gulf of California waters, exceeding the

communities living in or near the NPA and that use the natural

resources found there, and by social organizations.

In order to

achieve sustainability collective efforts need to take place,

communities need to organize, suitable discussion forums need to

be available, and economic and political power need to be balanced

out (Andrade and Ortiz, 2004).

Community management is not a new concept; many ancient

communities that had fishing and farming traditions managed their

resources in a way that caused little damage and based this

management in knowledge of the environment (Negrete and Bocco,

2003). Through community management it is possible to take into

account wider environmental concerns beyond those relating to a

single fishery which will allow the maintenance of the natural

structure and function of the ecosystems and their productivity.

Ecosystems are dynamic and are constantly changing so their

management should be based on ongoing monitoring programs that

keep track of all elements. Community management is a process

that evolves and as such keeps identifying new objectives and

elevating standards. As a result, community participation will also

evolve to meet these goals.

Marine reserve and NPA management must be based in equality

and social fairness, sustainable use of resources and initiatives

proposed or led by the local community itself. In order for this

management to be successful, particular values, interests and

worries of every participating person or party need to be

acknowledged. Transparency and equity are important and need to

be present during negotiations, especially those regarding resource

use. Community members need to be allowed to assume ever more

important roles and responsibilities in this process. All sectors

have unique skills that are valuable and useful and that

complement each other if they decide to work together. It is also

extremely important to clearly establish the relationship between

the rights and responsibilities of each party involved in any

resource’s management.

6.1 Ensuring Community Involvement

To be effective, MPAs and marine reserves should be managed by

local communities rather than imposed and enforced by centralized

and bureaucratic agencies. To help with this, access to resources

may be assigned through permits, area concessions, quotas or, in

the case of fishing, caps on catch volumes. The advantage of these

types of management tools is that they identify the rights and

obligations associated to the use or one or several resources. Also

regulations can be devised that place obligations on communities to

ensure that their activities are sustainable. This creates an

incentive for communities to gain the organizational capacity and

the political action that allows the development of conservation

strategies.

Implementation of these kinds of scheme may run into problems

due to lack of financial investment. Local users usually hold great

amounts of knowledge of the area and its resources; however they

have limited possibilities of investment lowering expectations of this

type of conservation tool. The challenge is in designing a system

that meets the community’s needs, in other words, something that

allows for the community’s quality of life to improve over time.

Many areas within the Gulf of California are beginning to show

problems caused by population growth and competition for local

resources. The way in which these resources have been managed

has created a sense of insecurity among local users, who often

cannot compete against the advantages that foreign users have

over them. Protecting coastal communities’ access to marine

resources as a means to help implement MPAs, will enable these

communities to benefit from the resources for longer periods of

time. This will create an incentive for them to strive for

sustainability in the use of those resources. Economic growth and

long term sustainability for all sectors affected by an MPA must be

a focus point in management programs.

An example of this type of problem is what goes on in Bahia de

Los Angeles, in Baja California, where trips to see and swim with

whale sharks have become very popular (Box 1). However, the

local community has not seen an improvement in their quality of

6.2 Identity

It is important for MPAs to be considered areas where natural

resources interact with social factors resulting in an identity that

includes the relationship of a community with the natural

environment (Andrade and Ortiz, 2004). To achieve this it is

necessary to identify all sectors affected by the establishment of an

MPA. This means all individuals that directly or indirectly use the

natural resources in a MPA, including individuals from the fishery

or tourism sectors, as well as community members.

Individuals and entire communities use the natural resources

surrounding them in different ways, and there are social, economic

and cultural factors that determine the way in which these

resources are perceived by these individuals. Indirectly, this causes

individuals to place a value on ecosystems and species. These

values can have serious implications on the way resources are

managed.

The way resources are perceived usually differs among

communities, and respect for nature and community solidarity are

two key values that need to be kept in mind while establishing an

MPA and developing its management program. If MPAs that are

in the process of being established, and those that already are, do

not take into account the community’s perceptions, values, and

interests with respect to the natural resources, then they risk

failure (Cinner and Pollnac, 2004; Toledo, 2005).

The main objective is to identify the natural resources that

represent the interaction of the local community with the MPA

(Box 2). This means that species and ecosystems that give meaning

to the relationship of individuals with the environment need to be

identified, as well as the value of each one, threats and diagnosis

for its immediate future. Only this way can we “value” its loss,

recovery, or conservation for future generations (Fagetti and

Olivera, 2003).

Furthermore, preserving local identity can result in the creation of

job opportunities. Community members hold advantages over

government officials for doing certain activities like enforcement

and monitoring. Since local communities depend on the availability

of resources, it is to their advantage to protect an area and its

resources. And so, it is necessary to have economic management

schemes that create incentives for the monitoring and evaluation of

the health of the resources.

be considered a priority. Development programs should always

place priority on the local community before any outside parties or

sectors experience economic benefits (Andrade and Ortiz, 2004).

It is also important to recognize that economic, social and cultural

interests are fundamental aspects of any management plan.

increases, the resources needed by the other decrease thus

jeopardizing its future. It is crucial to find a balance between

interests and this can be achieved through dialogue and the use

of legal mechanisms that allow fair access to resources.

Resource extraction inside marine protected areas is considered in

the administration plans because it represents a source of food,

jobs, recreation, and economic wellbeing to local communities and

visitors. However, it is essential that resource extraction is done

through responsible measures (FAO, 1995). While federal, state,

and municipal fishing regulations should be followed inside MPAs,

it is necessary to apply regulations regarding the next three

concepts:

6.4 Creating marine reserves

Due to the overexploitation of many resources and the collapse of

the fisheries that depended on those resources, it is clear that

fishery regulations on their own are not enough to restore

populations to sustainable levels. The creation of marine reserves,

where all extractive activities are prohibited, has become a popular

measure in many parts of the world in order to let target species

populations recover. These no-take zones should be big enough to

allow for resources to recover without compromising the wellbeing

of those who depend on the extraction of the resources that are

looking to be protected. These types of conservation strategies

have begun to be implemented in the Gulf of California by NGO’s

like COBI (Box 3).

Closing an area to a particular activity can be difficult since many

people may depend on that very activity. While we do not

recommend converting all marine protected areas, or those that

need to be protected, into marine reserves it is important that

MPAs include marine reserves (no-take zones) where no fishing is

allowed. Marine reserves will therefore be a core component of

wider MPA network and will work together to achieve their

conservation goals.

6.5 Protection of critical habitats

A critical habitat is a place that is used for reproduction, feeding

and as nursery grounds by many species, including some of

economic importance like snappers, groupers, lobsters, and shrimp.

Recognizing the importance of these habitats is crucial in fishery

sustainability because the survival of commercially targeted schools

depends on the availability and health of these habitats. If these

habitats are altered, either by pollution, natural causes or human

related causes, then their productivity will decrease.

It is very important to determine the distribution of critical

habitats like mangroves, seagrass beds, macroalgae beds, reefs and

seamounts. Management plans for established MPAs have an

inventory of species; however they lack maps detailing habitat

distribution and ecosystem diversity. It is time to dedicate our

efforts to generating this type of information because by providing

a spatial representation of biological and physical information we

will better understand the dynamics that take place at an

ecosystem level (Box 4).

Each MPA, and therefore all reserves, need to have its own set of

maps developed that include the species present in the area, the

efforts as well as specific actions directed to each individual MPA.

While a regional approach is necessary to guarantee sustainability

of the entire region, it is equally important to have a more local

vision that helps identify and tackle problems from the roots,

problems that in many cases are very site specific.

6.6 Coastal and reef habitat restoration

The effects that human activities have on ecosystems have

compromised their recovery in the short and long term. Dredging

and removal of structural species (e.g. mangroves, macroalgae,

corals, and molluscs) have modified the natural environment and

have had cascading effects on the entire community. When a

community becomes unstable with low probability of recovering,

restoration programs need to be put in place.

Historical information on these habitats needs to be gathered, and

species need to be reintroduced in accordance to their natural and

historical distributions. Regulation of human activities needs to be

implemented and a monitoring program established to evaluate the

restoration process. This information can be used not only to

restore habitats, but also to identify the cause of the deterioration,

as well as the modifications needed to eliminate this negative

impact.

6.7 Transparency and activity reports

Marine protected areas should promote collective efforts like

commissions and associations (fishermen, hotels, transportation,

ecotourism, among others), as well as support the cooperation

between public and private sectors. They should promote the

formation of development agents that identify, organize, and help

community members, and in order to achieve this, the government’s

political will is fundamental (Fagetti and Olivera, 2003).

For some time now, the Mexican government has implemented

programs that help structure a planning process that involves

society as a whole, and in which knowledge and technology can be

incorporated in the search for better use of natural resources

(Negrete and Bocco, 2003). Therefore, it is essential to strengthen

existing groups like the Sustainable Development Councils, the

Natural Protected Areas Technical Councils, and others that also

work to develop society’s participation like the Rural participation

evaluation group (ERP), the Rapid rural diagnostic group (Negrete

6.8 Conservation in an economic context

Mexican natural protected areas are under management schemes

controlled by the state, with a hierarchical government, and highly

structured markets. The people using those areas do not have any

incentives to strive for the area’s sustainability, and instead look to

gain the most economic support possible from the public

administration. This leads to the exploitation of resources at levels

which are not sustainable on the long run. Overexploitation is the

result of a failure to control extraction activities.

Recognizing that “biological conservation is not simply a biological

matter” allows the creation of a new perspective on MPAs and

marine reserves, which from a biological point of view are

necessary to protect biodiversity but are certainly not enough

(Toledo, 2005). To make MPAs economically feasible we must

perceive them as productive units that generate vital benefits to

society that need to be recognized and valued, and that their

management is subject to investments that cover its operational

costs (INE, 1995).

The Gulf of California has great potential for local development

based on its natural and cultural resources. This development can

be achieved through the legal framework of marine protected areas

and marine reserves, using them as conservation tools to protect

natural resources, but also as attractors and market opportunities.

Regulated development of small-scale fisheries in the waters

surrounding a marine reserve or inside an MPA and the use of

commercially efficient marketing methods with certified labeling

are also conservation tools that promote sustainable development.

These strategies can link the revival of traditions and customs with

the development of new roles that are not well known such as

tourist guides, environmental educators, or park rangers (Fagetti

and Olivera, 2003).

7 :: Conclusions

l The Gulf of California is a biologically diverse and culturally rich
region. The great number of unique species and the variety of

habitats make it a region of great conservation importance.

l Local communities have a close relationship with natural
resources and the region’s development is based on the

availability of those resources. It is crucial that the region has

management and conservation plans that ensure sustainability

while promoting economic development.

l Conservation efforts in the Gulf of California Region have yielded
promising results, however there is still a lot more to be done.

Several groups have already identified the areas of conservation

importance as well as threats and those areas where pressure on

natural resources is greatest.

l Some of the areas considered of conservation importance have
been declared NPAs, while some other are in the process of

obtaining this status. Efforts should focus on obtaining NPA

status on areas that are not protected but are considered to be

important. This will result in the creation of a marine protected

area/marine reserve network for the Gulf of California.

l The management of this MPA network needs to have a regional
perspective because of the connectivity between MPAs and

resources. The administration of each MPA should be a

community management and through properties such as

community access to resources, identity, administrative equity,

transparency and activity reports, the region’s sustainability can

be achieved.

l Important elements of the MPA network are the marine reserves
that need to be established within each MPA. Marine reserves

will bring benefits not only to the fishing industry, but to other

important industries like tourism because there will be an

improvement in the health of the marine environment. A fully

protected marine reserve network within a wider MPA system

will allow the recovery of natural ecosystems through stricter

regulations including the prohibition of all extractive activities.
