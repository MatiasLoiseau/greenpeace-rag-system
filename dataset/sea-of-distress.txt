2017, Greenpeace’s
second assessment of foodservice companies that feed millions of people every
day who dine outside the home.
Unfamiliar to many, companies like Sysco , US Foods , Performance
Food Group , Compass Group , Aramark , and Sodexo work to feed
people in K-12 to university cafeterias, corporate dining halls, restaurants,
sports arenas, amusement parks, hospitals, and home. These companies provide
food and services for many clients from Google to Disney World, Burger King,
Kennedy Space Center, Yosemite National Park, Florida State University, Hilton
Hotels, and the Super Bowl.
This report identifies which major foodservice companies are leaders in
responsible seafood and which are failing. While there are some improvements
underway, several foodservice companies are still failing to provide
responsible seafood.

Sodexo , Aramark , and Compass Group ranked highest yet again
because of their focus on sustainable seafood, increasing their lead over the
worst performers Maines Paper & Food Service, Shamrock Foods , and
Elior North America. Each of the remaining nine profiled companies failed,
including Sysco , US Foods , Gordon Food Service and Reinhart
Foodservice. Performance Food Group overtook its competitor Sysco
for fourth place and is close to receiving a passing score, while
Centerplate and Delaware North are slowly improving as they devote
more resources to responsible seafood.
Applauding industry leaders and exposing those lagging behind is key to
getting foodservice companies to take responsibility to help protect our
oceans and the people who depend on them.
