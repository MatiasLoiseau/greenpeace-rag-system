ExxonMobil stands to benefit from the U.S. State Department’s approval of the
Keystone XL pipeline, and consequently Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should
recuse himself from the permitting decision.

POLICY BRIEF

Summary Findings

● Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should recuse

himself from the decision to approve or reject the
Keystone XL pipeline.

● Tillerson’s recent employer, ExxonMobil, is

heavily invested in high-cost, environmentally
destructive tar sands production that would be
served by the pipeline.

● Canadian tar sands' production is projected to be

limited by a lack of pipeline capacity. It trades at a
significant discount relative to WTI crude when
pipeline capacity is constrained -- a problem which
Keystone XL was proposed to fix.

● Approval of Keystone XL would increase the

value of tar sands oil sold on global markets, and
hence the value of ExxonMobil’s tar sands assets.
● As such, ExxonMobil stands to materially benefit
from the approval of the pipeline granted by its
former CEO Tillerson.

● By handing over U.S. foreign policy to an oil
industry executive, Trump has created fertile
ground for extensive conflicts of interest.
● Recusal in this case is keeping with the spirit of
government ethics laws and Mr. Tillerson’s own
stated ethics commitments.

Trump Order Calls For Rapid Approval of
Keystone XL
Upon taking office one of President Trump’s first actions
was to revive the controversial Keystone XL pipeline,
which would increase the connectivity between Canada’s
tar sands production and U.S. refineries.

In a January 24, 2017 Presidential Memorandum he
directed the Secretary of State to “reach a final permitting
determination” within 60 days of TransCanada's renewed
application.  News reports indicated that TransCanada

submitted a new application shortly thereafter,  notice of
which was published in the Federal Register on February
10.  The 60 day period could expire as soon as March 27.

Former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson was narrowly
approved by the Senate to serve as Secretary of State,
giving him the task of approving TransCanada’s permit
consistent with “the national interest” and all applicable
laws.

Canadian Tar Sands Are Environmentally
Destructive and Economically Questionable
Canadian tar sands were widely touted as a major asset for
international oil companies squeezed by declining
production from existing oil fields and a lack of access to
new discoveries. However, the tar sands have proven to be
both highly controversial and economically questionable.

The mining and processing of tar sands is environmentally
destructive and highly carbon-intensive when compared to
conventional crude oil. When first proposed in 2008, the
Keystone XL pipeline provoked widespread opposition
both in Canada and the U.S. eventually leading to
President Obama’s 2015 decision to reject TransCanada’s
permit application.

Over 120 First Nations and Tribes on both sides of the
Canadian/U.S. border have signed a treaty stating their
explicit opposition to tar sands pipelines, trains and tankers
through their territorial lands and waters. The Treaty is an
expression of Indigenous Law and opposes new, converted
or expanded pipeline infrastructure projects in Canada and
the U.S. that would facilitate the expansion of the tar sands
-- including Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain,
TransCanada’s Energy East and Keystone XL, and
Enbridge’s Northern Gateway and Line 3 pipelines.  4

Analysts have criticized tar sands projects as highly
capital-intensive but yielding low returns.  President
Trump’s proposed Border Adjustment Tax could further
complicate the economics of these projects. A study
published in the journal
 found that expanded tar

sands production was largely incompatible with limiting
global warming to 2 degrees C. Under such scenarios,
open-pit bitumen mining would end after 2020, and 85%
of Canadian bitumen reserves would be “unburnable.”  6

All told, tar sands are among the oil assets most likely to
be “stranded” by stagnant oil demand, persistent low
prices, lack of infrastructure, or concerted global action to
limit carbon emissions. Since 2014, 42 tar sands projects
have been put on hold, delayed or cancelled.  7

ExxonMobil Has Significant Production in the

of crude oil per day.

The question of whether ExxonMobil was properly
valuing these assets drew attention from state attorneys
general and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Just this month, ExxonMobil bowed to
pressure and “de-booked” 3.5 billion barrels of previously
proven oil reserves at the Kearl project, admitting that the
oil was uneconomic to produce at today’s prices.  Before
the write-down, tar sands represented 35% of Exxon’s
liquids reserves.

Canadian Oil Sands Production Is Limited By A
Lack of Pipeline Capacity
Over the past year Western Canadian Select (WCS, or tar
sands) oil has traded about $14/barrel lower than West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices  and has traded
by more than $30/barrel lower in the past. This discount is
evidence of competition from lighter U.S. crude oil, as
well as an ongoing pipeline bottleneck which makes it
difficult and more expensive for tar sands producers to
transport their product to refineries and the global market.

11

A 2017 report by the Canadian Energy Research Institute
(CERI) noted that “constraints in pipeline capacity and the
lack of access to existing and new demand centers have
deepened the discount between WTI and Western
Canadian crudes” thereby giving “Canadian producers a
financial incentive to expand market access in the United

capacity would add value to the tar sands production and
bring prices closer to WTI levels. This could create a
windfall in revenue for all tar sands producers -- including
ExxonMobil and Imperial Oil.

Figure 3: Western Canadian supply forecast and pipeline capacity.
(Source: CAPP 2016)

A 2016 report by the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers (CAPP) showed that pipeline capacity issues
will only grow worse over time. Their report forecast a
growth of 1.5 million barrels per day in Canadian crude oil
production by 2030, and yet the existing pipeline system is
already at capacity.

  14

Keystone XL would add a proposed 830,000 barrels per
day of capacity to the system. Recently the Canadian
government approved two additional pipeline projects that
would similarly ease the tar sands bottleneck -- Kinder

ExxonMobil Would Materially Benefit from
Keystone XL Approval
Should the Keystone XL pipeline be completed,
ExxonMobil’s tar sands production would be well-placed
to take advantage. ExxonMobil states the Kearl project is
“well connected to the substantial North American pipeline
system.”  16

It is not known if ExxonMobil or
Imperial Oil have existing contracts
or agreements with TransCanada to
ship oil via Keystone XL. However,
ExxonMobil would clearly benefit
from any reduction in the WCS
discount should Keystone XL be
built, even if it does not directly
contract with the pipeline for
transportation services. If approved,
the benefit to ExxonMobil could be
measured in the tens to hundreds of
millions of dollars each year.

The CAPP report also notes that two
expansion phases for the Kearl
project have been approved, but are

not yet currently operating. Kearl Phase 3 would bring
80,000 barrels per day online and Kearl Phase 4

Trump’s Ethics Rules Do Not Go Far Enough
Upon accepting President Trump’s nomination to serve as
Secretary of State, Tillerson resigned as ExxonMobil CEO
and negotiated a divestment of his pension and deferred
stock compensation amounting to $180 million.

Tillerson’s ethics agreement states: “For a period of one
year after my resignation from ExxonMobil, I will not
participate personally and substantially in any particular
matter involving specific parties in which I know that
ExxonMobil is a party or represents a party.”  Existing
ethics guidelines put in place by President Obama  and
continued by President Trump require appointees to recuse
themselves from any decisions regarding their former
employer for a period of two years.

 24

23

22

Tillerson further pledges to “recuse myself on a
case-by-case basis” from any particular matter in which a
“reasonable person” would question his impartiality.
Tillerson also states that he will fully divest his stock in
ExxonMobil within 90 days of his confirmation and will
not participate in “any particular matter that to my
knowledge has a direct and predictable effect on the
financial interests of ExxonMobil” until he has divested or
received a waiver. This raises the question of whether
Tillerson will have divested himself within the 60 day
timeframe given for the Keystone XL decision.

27

 In this case, ExxonMobil might not be considered

The phrase “particular matter involving specific parties”
has been interpreted to refer to the “legal rights” of the
parties.
a “specific party” to the Keystone XL decision because it
would affect the legal rights of TransCanada, not
ExxonMobil. Tillerson could choose to interpret this
phrase in an artificially narrow manner that might allow
his participation -- but any reasonable person would
clearly question his impartiality in that situation.

A governmental decision that directly and predictably
enriches a former employer is precisely the sort of
situation that should warrant recusal. To ignore the close
connection between ExxonMobil’s tar sands operations
and the Keystone XL pipeline would be a gross violation
of the spirit of government ethics laws and would lend the
strong appearance of corruption. Recusal is the only
possible course consistent with Rex Tillerson’s ethics
commitments.

The global scope of ExxonMobil’s operations and the
broad remit of the U.S. Department of State indicate that
conflicts such as these will be the norm during Tillerson’s
tenure. Looming decisions regarding the Paris climate
change accord and Russian sanctions were discussed
during Tillerson’s confirmation hearings and raise many of
the same recusal questions.

​

In sworn testimony before the Senate, Tillerson reiterated
his commitment to recuse himself from “any matters that
might come before the State Department that deal directly
and specifically with ExxonMobil”  but also stated that he

These widespread and troubling conflicts only highlight
the perils of appointing an oil industry executive to be the
public face of U.S. diplomacy.
