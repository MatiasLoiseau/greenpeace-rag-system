Kyoto  and the Bali Mandate : 
what the wo rld needs to do to combat climate change
Climat e change is u ndoubtedly the great est e nvironme ntal threat facing the planet today. 
Accor ding to a series o f reports r eleas ed through out 2007 by t he Intergovernmen tal Pa nel on 
Climat e Ch ange (IPCC)  the impacts of clima te change are alr eady  being felt, particul arly in the 
poorest countries o f the world  – those with  least capacity to adapt and the least hist orical 
responsibility  for causi ng climate change. I mmediate action is r equired to  keep glob al mean 
temperature rise as far below 2˚C a s possible c ompared to pre-ind ustrial levels  in ord er to avoid 
the most catastrop hic im pacts of climat e change.
The IPCC re ports als o state that our “[M]itigation e fforts over  the next two to  three decades will 
have a  large im pact on opportunities t o achieve lower  stabilization levels”.  In other words,  we 
need to act n ow. Time is not on our side. If we want t o keep temperature rise bel ow 2°C, glob al 
emissions ne ed to pe ak by  2015 and then b e redu ced by  at least 50% b y 2050 (from 19 90 
levels). This means industrialized  countries cu tting their emissio ns by at least 30% by  2020 and 
by at least 8 0% by 2050.  
Keeping global t emperatur e rise below  2˚C is still po ssible 
It is s till technologically,  economically  and scienti fically possibl e to keep glob al temperature rise 
well below 2ºC, but we are within a decade or two of  closing of f those options with known 
technological  means. 
The conseque nces o f delay in the process o f reducing e missions are s erious. If we del ay, we will 
face a dire glob al emergency  in the 2020s which  will require rat es of  emissions re ductions, which 
in the past have o nly been ass ociat ed with ma ssive  economic collaps e, i.e., with th e collapse of 
the Soviet  Union. We must not allow  ourselves  to be forced to choose between e conomic 
catastro phe and clim ate catastrop he… the most likely  outcome in t hat cas e would b e both. W e 
have a  good chance of avoiding  this if we act no w.
Industri alized countrie s must a ct first
From a moral, legal  and practical p erspec tive, the initial b urden of emissions reductions has to fall 
on industrialized  countries. Do mestic red uctio ns of  at least 30% on  1990 levels  (the ‘baselin e’ 
year for the Kyot o Pro tocol) by 20 20 from industrialized  countries ar e required, with a target o f at 
least 80% red uctio ns by  mid-c entury. However,  a fair means mu st be found for engaging  rapidly 
industrialising  countries in reductio n efforts in the near future.  
Although cli mate change is a t last taking centre stage glob ally with discussi ons in fora such as 
ASEAN, A PEC t he G8 and now the Unit ed N ations High Level meeting, n ot enough urgency 
prevails  in these discussio ns an d there is insu fficient momentum towards t he cr ucial Unite d 
Natio ns clim ate n egoti ations to be held in B ali, Indonesi a in Dec ember o f this year.  W hat must be 
agreed at this n egotia tion is a  Bali Mandat e that establishes t he ambition, content, proc ess a nd 
timetable for negotiatio n of the next stage o f internation al ac tion o n climate change t o be 
conclud ed by 20 09.  
The Bali Mandate
A strong Mandate in Bal i is a fir st cr itical step to wards the negotiation of es sential 
agreements that can peak emissions by  2015.  Without  this st ep the w orld cannot have 
confiden ce that the i nternational community  is seriously  tackling thi s issue.

If we are to prevent, or avoid b eing co mmitted to, dangero us clim ate c hange th e Bali Mandate 
has to be ambitious.  It must set the parameters fo r the nego tiatio ns in 2 008 and 2009 that can 
set the world  on a course t o stay as far below a 2ºC  temperature rise as possible. This requires 
that the emissi on limits and actions to be nego tiated under the Bali Mand ate achieve  the 
following:
•Peak in globa l emission by 2015 and put the world on a  track that c an lead to mor e 
than a halving  of global emission s by 2050 compar ed to  1990 levels; 
followed by 
•Developed  countries emission reductions commitm ents, a s a group, of at l east 
30% b y 2020 (from 1 990 levels) and virtually  complet e decarbonis ation (greate r 
than 85% r eductions) b y 2050.
Rece nt studies have reveale d that the resp onse from the cli mate to the anticip ated rise in 
greenh ouse gases (GHGs) c ould be even m ore dramatic t han previousl y thought. W e 
have t o act even faster an d take more dramatic ac tion i f we are to avoid th e damage 
associate d with  a 2ºC global average t emperature rise. T his m eans that for now we have 
to aim for stabilizing  GHGs in t he atmosphere a t a level below 400 ppm and then seek to 
bring  them down as rapidly  as possible. 
In accor danc e with  the principles of historical res ponsibility  and equity,indus trialized 
countries m ust take the lead in s ubstantially reducing e missions whilst  a means must be 
found to involve  rapidly  developing c ountries in reductio n efforts in the near future. 
•Including  more c ountries in the Ky oto emission trading r egim e, which meansn ewly 
industri alised countri es w ith a high per c apita incom es such a s South Kore a, 
Sing apore and Saudi Arabia should join the Ky oto system  and a dopt  binding 
emission limitation  targets for the next c ommitment per iod beginning 2 013.
Setting th e world  on the pathway  to 50% global re ducti ons by 20 50 must includ e mo re 
countries t han curre ntly have b inding reducti on commitm ents. The present list o f 
countries with  commit ments s hould n ot be viewed as set in stone. There are a  number o f 
countries t hat are at least as wealthy  as those on the original list a nd by any measure of 
fairness sh ould be taking o n binding t argets  after 2012. 
•New market mechani sms to c reate inc entives  for r apidl y industria lising, middl e 
incom e countri es such a s China , Brazi l, Ind ia and South  Africa to particip ate in the 
Kyoto emission s trading system  (through  sector al or other quantified a ction 
commitm ents for gre enhouse g as emission l imitations and/or r eductions (e.g. for 
the el ectri city sector). 
These mechanis ms will  need to be tailored , to the different circu msta nces o f middle 
income countries b ut must all involve  additional actio n and not involve  crediti ng for action 
that would h ave ha ppened anyway. These countries sh ould actively  support t he 
develo pment of these m echanisms a nd to be involved  in their imple mentation 
•Establish arch itecture for the Kyoto second comm itment  period that w ould enab le 
any developing  countr y that w ishes to join the i nternational trading system  with 
national level  quantitative  emissions l imitation co mmitments to do s o.  
This would allow  a developing  country  to volunt eer to neg otiate a national emissions 
reduction target a nd having  done so, that country  would t hen be eligible t o join the 
internatio nal tr ading system.

•A massive  new Clean T echnolog y Deployment  Mechani sm system  aimed at 
switching to cl ean, effici ent, ren ewable technolog y in developing  countries.
Developing  countries n eed assistanc e to follow a low  carbon path to develo pment. The 
availability  of resourc es an d technology  from the industrialized  countries is critical  as is 
the capacity  and ability of the develo ping countries t o act. New  and effective fo rms of 
clean technology  coopera tion and deploym ent c ombining fi nancing with  set go als and 
policies a re required to enable developi ng countries as a grou p to contribut e to the glob al 
effort.
•A Deforestation R eduction Mech anism that provides the n ecessary scale and 
financ ing to drastically reduce deforest ation. The r eductions from for est protection 
must be additiona l to cuts in industria l emissions.  
Tropical forests contain up to 40% of the world’s  terrestrial  carbo n and play a power ful 
role in mitigating th e growing  instability of the climat e. Therefore addressing  deforestation 
must be a critical co mponent of the next p hase of the Kyot o Pro tocol, Funding for this 
mechanism must be link ed to develop ed country emissi on re ducti on commitments a nd 
the res ulting  reductions m ust be additio nal to cuts in fossil fu el emission targets by 
develo ped countries. T he world  needs deeper cuts in bo th fossil fuel and deforestation 
emissions i n ord er to keep us well below a 2˚C rise i n global m ean temperatures .  
Acco unting for the reducti on of emissio ns from deforestation m ust be done at a national 
level and not project by proj ect. A  project which  reduces d eforestation in one part of a 
country  could si mply  lead to more deforestation in other par ts of that country whereas a 
national ap proach would a ccou nt for all of the emissio ns from all of the projec ts within  a 
country.  
Actio ns funded under the Deforestation R eduction Mech anism must also protect 
biodiversit y and engage a nd share benefits with  local indigen ous peoples .  This m ust not 
turn into an internati onal s ubsidy  for logging  companies an d agribusi ness 
Credits f rom a Defore station Reduction Me chani sm should not be freely/ope nly traded 
within  an intern ational carb on mark et for industrial green hous e gas e missio ns. Marke ts 
like th e CDM  contain strict  governance , monitoring,  and verificati on require ments for 
particip ants, which  some of the most import ant developi ng countries with  tropical f orests 
would  not be able to meet. Also, the inclusio n of a large  number of cheap deforestation 
credits c ould potentially  “flood” the ma rket, thus delaying  industrialized  countries f rom 
making the necessary changes in t he energy sector n ow (bec ause they would p urchase 
the cheap deforestation cre dits inst ead). 
•An Adaptation Mech anism  track with a reliable finan cing  mechan ism linked to real 
need s and coupled  to a large international  effort  to scale up adaptation  action, 
which at pre sent fal ls far short of ne eds
The impac ts of clima te change  will dispro portion ately affect those societi es who have 
contribut ed the least to the probl em. Developi ng countries  don't have the resources  that 
the wealthy  countries  have  to adapt to the impacts  of climate change.  They are often 
cultures th at rely on the land (farming  and hunting) for subsistenc e and economic ac tivity. 
The funds currently  availabl e to assess an d counter t he project ed impacts d o not begin t o 
provide a nywhere ne ar the scale o f funding require d: $50bn per year as a minimum. A 
post 2012 regime must ensure consisten t and sufficient funding linked to the costs o f 
adaptation and damages f or the most vulnerable countries a nd should pri oritise  the most 
vulnerable communities and those with  the least capacity  to cope with climate change 
impacts.

•This p ackage to be agr eed to by 2009 at the l atest
The carbon m arkets an d business n eed political cert ainty  to provide  a favourable investme nt 
environm ent for the deployme nt of climate-fr iendly, sustain able technologies. Con tinuity  is

keep the carbo n market stro ng and the price of carbon high. A gap between th e first a nd 
second phase of Kyot o would. s everely  compromis e this signal  and  be disastro us for the 
price o f carbon
Summ ary
In summary, global e missio ns must be cut by at least 5 0% by 2 050. The “aspiration al targets”, 
that are being promoted by some at fora such as APEC or the ‘major e conomi es m eeting’ in 
Washington D.C. will  not be effective in s ecuring  the emission reductions required. Hist ory shows 
this u nequivocally.  Recognising  that the non-bin ding targets i n the Unit ed N ations Fram ework  on 
Climat e Ch ange were  inadequat e to protect the clim ate, the interna tional community  agreed 
binding emissio n cuts - fo r industrialized  nations - in Kyot o in 1997. 
The Gree npeace Energy [R]evolution Scenario1shows, that we can reduce emissi ons f rom the 
power  sector by 50% by 2 050, if we ensure both a massive  uptake of sust ainable re newable 
energy options and double the efficiency with which we  use energy.
There is still  time but it is i ndeed getting  very late. Ominously,  the clima te is c hanging  faster than 
we imagined and impac ts co ming earlier t han were  predict ed. The costs of adaptation to 
inevitable changes in t he next de cade or so ar e alre ady staggering.   Sober scien tists an d 
economists ar e raising  alarm bells t hat can be ignore d only at great p eril to us all
There is no  time for diversions. T he world’s  governm ents m ust concentrate their discussio ns on 
mandating a  framework  for negotiatio ns on the second commitment period o f the Kyoto Pr otocol 
at Bali.
