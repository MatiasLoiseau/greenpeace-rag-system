“ EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
Thai Union Group PLC (TU) is the largest producer of 
canned tuna in the world, supplying to brands and 
retailers around the globe. But TU has been linked 
to the darkest sides of the seafood industry: human 
rights abuses, the wholesale waste of marine life, and 
the killing of endangered species with destructive 
fishing methods. Today’s tuna industry is ridden 
with environmental destruction, human tragedy and 
greed. The problems go beyond one company, but 
TU has the global reach and influence to transform the tuna industry by rejecting the unacceptable 
practices that dominate the sector. 
Over the last year, a series of media exposés have 
shed light on the brutal treatment of vulnerable men 
aboard vessels in Thailand’s fishing fleets – several 
of which have named TU in their investigations.
1/2 
These reports highlight that trafficking, forced and bonded labour is part of the business model of 
companies that have supplied whole fish and raw 
material to global heavyweights such as TU. A recent 
Greenpeace investigation, which included interviews 
with victims of trafficking, forced and bonded labour, 
highlights how the abusive practices in Thailand’s 
distant water fishing fleets present a severe supply 
chain risk to TU’s tuna operations that goes beyond 
the piecemeal actions taken by the company in response to media scrutiny. Although TU has taken action to drop suppliers 
implicated in abuse and introduced a new labour 
code of conduct this year, the burden is on TU to 
demonstrate to its customers that it has taken 
effective steps to ensure that its seafood supply 
chains are free of exploitation – all the way down to 
the fishing boats.
3/4/5 Efforts to clean up the supply 
chain of this globe-straddling giant cannot just focus 
on shrimp aquaculture operations or Thailand’s 
fishing fleets, as have TU’s principal commitments 
to addressing human rights issues over the last 15 
months.6/7
Consumers are increasingly demanding certainty that some of the most well-known tuna brands in the world 
are brought to the shelf through environmentally-
sound fishing practices where workers are treated 
fairly. Some are even starting to tell TU this through 
class action lawsuits against its subsidiaries and the 
companies it supplies to.
8/9 Vessels landing wild-
caught fish for TU are wreaking environmental havoc and sowing human misery across the oceans of the 
world. While TU is not the only seafood company 
with serious human rights issues in its supply chain, 
it is in an unrivalled position to drive positive changes 
that can transform the global tuna industry and the 
lives of countless men at sea.“ We all have to admit that it is difficult to ensure the 
Thai seafood industry’s supply chain is 100 percent 
clean.”   – Thirapong Chansiri, CEO of Thai Union Group 10 EXECUTIVE

The world’s oceans, particularly the high seas, are 
some of the most lawless places on the planet, 
where both environmental and social crimes 
routinely go unpunished.11 Exploitation of workers 
in the fishing sector is of growing concern globally, 
particularly following multiple high-profile exposés 
focusing on Southeast Asia in recent years.12/13/14 
Human rights abuse in the fishing sector is a global problem occurring across the world and one which is often connected to other forms of criminal activity, including Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated 
(IUU) fishing.
15/16/17 Under-regulation and a lack of 
enforcement over both fishing operations and labour standards has meant that our oceans have become 
a scene of environmental destruction and where 
internationally accepted human rights standards are 
regularly violated in the pursuit of profit.THE SCENE
Global demand for cheap seafood is one of the key drivers of both environmental degradation and 
human rights abuses in the fishing industry. During 
the last 6 decades, global annual production of tuna 
and similar species has increased more than 1100% 
to over 7 million tonnes, driven mainly by consumers 
in Europe, North America and Japan.
18/19/20 As 
highlighted in a recent series of video testimonies released by Greenpeace, human rights abuses 
in the Pacific tuna fleet – which supplies around 70% of global demand – are serious and require 
urgent attention.
21/22 Global producers, buyers 
and retailers of seafood wield a purchasing power that can push changes throughout product supply 
chains, ensuring that suppliers adhere to rigorous 
standards to uphold the rights of the workers who 
catch, process and package our seafood.THE MOTIVE02
Global demand for cheap seafood is one of the 
key drivers of both environmental degradation and human rights abuses in the fishing industry.INTRODUCTION02

THE SUSPECT
Thai Union Group PCL (TU) is the third-largest 
seafood company on the planet, producing almost 
a fifth of the global tuna supply, making it the largest 
manufacturer of canned tuna in the world.23/24/25 
Roughly 40% of all Thai tuna is sold by TU – every 
second the company exports the equivalent of 
about 157 cans of tuna from Thailand.26/27 Today, 
TU produces a variety of seafood products and has 
dozens of subsidiaries and partnerships engaged in 
nearly all aspects of seafood production – from wild 
capture and processing to the manufacture of cans and packaging and distribution – both for its own brands and for other private labels. TU’s reach goes 
from sea to shelf: its brands dominate the world’s 
major tuna markets. The company is a “keystone 
actor in marine ecosystems”, responsible for a 
disproportionately large impact on our oceans.
28  As 
a major global producer and heavyweight corporate actor, TU also wields a significant amount of 
influence over the conditions of work throughout its 
entire supply chain.© Ardiles Rante  /  Greenpeace

TU owns some of the best-known canned seafood 
brands in the world, although most consumers 
don’t know much about the parent company. From 
Chicken of the Sea in the US and MW Brands 
in Europe – which itself distributes under the 
household names John West, Petit Navire, Hyacinthe 
Parmentier and Mareblu – to Century Tuna in China 
and Sealect in Thailand. Over the last two decades, TU has diversified its operations and executed at 
least 10 acquisitions that have tripled sales revenue 
and extended its global reach.31 In December 2014, 
TU announced the purchase of Bumble Bee Foods for USD 1.5 billion, a deal which has yet to be 
concluded due to an ongoing antitrust investigation 
by US authorities.

Men and women working throughout the seafood 
sector are exposed to a range of abuses. Research 
from Southeast Asia indicates that it is often 
those who migrate, particularly across borders, 
that are the most vulnerable to exploitation and 
abuse.35/36 Thailand’s seafood sector has become 
internationally notorious for human trafficking, 
debt bondage, child labour and forced labour but 
beyond these and other serious abuses, workers 
also routinely suffer a raft of human rights and 
labour violations. Although international concern 
and media attention in particular has often focused 
on the shrimp supply chain, research indicates that 
egregious human rights and labour abuses are also 
present in tuna supply chains.37/38
Processing facilities prepare, package and add value to the seafood we consume. Unacceptable 
abuses in both licensed and unlicensed processing 
facilities in Thailand include the refusal of pay, 
charging of excessive fees, confiscation of 
documents, physical abuse, sexual assault, forcible 
confinement, debt bondage, trafficking and the use 
of child labour.
39/40/41/42/43 In one International Labour 
Organization (ILO) survey, almost one in 10 workers 
in processing facilities reported being forced to 
work, while a UN body found that 7% of workers interviewed in Thailand’s main processing hub had 
experienced forced labour and one third had been 
trafficked.44/45 A 2015 ILO study found that roughly 
one in 5 underage migrant workers in Thailand’s 
seafood sector suffer injuries in the workplace - 
making it more than twice as common compared 
to other sectors using child labour.46 One-third of 
the child seafood workers in this study did not even attend school.
The situation facing workers in the Thai fishing 
industry is even more serious. Two major ILO studies 
have found that around 20% of fishers on Thai 
vessels exhibit indicators of trafficking, forced or 
bonded labour.
47/48 One of these found that over 40% 
of fishers surveyed had experienced arbitrary wage 
deductions, 17% were threatened with violence 
and roughly one in ten had attempted to escape, 
been severely beaten or both. A more recent study, 
involving hundreds of trafficked fishers, found that 
80% reported “never feeling free”; over two-thirds had experienced physical or sexual violence; more 
than half had seen their broker harm someone; 
and almost a quarter had been forcibly confined or 
imprisoned.
49 Almost 6% reported being force fed 
drugs such as methamphetamine to increase their productivity aboard the fishing vessel.VICTIMS

Evidence from Thailand suggests that precipitous 
declines in fish stocks over the last half century and 
rising operational costs – particularly those related 
to crewing and fuelling fishing vessels – have driven 
the use of trafficked, forced and bonded labour in 
the industry.50 Increasingly poor yields from Thai 
territorial waters, principally the result of severe overcapacity in fishing fleets, have exerted outward and downward pressures on vessel operators. 
Fishing boats are now going out further to sea to 
fish for longer periods of time using unsustainable 
methods. As revenues fall and costs rise, vessel 
operators have turned to trafficking networks to supply crew and depress expenditure on labour.
Up to half of the marine fish landings in Thai ports comes from outside of Thailand’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
54/55 In a 2013 ILO study, long-
haul fishing vessels – which often operate outside 
of Thailand’s EEZ – were found to be 5 times more 
likely than short-haul vessels to have crew onboard 
who had been deceived or coerced into fishing.56 
Trafficking of men into the distant water fleet is not 
a new phenomenon. Since 2002, reports to a Thai 
missing persons hotline had been raising red flags around the disappearance of middle-aged Thai 
men.57 Some of these cases were later clarified 
by escapees, who told of their experiences being 
trafficked for forced labour onto Thai-owned fishing 
vessels operating in Indonesian and Malaysian 
waters. Between 2008 and 2009, two Thai civil 
society organisations came into contact with 
almost 300 men who were destined for or escaping 
from forced and bonded labour aboard Thailand’s 
distantwater fishing fleets.58  3,300%

Fundamentally, exploitation flourishes in the Thai 
fishing industry because of inadequate regulatory 
frameworks, poor due diligence and weak 
monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement 
systems by coastal, flag and port States. But 
human rights abuse is also driven by an array of 
other factors. The Thai fishing industry is structurally 
dependent on unskilled workers, a result of the 
sector’s failure to invest in technological solutions to 
increase labour productivity as well as an abundance of cheap migrant labour from the country’s 
comparatively less-developed neighbours.
59/60 At the 
same time, vessel operators face a chronic shortage of workers – a deficit estimated by the National 
Fishing Association of Thailand (NFAT) to be as high 
as 50,000.
61 Combined with economic pressures 
arising from the degradation of marine resources in the Thai EEZ, these factors shape the prevalence of labour abuses and the use of trafficking, forced and 
bonded labour in Thailand’s fishing industry.
62
The men and boys who are trafficked to Indonesia to work aboard Thailand’s distant water fishing fleets 
are typically migrants from Myanmar, Cambodia, 
Laos and underdeveloped rural regions of Thailand 
– particularly the northeast. Victims are intercepted 
by brokers at border regions or major transport 
hubs and deceived into working on fishing boats 
with the promise of good jobs in onshore industries. 
Some are persuaded by brokers to visit restaurants 
and karaoke bars, where they are drugged and abducted or presented with vastly inflated bills for 
food, alcohol and sexual services, which they must 
then work to pay off.
63 Many are forcibly confined in 
locked rooms or under armed guard as they await departure to Indonesian waters – those who try to escape end up being beaten.
The trafficking process often relies on the use of 
counterfeit Seaman Books, the official documents 
required for persons leaving or entering the Thai 
EEZ aboard fishing vessels.
64 In August 2014, Thai 
authorities raided part of a network of illegal printing presses in Bangkok, the operator of which told of one 
man who had come to him for 2,000 fake Seaman 
Books over the last two years, at a cost of just USD 
4.60 (61,695 IDR – 163 THB) each.
65 Counterfeit 
Seaman Books typically use the names of deceased 
men along with photos of the actual fisher to turn, 
for example, a Cambodian or Burmese man into 
a Thai national. It remains uncertain as to how 
these fake documents and associated immigration 
forms pass the inspection of Government officials, 
as required under Thai law for the processing of a 
fisher’s departure or arrival in the country.66
The use of fake documentation can render victims 
of trafficking, forced and bonded labour de facto 
stateless as soon as they step off the boat.67 In 2008, 
an Al Jazeera documentary told the story of the thousands of Burmese runaways who had escaped 
exploitation aboard Thai trawlers and were eking 
out a precarious existence on the Indonesian island 
of Tual.
68 Captains and vessel operators routinely 
strand non-compliant workers on Indonesian islands 
– some eventually integrate into the local community 
or end up detained by immigration authorities. Many 
return to the boats or ports for work, providing a 
rotating pool of cheap, disenfranchised labour for 
unscrupulous business owners.

In mid 2014, investigations by a prominent Thai 
media outfit discovered hundreds of Thai men who 
had been trafficked onto fishing vessels operating 
out of Ambon, Indonesia.71 Over the ensuing months, 
a stream of cases emerged detailing the thousands 
of Burmese, Thai, Cambodian and Laotian men 
who had been trafficked onto Thai fishing boats 
across Indonesia’s Maluku province in order to work 
under appalling conditions of debt bondage and 
forced labour – victim testimonies recalled incidents 
of physical abuse, torture and even murder. The 
attention of the international community was 
galvanised in March 2015 by a major report from Associated Press (AP).
72 As of September 2015, the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) has 
assisted a total of 1,033 people rescued in Benjina, 
Ambon and Tual from 189 former Thai-owned gillnet 
and trawler fishing vessels previously licensed to fish in Indonesia’s Arafura Sea.
73/74The AP investigation tracked fish caught through 
forced labour as it was loaded onto the Silver Sea 
Line, a refrigerated cargo (reefer) vessel operated 
by the Thailand-based Silver Sea Line Co. Ltd. As 
the Silver Sea Line offloaded in Samut Sakhon, 
Thailand’s main seafood hub, AP followed shipments 
of fish to processing and cold storage facilities 
around the province. One truck was followed to 
Niwat Co., supplier to a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
TU, Thai Union Manufacturing Co. Ltd. In the face of international scrutiny of marine fish associated 
with abuse entering its product supply chains, TU 
immediately announced the cessation of trading 
with Niwat Co.
75 The company did not however 
announce that it would stop sourcing marine fish landed by Silver Sea Line nor, despite the scale 
of abuse uncovered in Indonesia, the various 
reefers owned by Silver Sea Line Co. Ltd., Silver Sea Reefer Co. Ltd. and other Thai companies 
landing catch from fishing vessels operating out of Maluku province.

A small group of companies dominate distant water 
fishing operations in Thailand. The Thai Overseas 
Fishing Association (TOFA), which acts as a broker 
to secure licenses from foreign governments and 
arrange the scheduling of reefer transshipments 
with fishing fleets, has 30 members with a combined 
total of 462 fishing vessels.76 Boats that fish in 
foreign waters are either fully-owned by Thais or operated under joint venture agreements between 
Thais and nationals of the country in which they 
are fishing. The refrigerated cargo vessels which 
send supplies – and, according to investigations 
by Thailand’s Department of Special Investigations, 
trafficked workers – to fishing fleets and pick up the 
fish which is landed in Thai ports, are owned by just 
a handful of powerful companies.
77 
Silver Sea Line Co. Ltd., the company implicated in AP’s findings, and the associated companies 
Silver Sea Reefer Co. Ltd. and Dech Reefer Co. Ltd 
operate multiple reefer vessels. At least 5 reefers 
operated by this group have landed fish from 
Indonesian vessels in the seafood processing hub of 
Samut Sakhon, the site of one of TU’s principal tuna 
canning facilities, over the last 18 months. Many of 
the fishing vessels serviced by Silver Sea reefers 
were nominally operated by PT Pusaka Benjina Resources and Mabiru Group which, according to senior Indonesian government officials, are in reality 
shell companies set-up to obfuscate ownership 
by Thai nationals.
78 The issuing of fishing licences 
to foreign vessels in Indonesia has been described 
as an acutely corrupt process.79 PT Pusaka Benjina 
Resources, the company operating the vessels tracked in the AP investigation from which more 
than 1,400 crew have been rescued by authorities, 
admitted to paying USD 2,700 a month in bribes to 
local officials.
80/81 
The Silver Sea Line is not the only Silver Sea reefer picking up fish sourced through human misery in 
Indonesia and landing it in Samut Sakhon, where 
it enters the supply chains of Thailand’s export-
oriented seafood sector. Following increased 
scrutiny and regulation over fishing operations in 
Maluku province, a group of PT Pusaka Benjina 
Resources vessels crewed by victims of abuse fled 
to Papua New Guinean waters – illegally flying Papua 
New Guinean colours and with fresh names and 
registration numbers covering the previous ones.
82 
The reefer Silver Sea 2, previously also operating out of Ambon, followed them transshipping supplies 
and fish at sea in the middle of the Papua New 
Guinean Dog Leg, before being seized by Indonesian 
authorities in August 2015 on the return leg of its 
journey.

Kyaw Moe Thu 84, a 35-year-old from Yangon 
Division, was working in a distillery in Yangon 
when he met Soe Naing, who told him about the 
wages he could earn working in Thailand and 
offered to pay his travel expenses. In November 
2003, Kyaw Moe Thu arrived in Myawaddy on the 
Burmese-Thai border and was taken across to 
Mae Sot in Thailand. There, Soe Naing transferred 
him to another broker who told Kyaw Moe Thu 
that he was going to work in a seafood cannery. They walked through the forest for three days 
to a sugarcane plantation in Kamphaeng Phet 
province. At the plantation, Kyaw Moe Thu was 
handed over to a Thai woman who transported him 
to a house he claims was owned by police. From 
there, Kyaw Moe Thu alleges that he was taken in 
a police car, along with 10 others, to the Thailand’s 
principal seafood hub of Samut Sakhon.
Kyaw Moe Thu was locked in a room in a broker’s 
compound in Samut Sakhon for a month, under 
guard by three men armed with knives and guns. 
It was here he learned that he had been sold to 
work on a fishing boat in Indonesia. The broker, 
Ah Naing, told the victims that the working 
conditions aboard the vessels were good – 
promising the men that they would be able to 
afford to smoke good brands of cigarettes like Marlboro. Kyaw Moe Thu didn’t want to go but 
escape was impossible – the men were beaten 
when they attempted to leave the compound. The 
broker brought a cameraman to take a photo of 
the men, explaining that the images were for their 
Seaman Books, before they were eventually put 
onto a reefer departing for Indonesian waters. Ah Naing had told Kyaw Moe Thu that he would only have to work for four months to pay off his debt. 
For the next ten years, Kyaw Moe Thu worked 
aboard two fishing vessels in Indonesia without 
pay.  Arriving in Ambon to work aboard the gillnet 
fishing boat Wijaya 29 in 2004, Kyaw Moe Thu met 
another 10 Burmese men under the control of a 
different broker in Thailand. Fishing for tuna and 
other species aboard this vessel involved a brutal 
cycle of 22 hour working days where trafficked and abused fishers laid nets, arranged blocks of 
frozen fish and conducted repairs. Kyaw Moe Thu 
was beaten and abused for not working as fast or 
as hard as the other crew and, before long, found 
himself abandoned by the captain on the Saumlaki, 
Tanimbar islands before being re-trafficked onto 
the trawler Mahatan Arujaya 12. In late 2013, Kyaw 
Moe Thu returned to Samut Sakhon where he met 
with a man he identified as the owner of Mahatan Arujaya 12. The owner didn’t mention Kyaw Moe 
Thu’s salary and quickly sent him back to Ambon 
on the carrier vessel Marine One. In May 2015, the 
captain of Mahatan Arujaya 12 gave Kyaw Moe 
Thu a document in Thai to sign. The captain didn’t 
explain the contents of the document, but told 
Kyaw Moe Thu that he needed to sign to receive 
his salary for the last year, totalling around USD 
1,300. Unknown to him at the time, Kyaw Moe Thu had unwittingly signed a document saying that he 
had received the full salary he was due, had not 
been mistreated aboard the vessel and was not a 
victim of trafficking, forced or bonded labour. As 
of September 2015, Kyaw Moe Thu had still not 
received the wages due to him for the 7 years and 8 
months he worked aboard the Mahatan Arujaya 
12.Interviews with crew conducted on the Indonesian island of 
Ambon by Greenpeace in September 2015 point to another Silver Sea reefer - Marine One, which transported tuna and other marine fish caught through trafficked, forced and bonded labour to Thailand’s principal, export-oriented seafood processing hub.KYAW MOE THU’S STORY

16  
We met with the [Indonesian] authorities [at sea]. They just came close to 
the boat and talked with the captain on the radio, asking who the boss is and which company owned the boat. Later, after they had left, the company office would call the captain to tell him how much they had paid to the authorities…After that, they didn’t bother us again and we could catch fish anywhere in the sea.”On [the Wijaya 29] I was beaten because I was not as strong as the 
others – when they were carrying frozen blocks of fish, I couldn’t. I wasn’t strong enough and fast enough to finish the job. That was why I was beaten on that boat.
  About four or five days before the reefer left, six friends and I –men who are still on the fishing boat – tried to escape but we couldn’t. They punched us and we weren’t even allowed to eat after that.“The broker called us ‘soccer balls’, meaning that we were under their 
feet and could be kicked anywhere and didn’t have the ability to go anywhere on our own.

“We were not allowed to leave the room. One guy tried to escape, but 
he was beaten. Another was beaten until his leg was broken so we didn’t dare flee. There were 13 of us in a group. The guy who had his leg broken was an example to us, the ones who wanted to flee. So we didn’t dare try to escape.
Those who’d been beaten in [Samut Sakhon] were also sent to the 
boat and when the boat arrived in port [in Ambon], they tried to flee again. The captain caught them with the help of the police who sent them to jail. I don’t know whether they were deported or not.
We could have a decent shower whenever it rained.
The Thais treated us Burmese badly. They didn’t allow us to eat much, 
the meals they gave us were small and not enough. They shouted at us and swore at us and pushed us to work even while we were eating. We would never get to eat enough. Our lives were really tough out there, I was so disappointed.”
  If I can take legal action against [the captain], I want to confront him face to face in court.

18  
Min Min Thein 85, was brought to Samut Sakhon after 
being passed through a chain of 7 Burmese brokers 
operating in Myawaddy, Dawei, Kanchanaburi and Samut 
Sakhon. As he was escorted through Myawaddy, he had 
been told that he was going to get a job as a construction 
worker in Bangkok. Once Min Min Thein arrived in Samut 
Sakhon however, he was locked in a room in the port with 
13 others, guarded by brokers. Although some discussed 
and even attempted escape, vicious beatings at the hands 
of the brokers soon quelled all dissent and, after about a week in forcible confinement, the men were put on a boat 
to Indonesia.
Min Min Thein ended up working 20-hour days aboard the 
Arumina Pusaka 718, a gillnet mostly catching tuna and 
sharks, for 15 months. The vessel landed both juvenile and adult sharks but would discard any small tuna that 
were brought in, returning to the port of Ambon every 
three months where the crew would load the vessel’s 
catch onto the reefer Marine One. In the 15 months Min 
Min Thein worked aboard the Arumina Pusaka 718 he did 
not receive any wages, despite promises from the vessel’s 
captain that he would be paid USD 252 a month. In March 
2015, Min Min Thein was told by his captain to sign a 
document in Thai that he didn’t understand and without 
any explanation as to its contents. Min Min Thein was informed that he would be sent back home by plane and 
given USD 1,489 around 40% of the wages promised to 
him by the captain of Arumina Pusaka 718.

Supply Chained Human Rights Abuses In The Global Tuna Industry Greenpeace Southeast Asia   19  
Thai Union needs to prove that it is abiding by its 
own code of conduct on labour and human rights 
in its supply chain.86/87 In late September 2015, the 
company announced a new Business Ethics and Labour Code of Conduct to update and replace a previous version introduced in 2013.
88/89 Although 
the new code of conduct is binding on all suppliers, it is not oriented towards TU’s extended supply 
chain and does not directly address human rights 
issues on vessels providing whole fish or raw 
material to TU suppliers. A Vessel Code of Conduct 
is anticipated by the end of 2015.
90  
TU emphasises that the new code of conduct is just 
one of several measures being taken to address 
human trafficking and other labour issues.91 Chief 
among these is its membership of a task force coalition of business and NGOs, through which it 
is undertaking extensive social audits of its shrimp 
feed supply chain.
92  Although these audits include 
tuna operations providing by-product (trimmings and offcuts) to shrimp feed mills, up until now TU 
has failed to make explicit commitments to address 
the risk of human rights abuses in its entire tuna 
supply chain. TU claims that less than four percent 
of its seafood is sourced from Thai-flagged fishing 
vessels but testimonies gathered by Greenpeace 
indicates that human rights abuses are widespread 
across the Pacific tuna fleet.
93/94 Efforts to drive 
down traceability and identify and address human 
rights abuses in TU’s supply chain must be global in 
scope, and cover the rest of the 96% of their supply 
chain and not just focus on the Thai fishing industry.  In September 2015, TU adopted a new policy commitment to ban transshipment at sea, seemingly 
in response to the AP investigation, as well as a 
New York Times exposé on human trafficking and 
forced labour naming one of its wholly-owned 
subsidiaries, Songkla Canning PLC.
95 The practice 
of transshipment at sea not only allows illegally-caught fish to be laundered, it also exacerbates the 
risk of human rights abuse by enabling vessels to 
stay at sea indefinitely, where unscrupulous vessel 
operators can keep abused fishers isolated and 
locked into cycles of exploitation. TU’s new policy 
states that, as of April 2015, the company “ceased 
all purchases from motherships and transshipment 
vessels in the territorial waters of Thailand”.
96 The 
policy does not make clear as to whether suppliers 
to TU are likewise required to cease purchases 
from vessels transhipping at sea nor whether the 
commitment is binding on vessels landing marine 
fish in ports in Thailand that has been transhipped 
in the high seas or within the EEZ of Thailand or any 
other country. 
TU should make sure that its insatiable demand for 
cheap fish in large volumes does not come at the 
expense of environmental security and social equity. 
The company must work with its current and former 
suppliers to ensure that the hundreds of fishers still 
stranded on Indonesian islands, and the thousands 
more still unaccounted for, do not lack for assistance 
required to get them repatriated and reintegrated 
into their home communities. CONCLUSION03

20  
Many require compensation for the abuses they 
have suffered. When the Indonesian moratorium on 
the issuing and renewal of foreign fishing licences 
ends this year, TU must also make sure that its fish is 
coming from operations that are fishing legally. Plate 
to net traceability enhances both environmental 
and social responsibility. Establishing visibility over 
the fishing vessels which are actually catching the 
seafood on supermarket shelves around the world, 
in order to ensure that they are free of abuse and not involved in environmental destruction, should 
be TU’s first and foremost priority. As high-impact 
media reports increasingly bring consumers face 
to face with the realities of the men who are forced 
to fish for our seafood, global giants such as TU 
need to take urgent action and demonstrate to 
their customers the steps they are taking to ensure 
that their supply chains are free of abuse. TU was 
recently named in class action lawsuits against Nestlé and Mars, alleging that the latter knowingly 
sold pet food produced from ingredients obtained
through forced labour.
97 A third suit against TU’s US subsidiary, Tri-Union Seafoods LLC and producers of leading tuna brand Chicken of the Sea, was filed 
in September 2015.
98
TU is not the only seafood company with problems in its supply chain but it should be using its global reach 
and influence to demonstrate market leadership that 
builds on progress ensuring social compliance in its 
upstream operations and drives positive change 
down to the vessel level.
99/100 Addressing these 
problems is not just ethically imperative for industry 
– it is good business as well. In one survey, 88% 
of consumers stated that they would stop buying 
a seafood product if it was associated with human 
rights abuses while 70% said they would pay more 
for a product which could demonstrably prove it 
was free of them.101 TU has the purchasing power 
and influence to respond to urgent demands from 
stakeholders around the world for seafood which is 
both environmentally sustainable and free of human 
rights abuses. The time for it to do so is now.© Ardiles Rante  /  Greenpeace

As the largest tuna company in the world, Thai Union must 
take immediate steps to address labour abuses and end destructive, unsustainable fishing practices in its own supply chain while leading the whole tuna industry towards increased social and environmental compliance. As a priority TU should:04
1. Commit to not sourcing from fisheries 
where labour and human rights abuses are 
present and demonstrate this with third-
party audited documentation. 
2. Commit to end and phase out 
transshipments at sea. 3. Stop sourcing from destructive and wasteful long-lines fisheries where shark 
capture and finning remains endemic, and 
where there continues to be high levels of bycatch.
4. Stop sourcing from fisheries that 
deploy destructive purse seines with Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), and from 
fisheries where FAD regulations and control 
remains largely non-existent.
Greenpeace is asking TU to provide more than just policy announcements that commit to making these 
changes. TU must provide detailed workplans with clear milestones and schedules explaining how they intend to make these changes to their supply chains so that the companies’ progress can be effectively 
monitored.04
