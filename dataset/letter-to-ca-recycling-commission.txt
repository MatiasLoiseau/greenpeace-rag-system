Acceptance of Unrecyclable Plastic Products and California’s Continued Exports of Plastic Waste Exports to Non-OECD Countries
Acceptance of Unrecyclable Plastic Products and California’s Continued Exports
of Plastic Waste Exports to Non-OECD Countries
To Statewide Commission on Recycling Markets and Curbside Recycling
SUBJECT: Acceptance of Unrecyclable Plastic Products and California’s
Continued Exports of Plastic Waste Exports to Non-OECD Countries
The co-signers of this letter, Greenpeace USA, Oceana, Surfrider Foundation,
the Center for Biological Diversity, The 5 Gyres Institute, Peak Plastic
Foundation, The Center for Oceanic Awareness, Research, and Education (COARE),
Beyond Plastics, San Francisco Bay Physicians for Social Responsibility, Story
of Stuff Project, Basel Action Network, GAIA, Algalita, and Safer Chemicals,
Healthy Families, on behalf of our more than one million California members,
write to provide input on the California Statewide Recyclable List, currently
under discussion by the Statewide Commission on Recycling Markets and Curbside
Recycling. We urge you to let the data guide your decision. Accordingly,
plastic items for inclusion should be limited to #1 PET bottles and #2 HDPE
narrow-neck bottles and jugs. Any of these items with non-compatible shrink
sleeves or other unrecyclable components should be excluded. Items such as
clamshell packaging, PP5 materials, or aerosol containers that do not meet
California criteria should not be included. Further, we encourage the
Commission to use the Statewide Recyclable List as a basis for what can be
included in curbside recycling programs in California. Provisions should be
made for individual MRFs to add additional items if they can demonstrate a
readily available market for them.
Limiting the materials that can be marketed as recyclable and included in
curbside recycling programs will decrease contamination and increase
efficiency, with significant cost savings. The time-consuming and expensive
process to sort and remove unrecyclable items from recycling streams has
undermined recycling programs in the state and across the U.S. This data-
driven approach will also have significant benefit for communities in the
Global South.
California Is the World’s Leading Plastic Waste Exporter
To address the plastic pollution crisis, the United Nations Basel Convention
agreed to strictly control the exports of Plastic Wastes. This new agreement,
a series of amendments adopted by 187 countries, took effect beginning January
1, 2021. While other countries are now restricting plastic waste imports to
Non-OECD countries, the flow of U.S. plastic waste to countries with high
waste mismanagement rates continues at a high level. In March 2021 alone,
California exported 7.4 million kg of plastic waste to Non-OECD countries,
including 3.8 million kg to Malaysia (equal to 24 TEU shipping containers per
day).
We are concerned that the State of California is continuing to shift its
plastic waste burden onto other countries, causing harm to the global
environment, communities, and the health of people around the world. More
than one hundred other
investigations over
the past several years have documented the harms and shown that exported
plastic wastes have not been safely recycled.
The United States is now the largest exporter of plastic waste to Non-OECD
countries and California accounts for 27% of the plastic waste. More than any
other state, California’s recycling facilities continue to accept plastic
waste that is exported to developing countries that have weak wage and age
labor standards and few environmental protections.

The Statewide Commission on Recycling Markets and Curbside Recycling must take
a leading role in ending the greenwashing of unrecyclable plastic products and
exports of plastic waste that are proven to cause plastic pollution in the
ocean and cause acute social and environmental harms in receiving countries.

Next Steps
There is growing public concern over the final fate of plastic materials
collected for recycling and greenwashing of unrecyclable plastic products.
We request that only plastic items that are sorted by type and currently
have sufficient domestic reprocessing capacity be labeled and accepted as
recyclable. Other plastic items should not be included on California’s
Statewide Recyclable List. Labeling plastic items as recyclable that are not
sorted and do not currently have proven domestic markets deceives consumers.
Greenwashing of unrecyclable products stifles innovation to improve product
design. It works against market development and negates the need for producers
to invest in sorting at material recover facilities (MRFs) and plastic
reprocessing facilities.
We look forward to your response. Please reply to John Hocevar, Oceans
Campaign Director for Greenpeace USA <[email protected]>, who will distribute responses to the signers of this letter and
other concerned stakeholders.
