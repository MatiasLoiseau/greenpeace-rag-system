Protecting ancient forests is
vital to tackle climate change,
preserve global biodiversity,
and protect the livelihoods of
millions of forest peoples.

Tropical forest destruction is
responsible for about one fifth
of global greenhouse gas
emissions, more than from the
world’s entire transport sector.

To prevent dangerous climate
change, we need a global
effort to end forest destruction,
as well as a revolution in the
ways we produce and use
energy.

Forests for Climate
Forests for Climate1 is a landmark proposal for
an international funding mechanism to protect
tropical forests. The mechanism would become
part of the second phase of the Kyoto (post-2012)
agreement on climate change. If countries commit
to Forests for Climate, funding to protect tropical
forests could become available as soon as 2009.
It is estimated that halving emissions from
deforestation will cost US $10-15 billion per year.2
Forests for Climate has the potential to raise
these funds, and more.

How it works
Industrialised countries that commit to doing
their fair share in reducing energy and industrial
emissions would be allowed to meet a portion of
their overall commitments through the purchase of
cost effective “tropical deforestation units.” A major
benefit for industrialised countries is that the
units would act as hard currency for compliance
purposes, since the mechanism would be
responsible for delivering verifiable emission
reductions.

Developing countries with tropical forests that
choose to participate in Forests for Climate
would make commitments to protecting their
forests consistent with the UNFCCC “common
but differentiated responsibilities.” In exchange,
developing countries would have the opportunity
to receive funding for capacity-building efforts
and for national-level reductions in deforestation
emissions. Countries that reliably and accurately
report emission reductions would receive a greater
return for their services. This would provide a strong
incentive for developing countries to continually
improve their forest protection programmes.

The Forests for
Climate Advantage

Immediate and Reliable Funding

Forests for Climate would require industrialised
countries to make a minimum contribution, a
“tropical deforestation commitment.” This would
ensure a significant and steady stream of funds to
protect tropical forests in developing countries.
Industrialised countries could choose to purchase
additional units up to a certain cap. This limit would
safeguard against countries using this opportunity
as an excuse to do nothing about energy and
industrial emissions at home.

Forests for Climate could make billions of euros
available for capacity building and emission
reduction activities through a forward sale (or
auction) of emission allowances in 2009. This
commitment would give developing countries an
incentive to stop deforesting now, well before the
second phase of the Kyoto Protocol begins in
2013. The climate emergency requires urgent
action. Forests for Climate would provide it.

Global Coverage: Open
to the Widest Range of
Countries with Tropical
Forests
Forests for Climate is open to the greatest
number of countries possible and is adaptable to
the different needs and capabilities of those
countries – nations as diverse as Brazil, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Indonesia.
Forests for Climate would achieve this by
applying a “portfolio performance approach,” with
funding programmes and reporting standards
tailored to different regions or countries.

Efforts to include tropical forests in the carbon
markets would risk excluding critical countries with
low deforestation rates (such as the Congo Basin
nations), as well as countries unable to meet the
market’s strict monitoring and verification
requirements. Forests for Climate would avoid
this, and provide funding to countries with varying
capacities, including those with high and low
deforestation rates.

Protects Biodiversity
and the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples
Protection of biodiversity lies at the core of Forests
for Climate, which prioritises intact and other
important natural forests (such as peatland forests)
in efforts to halt deforestation. Tropical forests cover
just 7 per cent of the Earth’s land surface, yet
contain nearly half of all life on Earth. These forests
also regulate water cycles, which provide drinking
water and rain to local communities. Forests for
Climate would value both carbon and biodiversity,
and would not subsidise the expansion of industrial
logging, agri-business and other destructive
practices into intact forests.

The millions of indigenous people who live in and off
the forests need to have their futures secured so
that they can remain guardians of the forests.
Forests for Climate would recognise The UN
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
and fully respect the land, resource use and
ownership rights of these peoples. Local indigenous
people would be directly engaged in the
development and implementation of the
mechanism.

Protects Against
“Leakage”
Forests for Climate would protect against
“leakage” – forest destruction stopped in one area,
moving to another. Project and sub-national
approaches to reducing deforestation risk merely
shifting the destruction. Forests for Climate would
require national-level reductions in emissions to
prevent deforestation from shifting from one part of
a country to another. Because the mechanism
would provide the greatest number of tropical forest
countries access to financing, the risk of
international leakage is also greatly reduced. This
will ensure that the mechanism delivers real benefits
for climate and biodiversity.

Protects the Stability
of Carbon Markets

Carbon markets are significant tools in the fight
against climate change and must remain stable to
be effective. Under Forests for Climate, the price
of deforestation reduction units would be linked to
that of other units traded in carbon markets (or
generated through an auction), but the deforestation
units would not be directly and openly exchanged in
If cheap deforestation reduction credits
the markets.
were fully fungible with other carbon units, there is
a real risk they could “flood” or otherwise destabilise
the markets. This could bring down the price of
carbon, reducing incentives to invest in clean and
renewable energy technologies.

Tropical forests are not only threatened by logging
companies and agri-businesses, but by climate
change itself. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) has identified increases in
disturbances (such as droughts, insects and fire)
as climate related threats which could become
catastrophic if they cross critical thresholds.

Thus, efforts to end tropical deforestation must not
only address destructive land use activities, but also
recognise the need to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from the energy and industrial sectors.
Forests for Climate takes this approach.

The World is Waiting
At the UNFCCC conference in Bali, December
2007, the international community recognised the
need to address emissions from deforestation and
degradation for the first time. But with an area of
tropical forest the size of a football pitch being
destroyed every 2 seconds, there is still much more
to be done.

Around the world developing countries with tropical
forests are asking for funding to help them stop the
destruction of their forests. What’s been missing is
an internationally agreed plan to help these
countries protect their forests.

Forests for Climate offers the
solution. Now we need the political
will to make it a reality.

Greenpeace believes it is possible to keep the
worst impacts of climate change - such as extreme
weather events, water crises and increased hunger
- from putting millions more people at risk. In order
to stop dangerous climate change, global mean
temperature rise must be kept as far below 2ºC as
possible, compared to pre-industrial levels. To
achieve this we need a revolution in the ways we
use and produce energy, and an end to
deforestation worldwide. Governments must make
the necessary commitments at national and
international levels to give our planet a fighting
chance against climate change.
