The animal species that tend to dominate world aquaculture are
those at the lower end of the food chain – shellﬁsh, herbivorous ﬁsh(plant-eating) and omnivorous ﬁsh (eating both plants and animals),(see ﬁgure 2). For example, carp and shellﬁsh account for asigniﬁcant share of species cultivated for human consumption indeveloping countries

onPeopleandontheEnvironment
The following case studies of negative impacts of aquaculture are far
from exhaustive. Rather, they provide examples that illustrate the widespectrum of problems associated with aquacultural activities, andcast serious doubts on industry claims of sustainability.
2.1SHRIMP
DestructionofHabitat: The creation of ponds for marine shrimp
aquaculture has led to the destruction of thousands of hectares of
mangroves and coastal wetlands. Signiﬁcant losses of mangroveshave occurred in many countries including the Philippines
6, Vietnam7,
Thailand8, Bangladesh9and Ecuador10.
Mangroves are important because they support numerous marine aswell as terrestrial species, protect coastlines from storms and areimportant in the subsistence of many coastal communities.Mangroves provide nursery grounds for various young aquaticanimals including commercially important ﬁsh, and their destructioncan lead to substantial losses for commercial ﬁsheries
11,12.
CollectionofWildJuvenilesasStock
Aquaculture of some species relies on juvenile ﬁsh or shellﬁsh being
caught from the wild to stock culture ponds. For example, eventhough hatchery-raised shrimp constitute a major supply of shrimpjuveniles (scientiﬁcally called “postlarvae”) to the aquaculture industry,shrimp farms in many parts of the world are still based on wild-caughtjuveniles. Some natural stocks of shrimp are now over-exploited as aresult of juveniles collection from the wild
13,14. Furthermore, the
juvenile shrimp may only represent a small fraction of each catch, witha large incidental catch (by-catch) and mortality of other speciestaking place (see text box 1). This poses serious threats to regionalbiodiversity and reduces food available to other species such asaquatic birds and reptiles.ChemicalsusedtoControlDiseases
A wide variety of chemicals and drugs may be added to aquaculture
cages and ponds in order to control viral, bacterial, fungal or otherpathogens
16. There is a risk that such agents may harm aquatic life
nearby. The use of antibiotics also brings a potential risk to publichealth as over-use of these drugs can result in the development ofantibiotic-resistance in bacteria that cause disease in humans.Studies on shrimp farms in Vietnam
17and the Philippines18found
bacteria had acquired resistance to the antibiotics used on the farms.

22.
HumanRightsAbuses
The positioning of shrimp farms has often blocked access to coastal
areas that were once common land in use by many people. There isoften a lack of formalised land rights and entitlements in such areasand this has led to large scale displacement of communities, oftenwithout ﬁnancial compensation or alternative land made available onwhich to live (see text box 2).
Non-violent protests against the industry have frequently been
countered with threats and intimidation. According to theEnvironmental Justice Foundation
21, violence has frequently been
meted out by security personnel and “enforcers” associated with theshrimp industry, many protesters have been arrested on false chargesand there are even reports from at least 11 countries of protestersbeing murdered (see ﬁgure 3). (In Bangladesh alone there have beenan estimated 150 murders linked to aquaculture disputes.)Perpetrators of such violence are very rarely brought to justice. •In Bangladesh, for each tiger shrimp juvenile collected there were
12–551 shrimp larvae of other species caught and killed,together with 5–152 ﬁnﬁsh larvae and 26–1636macrozooplanktonic animals.
• In Honduras, the reported annual collection of 3.3 billion shrimp
juveniles resulted in the destruction of an estimated 15–20 billionfry of other species
13.
• In the Indian Sundarbans, tiger shrimp juveniles only account for
0.25–0.27% of the total catch. The rest of the catch containshuge numbers of juvenile ﬁnﬁsh and shellﬁsh which are left asideon the beach ﬂats to die

GreenpeaceInternational ChallengingtheAquacultureIndustryonSustainability 92.2SALMON
NutrientPollutionOrganic wastes from ﬁsh or crustacean farming include uneaten food,
body wastes and dead ﬁsh
24. In salmon farming, these wastes enter
the aquatic environment in the vicinity of the cages. In extreme casesthe large numbers of ﬁsh present in the cages can generate sufﬁcientwaste to cause oxygen levels in the water to fall, resulting in thesuffocation of both wild and farmed ﬁsh. More usually, the impacts ofintensive salmon culture are seen in a marked reduction in biodiversityaround the cages
25. For example, a study in Scotland found a
reduction in biodiversity on the seabed up to 200 metres away fromsalmon cages
26. In Chile, biodiversity close to eight salmon farms was
reduced by at least 50%. Wastes can also act as plant nutrients and,in areas where water circulation is restricted, these may also lead tothe rapid growth of certain species of phytoplankton (microscopicalgae) and ﬁlamentous algae
27. Some of the algal blooms which can
result are very harmful: they can cause the death of a range of marineanimals and also cause shellﬁsh poisoning in humans.

• Some Indonesian shrimp farms have been constructed following
forced land seizures in which companies, supported by policeand government agencies, provided either inappropriatecompensation or none at all. Such cases have been reportedfrom Sumatra, Maluku, Papua and Sulawesi.
• In Ecuador, reports indicate that there have been thousands of
forced land seizures, only 2% of which have been resolved on alegal basis. Tens of thousands of hectares of ancestral land haveallegedly been seized. This has often involved use of physicalforce and the deployment of military personnel
21.
• Between 1992-1998 in the Gulf of Fonseca, Honduras, many
coastal-dwelling people lost access to their traditional foodsources and access to ﬁshing sites because of encroachment onland by commercial shrimp-farming companies

onPeopleandontheEnvironment
ThreattoWildFishfromescapedFarmedSalmon
Farmed Atlantic salmon have a lower genetic variability than wild
Atlantic salmon28,29. Hence, if they interbreed with wild salmon, the
offspring may be less ﬁt than wild salmon and genetic variability that isimportant for adaptability in the wild may be lost. It was originallythought that escaped salmon would be less able to cope withconditions encountered in the wild and would be unable to survive,thereby not posing a threat to the genetic diversity of wildpopulations. In reality, the sheer numbers that have escaped (anestimated 3 million per year)
30mean that they are now breeding with
wild salmon in Norway, Ireland, the United Kingdom and NorthAmerica. Because they produce offspring less able to survive in thewild, this means that already vulnerable populations could be driventowards extinction. In Norway, farmed salmon have been estimated tocomprise 11–35% of the population of spawning salmon; for somepopulations this may rise to more than 80%
28. Continuing escapes
may mean that the original genetic proﬁle of the population will notre-assert itself
31.
In addition to threats to wild Atlantic salmon caused by escapees intheir native regions, farmed Atlantic salmon that have been introducedto Paciﬁc streams pose a threat to other native ﬁsh populations, suchas steelhead in North America and galaxiid ﬁshes in South America,because they compete for food and habitat
28.
DiseasesandParasites
Diseases and parasites can be particularly problematic in ﬁsh farming
where stocking densities are high. Wild populations of ﬁsh passingnear to farms may also be affected. One notable example is that ofparasitic sea lice which feed on salmon skin, mucous and blood andwhich can even cause the death of the ﬁsh. There is evidence thatwild salmon populations have been affected by lice spread from farmsin British Columbia
32and Norway31. Recent research in British
Columbia suggests that sea lice infestation resulting from farms willcause the local pink salmon populations to fall by 99% within theirnext four generations
33. If outbreaks continue unchecked, extinction is
almost certain.HumanRightsIssues
In southern Chile the salmonfarming industry hasgrown rapidly since
the late1980s to serveexport markets in western nations34,35. In 2005,
nearly 40% of the world’s farmedsalmonwas suppliedfrom Chileanproducersand processors
36.
This burgeoning industry has an appalling safety record. Poor or non-existent safety conditions have been widely reported on Chilean farmsand in processing plants
35,36. Over the past three years there have
been more than 50 accidental deaths, mostly of divers. By contrast,no deaths have been reported in the Norwegian salmon industry, theworld’s largest producer of salmon
37. Reports from Chile also tell of
low wages (around the national poverty line), long working hours, lackof respect for maternity rights and persistent sexual harassment ofwomen
35,36.
2.3OTHERMARINEFINFISH
Marine ﬁnﬁsh aquaculture is an emerging industry. Improvements in
the technology of salmon farming together with decreasing marketprices for salmon have inspired the industry to start farming higher-value marine ﬁnﬁsh species. Species which are now being farmedinclude (1) Atlantic cod in Norway, UK, Canada and Iceland; (2)haddock in Canada, Norway and northeastern United States; (3)Paciﬁc threadﬁn in Hawaii; (4) black sableﬁsh under development inBritish Columbia and Washington State; (5) mutton snapper; (6)Atlantic halibut; (7) turbot; (8) sea bass and (9) sea bream
5,28. Most
species are reared in net pens or cages like salmon, although Atlantichalibut and turbot are generally farmed in tanks on land.
It is likely that environmental problems similar to those encountered in
salmon farming will also manifest themselves in the farming of these“new” marine species in cages. In some cases they could be worse.For example, cod produce considerably more waste than Atlanticsalmon
28leading to potential nutrient pollution. Even if the impacts of
this can be reduced by siting cages some distance offshore wherewater movements are more vigorous, other impacts are still likely toresult. As in the case of salmon aquaculture, these include a risk ofdisease spreading to wild populations and, if selectively bred, there isa risk of escapees competing with wild ﬁsh and interbreeding withthem, causing a reduction in genetic variability.
2.4TUNARANCHING–WIPINGOUTBLUEFINTUNAINTHE
MEDITERRANEANSEA
The present level of ﬁshing effort directed at northern blueﬁn tuna in
the Mediterranean threatens the future of this species in the regionand the future of hundreds of ﬁshermen. There are serious concernsthat commercial extinction of the species may be just around thecorner
38.

GreenpeaceInternational ChallengingtheAquacultureIndustryonSustainability 11In May 1999, Greenpeace released a report describing the depletion
of blueﬁn tuna in the Mediterranean39. This noted that the spawning
stock biomass (total weight) of tuna was estimated to have decreasedby 80% over the previous 20 years. In addition, huge amounts ofjuvenile tuna were being caught every season. Greenpeace reportedthat the main threat to the blueﬁn tuna at that time was Illegal,Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) ﬁshing, also called “pirate ﬁshing”.IUU ﬁshing operates outside of management and conservation rulesand, in effect, steals ﬁsh from the oceans. It has become a seriousand wide-ranging global problem, is a threat to marine biodiversityand a serious obstacle to achieving sustainable ﬁsheries
40,41.
Seven years on in 2006, further analysis by Greenpeace showed thatthreats to the tuna had worsened
38. Pirate ﬁshing continued
unabated, and was now fuelled by a new incentive of supplying tunato an increasing number of tuna ranches in Mediterranean countries.
In tuna ranching, ﬁsh are caught alive and grown on in cages with
artiﬁcial feeding. The fattened ﬁsh are then killed and exported, mainlyto Japan. Tuna ranching began in the late 1990s and has boomed,spreading to 11 countries by 2006 (see ﬁgure 4). Today, due to poormanagement of tuna ﬁsheries, nobody knows the exact numbers oftuna taken from the Mediterranean Sea each year. Nonetheless, it isclear that current catch levels are well above the legal quota. Forexample, it was estimated, based on 2005 ﬁgures, that over 44,000tonnes of tuna may have been caught in the Mediterranean. This was37.5% over the legally sanctioned catch limit and, disturbingly, almost70% above the scientiﬁcally recommended maximum catch level. Thetotal capacity of the tuna ranches exceeds the total allowable catchquotas which exist to supply them. This is a clear incentive for illegalﬁshing in the region. An examination of available trends in the industryclearly indicates that illegal ﬁshing for tuna is supplying ranches
38.2.5TILAPIA
IntroductionofAlienSpeciesWhen a species is released into an environment where is it not native,
it may reproduce successfully but have negative consequences onnative species
42. Tilapia species provide a striking illustration of the
problems that such releases can cause. Three species of tilapia arethe most important in aquaculture: the Nile tilapia, the Mozambiquetilapia and the blue tilapia
43. These freshwater ﬁsh are native to Africa
and the Middle East but over the past 30 years their use inaquaculture has expanded and they are now farmed in about 85countries worldwide. Presently, tilapia are second only to carp as thequantitatively most important farmed ﬁsh in the world
44. Tilapia have
escaped from sites where they are cultured into the widerenvironment, have successfully invaded new habitats andconsequently have become a widely distributed exotic species.
Once in a non-native environment, tilapia threaten native ﬁsh by
feeding on their juveniles as well as on plants that are habitat refugesfor juveniles. Negative impacts of tilapia invasions into non-nativeregions have been widely reported and include:
1the decline of an endangered ﬁsh species in Nevada and Arizona,
2the decline of a native ﬁsh in Madagascar,
3the decline of native cichlid species in Nicaragua and in Kenya, and
4the breeding of escaped tilapia in Lake Chichincanab, Mexico to
become the dominant species
44at the cost of the native ﬁsh
populations.

12GreenpeaceInternational ChallengingtheAquacultureIndustryStandardsonSustainability

GreenpeaceInternational ChallengingtheAquacultureonSustainability 13Fishmeal and ﬁsh oil used in aquaculture feeds are largely derived
from small oily ﬁsh such as anchovies, herrings and sardines (largersardines are also known as pilchards), taken in the so-called“industrial ﬁsheries”. As aquaculture methods have intensiﬁed, therehas been a growing dependence on ﬁshmeal/oil as a feed source.The farming of carnivorous species in particular is highly dependenton the use of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil, in synthetic diets used to simulatenatural prey taken as food in the wild.

UnsustainableFisheries….
Many global marine ﬁsheries are currently exploited in an
unsustainable manner, and this includes industrial ﬁsheries. Concernsextend to other marine species because ﬁsh taken by industrialﬁshers play a vital role in marine ecosystems. They are prey for manyother ﬁsh species (including commercially important species), marinemammals and sea birds. Overﬁshing of industrially ﬁshed species hasled to negative impacts on the breeding success of some seabirds(see text box 3).A speciﬁc assessment of several important industrially ﬁshed speciesconcluded that, for the most part, the ﬁsheries were entirelyunsustainable
47. Other research has shown that the ﬁsheries must be
regarded as fully exploited or over-exploited48,49. Consequently, there
is a crucial need for aquaculture to reduce its dependence onﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil.
DemandsforFishmealandFishOilinAquaculture…..
The quantity of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil used by the aquaculture industry
has increased over the years as aquaculture has expanded andintensiﬁed. In 2003, the industry used 53% of the total world’sﬁshmeal production and 86% of the world’s ﬁsh oil production
5,52. The
increased demand for ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil by aquaculture has beenmet by diverting these products away from their use as feed foragricultural animals, in itself a controversial issue. Currently,agricultural use of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil is increasingly restricted tostarter and breeder diets for poultry and pigs. Fish oil previously usedin the manufacture of hard margarines and bakery products has nowbeen largely diverted to aquacultural use
53. Figure 5 depicts the
estimated global use of ﬁshmeal within compound aquafeeds in 2003by major species.
Although a trend has emerged in recent years of replacing ﬁshmeal
with plant-based proteins in aquaculture feeds, the fraction ofﬁshmeal/oil used for diets of carnivorous species remains high.Moreover, this trend has not been fast enough to offset the growinguse of ﬁshmeal, caused simply by an increase in the overall number offarmed carnivorous ﬁsh produced. For example, the quantity of wildﬁsh required as feed to produce one unit of farmed salmon reducedby 25% between 1997 and 2001, but the total production of farmedsalmon grew by 60%
5, eclipsing much of the improvement in
conversion efﬁciencies.

inAquacultureFeedsandAssociatedProblems
FoodSecurityIssues….
The use of ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil derived from marine species of ﬁsh for
aquaculture also has implications for human food security. Forexample, in Southeast Asia and Africa, small pelagic (open water) ﬁshsuch as those targeted by industrial ﬁsheries are important in thehuman diet
54. Demand for such ﬁsh is likely to grow as populations
increase, bringing them under pressure both from aquaculture anddirect consumption
55. In addition, low value ﬁsh (inappropriately
termed “trash ﬁsh”) caught as by-catch and used for ﬁshmealproduction are actually an important food source for poorer people indeveloping countries
56. Use of “trash ﬁsh” in aquaculture inﬂates
prices such that the rural poor can no longer afford to buy it52. With
these factors in mind, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization(FAO) has recommended that governments of major aquaculture-producing countries prohibit the use of “trash ﬁsh” as feed for theculture of high value ﬁsh.

GreenpeaceInternational ChallengingtheAquacultureIndustryonSustainability 15The aquaculture industry is highly dependent upon wild caught ﬁsh to
manufacture feed for cultured species. This is widely recognised as anintensive and generally unsustainable use of a ﬁnite resource. In turn,the industry has recognised the need to evaluate and use more plant-based feed materials and reduce dependence on ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil.
Plants are already used in aquaculture feeds. Those that are used
and/or show particular promise for the future include soybean, barley,canola, corn, cottonseed and pea/lupin
57. It is important to note that if
plant-based feeds are used in aquaculture, to be sustainable theymust be sourced from agriculture that is sustainable. Sustainableagriculture by deﬁnition precludes the use of any genetically modiﬁedcrops. These crops are associated with a number of potentialenvironmental impacts, genetic contamination of non-GE crops andhave also sparked a number of food-safety concerns which remainunresolved
58.
For some herbivorous and omnivorous ﬁsh, it has been possible toreplace completely any ﬁshmeal in the diet with plant-basedfeedstuffs without impacts on ﬁsh growth and yield
52. Rearing such
species in this way suggests a more sustainable future path foraquaculture provided that the feeds themselves are producedthrough sustainable agriculture.Feeding of carnivorous species seems to be more problematic.Fishmeal and ﬁsh oil can be reduced by at least 50% in the diet, butcomplete substitution for plant ingredients has not yet been possiblefor commercial production. Problems include the presence of certaincompounds in plants that are not favourable to ﬁsh, known as anti-nutritional factors, and the lack of certain essential (omega-3) fattyacids
29,52. Oily ﬁsh is considered to be an important source of omega-
3 fatty acids in human nutrition, but feeding ﬁsh with plant oil-baseddiets alone reduces the amount in their ﬂesh. Recent research,however, has found that the ﬁsh oil input could be reduced by feedingﬁsh with plant oils but switching to ﬁsh oils in the period just prior toslaughter
59. Recent research on marine shrimp suggests that it may
be possible to replace ﬁshmeal in the diet largely with plant-basedingredients, although further study is needed
60,61.
Some aquaculture, particularly that classiﬁed as “organic”, uses ﬁshtrimmings as feed – offcuts of ﬁsh from the ﬁlleting and processing ofﬁsh for human consumption. This is more sustainable than usingnormal ﬁshmeal in that a waste product is being used. However,unless the ﬁshery from which the ﬁsh trimmings come from is itselfsustainable, the use of ﬁsh trimmings cannot be seen as sustainablebecause it perpetuates the cycle of over-exploitation of ﬁsheries.

16GreenpeaceInternational ChallengingtheAquacultureIndustryonSustainabilityIn order for aquaculture operations to move towards sustainable
production, the industry needs to recognise and address the fullspectrum of environmental and societal impacts caused by itsoperations. Essentially, this means that it will no longer be acceptablefor the industry to place burdens of production, (such as the disposalof waste) onto the wider environment.
In turn, this implies moving towards closed production systems. For
example, in order to prevent nutrient pollution, ways can be found touse nutrients present in waste products beneﬁcially. Examples includeintegrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) (see text box 4),aquaponics and integrated rice-ﬁsh culture. In aquaponics systems, efﬂuents from ﬁsh farming are used as anutrient source for growing vegetables, herbs and/or ﬂowers. Oneexisting commercially viable aquaponics system involves thecultivation of tilapia in land-based tanks from which the waste water isused to grow vegetables (without soil) in greenhouses
65. A company
in the Netherlands called ‘Happy Shrimp’ partially use waste fromtheir farms to grow vegetables. The shrimp are fed on algae andbacteria as well as on aquaculture feed containing a high proportionof plant protein. The shrimp are cultivated in greenhousesand no shrimp juveniles are extracted from the wild
66.
In integrated rice–ﬁsh culture, ﬁsh are cultivated alongside rice, whichoptimises use of both land and water. The nitrogen-rich ﬁsh excretoryproducts fertilise the rice, and the ﬁsh also control weeds and pestsby consuming them as food. Much of the ﬁsh nutrition is derivednaturally in this way. Major constraints to widespread use of suchmethods include the fact that many farmers are not educated in therequired skills
67. This could be overcome if policy makers gave active
support to this practice. Integrated rice–ﬁsh culture is crucial for localfood security rather than for supplying export markets.In IMTA systems, organic waste products from the fed species(ﬁnﬁsh or shrimp) are used as food by other cultivated speciessuch as seaweed and shellﬁsh. For example, at a commercial IMTAfarm in Israel, marine ﬁsh (gilthead seabream) are farmed and theirnutrient-rich waste is used to grow seaweed. In turn, the seaweedis used to feed Japanese abalone which can be soldcommercially
62. In other systems being developed, the seaweed
itself may be commercially viable63,64.Box4Integratedmulti-trophicaquaculturesystems(IMTA)

The growth of aquaculture has led to a multiplicity of concerns
attached to environmental impacts, social impacts, food safety,animal health and welfare and economic/ﬁnancial issues. All of thesefactors inﬂuence the sustainability of a given aquaculture system.Presently, there are a growing number of certiﬁcation schemes whichseek to reassure buyers, retailers and consumers about various ofthese concerns. Currently existing certiﬁcation schemes, however, donot cover all of these issues and can sometimes present a confusingand conﬂicting picture to retailers and consumers. A recent analysis of18 aquaculture certiﬁcation schemes by the World Wildlife Fund(WWF) showed that they generally had major shortcomings in termsof the way in which they considered environmental standards andsocial issues
68.The WWF report sets out benchmark criteria on environmental,social and animal welfare issues in aquaculture. The FAO has alsorecently published a document which covers many of the relevantissues and could be used as a guide by certification bodies
69. Any
certification process, as an absolute minimum, needs to conform tothese FAO guidelines. Nonetheless, certification criteria alone willnot ensure the sustainability of the aquaculture industry worldwide.In order to do so, a more fundamental rethink and restructuring ofthe industry is essential.

Any aquaculture that takes place needs to be sustainable and fair.
For aquaculture systems to be sustainable, they must not lead tonatural systems being subject to degradation caused by:
1an increase in concentrations of naturally occurring substances,
2an increase in concentrations of substances, produced by society,
such as persistent chemicals and carbon dioxide and
3physical disturbance.
In addition people should not be subject to conditions thatsystematically undermine their capacity to meet their basic needs forfood, water and shelter.
In practical terms, these four conditions can be translated into the
following recommendations:
UseofFishmeal,Fishoiland“TrashFish”: To reduce the
pressure on stocks caught for ﬁshmeal and ﬁsh oil, there needs to be
a continued move towards sustainably produced plant-based feeds.Cultivating ﬁsh that are lower down the food chain (herbivores andomnivores rather than top predators) that can be fed on plant-baseddiets is key to achieving sustainable aquaculture practices. Industrymust expand its research and development on herbivorous andomnivorous ﬁsh which have strong market potential and suitabilityfor farming.
In more general terms, there is an urgent need for ﬁsheries
management to shift towards an ecosystem-based approach whereina global network of fully protected marine reserves covering 40% ofthe oceans is established together with sustainable ﬁsheriesmanagement outside of the reserves
70. This is key to achieving
sustainable ﬁsheries.

NutrientPollutionandChemicalPollution: To reduce nutrient
wastes, there is great potential for the development of integrated
multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems, aquaponics and integratedrice-ﬁsh culture.
Greenpeaceconsidersaquaculturethatresultsinnegative
environmentalimpactsintermsofdischarges/efﬂuentstothesurroundingenvironmentasunsustainable.EscapesofFarmedFishtotheWild: To overcome these problems
it has been suggested that enclosed bag nets/closed wall sea pensshould be used to prevent ﬁsh from escaping, or that land-basedtanks should be used
5. Ultimately, land-based tanks are the only
option if the goal is to eliminate any risk of escapes which mightotherwise occur as a result of hurricanes or other extreme weatherevents at sea. It is crucial to use native rather than exotic species
42.
Greenpeacerecommendsthatonlyspecieswhicharenativeshouldbecultivatedinopenwatersystems,andthenonlyinbagnets,closedwallseapensorequivalentclosedsystems.Cultivationofnon-nativespeciesshouldberestrictedtoland-basedtanks.
ProtectionofLocalHabitat: Some aquaculture practices have had
serious negative impacts on local habitat. Aquaculture practices must
be set up in a way that provides for the protection of coastalecosystems and local habitats. In addition, no new aquaculturepractices should be permitted in areas that are to be designated asmarine reserves and any existing aquaculture operations within suchareas should be phased out.
Greenpeaceconsidersaquaculturewhichcausesnegativeeffectsto
localwildlife(plantsaswellasanimals)orrepresentsarisktolocalwildpopulationsasunsustainable.
UseofWildJuveniles: The use of wild-caught juveniles to supply
aquaculture practices, particularly some shrimp aquaculture, is
destructive to marine ecosystems.
Greenpeaceconsidersaquaculturewhichreliesonwild-caught
juvenilesasunsustainable.
TransgenicFish: The physical containment of genetically engineered
ﬁsh cannot be guaranteed under commercial conditions and any
escapes into the environment could have devastating effects on wildﬁsh populations and biodiversity
71.
Greenpeacedemandsthatgeneticengineeringofﬁshforcommercialpurposesshouldbeprohibited.
Diseases: Greenpeace recommends cultivation at stocking densities
that minimise the risk of disease outbreaks and transmission and,
therefore, minimise requirements for therapeutic treatments.
