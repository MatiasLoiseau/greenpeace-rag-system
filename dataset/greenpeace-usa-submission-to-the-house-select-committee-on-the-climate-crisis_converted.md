Greenpeace   USA   appreciates   the   opportunity   to   inform   the   House   Select   Committee   on   the
Climate   Crisis’s   recommendations   for   comprehensive,   ambitious,   and   equitable   legislation   to
address   the   climate   crisis.

The   climate   crisis   is   here.   At   1.0°C   of   warming,   wildﬁres,   storms,   etc.   are   putting   millions   of
people’s   lives   and   livelihoods   under   threat   —   including   across   the   U.S.,   from   Houston,   to
Iowa,   to   California.   Indigenous   communities,   communities   of   color,   low-wealth   families,   and
other   vulnerable   and   marginalized   communities   are   disproportionately   affected.   Limiting
global   temperature   rise   to   1.5°C,   as   articulated   in   the   Paris   Agreement   goals   and
Intergovernmental   Panel   on   Climate   Change   (IPCC),   is   critical   to   protect   communities   and
ecosystems   around   the   world,   enhance   justice   and   prosperity   for   all   people,   and   provide   a
greater   chance   of   avoiding   potentially   catastrophic   and   irreversible   “tipping   points”   in   the
global   climate   system. ,    In   addition,   numerous   current   and   former   U.S.   ofﬁcials   have   called
for   action   on   the   climate   crisis   to   maintain   a   “healthy,   stable   economy”   and   protect   U.S.
national   security.   10

The   scale   of   the   climate   crisis   demands   just,   inclusive,   and   transformative   action   from
Congress   —   a   Green   New   Deal.    Not   only   is   a   just   and   inclusive   Green   New   Deal   imperative
to   stave   off   the   worst   impacts   of   the   climate   crisis,   it   will   also   afford   Congress   an   historic
opportunity   to   address   the   interlocking   crises   of   climate   change,   economic   inequality,   and

racial   and   environmental   injustices   affecting   millions   of   Americans   and   bring   the   U.S.   into   a
green   and   prosperous   21st   Century   future   — while   establishing   U.S.   leadership   on   the   world
stage   in   responding   to   the   threat   of   the   climate   emergency.

Greenpeace   USA   urges   Congress   to   enact   a   Green   New   Deal   that   will   mobilize   the   federal
government   and   U.S.   economy   to:

1. Rapidly   reduce   U.S.   greenhouse   gas   (GHG)   emissions   by   at   least   50%   by   2030   and   to

near-zero   well   before   2050,   in   line   with   the   U.S.’s   “fair   share”   of   global   GHG
emission   reductions   required   to   limit   warming   to   1.5°C;   12
Invest   in   100%   renewable   energy   and   low-carbon,   climate-resilient   infrastructure   for
the   21st   Century;

3. Transform   the   U.S.   from   an   extractive   economy   to   a   regenerative   and   inclusive   one;
4. Create   millions   of   family-sustaining,   union   jobs;   and
5. Prioritize   justice,   equity,   and   self-determination   for   workers   and   frontline   and

Indigenous   communities   in   the   transition   away   from   fossil   fuels.

Furthermore,   in   order   to   maximize   the   beneﬁts   of   a   Green   New   Deal,    Greenpeace   USA
urges   Congress   to   enact   legislation   to   halt   expansion   and   facilitate   a   managed   phaseout
of   coal,   oil,   and   gas   production   that   prioritizes   vulnerable   workers,   families,   and
communities,   including   communities   of   color   and   low-wealth   communities,   in   the
transition   to   a   regenerative,   100%   renewable   economy.

Existing   coal,   oil,   and   gas   mines   and   ﬁelds   (“developed   reserves”)   already   contain   enough
potential   CO2   emissions   to   push   the   world   beyond   1.5°C   of   warming.    Yet,   rather   than
halting   new   fossil   fuel   development   and   transitioning   to   alternative   sources   of   energy,   fossil
fuel   companies   are   investing   more   than   $1   trillion   in   North   America   alone   in   new   wells,
mines,   pipelines,   and   other   fossil   fuel   infrastructure   projects    —   a   reckless   expansion   of
fossil   fuel   production   that   is   incompatible   with   meeting   climate   goals   under   the   Paris
Agreement.   15

This   planned   fossil   fuel   expansion   risks   “locking   in”   new   coal,   oil,   and   gas   infrastructure   that
could   commit   us   to   climate   chaos,   economic   chaos,   or   both.  ,    On   the   other   hand,   taking

action   now   to   constrain   and   wind   down   U.S.   fossil   fuel   production   (so-called   “supply-side”
climate   policy   approaches)   will   provide   a   better   chance   at   meeting   the   Paris   Agreement
goals   and   maximize   the   climate,   economic,   and   social   beneﬁts   of   U.S.   “demand-side”   efforts
to   transition   to   100%   clean   energy   and   decarbonize   end-use   sectors   of   the   economy.    18

As   part   of   a   Green   New   Deal,   Congress   must   take   swift   action   to:

1. Halt   U.S.   fossil   fuel   expansion,   including   by   eliminating   U.S.   federal   support   for
fossil   fuel   production,   and   leverage   U.S.   global   leadership   to   end   fossil   fuel
expansion   worldwide;

2. Manage   the   phaseout   of   existing   fossil   fuel   production   and   infrastructure

consistent   with   emission   reduction   and   clean   energy   deployment   trajectories   to
limit   warming   to   1.5°C;   and

3. Prioritize   federal   investments   in   a   justice-based   transition   for   workers   and

communities   in   fossil   fuel   and   other   emissions-intensive   industries   and   at   the
frontlines   of   climate   disasters   and   toxic   pollution.

In   the   following   sections,   we   further   lay   out   the   imperatives —   grounded   in   the   latest
climate   science,   economic   modeling,   and   principles   for   racial,   economic,   and   environmental
justice   —    for   Congress   to   secure   a   managed   phaseout   of   fossil   fuel   production   and
empower   historically   disadvantaged   workers   and   communities   in   transition   under   a   Green
New   Deal,   and   lay   out   detailed   policy   recommendations   for   Congress   to   achieve   these   aims.

2.   Fossil   fuel   “supply-side”   policies   are   essential   to
address   the   climate   crisis.

Over   the   past   three   decades,   policies   intended   to   reduce   harmful   GHG   emissions   focused
primarily   on   mitigating   demand   for   and   consumption   of   fossil   fuels,   such   as   reducing
emissions   from   industrial   smokestacks   or   vehicle   tailpipes,   while   growing   clean   and
renewable   energy   alternatives.   These   policies   include   EPA   GHG   regulations,   carbon   pricing,
cap   and   trade   schemes,   energy   efﬁciency   standards,   clean   energy   tax   incentives,   and   vehicle
mileage   standards.   However,   these   policies   alone   have   not   succeeded   in   reducing   GHG
emissions   at   the   pace   the   IPCC   has   shown   is   necessary   to   afford   the   world   a   decent   chance
at   limiting   global   temperature   rise   to   below   1.5°C   above   pre-Industrial   levels.

In   order   to   effectively   address   the   climate   crisis   and   protect   the   Indigenous   communities,
communities   of   color,   and   low-wealth   families   who   are   most   at   risk   from   the   dangerous
impacts   of   climate   change,   we   must   rapidly   slash   GHG   emissions   in   line   with   the   IPCC’s   best
available   science.   This   means   utilizing   the   full   extent   of   our   policy   toolkit.   A   growing   body

of   research   and   results-driven   policies   implemented   around   the   world   makes   the   case   that
fossil   fuel   “supply-side”   policies   —   policies   to   directly   limit   the   production   and   supply   of   oil,
gas,   and   coal   — are   an   essential   part   of   any   suite   of   actions   Congress   takes   to   stave   off   the
worst   impacts   of   the   climate   crisis.   Often   called   "cutting   with   both   sides   of   the   scissors,"
fossil   fuel   supply-side   policies   can   complement   Congress’s   “demand-side”   efforts   to   reduce
fossil   fuel   demand   and   consumption.   19

We   can   estimate   emissions   embedded   in   fossil   fuel   reserves,   and   thus   estimate   additional
climate   changes   that   would   occur   if   fossil   fuel   producers   continue   to   extract   and   produce
unburned   coal,   oil,   and   gas.   The   amount   of   fossil   fuels   that   producers   can   extract   and   burn
before   breaching   the   1.5   global   temperature   limit   is   ﬁnite.   20

21

An   analysis   from   Oil   Change   International   revealed   that   GHG   emissions   embedded   in   the
world’s   currently   operating   coal   mines,   oil,   and   gas   ﬁelds   are   enough   to   send   global   warming
well   past   1.5°C,   and   even   beyond   the   2°C   limit   countries   agreed   to   meet   in   the   Paris
Agreement.    Yet   rather   than   taking   steps   to   move   beyond   fossil   fuels,   governments   continue
to    expand    fossil   fuel   production.   A   recent   report   estimating   the   global   fossil   fuel   “production
gap”   found   that   worldwide,   governments   are   planning   to   produce   120%   more   fossil   fuels   by
2030   than   would   be   consistent   with   limiting   warming   to   1.5°C.    These   conclusions   should
shock   policymakers:   Congress   must   act   to   ensure   that   vast   swaths   of   fossil   fuel   reserves
remain   safely   in   the   ground.    23

22

Reality   Check

The   U.S.   is   now   the   world’s   largest   fossil   fuel   producer.   U.S.   oil   and   gas   companies   are
expanding   production   at   four   times   the   rate   of   other   countries   and   could   account   for   60
percent   of   global   oil   and   gas   production   growth   by   2030.    Oil   and   gas   production   exploded
by   85   percent   between   2010   and   2018.    The   U.S.   now   produces   more   oil   than   Saudi   Arabia

and   more   natural   gas   than   Russia.   All   signs   indicate   that,   left   unchecked,   the   industry
intends   to   extract   and   burn   all   known   oil   and   gas   reserves   without   regard   for   the   impact
their   actions   will   have   on   billions   of   people   facing   climate   catastrophe.

Recent   reporting   reveals   that   companies   are   projected   to   spend   $4.9   trillion   over   the   next
ten   years   on   exploration   and   extraction   of   new   fossil   fuel   reserves    —   almost   all   of   which   is
irreconcilable   with   IPCC   scenarios   to   limit   dangerous   climate   impacts.   In   addition   to
increased   production   for   electric   power   and   transportation   fuels,   the   International   Energy
Agency   (IEA)   projects   that   petrochemical   (including   plastic)   production   could   account   for
more   than   a   third   of   oil   demand   growth   to   2030    —   posing   yet   another   enormous   threat   to
the   climate   due   to   high   GHG   emissions   from   the   plastic   production   lifecycle.    This   is   part   of
a   ”lock-in”   design   by   the   fossil   fuel   industry   —   and   essentially   a   massive   bet   by   the
industry   that   the   world   will   fail   to   safeguard   a   liveable   climate.

The   Lock-in   Effect

29

New   investments   in   fossil   fuel   infrastructure   made   today   can   encourage   greater   future   fossil
fuel   demand   and   “lock   in”   future   emissions.   Emissions   lock-in   can   occur   as   a   result   of
investments   in   leases,   mines,   wells,   pipelines,   as   well   as   downstream   infrastructure   such   as
reﬁneries   and   power   plants.    Such   projects   often   require   high   upfront   investments   that   can
only   be   recouped   over   a   multi-decade   lifetime.   The   risk   of   emissions   lock-in   is   that   once
the   upfront   investments   are   made,   it   can   be   more   difﬁcult   —   from   an   economic,   legal   and
political   standpoint   —   to   phase   out   production   in   the   timeframe   necessary   to   ensure   a
stable   climate.    The   incentive   to   recover   the   initial   investment   can   facilitate   continued
production,   even   if   demand   and   proﬁt   margins   fall   in   the   future.    Continuing   to   invest   in
fossil   fuel   infrastructure   in   the   near   term   will   signiﬁcantly   raise   the   future   costs   of   reaching
our   climate   targets   because,   as   the   IEA   notes,   “much   more   costly   actions   are   required
subsequently   to   undo   the   lock-in   effect.”   32

The   New   York   Times   recently   reported   on   a   coming   wave   of   oil   production   from   global
extraction   projects   that   highlights   the   lock-in   effect:

“Production   of   more   oil   comes   at   a   time   when   there   is   growing   acknowledgment   by
governments   and   energy   investors   that   not   all   the   hydrocarbons   in   the   ground   can
be   tapped   if   climate   change   is   to   be   controlled.   But   exploration   decisions,   made
years   ago,   have   a   momentum   that   can   be   hard   to   stop.

“Legacy   decisions   keep   going,”   said   John   Browne,   BP’s   former   chief   executive.
“Things   happen   in   different   directions   because   decisions   are   made   at   different
times.”   33

Reducing   Emissions   Leakage   by   Constraining   Fossil   Fuel   Supply

When   demand-side   levers   are   not   paired   with   actions   to   curtail   production,   it   can   create   a
leakage   effect   when   “sources   outside   the   scope   of   a   GHG   emissions   reduction   system
34
increase   emissions   as   a   result   of   that   system.”    This   happens   when   capital   investment   ﬂows
to   where   fossil   fuels   are   not   constrained   and   production   rates   can   adjust   to   make   up   the
difference.

Original   Greenpeace   USA   research   ﬁnds   that   if   no   action   is   taken   to   address   the   climate
impacts   of   fossil   fuel   production,   then   a   signiﬁcant   fraction   of   emissions   reductions
achieved   by   policies   to   reduce   demand   for   fossil   fuels   could   be   wiped   out.    If   the   U.S.   is
successful   at   reducing   domestic   consumption   of   oil   but   does   not   stem   the   boom   in
domestic   oil   production,   then   the   surplus   oil   will   be   exported   and   burned   overseas.   These
surplus   oil   exports   will   increase   carbon   emissions   beyond   our   borders,   counteracting   roughly
half   of   any   domestic   emissions   reductions.   Coupling   demand   and   supply   policies   together   is
the   optimal   way   to   bring   fossil   fuel   emissions   trajectories   downward   and   an   approach   the
federal   government   has   not   implemented   in   earnest   yet.

Political   Economy

The   economics   of   the   energy   transition   are   not   separate   from   politics.   We   have   many
solutions   in   hand,   but   the   barriers   to   far   more   ambitious   and   immediate   climate   action   are
largely   political   and   the   fossil   fuel   industry   has   been   the   single   biggest   obstacle   to   taking
those   actions.   Between   2000   and   2016,   the   fossil   fuel   industry   spent   over   $2   billion   to   kill

climate   legislation.    Companies   including   Exxon,   ConocoPhillips   and   Chevron   spent   $143
million   in   2009   alone   to   defeat   the   last   U.S.   attempt   to   enact   major   economy-wide   federal
climate   legislation.   37

Meanwhile,   these   companies   have   launched   new   advertising   campaigns   touting   their   limited
renewable   energy   investments   and   focusing   on   individual   actions   to   save   energy.   These
public   relations   efforts   distract   from   their   continued   lobbying   efforts   to   weaken   climate
policy   proposals   and   expand   fossil   fuel   production.   Allowing   oil   companies   to   set   the
conditions   around   acceptable   climate   policy   is   a   recipe   for   a   disastrous   4-degree   future.

We   take   the   history   of   climate   politics   seriously   and   recognize   the   power   dynamics   between
industry   and   policymakers.   As   such,   we   believe   that   policies   that   challenge   the   concentrated
political   power   of   the   industry   are   best   positioned   to   deliver   desired   results.   A   focus   on
fossil   fuel   extraction   can   grab   public   attention,   build   support   for   climate   action   among
communities   concerned   about   the   industry’s   effects   on   public   health   and   the   environment,
and   increase   momentum   for   climate   policy,   creating   the   conditions   for   a   swift   and   massive
shift   towards   a   clean   energy   future.    Fossil   fuels   are   more   “tangible”   than   emissions   and
past   experience   and   research   indicates   this   helps   draw   more   public   support.   39

38

Supply-side,   more   so   than   only   demand   centric   policies,   can   help   shift   the   “moral   norms”
around   fossil   fuel   extraction   and   build   social   movements   to   support   policymakers   who
present   ambitious   timelines   to   transition   to   a   clean   energy   economy.    Focusing   on
extraction   and   production   can   also   help   delegitimize   the   oil   and   gas   industry,   which   has   no
history   of   acting   in   good   faith   when   it   comes   to   addressing   the   climate   crisis.   41

In   addition,   successful   policies   in   one   region   can   help   create   conditions   to   advance   similar
fossil   fuel   phase   outs   elsewhere:   “As   the   number   of   states   banning   an   activity   rises,   the

U.S.   Leadership   Towards   a   Zero-Carbon   Future

The   U.S.   has   an   opportunity   to   lead   the   world   in   executing   policies   which   intentionally
constrain   the   ﬂow   of   fossil   fuels   into   the   economy.   The   U.S.   is   the   world’s   largest   historic
emitter   of   climate   pollution,   and   the   largest   producer   of   fossil   fuels.   Coupled   with   U.S.
responsibilities   under   principles   of   global   equity   enshrined   in   the   United   Nations   Framework
Convention   on   Climate   Change   (UNFCCC)   charter   and   the   Paris   Agreement,   means   the   U.S.
had   an   obligation   to   lead   the   transition   away   from   fossil   fuels   and   lend   our   ﬁnancial   and
technological   resources   to   expedite   the   transition   globally.

43

Recent   work   to   develop   a   set   of   principles   to   guide   the   U.S.   transition   away   from   fossil   fuels
further   points   to   the   U.S.’s   natural   leadership   role.    The   federal   government   has   considerable
inﬂuence   over   fossil   fuel   production   on   public   lands,   and   Congressional   actions   to   eliminate
fossil   fuel   subsidies   and   halt   new   fossil   fuel   infrastructure   permitting   and   leasing   present
opportunities   for   immediate   progress.   As   any   phaseout   of   fossil   fuel   production   must   be
grounded   in   justice,   equity,   Indigenous   sovereignty,   human   rights,   and   resilience   and
self-determination   of   local   communities,   the   world’s   largest   economy   is   ideally   positioned   to
lead   this   work.

44

Paradoxically,   the   climate   policy   approach   that   dominates   policy-making   spaces   today   —
focused   mainly   on   demand   side   levers   —   will   deliver   a   future   where   the   emissions   from
expanded   oil   and   gas   production   in   the   US   will   increase   nearly   70   percent   over   the   next   ten
years   compared   to   2017   levels.    Oil   companies   can   well   be   expected   to   return   proﬁts   from
these   operations   back   into   additional   expansion   projects   and   into   renewed   lobbying   efforts
that   aim   to   stymie   meaningful   climate   action.   Given   the   reality   of   the   climate   crisis   and
limits   of   the   global   carbon   budget,   and   the   moral   imperatives   to   secure   justice   and
prosperity   for   communities   at   the   frontlines   of   climate   disasters   and   fossil   fuel   pollution,
Congress   must   take   meaningful   action   to   manage   a   phaseout   of   fossil   fuel   production   by
deploying   a   full   suite   of   “supply-side”   climate   policies.

3.   A   managed   phaseout   of   fossil   fuel   production   is
necessary   to   protect   vulnerable   workers   and
communities.

The   transition   to   a   100%   renewable,   regenerative   economy   through   a   Green   New   Deal   is   a
massive   challenge,   and   involves   complex   mechanisms   of   industrial   policy,   economic   and
ﬁscal   policy,   foreign   policy,   and   social   equity,   inclusion,   and   justice.   Congress   and   the   U.S.
government   writ   large   have   a   vital   role   to   play   in   managing   this   transition   through
long-range   planning,   smart   investments,   and   programmatic   commitments   built   to   withstand
shorter-term   political   pressures.

One   of   the   most   important   measures   of   success   of   a   Green   New   Deal   will   be   whether   it
effectively   addresses   and   prioritizes   the   needs   and   rights   of   people   most   impacted   by   the
transition   away   from   fossil   fuels   —   particularly   workers   and   communities   heavily   dependent
upon   the   production   and   use   of   fossil   fuels,   as   well   as   historically   marginalized   Indigenous
and   low-wealth   communities   and   communities   of   color   who   have   unjustly   borne   the   burden
of   fossil   fuel   pollution   and   the   resulting   climate   impacts.   This   imperative   is   often   referred   to
as   providing   for   a   “just   and   equitable   transition”   or   “just   transition.”   45

Congressional   leadership   to   ensure   a    managed    phaseout   of   fossil   fuel   production   as   part   of
a   Green   New   Deal   is   essential   to   securing   a   just   transition   for   disadvantaged   workers   and
communities.

The   case   of   coal   country   provides   a   stark   example   of   the   suffering   that   is   likely   to   come
from   an    unmanaged    transition   away   from   fossil   fuels   (not   to   mention   the   untold   suffering
that   would   arise   from   a   failure   to   transition   altogether).

Coal   production   has   been   on   the   decline   for   years,   and   many   of   the   country’s   largest   coal
companies   have   fallen   into   insolvency.   In   the   last   year   alone   ﬁve   major   coal   companies   ﬁled
for   bankruptcy.

45  We   use   the   term   “just   transition”   here   knowing   that   it   can   often   provoke   questions   and   concerns   -
some   of   which   arise   from   the   different   national   and   historical   contexts   in   which   it   has   been   used.

The   impacts   on   regional   and   local   economies,   employees,   their   families,   and   communities
has   been   devastating.    In   Kentucky   alone,   coal   output   has   dropped   from   68   million   tons   per
year   to   just   17   million   tons   since   2011,   while   costing   the   state   nearly   10,000   coal   jobs.   48
Nearly   1,700   coal   workers   were   laid   off   without   notice   after   one   coal   company   declared
bankruptcy   in   July   2019,   many   workers   were   left   with   wages   and   retirement   beneﬁts   unpaid
—   driving   protests   to   block   coal   shipments   from   leaving   the   facility   for   nearly   two   months.   49
The   United   Mine   Workers   of   America’s   multi-employer   pension   plan   is   teetering   on   the
brink   of   insolvency   as   bankruptcies   slash   employer   contributions.

In   an   unmanaged   transition,   promises   made   to   workers   are   often   broken   by   corporate
bosses   and   Wall   Street   investors.   Value   is   extracted   from   failing   companies   and   communities
are   left   holding   the   bag.   A    managed   transition    would   rectify   this   problem   by   requiring   a
plan   and   a   timeline   upfront   (not   after   the   bubble   has   burst)   and   giving   workers,   unions   and
communities   a   democratic   voice   in   creating   that   plan.

This   kind   of   unmanaged   transition   can   be   avoided   with   Congressional   action   to   enact   a
Green   New   Deal   that   utilizes   every   policy   lever   at   our   disposal.   Speciﬁcally,   by   combining
meaningful   actions   to   constrain   and   wind   down   fossil   fuel   production   —   thereby   avoiding
“lock-in”   of   new   infrastructure   and   associated   climate   pollution   —   with   policies   to   guarantee
protections   to   workers   and   communities   during   the   transition.   This   way   fossil   fuel
companies   are   not   let   off   the   hook,   and   Congress   can   ensure   a   fossil   fuel   production
phaseout   is   a    just   and   managed    one.

To   facilitate   a   well-managed,   just   transition,   Congress   should   enact   a   variety   of   policies   and
programs   tailored   to   the   conditions   of   particular   industrial   sectors   or   geographic   regions.
Federal   action   should   be   rooted   in   democratic   processes   that   provide   affected   workers   and
communities   with   a   signiﬁcant   role   in   the   design   of   policies   and   programs   intended   to
assist   them   through   the   transition,   with   meaningful   opportunities   to   review   and   determine
how   they   could   be   expanded   or   improved.   Just   transition   programs   should   also   obey
principles   of   community   ownership   and   self-determination,   so   that   local   communities   can
shape   federal   policies   and   investments   to   meet   local   needs   and   build   community   wealth.

A   well-managed   just   transition   must   address   the   particular   needs   of   workers   currently   and
formerly   employed   by   fossil   fuel   companies,   whose   lives   —   as   well   those   of   their   families   —
will   be   signiﬁcantly   disrupted.   Many   already   are,   such   as   coal   industry   workers,   retirees,   and
communities.   In   addition,   Congress   should   provide   support   to   small   businesses   and   local

governments   that   are   currently   reliant   on   the   fossil   fuel   industry.   A   just   transition   must   also
take   into   consideration   the   unique   historical   circumstances   of   communities   impacted   by   the
fossil   fuel   industry.   This   includes   acknowledging   and   addressing   the   disproportionate
burdens   placed   on   communities   of   color   and   low-income   communities.

In   the   following   section,   we   provide   detailed   recommendations   for   Congress   to   initiate
and   coordinate   a   managed   phaseout   of   fossil   fuel   production   that   addresses   the   needs   of
vulnerable   and   historically   marginalized   communities   and   workers   as   part   of   a   Green
New   Deal.

In   developing   and   enacting   legislation   to   address   the   climate   crisis,   we   urge   Congress   to
uphold   the    Jemez   Principles   for   Democratic   Organizing,    Principles   of   Environmental   Justice,
52
51
   and    Indigenous   Principles   of   Just   Transition .    Congress   must   also   ensure   historically
marginalized   communities   and   families   meaningfully   inform   development   and
implementation   of   policies   to   advance   a   Green   New   Deal   or   any   response   to   the   climate
crisis.   As   a   starting   point,   Congress   should   consider   the    Vision   for   an   Equitable   and   Just
Climate   Future    platform   laid   out   by   a   collective   of   environmental   justice   and   national
groups.   53

● End   Fossil   Fuel   Exports :   Recent   research   from   Greenpeace   USA   illustrates   the   need
for   a   Green   New   Deal   to   constrain   fossil   fuel   supply.   If   U.S.   fossil   fuel   production   is
not   limited,   then   even   under   a   Green   New   Deal,   the   U.S.   is   likely   to   end   up   exporting
any   surplus   fossil   fuels   and   thereby   undermine   roughly   half   of   any   emissions
reductions   we   would   achieve   from   reducing   U.S.   demand   for   fossil   fuels   alone   (e.g.,
by   transitioning   the   U.S.   energy   system   to   100%   clean   energy).    The   2015   decision   to
revoke   the   crude   oil   export   ban   created   a   global   market   for   U.S.   oil   and   has   been

cited   as   one   key   impetus   for   the   recent   boom   in   domestic   oil   and   gas   production.   55
The   U.S.   is   not   on   track   to   become   a   net   exporter   of   crude   oil   in   the   next   few   years.
56
  Congress   should   reinstate   the   ban   on   crude   oil   exports,   and   impose   new   limits   on

gas   and   coal   exports   as   well.   It   will   be   important   for   Congress   to   act   to   cut   off   this
source   of   “carbon   leakage.”   The   goal   of   any   policy   should   be   that,   as   we   consume
fewer   fossil   fuels   domestically,   fossil   fuel   export   levels   are   targeted   in   parallel   to
ensure   that   non-domestic   emissions   do   not   increase,   or   even   decline.

● End   Fossil   Fuel   Leasing   on   Federal   Lands   and   Waters :   Oil,   gas,   and   coal   from   federal
lands   and   waters   accounts   for   roughly   24%   of   U.S.   carbon   emissions.    If   the   U.S.   is   to
make   a   committed   effort   to   halt   carbon   emissions   then   it   no   longer   makes   any
sense   for   the   government   to   be   in   the   extraction   business.   Research   from   the
Stockholm   Environment   Institute   has   shown   that   a   moratorium   on   new   federal   coal
and   oil   leases   would   be   an   effective   tool   for   reducing   global   carbon   emissions   at   a
scale   similar   to   the   Clean   Power   Plan   or   fuel   economy   standards.    Congress   should
permanently   end   new   leasing   for   fossil   fuel   production   on   federal   lands   and   waters,
and   reorient   U.S.   energy   laws   towards   energy   efﬁciency,   renewable   energy   production
and   energy   storage.

● Reject   Federal   Permits   for   New   Fossil   Fuel   Infrastructure :   The   oil   and   gas   industry’s
rush   to   build   more   pipelines   and   export   terminals   is   an   attempt   to   jumpstart   even
higher   levels   of   production.    But   just   as   we   can   no   longer   afford   new   extraction
projects,   we   can   no   longer   allow   the   construction   of   new   fossil   fuel   infrastructure.
Congress   should   reform   existing   energy   laws   to   ensure   that   the   president   and
relevant   federal   agencies,   including   the   Federal   Energy   Regulatory   Commission   and
the   Department   of   Interior,   have   the   authority   to   reject   new   fossil   fuel   infrastructure
that   would   increase   GHG   emissions   and   exacerbate   the   climate   crisis.

59

● Ensure   Free,   Prior,   and   Informed   Consent   by   Indigenous   Peoples:    Congress   should
enact   policies   to   fully   implement   and   uphold   the   United   Nations   Declaration   on   the
Rights   of   Indigenous   Peoples   as   well   as   honor   existing   treaties   with   tribal   nations,
including   recognizing   the   right   of   Indigenous   Peoples   to   give   “free,   prior,   and
informed   consent”   (FPIC)   regarding   policies   affecting   the   development   of   tribal   lands
and   resources.   This   includes   the   right   to   reject   fossil   fuel   and   other   polluting

infrastructure.   Fossil   fuel   production   on   tribal   lands   conducted   without   full   FPIC
should   be   immediately   halted.   Congress   should   ensure   full   consultation   with   tribal
nations   beginning   in   the   earliest   stages   of   development   of   legislation   related   to   the
climate   crisis.   60

● Eliminate   Fossil   Fuel   Production   Subsidies:    Congress   should   swiftly   eliminate   U.S.

61

tax   incentives,   direct   subsidies,   and   research   and   development   funding   for   fossil   fuel
production.    The   U.S.   channeled   at   least   $14.7   billion   in   direct   coal,   oil,   and   gas
production   subsidies   to   fossil   fuel   companies   in   2015   and   2016,   on   average.    The
International   Monetary   Fund   estimates   U.S.   fossil   fuel   subsidies   amount   to   $649
billion   when   climate   change,   local   air   pollution,   infrastructure   damage,   and   public
health   externalities   are   considered.   These   highly   inefﬁcient   subsidies   are   propping
up   energy   production   activities   that   are   incompatible   with   safe   climate   limits.   63
Removing   them   would   help   level   the   playing   ﬁeld   for   renewable   energy   technologies
that   will   help   the   U.S.   transition   rapidly   and   equitably   to   a   100%   clean   energy   future.

62

● Sunset   the   IRS   Section   45(Q)   Enhanced   Oil   Recovery   Tax   Credit:    Congress   should
sunset   the   provision   in   the   IRS   Section   45(Q)   tax   credit   for   enhanced   oil   recovery.
Section   45(Q)   is   theoretically   designed   to   deploy   carbon   capture,   and   sequestration
technology.   The   credit,   however,   is   priced   to   incentivize   injection   for   oil   production
and   not   for   permanent   carbon   sequestration.   This   means,   in   practice,   nearly   all   of
the   captured   carbon   is   sold   back   to   oil   companies   to   enhance   additional   production.
Carbon   capture   and   sequestration   should   not   be   used   as   a   tool   to   prolong   fossil   fuel
use   and   Congress   should   prioritize   tax   credits   for   renewable   alternatives.
Furthermore,   it   is   still   unclear   whether   the   IRS   administered   past   tax   credits   for
enhanced   oil   recovery   correctly.    64

● End   Fossil   Fuel   Financing :   Congress   should   enact   policies   to   eliminate   public

ﬁnancing   of   fossil   fuel   projects,   and   restrict   or   discourage   private   ﬁnance   where
possible.   Congress   should   immediately   end   domestic   fossil   fuel   subsidies   (as   detailed
above)   and   reform   the   Export-Import   Bank   and   the   International   Development

Finance   Corporation   (formerly   OPIC)   to   end   all   support   for   fossil   fuels   by   those   and
other   agencies.   The   U.S.   should   take   the   lead   in   international   fora   (G7,   G20,   U.N.)   and
multilateral   institutions   (World   Bank,   IMF,   OECD   working   groups)   to   work   with   other
nations   to   phase   out   fossil   fuel   subsidies   globally,   and   to   ensure   that   these
institutions   do   not   provide   ﬁnance   to   new   fossil   fuel   projects.   Guidance   from   the
Department   of   the   Treasury   should   make   this   ofﬁcial   U.S.   policy.   Congress   should
support   the   SEC   to   enact   strong   regulations   requiring   corporations   to   disclose   climate
risks   and   stress-test   their   business   models   against   the   Paris   Climate   Agreement   and
the   1.5C   target.   The   Federal   Reserve   should   join   the   Network   on   Greening   the
Financial   System   (NGFS),   in   order   to   “better   manage   climate   related   risks   and
promote   a   transition   to   a   clean   energy   economy.”   65

● Curb   Demand   for   Fossil   Fuels ::   The   next   President   and   Congress   should   also   enact
strong,   demand-side   policies   to   reduce   the   use   of   fossil   fuels   in   the   electric   power,
transportation,   and   buildings   sectors.   A   great   many   policy   proposals   have   been
created   to   decarbonize   these   sectors,   many   of   which   are   core   components   of   the
Green   New   Deal.   We   don’t   seek   to   offer   a   full   suite   of   demand-side   policies   in   this
document,   but   highlight   some   regulatory   and   federal   investment   policies   that   could
work   in   concert   with   the   supply-side   policies   detailed   in   this   report.

○ Ending   Fossil   Fuel   Use   in   the   Transportation   Sector :   Congress   should   build

on   existing   Clean   Air   Act   authorities   by   enacting   fuel   economy   and   emissions
standards   that   require   a   rising   percentage   of   new   passenger   vehicles,
medium-duty   trucks,   and   buses   be   zero-emissions   vehicles   (ZEVs).   This
regulatory   base   should   be   paired   with   large-scale   federal   investments   in
public   transit,   zero   emissions   buses,   regional   high-speed   rail,   ZEV
manufacturing   &   EV   charging   infrastructure;   grants   or   tax   credits   to   support
purchasing   an   EV   or   trading   in   old   ICE   vehicles   (“Cash   for   Clunkers”);   and
electriﬁcation   of   the   federal   vehicle   ﬂeet.

○ Ending   Fossil   Fuel   Use   in   the   Electric   Power   Sector :   Congress   should   build
on   existing   Clean   Air   Act   authorities   to   enact   strict   national   GHG   emission
and   localized   air   pollution   standards   for   coal   and   natural   gas-ﬁred   power
plants   that   lead   to   a   100%   phase   out   of   fossil   fuels   in   the   electric   power
sector   by   2030.   This   regulatory   base   should   be   paired   with   federal
investments   to   boost   smart   grid   technology,   utility-scale   energy   storage,   and
wind/solar   generation,   prioritizing   distributed   and   decentralized   renewable
energy   systems   that   increase   community   ownership   of   electricity.   Congress
should   also   make   strategic   use   of   federal   lands   and   waters   to   expand   wind
and   solar   generation;   expand   existing   programs,   such   as   the   Rural
Electriﬁcation   Administration,   the   Federal   Power   Marketing   Administrations,

and   the   Tennessee   Valley   Authority   to   push   renewables;   policy   support   for
public   power,   municipal   power,   power   coops,   and   performance-based   utility
regulation;   moratorium   on   permits   for   new   coal,   natural   gas,   and   nuclear
power   plants.

○ Ending   Fossil   Fuel   Use   in   the   Buildings   Sector.    Enact   federal   Zero   Carbon
building   standards   to   require   a   rising   percentage   of   new   residential   and
commercial   buildings   to   be   zero   or   negative   emissions.   This   should   be   paired
with   federal   investments   to   support   weatherization,   electriﬁcation,   and
decarbonization   of   existing   buildings,   as   well   as   a   strong   mandate   to
eliminate   fossil   fuel   use   in   federal   buildings.

B.   Phase   Out   Existing   Production

● Set   declining   national   targets   for   a   fossil   fuel   phaseout:    In   the   face   of   a   climate

emergency   largely   caused   by   runaway   fossil   fuel   combustion,   the   national   policy   of
the   U.S.   should   be   to   limit   new   fossil   fuel   extraction   and   phase   out   coal,   oil,   and   gas
production   at   the   pace   needed   to   afﬁrm   the   U.S.’s   “fair   share”   contribution   to   limiting
global   temperature   rise   to   below   1.5°C   above   pre-Industrial   levels.   Congress   should   set
declining   national   targets   —   including   2025   and   2030   interim   targets   —   for   phasing
out   fossil   fuel   production   in   concert   with   other   climate-related   targets,   such   as   for
GHG   emissions   reductions   and   renewable   energy   deployment.

● Roll   Back   Production   from   Existing   Fossil   Fuel   Leases :   Ending   new   federal   leasing
will   not,   in   itself,   affect   fossil   fuel   production   from   existing   leases.   Production   from
existing   oil   and   gas   wells   will   decline   over   time,   however,   it   could   still   be   possible   for
lease   holders   to   drill   new   wells   on   producing   leases,   or   to   drill   on   leases   that   have
been   “stockpiled”   for   future   production.    In   order   to   hit   national   production   decline
targets,   it   will   be   necessary   for   the   federal   government   to   restrict   some   production
from   existing   leases.   One   such   mechanism   would   be   to   close   loopholes    and
signiﬁcantly   increase   royalty   rates    on   federal   production.   Raising   royalty   rates   (as
well   as   removing   subsidies  )   would   potentially   make   some   fossil   fuel   projects
uneconomic   to   pursue,   therefore   reducing   production.    Higher   royalty   rates   would

increase   revenue   and   permit   the   government   to   recoup   more   of   the   Social   Cost   of
Carbon   due   to   the   extracted   fossil   fuels.   New   wells   on   existing   leases   may   also   be
subject   to   additional   approval,   and   Congress   should   explicitly   give   authority   to   the
president   to   explore   legal   options   for   rejecting   new   permits   to   drill,   or   even   the
possibility   of   buying   back   existing   leases.

● Advance   Environmental   Justice:    Fossil   fuel   production   creates   toxic   air   and   water
pollution,   land   degradation,   and   other   health   and   environmental   impacts    that
disproportionately   affect   people   of   color   and   low-income   people   — perpetuating   the
U.S.’s   legacy   of   environmental   injustice.   Toxic   sites,   coal-ﬁred   power   plants,   oil   and
gas   production   facilities,   and   other   polluting   sources   are   disproportionately   sited
near   communities   of   color   and   economically   disadvantaged   communities.    These
families   and   communities   who   have   for   too   long   borne   the   brunt   of   air,   water,   land,
and   climate   pollution   from   coal,   oil,   and   gas   companies   should   have   the   resources
and   tools   to   secure   their   rights   to   clean   air,   clean   water,   a   stable   climate,   and   healthy
local   ecosystems.   Congress   should   pass   comprehensive   legislation   to   advance
environmental   justice   by   ensuring   disadvantaged   communities   have   a   meaningful
voice   in   legislative   and   regulatory   policymaking   processes;   strengthening   legal
mechanisms   for   impacted   individuals   to   challenge   disproportionate   environmental
harms,   including   strengthening   protections   under   Title   VI   of   the   Civil   Rights   Act   of
1964    and   the   Environmental   Protection   Agency’s   Ofﬁce   of   Civil   Rights,    and
codifying   Executive   Order   12898;    properly   considering   environmental   justice   and
cumulative   pollution   impacts   throughout   federal   permitting,   planning,   and   rulemaking;
and   prioritizing   federal   investments   for   overburdened   communities   who   have   been
too   long   left   behind.   As   starting   points,   Congress   could   consider   the   Environmental
Justice   Initiative   led   by   Natural   Resources   Committee   Chair   Raul   M.   Grijalva   and
Representative   A.   Donald   McEachin,    and   the    Environmental   Justice   Act    introduced

● Pursue   a   Global   Supply-Side   Treaty :   Because   climate   change   is   a   global   problem,   it

has   long   been   understood   that   international   cooperation   is   crucial   for   making
progress   on   emissions   reductions   and   reducing   the   problem   of   free-riders   and
emissions   leakage.   In   enacting   policies   to   restrict   the   supply   of   fossil   fuels,   the   same
principle   applies.   The   U.S.   has   recently   surged   to   become   the   world’s   leading   oil   and
gas   producer,   and   as   such,   we   have   a   responsibility   to   take   the   lead   on   enacting   the
supply-side   policies   outlined   in   this   document.   However,   an   agreement   among   fossil
fuel-producing   nations   to   set   global   and   country-speciﬁc   climate-safe   targets   for   a
managed   decline   in   coal,   oil,   and   gas   production,   would   better   ensure   that   the   world
does   not   overshoot   our   fossil   fuel   limits   —    and   would   boost   the   effectiveness   of   the
Paris   Climate   Accords   and   the   UNFCCC   process.   Recent   academic    studies    have
highlighted   the   beneﬁts   of   such   a   global   treaty,   and   the   concept   has   even   gained
traction   with   presidential   candidates.    The   next   president   and   Congress   would   have
key   roles   to   play   in   ensuring   such   a   global   negotiation   occurs   and   is   implemented.

● Restore   the   Social   Cost   of   Carbon :   Congress   should   immediately   end   fossil   fuel

leasing,   and   the   ofﬁcial   Social   Cost   of   Carbon   (SCC)   calculations   should   be   restored
and   used   to   provide   full   and   transparent   justiﬁcations   for   strong   climate   policies.   The
Trump   administration   radically   reduced   the   ofﬁcial   SCC   values   by   using   inappropriate
discount   rates   and   excluding   non-domestic   climate   costs.    Congress   should   work

with   the   president   to   generate   updated   SCC   values    that   take   into   account   the   latest
scientiﬁc   research    on   climate   impacts   and   damages,   and   urge   the   Ofﬁce   of
Management   and   Budget/Ofﬁce   of   Information   and   Regulatory   Affairs   to   issue
guidance   requiring   the   use   of   the   SCC   in   agency   decision   making.   The   guidance
should   require   a   full   up-   and   down-stream,   consequential   lifecycle   analysis   of   GHG
emissions   for   all   signiﬁcant   federal   decisions,   taking   into   account   both   direct   and
indirect   emissions.   Congress   should   work   with   the   president   to   produce   and   make
public   a   yearly   report   on   the   aggregate   climate   consequences   of   its   policies   and
their   likely   impact   on   global   emissions.

● Ensure   Any   Carbon   Price   Is   Equitable   and   Effective: :   A   price   on   carbon   can   be   a
useful   component   of   a   comprehensive   climate   policy   package,   although   would   be
most   effective   used   in   conjunction   with   a   broad   suite   of   demand-   and   supply-side
investments   and   regulations   to   transition   to   100%   renewable   energy,   decarbonize   the
economy,   phase   out   fossil   fuel   production,   and   protect   and   uplift   disadvantaged
workers   and   communities.   In   isolation,   a   carbon   price   is   unlikely   to   be   sufﬁcient
enough   to   achieve   emissions   reductions   at   the   pace   and   scale   we   need.   If   a   carbon
price   is   enacted,   Congress   should   ensure   it   is   designed   to   be   equitable,   progressive,
and   stringent.   A   carbon   price   enacted   along   with   policies   to   advance   a   Green   New
Deal   and   phase   out   fossil   fuel   production   should   begin   at   a   level   high   enough   to
meaningfully   reduce   emissions   (the   IPCC   estimates   the   marginal   cost   of   reducing
emissions   will   be   at   least    $135   per   metric   ton   CO2e   by   2030)    and   rise   quickly   over
the   course   of   a   decade   and   beyond.   The   price   should   be   applied   to   upstream   fossil
fuel   and   other   polluting-fuel   producers   as   close   to   the   point   of   extraction   or   import
as   possible.   The   price   should   be   progressive,   and   paired   with   measures   to   mitigate
any   regressive   impacts   on   economically   disadvantaged   families   and   communities.
The   price   should   also   be   coupled   with   policies   that   beneﬁt   communities   historically
exploited   by   the   fossil   fuel   and   other   polluting   industries,   and   not   allow   for   offsets,
free   allowances,   or   other   loopholes   that   could   lead   to   pollution   “hotspots”   in
already-overburdened   communities   or   enable   covered   entities   to   avoid   reducing
emissions   at   the   source.   Congress   should   reject   any   proposal   to   use   a   carbon   price
to   eliminate   or   weaken   existing   climate   and   environmental   protections,   such   as   by
weakening   the   Clean   Air   Act   or   affording   fossil   fuel   companies   a   liability   waiver.

Underground   Injection   Control   (UIC)   Class   II   programs    if   these   programs   demonstrate
the   regulations   are   as   effective   as   EPA   regulations   in   protecting   underground   sources
of   drinking   water.   In   practice,   the   last   three   decades   of   state   implementation   indicate
"primacy   authority"   appears   to   have   been   used   as   a   tool   for   states   to   streamline   oil
and   gas   production.   Injection   wells   are   crucial   upstream   infrastructure   for   oil   and   gas
wastewater   disposal   and   enhanced   oil   recovery.   There   have   been   several   lapses
across   state   programs   including   the   failure    to   protect   drinking   water   in   Texas,   a
wave   of   earthquakes    linked   to   oil   and   gas   wastewater   injection,   and   thousands   of
wells   permitted   to   inject   directly   into   protected    aquifers.   Congress   should   use   its
appropriations   and   oversight   authority   to   request   the   EPA   Administrator   revoke   state
UIC   primacy   from   certain   states   and   reassert   EPA   as   lead   regulatory   authority.   93
Congress   should   conduct   an   independent   investigation   of   certain   state   UIC   programs
for   their   potential   role   in   helping   facilitate   the   largest   oil   and   gas   boom   in   U.S.
history   while   endangering   drinking   water   sources.

● Close   Oil   and   Gas   Legislative   Loopholes   and   Strengthen   Protections: :   Congress
should   pass   a   set   of   bills   known   as   “The   Frack   Pack”   to   close   loopholes   in   our
landmark   environmental   laws   and   end   the   U.S.   government’s   practice   of   prioritizing
oil   and   gas   extraction   over   public   health   and   the   environment.    These   are
common-sense   baseline   policies   that   will   help   reﬂect   the   true   cost   of   oil   and   gas
extraction.   The   bills   would   remove   exemptions   for   the   oil   and   gas   industry   in   the
Clean   Air   Act,    Resource   Conservation   and   Recovery   Act,   Clean   Water   Act,   and   Safe
Drinking   Water   Act,   and   require   new   water   monitoring   and   reporting   near   fracking
operations.   Further,   Congress   should   enact   legislation   to   strengthen   methane
requirements   well   beyond   the   standards   that   were   derailed   and   repealed   under   the
Trump   Administration.    New   research    linking   the   increase   in   methane   emissions   to

C.   Secure   a   Just   and   Equitable   Transition   Away   from   Fossil   Fuels

● Ensure   the   Fossil   Fuel   Phaseout   is   Managed   and   Transparent:    Congress   should
establish   directives   through   legislation   or   the   appropriations   process   for   federal
agencies   to   plan   for   and   coordinate   a   phaseout   of   U.S.   fossil   fuel   production.   The
federal   government   has   an   essential   role   to   play   in   protecting   the   environment   and
safeguarding   the   livelihoods   and   rights   of   affected   workers   and   communities   as   coal,
oil,   and   gas   production   winds   down.   In   other   words,   the   federal   government   must
ensure   a    managed    fossil   fuel   phaseout.   Congress   should   use   its   legislative   powers   to
compel   federal   agencies   to   regularly   report   on   national   progress   toward   a   fossil   fuel
phaseout   and   ensure   policies   are   developed   and   implemented   transparently   and   with
meaningful   input   from   the   public,   particularly   impacted   and   traditionally   marginalized
stakeholders.   Congress   should   follow   a   core   principle   of   “federal   dollars,   local   control”
—   securing   federal   funding   and   support   while   affording   local   communities   and
regional   planning   bodies   the   ability   to   manage   the   transition   away   from   fossil   fuel
production   in   a   way   that   most   equitably   meets   local   needs   and   reﬂects   regional
circumstances.

● Form   a   National   Just   Transition   Commission:    Congress   should   form   a   commission
that   could   guide   the   development   and   implementation   of   the   overall   transition
strategy   and   establish   task   forces   to   recommend   policies   and   programs   appropriate
to   speciﬁc   regions   and   sectors   that   are   heavily   dependent   upon   fossil   production
and   use.   A   particular   effort   should   be   made   to   include   representatives   from
communities   disproportionately   harmed   by   the   fossil   fuel   industry,   especially
low-income   communities,   communities   of   color,   and   Indigenous   communities,   which
have   borne   a   disproportionate   share   of   fossil   fuel   industry-related   pollution,   while
receiving   few   economic   beneﬁts.     The   commission   should   be   resourced   to   provide   a

● Create   a   Federal   Just   Transition   Ofﬁce:    Congress   should   create   a   Just   Transition

101

Ofﬁce   (JTO)   to   research   and   coordinate   local/regional   and   sector-speciﬁc   planning
programs   and   policies.   The   JTO   could   help   the   commission   and   Congress   with
questions   related   to   regional   economic   development,   sector   speciﬁc   technological
questions,   workforce   and   community   needs   and   other   questions.   It   would   be   modeled
after   the   Ofﬁce   of   Technology   Assessment,   which   provided   similar   expert   advice   to
Congress   in   the   past.    One   of   the   tasks   of   the   JTO   would   be   to   gather   and   assess
the   policies   and   programs   used   for   other   large-scale   transitions,   including   base
closure   programs,    economic   conversion   planning,    the   utilization   of
government-owned   plants   and   facilities,    the   Trade   Adjustment   Assistance   Program,

Environmental   Cleanup,   and   Community   Revitalization   and   Economic
Diversiﬁcation.    Congress   should   provide   full   income   and   beneﬁt   guarantees   to   fossil
fuel   employees   who   lose   their   jobs   due   to   a   managed   phaseout   of   oil,   gas   and   coal
production.     Wage   gap   coverage   and   insurance   guarantees   should   be   provided   to
workers   who   ﬁnd   new   “green   economy”   employment.   Access   to   free   education,   skills
development,   job   preparation   and   training   should   be   provided   to   fossil   fuel
employees   who   need   support   to   successfully   transition   to   a   new   career.
Apprenticeships   and   preferential   hiring   practices   should   be   established   to   support
workers   transitioning   out   of   the   fossil   fuel   industry   into   the   renewable   energy   and
other   sectors.   Tax   incentives   should   be   provided   to   companies   that   adopt   these
practices.     Support   and   assistance   should   be   provided   to   workers   and   their   families
wishing   to   relocate,   including   moving   allowances   and,   potentially,   residential   living
subsidies.   Employees   who   choose   to   retire   early   should   be   guaranteed   pensions   and
full   health   beneﬁts.     Adequate   treatment,   counseling   and   community-based   clinical
services   should   be   provided   to   workers   suffering   from   occupational-related   illnesses.
Historically   disadvantaged   communities   should   also   beneﬁt   from   the   transition.
Access   to   free   vocational   training,   apprenticeships   and   preferential   hiring   practices
should   be   provided   to   low-income   communities,   people   of   color,   and   other
disadvantaged   communities,   as   well   as   undocumented   workers   and   people   with
non-violent   criminal   records.   110

108  Retention   bonuses   might   be   required   for   workers   who   remain   on   the   job   through   closure.   See,   for
example,   the   7   year    Diablo   Canyon   Nuclear   plant   transition    plan   projected   for   2018   -2025.
109  The   Pension   Beneﬁt   Guarantee   Program   should   be   adequately   funded   to   cover   an   increase   in
claims   made   by   workers   formerly   employed   by   fossil   fuel   companies   eliminated   by   the   transition   to   a
clean   energy   economy.   For   many   years   the   PBGP   has   had   to   compensate   for   the   failure   of
corporations   to   provide   traditional   pension   beneﬁts.    (link )   The   Just   Transition   Commission   should
work   with   Congress   to   anticipate   the   increased   funding   needed   to   rectify   this   failure   and   anticipate
any   increase   in   the   number   of   claims   ﬁled   by   workers   affected   by   the   just   transition.   Providing   for   a
secure   parth   to   early   retirement   for   fossil   fuel   workers   is   an   essential   element   in   any   well-managed
rapid   phase-out   of   the   fossil   fuel   industry.   See   Pollin   et   al.,   2019.

● Reform   Bankruptcy   Laws   to   Ensure   Fossil   Fuel   Companies   Fulﬁll   Obligations   to

Workers   &   Communities.    Bankruptcy   laws   have   allowed   companies   to   discharge   their
obligations   to   workers,   retirees   and   the   communities   they   operate   in,   while
prioritizing   the   claims   of   investors   and   other   creditors.    Congress   should:

111

○ Make   regulatory   debts   non-dischargeable   since   they   do   not   serve   the   same
purposes   as   ﬁnancial   obligations.   Re-order   priorities   so   that   non-ﬁnancial
regulatory   obligations   come   ﬁrst,   with   some   kind   of   security   interest
guarantee;

○ Restrict   companies   from   transferring   or   selling   any   assets   before   meeting
environmental   obligations   and   pension   and   health   beneﬁt   commitments;
○ Prevent   corporate   shell   games.   If   a   company   that   inherited   obligations   from
another   company   goes   bankrupt,   the   company   that   originally   incurred   the
obligations   would   still   be   legally   and   ﬁnancially   responsible;
○ Prohibit   executives   of   bankrupt   companies   to   continue   any   active

112

management   capacity   for   corporate   entities   emerging   from   bankruptcy   and
restructuring   processes.

● Require   Production   Declines   in   Fossil   Fuel   Company   Bankruptcy   and

Restructuring   Proceedings.    Congress   should   put   in   place   a   requirement   when   fossil
fuel   companies   ﬁle   for   bankruptcy,   they   are   put   under   receivership   and   wind
production   down   under   a   reasonable   timeline.   Retention   bonuses   should   be   provided
to   workers   assisting   the   closure   process.    Congress   should   establish   a   climate
emergency   fund   to   compensate   companies   for   the   remaining   fossil   fuel   reserves   at   a
fair   price,   with   the   revenues   being   allocated   by   the   bankruptcy   court   (or   its
appointed   receiver)   to   resolve   the   outstanding   claims   of   remaining   creditors.   113
Remaining   fossil   fuel   reserves   would   then   be   transferred   to   an   independent   trust

111  Joshua   Macey   and   Jackson   Salovaara,   “Bankruptcy   as   Bailout:   Coal   Company   Insolvency   and   the
Erosion   of   Federal   Law,”   Stanford   Law   Review,   Vol.   71,   Issue   4,   April   2019,   ( link )    See   additional
comments   by   the   authors   in   their   Harvard   Law   School   Forum   blog,   May   22,   2019.    (link )
112  As   Macey   et   al.   suggest,   “...strategic   pre-bankruptcy   conduct   has   played   a   critical   role   in
allowing   coal   companies   to   evade   their   regulatory   obligations.   By   spinning   off   underfunded
subsidiaries   and   giving    those   subsidiaries   legal   responsibility   for   the   parent’s   regulatory
obligations,   coal   companies   have   been   able   to   separate   productive   assets   from   onerous   regulatory
debts.   When   the   underfunded   successor   entity   liquidates,   it   is   difﬁcult   to   hold   that   original   company
responsible   for   honoring   those   regulatory   debts.   In   this   way,   the   ability   to   siphon   off   regulatory
obligations   through   spin-offs   and   divestitures   has   allowed   companies   to   pay   unsecured   pecuniary
creditors   a   relatively   high   percentage   of   what   they   are   owed   while   paying   regulatory   creditors
virtually   nothing.”
113  Mines   that   produce   coal   for   electricity   should   be   rapidly   closed   under   such   a   process,   with   bonuses
provided   to   workers   managing   the   closure   and   post-closure   remediation   process.   Congress   should
determine   whether   mines   producing   metallurgical   coal   (used   to   produce   steel)   might   need   to   remain
open   a   little   longer,   in   which   case   signiﬁcant   fees   per   tonnage   produced   should   be   applied,   along
with   additional   fees   for   any   coal   that   is   exported.

chartered   by   Congress   and   insulated   from   political   decision-makers   and   economic
interests.   This   trust   could   be   modeled   on   the   Troubled   Asset   Relief   Program   (TARP)
which   just   over   a   decade   ago   was   created   by   Congress   to   protect   ﬁnancial   markets
and   the   broader   economy   from   the   risk   that   “too   big   to   fail   banks”   would   collapse.   114
The   TARP   was   designed   to   purchase   the   big   banks’   “toxic”   mortgage-backed
securities.    The   $700   billion   allocated   for   TARP   under   the   Emergency   Economic
Stabilization   Act   of   2008   would   certainly   be   much   cheaper   than   the   costs   to   the   U.S.
economy   of   unchecked   climate   change   —   projected   to   be   hundreds   of   billions   of
dollars   per   year   by   the   end   of   the   century.    Further,   if   the   climate   emergency   trust
fund   more   broadly   applied   (instead   of   just   to   corporations   ﬁling   for   bankruptcy)   the
cost   would   still   fall   well   below   the   estimated   $1.15   trillion   required   to   buy   a   majority
stake   in   the   25   largest   U.S.-based   publicly   traded   oil   and   gas   companies,   along   with
the   few   remaining   publicly   traded   coal   companies.   117

116

● Invest   in   Community   Revitalization,   Job   Training,   Education,   Economic

Diversiﬁcation,   Small   Business   Development.    Congress   should   establish   or
strengthen   regional   development   programs   to   support   economic   revitalization   and
development   in   fossil   fuel-dependent   and   devastated   communities.     One   approach
could   be   to   reinstate   and   expand   the   POWER+   program   established   under   the   Obama
administration,   which   provided   economic   and   workforce   development   grants   for   coal
communities.     Local   and   community   protection   funds   could   also   be   established
with   fees   collected   from   fossil   fuel   companies.   As   tax   revenues   shrink   along   with

118

119

114   Nationalization   may   sound   like   an   extreme   measure,   but   in   fact   there   are   plenty   of   examples   of
historical   “nationalization”   in   the   U.S.   in   response   to   economic   or   national   security   emergencies.   See
Thomas   M.   Hanna,   “A   History   of   Nationalization   in   the   United   States,   1917   -   2009,”   The   Next   System

117   The   Democracy   Collaborative    estimates    that   buying   a   majority   stake   in   the   25   largest   U.S.-based
publicly   traded   oil   and   gas   companies,   along   with   most   of   the   remaining   publicly   traded   coal
companies   would   cost   an   estimated   $1.15   trillion.   In   2016,   Robert   Pollin   and   Brian   Callaci   estimated
that   the   cost   of   a   national   just   transition   program   to   phase   out   fossil   fuels   would   be   $600
million/year.   That   assumed   a   2   degree   Celsius   target,   an   assumption   that   they   have   revised   to   1.5
degree   Celsius   in   estimates   published   since   October,   2018.   See   “The   Economics   of   Just   Transition:   A

fossil   fuel   production,   the   funds   can   support   new   infrastructure   investment   or   other
projects   that   attract   new   businesses,   creating   jobs   and   other   community   beneﬁts.   120
Meanwhile,   companies   should   be   required   to   provide   advance   notice   to   employees
and   communities   before   shutting   down   any   operation   or   making   workforce   cuts   or
transfers.   Redevelopment   of   industrial   properties   should   be   governed   by   community
beneﬁt   agreements   and   local   hiring   requirements.   Support   should   be   provided   to
community-labor   “common   good”   initiatives   such   as   climate   mitigation   and   disaster
recovery   projects.

121

● End   Fossil   Fuel   Company   Self-Bonding.    Congress   should   enact   legislation   to   end

fossil   fuel   company   self   bonding   that   practice,   as   proposed   under   H.R.   4435,    The   Coal
122
Cleanup   Taxpayer   Protection   Act   of   2019 .    Coal   companies   must   be   forced   to   fulﬁll
their   land-reclamation   and   post-closure   environmental   and   site   cleanup   obligations.
The   dangerous   practice   of   “self-bonding”   has   allowed   coal   companies   to   make   empty
promises   about   covering   cleanup   costs   without   putting   up   sureties   or   collateral.

● Accelerate   Coal   Community   Land   Reclamation.    Mountaintop   removal   and   longwall
mining   in   particular   have   been   destroying   local   ecosystems   and   communities.
Congress   should   enact   the   RECLAIM   Act   (Revitalizing   the   Economy   of   Coal
Communities   by   Leveraging   Local   Activities   and   Investing   More   Act)   to   accelerate
dispersals   from   the   federal   Abandoned   Mine   Land   Fund   to   reclaim   more   abandoned
coal   sites   more   quickly.   It   would   also   prioritize   public   input   and   community
participation   in   determining   which   projects   are   chosen   based   on   economic   potential.
The   Act   also   requires   preferential   hiring   practices   so   that   highly   skilled   miners   are
123
given   preference   for   jobs   created   under   land   reclamation   programs.

● Strengthen   workers’   rights   to   ensure   Green   New   Deal   jobs   are   union   jobs    “Green
jobs”   in   rapidly   growing   sectors   such   as   renewable   energy   and   energy   efﬁciency,
along   with   jobs   associated   with   “climate   protection”   and   other   infrastructure   projects
should   be   good,   secure   jobs,   with   strong   wages   and   beneﬁts.    Congress   should

energy   efﬁciency   and   other   occupational   sectors   that   are   growing   rapidly   as   a   result
of   the   transition.   Similar   requirements   should   be   immediately   applied   to   “climate
protection”   jobs   —   including   federally   funded   infrastructure   projects   —   and   extended
across   other   sectors.   The   rights   of   workers   to   form   a   union   need   to   be   protected.   For
decades,   the   rights   of   workers   to   organize   and   bargain   collectively   have   been
systematically   eroded.    Policies   are   needed   to   strengthen   collective   bargaining   rights
and   eliminate   mandatory   arbitration   and   mandatory   neutrality   agreements.   Sectoral
(industry-wide)   bargaining   should   be   supported   as   well.   Occupational   health   and
safety   requirements   should   also   be   strengthened.   A   clean   and   healthy   workplace   is
essential   to   a   clean   and   sustainable   environment.

Appendix:   100%   Renewable   Cloud   Computing

The   internet   will   likely   be   the   largest   single   thing   we   build   as   a   species,   and   while   the
internet   itself   seems   virtual,   the   data   centers   and   network   infrastructure   behind   the   internet
are   quite   physical.   Not   surprisingly,   it   takes   a   tremendous   amount   of   energy   to   power   our
devices,   data   centers,   and   related   infrastructural   needs.   Globally,   data   centers   are   estimated
to   consume   200TWh   of   energy,   or   1%   of   global   electricity   demand.   That   number   is   estimated
to   balloon   in   the   next   ten   years,   to   as   much   as   8%   projected   global   electricity   demand   by

2030.

How   we   build   and   power   our
quickly   growing   global   digital
infrastructure   is   rapidly
becoming   central   to   the   question
of   whether   we   will   be   able   to
transition   to   renewable   energy   in
time   to   avoid   dangerous   climate
change.

The   US   government   is   one   of   the
largest   cloud   services   customers
in   the   world.   In   an   effort   to
modernize,   the   federal
government   has   issued   guidance
to   agencies   to   accelerate   cloud
adoption   through   its   Cloud   Smart   strategy  .   The   Pentagon   recently   awarded   an   $10   billion
dollar   contract   to   Microsoft’s   cloud   business   for   project   JEDI,   and   more   than   5,000
government   agencies   already   use   Amazon   Web   Services  ,   including   the   CIA,   the   State
Department,   Department   of   Defense,   NOAA,   as   well   as   numerous   state   government   agencies.

If   the   rapid   expansion   of   cloud   computing   services   continues   to   be   powered   by   electricity
derived   from   fossil   fuels,the   growth   of   the   internet   could   actually   drive   demand   for   more
electricity   and   lock   us   in   to   coal   and   other   dirty   sources   of   energy.   As   highlighted   in
Greenpeace’s   recent   Clicking   Clean   Virginia(February   2019)  ,   the   rapid   expansion   of   data

centers   in   Northern   Virginia’s   “Data   Center   Alley”,   many   of   which   are   linked   to   federal
government   contracts,   is   being   used   by   Dominion   Energy   to   justify   a   rapid   build   out   in
additional   fracked   gas   delivery   and   electricity   generation   capacity,   including   the   $8   billion
Atlantic   Coast   Pipeline.    However,   if   data   centers   are   100%   renewably   powered,   the   Federal
Government’s    shift   to   the   cloud   instead   could   accelerate   our   transition   to   a   renewably
powered   economy.

With   the   threats   of   climate   change   already   upon   us,   the   US   Government   must   ensure   its
transition   to   the   cloud   does   not   take   us   in   the   wrong   direction   in   terms   of   GHG   emissions,
and   direct   that   cloud   computing   contracts   the   government   awards   are   powered   by   data
centers   attached   to   renewable   sources   of   electricity.   At   present,   there   are   no   legal
requirements   for   cloud   service   providers   to   publish   information   about   their   energy   use.   And
while   there   are   procurement   guidelines    for   cloud   services   providers,   none   of   these
requirements   pertain   to   renewable   energy   use   or   GHG   emissions.

At   present,   a   key   challenge   for   both   private   and   public   sector   cloud   customers   is   the   lack   of
detailed   reporting   by   major   cloud   companies   on   the   energy   demand   and   GHG   footprint   that
occurs   with   the   data   storage   and   computer   services   provided   to   each   customer.

As   one   of   the   largest   customers   of   data   center   companies,   the   US   government   has   a   unique
role   to   play   as   a   catalyst   to   drive   better   reporting   and   accelerate   the   renewable   energy
transition   among   throughout   the   tech   industry.

As   has   done   with   success   previously   to   advance   important   national   economic   and
environmental   goals,   Congress   should   direct   federal   agencies   to   adopt   standards   to   ensure
the   Federal   Government   cloud   is   being   powered   with   renewable   energy.   Federal   agencies
should   be   directed   when   entering   into   contracts   with   cloud   computing   or   data   center
vendors   to   require   that   the   data   centers   operators   be   able   to   meet   minimum   transparency
and   renewable   energy   performance   standards.   Procurement   standards   for   Renewably
Powered   Federal   Government   Cloud   to   advance   this   goal   could   be   crafted   along   the   following
lines:

1.   Transparency

Federal   agencies   are   directed   to   require   in   all   service   level   agreements   or   other   provisioning
of   cloud   computing   or   data   center   center   services   minimum   public   reporting   requirements.
Cloud   and   data   center   service   providers   must   publicly   and   regularly   report   their   energy
consumption,   energy   mix   and   related   GHG   emissions.    At   a   minimum,   this   reporting   must
include:

A. Annual   reporting   of   the   electricity   demand,   source   of   electricity   supply,   and

GHG   for   each   data   center   used   to   fulﬁll   any   portion   of   federal   cloud   contracts.

B. Consistent   WRI/WBCSD   Scope   2   GHG   reporting   requirements  ,   where
renewable   energy   that   has   been   purchased   by   the   cloud   provider   via
contractual   instruments,   reporting   of   GHG   emissions   under   (1)(A)   must   include
both   location   based   reporting   and   market   based   emissions   reporting.

131

C. Renewable   energy   claims   must   be   based   either   on   delivered   electricity   to   the
data   center   from   the   local   utility   or   electricity   service   provider,   or   in   the   case
of   renewables   secured   via   contractual   instruments,   must   be   bundled   with   the
sale   of   electricity   generated   within   the   local   balancing   region.

2.   Performance

To   be   eligible   for   government   cloud   computing   contracts,   cloud   computing   companies/data
center   operators   must   have   adopted   the   following   policies   and   meet   the   following   clean
energy   performance   benchmarks   for   all   data   centers   utilized   to   fulﬁll   the   contract:

A. By   2024,   all   data   centers   servicing   federal   contracts   must   be   powered   by

electricity   from   100%   renewable   sources   through   one   or   more   of   the   following:

a. Onsite   generation
b. Grid   based   power   direct   from   local   utility   or   electricity   service   provider
c. Contractual   instruments   for   renewable   energy   from   sources   located
within   the   local   electricity   balancing   region   to   match   the   annual
electricity   demand   of   the   individual   data   centers   delivering   federal
cloud   computing   services.    Contracted   renewable   energy   must   be   from
a   new   and   additional   deployment   of   renewable   energy.
B. By   2030,   all   data   centers   servicing   federal   contracts   must   be   powered   by

electricity   from   100%   renewable   sources   through   one   or   more   of   the   following
means:

a. Onsite   generation
b. Grid   based   power   directly   from   local   utility   or   electricity   service

provider

c. Contractual   instruments   for   renewable   energy   from   sources   located
within   the   local   electricity   balancing   region   to   meet   the   electricity
demand   of   the   individual   data   centers   delivering   federal   cloud
computing   services   on   a   24/7,   365   day   basis.    Contracted   renewable
energy   must   be   from   a   new   and   additional   deployment   of   renewable
energy.
