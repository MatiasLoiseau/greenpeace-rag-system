©GREENPEACE / N COBBINGimageGreenpeace and an independent
NASA-funded scientist completed
measurements of melt lakes on the
Greenland Ice Sheet that show its
vulnerability to warming temperatures.
The measurements are the last
scheduled activity as the Greenpeace
ship Arctic Sunrise wraps up its two-
month expedition to document the
impacts of climate change on
Greenland's ice sheet and glaciers.
The high seas are currently open to ﬁshing by anyone interested in
doing so, with only minimal ﬂag state controls. Even in those areas
where there are some management controls, patchy regulation and
weak enforcement mean that prohibited activities often continue
unabated.
Instead of working to ensure clean and healthy oceans for the future,
the current high seas oceans governance regime rewards pirate ﬁshers
and those who plunder the oceans. It encourages the ﬁshing industry to
go looking for new species to replace those that have been overﬁshed:
Going deeper and further south in the search for ﬁsh to supply to
consumers in industrialized and northern countries. Under the current
regime, rich countries and distant water ﬁshing nations are beneﬁting atthe expense of our oceans and the many coastal communities of the
global South who are directly dependent on healthy oceans for their
food security and livelihoods.
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) does more than
simply offer States the right to use our oceans. It also requires that
States fulﬁll numerous duties: To “cooperate with other States in taking
such measures for their respective nationals as may be necessary for
the conservation of the living resources of the high seas” (Article 117),
and “… to protect and preserve the marine environment” (Art. 192). Yet,
industrial-scale destructive ﬁshing practices on the high seas continue
unchallenged and undermine the duties of States to individually andcollectively protect and preserve the marine environment of this global
commons. As a result, our ﬁsh stocks and ocean biodiversity are in
serious jeopardy. And time is running out.
There must be a shift from the current management regime away from
serving ﬁshing and industrial interests towards a comprehensive
ecosystem based management regime with the precautionary principle
at its core. The high seas particularly suffer from this ‘Wild West’
mentality. Anyone who has the money, the technology and the
inclination can go and take whatever they want, with very few
regulations to ensure sustainability or equity. The few regulations that
are in place are diluted even further by weak enforcement.

All around the world, ﬁsheries are collapsing and marine ecosystems are
undergoing fundamental shifts - the consequence of the woefully
inadequate management regimes currently in place. In particular, thehigh seas are being plundered on a vast scale and with alarming speed,
creating one of the biggest unseen and potentially irreversible
environmental disasters of our time. Vast legal gaps together with the
lack of political will are leading to the widespread destruction of marine
life across the high seas. To stop this destruction the current
presumptions in favour of freedom of the high seas and the freedom to
ﬁsh
2must be replaced by ones that entrench the concept of freedom for
the seas: Where the ecosystem approach and precautionary principle
are considered as the fundamental core of all oceans management.
Those who want to undertake activities on the high seas must prove
that they will not harm marine life in these international waters beforethey are given access, so that the protection of marine ecosystems is
the underlying principle that guides the future management of the highseas.
In recent years, our understanding of the diverse and unique nature of
deep sea life has expanded, as has the technology capable of
destroying it, making it difﬁcult to control what occurs on the vast
expanses of our largely unregulated high seas. New and emergingactivities and ﬁshing methods that were once inconceivable are now
threatening the future of deep sea biodiversity, as they have done in thecase of coastal and pelagic species. We now know that the oceans’bounties are not inexhaustible, but vulnerable, complex and ﬁnite.Destructive and unsustainable ﬁshing practices, such as bottom-trawling, as well as illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) ﬁshing,
mining and scientiﬁc and commercial exploration of deep-sea areas are
all threatening these vulnerable habitats.GreenpeaceProposalsto
RevolutioniseHighSeasOceansGovernance

5The UN General Assembly should convene a negotiating conference
to develop a new implementing agreement under UNCLOS toaddress the current gaps in oceans governance and ensure the
long-term conservation and sustainable management of livingmarine species, ecosystems and biological diversity, the protection
and preservation of the marine environment, and the fair and
equitable sharing of the beneﬁts arising out of the utilisation marine
genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Such an
agreement would build on the existing framework of UNCLOS, and
integrate best practices and norms found in other international and
regional agreements, with the application of the ecosystemapproach and the precautionary principle at its core.
6All extractive activities should be halted in high seas areas where
there are no management regimes in place (most of the high seas),
effectively creating large-scale marine reserves until such time as:
aAn internationally representative panel of scientists had been
provided the time and resources to use an ecosystem-based
management and precautionary paradigm to assess what is out
there, identify key areas, and
idesignate a global network of high seas marine reserves
(expanses of oceans where extractive industries such as ﬁshingand mining, as well as disposal activities, are prohibited):
iiidentify areas that could be opened to extractive practices, but
would require prior environmental impact assessments in suchareas based on Articles 5 and 6 (ecosystem-based and
precautionary approach) of the United Nations Fish Stocks
Agreement (FSA), that would place the burden of proof on
these industries to show that their planned activities will not
harm the marine environment, and that they will bear the costs(under a strict liability regime) for any harm done;
bThe beneﬁts of any extractive activities in such areas would beshared on an equitable basis and managed through, for example,a fund that could be set up to monitor and enforce regulations
adopted to ensure the sustainable and equitable management
and beneﬁt sharing of such resources. This would include active
representation of State and non-State actors in a transparent and
accountable manner;
cThese activities could not be conducted until policy makers hadthe opportunity to develop legally binding measures, includingclear sanctions against violating states, in order to regulate such
activities.

Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (1995) (FSA) by allcoastal and distant water ﬁshing States.GreenpeaceProposalstoRevolutioniseHighSeasOceans
Governance
1The creation of a global network of marine reserves on the high
seas. Marine reserves are highly protected areas that are off-limits to
all extractive and destructive uses, including ﬁshing. A global
network of marine reserves would provide the insurance policy
needed against uncertainty in decision making processes, protecting
marine biodiversity in places and times they most need it. It wouldbuild resilience in the marine ecosystem, and ﬂexibility in the midst of
future unknowns (i.e., climate change impacts), allowing oceanbiodiversity in targeted areas to replenish and ﬂourish. In order to be
fully effective, these areas should cover 40% of the high seas and beof sufﬁcient scale to ensure the integrity and functioning of high seasecosystems. The network should protect the whole range of high
seas ecosystems as well as areas that are biologically rich or
particularly vulnerable to present or possible future human impacts,
such as ﬁshing or seabed mining. Creating a global network ofmarine reserves is the single most effective tool for protecting the
marine environment including deep sea ecosystems, and wouldprovide the vital underpinning for implementing the ecosystemapproach.
2Immediate action, led by industrialised countries, to keep globalmean temperature rise below 2°C. In Bali, December 2007, the
world agreed on a vital next phase of global negotiations to deliver a
strengthened Kyoto Protocol in 2009
3. Discussions at the UN
General Assembly should focus on how we can deliver on the Bali
Mandate, including through developed countries emissionreductions commitments of at least 30% by 2020, and by at least80% in 2050.
3The immediate implementation of UN General Assembly Resolution
on Sustainable Fisheries (A/Res 61/105) which calls on States andRegional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) to takeimmediate action to sustainably manage ﬁsh stocks and protectvulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) from the adverse impacts ofbottom-trawling on the high seas.
4The UN General Assembly should adopt a resolution establishing amoratorium on high seas bottom-trawling to protect deep seabiodiversity of the high seas by all States, if the UN’s review in 2009concludes that RFMOs and States have failed to implementResolution 61/105 (as described above). This interim measure wouldprovide scientists with the time to assess the range and extent ofthis biodiversity, and politicians with the space to fully implement
61/105 as well as negotiate longer-term measures that would
ensure that bottom trawling on the high seas is effectively regulated
and sustainably and equitably managed.

sanction vessels, their owners and operators, as well as redlisting
those that have reﬂagged vessels or attempted to do so.
5Closing ports to non-complying ﬁshing vessels and to vessels
ﬂying the ﬂags of non-complying States.
6Intensive in-port vessel inspections with the right to sanction such
vessels provided by intergovernmental port state enforcementagreements.
7Outlawing transshipment at sea of any species that could be
caught on the high seas.
8Closing markets to ﬁsh and ﬁsh products that do not carrycredible certiﬁcation establishing that the ﬁsh and ﬁsh products
caught on the high seas were derived from licensed ﬁshing
operations. Using established international trade regulations (suchas CITES listings) to regulate trade in species that are alreadyunder threat.
9Harmonising and adopting national laws and regulations toimplement international measures to control nationals engaged in
all activities undertaken on the high seas, including ﬁshing or
owning or operating vessels ﬁshing in areas beyond nationaljurisdiction. These should include prior notiﬁcation to States bynationals of their proposed activities, along with requirements forenvironmental impact assessments for such activities.
10Exchanging, pooling and publicising information on vessels and
companies involved in high seas ﬁshing, including the operators,
captains, beneﬁcial owners of vessels, and those providing
banking, insurance and other services to them.
11Requiring that information on vessels and companies interested in
engaging in high seas ﬁshing be provided to the central
monitoring, compliance and enforcement authority in a standardinternational format, before authorisation to access these ﬁsheriesis given. Where vessels or companies have been ‘redlisted’ by the
authorities, permission to ﬁsh will not be granted.
12Requiring under domestic law, that prior to any vessel being
granted the ﬂag of a State, the information stated above issubmitted to the central compliance authority. A prerequisite for
‘ﬂagging’ will then be the conﬁrmation by the central authority that
the vessel, its owners and operators, have not contravened anyinternational or national regulations.
13Cooperation among coastal states and those participating inrelevant regional management arrangements to ensure that all
States have sufﬁcient capacity to manage and control their coastal
and EEZ ﬁsheries to ensure compliance with national regulationsand international obligations.8Application of the FSA to discrete high seas ﬁsh stocks.
9Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) need amajor overhaul (see p.6 for more details). Those that have notadopted the ecosystem approach and precautionary principle to
ﬁsheries management as directed in Articles 5 and 6 of the FSA,should be given two years by the United Nations GeneralAssembly to do so, or face the closure of the ﬁsheries under theirjurisdiction until this has been achieved.
10The international ﬁshing ﬂeet at national, regional and international
levels needs to be substantially reduced to deal with the realitiesof the threats to ocean life today. Incentives must be developed toreduce such capacity. Harmful subsidies to the ﬁshing industry
must be removed.
Legallybindingmeasurestoregulateindustrialﬁshingonthe
highseascouldinclude:
1The establishment of a central monitoring, control and compliance
authority for all vessels active on the high seas that would befunded by dues paid by States according to the number ofvessels authorised to undertake extractive activities on the highseas. Dues paid by vessels licensed to ﬁsh in such waters could
fund compliance, monitoring and enforcement. This would deter
such vessels from ‘turning a blind eye’ to their illegal, unregulated
and unreported (IUU) counterparts, as these ﬁshers would actually
be costing them money.
2Establishment of a single, centralised, compatible VesselMonitoring System (VMS) for all vessels licensed to ﬁsh on thehigh seas to enable States to distinguish between vessels
authorised to ﬁsh on the high seas or an Exclusive EconomicZone (EEZ). Vessels unable to provide VMS data for any part of
their voyage would not be permitted to land their catch. Such asystem would be operated by the centralised complianceauthority, which would report to all States on infractions by anyvessels in the system, and permit any States participating in thesystem to take punitive actions against such vessels in theirrespective jurisdictions.
3“Redlisting” of ﬁshing vessels and companies that breachconservation measures, i.e.: deny ﬁshing vessels, and theirowners/operators the authorisation to ﬁsh by any method and forany species on the high seas.
4Adopting national legislation that requires a ‘genuine link’ madebetween the ﬂag-State and vessels carrying their ﬂags, and thatmakes it illegal for nationals to reﬂag vessels to avoid compliance.Such legislation should include the right for a State to legally

The most common mechanism for ‘managing’ high seas ﬁsheries is
through Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs),but it has been widely acknowledged in intergovernmental fora that
RFMOs are failing in their mandate (both the UN Food andAgricultural Organisation (FAO) and the High Seas Task Force have
recently recommended that RFMOs undergo performance reviewson an urgent basis).
4Although the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement
(FSA) designated RFMOs as the primary mechanism for managing
and conserving high seas straddling and highly migratory ﬁshstocks (with FSA Articles 5 and 6 being the legal cornerstones forapplying the ecosystem approach and precautionary principle to
ﬁsheries management), States have consistently failed to useRFMOs to implement their speciﬁc obligations under these Articles.As recommended in the Chatham House Report
5, RFMOs should
have a transparent allocation process apart from the decision-
making process that determines total allowable catch. They alsoseem to have severe problems addressing the loss of sharks,albatrosses, marine turtles and other species impacted by ﬁshing
activities in their waters. Another problem is that the FSA coversonly straddling and highly migratory ﬁsh stocks,
6and the
management of discrete high seas stocks, such as orange roughy,is not covered under the FSA. Most RFMOs operate behind closeddoors; they need to have transparent decision-making processes as
well as make their data publicly available.
Beyond the intrinsic institutional problems inherent in RFMOs, an
additional problem is that most of the high seas are not covered by
RFMOs, and accordingly, most of the world’s ﬁsh stocks remain
unregulated. In the last two years, a number of RFMOs have beenor are in the process of being established, including, the South
Paciﬁc RFMO for discrete high seas and straddling ﬁsh stocks, theNorth Paciﬁc RFMO, and the South Indian Ocean FisheriesAgreement (SIOFA). Still, these RFMOs are in their infancy and not
yet operational; signiﬁcant gaps in RFMO coverage remain. Asdiscussed above, even, for those areas that are regulated, RFMOs
have had a very disappointing track record in effectively managing
their ﬁsheries or applying ecosystem-based ﬁsheries management.
RFMOsmustbefundamentallychangedtooperateas
RegionalOceansManagementOrganisations(ROMOs)sothattheycaneffectivelyimplementtheecosystemapproach
asmandatedbytheFSA. As ROMOs, they must be given the
functional ability and capacity as well as mandate to address the
broader ecological impacts of human activities on the world’s
oceans. Since such change will take time, it is essential that the
international community recognises RFMOs as a single, limited tool
that could be effective in short to medium-term oceans governance.
The international community cannot wait around hoping for this
change while marine biodiversity suffers. The RFMOs must adoptand implement uniform conservation and management measuresand incorporate the ecosystem approach in their decision-makingprocesses now in order to stop the destruction of high seasbiodiversity while medium and long-term measures are developedand implemented.RFMOs:RegularlyFailingtoManageourOceans
