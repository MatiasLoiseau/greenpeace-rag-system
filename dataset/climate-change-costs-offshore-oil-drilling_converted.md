The Obama administration has proposed an expansion of offshore oil and gas
leasing, with new lease sales scheduled to take place from 2017 to 2022 for the
Arctic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

Consumption of the oil expected to be produced under this Five-Year Proposed
Program will lead to a net increase in global carbon emissions of about 850 mil-
lion metric tons of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) over the lifespan of the leases. This
is equivalent to the annual emissions of 3.6 million passenger vehicles over fifty
years.

Of this total, about 440 Mt CO2 will come from Arctic drilling in the Beaufort and
Chukchi Seas, and about 384 Mt CO2 will come from the Gulf of Mexico.

These carbon emissions will impose high costs to society in coming decades relat-
ed to human health, flood damages, agricultural productivity and other impacts.
Considering the 50-60 year timescales for the production of this oil and incor-
porating official government estimates of the Social Costs of Carbon (SCC), we
find the net social costs from these downstream emissions range from $58.6 to
$179.2 billion (2017 US$).

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) does not currently include cli-
mate change costs in its assessment of the environmental impacts of its Proposed
Program. However the net social costs calculated in this report are comparable
in magnitude to the estimated economic value generated from selling the oil and
gas produced under the plan.

This omission indicates a fundamental flaw in BOEM’s analysis of the environ-
mental impacts of its Five-Year Program. President Obama must ensure that a full
accounting for the costs of climate change is incorporated into all environmental
reviews for offshore oil and gas drilling.

Introduction

In December 2015, President Barack Obama joined other world leaders in Paris to agree to an
international accord to address climate change. The latest science makes it clear that we must
leave the vast majority of known fossil fuel reserves unburned if we are to have any chance at
fulfilling that accord and limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.1 President Obama has
recognized this fact, stating that “if we’re going to prevent large parts of this Earth from becom-
ing not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we’re going to have to keep some
fossil fuels in the ground.”2

Despite advancing a number of commendable policies to lower emissions of heat-trapping
greenhouse gases, the Obama administration has continued to lease out federally-owned lands
and waters to fossil fuel companies seeking to extract coal, oil and gas. This policy is coun-
ter-productive and threatens to undermine President Obama’s climate legacy. Putting an end
to federal fossil fuel leasing would significantly reduce global CO2 emissions and make it easier
for the United States to meet the Paris climate targets. While President Obama has opened a
programmatic review of the federal coal leasing process, the ultimate policy outcomes of that
review are uncertain. Furthermore, his administration is currently drafting a plan to expand off-
shore oil and gas drilling.3

The draft environmental impact statement for the proposed offshore oil and gas program does
not even fully consider the climate change impacts of offshore oil drilling. In particular, the Bu-
reau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) fails to assess the greenhouse gas emissions that
would arise from consuming the oil and gas extracted from the federal offshore waters.4 BOEM
dismisses the need for this analysis by claiming (but not demonstrating) that expanded offshore
oil drilling would have little to no impact on global greenhouse gas emissions, and that any such
impacts would be “highly uncertain.”5

To remedy this gap in BOEM’s analysis, this report builds upon a recent study by the Stockholm
Environment Institute on federal fossil fuel leasing6 and calculates the net CO2 emissions and
social costs associated with BOEM’s own estimates for the oil and gas produced under this
Five-Year Program.

Methodology

This report calculates the social costs of carbon emissions associated with the consumption of
oil based upon BOEM’s own estimates for the 2017-2022 Five-Year Program.7 BOEM’s pro-
duction estimates and timelines8 are converted to net CO2 emissions using the methodology
described in Erickson & Lazarus (2016),9 and those net emissions are then converted into net
social costs using the findings of the Interagency Working Group (IWG) on the Social Cost of
Carbon (SCC).10

1. BOEM Production Scenarios

BOEM’s Proposed Program for the 2017-2022 Five-Year Plan, presents production estimates
for oil, natural gas and barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) under Low, Mid and High-Price scenarios
for five regional planning areas (see Table 1). These estimates are only for the oil and gas that
would be leased and produced under the 2017-2022 program, and do not include production
associated with current leases or production anticipated from future leasing programs after
2022.

This analysis considers the climate impacts of offshore oil production under the Mid-Price sce-
nario for oil produced from the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea, Cook Inlet and the Gulf of Mex-
ico. This analysis does not consider the climate impacts of natural gas production nor does it
consider oil produced from the Atlantic planning region, which was removed from the Proposed
Program in March 2016.12 The Mid-Price scenario corresponds to price levels of of $100 per
barrel of oil and $5.34 per million cubic feet of gas.13

The Climate Change Costs of Offshore Oil Drilling6

Under these assumptions, total oil production from the Proposed Program is 7,781 million
barrels (Mbbl).

2. Net CO2 Emissions from Offshore Oil Production

The analysis considers the net impacts on global CO2 emissions in the case that the 2017-2022
Proposed Program is cancelled and none of BOEM’s anticipated production takes place. In
particular, it compares global CO2 emissions under the Proposed Program to a “No Sale” option
where the scheduled lease sales do not take place and energy markets respond to the changes
in global oil and gas supply. Despite BOEM’s claims, the avoided oil production under the “No
Sale” option will be partially, but not completely, replaced by fuels from other sources, and this
will lead to a net drop in global emissions.

To convert from oil production estimates to net carbon dioxide emissions, we follow the meth-
odology outlined in Erickson & Lazarus (2016). That study found that global consumption of oil
responds to changes in oil supply, such that a one unit decrease in oil production will lead to a
decrease of oil consumption of 0.44 units. The study also found that a decrease in oil produc-
tion will lead to an increase of 0.22 units of oil substitutes, such as biofuels, natural gas or elec-
tricity. This substitute fuel mix is assumed to have 85% the carbon intensity of oil. These shifts
in fuel supply lead to an overall decrease in fuel consumption of 22% (-0.44 + 0.22) for each
barrel of oil that is not produced.14Applying this methodology to BOEM’s production estimates
for each planning region, the findings are:

Therefore full production and consumption of the oil found in BOEM’s production estimates
would result in a net increase in global CO2 emissions of around 850 million metric tons of CO2
over the full timespan of the leases, in comparison to the “No Sale” option. This would represent
average annual emissions of 17 Mt CO2 over 50 years, which is equivalent to the yearly emis-
sions from 3.6 million cars.15

The Climate Change Costs of Offshore Oil Drilling7

These findings are sensitive to how the oil market changes in response to oil production and
to assumptions about the availability and carbon intensity of oil substitutes. These assump-
tions are modeled by Erickson & Lazarus using a few key parameters.16 This analysis adopts the
central values for the parameters used in that report, although we also consider two scenarios
where those parameters are varied in order to test other future energy market possibilities. For
example, if we were to adopt the assumptions from that study’s “lower carbon world” scenario,
net emissions reduction from the “No Sale” option would total 1757 Mt CO2, whereas adopting
the assumptions from the “higher carbon world” scenario would lead to emissions reductions of
only 117 Mt CO2.

BOEM’s production timelines extend well beyond the 2015-2040 time period considered by Er-
ickson & Lazarus. In the years beyond 2040, technological advances and concerted internation-
al action to address climate change are likely to create conditions similar to the “lower carbon
world” scenario. The assumption that these key parameters remain constant beyond 2040 is
therefore likely to be a conservative assumption that understates the emissions reductions from
reducing oil production.

BOEM also calculates GHG emissions from production and transport under the Proposed Pro-
gram and the “No Sale” option.17 Their methodology finds higher net emissions under the “No
Sale” option mainly due to an increase in oil imports to replace the unproduced oil. However, for
each program area the decrease in downstream emissions (as calculated here in Table 2) is larger
than the increased emissions from production and transport, implying that the net impact of the
“No Sale” option is to decrease overall global GHG emissions.

3.BOEM Production Timelines

In order to estimate the social costs of producing and consuming the oil in BOEM’s scenarios it
is necessary to know when the oil is produced and consumed. BOEM’s Draft Programmatic En-
vironmental Impact Statement provides estimated production timelines for the various planning
regions under the Mid-Price scenario,18 which were digitized with publicly available software
(see Figure 1 below). Separate production timelines for the Western and Central/Eastern Gulf of
Mexico were combined to provide one timeline for the entire Gulf.

BOEM’s production timelines show total oil and gas production (in units of million BOE/year)
over a 50-60 year timespan for each region. Since this analysis only considers the carbon im-
pacts of oil production (rather than oil and gas together) timelines were re-scaled by assuming
that the amount of oil produced each year is proportional to the overall fraction of oil produced
in the scenario for each region considered. 19

4. Social Cost of Carbon

In 2015 the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon revised their estimates for
the social cost of a metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted in the years from 2010 to 2050.20 The
purpose of the social cost of carbon estimates is:

  “to allow agencies to incorporate the social benefits of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emis-
sions into cost-benefit analyses of regulatory actions that impact cumulative global emissions.
The SCC is an estimate of the monetized damages associated with an incremental increase in
carbon emissions in a given year. It is intended to include (but is not limited to) changes in net
agricultural productivity, human health, property damages from increased flood risk, and the
value of ecosystem services due to climate change.”

The results are presented for a range of discount rates (5%, 3%, 2.5%), which represent different
tradeoffs in how society values future costs and benefits in comparison to the present. These
social cost estimates are considered to be incomplete and limited by the ability of the underly-
ing models to fully capture the uncertain impacts of climate change in the coming decades.21  To
address some of this uncertainty, the Working Group also tabulates the 95th percentile of the
3% discount rate in order to “represent higher-than-expected impacts from temperature change
further out in the tails of the SCC distribution.”

Social cost of carbon estimates are reported in five year intervals and increase over time. This
increase is due to the fact that the emission of a metric ton of CO2 will be more damaging in the
future than it is today, assuming that the cumulative level of CO2 in the atmosphere will be high-
er and the “physical and economic systems become more stressed in response to greater levels
of climatic change.”22

In its own Net Benefits analysis, BOEM adopts a 3% discount rate. For this analysis, we present
social cost estimates using both a 3% discount rate (central value) and the 95th percentile of
the 3% discount rate. In 2017 US dollars, the SCC of a metric ton of CO2 rises from $42 in 2015
to $81 in 2050. For the 95th percentile, the SCC rises from $123 in 2015 to $249 in 2050 (see
Figure 1b).

Greenpeace sums BOEM’s production timelines in 5-year periods, calculates net CO2 emissions
for each period and applies the social cost corresponding to the first year of the period. We also
apply the 2050 social cost estimates for all years beyond 2050 (when the IWG estimates stop).
Because the social cost of carbon is likely to continue increasing beyond 2050, this assumption
leads us to conservatively underestimate the total social costs from BOEM’s scenarios. All eco-
nomic costs and benefits are reported in 2017 US$.

The social costs of the Proposed Program due to downstream CO2 emissions are summarized
in Table 3. Assuming a 3% discount rate, the social costs for the full program amount to $58.6
billion (2017 US$) of which about $32 billion would come from production in the Arctic Ocean
and $25 billion from the Gulf of Mexico.

Given that SCC likely underestimates the full costs of climate change, we also calculate total
costs assuming the 95th percentile of the 3% discount rate. Under this assumption, the social
costs of the full program amount to $179.2 billion of which $98 billion come from Arctic oil pro-
duction and $76 billion from the Gulf of Mexico.

The Climate Change Costs of Offshore Oil Drilling11

Discussion

In support of its Proposed Program of expanded offshore oil drilling in the Arctic and the Gulf of
Mexico, BOEM conducts a Net Benefits Analysis, which weighs the economic gains of expanded
oil and gas production against the environmental and social costs.

BOEM’s Net Benefits are comprised of three components: Net Economic Value (the profits
shared by oil companies and governments from selling the produced oil and gas), Environmental
& Social Costs23 (negative external costs imposed by production activity) and Domestic Eco-
nomic Surplus (benefits that accrue to consumers and producers in the U.S. economy). For each
component, the values are compared between the Proposed Program and the “No Sale” option
to provide an Incremental Net Benefit resulting from BOEM’s action.24 For the Mid-Price sce-
nario and assuming a 3% discount rate, BOEM finds positive net benefits from the Proposed
Program (as compared to the “No Sale” option) for each planning region.25 Those net benefit
figures are included in Table 3 for com-
parison.

However, greenhouse gas emissions are
not included as Environmental & Social
Costs and are not incorporated into this
Net Benefits analysis. BOEM does cal-
culate GHG emissions from production
and transport, but it does not monetize
the social costs of those emissions or
include them in the Net Benefits analysis. Furthermore, the agency does not consider “down-
stream” emissions from oil and gas consumption at all, claiming that those emissions would be
similar under the “No Sale” option as under the Proposed Program.

The social costs imposed
by downstream emissions
may exceed the net
benefits calculated by BOEM.

Despite this refusal, GHG emissions and their attendant social costs are likely to be significant
factors and must be included in any credible analysis of BOEM’s Proposed Program. Using BO-
EM’s own production estimates and timelines, we calculate that the Proposed Program would
lead to a net global increase in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the social costs imposed by net
downstream emissions from the Program would represent a significant fraction (about 41%) of
the total incremental net benefits calculated by BOEM. If social costs are considered at the 95th
percentile, then downstream emissions would impose social costs that exceed BOEM’s
net benefits.

The Climate Change Costs of Offshore Oil Drilling12

The case of the Beaufort Sea is instructive. The production timeline for the Beaufort peaks
around 2050 -- roughly a decade later than the other planning area timelines. Because BOEM
assumes the Beaufort Sea oil is produced and consumed at later dates when SCC values are
higher, its downstream emissions impose a higher social cost in comparison to the economic
benefits of producing the oil. Once the initial upfront investments in drilling platforms and pipe-
lines are made, the cost of pumping each barrel of oil is comparatively cheap and can continue
for decades.26 In this way, planning decisions made now risk “locking-in” carbon emissions far
into the future when we can no longer afford to pay the price. Additionally, the steadily rising
SCC values illustrate that downstream emissions will play an increasingly larger role in any fu-
ture Five-Year programs.

However, it is not appropriate to simply
subtract the downstream social costs
from BOEM’s net benefits. BOEM’s cur-
rent methodology is limited in a number
of ways that make direct comparison diffi-
cult.27 For example, BOEM only considers
the domestic costs and benefits of oil and
gas production and limits its consideration
of various non-domestic costs and bene-
fits. However, a significant fraction of the
downstream CO2 emissions and social costs calculated in this report are non-domestic.28 Addi-
tionally, the social cost estimates in this report do not address emissions from production and
transport, or emissions from natural gas or natural gas substitutes.

The U.S. public and
policy  makers  deserve  to  have
complete information about
climate change impacts
of oil drilling.

Nonetheless, these results indicate that the omissions of downstream emissions is a significant
flaw in BOEM’s analysis. Climate change is an inherently global phenomenon and oil and gas are
traded on global markets, yet BOEM’s analysis narrowly assesses domestic impacts and ignores
costs that could potentially swamp any net benefits. Such a myopic perspective cuts against the
spirit of the National Environmental Policy Act and contradicts guidance drafted by the Council
on Environmental Quality on incorporating climate change into environmental assessments.29
The U.S. public and government policy makers deserve to have this information available.
Should BOEM decide to conduct a comprehensive climate analysis of its activities, it might well
reach different conclusions regarding the value of offshore oil drilling.

The Climate Change Costs of Offshore Oil Drilling13

Furthermore, BOEM’s analysis of the anticipated production and market response to the Pro-
posed Program is based on “policy-neutral” energy forecasts provided by the U.S. Energy Infor-
mation Administration (EIA) in their Annual Energy Outlook.30 The EIA’s Reference Case does not
incorporate the climate commitments agreed to in Paris and forecasts a high-level of demand
for fossil fuels in the coming decades. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 under the
Reference Case are over 400% higher than official U.S. climate goals.31 Given President Obama’s
high-level commitments to fight climate change, the use of such “business as usual” assump-
tions is inappropriate.

A full analysis of the costs and benefits of offshore oil and gas drilling is beyond the scope of
this report, but the magnitude of the missing downstream analysis strongly indicates that BO-
EM’s current modeling is inadequate. A comprehensive climate analysis would seek to assess
BOEM’s policies in the context of our international climate commitments and the latest scientif-
ic information, with the goal of providing the information necessary for policy makers to apply a
“climate test” to energy policy decisions. Such an analysis must encompass global impacts, direct
and indirect emissions, and should include a range of scenarios to capture the uncertainties in
both markets and future policies. At least one such scenario must assess the program in the
context of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

Given that President Obama has committed the United States to addressing climate change at
the highest level, it remains a serious dereliction of duty for BOEM to provide less-than-com-
plete information to the public and policy makers.
