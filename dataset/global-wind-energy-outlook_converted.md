Foreword

IN  MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, wind energy has already

grown to be a mainstream energy source. This growth has long

been driven by concerns about global climate change, mainly

in the developed world and especially in Europe.

Climate change is a complicated and alarming predicament.

As devastating as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita may have been,

their wrath is nothing compared to the devastation that

climate change will wreak on our planet if governments fail to

address the world‘s fossil fuel addiction. Cutting greenhouse

gas emissions makes both environmental and economic

sense. The goal of climate policy should be to keep global

mean temperature rise to less than 2 ºC above pre-industrial

levels in order to avoid dramatic damage to ecosystems and

disruption to the climate system. To meet these targets, the world needs to fundamentally change the way it

generates and uses energy in the coming decade.

However, other challenges such as energy supply security and the volatility of fossil fuel prices have become just as

pressing, both in the OECD and in emerging market. Global energy needs are growing at a staggering rate world

wide. Over-reliance on energy imports from few, mostly politically unstable countries and volatile oil and gas

prices make for a shaky supply situation that is already inﬂicting massive drains on the global economy.

Wind energy is the most attractive solution to the world’s energy challenges. It is clean and fuel-free. Moreover, wind

is indigenous and enough wind blows across the globe to cope with the ever increasing electricity demand. This report

demonstrates that wind technology is not a dream for the future – it is real, it is mature and it can be deployed on a

large scale. Thanks to twenty years of technological progress, wind turbines have come a long way and a wind farm

today acts much more like a conventional power station. Moreover, wind power generation is increasingly competi-

tive with conventional fossil fuel sources and already today is on a par with new coal or gas ﬁred power stations.

Already now, wind energy is rapidly developing into a mainstream power source in many countries of the world,

with over 60,000 MW of installed capacity world wide and an average annual market growth rate of 28%. Wind

energy could provide as much as 29% of the world’s electricity needs by 2030, given the political will to promote

its large scale deployment paired with far-reaching energy efﬁciency measures.

The political choices of the coming years will determine the world’s environmental and economic situation for

many decades to come. While the industrialised world urgently needs to rethink its energy strategy, the developing

world should learn from past mistakes and build their economies on the strong foundation of sustainable energy

supply. For the sake of a sound environment, political stability and thriving economies, now is the time to commit

to a truly secure and sustainable energy future, built on clean technologies and promoting regional development

and the creation of millions of new jobs. The world cannot afford to stick to the ‘conventional’ energy development

path, relying on fossil fuels, nuclear and other outdated technologies from past centuries. Wind can and has to play

a leading role in the world’s energy future.

THE GLOBAL STATUS OF WIND POWER

The current goal for wind power in China is to reach

5,000 MW by the end of 2010. Looking further ahead, 30 GW

of wind power has been proposed by the Chinese government

in its long term planning up to 2020. By the end of that year

it is estimated that, in order to satisfy growing demand, total

power capacity in China will have reached 1,000 GW. Wind

generated electricity would by then represent 1.5% of total

power production.

The wind energy industry in Japan has also been expanding,

partly spurred by a government requirement for electricity

companies to source an increasing percentage of their supply

from renewables (Renewable Portfolio Standard-type law),

partly by the introduction of market incentives. These include

both a premium price for the output from renewable plants

and capital grants towards clean energy projects. The result

distortions continue to disadvantage renewable generators in

the power market – from discriminatory connection charges

to potential abuse of their dominant power by major

companies.

Grid Integration

One of the biggest mistakes often made during public

discussion about integrating wind energy into the electricity

network is that it is treated in isolation. An electricity system

is in practice much like a massive bath tub, with hundreds of

taps (power stations) providing the input and millions of plug

holes (consumers) draining the output. The taps and plugs are

opening and closing all the time. For the grid operators, the

task is to make sure there is enough water in the bath to

maintain system security. It is therefore the combined effects

of all technologies, as well as the demand patterns, that

matter.

Issues for Integrating Wind Power

Despite these successful experiences, a number of issues still

have to be addressed if large quantities of wind power are to

be successfully integrated into the grid network. These issues

relate to system operation, grid connection, system stability

and infrastructure improvements.

S YSTEM OPERATION

At ﬁrst sight wind energy appears to present a difﬁcult

challenge for the power system, often resulting in high

estimates for ancillary service costs or assumptions that wind

capacity must be “backed up” with large amounts of

conventional generation. However, such assessments often

overlook key factors. These include:

Recent Studies

A number of recent studies have concluded that a large

contribution from wind energy to power generation needs is

technically and economically feasible, and in the same order

of magnitude as the contributions from conventional

technologies developed over the past century. The barriers to

increasing wind power penetration are not inherently

technical, they conclude, but mainly a matter of regulatory,

institutional and market modiﬁcations.

A study by the German Energy Agency (DENA) - “Planning

for grid integration of wind energy in Germany onshore

areas of open countryside, raises issues of visual impact, noise and the
potential effects on local ecology and wildlife. Many of these issues are
addressed during consultation with the local planning authority, from
whom consent must be obtained to proceed with a development, and in

world market increasing to 16% by 2030, South America’s

share rising to 9% and the Paciﬁc region’s to 7%. Europe’s

share would make up only 19% of the world’s total wind

capacity. Given the slow pace of progress so far, and

continuing market barriers, a less important contribution is

expected from the Transition Economies than had previously

been envisaged.

In all three scenarios it is assumed that an increasing share of

new capacity is accounted for by the replacement of old plant.

This is based on a 20 year average lifetime for a wind turbine.

Turbines replaced within the timescale of the scenarios are

assumed to be of the same installed capacity as the original

models. The result is that an increasing proportion of the

annual level of installed capacity will come from repowered

turbines. These new machines will contribute to the overall

level of investment, manufacturing output and employment.

Taking account of these assumptions, the expected annual

saving in CO₂ from the Reference scenario will be

339 million tonnes in 2020, rising to 910 million tonnes in

2050. The cumulative saving over the whole scenario period

would be 22,800 million tonnes.

Under the Moderate scenario the saving would be 825 mil-

ENERGY POLICY ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Electricity Market Reform

Essential reforms in the electricity sector are necessary if new

renewable energy technologies are to be accepted on a larger

scale. These reforms include:

REMOVAL OF ELECTRI CITY SECTO R B AR R I E R S

Current energy legislation on planning, certiﬁcation and grid access

has been built around the existence of large centralised power

plants, including extensive licensing requirements and speciﬁca-

tions for access to the grid. This favours existing large scale

electricity production and represents a signiﬁcant market barrier to

renewables. It also fails to recognise the value of not having to

transport decentralised power generation over long distances.

Distortions in the conventional power market include:

ENERGY POLICY ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

International Action on Climate
Change

Final ratiﬁcation of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations

Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in

February 2005 was a vital ﬁrst step towards protecting the

climate from dangerous anthropogenic climate change. As a

legally binding international instrument, the Protocol heralds

the beginning of carbon constrained economies. In time, this

will mean an increased demand for low and carbon-free

power production. Protecting the climate will demand more

and deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, which will

further increase the market for renewable energy technolo-

gies such as wind power.

The international issue now is what objectives for reduction

Emissions trading should not be seen as a substitute for

environmental taxes or policies to support renewable energy.

Policies to address these issues must include:

•   A deﬁned and increasing percentage of overall energy

sector lending directed to renewable energy projects.

•   A rapid phase out of support for conventional, polluting

energy projects.

Action by International Bodies

Against the backdrop of ever rising oil prices, political leaders

have slowly started to acknowledge that the global energy

challenge requires urgent action in three areas: securing

global energy supply, meeting rising energy demand and

tackling the threat of climate change. These issues are now

higher on the political agenda than ever before. Moreover, a

better understanding of energy issues and dramatic advances

in modern technologies provide the opportunity for tackling

the energy challenge in an efﬁcient and sustainable way.

Reform of International Financing

Demand for energy, particularly electricity, is increasing

An opportunity for action is provided by international

Policy Summary

NATIONAL POLICIES

1.  Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy

2.  Create legally based market deployment instruments

3.  Provide deﬁned and stable returns for investors by ensuring

that

•   The price for renewable power should allow for risk return

proﬁles that are competitive with other investment options

•   The duration of a project should allow investors to recoup

their investment

4. Reform electricity markets by ensuring that

•   Electricity sector barriers to renewables are removed

•   Market distortions are removed
