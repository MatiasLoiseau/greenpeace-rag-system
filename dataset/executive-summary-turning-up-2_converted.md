Turning Up the Heat: Executive Summary

“ Intact forests give trees,
plants, and animals the
best chances of surviving
in a changing climate.”

Key findings:

	 Warming conditions are causing more droughts,
forest fires, and insect outbreaks in parts of the
Boreal Forest, and are reducing the growth and
survival of some Boreal trees.

	 The area of North American Boreal burned
by forest fires doubled between 1970 and
1990. When forest fires become larger, more
frequent, and more intense, correspondingly
larger amounts of carbon dioxide are released
into the atmosphere.

	 Intact areas of the Boreal Forest resist and
recover from fires, insect outbreaks, and other
impacts better than fragmented areas. These
areas also give trees, plants, and wildlife the best
chances of migrating, adapting, and ultimately
surviving in a changing climate.

	 Logging removes roughly 36 million tonnes
of aboveground carbon from Canada’s
Boreal Forest each year—more carbon than
is emitted each year by all the passenger
vehicles in Canada combined.

	 Logged areas continue to emit carbon
dioxide long after the trees are gone—often
for 10 years or more.

	 Logging accelerates permafrost melt.
When permafrost melts, carbon dioxide and
methane—a greenhouse gas 21 times more
potent than carbon dioxide—are released into
the atmosphere. Intact forest cover may delay
this melt for decades or even centuries.

	 Logging reduces the diversity of a forest, making
it more vulnerable to forest fires, insect outbreaks,
and other disturbances, and therefore increasing
the likelihood and extent of future emissions.

	 If current trends continue, a widespread outbreak
of forest or peat fires in the Boreal could cause
a rapid release of carbon into the atmosphere.
Because Canada’s Boreal Forest contains 186
billion tonnes of carbon—27 times the world’s
annual fossil fuel emissions—this could cause a
disastrous spike in emissions.

	 Preserving what remains of the biologically
rich southern areas of the Boreal Forest is
essential to protecting the viability of its vast
northern expanses.

Forests play an essential role in regulating the global climate. They
sequester and store carbon, they conserve biodiversity, and they
stabilize local climates. But the world’s last great forests—the
Amazon, the Congo, the Boreal, the Paradise forests of Asia-
Pacific—are all actively threatened by logging and other industrial
activity. While due attention is starting to focus on tropical forests,
the role of northern forests in mitigating global warming continues
to be underestimated.

Based in part on a comprehensive review of scientific literature
by researchers at the University of Toronto 1, Turning Up the Heat
explores the complex relationship between global warming and
Canada’s Boreal Forest. It finds that the intact areas of Canada’s
Boreal Forest are not only helping to slow global warming by storing
massive amounts of carbon and slowing permafrost melt, but
they’re also helping the forest itself to resist and recover from global
warming impacts.

When the Boreal Forest is degraded through logging and industrial
development, not only are massive amounts of greenhouse
gases released into the atmosphere, but the forest becomes
increasingly vulnerable to global warming impacts like fires and
insect outbreaks—in many cases, impacts that themselves cause
more greenhouse gases to be released, creating a vicious circle
wherein global warming degrades the Boreal Forest and Boreal
Forest degradation contributes to global warming. If left unchecked,
this could culminate in a catastrophic release of greenhouse gasses
known as “the carbon bomb”.

The report also finds that logging reduces the stability that animals,
birds, and plants need in order to adapt to changing climate
conditions, and eliminates the corridors they need in order to
migrate. In short, when the Boreal Forest is degraded by logging,
both the climate and the forest face dramatic consequences.

Global warming is already having an
impact on Canada’s Boreal Forest

With global warming causing warmer, drier conditions in parts of
the Boreal Forest, droughts, forest fires, and insect infestations are
all on the rise. Drought stress has already increased, particularly in
western Canada 2, 3, and tree growth and carbon absorption have
begun to suffer as a result. Even more alarming, these warm, dry
conditions are creating a tinderbox, laying the groundwork for bigger,
hotter fires. While fires are a natural part of the Boreal ecosystem,
they’re becoming longer, more frequent, and more intense as time
goes on 4, 5, 6—and the more intense forest fires get, the more carbon
they release into the atmosphere 7. According to one study, the area
of North American Boreal Forest burned by forest fires doubled
between 1970 and 1990 8.

Warmer temperatures are also leading to destructive insect
outbreaks like the mountain pine beetle outbreak ravaging western
Canada. Already, the area of Boreal Forest lost to insects is up
to eight times greater than the area burned by forest fires 9, and
the damage caused by the mountain pine beetle and the other
major defoliating insects in the Boreal is projected to increase as
temperatures continue to rise 10, 11. Lastly, while early predictions
suggested that warmer temperatures would enhance tree growth,
recent research shows that higher temperatures are actually
reducing the growth and survival of some Boreal trees 12, 13.

Global warming is predicted to cause additional problems in the Boreal
as well. As temperatures rise, wildlife, trees, and plants are expected
to migrate northward to cooler regions. Unfortunately, the migrations of
different plant and animal species are unlikely to happen at the same
rates, and as a result interdependent relationships like that between
an animal and the plants it eats, or between a predator and its prey,
could be disrupted 14. These disruptions, combined with the fire- and
insect-related disturbances described above, could lead to die-offs in
species already at risk, including the woodland caribou, the wolverine,
and the American marten.

“ Warm, dry conditions
are creating a tinderbox,
laying the groundwork
for bigger, hotter fires.”

Large intact areas of the Boreal Forest
better resist and recover from global
warming impacts

Research shows that intact areas of the Boreal Forest—those areas
that remain in their natural states—will be better able to resist and
recover from global warming impacts than those areas fragmented
by roads, logging, mining, or other human activity.

By maintaining stable local climates, intact forests shield the trees,
plants, and animals within them from the rapid and sometimes erratic
changes happening in the broader climate, giving them more time to
migrate and adapt 15. And, with more mature trees and higher levels
of biodiversity than areas that have been logged, intact forest areas
are better able to resist and recover from global warming impacts
such as fires and insect outbreaks. Lastly, intact forests provide the
contiguous corridors that trees, plants, and animals need in order to
successfully migrate north 16.

While the more southern areas of the Boreal Forest have already been
severely fragmented by logging and development, research shows
that protecting what remains of these biologically rich areas is essential
for facilitating the adaptation and migration that will allow the vast intact
areas of the northern Boreal to survive in a changing climate 17, 18.

Turning Up the Heat: Executive Summary

Intact areas of the Boreal Forest are
helping to mitigate global warming

Logging is destabilizing the Boreal Forest
and contributing to global warming

The Boreal plays a vital role in curbing global warming by absorbing
carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it in the forest’s
trees and soils. Canada’s Boreal Forest stores an estimated 186 billion
tonnes of carbon19, an amount equal to 27 years’ worth of carbon
emissions from the burning of fossil fuels worldwide 20. Eighty-four
per cent of this is stored in the forest’s soils.

Intact areas of Canada’s Boreal Forest are also helping to mitigate
global warming by slowing the melt of Canada’s expansive areas
of permafrost (soil that remains frozen throughout the year). When
permafrost melts, large quantities of carbon dioxide and methane—a
greenhouse gas 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide—are
released into the atmosphere 21, 22. Given the rapid warming
happening across the Boreal, widespread permafrost melt is likely—
increases in air temperature of only 1–2 degrees Celsius have the
potential to thaw out large expanses of discontinuous permafrost 23.
But research shows that intact forest cover may delay thawing by
decades or even centuries 24, 25, 26.

With nearly 900,000 hectares (2.2 million acres) cut every year 27, logging
in Canada’s Boreal Forest is exacting a considerable toll on the climate.
An estimated 36 million tonnes of aboveground carbon is directly removed
from the Boreal every year by logging alone—more carbon than is emitted
each year by all the passenger vehicles in Canada combined 28. And this
number doesn’t account for the additional carbon lost from the forest’s
soils, or for the 68,000 hectares (168,028 acres) deforested each year
through the construction of logging roads and landings 29, 30.

Further, research shows that forests continue to emit carbon long after they’ve
been logged—often for 10 years or more—as the amount of carbon emitted
through decomposition and decay outstrips the amount of carbon absorbed
by young, growing trees 31, 32.

Logging also contributes to carbon dioxide and methane emissions
by accelerating permafrost melt, and increases the likelihood of future
emissions by reducing the forest’s ability to resist and recover from forest
fires and other disturbances. And by eliminating the intact corridors that
animals, trees, and plants need in order to migrate and adapt, logging in
the intact areas of the forest reduces the ability of the ecosystem as a
whole to function and thrive.

Government and industry arguments
are misleading

Recently, government regulators and the Canadian forest
products industry have been denying that logging in the Boreal
Forest contributes to global warming, primarily by arguing that
when forests are logged, the carbon within them is stored for
long periods of time in forest products 33, 34, 35. This argument
does not live up to scientific scrutiny.

Not only is it based on a number of false assumptions (for example,
that most or all of the trees logged end up in long-lasting products
like dimensional lumber), but it paints a simplistic picture of logging
that fails to account for important factors such as the carbon lost
from soils during logging, the carbon emitted for years after logging
ends, the areas permanently deforested through the building of
roads and landings, and the carbon dioxide and methane emitted
as permafrost melts and as products decompose in landfills.
This argument also fails to account for the many consequences
of fragmentation on the health of the forest as a whole, including
increased vulnerability to global warming impacts, and reduced
ability of animals and trees to migrate, adapt, and survive under
warming conditions.

Soil organic carbon in Canada’s Boreal Forest

The carbon bomb

Forest fires, insect outbreaks, permafrost melting, and logging in
Canada’s Boreal Forest have the potential to worsen global warming,
while industrial development has the potential to weaken the Boreal’s
resistance and resilience in the face of global warming’s intensifying
impacts. If left unchecked, these problems could culminate in
a scenario known as “the carbon bomb”: a massive release of
greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, driven, for example, by
a widespread outbreak of forest or peat fires. Because Canada’s
Boreal Forest contains 186 billion tonnes of carbon, a rapid release
of its carbon into the atmosphere could cause a disastrous spike
in global emissions, comparable to the 1997 peat fires in Indonesia
that accounted for an estimated 13–40 per cent of global carbon
emissions from fossil fuels in that year 36.

“Because Canada’s Boreal Forest
contains 186 billion tonnes of carbon,
a rapid release of its carbon into the
atmosphere could cause a disastrous
spike in global emissions.”

Turning Up the Heat: Executive Summary

Solutions

Nothing less than comprehensive, global solutions is sufficient in
the face of global warming. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions
from fossil fuels and stopping tropical deforestation have both
been recognized internationally as essential measures. In addition,
the remaining intact areas of Canada’s Boreal Forest must be
protected—both to help avert catastrophic global warming, and to
protect the Boreal Forest from global warming’s intensifying impacts.

Currently, only 8.1 per cent of the large intact areas of Canada’s
Boreal Forest are protected from industrial development 37.
Meanwhile, 45 per cent, or 154 million hectares (382 million acres),
of the treed area of the Boreal is under license to logging
companies, mainly in the biologically diverse southern areas of
the Boreal Forest 38.

That’s why Greenpeace is calling for a moratorium on industrial
development in all intact areas of Canada’s Boreal Forest. A
moratorium would make the most important areas of the Boreal
off-limits to logging and other industrial development until an
acceptable, comprehensive, science-based plan for the forest’s
future management and protection is agreed to by First Nations,
communities, governments, environmental organizations, and
industry—a plan that’s sustainable for people, for wildlife, and
for the planet.

“Intact areas of Canada’s

avert catastrophic global
warming, and to protect the
Boreal from global warming’s
intensifying impacts.”
