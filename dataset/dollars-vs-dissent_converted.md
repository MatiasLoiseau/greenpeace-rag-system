EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

As we collectively fight for our lives amid climate
chaos, the fossil fuel industry is behind an intensified
effort to steamroll overwhelming public support
for U.S. climate action. The industry’s new playbook
expands significantly upon years of spreading climate
change denial and disinformation. Indeed it represents
an even more dangerous threat: a threat to First
Amendment-protected free speech, which is urgently
needed to forestall the devastating consequences of
climate inaction.

Since the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protests at
Standing Rock in 2016, the fossil fuel industry has
increasingly contributed to a pattern of escalation
whereby activists—and nonactivists exercising their
right to dissent—are painted as violent extremists
who must be subdued. The industry’s playbook
to suppress protest and dissent includes various
forms of intimidation and deterrence, sophisticated
public relations efforts to turn public opinion against
protesters, and enforcement actions intended to

pressure protesters into submission. In many cases,
the fossil fuel industry has worked in lockstep with
government allies: officials who may share in the
industry’s ideology, but who have also benefited from
its election spending, lobbying, targeted payments,
and shared financial interests, or have passed through
the “revolving door” from industry to government or
vice versa.

This report profiles the industry response to opposition
to five major fossil fuel projects ranging from 2014 to
the present. The examples reveal widespread public-
private coordination to monitor activism, physical and
legal aggression toward protesters, extensive corporate
lobbying for anti-protest bills that criminalize civil
disobedience, and more. But they also reveal a mixed
success record for the industry: some states have staved
off anti-protest legislation and, across the country,
activists and concerned citizens have continued to fight
for justice and environmental protection despite the
powerful forces opposing them.

INTRODUCTIONKEY FINDINGS

The fossil fuel industry holds close relationships with government officials and law
enforcement. Collectively, they have succeeded in many efforts that shrink civic space
and heighten the consequences for engaging in peaceful protest.

	| Since 2016, broad fossil fuel anti-protest laws have
been enacted in 18 states, barricading roughly
60% of domestic oil & gas production and local
infrastructure from peaceful protest that could
impede the industry’s continued growth. These laws
typically create extreme and unnecessary penalties—
which can include years-long imprisonment and harsh
fines—for protest-related infractions such as trespass,
despite the pre-existence of laws in every state that
address such infractions. Another four states have
enacted narrowed versions of the same law posing
less explicit threats to peaceful protest, but which
could still be exploited by prosecutors seeking to issue
trumped up charges against peaceful protesters.

	| The close-knit relationship between fossil fuel
companies and law enforcement can involve
extensive intelligence sharing, often without regard
for First Amendment-protected activity; joint
planning; hiring off-duty police for private security;
and financial support in the form of donations and
reimbursements paid by the company. The nature
of these relationships opens the door to potential
abuses of law enforcement authority and raises
the possibility that law enforcement are serving
private interests above the public.

	+ The fusion center network, in particular—a web
of state and federal agencies that was created
to coordinate counter-terrorism intelligence,
but quickly expanded to monitoring First
Amendment-protected activity of nearly
any kind—has facilitated surveillance and
information-sharing with fossil fuel companies
and their security contractors.

	| Law enforcement authorities, sometimes working
side-by-side with private security paid for by fossil
fuel companies, have used hostile tactics to quell
pipeline protests including:

	+ Water cannons and rubber bullets against water
protectors resisting the construction of DAPL
(Morton County Sheriff’s Office);

	+ Buffer zones that prevented food from being
delivered to protesters engaged in tree-sits
along the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) route
(U.S. Forest Service);

	+ Pain compliance torture against water protectors
engaged in equipment lockdowns blocking Line
3 construction (Hubbard County Sheriff’s Office).

	| The fossil fuel industry has utilized public
relations techniques and faux grassroots
groups to turn public opinion against water
protectors and activists, often depicting them
as violent extremists, terrorists, or out-of-line
troublemakers. Law enforcement authorities have
used similar rhetoric in public statements and
internal communications, providing cover for their
hostility toward protesters.

	| Eminent domain laws strongly favor the fossil

fuel industry and have been used to force
landowners to surrender their property rights,
cede property access without consent, and arrest
protesters on private land—in some cases
including the landowners themselves.

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY 20 23  |  5

The fossil fuel industry has lobbied
extensively for anti-protest legislation
and donated to many of its sponsors.

	| Since 2017, nine of the top ten companies that have
lobbied the most for fossil fuel anti-protest bills are
midstream or integrated oil and gas companies.

1. Marathon Petroleum Corp
2. ExxonMobil
3. Enbridge
4. TC Energy (TransCanada)
5. Koch Industries / Flint Hills
6. Chevron
7. Energy Transfer
8. Williams Companies
9. AT&T
10. Valero

	| 25 fossil fuel and energy companies have contrib-

uted more than $5 million to state anti-protest bill
sponsors since 2017. The top five are listed below,
counting donations to anti-protest bill sponsors in the
bill introduction year or preceding year, only.

1. Duke Energy
2. Dominion Energy
3. Marathon Petroleum
4. BNSF Railway Co.
5. Koch Industries
This analysis covers all state anti-protest bills tracked by the International Center
for Not-for-profit Law (ICNL). In addition to fossil fuel anti-protest bills, this analysis
includes bills that eliminate driver liability for hitting protesters, create felony offenses
for demonstrations construed as “riots” and more.

The fossil fuel industry uses strategic
lawsuits against public participation
(SLAPPs) to intimidate and chill dissent.
There is a high crossover of fossil fuel
companies that have used SLAPPs with
those that have lobbied for anti-protest laws.

	| Out of 116 SLAPP and judicial harassment claims
since 2010, 86 were filed by companies that have
lobbied for anti-protest laws including: ExxonMobil,
Murray Energy Corporation, Energy Transfer, Chevron,
and TransCanada.

	| Another 15 of the 116 claims were filed by

companies whose trade groups have lobbied for
anti-protest laws or whose hired lobbyists have
done so on behalf of other clients.

2023 has been marked by the broadening use
of aggressive prosecutorial and civil litigation
claims against protesters, violent policing
against “Stop Cop City” protesters in Georgia,
and the continuing spread of anti-protest laws.

	| Atlanta law enforcement and the Georgia Bureau

of Investigation have responded to protests
opposing the construction of the Atlanta Public
Safety Training Center with heavy-handed tactics
and sweeping arrests. During a January 2023 raid of
campgrounds occupied by activists, police fatally shot
Manuel Esteban Paez Terán 57 times. In September
2023, state Attorney General Chris Carr indicted
more than 60 individuals—including organizers from
the Atlanta Solidarity Fund—on RICO charges that
dangerously, and absurdly, mischaracterize anyone
who showed opposition to Cop City as part of a
criminal enterprise.

	| In September 2023, MVP took direct aim at its critics

through a civil lawsuit that seeks to constrain
more than 41 individuals and two organizations
from activities that are alleged to have slowed
construction, including through fundraising, as well
as seeking more than $4 million in damages.

	| North Carolina and Georgia have enacted fossil
fuel anti-protest laws that carry draconian
penalties for vague offenses that prosecutors
could use against peaceful protesters. In North
Carolina, impeding an energy facility could now be
punished with up to 19 years in prison and $250,000
in fines. Another new law, which was initially sought
by North Carolina Republicans after the 2020 Black
Lives Matter protests, enacts heightened penalties for
activities defined as “rioting.” In Georgia, interfering
by “force [...] with the proper operation of any critical
infrastructure” could now be punished with between
two and 20 years in prison.

	| Mississippi has enacted new laws that undermine
local governance and threaten free speech in
the majority-Black city of Jackson, after decades
of neglected infrastructure left thousands without
water for a month. One of the laws prohibits Jackson
residents from engaging in peaceful protests near
government buildings without express permission
from state officials.

KEY FINDINGSThe following policies are necessary to
reverse the deterioration of civic space and
advance the movement for a healthy, socially
just, and fossil-free future.

	| Challenge and repeal anti-protest laws; pass
anti-SLAPP protection laws on the state and
federal level; and pass local, state, and federal
resolutions affirming all Americans’ right to
protest, free from threats of invasive surveillance,
and physical and legal aggression.

	| Reaffirm Indigenous sovereignty and

provide redress for human rights violations,
as outlined in the UN Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples.

Case Studies at a Glance

Dakota Access Pipeline
In 2016, demonstrations against DAPL at Standing Rock
brought conversations about Indigenous sovereignty,
water rights, and the dangers of oil and gas pipelines
to kitchen tables across the globe. As public awareness
about the #NoDAPL movement grew, so too did the
fossil fuel industry opposition strategy. Energy Transfer
Partners (ETP), the controlling owner of DAPL, began
pumping money into private security that forged a
close working relationship with North Dakota local law
enforcement—uniting forces to quell public dissent with
militarized equipment and tactics. State and federal
law enforcement also contributed to this oppressive
response. At the same time, ETP and their political allies
ramped up retaliatory efforts to prevent the contagious
power of the Standing Rock demonstrations from
spreading, including pushing for boosted penalties to
criminalize protest, flooding the media with anti-protest
rhetoric, and filing baseless SLAPP suits to chill dissent.

	| Pass the Climate Equity Act and the

Environmental Justice for All Act, and phase
out fossil fuel production through steps that
include: banning new fossil fuel leasing and
permitting on public lands and waters; strengthening
“polluter pays” requirements to ensure fossil fuel
corporations pay the full cost of remediation; and
establishing public health and safety buffer zones to
prohibit oil and gas production near where people
live, work, play, and learn.

	| End the use of sweeping intelligence-gathering
practices that target activism and dissent under
the cover of domestic terrorism prevention;
prohibit law enforcement authorities from
participating in arrangements that open the door
to conflicts of interest; and pass state and federal
laws banning the use of injury-prone tactics against
peaceful protesters.

Diamond Pipeline
The Diamond Pipeline, announced in 2014, was a
440-mile project that would carry crude oil from
Oklahoma’s Cushing Terminal to Valero’s Memphis
Refinery. Resistance to the pipeline swelled in early
2017, inspired by the movement at Standing Rock. As
well as expressing environmental concerns, Indigenous
activists and their allies were deeply disturbed that
the pipeline route would intersect the Trail of Tears.
The fossil fuel industry and government officials struck
back against the movement, however, with stigmatizing
rhetoric, which opened the door for increasingly harsh
state repression. A state and federal law enforcement-
backed report, which was distributed to local police and
reproduced by the media, warned that “environmental
rights extremists” posed a terrorist threat to the project.
At the urging of Oklahoma’s oil and gas lobby and
Valero, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin enacted two anti-
protest laws with first-of-their-kind, strategic provisions
targeting protests near fossil fuel facilities, foretelling
a drop-off in opposition to the Diamond Pipeline
project. These laws were the blueprint for a “model bill”
adopted by the corporate-funded American Legislative
Exchange Council, which would aid the spread of similar
laws around the country.

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY 20 23  |  7

KEY FINDINGSAtlantic Coast Pipeline and
Mountain Valley Pipeline
The fossil fuel industry had only mixed success
at quashing years-long grassroots opposition to
the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP) and MVP. The
Appalachian fracked gas pipeline projects, both
announced in 2014, were repeatedly stalled by
eminent domain disputes, successful legal challenges,
and protests. Dominion and EQT Corporation, the
pipelines’ controlling owners, coordinated extensively
with fusion center officials in Virginia and North
Carolina, and worked side-by-side with local law
enforcement along the pipeline route. Starting in
2018, Virginia and West Virginia used escalating
fines, arrests, and subjective buffer zones to deter
civil disobedience, but many protesters adapted
or endured in the face of these pressures. ACP was
canceled in 2020, but MVP construction resumed
in July 2023 nearly four years after a court-ordered
construction stoppage. Since 2020, anti-protest
laws have been enacted in West Virginia and North
Carolina, and MVP protesters have been sued by
the company, and threats to protest and dissent
have been compounded by an anti-environmental
backlash stoked by the fossil fuel industry.

Line 3 Pipeline
In 2014, Enbridge proposed replacing and expanding its
Line 3 crude oil pipeline, a project that would require
constructing a new pipeline route across treaty territories
where the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) peoples are granted
certain land access rights. Between 2017 and 2021, a
large and diversified movement opposing the pipeline
grew out of Indigenous resistance and climate activism.
In an effort to avoid the political mistakes made at
Standing Rock, the state and Enbridge claimed they
respected protesters’ rights. Yet they quietly took steps
to stifle resistance. Enbridge funded faux grassroots
groups to shift public opinion and reimbursed police and
other agencies in Minnesota for more than $8.6 million,
mainly in protest-related expenses, through a state-
managed escrow account. Law enforcement authorities
participated in training sessions and meetings with
Enbridge employees, and used increasingly forceful
tactics against water protectors between June and August
2021. Pipeline construction was completed in September
2021, but repeated efforts to pass anti-protest legislation
failed. In 2023, in a powerful defense of protest, a district
court judge dismissed all protest-related charges against
three Indigenous women leaders, writing in her decision,
“to criminalize their behavior would be the crime.”

KEY FINDINGSINTRODUCTION

Dollars vs. Democracy 2023 is a deep-dive into the fossil fuel industry’s attacks on peaceful
protest and dissent. In addition to updating key analyses from Dollars vs. Democracy 2021, this
report profiles the industry’s response to opposition to five major fossil fuel projects ranging
from 2014 to the present. These case studies reveal how fossil fuel companies are using protest
and dissent-stifling tactics to fight all efforts to phase out fossil fuels, in pursuit of record profits,
while global temperatures rise.

The right to protest is constitutionally protected
and has been a hallmark of our democracy since
the founding of this nation. Yet, free speech in all its
forms has been increasingly at risk as a result of the
backlash against social movements organizing for
justice and environmental protection. Indigenous-led
movements to defend land and water from polluting
infrastructure and the Black Lives Matter movement, in
particular, have been targeted by polluting corporations,
special interests, and government officials. And the

extreme measures they are willing to take to see
activists defeated are well documented. The corporate
and political powers threatening democracy are now
drawing from an expansive set of tactics to stifle protest
and dissent, including various forms of intimidation
and deterrence, sophisticated public relations efforts
to turn public opinion against demonstrators, civil suits
for monetary damages, and law enforcement actions
intended to pressure demonstrators into submission.

Anti-Protest Legislation Since 2017

Anti-protest legislation has been a primary and
particularly dangerous tactic. According to the
International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL), more
than 250 anti-protest bills have been introduced in 45
states since 2017.1 Among them: bills that eliminate
driver liability for hitting protesters, create felony
offenses for demonstrations construed as “riots,” and
more. These bills are designed to selectively repress
political participation, especially from racial justice and
environmental movements. They are formulated in such
a way that they can restrict protected First Amendment
speech, including but not limited to peaceful protest.

The fossil fuel industry has played a key role in the
creation and spread of fossil fuel anti-protest laws with
provisions specifically intended to stifle protest near
fossil fuel facilities. (The industry calls these “critical
infrastructure” laws—a term that diverts attention from
the use of these laws in stifling protest that opposes
fossil fuel expansion.) Among other provisions, these

laws typically create draconian penalties for protest-
motivated trespass, despite the pre-existence of
laws in every state that address trespass regardless
of motive. The industry’s push for anti-protest laws
has involved direct lobbying, trade group lobbying,
and using the American Legislative Exchange Council
(ALEC), a powerful corporate-funded group with direct
access to state legislators, to craft and promote “model
legislation” that can be replicated and introduced in
statehouses across the country. Since the Dakota Access
Pipeline (DAPL) protests at Standing Rock in 2016,
broad fossil fuel anti-protest laws have been enacted
in 18 states, barricading roughly 60% of domestic oil &
gas production and local infrastructure from peaceful
protest that could impede the industry’s continued
growth.2 Another four states have enacted narrowed
versions of the same law posing less explicit threats
to peaceful protest, but which could still be exploited
by prosecutors seeking to issue trumped up charges
against peaceful protesters.3

INTRODUCTIONThe Fossil Fuel Industry’s Direct Assault on Democracy

Over the course of years, the fossil fuel industry
has systematically expanded its arsenal aimed at
suppressing protest and dissent. One key tactic: abusive
civil suits called “strategic lawsuits against public
participation” - better known as “SLAPPs.” The industry
also employs hostile policing and security, stigmatizes
protest, manufactures anti-environmental backlash,
exploits divisive rhetoric, and more. Such tactics
are cumulative, mutually reinforcing, and at times
overlapping.

It is critical to note that none of these corporate
attacks on democracy would be possible without
allies in government: public officials who often share
in the fossil fuel industry’s ideology, but who have
also benefited from its election spending, lobbying,
targeted payments, and shared financial interests,
or have passed through the “revolving door” from
industry to government or vice versa. The fossil
fuel industry holds close—and deeply reciprocal—
relationships with government officials empowered
to pass laws restricting opponents’ rights and vested
with authority to approve or reject new fossil fuel

projects. This has been especially dangerous in
states with Republican-controlled legislatures,
which account for 21 of the 22 states that have
passed fossil fuel anti-protest laws.9 Yet, the industry
also has substantial power in Democratic-controlled
states. Moreover, the industry has collaborated
extensively with law enforcement entities in the
countrywide “fusion center” network, a cross-
jurisdictional government program supported by
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that
was originally developed to coordinate and share
intelligence related to terrorism, but quickly
expanded to monitoring First Amendment-protected
activity of nearly any kind.10 The fusion center network
has been widely condemned by organizations including
the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the
Brennan Center for targeting minority communities
and protest movements, and for its poor oversight
and collaboration with the military and the private
sector.11 Reports by fusion centers sometimes all
but erase the distinction between peaceful civil
disobedience and violent extremism.

A Desperate Attempt to Keep Polluting

As climate action movements grow and scientists
issue calls to halve carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
by 2030, the fossil fuel industry has sought to expand
oil and gas production.12 According to the Guardian,
short-term industry plans include “oil and gas projects
that will produce greenhouse gasses equivalent to a
decade of CO2 emissions from China, the world’s biggest
polluter.”13 These plans include 195 projects that would
result in at least a billion tons of CO2 emissions over their
estimated lifetimes—and 60% of these carbon bombs
are already pumping. The top 12 biggest oil companies
are expected to spend $103 million per day to exploit
new oil and gas through the rest of the decade.14

While these fossil fuel projects exacerbate the climate
crisis globally, they also pointedly threaten Black,
Brown, and Indigenous communities.15 The fossil fuel
economy is dependent on sites of concentrated harm,
or “sacrifice zones,” whose inhabitants are subject to
elevated health risks.16 Fossil fuel transport routes are
frequently mapped along Indigenous communities and

tribal lands, endangering water supplies, and sacred
sites. Beyond environmental concerns, oil projects often
entail the influx of hundreds of workers forming “man
camps” near Indigenous communities, which have led
to increased incidents of violence, sex trafficking, and
illicit drug trade.17

Throughout history, communities impacted by
corporate assaults on their environment, health,
and wellbeing have fought back through public
demonstrations, civil disobedience, and peaceful
protest. The right to protest and dissent has been
instrumental to climate and environmental justice
victories such as restricting the use of toxic pesticides
that disproportionately harm farmworkers, defeating
dangerous and climate-damaging pipelines such as
Keystone XL, and countless others.18 In continuing
the fight for climate and environmental justice, it is
more important than ever to understand the fossil fuel
industry’s retaliatory playbook.

INTRODUCTIONDAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE

In 2016, demonstrations against DAPL at Standing Rock
brought conversations about the dangers of oil and
gas pipelines, Indigenous sovereignty, and water rights
to kitchen tables across the globe. The scope of the
Standing Rock resistance was monumental. In the words
of Ruth Hopkins, a reporter from Indian Country Today,
“it’s historic, really. I don’t think anything like this has
ever happened in documented history.”20 During the
course of the protests, hundreds of tribes came together
to stand with the Standing Rock Sioux, and the road into
Sacred Stone Camp at Standing Rock was lined with
flags from tribal nations across the globe.21 Thousands
of Indigenous water protectors and invited movement
allies came through the camp, municipalities across the
country passed resolutions of support, and 1.3 million
people “checked in” at Standing Rock on social media in
a digital demonstration of solidarity.22

This wave of public attention triggered a multi-
pronged opposition strategy aimed at undermining
the Standing Rock movement and its broader support.
Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the operator of DAPL,
and its private security forces carried out an extensive

side-by-side with state police, the Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI), the DHS, and ETP’s private security
force—responded to protesters with brutal force,
soaking them with water in freezing temperatures and
shooting them with rubber bullets at close distance.
ETP and its well-connected allies fueled retaliatory
efforts to prevent #NoDAPL momentum from spreading,
filing lawsuits intended to chill dissent and exploiting
the false specter of violent protest to advocate for
aggressive security preparation and anti-protest laws
across the country.

Texas-based ETP applied for permits
to build DAPL. The pipeline project
was designed to carry crude oil from
the Bakken shale oil field in northwest
North Dakota to an oil storage and
transport facility in Illinois, crossing
North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa.
Initially, the pipeline was mapped
to cross the Missouri River ten miles
north of Bismarck, North Dakota, but
was redirected at least in part due
to its planned proximity to the state
capital’s drinking water. The DAPL
plan draft was amended to put the
river crossing a half mile from the
Standing Rock Sioux reservation.23

aPrIl 1, 2016
Indigenous youth leaders from Oceti Sakowin Youth & Allies, the One
Mind Youth Movement, and Indigenous leaders, including LaDonna
Brave Bull Allard, established a small prayer camp on the north end of
the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, just off the DAPL route. This camp
became the base for a global protest movement against DAPL—over
the next six months, the camp brought together Tribal leaders and
Indigenous youth, farmers, environmentalists, justice organizations, and
other individuals called to defend sacred Sioux land.26

aPrIl 24, 2016
Indigenous youth runners set off on a 500-mile

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe
passed a resolution stating that
“the Dakota Access Pipeline

nation, the tribe declared that
the construction of the pipeline
violated Article II of the 1868
Treaty of Fort Laramie, which
guaranteed the “undisturbed
use and occupation” of the
reservation lands surrounding
the proposed location of the
pipeline.25

around federally regulated waters
without any provision to ensure
against destruction to culturally
important sites.”29

DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINEFossil Fuels and the Political Landscape

North Dakota’s Crude Oil Boom Resulted
In Pervasive Fossil Fuel Influence
By 2014, new shale drilling technology had opened
the floodgates for the Bakken oil field—North Dakota
production surged from about 123,000 barrels per day
in 2007 to more than one million in 2014.37 According
to a report jointly published by the Center for Public
Integrity and Inside Climate News, with the expansion
of fracked oil production came billions of dollars in tax
revenue for the state—$4 billion between July 2011 and
June 2013—solidifying the influence of oil companies in
the state political arena.38 The report also found that oil
companies invested millions in North Dakota museums,
hospitals, and universities, and contributed thousands
of dollars to politicians, making the oil sector the largest
single source of political contributions in North Dakota.
According to Jim Fuglie, a former state tourism director
and head of the state Democratic-Nonpartisan League
Party, “what the industry did was they went and bought
themselves a friend.”39

Fossil Fuel Spending Paved the Way
For Political Support of DAPL
With production expanding, fossil fuel interests in
North Dakota’s Bakken region stood to benefit if
they could move oil more quickly and efficiently to
the Gulf Coast for refining and export.40 Just days
before the pipeline was announced in 2014, North
Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple “urged industry and
government officials to build more pipelines to
keep pace with the state’s oil production.”41

Both North Dakota and Iowa state politics were
awash in fossil fuel money when DAPL secured
its permit approvals from both states in 2015
and 2016. Oil and gas interests donated about
$380,000 to Dalrymple’s 2012 campaign, and
were his top corporate supporters.42 To bring
the fossil fuel relationship full circle, Dalrymple
headed the three-member, all-Republican North
Dakota Industrial Commission, which oversaw
drilling and pipelines during the construction
of the DAPL project.43

In Iowa, the members of the Iowa Utility Board—
a key oversight panel for pipelines—are appointed
by the governor. Between 2010 and 2016, over
$1 million out of $18 million total contributions
to Iowa Governor Terry Branstad were from
energy and natural resources donors—and the
Branstad-appointed Iowa Utility Board approved
DAPL’s permit in March 2016.44 After Branstad
resigned to join the Trump administration as the
United States Ambassador to China in 2017, ETP
contributed over $20,000 to his successor, Governor
Kim Reynolds.45

DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINEtactIc #1. Sanctioning Hostile Security and Policing

As the resistance at Standing Rock grew, the industry’s
tactics became more militaristic—in part due to their
hiring of the private security firm TigerSwan. Reporting
by the Intercept described the group as “a shadowy
international mercenary and security firm” which
“targeted the movement opposed to the Dakota Access
Pipeline with military-style counterterrorism measures,
collaborating closely with police in at least five states.”47
TigerSwan was founded by James Reese, a former U.S.
Army special operations commander. He entered into
the private security and intelligence industry as a U.S.
military and State Department contractor helping fight
the “war on terror” in Iraq and Afghanistan. After the
completion of DAPL, Reese established a three-man oil
company called Delta Crescent Energy, that would insert
itself into Syria amid the chaos of the Syrian Civil War.48

Hundreds of leaked internal TigerSwan documents
obtained by the Intercept show that the company
described water protectors with much the same
language that they used to describe “jihadist” fighters

and insurgents.49 A February 2017 report attributed to
TigerSwan’s Chief Security Officer John Porter expressed
concern that pipeline opposition would spread to other
states through a post-insurgency “bleedout” model, citing
the rise of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda as an example.50
Consequently, the report concluded that “we are able to
study protesters’ successes and failures and so improve our
preparedness” and “aggressive intelligence preparation
of the battlefield and active coordination between
intelligence and security elements are now a proven
method of defeating pipeline insurgencies.” For months,
TigerSwan expanded surveillance tactics to monitor
protestors, despite being denied a license to operate by the
North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board.51

TigerSwan communicated with agents from the FBI, the
DHS, the U.S. Justice Department, the U.S. Marshals Ser-
vice, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and state and local law
enforcement to share intelligence. During the demonstra-
tions at Standing Rock, TigerSwan provided law enforce-
ment support with “helicopter flights, medics, and security

Standing unarmed in cold water, water protectors were forcibly repelled by law enforcement officials with tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets, November

enforcement officials pulled the bridge apart with boats.

chase (by ETP) of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
of radios for police”52. The company also ordered a catalog
of less-lethal weapons, such as tear gas, for police use.53

Leaked TigerSwan documents show evidence of
extensive surveillance that included radio eavesdropping,
infiltration of camps and activist groups, and the
creation of a “persons of interest” list and databases with
identifying information such as photographs and license
plate numbers.54 Public records reveal that TigerSwan
planned for the bidirectional exchange of purported
evidence of illegal activity with law enforcement.55 Both
TigerSwan and the FBI used paid informants who spent
months posing as pipeline opponents.56 The FBI’s now
known informant, Heath Harmon, owned a gun and
entered into a romantic relationship with the Oglala Sioux
water protector Red Fawn Fallis. Fallis was later arrested
and sentenced to years in prison for an incident where
the gun was allegedly fired while in her possession.57

Local law enforcement used violent tactics against
demonstrators. More than 300 water protectors were
injured during a November 2016 stand-off, prompting
the Water Protector Legal Collective to file a class action
lawsuit against the Morton County Sheriff’s Office and
other law enforcement agencies for excessive force.58
One of the class action representatives, Vanessa Dun-
don, was hit in the eye by a tear gas canister from a
distance of around 20 feet; the resulting injury, a de-
tached retina, required three surgeries, and Dundon’s
vision had not fully healed as of August 2020.59 Another
one of the representatives, Israel Hoagland-Lynn, lost
consciousness after being shot in the back of the head

with an impact munition. The resulting injury left him
hospitalized and required 17 head staples.60

The Indigenous Environmental Network summarized
the impact of excessive force on water protectors in their
report, Indigenous Resistance Against Carbon:

“Local authorities arbitrarily arrested and

harassed water protectors, and both local and

TigerSwan forces used aggressive attack dogs

and other forms of physical violence, including

water cannons in freezing conditions. Despite

later vindication by courts, thousands of

victims of these abuses — the vast majority

of whom were Indigenous — remain scarred
by these clubs and beatings…Hundreds were

left with arrests on their records and files

at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and

Department of Homeland Security, with

gratuitous charges, including trespassing,

despite being arrested on public roads. The

brutality of the private security forces played a
major role in provoking public outrage.”61

Of nearly 15,000 water protectors and supporters
present at the Standing Rock protests, 837 people
faced criminal charges in North Dakota. 393 of the
cases were dismissed, 336 resolved by guilty plea or
pretrial diversion, 42 ended in acquittal, and 26 in
convictions at trial.62

tactIc #2. Framing Water Protectors and Activists as an
Extremist Threat

In a peer-reviewed study examining the fossil
fuel industry’s push to target climate protesters,
researcher Grace Nosek wrote that the “threat
against lawful protest is most greatly felt where
those who disagree with climate protesters have
led a rhetorical push to label such protesters as
terrorists and extremists”.63 According to Nosek, this
extreme rhetorical framing contributes to militarized

responses to protesters and helps advance legislative
proposals targeting them.

During the demonstrations at Standing Rock, North
Dakota law enforcement and officeholders made frequent
claims that the camps harbored violent demonstrators
and terrorists. They spread false information about tactics
and weapons used, and frequently painted the entire

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY 20 23  |  18

DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINEmovement as violent and dangerous.64 After the camps
at Standing Rock saw a surge in public support through
the fall and winter of 2016, some law enforcement talking
points about protesters were prepared by public relations
firms with links to the Republican Party and the National
Sheriffs’ Association.65 Fossil fuel interests developed
a calculated strategy to divert attention away from the
demonstrators’ actual aims and concerns over Indigenous
treaty rights and water/environmental protection, by
framing them as chaotic and violent outsiders.66

One of the earliest and most pervasive examples of
false rhetoric used by North Dakota law enforcement
began with a statement from Morton County Sheriff
Kyle Kirchmeir. Kirchmeir stated on television that
protesters were armed with firearms and “pipe bombs,”
threatening the safety of police officers and DAPL
workers.67 He later recanted this dangerous accusation.
Angela Bibens, a lead attorney for the Oceti Sakowin
camp, told the Los Angeles Times that the “weapons”
Kirchmeir referenced were actually ceremonial pipes—

“this is a profound cultural misinterpretation of what
are chanupas, or peace pipes.”68 The Los Angeles Times
also reported that on at least two occasions, the Morton
County Sheriff’s Department alleged that Standing Rock
demonstrators were carrying bows and arrows, only to
later state that these accusations were not true.

In a January 2017 interview published by the Bismarck
Tribune, Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney smeared
demonstrators as “eco-terrorists” and likened Standing
Rock to “the mecca” where “140 years of perceived
Native American oppression came together”—a
statement that simultaneously ignored a long history of
American oppression and the genocide of Indigenous
Peoples, and painted the Indigenous organizers at
Standing Rock as extremists.69 Following this push to
villainize protestors, North Dakota House Rep. Keith
Kempenich and six co-sponsors introduced a bill to
eliminate driver liability for “unintentionally” hitting
protesters.70 To make the case for the bill, Kempenich
told CNN that the demonstrations at Standing Rock,

DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE“turned from a protest to basically terrorism on the
roadways, and the bill got introduced for people to be
able to drive down the roads without fear of running
into somebody and having to be liable for them.”71 It
appears that Kempenich’s driver liability bill was the
first of its kind.72 Since then, 29 similar bills have been
introduced in 17 states, mainly as a backlash to Black
Lives Matter protests.7374

According to the Intercept, TigerSwan also “attempted
a counter information campaign by creating and
distributing content critical of the protests in social
media.”75 This public relations strategy to shift public
opinion was assisted by Off the Record Strategies,
MarketLeverage, DCI Group and the National Sheriffs’
Association, which helped craft messaging, plant
pro-pipeline articles, and produce content such as
“wanted”-style posters depicting water protectors

as “Professional Protestors with Dangerous Criminal
Histories.”76 Similarly inflammatory rhetorical framing
was used by conservative politicians and think
tanks. For example, Seton Motley, a columnist for the
Heartland Institute, compared DAPL demonstrators and
American hostage-takers in Iran in an article titled “We
Don’t Negotiate With (Eco-) Terrorists”.77

The battle to own the narrative at Standing Rock fueled
attempts at national political intervention. In November
2016, U.S. Senator John Hoeven, U.S. Congressman
Kevin Cramer, and Governor Jack Dalrymple wrote
a letter to then-president Obama requesting federal
law enforcement intervention due to “ongoing — and
oftentimes violent” protest activity threatening public
safety.78 Several months later, Hoeven was elected by his
peers in the Republican-controlled Senate to chair the
Senate Indian Affairs Committee.79

tactIc #3. Boosting Penalties For Protest

By March 2017, North Dakota and South Dakota had
each passed laws restricting the right to peaceful
assembly.80 North Dakota expanded the scope of its
criminal trespass offense, which carries a penalty of
up to 30 days in jail and a $1,500 fine, and created
a non-criminal trespass offense allowing officers to
issue citations with a $250 fine for trespassing.81 North
Dakota also introduced new penalties for protesters
who conceal their identities while committing any
criminal offense (including minor offenses such as
jaywalking), setting the penalties at up to one year
in jail and a $3,000 fine, and increased penalties for
protesters engaged in activities defined as rioting,
setting the penalties at up to ten years in prison and a
$20,000 fine.82 South Dakota expanded the governor’s
authority to restrict protests on public lands and
boosted penalties for protest-related infractions,
setting the terms for criminal trespass and obstructing
traffic at one year in jail, a fine of $2,000, or both.83

The companies responsible for DAPL helped spread
anti-protest laws around the country. In 2017,
Marathon Petroleum pushed for ALEC to adopt its
model fossil fuel anti-protest bill, which boosts
penalties for infractions that include trespassing near,

or impeding, energy infrastructure.84 (The importance of
this model bill, which ALEC formally adopted in
January 2018, is further examined on page 30 of this
report.) From 2018 onward, Marathon Petroleum and
Enbridge each lobbied for similar fossil fuel anti-protest
bills in at least five states and ETP in four.85 To justify
the need for such laws, anti-protest bill sponsors across
the country used fossil fuel industry talking points,
which included resentful and misleading comments
regarding the movement at Standing Rock.

In 2019, North Dakota enacted a fossil fuel anti-protest
law carrying the potential for five years of prison time,
$10,000 in fines, or both, for protests near existing and
planned pipelines.86 The law also increased liability
for organizations that support protesters by treating
such support as a criminal conspiracy, punishable by
a $100,000 fine. South Dakota enacted a fossil fuel
anti-protest law in 2020, carrying the potential for up
to two years in prison and $4,000 in fines for protests
near energy infrastructure. The law also entitled the
owners of energy infrastructure to seek restitution from
individual protesters and their supporters convicted for
related offenses.87

DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINEtactIc #4. Costly Lawsuits to Chill Dissent

Energy Transfer Partners v. Greenpeace
In the summer of 2017, ETP filed a baseless $900 million
RICO lawsuit in North Dakota against Greenpeace,
BankTrack, and the Earth First! movement.88 A
Federal Judge dismissed both BankTrack and Earth
First! from the case, and requested ETP to amend its
complaint against Greenpeace after the original failed
for procedural reasons. When filing this amended
version, the company decided to include five individual
defendants and expand the scope of its claims to other
pipelines like Bayou Bridge.

The suit attempted to rewrite the history of a movement
led by Indigenous Peoples, falsely claiming that
Greenpeace and other environmental groups planned,
funded, and organized the demonstrations opposing
the pipeline at Standing Rock. The allegations included
an implausible RICO claim that these groups and others
formed a “criminal enterprise” to instigate violence and
damage the company.

In 2019, a federal court dismissed ETP’s RICO claims
but declined to retain jurisdiction over the remaining
state law-based claims.89 One week after the federal
case was dismissed, Energy Transfer LP and Energy
Transfer Operating, L.P. filed a new lawsuit in Morton
County, North Dakota state court—including state-based
conspiracy claims—against Greenpeace. This remaining
lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in July 2024.

Strategic Lawsuits Against Public
Participation Threaten Free Speech
SLAPPs are a legal action designed in large part to
silence and intimidate defendants, as well as draining
them of the resources necessary for adequate legal
defense.90 Often in such cases the plaintiff’s claims are
weak, or even spurious, because winning the lawsuit is
only a secondary aim. The primary aim of such lawsuits
is to send a public message to a targeted community of
activists or other stakeholders: stay silent. The message
to the broader movement is equally clear: be silent, or
you could be next. An outcome of SLAPPs is that they
remove conversations from the public sphere and shift
them into the courtroom, where the plaintiff behind the
SLAPP can leverage its access to (typically) vast financial
resources to stifle informed opposition. Defendants
targeted for SLAPPs almost always have less resources
with which to defend themselves and will often incur
significant costs, regardless of whether they win or lose

Energy Transfer is not the first company that has
leveraged the SLAPP strategy in an effort to strike back
at Greenpeace. In May 2016, Resolute Forestry Products
filed a CAD $300 million lawsuit for RICO and other
claims in the United States against Greenpeace, Stand.
earth and five individual activists. A U.S. federal judge
dismissed the lawsuit in 2017, writing in his decision:

“the defendant’s’ speech constituted the

expression of opinion, or different viewpoints
that [are] a vital part of our democracy.” and
“Moreover, many of Greenpeace’s publications
at issue rely on scientific research or fact.”91

Resolute found ways to extend the lawsuit for seven
years—an attempt to punish activists for speaking
out over the company’s destructive operations in the
Canadian boreal forest—but it was fully dismissed in
April 2023.92

The Diamond Pipeline, announced in 2014, was a
440-mile project that would carry crude oil from
Oklahoma’s Cushing Terminal directly to Valero’s
195,000-barrel-per-day Memphis Refinery, crossing
Arkansas and the federally recognized Muscogee
(Creek) Nation in the process.95 Beginning the same
year, the project faced resistance from landowners
who opposed the companies’ use of eminent domain
and who were alarmed by the risk of oil spills near
rivers and watersheds containing drinking water
resources.96 However, a larger movement opposing
the pipeline formed in 2017, centered primarily on
Indigenous environmental resistance and inspired
by the Standing Rock protests.97 Between January
and May 2017, Diamond Pipeline opponents
established the Oka Lawa resistance camp and held
protests in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee.
As well as expressing concerns over climate and
environmental pollution, Indigenous activists and
their allies were deeply disturbed that the pipeline
route would intersect the Trail of Tears, where victims
of the 19th century forced relocation are buried in
unmarked graves.98

Despite achieving notable inroads, Diamond Pipeline
opponents found themselves in a steep uphill battle. The
oil industry and its allies, fearful that Standing Rock-like
demonstrations could spread across the country, framed
environmental activists as criminals and fringe extremists.99
Fusion centers along the Diamond Pipeline route also
trafficked fears of “environmental rights extremists,”
despite not possessing credible evidence of such threats.100
Claims such as these have stigmatizing power that can
undercut collective solidarity and justify increasingly
harsh state repression toward protest.101 In May 2017,
Oklahoma enacted two anti-protest laws with first-of-
their-kind, strategic provisions targeting protest near
fossil fuel facilities.102 According to Ashley McCray, who
co-founded the Oka Lawa resistance camp, these laws
were “pretty successful” in thwarting continued activism.103

DIAMOND PIPELINEFossil Fuels and the Political Landscape

Big Oil’s Towering Influence In Oklahoma
Oklahoma elected officials answer to Big Oil and not
the other way around. In the early 2010s, when fracking
wastewater injection underground caused increasingly
frequent, powerful earthquakes across the state, Big Oil
took drastic steps to strangle reform.115 (Among them:
lobbying for SB 809, which restricted local governments’
ability to regulate oil and gas operations.116) Several
years later, when oil market woes plunged Oklahoma
into a budget crisis, Big Oil fought back against
proposed tax increases and threatened to relocate their
drilling to nearby states.117

At the forefront of the industry stood oil barons like
Harold Hamm and Larry Nichols, who maintained close
relationships with elected leaders. Hamm amassed
a family fortune exceeding $19 billion at the helm of
Continental Resources as the company grew to become
the largest oil producer in both Oklahoma and North
Dakota.118 He enjoyed a close relationship with Scott
Pruitt during Pruitt’s stints as Oklahoma Attorney
General and EPA Administrator. In the former role, Pruitt
was at the center of a “secretive alliance” of energy
firms and attorneys general that coordinated to oppose
environmental protections.119 In the latter role, Pruitt
attended dozens of closed-door events with fossil fuel

executives.120 Nichols, the co-founder of Devon Energy
and a former chairman of the American Petroleum
Institute (API), held a close relationship with Mary
Fallin, who served as Governor from 2011 to 2019.121
In 2016, Fallin, a former ALEC “legislator of the year,”
established an “Oilfield Prayer Day” in Oklahoma
to “thank God for the blessings created by the oil
and natural gas industry and to seek His wisdom
and ask for protection.”122 It would be under Fallin’s
leadership—and not lacking input from the fossil fuel
industry—that Oklahoma’s fossil fuel anti-protest bill
would be enacted into law.

The fossil fuel industry used trade groups, as well
as personal relationships with elected officials, to
assert its power: namely, the Oklahoma Independent
Producers Association (OIPA) and the Oklahoma Oil
and Gas Association (OKOGA). Hamm was a long-time
board member and the former chairman of OIPA.123
OKOGA’s board included representation from Devon
Energy, ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Phillips 66, and
Enbridge, all of whom were also members of API,
along with Plains All American, and four of whom were
members of AFPM, where Valero Energy’s CEO would
be named vice-chairman in 2017.124

aNalySIS: Board-level OKOGA Companies’ Lobbyists Reported

Thousands In Spending125

Between January and May 2017—when Oklahoma’s fossil fuel anti-protest legislation was
on its way to becoming law—board-level OKOGA companies’ lobbyists reported $23,473.54
in expenditures (not including lobbyist compensation, which the state does not require to
be reported.)126

Among these expenditures were more than 30 reported meals with the authors of HB 1123
and HB 2128. One of the authors, Rep. Mark McBride, was treated to a $174.39 dinner by a
lobbyist for the oil company OneOK.

Another expenditure was for tickets to see the Oklahoma City Thunder: a birthday gift for
Sen. Bryce Marlatt and two of his friends in the Senate paid for by a lobbyist for Devon
Energy.

DIAMOND PIPELINEOver Years, Local Police Accepted
Payments and Briefings From Pipeline
Companies
In 2017, Diamond Pipeline LLC donated $1 million to
first responder organizations in Oklahoma and Arkansas,
according to a press release in local news.127 A spokes-
person for Plains All American said that first responders
received “additional training and equipment to respond
safely to the hazards they may encounter in service of
their community.” The average grant value was report-
edly between $7,000-$10,000, “and, in some cases, rep-
resent as much as 100 percent of the receiving depart-

ments’ annual budgets.” It is unknown whether any of
the training sessions or equipment were protest-related.

Years earlier, however, local law enforcement officials
from Oklahoma and Nebraska, and the FBI, came
together for a briefing delivered by the Keystone
XL owner TransCanada about the threat posed by
environmental activists and local landowners.128
PowerPoint slides from the 2013 briefing included a list
of individuals previously arrested for nonviolent protest.
According to Inside Climate News, the FBI returned to
Oklahoma in 2017 to train local police on how to handle
the Oka Lawa protest camp.129

tactIc #1. Stigmatizing Protest

Law enforcement agencies in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and
Tennessee made claims that the movement opposed
to the Diamond Pipeline could turn violent at any time,
echoing fossil fuel industry rhetoric.130

In April 2017, when the Washington Examiner published
a troubling, and mysteriously leaked, government
report titled, “Potential Domestic Terrorist Threats
to Multi-State Diamond Pipeline Construction.”131
The report, which was attributed to the DHS, and
Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee fusion center
entities, claimed that “environmental rights extremists”
were the most likely domestic terrorist threat to the
Diamond Pipeline project, while also admitting to not
possessing any credible information regarding such
threats. Fusion centers across the country, including
the Oklahoma Information Fusion Center, have a track
record of coordinating with fossil fuel companies and
perhaps even serving private interests rather than
public safety.132 Although the cause for the leak has
remained unknown, similar government leaks are
often deliberate and politically-motivated, according to
Margaret Kwoka, a University of Denver Sturm College
of Law professor who was interviewed by DeSmog.133
Notably, the Washington Examiner is owned by the
fracking billionaire and former API board member Philip
Anschutz.134 Shortly after the report was published by

the Washington Examiner, its claims were reproduced by
Fox13 Memphis.135

One section of the leaked fusion center report listed
out “Behavioral Indicators of Planned Violence,” which
all but erased the distinction between non-violent
civil disobedience and violent extremism. Among the
indicators:

Signs of trespassing or suspicious persons in
construction areas possibly indicating pre-
incident surveillance; […]

Reports of individuals wearing all dark
or black clothing and mask or bandanas
without a reasonable explanation; […]

Reports of “direct action” training camps […]

Unsurprisingly, the police response to demonstrations
in all three states reflected significant distrust toward
protesters.136 Nearly 50 police and fire vehicles
responded to the January 16 protest outside Valero’s
Memphis Refinery, where some protesters locked
themselves to concrete-filled barrels: “a large showing
out of concern the barrels could explode,” according

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY 20 23  |  27

DIAMOND PIPELINEto local news.137 A 22-year old protester who locked
himself to Diamond Pipeline construction equipment
in Arkansas was arrested under felony charges carrying
up to six years in prison and $10,000 in fines, after Delta
Directional Drilling filed a criminal complaint alleging
damages.138 In Oklahoma, Ashley McCray, the co-founder

of the Oka Lawa camp, recalled aerial surveillance and
traffic stops where activists were questioned by police
near the entrance to the camp. These police measures
and rhetoric cast the movement opposing the Diamond
Pipeline as outsiders, thus reproducing coercive stigmas
that discouraged solidarity and protest.139

tactIc #2. Boosting Penalties For Protest

Oklahoma’s HB 1123 was introduced just days after the
January 30 press conference that activists, including
McCray, held on the steps of the state capitol where they
promised to oppose the Diamond Pipeline.140 The bill,
authored by Rep. Scott Biggs, carried new penalties for
protests and civil disobedience near so-called “critical
infrastructure,” an umbrella term that was defined to
include energy facilities, crude oil and gas pipelines,
railways, telecommunications infrastructure, and
more.141

 The penalties for trespassing with intent to impede
or inhibit such a facility’s operations were at least
$10,000 in fines, imprisonment for one year, or both.
Willfully damaging, vandalizing, or tampering with such
a facility would increase the fines to $100,000 and the
prison sentence to a maximum of 10 years. The bill also
sought to create liability for organizations that support
protesters by treating such support as a criminal
conspiracy, with fines as high as $1,000,000.

Rep. Biggs and Sen. Bryce Marlatt, who became HB
1123’s principal Senate author, were among the fossil
fuel industry’s unwavering allies in elected office.
Both candidates had easily won their elections in
2016, amassing significant fossil fuel donations in
the process.142 Among their donors were at least 15

corporate members of OKOGA, OIPA, and the AFPM (see
Table below).

 Biggs was not shy about his motivations. “Across
the country, we have seen time and time again these
protests have turned violent,” Biggs said on the House
floor when introduced HB 1123.143 Moreover, according
to Tulsa World, he told the Oklahoma House Judiciary
Committee on Criminal Justice and Corrections that
the bill was “prompted by oil and gas industry concerns
arising from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.”144
Biggs had accepted $1,000 from ETP in the 2016 election
cycle. Marlatt, too, had accepted $1,500 from ETP, in a
transaction dated November 16, 2016, months after he
had already clinched re-election.145

When HB 1123 passed in the House, Rep. Mark McBride
introduced a related bill, HB 2128, that would grant
companies the ability to hold protesters and their
supporters liable for property damages.146

 Rep. McBride, House co-author Jonathan Echols, and
principal Senate author Ann Griffin were also close allies
to the fossil fuel industry. They amassed donations from
many of the same companies as Biggs and Marlatt.147
In an appeal to the House, McBride said his bill was an
effort to deter “paid protesters.”148

Valero and OKOGA Appealed Directly to
Gov. Fallin to Sign Anti-Protest Legislation
Emails obtained by Documented and The Intercept
show that Valero and OKOGA appealed directly to Gov.
Fallin asking her to sign HB 1123 and HB 2128, after the
bills passed in the Oklahoma legislature.150

“Julie Kumpyan w/ Valero called to urge you to please
sign HB 1123 (regarding making it illegal to trespass
on critical infrastructure). They think it will help deter
vandalism & disruptive actions,” wrote Fallin’s assistant
in a May 1 email to the Governor.151

The Executive Vice President of OKOGA wrote to Fallin
on behalf of the association on May 12. The letter
stressed that fossil fuel opponents were aiming
“to not only interrupt construction of pipeline and oil
and gas projects, but to also harm existing facilities”
and that HB 2128 was important “to protect all
Oklahomans from risk of losing efficient and
affordable access to critical services.”152

Fallin signed HB 1123 on May 3 and HB 2128 on
May 15, 2017.

DIAMOND PIPELINE
The Fossil Fuel Industry Used ALEC to
Spread Fossil Fuel Anti-Protest Laws Across the Country

Seizing on the successful passage of HB 1123 and HB 2128 in Oklahoma, the fossil fuel industry turned to the
American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in its efforts to spread fossil fuel anti-protest laws across
the country. Through ALEC, HB 1123 and HB 2128 were combined into a ready-made template bill named the
“Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.”153 A lobbyist for the trade group AFPM was revealed to have been
“intimately involved” in crafting the template bill in leaked audio from an energy conference obtained by The
Intercept.154

Bloomberg reported that “AFPM, and one of its top members, Marathon Petroleum Corp., spearheaded
efforts to get ALEC to support the model legislation in 2017, according to two people familiar with the
matter.”155 AFPM and Marathon Petroleum were joined in a letter urging lawmakers to support the proposal
by four other trade groups—the American Gas Association, the American Chemistry Council, the Energy
Policy Network, and Edison Electric Institute. The letter, obtained by Huffington Post, emphasized that
environmentalists targeting critical infrastructure “expose individuals, communities, and the environment to
unacceptable levels of risk.”156

The task force that considered the model bill was co-directed by Grant Kidwell, a former Americans For
Prosperity (AFP) and Charles Koch Institute lobbyist, and included representatives from AFPM and major
fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil, Koch Industries, Duke Energy, American Gas Association and
Peabody Energy.157 The bill was approved in January by ALEC’s Private Enterprise Advisory Council—its
corporate board—which included executives from AFP, Koch Industries, and ExxonMobil at the time.

Bills based on ALEC’s “Critical Infrastructure Protection Act,” referred to by Greenpeace as fossil fuel anti-
protest bills, have spread widely. By the end of 2019, new fossil fuel anti-protest laws had been enacted in
ten states: Oklahoma, Iowa, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Missouri, and
Wisconsin. By the end of 2021, the number of states with fossil fuel anti-protest laws had grown to 17 with
the addition of Kentucky, West Virginia, Mississippi, Ohio, Kansas, Arkansas, and Montana. At the time of
writing, 22 states have such laws due to the addition of Alabama in 2022, and North Carolina, Utah, Oregon,
and Georgia in 2023 (these bills are discussed in the “2023 and the Road Ahead” section).158

ALEC has played a crucial role spreading these bills. ALEC-affiliated legislators sponsored or authored these
bills in 18 out of the 22 states where they were passed.159 In a 2019 email, ALEC took credit for “educating”
legislators about “critical infrastructure protection” in seven states, five of which have enacted such bills into
law.160

In general, Republican lawmakers are receptive to ALEC model legislation. According to an investigation
by USA Today, The Arizona Republic, and the Center for Public Integrity, “bills based on ALEC models were
introduced nearly 2,900 times [...] from 2010 through 2018, with more than 600 becoming law.”161 Carrying
model legislation can bring long-term benefits such as relationships and campaign financial support that
further lawmakers’ careers, according to multiple experts quoted in the investigation.

DIAMOND PIPELINEATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND
MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINE

The Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP) and the Mountain
Valley Pipeline (MVP), sought after by the fossil fuel
industry to uncork Appalachian fracked gas growth,
drew massive and sustained grassroots resistance.
Both pipelines were announced in 2014, but it was not
until 2020 that ACP would be canceled, a major victory
for concerned residents, community leaders, and
environmentalists who opposed the project at every
step. If built, the $8 billion, 550-mile pipeline would have
crossed steep mountains, sensitive watersheds, and
countless streams, and disproportionately impacted
low-income and communities of color.164 Compressor
stations were planned for construction in the historically
Black, Freedman-built community of Union Hill in
rural Buckingham, Virginia, and a census block in
Northampton County, North Carolina, where 79% of the
population is Black.165 The pipeline would have ended
in Robeson, North Carolina, the most ethnically diverse
rural county in the United States and the ancestral home
of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.166 When it was
canceled, ACP was over two years behind schedule,
billions of dollars over budget, and still lacked certain
permits due to a string of successful legal challenges.167

MVP, like ACP, entailed significant safety, conservation, and
environmental justice risks, enough so that the company
has amassed hundreds of violations and had one of its
proposed compressor stations struck down under the
Virginia Environmental Justice Act.168 Yet, construction on
the pipeline resumed in 2023, resulting from a deal sought
by U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin that permitted MVP by fiat and
sharply limited court review of the project.169

Despite prolonged efforts, the fossil fuel industry and its
allies in government have had only mixed success at
quashing years-long opposition to these pipeline projects.
Fusion center entities have viewed the opposition as a
hotbed for potential violent extremism, a false political
trope that has been widely promoted by the industry to
clear the way for faster pipeline construction.170  At the
same time, they have coordinated extensively with
Dominion and EQT Corporation (EQT) to monitor activism,
effectively serving the private interests of these companies.

Starting in 2018, Virginia and West Virginia have used
escalating fines, arrests, and subjective buffer zones
that deter civil disobedience, but many protesters have
adapted or endured in the face of these pressures.

Since 2020, fossil fuel anti-protest laws have been enacted
in West Virginia and North Carolina, posing a threat to
continuing resistance to the Mountain Valley Pipeline.
These laws carry extreme and unnecessary penalties for
conduct that was already addressed under pre-existing
law. North Carolina’s law, passed in June 2023, is especially
draconian: attempting to obstruct, impede, or impair
pipeline construction can be punished by more than 15
years in prison and a mandatory $250,000 fine.171 No such
fossil fuel anti-protest laws have passed in Virginia. But in
September 2023, MVP took direct aim at its critics through
a lawsuit that seeks to constrain more than 41 individuals
and two organizations from activities that are alleged to
have slowed construction of the MVP project, including
fundraising, as well as seeking more than $4 million in
damages.172 These threats to protest and dissent are
compounded by anti-environmental backlash that has
been manufactured by the fossil fuel industry and their
back-pocket elected officials, particularly in West Virginia.

from entering private property to survey.177 Meanwhile, coalitions

•  March 28: The anonymous activist “Nutty” embarked on a “monopod” blockade blocking a service
road on the other side of Peters Mountain.180 In April, the U.S. Forest Service closed access to the road
and began preventing supporters from delivering food and other supplies to Nutty, who eventually
descended on May 23, days after they said their reserves ran out.181

•  aPrIl 2: Theresa “Red” and Minor Terry embarked on a tree-sit on property their family has owned for

generations. On April 11, local police told the Terrys that their family and friends could no longer deliver
them food. (After public outcry, the police began supplying Red and Minor with daily bagged bologna
sandwich meals.) On April 20, MVP asked a federal judge to hold the Terrys in civil contempt and remove
them. Facing escalating fines and forcible removal, the Terrys descended on May 5.182

•  aPrIl 20: Anonymous activists embarked on a tree-sit on a separate property in Franklin County, VA

called Little Teel Crossing. The landowners, who claimed no connection to the tree-sitters, were sued by
MVP for neglecting to remove the tree-sitters on MVP’s behalf. One of the tree-sitters was injured on May
25, when MVP workers cut branches that were dangerously close to the activist’s perch. The last activist
at Little Teel Crossing descended on May 28 after facing contempt of court charges.183

•  aPrIl 22: Supporters who crossed the police buffer zone surrounding Nutty were ordered to the ground,

shackled, and arrested by armed police.184

•  May 21: The anonymous tree-sitter “Fern” set up a monopod near Nutty, just days before Nutty’s descent,
and was forcibly removed by U.S. Forest Service and Virginia State Police less than two weeks later.185

ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINEFossil Fuels and the Political Landscape

West Virginia: Fossil Fuel Empire?
The fossil fuel industry’s grip over West Virginia politics
is evidenced by its ties to government officials, as well
as its political spending. West Virginia’s governor since
2017, Jim Justice II, inherited a coal business from his
father. A billionaire and climate denier, Justice has said
that God will “give us time” to fix climate change- “if” it
exists, concluding that “we don’t want to forget about
the coal and natural gas industries” in West Virginia
and it’s time to “Drill, baby, drill!”190 Justice’s appointee
for Secretary of Commerce, Woody Thrasher, is the co-
founder and former president of the Thrasher Group,
a firm that provides technical services for oil and gas
pipeline projects and was caught surveying along the
ACP route in North Carolina without a valid license.191
As the main regulator and promoter of business in
the state, Sec. Thrasher was tasked with overseeing
an 84-billion dollar West Virginia petrochemical deal
with China, the Appalachian Storage and Trading Hub,
a deal which the Thrasher Group stood to benefit
from.192 West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey
is a member and former chairman of the Republican
Attorneys General Association, an ALEC-like group
that connects paying fossil fuel executives with ultra-
conservative attorneys general to strategize on fighting
environmental regulation, among other activities.193

As for political spending, the Energy and Natural
Resources sector contributed $4.6 million to state
election campaigns since the 2014 election cycle, when
ACP and MVP were announced.194 Of that, $301,310 has
gone to supporting Jim Justice and $479,242 has gone
to supporting Patrick Morrisey.195

Duke and Dominion’s Powerhouse Politics
In Virginia and North Carolina, the monopolies behind
ACP are enormously influential. Since 2014, Dominion
has contributed over $16 million to Virginia state
elections, dwarfing its closest energy sector peer by
about eight times, and reported more than $3.2 million
on lobbying across both Virginia and North Carolina.196
Over the same timeframe, Duke has channeled $2.3
million into North Carolina election campaigns through
direct donations and numerous PACs.197 Its lobbying
efforts in North Carolina have totaled more than $6.7
million, and its “influence spending” could top $80
million annually, according to an analysis by NC WARN
that covers about a dozen spending categories including
public relations, civic relations, philanthropy, and
business association memberships, in addition to state
and federal election spending and lobbying.198

The companies struck deals in both states that were
criticized as blatant “pay-to-play” schemes. Virginia

ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINEGovernor Terry McAuliffe brokered a “guarantee” that
Virginia would approve ACP in exchange for a $57.8
million payment to public and private conservation
entities, and two MVP deals worth $30 million total that
preemptively absolved the companies of responsibility
for damage to Virginia’s forests, water resources,
and historic properties.199 North Carolina Governor
Roy Cooper also struck a $57.8 million deal with
ACP: a mitigation fund intended to compensate for
“unavoidable effects of the ACP on the interior forest
habitats, open-space lands, water bodies, and natural
resources of the communities along the ACP’s route.”200

Officeholders in both states held direct or indirect
interests in ACP and its joint owners. Five Virginia
legislators who threw their weight behind ACP also had
investments in Dominion. Among them was Senator Bill
DeSteph, the primary sponsor of 3 out of the 6 fossil fuel

anti-protest bills introduced in Virginia, who held more
than $250,000 of Dominion stock.201 North Carolina
Senator Dan Blue’s legal firm was procured for legal
services by Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC in at least 32 land
condemnation proceedings along the pipeline route.202
At the same time, Sen. Blue co-sponsored and was the
lead spokesperson for SB 559, a bill that Duke Energy
extensively lobbied for. Gov. Cooper’s predecessor Pat
McCrory, who was serving when ACP was announced
in 2014, has a long, documented relationship with
Duke Energy — both as a stockholder and former 28-
year employee.203 The McCrory administration worked
to dramatically expand natural gas infrastructure
in North Carolina, and ardently supported ACP and
Atlantic drilling for gas.204 McCrory also served as a
spokesperson for the Koch-controlled lobbying group

ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINEPublic-Private Security Coordination
Dominion and EQT built close relationships with
law enforcement in North Carolina and Virginia,
which opened the door for potential abuses of law
enforcement authority.207 These companies fed
recurring intelligence updates and meeting agendas
to state police. Some state and local police agencies
upheld the cozy relationship by participating in joint
meetings, offering to share intelligence back to the
pipeline companies, and allowing police officers to work
off-duty as private security.

Dominion sent agendas for recurring meetings
with state and federal law enforcement

In December 2017, the North Carolina Information
Sharing and Analysis Center—a fusion center under
the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation—
produced a field analysis report warning that “ACP
has the potential to become a regional focal point for
ideologically or politically motivated violent extremist
actors.”208 Yet the report also admitted to having no
specific, credible information that violent actors were
targeting the operations.

Public records obtained by the Blue Ridge
Environmental Defense League, and reviewed by
Greenpeace USA, reveal that Dominion personnel sent
meeting agendas for a “recurring Law Enforcement/ACP
Security Information Sharing Working Group meeting”
to more than a dozen law enforcement personnel across
federal and Virginia, North Carolina, and West Virginia
state agencies as early as July 2017.209 The first agenda,
for a September 5 meeting, included:

ACP Security Information Exchange eRoom [...]

Opposition updates [...]

ETP lawsuit against Greenpeace—Enterprise of
Eco-terrorists

Bold Alliance, 350.org, Sierra Club,
Veterans Stand (Veteran Service Corps)

(Fight White Nationalism) [...]

StopETP Campaign (September 8-9,
2017) target list

Tiger Swan HQ—Apex, NC

ETP Pipelines—Rover Pipeline, WV

Army Corps of Engineers Office - Nationwide

Roundtable

ETP does not appear to be among the email recipients,
despite appearing relevant to items on the agenda.

In ongoing emails, some of the recipients exchanged
information about public events that included, for
example, a Sierra Club-hosted meeting to discuss
Indigenous perspectives on the ACP.

According to Dominion’s Construction, Operation, and
Maintenance Plan, local security contractors and/or off-
duty police officers would be used to maintain security
at worksites.210 Emails reveal that Dominion contacted
ten local Sheriff’s Offices in North Carolina asking
whether they would allow their officers to work off-duty
as private security, and nearly all of them answered yes.
According to a forwarded attachment, Dominion also
prepared a list of questions for the North Carolina State
Highway Patrol. Among them:

	| Will the North Carolina State Highway Patrol be willing
to consider Dominion Energy support in sponsoring a
FEMA Cut Team Training?

	| Does the North Carolina State Highway Patrol have
sufficient cut team equipment to respond to all ACP
incidents?

“Cut Teams” are personnel charged with cutting through
equipment used in blockades to remove protesters.

On June 12, 2018, a Dominion security analyst sent
an email introduction between the head Security
Coordinator for EQT and officials with the North Carolina
Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

The Virginia Fusion Center Coordinated With
EQT and Compared Environmental Activists to
Al Qaeda

The Virginia Fusion Center (VFC) encouraged EQT
personnel to share information on Mountain Valley
Pipeline activity “so the information could be vetted and
disseminated to those that need to know.” When tree-
clearing and construction were scheduled to begin in
2018, Cynthia Waters, a Virginia State Police intelligence
analyst, informed local law enforcement officers that
EQT would be in touch to schedule meetings and offered
to follow up to discuss “VFC support throughout the
project’s duration.”211

According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, “[t]he state
records also show that the Fusion Center disseminated
‘pipeline situation reports,’ which included information
on how many people on Facebook were ‘interested’ in

meetings of groups such as the Sierra Club, Chesapeake
Climate Action Network and Preserve Floyd.” Emails
obtained by Climate Investigations Center, and reviewed
by Greenpeace USA, indicate that the pipeline situation
reports were being produced and disseminated daily
during March and April 2018.212

A 2019 VFC intelligence assessment, discovered by The
Intercept, referred to groups that build citizen support
networks opposing pipelines as “criminal environmental
groups.”213 This deeply problematic framing was
repeated 28 times in the ten-page document. The
assessment even used examples from al Qaeda,
including a mosque bombing and an Osama Bin Laden
quote, to demonstrate insurgent tactics, and warned
that the same tactics could be used “in order to gain
support and impact pipeline construction in Virginia.”

ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINEtactIc #1. Escalating Enforcement Against Protesters

Through the Courts
After the start of construction in January 2018, MVP
turned to the courts in its efforts to clear protesters
from the pipeline construction route. Its first attempt,
a preliminary injunction aimed at tree-sitters on the
West Virginia side of Peters Mountain in the Jefferson
National Forest in March 2018, was decisively rejected
by Monroe County Judge Robert Irons.214

But the company’s success rate improved after it
turned to the federal court system. In April 2018, MVP
petitioned the U.S. District Court to hold Red and Minor
Terry in contempt of court for refusing to vacate a tree-
sit on their own property.215 Several weeks later, U.S.
District Court Judge Elizabeth Dillion did just that, and
the Terrys complied under the threat of $1,000 in fines
per day and forcible removal by the U.S. marshal.216
Judge Dillon also presided over hearings brought by
MVP attorneys related to the protests at Little Teel
Crossing. The property owners argued that they were
unconnected to the tree-sitters and should not be
responsible for removing them, but were still found
in contempt of court.217 Contempt-of-court findings
were also used to pressure the tree-sitters at Little Teel
Crossing to climb down.218

In September 2018, after the first wave of aerial blockades
had been cleared, several protesters embarked on one
of the longest tree-sits in U.S. history at Yellow Finch
Lane in Elliston, VA. MVP won an injunction against
the tree-sitters and their support camp in November
2020, resulting in $500 fines per day in Montgomery
Circuit Court.219 The tree-sitters refused to comply and
were forcibly removed on March 24, 2021. Although the
tree-sitters faced criminal charges that would result
in months-long jail sentences, MVP also successfully
pursued civil charges for $141,386 in compensation.220

Through Policing and Security
Law enforcement from the U.S. Forest Service used
buffer zones and arrests that prevented food and water
from being lifted up to the Peters Mountain activists.
The monopod protester, Nutty, says she went six weeks
without resupplies before eventually coming down.221

One day, when a group of supporters ducked across the
caution tape to bring Nutty daypacks filled with supplies,
“at least ten law-enforcement vehicles and over a dozen
officers from multiple agencies arrived with assault
rifles,” according to Outside Magazine.222 The supporters
were ordered to the ground and at least one was hand-
cuffed and leg-shackled. In a faxed letter to the Forest
Service, Virginia attorneys Tammy Belinski and Alan Graf
said “No one knows, whether [Nutty] has the strength
or volition to leave the pod. If she cannot do so, Forest
Service’s actions in continuing to starve her out are
tantamount to torture and contrary to human rights and
International Law.”223 Roanoke County law enforcement
prevented supporters from delivering supplies to Red
and Minor Terry, but began delivering bagged meals to
them after receiving negative media attention.224

Although many activists were aware of the potential for
legal consequences, some were arrested on shaky and
increasingly trumped up charges. Two activists were
arrested by U.S. marshals in May 2018 for allegedly
failing to comply with an officer’s order, despite not
having crossed into the easement boundary, according
to the activists.225 In 2019, three non-violent MVP
protesters in West Virginia were arrested and charged
with felony threats of terrorist acts, each on a separate
occasion.226 And in 2021 and 2022, District Attorneys in
Giles County and Roanoke County brought restitution
charges against protesters to recover costs associated
with police officers’ time.227 In an email obtained by
EarthRights International during the latter lawsuit, the
Roanoke County Attorney wrote that billing for higher
expenses would be “sending a message that such
unlawful and unsafe MVP protesting will not be tolerated
in the County and that protesters will be responsible for
costs incurred.”

In addition to coordinating with the VFC, MVP’s private
security was accused by tree-sitters of harassment with
spotlights and loud noise at night, preventing them
from sleeping, and filing malicious charges against
activists.228 MVP also proceeded with tree cutting near
the tree-sitters at Little Teel Crossing, which the activists
described as reckless.229

ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINEtactIc #2. Boosting Penalties for Protest

West Virginia’s 2020 Fossil Fuel Anti-
Protest Bill Was Pushed By the Industry
The West Virginia “Critical Infrastructure Protection
Act,” based closely on ALEC’s model legislation, was
signed into law by Gov. Jim Justice on April 15, 2020.
The Intercept reported several companies and groups
that worked to advance the bill: AFPM, Dominion
Resources, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas
Association.230 In a celebratory email after the bill passed
through the legislature, a lobbyist for AFPM took credit
for “organizing the wide base of support.” In the bill
introduction year and preceding year, the bill’s primary
sponsor, John Kelly, accepted contributions from AFPM
members: $1,000 from Marathon Petroleum and $500
from ExxonMobil.

Dominion’s role, however, should not be overlooked.
Research from The Intercept revealed that a Dominion
lobbyist communicated with West Virginia’s House
Majority Leader, a West Virginia House Energy
Committee lawyer, and lobbyists for EQM and
Southwestern Energy about “a bill to address civil
disobedience towards pipeline” less than a year before
the “Critical Infrastructure Protection Act” was passed.
At the time, Dominion occupied the Vice President seat
on WVONGA’s board, which had substantial overlap with
AFPM, and was registered to lobby for a similar bill in
Ohio for the 3rd straight year.231 Later, in 2023, Dominion
would lobby for fossil fuel anti-protest legislation in
Utah.

North Carolina and Virginia Anti-Protest
Legislation
Since 2017, there have been eight anti-protest bills
introduced in Virginia, none of which have been enacted
into law. Three of them were introduced in August
2020, after outpourings due to the killing of George
Floyd shook Richmond, Virginia. None of the bills are
closely related to ALEC’s model bill or specifically target
trespassing near energy infrastructure.

There is no evidence that the fossil fuel or energy
industry had an interest in these bills. But Bill DeSteph,
the primary sponsor of four of the bills, appears to be
a major ally to Dominion. In addition to holding more
than $250,000 in Dominion stock, DeSteph has accepted
$101,750 in campaign donations from Dominion
since 2019 and appeared as an ACP “endorser” on the
company’s website.232 Most of Dominion’s donations
to DeSteph were made between 2020 and 2022, even
though DeSteph’s next election was not until 2024.
Other Virginia anti-protest bill sponsors (including
cosponsors) have reaped a combined $54,500 in
political contributions from Dominion.233

There have been 12 anti-protest bills introduced in
North Carolina since 2017. Several of them appeared
to be a direct response to racial justice protests that
formed after the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott
(2016) and Andrew Brown Jr. (2021).234 They included
bills that would provide legal immunity for drivers who
hit protesters with their car, impose felony charges for
any person found to engage in a riot, waive liability
for law enforcement officers who injure or kill “using
reasonable force under the circumstances and acting
in good faith to enforce the laws,” and impose criminal
liability on state officials who order police to stand down
in response to demonstrations.235 But it would take until
2023 for North Carolina to enact anti-protest legislation:
H 40, a “riot” bill, and S 58, an ALEC-inspired fossil fuel
anti-protest bill.

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY 20 23  |  39

ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINES 58 specifically included energy facilities that are
planned or under construction in its definition of
“critical infrastructure.” Under the law, according to
ICNL, “a group of people protesting the construction of
a fossil fuel pipeline could face more than 15 years in
prison and a mandatory $250,000 fine if they impede
or impair the construction of a pipeline, for instance by
blocking workers’ access to the pipeline construction
site.” The bill’s primary sponsor, Sen. Paul Newton, was
a long-time Duke Energy employee including President
of Duke Energy North Carolina.236

It is so far unknown whether Duke lobbied for either
bill, but in 2022, Duke contributed more than $176,000
to both bills’ primary sponsors and cosponsors.
In addition to Duke, other fossil fuel and energy
companies contributed more than $260,000 to the NC
anti-protest bill sponsors in 2022. The #2-7 contributors
after Duke were the North Carolina Association of Rural
Electric Cooperatives ($123,700), Dominion ($57,200),
Koch Industries ($25,800), Norfolk Southern ($19,750),
Marathon Petroleum and Williams Companies (each
around $11,000).237

and Agricultural task force—which included lobbyists
for Charles Koch’s Americans for Prosperity Foundation,
Koch Companies Public Sector, and AFPM—adopted
a model “Energy Discrimination Elimination Act”
by unanimous vote.247 The policy was adapted from
ALEC’s longtime opposition to boycotts, divestment
and sanctions efforts against Israeli occupation of
Palestine.248 In 2023, anti-ESG bills were introduced in
37 states, 22 of which became law despite widespread
pushback from business lobbyists, workers unions and
environmental advocates.249

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the fossil fuel industry and
its allies helped manufacture the very basis of the
anti-ESG fears they helped spread.250 Large fossil fuel
companies routinely publish ESG commitments, a
practice that often amounts to greenwashing. Most of
the banks and financial institutions targeted by the
anti-ESG backlash are still doing plenty of business with
fossil fuel companies. Take BlackRock, a recent target
of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who pulled state
investments from the money manager at the end of
2022.251 In a panel just weeks earlier, BlackRock’s CEO
told the audience “I actually believe we’re going to need
hydrocarbons for 70 years.” The company’s investments
have also been tied to deforestation and Indigenous
rights violations, according to BlackRock’s Big Problem,
an advocacy coalition calling on asset managers like
BlackRock to rapidly align their business practices with
a climate-safe world.252

ACP companies bankrolled a business coalition that
used deceptive research and pro-pipeline messaging in
an effort to build public support for ACP construction.239
The so-called “EnergySure Coalition” paid for one-
sided TV, radio, print and website ads that appealed
to economic and social justice values.240 To burnish
its claims, the coalition used flawed polling data from
the Tarrance Group, which openly described itself as
a “Republican strategic research and polling firm,”
and a biased report that was paid for by Dominion.241
Messaging used by the coalition was disparaging toward
the pipeline opposition movement, using taglines
such as, “Families on the line: Build the ACP” and “ACP
opposition: Focused on blocking access to American
energy and new jobs.”242 Social scientists refer to
arguments like these as “discourses of delay,” which
emphasize the downsides of climate policies and raise
doubt that climate action is possible.243 The spread and
strategic use of such rhetoric has contributed to making
environmentalism “a new front in the culture wars,
becoming ever-more enmeshed in broader identity
and grievance politics,” according to research by the
Institute for Strategic Dialogue.244

The fossil fuel industry and its allies in government have
seized on opportunities to stoke cultural divisions and
manufacture anti-environmental backlash, which lend
credence to efforts to stifle protest and dissent, despite
the fact that a supermajority of Americans support
climate action.245 After leading a lawsuit against the
federal Environmental Protection Agency, West Virginia
Attorney General Morrissey co-led an effort opposing
ESG investing—an acronym for environmental, social
and governance—which he blamed on “the woke left
[mission] to change every facet of American life … and
erode our democratic institutions.” West Virginia’s state
treasurer Riley Moore and state delegate Zack Maynard
have also been key figures in the anti-ESG movement,
which was initiated and amplified by fossil fuel
lobbyists at groups that included the West Virginia Coal
Association.246 In 2021, ALEC’s Energy, Environment,

In 2014, Enbridge proposed replacing and expanding
a segment of its pipeline network known as Line 3.
Originating in the tar sands region of Edmonton, Alberta,
Line 3 was intended to carry Canadian tar sands oil—a
highly polluting form of crude oil—to Enbridge’s 550-acre
oil terminal in Superior, Wisconsin.253 The expansion
project would increase Line 3’s capacity from 390,000
barrels per day (bpd) to 915,000 bpd.254 The new route
would snake its way across the state of Minnesota and
cross territories referenced in a series of treaties between
the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) and the U.S. government,
where Anishinaabe rights to hunt, fish, and gather were
upheld by a 1999 Supreme Court decision.255

By 2017, six Ojibwe Bands (the Red Lake, White Earth,
Fond du Lac, Leech Lake, Mille Lacs, and Bois Forte
Bands) and Honor the Earth were raising concerns over
the U.S. portion of the Line 3 replacement project.256
A fundamental concern, according to letters that the
White Earth and Red Lake Bands sent to state officials,
was “the failure of state government agencies to fairly
recognize and respect our natural resource and other
sovereign rights across northern Minnesota.”257 In
related terms, the Indigenous resistance movement
opposing Line 3 was intimately linked to Anishinaabe

struggles for off-reservation land management rights
and the defense of their sacred wild rice from pollution,
as well as the broader climate action movement.258
Underscoring pollution-related concerns, a Greenpeace
USA report found that Enbridge and its subsidiaries
had spilled 66,059 barrels of hazardous liquids from
incidents that occurred, on average, once every 20 days
between 2002 and 2018.259

As years passed, the movement opposing Line 3 grew
and diversified. The Red Lake, White Earth, and Mille
Lac Bands, along with environmental organizations,
leveraged a variety of legal strategies to halt the
project.260 Demonstrations were held across the state,
and several resistance camps, including the Giniw
Collective’s Namewag Camp, were founded along the
pipeline route.261

Minnesota’s government was supportive of Line 3, but
sought to avoid the political mistakes made at Standing
Rock. The state and Enbridge touted their support for
protesters’ rights. But they also quietly used surveillance
to monitor activism, hostile police tactics to clear civil
disobedience, and narrative campaigns to turn public
opinion against demonstrators. As a result, around 1,000
demonstrators were arrested for activities related to
Line 3 protests between 2021 and 2022, and many were
charged with trumped up charges.262 Nevertheless, the
movement opposed to the Line 3 pipeline endured for
years, and fossil fuel industry-backed efforts to pass
anti-protest legislation failed due to the considerable
power held by Democrats in Minnesota state government
and strong opposition from civil society groups.

LINE 3SPrINg-SuMMEr 2021

Increased urgency to slow Line 3 construction combined with the Spring thaw paved the way for a new phase of non-
violent direct action. Protests crescendoed in late summer 2021 and met fierce suppression from law enforcement. Key
events are detailed below.

•  JuNE 7: During the Indigenous-led Treaty People Gathering, a Border Patrol helicopter descended to a low level,

kicking up dust and showering protesters with debris. Officials claimed that the helicopter was brought in to execute
a dispersal order, but the announcement is inaudible to many protesters. By the end of the day, 186 demonstrators
had been detained.269

•  JuNE 28: the Hubbard County Sheriff’s Office informed Tara Houska, the founder of Giniw Collective, that they would
be closing off and barricading access to their Namewag camp, which was located on private property used with
permission and acquired in 2018 by Winona LaDuke. There were no illegal activities alleged to be occurring on the
property. A judge later granted a temporary restraining order against Hubbard County authorities, barring them
from interfering with access to the property.270

•  July 30: Water protectors were pepper sprayed and hit with rubber bullets after climbing a fence during their effort

to prevent drilling under the Red River, a site that Houska said has particular significance to the Red Lake Nation and
all Pembina Ojibwe Bands of the 1863 treaty signed with the United States.271

•  auguSt 2021: Over the course of several weeks, water protectors documented numerous incidents of pain
compliance torture in response to efforts to prevent drilling under the Red River. These tactics, according to
interviews with water protectors, included applying pressure to the face and jaw area that resulted in jaw dislocation
and nerve damage causing face paralysis.272

LINE 3Fossil Fuels and the Political Landscape

Minnesota’s Midstream Madness
Although Minnesota does not possess fossil fuel
deposits, it is an essential fossil fuel gateway: nearly
two-thirds of Canadian crude oil imports into the U.S. are
transported through the state.275 Practically all of these
imports flow through the Enbridge-owned Mainline
System, which runs from the Alberta tar sands region to
destinations in the Great Lakes region.276 And roughly
one-sixth of these imports are processed at Minnesota’s

Pine Bend Refinery, which is owned by Koch Industries
subsidiary Flint Hills Resources.277 The refinery has been
called a “cash cow” for the Koch Industries empire,
serving as a key profit center from the 1960s to the
present.278 According to 350 Minnesota, Koch Industries is
the most powerful voice on climate and energy issues in
the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, a group that has
opposed “nearly every pro-environment proposal and
legislation over the past decade or more.”279

aNalySIS: Line 3 Stakeholders and Pro-Line 3 Trade Groups
Spent Over $43 Million On Lobbying in Minnesota
Between 2014 and 2021280

Enbridge, prospective Line 3 shippers, and pro-Line 3 trade groups spent a combined
$43,732,942 on lobbying in Minnesota from 2014 to 2021, the timeframe spanning Line 3’s
announcement through completion. Among these organizations, Enbridge and the
Minnesota Chamber of Commerce were the top spenders. The company spent more than $1
million on lobbying in Minnesota every year between 2014 and 2021. In 2018, it spent nearly
$11 million lobbying the Minnesota PUC—more than double all other entities combined.281
The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce spent more than $2 million annually on lobbying
between 2016 and 2020.

Flint Hills, the Koch Industries subsidiary, spent more than $4 million on lobbying between
2014 and 2021. In 2019, it was part of a group with Marathon Petroleum and other businesses
that tried and failed to block a state-wide electric vehicles program.282 Marathon Petroleum
is the country’s largest oil refiner, and was investigated by Congress the same year after a
New York Times investigation found that it had worked with Koch-backed industry groups
to “run a stealth campaign to roll back car emissions standards.”283

Enbridge Used Self-Serving Payments and
Donations To Shore Up Support
Enbridge offered deals to the Red Lake Band of
Chippewa and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior
Chippewa for their support in routing the pipeline
through tribal lands.284 (Red Lake said no, and the Fond
du Lac Band accepted.) “There has been an attempt
[by Enbridge] to divide us, and to an extent it has,” Sam
Strong, Red Lake’s tribal secretary, told the Star Tribune.
“It’s very negative, and it is their playbook.” In addition
to a jobs package working on Line 3, Enbridge’s offer to
Red Lake included more than $1 million for community

projects, including $500,000 to rebuild the tribe’s
Ponemah Pow Wow Grounds, and an offer to arrange
a $25 million solar energy project that would be partly
owned by Red Lake. The Fond du Luc deal was not made
public, but in January 2021, the band sent a letter to
members saying this year’s $400 monthly per-capita
payments would be made “using Enbridge funds.” In a
2017 deal, Enbridge offered payments totaling around
$60 million over 25 years to the Lac Courte Oreilles
Band of Lake Superior Chippewa for a new long-term
easement for two Enbridge pipelines.285

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY 20 23  |  46

LINE 3Corporations like Enbridge might use donations as a
strategy to shore up support and protect their assets.
Through its “Safe Communities” program that began
in 2013, Enbridge provides monetary support to law
enforcement and first responder organizations under
the cover of philanthropy.286 In 2022, Enbridge touted
spending $100,000 in a carbon offset tree-planting
program that it claimed would help landowners.287 But
tar sands oil extraction has a direct and potentially
irreparable impact on Canada’s boreal forests: between

2000 and 2014, the industry contributed to nearly two
million acres of forest loss or degradation.288

As a condition for Line 3’s permit approval, Enbridge
paid more than $8.6 million into a state-managed
escrow account that was used to fund the state’s
response to pipeline protests.289 Further details of this
arrangement are discussed in the “Sanctioning Hostile
Policing” section below.

tactIc #1. Pushing for Boosted Penalties For Protesters

After Line 3’s approval on November 30, 2020, many
Indigenous water protectors and allied activists found
themselves with no choice but to put their bodies on the
line. There was an immediate upswing in protest and
direct action around the state.290 Minnesota legislators
opposed to the movement’s tactics would soon
introduce a new batch of “critical infrastructure” bills.
The bills bore similarities to ALEC’s model legislation
but notably went even further. One bill, HF 129 (2021-
2022), deemed the “Guilt-by-association anti-protest
bill” by the ACLU of Minnesota, would have created civil
and criminal liability for anyone who “intentionally
recruits, trains, aids, advises, hires, counsels, or
conspires with” someone to trespass.291 In certain cases
of property damage, the criminal penalties would have
ranged up to $20,000 and 10 years in prison. According
to ICNL, “the broad language could be construed to
include aiding a protester by providing them with water
or medical assistance.”292 Another of the bills, SF 355
(2021-2022), would have created a felony offense with
penalties of up to three years in prison and $5,000 in
fines for trespassing on critical infrastructure in cases
without actual property damage, but rather with the
intent to “damage, destroy, or tamper with equipment,
or significantly impede or inhibit operation.” Unlike
similar legislation previously attempted in the state,
these bills did not pass Minnesota’s House or Senate
because of organized local opposition and the sponsors
did not have the votes in the legislature. But, not to be
dissuaded—and despite Line 3 becoming operational—
two of the bill’s sponsors, Rep. Paul Novotny and Sen.
Warren Limmer, tried again in the 2023-24 session.

2021 was not Minnesota’s first brush with anti-protest
legislation. Four critical infrastructure bills were
introduced in the 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 sessions.
Only the first bill, SF 3463 (2017-2018), passed both
the House and Senate, which were controlled by
Republicans at the time, but was vetoed by then-
Governor Mark Dayton.293 In a study of these earlier
bills, the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) notes that
Pat Garofalo, one of the sponsors of the first bill, was
the ALEC State Chair for Minnesota.294 IPS found that
other bill sponsors had received political donations
from Enbridge-connected lobbyists, Dorsey & Whitney
LLP—a law firm representing parties that testified in
favor of Line 3—the Northwest Petroleum PAC, and the
Flint Hills Refinery PAC.295 Representative Matt Grossell,
who has cosponsored six anti-protest bills since 2017,
claimed that the Line 3 pipeline was “under attack by
eco-terrorists.”296

Minnesota does not require lobbyists to disclose
positions taken on specific bills, but several are known
to have testified in favor of anti-protest bills in legislative
committee hearings, including lobbyists for the
Minnesota Chamber of Commerce (2018) and Marathon
Petroleum (2019 and 2020).297 Moreover, Enbridge and
prospective Line 3 shippers Marathon Petroleum and
Koch Industries are among the top five companies
that have directed the most resources to lobbying for
fossil fuel anti-protest legislation across the country (as
described in the country-wide ranking in this report’s
Introduction).

LINE 3tactIc #2. Using Public Relations and Astroturfing to
Shift Public Opinion

The construction of Line 3 benefited from a wide range of
public relations tactics that appeared to be intended to
distract Minnesotans from the environmental and anti-
Indigenous issues at hand through openly hostile rhetoric
or veiled messaging. Enbridge worked with PR front groups
to generate support for Line 3. According to the Canadian
climate change media outlet, DeSmog:

“Minnesotans for Line 3, a group established

last year to advocate for an Enbridge oil

pipeline project, presents itself as a grassroots

organization consisting of “thousands of

members.” But a DeSmog investigation has

found that behind the scenes, the Calgary-based

energy giant is pulling the strings. Enbridge

has provided the group with funding, public

relations, and a variety of advocacy tactics.

The investigation has also found that a public

relations firm behind the operation recently
tried to erase its ties to Enbridge.”298

The group’s spending was so high that they ranked as
the tenth largest Facebook ad purchaser among special
interest groups between November 2018 and April 2019.

Its Facebook campaign likely produced more than 20
million impressions.299 Three Enbridge executives were
listed on the filings for Minnesotans for Line 3 TV ads
and one of the ads was placed by Velocity Public Affairs,
a group whose principal represented Enbridge as a
lobbyist for years, according to DeSmog’s investigation.

Even without resorting to the level of vitriol that became
so prevalent in North Dakota, Minnesotans for Line 3
portrayed activists and water protectors as outsiders with
backward values, ignoring the fact that Indigenous water
protectors at the forefront of the movement have long-
standing ties, predating European colonialism, to the land,
water, and wild rice that is threatened by Enbridge.300

The “Respect Minnesota” campaign used similar appeals
to politeness to nudge potential sympathizers away
from the Line 3 opposition movement. The tagline was
trademarked by Velocity Public Affairs in 2019, the same
company listed behind a Minnesotans for Line 3 ad.301 In
2017, the Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA), a fossil fuel-
funded astroturfing group, created a campaign titled
“Modernizing America” that ran two TV ads in Minnesota
in support of the pipeline.302 CEA’s member groups
include Koch and Enbridge, although its website depicts
the CEA as a consumer group advocating for “working
families, seniors, and small businesses.”303

LINE 3tactIc #3. Sanctioning Hostile Policing

Public-Private Security Coordination
and Protester Surveillance
In a series of articles for the Intercept, Alleen Brown
and Will Parish revealed years of close coordination
between Enbridge’s security forces and state and
local law enforcement in Minnesota and Wisconsin to
prepare for and respond to Line 3 protests. In 2017,
as protesters were arrested in Wisconsin for delaying
construction, the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office was
in regular contact with Raven Executive and Security
Services and Securitas, two private contractors hired
by Enbridge. Law enforcement agents in Wisconsin
and Minnesota, and Enbridge’s hired security
contractors, circulated and exchanged information
about the pipeline opposition movement and specific
activists, such as Winona LaDuke.304

Public-private security coordination intensified in the
year and a half leading up to Line 3’s construction
phase in Minnesota.305 In 2020, more than a dozen
Enbridge employees participated in joint training
sessions with an FBI agent and local sheriffs along
the pipeline route. Law enforcement agents from the
so-called “Northern Lights Taskforce”—a Minnesota
group of sheriffs and public safety officials—
sometimes requested Enbridge’s intelligence support
and participation in meetings. Law enforcement
also shared information with Enbridge including,
in one known case, the attendee list for an anti-
pipeline organizing meeting. As construction started
in late 2020, these public-private meetings were
occurring daily.306 Drones and ground vehicles,
some belonging to private security, were used to
monitor activism, but exact details of the surveillance
operation remain unclear because, in August 2021,
the agency responsible for the Minnesota Fusion
Center enacted an unprecedented policy that barred
the release of Line 3-related records that would detail
law enforcement’s use of surveillance, among other
tactics.307

Forceful Tactics to Suppress Protest
Law enforcement used mass arrests and increasingly
forceful tactics to suppress the Line 3 protests. As
detailed in the timeline of this section, demonstrators
reported enduring low-flying helicopters, rubber
bullets, pepper spray, and pain compliance torture
between June and August 2021 while opposing pipeline
construction. These protest-suppressing tactics were
dangerous. In 2020, the previous year, low-flying
helicopters were used to intimidate Black Lives Matter
protesters in Washington D.C., in a widely-publicized
incident that led to disciplinary action against a number
of the individuals involved.308 Christopher Harmer, a
veteran military helicopter pilot and writer for the Drive,
called the tactic a “show of force” that endangers both
protesters on the ground and the flight crew.309 Rubber
bullets used against protesters in other instances have
caused serious injury or death. Moreover, after being
arrested, some demonstrators reported mistreatment
from officers such as lack of proper food, solitary
confinement, and denial of medications.310

Minnesota state and local law enforcement may have
picked up some of their tactics from the police response
to the Standing Rock protests. In 2017 and 2018, local
law enforcement participated in a training session from
the former Disaster Recovery Chief for the North Dakota
Department of Emergency Services and three training
sessions from members of the Cass County Sheriff’s
Office.311 In December 2020, the intelligence coordinator
for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent out
a Standing Rock After-Action Report from the North
Dakota Department of Emergency Services, calling it
“the best document I’ve read in 10 years of working
for the state!”312 According to Alleen Brown, the report
contained “not a lot of reflection, actually, around the
use of tactics like water hoses in below-freezing weather.
There was more reflection on how to better utilize drone
footage, or how to win information battles. So I don’t
know that the lessons learned were that violent tactics
need to be avoided. But it was more like: How do we
look better?”313

LINE 3Sponsored By Enbridge
Dozens of agencies who responded to the Line 3 protests
were reimbursed for wages, planning costs, equipment,
and other expenses using Enbridge funds via a state-
managed escrow account. The financial arrangement
may have encouraged law enforcement agencies to
invest more aggressively in their suppressive and overly-
broad protest response. These concerns are backed up
by spending totals that were calculated by reporters
from Grist and the Center for Media and Democracy
using public records.314

The Enbridge-funded escrow account was used to pay for
wages and overtime for public officials to attend Northern
Lights Taskforce meetings, which also involved Line 3
security personnel. Moreover, the account was used to
reimburse $700,000 worth of riot gear purchases, including
over $260,000 worth of gas masks and attachments.

Through the escrow account, Enbridge funds were
used to reimburse over $79,000 worth of expenses
accrued in just one day: June 7, 2021, the day protesters
were showered with debris caused by a low-flying
helicopter. The Enbridge-funded account was also used
to reimburse “proactive” safety patrols, which may have
been used to surveil water protectors and demonstrate
an intimidating police presence along the pipeline route.
Police and sheriffs’ offices overall received at least $5.8
million funds from the account. Another $2.17 million
went to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

Spending totals also reveal the troubling incidence of
pipeline-related human trafficking and sexual violence.
Nearly a quarter of a million dollars were paid to state
agencies and nonprofits responding to these issues. At
least four Line 3 workers were reportedly arrested in sex
trafficking stings.315

Around 1,000 water protectors were arrested for Line 3
protest-related activities between 2021 and 2022. Over
700 faced criminal charges for their protests, and nearly
100 were threatened with felony charges.316 In November
of 2021, Honor the Earth launched the Drop the Charges
campaign asking politicians to support dismissing
the charges against water protectors who fought for
the environment and in defense of treaty rights. The
campaign cited “dozens of highly questionable felonies”
such as “attempted assisted suicide” for demonstrators
who entered empty pipes during a non-violent
blockade.317 Threatening protesters with such felonies
can be a retaliation tactic intended to stifle dissent.
In 2023, all of the remaining charges against three
Indigenous women leaders, including Winona LaDuke,
were dropped by District Court Judge Leslie Metzen.

Metzen wrote in her decision:

In the interests of justice the charges against

these three individuals who were exercising

their rights to free speech and to freely express

their spiritual beliefs should be dismissed. To
criminalize their behavior would be the crime.318

LINE 32023 AND THE ROAD AHEAD

The world has witnessed a worrisome decline of democracy.319 This has direct implications

on forestalling the climate crisis, since one of the formidable challenges to keeping global

greenhouse gas emissions within Paris-aligned targets is making governments act to halt and

reverse the expansion of one of the world’s most powerful industries. Indeed, many countries

with the largest remaining fossil fuel reserves are governed by autocratic regimes whose power

is heavily if not entirely dependent on continued fossil fuel production.320 In such contexts,

protest and dissent are often met with brutally oppressive force.

The reality of this global situation also means that
those who live in countries with robust civil societies,
global influence, and abundant fossil fuel reserves
must take on greater global responsibility for phasing
out fossil fuels and protecting human rights. Many
of us, especially those of us living in the U.S., bear
the additional responsibility of living in a society
whose relative affluence (for many) was built upon
a disproportionate contribution to the blanket of
atmospheric carbon that poses existential threats to
human wellbeing and a healthy planet.321

Yet the U.S. is not immune from threats to democracy,
despite possessing legal and political accountability
mechanisms that set it apart from autocracies. To the
contrary, recent events—ranging from the continued
spread of anti-protest laws to the police response to
Stop Cop City protests—have severely undermined
the right to free speech, a fundamental principle of
American democracy. What ties many of the examples in
this report together is a dangerous pattern of escalation
whereby activists—and nonactivists exercising their

right to dissent—are treated as criminals and extremists,
a pattern that the fossil fuel industry has promoted. The
examples throughout this report also demonstrate how
the very potency of the U.S. legal system has resulted
in a situation where undemocratic actors often seek to
capture and exploit it. Our legal system should protect
all of us, but fossil fuel companies have sought to
weaken or control it for private gain.

The combination of rhetorical attacks, protest
criminalization, and hostile law enforcement toward
protesters has continued into 2023. This section
continues below with an overview of anti-protest laws
that have been enacted in 2023 and a review of how
counterterrorism powers have been weaponized to
suppress protest opposing the construction of the
Atlanta Public Safety Training Center popularly known
as “Cop City.” It concludes with an overview of the
growing use of costly lawsuits and anti-protest laws to

Overview of 2023 Anti-Protest Bills

So far in 2023, 23 anti-protest bills have been introduced
in 15 states.322 Out of these, six bills in five states have
been enacted into law.323

Four States Have Enacted Fossil Fuel
Anti-Protest Laws
The fossil fuel and energy industries, and ALEC, have
continued to advocate for fossil fuel anti-protest laws.324
Four such laws have been enacted so far in 2023,
including three with narrowed provisions.

Between January and February, lawmakers in North
Carolina, Utah, and Oregon introduced sweeping fossil
fuel anti-protest bills with draconian penalties for
trespassing upon, impeding, and/or disrupting energy
infrastructure. However, the bills in each of these states,
except North Carolina, were substantially narrowed
during the legislative process. In Georgia, lawmakers
introduced a narrowed version of fossil fuel anti-protest
legislation by substitute, which was enacted with only
minor amendments. Each law is summarized below:

	| North Carolina’s enacted law (S 58) is particularly

extreme. It carries felony penalties with up to 19 years
imprisonment and $250,000 in fines for attempting
to “obstruct, impede, or impair the services of
transmissions of an energy facility.”325 Under the new
law, trespassing on energy facilities is also classified
as a felony with up to two years in prison. The bill
was primarily sponsored by Sen. Paul Newton, who
worked at Duke Energy for 25 years and was the
company’s state president.326

	| Georgia’s enacted law (HB 227) carries felony penalties

with between two and 20 years imprisonment for
interfering “by either force or violence or by electronic
means [...] with the proper operation of any critical
infrastructure.”327 The law also carries a misdemeanor
penalty for the vague offense of “interfer[ing] with the
proper action of a company, municipality, or political
subdivision owning critical infrastructure.” The bill
was supported by lobbyists for the Georgia Chamber
of Commerce and Georgia Power, a Southern
Company subsidiary.328 Members of the Georgia
Chamber of Commerce include Koch Industries,
Marathon Petroleum, Georgia Power, and NextEra.

	| As introduced, Utah’s anti-protest bill (HB 370) would
have made “inhibiting or impeding the operation
of a critical infrastructure facility” a first degree
felony punishable by five years to life in prison.329
The amended and enacted version criminalizes such
conduct only if doing so causes “widespread injury or
damage to persons or property.” The original version
of the bill had a very broad definition of critical
infrastructure that included highways, bridges, and
transportation systems, but these were removed
in the enacted version. Energy industry lobbyists
supported the bill before it was narrowed, including
Dominion Energy and Rocky Mountain Power.330

	| As introduced, Oregon’s anti-protest bill (HB 2772)
would have created a domestic terrorism crime for
attempting to cause “disruption of daily life” that
“severely affects the population, infrastructure,
environment, or government function of the
state.”331 The amended and enacted version creates a
domestic terrorism crime for attempting to destroy or
substantially damage critical infrastructure, including
pipelines and roads, with the intent to cause the
widespread disruption of services provided by such
infrastructure. No private sector interest groups testified
in favor of the bill, so it is unclear who supported it.

Although the narrowed laws enacted in Utah, Oregon,
and Georgia use language that appears to preclude
peaceful protest, they could still open the door for
aggressive prosecutorial tactics intended to punish
peaceful protest. For example, protesters obstructing
the expansion of a gas pipeline could be charged
under Georgia’s law if the prosecutor interprets their
activity as interfering “by force” in the pipeline’s proper
operation. Likewise, protesters could be charged under
Oregon’s law if the prosecutor deems that the protesters
attempted to substantially damage the pipeline with
“intent” to cause widespread disruption of services.
According to Jessica Maravilla, policy director from the
ACLU of Oregon, Oregon’s new law “targets conduct that
was already criminal, and adds a stigmatizing label and
vague language that could enable law enforcement to
mischaracterize protest actions as terrorist activity.”332

The newest purported justification for these bills is that
they are needed to deter electricity substation attacks.333

it was successfully blocked by a Mississippi Supreme
Court ruling on September 21.338

Versions of fossil fuel anti-protest bills were also
introduced, but have not been enacted into law, in
Idaho, Illinois, and Minnesota. Idaho’s bills, like the
original version of Utah HB 370, would include bridges,
highways, and other transportation infrastructure in its
definition of critical infrastructure.334

New Laws Undermine Local Governance
and Threaten Free Speech in the Majority-
Black City of Jackson, Mississippi After
Decades of Neglected Infrastructure Left
Thousands Without Water
Two 2023 Mississippi laws (HB 1020 and SB 2343) create
a “separate and unequal” policing and court structure
in the majority-Black city of Jackson, according to a
lawsuit filed by the NAACP, after a massive water system
failure left thousands of residents without drinking
water for a month.335 These laws were introduced after
community groups, working with the city, started
planning for resident engagement initiatives and a
“just and equitable 21st-century water system.”336 The
laws contain an arsenal of measures, which include
expanding the Capitol Complex Improvement District
to bring the entire city of Jackson under control of the
state-run Capitol Police (SB 2343) and creating a new
court system for the district whose judge would be
appointed by the state instead of elected by voters (HB
2010).337 HB 2010 was called a “racist, unconstitutional

At the same time, SB 2343 prohibits Jackson residents from
engaging in peaceful protests near the Mississippi state
house and other government buildings without express
permission from state officials.339 The provision is so
sweeping that it applies to sidewalks immediately adjacent
to government buildings, as well as streets and other
locations that could “hinder ingress” to such buildings,
and does not include a minimum number of protesters.

North Carolina Has Enacted Heightened
Penalties For Activities Defined As
“Rioting”
According to the ACLU of North Carolina, a 2023 North
Carolina law (HB 40) “increases criminal penalties for
protesting and makes protestors liable for substantial civil
damages to individuals harmed by a protest, even where
a protestor only verbally encouraged activities defined
as “rioting” and did not take any individual actions to
cause injury or damage.”340 HB 40 became law in March
without Gov. Cooper’s signature due to the supermajority
held by Republicans and at least one Democrat who
supported the bill, which would have likely overrode a
veto.341 A similar bill, HB 805 (2021), was introduced after
the 2020 wave of Black Lives Matter protests and vetoed

about the veto: “[...] this legislation is unnecessary and is

2023 AND THE ROAD AHEADTerrorism Charges May Pose a Continued and Increasing Threat to Activists

Federal and state officials have repeatedly weaponized counterterrorism powers to suppress dissent. Doing
so can punish non-violent activists for their views and protect polluting interests. Among the most recent
targets of counterterrorism tactics have been activists who oppose the construction of the Atlanta Public
Safety Training Center.

Many Atlanta residents view the training center as a manifestation of police violence, racism, and
environmental injustice.343 Its construction requires razing one of Atlanta’s last remaining swaths of forest
in a predominantly Black neighborhood.344 Upon the facility’s completion, it could draw police forces
from around the country for active shooter simulations and other training sessions.345 A small minority of
demonstrators are alleged to have damaged property, but the overwhelming majority have not.

Nevertheless, Georgia authorities have clamped down upon protesters with authoritarian force. During a
forest raid in January 2023, police fatally shot the protester Manuel Esteban Paez Terán 57 times.346 The
Georgia Bureau of Law Enforcement has said that Terán fired at law enforcement first, but evidence from
DeKalb County’s official autopsy and body camera footage raises questions about the official account.347

In early 2023, police swept up more than 40 people in a pattern of seemingly indiscriminate and politically-
motivated “terrorism” arrests.348 As noted by the ACLU, “[t]he ‘Stop Cop City’ defendants are not accused of
injuring, or even attempting to injure, anyone at all. At most, they are accused of damaging property, and
some defendants appear to be accused of no more than misdemeanor trespass.”349 The charges were made
possible by a 2017 Georgia law that categorizes actions that disable or destroy so-called critical infrastructure
as domestic terrorism.350

Police have also raided two charities, the Lakewood Environmental Arts Foundation, which has been
operating community food drives since 2014, and the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, which was founded in 2016 to
raise money to pay protesters’ bail.351 Atlanta police justified the SWAT raids as a response to alleged “money
laundering” and “charity fraud”, but they have been widely viewed as political persecution.352 Soon after
the Atlanta Solidarity Fund raid, leaked audio surfaced of police allegedly suggesting that the arrests were
politically-timed and intended to “send a message.”353

Georgia authorities escalated their sweeping assault on protest and dissent once more in September 2023,
when state Attorney General Chris Carr indicted more than 60 individuals—including organizers from the
Atlanta Solidarity Fund—on RICO charges.354 These charges dangerously, and absurdly, mischaracterize
anyone who showed opposition to the training center as part of a criminal enterprise. The indictment
characterizes First Amendment-protected activities, such as writing “ACAB” and making zines, as “overt acts
in furtherance of the racketeering conspiracy.” According to Lauren Regan, executive director of the Civil
Liberties Defense Center, the indictment is “clearly intended to chill larger political participation.”355

While it’s been state and local officials carrying out the “Stop Cop City” arrests, protest suppression disguised
as counterterrorism is a country-wide issue. DHS shared intelligence reports with Atlanta Law Enforcement,
including one that referred to protesters as “militants” comprising a “violent far-left occupation” several
months before the first domestic terrorism charges were filed.356 And, in 2020, DHS took steps to “undermine
the Black Lives Matter movement and spin an election-season story of anarchy,” according to the Brennan
Center.357 Even the department’s own general counsel and inspector general concluded that DHS officials
have abused their counterterrorism power to suppress protest.358

The extreme police reaction to the Cop City protests reflects a disturbing country-wide trend of militarized
policing against peaceful protest.359 The influx of battlefield equipment and tactics to police departments
foments potentially deadly violence, as well as framing demonstrators as “opponents” that should be forcibly
suppressed and whose concerns are illegitimate.360 The rhetorical framing of activists as domestic terrorists
and extremists also contributes to an environment where protesters are more likely to be met with force.361

2023 AND THE ROAD AHEADGrowing Protest Criminalization Around the World

Around the world, those who seek to protect the environ-
ment face a barrage of threats ranging from online harass-
ment to brutal attacks. At least 1,390 land and environ-
mental defenders have been murdered since the adoption
of the Paris Agreement on December 15, 2015.362 Ending
this tragic and unequal pattern of violence is essential.

Less lethal affronts to activism can still have profoundly
negative effects. As a result of criminalization and
judicial harassment (such as SLAPPs), individuals can be
saddled with legal fees, prevented from earning a stable
living, socially stigmatized, and displaced. Organizations
can be bankrupted, ruptured, or forcibly dissolved.
Criminalization and judicial harassment also threaten
to chill free speech and dissent. Such fundamental
rights are becoming ever more essential, as it becomes
increasingly urgent to confront governments and private
corporations about their inaction in the face of the ever-
worsening climate crisis.

There is evidence of worsening protest criminalization
in many parts of the world.363 Although there are many
differences in the ways that governments criminalize
protest, the framing of activists as terrorists or extremists
who threaten a country’s development is a common
trend.364 Another similarity is the misuse and abuse of
counterterrorism frameworks.365 Two notable examples
of this pattern are Mohad Gasmi, an Algerian activist
who joined the anti-shale gas drilling movement in 2015,
and Disha Ravi, an Indian youth climate activist. Gasmi
was sentenced to five years imprisonment for “praising
terrorism” in October 2021, after 490 days’ detainment,
and additionally sentenced to three years imprisonment
in April 2022.366 Ravi was arrested under a sedition law
in February 2021 for distributing a Google Doc “tool kit”
intended to support the Indian farmers’ protests.367 She
was detained for ten days and released on bail.368

The fossil fuel industry and its allies have contributed
to a worldwide spread of fossil fuel anti-protest laws.
In 2022, the UK government enacted a law intended to
target Extinction Rebellion protests that was drafted
by Policy Exchange, a British think tank funded by
Exxon and other oil and energy companies.369 Policy
Exchange is one of more than 500 member think tanks
in nearly one hundred countries belonging to the Atlas

Network, an influential global network that has spent
decades pushing for environmental activists to be
viewed and treated like extremist criminals.370 State
governments across Australia have passed anti-protest
laws that target climate and environmental protesters.371
Days before the most recent law was passed in South
Australia, the state mining and energy minister, Tom
Koutsantonis, told the audience at a gas conference
that the state government was “at your disposal.”372
Alberta, Canada enacted a law officially known as the
“Critical Infrastructure Defense Act” in 2020 that was
widely viewed as a response to Indigenous-led peaceful
protests opposing the Coastal Gaslink Pipeline.373

Deep-pocketed corporations often weaponize the
court system by using SLAPPs to silence their critics.
More than 400 such lawsuits have been recorded
by the Business and Human Rights Resource Center
since January 2015, with the highest number of cases
occurring in Latin America, followed by Asia and the
Pacific.374 These suits may carry the potential for
enormous damages. But regardless of whether the
plaintiff wins or loses, defendants targeted for SLAPPs
almost always incur significant costs.

A broad coalition has begun organizing to defeat the
SLAPP strategy. Environmental groups, human rights
groups, legal experts, professional societies (especially
journalists), and progressive business groups all have a
stake in this issue—and many have been fighting against
SLAPPs for years. In the U.S., the Protect the Protest
coalition is fighting back against SLAPPs and offering
support to those who have been targeted by SLAPPs.
Similar coalitions have formed in Europe and Africa.375

Some governments have begun taking action.
Responding to reports documenting the intensifying
pattern of legal threats against investigative journalists
and civil society organizations, for instance, the U.S.
government (USAID) helped launch Reporters Shield
in 2022, a program to provide training, resources
and assistance to help reporters and news and other
organizations respond to legal threats.376 Strong anti-
SLAPP laws are an even better solution. In the U.S., 33
states have some degree of anti-SLAPP protection under
the law, but many are not as strong as they need to be.

2023 AND THE ROAD AHEADPOLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

None of the U.S.’s greatest social and political gains,
or its greatest advancements in public health and
environmental protection, have come about without
a struggle. Indeed, this recognition is what led to the
creation of Greenpeace 52 years ago by a small group of
activists who sought to defeat the existential threat of
nuclear annihilation.

Today, the fossil fuel industry’s intensified efforts to
suppress free speech stand in the way of a livable future
for billions of people and countless species at risk of
extinction this century.377 Activists and water protectors
who have stood firm against this hulking industry have too
often been met with violent reprisals, criminal penalties,
stigmatization, and iron-handed legal actions. However
insurmountable these obstacles might seem, it is still
possible—and, indeed, essential—to reclaim popular
protest and dissent for the long-held purpose of holding
the U.S. government accountable to its own promise of
delivering democracy and security to all Americans.

The following policies are necessary to reverse the
deterioration of civic space and advance the movement
for a healthy, socially just, and fossil-free future.

Take back our right to protest and dissent.

	| Pass anti-SLAPP laws on the state and federal level
aimed at protecting the rights of individuals to
speak truth to power and be free from threats of
burdensome lawsuits from corporations.378

	| Pass local, state, and federal resolutions affirming all

Americans’ right to protest, free from threats of invasive
surveillance, and physical and legal aggression.379

	| Challenge and repeal anti-protest laws, including fossil
fuel anti-protest laws that boost penalties for protest-
related activities near pipelines and other polluting
infrastructure.380 Challenge the overbroad use of
RICO against protesters and their supporters, which
dangerously conflates dissent with organized crime.

Reaffirm Indigenous sovereignty and provide
redress for human rights violations.

	| Federal, state, and local governments should honor

historical treaties with Tribal Nations.

	| Institutionalize free, prior, and informed consent to
require the consent of American Indian and Alaska
Native tribes and Indigenous peoples regarding
all governments’ actions affecting their lands,
livelihoods, culture, and spirituality.

	| Governments should provide redress for violating
the rights of all affected Tribal Nations as outlined
in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples.381

Strengthen the rights of communities to
defend themselves against the harms of the
fossil fuel industry.

	| Advance climate and environmental justice through
steps that include passing the Environmental Justice
for All Act, which strengthens consultation with
impacted communities, provides legal remedies
to civilians, and expands environmental justice
resources; and passing the Climate Equity Act,
which elevates climate justice to the highest level of
governance.382

	| End the use of Nationwide Permit 12 to permit oil and
gas infrastructure without robust opportunities for
community input.

	| Phase out fossil fuel production through steps

that include: banning new fossil fuel leasing and
permitting on public lands and waters, and phasing
out existing leases; strengthening “polluter pays”
requirements to ensure fossil fuel corporations pay
the full cost of remediation; and establishing one-
mile public health and safety buffer zones to prohibit
oil and gas production near where people live, work,
play, and learn.383

DOLLARS VS. DEMOCRACY 20 23  |  57

Prevent law enforcement from serving the
interests of the fossil fuel industry over the
interests of the general public.

	| End the use of sweeping intelligence-gathering

practices that target activism and dissent under the
cover of domestic terrorism prevention.384

	+ Implement minimization procedures that

prevent the intentional collection, retention,
and dissemination of private information when
there is no reasonable indication of criminal
activity; require that federal funds allocated to
state and local law enforcement not be used for
monitoring First Amendment-protected activities
in the context of activism and dissent; and
staunch the free flow of data exchanged between
fusion centers and the private sector.

	+ Investigate potential violations of constitutional
rights of activists and civil society organizations
by law enforcement authorities, private sector

representatives, and others in and apart
from fusion center operations and related
communications.385

	| Prohibit law enforcement authorities from

participating in arrangements that open the door
to conflicts of interest through steps that include:
passing state and federal laws regulating private
employment for off-duty law enforcement; and
prohibiting law enforcement authorities from
accepting reimbursements or donations from the
fossil fuel industry.386

	| Pass state and federal laws banning the use of injury-
prone tactics such as pain compliance, chemical
agents, blunt-force weapons, and kettling against
peaceful protesters.387

Help us fight for a Green Democracy!

These 18 states have enacted laws that boost penalties for: trespass
onto property containing critical infrastructure; activities defined as
impeding, obstructing, or interrupting the construction or operations of
critical infrastructure; or similar offenses (Oklahoma, Louisiana, North
Dakota, Indiana, Tennessee, Ohio, Texas, Missouri, Kentucky, Wisconsin,
West Virginia, South Dakota, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kansas, Montana,
Alabama, and North Carolina). See Supplementary Analysis: Fossil
Fuel Anti-Protest Laws and Barricaded Oil and Gas Production for an
explanation of each fossil fuel anti-protest law included in this count.

These four states have enacted laws that boost penalties for activities
that are construed as critical infrastructure “interference by force,”
“sabotage,” or similar offenses (Iowa, Oregon, Georgia, and Utah).
These narrowed laws appear to preclude peaceful protest but could
still be subject to abuse by prosecutors, if they seek to interpret certain
provisions broadly. For example, Georgia’s law carries a penalty of
between two and 20 years in prison for interfering by “force [...] with
the proper operation of any critical infrastructure,” but does not clearly
define the activities that fall under this provision. According to Jessica
Maravilla, Policy Director from ACLU of Oregon, Oregon’s law “targets
conduct that was already criminal, and adds a stigmatizing label and
vague language that could enable law enforcement to mischaracterize
protest actions as terrorist activity.” See Supplementary Analysis: Fossil
Fuel Anti-Protest Laws and Barricaded Oil and Gas Production for an
explanation of each fossil fuel anti-protest law included in this count.

In 1877, Congress abrogated the Ft. Laramie Treaties, and the Standing
Rock Sioux never relinquished their claims. Arguments went to the SCOTUS
in 1980, the court affirmed that the 1877 treaty constituted a taking of
Sioux land without just compensation, and granted the tribe $17.1 million
in damages, plus interest, since 1877. The Tribe has never collected the
money because acceptance would legally terminate the demand of the
return of their land. As of 2023, close to $1 billion sits untouched in the US

139  “A range of new police powers and criminal laws helped redefine lawful

and unlawful dissent, criminalising some forms of collective action while
promoting forms of collective action that do not threaten industrial
activity. This, in turn, allows the state to ‘continuously (re)draw . . . the
lines between legitimate and illegitimate, legal and illegal, good and
bad protest(ers). [...] Indeed, it is through the facilitation of the former
– on designated protest zones, stewarded by police liaison officers,
and for limited amounts of time – that state forces can criminalise and
‘delegitimise’, in the eyes of many, those protesters who pose a more
fundamental threat to mining operations and the state as a whole. This
very distinction is reproduced by, and feeds into stigmatisation of those
who protest [emphasis added]. They are deemed illegitimate or illegal,
framed as outsiders, outcast, undeserving, and a ‘cost’ on [...] society,
policing budgets, and the welfare state, and deserving of repression”

Minnesota believes or stands for. We have rules, processes, requirements
and a way of working together that is important. We recognize (and
welcome) there will be differences of opinion but share a collective
acceptance of what is good for the broader community and society [...]
As scared as some may rightfully be of these thuggish threats of violence,
we know the power of our collective communities coming together to
defend what makes Minnesota special is far stronger than any fear being
promoted by those who can’t get past their own opinions,” (June 8, 2018)
“While this is frustrating to see such blatant disrespect, it needs to be
acknowledged that our respectful support efforts have made just as much
of an impact and difference,” (June 6, 2019) “Instead of respecting the
process and the community, protestors instead trespassed and vandalized
equipment that has impacted a Native American construction company,”

319  According to the global civil society alliance CIVICUS, civil society “is
under severe attack in 117 of 197 countries and territories [...] up up
from 111 countries and territories in 2018” (People Power Under Attack
2022. CIVICUS Monitor. https://monitor.civicus.org/globalfindings/
(Accessed: October 3, 2023)). For country-specific reports see the ICNL
Civic Freedom Monitor.

320  A recent analysis found that just 10 countries account for three quarters
of the emissions potential of the 425 largest “carbon bombs” (proposed
or existing fossil fuel extraction projects accounting for over 1 gigaton
of potential CO2 emissions), including China (with 141), Russia (41), the
United States (28), Iran (24), Saudi Arabia (23.5), Australia (23), India (18),
Qatar (13), Canada (12) and Iraq (11). See Kühne, K. et al. 2022. “Carbon
Bombs” - Mapping key fossil fuel projects. Energy Policy, 166, p. 112950.
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.112950

321  According to a 2021 New York Times analysis using data from the

Global Carbon Project, the United States was responsible for 24.6%
of cumulative CO2 emissions released from fossil fuels and industry
over the past 170 years. Rich, developed countries, including the
US, Canada, Japan, and much of Western Europe, were responsible
for 50% of cumulative CO2 emissions and only 12% of the global
population (Popovich, N. & Plumer, B. 2021. Who Has The Most Historical
Responsibility for Climate Change? The New York Times, November 12.
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/12/climate/cop26-
emissions-compensation.html)

322  This count includes 22 bills tracked by the ICNL US Protest Law Tracker

plus Georgia HB 227, a fossil fuel anti-protest bill.

323  These enacted bills are Mississippi SB 2343, North Carolina HB 40, North
Carolina SB 58, Oregon HB 2772 (enacted with improvements), Utah
HB 370 (enacted with improvements), and Georgia HB 227. For legal
interpretation of the first five named bills, see the ICNL US Protest Law
Tracker

324  Out of the four fossil fuel anti-protest bills enacted in 2023, three

were backed by fossil fuel and energy industry lobbyists or primarily
sponsored by one of the industry’s revolving door officeholders.  In
December 2022, ALEC published a blogpost that recirculated the model

asking “they shoot their own man?” – supporting the possibility that
gunfire attributed to Terán was actually crossfire by another officer.

(Frontline Defenders: Global Analysis 2020. 2020. Frontline Defenders.

criminalization and victimization of land and environmental rights
defenders in East Africa were on the rise (Okuda, I. 2021. Paying the Price:
A Study on Criminalization of Land and Environmental Rights Defenders in
East Africa. Rights and Resources Initiative. https://doi.org/10.53892/
ZSEA6921) “Frontline Defenders: Global Analysis 2022” found that
human rights defenders in Asia, and in Europe and Central Asia, faced
“unprecedented” challenges. In Asia, these challenges were summarized
as including “legal persecution combined with misuse and abuse of anti-
terrorism frameworks and growing restrictions on the rights to privacy
and freedoms of expression, assembly and movement.” In Europe and
Central Asia, they were summarized as including “increasing violence,
racist and anti-refugee and migrant rhetoric, targeted attacks and
widespread criminalisation.” (Frontline Defenders: Global Analysis 2022.

always painted environmentalists and the regulations they seek to place
on polluting industries as a cancerous growth on society. [...] This kind
of rhetoric is exactly what we see today in countries moving swiftly to
criminalize environmental and climate protest. While of course industries
and governments around the world had plenty of their own reasons for
categorizing environmentalists and animal rights activists as extremists
and terrorists, Atlas Network think tanks have capitalized on that framing
for decades. In recent years, they’ve packaged it in ways that could be
turned into anti-protest legislation.”)
