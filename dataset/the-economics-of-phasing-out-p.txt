The Economics of Phasing Out PVC  
 1 
Executive Summary 
 
  
Factors  favori ng phaseout Polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC  or “vinyl,” 
has become one of the most widely used plastics 
today. We encounter PV C on a d aily basis in 
products ranging from toys, packagi ng, and lawn 
furnitu re to water an d sewer pipes, m edical 
equipment, and building materials.  
Figures such as those from Envi ronment Canada , 
based on curre nt market price s alone, overst ate the 
econom ic bene fits of PVC.  We exp lore fou r major 
econom ic reasons  why t his is the case .  
  • Life-cycle cost s often favor alternatives.  Some 
of the altern atives have higher initial pu rchase prices 
than PVC  produ cts, but are actu ally less expen sive 
over the useful  life of the  product. Comm ercial 
flooring provides an  exam ple: among t he flooring 
options we ex amin ed, vinyl has th e lowest i nstalled  
cost; bu t due to its sho rter lifeti me and higher 
maintenance requirements, it has t he highest life-
cycle cost. In such cases, rat her tha n making a 
decision  based on initial co sts alone, purch asers can  
save m oney  by com paring the full costs over the 
product life cycle of buying, installing, using, 
main taining, and ultimately disposing of altern ative 
products.  PVC  poses haz ards to human health over the course 
of its life cycle. PVC pro duction expo ses work ers and  
communities t o vinyl chloride and  other toxic 
substances. PVC products such as medical equi pment 
and childre n’s toys can leach  toxic additives during 
their useful life. Vi nyl building materials release 
hydrochloric acid  fumes if they catch  fire, an d 
burning PVC creates by products including dioxin, a 
potent carci nogen.  
 
The health haz ards associated with  the productio n, 
use, and disposal of PVC are, for the most part, 
avoidable. Alte rnatives  are available across t he range 
of PVC products. In  some cases the alternatives a re 
no m ore expe nsive tha n PVC;  in other cases  there is a  
small additional cost. Often  there are goo d reason s to 
expect the costs of altern atives to declin e over tim e.   
• Mass production reduces  costs. Most products 
are c heaper when they a re produce d in large 
quantities; co sts typ ically d rop as produ ction  volumes 
increase. Curre ntly the adva ntages of mass 
production favor PVC : many PVC  products have  
achieved huge volumes, making them look cheap 
today. However, the altern atives to  PVC cou ld 
likewise grow in volume in the fu ture, m aking them 
less exp ensive and more co mpetitiv e than they are at 
prese nt.   
Vinyl today: a look at the ma rket  
 
PVC sales reach ed 14.4 billion  pounds in th e US and  
Canada in 2002, or 46 pounds per person. Worldwide 
production was around 59 billion pounds, or an 
avera ge of 9 pounds per  person. With 5 per cent of the 
world’s population, the US a nd Canada  consume 24 
perce nt of the wo rld’s PVC. The pri ncipal uses of 
PVC in North America, in order of im porta nce, a re 
pipes, construction m aterials, con sumer goods, 
packa ging, and electrical pr oducts (suc h as wire and 
cable insulation ).  
• PVC  products endanger their users . The 
harm ful ef fects  of PVC are someti mes felt by th e 
users  of the product, as in the case of some PVC  
medical supplies. In case of fi re, vi nyl building 
products begin to smolder long before they burn, 
releasing toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid, and 
thereby threatening building occupa nts and 
firefi ghter s. Fo r this reas on, the Inter national 
Association of Firefig hters supports efforts to reduce 
PVC use.    
Three in-d epth stud ies have estimated the costs o f 
phasing out PVC. The latest one, a 1997 study by 
Environment Canada , based on a detailed analysis of 
the cost of altern atives, suggests an a verage annual 
cost of $0.55 per pound. If t his esti mate stil l applied 
today, it would imply a to tal co st of $8 billion per 
year, or $25 per person, to phase ou t PVC in th e US 
and Can ada. Correctio n for one obviously dated  
assumption in th at stud y cuts the estim ate in  half, to  
$4 billion total or $12 per person. Howev er, there are 
several reasons to expect t hat the costs of alt ernatives  
will b e still lower and  will declin e over time.   
Related  hazards cou ld occur with PVC-i nsulated  
wiring, which was once standar d for use in airplanes. 
There is no proof that PV C insulation has  ever ca used 
a plane crash, but some investigators have suggested 
that there  are grounds  for concer n abou t older planes 
that are still flyin g with PVC -insulated  wires.

• Environment al protectio n cos ts are r outinely  
less th an anticipated. Academic researc h has shown 
that the act ual costs of compliance with 
environmental standa rds are often lower than the 
predicted c osts. The stri ct sta ndard for workplace 
exposure to vinyl chlo ride, the raw material for PVC 
production, estab lished in 1974  by the Occupatio nal 
Safet y and Health Administration, led to profitable 
innovation, not vast economic losses (as predicted by 
industry whe n the standa rd was propose d). A recent 
study of the costs o f controlling chlorinated 
pollutants confirm s the pattern of advance 
overestimation of environmental managem ent costs.  
 
Mar kets for alternatives   
 
Because PVC i s used in such a dive rse range of 
products, th e nature of the altern atives and  the likely 
costs of a phaseout differ from one m arket to the 
next. Howeve r, there  are affordable altern atives in 
every market we have  exam ined. We discus s 
altern atives to PVC in selected  commercial an d 
institutional mark ets, in cluding pipes, roofing, floor 
cove rings, and medical gloves, followed by a brief 
look at resid ential sid ing and wind ows, th e larg est-
volume vinyl building products. 
 
• Pipes.  Almost half of the PVC manufact ured in 
the US and Canada  is used to make pi pes a nd tubing, 
a diverse cat egory spanning several  distinct end uses. 
For municipal water and sewer pipes, PVC competes 
with traditional materials in cluding iron, concrete, 
and vitrified  clay, as well as with polyethyl ene (PE ), 
a less toxic plastic that has a growing share of the 
market.  Sales of PE pipe (for all uses ) have  reache d 
about one billion pou nds annu ally, co mpared to 6.5 
billion pounds of PVC  pipe. PE and  traditional p ipe 
materials p erform  better th an PVC in co ld climates 
and under high pressure; in addition, PE pipe is 
virtually leak-free.  Factors li ke the se are  often 
decisiv e; many municipalities  and water co mpanies 
make decision s based on the desir ed physical 
properties of pi pes rat her than the difference s in 
material prices. 
 
Inside bui ldings, PVC has bec ome common for 
electrical conduits and particularly fo r the 
“drai n/waste/vent” pi pes that carry water a nd waste 
away. Due to conce rns about fire hazards, s ome 
building cod es limit th e use of plastic p ipe in multi-
story buildings; ev en wh ere it is allo wed, the 
additional requirem ents for firep roofing offset much 
of the apparent cost advantage of PVC pipe.  
 
A case stud y in Au stin, Tex as, found that using 
copper, cast  iron, and polyethylene pl umbing rather than PVC  throughout a larg e new bu ilding increased  
plumbing costs by 15 percent over all. Costs for 
small-diameter pipes of several varieties show 
modest cost di ffere nces; P VC has the lowest installed 
cost in so me but not all ap plicatio ns.  
 
• Roofing. In roofing , PVC competes p rimarily 
with two less to xic synthetic materials, eth ylene 
propylene diene monom er (E PDM ) and thermoplastic 
elastom er poly olefin (TPO), in the market f or single-
ply (single-layer), low-slope roofs. EPDM is by far 
the market leader  among t he three, and PVC  is third 
in sales volume, slightly behi nd TPO. Advantages 
claim ed for PVC, pa rticularly the fact t hat it is 
availab le in white an d therefore provides good  
reflectiv ity in  hot weath er, are equ ally av ailab le with 
altern ative materials. PVC roofing also has  a shorter 
lifetim e than most alternati ves and prese nts special 
technical probl ems, suc h as cracking a nd los s of 
flexibility u nder some circu mstances.  
 
An analysis o f constru ction costs in Austin, Texas 
shows that both of the alternatives ha ve lower 
installed  costs than PVC . This is tru e for a range of 
membrane t hicknesses a nd modes of installation. 
These c ost relationships are echoed by data from 
Chicago and western M assachusetts, supporting the 
view t hat the  differe nces a re not specific t o one 
region or climate.  
 
• Flooring. For co mmercial an d institutional 
flooring, PVC competes with  a variety of m aterials, 
ranging from natural co rk and trad itional lino leum to 
econ omical synt hetic rubber products, and new non-
chlorin ated po lymers that match the loo k of vinyl. 
While vinyl flooring has the lowest first cost among 
the 12 flooring produ cts we ex amined, its relativ ely 
short lifetim e and high maintenance requ iremen ts 
outweigh  this advantage; it is t he most exp ensive 
option on a life -cycle basis. An a nalysis by t he US 
Navy  of two flooring options for high-traffic areas o n 
its sh ips reach ed the sam e conclusion: on a life-cycle 
basis vinyl was far more ex pensive than Stratica, a 
durable new polymer. “G reen building” efforts have 
often used linoleum floors as a nat ural, non-toxic 
altern ative to vin yl, as seen  in ou r case st udies; 
linoleum  and other m aterials provide viable 
alternatives to vinyl flooring under many 
circum stances. 
 
• Gloves . A vari ety of disposable medical 
supplies ca n be made from  PVC. We exam ine the 
case of m edical gloves. Late x, wh ich fo r a lon g time 
was t he standa rd material  of choi ce for medical 
exam ination and s urgical gl oves, has c ome to pose a  
serious health hazard with ris ing rates of latex

Steps  toward safer  alternati ves  allerg ies. In this context, health care in stitutions must 
move to alternativ e glove materials; PVC and  nitrile 
are the  princi pal candi dates. Whi le PVC gloves are 
cheape r than ni trile gloves, their lower price is 
counterbalanced by their lower durability. On e study 
found PV C gloves to have a 30% failure rate un der 
simulated  use conditions, compared to 2% for b oth 
latex  and nitrile.  C orrectio n for the failure rate 
offsets one-third of the apparent cost advantage of 
PVC  over nitrile gloves, based on prices qu oted to us 
by a leadi ng distribut or. Kaiser Pe rmanente, the 
nation’s larg est not-for-p rofit health  care 
organization, concluded from its internal review that 
nitrile g loves were co st-competitive with PVC du e to 
their greater durab ility, and bought 43 million pairs 
of nitrile g loves.  
Around the world and through out the US, a variety of  
community, st ate, and  national g overnment initiativ es 
have  been undertaken to promote the use of safer 
altern atives to PVC. Man y health care i nstitutions 
have  made statements on the need  to reduce  or 
eliminate PVC  use. The auto industry a nd other 
major industries have taken numerous steps to 
incorpo rate altern atives to PVC in to their produ cts. In 
addition, coun tless in novative con struction proj ects 
have demonstrated  the practicality o f reducing or 
eliminating PVC use. Examples di scussed here 
include a green bu ilding initiativ e carried  out by a 
volunteer group, Gr eenHOM E, in partnership with 
Habitat fo r Human ity; th e Erie Ellin gton Homes in  
the Dorchest er neighborhood of Boston; the Sheraton 
Ritten house Squ are Ho tel in  Philadelphia; and  
innovative projects b y relig ious communities.   
• Siding and wind ows. Vinyl is now the most 
common si ding material for l ow- and moderate-
priced housing. Howeve r, wood shingles or 
clapboard als o offer via ble siding alternatives , as do 
fiber cem ent and sim ulated stucco. Disadva ntages  to 
vinyl siding include poor resistance t o temperature, 
vulnerability to water dam age, and c hemical hazards 
when it burns or smolders. Despite claims that vinyl 
is “m aintenanc e free,” vinyl c an fade with time, can 
require painti ng, a nd can warp. Fiber cem ent, a 
relatively new  product, is more durable than vinyl 
and alm ost as low-m aintenance; moreove r, fiber 
cement does not warp or burn. 
 
Altern atives to PVC windo ws in clude wood , 
fiberglass, and aluminum windows. Problems with 
vinyl windows in clude sen sitivity to  high and low 
temperatures, possible brittle ness, and health hazards 
in case of fire. Vinyl windows can be energy 
efficient, but they can e xpand and contract, causing 
the seal of the window t o break; in t his case , they 
cann ot be repai red, and must be replaced.  
 
Employment  effec ts of a PVC phaseout  
 
There are 126 ,000 workers in PVC fabricatio n plants 
in the US; we estimate that there are no  more than 
9,000 workers making vinyl chloride and PVC resin. 
Replacing PVC with  safer altern atives will ch ange 
some of these jobs: from fabricating PVC products to 
fabricating the same prod ucts from other m aterials, 
most often other plastics; or from making vinyl 
chlorid e and PVC resi n to making safer sub stitutes. 
Howev er, the altern atives are likely to  require abo ut 
the sam e total employment as produ ction of PVC. In 
some cases, the sam e workers who currentl y make 
PVC products will b e employed making products 
from PVC altern atives.

Introduction 
 
 
Why Worry About PVC? PVC disp osal and accide ntal burnin g: When vi nyl 
buildi ng materials catch fi re—or eve n smolder, 
before ign iting—th ey release acutely to xic fumes 
such as hydrochloric acid.12 At the end  of its life, 
PVC  releases t oxic substances into the environment 
when it is burned in an in cinerator or rural trash  
barrel, a nd can leach toxic sta bilizers and plasticizers 
when it is buried in a landfill. Diox ins, which 
threaten hu man health  at ex traordinarily lo w 
conce ntrations , are released when PVC is burned, 
either inte ntionally or accide ntally.13  
Polyvinyl chlorid e has grown fro m a little-k nown 
material in  the mid-twen tieth century (u sed by the 
Navy  for water proofing in World War II , for 
exam ple) to become one of the most widely used 
plastics to day.1 Thanks to low prices a nd aggressive 
marketing, polyvinyl ch loride, also kno wn as PV C or 
“vinyl,” has be come ubiquitous in our hom es and 
communities. We en coun ter PVC on a daily basis in 
products ranging from children's toys, pack aging, and 
lawn  furniture to water an d sewer p ipes, medical 
equipment, and building materials.  
In the face of these a nd relate d conce rns, vinyl 
advocates a rgue that the  material offers not only low 
prices but also amazing c onvenience. PVC prom ises 
to provide “m aintenanc e-free” building exteriors, 
easily installed pipes and plumbing, low-cost 
cove rings for floors and walls, and all manner of 
molded or flexib le plastic objects. It is widely 
believed that giving up PVC  would impose a painful 
burden on t he econom y.  
Unfortunately, PVC poses severe hazards to hum an 
health over the course  of its life cycle. We review 
these hazards only briefly he re, as other sources 
present them in detail.2 
 
PVC pr oduc tion: Vinyl chloride, the building block 
from which PVC resin is made, is a classified by the 
National Toxicology Program as “known to be a 
human carci nogen,” a nd has been sim ilarly classified 
as a human car cinogen by other US a nd international 
agencies .3 PVC  production exposes workers and 
communities t o vinyl chloride, 4 and many studies 
have  documented links between working in vinyl 
chlorid e productio n facilities an d increased l ikelihood 
of developing diseases i ncluding angiosarcoma of the 
liver, a  rare form  of liver ca ncer.5 The large numbers 
of workers in PVC m anufacturing  facilities, where 
vinyl chloride exposure is generally lower t han in  
vinyl chloride and PVC resin production, also have  
an increased likelihood of developing angiosarcom a 
of the liver.6 Vinyl chloride and PVC exposure are 
also ass ociated with ce rtain non-ca ncer dis orders.7  
Our p rincipal finding is that this belief is untrue; PVC 
does not offer enormous ec onomic advant ages over 
all other materials. Altern atives prov iding equ al or 
better performance a re available for alm ost every use 
of PVC . In some cases, the costs of the alternative 
materials are already c omparable to PVC  when  costs 
are m easured over the useful life of the  product. In 
other cases , the alternatives  are slightly m ore 
expe nsive at present , but are l ikely to come dow n in 
cost as t heir m arket s hare expands. T he continue d use 
of PVC  offers small short-term  gains in some areas, 
and none at all in others. 
 
In this rep ort, we explore the econom ics of phasing 
out PVC . We b egin by looking at the uses of  PVC  
today  and reviewing past studies of the costs of 
altern atives to PVC. We then offer four principles for 
analysis of th e altern atives, all of th em challen ging 
the eco nomic arg uments for continued use of PVC:  
PVC use : For most appl ications, PVC  resins are 
mixed with add itives su ch as  stabilizers, p lasticizers, 
and fillers.8 These additives ca n leach out of, or 
volatilize fro m, a PVC product d uring the product’s 
useful life. Fo r example, exposu re to plasticizer s can  
occur when th ey volatilize from  PVC p roducts, su ch 
as building m aterials; whe n they leach out of medical 
equipment during use, exposing patients; and when 
they leach from  soft plastic toys.9 Phthalates, which 
are used as pla sticizers, may pose hazards to 
devel opment and reproduction,10 and have  been 
implicated in the devel opment of res piratory  
problems in children.11 Stabilizers that a re used in 
PVC a nd can leach out of PVC products  include lead 
and other heavy metals.  
• Alternatives that have  higher purchase prices, 
or higher installed  costs, th an PVC m ay stil l be 
cheape r on a full-cost accounting or life -cycle 
cost basis. 
• Altern atives that lo ok expensive when 
produced in small b atches tod ay will b ecome 
cheape r when they are mass-produced. 
• The unique health and environmental dam ages 
cause d by PVC can e ndanger the users of a 
product, as in the case  of m edical supplies.

• Academ ic studies ha ve shown that the costs  of 
environmental protection are routinely 
overestim ated in a dvance, and decline rapidly 
after im plementation. 
 
We a pply thes e principles i n a disc ussion of 
altern atives to PVC in m ajor mark ets, in cluding 
detailed discussion of pipes, roofing, floor coverings, 
and medical gloves, and a summary descri ption of the 
siding and windows markets. Following the analysis 
of these m arkets, we  exam ine the e xpecte d 
employm ent effects of a  PVC phaseout a nd then turn 
to the steps t hat have  alrea dy been take n toward 
altern atives. 
 
Vinyl Today: A Look at the Market 
 
Sales of  PVC grew rapidly in the 1990s, reaching 
14.4 billion pou nds in the US and  Canada in 20 02.14 
This is equ ivalent to 46 pound s for every person in 
the two  countries. PVC sales are m uch lower in o ther 
industrial co untries: 31 pounds p er person in Western  Europe, a nd 25 pounds per person in Japan. 
Worldwid e prod uction was 59 b illion pounds (or 
almost 27 million metric to ns) in 2002, an averag e of 
9 pounds per p erson. With 5 perce nt of the wo rld’s 
population, the US and Canada consume 24 perce nt 
of the world’s PVC . 
 
Data on the uses of PVC in the US and Canada for 
1994, 1999, 200 2, an d forecasts f or 2007, are sho wn 
in Table 1. Th e 2002 figures are also sh own 
graphically in Figure 1. The principal uses of PVC , in 
order of importance, a re pipes, construction 
materials, cons umer goods, packagi ng, and electrical 
products such as wi re and cable. Pipes, siding, 
windows, doo rs, an d profiles (gutters, fences, d ecks, 
etc.) tog ether acco unt for m ore than two -thirds of 
PVC use, and are also the fastest-g rowing  categ ories. 
Many other uses of PVC are growing more slowly, 
and a few actually declined i n the rece nt ec onom ic 
slowdown. Industry projections fo r 2007 assume that 
the recession will end an d growt h will resume, 
although at a  slowe r pace t han in the  1990s.

Costs of Replacing PVC: Three Studies 
 
Three d etailed studies, all pu blish ed in the mid -
1990s, have est imated the cost s of phasi ng out PVC .  
 
• The US-Cana da Internati onal Joint 
Commissio n (IJC)  for the Great Lak es 
exam ined the cost of phasing out PVC  as 
part of its 1 993 “Strategy  for Virtual 
Elimination of Persisten t Toxic 
Substances.”15 The report was done for the 
IJC b y a Can adian consulting firm, Hick ling 
Corporation . In 1994, Hick ling submitted an 
expa nded and revised version of its study.16 
• In respo nse to the IJC, t he Chlorine Institute 
asked Charles River Ass ociates (CRA), a 
US con sulting firm, to stud y the eco nomic 
bene fits of chlorine and related chemicals, 
including an analysis of PVC.17  
• In 1997, Environment Canada published a 
study of options for replacing chlorine-based 
products, in cluding a detailed  look at 
altern atives to PVC.18 
 
These a re the most extensive  and c omprehensive  
studies on the subject, alt hough  by now  they are 
somewhat dated. Moreover, as we will exp lain, their 
cost estim ates fail to  incorpo rate sev eral important 
factors that favor the a doption of altern atives. All 
three found PVC to  be only mo destly ch eaper than 
the altern atives.  
 
Each of the studies examined many specific uses of 
PVC, co mparing the prices fo r PVC products to  their 
PVC-free altern atives. Env ironm ent Canada created   
two sets of price co mparison s: a low case look ing at 
the least expe nsive a vailabl e alternatives, and a high 
case based on higher-priced altern ative products that 
were  in use in Canada . 
 
Table 2 compares the  results of the st udies . For eac h 
study it sh ows the cost in crease th at would resu lt 
from switch ing to PVC-free altern atives, ex pressed  in 
dollars per pound of PVC (updated to 2002 prices) . 
Cost estim ates are s hown se parately  for pipes  and for 
all other products. Sin ce pipes represent about half of 
all PVC  use, t he pipe and non-pipe figures in Tabl e 2 
are averaged to ob tain a rough esti mate of the total 
cost of re placing PVC.

Table 2 shows a rem arkable degree  of agreement 
between  the two  earlier stud ies. With one minor 
adjustment to the Hick ling data (in corporated  in 
Table 2), the CRA an d Hick ling stud ies yield  nearly 
identical ave rage costs of replacing PVC —$1.07 to 
$1.15 per pound .19 The Environment Canada  low 
case ha d an average  cost of about half this much, due 
to its m uch lower esti mate for pipe costs. For the

The E nvironm ent Cana da study, the  most recent of 
the three, e xamined 14 product categ ories th at 
accounted for about 90 percent of PVC use  in 
Canada . In m ost categories, t he study c ompared costs  
for PVC products, a common lower-priced alternative, a nd a c ommon hi gher-priced alt ernative  
(not necessari ly the highest or lowest prices on the 
market). Published in 1997, the stud y is b ased on 
prices a nd conditions in Canada and construction 
costs for the Toronto area in 1993. Nine of the 14 
product cate gories we re in the areas of pipes and

For pipes, the low-co st altern ative to PVC was in  
each case  anot her plastic, usually high-de nsity 
polyethylene (HDPE). Traditional pipe m aterials 
such as iron, concrete, and copper provided slightly 
higher-cost altern atives. Howev er, as shown in  Table 
3, the estim ated price per pound of PVC replaced was 
small for all pipe application s and was act ually 
negative (meaning the altern atives co st less t han 
PVC) for low-cost drain an d industrial applications. 
 
The st ory is more com plex for construction materials, 
where the available options a re more dive rse and are  
chan ging more rapidly than with pipes. For example, 
Environment Canada ’s low-cost siding alternative, 
aluminum siding, has all but disappeared from the 
mark et tod ay. (Newer alte rnatives will be discussed 
below.) Flooring was the area with by far the highest 
cost; although it represented only 3 percent of all 
PVC use in Canada  in 1993, it accounte d for over 
half of the cost of the entire low-co st PVC 
replacem ent scenari o. New flooring product s have 
continued to appea r, and some of the best alternatives 
today  were  not avai lable at the time of the study. 
   
 
Over all, the added costs of non-vinyl construction 
materials were modest: according t o Environment 
Canada , the use of non-PVC  alternatives for all four 
application s—sid ing, window s, flooring, and wire 
and cable— would have inc reased the cost of new  
resid ential constru ction by 0.4 percent in the lo w 
case, or 2.4 pe rcent in the high case. 
 
If these estim ates applied t oday, what would they 
imply for the costs of phasing ou t PVC? As 
mentioned  above, PVC  consumption in 2002 was 
about 14.4 billion pou nds for the US and  Canad a as a 
whole, or 46 pounds per person. The Environment 
Canada  low ca se, the  most recent and detailed c ost 
analysis, s uggests an a verage cost increase of $0.55 
per pou nd from  switch ing to altern atives (see Tab le 
2). If this figure still ap plied, the total co st for 
replacing all PVC use would be about $8 billion a 
year for the US and Ca nada  as a whole, or $25 per 
person. 
 
While it is based on the best  avai lable published 
figures, th is cal culation has limited  applicabilit y

today . Recall that over half of Environment Canada ’s 
total co st of altern atives cam e from a very high 
estimate for t he cost  of replacing vinyl flooring. As 
we will see, better altern atives are av ailab le today, 
with life-cycle costs lower th an vinyl flooring. 
Remove t he inflated flooring cost, and Environment Canada’s estimate sh rinks to less th an $4 billion total, 
or $12 per pe rson. And this is not the onl y factor 
tending to lower th e cost of altern atives. In  the 
section that follows, we examine several  reasons why 
the cost of a phaseou t will prob ably be even lower 
than sugg ested by current prices.  
 
 

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

Factors Favoring Phaseout
 
 
Although the Environm ent Canada -based estimates 
of the costs of a phaseout are still to o high, it is wo rth 
noting t hat the y are not e normous com pared to the 
North American ec onomy. Affordable housing would 
not suddenly becom e unaf fordable if, as Environment 
Canada  estim ated, replacing the leadi ng uses  of vinyl 
were to raise new resid ential constru ction costs by 
0.4 percent (and  this figure inclu ded the inflated  
flooring cost). Even $8 billion  is less th an 0.1 percent 
of the gross domestic product of the US and Canada;  
with the correctio n for floo ring, the rev ised $4 billion 
cost is $12 per capi ta, less than 0.05 percent of our 
collective incomes. A l oss of this amount, spread 
acros s the entire econom y, would not cause a  
noticeable  average c hange i n our lifestyles a nd 
consumption levels.  
 
Moreover, the estim ated cost diffe rences, a s 
described above, ov erstate th e econ omic benefits of  
PVC. There are four ec onom ic argum ents for 
elimination of PVC, d espite its modest cost 
adva ntage in some settings at  current prices.  
 
Life-Cyc le Costs Often Favor Alter natives 
 
Some of the altern atives have higher initial pu rchase 
prices t han PVC products , but are act ually less 
expe nsive ove r the usef ul life of the product. The 
three st udies  describe d above com pared purchase 
prices, or i n some cases installed costs, of PVC a nd 
alternatives. Such co mparisons may give a 
mislead ing impression about the total co st of owning, 
using, and caring for the products in qu estion .  
 
The t otal cost over a product ’s life cycle is the c ost 
that ultimately matters to  the user. Fo r example, 
pape r plates are m uch chea per than ceramic dinner 
plates, but househo lds, restauran ts, and  institutional 
food serv ices often  conclude that it is ch eaper in th e 
long run to buy, was h, and reuse ceram ic plates, 
rather than continually buying and discarding paper 
plates.  
 
The c oncept of life-cycl e cost s is no m ore 
complicated  than this fam iliar example. Rather th an 
making a decisio n based on initial co sts alo ne, it is 
important to com pare th e full costs, over a period of 
time, of buying, in stallin g, using, maintaining, and 
ultimately disposing of alternativ e produ cts. If a 
ceram ic plate is use d daily and is e xpected t o last for 
a year, t hen the  correct c omparison would be  the c ost  
 
 
  
 
of 1 purchase, 365 washings, and 1 disposal versus 
the cost of buying and disposing of 365 paper 
plates.20 As in this case, a m ore expensive initial 
purchase m ay be cheaper in the long run if it lasts 
longer and/or requires less maintenanc e or fewer 
repair s. 
 
For some building m aterials, such  as flooring, 
main tenance an d rep air costs can be the largest co sts 
of the product l ife cycle. In such cases , the lowest-
main tenance product is often the cheapest on  a life-
cycle basis, regardless  of whet her it has t he lowest 
purchase price. As we will see in  a later sectio n, vinyl 
is the cheapest option for commercial an d 
institutional floo ring on a first-cost basis bu t the most 
expe nsive option on a  life-cy cle basis. Whe n life-
cycle costs are  taken i nto account, vi nyl flooring 
loses out  to higher-priced but longer-lastin g and more 
easily m aintained altern atives. 
 
The discussion of life-cycle c osts should not be 
confused with academ ic studi es known as  “life-cycle 
analyses” (LC As). A life-cyc le cost c omparison looks 
at the costs to the user of a product from purchase 
through disposal. Lif e-cycle an alysis, on  the other 
hand, attem pts to accoun t for all th e env ironmen tal 
impacts of a  given product, from production through 
use a nd disposal. Depending on the data categories 
that are i ncluded, LCAs  may provide useful 
environmental in formation, but they are not a 
substitu te for a life-cycle co st compariso n. Note that 
life-cycle costs  do not directly d epend on the 
environm ental im pacts included in a LC A; rather, 
life-cycle co sts reflect durability an d ease of 
main tenance, as well as i nitial co sts. 
 
Surprisingly, some LCAs ha ve given PVC  relatively 
good ratings. However, these LCAs often  omit th e 
highly toxic and carcinogenic emissions t hat are the 
most serious problem s associa ted with P VC.21 LCAs 
that include t oxic em issions do ide ntify PVC as an 
undesirab le material. Th e Tellu s Institute Pack aging 
Study, an early  LCA t hat evaluated c ommon 
packaging materials prim arily on the basis of life-
cycle to xicity, f ound that PVC w as 10 to 12 ti mes 
worse than other common pl astics (which include 
some of the lead ing altern atives to  PVC ). If the 
Tellu s stud y had used the Vinyl In stitute’s own 
estimates of e missions, published at about the sam e 
time, instead  of th e best available pub lic data sources, 
it would have found that PVC  was “only” four times 
as ba d as other plastics.22

Mass Production Reduces Costs 
 
Mass production makes ever ything cheaper. Many 
PVC  products have  been produced in huge volumes, 
making them look cheap today; the production of 
PVC altern atives cou ld just as easily g row in vo lume 
in the future, making them less ex pensive and more 
competitiv e than they are at presen t. Th ere are two  
related e ffects at work here, known as “econom ies of 
scale” and “lea rning curve s.”  
 
Econ omies of scale refer to the fact  that production 
costs per unit are often lower when goods are 
produce d in larger batches. There are  several  reaso ns 
why it is ch eaper  for a big factory to pr oduce lar ge 
amounts of a single product, compared t o smaller 
plants producing lesser qu antities o f the same go od. 
Some processe s are physically more efficient whe n 
performed on a lar ger scale; a bigger bo iler or 
furnace  simply costs less  to operate, per unit  of heat 
output, than a small one. In general , a larger scale of 
production means t hat more machinery, automation, 
and standardized pr ocedures can be applied. A 
company that s ells a few hun dred plastic obje cts of a 
particula r shape each yea r may have  worke rs make 
them almost by hand, using only basic tools and 
equipment. A c ompany that se lls a few m illion a yea r 
will in vest in molding and stamping machines, 
assem bly lines, etc., allo wing much faster, labor-
saving, lower-cost production.  
 
Lear ning curves describe the common pat tern in 
which costs decline over time as an  indu stry gains 
expe rience  with a production process . This is often 
combined with econom ies of scale—as industry gains 
expe rience, factories also tend to get bigger—but 
learning c urves are possible even if factory s izes do 
not change. Whenever a new process  is introduce d, it 
takes a while to  debug it; hence th e common, 
informal ad vice to  avoid version 1.0 of  any new 
software package. Much the same is true for 
manufact uring. Over time, the bugs  are worked out, 
shortcuts and process improve ments are developed, 
and maintenance procedures and schedules are 
improved. As a result, costs go down. This 
phenomenon was first documented in the aircraft 
industry in th e 1930s and has been  observed in 
industries rangin g from shipbuilding to wi nd turbines 
and pho tovoltaic cells.23 A co mmon estimate is that 
when an industry’s cu mulative produ ction (the total 
from the beginning of the industry to th e presen t) 
doubles, the cost per unit drops by 10 percent to 30 
percent. In one classic ex ample, a st udy found  that 
the Ford Model T dropped in price by 15 percent for every  doubling of cumulative production from 1909  
to 1923.24 
 
The combined effects of econom ies of scale and 
learning c urves can be seen in the evolution of many 
consum er electronics products . Cell phones, CD 
players, DVD players, dig ital cam eras, flat s creen 
computer monitors, and numerous ot her products 
started out as expensive and esoteric luxuries and 
then dropped rap idly in price as the m arket e xpanded.  
 
At a ce rtain point, the fact that some people are using 
a new product mean s that other p eople will begin to 
use it too. For exam ple, if many people have begun to 
use a n ew co mputer program, other people will ad opt 
it simply in order to h ave a syste m compatible with  
that of th eir colleag ues. Conv ersely, it mig ht be 
inconvenient to be the only person  in a city with an 
unus ual car m odel, because re pairs woul d be 
expe nsive and parts would be har d to find. Thus, for 
a new technology, the fact that som e people have  
already a dopted it eve ntually becom es a strong 
argument for further a doptions. By pushing up 
demand, this pattern  creates a sno wballing effect th at 
lowe rs prices a nd tends t o “lock in”  the adva ntage of 
the pro duct that cu rrently leads the m arket.25  
 
Thus, when a product sells for a relativ ely low price 
and is used w idely, w e cannot assu me that it is u sed 
widely sim ply because  it is cheap. It may, instead, be 
cheap  because it is used  widely. 
 
PVC  has benefited from mass production in many 
markets. PVC products ha ve been used for decades, 
have  achi eved large sal es volume, and t hus are m ass-
produce d at low cost. The learning curve  effect 
appea rs to have been particularly steep for PVC, with 
every doubling of production associated with a 30 
percent to 40  percen t drop in price in the 195 0s and 
1960s.26 A history of the i ndustry descri bes a  steady 
stream  of process innovations and improvements in 
production tech nology in th ese early years, along 
with rapid increases in  the size of th e newest and 
most efficient plants; thes e factors undoubtedly drove 
the price downward.27 
 
Many of th e less tox ic altern atives are not yet firm ly 
estab lished in th e market; th ey do not currently en joy 
econom ies of s cale and learning curve a dvantages 
comparable to those  enjoyed by PVC. In some cases, 
less to xic altern atives that were once pop ular may 
have  benefited from econom ies of scale in the past  
but have been  pushed aside by vinyl and are now 
produced in relatively small quantities. Li noleum 
flooring and aluminum siding are e xamples of  this 
pattern. Analyses of th e long-run costs of a  PVC-free

future shou ld look beyond  the cur rent price of 
altern ative products to their (likely lo wer) future 
price as  they becom e widely adopted and m ass-
produce d. 
 
PVC Produ cts Can Be Dangerous to Users 
 
Often  the harmfu l effects of PVC em erge during the 
intended use of the product. For exam ple, flexible 
PVC  products used in heal th care, s uch as IV bags 
and tubes, cont ain phthalat es—plasticizers t hat can 
leach out of the products dur ing use, posing hazards 
to patients.28 The U S Food and D rug Administration 
has issued an advisory, for example, rec ommending 
measures t o reduce  patients’ exposure to the 
phthalate Di(2-ethylhexy l)phthalate (DEHP) in 
medical devi ces.29 Phthalates a re also used in some 
flexible PVC toys, including toys th at young  children 
are lik ely to  put in  their mouths. In 1999, the 
European  Commission ad opted an emergenc y ban on 
certain  phthalate-con taining PVC to ys and  other 
products, such as teething rings, intended for children 
to put in their mouths. T his ban has been renewe d 
repeat edly, pending devel opment of perm anent 
regulations. Some, th ough not all, US m anufacturers 
have  voluntarily stopped production of PVC  toys 
containing phthalates.30 (The  US Consumer Product 
Safety Co mmission has denied petitions to ban PVC 
in toys for y oung children  or to issue an advisory 
about hazards associat ed with these t oys.31)  
 
Additional problems occur when PVC is exp osed, 
intentionally o r otherwise, to heat. In case of fire, 
vinyl building products release larg e quantities of 
hydrochloric acid , and sm aller quantities o f many 
other toxins, threatening building occ upants and  
neighbors as well as firefi ghters. For this  reason, 
some firefighte r associations  are worki ng to e ducate 
the pub lic abou t the hazards of PVC  and a re 
supporting  municipal and state lev el policies to  
reduce PVC us e. The Intern ational Asso ciatio n of 
Fire Fi ghters points out that 165 people died in the 
Beverly Hills Sup per Club  Fire o f 1977, and 85 
people in th e MGM Grand  Hotel Fi re in Las Veg as in 
1980—alm ost all of whom , according t o the 
firefi ghters, were killed by inhalatio n of toxic fumes 
and ga ses, not by heat, flam es, or  carbon dioxide. A 
likely cu lprit is th e hydrochloric acid  created  by the 
decomposition of PVC  used in wiring and other 
building materials.32 Medical re searche rs have found 
elevated le vels of long-t erm respiratory and other 
health pr oblems in firefi ghters who put out fi res 
involving large quantities of PVC an d have identified  
hydrochloric acid —acting  alon e or in combination with carbon monoxide and  soot—as t he probable 
cause of  the damages.33  
 
PVC is often advertised a s “fire resistant,” m eaning 
that a fai rly high temperatu re is req uired to  start it 
burning. However, PVC starts to smolder a nd release 
toxic fumes such as  hydrochloric acid at a lower 
temperatu re, lon g before it i gnites. If PVC is 
gradually warmed , more than half of its weig ht is 
given off as fumes b efore it gets ho t enou gh to burst 
into flam es.34 The hydrochloric acid released by 
burning PVC i s potentially leth al to people cau ght in 
a burning building; other products of PVC  
combustion, s uch as  dioxin, exert their health e ffects 
more slowly an d are spread across a larger 
population. 
 
Related  hazards o ccur with PVC-in sulated wiring , 
which was o nce standard for use in airplanes. There 
is no proof that PVC  insulation has e ver caused a 
plane c rash, but som e invest igators have suggested 
that there  are grounds  for concer n abou t older planes 
that still co ntain PVC-i nsulated  wires. Fu ll-sized  
modern ai rplanes contain 100 or more miles of 
wiring . The insulation on this wiring  is critical to  air 
safety: d efects in the insulation could allow sh ort 
circuits and sparks, potentially setting of f a fire or 
explosion. A possible example is ValuJet Flight 592, 
a DC-9  that crash ed in 199 6, killin g all 11 0 peo ple on 
board. Although the flight crew reported an electrical 
power failu re moments bef ore the airc raft c rashed, 
many repo rts in stead fo cused on  the possibility th at 
oxygen tanks on board caused the crash. Aviation 
Today said in  a special repo rt on this and  another 
accident, 
 
The ValuJet Flight 592 accident aircra ft was 
rigged with a t ype of wire i nsulation, PVC, t hat 
will n ot pass the FAA’s cu rrent flam e test.… 
Among PVC wire' s unacceptable propertie s, its 
burning insulation creates copious amounts of 
smoke, an d the insulation ca n turn to 
hydrochloric acid  when exposed  to moisture. It is 
found on all DC-9 s built through 1975. In 
addition, the vast m ajority o f 727s…were built 
with PVC wire. According to an anonymous

days afte r the ValuJet c rash, the accide nt aircraft 
"was c ontinually havi ng electrical

But as Aviation Today noted, many older ai rplanes 
that are still flyin g contain PVC-co ated wi ring; the 
FAA neve r banned its use.37 The US Air Fo rce 
discontinued installatio n of PVC in 197 7, although 
replacing  all of the existing wiring at once was too  
expe nsive; the sche dule fo r gradual re placement of 
wiring  in some Air Force planes stretch es out until 
2015.38 Meanwhile, the pote ntial hazards of older 
planes  continue: there have been at least nine 
instances of in-flight electri cal fires  in DC-9 aircraft 
since 1983, t hree of whic h occurred after th e ValuJet 
crash.39  
  
In these a nd similar cases, PVC is a n inferi or product 
preci sely because of its healt h and environmental 
hazards, for those who use it as well as t hose who 
make it.  
 
Environmental Protection Costs Less Than 
Anticipated  
 
The c osts of environmental protection are often 
overestim ated in a dvance. One of the  classic 
exam ples of t his trend actually occurre d in PVC 
production. A strict standa rd for workplace expos ure 
to vinyl chloride (the raw material from which PVC 
is made) was estab lished in 1974 by the Occu pational 
Safet y and Hea lth Administration (OSHA), following 
recognition of the likely carci nogenicity of vinyl 
chlorid e. Con sultants to OSHA estim ated the costs of 
reducing vinyl chlorid e exposure at around $1 billion; 
industry estim ates were  even higher. Actual costs 
turned ou t to be aro und a quarter of OSHA ’s 
estimate, since i ndustry quickly devel oped new, cost-
effectiv e techno logies to co mply with  the 
regulation.40  
 
Similar patterns have been found for many 
environmental standa rds. One study found that 
compliance costs for env ironmen tal regu lations were 
overestimated in advance in 11 out of 12 cases. 
Another study found that advance c ost estimates for 
environmental co mpliance tu rned ou t to b e more than 
25 percent too high in 14  out of 28 cases, while th ey 
were m ore than 25 percent too low i n only 3 of th e 28 
cases.41 A review of this literatu re for Env ironment 
Canada  and the Ontario Ministry of Energy, Science 
and Tech nology, fo cusing specifically o n the costs of 
controlling chlorinated substances, con firmed that 
overestim ation of regu latory co sts is m ore commo n 
than unde restimation. Am ong the  cases where it 
found ser ious overestimation of US regulatory costs 
were  the a dvance predictions of com pliance costs for 
the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting su bstances and the bans on the tox ic pesticid es DDT and  
chlorda ne/heptachlor.42 
 
There  are at least three reasons for this repeatedly 
lighter-than-expected burden. First, economies of 
scale and  learnin g curv e effects are usually no t built 
into prospective co st estim ates, but often arise in  the 
production of pollution control devices a nd cleaner 
altern ative materials. Seco nd, as with v inyl chlorid e, 
regulation may stimulate in novation and  lead to  the 
introdu ction of n ew, m ore effi cient techn ologies. 
Finally, ov eresti mation of costs m ay at ti mes b e a 
bargaining tactic for indu stry in argu ing against 
environmental protection.  
 
While m any of the a nalyses cited he re refer to 
regulations, often invo lving traditional end -of-pipe 
pollution controls, ex actly th e sam e facto rs are at 
work in the cas e of clean  produ ction altern atives: 
economies of scale an d learn ing curv es will b e 
important, indu stry will develop new technolo gies to 
ease the transit ion, and t he costs o f the transitio n to 
clean p roduction may be exa ggerated in advance  for 
rhetorical or ba rgaining purposes. 
 
The best-known claim s of extraordi nary c osts 
imposed  by environmental policy do not stand up to 
careful exam ination; they t urn out to be base d on a 
series of errors and misinterpretations.43 This has 
important implications f or employment and other 
econom ic impacts. Des pite rhetorical claim s to the 
contrary, environmental protection has al most never 
cause d noticea ble num bers of job losse s.44 Moreover , 
the critics often forget that env ironmental in itiativ es 
creat e jobs, m any of them skilled blue-collar jobs. 
The phaseout of PVC is a case in  point; the 
alternatives t o PVC a re guaranteed t o require the 
efforts of indu strial an d construction work ers. Th e 
possible em ployment implications of a PVC  phaseout 
are ex amined in a later section  of this report.

Markets for Alternatives  
 
 
 
Because the  uses of PVC a re so diverse, the 
altern atives are lik ewise varied. The next five 
sections l ook at specific markets fo r PVC,  exploring 
the availab le altern atives, th e differen t prop erties th at

flooring.45 The fourth exam ines medical suppl ies,

Alternatives to PVC, I: Pipes 46
 
Much of th e PVC used is invisib le to most of us; it is 
usually buried underground—or under the sink or 
behind the walls. But visible or not, modern life 
involves a lo t of pipes. So me estimates su ggest th at 
municipal water an d sewer syste ms will acq uire $8 
billion of pipes ann ually fo r the n ext 20 years. In  
addition, large quantities of pipes will b e installed  to 
meet residentia l, comm ercial, industrial, a nd 
agricultural needs. Man y of these pipes will b e made 
of PVC , providing by  far the most important market 
for vinyl. Pipes and  pipe fittin gs make up almost half 
of PVC  use, as seen  in Table 1. 
 
 PVC  pipes ha ve been  in use for at least 30 years and 
have  become standa rd in some applications, such as 
the “drain/ waste/vent” (DWV ) tubing t hat carries 
wastewater away from  kitchens a nd bathrooms. They  
have  also gai ned a la rge share of the  market for 
small-diameter municipal water and sewe r pipes a nd 
for electrical c onduits. Accord ing to ind ustry 
estimates, on a  lineal basis PVC accounts for more 
than 70 percent o f all water an d sewer pipes now 
being installed  in the US.47 
 
PVC p ipes are co mpeting both with  traditional pipe 
materials—co pper, iro n, concrete, and  vitrified  
clay—and with polyethylene (PE) and other plastic 
pipes. Among ot her plastics, acry lonitrile butadiene 
styrene (AB S) is sometimes used fo r drai n pipes; 
however, PE is by far the most important plastic pipe 
material after PVC . The different pipe materials have  
contrasting strengths and weaknesses.48  
 
• The trad itional materials are heav ier and , for 
large-diameter pipes, may be har der to 
install an d rep air. Howe ver, they are strong 
unde r extremes of press ure and tem perature . 
Copper plumbing remains the standa rd for 
hot and cold water in  most build ings. Iron 
water a nd sewer pipes m ay corrode i n acidi c  
  
soil; they are so metimes co ated with tar to  
combat corrosi on.  
• PVC is ligh tweig ht and lower priced than 
some altern atives and  requires less sk ill to 
install an d rep air. Howev er, PVC is weak er 
under high pressure an d becomes b rittle at 
below-freezi ng te mperatures. For hot water 
pipes, a more expensive, modified form, 
chlorinated PVC (CPVC ), must be used. 
• PE p ipes offer a lightweight altern ative with  
great er strength under press ure, as  well as 
stron ger, more leak -proof joints and  the 
ability to  with stand temperatures well b elow 
freezing. For hot wate r pipes, a more 
expe nsive, modified form, cross-l inked 
polyethylene  (XLPE , marketed as  PEX), 
must be use d.  
 
In view of its emerg ing role as an altern ative to PVC 
pipes, we begin with an examination of the PE pipe 
industry. We t hen discuss the two major m arket 
segm ents: municipal water and sewer pipes a nd 
plumbing within buildings, including a detailed look 
at a rece ntly constructed building t hat specified PVC-
free pl umbing. We conclude with price comparisons 
for several  common pl umbing jobs with and without 
PVC. 
 
Polyethylene Pipe49 
 
PE pipes a re one of the most important alternatives to 
PVC. PE is t he only other lead ing material t o 
approach PVC in both  weight and ease of 
installatio n; while so me equipment is n eeded to 
install PE pi pes, sm all-scale pipe-welding m achines  
are becom ing available for homeowne r or small 
contractor use. Moreover, PE has important 
adva ntages over PVC, such as greater strength under 
press ure and under low temperatures, and lower rates 
of leaks a nd breakage . Production of polyethylene, 
although not pollution-free, is far less t oxic than 
 

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC

production of PVC ; most of the toxic effects of the 
PVC life cycle involve c hlorinated  emissions, and PE 
does not contain chlorine. 
 
PEX (cross-link ed polyeth ylene) is su itable for hot 
and cold water and, becau se of its fle xibility, can 
easily b e bent around cor ners without a coup ling or 
fittin g, reducing labor tim e and the potential for leaks 
and system  failures that tend to  occur at joints in 
fittin gs. Because of its inh erent flexibility, it  has high 
tolerance  for expansion and contraction, thus making 
it burst resistant. 
 
Sales of PE pipe in  the US and  Canada, as esti mated 
by the Plastics Pipe Institute, have grown rapidly, 
doubling in just a few years in th e late 1990s.50 PE 
pipe sales for 2000 and 2001 are shown in Table 4. 
The total reached  1.4 billion pounds in 2000, before 
dropping back to a little o ver 1.0 billion pounds as 
the econo my slumped in 2001. Fo r comparison, PVC 
pipe sales are aroun d 6.5 billion pou nds a year, as 
shown in Table 1. 
 
Small declin es in PE p ipe sales o ccurred in many 
areas i n 2001, reflecting the economic slowdown and 
reduce d pace of construction. The largest dec line 
occu rred in conduits, which represe nted one-third of 
all PE p ipe sold in 200 0. PE co nduits were widely 
used in th e “dot-co m” eco nomy with  its m any cable 
and conduit needs; this market suffered an abrupt 
downturn beginning in 2001.  
 
Substantial qu antities o f PE pipe are used in  areas 
that do not compete with PVC, suc h as gas 
distribution and oil and gas production. W ater and 
sewer p ipes, wh ich are areas of direct co mpetitio n 
between the two plastics, are  among the top uses for 
PVC , but represent only a frac tion of  the PE pi pe 
market.  
 
Some com panies produce both PE and PVC pipe, 
giving them an additional motive to avoid 
competitio n between  rival plastics. For ex ample, J-M 
Manufacturing, the world’s largest  PVC  pipe 
manufact urer, recently acquired Quail, an Arka nsas-
based manufacturer of PE piping. J-M acknow ledges 
an increased demand for PE, attributable in part to 
the appeal of leak-free  joints as well as con tracto rs’ 
increased  familiarity an d ability to  work with the 
mater ial.51 They also are  project ing increase d market 
demand for PE in  the water/sewer m arkets, in  
addition to th e stron g hold that PE cu rrently has in 
the ga s market. 2000 2001

PE pipe is newer to the market and hence l ess 
familiar to plumbers, co ntractors, and municipal 
public works departments, than PVC and traditional 
pipe materials. The Am erican Water Works 
Association first gave its approval for the use of 
small-diameter PE water p ipes in 1978, and for larger 
diameters only in 1990. PE pl umbing has also been  
approved by the Nat ional Sanitation Fo undation.  
 
Reluctance to embrace new materials, includi ng 
CPVC, PEX, a nd PE , especially in large  com mercial 
projects, result s in part from memories of  the failure  
of an earlier “ new” pipe m aterial, p olybutylen e (PB). 
Introduce d in the late 1970s, PB pipe quickly gained 
a reputation for frequent leaks. Howeve r, it cont inued 
to be sold through the 1980s and ear ly 1990s b ecause 
its ease of in stallatio n allowed sav ings of hundreds of 
dollars  per home. A class act ion suit a gainst  Shell, 
the largest manufact urer of PB pipe, Cox v. Shell, 
was settled  in 1995 for $ 950 million, one of the 
largest settlemen ts in US history.52 Today, numer ous

Water and Se wer Pipes 
 
PVC has been very s uccess ful in the  market for 
small-diameter municipal water and sewe r pipes. 
Some obse rvers claim that PVC pipe installation 
minimizes municipal labor and equipment costs and 
also m inimizes the length of time that streets are 
blocked for pipe installation. For larger diameter 
main pipes, where st rength under pressure is of great 
concern, the trad itional materials h ave retained  a 
substan tial sh are of the market, and  PE is a stron ger 
contender than PVC . Strength under extreme 
temperatures is more im portant in northern areas 
where the ground often freeze s; accordingly, PVC 
has m ade greater inroads in southern, frost-free pa rts 
of the country.  
 
Not everyone, ho wever, has o pted for PVC . In recent 
years, some municipal water and sewer syste ms have  
chosen PE i nstead of PVC.  Perform ance iss ues, not 
cost, a ppear t o drive the  decisi on. T he Indianapolis 
Water C ompany (IWC) has switched to PE because it 
reduces leak s at th e joints and b ends in th e pipes and  
because a new installation techni que (which works 
only with PE) minimizes exc avation and disruption. 
IWC has now installed more than 30 miles of PE  pipe 
of diam eters large r than 20 inches.53 
 
IWC is a su bsidiary of United Water Co mpany, a 
large private company that operates privatized water 
syste ms in many areas. United Water affiliates in  
New  Jersey  and New  York also choose to avoid PVC  
in order t o minimize leaks,  since they operat e in 
congeste d urban areas where it is expensi ve and 
difficult to excavate and repair underground pipes. 
Local  building code s and conditions require very 
strong pipes, and United Water uses i ron and cem ent 
pipes  in New York and New Jersey ; PVC  is not 
durable enou gh for u se under these conditions. 
Howe ver, United Water does use some PVC in 
Flori da, where there is less concern about damage to 
pipes due to frost. 54   
 
Califo rnia communities th at have switch ed to PE or 
other non-PVC  pipes for some applications i nclude 
the Contra Costa Public Works Department, whi ch 
uses PE pipes for storm drains; they view PE as 
superior to concrete or metal pipe on the basis o f its 
low weigh t, ease of installatio n, low cost, and  
reduced level of leak s at th e join ts. Th e Los Angeles 
Depa rtment of Water and Power has used PE pipes to 
replace old wat er mains after major breaks, because it 
is the m aterial that minim izes leaks. 
 
PE pi pe pr oducers have  described additional case 
studies of adoption of  PE pi pe for wat er distribution systems in Palermo, Italy, and in Toronto, as well as 
in smaller co mmunities th roughout the US.55 In these 
cases, PE was selected for characteristics including 
resistance t o earthqua kes a nd freezing, m inimal 
damage to sensitive environments (the flexibilit y of 
PE allows less invasive drilling  techn iques for layin g 
pipe), and  the long-term  integrity of its heat-fu sed 
joints. 
 
Municipal a gencies a nd deci sion-m akers ra rely view 
the price of the pipe s them selves as  the m ost 
important factor in choosing water and sewer pipes. 
A represen tative of th e Boston Water and  Sewer 
Commissio n emphasized  this po int, statin g that it 
costs s o much to dig up the streets and install  the 
pipes that the price of th e pipe itself is irrelevan t to 
the city’s de cision. Boston uses the pipe material that 
the agency consid ers app ropriate to  each  job: ductile 
iron for water m ains; copper for house services; 
ductile iro n or reinforced concrete fo r larg e diameter 
sewer pi pes; a nd PVC for sm all diam eter sewer 
pipes. PVC was chosen for the smaller sewe r pipes 
on the basis of its light weight and ease  of 
connection.56 
 
PVC  has al so been a dopted for other low-pressure , 
low-tem peratu re-stress ap plications s uch as irrigation 
pipes, culverts, drain pipes, and some indust rial 
pipes. However, high-pressure applications, such as 
gas pi pelines, cannot use PVC ; instead, PE pi pe has a 
major share of these markets. 
 
If hydrogen becomes an i mportant fuel in the future, 
as the Bush administration and others have  
sometimes suggested, a sy stem of non-PVC pipes 
will be needed to  transport it: h ydrog en can diffuse 
out through the walls of PVC  pipes, due to the porous 
molecular structure of the PVC polym er.  (PE, 
although not as porous as PVC, apparently is also 
unsuitable for hydrogen pipelines.)57 
 
In sho rt, despite PVC ’s con tinuing streng th in this 
major m arket, there  are other materials that play an 
important role, and num erous municipal customers 
who have decided to rely on altern atives to PVC for 
some or al l of their pipe needs. 
 
PVC Plum bing and Con duits: Pr o and Con 
 
Different considerations arise in plumbing, as well as 
conduits fo r wire an d cab le, with in buildings. For do-
it-yourself plumbing, sect ions of small-diameter PVC  
pipe, manufact ured in 10-foot or 20-foot lengths, are 
easy to  cut to the desired  length  and join togeth er 
with pipe cem ent (although s ome pipe cem ent 
products used in home plumbing are themselves

toxic58). However, when plumbing is installed by 
skilled work ers, PVC lo ses th is advantage: it requires 
more joints, and  time must be spent waitin g for 
cemented joi nts to dry before testing and using the 
pipes, in con trast to  alternatives with fewer, but 
stronger, welded joints. 
 
For electrical c onduits, PVC c ompetes with s teel; 
steel is more expensive and har der to bend and 
install, bu t is often  required by building codes fo r its 
much greate r fire resistance. PVC is of cours e more 
flammable than steel, but it is also less  flammable 
than othe r plas tics. For conduits where fire resistance 
is less of a c oncern, s uch as optical fibe r and 
computer net work cables, PE has bee n widely 
adopted. 
 
Outstanding concerns regarding fire haza rds have 
driven building codes i n some areas, s uch as the city 
of Chicago, to exclude all plastic piping, including 
PVC an d CPVC, fro m all co mmercial b uilding 
application s. Chicago  also prohibits plastic p ipe in all 
residential structures t hree stories and above. New 
York State has similar legislation, banning plastic 
pipe, including PVC, fro m all co mmercial b uildings 
and from residen tial b uildings ov er six stor ies in  
height, at least through 2004. Industry critics attack  
such measures as make-wo rk regulations that 
needlessly drive up construction costs in  order to 
protect union jobs. Unions defend them as safet y 
measures, citing the  healt h hazards  of PVC fires.59  
 
Both t he Chica go and t he New York State s tanda rds 
apply to all p lastic p ipes, no t just PVC. Some 
supporte rs of these sta ndards have  argued that all 
plastic p ipes are flammab le and will ign ite at lo wer 
temperatu res than other building materials. Th is 
remains a co ntroversial v iew; many critics h ave 
rejected  the idea th at the use of plastic p ipes affects 
the ris k of fire.60 
 
Even where PVC pipe is allowed by building codes, 
concerns about fire prevention may raise its effectiv e 
cost. Base d on expe rience  in the design of an eight-
story resid ential assisted  living facility in  Cam bridge, 
Massach usetts, engineering consultant John 
Rattenbury concludes that the cost advantage of PVC 
over cast i ron plumbing is larg ely illu sory. Although 
the price per foo t for sanitary and storm drains 
appea rs to be at least three times as h igh for cast iron  
pipes as for PVC, th e building cod e requires 
firestopping protection eve ry time PVC  passes 
through a wall, p lus th ermal expansion joints on  PVC 
pipes. Iron is completely firepro of and has a much 
lowe r coefficient of t hermal expa nsion, so the 
requirem ents are m uch less taxing for iron pipes. These and  other difficu lties mak e installatio n in a 
multi-story building far more expe nsive with PVC , 
offsettin g most of th e app arent co st advantage. In  
addition, Ratten bury ob serves that cast iron  drain 
pipes  are m uch quieter.61 
 
Case Study : Building  Without PVC Pipes62 
 
Although PVC has become conve ntional for some 
plumbing uses, large com mercial and residential 
buildings can  be bu ilt with  no PVC p ipes. There are 
exam ples of such buildi ngs around the coun try. In 
some cases PV C must be av oided due to building 
code s, as in Chicago a nd New  York; in other cases 
the choice of PVC-free plum bing is  due t o the 
growing interest in “green building” design in gene ral 
and the desire  to minimize PVC use i n partic ular.  
 
One such bu ilding is th e Austin Reso urce Cen ter for 
the Ho meless i n Austin, Tex as. (It is far from  the 
only e xample, even in Texas:  the Unive rsity of 
Texas-Houston Schoo l of Nursing building made 
almost identical choices  about pipes.) This project , 
located  in downtown Au stin, is a 26 ,820 gross squ are 
foot building with a construction bu dget of $4.7 
million. For thi s project, c opper was s pecifie d as the 
domestic water p iping, and cast iron  was used in all 
other interior pipe ap plications, with polyethylene 
used for irrigation pipe. Acco rding to the plumbing 
contractor, MJ Mechanical, t hese pi pe choice s 
resulted in  an esti mated 15 percent total in crease in  
the costs of plumbing m aterials an d labor. 
 
• The decision  to choose copper  over PVC for 
domestic water arose independently of the project  
goal; in general, copper is a common choi ce for 
domestic water pipes. Copper provides long-term 
reliab ility an d familiarity, which  are im portant for 
both owners and the trades.63 The PV C option for 
hot water pipes would req uire CPVC (chlorinated 
polyvinyl chloride), formulated to withstand 
higher tem peratures t han stand ard PVC. (At th is 
point, CPVC is still co nsidered  a new market 
entry, with only a 10  to 15  year trac k record in the 
US. For e xperienced installers, c opper can be 
installed  in abou t the same time as PVC; ind ustry 
handbooks esti mate th at it co sts 10  percent more to 
install CPVC t han to  install co pper.)  
• For sanitary, waste, an d vent pipes, cast iron 
was used instead of PVC  even though PVC  has 
becom e the sta ndard material for the se 
application s. The cast iron  cost 15  percent more 
than PVC for mater ials, and did not change labor 
costs. 
• To water the grounds, the project specifications

steel sleeves. The specifica tion of the steel sl eeves 
was based on conce rns that the PE pipe could 
become brittle an d thu s require add itional 
protectio n. Th is boosts bo th the material an d labor  
costs of this system; installat ion labo r exp enses are 
estimated to run about three ti mes th e cost of 
installing PVC irrigation pipe without a sleeve. 
However, some pipe experts believe that such 
sleeves a re unnecessary on PE  pipe s and would 
descri be this  as a case where misconceptions about 
materials led  to more co stly ch oices.64

To conclude our discussion of pipes, we look at the 
costs of PVC  and altern atives for sev eral categ ories 
of plumbing. T able 5 shows the retail purchase price 
for two varieties of small-diameter pipes: ¾-inch 
pipes made of materials not  suited for hot water, and 
½-inc h pipes t hat are  able t o carry hot water. Note 
that PVC  and PE are  fairly cl ose in price for ¾-inc h 
pipe, as are CPVC and PEX for ½-inch hot/cold 
water pipe. Only co pper is d istinctly more exp ensive 
among the altern atives sh own in  Table 5.

Alternatives to PVC, II: Roofing 
 
Roofing  is a $30  billion-a-year indu stry th at installs 
new and replacem ent roofs made from a wi de range 
of materials.65 Alth ough multi-ply (multi-laye r) roofs 
can be applied on any building, it is i ncreasi ngly 
common to use sing le-ply roofing  membranes, 
particularly in  low-slop e applicatio ns for commercial 
buildings. To provide for a range of different uses,  
single-ply roofing m embrane manufact urers produce  
an extensive selectio n of m embranes with varying 
levels of th ickness and  reinforcem ent.  
 
There are three m ajor sing le-ply roo fing membrane 
materials for low-slope roofs: ethylene propylene 
diene m onomer (EPDM ), thermoplastic elastom er 
polyolefin (TPO), and PVC . (In steep -slope roofs, 
PVC  has a  market share of less than 0.5 percent.) The 
installed  cost fo r any of the three is often cheaper 
than for other styles of ro ofing. As sh own in Table 8, 
EPDM is clearly the m arket leader; t he combination 
of EPDM, TPO, and PVC roofs together accounts for 
more than one-third of low-slo pe roofing sales. 
(Additional sing le-ply materials, in cluded in “all 
other,” am ount to another 2 percent  of sales.) Am ong 
single-ply roofing choices, t he alternatives are often 
lower-priced than vinyl, as explained below.

Life-Cycle Roofing Co sts 
 
For roofing, as for other construction products, what 
matters fo r cost-effectiv eness is the total life-cycle cost of a pro duct, rath er than ju st its in itial installed  
cost. On the  Tufts Unive rsity cam pus, for instance,  
 
there a re dozens of buildi ngs that periodically requ ire 
re-roofing. According to a general  contractor that 
frequently works for the university, Tufts formerly 
used EPDM, but has now swi tched to built-up  asph alt 
for low-slop e roofs. Althou gh th e multi-laye r asp halt 
roof costs almost twice as  much per square foot as 
EPDM, Tu fts has d ecided that the multi-laye r roo f is 
better su ited to its requ irements and  redu ces 
main tenance co sts. PVC is no t a viable option for the 
universi ty, in the contractor’s view, since i t would 
cost even more pe r square foot than asphalt, due to 
the time-consumin g installatio n pro cess. In  addition, 
it would not last as long and would tend to devel op 
cracks  and lea ks.66 
 
As this  exam ple suggests, t he expecte d lifetime of a  
roof is cru cial to its life-cy cle costs. PVC doe s poorly 
by this stan dard. A study of the lifetim es of almost 
24,000 low-slope roofs found that PVC  had the 
shortest average life am ong t he roofing types in the 
study (Figure 2). Thus, even if PVC  and another 
roofing material had identical in stalled  costs, PVC 
would have a higher cost per year o f expect ed 
lifetim e.67  
 
Charac teristics of Roofing Ma terials 
 
As in ot her use s, the choice between PVC  and rival 
roofing materials depends on the physical 
characte ristics of the m aterials as well as the  price 
differentials. Single-ply roofing systems are po pular 
because of their comparatively low c ost and ease of 
installatio n. With in the single-ply catego ry, the 
leading m aterials are often seen as  differi ng in 
reflectiv ity, energ y efficien cy, durab ility an d 
flexibility, amo ng other properties. In  this sectio n we 
discuss  differences am ong PVC, EPDM, and TPO. 
 
Reflectivi ty 
 
The vinyl industr y adv ertises the fact that wh ite vinyl 
roofs reflect sunlight and thereby lower building 
temperatures , increasi ng the energy efficienc y of a 
building when air conditioning is in use. This benefit 
has been recognized by EPA’s Ene rgy Star program, 
which identifies prov en energy-con serving 
technologies. Un til TPO was introduced, PVC was 
the only wh ite, sing le-ply membrane roofing  material 
available.

Historical Performance of Roofing Assemblies in the United States 1975- 1996,”

(September, 1997) .
 
Today, however, there are other options fo r whi te 
roofs. TPO, a relativ ely n ew polymer, is availab le in 
white, tan , or gray. It was first  introduced in 1991 in 
Europe and has since m ade the ju mp to the North 
American m arket, where it is gaining m arket share. 
EPDM , an inexpensive synthetic rubber product, is 
naturally black; however, it can be m ade w hite 
through coating  or painting with  a titan ium dioxide 
layer. The  New Orlea ns Superdome, for example, has  
a white EP DM r oof.  
 
During  hot weath er, roofing  color is an  important 
factor affecting ene rgy efficie ncy. While t he 
significance of white roofs is unquestioned for many 
parts of the country, there is an ongoing debate about 
the impact o f roof co lor in north ern clim ates. 
Buildings in no rthern clim ates often  experience m ore 
heatin g than cooling days; some ex perts argu e that 
this makes a solar-absorp tive or darker co lored  roof 
preferable. Opponents of this view argue that white 
roofing reduces ene rgy costs even in nort hern 
latitudes beca use cooling is a more expe nsive proces s 
than heating , due to its relian ce on electricity rath er 
than oil or natural g as. In add ition, some roofs in 
northe rn clim ates are snow c overed during m uch of 
the col d seas on, m aking the c olor of roofing materials 
less im portant during the winter.68 Ongoing research 
on roof reflectivity at Oak  Ridge National Laboratory 
will ad dress th is question ; in a preli minary d iscussion  
of the researc h, the lead in vestigator suggested that  
  
roof color might have little ov erall effect on building 
energy c osts in nort hern clim ates.69 
 
Durability a nd Flexib ility 
 
The three single-ply materials  differ in  durabilit y and 
flexibility, with  PVC generally lag ging behind both 
of the other options.  
 
Adva ntages  of TPO m embranes com pared with PVC  
include superior flex ibility in  cold weath er—allo wing  
easier in stallatio n in cold climates70—and  retention of 
flexibility th roughout the life span of the material. 
EPDM offers si milar adv antages—t he ability to 
withstanding a broad range of temperatures, resist 
weathering, and  stretch and conform to unusual 
shapes. It has e xcellent UV radiation, ozone, and 
weathe ring re sistance. In the past, a key disa dvanta ge 
of EPDM was that its seam s were less effectiv e than 
those of eith er PVC or TPO under sim ilar in stallatio n 
conditions. Acco rding to individuals work ing in th e 
roofing industry, this problem has been eliminated 
with the advent of new seam ing techniques using 
tape.  
 
As in o ther vinyl p roducts, add itives su ch as 
plasticizers m ust be present in PVC roofing  
membranes i n order for them to withstand frequent 
traffic and  maintain flexibility. Gradu al migration of 
plasticizers out  of PVC roof ing materials can lead to 
seam  failure and structural damage, which were

problematic wh en PVC was first in troduced to the 
roofi ng market. Stabilizers  are now adde d to the PVC 
to slow m igration of t he plasticizers, in creasi ng the 
life sp an of the PVC m embrane, but this does no t 
entirely elim inate the proble m.  
 
The s horter lifetim e of PV C roofs, as sho wn in 
Figure 2, results in part from their tendency to 
become brittle an d crack . This effect was h ighlighted 
in resea rch by the US Arm y’s Construction 
Engineeri ng Research La boratory (CERL ). 
Laun ching a lon g-term  investigation into PVC 
membrane r oofing, a 1981 CERL report noted 
anecdotal e vidence of PV C roof failures in  both 
Switzerland a nd the  United States, and sai d, “The 
two most serious PVC membrane problems are 
embrittlement from loss of plasticizer o r from  
exposure to ultraviolet rays an d excessiv e 
shrinkage.”71 A 1997 pape r, reporting on CERL’s 
ten-year field study of three PVC roo fs at m ilitary 
installatio ns, found that the perfo rmance of two  of the 
roofs  was “generally satisfactory,”  wherea s 
“problems rela ted to shatteri ng and splittin g” 
occurre d at t he third.72 The pa per offered a det ailed 
technical c omparison of sam ples of the t hree roofs, 
noting some evidence t hat the  roof that s hattered m ay 
have lost more plasticizer th an th e ones that remained 
intact. 
 
Methods o f insta llation 
 
The i nstalled cost of a roof depends on the method of 
installatio n as well as th e choice o f material.  There 
are three primary ways t o install sin gle-ply roofing  
syste ms: fully adhe red, mechanically fastened, a nd 
ballasted. TPO , EPDM, and PVC can eac h be 
installed  in any of th ese three ways.  
 
A fully adhered roofi ng system  uses the m ost 
expe nsive and labor-intensive method of installation. 
During installation of a fully adhe red roofing system, 
insulation boa rds are placed fi rst and fastene d to an 
underlayment. Thi s is a high performance sy stem 
used in situ ation s where leak s cannot be tolerated  
even tem porari ly, or wher e the ro ofing  system  may 
be exposed to high winds. Se ams can also be heat-
welded in a fully adhered roofing syste m.  
 
A mechan ically fa stened roofin g syste m is essen tially 
a quicker, somewhat  less thorough and less expensive 
variant on the fully adhe red system. Insulation boards 
are tacke d down (though the  fasteners  are spaced 
farthe r apart than in  a fully adhere d system ) and the 
seam s can be heat-welde d together. In a m echanically 
fastene d syste m, the membrane s heets a re fastened to the substrate at certain intervals, depending on 
specifications. 
 
A ballasted  roofing system has the sim plest 
installatio n process. Insulation  is loose laid , and 
gravel is layered on top of the single-ply membrane, 
holding the  system in place. T his causes t he roof t o 
take on a grayish  color (mitigating solar heat gain 
somewhat whe n a black m embra ne is used). In areas  
where river-wash ed gravel is read ily av ailab le, this is 
the least exp ensive installation  process. 
 
Costs of sing le-ply roo fing systems73 
 
To examine the prices of si ngle-ply roofing  syste ms, 
we h ave collected  data for several roofing  optio ns 
from one l ocation, Aust in, Texas, and c ompared them  
to costs for s pecific projects i n three other locations. 
The data demonstrate that PVC has t he highest 
installed  cost of th e three m ajor sing le-ply roofing  
materials. On a  cost per year basis, P VC’s 
disadvantage is lik ely ev en greater du e to its shorter 
expecte d lifetime, as doc umented a bove. 
 
Energy Sta r initiatives have  increased the use of 
white roo fing me mbranes in Texas. Many localities, 
including Austin, offer rebates for increased 
insulation  or use of wh ite refl ectiv e membrane. In 
these areas, PVC m aintains its m arket share in  part 
because it is slightly easier t o heat wel d in warm  
climates. In  addition, TPO is relativ ely n ew to the 
roofing membrane i ndustry and thus introduces 
reliab ility co ncerns, making some institutions 
reluctant to switch  to TPO. EPDM is less pop ular in 
Austin, despite its lo w co st, du e to th e interest in  
white roofs for energy conservation. 
 
Table 9 compares the  costs (including material and 
installatio n labo r) of EPDM, TPO, an d PVC  roofing  
options for commercial ro ofs in the Au stin area. 
Figure 3 presents the same data graphically for 45 
mm roofi ng membranes . As these figures show, the 
cheapest ro ofing  option considered here is ballasted  
EPDM , while fully adhe red TPO and PVC have the 
highest c osts.  
 
The range of variation am ong these c osts is not 
enorm ous a nd will not neces sarily be decisive in 
every decision-making pro cess. The highest price 
shown in th e tab le is less t han 150 percent of the 
lowest price. Ho wever, it is cl ear th at TPO is less 
expe nsive tha n PVC i n all cas es, for all m ethods of 
installatio n and fo r both membrane thicknesses. 
Ballasted  EPDM roo fs, despite th eir co mparativ e 
energy ine fficiency, have  lower in stalled co sts th an 
any of t he alternatives.

Similar co sts an d con clusions  can be observed 
elsewhe re.  For instance , a recent project i n Chicago 
installed 140,000 square feet of roofing on a 
commercial b uilding.74 The tota l project cost  was 
$400,000 for materials and l abor. Thus, the installed 
cost was $2.86 pe r square foot, sim ilar to costs 
observed in Austin . The material selected wa s TPO.  
 
In this case , the choice of TPO was driven prim arily 
by the fact that  the T PO installed price was 5 percent 
lower th an that of PVC (wh ich is con sisten t with the 
Aust in data in Table 9). Labor estimates wer e 
equivalent for PVC  and TPO; the difference i n 
installed price reflected diff erences i n material costs. 
Give n sim ilar perform ance characteristics a nd 
warranties between PVC a nd TPO, t he contractor   
 
indicated that t his was a relatively sim ple decision i n 
whic h the  deci ding factor wa s materials price.  
 
Somewhat  higher costs, but the sam e gene ral 
concl usion— PVC is the  more expensive c hoice—can 
be found in rec ent expe rience in western 
Massachu setts. Two  similar sch ool buildings, in th e 
towns of Longmeadow and C hicopee, recently 
replaced roofs of about 120,000 square feet. The one 
that specified  vinyl paid $916,000, while th e one that 
did not s pecify a m aterial paid $679,000 for a TPO  
roof.75 The diffe rence in cost between t hese two 
roofs—roughly $7.60 versus $5.70 per square foot—
reflects not o nly material prices but also di fferences  
in labo r costs.

Alternatives to PVC, III: Flooring 76
 
 
Flooring manufactu rers so ld 7.9 billion square feet of 
hard floors in 2002, with a wholesale value of $7.1 
billion. Vinyl acco unted fo r 3.6 billion square feet, 
and $1.84 billion of t hese to tals—45  percent by area 
and 26 percent  by value. Roughly two-thirds of vinyl 
flooring is in stalled  in resid ential b uildings and one-
third in  commercial and  institutional buildings.77 
 
PVC primarily competes with o ther resilien t flooring 
materials—a category that includes  all m ajor fl oor 
surfaces e xcept wood, cer amic tile, and carpe t. 
Resilien t flooring options range from natural co rk 
and trad itional linoleum through syn thetic rub ber 
products and new non-chlorinated polymers. Vi nyl 
flooring is advertised  as a uniquely affo rdable, 
durable, an d easily maintained produ ct. Howev er, 
while vinyl gen erally m inimizes in itial co sts of 
purchase an d installatio n, it is no t usu ally th e longest-
lastin g choice, nor the easiest or cheapest to main tain. 
Its higher maintenance costs can act ually make it one 
the m ost expe nsive fl ooring  options on a life-cycle 
basis.  
 
Our an alysis starts with a descrip tion of the leading 
options  for resi lient floori ng, then com pares t he life-
cycle costs of t hese options , and concludes  with case  
studies of deci sions between vinyl and linoleum 
flooring in three cities.  
 
 
Resilient Fl ooring Opti ons 
 
Vinyl 
 
Vinyl flooring materials cont ain varying am ounts of 
plasticizers, sta bilizers, a nd fillers. Plasticizers m ake 
the nat urally rigid PVC  pliable. Howeve r, the vinyl 
can become brittle as th e plasticizer sep arates fro m 
the polymer over tim e; stabilizers a re used to sl ow 
this sep aration . A filler co mpound, generally 
pulverized limestone, is prese nt in vinyl composite 
tiles (VCT); some VCT pro ducts con tain as little as 
13 percent vinyl by weight.78  
 
Health c oncerns associate d with use of vi nyl flooring 
include  possi ble adverse  effec ts on re spirat ory health 
during ordinary use as  well as toxic em issions in case 
of fire. For example, a 19 99 study in Norway found 
an association bet ween use of  PVC  flooring in homes 
and increased  likelihood of bronchial obstruction in 
young children.79 In case  of fire, vinyl flooring can  
  
 
give rise to hydrochloric acid fumes, dioxin 
emissions, a nd other toxic substances (see ea rlier 
discussi on of fi re risks). 
 
These health c once rns, as well as life-cycle c ost 
calcu lations, hav e prompted interest in altern atives to 
vinyl flooring. A n umber of resilien t flooring 
altern atives are av ailab le, with v arying characteristics 
and adva ntages . 
 
Cork 
 
Cork is harvested from the cork oak tree (Queru s 
suber ), found mainly in Portugal, Spain, and North 
Africa. T he trees live to be  300 to 400  year s old; once 
they are 50 yea rs old, they ca n be harveste d every 
nine to ten years—a process that involves ca reful 
removal of only the outer layer of the bark, allowing  
the tree t o survive. Due to the infre quency of the 
harvest an d its expense, all h arvested  material, 
including the cork dust, is used. Some cork tiles also  
have  a recycled rubber bac king. 
 
After th e manufactu ring pro cess, co rk tiles are eith er 
left unfinished or finished with a wax or polyurethane 
topcoat. The most durable option, and the one best  
suited to commercial ap plicatio ns, is th e polyurethane 
topcoat; refin ishing with polyurethane is requ ired 
only e very three to four years.  
 
Cork can be extrao rdinarily lon g lastin g; some cork 
floors that were in stalled  in the early twen tieth 
century are still in  use. Ex amples include the US 
Depa rtment of Commerce B uilding in Washington, 
D.C., a nd St. Mary’s of the Lake C hapel near 
Chicago.80 
 
Linoleum 
 
A classic of de cades past, natural linoleum floor 
cove ring is made from renew able materials: linseed 
oil, pine or  other rosin, ground cork dust, wood flour, 
mineral fillers, and pigments. Lin oleum products, 
availab le in both  sheet and  tile, h ave a natural jute or 
polyethylene backing depe nding on the manufact urer. 
Due to its m aterial co mposition, linoleum is 
inherently an ti-static an d anti-bacterial. 
 
Of the raw m aterials that c ompos e linoleum , 
environmental conce rns have  been  raised about 
volatile org anic compound (VOC ) emissions 
associated with linseed o il. Howeve r, accordi ng to a

test performed by the California Depa rtment of 
Health Se rvices, the  average VOC em issions level for 
linoleum falls to ward  the low end of t he range of 
emissions by vinyl products and by carpets: 170 
microgram s of VOC s per square meter per hour for 
linoleum, compared to 80 to 600 for various carpets 
and 120  to 2300  for a range of vinyl products. 
Stratica (d iscussed below) h ad emissio ns of less th an 
10, which is below the level the test could detect.81 
 
Linoleum was once  manufact ured widely in the 
United States; however, as de mand bega n to fall in 
the 195 0s, the industry declin ed here, with the last  
US plant closing in 1975. Tod ay, natural lino leum is 
still p roduced in  Europe; an esti mated $20 to $25 
million w orth of linoleum is imported into the United 
States annually.82 The product’s image has  prospered, 
even  if the industry producing it did not: in building 
supply stores such as Hom e Depot, “linole um” now 
refers to a different product, namely vinyl floor 
cove rings designed to look like traditional linoleum.  
 
Non-vin yl Polymer Fl ooring: Stratica83 
 
Stratica is a proprietary resilient floor covering 
material manufactured by Amtico in both European 
and US plants. Its topcoat , DuPont’s Su rlyn, was 
originally de veloped as an out er surface for golf 
balls. Surlyn is  heat-fused to t he Stratica bas e and is 
respon sible for the floo r covering’s durability and 
low maintenance req uirements. It is th e resilien t floor 
material most sim ilar to vinyl flooring i n appearance , 
with a high-gl oss (yet low-m aintenanc e) surface. 
 
Stratica is a low-VOC  material that is non -allerg enic 
and mildew and odor resistant. In trodu ced to th e 
United States market in 1997, Stratica boasts a 100 
perce nt recovery rate for its post-industrial waste. 
Post-c onsumer Stratica waste  can be recycled into 
backing for more Stratica flooring ; howev er, facilities 
do not yet ex ist for this process in  the United States.  
 
 
Rubber  
 
Rubber floor covering, availab le in both tiles and  
sheet s, can be made from natural rubber, from 
recycled  automobile an d truck tires, or from synthetic 
rubber compounds including styrene butadiene 
rubber (SBR), ethylene propylene di ene monomer 
(EPDM), n itrile, or t he proprietary Nora rubber.  
 
Health  and environ mental co ncern s vary widely with  
the composition of the rubber floo r material.  Gen eral 
conce rns have  been  raised about VOC emissions and 
the overall i mpact o n indoor air qu ality, p articularly for products made from recy cled tires and/or styrene. 
Carbo n black dust, em itted by some rubber produ cts, 
also raises concern s abou t indo or air qu ality. Th e 
manufact uring process  for SBR products creates 
potential worker health hazards.84 
 
Rubber is also suitable for use under a wider range of 
conditions th an so me altern atives; both cork and 
linoleum tend to swell when exposed to consistent 
moisture. Rubb er flooring  has the adv antage of 
requiring  very litt le maintenance. 
  
 
Life-C ycle Co sts 
 
Data gathered from floor specialists and distributors 
in three cities--Au stin, Wash ington, and Ch icago--
reflect th e cost of materials an d installatio n, as well 
as regular maintenance requirements and e stimated 
costs for common maintenance fu nctions for heavily 
used commercial an d institutional floor space. 85 
Costs fo r lead ing resilien t flooring materials  over a 
20-year life  cycle are s hown i n Table 10.  
 
Table 10 shows th e initial co sts, exp ected life sp an, 
annual m aintenance c osts, and 20-year life-c ycle 
costs of selected bra nds in five categ ories of flooring 
materials: vinyl, cork, linoleum, non-chlorinated 
polymer (St ratica), a nd rubber. All costs are 
prese nted on a per square foot basis. The table 
demonstrates the substantial importance of 
main tenance co sts. 
  
Initial m aterial  and installatio n costs are as l ow as 
$2.65 per square foo t for vinyl tile an d range from 
$5.50 to $11.70 for other materials. Based on  initial 
material an d installatio n costs alo ne, an institu tion 
could spend as little as abo ut $2,700 to install 10 00 
square feet of vinyl composite tile (VCT), or two  to 
four times that amount for a higher-end floor. 
Thousands of dollars of i nitial sav ings are ap parently 
availab le by choosing vinyl tile—th e high-end rubb er 
floor shown in this tab le (Flexco -Radial, last line of 
Table 10) wou ld cost $9,000 more than vinyl tile for 
a 1000 square foot installatio n. 
 
Howev er, flooring installatio n rep resents a very sm all 
part of total cost when expressed in terms of cost per 
year of use. Far m ore im portant is th e annu al 
main tenance co st; th e data in Table 10 show that for 
heavy -traffic a reas m aintenance costs acc ount for at 
least 98 pe rcent of the life -cycle cost for eac h 
flooring material.86 The high-end rubber floor has the 
lowest maintenance costs per  square foot, and 
therefore the  lowest life-cycl e costs ove r all. Ove r 20 
years, it wou ld sav e more than $500 per squar e foot,

compared to the “lo w cost” v inyl tile. Co rk, the 
second-most expe nsive product in Table 10 in terms 
of first c ost, is the sec ond cheapest on a life-cycle 
basis due to its lo w maintenance co sts an d long

linoleum  is che aper tha n vinyl on a life -cycle basis,  
 although more expe nsive than seve ral of the other 
altern atives. In sho rt, the initial co st sav ings from

A similar conc lusion emerges  from a US Navy 
assessm ent of decking materials for its sh ips.87 In that 
assessm ent the Nav y tested  Stratica in  high-traffic 
areas (such as food s ervice are as) on ten ships, 
covering a total of 37,800 square feet. Du e to the 
heavy use, the estimates of the lifeti mes were sho rter, 
10 years fo r Stratica versus 5 for v inyl tile; the Nav y  
also found t hat Stratica re quired about one-third as 
much labor for m aintenance. The maintenance co sts 
were  by far the dominant factor, as s hown by the 
Navy ’s analysis of c osts over a ten-year s pan, 
summarized  in Table 11. The Navy estimates that the 
maintenance c osts per square foot per year (one-tenth 
of the ten -year main tenance an d rep air figures shown 
in Ta ble 11) are about $20 for Stratica and  $59 for 
vinyl, compared t o $32 for Stratica an d $52  for vinyl 
reported in Table 1 0. 
 
The high maintenance  costs shown in Tables 10 and 
11 may be interpreted  as worst-case estim ates, 
appropriate for the heaviest -use areas . For e xample, 
the Na vy’s food se rvice a reas on m ajor ships are 
presumably very high-traffic areas, wi th hundreds of 
sailors moving through them several  times a day . In  
  
contrast, m any offices, st ores, and institutions 
expe rience  much lowe r traffic and likely have 
corresp ondingly lower fl oor main tenance co sts.

However, the key concl usion to be drawn from 
Tables 10 and 11—vinyl tile is m ore exp ensive than 
other flooring options on a life-cycle basi s, due to its 
high maintenance c osts—would remain true even if

main tenance co sts were sub stantially lo wer. 
Recalculation of Table 10, a ssuming 1 pe rcent of t he 
reported maintenance  costs for eac h material, w ould 
still fin d both vinyl tile o ptions to  be more exp ensive 
over 20 years  than any of the altern atives. Ev en at 
this red uced level, maintenance co sts would still 
represe nt more than hal f of the life-cycle cos ts for 10 
of the 12 options i n Table 10. Similarly, recalculation 
of Tabl e 11 assuming 1 percent of the Navy ’s repair 
and maintenance co sts would still fin d Stratica to  be 
cheape r than vi nyl over 10 ye ars. 
 
 
The Mainte nance Cos ts Puzzle 
 
The c onclusion that vinyl flooring has higher life-
cycle costs tha n the altern atives rests on two facts 
shown in th e tab les ab ove. First, th e lower-co st vinyl 
option, VCT, has th e sho rtest lifeti me of any of the 
materials sh own in Tab le 10; its installed  cost per 
year of life span  is actually higher than for some of 
the altern atives (see co lumn C in Table 10). Secon d, 
the maintenanc e cost  per square foot is higher for 
vinyl than for an y of t he alternativ es. 
 
It may seem  surp rising that vinyl floors have  higher 
main tenance requirements than the altern atives in  
commercial an d institu tional settin gs. In contrast, 
sales of vinyl flooring to resi dential cu stomers rely 
on the claim  that vinyl is the  “maintenance free” 
choice. T here are several likel y expla nations for the  
differing evaluations of maintenance  needs. Virtually 
any commercia l or institutional floo ring gets heavier 
use than m ost resid ential fl oors; for t his reason , 
resid ential and  commercial v inyl floo ring are 
somewhat differen t in material co mposition, lead ing 
to differen t maintenance requ irements.88 In addition, 
there are often higher standards for glossy appea rance 
of floors in non residential areas, despite the heavier 
traffic. (See  the Austin case study, below, for more 
on high-gloss standa rds.)  
 
Because sta ndard maintenance re gimens for vinyl 
flooring represent significan t expenses, some 
commercial vinyl flooring products are starting to 
offer lower-maintenanc e options: for example, 
urethane  wear finishes that reduce  the frequency of 
strip and wax cycles, or  new commercial finish 
products that require only annual application and 
eliminate the need fo r stripping. Product 
devel opments of this kind could lead to reduced 
main tenance co sts in th e future. 89 The data in Tab le 
10 re flect price com parisons a s of 2003, based on 
actual industry data in several  regional markets. 
In add ition, chan ges in th e maintenance protocols for 
other flooring products could affect  their main tenance co sts as well. Forbo, a major vendor, 
promotes dry  maintenance of its linoleum flooring; 
this is a sou rce of sign ifican t main tenance-related  
savings when linoleum is used rather than vinyl. In 
contrast, Armstrong, another leading vendor, 
recom mends t he use  of higher-cost  polish and wet 
main tenance m ethods for lino leum in order to 
produce  a gloss finish similar to that of vinyl. The 
company conte nds that t his method has perform ance 
benefits as well, alth ough Armstrong’s warran ty is 
not affected by the cleaning regimen ado pted.90  
 
 
Case  Studies : Vinyl vers us Linoleum 
 
The cho ice amo ng rival materials for resilien t 
flooring is debated in countless desi gn projects, 
involving a mixture of econ omic, en gineering, an d 
environm ental considerations . To look m ore closely 
at the prospect s for alternative m aterials, we  
examined specific d esign decisions in buildings in 
Aust in, Washington, and Chicago —all of which 
involved the ch oice between linoleum and vin yl. Th e 
resul ts were  mixed: some found linoleum to be 
comparable to vinyl in performance and l ower in 
maintenance c osts, as  well as  prefe rable on 
environmental grounds; others faulted the 
performance of  linoleum, or were unable to resist the 
lower in stalled co st of vinyl. 
 
Austin, Texa s 91 
 
The University of Te xas at Austin has use d a variety 
of flooring material for student residence halls: 
linoleum flooring (both sheet and tile), vinyl sheet, 
and VCT flooring. Three university f loor areas in  two 
buildings have  used linoleum and vinyl products 
from the sam e supplier, Fo rbo.  
 
One building has a sh eet v inyl floo r installed  in the 
ground floor lobby, and  linoleum tile in the seco nd 
floor lobby. An older dormitory has linoleum sheet  
flooring. In the first building, the university is 
generally satisfied  with th e lino leum tile, b ut notes 
that it does not achi eve the sheen of the vinyl product 
on the first floor. Th at vinyl floor is th e university’s 
favorite in term s of maintenan ce an d app earance. 
 
In the building with the lino leum sheet in stallatio n, 
the lack of sheen is als o a concern; t here is a sense 
that the linoleum  doesn’t respond a s well as the sheet 
vinyl to spray buff maintenance bet ween 
reapplications of new polish. Thi s older building is 
subject t o periodic water leaks and t he linoleum  has 
bubbled as a result of water ex posure. Th e lack of 
moisture resistan ce ap pears to be the lino leum’s main

vulnerability. Leak s at building doo rways, wind ow 
leaks, a nd water fountains have created se veral 
urgent repair situations. A similar pattern of problems 
has not appeared w ith vinyl produ cts. 
 
Each  of the three in stallatio ns is nine to ten  years old. 
The university’s p erception is that the vinyl sheet 
product has been the easiest t o maintain, had the least 
problems, and upheld its appearance  the best. 
Because the se facilities are used 24 hours a day, 
every  day, application of new pol ish onl y occurs 
during shut-down periods between sem esters. Sp ray-
buffing is relied on for standard, frequent 
maintenance b etween rea pplications of  polish. 
 
In general , people expressed a surprising degree of 
conce rn about the lack o f a gloss fi nish on linoleum 
flooring. An adjustment in expectations might be 
expecte d as part of a m arket t ransformation process , 
so that individuals c ome to unde rstand t hat a floor 
does not  need to be gl ossy in order to be clean. Som e 
of the sa vings  available from  the use of linol eum 
disappear if the maintenance  protocols required for 
vinyl are used, unnecessa rily, in order to achieve t he 
same level of gloss found with vinyl flooring. It may 
be important to train maintenance c rews in the 
differences between vinyl and linoleum products. 
Without such training, in a build ing where bo th types 
of flooring are  prese nt, maintenance  staff may defa ult 
to known maintenance p rocedures, whi ch have been  
devel oped for vinyl.  
 
Washington, DC 92 
 
We e xamined two rece nt projects in Washi ngton. In 
one federal  building, the Government Services 
Administratio n (GSA) selected  linoleum to cover 
approximately 3,000 square feet instead of VCT. 
Installed costs for VC T were  estimated at $1.50 per  
square foot (even lower than the cost shown in Table 
10); thus it was about $5.00 per square foot cheape r 
than linoleum. Non etheless, lin oleum was cho sen for 
two reasons: first, a rapidly renewa ble and 
environment friendly product would com plement the 
Leadershi p in Energy a nd Environmental Design 
(LEE D) program for g reen building design; secon d, 
linoleum was projected to  cost less to  maintain over 
the life of the product tha n VCT. Project manage rs 
also took int o account the fact that the wear 
characte ristics of linole um are about t he sam e as 
VCT. 
  
In anothe r project, a m ajor architectural desi gn firm 
used linoleum for a 40,000 square foot renovation in 
its Washington office. The differen tial in  installed  
cost per square foot was a gain about $5.00 per square foot. The desi gners were wel l verse d in 
environmental su stain ability i ssues and  felt stron gly 
about using e nvironm ent frie ndly s urfaces i n the 
space. They ty pically reco mmend linoleum  in lieu of 
VCT in all of t heir projects.  
 
Chicago, Illinois 93 
 
The Int erfaith Single Room Occu pancy (SRO) 
project, under construction in Chicago in 2003, aims 
to provide perman ent hou sing for 63 sing le, ho meless 
wom en and six families. On e environmental goal  of 
the building d esign was to  choose materials with low 
VOC em issions. At t he sam e time, the proje ct had a 
tight budget. Both of these factors influence d flooring 
choices . 
 
As a nonprofit enterprise con structing a residen tial 
building, the Interfaith  SRO project faced d ifferen t, 
and lower, co sts th an commercial b uildings; 
maintenance requirements, in particular, are lower, 
since m any parts of the building will exp erience 
much less traffic than a n offic e or other busi ness 
estab lishment. Howev er, the gen eral pattern was t he 
same: vinyl floo ring had a lower first co st, while 
linoleum had lower m aintenance co sts an d a lo wer 
overall life-cyc le cost. 
 
Project m anagers originally in tended to  use linoleum 
because of its e ase of m aintenance as  well as  its low 
VOC em issions. Vi nyl, with its more co mplex 
main tenance requirements and potential to  aggravate 
respiratory problems, was not their preferred option. 
Howev er, the hig her first cost of linoleum installatio n 
was a bu rden for the project’s limited finances. In the 
course of research fo r this project, a supp ly of unused 
vinyl flooring was found in a closed factor y. As the 
flooring was head ed to  the lan dfill, u sing the m aterial 
was t hought to be a m ore environmentally sustainable 
option; and the installed price of the product was 
unusually low given the circumstances—l ess than 
half the price of ordinary VCT. 
 
Ultimately, project m anagers settled  on a 
compromise in which the resid ent’s ap artments and 
townhouses, acco unting for half the floor space in  the 
project, would have  the bargain-priced vinyl flooring 
and all public s paces woul d have linoleum . The vinyl 
product that was available would not  have been  
suitable for high tra ffic a reas, such as hallwa ys and 
recreation a reas, whe re the  linoleum  was placed. 
 
Lessons from Case Studies  
 
Our case  studi es, selected from  recent expe rience 
with environmentally consci ous (“green building”)

initiativ es, show th at the case fo r altern atives to vinyl 
is not yet as wi dely accepte d in flooring a s, for 
instance, in  roofing . Characteristics favo ring vinyl 
flooring include th e ease of m aintaining a trad itional 
high-glos s appearance  and t he appeal of l ow installed 
costs for severely budget-constrained buyers.  
 
Howe ver, our analysis sugge sts a num ber of 
additional consideration s that could tip the balan ce 
toward th e altern atives. Th e low installed  cost o f 
vinyl is often misleading; on a life-cycle c ost basis, 
other products are often cheaper. T here is a wide 
range of alternativ e materials, no  one of which is 
right for every applicatio n; one po ssible inference 
from  the case s tudies is t hat some green building 
efforts may have overemphasized l inoleum at the 
expe nse of other alternatives. C ork provides an 
equal ly natural, renewabl e flooring with a very long 
lifeti me and low m aintenance costs; rubber offers 
water resistan ce and  the lowest life-cycle costs in 
some circum stances; a nd Stra tica com bines a vinyl-
like, high-gloss app earance with minim al 
main tenance an d lower life-cycle co sts th an vinyl. 
Despi te some envi ronmental conce rns of their own, 
each of these a lternatives avoids t he toxic emissions 
associated with the PVC life c ycle.

Alternatives  to PVC, IV: Medical Supplies and Gloves 
 
Medical supplies acco unt for less than 3 percent of 
total PVC use.94 Nonetheless, PVC medical products 
have sign ificant an d troubling implicatio ns from a 
public healt h perspectiv e, due to leachi ng of 
plasticizers from  medical equipm ent as well as the 
hazard of dioxin form ation when m edical waste is 
incinerated . 95  
 
The bulk of PVC use in disposable medical de vices 
occu rs in three types o f products: gloves, bags, and 
tubing. Each  of these categ ories has multiple sub-
categories wit h distinct re quire ments. For e xample, 
the broad category of bags includes IV bags, which 
may hold medications, nutritional fluids, or saline 
solutions; total parenteral nutritio n bags, which are 
used to feed  patients intravenously when th ey can not 
eat; and a vari ety of ba gs use d to store bl ood, 
including bags for whole blood and bags for 
individual blood compone nts suc h as red blood cells 
or platelets. M ultiple altern atives to PVC ex ist in  
each a rea; ba gs can be m ade from  materials including 
nylon, ethyle ne vinyl acetate (EVA), polyet hylene 
(PE), polypropylen e (PP), and po lyolefins. Tubes can 
be made from materials in cluding silicon e, 
polyurethane, and rubber.96  
 
For the most part, th e raw m aterials av ailab le for 
manufact ure of PVC -free bags and tubes are 
somewhat more expensive than PVC on a per pound 
basis. Partially co unterbalancing this greater 
materials cost, some alternatives are i nherently 
stronger than PVC, requiring less ra w material fo r a 
similar product or providing greater d urability. In 
manufact uring PVC -free bags, for exam ple, 
manufact urers can part ially offset the higher 
materials cost  through downgauging (using a thinner 
sheet of the alternative product)  and elim inating extra 
materials (PV C bags m ust be wrapped in an extra bag 
to prevent volatilizat ion of plasticizers and resulting 
loss of flexibility before use; non-PVC  bags do not 
require t his overwrap).  
 
For e xample, leaching problem s arise with s ome 
types o f tubing. Like other pliable PVC products, 
PVC  medical tubing—which includes products 
ranging from IV tubes to parenteral nutrition systems 
to enteral feed ing tub es—d erives its flexibility fro m 
the addition of plasticizers.  These plasticizers leach 
out of the PVC tubing to varying extents, depending 
on how they are bei ng used. One rece nt study found 
that after 24  hours inside an infan t's sto mach, PVC 
feeding tub es had lost h alf their plasticizer co ntent.97  
  
In cases where the tubing is inside the patient's body , 
the leachi ng of plasticizers not only int roduc es a 
toxic sub stance directly in to the p atient's body, it also  
decreases th e flex ibility o f the tu bing over time. Th e 
health effects of plasticizer s in ch ildren’s bodies m ay 
be subtle or delayed, making them difficult to track, 
but if a feeding tu be becomes brittle and  unusab le, 
this effect is read ily observed. Alternatives s uch as 
silico n are su bstitu ted for PVC for l onger term  uses.  
 
 
Costs, Institutio ns, a nd Medica l Purcha sing 
 
There  is wide variation from one product category to 
the next in th e availab ility an d prices of non-PVC  
gloves, bags, and tub ing. In some cases, no n-PVC 
alternatives a re curre ntly available on t he market at 
competitiv e prices. For example, co st-co mpetitive 
alternatives are available for IV bags , platelet and 
fresh frozen plasma bags, a nd oxygen masks.98 In 
other cases , non-PVC alternat ives c ost more than 
PVC devices  but also prese nt clear pe rform ance 
advantages, such  as greater durability.  
 
The full cost implications o f choosing a given 
material involve a range of factors, including 
perform ance an d durab ility of th e produ ct. In 
addition, supp ly an d demand interaction s affect co sts 
over tim e. Dem and for products m ade from safer 
materials can provide  the impetus for manufacturers 
to invest in n ew eq uipment to laun ch productio n.  
  
The evolving institutional stru cture o f American  
medicine m akes it difficult to analyze the m arkets for 
individual medical su pplies. Health  care institu tions 
increasi ngly purchase  medical de vices via group 
purchasing organizations (GPOs). Through GPOs, 
health  care institu tions are often able to place larg e 
orders an d receiv e substantial d iscoun ts throug h 
bundling of purchases. A  vendor may supply many 
products, for use at many locations, under a single 
agreem ent with a GPO.  
 
Due to the size  and m arket power of th e institutions 
involve d, the prices actually  paid for medical de vices 
are affected by  the volume in whic h they a re 
purchased. Th e price of  an order of surgical gloves or 
IV bags, for example, is often negotiated as part of a 
larger pac kage that includes m any ot her m edical 
supplies. The neg otiated pr ice m ay depend on the 
total volume of the sup plies of all typ es bou ght by the 
GPO. Therefore, prices for the sam e good offered by 
 

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC  
 29
different vendors, or paid by differe nt purchasers, 
may not be strictly comparabl e to each other. 
  
Still, it is p ossible to make some b road compariso ns 
on the basi s of adve rtised prices. In the rem ainder of 
this sectio n, we fo cus on the factors that i nfluence  
choice of materials for m edical gloves i n particular. 
We l ook at variations i n prices of gloves intended for 
use in medical settings, using the prices quoted to us 
by a vendor—which may be hi gher than the price that 
would be negotiated by a major GPO.  
 
 
Glove s in Medical Se ttings 
 
Disposable gloves are used in medical settings t o 
prevent disease transmission and as a barrier to 
chem icals and chem otherapy drugs. Material s use d in 
high volume for examination gl oves, which are the 
focus of our discussi on here, include latex, PVC, and 
acrylo nitrile (also  known as nitrile). Other glove 
materials include neoprene, another chlorinated 
plastic; Elastrin, a  proprietary elastom er; and 
polyurethane. Surgical gloves may be made from 
materials in cluding latex  or nitrile; PVC is not 
approved by the FDA for use i n surgical gloves 
because it is not considere d strong enough for the 
conditions of surgery.  
 
In many hospitals, gloves are also used by food 
service workers to prevent direct contact between 
their hands and th e food they prepare. For  food 
servi ce set tings, polyethylene gl oves of fer a low-cost, 
effect ive option. These  gloves do not need to be of 
medical q uality sin ce th ey are no t acting  as protectio n 
against bloodborne pathogens.  
 
Latex allerg ies an d the need for alterna tives 
 
Latex , made from natural rubb er, was th e material o f 
choice in medical settings for many years. However, 
with rising frequency of glove use  in health care i n 
the late 198 0s and 199 0s, large nu mbers of health  
care workers and others developed allergies to 
latex .99 The mildest sy mptoms of latex  allerg y can  be 
similar to hay fever; m ore severe reacti ons include 
hives, asthm a, and da ngerous swelling of the  face, 
mouth, and airway. At its m ost sev ere, latex allerg ies 
can produce  anaphy lactic shock, a severe a nd 
frequently fatal reaction  that can  invo lve swellin g of 
the throat a nd a sudden decli ne in bl ood pressure . 
Thus, it has become imperat ive that health care 
institutions identify altern atives to  latex g loves in 
order to protect their workers, patients, and 
visitors.100  
 In the con text of increasing  problems with  latex  
allerg ies, m any health  care i nstitutions are now 
looking at the relativ e merits of vinyl and  nitrile 
gloves. While th ese altern atives are less  acut ely toxic 
than latex  to health care providers and patients, there  
is no  entirely no n-tox ic glove material o n the market. 
As we have seen, the manufacture and disposal of 
PVC  products is associ ated with the production and 
release of t oxic and persiste nt chem icals. 
Acrylon itrile can  also pose health hazard s as a 
pollutant at hazardou s waste sites where it has been 
discarded and i n air, s oil, and water near industrial 
facilities wh ere it is p roduced, alth ough acrylo nitrile 
breaks down relatively rapidly and doe s not  
bioaccumulate.101  
 
Most latex and many nitrile gloves contain 
accelerators—chem icals added to facilitate the 
manufact uring process  and e nsure that glove s are 
strong and resilient. Som e health care workers 
expose d to accelerators  in gloves ca n develop allergic 
contact dermatitis, a form  of skin irritatio n pro ducing 
itching and blisterin g lesion s similar to  those 
associated with a pois on ivy reaction.102 Som e 
companies now provi de accelerator-free nitrile 
gloves. While accelerator allergies ca n be a serious 
problem, they are not on the order of latex allerg ies, 
because they do not produ ce a syste mic reaction a nd 
are not as  widesprea d. 
 
Performance e valuation  
 
Glove performance ca n be judged in terms of 
multiple ch aracteristics, in cluding durability, barrier 
quality, and tactile p roperties. Barrier quality is th e 
ability o f a glove to prev ent transmission of 
pathogens carried in blood or other fluids and is 
linked to over-all d urability. Tactile p roperties refer 
to the extent to wh ich the glove allows normal 
sensat ion in the hand.  
 
Gloves ca n be subjecte d to a variety of tests to ga uge 
their reliab ility as a barrier t o disease tran smission. 
Some of these tests are re quired by the US Fo od and 
Drug Administration (FDA); others are voluntary. 
Testing re quirements depend on the intended use of  
the product; for example, gloves for use with 
chem otherape utic agents a re in the highest class and 
require m ore rigorous testin g than examination or 
surgical gl oves.103  
 
Most tests th at assess th e durab ility an d barrier 
quality of m edical ex am gloves are best suited to 
detectin g gross m anufacturing pr oblems. Often, the 
gloves are simp ly filled  with water and  tested  for 
leaks. More sen sitive tests have also been d eveloped

in which the glove material is placed i n contact with 
a fluid containing a virus, and the material is tested 
for permeability to the virus. For example, the ASTM 
F 167 1 test look s at t he ability of th e glove material 
to protect ag ainst blood-borne pathogens, such  as 
viruses.104 FDA does not require manufact urers to 
test glove effectiveness i n preventing movement of 
viruses ac ross t he glove m aterial, but some 
manufact urers carry  out this test voluntarily. Other 
tests are av ailab le to measure the ability o f gloves to 
protect agai nst chem icals us ed in m edicine, s uch as 
chem otherapy  drugs.  
 
A recent st udy compared barrier inte grity of l atex, 
nitrile, and  PVC g loves.105 The study l ooked at 
barrier i ntegrity of each gl ove type both in " static" 
conditions, in which the glove was sim ply removed 
from the box and tested , and  in conditions of activ ity, 
in which the glove was manipulated to simulate 
actual use  in health care. T he gloves  were subjected 
only to th e test  for water leak ing; more sen sitive tests 
were no t attemp ted.  
 
The researc hers found dram atic diffe rences i n the 
gloves' barrier integrity after manipulation s 
simulating the kinds of activ ity for wh ich gloves are 
comm only used, s uch as connecting a nd 
disconnecting a syringe or wrapping, taping, and 
unwrapping a blunt object.  
 
The researc hers tested four  brands each of vinyl and 
latex gloves, and two brands of nitrile gloves. They 
found that for all nitrile an d latex  gloves tested , the 
failure rate ran ged from 0 to 5 perce nt. For viny l 
gloves, there was greater variation am ong brands; 
three bra nds ha d failure rat es from 1 perce nt to 3 
percent when used  directly out of the box, wh ile the 
fourth had a 12 percent o ut-of-box failure rat e. The 
highest failure rates appeared in vinyl gloves tested 
after simulated  use; these h ad failu re rates ran ging 
from 12 perce nt to 61 percent .106 Table 12 shows th e 
avera ge failure  rates observed by the  resea rchers for 
each m aterial, bot h for gloves  tested directly out of 
the box without manipulation and for gloves tested 
after manipulations simulating normal use.  
 
The study notes th at PVC has relativ ely po or barrier 
qualities du e to its m olecular stru cture; ev en when 
plasticizers are add ed, “v inyl still lack s the ability to  
stretch whe n stresse d or snagged, and readily 
fractures, tears, or se parates at  the m olecular level 
resulting in barrier loss.” 107 The authors  conclude that  
nitrile and  latex  gloves are si gnifican tly m ore 
resistan t than vinyl to break ing down or leakin g 
during use. Out o f box Simulated use

Vinyl glov e examples include both standard

In the case  of latex, pores i n the material sometimes 
allow visible le akage; m edical staff m ay find 
patients’ blood on their hands after wearing 
apparently in tact g loves. The Sustaina ble Hospitals 
Project at University of  Massa chusetts-Lowel l has 
even recei ved anecdotal  reports of hospital 
practitio ners in an emergency department who  
routinely pu t on a double layer  of latex g loves to 
avoid this problem.108  
 
 
Durability a nd to tal utiliza tion cost  
 
The sup erior barrier qu alities an d durab ility o f nitrile 
mean that the  differe nce i n cost, relative t o 
performance, is no t as great as it appears  from  the 
unit prices listed  here. A 1999 analysis by Kaiser 
Perm anente, the n ation’s largest no t-for-profit health  
care o rganization, foun d that on a total utilizatio n 
cost basis, n itrile gloves were co st competitive with 
the altern atives, du e to their greater du rability.109 On 
the ba sis of t his analysis, Kaiser Pe rmanente decide d 
to switch  to nitrile, pu rchasing 43 million nitrile 
gloves.110  
 
The data used in Kaiser Perm anente ’s cost analysis 
are not a vailable. As  noted above , health ca re 
institutions generally purchase  medical suppli es, 
including gloves, thr ough large c ontracts that include 
multiple typ es of equipment and supp lies. Negotiated 
prices for these contracts m ay depe nd on an 
institution’s to tal volume of purchases and  are 
generally lo wer th an publicly av ailab le “list p rices.” 
(In gene ral, anyone p urchasing 43 million items 
might expect to get the lowest possible price per 
item; other medical in stitutions are lik ely to m ake 
smaller, b ut still su bstantial, glo ve purchases.) 
Nonetheless, it is po ssible to gain some insight into 
price differen ces b y comparing  publicly av ailable list 
prices. Act ual prices paid by health  care institu tions 
are lik ely to  be lower t han th ese list p rices.

Medical gloves  com e in a wi de va riety of sizes and 
specifications. Glove c haracte ristics that m ay vary 
from one product to another include glove length, the 
diameter of th e wrist opening, the thickness of the 
material, han d orientation (right and left hand gloves 
produce d separately, or am bidextrous gloves), 
durability, an d the lev el of quality test ing that h as 
been app lied to th e product.  
 
Table 13 shows th e prices of vinyl, latex, and  nitrile 
medical exam  gloves a vailable through the distributor 
Fisher Scientifi c. The gloves used for this exa mple 
are sold unde r the distri butor’s nam e, as a Fi sher 
brand product, and are among the distributor’s most 
commonly sold varieties. ( They are, ho wever, 
manufact ured by three diffe rent com panies.) T he 
three e xamples exam ined here  were ide ntified by 
Fisher Scientific sales staff as being broadly 
comparable to one anothe r. All are size large , powde r 
free, m edical exam  grade  gloves. A ccording to  the 
sales staff, powde red gloves would cost less  for eac h 
material, but the ratio among the prices would be 
approximately the sam e.111 
 
The quality stan dards that the gloves meet are no t 
identical; in  several respects, the stand ards are lower 
for vinyl. For example, the percent age of leaks 
allowed is higher for th e vinyl gloves than for th e 
latex  or nitrile g loves.112 The minimum standards for 
strength and elongation of examination gloves are 
also lower fo r vinyl gloves than  for latex  and nitrile 
gloves.113  
  
Based on the prices availa ble directly from Fisher 
Scientific, when gloves are purchase d in case s of 10 
boxes (1000 gloves) eac h, nitrile gloves cost twice as 
much as vi nyl gloves.114 The bulk discount available for cases  of 1000 gloves is the maximum bulk 
discount offered to us by Fisher, so these prices pe r 
glove wo uld apply for larger orders as wel l.  
 
If gloves never failed (or all t ypes failed  at the sam e 
rate), a nd equal num bers were used for a task 
regardless  of the choice of material, then the prices in 
column B would  describ e the relativ e costs of 
different gloves. In particular, using nitrile gloves 
would cost twi ce as m uch as using PVC gloves.  
 
Howe ver, because of durability diffe rences a mong 
glove materials , it makes more sen se to consider the 
avera ge cost per glove use . Thus we bu ild in a 
“durability facto r” to reflect the av erage measured 
failure rate for each glove type, using the “sim ulated 
use” failure rates from Tabl e 12. With this approach , 
we m ake the as sumption that i n every instanc e in 
whic h a glove fails the user di scards it and puts on a 
new glove. In other words, we assum e that vinyl 
gloves will be discarded and replaced due to failure 
in 30 percent of all u ses, while nitrile and  latex will 
be discarded a nd replaced due to failure  only 2 
perce nt of the time. Thi s assumption is an 
approximation for th e more com plicated  reality, in  
which some glove failures go un detected  while in  
other cases , health care profe ssionals  may wear a 
double layer  of gloves du e to concerns about the 
gloves leaking or breaking.  
 
As Tab le 13 shows, building in this du rability facto r 
decrease s the cost difference  between vinyl and 
nitrile from about  seven cents per glove to less th an 
five ce nts per glove use. Thus, the differential is 
reduced by abou t a th ird through the incorporatio n of 
the durab ility facto r.

Anecdo tally, th ere are other advantages to switch ing 
to nitrile as well. For ex ample, the Sustain able 
Hospitals Project has been in co ntact with  hospitals 
that found certain important, though non quantified, 
practical b enefits asso ciated  with switch ing to  nitrile 
acros s the board a nd elim inating all othe r glove 
materials. One  hospital that previously stocked over 
80 different glove types a nd brands was a ble to 
switch  to fewer th an ten when the hospital beg an 
purchasing only nitrile g loves; in  addition, the 
hospital no l onger ha d to make special a rrangem ents 
for su sceptible staff t o avoid latex. The switch  also 
eliminated the  need to educate staff about which 
glove types were safe for varied uses a nd settings.115 
 
Glove c osts in context 
 
How m uch of a differe nce glove prices m ake to a 
health  care institu tion’s overall b udget depends on 
how many gloves are consumed  per patient an d how  
much the institution spends per patient as a whole. 
The fede ral National Hospital Indicators Survey 
provides overview  statistics on  expenditures and revenues at c ommunity (n on-teaching) ho spitals in 
the US. These hospitals were estimated to spen d 
$1,318 per patient day for inpatien t care, and $2 65 
per outpatien t visit.116  
 
These t otal cost figures can be used to put glove costs 
in context. For exam ple, if  five pairs of gloves ( ten 
individual gloves) are used  per patient-day, switching 
from PVC  to nitrile gloves would increase glove 
costs per patient-day from slightly under a dollar a 
day to slightly under $1.50 a day, a difference of 
about 48 cents in total ex penditu res per patient-day, 
or an increase of less than 0.04 perce nt of total 
expenditures per inp atient patient-day. If ten p airs of 
gloves (twenty individual gloves) are required per 
patient-day, the switch would increase  costs by about 
one dollar, or l ess than one-twelfth of a percent (less 
than 0. 08 perce nt) of expenditures per patient-day. 
The costs discussed here , of cou rse, do not include 
any calcu lation of th e costs of illnesses th at co uld be 
transmitted due to  glove failures.

Alternatives to PVC, V: Siding and Windows 
 
 
The fast est-growing uses of PVC, and  the larg est 
after pipes, are vinyl siding and windows. As seen  in 
Table 1, ea rly in this report, siding and windows 
expe rienced double-digit annual growth rates 
throughout the 1990s and  now represent about 2 0 
percent of all PVC use in th e US and  Canada. Here 
we examine these areas  briefl y; our discussi on of 
siding relies heavily on the Au gust 2003 Consumer 
Reports  survey, which offered a com prehensi ve 
review of the available alternatives. Ou r discussion of 
windows draws on  a nu mber of construction in dustry 
sources . 
 
Siding117 
 
Vinyl is now the most com mon siding material for 
low- and moderate-priced housin g, but it is not the 
only product on the market. Wood shingles or 
clapboard als o offer via ble siding alternatives , as do 
fiber cem ent and sim ulated stucco. Alum inum , an 
important altern ative in th e past, has all bu t van ished 
from the market and is not discusse d here. 
 
Vinyl 
 
Vinyl siding is available in a variety of colors, 
thicknesses, and  qualities. Installatio n is easy , and 
vendors tout vinyl as "m aintenance  free." Vinyl is 
known fo r its ab ility to  mimic other looks such as 
wood . It is often said to be resistan t to water damage; 
it is also  impervious to insects.  
 
Unfortunately, vinyl siding can warp if it gets too hot. 
It is also sensitiv e to cold temp eratures, which can 
cause it to ch ip or crack  and beco me brittle, an d it 
expa nds and contracts with temperature changes. 
Many hom e improvem ent sources c ontest t he 
common cl aim that vinyl is not dam aged by water; it 
is often acknowledg ed th at when cleani ng or painting 
vinyl, a homeowne r must, much as  with wood siding, 
be ca reful to remove al l mildew prior to adding a coat 
of paint. Vinyl presents the add itional problem that it 
can bu rn or sm older, threatening the health an d safety 
of people in or near  a burning house, as wel l as the 
health a nd safety of firefi ghters.  
 
Vinyl generally fad es with time, alth ough some 
higher end sidings now include UV protection to 
limit the am ount of fading that can occu r. Once the 
color has fade d, it may need  to be pai nted, requiring 
specific paints and processes t o ensure the desired   
 
look. After the vinyl has been p ainted, it will need to 
be repainted in time, alth ough th e frequency depends 
on the quality o f paint used—h igh-qu ality p aint can  
last u p to ten years, whereas lo wer-qu ality p aint may 
last only four years. According to Electrospec Home 
Inspection Se rvices notes, be cause of the heat 
absorption of vinyl, a homeowne r needs to be ca reful 
not to paint the vinyl a color any darker than the 
original co lor.118   
 
Wood 
 
Wood siding is also  easy t o install, alth ough not as 
easy as vi nyl. It has t he added value of being the 
preferred look for housing: vinyl and fiber cement 
siding both see k to emulate the appeara nce of wood 
siding. Wo od can be pu rchased finished or left 
natural, an d it is im pact resistan t, even in  cold 
temperatures . 
 
Wood siding, though, can warp, twist, or be damaged 
by water if not properly m aintained. It is also 
vulnerable to insect damage and  burns readily. In 
order to maintain woo d siding prop erly it do es need 
to be painted or  stain ed repeatedly, alth ough  how 
frequently this is required depends on the quality of 
the pai nt used and on t he climate. 
 
Fiber ce ment  
 
Fiber cem ent is a newe r alternative to wood and vinyl 
siding and is mad e primarily fro m a co mbination of 
cement, sand, and cellulose  fibers. According to 
Georg ia-Pacifi c, it is in stalled m uch like woo d, 
although carbide or diamond head blades or shears, 
which are stronger than ordinary sawblades, are 
suggested  in ord er to preserve the blades . (According 
to arc hitect Bruce Ham pton, some contract ors "ca rry 
the cost of a saw with eac h new job" for la rge scale 
projects, because the dust da mages the sa w over 
time.)  
 
The l ook created by fiber ce ment can vary from  
rough sawn  cedar to stucco, depending on its 
embossing. Fiber cem ent is available in a number of 
forms, such  as planks or octagon shaped shingles, 
and can be  purchase d alrea dy prim ed and painted. It 
does not warp  or twist, is im pact resistan t, and is 
impervi ous to insects. Unlike vinyl siding, it does not 
expa nd and contract, nor does it burn or smolder in a 
fire.  
 

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC  
 34
Fiber cem ent does need to be painted, but it requires 
painting less frequently th an wood  siding: Georg ia-
Pacific notes t hat some third parties guarantee their 
coatings for  twen ty year s. How ever, although  fiber 
cement itself  does not burn, products app lied to  it 
may. It may also be damaged by water freez ing and 
thawing . The material d ata sheet fo r Hard iplan k, a 
brand of fi ber cem ent, warns that the product 
contains silica. In haling silica du st during 
manufact uring or construction work can cause 
silico sis, a devastatin g lung  disease. Th is is a 
potentially co ntrollable problem; b ut unless t he silica 
dust is controlled, fiber cem ent production and 
installatio n presen t health  hazards to the work ers who  
make and install it. 
 
Simulated stu cco 
 
Simulated  stucco is a relativ ely new pro duct on the 
market, offering a very distinct appea rance. 
Sometimes called Exterior Insu lation Finish Syste ms 
(EIFS), it uses a polymer-based outer co ating that 
contains plastic resin, which makes it softer and  more 
flexible t han cement-base d stucco, over a cement 
board sheathing.119 If it is no t app lied properly, the 
material may trap  moisture and  allow th e growth  of 
mold, problems which have sparked a number of 
lawsu its. If imp roperly app lied, simulated  stucco 
cann ot be fi xed; it must instead be repl aced, possibly 
along with the wood structural com pone nts behind 
the EIFS barrier.120 Altho ugh it is im pervious to 
insects, it can  crack, requ iring  it to be refinished, and  
it can  burn.  
 
Costs 
 
The cost of each of these p roducts vari es, depending 
on the quality o f the siding. Consumer Repo rts  
compared t he material cost s and estim ated lifetim es 
of high- a nd low-quality  siding of each of the 
alternatives, as  shown i n Table 14. Some anecdotal 
reports  suggest  a shorter life span for vi nyl,121 but we 
use the Consumer Repo rts estimates for all materials  
 for the sake of consisten cy. A si mple additional 
calcu lation, shown in the last two columns of Tab le 
14, demonstrates that the  material cost per year is 
lowest for fiber cem ent among lower-q uality sid ing 
options, and for wood among the higher-quality 
options . (This i s not a c omplete life-cycle cos t 
calculation, since it does not include installation and 
main tenance co sts.) 
 
Windows 
 
As in the case of siding, vinyl has become widely 
used for windows in low- and moderate-p riced 
constru ction, but it is no t the only option on the 
mark et. Alternativ es to vinyl wind ows include wood , 
fiberglass, and aluminum windows. T here are also 
options for repairing old wood windows to improve 
their e nergy efficiency. E nergy efficiency is a major 
conce rn influencing the choice of new or replacem ent 
windows.  
 
Vinyl 
 
The benefits an d drawbacks of vinyl window s are 
similar to those of vinyl siding. Vinyl windows do 
not rot, but they are sen sitive to both ho t and cold 
temperatures , can becom e brittle, and ca n inc ur dents. 
Often sold as “maintenance free,” vi nyl wi ndows  
raise so me of the sam e issues discussed in  connection  
with maintenance of vinyl siding. In addition, the 
fiberglass i ndustry (i.e., th e supplier of a com peting 
product) notes that of all window materials, vinyl has 
the greatest rat e of th ermal expansion , which can  
cause t he seal of the window to brea k early. If this 
does occu r, vinyl windows cannot be fi xed and must 
instead be repl aced.122 
 
Fibergl ass 
 
Fiberglass is a newe r product in windows, and many 
contracto rs and sup pliers have little ex perience with  
it. Accord ing to the fiberglass in dustry, fi berglass is 
an extremely st rong material: three tim es stro nger

stronger than vinyl. It does not rust, rot, warp, 
corrode, crac k, or dent. It has the lowest thermal 
expa nsion rate of all of the window types, 
guaranteeing a tight seal. Fiberglass windows are 
often Energy Star products. T hey com e in st anda rd 
colors, ca n have a wood veneer, ca n be painted to 
match any  color scheme, and can be repai nted.123  
Both fiberglass and  chemicals often  used with 
fiberglass also pose hazards to hum an healt h.124  
 
Wood 
 
Wood  wind ows are t raditional, and , as with siding, 
wood c reates the look that  altern atives im itate. Wood 
windows can be r epaired an d main tained so that they 
are as e nergy efficient as  vinyl windows .125 Wood is 
also an easier material to  work  with for cu stom 
window fits. The drawbacks of wood windows are 
identical to wood siding: they require painting, may 
rot, wa rp, become insect infes ted, c ondense, or be  
damaged by  moisture.126 They c an also burn. 
Although wood  windows do not expand at the rate 
that vinyl does, th ey do  expand quite a bit mo re than 
fiberglass or even aluminum.127 
 
Many wood fra mes that are replaced by vinyl could 
have  easily been repai red and, with weat her stripping, 
can becom e as energy efficient as vi nyl windows . 
Repairing  wood  wind ows m ay be a better al ternative 
to retain th e historical ch aract er of a buildi ng and to 
cut dow n on waste.128 For historic r enovation, repai ring wood windows or replacing them with new 
wood windows is of ten the only option.  
 
Alumi num 
 
Aluminum windows are often used to com ply with 
building codes for three-story and higher residential 
and comm ercia l buildi ngs.129 Aluminum is a strong, 
durable m aterial that does not rust and does not 
normally require paint, althoug h there are some 
reports that the  facto ry finish may wear off after 
about 20 years, m aking pai nting nece ssary at  that 
point. Although  aluminum has slig htly higher thermal 
expansion than fib erglass, it has less th an the other 
window products, en suring a stronger and longer-
lastin g seal.130 However, thermal brea ks m ust be 
adde d to aluminum windows to make them ener gy 
efficient. 
 
Costs 
 
Window costs vary widely based on size, style, and 
quality; few v endors offer precisely co mparable 
windows made of the full range of materials. One 
California vendor quoted prices, as of late 2003, for a 
6x4 foot window , of $190 in alu minum, $225 in 
vinyl, $250 in fiberglass, and $300 in wood.131 As 
with siding or ot her products, differences in 
installatio n cost, m aintenance and rep air cost, and  
lifetime coul d be m ore important than these 
differences in purchase pri ce.

Employment Impacts of a PVC Phaseout 
 
 
Replacing PVC with  safer altern atives will ch ange 
some jobs: from fabri cating PVC  products to 
fabricating the same prod ucts from other m aterials, 
often other plastics; or from making vinyl chloride 
monom er and PVC resin to making safe r substitutes 
(agai n, often other plastics). In many cases, t he sam e 
workers who c urrently m ake PVC products  are likely 
to be employed m aking similar products from PVC  
altern atives. 
  
More general ly, the money  that is now spent on PVC 
products, the uses of those products, and the jobs 
created  by production and use of PVC will not 
disappear fro m the eco nomy in the tran sition to 
altern ative materials. Th e skills th at are needed  to 
make many products out of PVC will still b e needed 
to make the same p roducts out of so mething else; 
there is no evidence th at the substitutes would require 
less labor or that resources s pent on clea n alternatives  
create fe wer jobs t han res ources spe nt on PVC.  
 
 
Size of the Industry 
 
It is su rprising ly difficu lt to determin e the total 
number of workers who are employed in making 
PVC  and PVC products. Industry sources report that 
there a re 126,000 worke rs in PVC fabrication  plants; 
in addition, as explained below, we estim ate from the 
limited  available d ata that there are 9,000  or fewer 
workers m aking vinyl chloride monom er (V CM) and 
PVC resin.  
 
The 1997 Ec onom ic Census, t he source of the latest 
available det ailed government data on employment 
by industry, reports that some 826,000  workers were 
employed in plastic product manufact uring of all 
types. Howev er, most of th at total is no t broken down 
by type of plastic or product.132 Industry sources 
report e ven larger totals: accordi ng to t he Society for 
the Plastics Industry, t here were 1.5 million wo rkers 
in the plastics industry and another 850,000 
employed in upstream  industries that supplied the 
plastics in dustry in  2001.133 These figures refer to the  
plastics industry as a whol e; most plastics industry 
workers are not involved with PVC. 
 
Turning specifically to  PVC an d related activ ities, 
another industry group, the Alliance f or Responsible 
Use of Chlorine Ch emistry (ARCC), claims th at there 
are 482,000 workers in chl orine-related jobs . This 
total in cludes 180,000  employees of  dry clean ing establishments, most of whom use perchloroethylene, 
a chl orinated dry cleaning fluid.134 Aside fro m dry 
cleaning, t he core of the  ARC C employm ent data 
consists of  two categ ories: 126,000 workers at PVC  
fabricating plants, and 170,000 workers at  chlorine-
producing and chlorine-using chem ical plants.  
 
Note that the chlorine-producing and chlorine-using 
plants (which are co mbined in th e ARCC 
employment figures) are not all involved in the PVC 
life cycle. So me of th e plants are larg e, multi-produ ct 
chem ical indus try facilities with significa nt num bers 
of workers making products unrelated to PVC or 
chlorine. Among the chlorine-using plants, there are 
enterprises m aking other products such as pesticides, 
paper mill ch emicals, so lvents and  dry cleanin g fluid. 
Plants invo lved in th e PVC  life cycle are  a small 
fraction  of the chlorine-producin g and chlorine-using 
categ ory reco rded by ARCC. Ou r best guess, 
explained below, is that no more than about 9,000 
workers, a nd possibly fewe r, are em ployed i n 
production of vinyl chloride m onom er (VCM) and 
PVC resin. 
 
The data for the US as a  whole and for the  eleven 
states id entified  by ARCC as the ind ustry lead ers are 
shown in Table 15. The PVC fabricating plants are 
smaller an d pay less, with a natio nal average of 54 
workers pe r plant and pay roll of $27,000 per worker. 
The chlorine-producing and chlorine-usi ng plants are 
larger and pay  more, avera ging 376 workers per  plant 
with a payroll of more than $4 5,000  per worker. 
 
Yet another industry source, the Chemica l Economics 
Handbook, periodically publishes in-depth reports on 
vinyl chloride monom er (VC M) and PVC  resin 
production. The latest available reports  appe ared in 
Decem ber 2000 for VCM, and Septem ber 2003 for 
PVC.135 In 2000 there were 12 VCM plants in the 
US, with th e cap acity to  produce 17.4 billion  pounds 
of VCM, as shown in Table 16. Seve n of the 
facilities, accounting for m ore than hal f the capacity, 
were lo cated join tly with  PVC  plants own ed by the 
same company. 
 
As of mid-2003, ten companies produced PVC resin 
in the US at twen ty location s, as shown in  Table 17, 
for a total capa city of 15.8 billion pounds. Three 
other plants were idled by the recession , with an 
additional cap acity o f 1.2 billion pounds.

Employment at these plants is not consistently 
reported in an y published source. Th rough website 
search es an d telep hone inquiries we were ab le to 
obtain em ployment data for 14 of the 20 facilities, as 
shown in Table 17. These  data vary in definition 
from one pl ant to another.  In at least one  case, an 
important category of contractor em ployees was not 
included. In some other cases,  including the two 
largest  employment entries in Tabl e 17 (the workers 
at the Formosa and  OxyVinyls Tex as facilities), t he 
data include other workers as well as those making 
PVC resin.  
 
Since m any facilities p roduce more than on e produ ct, 
it is h ard to avo id uncertain ties in the delineatio n of 
PVC  employment. Nonetheless, using the figures in 
Table 17 in the abse nce of better dat a, the plants 
where we have employment data avera ge 2.82 
million pounds of PVC capacity per worker. If this 
ratio applied to th e other plants as well, to tal 
employment in the plants that make PVC  resin would 
be about 5,600. Ou r guess is t hat this is, if anyth ing, a 
high estim ate, although we are unable t o produce  a 
better fi gure. 136

We do not have sepa rate employment data for VCM 
production; in cases of joint produ ction at the sam e 
location, some VCM employment may be included in 
our PVC resin employment estimate. The 
Environment Canada  study of chlorine-related 
industries (disc ussed early in this repo rt in connection  
with the costs of altern atives) id entifies one Canadian 
plant where 200  workers were producing VCM, with 
production of at least 4.71 million pounds per 
worker. If th is ratio applied to US VCM production 
today , there would be about 3,700 workers making 
VCM at th e 12 facilities sh own in Tab le 16 (some of 
whom have al ready  been included in our estimate of 
PVC resin w orkers). Again, t his is, i f anything, too 
high a n estim ate.137 
 
Our estim ates are the refore 5,600 or fewer workers 
producing PVC r esin, an d 3,7 00 or fewer workers 
making VC M, with an unce rtain amount of double-
counting between  the two  categ ories. In sum, the 
number of workers producing VCM and PVC resin is 
roughly 9,000 or less. These workers are o nly a small 
fraction of the much larger num ber of em ployees in 
chlorine-producin g and chlorine-using plants in Table 
15. In add ition, as sh own in Tab le 15, there are  
 
  
roughly 126,000 workers at PV C fabricatio n plants.  
That is, m ost of the  workers employed in P VC-
related industri es are fabricator s, no t VCM/PV C 
production workers. 
 
Effects on P VC Workers 
 
A co mplete PVC ph aseou t will n ot happen overnight. 
But, over a period of years, it will ch ange the jobs 
that are performed in our economy. Many workers 
will find  themselves doing the sam e job with 
different materials; for exam ple, the sam e products 
may be fa bricated at  the same plants, but out of 
different plastics. A s the momentum builds for a PVC 
phaseout, the owners of fabrication pl ants will seek 
activ ely to  keep up with th e changing market.  
 
In many cases, plants  with the  capacity to 
manufact ure PVC products have the capacity to 
manufacture alter native products as w ell, alt hough 
different equipment may be required. For example, 
the PVC Conta iner C ompany manufact ures plastic 
bottles fro m both PVC an d polyeth ylene 
terephthalate (PET). Accordi ng to a  com pany 
represen tative, PVC an d PE T bottles are m ade with  
diffe rent equipment, but are  manufact ured at the 
 

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC  
 39
same facili ty.138 In other cases , PVC  products 
distributed within the US are fabricated overseas. For 
exam ple, the medical gl oves discusse d in the section 
on m edical supplies, a bove, are all manufact ured in 
Asia. Omni International gloves are m anufactured in 
countries i ncluding China, Malaysia, an d Thailan d; 
High Five gloves are m anufactured in either China or 
Taiwan; a nd Kimberly Clark gloves a re 
manufact ured in Thailand.139 Thus, switching among 
the glove types we ha ve di scussed he re wo uld 
appa rently have no employment consequenc es wi thin 
the US. We did not investigate the effect on 
employment in the producing countries; we d id learn 
that gloves pr oduced for Kimberly Clark are  
manufact ured at a single plant, which has a separat e 
production area for eac h glove material and employs 
different equipment for eac h type.  
 
In the case  of large PVC products, such as pipes, 
equipment requirem ents m ay differ for production 
using altern ative materials. Ho wever, many 
companies produce  or use a  diversi fied set of plastics, 
so ceasi ng sale s of PVC produ cts would like ly lead to 
a shift within the company, no t putting the company 
go out of business. As mentioned abov e, for example, 
J-M Manufacturing has rece ntly diversi fied to begin 
producing PE i n addition to PVC p ipe. Ano ther 
interestin g example is W estlak e Chemical 
Corporation , a vertically in tegrated  company that 
produces  both VCM and PVC while also producing 
altern atives, inclu ding polyeth ylene. Westlak e’s 
fabricated  products in clude both  PVC and 
polyethylene pipe, am ong other products.140 In a 
similar vein, CertainTee d Corporation produces a 
variety of PVC products, but also produces fiber 
cement siding, one of the promising al ternatives to 
vinyl siding.141 While the em ploym ent practi ces of 
such companies will v ary from  case to  case, 
corporate diversificatio n creates th e possibility o f 
retain ing and reassig ning work ers wh en PVC is 
phased ou t. 
 
Workers who make VC M and PVC resin would not 
necessa rily be out  of work if PVC is ph ased out: in 
many cases PVC will b e replaced by other 
petrochem ical products, such as non-chlorinated 
plastics or synthetic rubber, which may be m ade by 
the sam e com panies or in the same communities that 
now make VCM and  PVC. Thus there will b e new 
jobs to be filled  making the altern ative materials, 
whic h current VCM and PVC workers  coul d well 
perform. 
 
At th e same time, it is p ossible th at some workers 
will n ot find jobs making the altern atives. Ev en if t he 
old jobs are  replaced with new ones, the labor m arket does not  automatically move the displaced workers 
into the new positions. The threat of some job 
turnover is not unique to the question of chemical 
phaseouts; rat her, it occurs with any larg e-scale 
policy sh ift.  
 
The c hanges that would result from a PVC  phaseout 
are not large relativ e to the ong oing turnov er of 
employment in the US ec onomy. Jobs  are constantly 
being eliminated, a nd other jobs creat ed, in enormous 
numbers.  In the 12-month period from August 2002 
through July 20 03, when total US em ployment 
decrease d by 170,000 jobs , there were actually 
48,150,000 new hires and 48,320,000 separations 
(quits, retirem ents, lay offs, and firings).142 In 
manufact uring alone, which was particularly hard hit 
in the same period, losing just over a million jobs, 
there were 4,00 0,000  new hires and  5,020,000 
separation s. That is, in  addition to th e net loss of a 
million m anufacturing jobs, there was t urnover of 
another four million jobs—an av erage turnover of 
11,000 manufacturing jobs per day, every day of the 
year. If every job in VCM and  PVC resin pro duction 
were  replaced by a diffe rent job producing substitute 
materials in a differe nt plant, this would amount to 
less th an on e day’s average turnover of US 
manufact uring employment.  
 
Nonetheless , the replacem ent of jobs i n VCM and 
PVC  production with jobs in other industries could 
impose a real burde n on the affected workers  (just a s 
employment turnov er of all sorts frequ ently do es). If 
substitu te materials are produced  at the sam e or 
nearby locations, the displaced wo rkers co uld be 
offered em ployment in the plants making the new 
materials; b ut this may not solve the entire pro blem. 
Providing protectio n and support for workers wh o 
lose their job s is an in escap able prob lem of public 
policy, both for the small numbers wh o may be 
affect ed by health and environmen tal policies su ch as 
a PVC phase out and for the much larger num bers 
who a re affected by busi ness-oriented “free trade” 
schemes, budget cu tbacks, man agement errors, 
marketing failures, a nd other ongoing sources of 
turmoil in the market economy. O ne interesting and 
ambitious poli cy option for displaced worke rs, the 
Just Transitio n blueprint developed by a co alition of 
labor and environmental leaders, sounds utopian in 
the US political co ntext, but is actu ally m ore modest 
than similar p rograms that exist in  Euro pe today.143

Steps Towa rd Alternatives 
 
 
Many steps have al ready been taken in the direction 
of reducing and ultimately eliminating the use of 
PVC. In this final sectio n we exam ine three areas 
where movem ent away  from PVC  can already be 
seen: public policy in itiatives in the US and  aroun d 
the world ; industry in itiativ es, in cluding those by 
auto companies and other leading manufact urers; and 
a small sa mpling of t he numerous “ green building” 
initiativ es in the US. In  the first two areas, we rely 
heavi ly on an extensive review published by 
Gree npeace. 
 
Policy In itiatives to Pha se out PVC 144 
 
Here we provide a brief overview of forward-looking 
policies, i nitiatives, and  strateg ies that have been 
adopted b y commu nities, g overnments, and 
professional organizations concerned about the heal th 
and environm ental haza rds associated with PVC 
production, use, an d disposal . These e fforts include 
laws, policy state ments, strateg ic plans, and o ther 
government initiativ es.  
 
US State  and Municip al Policies 
 
A num ber of  municipal governments in the US ha ve 
adopted po licies on  PVC products. For example, 
Rahway, New Jersey, prohibi ts the use of PVC or 
polystyren e in retail foo d estab lishments, requ iring  
the use of degradable packaging. Lak e in the Hills, an  
Illinois town, has banned the use of PVC pipes in 
construction, due to a variet y of practical and sa fety-
related conce rns, including worker exposure to glues 
and solvents du ring installatio n. In Califo rnia, th e 
city of Oakl and and Marin County have passed 
resolutions encouraging the use of PVC-free 
materials and t he use of PVC alternatives i n health 
care in stitutions, wit h a long-term goal of phasing out 
PVC  products from health care entirely. Glen C ove, 
New  York, has banned PVC  use in eating utensils or 
food containers in all city fo od retailers. 
 
A number of states and  municipalities h ave adopted 
policies on dioxin emissions, som e of whi ch include 
specific references t o PVC. San Fra ncisco, Oakla nd, 
and Berkeley, California ha ve adopte d resol utions to 
eliminate dioxi n, including PVC use redu ction as part 
of a broade r strategy. The Rhode Island Depa rtment 
of Environmental Managem ent has adopted a 
regulation to reduce PVC m aterials in  the waste 
stream by 50 percent by 2003. New Hampshire has adopted a policy to  cut dioxin emissions; the policy 
speci fically discusses use, disposal, and labeling of 
PVC . Boston has rece ntly adopted a dioxin reduction 
purchasing resolution that could lead to a reduction in 
use of PVC products. 
 
Canada 
 
Canada  has banned PVC  in food packaging and has 
initiated  a pub lic awaren ess ca mpaign to urge parents 
not to purchase su ch toys fo r small ch ildren. British  
Columbia has made a co mmitment to the long-term  
goal of encouraging hospitals to replace PVC with 
safer m aterials.  The Toronto city gove rnment places 
restrictions on the disposal of PVC  products.  
 
US Heal th Care Organiz ations 
 
A number of US h ealth care in stitutions and 
professional societies of health care providers have 
adopted reso lutions encouraging the elim ination of 
PVC  and other products that are important 
contributors to dioxin form ation. T he American 
Public Health A ssociatio n (APHA ) has adopted  
resol utions to phase out  dioxin contributors in 
medical waste, including  PVC products. The Chicago 
Medical Societ y, the Califor nia Medical As sociation, 
and the Mi nnesota Medical Association ha ve adopte d 
resolutions to in vestigate PVC altern atives as a 
means t o reduce dioxin emissions  from medical  
waste. The American Nurses ’ Ass ociation and the 
American Medical Wom en’s Association recommend 
the reduction of dioxin emissions  from medical  
waste. Th e member hospitals of the Main e Ho spital 
Associatio n have all co mmitted to con tinuou sly 
reducing the use and disposal of PVC  plastic, 
prioritizin g disposable health  care an d office produ cts 
as a fi rst step. 
 
The a nnual CleanMed conference brings together 
researc hers, product vendors, heal th care pu rchaser s, 
and others to exchange information on safer health 
care technologies and t o promote the development of 
healthy m arkets in t hese products.145 
 
 
Euro pe 
 
Sweden was the first country to propose general 
restrictio ns on the use o f PVC  in 1995; restrictio ns 
have been enforced sin ce 1999, and  the countr y is 
work ing toward  discontinuing all PVC uses. 
 

The Economics of Phasing Out PVC  
 41
Denm ark c reated a policy in 1996 urging the 
phaseout of PVC use af ter the f ailure of a 19 91 
voluntary PVC recycling program . One l ocal 
community in Denm ark has restricted the sale of 
PVC an d latex  toys and  has commi tted to the 
reduction of PVC use in hospitals and other 
institutions. Denmark’s Gren aa Hospital h as been a 
world lead er in th e elim ination of PVC , having 
started a progra m to re place PVC with sa fer 
alternatives as  early as 1988. Germ any has banne d 
the disposal of PVC in land fills as of 2005, is 
minimizin g the incineration of PVC, and is 
encouragi ng the phase out of PVC products t hat 
cannot easily be recycled. Since 1986 at leas t 274 
communities i n Germ any have enacted rest rictio ns 
against PVC . The government of the Netherlands has 
created a  policy that re quire s the use o f altern ative 
products for those that have no feasi ble recy cling or  
reuse  system .  
 
Spain’s government creat ed a goal  in 1995 of 
reducing PVC packaging by 20 percent by 2000. A 
number of cities in  Spain have developed rest rictio ns 
on the use of particular PVC products. In addition, 62 
cities in  Spain have sign ed on to a “PVC  free” 
agenda, which declares t hat they will p hase out all 
PVC  food packaging and discontinue use  of PVC  
construction materials in government and 
governmentally funded buildings. In Austria, a 
number of regional governments have initiated  
policies th at restrict th e use of PVC. Th e capital o f 
Luxembourg recom mends t hat no new PVC  piping 
shall be put in the sewag e syste ms. In Norway, th e 
capital city, Oslo , decided in 1991 to ph ase out use of 
PVC in all public b uildings. A number of local 
governments in the United Kingdom have  adopted 
policies to avoid use of PVC windows, and the 
community of Newh aven has adopted a policy to  
become entirely PVC free, unless PVC altern atives 
cannot be procured at a reasonable c ost. The Czech 
Republic has adopted po licies to  ban the use of PVC  
food packaging after 2008.  
 
In add ition to the policies developed by countries and  
municipalities,  public tran sportatio n and utility 
syste ms in m any countries require the  use of P VC-
free m aterials. Public s ubway and rail systems in 
Austria, Germ any, Sp ain, and  the UK all prohibit the 
use of PVC ca bles. T he German railways go one step 
further and avoid  the use of any PV C materials. 
Additionally, water, sewer, an d gas companies in  the 
UK are also not using PVC  pipes in new or 
replacem ent projects . 
 
A number of regulatory initiativ es have focused  on 
PVC to ys, due to the threat of harm to children  if they suc k or chew on soft  plastic to ys. Certain  PVC 
toys and other PVC  products for small children have 
been ba nned in the E uropean Union as a  whole since  
1999. Bans on the use o f PVC for soft toys hav e been 
adopted in  many European countries, as well as in  
other countries in cluding Argen tina, Mex ico, th e 
Philippines, Tunisia, and the Fiji Islands.  
 
Asia /Pacific 
 
Japan passe d a law requiring manufact urers to 
recycle all pac kaging material by 2000 in order to 
reduce di oxin emissions; in response, many 
manufact urers have  switched to non-PVC packagi ng. 
Japan has also  adopted a policy th at limits th e use of 
PVC  sheathing in cables used in all governmental 
and public buildings. An ordinance  was also 
amended  to restrict the use of PVC  containing toxic 
additives in cooking utensils and baby toys. Many 
cities in Japan have  adopted, although not necessarily 
implemented, bans either on all PVC  products or on 
particular PVC products. Singapore has legislated 
that PVC  coate d cables are hazardous waste and 
therefore b ans their import under the Basel 
Convention on H azardous Waste.  
 
 
Industry Initiatives 146 
 
Reco gnizing  the h ealth  and environmental reason s to 
reduce PVC use, and  the feasi bility o f alternativ es, 
many industries—including some very  big ones—
have  begun to shift away from PVC . 
 
Automo biles. A num ber of  car manufact urers have  
made strong commitments to reducing the use of 
PVC  in their products, often citing environmental, 
health, a nd engineering reasons. E uropean 
manufact urers have  taken many steps in this 
direction. For example, Peu geot in France is reducing 
PVC use in the interior an d exterio r of its cars as a 
way to prevent recyclin g problems. A number of 
Germ an car m anufacturers  have sharply re duced 
PVC  use. Daimler-Benz st opped using PVC in 
underbody coating and in the interior of all cars as of 
1995 and planned to ultimately phase ou t all PVC 
use. Opel, the European  subsidiary of General 
Motors, and Mercedes  Benz also do not use PVC  in 
car interiors. BMW has a dopted material 
specifications t hat express a  prefe rence for 
dashboard, trim, and wi re coating m aterials other 
than PVC , and offers PVC-free dashboards.  
 
Japanese ca r manufacturers have al so taken concrete 
steps towa rd reducing PVC use. For exam ple,

Daih atsu Motor Company has estab lished a PVC 
reduction policy, reducing PVC use i n instrument 
panel  padding, roof linings, side m oldings, side 
window linings, th e soun dproofing component of 
dashboards , and door trim . The com pany is 
investigating  ways to  redu ce PVC use furth er in side 
windows, roof fabric, floor undercoating , and wire 
harness co ating . Hino  Motors is con sidering  PVC 
altern atives in truck and bus interiors, ex teriors, and 
wiring system s. Honda  made a commitm ent to 
replacing  PVC  interiors b y 2003. Mitsub ishi is 
work ing to substitu te PVC in instrument panels and  
door trim  surfaces and  already is u sing altern atives 
for roof linings and sheet materials. Ni ssan began 
using altern atives to PVC in cables in 199 7 and is 
using PVC altern atives fo r instrument panels, doo r 
trim, and  side guard moldings and harnesses. Suzuki 
Motor Corporatio ns is increasin g its use of substitutes 
for PVC, and Toyota has developed PVC alternatives 
for car interi ors and bumpers. 
 
In the US, the  world’s largest  auto m anufact urers 
have  also com mitted to reducing PVC  use. Gene ral 
Motors elimin ated PVC fro m its interiors in 19 99. 
The 2000 Pontiac Bo nneville u sed a PVC -free 
material for t he full instr ument pa nel for the first tim e 
in North  America. Ford  has set th e targ et of 
eliminating the use of PVC by the model year 2006 
for all of its plants worldwid e and  is instructing its 
suppliers  to design ve hicles using m ore recy cled 
conte nt and plastics that are ea sy to recycle. A 
number of  US auto suppliers have  begun their own 
initiativ es to remove PVC and h ave started  by 
removing it from interior panels, instrument panel s, 
integrating  skin, sub strate, rei nforcing beams, and 
batteries. 
 
Food Packag ing and Water Bo ttles.  The use of  PVC  
in food packaging has been the source of 
considerable conce rn in Europe. PVC  food packa ging 
is no longer used in Austria, due to measure s taken 
by Austrian superm arket  chains in the early 1990s. 
Carlsb erg Italia, th e Italian  unit of th e Dan ish beer 
company, has discontinued its use of PVC caps. A 
number of water bottling companies in  Europ e have 
also stopp ed usin g PVC  in their bo ttles, in cluding 
Nestlé brand s, Spa, and  Evian. In  Spain, thirty-six  
water bo ttling companies including Dano ne and 
Perrier are phasing out PVC. 
 
In Brazil, th e agricultural food manufacturer Carg ill 
no longer uses PVC b ottles for its Liza soybean oil 
brand. In Japan, Nihon Suisan Kaisha has c onverted 
to PVC-free packag ing for its sausages, and  Kagome 
Company has converted to PVC-free packaging for 
all household products.  In the US, Federated Group, Borden Crem ora Non-
Dairy Cream ers, a nd Eagle Family Foods  have 
conve rted to PVC-free packaging for thei r creamers; 
Dean Fo ods is replacing  its m ilk containers with 
PVC-free p ackag ing; Veg iWash  has elim inated the 
use of PVC in its fruit and vegetable wash  bottles; 
and Plan ters has eliminated its u se of PVC bottles fo r 
pean ut oil.  
 
Hospital Initiatives. Gren aa Central hospital in 
Denm ark has p hased out 95 percent  of its PVC use. 
The Glanzi ng pediatric clinic  in the  Wilhelminen 
Hospital in Vienna becam e the first Neonata l unit in 
the world t o announce in 2003  that it will cease to use 
PVC  products for invasive us es, although some 
products for non-invasi ve uses  do not yet have a PVC 
altern ative.147 Glanzin g has als o introduced PVC-free  
products in construction, as well as for overshoes, 
gloves, bed mattresses, a nd aprons.  
 
In the US, Un iversal Health  Serv ices, the third largest 
hospital managem ent com pany, and Tenet Healthcare 
Corporation , the second  largest for-p rofit h ealth care 
company, are  actively looking to replace PVC 
medical supplies. Four medical supply purchasing 
organizations—Broadlane, Consorta Inc, Prem ier Inc, 
and Novation—have al l committed to reducing the 
procurem ent of PVC  products and have urged their 
members to  do the sam e.148 
 
The s hift to PVC-free  medical care products  is 
facilitated  by new techno logical d evelopments. Fo r 
exam ple, the Japane se company Terumo has begun 
manufact uring PVC -free dialyzing fluid bags  made 
from polypropylen e and  has developed a new  
polypropylene material for c ontinuous ambulatory 
periton eal d ialysis; McGr aw Inc supplies PVC-free 
IV bags in the US; and Saint-Gobain Performance 
Plastics h as recen tly developed an altern ative to  PVC 
for medical tubing.149 
 
Shoes. Nike began to phase out PVC in its pr oducts 
in 2001, and currently  advertises seve ral PVC-free  
footwear models. Nike’s website showcases  several  
PVC -free shoe brands, which are labeled with Nike’s 
new environmentally sound logo.150 Other 
manufact urers, including Adidas, Asics, and Pum a, 
are also in t he process  of phasing out PVC i n 
shoes.151  
 
Electronics. Sony states in  its 2003 Corporate Social 
Respo nsibility Repo rt that t he com pany is working t o 
reduce PVC in all its p roducts by the end  of 2005.152 
Sony now  has PVC-free headphone cords, speaker 
boxes, and disk drives on the market.153 Recently, 
Sony release d two products in the T okyo m arket that

replace PVC with the corn-based polym er polylactic 
acid (PLA): a DVD player  and AIBO, a robo tic 
pet.154 Toshiba is currently workin g to phase out the 
use of halogenated com pounds, including PVC, from 
its circu it boards.155 
 
Furniture. The Swed ish furn iture retailer IKEA, 
well-kno wn acro ss Eu rope and  the Un ited States, 
started phasing out PVC use in September o f 1992. 
To date IKEA has elim inated PVC from all fu rniture, 
and plans to phase ou t PVC in its la mp wiring by 
2006.156  
 
Retailing. Marks and Spencer, one of the larg est 
retailers in  Great Britain , pledged in 2001 to phase 
out the use of PVC in its prod ucts, fo cusing in itially 
on food packaging.157  
 
Innovative Construction Projects 
 
There  has been an e xplosi on of intere st in 
environmentally sound construction in the US in  
recent yea rs. A wealth of inform ation on gre en 
building initiativ es, including many case studies o f 
individual building projects, is avai lable through the  
US Green  Buildings Council. Initiativ es sh owcased  
by the council address a range of environmental and 
health c oncerns, incl uding energy e fficiency , 
environmentally sound management of wast es, and 
creatin g buildings with good indoor air qu ality. 158  
 
The Health y Building Netwo rk (HB N) prov ides a 
clearinghouse  of inform ation and contacts on PVC-
free and other envi ronmentally preferable building 
practices. HBN has als o collected case st udies of 
building initiativ es that have used safe co nstruction 
materials, including a num ber of heal th care 
institutions that have undertak en green  building 
projects. T o cite just one example, Beth Isra el 
Medical Cen ter in New York City co mpleted  a set of 
interior renovations i n 2000. Among other steps to 
ensure environmental safe ty an d pro tect in door air 
quality, Beth  Israel excluded PVC fro m its 
constru ction and furn iture specificatio ns.159  
 
In this section, we highlight just a few of the growing 
number of innovative construction projects in which 
special efforts have  been made to  choose materials 
that are sa fe for human health and the  environm ent, 
while keepi ng costs low. All of the e xamples 
discuss ed here have  reduced or eliminated the use  of 
PVC. 
 
GreenHOME , a volunteer group, partnered with the 
Wash ington, DC ch apter of Hab itat for Humanity to  design and build a low-income home that is ener gy 
efficien t and  built fro m materials th at are safe fo r 
human healt h and the e nvironment.160 The pur pose of 
the project  was to demonstrate that green building is 
not only an  option for luxury homes; it is equ ally 
possible for home builders on a budget. After 
exha ustive  research on m aterials, the group 
constructed a home whose to tal cost was $75,00 0.  
 
The GreenH OME house is no t 100 percent free of  
vinyl, but the use of vinyl was kept to a minimum. 
The wi ndows of the house are vinyl-clad wood and 
cost $264 each. The siding is Hardiplank (a fiber 
cement product), purchased at $0.55 per linear foot, 
for a total cost of $2,534. For flooring, the project 
used salva ged wood floors for livin g room areas a nd 
natural lin oleum for the kitchen . The total co st of 
flooring was $4,221. For roofing, the material of 
choice was  100 perce nt recycled alum inum  shingles, 
at a cost of $1,464.  
 
Another good model of gree n building on a budget is 
the Erie Ellingto n Homes project i n Dorc hester, 
Massachusetts.161 Developed by the Codman Square 
Neighborhood Development Corporation  with 
technical assist ance provide d by the Hickory 
Consortium (Bruce Ham pton, AIA, arc hitect), t his 
project in cludes fifty high-energy-efficiency housing 
units. The builders used fiber cement clapboards 
instead of vinyl and high-quality recycled content 
aluminum  clad wood windows  instead of vinyl clad 
windows.  
 
One goal of the project was t o provide sa fe homes for 
children and adults with asthma, by avoiding building 
materials th at are asso ciated  with air quality 
problems. Although not definitive, early results 
suggest t hat the project has had s ome success in t his 
regard; interviews wi th new residents have shown 
that sym ptoms were  noticeabl y reduce d in 8 out of 18 
asthm a suffe rers. 
 
To save money, the project used vinyl composite tile 
in some public areas, such as comm on halls and 
stairs; these were selected as a reas in which 
outgassi ng of phthalates wo uld be least likely to 
affect  occupants. For som e other areas  the project  
used alternative flooring products, including 
linoleum.  
 
Both the Erie Ellin gton project an d the Green HOME 
project used Hardiplank, a durable fiber cement 
siding product that requires very infrequent painting. 
The Gree nHOME project estimates th at the 
Hard iplank sidin g will req uire painting "every 15  to 
20 years, com pared to e very 5 to 10 years for wood

siding in the Washington, DC climate."162 Managers 
of both projects seem  to have been relativ ely satisfied  
with Hard iplank. The principal disadvantage of the 
material for t he GreenHOME  project, which relied 
largely on  volunteer lab or, is th at Hard iplank is 
somewhat more difficu lt for volunteers t o work with 
than vinyl. The proj ect repo rt notes that cu tting the 
planks c reated large am ounts of dust, so that 
volunteers had to wear filtratio n masks. Du st would 
have  been reduced i f the project had used special 
tools for cu tting the Hard iplank, but these tools were 
out of the price ran ge of the pro ject. In  addition, 
because it is more  dense than wood, the Hardiplank 
siding was m ore difficu lt to n ail into place than  wood  
siding would have been. The GreenH OME project 
report concludes that overall, "these pr oblems were 
minor a nd acce ptable."163 
 
The Sher aton Ritte nhouse S quare  Hotel in 
Philadelphia advertises itself as an “env ironmen tally 
smart hotel.”164 The hotel has wallpaper with a  water-
based finish instead of vi nyl wall coverings. 
Carp eting  in the ho tel do es not h ave a PVC base. Fo r 
flooring in non-carpeted areas , the hotel has  used 
natural lin oleum instead  of vinyl tile. Th e hotel 
plumbing includes no PVC pipe.  
 
Barry Dimson, co-own er of the ho tel, h as made the 
econom ic case for buildi ng environmentally sound 
hotels i n a series of a rticles. He a rgues t hat up-front 
costs for building an env ironmen tally so und ho tel, 
using safe building materials, are not sign ificantly 
differen t from the cost of building a "traditional" hotel, where air quality m ay be poor due to mold and 
off gassi ng from PVC  and other building materials. 
Dimson notes that an estim ated 20 percent of to tal 
project cost in the construction of a new hotel is land 
acquisition , and aroun d 55 percent is “t he 'hard ' cost 
of construction, with 'soft' costs suc h as carrying 
charges a nd design fees  com prising the remaining 25 
perce nt.” If half of the “hard cost” of construction is 
dedicated  to excav ation, found ations, and  
superstru cture, th en ju st half the constru ction cost is 
dedicated to “the building's 'skin,' mechani cal 
equipment, [and ] building materials.” Th is 27 .5 
perce nt is the portion t hat is affected by green 
buildi ng consi derations. T hus, argues Dimson, “e ven 
if [green building materials ] cost 10 percent more up 
front, 10 percent of 27.5 perc ent represents a 
premium of [just] 2 .75 percent o ver the total cost.”165  
 
Green  building was prioritized  in con struction of a 
new bu ilding for Adat Shalom, a sy nagogue in  
Bethesda,  Maryland.166 Among other choices, the 
comm unity chose t o use c ork instead of vinyl 
flooring wherever possible. Si nce finishi ng 
constru ction of the new bu ilding, members of Ad at 
Shalom have  been working with others to spread 
knowledge of best pract ices for green bu ildings in 
religious communities. Th e “Building in Go od Faith ” 
initiativ e, lau nched by filmmak er Jud ith Helfand and 
religious lead ers, ask s faith-based  institutions to  
reduce t heir purchasi ng and use of toxic building 
materials, part icularly those made from PVC.167

Conclusion 
 
 
PVC  has become universal, used in every area of 
modern life. It is said  to be cheap , con venient, safe, 
and m aintenance free . Our review of the  evidence 
finds that t he advantages of PVC are often 
overstated —it is a little ch eaper th an the altern atives 
in some areas, but no bargain at all in ot hers.  Our 
analysis offe rs four categories  of re sponses t o the 
econom ic argument for PVC:  
 
• It is not always  chea per on a  life-cycle c ost 
basis, a s in floori ng. 
• The altern atives will b ecome cheaper over 
time, due t o economies of sca le and  learning 
curve e ffects. 
• The use o f PVC products often poses heal th 
and safety hazards, as in m edical supplies. 
• The c osts of environmental protection and 
improvement are rou tinely overstated  in 
adva nce. 
 
In our look at s pecific m arkets, we  found t hat less 
toxic alternatives are successfully com peting with 
PVC  in many pipe applications, i n single-ply roofing, 
in flooring on a life-cycle cost basis, and in medical 
supplies due to growing  concerns abou t the health  
hazards of PVC. In si ding and windows, among t he 
fastest-growi ng vinyl markets of recent years, 
promising ne w alternatives have appea red.  
 The em ployment effects of a transition  to altern ative 
materials may be modest. PVC will b e replaced by 
other materials  that also requ ire labo r; workers will 
still b e needed to make the sub stitute produ cts. In  
some cases, the sam e factories and workers  may 
fabricate the same products from new m aterials. 
 
There are po licy in itiativ es at ev ery lev el, 
internation ally an d with in the US, callin g for 
reduction and restriction of PVC use. Major 
industries are beginning to sub stitute less tox ic 
materials fo r PVC throug hout their product lines. Th e 
rapidly growing “green building” movem ent has  
created numerous success ful exam ples of t he use  of 
safer altern atives m aterials ; the few ex amples 
descri bed here are only a sam ple of the encouraging  
diversity of approaches em erging in the construction 
industry tod ay.  
 
Our revi ew of PVC  uses and alternatives makes it 
clear that a PVC phaseout is a chieva ble and 
affordable. The altern atives are in creasing ly well 
known and well devel oped, and in many cases are 
alread y cost-com petitive with  PVC. It is realistic and 
practical to  build health an d environmental 
considerations  into m aterials choice for m unicipal 
infrastru cture, co mmercial and resid ential building, 
medical supplies, and consumer products. The cost  
impacts o f substitu tion will be m odest, and  will g row 
smaller o ver time.

25 Brian  W. Arthu r, an economist at th e San ta Fe In stitute, has arg ued that man y of so ciety's im portant economic an d

history may be abl e to solidify that lead by gaining market share and lowering prices, “locking out” other 
technologies that may be equa lly or m ore effi cient if a dopted on a large sc ale. The  Windows  operating syste m, the 
standa rd videocasset te format, the dominant nucl ear reactor design, and the gas oline-powered automobile engine, 
for ex ample, all started  with only sm all lead s over equ ally (o r more) attractiv e rival tech nologies; all h ave co me to 
be “l ocked in” and dominate their markets through the path-dependent process that Arthur descri bes. See Brian W.

132 The total em ployment in NAICS ind ustry 326 1, “p lastics pro duct manufacturing,” was 826 ,615.  Of these

136 It seem s likely that the employment data in Table 17 err more often in the direction of including too many 
workers, such as those who make ot her products at the same plants. The one obvious case of incompleteness i n the 
other direction, underestimating  employment, seem s smaller by com parison. If too many workers are c ounted in 
Table 17, then the true average productivity—pounds of PVC per worker—is higher than our estimated 2.82 million 
pounds per worker, and the number of workers neede d to produce the entire industry output is lower t han 5,600.  
Further support for th e guess that the industry h as higher pro ductivity, an d hence lower total e mployment, than our 
estimates can  be fo und in Envir onment Can ada’s stud y of chlorine-related  industries in Canada in 1993. That stud y 
descri bes three PVC resin plants, with a n average  capacity of 3.14  million pounds per wor ker. If there have been 
adva nces in productivity since 1993, the capacity per worker should now be even higher. See E nvironment Canada, 
“A Tec hnical and Socio-Econom ic Compariso n of Options to Produ cts Deriv ed from the Chlor-Alk ali In dustry” 
(1997), Chapter 9. 
137 The 200  workers were also  produ cing a larger quantity o f EDC, a VCM precursor; so me of th e EDC  was 
exported, and some was use d to produce  VCM. Thus the workers’ act ual productivity was higher (and estimated US 
labor requ iremen ts per million pounds of VCM sh ould be lower) t han th e numbers presen ted in the tex t.
