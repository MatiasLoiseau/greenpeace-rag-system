State of the Oceans

The crisis in our oceans continues
unabated. In spite of overwhelming
evidence and strong warnings from
the most respected members of the
scientific community, we continue to
plunder our seas with impunity.

Seafood merchants persist in focusing on large,
predatory fish, such as cod, sharks, and tuna,
while globally, populations of these ecologically
important fish have dropped by 90 percent.
Bycatch remains a scandalous problem: each
day, an enormous portion of the world’s total
seafood catch is tossed over the sides of fishing
boats due to inefficient, indiscriminate fishing
methods. The worst of the worst, bottom trawl-
ing, is responsible for 80 percent of all bycatch
incurred globally.

Thankfully, we are beginning to see a change
in this troubling trend. Little by little, the United
States retail sector is waking up to the reality of
the situation. Certain seafood markets are start-
ing to make positive choices about how seafood
should be caught, sold, and labeled. There is still
a tremendous amount of progress to be made,
however, and we cannot stop now.

As the Carting Away the Oceans project moves
forward, a schism is emerging among the
largest US seafood retailers. It is becoming
clear that certain markets—such as Wegmans,
Target, and Whole Foods—are deeply invested
in making better decisions and providing safer,
more sustainable seafood options for their
customers. At the same time, an opposite,
dismal truth has become impossible to ignore:
there are many seafood retailers that have yet to
take any responsibility for the seafood they sell,
or for the damage they are doing to our oceans.

Over the past seven months, Greenpeace has
engaged in a direct campaign to expose the
practices of one of the worst historical perform-
ers in Carting Away the Oceans rankings: Trader
Joe’s. In August 2009, the company’s lack of a
sustainable seafood policy, misleading labeling
practices, and unsustainable inventory items
led Greenpeace to initiate a series of online and
on-the-ground actions addressing the company’s
unacceptable behavior. Now, eight months later,
we find ourselves victorious and cautiously opti-
mistic. Trader Joe’s has reformed to a significant
degree. The company is reportedly discussing a
partnership with a reputable third party to help
in making sustainable decisions. Trader Joe’s is
also crafting a public sustainable seafood policy
and redesigning its labeling, and it has already
discontinued several of its former red list items,
such as orange roughy and red snapper.

This incredible victory was the result of actions
taken by tens of thousands of people across the
country who demanded change. These activists
took up the call and confronted Trader Joe’s
directly through phone calls, letters, e-mails,
in-store demonstrations, and a number of
other creative tactics. Eventually, the company
responded to the pressure from its customer
base, and we were rewarded with a store that,
while still a long way from perfect, has made
tremendous strides toward a more responsible
seafood operation.

Consumers deserve to be able to purchase
seafood from retailers that care about the
condition of our oceans and that properly
steward our marine resources. The days of
selling fish with no regard for the environment are
over. Companies have two choices—they can
implement strong seafood policies and become
leaders, or they can ignore reality and continue
their unsustainable seafood practices until many
popular seafood items are no longer available.
And increasingly, if they choose the latter course,
they will reap the wrath of a consumer public that
has simply had enough.

The Role of
Supermarkets

Supermarkets are one of our strongest connec-
tions to the oceans. Our relationship with fish is
largely one of predator and prey, and for most
Americans, grocery stores are the preferred
hunting grounds. In the United States, consum-
ers buy about half of their seafood at the fish
counter, but conservation efforts in this arena
have a history of bypassing retail operations
and concentrating on the individual shopper.
Unfortunately, this method alone will not reduce
pressure on our fish stocks to acceptable
levels—rather, the supermarkets themselves
must begin to participate in the global ocean
conservation movement.

Retailers have a tremendous amount of power in
the seafood industry. Over the past three years,
we have seen several large chains begin to
engage in proactive, thoughtful actions: discon-
tinuing objectionable projects, participating in
sector-wide conservation initiatives, and creating
sustainable seafood policies that will enable
stores to continue to sell seafood in an ethical
and responsible manner far into the future.

Other retailers, however, have yet to get on
board. These industry laggards continue to
ignore the writing on the wall and refuse to
reform their behavior, electing instead to sling
unsustainable species without compunction.
These kinds of irresponsible actions bespeak
a general disregard for our planet, our shared
resources, and our future. Companies that act
this way do not merit our patronage.

Greenpeace calls upon all seafood retailers to
enact strong, effective, sustainable seafood
policies that will reduce pressure on flagging
fish stocks and help heal our ailing oceans.
Intolerably destructive practices, such as bottom
trawling and other high-bycatch fishing methods,
must be called out by name as unacceptable
within these policies, which need to set guide-
lines that preclude purchasing fish from unsus-
tainable operations. These policies must also
include protocols that increase overall transpar-
ency within the chain of custody, both to reduce

patronization of pirate fishing and to provide
more information to the customer at point-of-
purchase. Retailers must also begin
to participate more actively in the
political process; they must use their
massive buying power to leverage
positive change in our oceans and to
support governmental initiatives that
will create marine protected areas
(MPAs) and other measures integral
to a sensible, ecosystem-based
fisheries management approach.
Lastly, responsible retailers should
demonstrate their commitment to
this process by removing key red
list species from their inventories
immediately. If we are to save our
oceans from destruction by over-
exploitation, we cannot continue to
sell unsustainable species like shark,
orange roughy, and hoki. There is a
better way to sell seafood, and it is
time for progressive retailers to take
the reins and lead the industry away
from the environmentally negligent
practices that have literally brought
us to the brink of catastrophe.

Pushing the Envelope:
Target
Target has risen to the
top of the Carting Away
the Oceans rankings by
embracing challenges that
other retailers dismiss as
impractical or impossible.
The company’s recent
implementation of seafood
standards that preclude
the sale of any farmed
salmon whatsoever sent
shockwaves through the
aquaculture industry. Target
has vowed to continue
improving the sustainability
of its seafood operation; no
doubt there are even more
impressive feats yet to come
from this company.

How Far We’ve Come

Before 2008, little had been done in response to
the aggregate effects that the US seafood retail
industry was having on our oceans. Aside from
a few select companies, major seafood retailers
were concerned only with price and quality.
Environmental issues were not considered.

When Greenpeace first released Carting Away the Oceans in
2008, the seafood retail sector was in utter disarray. Not a single
market managed to attain a “Pass” in the first round of scoring—
even progressive retailers like Whole Foods, Ahold, and Target
were found severely wanting. Orange roughy and Chilean sea
bass commonly appeared in seafood cases across the country,
and the phrase “sustainable seafood policy” was dismissed by
merchandisers and executives alike as a pointless pipe dream.
The illusion that the oceans were impervious to change still
reigned supreme.

Over the next year, we began to see
movement. A few companies detached
themselves from the pack and began
to eke their way up the ranking list,
developing prototypical seafood
policies and dropping one or two
red list items. Customer awareness
grew as well, and across the country,
concerned shoppers began asking
questions about sustainable seafood.

In 2010, we find ourselves on the cusp of major change. A handful of visionary
companies have begun to use sustainability and environmental responsibility to
distinguish themselves from their competitors. Unsustainable species like orange
roughy and shark are disappearing from seafood sections at a steady clip. Over
half of the top twenty seafood retailers in the United States have crafted seafood
policies that have, to some degree, reigned in unsustainable sourcing practices.
Companies like Safeway and Whole Foods are joining forces with independent
third-party environmental groups like FishWise and the Monterey Bay Aquarium
in order to improve their operations and to better promote sustainable seafood to
their customers. And on the Carting Away the Oceans scorecard, while we still
await that first retailer to achieve the green “Good” sector of the rankings, half of
the companies analyzed in the report have now attained a “Pass.” These statistics
indicate incredible progress. Certainly there is still a great deal of work to be done,
but it’s important to recognize how far we have come. Truly, the seafood retail
sector is changing for the better—and not a moment too soon.

What Consumers Can Do

What Supermarkets Must Do

In a perfect world, those who take their paychecks from the oceans
would have the wisdom and foresight to steward it properly for the good
of all humanity. Unfortunately, we are trapped by an industry that has
run roughshod over the treasures of the deep for too long,
crushing them with trawl nets, slicing them to ribbons in purse
seines, and cutting their throats, thousands at a time, in the
name of short-sighted profit.

While some retailers have truly begun to step up and fight for
a better world, many still resist the obvious and continue to
plunder our oceans. Faced with this reality, it is up to consum-
ers to make our voices heard and to demand the change we
want to see in our oceans.

Four simple ways to heal the oceans at your grocery store:

1) Speak your mind. Tell your seafood merchant that
you’re concerned about overfishing, bycatch, and ineffectual
management. Demand to know the truth behind your seafood
options.

2) Know the facts. Familiarize yourself with the Greenpeace
red list items and other species of concern in your area.
Refuse to compromise.

A Policy for Change:
Whole Foods
Whole Foods has the most
thorough open-access
sustainable seafood policy
in the US seafood retail
market, bar none. Coupled
with the chain’s recent
decision to partner with
Seafood Watch and the Blue
Oceans Institute to increase
transparency at point-of-
purchase, Whole Foods
remains one of the most
progressive companies
within the Carting Away the
Oceans report.

3) Vote with your dollar. Reward seafood merchants that are taking
it upon themselves to make sustainable choices. When your local store
brings in a new, sustainable seafood product, give it a try, and let the
team behind the counter know you appreciate it.

4) Eat less fish. While this is a controversial suggestion, the fact is that
today’s demand for seafood far outstrips what can be delivered from
sustainable sources. While we work together to ensure that someday all
seafood will be sustainable, reducing seafood consumption now can help
lessen the pressure on our oceans.

page 8

Greenpeace April 2010

Retailers have the power to bring about enormous positive change in
our oceans. The buying power that these companies can leverage is
strong enough to rebuild depleted stocks, create protective measures
for vulnerable habitat areas, and promote smart, strong fishery
management across the globe.

In order to accomplish these goals, retailers must
address four specific tasks:

1) Create an effective, publicly available sustainable
seafood policy. Retailers that have sensible guidelines gov-
erning their seafood practices are better able to ensure that
they are not causing undue harm to the oceans through their
operations. Additionally, allowing the public access to these
policies increases overall transparency and creates a safe
space for consumers to purchase seafood with confidence.

2) Support initiatives and participate in partnerships
designed to promote positive change in the oceans. Retailers
can no longer afford to ignore the political process involved
in ocean conservation and fishery management. If we are
to safeguard our oceanic resources for future generations,
seafood merchants must begin to weigh in on the side of
conservation and responsible stewardship on a political level.

3) Increase overall transparency in labeling, signage,
and chain of custody. Sustainability is impossible to achieve
without establishing strong traceability mechanisms. This
traceability should be passed on to point-of-purchase,
allowing all seafood consumers to make educated choices
based on all available information. The usage of Latin names,
FAO catch areas, and other important data helps to dispel
the veils of misrepresentation and confusion surrounding the
conventional seafood industry.

Holding to Principles:
Wegmans
Wegmans continues to
dazzle all onlookers with its
willingness to take a strong
ethical stand in the political
arena. By championing the
Ross Sea, the world’s last
intact oceanic ecosystem,
Wegmans has drawn a
critical line in the sand. The
company refuses to sell
any seafood that is taken
from this imperiled area,
choosing instead to stand
for responsible sourcing and
environmental awareness.
The world needs more
companies willing to take
such stands.

4) Stop selling red list species. There are some fisheries that simply
should not be patronized at this time due to stock depletion, overfish-
ing, or irresponsible fishing methods. Similarly, there are certain
species of fish and shellfish that, based on their physiology and life
history, are unable to support significant fishing pressure. Responsible
merchants must discontinue the sale of these animals if we are to have
any chance of repairing the damage we have done to our oceans.

1. Target
Banners: SuperTarget

Background: By constantly innovating, Target has
built an enormously successful “big box” store concept
based on low prices and trendy products. Target’s
grocery division, SuperTarget, offers groceries, organic
products, and household goods under one roof. Su-
perTarget currently operates more than 218 grocery
locations in 22 states. Target is making significant
strides toward improving its seafood sustainability
as part of its overall mission to be a good corporate
steward of the environment.

Greenpeace Comments: Through visionary innovation
and a willingness to take on challenges other retailers
dismiss as insurmountable, Target has established
itself as the most sustainable major seafood retailer in
the United States. By way of example, recent improve-
ments to the store’s overarching sourcing policies have
resulted in the elimination of all farmed salmon from
all sections of Target’s stores, a task that many retail
representatives had claimed to be impossible, especially
given the price point at which Target operates.

Greenpeace applauds Target’s recent progress, but it
is worth noting that the company is still in the process
of developing a publicly available sustainable seafood
policy. Also, Target has yet to make a move in the politi-
cal realm, where its buying power could be extremely
helpful in promoting necessary conservation gains,
such as a strong network of marine reserves and tighter
controls on illegal fishing.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Target’s sustainable sea-
food policy is developing quickly and has already begun
to prove its strength. While the policy is not yet publicly
available (this is an area where Target could improve
substantially), the company has provided Greenpeace
with in-depth information regarding the policy’s status
and current applicability. Recent changes to the store’s
policy have resulted in the discontinuation of all farmed
salmon products due to concerns over environmental

page 12

degradation, and the company is already working toward
a sustainable method of sourcing and selling shrimp,
tuna, and other problematic products. In a press release
following the company’s elimination of farmed salmon, Greg
Duppler, Target’s senior vice president of merchandising,
announced that “Target strives to be a responsible steward
of the environment, while also providing our guests with the
highest-quality food choices.”

Historically, Target’s sustainable seafood policy has been ap-
plied most stringently to its own brands, Archer Farms and
Market Pantry, but the guidelines are now being used more
broadly. Target’s Food Safety & Quality Assurance team, as
well as third-party organizations, assess and monitor Target
seafood vendor programs. Target gives additional consider-
ation to vendors that demonstrate responsible harvest (wild
caught and farmed) and processing policies and practices,
as well as to certified products.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Target has improved
significantly in this area since the 2009 ranking, due pri-
marily to the chain’s increased level of attention to illegal
fishing, transparency in sourcing, and the environmental
issues associated with aquaculture. Target is a member
of the Food Marketing Institute’s Sustainability Task Force
and its subsidiary Seafood Working Group. In addition to
working with industry groups that represent producers,
processors, and conservation organizations, Target also
consults with seafood scientists on its seafood sustain-
ability and supports certification groups such as the
Marine Stewardship Council (MSC).

Labeling & Transparency: Target is actively incorporat-
ing seafood labeling and information dissemination
programs into its general efforts to promote sustainability.
Moreover, recent messaging efforts within the company

regarding the environmental issues associated with con-
ventional salmon farming have been broadcast widely
to its customer base and to the media and industry
at large. Product-specific sustainability information is
disseminated through circulars and seafood advertising
campaigns as well. While the items highlighted by
Target as sustainable options may not necessarily
reflect Greenpeace’s perspective, creating an avenue to
present this type of information at point-of-purchase is a
major step toward greater transparency.

Red List Seafood Sales: Since the 2009 update of
Carting Away the Oceans, Target has eliminated Atlantic
salmon. Target continues to sell eight of the twenty-two
red list species: Alaska pollock, Atlantic sea scallops,
Chilean sea bass, ocean quahog, South Atlantic alba-
core tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

2. Wegmans Food Markets
Banners: Wegmans

Background: Wegmans is a family-owned chain of
more than seventy supermarkets with outlets in New
York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland.
It is consistently ranked in Fortune Magazine as one of
the “100 Best Companies to Work For” and no longer
sells tobacco products.

Greenpeace Comments: Wegmans continues to run
at the head of the pack among the companies ranked
in the Carting Away the Oceans report. The chain sets
a strong standard for the industry, continuously striving
to improve its policy. Perhaps most impressive is the
company’s willingness to take progressive, ethical
stances on significant policy issues, such as their
recent announcement that they will not source any
seafood from the Ross Sea, a particularly threatened
part of our oceans that merits strong protection.

This is not to say that Wegmans’s operations do not
need improvement in several areas. Wegmans could
increase its score substantially by removing red list
items from its inventory—especially given the fact that
Wegmans’s own seafood sourcing policy dictates that
“when there is a sustainability concern with a particular
species, [Wegmans] works… to acquire seafood that
is caught responsibly and prevents the depletion of
natural resources. If we find that a better alternative is
not available, that item will be removed from our selec-
tion.” In spite of this clear directive, Wegmans continues
to sell items like skate, grouper, and monkfish, none of
which is available from sustainable sources.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Wegmans now has a
publicly available sustainable seafood sourcing policy
that incorporates guidelines for sourcing both wild-
caught and farmed products. Wild-caught items must
be captured according to local regulations and properly
reported and capture methods used must meet Weg-
mans standards. Stock strength, bycatch rates, and
social impacts are also taken into account.

Farmed products are sourced from suppliers that are
working to “minimize or eliminate the use of wild fish in
the feed, pesticides, and antibiotics.” Wegmans also
strives to avoid patronizing farms that cause undue
habitat alteration and/or land loss, are associated
with human rights abuses, or source broodstock from
red-grade fisheries.

Wegmans was the first US retailer to stand up in
support of the Ross Sea, the most pristine shallow sea
on the planet. By refusing to purchase any seafood
products sourced from that area, Wegmans has set
a strong precedent for other retailers that are moving
toward ethical seafood policies.

Wegmans actively seeks out products that have been
certified by bodies such as the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC) and works with outside conservation and
scientific groups to develop seafood sourcing standards.
Additionally, under Wegmans’s policy, products that are
not available from responsible sources will be removed
from the store’s selection. This directive has led Weg-
mans to eliminate several key red list seafood items from
its inventory. Unfortunately, over a dozen unsustainable
products can still be found in the Wegmans seafood
department.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Wegmans adheres
to Marine Stewardship Council guidelines for several
species, and Wegmans’s chain of custody is certified by
the MSC, a claim that very few US retailers can make.
Wegmans has worked closely with the Environmental
Defense Fund (EDF) and currently uses EDF guidelines
in some areas of its seafood purchasing, most notably
farmed shrimp (Wegmans purchases farmed Belizean
shrimp, which are raised without large amounts of fish
meal, contain no preservatives or tripolyphosphates,
and never receive antibiotics). Wegmans participates
in the Food Marketing Institute’s sustainability initiative
and supports the “Common Vision for Environmentally
Sustainable Seafood,” an initiative of the Conservation
Alliance for Seafood Solutions that aims to build an
active partnership between conservation organizations
and seafood retailers in support of achieving sustainable
fisheries. Wegmans has sent a letter to the State Depart-
ment voicing the company’s concern over IUU fisheries
and has previously participated in a partnership with the
EDF concerning the development of shrimp aquaculture
standards.

Labeling & Transparency: Wegmans is committed to
providing information about sustainable seafood to its
customers. The Wegmans sustainable seafood sourcing
policy is now available online and in print. Packaged
seafood that qualifies for sustainability statements is
discussed in the Wegmans Family Statement and, if
applicable, also carries the MSC logo. In Wegmans’s
seafood department, information about sustainable
seafood choices is available to customers, and Weg-
mans employees are trained to be knowledgeable about
seafood choices, labeling, and sustainability.

Red List Seafood Sales: If there is an area of its
seafood operation in which Wegmans needs to make
significant improvement, it is this: The company has
stalled out in curtailing the unsustainable products that it
offers, often times citing MSC certification as an excuse
to continue the sale of red list species. Similarly to last
year’s CATO update, Greenpeace surveys found that
Wegmans sells a dismal fifteen of the twenty-two red list
seafoods: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic halibut,
Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass,
grouper, ocean quahog, skates, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

3. Whole Foods Market
Banners: Harry’s Farmers Market, Whole Foods Market, Wild Oats

Whole Foods’s extensive policy seeks out MSC-
certified products, eliminates certain unsustainable
items from potential sale, and invites the cooperation of
independent scientific and environmental organizations.
Moreover, it requires fish farms to minimize the envi-
ronmental impacts of their operations, which includes
having protocols to prevent fish from escaping the
farms. Antibiotics, growth hormones, and poultry and
mammalian by-products may not be used in feed. Also
included are strong traceability measures that ensure
farmed seafood is tracked from farm to store.

Although we note that Whole Foods has incorporated
the use of certification bodies into its seafood sustain-
ability policy, Greenpeace does not endorse any seafood
certification program, including the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC).

Background: Whole Foods Market, a rapidly expanding
company with nearly 300 stores in the United States,
Canada, and United Kingdom, is the world’s largest pur-
veyor of natural and organic products. Whole Foods stays
on top of the growing consumer trend toward sustainable
living by constantly reviewing the health, nutritional, and
environmental impacts of the products it sells.

Greenpeace Comments: Whole Foods Market
continues to set a strong precedent for a progressive
US seafood retail sector. Until the 2009 update, Whole
Foods was the leader among those companies ranked
in Greenpeace’s Carting Away the Oceans report; the
chain dropped to third place last year. However, while
it remains in the same position in this update, it has
regained significant ground and now threatens to retake
the top spot in the very near future. This progress is
mainly due to the retailer’s strong dedication to building a
comprehensive sustainable seafood policy that includes
both farmed and wild products.

Unfortunately, Whole Foods continues to sell a tremen-
dous amount of red list seafood options. Whole Foods’s
resistance to shifting its inventory away from species
like Atlantic halibut, Chilean sea bass, and hoki is far
and away the most significant impediment to the chain
clinching the pole position.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Whole Foods recently
released a strong policy for wild-caught species that
compliments its aquaculture procurement policy (created
in 2008). While there is still room for improvement (it is
difficult to fully support a sustainable seafood policy that
still allows for the sale of hoki, grouper, and over a dozen
other objectionable species), Whole Foods’s policy is
indeed at the front of the pack in terms of its compre-
hensive and science-based nature. In developing and
implementing these standards, Whole Foods called upon
the expertise of scientists, environmentalists, and the
company’s suppliers. In addition, Whole Foods provides
suppliers with training on its standards.

page 16

Greenpeace April 2010

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Whole Foods
supports sustainable fishing practices by actively
partnering with suppliers, the MSC, and other groups to
encourage responsible practices. Whole Foods supports
the “Common Vision for Environmentally Sustainable
Seafood,” an initiative of the Conservation Alliance for
Seafood Solutions that aims to build an active partner-
ship between conservation organizations and seafood
retailers in support of achieving sustainable fisheries.

Labeling & Transparency: Whole Foods recently
introduced a pioneering labeling program in concert
with the Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) and the Blue
Oceans Institute (BOI). The program is designed to
increase available information at point-of-purchase
regarding the sustainability of various seafood options.
Whole Foods provides information to its customers on its
Web site and trains its seafood counter staff to answer
questions about seafood sourcing and catch methods.
The company’s Aquaculture Standards are available

online, setting a strong example in terms of transpar-
ency. Brochures on mercury in seafood are available to
consumers upon request. Whole Foods also educates
its customers about the environmental benefits of frozen
seafood, which can take the slow boat to market and
thus has a much smaller carbon footprint, as opposed
to fresh seafood, which requires immediate shipping.

Red List Seafood Sales: Whole Foods continues to lag
badly in this area. Partly by using MSC certification as
justification, the chain refuses to discontinue many key
red list items. Greenpeace surveys found that Whole
Foods still sells an inexcusable eighteen of the twenty-
two red list seafoods: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod,
Atlantic halibut, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallops,
bigeye tuna, Chilean sea bass, Greenland halibut,
grouper, hoki, monkfish, ocean quahog, red snapper,
redfish, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

4. Safeway
Banners: Carr’s, Dominick’s, Genuardi’s, Pavilions, Randall’s, Safeway, Tom Thumb, VONS

5. Ahold
Banners: Stop & Shop, Giant, Martin’s Food Market, Ukrop’s

Background: Safeway is among the largest grocery
chains in the United States and operates over 1700 su-
permarkets under eight banners, mostly in the Western
and Southwestern regions, but also in the mid-Atlantic
region and in Canada. Safeway offers a wide array of
grocery items, including store brand organic foods and
nontoxic household products.

Greenpeace Comments: Safeway has shown dramatic
improvement in all areas of their seafood operation since
the last iteration of Carting Away the Oceans in 2009.
Primarily through their development of a partnership
with FishWise, the massive retailer has considerably
increased its participation in key initiatives and signifi-
cantly fleshed out its burgeoning seafood policy.

In order to further increase the sustainability of its
seafood program, Safeway should focus its energy on
increasing transparency as it pertains to both chain of
custody and point-of-purchase.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Safeway’s seafood
policy is not yet publicly available, but information
given to Greenpeace by the retailer details the ongoing
development of an increasingly stringent set of sourcing
guidelines. At this time, Safeway’s policy requires that
its seafood suppliers verify the sources of their products
and disclose their sustainability policies as a condition
of doing business with Safeway. Additionally, under this
policy, Safeway has begun to eliminate seafood from
fisheries that target depleted populations or that cause
undue collateral damage to the surrounding environment
through irresponsible capture methods. The chain is
also insisting that its suppliers begin to demonstrate
improvements in aquaculture techniques for farmed
salmon and shrimp.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Safeway is making
substantial progress in this area. The retailer is begin-
ning to transform itself into a politically oriented force
that speaks out in support of progressive marine policy
in a variety of different arenas. Safeway supports the
ongoing MLPA process in California (creating protected
coastal marine areas), has promised to support protec-
tive measures for Gulf of Mexico bluefin tuna spawning
areas, and more.

Safeway recently codified a partnership with FishWise,
a nonprofit environmental organization dedicated to
achieving a greater level of sustainability and transpar-
ency within the seafood retail industry. Safeway is also
a member of the Food Marketing Institute’s Sustain-
ability Task Force, as well as its Sustainable Seafood
Working Group.

Labeling & Transparency: Safeway provides its
customers with information on mercury in seafood.
The company plans to make information regarding its
sustainable seafood policy available to the public at
some point, but this has not yet been accomplished.
Programs to distribute this information via the com-
pany’s Web site and in-store flyers and signage are
currently under development.

Red List Seafood Sales: Safeway strives to be an
industry leader in its approach to red list inventory.
Each Carting Away the Oceans update reveals new
work done by the retailer in this area. Most recently,
Safeway discontinued the sale of grouper and monk-
fish. Unfortunately, the chain seems loathe to give up
two particularly destructive seafood items—orange
roughy and Chilean sea bass.

Safeway currently sells eleven of the twenty-two red list
seafoods: Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass, ocean quahog,
orange roughy, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish,
tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Background: Ahold USA is the US subsidiary of
Netherlands-based grocery giant Royal Ahold. In the
United States, Ahold operates approximately 700
grocery stores in New England and along the East
Coast. Ahold is making significant strides toward
seafood sustainability.

Greenpeace Comments: Ahold continues to be a
leader in sustainable seafood within the US industry, but
the company has not made significant progress in either
policy development or initiative participation within the
last year. That being said, Ahold’s dedication is evident
in its recent improvements to overall transparency (the
company published its sustainable seafood policy)
and the comments it recently released regarding the
unsustainable nature of Chilean sea bass.

Ahold could improve its overall score by strengthening
its sourcing policy; backing policy initiatives, such
as proposed marine reserves; and removing red list
species, such as monkfish and Atlantic cod, from its
product list.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Ahold has a ten-point
sustainable seafood policy that covers both wild-caught
and farmed seafood. Its sustainability program, Choice
Catch, aims to reduce the negative impacts of commer-
cial fishing. Ahold makes purchasing decisions based
on the results of seafood sustainability audits conducted
with the help of the New England Aquarium. Issues
addressed in its sustainable seafood policy include
avoiding illegally caught seafood; considering social,
ecological, and economic impacts; and supporting
scientific research and stakeholder initiatives aimed at
improving seafood sustainability. Ahold gives preference
to farmed seafood suppliers that are taking steps to
reduce the environmental impacts of their operations
as well as reduce the use of wild-caught fish for feed,
antibiotics, and pesticides.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Ahold supports
the Common Vision for Environmentally Sustainable
Seafood, an initiative of the Conservation Alliance
for Seafood Solutions, which aims to build an active
partnership between conservation organizations and
seafood retailers in support of achieving sustainable
fisheries. Ahold also chairs the Food Marketing
Institute’s Sustainable Seafood Working Group and
is involved in numerous other seafood sustainability
initiatives and related projects.

Ahold utilizes several seafood certification systems,
including the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC),
GlobalGAP, and the Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA).
Although we note these practices, Greenpeace does
not endorse any seafood certification programs.

Labeling & Transparency: Ahold currently leads the
retail sector in overall transparency. Its recent decision
to make its seafood sourcing policy publicly available
has thrust the company into the top spot in this cat-
egory. Additionally, Ahold provides in-store information
to its seafood customers, although it does not provide
information on sustainable seafood or its Choice Catch
program on its retail banner Web sites (Giant.com,
Stop&Shop.com). Ahold is also beginning to generate
statements encouraging consumers to avoid unsustain-
able species.

Red List Seafood Sales: Ahold’s red list inventory
has not changed since last year. Greenpeace surveys
identified thirteen of the twenty-two red list seafood
items on sale at Ahold retail banners: Alaskan pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallops,
grouper, monkfish, ocean quahog, red snapper, redfish,
South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp,
and yellowfin tuna.

6. Harris Teeter
Banners: Harris Teeter

Background: Harris Teeter is an upscale supermarket
chain with over 160 stores within six southeastern US
states. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Ruddick Corporation, which is based in Charlotte,
North Carolina, and is Ruddick’s most successful and
profitable company. Harris Teeter is an expanding chain
that offers trendy store enhancements like chef-prepared
meals, sushi, and organic and natural products.

Greenpeace Comments: While Harris Teeter remains
a comparatively progressive retailer in terms of the US
seafood industry, the chain has made relatively little
progress over the past year. Harris Teeter’s stated goal is
“to offer top quality seafood while being cognizant of the
sustainability of supply, environmental impact on marine
life and other species as well as social and economic
impacts.” Unfortunately, this laudable goal is belied by
the company’s continual patronage of environmentally
damaging fisheries, such as Chilean sea bass and New
Zealand orange roughy.

Greenpeace encourages Harris Teeter to rejoin industry
leaders by strengthening its overall sustainable seafood
policy and removing key items from its inventory.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Harris Teeter has
sustainable seafood procurement guidelines that cover
both wild-caught and farmed seafood. The company’s
policy dictates that it a) source wild-caught species from
suppliers of fisheries with management systems that use
scientific data and b) seek out farmed seafood products
with minor environmental impacts, such as domestic
catfish, tilapia, and mussels.

Jennifer Thompson of Harris Teeter has informed
Greenpeace that “we only source wild seafood prod-
ucts from suppliers that demonstrate and adhere to all
international, domestic, and local laws and guidelines.”
Additionally, the company refuses to purchase any
trans-shipped product and requires providers of certain
farmed products to be ACC certified.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Harris Teeter is
unique insofar as it is the first US chain to explicitly
implement the Greenpeace Blacklist—the world’s most
comprehensive register of pirate fishing vessels—in
its sourcing guidelines; the company has stated that it
will not sell seafood that is traced back to any ship on
the Blacklist. Harris Teeter works directly with suppli-
ers who comply with sustainability initiatives. Harris
Teeter participates in the Food Marketing Institute’s
sustainability initiative and the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Tuna Standards
Steering Committee.

Labeling & Transparency: Harris Teeter’s sustainable
seafood standards are available on its Web site. Harris
Teeter carries several Marine Stewardship Council
(MSC)-certified seafoods, which carry the MSC logo,
as well as farmed seafoods certified by the Aquaculture
Certification Council (ACC) and other third parties.
Harris Teeter also provides information on mercury in
seafood. To promote sustainable choices, Harris Teeter
provides extensive training for seafood managers, but
the company does not make the information readily
available at point-of-purchase.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
that Harris Teeter continues to sell twelve of the
twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic
cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea
bass, grouper, ocean quahog, orange roughy, South
Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp, and
yellowfin tuna.

7. The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A&P)
Banners: A&P, A&P Super Foodmart, Food Basics, The Food Emporium, Pathmark,
Super Fresh, Waldbaums

Background: The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company
(A&P) is rebuilding and working to distinguish itself as a
small neighborhood grocer with high-quality foods. A&P
operates more than 450 stores under 6 subsidiaries,
mostly in the New England region. A&P is owned by
the Tengelmann Group, a German company that is a
majority stockholder and is active in the management
of both US and European subsidiaries.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: A&P has leveraged
its buying power to move its suppliers toward a more
sustainable sourcing system. Moreover, on a political
level, the company is actively supporting measures
designed to enforce bycatch caps and to restrict the
use of destructive fishing gear. A&P is a member of the
Food Marketing Institute’s Sustainability Task Force, as
well as its Sustainable Seafood Working Group.

Greenpeace Comments: A&P has reengaged in its
development of a sustainable seafood operation, and
it has done so with a vengeance. The company has
demonstrated marked improvements in all categories,
especially initiative participation and overall inventory.
In fact, A&P’s score in this iteration of Carting Away the
Oceans is a full 3.2 points higher than the company’s
score for the previous year—the largest jump by any
company in this year’s report.

Greenpeace expects A&P’s score to continue to climb
as the company develops a sustainable seafood policy,
increases the transparency of its chain of custody, and
explores new ways to support policy initiatives towards
ocean conservation.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: This is an area in which
A&P could improve substantially. A&P does not yet have
a sustainable seafood policy, but it is in the process of
developing one. Based on the current inventory of the
retailer, Greenpeace expects the policy will be quite
strong when it comes into effect.

Labeling & Transparency: A&P has begun disseminat-
ing information to its customers via in-store signage,
flyers, and its Web site. Unfortunately, the company
does not yet sufficiently label seafood products so that
consumers can avoid purchasing destructively fished
species.

Red List Seafood Sales: A&P has made tremendous
progress in this area. Since last year, the company has
discontinued numerous red list seafood items, including
Chilean sea bass, Greenland halibut, Atlantic cod, red
snapper, and redfish. Currently, A&P sells ten of the
twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaska pollock, Atlantic
salmon, Atlantic sea scallops, grouper, monkfish,
ocean quahog, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish,
tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

8. Delhaize
Banners: Bloom, Bottom Dollar, Food Lion, Hannaford Bros., Harveys, Kash n’Karry, Sweetbay

9. Wal-Mart
Banners: Wal-Mart, Sam’s Club

Background: Delhaize America is owned by the
Belgian food retailer Delhaize Group, which has many
subsidiaries, including major supermarket chains that
operate over 1500 grocery stores in sixteen US states.
The company is making the most of the US market
trends toward organic and natural foods, especially in
its Sweetbay stores that focus on healthful living and
nutrition.

Greenpeace Comments: Delhaize has made tremen-
dous progress since 2009, mainly due to its recently
established seafood sourcing policy. Other efforts
toward supporting fishery management initiatives and
increasing transparency within the chain of custody have
also helped to buoy Delhaize within the Carting Away
the Oceans rankings.

That being said, the retailer lags far behind many other
progressive chains in its overall inventory. It is unaccept-
able that a chain moving such a tremendous volume
of seafood continues to sell inexcusable species like
Atlantic halibut, orange roughy, and sharks.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Delhaize has recently
developed a sustainable seafood policy. While it lacks
specifics and still very much a work in progress, it does
cover all of the seafoods sold by the chain (excepting pet
foods, which may be incorporated at a later date.) The
company’s policy currently states that it will “sell only
seafood from fisheries that are managed by competent
authorities and have a management plan in place that
incorporates a science-based approach to ensure
sustainability.” Additionally, the retailer has pledged that
all of its farmed products will be sourced from ACC-
certified suppliers by March 2011.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Delhaize has begun
to pressure its suppliers to fall in line with the company’s
evolving sustainable seafood policy, thus serving as a
much needed lever for change within the industry as
a whole. The company has also become more vigilant
in regard to IUU fishing and areas of the aquaculture
industry that are in need of improvement.

Hannaford Bros. is a member of the Food Marketing
Institute’s Sustainability Task Force and its Sustainable
Seafood Working Group.

According to Michael Norton, a spokesperson for the
retail banner Hannaford Bros., Hannaford is serving as
pilot site for a Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI)
initiative “that will strengthen the economic and ecologi-
cal sustainability of New England’s fisheries.” Mr. Norton
added that Hannaford will work with GMRI to develop
seafood standards, promote local and sustainable
seafoods, and track consumer responses. However,
none of these initiatives are being applied under any
other Delhaize banners.

Labeling & Transparency: While Delhaize has signifi-
cantly increased the transparency of its seafood chain of
custody, none of the retailer’s banners sufficiently labels
seafood products. Thus, Delhaize’s consumers are often
unable to avoid purchasing destructively fished species.

Red List Seafood Sales: This is far and away Delhaize’s
weakest area. The chain must direct its attention to
eliminating key red list species if it hopes to progress
toward a truly sustainable seafood operation. Recent
Greenpeace audits have revealed that the chain currently
sells an atrocious seventeen of the twenty-two red list
products: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic halibut,
Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass,
grouper, monkfish, ocean quahog, orange roughy, red
snapper, redfish, sharks, South Atlantic albacore tuna,
swordfish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Background: Wal-Mart is the world’s largest retailer.
It operates more than 7400 retail outlets in the United
States and in over a dozen other countries. In addition
to selling grocery items, Wal-Mart sells clothing,
electronics, toys, household merchandise, and other
goods. The company espouses three main goals: to
utilize 100 percent renewable energy, to create zero
waste, and to sell products that sustain our natural
resources. Unfortunately, in the case of seafood, it
seems that this work has largely stalled out.

Greenpeace Comments: According to the informa-
tion Wal-Mart recently presented to Greenpeace, the
chain has made no progress since 2009 in any of
the areas measured by the Carting Away the Oceans
report. This is a particularly worrying development due
to the retailer’s immense size and its tremendous draw
on the world’s fishery and aquaculture resources.

Wal-Mart’s stagnancy in the face of other retailers’
progressive activities is the primary cause for its fall
from #7 in the 2009 Carting Away the Oceans report
to its current ranking, #9.

Wal-Mart’s creation of a comprehensive sustainable
seafood policy was a positive step, but its reliance on
certification systems that certify species like Chilean
sea bass and hoki is problematic. Wal-Mart could
significantly improve its overall score by discontinuing
these species, regardless of certification.

Greenpeace strongly urges Wal-Mart to reengage and
develop stronger policy measures, as well as to play a
leading role in progressive conservation initiatives.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Wal-Mart’s sustainable
seafood policy, developed in 2009, covers both wild-
caught and farmed seafood. The company uses the
Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification system
as an indicator for sustainability of wild-caught species.

Wal-Mart uses standards developed by the Global
Aquaculture Alliance (GAA) and the Aquaculture Certifi-
cation Council (ACC) as a sustainability indicator for
farmed products. According to communications from

the company, “Wal-Mart will work with Global Aqua-
culture Alliance (GAA) and Aquaculture Certification
Council, Inc. (ACC) to certify that all foreign shrimp
suppliers adhere to Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP)
standards in the U.S. by 2011. One hundred percent
of the farmed shrimp products we purchase meets
factory processing criteria established by the ACC,
and we are in the process of having, catfish, tilapia
and salmon farms become ACC-certified as well.”

Today, similarly to the findings of the 2009 Carting
Away the Oceans survey, over half of the seafood
sold by Wal-Mart continues to be offered regardless
of the aforementioned policies.

Sustainability Initiatives: Wal-Mart partners with
environmental groups such as Environmental Defense
Fund, Conservation International, World Wildlife Fund,
and the Natural Resources Defense Council, along
with dozens of other large and small organizations.
Through Wal-Mart’s Food and Agriculture Sustainable
Value Network, the company brought conservation
organizations together with Wal-Mart staff and
suppliers to discuss collaborative approaches to
sustainability. Wal-Mart also supports the Conserva-
tion Alliance for Seafood Solutions and its “Common
Vision for Environmentally Sustainable Seafood,”
which aims to build an active partnership between
conservation organizations and seafood retailers in
support of achieving sustainable fisheries.

Labeling & Transparency: Wal-Mart labels products
that are MSC-certified. In 2007, Wal-Mart introduced
natural shrimp in 500 stores nationwide, using two
labels that described to consumers what they were
buying with the ACC standards, both at the factory
and farm levels. Since 2008, all shrimp purchased by
Wal-Mart is certified by the Aquaculture Certification
Council.

Red List Seafood Sales: Wal-Mart recently discon-
tinued red snapper. Greenpeace surveys found that
Wal-Mart sells twelve of the twenty-two red list spe-
cies: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallops, bigeye tuna, Chilean sea bass,
grouper, hoki, ocean quahog, South Atlantic albacore
tuna, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

10. Trader Joe’s
Banners: Trader Joe’s

Background: Trader Joe’s operates more than 300
stores in at least 23 states and prides itself on offering
rock-bottom prices and a wide array of single-serving
and prepared meals made with natural and organic
ingredients. Trader Joe’s buys directly from producers
and offers a variety of grocery products under its own
private label.

Greenpeace Comments: Trader Joe’s is turning
over a new leaf. After enduring months of protest and
direct campaign activity, the company has formally
acknowledged the fact that its customers want—and
deserve—sustainable seafood. In an effort to provide
environmentally friendly products to its shoppers, Trader
Joe’s has recently announced that it will cease the sale
of all unsustainable seafood products by December 31,
2012. Moreover, the chain has committed to:

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Trader Joe’s does not
yet have a sustainable seafood policy. Work is currently
underway to develop a chain-wide set of regulations that
will ensure sustainability throughout all areas of the store
that offer seafood products, including frozen, canned,
and smoked.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Trader Joe’s is not
formally affiliated with any retailer groups, fishing industry
groups, seafood companies, third-party auditors, or
environmental conservation organizations working on
seafood sustainability. That being said, the retailer has
publicly stated that it intends to create partnerships with
third-party scientific organizations. Information provided
to Greenpeace by Trader Joe’s strongly suggests that
some sort of partnership meeting this description is in its
formative stages.

• Creating a seafood policy that addresses key issues

like overfishing, destructive catch methods, and
the importance of marine reserves.

• Involving third-party, science-based organizations in

the creation of this policy.

• Using its buying power to leverage positive change

in the seafood industry.

• Supporting industry leaders that are making positive

efforts to “get off the red list.”

• Improving its labeling practices to include important
information, such as Latin names and catch/
production methods.

While this work has only just begun, Greenpeace
applauds Trader Joe’s for making these commitments
and for outlining a sensible and well-defined path
toward sustainability.

Labeling & Transparency: Trader Joe’s does not yet
sufficiently label seafood products so that consumers
can avoid purchasing destructively fished species, but
it has begun to address this issue internally. A recent
announcement by the company details plans to revisit
its labeling practices and to incorporate a great deal of
important information, such as Latin names and catch
methods, into future labeling protocol.

Red List Seafood Sales: Trader Joe’s has already
demonstrated significant improvement in this area. It
recently discontinued orange roughy and red snapper,
and in terms of overall inventory, the company is near
the head of the pack of those companies addressed
in Carting Away the Oceans. The company has also
pledged to use its buying power to support industry
leaders, such as producers of closed-containment
salmon and shrimp.

Greenpeace surveys found that Trader Joe’s sells nine of
the twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaskan pollock, Atlan-
tic salmon, Atlantic sea scallops, bigeye tuna, Greenland
halibut, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

11. Price Chopper
Banners: Price Chopper

Background: Founded and managed by the Golub
family, Price Chopper is a New England grocery chain
with 115 stores in New York, Vermont, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.
Price Chopper is privately held by the Golub family and
employees and, as the name suggests, offers low prices
on a variety of modern amenities like artisan breads,
custom-cut meats, and natural, organic, and kosher
products.

Greenpeace Comments: Price Chopper has recently
entered the seafood sustainability arena. A new sustain-
able seafood policy has helped the chain climb the ranks
significantly in this iteration of Carting Away the Oceans:
last year’s abysmal ranking of #19 has improved to #11,
thanks to a (barely) passing score.

While Greenpeace salutes Price Chopper’s progress,
concern remains over the staggering number of red list
species sold by the chain. Thankfully, comments sent to
Greenpeace by Price Chopper representatives indicate
that efforts continue. We are hopeful that we will see
more substantial improvement from this company in the
near future.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Price Chopper recently
introduced a sustainable seafood policy that prohibits
the company from selling certain items that are judged
untraceable or too unsustainable to be justifiable. This is
an excellent first step, and Greenpeace is eager to see
this policy grow stronger in the coming year.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Price Chopper has
not yet engaged in the policy arena, but it is forming
affiliations with various groups and third-party organiza-
tions in an effort to investigate its seafood operation.

Labeling & Transparency: Price Chopper does not
yet sufficiently label its seafood products, but work is
beginning in this area. Additionally, Price Chopper has
begun to use its Web presence, as well as in-store flyers,
to disseminate information about seafood sustainability.

Red List Seafood Sales: This is an area where Price
Chopper simply must improve if it hopes to find a path
toward true sustainability. Greenpeace surveys found
that Price Chopper sells an appalling eighteen of the
twenty-two red list seafoods: Atlantic halibut, Alaskan
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scal-
lops, Chilean sea bass, grouper, hoki, monkfish, ocean
quahog, orange roughy, redfish, shark, skates and rays,
South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp,
and yellowfin tuna.

12. ALDI
Banners: ALDI

Background: The ALDI chain of supermarkets started
in Germany and now operates in eighteen countries.
ALDI has over 850 stores across the United States,
making it one of the largest grocery retailers in the
nation. ALDI subsidiaries in Europe are developing
progressive seafood policies, but these have yet to
materialize in the United States.

Greenpeace Comments: ALDI continues to ignore
Greenpeace entreaties regarding seafood sustainability.
If there is any work being done on this issue within the
company, it is taking place behind closed doors, and
no information is being offered to consumers. On the
positive side, ALDI sells fewer red list items than any other
major retailer. If the company develops a comprehensive
seafood policy and improves its transparency, it could
rise substantially in the rankings.

Since ALDI has not responded to any Greenpeace
inquiries, all of the information in this report is gleaned
from annual reports, industry data, consumer surveys,
and publicly available information.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: ALDI does not have a
sustainable seafood policy.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: ALDI is not affiliated
with retailer groups, fishing industry groups, seafood
companies, third-party auditors, or environmental conser-
vation organizations working on seafood sustainability.

Labeling & Transparency: There do seem to be some
developments underway at ALDI regarding labeling. At
present, however, ALDI does not sufficiently label sea-
food products so that consumers can avoid purchasing
destructively fished species, and the company does not
promote sustainable seafood to its customers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
ALDI sells six of the twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaska
pollock, ocean quahog, orange roughy, South Atlantic
albacore tuna, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

13. The Kroger Company
Banners: Baker’s, City Market, Dillon’s, Food 4 Less, Foods Company, Fred Meyer, Fry’s, Gerbes,
Hilander, Jay C Food Stores, King Soopers, Kroger, Owen’s, PayLess Super Markets, Quality Food
Centers (QFC), Ralph’s, Scott’s, Smith’s

Background: Kroger is the nation’s largest grocery re-
tailer, operating over 2400 stores throughout the United
States. In order to compete with other high-volume
retailers, Kroger offers discount prices on seasonal
goods, merchandise, grocery items, and high-quality
perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce.

Greenpeace Comments: Kroger continues to inch
toward a more sustainable seafood operation, but at a
painfully slow pace. The company has demonstrated
some improvement since the last iteration of Carting
Away the Oceans in 2009, but it has been significantly
outpaced in the overall rankings by a number of com-
petitors: Kroger’s rank has plummeted from #9 to #13
even as its score has moderately improved.

Kroger recently partnered with the World Wildlife Fund
(WWF). This collaboration will likely catalyze some much
needed progress within the retailer’s seafood operation.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Kroger, in concert with
WWF, is in the final stages of developing its sustainable
seafood policy. Greenpeace eagerly awaits the release
of this policy and is certain that such a progressive step
will lead to not only significant conservation gain, but
also to a major increase in Kroger’s overall score.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Kroger has codified
a partnership with WWF aimed at analyzing the species
carried by the chain in order to determine what is and
what is not compatible with Kroger’s new direction. This
work has only recently begun.

Kroger is a member of the Food Marketing Institute’s
Sustainability Task Force and its recently formed
Sustainable Seafood Working Group. The company
is engaged in the Aquaculture Dialogs, a WWF-led
multi-stakeholder effort to create standards for aqua-
culture operations. Kroger also publicly endorses the
principles of the Conservation Alliance for Seafood
Solutions’s “Common Vision for Environmentally
Sustainable Seafood,” an initiative that aims to build
an active partnership between conservation organi-
zations and seafood retailers in support of achieving
sustainable fisheries.

Labeling & Transparency: Kroger’s new efforts to
investigate its seafood supply will certainly increase
transparency within the retailer’s chain of custody.
Kroger also disseminates advertisements and circu-
lars aimed at promoting relatively sustainable seafood
choices, such as Alaskan salmon. Still, Kroger does
not provide any significant level of in-store labeling or
point-of-purchase information.

Red List Seafood Sales: If Kroger hopes to
compete with the chains that are taking seafood
sustainability seriously, it must acknowledge its
abysmal inventory. Thankfully, recent statements to
Greenpeace indicate that the company has already
begun to address this problem.

Greenpeace surveys found that Kroger stores sell
seventeen of the twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaska
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea
scallops, Chilean sea bass, grouper, hoki, monkfish,
ocean quahog, orange roughy, red snapper, redfish,
shark, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish,
tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Banners: Acme, Albertson’s, Biggs, Bristol Farms, Country Market, Cub Foods, Farm Fresh, Hornbacher’s,
Jewel-Osco, Lucky, Save-a-Lot, Shaw’s, Star Market, Shop n’ Save, Shoppers

Background: Costco is the largest wholesale club
operator in the United States and operates about 530
membership warehouse stores that sell products in
bulk at below-retail prices. Costco serves more than
fifty million cardholders around the globe and in forty
US states.

Greenpeace Comments: Costco has become a
source of serious concern. The chain pays lip service
to seafood sustainability in its corporate shareholder
reports, yet it continues to sell staggering amounts
of products that are sourced from environmentally
dubious fisheries and farms. Costco has no tangible
sustainable seafood policy, participates in no significant
initiatives, offers virtually zero transparency in its chain
of custody, and has a large inventory of red list items.
Compared to the other major players in the big box
retail world, Costco trails far behind.

Over the past two-and-a-half years, Greenpeace has
repeatedly asked Costco about its seafood policies
and practices, both in preparation for our original
Carting Away the Oceans report and for subsequent
retailer performance updates: the company has failed
to respond to any of Greenpeace’s inquiries. All of the
information in this report is gleaned from annual reports,
industry data, consumer surveys, and publicly available
information.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Costco does not seem
to have a sustainable seafood policy. Recent verbiage
released by the company in its January 2009 Corporate
Sustainability Report hints at certain issues—such as
the conditions of fish stocks and regulatory agency
guidelines—that merit “consideration,” but Greenpeace

auditors have noticed no change whatsoever in
Costco’s sourcing practices vis-à-vis what is available
in the company’s product line. Greenpeace strongly
urges Costco to develop a comprehensive, publicly
available sustainable seafood policy that provides
sensible baselines and metrics for measuring and
reducing the impact of the chain’s seafood operation
upon our oceans.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Costco has
participated in dialogues with World Wildlife Fund
regarding the environmental and social impacts
of shrimp aquaculture. Beyond this, Costco is not
affiliated with any retailer groups, fishing industry
groups, seafood companies, third-party auditors, or
environmental conservation organizations working on
seafood sustainability.

Labeling & Transparency: Costco does not suf-
ficiently label seafood products so that consumers can
avoid purchasing destructively fished species, nor does
it promote sustainable seafood to its customers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
that Costco continues to sell fifteen of the twenty-two
red list seafoods: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic
salmon, Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass,
grouper, monkfish, ocean quahog, orange roughy, red
snapper, redfish, South Atlantic albacore tuna, sword-
fish, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Greenpeace April 2010

Background: SUPERVALU is a supersized
grocery retailer. Through an extensive network of
subsidiaries, SUPERVALU operates more than 2500
stores nationwide. Its numerous banners ensure a
SUPERVALU store format for virtually every con-
sumer demographic—gourmet, hard to find specialty
groceries, bulk and discount groceries, etc.

Greenpeace Comments: SUPERVALU continues
to languish near the rear of the pack in terms of its
awareness of sustainable seafood issues. This is
truly unfortunate, as the retailer sells an enormous
amount of seafood. Greenpeace is growing
extremely concerned with this grocery chain’s blasé
behavior when it comes to seafood sustainability.

In response to Greenpeace inquiries in preparation
for this report, Haley Meyer of SUPERVALU Com-
munications provided a response that acknowledged
the importance of seafood sustainability but included
few details about SUPERVALU’s efforts to improve
its seafood sustainability performance. Although
SUPERVALU has begun the process of developing
a sustainable seafood policy, it still ranks as one of
the poorest performing national chains per Green-
peace’s seafood standards, in part due to the very
large number of red list species it sells. SUPERVALU
could significantly improve its score by eliminating
red list species like shark, orange roughy, Chilean
sea bass, and hoki.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: SUPERVALU does not
have a sustainable seafood policy. The company’s new
partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) will
hopefully address this issue sooner rather than later.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: SUPERVALU
recently teamed up with WWF to investigate the
company’s seafood operation. SUPERVALU is also a
member of the Food Marketing Institute’s Sustainability
Task Force.

Labeling & Transparency: SUPERVALU does not
sufficiently label seafood products so that consumers
can avoid purchasing destructively fished species, and
the company does not promote sustainable seafood to
its customers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
that SUPERVALU retail banners sell an atrocious eigh-
teen of the twenty-two red list seafoods: Alaskan pollock,
Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea scallops,
Chilean sea bass, Greenland halibut, grouper, hoki,
monkfish, ocean quahog, orange roughy, red snapper,
redfish, shark, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish,
tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

16. Giant Eagle
Banners: Giant Eagle

Background: Giant Eagle operates over 230 stores
in four states through direct corporate ownership and
franchises. The company focuses on busy families by
providing children’s play centers, express prepared
meals, and the “Market District”—an extensive in-store
counter with chef-prepared fresh seafood, meats, and
vegetables for quick and convenient meals. Giant Eagle
has many progressive policies concerning the environ-
ment, but it has yet to include seafood sustainability as
a visible part of its efforts.

Greenpeace Comments: Giant Eagle has ignored
multiple inquiries from Greenpeace about its seafood
policies and practices. All of the information in this report
is gleaned from annual reports, industry data, consumer
surveys, and publicly available information.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Giant Eagle does not
have a sustainable seafood policy.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Giant Eagle
recently formed a partnership with the World Wildlife
Fund (WWF). Giant Eagle is also a member of the Food
Marketing Institute’s Sustainability Task Force, but not its
Sustainable Seafood Working Group.

Labeling & Transparency: Giant Eagle does not
sufficiently label seafood products so that consumers
can avoid purchasing destructively fished species, nor
does the company promote sustainable seafood to its
customers.

Greenpeace April 2010

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
that Giant Eagle sells fifteen of the twenty-two red list
seafood items: Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic
salmon, Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass, grouper,
ocean quahog, orange roughy, red snapper, redfish,
shark, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical
shrimp and, yellowfin tuna.

17. Publix
Banners: Publix

Background: Publix is the largest employee-owned
supermarket chain in the United States. A fast-growing
chain, Publix currently operates over 900 supermarkets
in five southern states and is quickly outpacing southern
competitors like Winn-Dixie. Publix is neither a “big box”
store nor a small neighborhood grocery—it offers basics
like dairy, produce, deli, bakery, and meat and seafood
counters, as well as an expanding line of GreenWise
Market items.

Greenpeace Comments: Publix appears poised to
make some real changes, but as of now the company
still lacks a sustainable seafood policy. Publix does
not offer any information on seafood sustainability to
its customers, and responses to Greenpeace inquires
have been largely lacking in substance, providing little
information on any seafood developments that may or
may not be occurring within the company.

In addition to its silence on its seafood policies, Green-
peace surveys found that Publix sells a large number
of red list species already dropped by many of its
competitors, such as shark, orange roughy, and Chilean
sea bass. Publix would serve its customers, employees,
and the oceans well by developing and implementing
sustainable seafood policies and practices.

All of the information in this report is gleaned from
annual reports, industry data, consumer surveys,
publicly available information, and Publix customer
correspondence.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Publix does not have a
sustainable seafood policy. The company did, however,
initiate the “Publix Seafood Sustainability Summit” last
year, which seems to indicate that Publix is beginning
to think about these issues more seriously.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Publix has
recently teamed up with the Sustainable Fisheries
Partnership, but the objectives for this arrangement
are not yet understood. Publix is also a member of the
Food Marketing Institute’s Sustainability Task Force.

Labeling & Transparency: Publix does not suf-
ficiently label seafood products so that consumers can
avoid purchasing destructively fished species, and the
company does not promote sustainable seafood to its
customers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys
and information provided by Publix customer cor-
respondence have revealed that Publix sells a dismal
sixteen of the twenty-two red list species: Alaskan
pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sea
scallops, Chilean sea bass, Greenland halibut, grouper,
monkfish, ocean quahog, orange roughy, red snapper,
shark, South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical
shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

18. Winn-Dixie

19. Meijer
Banners: Meijer

Background: Since emerging from Chapter 11 in late
2006, Winn-Dixie has been renovating and rebuilding its
grocery business with renewed energy. Headquartered
in Florida, Winn-Dixie operates more than 500 grocery
stores in the southeastern United States.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Winn-Dixie is not
affiliated with retailer groups, fishing industry groups,
seafood companies, third-party auditors, or environ-
mental conservation organizations working on seafood
sustainability.

Greenpeace Comments: Winn-Dixie continues to
ignore all inquiries from Greenpeace about its seafood
policies and practices. Winn-Dixie’s inaction on seafood
sustainability results in its consistently low score on
Greenpeace’s seafood scorecard.

Labeling & Transparency: Winn-Dixie does not
sufficiently label seafood products so that consumers
can avoid purchasing destructively fished species, and
the company does not promote sustainable seafood to
its customers.

All of the information in this report is gleaned from annual
reports, industry data, consumer surveys, and publicly
available information.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Winn-Dixie does not have
a sustainable seafood policy.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
that Winn-Dixie sells twelve of the twenty-two red list
seafoods: Alaska pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallops, grouper, ocean quahog, orange
roughy, red snapper, redfish, South Atlantic albacore
tuna, tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Background: Meijer started as a tiny grocery shop
in 1934. Today, the privately held Meijer grocery chain
is one of the largest grocery retailers in the Midwest.
Meijer stores are open twenty-four hours a day, seven
days a week. In addition to selling groceries, Meijer
offers automobile services, household goods, in-store
restaurants, gas stations, and electronics.

Greenpeace Comments: Yet another year has passed
with Meijer ignoring the state of our oceans. The com-
pany failed to acknowledge any Greenpeace inquiries
regarding seafood sustainability policies and practices,
and it has not communicated at all with its customers
regarding these important issues. Companies like this
are simply ignoring reality—their irresponsible business
practices will continue to deprive consumers of access
to seafood as one species after another is depleted.
Mejier and other companies at the bottom of the barrel
must realize that seafood consumers are increasingly
unwilling to patronize retailers that act with such disre-
gard for our planet.

All of the information in this report is gleaned from
annual reports, industry data, consumer surveys, and
publicly available information.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: Meijer does not have a
sustainable seafood policy.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: Meijer is not
affiliated with retailer groups, fishing industry groups,
seafood companies, third-party auditors, or environ-
mental conservation organizations working on seafood
sustainability.

Labeling & Transparency: Meijer does not sufficiently
label seafood products so that consumers can avoid
purchasing destructively fished species, and the
company does not promote sustainable seafood to its
customers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Greenpeace surveys found
that Meijer stores sell fourteen of the twenty-two red list
seafoods: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon,
Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass, Greenland
halibut, grouper, ocean quahog, orange roughy, redfish,
South Atlantic albacore tuna, swordfish, tropical shrimp,
and yellowfin tuna.

20. H.E. Butt
Banners: H.E.B., Central Market

Background: H.E. Butt is one of the most successful
privately held grocers in the country and currently
operates more than 300 stores in Texas and Mexico.
H.E.Butt takes a conventional approach to grocery retail-
ing and is expanding its offerings of non-grocery items in
order to compete with retailers like Wal-Mart.

Greenpeace Comments: To the detriment of our
oceans, H.E. Butt continues to ignore reality. The
company has no apparent interest whatsoever in
acknowledging seafood sustainability. It ignores all
inquiries from Greenpeace about its seafood policies
and practices, and it languishes at the rear of the pack
in terms of corporate responsibility when it comes to
seafood sustainability. Supporting a company like this
is simply not a feasible choice for any consumers who
care about the welfare of our planet.

All of the information in this report is gleaned from
annual reports, industry data, consumer surveys, and
publicly available information.

Sustainable Seafood Policy: H.E. Butt does not have
a sustainable seafood policy.

Seafood Sustainability Initiatives: H.E. Butt is not
affiliated with retailer working groups, fishing industry
groups, seafood companies, third-party auditors, or
environmental conservation organizations working on
seafood sustainability.

Labeling & Transparency: H.E. Butt does not suf-
ficiently label seafood products so that consumers can
avoid purchasing destructively fished species, and it
does not promote sustainable seafood to its customers.

Red List Seafood Sales: Recent Greenpeace surveys
found that H.E. Butt stores sell sixteen of the twenty-two
red list seafoods: Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod, Atlantic
salmon, Atlantic sea scallops, Chilean sea bass, grouper,
monkfish, ocean quahog, orange roughy, red snapper,

tropical shrimp, and yellowfin tuna.

Call to Action

Greenpeace calls upon all seafood retailers
to enact strong, effective, sustainable seafood
policies that will reduce pressure on flagging fish
stocks and help heal our ailing oceans. Intolerably
destructive practices, such as bottom trawling
and other high-bycatch fishing methods, must
be called out by name as unacceptable within
these policies, which need to set guidelines that
preclude purchasing fish from unsustainable
operations. These policies must also include pro-
tocols that increase overall transparency within
the chain of custody, both to reduce patronization
of pirate fishing and to provide more information
to the customer at point-of-purchase. Retailers
must also begin to participate more actively in
the political process; they must use their massive
buying power to leverage positive change in our
oceans and to support governmental initiatives

that will create marine protected areas (MPAs)
and other measures integral to a sensible,
ecosystem-based fisheries management
approach. Lastly, responsible retailers should
demonstrate their commitment to this process
by removing key red list species from their
inventories immediately. If we are to save our
oceans from destruction by over-exploitation,
we cannot continue to sell unsustainable spe-
cies like shark, orange roughy, and hoki. There
is a better way to sell seafood, and it is time
for progressive retailers to take the reins and
lead the industry away from the environmentally
negligent practices that have literally brought us
to the brink of catastrophe.
