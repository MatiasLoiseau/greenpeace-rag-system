foreword

There is now growing
awareness on the
imperatives for a global
energy future which marks
a distinct departure from
past trends and patterns
of energy production and
use. These imperatives
emerge as much from the
need to ensure energy
security, as they do from
the urgency of controlling
local pollution from
combustion of different
fuels and, of course, the
growing challenge of
climate change, which
requires reduction in
emissions of greenhouse
gases (GHSs), particularly
carbon dioxide.

This publication provides stimulating analysis on future scenarios of
energy use, which focus on a range of technologies that are expected to
emerge in the coming years and decades. There is now universal
recognition of the fact that new technologies and much greater use of
some that already exist provide the most hopeful prospects for
mitigation of emissions of GHGs. It is for this reason that the
International Energy Agency, which in the past pursued an approach
based on a single time path of energy demand and supply, has now
developed alternative scenarios that incorporate future technological
changes. In the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well, technology is included as a
crosscutting theme in recognition of the fact that an assessment of
technological options would be important both for mitigation as well as
adaptation measures for tackling climate change.

The scientific evidence on the need for urgent action on the problem of
climate change has now become stronger and convincing. Future
solutions would lie in the use of existing renewable energy technologies,
greater efforts at energy efficiency and the dissemination of
decentralized energy technologies and options. This particular
publication provides much analysis and well-researched material to
stimulate thinking on options that could be adopted in these areas. It is
expected that readers who are knowledgeable in the field as well as
those who are seeking an understanding of the subjects covered in the
ensuing pages would greatly benefit from reading this publication.

CONDITIONS. AT LEAST 10 FACILITIES OF THIS TYPE WILL BE ERECTED 20 KM OFF THE ISLAND DARSS IN THE BALTIC SEA BY 2007. TWO TECHNICIANS WORKING INSIDE THE TURBINE.

The good news first. Renewable energy, combined with energy efficiency,
can meet half of the world’s energy needs by 2050. This new report,
“Energy [R]evolution: A Blueprint for Solving Global Warming,” shows
that it is not only economically feasible, but also economically desirable,
to cut U.S. CO2 emissions by almost 75% within the next 43 years.
These reductions can be achieved without nuclear power, and while
virtually ending U.S. dependence on coal. Contrary to popular opinion, a
massive uptake of renewable energy and efficiency improvements alone
can solve our global warming problem. All that is missing is the right
policy support from the President and Congress.

The bad news is that time is running out. The overwhelming consensus
of scientific opinion is that the global climate is changing and that this
change is caused in large part by human activities; if left unchecked, it
will have disastrous consequences for Earth’s ecosystems and societies.
Furthermore, there is solid scientific evidence that we must act now.
This is reflected in the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC), a collaborative effort involving more than
1,000 scientists. Its next report, due for release early this year, is
expected to make the case for urgent action even stronger.

In the United States there is a groundswell of activity at the local and
state levels. Many mayors, governors, and public and business leaders
are doing their part to address climate change. But they can only do so
much; action is needed at the federal level. Now is the time for a
national, science-based cap on greenhouse gas emissions.

It’s time for a national plan to address global warming. Such a plan will
create jobs, improve the security of America’s energy supply, and protect
Americans from volatile energy prices. It will restore America’s moral
leadership on the critical international issue of climate change. And real
action in the United States will inspire confidence as the rest of the
world negotiates future global commitments to address climate change.

In addition to global warming, other energy-related challenges have
become extremely pressing. Worldwide energy demand is growing at a
staggering rate. Over-reliance on energy imports from a few, often
politically unstable, countries, and volatile oil and gas prices, have
together pushed energy security to the top of the political agenda, while
threatening to inflict a massive drain on the global economy. But while
there is a broad consensus that we need to change the way we produce
and consume energy, there is still disagreement about what changes are
needed and how they should be achieved.

the energy scenario

The European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) and Greenpeace
International commissioned this report from the Department of
Systems Analysis and Technology Assessment (Institute of Technical
Thermodynamics) at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). The
Worldwatch Institute was hired to serve as a technical consultant for
the U.S. and North American portions of the report. The report
presents a scenario for how the United States can reduce CO2 emissions
dramatically and secure an affordable energy supply on the basis of
steady worldwide economic development through the year 2050. Both
of these important aims can be achieved simultaneously. The scenario
relies primarily on improvements in energy efficiency and deployment of
renewable energy to achieve these goals. The future potential for
renewable energy sources has been assessed with input from all sectors
of the renewable energy industry, and forms the basis of the Energy
[R]evolution Scenario.

the potential for renewable energy

Renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines, solar
photovoltaic panels, biomass power plants, solar thermal collectors, and
biofuels are rapidly becoming mainstream. The global market for
renewable energy is growing dramatically; global investment in 2006
reached US$38 billion, 26% higher than the previous year.

The time window available for making the transition from fossil fuels to
renewable energy is relatively short. Today, energy companies have plans to
build well over 100 coal-burning power plants across the United States; if
those plants are built, it will be impossible to reduce CO2 emissions in time
to avoid dangerous climate impacts. But it is not too late yet.

We can solve global warming, save money, and improve air and water
quality without compromising our quality of life. Strict technical
standards are the only reliable way to ensure that only the most
efficient transportation systems, industrial equipment, buildings, heating
and cooling systems, and appliances will be produced and sold.
Consumers should have the opportunity to buy products that minimise
both their energy bills and their impact on the global climate.

from vision to reality

This report shows that business as usual is a recipe for climate chaos.
If the world continues on its current course, CO2 emissions will almost
double by 2050, with catastrophic consequences for the natural
environment, the global economy, and human society as a whole. We
have the opportunity now to change that course, but the window is
narrow and closing quickly.

The policy choices of the coming years will determine the world’s
environmental and economic situation for many decades to come. The
world cannot afford to stick to the conventional energy development
path, relying on fossil fuels, nuclear, and other outdated technologies.
Energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy must play
leading roles in the world’s energy future.

For the sake of a sound environment, political stability, and thriving
economies, now is the time to commit to a truly secure and sustainable
energy future - a future built on clean technologies, economic
development, millions of new jobs, and a liveable environment.

the energy [r]evolution

The climate change imperative demands nothing short of an Energy
Revolution. At the core of this revolution will be a change in the way
that energy is produced, distributed, and consumed. The good news is
that America is blessed with some of the best renewable energy
resources in the world and after initial success with energy efficiency
following the oil crisis in the 70s, there is still enormous potential for
improvement in the United States.

This report shows that we have a choice: we can cut carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions in the United States nearly 75% by 2050 without
relying on dangerous nuclear power or expensive new coal technologies.
With rapid deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy we
can stop global warming.

Spurred by oil-price volatility and the war in Iraq, the issue of energy
security is now at the top of the energy policy agenda. One reason for
price increases is that supplies of all fossil fuels - oil, gas, and coal -
are becoming scarcer and more expensive to produce. The days of cheap
oil and gas are coming to an end. At the same time green energy is
booming business in America, and this growth has to continue if we are
going to stop global warming. Renewable energy technologies can
deliver the energy we need, as this report shows, but only with
consistent support based on an understanding that solving global
warming is our top energy priority.

The solution to our future energy needs lies in greater use of renewable
energy sources for both heat and power. Nuclear power is not the
solution. There are multiple threats to people and the environment from
its operations. These include the risks and environmental damage from
uranium mining, processing, and transport the risk of nuclear weapons
proliferation; the unsolved problem of nuclear waste; and the potential
hazard of a serious accident. In addition, uranium, the fuel for nuclear
power, is a finite resource. By contrast, the reserves of renewable energy
that are technically accessible globally are large enough to provide
many times more power than the world currently consumes - forever.

Renewable energy technologies vary widely in their technical and
economic maturity, but there is a range of technologies that offer
increasingly attractive options. These include wind, biomass, solar,
geothermal, ocean, and hydroelectric power. Their common feature is
that they produce little or no greenhouse gases, and rely on virtually
inexhaustible natural sources for their “fuel.” Some of these
technologies are already competitive, and their economics will continue
to improve as they develop technically. The price of fossil fuels, on the
other hand, continues to rise.

At the same time there is enormous potential for reducing our energy
consumption, while providing the same level of energy services. This study
details a series of energy efficiency measures that together can substantially
reduce demand in industry, homes, business, and transportation.

figure 1: usa: carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced by nearly three-quarters.

We have a long way to go. Today in America less than 10% of
electricity is generated renewably, while the contribution of renewables
to heat supply is only 8%. More than 95% of America’s primary
energy supply still comes from fossil fuels and CO2 emissions are
projected to increase by more than 50% under the Reference Scenario.

The United States faces a significant increase in expenditure on
electricity supply under the Reference Scenario. The undiminished
growth in demand for electricity, increase in fossil fuel prices, and cost
of CO2 emissions will all result in North America’s electricity supply
costs rising from $290 billion per year to $750 billion per year in
2050. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario, on the other hand, not only
meets global CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilize energy
costs and thus relieves the economic pressure on society. Increasing
energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to renewable energy
resources reduces the net long-term costs for electricity supply by 40%
compared to the Reference Scenario. In other words, following
stringent environmental targets in the energy sector makes not only
good environmental sense, but good economic sense, as well.

to make the energy [r]evolution real and to avoid
dangerous climate change, greenpeace recommends
that the United States:

• phase out of all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy,

• set legally binding targets for renewable energy,

• provide defined and stable returns for renewable energy investors,

• guarantee priority access to the grid, and

• institute strong efficiency standards for all appliances, buildings,

and vehicles.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A BLUEPRINT FOR SOLVING GLOBAL WARMING

The challenges posed by global warming are great and they require new
ways of thinking about energy. At the core of the Energy [R]evolution
will be a change in the way that energy is produced, distributed, and
consumed. The five key principles behind this shift are:

1. respecting the natural limits of the environment,

2. implementing renewable solutions, especially through decentralized

energy systems,

3. phasing out dirty, unsustainable energy sources,

4. decoupling economic growth from the consumption of fossil fuels, and

5. creating greater equity in the use of resources.

Two contrasting scenarios are outlined in this report, the Reference
Scenario and the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. The Reference
Scenario is based on the Reference Scenario published by the
International Energy Agency (IEA) in World Energy Outlook 2004, and
extrapolated forward from 2030. In its report the IEA suggests that
global CO2 emissions will almost double as energy demand grows and
most of that demand is met with coal, gas, and oil.

The first goal of the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is to cut global carbon
dioxide emissions in half by mid-century. The second objective is to achieve
these reductions while phasing out nuclear energy. This report shows how
the United States can achieve these goals. It outlines how the U.S. can
more fully exploit the large potential for reducing energy demand through
energy efficiency, to ensure we are using our energy resources wisely. At
the same time, cost-effective renewable energy sources are accessed for
heat, electricity generation, and the production of biofuels.

the Energy [R]evolution Scenario describes a
development pathway to transform the present situation
into a safe, sustainable energy supply. the key findings of
the scenario are as follows:

• The electricity sector can pioneer renewable energy development. By
2050, nearly 80% of electricity can be produced from renewable
energy sources. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario 34% is
generated by wind, 18% by solar, 14% by hydro, and 9% biomass.
There is a smaller amount of ocean energy and geothermal power, as
well as nearly 20% fossil generation, 85% of which is natural gas.

• Under our Energy [R]evolution Scenario total carbon dioxide

emissions are reduced 72% without resorting to an increase in
dangerous nuclear power or new coal technologies.

• In the heat supply sector, the contribution of renewables will grow to
more than 60% by 2050. Fossil fuels will be increasingly replaced by
more efficient modern technologies, in particular biomass, solar, and
geothermal technologies.

• America’s oil use can be cut over 50% by 2050 with much more efficient
cars and trucks potentially including new plug-in hybrids, use of biofuels,
and greater reliance on electricity for public transportation.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A BLUEPRINT FOR SOLVING GLOBAL WARMING

the development of future global energy demand is
determined by three key factors:

• Population development: the number of people consuming energy or

using energy services.

• Economic development, for which Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is
the most commonly used indicator. In general, an increase in GDP
triggers an increase in energy demand.

• Energy intensity: how much energy is required to produce a unit of GDP.

Both the Reference and energy [r]evolution scenarios are based on the same
projections of population and economic development. The future development
of energy intensity, however, differs between the two, taking into account the
measures to increase energy efficiency under the energy [r]evolution scenario.

projection of population development

Following the IEA’s Reference Scenario, which uses United Nations
population development projections, the population of America will increase
from 300 million people now to 420 million in 2050. This continuing growth
will put additional pressure on energy resources and the environment.

projection of energy intensity

An increase in economic activity and a growing population does not
necessarily have to result in an equivalent increase in energy demand. There is
still a large potential for exploiting energy efficiency measures. Under the
Reference Scenario, we assume that energy intensity will be reduced by 1.3%
per year, leading to a reduction in final energy demand per unit of GDP of
about 45% between 2003 and 2050. Under the energy [r]evolution scenario,
it is assumed that active policy and technical support for energy efficiency
measures will lead to an even higher reduction in energy intensity of 70%.

development of global energy demand

Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth and
energy intensity results in future development pathways for energy
demand in America. These are shown in Figure 17 for both the
Reference and the energy [r]evolution scenarios. Under the Reference
Scenario, total energy demand increases by almost 50% from the
current 95,000 PJ/a to 143,000 PJ/a in 2050. In the energy
[r]evolution scenario, a decrease is expected to 56,000 PJ/a by 2050,
half of the projected consumption under the Reference Scenario.

An accelerated increase in energy efficiency, which is a crucial
prerequisite for achieving a sufficiently large share of renewable
sources in energy supply, will be beneficial not only for the environment
but from an economic point of view. Taking into account the full life
cycle, in most cases the implementation of energy efficiency measures
saves money compared to increasing energy supply. A dedicated energy
efficiency strategy therefore helps to compensate in part for the
additional costs required during the market introduction phase of
renewable energy sources.

Under the energy [r]evolution scenario, electricity demand is expected
to decrease. With the exploitation of efficiency measures, an increase
can be avoided despite continuing economic growth, leading to
electricity demand of around 3,600 TWh/a in 2050. Compared to the
Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about
3,200 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demand can be achieved in
particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using the
best available technology in all demand sectors. Introduction of passive
solar design in both residential and commercial buildings will help to
curb the growing demand for active air-conditioning.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the energy
[r]evolution scenario, final demand for heat supply will experience a steep
decline (see Figure 17). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption
equivalent to 87,500 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. As
a result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residential
buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and ‘passive
houses’ for new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energy
services will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.

In the transport sector, which is not analysed in detail in the present
study, it is assumed under the energy [r]evolution scenario that energy
demand will decrease by 10% to 27,000 PJ/a by 2050, saving half of
the demand expected under the Reference Scenario. This reduction can
be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting
the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-
related behaviour patterns.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A BLUEPRINT FOR SOLVING GLOBAL WARMING

electricity generation

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a
dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing share
of renewable electricity. This will compensate for the phasing out of
nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants
required for grid stabilisation. By 2050 nearly 80% of the electricity
produced in the United States will come from renewable energy
sources. ‘New’ renewables - mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV -
will contribute most of electricity generation. The following strategy
paves the way for a future renewable energy supply:

• The phasing out of nuclear energy and rising electricity demand will
be met initially by bringing into operation new highly efficient gas-
fired combined-cycle power plants, plus an increasing capacity of
wind turbines and biomass. In the long term, wind will be the most
important single source of electricity generation.

• Solar energy, hydro and biomass will make substantial contributions to
electricity generation. In particular, as non-fluctuating renewable energy
sources, hydro, biomass and solar thermal, combined with efficient heat
storage, will be important elements in the overall generation mix.

• The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the
current 107 GW to 888 GW in 2050. Increasing renewable capacity by a
factor of eight within the next 43 years requires political support and
well-designed policy instruments, however. There will be a considerable
demand for investment in new production capacity over the next 20 years.

As investment cycles in the power sector are long, decisions on
restructuring America’s energy supply system need to be taken now.

To achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable energy sources, a
balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is of great importance.
This mobilisation depends on technical potentials, cost reduction and
technological maturity. Figure 22 shows the comparative evolution of the
different renewable technologies over time. Up to 2010, hydro power and
biomass will remain the main contributors to the growing market share.
After 2020, the growing use of wind will take over the lead, complemented
by electricity from photovoltaics and solar thermal power plants.

This scenario is only one possible renewable future. Relative growth rates
should not be taken for a Greenpeace endorsement of one technology
over another, but instead reflect the current understanding of resource
potential and somewhat conservative assumptions about expected
technological development. There are several renewable resources and
technologies that could provide a much larger source of energy in the
future than projected here. Geothermal power plants, for example, could
ultimately provide far more energy than is reflected in our scenario if
recent evaluations by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National
Renewable Energy Laboratory hold up. Similarly, ocean energy and solar
thermal power, both of which have tremendous resource potential, could
turn out to be more attractive than is currently understood. Therefore, the
scenario presented here may be quite conservative, given the sheer size of
the renewable resource base and the opportunity for technology
advancement and cost reductions during the study period.

heat supply

Development of renewables in the heat supply sector raises different
issues. Today, renewables provide 8% of primary energy demand for
heat supply, the main contribution coming from the use of biomass. The
lack of district heating networks is a severe structural barrier to the
large-scale utilisation of geothermal and solar thermal energy. Past
experience shows that it is easier to implement effective support
instruments in the grid-connected electricity sector than in the heat
market, with its multitude of different actors. Dedicated support
instruments are required to ensure a dynamic development.

• Energy efficiency measures can decrease the current demand

for heat supply by 30%.

• The increasing contribution of decentralised combined heat and
power production in a shrinking heat market will lead to a CHP
share of nearly 20% in 2050.

• For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as

geothermal energy will increasingly replace fossil fuel-fired systems.

• A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional

applications will lead to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

scenario is shown in Figure 26. Compared to the Reference Scenario,
overall energy demand will be reduced by over 60% in 2050. Half of
the remaining demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.
Note that because of the ‘efficiency method’ used for the calculation of
primary energy consumption, which postulates that the amount of
electricity generation from hydro, wind, solar and geothermal energy
equals the primary energy consumption, the share of renewables seems
to be lower than their actual importance as energy suppliers.

Whilst emissions of CO2 in the United States will increase by over 50%
under the Reference Scenario, under the energy [r]evolution scenario
they will decrease from 5,600 million tons in 2003 to 1,550 m/t in
2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 19.2 t to 3.7 t. In
spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing demand, CO2
emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency
gains and the increased use of biofuels will even reduce emissions in the
transport sector. Transport will take over as the largest source of CO2
emissions in the Unites Sates, with a share of 62% in 2050.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION
A BLUEPRINT FOR SOLVING GLOBAL WARMING

future costs of electricity generation

Figure 28 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies under
the energy [r]evolution scenario will still be competitive with the costs
of electricity generation in the Reference Scenario, partly because of
the additional CO2 emission costs that will be imposed on power
generation from 2010 onwards. From 2020 the cost difference will
increase from about 0.4 cents/kWh up to 1.8 cents/kWh in 2050. Note
that any increase in fossil fuel prices beyond the projection given in
Table 3 will reduce the gap between the two scenarios.

Due to growing demand, we face a significant increase in society’s
expenditure on electricity supply. Under the Reference Scenario, the
unchecked growth in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost
of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs for North America
rising from today’s $290 billion per year to more than $750 bn in 2050.
Figure 29 shows that the energy [r]evolution scenario not only complies
with global CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs
and relieve the economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency
and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for
electricity supply that are 40% lower than in the Reference Scenario. It
becomes clear that pursuing stringent environmental targets in the energy
sector also pays off in terms of economics.

(CO2 EMISSION COSTS IMPOSED FROM 2010 IN INDUSTRIALISED REGIONS, FROM 2020 IN ALL REGIONS, WITH

INCREASE FROM 15 $/TCO2 IN 2010 TO 50 $/TCO2 IN 2050)

Greenpeace is a global organisation that uses non-violent direct
action to tackle the most crucial threats to our planet’s biodiversity
and environment. Greenpeace is a non-profit organisation, present in
40 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. It
speaks for 2.8 million supporters worldwide, and inspires many
millions more to take action every day. To maintain its
independence, Greenpeace does not accept donations from
governments or corporations but relies on contributions from
individual supporters and foundation grants.

Greenpeace has been campaigning against environmental
degradation since 1971 when a small boat of volunteers and
journalists sailed into Amchitka, an area north of Alaska, where the
US Government was conducting underground nuclear tests. This
tradition of ‘bearing witness’ in a non-violent manner continues
today, and ships are an important part of all its campaign work.
