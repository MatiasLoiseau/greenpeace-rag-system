Summary Results
||The proposed Trans Mountain Expansion Project 
(TMEP) would increase the number of oil tankers 
carrying tar sands from Vancouver, Canada through 
the Salish Sea and down the Pacific Coast of the U  .S .
||This report presents a map and analysis of 176 oil 
tanker and barge departures from the Westridge 
Marine Terminal in British Columbia from 2013 to the 
beginning of 2018 .
||Over half (94) of those departures then sailed 
the length of the Pacific Coast to the port of Long 
Beach, California, with significant numbers heading 
to destinations in Washington State (36), the San 
Francisco Bay Area (23), and various locations in Asia 
and Hawaii (17) .
||These results indicate that while the physical 
pipeline may stop at the water’s edge, a diluted 
bitumen spill remains a risk for coastal communities 
all along the Pacific Coast — from British Columbia 
to Washington to Oregon to California .||Studies have estimated a 10%-29% chance of a “worst 
case” tanker spill (>100,000 barrels) over the next 50 
years  .
||The endangered Southern Resident orca population 
could be driven toward extinction by the increased 
ship noise, and risk of oil spills and ship strikes, 
resulting from TMEP  .
||Coastal communities that rely on fishing and tourism 
have suffered billions of dollars in economic damages 
following previous catastrophic marine oil spills .
||The $60 billion coastal economy of Washington, 
Oregon and California currently supports over 150,000 
jobs in commercial fishing and over 525,000 jobs in 
coastal tourism .
||In the British Columbia Lower Mainland, industries 
that rely on a clean coastline employ more than 
320,000 people . Studies have found that a major oil 
spill in Washington would cost $10 .8 billion, and one 
in Vancouver would cost $1 .2 billion (CAD) .

Introduction
The existing Trans Mountain pipeline currently transports ~300,000 barrels of oil per 
day (bpd) from Alberta, Canada, to the Pacific Coast. A majority of this oil arrives to 
refineries in Washington State via the Puget Sound Pipeline, but around 9-27% reaches 
the Westridge Marine Terminal (WMT) in Burnaby, British Columbia, where it is loaded 
onto oil tankers and barges for transport to refineries and other locations along the 
Pacific Coast and across the Pacific to Asia.1 
The proposed Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMEP) 
would expand the capacity of this system to 890,000 bpd,2 
and would increase the number of tankers leaving WMT by 
a factor of almost seven — from 5 per month to as many 
as 34 per month, or more than 400 a year  .3 Much of the oil 
transported by TMEP is expected to be diluted bitumen, 
or dilbit, extracted from Alberta’s tar sands .
While any oil spill into water is harmful and extremely 
difficult to clean up, the unique properties of dilbit 
could make clean-up even more difficult than a 
conventional oil spill .4 Furthermore, dilbit is one of 
the most carbon-intensive fuels on the planet, with 
total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions more than 
30% higher than standard crude oil .5 The tar sands are 
currently hampered by a lack of pipeline capacity and 
so the proposed construction of TMEP , Keystone XL and 
the Line 3 expansion pipelines could facilitate further 
investment in tar sands extraction and lead to greater 
global carbon emissions .6 
Numerous reports have warned of the threat to the 
waters of the Salish Sea in British Columbia and 
Washington, and the Pacific Coast from increased 
marine shipments of tar sands oil .7 8 9 Research has 
shown that since 2010, the U  .S . Oil refinery in Tacoma, 
WA has received ~20 shipments of tar sands oil per year 
(>1 .5 million barrels per year) via articulated tug barge 
(ATB)10 traveling from WMT  .11 12 Other reports have found 
that much of the tar sands leaving the WMT is shipped 
by tanker to refineries in California that have capacity to 
process heavy crude oil .13 A movement to oppose the construction of TMEP 
has arisen, led by several First Nations who have 
emphasized their lack of consent for the project, 
inadequate consultation by the Canadian government, 
and violations of Indigenous sovereignty  .14 Recently, 
Trans Mountain pipeline owner Kinder Morgan reached 
a deal with the Canadian government to sell the existing 
pipeline for $4 .5 billion (CAD) and build the TMEP  . This 
deal allows Kinder Morgan to walk away but potentially 
leaves Canadian taxpayers on the hook for a troubled 
and controversial project  .15 
In this briefing, we present a visualization of 176 tar sands 
tanker (and some ATB) shipments leaving WMT from 
2013 to 2018, showing the paths taken by those tankers 
down the Pacific Coast to refineries in the San Francisco 
and Long Beach areas .

Oil Tanker Traffic
The goal of this report is to illustrate which areas are at risk from increased tanker 
traffic and which destinations have received oil shipments originating from WMT. 
Using ship location data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), we were able 
to identify 176 departures from WMT from January 2013 to February 2018.16 In Figure 1, 
we map the tracks taken by those 176 departures from WMT to their next destination.17
Figure 1: Map of 176 tanker 
departures from the Westridge 
Marine Terminal showing the 
path to the next destination: Long 
Beach area (blue), San Francisco 
Bay area (red), Washington State 
(green), Asia & Hawaii (orange), 
other (gray) . Also shown are the 
Trans Mountain and Puget Sound 
pipelines, the Westridge Marine 
Terminal, and major refineries 
along the Pacific Coast  .

TAR SANDS TANKER SUPERHIGHWAY THREATENS PACIFIC COAST WATERS | 6As can be seen, the most popular destination for WMT 
tankers is the Long Beach area in California, followed 
by a number of destinations in the San Francisco Bay 
Area, Washington state, and a handful of voyages across 
the Pacific to various locations in Asia and Hawaii . 
The number of tanker tracks in this dataset for each 
destination is shown in Table 1 .18

The AIS data also clearly tracks the standard shipping 
channel that oil tankers (and all other large vessels) take 
when exiting the Salish Sea out the Strait of Juan de 
Fuca (Figure 2) . The route heading to the Pacific Ocean 
shows several twists and turns as the tankers make their 
way around islands and through a number of narrow 
passages . Turn Point, entering the Haro Strait near San 
Juan Island, has been identified as a particular risk for a 
tanker accident  .23 ATB traffic heading to Tacoma takes a 
more easterly route through the Rosario Strait  .It is important to note that departures from WMT are 
only a fraction of the total tanker and ATB traffic through 
Washington and British Columbia waters . In 2017, there 
were 534 entering transits by tank ships through the 
Strait of Juan de Fuca (339 to Washington ports and 
195 to Canadian ports) and there were over 1,000 ATB 
transits in Washington waters .24

dataset by destination for each year since 2013 . This 
dataset shows a general decline in the number of tanker 
departures from WMT reaching a minimum in 2016 and 
rebounding in recent years . However, further research 
is necessary to determine whether this AIS data has 
captured all relevant tanker shipments, and to fully 
quantify tar sands shipments by barge or ATB, before 
firm conclusions about these trends can be reached .

Risks from Tar Sands Shipments
A seven-fold increase in tar sands shipments leaving WMT translates into a significant 
increase in oil tanker traffic in B.C.’s Burrard Inlet, through the Salish Sea and down the 
U.S. Pacific Coast. Although the pipeline stops at the water’s edge in Burnaby, the risk 
from oil spills and other impacts does not.
Oil Spill Risk
Although stronger regulations appear to have reduced 
the rates of spills from oil tankers in the decades 
since the Exxon Valdez disaster,26 catastrophic tanker 
accidents do still occur (e .g . the 2018 Sanchi tanker spill 
in the South China Sea)27 and the Pacific Northwest has 
seen its share of devastating marine oil spills .28
Kinder Morgan’s own risk report estimated a “credible 
worst case” oil spill of 16,500 m3 (>100,000 barrels, 
or bbl) and an average spill case of 8,250 m3 (>50,000 
bbl) . This worst case volume was chosen to be larger 
than 90% of historical oil spills, but is smaller than the 
total volume of oil carried by tankers calling at WMT 
and is less than half the 260,000 bbl spilled by the 
Exxon Valdez in 1989 . One analysis of these projections 
found a 10% chance of a “worst case” spill and a 42% 
chance of an “average case” spill in the next 50 years .29 
The areas along the route with the highest likelihood 
of a spill included Vancouver Harbor and Juan de Fuca Strait, while Turn Point in the Haro Strait was found to 
be the location with the “greatest level of navigational 
complexity for the entire passage . ”30 Stochastic 
modeling of a worst case spill at Turn Point found a high 
probability of oil reaching most of the Salish Sea and 
extending out into the Pacific .31 
Independent risk analysis32 and oil spill modeling33 
commissioned by the Tsleil-Waututh nation found 
that in 50 years there was a 79-87% chance of an oil 
spill at WMT or in Burrard Inlet  . Over the 50-year time 
period, the study found a 37% likelihood of a large spill 
(>10,000 barrels) and a 29% chance of a “worst case” 
spill somewhere along the marine shipping route .34 A 
“worst case” oil spill within Burrard Inlet would foul 
up to 25 kilometers of shoreline within 48 hours and 
potentially impact the health of up to a million people .35 
Of particular concern from a spill would be exposure to 
known carcinogens present in dilbit, including benzene 
and 1,3-butadiene .36

TAR SANDS TANKER SUPERHIGHWAY THREATENS PACIFIC COAST WATERS | 10Economic Impacts from Oil Spills
The experience of communities impacted by the two 
largest U  .S . offshore oil spills in recent years — the 1989 
Exxon Valdez and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disasters 
— show the high stakes for local coastal economies .
On March 23, 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground and 
spilled ~260,000 barrels of oil into Prince William Sound in 
Alaska . Fisheries were closed immediately following the 
spill, which caused an estimated $300 million in economic 
damages to ~32,000 people whose livelihoods depended 
on commercial fishing .37 Salmon populations are now 
considered to have recovered, but the $8 million per 
year herring fishery collapsed in 1993 and has still yet to 
recover decades later  .38 There is debate about the causes 
of the collapse, but some local fishermen and scientists 
suspect the spill played a role . One study estimates the 
loss of the herring fishery has cost the region $1 billion .39 
Although clean-up operations offered temporary 
support for the local economy, declines in tourism40 and 
recreational fishing cost the state and local economy 
millions of dollars in the years following the spill .41 
Exxon ended up paying $3 .8 billion in clean-up costs 
and damages, but waged a lengthy court battle to avoid 
paying additional punitive damages to local Alaskans 
harmed by the spill .42 Monetary figures cannot fully 
encompass the “ecological, social, cultural, economic 
and psychological impacts on the residents of fishing 
communities and Native villages in Prince William 
Sound, ”43 and furthermore, there are still pockets of oil 
to be found in the region nearly 30 years later  .44
In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon disaster spilled 4 .9 
million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico closing 
many commercial fisheries and harming the Gulf Coast 
economy  .45 One study estimated closures affected 
more than 20% of the Gulf’s commercial catch and led 
to potential annual economic losses of $247 million .46 
Another study estimated the long-term losses from closed 
or degraded fisheries to be $8 .7 billion through 2020 .47 
Tourism losses (including “brand damage” due to the oil 
spill) through 2013 were estimated to be $22 .7 billion .48
It is clear that the Pacific Northwest region and the 
U .S . Pacific Coast as a whole would have much to lose 
from a catastrophic oil spill in their waters . A study by 
Earth Economics found that ecosystem services within 
the Puget Sound Basin provided $7 .4 to $61 .7 billion in 
benefits every year — benefits that are being lost as the 
ecosystem is degraded .49According to data from NOAA, commercial fisheries 
accounted for total sales of $21 .3 billion (California), 
$1 .7 billion (Washington), and $1 .1 billion (Oregon) in 
2015 . Additionally, the seafood industry supported jobs 
totaling 114,000 (California), 23,000 (Washington), and 
14,000 (Oregon) .50 In the region, Westport, WA, Astoria, 
OR, and Newport, OR, were ranked among the top 
ports nationally in terms of volume of seafood landed51 
Tourism and recreation are also significant sources of 
employment and GDP along the Pacific Coast  . Data 
from NOAA finds coastal tourism (including recreational 
fishing) contributed 420,000 (CA), 25,000 (OR), and 78,000 
(WA) jobs, while generating $22 .3 billion (CA), $1 billion 
(OR), and $4 .1 billion (WA) in GDP , respectively  .52

(Data: NOAA ENOW) and commercial fishing (Data: NOAA Fisheries 
Economics Report) for the three U  .S . states, and British Columbia 
jobs at risk from an oil spill (Data: CRED) . [* California fishing jobs 
include a significant number in the import sector  .]

TAR SANDS TANKER SUPERHIGHWAY THREATENS PACIFIC COAST WATERS | 11NOAA estimates the total ocean economy of the three 
U .S . states combined generates around $60 billion 
in GDP per year  . The whale watching industry in 
Washington State alone is estimated to generate $65-
$70 million per year and support around 40 whale 
watching companies .53 In Vancouver, British Columbia, 
“ocean-dependent activities” are estimated to contribute 
“32,520-36,680 [person-years] of employment and 
$3,061-$3,261 million [CAD] in GDP” every year  .54
Oil spills would threaten that economic base . The 
Washington State Department of Ecology estimates that 
a significant spill would “cost the state an average of 
$10 .8 billion (based on 2006 estimates) and adversely 
affect 165,000 jobs . ”55 A ~100,000 bbl spill at the First 
Narrows in Vancouver would lead to economic losses 
in the range of $215-$1,230 million CAD and threaten 
1,900-12,000 person-years of employment  .56 Another 
study found that industries that rely on the natural 
environment to support their brand and business 
“employ more than 320,000 people in the Lower 
Mainland” of British Columbia .57 Smaller-scale studies of 
the impact of oil spills on local economies were carried 
out for Gray’s Harbor, WA,58 and the Quinault Indian 
Nation .59 These studies found that a range of oil spill 
scenarios could lead to hundreds of direct job losses, 
hundreds of millions of dollars in declining business 
revenues, and impacts on subsistence and treaty-
protected resources .Ship Noise & Orcas
The Southern Resident orca population is listed as 
endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) 
in the U  .S .60 and under the Species at Risk Act in 
Canada .61 More than 2,500 square miles of the Salish 
Sea, Puget Sound, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca have 
been designated as orca Critical Habitat under the 
ESA .62 The Southern Resident population currently 
numbers 75 individuals, which represents a 20% 
decline over the past two decades .63 Significant threats 
to the continued viability of this population include the 
availability of their preferred prey (Chinook salmon), 
ship traffic and noise (which can interfere with foraging 
for prey and communication), water contamination 
(pollutants from fish they eat accumulate in their 
blubber), and ship strikes .64
Southern Residents reduce their feeding activity by 25% 
when boats are present, and increased shipping traffic due 
to TMEP could lead to the “near continuous” presence of 
tankers in the area . A recent study found that the increase 
in these threats due to the construction of TMEP would 
have serious consequences for the orca population, with 
>50% chance that the orca population would fall below 
30 individuals65 — a level that would put the population 
on the road to extinction . Washington Governor Jay 
Inslee has spoken out against TMEP ,66 highlighting 
the devastating impact it could have on the Southern 
Residents, and has formed a task force to assemble a plan 
to recover the orcas and Chinook salmon .

Conclusions
If the Trans Mountain Expansion Project is built, the 
seven-fold increase in tanker traffic and the associated 
risks laid out in this report show clearly that the risks 
of this pipeline project don’t end at the water’s edge . 
The costs and risks of the Trans Mountain Expansion 
Project will be borne by First Nations, Indigenous, 
and other communities along the pipeline and tanker 
superhighway routes, as well as by the wildlife and 
ecosystems that will be impacted .Any among the communities along the U  .S . Pacific 
Coast could be threatened by this increase in oil tanker 
traffic . It is critical that — for the sake of the health and 
safety of our communities, local economies, ocean 
life, and our climate — the Trans Mountain Expansion 
Project be halted .

16 Historical AIS data purchased from Marine Traffic  
https://www  .marinetraffic . com/en/ais-api-services/detail/ps01/vessel-
historical-track  . See Appendix A for more detail on data analysis .
17 Vessel tracks cannot be perfectly represented with only a 
sample of AIS locations . The tracks in this report use ~20 points 
each and, as such, cannot perfectly capture every turn of the 
route . Some tracks seem to cross land due to a lack of data 
coverage for the entire route .

TAR SANDS TANKER SUPERHIGHWAY THREATENS PACIFIC COAST WATERS | 1418 We categorize each vessel departure by its next primary port 
destination, as determined by Marine Traffic’s “next port” or 
“next call” fields, the AIS destination field, or analysis of the 
vessel track itself  . This data is not sufficient to determine which 
refinery in the destination region (if any) was the recipient of the 
transported oil .
