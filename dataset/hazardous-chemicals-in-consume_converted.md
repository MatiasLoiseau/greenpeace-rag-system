Summary

That hazardous chemicals are present in our environment is confirmed by several studies and is
becoming increasingly well documented. However, only few people are aware that a number of these
chemicals are used as additives in consumer goods we buy and use in our home everyday. In this study
33 consumer products, including body care products, toys, textiles, deodorizers and cleaners, have
been tested for the presence of bisphenol-A, alkylphenols and ethoxylates, phthalates, musks and
organotin compounds. Additionally a selected number of samples were analysed to identify other than
the target compounds.

The results show that most polymer products, or products containing polymer parts, do contain
nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates, phthalates or both. Especially the pyjamas with polymer
prints contain high concentrations of DINP and DIDP up to 54,000 mg/kg. The concentrations of
nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates in this samples averaged respectively 10 mg/kg and 1,000
mg/kg. A soft plastic baby toy contained, apart from nonylphenol and a number of target phthalates,
high amounts of the plasticizer di-isooctyl adipate. Bisphenol-A was quantified in a polycarbonate
baby bottle at 14 mg/kg while it was not found in canned food samples. Perfumes also contained
phthalates, especially di-ethyl phthalate, and musks, mainly the polycyclic musk HHCB and in one
case the nitro-musk MK. With one exception only low amounts of phthalates and musks were found in
shampoos, deodorizers and cleaning products. Organotin compounds were quantified in one pyjama
sample while others showed traces of these compounds.

Introduction

1.1  Hazardous chemicals

The progress of the chemical industry in the past century has supplied the world with a vast amount of
chemicals. At present roughly 100,000 chemicals are used and more than 500 new chemicals are
introduced annually 1. From these, several are known to cause adverse effects to man and animal life.
The best documented are probably the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as the
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and the pesticide DDT. Although the use of chemicals as PCBs and
DDT is forbidden for some time, it is still possible to measure these compounds in the environment
worldwide. Meanwhile, new chemicals have replaced these compounds, and some of these chemicals,
like phthalates, alkylphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates and brominated flame retardants (BFR) are
produced and used in huge amounts. Due to the production and use these compounds are found in
sediments and surface waters. A recent TNO study, conducted for Greenpeace and focusing on the
presence of hazardous chemicals in precipitation, showed that phthalates, alkylphenols, alkylphenol
ethoxylates, artificial musk compounds and flame retardants were present in precipitation samples 2.

1.2  Hazardous chemicals in consumer products

That such compounds are present in our environment is confirmed by several studies and is becoming
increasingly well documented 2, 3. However, only few people are aware that many of these chemicals
are used as additives in consumer goods we buy and use in our home everyday. This includes textiles,
carpets and curtains, television and computer equipment and also cosmetic products. Phthalate esters
and alkylphenol ethoxylates are used to soften PVC polymers used in toys and certain prints on
textiles. The same compounds and artificial musks are used in personal care products. Organotin
compounds are used to stabilise polymers and are therefore sometimes found in prints on T-shirts and
pyjamas and in polymer parts of diapers. Of course, these additives are there for a reason; flame
retardants are added to protect users against fire, while phthalates are added to soften plastics or as a
carrier in perfumes. However, a consequence of their presence in consumer products is that the user is
constantly exposed to these chemicals and that they will enter the environment during or after use of
the products. The latter aspect became apparent in the study into the presence of these compounds in
precipitation. While the results for AHTN, an artificial musk, indicated the presence of a localized
emission source, the results for HHCB, another artificial musk, indicated that diffuse emissions by the
domestic use of products containing this compound was probably the major source of emission to the
environment.

Study objective and approach

2.1  Objective of the Greenpeace study

A recent TNO study revealed the presence of a number of hazardous chemicals in precipitation4. The
objective of this study is to determine whether these compounds are also present in consumer
products. In an earlier Greenpeace study it was already shown that these compounds can be found in
the dust in common homes 5. This study presents the results for the presence and concentrations of
compounds in typical consumer products like cosmetics, textiles, toys and cleaning products.

2.2

Chemical parameters

In this study the decision was made to concentrate on compounds similar to those determinated in the
previous study in precipitation. The following chemical parameters were selected for this study:

•  Bisphenol-A
•  Alkylphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates
•  Phthalates
•  Artificial musk compounds
•  Organotin compounds
•

“Non-target compounds” not included in the compound groups listed above and that can be
identified in a screening analysis using gas chromatography in combination with mass
spectrometry

The individual chemicals are listed in table 1. Some additional information about the use of these
compounds can be found in chapter 4.

2.3

Samples

In total 33 samples were received, 28 from Greenpeace in the United Kingdom and 5 from Greenpeace
in The Netherlands. The samples are common consumer products, including cosmetics, textiles, toys,
air fresheners and cleaning products. All samples were purchased by Greenpeace in common shops in
August 2003 and coded. Of most samples a duplicate sample was available. Table 2 provides an
overview of the received samples.

Methods and materials

3.1

Sampling and sample pre-treatment

Samples were stored at room temperature until analysis. Samples consisting of a liquid or a suspension
were homogenised by shaking for 10 minutes. From solid samples a proportional sub-sample, with
respect to prints and coloured parts, was collected and cut into small pieces with clean scissors or a
surgical knife. For textiles the pieces were smaller than 5 mm, for all other materials smaller than 2
mm. For pasta samples the entire sample was homogenised using a blender. Sticky samples like paints
were mixed with sodium sulphate to obtain free flowing sub-samples. Depending on the type of
analysis a sub-sample of 1, 2, 5 or 10 grams was collected for analysis.

3.2

Analytical procedures

3.2.1  Sample extraction

3.2.1.1 Bisphenol-A in plastic

A sub-sample of the shredded material was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. A known amount of 2D-
biphenol-A (2D-BPA) was added as an internal standard. The tetrahydrofuran solution was poured into
excess ethanol to remove the polymer. After centrifugation and removal of the polymer, a part of the
clear liquid was collected and evaporated to dryness. The residue was re-dissolved in a 50/50 mixture
of HPLC water and methanol. Finally, the extract was filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and prepared
for instrumental analyses.

3.2.1.2 Bisphenol-A in pasta

A sub-sample of the homogenized sample was collected and 2D-BPA was added as an internal
standard. The sample was extracted in an Ultra Turrax with a 50/50 mixture of heptane and
acetonitrile. Following centrifugation the acetonitrile fraction was collected, and the remainder was
extracted once more after the addition of fresh acetonitrile. The combined acetonitrile fractions were
dried and evaporated to dryness. The residue was re-dissolved in a 50/50 mixture of HPLC water and
methanol. Finally, the extract was filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and prepared for instrumental
analyses.

3.2.1.3 Alkylphenols and ethoxylates in liquid samples and suspensions

A sub-sample was mixed with methanol in a 100 ml vial, shaken for 2 minutes and heated in a water
bath at 60°C for 15 minutes. Next, the vial was sonicated for 15 min until a homogenous suspension
resulted, and stored in a refrigerator at 4°C for 60 min. The sample was centrifuged and a part of the
clear liquid was evaporated to dryness. The residue was re-dissolved in a 50/50 mixture of HPLC
water and methanol. Finally, the extract was filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and prepared for
instrumental analyses.

3.2.1.4 Alkylphenols and ethoxylates in solid samples

A sub-sample of the shredded material was soxhlet extracted overnight with dichloromethane. The
extract was filtered if necessary and brought to a final volume of 100 ml with dichloromethane. A part

TNO-MEP-report: Determination of hazardous chemicals in consumer products, concept 090903.

of this extract was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The residue was re-dissolved in a 50/50
mixture of HPLC water and methanol. Finally, the extract was filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and
prepared for instrumental analyses.

3.2.1.5 Phthalates in liquid samples and suspensions

The sub-sample was mixed with hexane in a 100 ml vial and diphenyl phthalate (DPP) was added as
an internal standard. The mixture was shaken for 2 minutes and heated in a water bath at 60°C for 15
minutes. Next, the vial was sonicated for 15 min until a homogenous suspension resulted, and stored
in a refrigerator at 4°C for 60 min. The sample was centrifuged and a part of the clear liquid was
concentrated, filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and brought to a final volume of 1 ml. Finally, 1,2,3,4-
tetrachloronaphthalene was added as an injection standard.

3.2.1.6 Phthalates in solid samples

A sub-sample of the shredded material was brought into a soxhlet thimble and DPP was added as an
internal standard. The sample was extracted overnight with dichloromethane. The extract was filtered
if necessary and brought to a final volume of 100 ml with dichloromethane. A part of this extract was
concentrated, filtered through 0.45 µm filter and brought to a final volume of 1 ml. Finally, 1,2,3,4-
tetrachloronaphthalene was added as an injection standard.

3.2.1.7 Musks determination

A sub-sample was mixed with methanol in a 100 ml vial and phantolide (AHNI) was added as an
internal standard. The mixture was shaken for 2 minutes and heated in a water bath at 60°C for 15
minutes. Next, the vial was sonicated for 15 min until a homogenous suspension resulted, and stored
in a refrigerator at 4°C for 60 min. The sample was centrifuged and a part of the clear liquid was
concentrated, filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and brought to a final volume of 1 ml. Finally, 1,2,3,4-
tetrachloronaphthalene was added as an injection standard.

3.2.1.8 Organotin determination

A sub-sample was sonicated for 60 min in a sodium dithiocarbamate solution in ethanol after the
addition of tripropyltin chloride (TPrT) as an internal standard. The extracts are left in the dark at
room temperature overnight and sonicated a second time for 60 min. Next, the extracts were
centrifuged and the sample residue removed. Two more internal standards, mono- and diheptyltin
chloride (MHT and DHT) were added to control the extraction and derivatization procedure. After the
addition of an acetate buffer (pH 4), HPLC water and a solution of sodium tetraethylborate (the
derivatization agent) in ethanol, the mixture was extracted twice with hexane. The combined hexane
fraction were dried and concentrated to a small volume. After purification of the extract using column
chromatography on alumina, the extract is concentrated to a final volume of 1 ml and 1,2,3,4-
tetrachloronaphthalene is added as an injection standard.

3.2.1.9 GC/MS screening

Extracts for GC/MS screening were prepared in the same way as those for the phthalates. For samples
that were already extracted for phthalates, part of the phthalate extract was used for the GC/MS
analysis.

3.2.2  Instrumental analysis

BPA, APs and APEOs are analysed using liquid chromatography in combination with mass
spectrometry (LC/MS). The LC/MS was a Hewlett Packard 1100 LC/ESI/MS system equipped with a
guard column and a Waters Symmetry C18 analytical column, length 15 cm, 3.9 mm i.d., 5 µm particle
size. For BPA and APs negative ionisation was used, for APEOs positive ionisation. The mass
spectrometer was used in the selected ion monitoring mode and typically three ions were monitored
for BPA and APs. For APEOs fifteen ions (for n=1 to n=15, each separated by 44 mass units) were
monitored.

Phthalates, musks and organotin compounds were analysed using gas chromatography in combination
with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The GC/MS was a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph
equipped with HP-5MS capillary column, length 30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness, and
interfaced to a Hewlett Packard 5973 mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was used in the
selected ion monitoring mode and typically two or three ions were monitored for each compound. For
the GC/MS screening the same instrument was used in the scan mode, allowing the identification of
peaks in the chromatogram based on their mass spectrum.

3.2.3  Calculation of results

Identification of target compounds was based on retention time and qualifier ion ratio’s. Quantification
was based on external standards analysed within the same series as the sample extracts. The external
standards were prepared from commercially available pure substances. The number of ethoxy units in
the commercial alkylphenol ethoxylate standards ranged from n=5 to n=15 with a maximum around
n=8-9. In all cases peak areas were used for calculations. The recovery of the added extraction
standards was calculated but only the organotin results were corrected for this recovery. No correction
for blank value was applied.

The identification of non-target compounds in the GC/MS screening was based on a comparison of
mass spectra from the unknown compound peaks with reference mass spectra in a NIST/EPA/NIH
Mass Spectral Library and the NBS75K library in the HP ChemStation. The compounds were
considered positively identified if the correlation between spectra and library spectra was beter than
90%.

4.1

Bisphenol-A

4.1.1  General information

Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a widely used intermediate in the production of epoxy resins, polycarbonate
plastics and flame retardants, e.g. a substance used in an extensive range of products. Polycarbonate
plastics are produced by the condensation of carbonyl chloride with diol monomers. The most
common monomer for polycarbonates intended for food contact is BPA6, which is reacted with
carbonyl chloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide and a tertiary amine catalyst to form bisphenol-
A polycarbonate. Not polymerised BPA may be released from the polycarbonate. Research of a few
years ago indicated that BPA has estrogenic potency and is therefore generally included as one of the
suspected endocrine disruptors 7. BPA is moderately water soluble. The chemical structure of BPA is
given in the figure below.

BPA was found in polycarbonate baby bottles in concentrations up to 20 mg/kg8, but was not found to
migrate into baby food5. However, BPA was found in canned food in concentrations up to 0.007
mg/kg9, probably due to migration of polymer material on the inside of the can to the food.

4.1.2  Results for bisphenol-A in this study

Three samples, one baby bottle of polycarbonate and two canned food samples were analysed for
BPA. BPA was quantified in the baby bottle polymer (52003227-010) at a level of 14 mg/kg which
correlates well with known literature values8. In both canned food samples (52003227-019 and -020)
no BPA was detected, probably for two reasons. First, the quantification limit of the method used in
this study, 0.5 mg/kg, is much higher than the literature values found for BPA in canned food.
Secondly, if BPA is found in canned food, this is always in foods with a moderate or high fat content.
The pasta samples analysed in this study typically have a low fat content and therefore migration of
BPA from the polymer to the food is probably not promoted.

The results for BPA are presented in table 3 in the appendix.

Alkylphenols (APs) and alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs) are used in plastics as additives and as
surface-active ingredients in industrial detergents and emulsifiers. APs commonly used are
nonylphenol (NP) and to a lesser extent octylphenol (OP), in both cases pre-dominantly the para-
substituted isomers (>90%). APEOs are produced by a condensation reaction of APs with ethylene
oxide. While the lower condensates (number of ethoxylate units about 4) are used as emulsifiers, the
higher ethoxylates are used in textile and tapestry cleaning, and as emulsifiers in solvents and
agricultural pesticides10. As with the APs nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPEO) is more used than
octylphenol ethoxylate (OPEO). APs are moderately soluble in water while the APEOs are generally
more water soluble than the parent APs themselves. The chemical structure of n-nonylphenol and
octylphenol-mono-ethoxylate (better known as Triton X-100) are presented below.

4-NP has been found in PVC polymers where it is used as a stabilizer, in concentrations ranging from
1.4 to 1028 mg/kg7. We are not aware of data about the concentrations of APEOs in plastics.

4.2.2  Results for alkylphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates in this study

In total 11 consumer products were analysed for APs and APEOs. These included children pyjamas,
typical cleaning products and a baby toy. With the exception of sample 52003227-027, AP or APEO,
or both were quantified in all other samples. In most cases the compounds found were NP, with
concentrations ranging from 1.8 to 2,306 mg/kg, and NPEO with concentrations ranging from 2 to
1,930 mg/kg. OPEO was found in one sample (52003227-016) only with a concentration of 99 mg/kg.
OP was not found in any of the samples. In part this may have been caused by the presence of an
interfering compound, probably 2,4-di-(t-butyl) phenol, in a number of samples resulting in a higher
quantification limit. A similar problem occurred with the determination of APEO in sample 52003227-
013. This sample contains very high amounts of phthalates that seem to interfere with the
quantification of APEO, again resulting in a higher quantification limit.

The complete results for AP and APEO are presented in table 4 in the appendix.

4.3

Phthalates

4.3.1  General information

Phthalates are commonly found in cosmetic and personal care products, especially in nail polish,
perfumes, hair sprays, household cleaners and deodorizers, as well as in soft plastics, baby toys, plastic
garden furniture, shower curtains and so on. In the latter products phthalates are used as plasticizers to
increase the flexibility of high molecular weight polymers. In some soft plastics phthalates may
comprise up to 50% of the total weight. While until recently DEHP was the major phthalate used for
this purpose, it now seems to be replaced by DINP.

In perfumes phthalates are used as a carrier.  The most important phthalate for this application is DEP.
The Swedish Society for Nature Conservation performed an investigation about how common
phthalates are in common cosmetic products11. Most products contained phthalates and in most cases
DEP with concentrations ranging from less than 10 to 500 mg/kg for typical body care products and
up to 19,000 mg/kg for perfumes. DBP was found also but to a much lesser extent.

Due to the presence of phthalates in common household products, cosmetics and toys, the potential for
human exposure is very high. The EU has proposed a restriction for phthalates in articles for children
in the age of 0-3 years, however, only temporary and for only 6 phthalates (DBP, BBP, DEHP, DOP,
DINP and DIDP)12. Scientists at the US Center for Disease Control have documented human exposure
to phthalates by determinations of the monoester metabolites in human urine13.

The chemical structure of DEHP and DEP is presented below.

4.3.2  Results for phthalates in this study

In total 29 products were analysed for phthalates. These include body care products, perfumes, toys,
textiles with prints and deodorizers. In four of these products no phthalates were quantified. In 12
products only small amounts of phthalates were found, with concentrations of the individual phthalates
below 10 mg/kg. This indicates that these phthalates are probably not true additions, but more likely
residues resulting from the raw production materials or otherwise. In the remaining 13 products higher
concentrations of phthalates were found. This group can roughly be split into two groups; body care
products, perfumes and deodorizers on one side, and toys and textiles with prints on the other side.

In the body care products and deodorizers mainly DEP was found in concentrations ranging from less
than 10 mg/kg up to 168 mg/kg. Only small amounts of other phthalates, DEHP, with a maximum of
19 mg/kg were found in these products. As expected, high concentrations of DEP, ranging from 325 to
22,300 mg/kg, were found in the three perfume samples (52003227-006, -007 and -008).

In the toys, modelling clay and bath ducks (52003227-012 and -013) high concentrations of phthalates
were quantified. The modelling clay mainly contained BBP and DINP in concentrations of
respectively 32,300 mg/kg and 18,500 mg/kg. DCHP, DEHP and DOP were also found in this sample
in concentrations up to 4,000 mg/kg. In the bath ducks (52003227-013) at first only DINP and DIDP
were quantified in concentrations up to 7,300 and 6,200 mg/kg respectively. However, this seems
rather low for this soft type of PVC material. The GC/MS screening revealed that another softener, di-
iso-octyl adipate, was present in this sample. Although the amount was not quantified, the
concentration was estimated by comparison with DINP and DIDP in this sample, and is expected to be
at least 200,000 mg/kg, e.g. 20% by weight.

In three of the five pyjama samples (52003227-014, -017 and -018) high concentrations of phthalates
were quantified. All three were found to contain DINP in concentrations ranging from 27,500 mg/kg
to 54,000 mg/kg. Two of the three samples also contained DIDP, in both cases about 10% of the DINP
concentration, indicating that the DIDP is probably an impurity of the DINP. Finally, one of those two
samples also contained BBP, DCHP and DEHP in amounts up to 3,400 mg/kg. In all cases it may be
expected that these phthalates originate from the prints on the front of the pyjamas, and not from the
fabric itself. Since these samples were sub-sampled proportionally, and the print is about 10% of the
total surface of the top of the pyjama, the actual phthalate concentrations in the print material will be
much higher than the results presented here.

The chromatogram beneath is that of the extract of sample 52003227-012 showing the different
phthalates identified in this sample. The complete results of the phthalate analysis are presented in
table 5 (two pages) in the appendix.

4.4  Musks

4.4.1  General information

Originally, musk is a male sexual scent signal and is since ancient times aspired to humans who have
used it for medicines and as a fixative in perfumes. However, the increasing demand resulted in the
production of artificial musk fragrances. The most well known artificial musks are musk xylene (MX),
musk ketone (MK), and the polycyclic musks tonalide (AHTN) and galaxolide (HHCB). Due to their
toxicity and persistence, nitro musks are no longer produced in Europe and replaced by the synthetic
polycyclic musks 14. The structures of MK and AHTN are presented below.

TNO-MEP-report: Determination of hazardous chemicals in consumer products, concept 090903.

15 of 28

Musks are used as additives for perfumes, in detergents and soaps, in body lotions and deodorizers.
Only limited information was found in the literature about the concentrations of musks in these types
of products. In a study by the Dutch Keuringsdienst van Waren 114 cosmetic products were tested for
nitro-musks15. MK was the most prominent musk and found in about 50% of the samples, with
concentrations ranging from 1 to 24,000 mg/kg, the latter found in perfume.

4.4.2  Results for musks in this study

In this study MK, 4,600 mg/kg, was found in only one sample (52003227-008, Chanel No. 5) together
with a small amount of MX, and some HHCB. Higher amounts of HHCB were found in both other
perfume samples; Poison from Christian Dior and Eternity from Calvin Klein contained respectively
6,200 mg/kg and 8,000 mg/kg HHCB. The same polycyclic musk was also found in two shampoo’s
both from L’Oreal in concentrations of 350 mg/kg and 540 mg/kg. All the products containing higher
amounts of HHCB also contained low amounts of AHTN, roughly 0.5% to 10% of the HHCB content.
AHTN was found in a high concentration of 9,100 mg/kg in only one sample, Ambi Pur perfume
d’interieur Sky (52003227-032). The other nitro-musks MA and MT were not found in any of the
samples analysed for musks.

The chromatogram beneath is that of the extract of Chanel No.5 (52003227-008) with the musks
indicated. The results of the musk analysis are presented in table 6 in the appendix.

4.5  Organotin compounds

4.5.1  General information

There are three major applications for organotin compounds. First, the use of TBT in anti-fouling
paints for ships, secondly, the use of TPT as a pesticide, and third, the use of butyl- and octyltin
compounds as stabilisers in polymers. Therefore, many textile products containing polymer parts, like
T-shirts with prints, sanitary bandages, plasters and diapers, can contain organotin compounds16. In
some occasions organotin compounds are used as fungicides on textiles that are exposed to extreme
whether conditions, such as canvas. The structures of TBT and TPT are presented below.

TNO has a lot experience with the analyses of these materials. Until few years ago mainly TBT and its
degradation products DBT and MBT were found. Nowadays, it is more often DOT and MOT that are
found, always in the polymer parts (foam, plastic or adhesives) used in these of products.
Concentrations ranging from 0.01 mg/kg up to more than 2 mg/kg for textile products, and up to more
than 50 mg/kg for polymer parts of products, have been found.

4.5.2  Results for organotin compounds in this study

In this study nine samples, a shampoo, three toys or related products, and five pyjamas are analysed
for seven individual organotin compounds. Organotin compounds, DOT, MOT and a trace of TBT
(below the quantification limit) where found in one pyjama sample (52003227-016) in concentrations
up to 1.4 mg/kg product. The chromatogram of this sample is shown directly underneath. As with the
phthalates it should be remembered that the sub-sampling was done proportionally, meaning that the
organotin concentrations in the polymer print on the pyjamas will even be higher. Traces of MOT,
DBT and MBT were further found in sample 52003227-015 while sample 52003227-017 showed
traces of TBT and DBT. All the traces mentioned are above the detection limit of the method, 0.002
mg/kg, but below the quantification limit of 0.01 mg/kg.

The chromatogram beneath is that of the extract of sample 52003227-016. The peaks of DOT and
MOT are indicated. The results of the organotin determinations are presented in table 7 in the
appendix.

4.6  GC/MS screening

In the GC/MS screenings some additional compounds were identified in a number of samples. For
some samples the chromatogram was very complex showing many peaks. This was especially the case
for the chromatograms of the perfume and the deodorizer samples (52003227-008, -030, -031 and -
032). Not surprisingly these products contain a many terpenes and terpenoids, and other fragrances
like phenylethyl alcohol and methyl dihydrojasmonate. In the perfume sample an additional phthalate
was identified, di-isooctyl phthalate , which was not on the target list. The same phthalate was found
in the modelling clay, together with three more phthalates that were not on the target list. Since the
pyjama sample (52003227-014) also contained di-isooctyl phthalate, and even in high concentrations,
it is advised to add this phthalate to the target list of phthalates so that it will be monitored in
additional product samples.

Terpenes were also found in Hamleys Magic Balloons (52003227-011), together with a low
concentration of even numbered n-alkanes.  The chromatogram of the extract of Tricky Putty
(52003227-009) shows a series of peaks that were identified as a homologue series of
polymethylsiloxanes and polymethylcyclosiloxanes. In the three cleaning products (52003227-027, -
028 and -029) typical industrial solvent like 2-butoxyethanol, ethoxyethoxyethanol and the
alkanes/cycloalkane mixture were found.

In the GC/MS screening of the bath ducks (52003227-013) an additional plasticizer was found in a
very high concentration. It was identified as di-isooctyl adipate, an ester of hexadioic acid. This
sample also contained toluene. A chromatogram of this sample is shown beneath with the identified
compounds indicated.

No chlorinated compounds or pesticides were found in any of the samples. A summary of the
additional compounds identified in the samples is presented in table 8 in the appendix.

4.7  Quality control measurements

4.7.1  Method validation parameters

All methods used were already used on earlier occasions and are validated in a limited way. The
linearity of the instrumental analysis is known but the linearity of the complete method is not a very
useful parameter since the concentrations in the products can be so far apart that extracts have to be
concentrated or diluted for the result to fall in the linear range of the instrumental analysis.

The repeatability for each of the methods is determined by replicate analyses of the same sample. For
homogenous samples, most liquids and suspensions, the repeatability is better than 15 % . For not
homogenous solid samples, like the pyjamas with prints, the repeatability is better than 25%.

The quantification limits are given in the result tables in the appendix and generally vary between 0.01
mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, depending on the type of analyses and expected result. In some cases the
quantification limits were raised to higher values due to interferences.

4.2.2  Recovery of extraction standard

To all samples extraction standards were added. The recovery of the extraction standards for
phthalates and musks was in all cases above 80%. For the organotin compounds, the alkylphenols,
alkylphenol ethoxylates and bisphenol-A, the recovery was above 70%. With the exception of the
organotin determination the results are not corrected for the recovery of this extraction standard.

It should be mentioned that the addition of an extraction standard to a solid product sample, finely cut
pieces of plastic for instance, does not say much about the quality of the extraction. Especially for the
phthalates the quality of the extraction was tested additionally by extracting the same sample
(52003227-013) three times. Analyses showed that 100% of the phthalates were found in the first
extract.

4.2.3  Blank samples

With each series blank samples were included. These blank consisted of a complete analysis in the
same series as the samples, however, without the addition of sample material. With the exception of

TNO-MEP-report: Determination of hazardous chemicals in consumer products, concept 090903.

19 of 28

phthalates no blank values were observed. For the phthalates blank values were observed for DEHP,
corresponding 1 to 5 mg/kg. Results were not corrected for this blanc value, but the quantification
limit for DEHP was raised to 10 mg/kg.

Conclusions

In this study 33 consumer products have been tested for the presence the hazardous chemicals. A
selected number of these 33 products were analysed for bisphenol-A, alkylphenols and ethoxylates,
phthalates, musks and organotin compounds. In addition a GC/MS screening was performed on a
selected number of samples.

•  Three samples, a polycarbonate baby bottle and two canned food samples were analysed for
BPA. BPA was found in the baby bottle in a concentration of 14 mg/kg but not in the canned
food samples.

•  APs and APEOs were analysed in 11 products, one plastic toy, five pyjamas, two paints and
three cleaning products. With the exception of the cleaning products NP or NPEO or both
were found in all products, NP in concentrations around 10 mg/kg with one high concentration
of 2306 mg/kg, NPEO in concentrations up to 1930 mg/kg. The highest concentrations were
found in the plastic toy and four of the five pyjamas. OP was not found while OPEO was
found in one sample with a concentration of 99 mg/kg.

•  29 out of 33 products were analysed for phthalates. Typically, high concentrations of DEP

were found in perfumes, while polymer materials contained mainly the phthalates DINP and
DIDP, seemingly replacing DEHP that was found in a much lesser extent in this study. High
concentrations of BBP and other phthalates were found in a sample of modelling clay. The
additional GC/MS screening revealed that the plastic baby toy, apart from the target
phthalates, contained high amounts of di-isooctyl adipate. Phthalates were generally not
found, or only in low concentrations, in the shampoos, skin lotions, deodorizers and cleaning
products tested in this study.

•  Seven shampoos, two skin lotions, three perfumes and four deodorizers were tested for musk
compounds. The artificial musk HHCB was the most prominent, mainly in perfumes and to a
lesser extent in one brand of shampoo. The other shampoos and skin lotions did not contain
any of the target musks. AHTN was found in low concentrations in the perfumes and in a high
concentration in one brand of deodorizer. Two nitro-musks, MK and to a much lesser extent
MX were found in one brand of perfume.

•  Organotin compounds were tested in one shampoo, five pyjamas two paint samples. DOT and
MOT were found in one of the pyjamas while traces of MBT, DBT and TBT where found in
two more pyjamas.

•  The additional GC/MS screenings on 14 samples mainly revealed compounds that can be

expected in these kinds of products. Generally, fragrances, plasticizers other than the target
phthalates, preservatives and solvents were identified. Di-isooctyl phthalate and di-isooctyl
adipate were identified in more than one of the samples containing polymer parts, sometimes
in high concentrations. Therefore, it should be considered to add these to the list of the target
phthalates.

Note: When reading the tables in this appendix please note that while results are always rounded to
the correct decimal number, they are not always rounded to the correct number of significant units.
Due to the uncertainty in the results (for instance the repeatability of the method), the number of
significant units is limited. This is especially true for when concentrations of several thousands of
mg/kg are reported. In general no more than two significant numbers apply, so that for DEP in sample
52003227-007 (table 5) the result of 22999 mg/kg should be read as 23000 mg/kg.
