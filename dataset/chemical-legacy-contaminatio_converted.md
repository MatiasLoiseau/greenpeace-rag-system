Chemical Legacy
Contamination
of the Child

We are guilty of many errors and faults,
but our worst crime is abandoning the
children, neglecting the foundation of
life. Many of the things we need can wait.
The child cannot. Right now is the time
his bones are being formed, his blood is
being made and his senses are being
developed. To him we cannot answer
‘Tomorrow’. His name is ‘Today’.

1945 Nobel Prize Winner for Literature

Preface

In writing Chemical Legacy: Contamination
of the Child, Dr Dorey has perf o rmed a
considerable service. Childre n ’s health is
clearly an emotive topic, but this is a schol-
arly re p o rt of the current state of knowledge
about the contamination of the human
species by a restricted list of chemical pollu-
tants. The data come from re p u t a b l e
published sources, primarily peer- re v i e w e d
j o u rnals and government publications. The
i n t e r p retation of the findings is guarded and
dispassionate. This publication will serve as
a useful literature re v i e w.

To set the re p o rt in context, I welcome the
o p p o rtunity to discuss some aspects of envi-
ronmental pollution and child health.

E v o l u t i o n

T h roughout evolution, organisms have,
by chance mutations, produced a succession
of novel compounds that have impro v e d
their own survival prospects at the expense
of other species. An excellent example is
penicillin, produced by yeasts to inhibit
bacteria. Thus the ‘chemical warf a re’
concept in nature throughout evolution is
not a new one. However, when such changes
o c c u r, they do so on a very local basis and in
low volume. Furt h e rm o re, the target species
either adapts or succumbs to the new thre a t .
The adaptation is usually realised by a
p ro g ressively increasing ability of the targ e t
species to metabolise and detoxify the novel
compound. In higher cre a t u res, such as
mammals, this process might be expected to
occur over hundreds of generations.

During the past few decades, the human
race, through its industries, has managed
to disperse high volumes of many novel
chemical pollutants throughout the
b i o s p h e re at concentrations high enough
to cause adverse biological effects.

It should come as no surprise to discover

that some manufactured chemical
compounds, many of which are surprisingly
similar in stru c t u re to natural horm o n e s ,
i n t e rf e re with the chemical signalling systems
within our own bodies. The control of devel-
opment in the foetus and infant is very much
under the control of hormones which are
active in low levels of parts per trillion. This
is within the range of environmental concen-
trations found for many enviro n m e n t a l
pollutants within the general population.

To x i c o l o g y

The mixture of chemicals that is found in
the average person is extremely complex,
in the toxicological sense. There are hundre d s
of groups of chemicals to be found within
most people in the general population.
F u rt h e rm o re, within each group of org a n i c
chemicals there are usually many variants. For
example, consider the pesticide toxaphene:
t h e re are over 60,000 congeners and enan-
tiomers (mirror image molecules) possible
f rom that single chemical group (Liem &
Theelen, 1997; Vetter & Luckas, 1995; Ve t t e r
& Schere r, 1998). Then, in addition, there are
metabolites to add to the complexity.

The realistic bottom line is that we are being
exposed to tens of thousands of chemicals
which simply didn’t exist on this planet until
a few decades ago. When our grandpare n t s
w e re in their mothers’ wombs they would not
have been exposed to these novel chemicals.

We have no tools for analysing the toxicity
of the complex mixture to which we are
exposed (Howard, 1997; Lang, 1995). Most
toxicology is perf o rmed on chemicals one at
a time. We have difficulty comparing chemi-
cals even in combinations of pairs (Axelrad
et al., 2002 and 2003). When we consider
combinations of hundreds or thousands of
chemicals, it is clear that we have not yet
developed any methods that will allow for
their rigorous toxicological analysis.

T h e re is no indication of any imminent
major bre a k t h rough to this testing pro b l e m .
That leaves us with only a generalised
a p p roach to safety through hazard re d u c-
tion, i.e. reduction in exposure, using a
p re c a u t i o n a ry approach. There are simply
no other rational options available.

E p i d e m i o l o g y

To perf o rm a satisfactory epidemiological
study you need to know where you start e d
f rom, i.e. the baseline condition. This allows
for comparison with the exposed group.
You also need to know about exposure –
who is exposed to what – then you can
m e a s u re exposure against outcome. As
Dr Dore y ’s re p o rt makes clear, there is
p recious little exposure data for most of
the groups of chemicals of concern .
F u rt h e rm o re, there are no unexposed
g roups to act as ‘controls’.  Under such
c i rcumstances, epidemiology can only be
re g a rded as an extremely blunt tool.

The frequency of a condition in the population
is also a factor to be considered. If thalidomide
had not caused phocomelia (limb shortening, a
relatively obvious and rare condition), but had
instead caused cleft palate (a re l a t i v e l y
common condition), the likelihood is that we
still would not know of the side effects of this
d rug. If the chemical pollutant mixture to
which we are now exposed is causing changes
in the frequency of relatively common condi-
tions such as allergy and cancer, then epidemi-
ology is likely to be of little help, given the
data gaps outlined above. Once again, we are
faced with the single option of hazard re d u c-
tion as a means of re g u l a t i o n .

C o n c l u s i o n s

This re p o rt strengthens the evidence base
relating human exposure to enviro n m e n t a l
chemical pollutants, particularly to those
members of the population most at risk,
namely children. We have no toxicological
tools with which to analyse the level of
complexity of the mixture to which we are
exposed. We have no realistic prospect of
being able to use epidemiology to help analyse
the effects of multiple components of the
m i x t u re. However, we do know that many of

the chemicals in this mixture are indeed toxic.

In re a l i t y, the only effective remedy available
to us is to reduce the exposure of the general
population, on a pre c a u t i o n a ry basis, by
removing from production those groups of
chemicals which have been shown to poten-
tially pose a hazard .

Executive Summary

In early 2003, Greenpeace exposed the
presence of persistent, bioaccumulative
chemical pollutants in samples of house dust
taken from homes across the UK. Research
published by Greenpeace in October 2003
reveals that these same chemicals can be
found in many consumer products readily
available on every high street.

• the presence of these substances in

children (and the human population at
large)

• the ways in which children are

particularly exposed to these substances
• how this increased exposure increases the
potential for detrimental health impacts
• the different illnesses and diseases that are

This re p o rt completes the loop of chemical
e x p o s u re by illustrating two disturbing devel-
opments. Firstly, that many of the same
chemicals used routinely in consumer
p roducts and present in house dust, are also
p resent in the human body, including in
p renatal and newborn children. Secondly, that
these chemicals are likely to be having a detri-
mental effect on the health of children and
the human population at large. Significantly,
the re p o rt also draws together the available
evidence that illustrates how and why
p renatal and newly born children are part i c u-
larly at risk from chemical pollutants.

The evidence presented here, from academ-
ics, governments and well-respected interna-
tional institutions such as the World Health
Organisation (WHO), is not easily dismissed,
contributing as it does to a growing bank of
international research that reinforces the
conclusion of this report – that current
chemical legislation is failing to protect
children from a harmful chemical assault that
begins from a child’s conception.

The study focuses on seven key chemicals:
alkylphenols (nonyl and octylphenol), bisphe-
nol A, brominated flame retardants, organ-
otins, phthalates, chlorinated paraffins and
artificial musks. The report uses available
research to demonstrate:

now being linked to this chemical
exposure

• the specific health impacts of the key

chemicals listed above.

Studies have shown that alkylphenols,
found in a range of products such as leather
and textile finishers and in some deterg e n t s ,
contaminate children before and after birt h .
Nonylphenol has been detected in umbilical
c o rds, confirming that this horm o n e -
d i s rupting substance is able to cross the
placenta. Pre l i m i n a ry studies show that
nonylphenol may disrupt the human
immune system by adversely eff e c t i n g
g roups of white blood cells.

Likewise, bisphenol A, which is used
commonly in electrical products and as
laminate coatings for the inside of food tins
and bottle tops has been shown to cross the
placenta and has been identified in a wide
variety of human blood and tissue samples,
including foetal tissue. Numerous studies
have demonstrated the ability of bisphenol A
to alter male reproductive organs and affect
behaviour in animals at doses only a little
above the amount that human infants have
been shown to ingest the chemical.

One group of brominated flame retardants
(BFRs) has now been banned in Europe, but
others are still in use and many older

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

7

products contain the restricted substances.
BFRs have been found in human blood, liver
and adipose tissue, and in breast milk.
Studies have shown that where BFRs are
found at high levels in foetal blood, levels
tend to be high in the mother’s milk and
blood. This indicates that maternal levels of
BFRs are useful in predicting potential foetal
exposure. Some BFRs have been proven to
disrupt the genetic processes in cells, which
in turn is known to provoke a number of
diseases, including cancer.

Research has led to similar findings for
organotin compounds, chlorinated paraffins
and artificial musk compounds. That
research is also described in this report.

Research is now beginning to illustrate that
the exposure of prenatal and newborn
children to these chemicals is likely to be
more significant than the exposure of adults
in the same environment. Recent studies have
uncovered differences between children and
adults in their patterns of absorption, metab-

olism and excretion of environmental chemi-
cals. Children may absorb chemicals more
efficiently, process them more slowly and
eliminate them less efficiently than adults.

The final part of this report focuses on the
kinds of non-infectious disease, such as
cancer, allergies, nervous system disorders,
and developmental and reproductive disor-
ders, that are on the rise around the world. A
growing body of evidence is pointing to envi-
ronmental factors as contributors to these
problems. Many of the chemicals that have
been found in the human body have been
shown to be harmful to human and animal
health, and we now know that it is children
that are particularly at risk. Many of these
illnesses can stem from childhood, and many
are suspected of being caused by damage to
the developing child. This report uses the
available research to illustrate the ways in
which chemicals are able to damage the
immune and nervous systems, interfere with
hormonal activity, promote cancer and lead
to other detrimental health effects.

1 INTRODUCTION

Every year around 100,000 different types of
chemicals are produced for a wide range of
uses around the world (EEA, 1999). Many of
these chemicals find their way into our envi-
ronment. Other chemicals that have been
banned still leak from old products and
linger in the environment, and new chemicals
are synthesised every year.

Recent governmental and independent
reports on the effects of chemicals on the
environment and human health still focus
predominantly on pollutants about which we
already have a significant knowledge, while
largely ignoring many other chemicals about
which we know little. For example, the
recent US Environmental Protection
Authority report (US EPA, 2003b) on envi-
ronmental pollutants and their effects on
children, focused on air contaminants such as
ozone and sulphur dioxide; the heavy metals
lead and mercury; tobacco smoke; and pesti-
cides. This report neglected a vast range of
other chemicals which are known to contam-
inate humans, and about which evidence of
harm is building.

The Environmental Working Group (EWG),
an independent group in the USA, found 167
chemicals in the blood and urine of nine
adult Americans (Houlihan et al., 2003).
None of these volunteers worked with chemi-
cals as part of their jobs, and yet each of
them contained an average of 91 of the 210
chemicals tested for. Another study released
around the same time by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
reviewed 116 chemicals in the blood and
urine of adults (CDC, 2003), overlapping the
EWG report by 49 chemicals. Both studies

tested for certain classes of chemicals such as
polychorinated bisphenols (PCBs), furans,
dioxins, organophosphate and organochlo-
rine pesticides and metabolites, heavy metals,
and phthalates. The EWG included a much
wider range of PCBs and pesticides, and
tested for and found dozens of other semi-
volatile and volatile organic compounds that
are found in common consumer products.
The CDC included more of the heavy metals,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, well
known phytoestrogens, organophosphate
pesticides, and other insecticides, herbicides
and fungicides.

Most of these chemicals are well-known
toxins and have been studied extensively.
Many are already banned or have restricted
use. Neither the CDC nor the EWG report
looked at levels of chemicals in children.
Aside from the phthalates, neither report
included a range of persistent organic pollu-
tants (POPs) found throughout a large range
of everyday household products: the
alkylphenols, bisphenol A, brominated flame
retardants, chlorinated paraffins, organotins,
phthalates, and artificial musks.

These chemicals contaminate our air, water,
soil and food. They persist in the environ-
ment and accumulate in the tissues of a range
of animal life from marine snails to
mammals. There is considerable evidence
that these chemicals are toxic. Evidence is
mounting that tiny levels can effect human
health, but the level of contamination in
humans is largely unknown.

Limited data shows that these chemicals are
found in humans. They accumulate in our

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

9

bodies, not just from our day-to-day
exposure to various products containing
them, but from the time we are conceived
and developing in the womb. This is the time
when we are most sensitive to chemicals and
their toxic effects, and the time at which
damage can cause life-long health problems.

There is a wide range of health problems that
affect children, or have their origins in child-
hood, that have been increasing in the last
50 years. These include birth defects, cancer,
asthma, immune system disorders, develop-
mental and reproductive disorders, and

nervous system disorders. Many of the POPs
that contaminate our bodies have been linked
to these diseases.

The following sections review these POPs and
their potential health effects. Section 2 re v i e w s
the levels of contamination in humans,
focusing on contamination in children where
data exists. Section 3 reviews how these chem-
icals find their way into the body and why
c h i l d ren are more exposed. Section 4 re v i e w s
the health effects of this contamination,
focusing on child health. Section 5 provides a
s u m m a ry and conclusion.

CONTAMINANTS
IN CHILDREN

Accurately estimating the numbers and levels
of chemicals that humans are exposed to is
almost impossible. It is too difficult to
estimate contamination when it comes from
so many different sources. Levels of chemi-
cals in female blood can give us an idea of
which chemicals an unborn child may be
exposed to, but actual levels in the foetus can
vary significantly from the mother’s levels,
depending on how much is absorbed by the
placenta. Measures of contamination in the
umbilical cord at birth or amniotic fluid, if
amniocentesis is performed during pregnan-
cy, are the best indicators of child contamina-
tion. Other than levels in blood, levels of
chemicals in breast milk and infant food are
a good indication of neonatal exposure.

The following section reviews a series of
POPs with wide-ranging uses and explores
the increasing evidence of their contamina-
tion of the child.

2.1  A l k y l p h e n o l s
Alkylphenols are non-halogenated (halogens
include bromine and chlorine) chemicals
largely used to make surfactants (detergents),
as well as emulsifiers, dispersants and/or
wetting agents in industry and consumer
applications. Alkylphenols are predominantly
manufactured as alkylphenol ethoxylates
(APEs), however alkylphenols themselves can
be used as plasticisers in plastics, and their
derivatives, alkylphenol phosphites, can be
used as UV stabilisers in plastics. The most
widely used alkylphenols are nonylphenols,
followed by octylphenols.

products; and the spermicidal lubricant
nonoxynol-9. Outside Europe, APEs may
also be used in many domestic products,
such as liquid clothes detergents in the USA.

In Europe, most APEs have been replaced
with safer alcohol ethoxylates. However, in
Germany 1,000 tonnes/year of APEs are used
in domestic cleaning products despite a
voluntary ban on these applications (ENDS,
1999a).

2.1.1  Alkylphenols in the Child
There have been few studies on levels of
human contamination by alkylphenols, but
those that have been performed clearly show
that children are contaminated before and
after birth (Table 2.1).

Nonylphenol has been detected in human
umbilical cords (Takada et al., 1999),
confirming that it crosses the placenta from
the contaminated mother to the growing
foetus. The authors stressed the importance
of further studies using larger numbers of
umbilical cords, and analyses of maternal
and cord blood to estimate the fraction of
contaminants passing from the blood to the
foetus. Nonylphenol also contaminates breast
milk (Guenther et al., 2002).

APEs are found in industrial detergents, such
as for wool washing and metal finishing;
industrial processes such as emulsion poly-
merisation, leather and textile finishers; labo-
ratory detergents including Triton X-100;
some pesticides and other agricultural

2.2  Bisphenol A
Bisphenol A is a key building block of poly-
carbonate plastic and epoxy resins.
Polycarbonate plastic is lightweight, tough,
and clear with high heat and electrical resist-
ance, and is therefore used in a wide variety

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

11

of products including digital media (e.g. CDs,
DVDs), electrical and electronic equipment,
automobiles, sports safety equipment,
reusable food and drink containers, medical
equipment, and many other products.
Bisphenol A is also used as an additive in
other plastics. Epoxy resins are used in elec-
trical laminates for printed circuit boards,
composites, paints and adhesives, and a
variety of protective coatings. Cured epoxy
resins are used as protective liners in metal
cans to maintain the quality of canned foods
and beverages, in bottle tops, and in water
supply pipes. Some polymers used in dental
treatment also contain bisphenol A. In
Germany alone, approximately 210,000
tonnes of bisphenol A are produced per year
(Leisewitz & Swartz, 1998).

2 . 2 . 1 Bisphenol A in the Child
The subject of the effects of bisphenol A on
humans has been contentious. It has been
suggested that it is only partially absorbed,
has a high conversion rate to the biologically
inactive bisphenol A monoglucuronide, is
rapidly excreted, and shows no evidence of
bioaccumulation in tissues (Schonfelder et
al., 2002b). For these reasons, until recently,
many scientists believed that the active
parent form of bisphenol A would not be
found in human plasma, and therefore no
significant levels could reach the foetus.

However, studies from Germany and Japan
have now confirmed that children are
exposed to bisphenol A before birth. The
first, a Japanese study, found bisphenol A in
umbilical cords (Takada et al., 1999). Studies
on mice and monkeys then showed that this
chemical can cross the placenta (Uchida et
al., 2002). At least six studies have since
demonstrated bisphenol A in a wide variety
of blood and tissues from healthy adults, and
maternal and foetal tissues (Table 2.2).

Data from Ikezuki et al. (2002) suggest that
bisphenol A may concentrate in amniotic
fluid as it was found at approximately 5-fold
higher concentrations at 15–18 weeks gesta-
tion, compared with other fluids. Schonfelder

et al. (2002b) also showed that in 14 of 37
cases, foetal plasma levels of bisphenol A
were higher than in the corresponding
mother’s blood. Foetal levels of bisphenol A
were also significantly higher in males, which
may indicate sex differences in the metabo-
lism of this chemical. Takeuchi and Tsutsumi
(2002) confirmed this gender difference in a
study on adults, and suggested that it may be
due to androgen (male hormones) related
metabolism of bisphenol A.

2 . 3 B rominated Flame Retard a n t s
Brominated flame retardants are a diverse
group of compounds used to prevent
combustion and/or retard the spread of
flames in a variety of plastics, textiles and
other materials. They can be found in a large
range of industrial and electrical appliances,
vehicles, lighting and wiring, textiles includ-
ing carpets and furnishings, and in packaging
and insulating materials such as polystyrene.
Over 70 compounds or groups have been
described, but three dominate:

• polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)
• hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)
• brominated bisphenols (such as TBBP-A)

PBDEs and HBCD are mainly used as addi-
tives. TBBP-A is more commonly used as a
reactive component, becoming more tightly
bound to the polymers in which it is incorpo-
rated, but some additive uses still exist.
Polybrominated biphenols (PBBs) are no
longer produced in Europe but substantial
quantities remain in existing and imported
products and wastes.

One group of PBDEs, the penta-BDEs, are
being banned across Europe, however, they
may still appear in the environment follow-
ing degradation. For example, UV light and
sunlight can cause deca-BDE to debrominate,
resulting in the formation of lower-brominat-
ed diphenyl ethers such as penta-BDEs
(Darnerud et al., 2001). The World Health

Organisation has recommended that PDBEs
not be used where suitable replacements are
available, and Swedish and Danish
Governments have called for PDBEs to be
phased out. PBDEs were produced at a rate
of 40,000 metric tons per year world-wide in
1999 (Rahman et al., 2001).

2 . 3 . 1 B rominated Flame

R e t a rdants in the Child
The majority of the contamination data
is for PBB (now largely disused), and the
PBDEs. Levels of human contamination
by other brominated flame retardants is
largely unknown.

The similarity of PBDEs to dioxins and poly-
chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been of
major concern because their toxic effects may
be similar, there f o re these are the most studied
g roup of brominated flame re t a rdants. PDBEs
a re found in human breast milk, blood, liver
and adipose tissue (Table 2.3). Extensive
b reast milk studies in Sweden show an expo-
nential increase in PBDEs in breast milk (an
average increase from 0.07–4.02 ng/g lipid
between 1972–1997) while other chemical
contaminants such as PCBs have tended to
d e c rease (Meironyte et al., 1999). However,
a recent paper has re p o rted a decrease of
PBDEs in Swedish breast milk since 1997,
possibly due to a voluntary phase out of
penta-BDE (Hooper & She, 2003).

This rise in human contamination was also
seen in a study on human blood samples (10
male, 10 female) taken in 1985–1999 for the
German environmental specimen bank. The
median PBDE concentrations in blood have
increased from 3.1–4.7 ng/g lipid (Schroter-
Kermani, 2001). This study also showed that
males may be more at risk of contamination
than females as male blood samples showed
20–75% higher levels of PBDEs than female
blood, depending on the sampling year.

Babies born to mothers in the USA may be
most at risk of PBDE contamination. Mazdai

20–106 times higher than the levels reported

Organotins are organic compounds contain-
ing at least one bond between carbon and
metal tin and include:

There is a high correlation between levels of

cating that maternal PBDE blood levels are

• dibutyltins (DBT)
• tributyltins (TBT)

• triphenyltins (TPT)

in PVC and as catalysts in production of
polyurethane foams and silicones, and tri-
substituted organotins in a wide range of
agricultural and general biocides, but there
is some overlap in uses between the groups.
Organotins can therefore be found in:
antifoulants on boats, ships, quays, buoys,
crab-pots, fishing nets and cages; biocides
for cooling systems, power stations, pulp and
paper mills, breweries, leather processing and
textile mills; slimicides on masonry; wood
preservatives; anti-fungal agents in carpets
and PVC flooring; glass coating applications;
disinfectants; heat stabilisers in rigid (pipes,
panels) and soft (wall-coverings, furnishing,
toys) PVC products; paint and rubber; pesti-
cides targeting everything from insects, to
worms, to rats; and anti-bacterial shoe
insoles and nappies.

TBT has been banned for use on small
vessels in many countries for over 10 years
due to its impact on marine molluscs, and
is currently being phased out of larger vessels
worldwide (Champ, 2000). PVC uses about
two-thirds of the global consumption of the
organotins, which can make up to 2% of
the finished product. Approximately 15,000
tonnes of organotins were used in PVC in
Europe in 1995 (Santillo et al., 2003).

2 . 4 . 1 O rganotins in the Child
Although organotins, particularly TBT, have
been found in a wide range of molluscs, fish,
marine birds, marine mammals, and fre s h w a t e r
b i rds (IPCS, 1999), aside from a few re p o rt s
( Table 2.4), levels of contamination in humans
a re largely unknown, and there are no re a d i l y
available re p o rts on child contamination.

2 . 5 P h t h a l a t e s
Phthalates are among the most ubiquitous
synthetic chemicals in the environment.
They are non-halogenated ester derivatives
of phthalic acid. Some phthalates are used
as discrete products, such as di(ethylhexyl)
phthalate (DEHP), while others are complex

isomeric mixtures containing individual
compounds with similar structures such as
the di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP) and di-iso-
decylphthalates (DIDP).

The major use for phthalates are as plasticisers
in PVC products including building/furn i s h i n g
materials, floorings, furn i t u re, food packaging,
toys, clothing, car interiors, cables, and a
range of medical equipment such as blood
bags. They are also used in solvents, lubricat-
ing oils, fixatives, adhesives, paints, sealants,
s u rface coatings, insecticides, deterg e n t s ,
printing inks, car- c a re products, soaps,
shampoos, hand lotion, nail polish, cosmetics,
and perfumes. Six phthalates have been
banned from use in toys designed to be put
into the mouths of children under 3-years old.

Over 1 million tonnes of phthalates are
p roduced each year in Europe alone, primarily
for use in the EU (Santillo et al., 2003). The
main phthalates are DEHP, DINP, DIDP,
dimethylphthalate (DMP), diethylphthalate
(DEP), and dibutylphthalate (DBP). DEHP
constitutes about 50% of the market for PVC
plasticisers in We s t e rn Europe (EC, 2003).

2 . 5 . 1 Phthalates in the Child
Metabolites of phthalates in the urine
indicate a wide exposure of humans to
phthalates (Barr et al., 2003; CDC, 2003;
Koch et al., 2003). Phthalates have also been
detected in adult blood (see Table 2.5), but
child studies are scarce.

A study on pre m a t u re breast development
( t h e l a rche) in female children aged 6 months
to 8 years, found phthalate esters in 68% of
s e rum samples from the thelarche patients
( Table 2.6). The phthalate esters with the most
common commercial uses, DEHP and DBP,
w e re detected in the highest concentrations.
For those samples with high concentrations
of DEHP, one of the major DEHP metabolites,
mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP), was
also detected. DEHP was detected in only
14% of the control samples in lower

and three samples, re s p e c t i v e l y.

While there are few studies on the contamina-
tion of young children, other studies suggest
that their levels could be at least as high as
adult levels. A large study of urine phthalate
levels in 2,541 USA residents showed that
females tended to have higher concentrations
than males (CDC, 2003). Animal studies show
that phthalates cross the placenta and pass
into breast milk (Dostal et al., 1987; Parm a r
et al., 1985; Srivasta et al., 1989), there f o re ,
phthalates will be passed onto developing

mothers. Additionally, children seem to be
m o re exposed to phthalates than adults. In the
CDC study, of the seven urine phthalate
metabolites tested, the highest levels of
metabolites for DEHP, DBP and monoben-
zylphthalates were found in the youngest age-
g roup tested: the 6–11-year-old childre n

produce fragrances that are added to
personal care and household products such
as laundry detergents, shower gels, soaps,
hand lotions and perfumes. Some musks are
also used as additives in food, room
fragrances, chewing tobacco, fish baits,
Indian joss sticks, and in technical products
such as herbicide formulations and explo-
sives. The nitro musks include musk xylene,
musk ketone, musk ambrette, musk tibetene
and musk moskene. The major polycyclic
musks are tonalide and galaxolide, also
know as AHTN and HHCB respectively.

Musk ambrette has been banned and musk
xylene restricted due to health concerns.
They are largely being replaced with poly-
cyclic musks which may appear less problem-
atic but are, in fact, largely untested.

2 . 6 . 1 A rtificial Musks in the Child
Nitro musks have been found in human
adipose, breast tissue and blood (Table 2.7)
but no studies appear to have been done on
children. However, adult female blood and
breast milk levels indicate that contamination
of the foetus and newborn does occur.

2 . 7 Chlorinated Paraff i n s
Polychlorinated-n-alkanes or chlorinated
paraffins (CPs) are produced by reacting
chlorine gas with paraffins (hydrocarbons)
(Fig. 2.6). They are complex mixtures and
exist as oils or solids depending on their
content of chlorine and carbon. They are
divided in to six groups depending on carbon
chain length (short C10–13; intermediate
C14–17; long C18–30) and degree of chlori-
nation (low <50%; high >50%).

They are used as high-temperature lubri-
cants, plasticisers, flame retardants, industrial
cutting oils for metal working, finishing
agents for leather goods and textiles, and
additives in adhesives, paints, rubber and
sealants. Some short chain CPs are being
used as replacements for PCBs. They are
also used as secondary plasticisers for PVC
or as partial replacements for primary plasti-
cisers such as phthalates. In 1998, about
4000 tonnes of CPs were produced in the
EU (Santillo et al., 2003).

2 . 7 . 1 Chlorinated Paraffins in the Child
Data on the human contamination by CPs
is scarce. One report from 1985 on the
contamination of environmental samples by
CPs includes a sample of human fat (200
µg/kg fat) (Schmid & Muller, 1985).

The suite of chemicals to which children are
exposed is not measured or defined by any
p rogramme. Testing, labelling and monitor-
ing programmes capture only a fraction of
the chemicals we are exposed to. Childre n

chemicals that it is very difficult to estimate
which chemicals are important and at what
levels. In addition, due to the combined
e ffects of development, physiology, diet and
behaviour specific to their age gro u p ,
c h i l d ren may experience higher levels of
e x p o s u re to toxins than adults within the
same environment.

An increasing number of studies have uncov-
e red diff e rences between children and adults
in their patterns of absorption, metabolism
and excretion of environmental chemicals.
C h i l d ren may absorb chemicals more
e ff i c i e n t l y, process them more slowly and
eliminate them less efficiently than adults.
C h i l d ren may be more or less sensitive to
the particular effects of a chemical, and the
chemical may produce diff e rent adverse
e ffects. It is clear that studies of adults must
be used cautiously to predict potential
adverse effects in children.

This section looks at the ways in which
c h i l d ren are contaminated by chemicals,
and explores why they are more susceptible
to this contamination.

3 . 1 F rom Products to Childre n
About 100,000 diff e rent chemicals are
re g i s t e red for commercial use within
E u rope with hundreds of new chemicals
re g i s t e red each year (Goldman, 2002).
In 2001, major USA industries re p o rted the
release of 6.16 billion pounds of industrial
chemicals into air, water and landfill (US
E PA, 2003b), just a portion of what is
actually released. Chemicals can also leach
f rom their products, contaminating food,
homes and work places.

The majority of the chemicals described in
Section 2 are persistent; that is, they stay in
the environment for a long time. Those
chemicals that are described as having a rela-
tively short half-life are regularly released
into the environment in such large amounts
that they are constantly detectable. For
example, despite having a relatively short
half-life in the body (about 12 hours), phtha-
late metabolites in the urine of women in one
study remained fairly constant from day to
day, suggesting a constant daily exposure
(Hoppin et al., 2002).

Many of these chemicals are also bioaccumu-
lative; that is, they accumulate in the bodies of
o rganisms, some in the fat tissue and others in
specific sites such as liver and kidney. These
chemicals then build up in the food chain so
that those organisms at the top of food chains,
such as humans, have the highest exposure .
The developing child, who feeds directly fro m
the mother’s body or breast milk, sits at the
top of many food chains.

3 . 1 . 1 P renatal Exposure
By the third month of pre g n a n c y, the placenta
has sent extensive branches into the deep
layers of the uterus (Moore & Persaud, 2003).
These are intertwined with the spiral arteries of
the uterus which send jets of blood between
these branches. As the mother’s blood trickles
between the placental branches, carbon
dioxide and metabolic wastes are taken away
and replaced with oxygen, water, minerals,
nutrients and antibodies. This is a similar
p rocess by which the blood in our capillaries
a re cleaned and refuelled, with one major
d i ff e rence – the placenta actively pumps most
of what it needs (with the exception of oxygen)
f rom the mother rather than relying on passive
d i ffusion. There f o re, the foetus is guaranteed a
constant supply of re q u i red substances, even if
the mother’s blood levels are unusually low or
high in a particular component. In this way,
the placental barrier can decide, to some
extent, what enters the developing child.

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

19

When it comes to toxic chemicals that have
contaminated the mother, however, the
placenta is not really a barr i e r. Chemical
substances from the mother’s blood are sort e d
primarily on the basis of molecular weight,
electrical charge and lipid solubility. Small,
neutrally charged molecules that re a d i l y
dissolve in fat are given free passage thro u g h
the placenta, re g a rdless of their potential for
h a rm. Methylmerc u ry, for example, is actively
pumped from the mother’s blood so that the
m e rc u ry levels in the umbilical cord will even-
tually surpass the levels in the mother’s blood.

The foetus, suspended by the umbilical cord ,
floats freely in amniotic fluid which
s u rrounds, protects, and bathes the developing
foetus (Moore & Persaud, 2003). This fluid,
made by tissues from both the foetus and
m o t h e r, is constantly sipped and swallowed by
the foetus, and is absorbed by the digestive
tract. It soaks through the skin, and is inhaled
as the baby practices breathing. It is absorbed
by the foetus, enters the foetal circulation, and
leaves via the maternal circulation. It bathes
the inside and outside of the developing baby,
as do any chemicals which contaminate it.

As well as being exposed to the chemicals
which the mother is exposed to daily, the
developing foetus is exposed to chemicals
that have been stored in her tissues, and are
released during pregnancy. For example,
there is a dramatic mobilisation of maternal

fat stores during the third trimester, a period
critical to brain development (Moore &
Persaud, 2003).

Bisphenol A is a good example of the
p roblem. In many cases, foetal plasma levels
of bisphenol A are higher than for matern a l
blood (Schonfelder et al., 2002b). Bisphenol A
concentrations in amniotic fluid at 15–18
weeks gestation were five times higher than in
other fluid in one study (Ikezuki et al., 2002).
The rate of clearance of bisphenol A from the
blood is slower in foetuses because the
enzymes re q u i red to clear it are not expre s s e d
until after birth. Women also have higher
concentrations in their blood than men, due to
d i ff e rences in either exposure or metabolism
between the sexes (Schonfelder et al., 2002).

3 . 1 . 2 Postnatal Exposure
Food

The major source of exposure to bioaccumu-
lative chemicals is food (for example, see
Table 3.1). Food is first contaminated via
e n v i ronmental pollution during growth and
bioaccumulation along the food chain. This
contamination continues due to leaching fro m
components and packaging used during
manufacturing, processing and storage, part i c-
ularly for food containing higher levels of fat.

Fish tends to be the most highly contaminat-
ed of all food. For example, the flame retar-
dant PBDEs have been detected in fish and

shellfish in the range of 21–1650 pg/g fresh
weight (Ohta et al., 2002). In comparison,
beef, pork, and chicken contained 6.25–63.6
pg/g, and three different vegetables had levels
of 38.4–134 pg/g. Similarly, in Japan where
fish is a major part of the diet, the estimated
daily intake of the organotin TBT is relative-
ly high (2.5 µg/kg body weight based on a
fish consumption of 150 g/day) (van Heijst,
1994). Ohta et al. (2002) also showed a
strong correlation between PBDE levels in
breast milk and intake of fish and shellfish.

P reparation and storage of food can incre a s e
contamination dramatically. Bisphenol A,
which leaches from unreacted materials and/or
degraded polymers from plastics, is a good
example. Bisphenol A levels migrating fro m
plastic products into baby food increase after
dishwashing, boiling, and brushing (Bre d e ,
2003); it migrates from rubber products and
plastic stretch-film used in food-contact
( L o p e z - C e rvantes & Paseiro-Losada, 2003;
Ozaki & Baba, 2003); and an estimated
80–85% of food cans contain bisphenol A.

In the case of the organotins, TBT, DBT, and
MBT can leach from baking parchment,
while DBT and MBT leach from gloves for
kitchen work, dish-washing sponges, and
cellophane film for food (Takahashi et al.,
1999). Similarly, in another study, the
process of frying and packaging chicken
increased the phthalate DEHP content from
0.08–16.9 mg/kg. The main source of
contamination was PVC gloves used by food
workers (Tsumura et al., 2001b). PVC tubing
has also been a source of high-level contami-
nation of baby food (Tsumura et al., 2001a)

As an example of the extent of chemical
contamination of food, a recent re p o rt found
nonylphenol in all 60 food-products tested
(Guenther et al., 2002). These were all
p o p u l a r, common foods in Germany and
included 39 adult foods, from marmalade to
sausages, 20 baby foods, and one sample of
b reast milk (see Table 3.2 for a selection of

the results). Nonylphenol was detected in
e v e ry sample within the range of
0.1–19.4 µg/kg, and was not related to fat
content. The authors pointed out that the
foods varied substantially in pre p a r a t i o n
methods and packaging and that there are
multiple entry points for nonylphenol into the
food supply.

and general foods that may be fed to infants.

Air

The second highest source of chemical
contamination is air (Table 3.1). Indoor expo-
s u res to chemicals, including alkylphenols,
bisphenol A and phthalates, in pre s c h o o l
c h i l d ren have been shown to
be greater indoors than out (Wilson et al.,
2003). Chemicals build up from cleaning
compounds, personal care products and
cosmetics. Vapours and degraded materials
leach from carpeting, paints, computers, furn i-
t u re and toys, and adhere to aerosol part i c l e s .

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

21

For example, DINP and DEHP are the
p redominant phthalates that migrate fro m
c h i l d re n ’s toys and childcare articles (Bouma
& Schakel, 2002). Various studies have found
a wide range of chemicals in the dust of many
houses, including alkylphenols, bisphenol A,
o rganotins, flame re t a rdants, phthalates, and
chlorinate paraffins (Santillo et al., 2003).

Outside air contains lower levels of these
chemicals, some of which may come fro m
vaporisation from contaminated water and
may show seasonal trends (Ying et al., 2002).
For example, air in urban New York and New
Jersey in the USA, contained nonylphenol at
levels of 2.0–70 ng/m3 due to vaporisation
f rom the Hudson River (Dachs et al., 1999).

Water

Water is contaminated with chemicals via
sewage, industry waste-water, and leaching
f rom land-fill. APEs in treated waste-water
e ffluents, for example, are similar in Spain, the
UK and the USA with concentrations up to
369 mg/L while in sediment they reach up to
13,700 mg/kg in the USA (Ying et al. 2002).

Research by the UK Government's Drinking
Water Inspectorate has shown that various
products for drinking water pipes (plastic
resins, rubbers, cements and pipe-linings)
leach alkylphenols and phthalates into the
drinking water (ENDS, 1999b). One epoxy
resin coating leached two phthalates, DBP
and DBEP, at levels of 1,400 µg/m2 and 280
µg/m2 respectively, and the alkylphenol,
nonylphenol at levels of 160 µg/m2 into
water for the first hour after curing. A
solvent-based cement coating leached 12,000
µg/m2/h of nonylphenol polyethoxylate
immediately after curing, and leaching rates
remained high after three days.

Medical Sources

Many medical devices contain plastics,
including blood bags, mechanical ventilators,
haemodialysis machines, feeding equipment,
and infusion lines. Therefore, medical inter-
ventions can increase exposure to chemicals
used in plastics. Neonates, particularly
premature neonates receiving multiple inter-
ventions in intensive care units, are exposed
to high levels of plastic additives. A particu-
lar problem is DEHP, the only phthalate
currently used in medical devices, which
contain on average 20–40% DEHP by
weight (EC, 2002). Bisphenol A can also
be a problem as, for example, haemodialysis
patients have additional exposure to the
chemical through polycarbonate components
in dialysis machines (Yamasaki et al., 2001).

3 . 2 I n c reased Exposure in Childre n

3 . 2 . 1 D i e t
Young children eat 3–4 times more food in
p ro p o rtion to their body size than adults
( Table 3.3), and there f o re ingest more chemi-
cals per unit of body mass. They also eat a
m o re limited range of food – human milk or
cow milk-based products are the pre d o m i n a n t
s o u rce of energy and nutrients in the first year
of life. Children are there f o re exposed to a
higher pro p o rtion of lipid-soluble chemicals
that are released into milk from the fat store s
of both human mothers and cows.

Children also drink more water relative to
their body mass. Infants below 6 months old
consume 88 mL/kg/day of tap water, directly
and via sources such as fruit juice and
formula, and infants aged 6–12 months
ingest 56 mL/kg/day. In contrast, adults over
20 years ingest only 15 mL/kg/day (Altshuler
et al., 2003c).

Contamination can even come from water
filters. For example, following purification of
tap water for laboratory use, bisphenol A
levels increased from 0.01–0.02 ng/mL
(Inoue et al., 2000).

3 . 2 . 2 B e h a v i o u r
Ingestion of toxins from non-dietary sources
is relatively high in young children because
they constantly place objects and fingers in

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

their mouths, particularly those going
through the period characterised by intense
oral exploratory behaviour. Soil may be
ingested inadvertently or by deliberate or
compulsive behaviour, and this may be
greater in retarded children (Altshuler et al.,
2003). Children also tend to paddle or swim
more often, and are thus exposed to more
water-borne chemicals.

3 . 2 . 3 S t a t u re
During infancy and toddler years, children
spend a large amount of time on or near the
floor or ground. Here they are more exposed
to dense vapours, car exhausts, house dust
and chemicals leaching from floor coverings.

3 . 2 . 4 Enhanced Absorption
Dermal Absorption

Children have a higher skin surface area to
body weight ratio than adults, and experi-
ence more intensive contact with home
surroundings, so increased dermal absorption
of chemicals may occur. The skin of children
is also more permeable than adult skin. In
newborns, keratinisation (thickening and
toughening of the skin) does not occur until
3–5 days after birth, and is more delayed in
premature infants (Bearer, 1995). Studies
have shown enhanced absorption of toxins
including various dyes, drugs and disinfec-
tants through the skin of newborns
(Eichenfield & Hardaway, 1999).

Gastrointestinal Absorption

Gastrointestinal (GI) absorption is increased
in children under 6–8months old, and the
immature GI tract shows prolonged gastric
emptying time and a prolonged intestinal
tract transit time. This means that children
will be more exposed to ingested chemicals.
For example, children absorb 50% of
ingested lead compared to 10% by adults.
Newborns do not achieve adult levels of
stomach acidity until several months of age
which may increase or decrease the absorp-
tion of different chemicals (Bearer, 1995).

Respiratory Absorption

Young children breathe about twice as much
air in proportion to their body mass as adults
and therefore inhale proportionately more
airborne chemicals (Altshuler et al., 2003c).

Brain Absorption

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) limits the
ability of most chemicals to penetrate the
brain from the general circulation. Lipid-
soluble compounds can cross more easily as
the lipid content of the brain is high.
However, the effectiveness of the BBB is age-
dependant – the BBB develops gradually
during foetal growth and infancy, and
matures during childhood (Altshuler et al.,
2003c). This higher permeability to chemi-
cals may result in higher exposures of the
brain to toxins.

3 . 2 . 5 Distribution in the Body
Blood and body composition and organ size
in infants and children differ from adults.
This affects the distribution and storage of
chemicals, and thus the exposure of org a n s
and tissues to their toxic effects. In the blood,
for example, chemicals may be bound to
special blood proteins that prevent them fro m
accessing target sites in organs. Bound chemi-
cals are less likely to cause adverse effects in
the body. However, serum albumin, the
p redominant binding protein in blood, only
reaches adult levels by the age of 10–12
months (Altshuler et al., 2003c). Thus, infants

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

23

a re more vulnerable to toxins as they lack this
p rotection. Infants also have a higher perc e n t-
age of water and a greater volume of extracel-
lular fluid than adults – 75% of body weight
at birth compared to 50–60% in an adult –
and there f o re can carry pro p o rtionately more
chemicals in their body fluids.

In older children and adults, fat can act as a
b u ffer to lipid-soluble toxins, by storing them
and releasing them slowly over a period of time.
The developing foetus lacks this buffer as it has
little body fat until the last four weeks of gesta-
tion (Moore & Persaud, 2003). Fat-soluble
chemicals are, there f o re, more likely to be
s t o red in foetal tissues with a higher fat content,
such as the highly sensitive, developing brain.

Some organs in the child are larger than
those of an adult in relation to their body
mass, and blood flow to their organs may
also be greater in proportion to body mass.
For example, the infant brain makes up 13%
of total body mass, while an adult brain is
only 2%, and cerebral flow is greater per
unit mass of brain weight than for an adult
(Altshuler et al., 2003c).

All these factors may result in a greater distri-
bution and storage of certain chemicals in the
o rgans of children. An increase in storage can
then extend the duration of exposure to chem-
icals, as they are slowly re - released over time.

3 . 2 . 6 M e t a b o l i s m
Children have a large skin surface in propor-
tion to their body mass and therefore lose
body heat more rapidly. This requires a
higher resting metabolic rate than adults and
more oxygen relative to their body mass.
They also tend to be more active than adults,
further increasing their respiration rate and
energy metabolism. Therefore, both their
food and air intake is higher and their
exposure to polluting chemicals is greater per
unit of body mass than for adults.

3 . 2 . 7 B i o t r a n s f o rmation of Chemicals

Biotransformation of a chemical into its
metabolite(s) may either increase or decrease
its toxicity, and make it easier or harder to
eliminate it from the body. In infants and
children, many important biotransformation
pathways do not function at adult levels, and
some transformation processes follow differ-
ent pathways (Bearer, 1995; McCarthy,
2003). These differences can result in an
inability to metabolise a chemical, or the
production of different metabolites in the
developing foetus or child compared to
adults. Immaturity can be an advantage for
those chemicals where the metabolite is more
toxic than the parent chemical; however, in
general, reduced metabolic capacity of
infants and children probably predisposes
them to the risk of more severe adverse
effects than adults.

3 . 2 . 8 E x c retion and Elimination
Chemicals may be excreted as the parent
compound, metabolite, or linked to other
chemicals (conjugates) via urine, faeces or
expelled air. Some chemicals are transformed
to water-soluble products so that they can
be excreted by the kidneys via glomerular
filtration, tubular diffusion, or tubular secre-
tion. Glomerular filtration removes most
toxins unless they are tightly bound to
plasma proteins.

The liver and kidneys of newborns are not
fully developed at birth and so toxins are
eliminated more slowly than they are in
adults (McCarthy, 2003). The glomerular
filtration rate of a full-term newborn is about
50% that of an adult and reaches the full
capacity at about 12 months. Tubular secre-
tion and renal blood flow reach adult rates
by about 6–9 months and 5–12 months,
respectively (McCarthy, 2003).

Due to a combination of diff e rences in
b i o t r a n s f o rmation and immature org a n
function, it can take neonates 2–9 times
longer on average to eliminate a chemical
f rom their body, depending on the primary

4 CONTAMINATING

CHEMICALS AND DISEASE

A range of non-infectious diseases around the
world are on the rise. Environmental factors
are believed to contribute to all these
diseases, although specific factors or chemi-
cals may not have been identified. All these
diseases can stem from childhood, and many
are suspected to be caused by damage to the
developing child, the period of life most
susceptible to chemical damage.

Many of the hundreds of chemicals which
have been shown to contaminate our bodies
are toxic to a range of animals. The effects of
these chemicals on human health are largely
unexplored, partly because they are found in
doses in the environment that were once
considered unlikely to have an effect.
Research is now linking low-dose chemical
studies in animals to a broad range of health
effects that were previously unexplored in
high-dose studies. These health effects are all
related to diseases seen in humans.

This section reviews the diseases that are on
the rise, and describes the periods of child
development that are vulnerable to chemical
damage. The final part presents the current
evidence of the toxic effects of low doses of
persistent organic pollutants and their
possible links to disease.

4 . 1 Diseases on the Rise

4 . 1 . 1 Infant Mort a l i t y
The USA still has one of the highest infant
mortality rates and the highest rates of pre-
term and low birth-weight babies in the
industrialised world (Altshuler et al., 2003a).
Table 4.1 shows the ten leading causes of
death for newborns in the USA. About 55%
of these infant deaths are attributed to:

The risks of developing these disorders are
all increased by exposure to chemicals. While
deaths from most of these causes are declin-
ing, congenital abnormalities do not appear
to be declining.

4 . 1 . 2 Immune Diseases
The incidence of asthma, allergies and
autoimmune diseases are increasing
world-wide:

• 100–150 million people suffer from

asthma world-wide, and the annual death
rate has reached over 180,000 (WHO,
2002). In Western Europe, the incidence
of asthma has doubled in the last 10 years
(WHO, 2002). While most asthma is due
to allergy, there are many cases where an
allergic cause has not been established.
•  1 in 4 people in the UK (15 million) are

a ffected by an allergy at some time in their
lives. The incidence appears to be incre a s-
ing at a rate of about 5% a year with as
many as half of those now affected being
c h i l d ren (Allergy UK, 2003).

• 1 in 31 people in the USA (over 8.5

million) have autoimmune diseases, which
include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and
multiple sclerosis, with the incidence in
women occurring at 2.7 times the rate in
men (Jacobsen et al., 1997).

While there is no doubt that genetic predis-
position is an important determinant for
immune disease, environmental factors do
play a role in their development. Studies
show that certain chemicals cause changes in
the immune system – from changing immune
parameters such as antibody levels and white
blood cell numbers, which affects the body’s
ability to fight infections and cancer, to
inducing allergy and autoimmune diseases.

• congenital abnormalities
• complications of low birth
weight and prematurity

• Sudden infant death syndrome
• complications of labour and delivery.

A life-long capacity for immune response is
determined during prenatal and early postna-
tal development (EHP, 1996; Luster et al.,
2003). Impairment of the immune system can
result from alterations in the development

2Atelectasis is a collapse of lung tissue affecting part or all of one lung. Congenital atelectasis can result from a failure of the
lungs to expand at birth and may be localised or may affect all of both lungs.

of the immune system and may be long-
lasting. The effects may not be manifested
at birth and may not be expressed until
adulthood (EHP, 1996).

Chemicals can also worsen the symptoms
of immune diseases. For example, children
are particularly susceptible to developing
asthmatic symptoms and other respiratory
problems when exposed to air pollution
(Altshuler et al., 2003a).

4 . 1 . 3 C a n c e r s
Cancer is the cause of 26% of deaths in the
UK and the second leading cause of death
in the USA (Cancer Research UK, 2003b;
Anderson, 2001). It is estimated that one in
three people will develop cancer during their
lifetimes. About 1.2 million people in the UK
are currently diagnosed with cancer (Cancer
Research UK, 2003a).

Cancer is the third most common cause of

death among children between 1–19 years
(Anderson, 2001). The incidence of child-
hood cancer in the USA increased by 26%
between 1975–1999. The biggest rise was
estimated for brain and other nervous system
cancers (50% increase) and acute lympho-
cyctic leukaemia (62% increase). Only
5–10% of cancers have been linked to
genetic factors, the rest are influenced by a
broad range of environmental factors.

Most childhood cancers differ from adult
cancers and affect a wider range of cell types.
Some are linked with specific genetic or chro-
mosomal alterations that most likely occur at
conception or shortly after (Altshuler et al.,
2003a). Others appear to be related to the
defective development, or dysgenesis, of
organs or tissues (Sonnenschein & Soto,
1999). These tissues are considered to be in
a pre-malignant state as they have a high risk
of developing cancer. Some of these cancers,
such as the liver tumour hepatoblastoma

appear in earlier in childhood, while others,
such as testicular cancer in undescended
testes, may appear later. In contrast, adult
cancers mostly affect the epithelial cells
which line organs and stru c t u res, and are
thought to result from the slow accumula-
tion of genetic or structural damage due to
ageing or to exposure to enviro n m e n t a l
factors. Sensitivity to cancer-causing eff e c t s
of chemicals is much greater during the pre -
and postnatal period.

4 . 1 . 4 N e rvous System Disord e r s
T h e re appears to be an epidemic of
developmental, learning and behavioural
disabilities in children (Shettler et al.,
2000). About 17% of children in the
USA suffer from one of these disabilities.
The number of children being treated for
attention deficit disorder (ADD) and atten-
tion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
has increased dramatically in the last ten
years (Houlihan et al., 2003; Shettler et al.,
2000). The re p o rted incidence of autism is
also increasing (Houlihan et al., 2003).
The causes are not known but chemical
e x p o s u res are considered a potential
contributor (Wo o d w a rd, 2001).

N e u rodegenerative diseases such as
P a r k i n s o n ’s disease, may also be caused by
chemicals. For example, exposure to heavy
metals, pesticides, and tobacco smoke have
been linked to Parkinson’s disease (Sidero w f
& Stern, 2003; Wo o d w a rd, 2001).

4 . 1 . 5 Developmental and

R e p roductive Disord e r s

R e p roductive disorders, particularly in the
male are incre a s i n g :

•  S p e rm counts in many parts of the world
a re decreasing by about 1% per year in
industrialised countries. There are signif-
icant regional diff e rences in sperm
counts that cannot be explained by
genetic factors (Swan et al., 2000).
•  Incidence of hypospadias, a birth defect

of the penis where opening of the ure t h r a
occurs at the bottom of the penis instead
of the tip, doubled in the USA between
1970–1993 (Paulozzi et al., 1997).
•  C ry p t o rchidism, where testicles fail to
descend into the scrotum before birt h ,
occurs in 2–5% of male babies in
We s t e rn countries, and is incre a s i n g .
Men born with this defect are also at a
higher risk for testicular and bre a s t
cancer (Paulozzi, 1999).

•  Testicular cancer is rising in some part s
of the world. It is the most common
cancer in men aged 20–34 years (Huyghe
et al., 2003).

Testicular dysfunction, hypospadias, cry p-
t o rchidism and a higher risk of testis cancer
a re collectively known as ‘testicular dysgen-
esis syndrome’ and are recognised as likely
to be caused by a disruption of sex
h o rmones during development (Skakkebaek
et al., 2001). The decreasing number of
male births compared with females in many
industrialised countries may also be linked
to these defects in male re p roduction (Davis
et al., 1998; Grech et al., 2003).

T h e re have also been decreases in the
average age of puberty in some ethnic
g roups in the USA and other countries
( H e rman-Giddens et al., 1997; Krstevska-
Konstantinova et al., 2001). An earlier age
at puberty is associated with increased risk
of impaired stature and early onset of risky
behaviours, impairments in endocrine or
re p roductive function, and may be associat-
ed with an increased risk of cancer
(Alshuler et al., 2003b).

A wide variety of chemicals have been iden-
tified that act as endocrine disrupters by
mimicking or antagonising the effect of
h o rmones, and/or disrupting the synthesis
and metabolism of hormones and their
receptors. Chemical endocrine disru p t e r s
may be playing a role in the rise of re p ro-
ductive and developmental disorders.

4.2  Vulnerable Stages
in Developing Cells

4 . 2 . 1 C o n t rol of Cell Division
The process that a cell goes through to repro-
duce its DNA and divide to produce new
cells is called the cell cycle. The cell under-
goes four phases: gene expression and
protein synthesis (G1) prepare the cell for
the reproduction of its DNA (S), and then
further protein synthesis and growth of the
cell (G2) occurs prior to the final mitosis or
dividing of the cell (M1). This process
involves the interaction of many metabolic
and control pathways, any of which could be
targets for toxins. There are checkpoints
throughout the cell cycle to prevent the cell
moving into the next stage if previous stages
are not completed properly. Each of the 210
cell types in the human body has its own cell
cycle length, from a few hours to several
months or more. A short cycle, with more
rapid metabolic activity generally makes cells
more vulnerable to toxic effects.

Embryonic cells generally have very short cell
cycles. For example, in early pregnancy, the
brain grows at a rate of 250,000 cells per
minute (Chudler, 2003). A common regulato-
ry failure in rapidly cycling embryonic cells is
for G2 checkpoints to be bypassed. If check-
point molecules have been inhibited by a
toxin, the cell cycle may continue without all
the specifications being met, which can lead
to cell abnormalities and/or cell death
(Altshuler et al., 2003b).

4 . 2 . 2 P rogrammed Cell Death
Cell types and numbers in specific organs
are controlled by both production and by
removal through programmed cell death,
or apoptosis. For example, apoptosis
removes the webbing between the fingers,
and removes populations of cells from the
immune system that could cause autoimmune
disease. Apoptosis plays a critical role in the
developing nervous system, from early prolif-
eration of brain cells and into postnatal life.

D i s ruption of normal patterns of apoptosis
t h rough altered gene expression or failure
of signalling mechanisms is implicated in
a wide range of diseases including autoim-
mune diseases and certain cancers. For
example, the persistence of renal stem cells
that should disappear 4–6 weeks before
b i rth may make them vulnerable to postna-
tal exposures that transform them into
Wi l m ’s tumour, a relatively common
childhood cancer (Sharpe & Franco, 1995).
D i s o rd e red apoptosis during embry o n i c
development may increase the risk of
n e u rodegenerative illnesses such as
P a r k i n s o n ’s and Alzheimer’s diseases
(Brill et al., 1999).

4 . 2 . 3 Gene Expre s s i o n
Gene expression, the translation of DNA
into RNA and the transcription of RNA
into proteins, controls cell division,
apoptosis and metabolic activity of the
cell. During development, gene expression
is extraordinarily active. A high proportion
of genes are being expressed and a large
number of genes are being switched on or
off to control the cell’s activities. Such a
high rate of activity provides a wide range
of opportunities for chemicals to interfere
with cell development by interacting directly
with DNA to disturb gene expression, or
with the expressed proteins such as enzymes
or control molecules.

For instance, cell signalling within and
between cells, is key to gene expression,
cell migration, and other developmental
mechanisms. Toxins that interfere with
these vital molecular processes can cause
permanent damage to a child’s development.
Brain development, for example, can be
altered when the signal transduction of
neurotransmitters is disrupted by the
well-known toxins, alcohol and methylmer-
cury (Altshuler et al., 2003b). Disruption
of cell signalling processes has also been
implicated in the development of cancer
(Sonnenschein & Soto, 1999).

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

28

4 . 2 . 4 Cell Diff e rentiation and Maturation
Cells differentiate and mature to assume
their specific form and function within their
organ or tissue. This is under the control of
inter- and intra-cell signalling. If cells fail to
differentiate properly, following chemical or
other interference, organ function may be
compromised and foetal survival endangered.
These undifferentiated cells are also more
vulnerable to further effects of chemicals,
particularly those that cause cancer. For
example, developmental disturbances during
liver organogenesis in the first trimester of
pregnancy can lead to the embryonal liver
tumour hepatoblastoma. Extremely low birth
weight infants are 100 times more likely than
normal birth weight infants to develop hepa-
toblastoma and its development has been
linked to environmental causes (Ikeda et al.,
1997; Maruyama, 1999).

4 . 3 Vulnerable Stages

in Child Development

4 . 3 . 1 G e rm Cell Development
Sperm and egg cells (germ cells) begin
developing in the foetus and mature during
puberty. In the male the primordial germ
cells develop in utero. From puberty they
undergo constant cycles of growth, cell
division, mitosis and meiosis to produce
sperm. In females the germ cells undergo
mitosis and the 1st phase of meiosis during
foetal life. By puberty there are about
400,000 primary follicles. During each
menstrual cycle, a group of follicles ripen,
and one egg is released at ovulation.

Germ cells can be damaged during their
development in the foetus, and during child-
hood or adult life. Chemicals that harm germ
cells can harm an adult’s fertility and can
result in congenital health problems in their
children. The male reproductive system is
particularly sensitive to chemicals due to
their rapid cell cycle.

4 . 3 . 2 E m b ryonic and Foetal Development
F rom the time the sperm and egg unite
(conception) to birth, human life gro w s
rapidly from a single cell zygote to an infant.
Due to the complexity and speed of develop-
ment and the high rate of growth thro u g h o u t
the prenatal period, this stage of development
is more vulnerable to environmental exposure s
than any other period of development. There
a re three main stages of prenatal development:

• Periconceptual – (weeks 1–2

following fertilisation)
• Embryonic – weeks 3–7
• Foetal – weeks 8–38.

During the periconceptual period, the zygote
undergoes rapid cell division, implants into
the wall of the uterus and forms the embryo.
During this period, hazardous environmental
exposures usually cause death rather than
injury, resulting in spontaneous abortion
(Moore & Persaud, 2003).

Most major organs begin to form during
the embryonic period, with their growth
and development continuing during the
foetal stage and in infancy for some
systems. The period of organ development
varies from 3–8 weeks to 12–16 weeks
depending on the organ system. The critical
period for the development of the brain, for
example, is the longest at 3–16 weeks.
D i s ruption of development during this time
can result in major disruptions in the larg e -
scale stru c t u re of organs of other stru c t u re s .
This may result in death but is more likely
to form major physical malform a t i o n s
(congenital anomalies). Both the org a n
a ffected and the anomaly that results are
highly dependent on both the chemical and
the age of the embryo or foetus. For
example, the drug diethylstilbestrol caused
twice as many genetic abnormalities in male
c h i l d ren if mothers took the medication
b e f o re the eleventh week than after (Moore
& Persaud, 2003).

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

29

During later stages of development, environ-
mental exposures can result in impaired
growth, physiological defects, or functional
deficiencies. These effects may be manifest
as low birth weight, prematurity, pregnancy
complications, or late foetal death (Moore
& Persaud, 2003).

4 . 3 . 3 Infancy and Childhood
Major structures of the brain and other
systems continue to develop throughout
childhood. For example, in the brain and
nervous system, neurone migration, cell
proliferation, and synapse formation are all
very active from birth through to 3 years.
The development of cellular insulation
around nerve fibres continues for at least
10 years (Rice & Barone, 2000).

g rowth, and neurotransmitter levels. Many
low dose effects are detected following
developmental exposure. Low doses can
p roduce more serious effects during foetal
development or infancy than similar expo-
s u res during adulthood. These studies are
easier to relate to human health than high
dose studies as they are within the dose
range of normal hormone activities, and
concentrations of contaminating chemicals
in the body. Low dose studies also show
that chemicals can produce a spectrum of
health effects that vary with dose, and
a ffect the target organ in diff e rent ways
depending on the dose. For example, many
h o rmone mimics produce opposite eff e c t s
at low and high doses (known as a bispha-
sic re s p o n s e ) .

The immune system develops extensively
during childhood as immune memory (the
ability to recognise and respond to foreign
proteins and organisms) is established (Luster
et al., 2003). Improper development of the
immune system may` cause allergies and
autoimmune diseases later in life.

4 . 3 . 4 P u b e rt y
Physical growth and maturation continue
through puberty, particularly sexual matura-
tion. This process is accompanied by
complex interactions between the central
nervous system and hormone-secreting
organs, which can be affected by environ-
mental factors.

4 . 4 Health Effects of

Contaminating Chemicals

A growing body of literature is now linking
low-dose chemical studies in animals to a
b road range of health effects that were
p reviously unexplored in high dose studies.
These are subtle but important changes in
the functions of apparently undamaged
o rgan systems including alterations in
immune function, enzyme activity, horm o n e
levels, neurobehavioral parameters, org a n

While low-dose animal studies are diff i c u l t
to relate to humans, they are likely to be the
best indication of toxicity we can have.
D i rect evidence of the contaminating chemi-
cals on human health is difficult to find as
t h e re are no control groups to compare to –
we are all exposed to multiple chemicals
and at widely varying levels. A second
p roblem is that there is little data on the
combined effects of chemicals – each
chemical tends to be tested individually. A
full understanding of their effects on
humans would re q u i re testing all these
compounds simultaneously at low levels.
For example, one chemical might disturb
the immune system while other chemicals
cause cancerous changes to cells that then
go unchecked by immune cells. Chemicals
with similar effects, such as oestro g e n
mimics, together may be strong enough to
unbalance hormone metabolism. The few
studies that have combined two or more
chemicals tend to support this presumption.

The POPs that follow are all toxic in
animals. Evidence from low dose-studies
varies considerably, but all show effects in
animals, and occasional rare human studies,
that are of serious concern to human health.

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

4 . 4 . 1 A l k y l p h e n o l s
These bioaccumulative chemicals are primari-
ly hormone disrupters. Nonylphenol has
recently been classified in the EU as a
category 3 reproductive toxicant in terms
of human fertility and development.

In sewage, alkylphenol ethoxylates degrade
into alkylphenols. In the liver, the enzyme
P-glycoprotein breaks down and protects
organisms from the toxic alkylphenol
ethoxylates, but the resulting alkylphenols
are oestrogenic (Loo and Clarke, 1998).
Octyl- and nonylphenols are the most studied
of this group of chemicals.

Reproductive and Developmental Toxins

Two low-dose developmental studies in
rodents provide examples of the effects of
alkylphenols on re p roduction and develop-
ment. Sharpe et al. (1995) showed that pre -
and postnatal exposure to octylphenols
caused a re p roducible and consistent decre a s e
in testicular size and daily sperm pro d u c t i o n
in rats during a relatively short period (Ta b l e
4.2). A multigenerational mouse study
demonstrated that nonylphenol affected both
the parents and offspring (Kyselova et al.,
2003) with the predominant effects being on
the size of male re p roductive organs, sperm
quality and fertility (Table 4.3).

Both nonylphenol and octylphenol show
o e s t rogenic and anti-androgenic activities (Lee
et al., 2003a; Paris et al., 2002). Despite
having a lower binding affinity to oestro g e n
receptors, nonylphenol is a more powerf u l
o e s t rogen than octylphenol as serum has more
of a protective effect against octylphenol. This
is an important finding to consider when
comparing dietary levels and actual effects of
these and other oestrogen mimics (Nagel et
al., 1997 and 1999).

Immunotoxins

P re l i m i n a ry studies show that nonylphenol
may also disrupt the human immune system.
For example, in vitro studies in human bre a s t
cells show that nonylphenol inhibits the
p roduction of a monocyte chemokine, a
chemical which attracts and activates mono-
cytes, an important group of white blood cells
(Inadera et al., 2000). In mice, nonylphenol
also increases the production of the chemical
messenger interleukin-4 (IL-4) in T lympho-
cytes, and increases levels of IgE antibodies.
Both IL-4 and IgE are very important in

4 . 4 . 2 Bisphenol A
Bisphenol A is another EU category 3 re p ro-
ductive toxicant. Bisphenol A binds to oestro-
gen receptors range of human cell lines and
mimics all the oestrogenicity parameters,
c o n f i rming it as one of the stronger oestro g e n i c
chemicals (Meerts et al., 2001; Olsen, 2003).
In fact, although bisphenol A shows a lower
binding affinity than octylphenol in vitro, its
o e s t rogenic activity in mice is predicted to be
500 times more powerful due to interactions
with serum (Nagel et al., 1997 and 1999).

Bisphenol A follows the classic U-shaped
dose curve seen for a range of hormones and
hormone mimics. For example, in embryonic
cells, low concentrations of bisphenol A
increase the development rate while concen-
trations 100,000 times higher decrease devel-
opmental rate (Takai et al., 2000 and 2001).
In prostate cancer cells, bisphenol A increases
cell proliferation at concentrations 100 times
lower than the levels that inhibit cell growth
(Wetherill et al., 2002).

Developmental and Reproductive Toxin

The health effects of bisphenol A have been
demonstrated in an ever- i n c reasing number of
animals studies at levels 2,500 times lower than
the EPA’s ‘lowest observed dose effect’ dose.
The adverse outcomes range from altered male
re p roductive organs and aggressive behaviour,
to abnormal mammary gland growth, early
p u b e rty and reduced breast feeding (Table 4.4).
Human infants ingest bisphenol A in form u l a
at an estimated daily rate of 1.6 µg/kg/day,
giving little safety margin for doses that cause
e ffects in animals (as little as 2 µg/kg/day)
(Houlihan et al., 2003).

Immunotoxin

Various studies show that bisphenol A
can also affect the immune system by:

• reducing production of mouse

macrophage nitric oxide and tumour
necrosis factor-D
tumour growth (Kim & Jeong, 2003).
• inhibiting the production of a monocyte

, a chemical that inhibits

chemokine by human breast cancer cells,
a chemical that attracts and activates
monocytes (Inadera et al., 2000).

bodies levels, both important factors in

Human Studies

The few studies available in humans do
link bisphenol A to human health. Seru m
bisphenol A levels are higher in men as well
as in women with polycystic ovary
s y n d rome compared to normal women.
These levels correlated with testostero n e
levels indicating that there may be diff e r-
ences in andro g e n - related metabolism of
bisphenol A (Takeuchi & Tsutsumi, 2002).
This is a factor to consider when comparing

e x p o s u re levels to possible health effects.

Bisphenol A has also been found in ovarian
follicular fluid of women requiring IVF
t reatment (Ikezuki et al., 2002). Mothers
c a rrying foetuses with abnormal chro m o-
somes had higher serum bisphenol A
concentrations than those with norm a l
foetuses (Yamada et al., 2002).

Concentrations of bisphenol A have
been found at levels five times higher
in amniotic fluid at 15–18 weeks gestation
than in other fluids (Ikezuki et al., 2002).
This is a vital period of organ development
and highlights the increased exposure
and susceptibility of the developing
foetus to chemicals that contaminate
p regnant women.

Most brominated flame retardants (BFRs)
are persistent and/or bioaccumulative and

Toxicity data on BFRs are severely limited and
focus primarily on high dose studies of PBDEs
in animals. The toxic profile of the PBDEs is
p roving to be very similar to PCBs. Their
toxicity includes birth defects, liver and kidney
damage, thyroid imbalances and neuro l o g i c a l
damage to animals and humans. Generally,
the penta-BDEs seem to be the most toxic
( D a rn e rud et al., 2001; Darn e rud, 2003).

Data on TBBP-A and HBCD are almost
completely lacking. TBBP-A in vitro studies
indicate toxic effects on the immune system
and thyroid, while HBCD seems to affect
the liver and thyroid (Darnerud et al., 2001;
Darnerud, 2003).

Thyroid Toxins
The similarity of PBDEs to PCBs and the
thyroid hormone may underlie their toxicity:
PCBs, PBDEs and thyroid hormones all
consist of two six-carbon rings decorated
with halogens of chlorine, bromine or iodine
respectively (Fig. 4.1). In vitro studies show
that PBDE metabolites, as well as pentabro-
mophenol (PBP) and TBBP-A, compete
strongly with the thyroid hormone, thyroxin,
for binding to the thyroxin serum binding
protein, transthyretin (Meerts et al., 2000).
It is likely that in the body, PBDEs and their
metabolites displace thyroid hormones from
transthyretin thereby allowing increased
metabolism of the hormone and thus
decreased levels in serum. The authors specu-
late that the effects of BFRs on the thyroid
in vivo may be comparable to the thyroid-
disrupting effects of PCBs (Meerts et al.,
2000). As the development of the central
nervous system is highly dependent on
thyroid hormones, alterations in thyroid

homeostasis may result in permanent

Neurotoxins
PBDEs, such as BDE-209, can be taken up
during neonatal life, distributed throughout
the body and concentrate in the brain. They
induce developmental neurotoxic effects in
adult mice that worsen with age and lead to
abnormal behaviour. The effects seem to be
inducible only during a defined critical
period of neonatal life (Viberg et al., 2003).
For example, perinatal exposure to PBDEs at
levels from 0.6 mg/kg produced several
behavioural alterations in mice with the main

effect being marked hyperactivity at adult-
hood (Branchi et al., 2002 and 2003).
Learning and memory deficits have also been
found at adulthood for neonatally exposed
animals (Eriksson et al., 2001). A recent
study shows that HBCD also has behavioural
effects on neonatal mice at 0.9 mg/kg (cited
in Darnerud, 2003).

A rat study showed that HBCD and TBBP-A
inhibit the uptake of the neurotransmitters
dopamine, glutamate and gamma-amino-n-
butyric acid (GABA) by neurones at a
concentration level similar to those found
with studies on PCBs and ecstasy (Mariussen
& Fonnum, 2003).

Oestrogenic Effects

A range of PBDEs and brominated bisphenol
A compounds, such as TBBP-A, show oestro-
genicity in human cells lines and bind to the
oestrogen receptors (Meerts et al., 2001).
The metabolism of PBDEs to hydroxylated-
PBDEs produce more potent oestrogen
mimics. Brominated bisphenol A compounds
with the lowest bromination showed the
highest effect, and among the PBDEs, BDE-
100, BDE-75 and BDE-51 showed the
highest activity. TBBP-A does not mimic all
the oestrogen test parameters and, therefore,
could cause an unbalanced oestrogen
response (Olsen et al., 2003).

Cancer Promoters

Three PBDEs (mono-, di-, and tetra-BDE)
induce intragenic genetic recombination in
mammalian cells, which is known to provoke
a number of diseases, including cancer
(Helleday et al., 1999). Tris(2,3-dibromo-
propyl)phosphate and its metabolite 2-
bromoacrolein may be clastogens – chemicals
which cause breakage in chromosomes (van
Beerendonk et al., 1994).

and TPT, are all listed as poisons and described
as re s p i r a t o ry toxins, fetotoxins, re p ro d u c t i v e
toxins, immunotoxins, possible carc i n o g e n s ,
skin and re s p i r a t o ry irritants, and allerg e n s
( N o rris, 1994; van Heijst, 1994).

The toxicity of organotins stems primarily
from the fact that they are powerful meta-
bolic inhibitors. They inhibit a range of
enzymes responsible for the metabolism,
signalling, and regulation of many cell activi-
ties. This can cause a variety of effects at
various concentrations depending on the
target organ. (Norris, 1994).

Reproductive and Developmental Toxins

O rganotins are well-known horm o n e
d i s rupters with devastating effects on
marine molluscs. TBT and TPT inhibit a
variety of enzymes responsible for the pro d u c-
tion of male and female sex steroid horm o n e s
– oestogens, testosterone, and oestradiol
(Doering et al., 2002; Lo et al., 2003;
S t e c k e l b roek et al., 2001). While low-dose
developmental studies are lacking in mammals,
i n s u fficient activation of male hormones is
known to be responsible for developmental
d i s o rders of the male re p roductive tract.

A recent study suggests that organotins may
also cause developmental effects in utero at
relatively low doses by targeting the maternal
thyroid (Adeeko et al., 2003). Effects varied
depending on dosage but appeared to be
linked to the reduction of maternal serum
thyroxine and triiodothyronine throughout
gestation. Effects included reduced maternal
weight gain; increased post-implantation loss;
decreased litter sizes; decreased foetal
weights; delayed foetal skeletal development;
and abnormalities in genital development
in male fetuses.

Immunotoxins

4 . 4 . 4 O rg a n o t i n s
O rganotins are persistent chemicals that accu-
mulate throughout the body, primarily in the
liver and kidneys. The tri-tins, such as TBT

O rganotins are well known immunotoxins
which target a range of white blood cells
and destroy or limit their ability to
function. For example:

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

• DBT and TBT both suppress mitogenesis
in human lymphocytes. This process of
stimulating lymphocytes to undergo
mitosis is vital for the reproduction of
lymphocytes during the immune response
to invasion by organisms such as bacteria
or viruses (Nakata et al., 2002).

• TBT causes apoptosis (or self-destruction)
of human T lymphocytes (Stridh et al.,
2001).

• BPT, TBT and TPT all inhibit the cytotox-
ic function of human NK cells, which are
responsible for killing tumour cells and
cells that are infected by viruses (Whalen
& Loganathan, 2001; Whalen et al.,
2002a and b; Whalen et al., 2003).
• TPT enhances neutrophil maturation

(Watanabe et al., 2003). It also inhibits
superoxide production by human
neutrophils, which thereby limits the
ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria
(Miura & Matsui, 1991).

Cancer Promoters

TPT is a potent spindle poison – a toxin that
interferes with the cell components responsi-
ble for moving chromosomes into place
before a cell divides. TPT acts synergistically
with pentachlorobiphenyl, a PCB, to induce
abnormal chromosome arrangements in
mitosis at very low concentrations (10nM
and 50nM) (Jensen et al., 2000).

4 . 4 . 5 P h t h a l a t e s
Toxicity studies primarily focus on DEHP,
the most toxic phthalate, and DINP, and the
application of these profiles to humans re m a i n
c o n t roversial (CDC, 2003; Lovekamp-Swan
& Davis, 2003; Shea, 2003).

Phthalates are hormone disrupters that act as
a n t i - a n d rogens. The diester forms of phtha-
lates are converted to monoester forms in the
gut, liver and blood. These are considered the
ultimate toxins, and the length and stru c t u re
of the side chain is important for their levels
of toxicity (Lovekamp-Swan & Davis, 2003).

The primary mechanism of toxicity of
phthalates appears to be via the activation
of a set of proteins called PPARs – nuclear
transcription proteins that regulate a wide
variety of cell activities (Boiter et al., 2003;
Lovekamp-Swan & Davis, 2003). PPA RD
i s
found in tissues that are highly metabolically
active, such as the liver. Activation of PPA RD
by DEHP/MEHP results in decreased tran-
scription of aromatase, the enzyme which
c o n v e rts testosterone to estradiol, and there-
f o re disrupts sex hormone metabolism.
P PA Ry is highly expressed in various human
tissues including adipose tissue and immune
cells. PPA Ry is a key regulator of cell diff e re n-
tiation. By activating PPA Ry, DEHP/ MEHP
d i s rupts, for example, the critical growth and
d i ff e rentiation of the ovarian follicle.

Phthalates also have toxic effects that are at
least partly independent of PPAR activation.
Testicular toxicity is partly caused by interf e r-
ence with binding of follicle stimulating
h o rmone to its receptor on Sertolli cells
(Boiter et al., 2003). Phthalates may also bind
to the oestrogen re c e p t o r. For example, the
e ffects of 19 phthalates in human bre a s t
cancer cells (Okubo et al., 2003) showed that:

• DCHP, DEHP and BBP are oestrogenic
• DCHP, MOP and MEHP are cytotoxic
• MMP, MCHP, MBZP and MIPrP are anti-

oestrogenic.

Reproductive and Developmental Toxins

Phthalates, following their conversion to a
toxic metabolite, can produce foetal death,
malformations, and reproductive toxicity,
with different profiles for each phthalate and
different potencies (Shea, 2003).

M a t e rnal exposure of rodents to
D E H P / M E H P, causes reduced embry o n i c
implantation; increased re s o r p t i o n s ;
skeletal, cardiovascular and eye abnorm a l i-
ties; neural tube defects; intrauterine death;
i n c reased postnatal death; and decre a s e d
intrauterine and postnatal growth in ro d e n t

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

36

pups (Gray, 2000; Moore et al., 2001; Shea,
2003). Foetal toxicity can occur without
evidence of maternal toxicity. The immature
male re p roductive tract is the most sensitive
system. Pathological changes in the testis,
and decreased sperm numbers are consistent
e ffects. Prenatal and postnatal exposure
leads to complete female infertility and
d e c reased male fert i l i t y. Sertoli cells in the
testicle and the granulosa cells of pre - o v u l a-
t o ry follicles in the ovary appear to be the
p r i m a ry cellular target of DEHP/MEHP.

Other phthalates appear to have a similar
pattern of toxicity but at higher doses.
For example:

• DINP causes skeletal and genito-urinary

abnormalities (Shea, 2003).

• DBP is a testicular toxicant and causes

reproductive tract malformations in male
rats after in utero exposure (Lovekamp-
Swan & Davis, 2003).

•  M a t e rnal exposure to low doses of BBP

(125–370 µg/kg/day) lead to decreased testes
weight in male offspring following pre n a t a l
and postnatal exposure (Sharpe et al., 1995).

• DPP and DHP cause testicular atrophy

and are both female and male reproduc-
tive toxicants (Lovekamp-Swan & Davis,
2003; Shea, 2003).

Cancer Promoters

The carcinogenic effects of DEHP in liver
a re thought to be due to PPA RD a c t i v a t i o n
(Lovekamp-Swan & Davis, 2003). Humans
have one-tenth the level of PPA RD e x p re s s i o n
in liver compared to mice so the carc i n o -
genicity in humans is under dispute. The
activation of enzymes by PPA RD may also
i n c rease susceptibility to other chemicals whose
metabolites are toxic, including carcinogens.

P PA Ry plays a critical role in adipocyte diff e r-
entiation, there f o re DEHP activation of PPA Ry
in tissues other than liver could alter norm a l
pathways of diff e rentiation. This could explain
the teratogenic effects of DEHP as develop-
ment is a critical time for diff e rentiation, and
suggests that it could also play a role in
cancers (Lovekamp-Swan & Davis, 2003).

Immunotoxins

T h e re is some evidence of immunotoxicity
which may be related to PPA Ry on immune
cells. PPA Ry activation profoundly alters the
immune pro p e rties of these cells, usually
leading to the inhibition of immune
responses (Nencioni et al., 2003). For
example, phthalates can disrupt norm a l
antibody production. In one study, various
phthalate metabolites either stimulated or
s u p p ressed IgG and IgE antibody pro d u c-

Table 4.5
D i ff e rent phthalate metabolites can both stimulate and suppress
antibody production depending on their concentration levels (µg/mL).

Human Studies

An interesting study in Puerto Rico demon-
strated a link between the increasing incidence
of pre m a t u re breast development (thelarc h e )
and exposure to phthalates (Colon et al.,
2000). The annual incidence of thelarche in
P u e rto Rican girls aged 6–24 months was 8
cases per 1000 female births from 1984–1993,
the highest ever re p o rted. High levels of
phthalates were detected in 68% of all
t h e l a rche girls but only 17% of normal girls.
The authors suggest that the high incidence of
t h e l a rche in Puerto Rico may be caused by a
high exposure to phthalates due to high
i m p o rtation of plastic packaged foods, with a
y e a r- round high temperature and humidity
which promotes closed environments and
f requent use of air- c o n d i t i o n e r s .

Women with endometriosis have a higher
level of DEHP in their blood than normal
women, and 92.6% of these also had
detectable DEHP and/or the metabolite
MEHP in their peritoneal fluid (see Table
2.5, Section 2). This suggests that DEHP
plays a role in the pathogenesis of
endometriosis (Corbellis et al., 2003).

Chewing on plastics that contain phthalates
may increase the risk of developing tumours
in the mouth, and upper airway and diges-
tive tracts, according to one study, which
showed that DBP and DiBP cause significant
DNA damage to human tonsils in vitro
(Kleinsasser et al., 2001).

Patients exposed to DEHP as the conse-
quence of medial treatment with devices
containing PVC may provide evidence of the
human toxicity of phthalates. Virtually all
medical devices made from PVC contain

DEHP. Patients on dialysis, blood transfu-
sions, artificial ventilation, and exchange
transfusions are at risk. Premature infants are
particularly at risk as they are exposed to
relatively high amounts of DEHP while in
intensive care. Reports of possible links
between DEHP and disease in humans
include (EC, 2002):

• development of polycystic kidney disease

in haemodialysis patients

• pulmonary toxicity in mechanically venti-
lated pre-term infants with PVC tubes
•  cholestasis (bile flow stops) in infants with

s e rum levels of 18–98 µg/mL DEHP follow-
ing the use of an artificial lung (extracorpo-
real membrane oxygenation therapy)
• abnormalities in livers in patients after a

year of haemodialysis

• liver toxicity in Rhesus monkeys receiving
blood plasma from PVC bags over a year.

As described in Section 4.2.4, extremely low
b i rth weight (ELBW) infants are 100 times
m o re likely to develop the liver tumour hepa-
toblastoma. While ELBW infants may develop
this tumour anyway, exposure to high levels of
DEHP while in intensive care may also play a
role in its development (EC, 2002).

4 . 4 . 6 A rtificial Musks
Artificial musks are persistent and bioaccu-
mulative chemicals. Most health studies
focus on musk xylene (MX) and musk
ketone (MK).

Although MX and MK are structurally similar
and possess almost identical physico-chemical
p ro p e rties, they differ significantly in their
biological pro p e rties. Both musks possess
o e s t rogenic activity in vitro with MK showing
an affinity for the oestrogen receptor thre e
times greater than MX (Bitsch et al., 2002).
H o w e v e r, when MK is reduced to its metabo-
lite it loses its activity, whereas when MX is
c o n v e rted to p-amino-musk xylene, its oestro-
genic potency increases (Bitsch et al., 2002).

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

38

MX appears to have a higher half-life in
humans than rodents, and induces the liver
CYP 2B enzymes in rat and mice (which its
metabolite then inhibits) (Schmeiser et al.,
2001). MX has been detected chemically
bound to haemoglobin (Hb-adducts) in the
blood of ten volunteers (Riedel et al., 1999).
The ability to form Hb-adducts correlates well
with the formation of DNA adducts which
cause tumours, suggesting a cancer risk for
substances causing Hb-adducts. Chro n i c
e x p o s u re to MX is also known to cause
mouse liver tumours (Schmeiser et al., 2001).

Few toxicological studies on MK are avail-
able. However, it shows a strong induction of
liver enzyme activities in rats which are
distinct from those inhibited by MX (CYP
1A1 and 2, and CYP 2B). These liver enzymes
metabolise a range of chemicals and dru g s ,
t u rning some of them, such as polycyclic
a romatic hydrocarbons, into carcinogens and
mutagens. Exposure of humans to MK might
i n c rease their susceptibility to the hazards of
other cancer-causing chemicals. For example,
MK acts as a co-genotoxicant by amplifying
the DNA damaging effects of the polycyclic
a romatic hydrocarbon, benzo(a)pyrene, in
human cells at relatively low doses (Mersch-
S u n d e rmann et al., 2001).

The polycyclic musks, AHTN and HHCB, are
selective oestrogen receptor modulators, and
induce both oestrogenic and anti-oestro g e n i c
activity depending on the cell type and the
receptor subtype targeted. Weak oestro g e n i c
e ffects are observed at relatively high concen-
trations (10 µM) while anti-oestrogenic eff e c t s
a re seen at 0.1 µM (Schreurs et al., 2002).

One human study has shown a significant
association between MX and MK levels in
blood and hormonal and gynaecological

problems in women suggesting that these
musks cause reproductive toxicity and
endocrine effects in humans (Eisenhardt
et al., 2001).

4 . 4 . 7 Chlorinated Paraff i n s
Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) are persistent
and bioaccumulative; however, there is
very little data available on low-dose
chronic effects in animals, and none
available on their effects in humans. The
data available suggests that theses chemicals
may act as carcinogens and disrupt thyroid
hormones in humans.

The toxicity of two CPs are fairly well char-
acterised: C12 60% and C23 43%. The
C12 60% appears to have a greater potential
for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity than
C23 43%. The C12 60% is toxic to liver,
lymph glands, kidney, and thyroid; causes
benign tumours in kidney, liver, and thyroid;
and causes malignancies in kidney, and
leukaemia. C23 43% is associated with
malignant lymphomas (Bucher et al., 1987;
NTP, 1986a; NTP, 1986b).

Short and intermediate, but not long carbon
chain CPs, are potent inhibitors of intercellu-
lar communication, which may be their
mechanism for promoting tumours (Kato &
Kenne, 1996; Warngard et al., 1996).

One study has shown that low levels
(50 mg/kg) of medium length CPs (C14–17,
52%) are toxic to liver and thyroid in female
rats (Poon et al., 1995). A rare study looking at
the affects of two chemicals (at mg/kg levels) on
t h y roid health demonstrated a synergistic eff e c t
between the flame re t a rdant BDE-47 and the
CP known commercially as ‘Witaclor 171P’ in
d e c reasing free plasma thyroxine in rats
( H a l l g ren & Darn e rud, 2002).

Chemical Legacy. Contamination of the Child

39

5  C O N C L U S I O N

While this report was not intended to be a
comprehensive literature review, it does
provide ample evidence that:

• Many POPs are now being discovered in
human tissues, including breast milk, and
the blood of foetuses and newborn
children (for a summary see Table 5.1).
Given the wide range of everyday
products containing these POPs and their
contamination of the environment, it is
likely that further evidence of contamina-
tion is forthcoming.

• Unborn and newborn children are particu-
larly at risk of exposure to POPs as they
absorb chemicals more efficiently, process
them more slowly and eliminate them less
efficiently.

• There are a number of non-infectious

diseases on the rise, particularly in indus-
trial countries. These include congenital
defects, immune diseases, developmental
and reproductive disorders, neurological
disorders and cancers. These diseases
often begin in childhood, and may be
caused by damage to the developing child
– the period of life most susceptible to
chemical damage.

• While the causes of these diseases are not
clear, there is a general concern within the
scientific and medical communities that
chemicals are contributing to an increase
in these diseases.

• The laboratory evidence of toxicity varies
widely for each group of POPs, but there

is increasing evidence that low doses of
these chemicals are linked with a broad
range of health effects that were previous-
ly unexplored in high-dose studies.

• Direct evidence of the effects of POPs on

human health is lacking.

It is clear that the ‘evidence’ generally
regarded as proof of harm to human health
is not available for POPs, and even with
further research is unlikely to be. Strong
links between POPs and disease are very
difficult to establish: there are no uncontami-
nated control groups for comparison; many
of these diseases do not become apparent
until long after chemical exposure begins;
actual exposure levels are very difficult to
estimate and are likely to vary considerably
from person to person and over an individ-
ual’s lifetime; and very little is known about
the effects of exposure to chemical mixtures.

Waiting for further ‘solid’ evidence of
chemical effects on health will mean risking
irreversible damage to the health of further
generations of children.

Continued research into the health effects of
POPs is certainly required in order to better
understand the causes of non-infectious
diseases and, hopefully, to monitor their
decline as these POPs are removed from
products or substituted with safer alterna-
tives. This may be the best evidence of their
effects on health we can provide.
