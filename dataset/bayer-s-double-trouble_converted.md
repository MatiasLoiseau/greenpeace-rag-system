Our most important
staple crop – rice – risks
being contaminated
by a genetically
engineered (GE) variety
that is tolerant to the
toxic pesticide,
glufosinate.

Bayer’s Double Trouble

The GE rice has been developed by Bayer CropScience AG, a
subsidiary company of the German chemical giant Bayer AG. The rice
– technical name LL62 – has been genetically-engineered to withstand
high doses of glufosinate, sprayed on rice fields by farmers to control a
wide range of weeds. The weeds will die, the GE rice will survive.

Any use of the Bayer GE rice will lead to an increased use of the toxic
herbicide – undoubtedly boosting sales of Bayer’s glufosinate as a
consequence. It will also lead to higher risks for farmers, consumers
and the environment. Glufosinate is considered to be so dangerous to
humans and the environment that it will soon be banned in Europe in
accordance with recently-adopted EU legislation.

Currently, Bayer is pushing for legal approval of its GE rice in Brazil,
South Africa, the EU, India and the Philippines. In the USA, the Bayer
GE rice has already been approved for commercial planting, although
farmers in the US are reluctant to plant it. They fear the loss of
important markets due to the risks of accidental contamination, and
not without reason. Bayer already has a history of causing damages
that have been estimated at more than USD 1.2 billion to the global
rice industry, when one of its experimental GE rice varieties
accidentally entered global rice supplies in 2006.

Bayer’s Double Trouble: When genetically engineered rice meets a toxic pesticide 3

The risks of glufosinate

High risk to human health

Residues in food

Glufosinate residues in food are an area of concern, especially when
glufosinate is used as a desiccant. Glufosinate residues can be found,
for example, in pre-harvest treated potatoes.

Also for Bayer’s GE rice, it is highly likely that toxic residue levels
remain in harvested rice. Because of the engineered gene, the rice can
be treated, in much later stages of development, with comparatively
high glufosinate concentrations. According to the US Environmental
Protection Agency, processing studies of Bayer’s GE rice showed that
glufosinate and its metabolites were found in all processed rice
commodities.5 Boiling or cooking does not destroy these residues.6

Glufosinate is applied to potatoes just before harvesting to kill the
green crop above the ground. Glufosinate residues are then found
in the potatoes, and are not affected by boiling. When glufosinate
was being assessed by the European Union, it was predicted that
its use on potatoes could lead to an acute risk for 4-6 year old
children consuming treated potatoes. The safety margin between
the limit for single high exposure (acute reference dose) for toddlers
and the level of glufosinate that caused severe effects in dogs,
including damage to the heart and death, was extremely narrow.

Glufosinate is a pesticide that is used to control a wide range of weeds
in crop fields, and also as a desiccant to dry out crops before harvest.
It is registered for use in more than 40 countries under a number of
trade names including Basta, Rely, Finale, Challenge and Liberty.

Compared to other herbicides, glufosinate is a comparatively toxic
pesticide and has been criticised by governments. It poses a
considerable risk to farmers, harms insects in surrounding areas and is
potentially dangerous for consumers when eating food containing
residues of the herbicide.1 The evidence against glufosinate is so
strong that it is among 22 agrochemicals that will soon have to be
phased out across Europe.2

When the EU reviewed the authorisation of glufosinate a few years
ago, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2005 concluded
that:

• The toxic residue level in potatoes on which glufosinate had been

used posed ‘an acute risk for toddlers’;

• ‘A high risk to mammals’ had been identified;

• Farmers using glufosinate on genetically-engineered maize were

being exposed to unsafe toxic concentrations, even when protective
equipment was being used; and

• A ‘high risk’ had been identified for insects and wild plants even
outside the sprayed fields, which might lead to a serious loss of
biodiversity.

A European Commission working group suggested classifying
glufosinate as a ‘possible risk of harm to the unborn child’ and that it
‘may impair fertility’.3 The EFSA study from 2005 states very clearly:
“the critical effect of glufosinate-ammonium is severe effects on
reproduction toxicity”.4

The risks of Bayer’s GE rice

Based on the company’s own data, it must be concluded that Bayer
CropScience’s GE rice does not have the same nutritional value as its
natural counterparts. There are significant differences in composition,
especially for two vitamins (E and B5), calcium, iron and erucic acid (a
monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid). This difference was consistent
across up to 14 different sites where the rice varieties tested had been
growing for over two years. 7

Apparently, key genetic sequences and metabolic pathways have
been interrupted by the newly-inserted gene, leading to as yet
unknown changes in the GE rice’s metabolism. This has been
acknowledged by EFSA: ‘The compositional data obtained from
individual locations showed statistically significant differences in the
level of several compounds’.8

Comparing GE rice with a wide range of non-GE rice varieties that vary
naturally in their composition is a ploy commonly used by GE
companies to ignore these differences. From a safety point-of-view,
however, it is important to compare a GE variety directly with its sister
variety. Consistent differences when making this direct comparison
indicate a major unintended shift in the metabolism with unknown and
unforeseeable consequences for human health.

Independent studies on the safety of GE crops for either animals or
humans are severely lacking in scientific literature.9 We simply do not
know if GE crops are safe for animal or human consumption because
long-term studies have hardly ever been performed.

There is no doubt, however, that GE crops have a greater potential to
cause allergenic reactions than those produced by conventional
breeding,10 and a recent study by the Austrian government showed
that GE maize had a negative effect on the reproduction of mice.11
Taking the reprotoxic effect of glufosinate into account, major
concerns for human health must be raised.

The risks of superweeds

Any use of Bayer CropScience’s GE rice will lead to an increase in the
spraying of herbicides in the fields to get rid of weeds. However, there
is a high risk that, in the mid-term, farmers will suffer from more weeds
in rice fields that are difficult to control because they have become
resistant to herbicides.

An important weed in rice is the so-called ‘wild rice’ – weeds that are
similar to rice, and which can readily cross with cultivated rice. It is
likely that, through the process of sexual reproduction, these weeds
will acquire the new artificial gene that confers glufosinate resistance,
and will subsequently become a major burden in all rice-growing
areas. This passing on of herbicide-tolerant genes from the GE rice to
‘wild rice’ would have grave consequences. Once they have been
integrated into the weeds’ population, the herbicide-tolerant genes
cannot be eradicated; the feral populations of ‘wild rice’ would persist
and provide a reservoir of herbicide-tolerant genes that would, in turn,
contaminate conventional rice.

Similar effects have already been noted with widely planted GE crops
that are resistant to another herbicide, glyphosate. Glyphosate-
resistant weeds are now occurring in direct association with Roundup
GE crop cultivation in many parts of the USA.12 In Argentinian GE
soybean fields, new weeds tolerant to glyphosate are replacing the
weeds usually found in the fields.13 Other more notorious herbicides
are now being advertised to control glyphosate-resistant weeds.14

GE crops tolerant to glufosinate have not been widely planted but, if
they are, weed resistance to this herbicide will undoubtedly become a
problem. There are both economic implications because of the
additional herbicide costs to farmers, and environmental implications
because of the increased and stronger herbicides that will become
necessary as a result.

Greenpeace Demands

1) Greenpeace demands that Bayer stops
the marketing of its GE rice globally.

2) We ask the governments of Brazil, South

Africa, the Philippines, the European Union
and all other countries to protect their own
crops and fields by rejecting Bayer’s GE
rice, and to stop GE rice field trials.

3) We ask all farmers to protect their own

fields and crops from GE rice, which can
only ever bring with it economic loss and
environmental threats.

4) We ask all market stakeholders – from

traders and processors to food companies
and supermarkets – to say a clear ‘No!’ to
GE rice.

Bayer’s GE rice – a 1.2 billion dollar burden on the
global rice industry

In 2006, a major scandal erupted as world rice supplies were
discovered to be contaminated with an unapproved GE rice variety
from Bayer CropScience. Field trials in the US led to Bayer GE rice
variety entering global food supply chains. Contaminated food
stocks were found on and pulled from shelves in stores and
supermarkets across the world. Widespread bans on US-produced
rice were enacted.
As a result, farmers, millers, traders and retailers around the globe
are facing massive financial costs, including testing and recall costs,
cancelled orders, import bans, brand damage and consumer
distrust.
The global costs from this one contamination event – which arose
from a single, small-scale field trial – have been estimated to be up
to 1.285 billion dollars.15
Bayer CropScience tries to evade any liability for these damages by
calling the contamination an ‘Act of God’.16

Conclusion:
Stay away from Bayer’s GE rice!

At present, no genetically-engineered rice is grown commercially
anywhere in the world. Other big companies have abandoned any
intentions to market GE rice and, with rice being the world’s most
important staple crop, most countries have shied away from allowing
risky experimentation with it.

Bayer, however, seems to recognise no borders and it is aggressively
trying to force GE rice into markets in Brazil, Europe, Africa and Asia.

For half of the global population, rice is daily food. But Bayer’s ‘double
trouble’ – GE rice and glufosinate – are putting farmers’ and
consumers’ health at risk. The high likelihood of new superweeds is a
direct threat to food security and global rice markets will suffer financial
consequences if Bayer’s rice runs wild – again – and causes accidental
contamination of global rice supplies.

In early 2009, the EU adopted legislation that regulates the production and licensing of

agrochemicals. It sets clear criteria for the approval of these products, forbidding the

authorisation and re-authorisation of agrochemicals classified as toxic for reproduction,

carcinogenic or mutagenic. Based on these criteria, 22 currently-authorised

agrochemicals, including glufosinate, cannot have their marketing licence extended.
